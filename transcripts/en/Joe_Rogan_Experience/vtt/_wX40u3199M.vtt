00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.281
<v Speaker 1>He travels,</v>

3
00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:02.961
<v Speaker 1>he's worldwide.</v>

4
00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:03.721
<v Speaker 1>I won't lie to you.</v>

5
00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:04.740
<v Speaker 1>I travel a great deal.</v>

6
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.590
<v Speaker 1>What were we talking about right before the podcast started where it says you</v>

7
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:11.320
<v Speaker 1>have to set and you have to bring this up on the podcast about about,</v>

8
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>so I did a podcast today with a guy from cracked.com Dan O'brian wrote a really</v>

10
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 1>funny book called how to fight presidents.</v>

11
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.200
<v Speaker 1>He literally took every president in the history of America to see who is the</v>

12
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:25.891
<v Speaker 1>baddest ass,</v>

13
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:28.920
<v Speaker 1>who's the one guy you wouldn't want to fight and who would win in a fight if</v>

14
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:30.000
<v Speaker 1>they were pitted against each other.</v>

15
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's in some ways the greatest book of all time.</v>

16
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.110
<v Speaker 1>And like I said,</v>

17
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:34.560
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

18
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.040
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>

19
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.690
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be the greatest podcast both times.</v>

20
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.950
<v Speaker 1>It was the funniest thing because we got to know a heavy heated argument about</v>

21
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.390
<v Speaker 1>who would win in a fight.</v>

22
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>And you got to put a couple of presidents up at the top of the list.</v>

23
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>You got to put a Blinken cause he was renowned for his physical strength.</v>

24
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

25
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a thug.</v>

26
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Speaker 1>He fought vampires to right.</v>

27
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.091
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

28
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:51.924
<v Speaker 1>he did,</v>

29
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:52.860
<v Speaker 1>but he used the movie.</v>

30
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.843
<v Speaker 1>He used an ax,</v>

31
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 1>but Abe Lincoln was six,</v>

32
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:56.130
<v Speaker 1>four and had,</v>

33
00:00:56.131 --> 00:00:58.260
<v Speaker 1>what's that disease where your arms are longer,</v>

34
00:00:58.261 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>you have really long arms,</v>

35
00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:01.140
<v Speaker 1>like longer than your body had crazy island.</v>

36
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.740
<v Speaker 1>And he was,</v>

37
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.240
<v Speaker 1>he was known to be really strong and,</v>

38
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:04.981
<v Speaker 1>and very,</v>

39
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>very tough.</v>

40
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Acute [inaudible] I'm starting to also want to say was,</v>

41
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>I think you also have to think of people that lived during that era.</v>

42
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>There were a lot tougher.</v>

43
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.420
<v Speaker 1>They grew up doing everything with their hands,</v>

44
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:15.691
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

45
00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:16.524
<v Speaker 1>Building things.</v>

46
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Andrew Jackson was a gentle,</v>

47
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.841
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

48
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>he committed a little something called genocide.</v>

49
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.250
<v Speaker 1>And you talked to historians.</v>

50
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.710
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

51
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

52
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.610
<v Speaker 1>he killed a great deal of native Americans with extreme prejudice.</v>

53
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:27.810
<v Speaker 1>So he hit,</v>

54
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he's still,</v>

55
00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:30.740
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>

56
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

57
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.100
<v Speaker 1>that's a strong word.</v>

58
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Funny you say,</v>

59
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

60
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.233
<v Speaker 1>hold on Steve.</v>

61
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't think disease transmission counts.</v>

62
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.153
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

63
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.270
<v Speaker 1>Is that what he did leave?</v>

64
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.681
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

65
00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:42.380
<v Speaker 1>He was a soldier and,</v>

66
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.233
<v Speaker 1>and did,</v>

67
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.191
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was,</v>

68
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:44.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.741
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

70
00:01:44.741 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 1>he clearly probably killed a lot of men with his bare hands.</v>

71
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was bare hands,</v>

72
00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:49.440
<v Speaker 1>but certainly with a gun or a knife.</v>

73
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:53.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was a pretty warlike fella and in fact challenged.</v>

74
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.450
<v Speaker 1>He had a number of duals.</v>

75
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Historians are actually,</v>

76
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

77
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.910
<v Speaker 1>he got shot and live most of his life with a bullet in his rib cage.</v>

78
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Shitty guns back then,</v>

79
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.880
<v Speaker 1>but he had to clean three.</v>

80
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.480
<v Speaker 1>There's a debate how many duals he actually had.</v>

81
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.290
<v Speaker 1>When you have,</v>

82
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 1>when there's a debate on how many duels fucking president,</v>

83
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 1>you're a bad mother fucker or you're an idiot,</v>

84
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

85
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.740
<v Speaker 1>You keep getting a duels.</v>

86
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

87
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>he got shot because he let the guy take the first shot.</v>

88
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.941
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

89
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 1>take the first shot guy shot him.</v>

90
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Then he shot the guy and live that way for the rest of his life.</v>

91
00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:23.421
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

92
00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 1>he had,</v>

93
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.540
<v Speaker 1>he had a gaping wound that would,</v>

94
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Speaker 1>cause problems periodically and you take the first shot</v>

96
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>you got to Andrew Jackson,</v>

97
00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:33.570
<v Speaker 1>who was 62 he was struck,</v>

98
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.490
<v Speaker 1>he had to be drawn to the George Washington 64 who was a tough guy.</v>

99
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.400
<v Speaker 1>George Washington was six four he was,</v>

100
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>people weren't that big that they know he was a giant.</v>

101
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.940
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you six for Jesus Christ.</v>

102
00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:45.774
<v Speaker 1>George Washington was,</v>

103
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.633
<v Speaker 1>it's a small solar,</v>

104
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.493
<v Speaker 1>so it's yours.</v>

105
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.343
<v Speaker 1>Washer could have beat</v>

106
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 1>my money on Doug.</v>

107
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.620
<v Speaker 1>George has wooden teeth.</v>

108
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:54.080
<v Speaker 1>He's got a fucking goofy wig on.</v>

109
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.290
<v Speaker 1>You pull that wig off.</v>

110
00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 1>He's all insecure about his hair.</v>

111
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

112
00:02:58.471 --> 00:02:59.500
<v Speaker 1>you pull that off.</v>

113
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:00.830
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to know what the fuck to do.</v>

114
00:03:00.831 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 1>He's going to search for his wig.</v>

115
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>You kick him in the Dick.</v>

116
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.821
<v Speaker 1>Next thing you know,</v>

117
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>you're pulling out his wooden teeth and beating the shit out of him.</v>

118
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.873
<v Speaker 1>Got My money on.</v>

119
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 1>But then there was Lyndon Johnson who's also six four but Teddy Roosevelt who</v>

120
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:11.891
<v Speaker 1>practice,</v>

121
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:12.724
<v Speaker 1>who boxed,</v>

122
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.850
<v Speaker 1>wrestled and practiced judo with the guy who brought judo to the United States,</v>

123
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.780
<v Speaker 1>the first judo guy.</v>

124
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 1>And was obsessed with all things wrestling and fighting.</v>

125
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 1>He was about five,</v>

126
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:24.191
<v Speaker 1>10 and very thick,</v>

127
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 1>but it very sickly kid died of heart disease.</v>

128
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:26.891
<v Speaker 1>How do we cart?</v>

129
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:27.724
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>

130
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 1>My thing is Gerald Ford played football and could have played for the bears as a</v>

131
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:32.164
<v Speaker 1>middle linebacker.</v>

132
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 1>That says a lot when you play in the NFL.</v>

133
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.480
<v Speaker 1>So I might have to go with a,</v>

134
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>we had a huge discussion about this for a good hour.</v>

135
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 1>I go with Luke Bryan Callen show and a,</v>

136
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 1>it was a good time.</v>

137
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.573
<v Speaker 1>I got Lincoln.</v>

138
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.211
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>

139
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 1>that's not what you were talking about.</v>

140
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

141
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:46.571
<v Speaker 1>So then he said,</v>

142
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:46.871
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

143
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:48.040
<v Speaker 1>what about Barack Obama?</v>

144
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.790
<v Speaker 1>And he got quiet there.</v>

145
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Dan's a comedian,</v>

146
00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:51.670
<v Speaker 1>really good guy.</v>

147
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.800
<v Speaker 1>He got quiet and they said,</v>

148
00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:53.021
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

149
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 1>I can't really,</v>

150
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

151
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:54.151
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

152
00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:54.321
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

153
00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather leave that alone.</v>

154
00:03:55.271 --> 00:03:55.541
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

155
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:56.051
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

156
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

157
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.981
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

158
00:03:56.981 --> 00:03:57.761
<v Speaker 1>I tried not to,</v>

159
00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:01.180
<v Speaker 1>you try not to include any living presidents because it causes too much trouble.</v>

160
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.931
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

161
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

162
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.071
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

163
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:03.251
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

164
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 1>I went through sort of a thing about how,</v>

165
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

166
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama's not that tough of president and it'd be easy to kick his ass.</v>

167
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

168
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

169
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>I was doing it tongue and cheek.</v>

170
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:13.211
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

171
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:15.570
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably kick him here and he's kind of skinny and you could do,</v>

172
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.910
<v Speaker 1>and he gets a call from the secret service because he posted it as a blog.</v>

173
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 1>You Post it as a blog come from cracked.com.</v>

174
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.461
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

175
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:28.960
<v Speaker 1>he said the reason the only blog that's not up there anymore is that because he</v>

176
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:31.030
<v Speaker 1>got called down to the federal building,</v>

177
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:31.864
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

178
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.250
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what he said.</v>

179
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.210
<v Speaker 1>It's on my podcast.</v>

180
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 1>And he had to go line by line with these agents on what he meant by what he was</v>

181
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:39.881
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

182
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:40.481
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

183
00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:40.811
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

184
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

185
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

186
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.980
<v Speaker 1>I said a Dick Tornado instead of a penis cycling because it's kind of funnier.</v>

187
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.910
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to teach them for humor.</v>

188
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.590
<v Speaker 1>These guys were totally fucked.</v>

189
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.870
<v Speaker 1>He got all nervous.</v>

190
00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 1>He was like apologizing.</v>

191
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.030
<v Speaker 1>He made them edit,</v>

192
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.863
<v Speaker 1>take it down.</v>

193
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.850
<v Speaker 1>And it was a chapter that was isolated from the book.</v>

194
00:04:57.851 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

195
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.620

196

<v Speaker 1>we live in America.</v>

197
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:02.830
