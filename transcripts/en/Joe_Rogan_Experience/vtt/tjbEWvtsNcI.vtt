<v Speaker 1>the code name,</v>

10
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:17.910
<v Speaker 1>Rogan,</v>

11
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.760
<v Speaker 1>you get 15% off the number one sex toy for men.</v>

12
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.830
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking awesome product.</v>

13
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 1>It's embarrassing.</v>

14
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.020
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

15
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>You'll feel bad once you actually come inside this thing.</v>

16
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not a proud moment.</v>

17
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:31.800
<v Speaker 1>It's not the peak of your existence.</v>

18
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 1>But if you just look at it,</v>

19
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.990
<v Speaker 1>if you separate yourself and look at it objectively,</v>

20
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.921
<v Speaker 1>all it is,</v>

21
00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:41.010
<v Speaker 1>is a tool that allows you to masturbate more efficiently.</v>

22
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.140
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a firm believer that masturbation is a certain type of body maintenance.</v>

23
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I think it's necessary.</v>

24
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.470
<v Speaker 1>So this allows you to do that better.</v>

25
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Just clean it and just erase,</v>

26
00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>erase bad memories.</v>

27
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.503
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

28
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.531
<v Speaker 1>Entering the code name,</v>

32
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.823
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

33

<v Speaker 1>you know and you don't have to cuddle.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I like coddling.</v>

41
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

42
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.303

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.113
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

44
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.993
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that at all.</v>

45
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Still waiting for the disposable flashlight.</v>

46
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be big whenever they fucking have the balls to come out with</v>

47
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:17.281
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

48
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:18.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to see people will wash it.</v>

49
00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Just like you used to wash condoms.</v>

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.693
<v Speaker 1>It's got a camera.</v>

51
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Just make it so cheap.</v>

54
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 1>you can call it a bad idea.</v>

55
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.980
<v Speaker 1>If it could be like five bucks,</v>

<v Speaker 3>what's Alpha brand?</v>

211
00:05:27.921 --> 00:05:28.754
<v Speaker 3>It's a cognitive news,</v>

212
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:29.600
<v Speaker 3>nutrition,</v>

214
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.280
<v Speaker 3>It's some brain pills that recently got reviewed in the Atlantic favorably.</v>

215
00:05:34.281 --> 00:05:36.220
<v Speaker 3>They enjoyed them and they said that it,</v>

216
00:05:36.221 --> 00:05:36.470
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

217

00:05:38.061 --> 00:05:39.380
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Bravo shut that shit off.</v>

221
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:40.251
<v Speaker 3>He said that,</v>

222
00:05:40.251 --> 00:05:40.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

223
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.881
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

224
00:05:40.881 --> 00:05:43.520
<v Speaker 3>they work great for when you haven't gotten enough sleep.</v>

225
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.360
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

226
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.920
<v Speaker 3>that's what I found him for as well.</v>

227
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

228
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.611
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

229
00:05:46.611 --> 00:05:49.020
<v Speaker 3>I love taking them on jet lag to it.</v>

230
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.530
<v Speaker 3>What they are as a cognitive enhancing supplement,</v>

231
00:05:51.531 --> 00:05:54.230
<v Speaker 3>a supplement that allows your brain to produce more neurotransmitters.</v>

232
00:05:54.231 --> 00:05:55.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand the science behind it,</v>

233
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 3>but I've read a lot it and I tried to memorize</v>

234
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.840
<v Speaker 4>it but it's really just goes in one ear and out the other.</v>

235
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:01.340
<v Speaker 4>But the bottom line is we're,</v>

236
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:06.341
<v Speaker 4>we're funding a university double blind placebo tests on it from a prestigious</v>

237
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 4>university in Australia.</v>

238
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.541
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

239
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

240
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Speaker 4>there were trying to do it as scientifically as possible.</v>

241
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:12.770
<v Speaker 4>There's something to all this stuff.</v>

242
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 4>There's something to nootropics you don't have to believe,</v>

243
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:18.050
<v Speaker 4>but if you're interested in Google the word nootropic,</v>

244
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.730
<v Speaker 4>then once you've done that,</v>

245
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.300
<v Speaker 4>explore all the options before you even think about buying an Alpha brain.</v>

246
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.430
<v Speaker 4>Try all kinds of shit buying in bulk.</v>

247
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.750
<v Speaker 4>And if you want to take our ingredient list just taken off and,</v>

248
00:06:28.751 --> 00:06:29.200
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

249
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.470
<v Speaker 4>it's too expensive view.</v>

250
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.090
<v Speaker 4>This is the best way to do it.</v>

251
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.650
<v Speaker 4>Steal the ingredient lists,</v>

252
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:34.131
<v Speaker 4>copy it.</v>

253
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:34.910
<v Speaker 4>That's not stealing it.</v>

254
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:35.743
<v Speaker 4>Just copy it.</v>

255
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.790
<v Speaker 4>You have full right to it's online.</v>

256
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.960
<v Speaker 4>Copy it and make it,</v>

257
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.070
<v Speaker 4>mix it all up yourself.</v>

258
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.903
<v Speaker 4>You'll save some money.</v>

259
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.440
<v Speaker 4>I hope you do and I hope it works.</v>

260
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.180
<v Speaker 4>If you don't want to do that,</v>

261
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:45.014
<v Speaker 4>we sell it.</v>

262
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.360
<v Speaker 4>If you buy it and you don't like it,</v>

263
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.600
<v Speaker 4>you get for the first order for 30 pills,</v>

264
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 4>you get your money back 100% you don't even have to send the pills back.</v>

265
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.750
<v Speaker 4>We're trying to make it like as easy as possible.</v>

266
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 4>The last thing I want is anybody to feel ripped off,</v>

267
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.840
<v Speaker 4>but I use this shit and I enjoy it and I think it's fucking awesome.</v>

268
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.340
<v Speaker 4>I love nootropics.</v>

269
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 4>I've been taking nootropics before.</v>

270
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:06.890
<v Speaker 4>I got involved with Alpha brain.</v>

271
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.030
<v Speaker 4>I've taken a bunch of them.</v>

272
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.691
<v Speaker 4>They work.</v>

273
00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:12.080
<v Speaker 4>There's vitamins that can enhance the way your mind operates.</v>

274
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.351
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

275
00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:13.131
<v Speaker 4>it's not great.</v>

276
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:13.931
<v Speaker 4>It's not significant.</v>

277
00:07:13.931 --> 00:07:15.710
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to turn a morning into a genius,</v>

278
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.400
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>

279
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:16.941
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>

280
00:07:16.941 --> 00:07:18.080
<v Speaker 4>it helps me run smoother.</v>

281
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.740
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

282
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.480
<v Speaker 4>but I believe in a lot of nutritional supplements.</v>

283
00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:21.620
<v Speaker 4>I believe in fish oil.</v>

284
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:23.000
<v Speaker 4>I take a lot of probiotics.</v>

285
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:24.590
<v Speaker 4>I believe in a lot of things that I don't sell.</v>

286
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.250
<v Speaker 4>I think it's very important to take a lot of nutritious supplements.</v>

287
00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:29.084

292
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.320
<v Speaker 4>we also make shroom tech immune,</v>

293
00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 4>which is an immunity supplement.</v>

294
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:44.650
<v Speaker 4>All this is explained on,</v>

295
00:07:44.651 --> 00:07:45.484
<v Speaker 4>on at.com.</v>

296
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.513
<v Speaker 4>And like I said,</v>

297
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:47.383
<v Speaker 4>first order,</v>

298
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.950
<v Speaker 4>a hundred percent money back guarantee.</v>

299
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 4>We used to have it for everything,</v>

300
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.960
<v Speaker 4>but then some people went online and they sold it on Ebay and they got their</v>

301
00:07:53.961 --> 00:07:54.620
<v Speaker 4>money back.</v>

302
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.453
<v Speaker 4>They hacked us,</v>

303
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:56.503
<v Speaker 4>so they win.</v>

304
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.613
<v Speaker 4>So now we changed it.</v>

305
00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.071
<v Speaker 4>So that's it.</v>

306
00:07:58.071 --> 00:08:01.100
<v Speaker 4>Go to [inaudible] Dot Com oh and and it entering the code name Rogan.</v>

307
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

308
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:02.241
<v Speaker 4>and by the way,</v>

309
00:08:02.241 --> 00:08:03.290
<v Speaker 4>it's only for your first order.</v>

310
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:04.610
<v Speaker 4>After that you got to pay full price.</v>

311
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.491
<v Speaker 4>The codename Rogan.</v>

312
00:08:05.491 --> 00:08:06.800
<v Speaker 4>Apparently it's only good for one time.</v>

313
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:08.510
<v Speaker 4>I should probably try to have that for change,</v>

314
00:08:08.511 --> 00:08:09.210
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

315
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:09.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

316
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.160

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:10.850
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

319
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:11.210
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

320
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.840
<v Speaker 4>I'll do that.</v>

321
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.650
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

322
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:12.861
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

323
00:08:12.861 --> 00:08:14.120

<v Speaker 5>The Internet has made something happen.</v>

327
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.670
<v Speaker 5>We've pulled together in less than 24 hours.</v>

328
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.250
<v Speaker 5>No other interaction with this young man.</v>

329
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:27.310
<v Speaker 5>But the Internet's a man</v>

330
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:29.863
<v Speaker 5>and that</v>

336
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:45.090
<v Speaker 2>That's the way the video looks.</v>

337
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Is there a way you can shut those music off where it doesn't do this for 10</v>

338
00:09:49.051 --> 00:09:49.650
<v Speaker 2>minutes?</v>

520
00:13:23.471 --> 00:13:23.621
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 6>I'll give him a hug and next time I see him come in here,</v>

527
00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:30.051
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

528
00:13:30.051 --> 00:13:30.141
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

00:13:30.141 --> 00:13:30.581
<v Speaker 6>he's going to do it.</v>

530
00:13:30.581 --> 00:13:31.980
<v Speaker 6>Eventually we had to reschedule it.</v>

531
00:13:31.981 --> 00:13:32.801
<v Speaker 6>So I think to me,</v>

532
00:13:32.801 --> 00:13:34.590
<v Speaker 6>I think I forgot when we rescheduled too,</v>

533
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.500
<v Speaker 6>but um,</v>

534
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:35.741
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

535
00:13:35.741 --> 00:13:38.560
<v Speaker 6>he's gonna come in and do the podcast and bring a show in here as well.</v>

536
00:13:38.561 --> 00:13:40.610
<v Speaker 6>We're going to do his whole show from here.</v>

537
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:41.200
<v Speaker 6>He's a good dude.</v>

538
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:41.411
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

539
00:13:41.411 --> 00:13:41.850
<v Speaker 6>he's really good.</v>

540
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:42.101
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

541
00:13:42.101 --> 00:13:43.000
<v Speaker 6>I mean if I didn't know me,</v>

542
00:13:43.001 --> 00:13:44.470
<v Speaker 6>I might think I'd be a Douche bag too.</v>

543
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:45.310
<v Speaker 6>That's all right.</v>

544
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.810
<v Speaker 6>I look exactly like a Douche bag.</v>

545
00:13:46.811 --> 00:13:47.644
<v Speaker 6>Should look.</v>

546
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.620
<v Speaker 6>This is uncomfortable with me and this is going to get fucking off.</v>

547
00:13:53.621 --> 00:13:54.454
<v Speaker 6>Can I go?</v>

548
00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.273
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

549
00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:58.931
<v Speaker 6>to a degree.</v>

550
00:13:58.931 --> 00:13:59.220
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

551
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.290
<v Speaker 6>I'm actually friends with Dana and uh,</v>

552
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.490
<v Speaker 6>Jamie and Jamie.</v>

553
00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:04.790
<v Speaker 6>Jamie.</v>

554
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:05.040
<v Speaker 6>Fuck.</v>

555
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:05.441
<v Speaker 6>I could ever,</v>

556
00:14:05.441 --> 00:14:05.561
<v Speaker 6>ever,</v>

557
00:14:05.561 --> 00:14:06.394
<v Speaker 6>no worries.</v>

558
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.780
<v Speaker 6>You know him.</v>

559
00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:07.991
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>

560
00:14:07.991 --> 00:14:08.340
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

561
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:08.600
<v Speaker 6>hang on,</v>

562
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.131
<v Speaker 6>I got to,</v>

563
00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:10.990
<v Speaker 6>what is that a video game character on the neck.</v>

564
00:14:10.991 --> 00:14:11.920
<v Speaker 6>It's not a space invader.</v>

565
00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.540
<v Speaker 6>That is a space invader.</v>

566
00:14:13.541 --> 00:14:14.374
<v Speaker 6>Congratulate.</v>

567
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:15.641
<v Speaker 6>Everyone always asks me,</v>

568
00:14:15.641 --> 00:14:15.851
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

569
00:14:15.851 --> 00:14:18.760
<v Speaker 6>that's from that show or you know,</v>

570
00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:23.761
<v Speaker 6>but also it's actually more the tattoos from the street artist invader.</v>

571
00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:24.821
<v Speaker 6>What he did,</v>

572
00:14:24.821 --> 00:14:28.270
<v Speaker 6>he went around England and did all these little tiles sets all over these</v>

573
00:14:28.271 --> 00:14:28.721
<v Speaker 6>buildings.</v>

574
00:14:28.721 --> 00:14:32.320
<v Speaker 6>So now I'll let you replace the tile with his own tiles that had a pattern in</v>

575
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:34.640
<v Speaker 6>enter through the gift shop.</v>

576
00:14:34.641 --> 00:14:36.700
<v Speaker 6>I remember in that movie,</v>

577
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.100
<v Speaker 6>I never watched that movie.</v>

578
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:39.311
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

579
00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:40.240
<v Speaker 6>it's one of the best movies,</v>

580
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.270
<v Speaker 6>but it tells me that,</v>

581
00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.540
<v Speaker 6>but it tells me it's one of those movies.</v>

582
00:14:43.541 --> 00:14:45.640
<v Speaker 6>Like I was saying last night about Restrepo.</v>

583
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.960
<v Speaker 6>Everybody tells me I have to see it.</v>

584
00:14:46.961 --> 00:14:47.441
<v Speaker 6>I have it.</v>

585
00:14:47.441 --> 00:14:48.850
<v Speaker 6>I have it sitting there on the shelf.</v>

586
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:49.420
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>

587
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.021
<v Speaker 6>when I'm at home,</v>

588
00:14:50.021 --> 00:14:50.770
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

589
00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:51.170
<v Speaker 6>let's see,</v>

590
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.310
<v Speaker 6>south park did this week.</v>

591
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:52.990
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

592
00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:54.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at the DVR.</v>

593
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:55.520
<v Speaker 3>I always go to silly.</v>

594
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:57.890
<v Speaker 3>I go to Anthony Bordain or fights.</v>

595
00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.450
<v Speaker 3>That's all I really ever want to watch.</v>

596
00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:00.501
<v Speaker 3>Movies are really,</v>

597
00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:01.910
<v Speaker 3>it's really hard to get me to watch a movie.</v>

598
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.960
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

599
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:03.590
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I just thought it was a cool thing.</v>

605
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:07.850
<v Speaker 3>It was a cool thing how it all happened.</v>

606
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.730
<v Speaker 3>I was excited and I'm,</v>

613
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.880

621
00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:28.040
<v Speaker 3>31 I just turned 31 31.</v>

622
00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:29.710
<v Speaker 3>I was going to guess less than 30,</v>

623
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:29.991
<v Speaker 3>20.</v>

624
00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:30.371
<v Speaker 3>I was going to,</v>

625
00:15:30.371 --> 00:15:31.550
<v Speaker 3>there's 28 that'll do,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

628
00:15:32.151 --> 00:15:33.920
<v Speaker 3>you're all flooded up with tattoos on a young</v>

629
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.700
<v Speaker 3>kind of poised to be the next to the straight up man.</v>

630
00:15:37.701 --> 00:15:38.091
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

631
00:15:38.091 --> 00:15:38.391
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

632
00:15:38.391 --> 00:15:38.811
<v Speaker 3>What is the,</v>

633
00:15:38.811 --> 00:15:40.880
<v Speaker 3>a hearts on the left elbow.</v>

634
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:41.091
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

635
00:15:41.091 --> 00:15:42.110
<v Speaker 3>that's the legend is all there.</v>

636
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:43.311
<v Speaker 3>So let me ask you this,</v>

637
00:15:43.311 --> 00:15:43.611
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

638
00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:43.940
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

639
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.900
<v Speaker 3>you're a fucking huge electronic creative music guy.</v>

640
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:48.241
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

641
00:15:48.241 --> 00:15:48.401
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

642
00:15:48.401 --> 00:15:48.741
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

643
00:15:48.741 --> 00:15:51.080
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea how big you are to be honest with you.</v>

644
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:52.130
<v Speaker 3>I had heard of you before.</v>

645
00:15:52.131 --> 00:15:54.050
<v Speaker 3>I thought the logo was cool as fuck.</v>

646
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:58.160
<v Speaker 3>Like I'd seen some imagery and some electronic imagery of the,</v>

647
00:15:58.161 --> 00:15:58.401
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

648
00:15:58.401 --> 00:15:58.641
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

649
00:15:58.641 --> 00:15:59.840
<v Speaker 3>your mouse logo and shit.</v>

650
00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:00.081
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

651
00:16:00.081 --> 00:16:00.321
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

652
00:16:00.321 --> 00:16:00.770
<v Speaker 3>that's like,</v>

653
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.210
<v Speaker 3>this is something compelling about it.</v>

654
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.141
<v Speaker 3>It's like an evil,</v>

655
00:16:03.141 --> 00:16:03.591
<v Speaker 3>twisted,</v>

656
00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:05.180
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic Mickey Mouse type thing.</v>

657
00:16:05.181 --> 00:16:05.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

658
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:05.990
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

659
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.890
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was.</v>

660
00:16:06.891 --> 00:16:07.540
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

661
00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:07.970
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

662
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.470
<v Speaker 3>then I started looking into it and I read something that you,</v>

663
00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:13.580
<v Speaker 3>you guys were at the fucking Roger Center.</v>

664
00:16:13.581 --> 00:16:14.900
<v Speaker 3>You guys did the Roger Center.</v>

665
00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:15.111
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

666
00:16:15.111 --> 00:16:16.040
<v Speaker 3>That was fucked up.</v>

667
00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:16.520
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

668
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.271
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

669
00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:20.150
<v Speaker 3>Cause we did the UFC there and it was the biggest UFC ever.</v>

670
00:16:20.151 --> 00:16:21.560
<v Speaker 3>It was 60,000 people.</v>

671
00:16:21.561 --> 00:16:24.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm like you're rocking out to 60,000 fucking people.</v>

672
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.490
<v Speaker 3>Well we did 20 cause we just had the floor and some of the seats but like to see</v>

673
00:16:28.491 --> 00:16:31.130
<v Speaker 3>that place filled with 60 must be fucking insane.</v>

674
00:16:31.131 --> 00:16:34.670
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen it with 60 you know that place is so big that you know the whole</v>

675
00:16:34.671 --> 00:16:35.331
<v Speaker 3>deal how it works.</v>

676
00:16:35.331 --> 00:16:39.560
<v Speaker 3>But for people who don't know at home there's a hotel inside the arena and the</v>

677
00:16:39.561 --> 00:16:42.410
<v Speaker 3>windows face where they play baseball.</v>

678
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.110
<v Speaker 3>Like it's so fucking big and this is all indoors.</v>

679
00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:45.381
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

680
00:16:45.381 --> 00:16:50.381
<v Speaker 3>cause Canada gets cold as fuck in the winter and so it's so big that you can</v>

681
00:16:50.451 --> 00:16:54.440
<v Speaker 3>play baseball at guys like Jose Conseco can hit home runs inside this fucking</v>

682
00:16:54.441 --> 00:16:55.180
<v Speaker 3>place and,</v>

683
00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:59.150
<v Speaker 3>and not and still have room to spare and still not hit the hotel.</v>

684
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's insanity.</v>

685
00:17:00.171 --> 00:17:00.770
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>

686
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.450
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the most amazing constructions I've ever been inside of.</v>

687
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:09.130
<v Speaker 3>It's also the most insanely fucking impossible to rig to because of the way that</v>

688
00:17:09.131 --> 00:17:09.891
<v Speaker 3>that dome is,</v>

689
00:17:09.891 --> 00:17:11.180
<v Speaker 3>the retracting dome part,</v>

690
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:12.560
<v Speaker 3>those rigging points.</v>

691
00:17:12.561 --> 00:17:13.480
<v Speaker 3>So if they wanted to get,</v>

692
00:17:13.481 --> 00:17:13.691
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

693
00:17:13.691 --> 00:17:15.290
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see the UFC show there,</v>

694
00:17:15.291 --> 00:17:18.260
<v Speaker 3>but like if they wanted like lights on top of the ring,</v>

695
00:17:18.261 --> 00:17:19.580
<v Speaker 3>well they can't just float.</v>

696
00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:23.510
<v Speaker 3>They have to be rigged all the way the fuck up to the top of it.</v>

697
00:17:23.511 --> 00:17:27.440
<v Speaker 3>And we're at the top and my dad to do it with ours cause we had a big spider</v>

698
00:17:27.441 --> 00:17:30.950
<v Speaker 3>trust going across the whole thing that was only maybe about 30 feet up from the</v>

699
00:17:30.951 --> 00:17:34.190
<v Speaker 3>floor but less 200 feet from the ceiling.</v>

700
00:17:34.191 --> 00:17:36.300
<v Speaker 3>So it's just like this fucked up frigging,</v>

701
00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.450
<v Speaker 3>that's a big thing with traveling artists,</v>

702
00:17:38.451 --> 00:17:38.721
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

703
00:17:38.721 --> 00:17:40.280
<v Speaker 3>Like the sets that you guys bring.</v>

704
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.540
<v Speaker 3>That's like a big thing,</v>

705
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:41.931
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

706
00:17:41.931 --> 00:17:42.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

707
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:44.660
<v Speaker 3>You too apparently has some monstrous,</v>

708
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.950
<v Speaker 3>gigantic oh set.</v>

709
00:17:45.951 --> 00:17:49.680
<v Speaker 3>That takes like a whole different picture as part of their DLA.</v>

710
00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:50.600
<v Speaker 3>So they</v>

711
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.290
<v Speaker 7>permanently build those structures,</v>

712
00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:52.890
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

713
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:57.150
<v Speaker 7>like they literally lay cement and then build the fucking building.</v>

714
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.740
<v Speaker 1>So when they get to each arena,</v>

715
00:17:58.741 --> 00:17:59.221
<v Speaker 1>they do this.</v>

716
00:17:59.221 --> 00:18:00.054
<v Speaker 1>Yes they have,</v>

717
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:01.200
<v Speaker 1>but they've only done it like</v>

718
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.520
<v Speaker 7>they have different versions of it that they can scale down or scale up.</v>

719
00:18:05.521 --> 00:18:07.260
<v Speaker 7>So when they do do it at the Roger Center,</v>

720
00:18:07.261 --> 00:18:09.690
<v Speaker 7>it's like a kind of a cheaper version of it,</v>

721
00:18:09.691 --> 00:18:11.160
<v Speaker 7>but looks the same kind of thing.</v>

722
00:18:11.161 --> 00:18:12.180
<v Speaker 7>But they had some in,</v>

723
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:12.450
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

724
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:12.720
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

725
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.990
<v Speaker 7>in Europe that they actually had to permanently build a structure for it.</v>

726
00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:18.110
<v Speaker 7>And the structure's still fucking there and they're trying to</v>

727
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.430
<v Speaker 1>salame whoa.</v>

728
00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:19.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

729
00:18:19.701 --> 00:18:21.200
<v Speaker 1>It's all part of the thing,</v>

730
00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:21.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's fun.</v>

731
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

732
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:23.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'll ever go that way.</v>

733
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

734
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.330
<v Speaker 1>How did you get to be this guy?</v>

735
00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:26.631
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

736
00:18:26.631 --> 00:18:26.960
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

737
00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:27.261
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

738
00:18:27.261 --> 00:18:30.380
<v Speaker 1>what separated you from the pack when so many people making music</v>

739
00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.670
<v Speaker 1>electronically,</v>

740
00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:32.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

741
00:18:32.091 --> 00:18:32.511
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

742
00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:33.290
<v Speaker 1>it's so a,</v>

743
00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:34.670
<v Speaker 1>it's such a popular genre.</v>

744
00:18:34.671 --> 00:18:35.000
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

745
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Did you start off as a DJ like,</v>

746
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.461
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

747
00:18:37.461 --> 00:18:37.671
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

748
00:18:37.671 --> 00:18:39.620
<v Speaker 1>I've never spun a fucking record in my life.</v>

749
00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.551
<v Speaker 1>So a matter of fact,</v>

750
00:18:40.551 --> 00:18:42.290
<v Speaker 1>you actually don't like being called a DJ mixer?</v>

751
00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:42.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

752
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.780
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

753
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:43.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that phrase.</v>

754
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:44.230
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

755
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.811
<v Speaker 1>how can I say?</v>

756
00:18:44.811 --> 00:18:45.321
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>

757
00:18:45.321 --> 00:18:48.140
<v Speaker 1>It's so generalized that you kind of have to walk in and it's like,</v>

758
00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:48.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

759
00:18:48.501 --> 00:18:49.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a comedian.</v>

760
00:18:49.431 --> 00:18:50.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking laugh technician.</v>

761
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:51.620

<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

766
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:53.660
<v Speaker 1>What would you call it,</v>

767
00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.180
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>

768
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

802
00:19:24.461 --> 00:19:26.540
<v Speaker 1>And I started Jujitsu when I was 24.</v>

803
00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.260
<v Speaker 1>I was been producing music and Sally's 10 I got into Jujitsu just to stay in</v>

804
00:19:30.261 --> 00:19:32.510
<v Speaker 1>shape and the Jujitsu blew up.</v>

00:19:35.181 --> 00:19:35.451
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

00:19:35.451 --> 00:19:36.284
<v Speaker 1>That's what I do.</v>

812
00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:39.800
<v Speaker 1>And the Jujitsu is a total hobby on the side and that blew up.</v>

813
00:19:39.801 --> 00:19:41.000
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

814
00:19:41.001 --> 00:19:43.700
<v Speaker 1>so now over the last five years,</v>

815
00:19:43.701 --> 00:19:46.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to prove to all the people that know me through Jujitsu fail.</v>

816
00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:47.030
<v Speaker 1>They think,</v>

817
00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:47.181
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

818
00:19:47.181 --> 00:19:48.200
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to do music.</v>

819
00:19:48.201 --> 00:19:49.590
<v Speaker 1>They never took my music seriously.</v>

820
00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:51.710
<v Speaker 1>I know people like that around the block.</v>

821
00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

822
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:52.931

<v Speaker 1>every well it took,</v>

825
00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:59.780
<v Speaker 1>I understand it because no one ever in athletics has ever made it in music.</v>

826
00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.770
<v Speaker 1>So they're looking at me as like some famous athlete who's trying to make it in</v>

827
00:20:03.771 --> 00:20:04.161
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

831
00:20:09.321 --> 00:20:09.950
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

832

00:20:13.281 --> 00:20:15.050
<v Speaker 1>Are you ignoring the Superbowl shuffle?</v>

836

<v Speaker 6>that's the problem.</v>

860
00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:56.981
<v Speaker 6>The problem is like,</v>

861
00:20:56.981 --> 00:20:59.710
<v Speaker 6>I've been a musician my whole life and I'm not an athlete.</v>

862
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.390
<v Speaker 6>I'm not an athlete.</v>

863
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:01.860
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

864
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:02.860
<v Speaker 6>the world says fuck you.</v>

865
00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:03.590
<v Speaker 6>We don't care where.</v>

866
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:04.240
<v Speaker 6>Only one.</v>

867
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.560
<v Speaker 6>How did you become,</v>

868
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.000
<v Speaker 6>how did you get through?</v>

869
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:07.651
<v Speaker 6>What did you,</v>

870
00:21:07.651 --> 00:21:08.081
<v Speaker 6>what did you,</v>

871
00:21:08.081 --> 00:21:08.914
<v Speaker 6>what did you do?</v>

872
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.910
<v Speaker 6>I guess the way it kind of looks over the last five years,</v>

873
00:21:12.911 --> 00:21:13.151
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

874
00:21:13.151 --> 00:21:17.170
<v Speaker 6>As you get fucking a lot of people thinking this is like some culminated</v>

875
00:21:17.171 --> 00:21:19.960
<v Speaker 6>overnight bullshit story that's happened over the last three.</v>

876
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:21.130
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>

877
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:22.331
<v Speaker 6>in my mind,</v>

<v Speaker 1>How did they ever make any money?</v>

1031
00:25:20.771 --> 00:25:21.521
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right?</v>

1032
00:25:21.521 --> 00:25:21.671
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1033
00:25:21.671 --> 00:25:24.250
<v Speaker 1>they must've made it least fucking 100 cents.</v>

1034
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Something.</v>

1035
00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Must've had a pain.</v>

<v Speaker 1>cds for a penny.</v>

1041
00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I ever got to the CDS.</v>

1042
00:25:36.131 --> 00:25:39.930
<v Speaker 1>I think I want to do something ridiculous like that and they send them to you</v>

<v Speaker 6>I mean there's definitely a music element in that.</v>

1122
00:27:54.251 --> 00:27:54.940

1131
00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:07.420
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

1132
00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:11.330
<v Speaker 6>but I forgot all that shit when I was 16 because computers kind of came out and</v>

1133
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.010
<v Speaker 6>then,</v>

1143
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.991
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

1144
00:28:18.991 --> 00:28:19.321
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1145
00:28:19.321 --> 00:28:22.230
<v Speaker 3>cause you just work out melodies,</v>

1146
00:28:22.231 --> 00:28:22.921
<v Speaker 3>countermelody melodies,</v>

1147
00:28:22.921 --> 00:28:25.620
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff requires a certain amount of intelligence.</v>

1148
00:28:25.621 --> 00:28:28.920
<v Speaker 3>It's not just fucking know how to float that mouse,</v>

1149
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.080
<v Speaker 3>that mouse heads a good move to.</v>

1150
00:28:31.081 --> 00:28:31.380
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

1151
00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.100
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what,</v>

1152
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:36.060
<v Speaker 3>the listening to you because of the mouse head makes me feel cooler.</v>

1153
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:36.521
<v Speaker 3>When I was,</v>

1154
00:28:36.521 --> 00:28:40.260
<v Speaker 3>I was watching some youtube clips and you were on stage and you had the mouse</v>

1155
00:28:40.261 --> 00:28:43.260
<v Speaker 3>head on and you were rocking out and the crowd was rocking out and I was like,</v>

1156
00:28:43.261 --> 00:28:44.730
<v Speaker 3>do something dope about that.</v>

1157
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:48.330
<v Speaker 3>There's something I liked the fact that this fucking guy's wearing a crazy giant</v>

1158
00:28:48.331 --> 00:28:48.810
<v Speaker 3>mouse head.</v>

1159
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:52.800
<v Speaker 6>He was actually a big influence on my idea for the logo because I've always</v>

1160
00:28:52.801 --> 00:28:56.970
<v Speaker 6>recognized him as his mouse head and so then I was like,</v>

1161
00:28:56.971 --> 00:28:57.241
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

1162

1164
00:29:00.921 --> 00:29:02.220
<v Speaker 6>the idea of the mouse.</v>

1165
00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:04.480
<v Speaker 6>I did do a lot of that was Disney night.</v>

1166
00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:05.820
<v Speaker 6>You know the Dick off.</v>

1167
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:06.450
<v Speaker 6>Well No,</v>

1168
00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:07.560
<v Speaker 6>me and Disney are cool now.</v>

1169
00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.200
<v Speaker 6>You're cool.</v>

1170
00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:08.400
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1171
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.390
<v Speaker 6>Actually it was really funny.</v>

1172
00:29:09.391 --> 00:29:14.010
<v Speaker 6>We had to play a show in Anaheim once at a this at the thing and they were like,</v>

1173
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:14.641
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

1174
00:29:14.641 --> 00:29:16.740
<v Speaker 6>you know Disney called and they want you to come play a dude.</v>

1175
00:29:16.741 --> 00:29:19.710
<v Speaker 6>I'm thinking I get to be led into this like fucking dark.</v>

1176
00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:25.040
<v Speaker 6>Mickey and goofy are going to come out with some cool shit on me or Joel.</v>

1177
00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:30.460
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

1178
00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.620
<v Speaker 6>Disney has never had an issue with it at all.</v>

1179
00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.191
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1180
00:29:33.191 --> 00:29:33.401
<v Speaker 6>we're,</v>

1181
00:29:33.401 --> 00:29:35.470
<v Speaker 6>we're totally cool because it is a different shape.</v>

1182
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:36.550
<v Speaker 6>It is a different shape,</v>

1183
00:29:36.551 --> 00:29:39.100
<v Speaker 6>but since I'm a math thing and I'm not and they're not really,</v>

1184
00:29:39.101 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 6>well I guess the today that</v>

1185
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.870
<v Speaker 7>are in the music business and stuff like that,</v>

1186
00:29:43.871 --> 00:29:47.980
<v Speaker 7>but it's so distinguishable between the two identities that they're just like,</v>

1187
00:29:47.981 --> 00:29:48.071
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1188
00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:48.904
<v Speaker 7>that's cool.</v>

1189
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.920
<v Speaker 7>I'm wondering at the same time too,</v>

1190
00:29:50.921 --> 00:29:55.921
<v Speaker 7>because when I did file for a design patents on my logo and stuff like that,</v>

1191
00:29:56.321 --> 00:29:59.260
<v Speaker 7>it's like one of the first things I had to do was go to different countries and</v>

1192
00:29:59.261 --> 00:30:01.930
<v Speaker 7>apply for logo copyrights and stuff like that.</v>

1193
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:02.441
<v Speaker 7>Right now,</v>

1194
00:30:02.441 --> 00:30:07.060
<v Speaker 7>Disney must have a crack fucking team of experts of people doing this shit</v>

1195
00:30:07.061 --> 00:30:07.894
<v Speaker 7>because I'll tell you,</v>

1196
00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.540
<v Speaker 7>I used to work for a software company in Belgium that used to have a,</v>

1197
00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:12.550
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1198
00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:15.010
<v Speaker 7>a studio software and it was called fruity loops.</v>

1199
00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:16.840
<v Speaker 7>One of my favorites.</v>

1200
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:21.670
<v Speaker 7>Kellogg's put a fucking cease and desist serious on the name.</v>

1201
00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:21.941
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

1202
00:30:21.941 --> 00:30:22.361
<v Speaker 7>and dude,</v>

1203
00:30:22.361 --> 00:30:26.050
<v Speaker 7>we're talking cereal and music application.</v>

1204
00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.160
<v Speaker 7>Nothing to do with each other,</v>

1205
00:30:27.161 --> 00:30:28.480
<v Speaker 7>but for whatever reason,</v>

1206
00:30:28.481 --> 00:30:28.691
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1207
00:30:28.691 --> 00:30:30.640
<v Speaker 7>they gave in to the machine and said,</v>

1208
00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:32.720
<v Speaker 7>we're going to have to rename this studio.</v>

1209
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:38.270
<v Speaker 3>But everyone still calls it if they own the name,</v>

1210
00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.070
<v Speaker 3>they don't want you using it for anything.</v>

1211
00:30:40.071 --> 00:30:42.130
<v Speaker 3>I can understand what the true like mouse it,</v>

1212
00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:42.761
<v Speaker 3>danger mouse,</v>

1213
00:30:42.761 --> 00:30:43.431
<v Speaker 3>a dead mouse,</v>

1214
00:30:43.431 --> 00:30:44.840
<v Speaker 3>fucking mighty mouse.</v>

1215
00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.510
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's animal.</v>

1216
00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:47.931
<v Speaker 3>You get,</v>

1217
00:30:47.931 --> 00:30:48.540
<v Speaker 3>you don't get to,</v>

1218
00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:49.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm lying.</v>

1219
00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:50.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm the only lawyer.</v>

1220
00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:51.411
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1221
00:30:51.411 --> 00:30:52.460
<v Speaker 3>you don't get to own that.</v>

1222
00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:53.481
<v Speaker 3>That's silly.</v>

1223
00:30:53.481 --> 00:30:54.051
<v Speaker 3>There's true.</v>

1224
00:30:54.051 --> 00:30:54.884
<v Speaker 3>But so the actual,</v>

1225
00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:56.200
<v Speaker 7>the similarities of the,</v>

1226
00:30:56.201 --> 00:30:56.501
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1227
00:30:56.501 --> 00:30:57.520
<v Speaker 7>the circle in this thing,</v>

1228
00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:58.930
<v Speaker 7>I thought that was a little close.</v>

1229
00:30:58.931 --> 00:31:03.890
<v Speaker 7>So I kind of thought that maybe someone was asleep at the wheel when we had,</v>

1230
00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:04.810
<v Speaker 7>when that had gone through,</v>

1231
00:31:04.811 --> 00:31:06.190
<v Speaker 7>because basically it was one day,</v>

1232
00:31:06.191 --> 00:31:07.390
<v Speaker 7>it was a call from my lawyer saying,</v>

1233
00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:07.601
<v Speaker 7>dude,</v>

1234
00:31:07.601 --> 00:31:08.111
<v Speaker 7>you got the patent.</v>

1235
00:31:08.111 --> 00:31:08.320
<v Speaker 7>You're,</v>

1236
00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.153
<v Speaker 7>you're good.</v>

1237
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:09.840
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1238
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.800
<v Speaker 3>Virtually untouchable right now.</v>

1239
00:31:10.801 --> 00:31:11.100
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1240
00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:11.700
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1241
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.320
<v Speaker 3>thank God there's so baller.</v>

1242
00:31:13.321 --> 00:31:15.180
<v Speaker 3>They don't give a fuck Disney.</v>

1243
00:31:15.181 --> 00:31:15.840
<v Speaker 3>They're just,</v>

1244
00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:19.470
<v Speaker 3>the executives are sitting around and gold underwear laying on stacks of cash.</v>

1245
00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.830
<v Speaker 3>That bitch have his fucking logo,</v>

1246
00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:23.761
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1247
00:31:23.761 --> 00:31:26.840
<v Speaker 3>Who gives a shit me back so much.</v>

1248
00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:30.320
<v Speaker 3>Disney are suing other departments of disease for real.</v>

1249
00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:30.781
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1250
00:31:30.781 --> 00:31:31.614
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure,</v>

1251
00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:33.070
<v Speaker 3>do you know this for fact lie down,</v>

1252
00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:34.070
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

1253
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.950
<v Speaker 3>to be really careful,</v>

1254
00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:37.560
<v Speaker 3>selection happens,</v>

1255
00:31:37.561 --> 00:31:38.101
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1256
00:31:38.101 --> 00:31:39.540
<v Speaker 3>So it probably doesn't happen.</v>

1257
00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:41.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go out on a limb and say it doesn't have a,</v>

1258
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:43.740
<v Speaker 3>Disney was actually where I got my very first development deal.</v>

1259
00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.680
<v Speaker 3>I did a Sitcom for Disney and now and then I'll just shut the fuck up.</v>

1260
00:31:46.681 --> 00:31:47.940
<v Speaker 3>Then they were very nice,</v>

1261
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:48.540
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1262
00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:52.320
<v Speaker 3>And I was a dirty comedian man that was fucking terrible dirty comedian.</v>

1263
00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:54.030
<v Speaker 3>And they gave me a development deal.</v>

1264
00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:55.230
<v Speaker 3>They were pretty cool.</v>

1265
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:55.610
<v Speaker 3>They did.</v>

1266
00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:57.330
<v Speaker 3>They're a lot more open minded than you would think.</v>

1267
00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:57.650
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1268
00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:59.400
<v Speaker 3>they're essentially just in entertainment company,</v>

1269
00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:00.630
<v Speaker 3>but the name Disney,</v>

1270
00:32:00.631 --> 00:32:04.170
<v Speaker 3>like you automatically associate everything with like super family values type</v>

1271
00:32:04.171 --> 00:32:04.560
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>

1272
00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:04.711
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1273
00:32:04.711 --> 00:32:05.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1274
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:05.933
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1275
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:08.880
<v Speaker 3>I was up to Jonas brothers and all that.</v>

1276
00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.160
<v Speaker 3>That's just smart business.</v>

1277
00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:10.531
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1278
00:32:10.531 --> 00:32:10.981
<v Speaker 3>like there's,</v>

1279
00:32:10.981 --> 00:32:13.230
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of money and that babysitting money.</v>

1280
00:32:13.231 --> 00:32:14.670
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking a lot of money man.</v>

1281
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:14.971
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1282
00:32:14.971 --> 00:32:15.804
<v Speaker 3>it's out there.</v>

1283
00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.460
<v Speaker 3>Like Bill Hicks used to talk about with the,</v>

1284
00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:18.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1285
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:19.870
<v Speaker 3>I remember when um,</v>

1286
00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:23.760
<v Speaker 3>Tiffany and Debbie Gibson where all the shit,</v>

1287
00:32:23.761 --> 00:32:25.910
<v Speaker 3>that's when Bill Hicks was a alive and he,</v>

1288
00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:28.810
<v Speaker 3>I have all these jokes about Tiffany and Debbie Gibson and how ridiculous it</v>

1289
00:32:28.811 --> 00:32:28.981
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

1290
00:32:28.981 --> 00:32:31.590
<v Speaker 3>But the bottom line is somebody likes that man.</v>

1291
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:32.483
<v Speaker 3>Somebody likes that.</v>

1292
00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:33.870
<v Speaker 3>There's babysitting money out there.</v>

1293
00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:35.220
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1294
00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:35.460
<v Speaker 3>When</v>

1295
00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:36.840
<v Speaker 7>you met me at Modo,</v>

1296
00:32:36.841 --> 00:32:37.591
<v Speaker 7>how one,</v>

1297
00:32:37.591 --> 00:32:38.161
<v Speaker 7>how did you,</v>

1298
00:32:38.161 --> 00:32:38.960
<v Speaker 7>where did you meet him?</v>

1299
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 7>I think it was the only guy</v>

1300
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.270
<v Speaker 6>that was able to spot him out,</v>

1301
00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:46.370
<v Speaker 6>walk by because that's the game designer or a super Mario brothers,</v>

1302
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.300
<v Speaker 6>all that stuff.</v>

1303
00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:48.590
<v Speaker 6>And like were,</v>

1304
00:32:48.591 --> 00:32:49.060
<v Speaker 6>where are you?</v>

1305
00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:49.390
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

1306
00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:49.680
<v Speaker 6>Hey.</v>

1307
00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.513
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

1308
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:53.630
<v Speaker 6>Where were you at when that happened?</v>

1309
00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.950

00:35:02.911 --> 00:35:06.690
<v Speaker 4>in a inside of a lotus flower and this guy's got it tattooed on his neck.</v>

1416
00:35:06.691 --> 00:35:06.931

<v Speaker 4>The new one is different.</v>

1422
00:35:14.911 --> 00:35:16.950
<v Speaker 4>So unfortunately for those people that got it,</v>

00:36:07.831 --> 00:36:08.700
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you a funny story.</v>

1455
00:36:08.701 --> 00:36:09.121
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

1456
00:36:09.121 --> 00:36:13.740
<v Speaker 6>it's a UPC barcode because I was working with a software company at the time and</v>

1457
00:36:13.741 --> 00:36:16.380
<v Speaker 6>they did a barcode measurement system kind of thing,</v>

1458
00:36:16.381 --> 00:36:17.214
<v Speaker 6>and I thought,</v>

1459
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.641
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

1460
00:36:17.641 --> 00:36:21.450
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if you could actually scan a barcode that if it was like tattooed on</v>

1461
00:36:21.451 --> 00:36:22.260
<v Speaker 6>you and then it,</v>

1462
00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.093
<v Speaker 6>it didn't work.</v>

1463
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:24.293
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1464
00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:26.250
<v Speaker 6>well myth myth.</v>

1465
00:36:26.251 --> 00:36:27.020
<v Speaker 6>Fucking busted.</v>

1466
00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:27.540
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1467
00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:28.373
<v Speaker 6>there you go.</v>

1468
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:29.200
<v Speaker 6>Did you,</v>

1469
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.780
<v Speaker 6>you started off doing web design,</v>

1470
00:36:30.781 --> 00:36:31.110
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1471
00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:31.680
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1472
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.750
<v Speaker 6>I also did it.</v>

1473
00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:33.510
<v Speaker 6>I hated it.</v>

1474
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:33.870
<v Speaker 6>Did you,</v>

1475
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:34.820
<v Speaker 6>did you enjoy it?</v>

1476
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.700
<v Speaker 6>I enjoyed it when it was cool and fun and I had a really client and he's like,</v>

1477
00:36:38.701 --> 00:36:38.851
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1478
00:36:38.851 --> 00:36:39.450
<v Speaker 6>that's Rad.</v>

1479
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:41.130
<v Speaker 6>But I hated it when he,</v>

1480
00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:41.570
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1481
00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:41.790
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1482
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:42.990
<v Speaker 6>it's a little too blue.</v>

1483
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:45.120
<v Speaker 6>Maybe we can add some brain was like,</v>

1484
00:36:45.121 --> 00:36:45.391
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

1485
00:36:45.391 --> 00:36:46.920
<v Speaker 6>well I'm the fucking designer.</v>

1486
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:47.310
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1487
00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:49.020
<v Speaker 6>So how about I designed the fucking thing?</v>

1488
00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:49.261
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1489
00:36:49.261 --> 00:36:51.990
<v Speaker 6>if you've got all the ideas in your head and you know how to do it,</v>

1490
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.640
<v Speaker 6>then what the fuck do you need me?</v>

1491
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:55.670
<v Speaker 6>If you had a client,</v>

1492
00:36:55.671 --> 00:36:57.120
<v Speaker 6>one client came to you and said,</v>

1493
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:57.930
<v Speaker 6>Bro,</v>

1494
00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:00.660
<v Speaker 6>if you had a client and the client came to you and said,</v>

1495
00:37:00.661 --> 00:37:01.290
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

1496
00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:01.700
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1497
00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:02.680
<v Speaker 6>have a dairy farm,</v>

1498
00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.140
<v Speaker 6>we're trying to build a website and you're like,</v>

1499
00:37:04.141 --> 00:37:04.291
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>

1500
00:37:04.291 --> 00:37:05.011
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to do it my way,</v>

1501
00:37:05.011 --> 00:37:05.460
<v Speaker 6>bitch.</v>

1502
00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:10.080
<v Speaker 6>Well my way in because they're going to kind of cool.</v>

1503
00:37:10.081 --> 00:37:11.250
<v Speaker 6>You work with a customer to agree,</v>

1504
00:37:11.251 --> 00:37:13.260
<v Speaker 6>but some of the customers are just like,</v>

1505
00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.640
<v Speaker 6>some of the clients are just like,</v>

1506
00:37:14.641 --> 00:37:14.881
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

1507
00:37:14.881 --> 00:37:16.140
<v Speaker 6>you're doing this wrong.</v>

1508
00:37:16.141 --> 00:37:16.950
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

1509
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:21.570
<v Speaker 6>and I think that the balance of the way that this load understand what you're</v>

1510
00:37:21.571 --> 00:37:22.230
<v Speaker 6>saying right.</v>

1511
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:23.520
<v Speaker 6>Then why don't you do it?</v>

1512
00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:24.180
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1513
00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:28.140
<v Speaker 6>You have to have a certain amount of artistic license to do anything that you</v>

1514
00:37:28.141 --> 00:37:29.370
<v Speaker 6>don't actually go to them.</v>

1515
00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:33.060
<v Speaker 6>That's also one of the reasons why you're probably so great at your music is</v>

1516
00:37:33.061 --> 00:37:33.451
<v Speaker 6>that you know,</v>

1517
00:37:33.451 --> 00:37:35.820
<v Speaker 6>you have a very specific vision and you're,</v>

1518
00:37:35.821 --> 00:37:38.490
<v Speaker 6>you're really enchanted by that vision.</v>

1519
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.390
<v Speaker 6>You want to follow it.</v>

1520
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:43.840
<v Speaker 6>One thing about being a producer of electronic music because electronic music is</v>

1521
00:37:43.841 --> 00:37:45.090
<v Speaker 6>had this stigma for like,</v>

1522
00:37:45.091 --> 00:37:45.391
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1523
00:37:45.391 --> 00:37:46.770
<v Speaker 6>a good decade and a half of,</v>

1524
00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.130
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1525
00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:49.620
<v Speaker 6>basically people taking other people's music and,</v>

1526
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:50.460
<v Speaker 6>and then,</v>

1527
00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:50.730
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1528
00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:53.490
<v Speaker 6>working in all these justifications as to why it's an art form.</v>

1529
00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:53.761
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1530
00:37:53.761 --> 00:37:54.031
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1531
00:37:54.031 --> 00:37:55.410
<v Speaker 6>Turntablism in itself,</v>

1532
00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:56.610
<v Speaker 6>definitely a fucking art form.</v>

1533
00:37:56.611 --> 00:37:56.841
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1534
00:37:56.841 --> 00:37:58.340
<v Speaker 6>it's like look at the fucking key berets,</v>

1535
00:37:58.830 --> 00:37:59.041
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1536
00:37:59.041 --> 00:38:01.080
<v Speaker 6>and all that shit and just going fucking crazy with that.</v>

1537
00:38:01.081 --> 00:38:01.621
<v Speaker 6>That's fine.</v>

1538
00:38:01.621 --> 00:38:02.431
<v Speaker 6>But you don't say,</v>

1539
00:38:02.431 --> 00:38:03.264
<v Speaker 6>can you do it?</v>

1540
00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:04.111
<v Speaker 6>Can I do it?</v>

1541
00:38:04.111 --> 00:38:04.710
<v Speaker 6>I can't do it.</v>

1542
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.100
<v Speaker 6>Well there's gotta be an art form and no,</v>

1543
00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:06.943
<v Speaker 6>it's gotta be,</v>

1544
00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:08.400
<v Speaker 6>you can't tell me that there's not as,</v>

1545
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:10.290
<v Speaker 6>I think carpentry is an art form.</v>

1546
00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:11.183
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

1547
00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:12.271
<v Speaker 6>Everything is,</v>

1548
00:38:12.271 --> 00:38:13.090
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1549
00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:16.050
<v Speaker 6>everything with focus in a tent and you use your creativity.</v>

1550
00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:16.681
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>

1551
00:38:16.681 --> 00:38:19.410
<v Speaker 6>since you know the term Dj,</v>

1552
00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:23.670
<v Speaker 6>you know it was coined and then people started getting like kind of lazy with it</v>

1553
00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:27.960
<v Speaker 6>to the point well with electronic music to where you could just play the hit big</v>

1554
00:38:27.961 --> 00:38:32.400
<v Speaker 6>track and then just fade out that last 30 seconds and then fade in the first 30</v>

1555
00:38:32.401 --> 00:38:33.530
<v Speaker 6>seconds of the other one done.</v>

1556
00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.240
<v Speaker 6>That's to me that's not very archetypal and,</v>

1557
00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:39.370
<v Speaker 7>and it's not you and you're not adding any unique element into it.</v>

1558
00:38:39.371 --> 00:38:43.180
<v Speaker 7>So to have the kind of control where your making the music that allows you to do</v>

1559
00:38:43.181 --> 00:38:44.590
<v Speaker 7>that and in different ways,</v>

1560
00:38:44.591 --> 00:38:45.131
<v Speaker 7>you know what I mean?</v>

1561
00:38:45.131 --> 00:38:49.180
<v Speaker 7>That's what makes it special and unique to that one guy as opposed to unique to</v>

1562
00:38:49.181 --> 00:38:50.770
<v Speaker 7>that one group of fucking guys,</v>

1563
00:38:50.771 --> 00:38:51.071
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

1564
00:38:51.071 --> 00:38:51.610
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

1565
00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:53.680
<v Speaker 7>and it was getting really stagnant and there was DJ,</v>

1566
00:38:53.681 --> 00:38:53.891
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>

1567
00:38:53.891 --> 00:38:54.131
<v Speaker 7>Dj,</v>

1568
00:38:54.131 --> 00:38:57.850
<v Speaker 7>that Dj stage of that when it was all down to the playlist at the end of the</v>

1569
00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:57.851
<v Speaker 7>day.</v>

1570
00:38:57.851 --> 00:39:02.140
<v Speaker 7>And none of those guys had any of their own shit in there that made it unique to</v>

1571
00:39:02.141 --> 00:39:02.974
<v Speaker 7>them.</v>

1572
00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.150
<v Speaker 6>Just a part of the natural evolution of music.</v>

1573
00:39:06.151 --> 00:39:08.040
<v Speaker 6>And that sort of had to happen before everybody went,</v>

1574
00:39:08.041 --> 00:39:08.221
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

1575
00:39:08.221 --> 00:39:09.054
<v Speaker 6>you know what man,</v>

1576
00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:12.960
<v Speaker 6>you guys are just copying what the Ibv your own man styles.</v>

1577
00:39:12.961 --> 00:39:13.221
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1578
00:39:13.221 --> 00:39:13.990
<v Speaker 6>And you got a guy</v>

1579
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:16.270
<v Speaker 7>fucking log and he's going down on the fucking log.</v>

1580
00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:16.721
<v Speaker 7>And Aaron was like,</v>

1581
00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:16.931
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1582
00:39:16.931 --> 00:39:17.231
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

1583
00:39:17.231 --> 00:39:18.580
<v Speaker 7>And then this other dude was like,</v>

1584
00:39:18.581 --> 00:39:18.781
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1585
00:39:18.781 --> 00:39:19.810
<v Speaker 7>we'll fucking check this out.</v>

1586
00:39:19.811 --> 00:39:20.621
<v Speaker 7>He takes a fucking log,</v>

1587
00:39:20.621 --> 00:39:21.550
<v Speaker 7>does the exact same thing,</v>

1588
00:39:21.551 --> 00:39:22.090
<v Speaker 7>you know what I mean?</v>

1589
00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:22.730
<v Speaker 7>It's just not,</v>

1590
00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:24.730
<v Speaker 7>and then he's like debunking the other fucking dude,</v>

1591
00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:25.970
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

1592
00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:27.380
<v Speaker 6>It escalating it.</v>

1593
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:28.191
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] so the,</v>

1594
00:39:28.191 --> 00:39:28.341
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1595
00:39:28.341 --> 00:39:30.560
<v Speaker 6>like the people would criticize you,</v>

1752
00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:47.230

1819
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:37.740
<v Speaker 4>That's all you start thinking.</v>

1820
00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:41.640
<v Speaker 4>That's how the guys react that like what's the only reason why she was running</v>

1821
00:44:41.641 --> 00:44:43.710
<v Speaker 4>shit is cause all those English guys just,</v>

1827
00:44:48.181 --> 00:44:49.890
<v Speaker 4>We don't really believe anything we're saying.</v>

1828
00:44:49.891 --> 00:44:50.910
<v Speaker 4>We're just trying to be funny.</v>

1829
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:54.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure Margaret Thatcher was awesome by the way.</v>

1830
00:44:54.061 --> 00:44:54.780
<v Speaker 4>Meryl Streep,</v>

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:06.960
<v Speaker 6>Now this is my point.</v>

1839
00:45:06.961 --> 00:45:07.780
<v Speaker 6>I have a point.</v>

1840
00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.360
<v Speaker 6>It's arguing with people on the Internet.</v>

1841
00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:09.750
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1843
00:45:10.621 --> 00:45:10.981
<v Speaker 6>The Internet.</v>

1844
00:45:10.981 --> 00:45:12.480
<v Speaker 6>Because when we started putting that,</v>

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:18.360
<v Speaker 6>Do you ever have any plans to like maybe released like a full length movie using</v>

1887
00:46:18.361 --> 00:46:21.190
<v Speaker 6>your music and maybe animation using her logo or something?</v>

1888
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:22.063
<v Speaker 6>Well that's a,</v>

1889
00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.940
<v Speaker 6>that's a project among projects,</v>

1890
00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:24.151
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1891
00:46:24.151 --> 00:46:25.160
<v Speaker 6>You did that.</v>

1892
00:46:25.161 --> 00:46:27.150
<v Speaker 6>Then maybe Disney might want to read again.</v>

1893
00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.053
<v Speaker 6>Seriously.</v>

1894
00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:30.810
<v Speaker 6>If you were making your own animation with the mouse,</v>

1895
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:35.870
<v Speaker 6>I think that was actually up there in that whole like a pot of names to do the</v>

1896
00:46:35.971 --> 00:46:36.690
<v Speaker 6>tron thing.</v>

1897
00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:37.350
<v Speaker 6>Oh really?</v>

1898
00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:37.591
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1899
00:46:37.591 --> 00:46:39.150
<v Speaker 6>I thought I was music soundtrack,</v>

1900
00:46:39.151 --> 00:46:39.984
<v Speaker 6>what to do.</v>

1901
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.153
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1902
00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:44.340
<v Speaker 6>But honestly if it was me and I knew they were in there,</v>

1903
00:46:44.341 --> 00:46:45.330
<v Speaker 6>I'd have to give it to them.</v>

1904
00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:46.550
<v Speaker 6>I enjoyed that music</v>

1905
00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:46.830
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1906
00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:49.060
<v Speaker 4>A little bit of it was geekness Dahlia for my,</v>

1907
00:46:49.061 --> 00:46:51.270
<v Speaker 4>I enjoyed the first movie and I was like looking forward to it,</v>

1908
00:46:51.271 --> 00:46:55.200
<v Speaker 4>but it was also just just for the sheer cinematic,</v>

1909
00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:55.571
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1910
00:46:55.571 --> 00:46:55.680
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1911
00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:59.370
<v Speaker 4>the does the visuals of it all the world they created.</v>

1912
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:01.300
<v Speaker 4>I give it to you.</v>

1913
00:47:01.301 --> 00:47:02.820
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have to be a perfect story.</v>

1914
00:47:02.821 --> 00:47:03.660
<v Speaker 4>You're doing a lot,</v>

1915
00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:05.450
<v Speaker 4>you know you're getting a lot of shit done here.</v>

1916
00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:09.240
<v Speaker 4>You creating this crazy artificial world where people ride motorcycles and chop</v>

1917
00:47:09.241 --> 00:47:10.050
<v Speaker 4>each other in half.</v>

1918
00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:10.883
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

1919
00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:11.370
<v Speaker 4>I'll let,</v>

1920
00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:12.680
<v Speaker 4>I'll let you slide try.</v>

1921
00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:12.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1922
00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.250
<v Speaker 4>you got to trial a little mouse.</v>

1923
00:47:14.251 --> 00:47:18.390
<v Speaker 4>But I love it and it was kinda interesting how they're not quite ready to do</v>

1924
00:47:18.391 --> 00:47:19.590
<v Speaker 4>human faces.</v>

1925
00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:21.180
<v Speaker 4>You know the William,</v>

1926
00:47:21.181 --> 00:47:21.781
<v Speaker 4>what is his name?</v>

1927
00:47:21.781 --> 00:47:22.614
<v Speaker 4>William hurt.</v>

1928
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:23.730
<v Speaker 4>William hurt's character.</v>

1929
00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:24.481
<v Speaker 4>Pretty close,</v>

1930
00:47:24.481 --> 00:47:25.530
<v Speaker 4>but it was a little creepy.</v>

1931
00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:29.080
<v Speaker 6>I haven't watched orange in a really better it.</v>

1932
00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:29.943
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to ruin the</v>

1933
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.150
<v Speaker 1>DTV.</v>

1934
00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Marginally better than I am legend.</v>

1935
00:47:33.401 --> 00:47:34.690
<v Speaker 1>When the lion comes out.</v>

1936
00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:36.850
<v Speaker 1>Remember when the lion comes out and I am legend.</v>

1937
00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:37.430
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

1938
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:38.410
<v Speaker 1>It looks terrible.</v>

1939
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:39.940
<v Speaker 1>It it ruined the whole movie for me.</v>

1940
00:47:39.941 --> 00:47:41.440
<v Speaker 1>This line looks so stupid.</v>

1941
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:41.830
<v Speaker 1>It was fun.</v>

1942
00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:44.380
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a lion from Dora the explorer.</v>

1943
00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:46.460
<v Speaker 1>It was like did it to Dora.</v>

1944
00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Dora the explorer lion comes out of the bushes.</v>

1945
00:47:49.901 --> 00:47:50.800
<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculous.</v>

1946
00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:51.581
<v Speaker 1>It was terrible.</v>

1947
00:47:51.581 --> 00:47:52.414
<v Speaker 1>Cgi.</v>

1948
00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.610
<v Speaker 1>They can't do animals that are real yet.</v>

1949
00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:56.170
<v Speaker 1>They can do dinosaurs.</v>

1950
00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:57.450
<v Speaker 1>They can do alien,</v>

1951
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:59.920
<v Speaker 1>they can do all sorts of shit that doesn't exist.</v>

1952
00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:00.903
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

1953
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Good with old man.</v>

1954
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:04.930
<v Speaker 1>They're not bad.</v>

1955
00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:07.150
<v Speaker 1>They're not bad cause there's a lot of wrinkles.</v>

1956
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:08.583
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1957
00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1958
00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:11.470
<v Speaker 1>It's not real.</v>

1959
00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:14.890
<v Speaker 1>Pretty close to when they can't get that.</v>

1960
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:15.731
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty close.</v>

1961
00:48:15.731 --> 00:48:16.710
<v Speaker 1>So I agree with you.</v>

1962
00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:17.553
<v Speaker 1>The hardest one.</v>

1963
00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Discussing the hot chick.</v>

1964
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:21.550
<v Speaker 1>You could deal with a real rough texture with the old man.</v>

1965
00:48:21.551 --> 00:48:22.510
<v Speaker 1>What they can't do though.</v>

1966
00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:24.010
<v Speaker 1>They can't do animals yet.</v>

1967
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:25.420
<v Speaker 1>They can't do like a dog.</v>

1968
00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:27.070
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1969
00:48:27.071 --> 00:48:28.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a first the face,</v>

1970
00:48:28.241 --> 00:48:29.074
<v Speaker 1>it looks fake.</v>

1971
00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:32.620
<v Speaker 1>Definitely the head of my department for its real issue,</v>

1972
00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:33.520
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look good.</v>

1973
00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:34.593
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to</v>

1974
00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:38.590
<v Speaker 7>embark on a serious CG Durney that I can't really give too much information</v>

1975
00:48:38.591 --> 00:48:38.831
<v Speaker 7>about.</v>

1976
00:48:38.831 --> 00:48:43.831
<v Speaker 7>But we were actually like been bidding around with companies right now and dude,</v>

1977
00:48:44.231 --> 00:48:46.780
<v Speaker 7>we're looking at like 500 grand a minute.</v>

1978
00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1979
00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.300
<v Speaker 1>it's going to make 500 grand.</v>

1980
00:48:49.301 --> 00:48:49.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm no,</v>

1981
00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:50.110
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1982
00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:55.110
<v Speaker 1>that's cost to do like [inaudible] it's about,</v>

1983
00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:57.461
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

1984
00:48:57.461 --> 00:48:57.611
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1985
00:48:57.611 --> 00:49:00.980
<v Speaker 1>but we're talking like a final rendered all my posts and everything.</v>

1986
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.751
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

1987
00:49:01.751 --> 00:49:02.300
<v Speaker 1>So first,</v>

1988
00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.540
<v Speaker 1>so expensive for 90 minute movies.</v>

1989
00:49:04.541 --> 00:49:05.980
<v Speaker 1>What is that $45 million?</v>

1990
00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Well No,</v>

1991
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you want to inject it into a scene to Cambodia,</v>

1992
00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:12.080
<v Speaker 1>he just needed a car.</v>

1993
00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:16.600
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] if that's entirely CG,</v>

1994
00:49:16.601 --> 00:49:19.030
<v Speaker 1>if it's entirely CG like final fantasy,</v>

1995
00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:21.310
<v Speaker 1>the cheaper,</v>

1996
00:49:21.311 --> 00:49:24.370
<v Speaker 1>but if you are doing camera tracking with real world stuff,</v>

1997
00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:26.800
<v Speaker 1>then that's when it gets expensive.</v>

1998
00:49:26.801 --> 00:49:28.870
<v Speaker 1>$500,000 a minute.</v>

1999
00:49:28.871 --> 00:49:29.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking minute.</v>

2000
00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:30.671
<v Speaker 1>So real,</v>

2001
00:49:30.671 --> 00:49:34.780
<v Speaker 1>it isn't really is $45 million for a 90 minute movie.</v>

2002
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:38.870
<v Speaker 7>Not if it's all CG and it's not like shit,</v>

2003
00:49:38.871 --> 00:49:43.730
<v Speaker 7>like transformers is not going to cost 500 movie like final fantasy.</v>

2004
00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:44.660
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

2005
00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:46.190
<v Speaker 7>because it's all CG.</v>

2006
00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:48.560
<v Speaker 7>It increase incorporates no real</v>

2007
00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:52.110
<v Speaker 1>shit issue when you incorporate real world,</v>

2008
00:49:52.111 --> 00:49:52.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2009
00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:52.921
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2010
00:49:52.921 --> 00:49:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Because you have to do camera tracking and obviously shit makes sense.</v>

2011
00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:58.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2012
00:49:58.080 --> 00:49:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>

2013
00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:00.000
<v Speaker 1>he's very knowledgeable with all this.</v>

2014
00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:03.000
<v Speaker 1>I had a two hour long meeting about it today.</v>

2015
00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:04.350
<v Speaker 1>It's $1 million a day.</v>

2016
00:50:04.351 --> 00:50:05.390
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it jammy.</v>

2017
00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:10.290
<v Speaker 1>They sometimes do it with music videos,</v>

2018
00:50:10.291 --> 00:50:11.370
<v Speaker 1>so what they do is they'll</v>

2019
00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:15.780
<v Speaker 7>that minute and they'll split it over the whole video of like if it's seven</v>

2020
00:50:15.781 --> 00:50:17.070
<v Speaker 7>minute long video,</v>

2021
00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:17.640
<v Speaker 7>it's not,</v>

2022
00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.500
<v Speaker 7>it's not going to be six minutes of this and then Oh,</v>

2023
00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:20.880
<v Speaker 7>last minutes all with CGI.</v>

2024
00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:22.740
<v Speaker 7>They cut it in the edit.</v>

2025
00:50:22.741 --> 00:50:23.574
<v Speaker 7>It</v>

2026
00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:25.150
<v Speaker 1>so hard to wrap your head around.</v>

2027

<v Speaker 7>that explicit lyrics,</v>

2264
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:12.600
<v Speaker 2>there's so much cussing in it.</v>

2265
00:56:12.610 --> 00:56:13.381
<v Speaker 2>All my God,</v>

2266
00:56:13.381 --> 00:56:14.100

2268
00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:20.900
<v Speaker 2>but on iTunes I keep downloading the clean one.</v>

2269
00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:21.300
<v Speaker 2>There's just,</v>

2270
00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:22.560
<v Speaker 2>they just pull out the lyrics.</v>

2271
00:56:22.561 --> 00:56:22.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

00:56:24.611 --> 00:56:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Without all that shit,</v>

2275
00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:27.370
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing more disturbing.</v>

2276
00:56:27.371 --> 00:56:30.340
<v Speaker 1>When you're in a club and you're looking to have a good time and you realize a</v>

2277
00:56:30.341 --> 00:56:32.890
<v Speaker 1>song that you're hearing is a censored version of it.</v>

2278
00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:33.281
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2279
00:56:33.281 --> 00:56:38.281
<v Speaker 1>I remember a few of those that the track didn't work that one or get you forget.</v>

2280
00:56:39.431 --> 00:56:40.264
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

2281
00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:42.663
<v Speaker 1>forget you.</v>

2282
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:44.290
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>

2283
00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.180
<v Speaker 1>Good with the fuck you.</v>

2284
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:46.023
<v Speaker 1>I realize,</v>

2285
00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:48.490
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a great song all the way through,</v>

2286
00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:51.730
<v Speaker 1>but then when they change due date,</v>

2287
00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:57.580
<v Speaker 1>this is real because I might have blocked it out and they call the people and</v>

2288
00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.830
<v Speaker 1>slugging to watch that a son of a bitch</v>

2289
00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.830
<v Speaker 1>fellows or something like that.</v>

2290
00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Over dub was the girl that Brad Pitt used to be married to.</v>

2291
00:57:06.731 --> 00:57:08.460
<v Speaker 1>She's an now the other one,</v>

2292
00:57:08.570 --> 00:57:09.403
<v Speaker 1>Angelina Jolie,</v>

2293
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:10.263
<v Speaker 1>the first one.</v>

2294
00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:11.441
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2295
00:57:11.441 --> 00:57:12.011
<v Speaker 1>the first one,</v>

2296
00:57:12.011 --> 00:57:12.341
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2297
00:57:12.341 --> 00:57:13.174
<v Speaker 1>when it's</v>

2298
00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:15.070
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

2299
00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Naacos Gwenyth Paltrow,</v>

2300
00:57:17.291 --> 00:57:17.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2301
00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:18.820
<v Speaker 1>isn't that show glee?</v>

2302
00:57:18.821 --> 00:57:19.151
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2303
00:57:19.151 --> 00:57:20.050
<v Speaker 1>And she was singing,</v>

2304
00:57:20.051 --> 00:57:20.884
<v Speaker 1>forget you.</v>

2305
00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:21.611
<v Speaker 1>She was singing it.</v>

2306
00:57:21.611 --> 00:57:22.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure I heard it.</v>

2307
00:57:22.931 --> 00:57:26.350
<v Speaker 1>I might've just fury of SOC.</v>

2308
00:57:26.351 --> 00:57:27.640
<v Speaker 1>I might've just blacked out.</v>

2309
00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:31.740
<v Speaker 1>It was just too much irony for me.</v>

2310
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:32.770
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't handle it.</v>

2311
00:57:32.771 --> 00:57:33.190
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

2312
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.550
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

2313
00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:35.620
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be a part of my imagination,</v>

2314
00:57:35.621 --> 00:57:37.840
<v Speaker 1>so I couldn't even talk about it on stage fruit kit.</v>

2315
00:57:37.841 --> 00:57:39.370
<v Speaker 1>You forget the song.</v>

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.210
<v Speaker 2>It was to gain,</v>

2434
01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:20.300
<v Speaker 2>but yet those were the thoughts that were happening in my mind as I was</v>

2435
01:01:20.301 --> 01:01:21.260
<v Speaker 2>listening to this CD,</v>

2436

<v Speaker 8>I'll tell you what.</v>

2440
01:01:27.701 --> 01:01:31.990
<v Speaker 8>I didn't like that sexy song until I saw the video and I thought that's a fun.</v>

2441
01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:37.420
<v Speaker 9>Do you remember me saying I was in Vegas and I heard this stupid loop of hurting</v>

2442
01:01:39.611 --> 01:01:41.250
<v Speaker 9>them like seven songs.</v>

2444
01:01:44.161 --> 01:01:47.170
<v Speaker 9>a bit about how much I hated that and then I found out it was an elm.</v>

2445
01:01:47.171 --> 01:01:49.860
<v Speaker 9>Fao had that in like one of their main songs.</v>

2446
01:01:49.861 --> 01:01:52.520
<v Speaker 9>That was Afrojack that started that whole thing.</v>

2447
01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:53.251
<v Speaker 9>It was not them,</v>

2448
01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:53.941
<v Speaker 9>right originally.</v>

2449
01:01:53.941 --> 01:01:54.774
<v Speaker 9>Right,</v>

2450
01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:55.420

2456
01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:06.630
<v Speaker 9>K The first like notable phase was the Benny Benassi baseline.</v>

2457
01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:07.523
<v Speaker 9>Okay.</v>

01:02:28.171 --> 01:02:28.831
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't a cover.</v>

2477
01:02:28.831 --> 01:02:32.280
<v Speaker 7>It was a complete original and was like this robotic voices anyway,</v>

2478
01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:33.540
<v Speaker 7>breakout fucking track.</v>

2479
01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:35.100
<v Speaker 7>But it had the signature sound.</v>

2480
01:02:35.101 --> 01:02:36.360
<v Speaker 7>Now it's nothing new.</v>

2481
01:02:36.361 --> 01:02:38.220
<v Speaker 7>It wasn't this amazing breakout technology,</v>

2482
01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:43.110
<v Speaker 7>but it's like this just big thick meaty fuck off like a saw tooth wave that you</v>

2483
01:02:43.111 --> 01:02:43.411
<v Speaker 7>hear.</v>

2484
01:02:43.411 --> 01:02:43.820
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

2485
01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:44.091
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

2486
01:02:44.091 --> 01:02:46.110
<v Speaker 7>and he kind of like capitalized on that.</v>

2487
01:02:46.111 --> 01:02:47.400
<v Speaker 7>And that was a thing,</v>

2488
01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:47.941
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2489
01:02:47.941 --> 01:02:48.601
<v Speaker 7>for a while.</v>

2490
01:02:48.601 --> 01:02:50.910
<v Speaker 7>So a lot of other producers started fucking knocking it off.</v>

2491
01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:52.920
<v Speaker 7>And then what happened was,</v>

2492
01:02:52.921 --> 01:02:53.340
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2493
01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:57.290
<v Speaker 7>you had guys like Josh winks who kind of pioneered the uh,</v>

2494
01:02:57.690 --> 01:02:58.860
<v Speaker 7>the TB three Oh three.</v>

2495
01:02:58.861 --> 01:03:00.450
<v Speaker 7>Now this is like some old,</v>

2496
01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:00.901
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2497
01:03:00.901 --> 01:03:05.190
<v Speaker 7>Japanese baseline instrument that was supposed to be used as a base simulator.</v>

2498
01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:08.880
<v Speaker 7>And then buddy got the idea to crank the resonance on it and then,</v>

2499
01:03:08.881 --> 01:03:09.240
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2500
01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:09.571
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2501
01:03:09.571 --> 01:03:10.970
<v Speaker 7>use it as a sin.</v>

2502
01:03:11.090 --> 01:03:12.630
<v Speaker 7>So it did this doot Doo Dee Dee Dee Dee,</v>

2506
01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:16.820
<v Speaker 7>Then everyone started doing right.</v>

2507
01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:21.910
<v Speaker 7>So we were like the electronic music committee or committee group,</v>

2508
01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:23.250
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2509
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:25.320
<v Speaker 7>we're all susceptible to these kinds of fads.</v>

2510
01:03:25.321 --> 01:03:25.821
<v Speaker 7>That happens.</v>

2511
01:03:25.821 --> 01:03:29.280
<v Speaker 7>So now that's some good music history right there though right now.</v>

01:03:30.541 --> 01:03:34.740
<v Speaker 7>He comes out with taking like a piece of vocal and taking just the little</v>

2514
01:03:34.741 --> 01:03:39.630
<v Speaker 7>sustain little bit of it and go in that era and then everyone starts fucking</v>

01:03:39.631 --> 01:03:39.961
<v Speaker 7>doing it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think people have different things.</v>

2602
01:06:21.851 --> 01:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>Some people like watching other people fuck.</v>

2603
01:06:23.601 --> 01:06:24.850
<v Speaker 1>And some people like watching porn,</v>

2604
01:06:24.851 --> 01:06:25.684
<v Speaker 1>pretending it's them,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that could be made.</v>

2610
01:06:28.211 --> 01:06:29.044
<v Speaker 1>That could be made.</v>

2611
01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:30.333
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2612
01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:32.740
<v Speaker 1>some people like it's like,</v>

2613
01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:34.690
<v Speaker 1>like a being as a person,</v>

2614
01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:35.800
<v Speaker 1>being the person,</v>

2615
01:06:35.801 --> 01:06:37.360
<v Speaker 1>like actually just beating off,</v>

2616
01:06:37.361 --> 01:06:37.991
<v Speaker 1>watching people.</v>

2617
01:06:37.991 --> 01:06:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

2618
01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:40.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like two totally different mindsets for me.</v>

2619
01:06:40.361 --> 01:06:42.160
<v Speaker 1>It's just looking at the naked girl.</v>

2620
01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:43.691
<v Speaker 1>That's for me.</v>

2621
01:06:43.691 --> 01:06:44.380
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

2622
01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:45.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I'm looking at that.</v>

2623
01:06:45.671 --> 01:06:46.504
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at the leg,</v>

2624
01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:47.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2627
01:06:49.781 --> 01:06:52.270
<v Speaker 1>But I have to put myself in a completely different mindset.</v>

2628
01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:53.440
<v Speaker 1>If it's a black guy,</v>

2629

2810
01:12:04.291 --> 01:12:06.570
<v Speaker 3>They brought in Hollywood guys and I was thinking,</v>

2820
01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:19.020
<v Speaker 3>It's terrifying thinking that they restrict dubbing my shit right now with me</v>

2821
01:12:19.021 --> 01:12:19.854
<v Speaker 3>hours.</v>

2853
01:13:18.990 --> 01:13:19.460
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

2854
01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:20.293
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

2855
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:22.041
<v Speaker 3>you would think,</v>

2856
01:13:22.041 --> 01:13:26.270
<v Speaker 3>but 28 high school kids got arrested recently because they hired cops to pretend</v>

2857
01:13:26.271 --> 01:13:27.830
<v Speaker 3>to be undercover.</v>

2858
01:13:27.831 --> 01:13:29.390
<v Speaker 3>They pretend to be high school kids.</v>

2859
01:13:29.410 --> 01:13:30.920
<v Speaker 3>It was like 21 fucking jump street,</v>

2860
01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:33.220
<v Speaker 3>but just hanging around or try and push it.</v>

01:13:33.230 --> 01:13:34.040
<v Speaker 3>Trying to buy weed.</v>

2864
01:13:41.031 --> 01:13:43.850
<v Speaker 3>You would think that they would use the resources wisely,</v>

2865
01:13:43.970 --> 01:13:46.580
<v Speaker 3>but if they could get you for sexual exposure outside,</v>

2866
01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:46.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2867
01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:47.750
<v Speaker 3>especially by the way,</v>

2868
01:13:47.751 --> 01:13:49.040
<v Speaker 3>if you're anywhere near a school,</v>

2869
01:13:49.190 --> 01:13:51.440
<v Speaker 3>if you were within a certain amount of yards of a school,</v>

2870
01:13:51.441 --> 01:13:53.390
<v Speaker 3>even that's all of a sudden you're a sexual predator.</v>

01:14:09.641 --> 01:14:10.301
<v Speaker 1>There's no bathroom.</v>

2880
01:14:10.301 --> 01:14:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Women will just piss on wall.</v>

2881
01:14:11.370 --> 01:14:11.590

2889
01:14:23.651 --> 01:14:24.880
<v Speaker 1>like don't piss the nearest school.</v>

2890
01:14:24.881 --> 01:14:26.560
<v Speaker 1>What's really crazy is when you get</v>

2891
01:14:28.690 --> 01:14:32.220
<v Speaker 1>fucking branded really tome pies.</v>

2892
01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Cool,</v>

2893
01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:33.370
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2894
01:14:33.370 --> 01:14:36.310
<v Speaker 1>we should be rebels and tonight and just go PA school just to do it.</v>

2895
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing it do,</v>

2896
01:14:37.901 --> 01:14:39.370
<v Speaker 1>especially after we talked about on the Internet.</v>

2897
01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:41.650
<v Speaker 1>The government is going to know they're gonna have the droves out.</v>

2898
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:43.810
<v Speaker 1>By the time they're telling you that there's drones,</v>

2899
01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:47.810
<v Speaker 1>there's fucking dirty bin drones here to be placed on this on a daily base.</v>

2900
01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Damn it.</v>

2901
01:14:49.890 --> 01:14:50.431
<v Speaker 1>What is it called?</v>

2902
01:14:50.431 --> 01:14:52.210
<v Speaker 1>The time they talk about cloning,</v>

2903
01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.880
<v Speaker 1>while we're going to try calling the guy telling you is probably a clone.</v>

2904
01:14:54.910 --> 01:14:56.140
<v Speaker 1>There've been clawing forever.</v>

2905
01:14:56.170 --> 01:14:59.320
<v Speaker 1>There's no way they're going to tell you the common person when they're ready to</v>

2906
01:14:59.321 --> 01:14:59.951
<v Speaker 1>clone people.</v>

2907
01:14:59.951 --> 01:15:00.220
<v Speaker 1>They'll,</v>

2908
01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:02.530
<v Speaker 1>they'll make all sorts of experiments before we let people know.</v>

2909
01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:04.720
<v Speaker 1>They probably already have.</v>

2910
01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:05.613
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2911
01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:10.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean if they thought that they could make an army of psychotic fucking robot</v>

2912
01:15:10.901 --> 01:15:14.750
<v Speaker 1>flesh people if they thought they could clone you and take out all your morality</v>

2913
01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:18.463
<v Speaker 1>was the</v>

2914
01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:20.653
<v Speaker 1>first attempt,</v>

2915
01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:22.510
<v Speaker 1>how much money would they make?</v>

2916
01:15:22.511 --> 01:15:26.830
<v Speaker 1>If they just call it hot bitches and they just fucking sell flood the market,</v>

2917
01:15:26.831 --> 01:15:27.664
<v Speaker 1>we can't do that.</v>

2918
01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:28.503
<v Speaker 1>The real money,</v>

2919
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:30.130
<v Speaker 1>then it'd be different.</v>

2920
01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Didn't the ugly peer personally valued money would really be and killing them</v>

2921
01:15:34.721 --> 01:15:38.530
<v Speaker 1>off and getting a small number of them like pearls.</v>

2922
01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Would that be true if they,</v>

2923
01:15:39.701 --> 01:15:41.050
<v Speaker 1>if they cloned all hot,</v>

2924
01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:41.761
<v Speaker 1>like hot grow,</v>

2925
01:15:41.761 --> 01:15:45.040
<v Speaker 1>so it was like hot girl was more than ugly girl with the ugly girl.</v>

2926
01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Be The hot girl.</v>

2927
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Actually she would because she would rent that one.</v>

2928
01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:52.650
<v Speaker 1>She'd be a lower collectible.</v>

2929
01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:57.800
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] got this limited bucking edition one offs and smells.</v>

2930
01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.060
<v Speaker 1>It's Swartz and Eggers nanny</v>

2931
01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:04.000
<v Speaker 1>for line addition.</v>

2932
01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:05.140
<v Speaker 1>They did it in Sweden.</v>

2933
01:16:05.710 --> 01:16:09.610
<v Speaker 1>That's where the slug in the ditch came from is I have an overdub of a him</v>

2934
01:16:09.611 --> 01:16:09.940
<v Speaker 1>Chang,</v>

2935
01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:14.250
<v Speaker 1>you son of a bitch and say you're slugging a ditch and the whole thing was off</v>

2936
01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:15.610
<v Speaker 1>and that was Arnold.</v>

2937
01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:18.160
<v Speaker 2>What was I saying?</v>

2938
01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:18.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2939
01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:19.413
<v Speaker 2>Cloning.</v>

2940
01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:22.280
<v Speaker 1>We're running into each other a lot here.</v>

2941
01:16:22.281 --> 01:16:23.114
<v Speaker 1>They don't have enough time.</v>

2942
01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:24.440
<v Speaker 1>But when you,</v>

2943
01:16:24.441 --> 01:16:27.610
<v Speaker 1>when you get marijuana and alcohol together in one row and everybody saw that</v>

2944
01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:28.453
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2945
01:16:28.490 --> 01:16:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Arnold Schwarzenegger's voice.</v>

2946
01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2947
01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:30.901
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

2948
01:16:30.901 --> 01:16:31.820
<v Speaker 1>that was an interjection.</v>

2949
01:16:31.821 --> 01:16:32.720
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't in the discussion.</v>

2950
01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:34.140
<v Speaker 2>I forgot.</v>

2951
01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:35.580
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about cloning hot chicks.</v>

2952
01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:36.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2953
01:16:36.181 --> 01:16:37.920
<v Speaker 2>well I will say that Sweden,</v>

2954
01:16:37.950 --> 01:16:38.780
<v Speaker 2>they did that.</v>

2955
01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:39.730
<v Speaker 2>Why do you gen x?</v>

2956
01:16:39.810 --> 01:16:41.580
<v Speaker 2>They actually let,</v>

2957
01:16:41.670 --> 01:16:44.990
<v Speaker 2>they would for 30 40 50 years.</v>

2958
01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:47.130
<v Speaker 2>This is where the Nazis got all their shit in Sweden.</v>

2959
01:16:47.131 --> 01:16:50.640
<v Speaker 2>That's why all the hot chicks come from Sweden and good looking dudes too.</v>

2960
01:16:50.641 --> 01:16:51.540
<v Speaker 2>If you'd like that shit.</v>

2961
01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:53.190
<v Speaker 2>They all come from Sweden,</v>

2962
01:16:53.310 --> 01:16:54.143
<v Speaker 1>Swedish house.</v>

2963
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:57.210
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of hot chicks from all over the world,</v>

2964
01:16:57.211 --> 01:16:57.480
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>

2965
01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:58.141
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying.</v>

2966
01:16:58.141 --> 01:16:58.974
<v Speaker 1>There's a large,</v>

2967
01:16:59.700 --> 01:16:59.800
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2968
01:16:59.800 --> 01:16:59.970
<v Speaker 1>this</v>

2969
01:16:59.970 --> 01:17:04.780
<v Speaker 2>was Sweden was all about what's best for the country and they thought that based</v>

2970
01:17:04.781 --> 01:17:06.400
<v Speaker 2>on the symmetry of your face,</v>

2971
01:17:06.490 --> 01:17:07.810
<v Speaker 2>whether you're or not,</v>

2972
01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:08.890
<v Speaker 2>they should reproduce.</v>

2973
01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:10.250
<v Speaker 2>So if you had a baby,</v>

2974
01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:12.470
<v Speaker 2>they will look at the baby and they would analyze it.</v>

2975
01:17:12.471 --> 01:17:15.590
<v Speaker 2>Scientists make sure everything is 300 and take it to the clinic.</v>

2976
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:20.270
<v Speaker 2>They would sterilize the baby if she wasn't perfect symmetry.</v>

2977
01:17:20.690 --> 01:17:21.740
<v Speaker 2>When did this happen?</v>

2978
01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:22.880
<v Speaker 2>This is real shit.</v>

2979
01:17:22.881 --> 01:17:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Eugenics.</v>

2980
01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:25.760
<v Speaker 2>This is where the Nazis got all their shit from Sweden,</v>

2981
01:17:25.761 --> 01:17:26.060
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2982
01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:27.470
<v Speaker 2>this look into it son.</v>

2983
01:17:27.471 --> 01:17:28.304
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

2984
01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.000
<v Speaker 2>That's why all the good looking people like you go to,</v>

2985
01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:32.750
<v Speaker 2>how long are they engineer this for?</v>

2986
01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:36.620
<v Speaker 2>It was something like it was part of their country.</v>

2987
01:17:36.621 --> 01:17:41.621
<v Speaker 2>They convince the entire nation that the country was above you personally.</v>

2988
01:17:42.711 --> 01:17:43.850
<v Speaker 2>So when you had a baby,</v>

2989
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:47.690
<v Speaker 2>the scientists analyze the baby and if it was perfect,</v>

2990
01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:49.790
<v Speaker 2>they would let it breed.</v>

2991
01:17:49.810 --> 01:17:52.040
<v Speaker 2>Someone's writing some script as we speak.</v>

2992
01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:52.340
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

2993
01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:53.280
<v Speaker 2>you've never heard of this.</v>

2994
01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:54.200
<v Speaker 2>This is real.</v>

2995
01:17:54.201 --> 01:17:55.034
<v Speaker 2>They really,</v>

2996
01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:57.230
<v Speaker 2>this is good.</v>

2997
01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:58.153
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2998
01:17:58.280 --> 01:17:59.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean I got a lot of free time,</v>

2999
01:17:59.511 --> 01:18:00.890
<v Speaker 2>but man in Sweden,</v>

3000
01:18:00.891 --> 01:18:02.000
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of good looking people.</v>

3001
01:18:02.001 --> 01:18:02.310
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

3002
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:05.460
<v Speaker 2>I've been there like three times and every five minutes here,</v>

3003
01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:09.290
<v Speaker 2>five years or every five minutes.</v>

3004
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:11.780
<v Speaker 2>That was the timing that I thought because everywhere I would look,</v>

3005
01:18:11.781 --> 01:18:12.050
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

3006
01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:14.210
<v Speaker 2>I was going to try and explain it to my friends.</v>

3007
01:18:14.211 --> 01:18:14.481
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3008
01:18:14.481 --> 01:18:15.650
<v Speaker 2>the only way you can explain it,</v>

3009
01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:19.360
<v Speaker 2>I want to average every five minutes to see a supermodel.</v>

3010
01:18:19.370 --> 01:18:20.030
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

3011
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:22.470
<v Speaker 2>it's you go to Mcdonald's at all.</v>

3012
01:18:22.490 --> 01:18:23.100
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

3013
01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:27.510
<v Speaker 4>Sweden's government said on Wednesday that it had commissioned a study into why</v>

3014
01:18:27.511 --> 01:18:32.310
<v Speaker 4>eugenics was involved in the country in the 19th and 20th centuries leading to</v>

3015
01:18:32.311 --> 01:18:35.700
<v Speaker 4>tens of thousands being sterilized by force.</v>

3016
01:18:35.730 --> 01:18:39.390
<v Speaker 4>I told Jermaine sterilize being a euphemistic term for just</v>

3017
01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:40.473
<v Speaker 2>killing it,</v>

3018
01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:41.373
<v Speaker 2>sterilized,</v>

3019
01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:42.813
<v Speaker 2>sterilized.</v>

3020
01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:45.690
<v Speaker 2>They have a clip your balls man and the bolt on your</v>

3021
01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:48.133
<v Speaker 2>ovaries.</v>

3022
01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:53.350
<v Speaker 2>Think about why they did it based on the shape of your face.</v>

3023
01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:57.820
<v Speaker 2>They thought based on the symmetry of your face that like you had good genes,</v>

3024
01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:01.600
<v Speaker 2>you are ugly,</v>

3025
01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:02.740
<v Speaker 2>you are not producing.</v>

3026
01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:03.970
<v Speaker 2>That's the way it was</v>

3027
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.741
<v Speaker 4>incredible.</v>

3028
01:19:04.741 --> 01:19:05.161
<v Speaker 4>Listen to this.</v>

3029
01:19:05.161 --> 01:19:09.000
<v Speaker 4>A fundamental aim is to find out what the society that had developed this</v>

3030
01:19:09.001 --> 01:19:11.130
<v Speaker 4>eugenics mentality and established,</v>

3031
01:19:11.150 --> 01:19:13.590
<v Speaker 4>accepted scientific research in the area,</v>

3032
01:19:13.591 --> 01:19:16.560
<v Speaker 4>look like the Swedish minister and above blah,</v>

3033
01:19:16.570 --> 01:19:16.700
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

3034
01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:16.861
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>

3035
01:19:16.861 --> 01:19:17.700
<v Speaker 4>Said in a statement,</v>

3036
01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:20.580
<v Speaker 4>and this is the social philosophy of Eugenics,</v>

3037
01:19:20.581 --> 01:19:24.390
<v Speaker 4>which advocates the improvement of human hereditary traits through social</v>

3038
01:19:24.391 --> 01:19:28.980
<v Speaker 4>intervention developed in Sweden and elsewhere in Europe during the 18 hundreds</v>

3039
01:19:28.981 --> 01:19:32.850
<v Speaker 4>before becoming the basis for widespread racial policies in the 20th century.</v>

3040
01:19:32.851 --> 01:19:34.330
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking incredible.</v>

3041
01:19:34.331 --> 01:19:37.710
<v Speaker 4>So that's why most extreme form is [inaudible] is so good looking,</v>

3042
01:19:37.711 --> 01:19:37.890
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3043
01:19:37.890 --> 01:19:38.311
<v Speaker 4>Well that's,</v>

3044
01:19:38.311 --> 01:19:38.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3045
01:19:38.730 --> 01:19:41.700
<v Speaker 4>the were the worst thing anyone has ever said was Hitler had a great idea,</v>

3046
01:19:41.701 --> 01:19:42.690
<v Speaker 4>but it just took it too far.</v>

3047
01:19:42.810 --> 01:19:44.180
<v Speaker 4>It's like the worst thing that anybody ever said.</v>

3048
01:19:44.181 --> 01:19:44.460
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

3049
01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:44.790
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3050
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:45.571
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the things we,</v>

3051
01:19:45.571 --> 01:19:45.871
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>

3052
01:19:45.871 --> 01:19:46.071
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

3053
01:19:46.071 --> 01:19:46.301
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

3054
01:19:46.301 --> 01:19:46.381
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

3055
01:19:46.381 --> 01:19:48.530
<v Speaker 4>You can't fucking say it can't even,</v>

3056
01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:50.340
<v Speaker 4>you can't accept any of his ideas.</v>

3057
01:19:50.341 --> 01:19:51.270
<v Speaker 4>It's Hitler.</v>

3058
01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:53.250
<v Speaker 4>But this is what they're saying.</v>

3059
01:19:53.251 --> 01:19:57.240
<v Speaker 4>They're saying like this idea that human beings had to realize that people live</v>

3060
01:19:57.241 --> 01:20:00.570
<v Speaker 4>and people die and the right way to move the species forward is to get the</v>

3061
01:20:00.571 --> 01:20:01.050
<v Speaker 4>basketball.</v>

3062
01:20:01.050 --> 01:20:04.500
<v Speaker 4>You have to remember at the time when that was employed to the,</v>

3063
01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:05.490
<v Speaker 4>the ignorance</v>

3064
01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:08.160
<v Speaker 2>they'd be going around and there wasn't</v>

3065
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.690
<v Speaker 3>the communication available.</v>

3066
01:20:09.691 --> 01:20:09.961
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3067
01:20:09.961 --> 01:20:10.141
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3068
01:20:10.141 --> 01:20:13.170
<v Speaker 3>the Internet and the politics were obviously way up for fucking scoop.</v>

3069
01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.330
<v Speaker 3>They don't understand is the right and they're wrong.</v>

3070
01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:16.670
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time they're there,</v>

3071
01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:18.450
<v Speaker 3>right as a mathematical program.</v>

3072
01:20:18.451 --> 01:20:20.040
<v Speaker 3>They're wrong as a species.</v>

3073
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:20.940
<v Speaker 3>The species,</v>

3074
01:20:20.970 --> 01:20:23.460
<v Speaker 3>the marriage should be to whatever the,</v>

3075
01:20:23.461 --> 01:20:25.350
<v Speaker 3>the rest of the species fines,</v>

3076
01:20:25.530 --> 01:20:25.861
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3077
01:20:25.861 --> 01:20:28.020
<v Speaker 3>a attractive fines would.</v>

3078
01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:29.580
<v Speaker 3>They're drawn to whatever they like,</v>

3079
01:20:29.581 --> 01:20:30.180
<v Speaker 3>whatever the,</v>

3080
01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:32.460
<v Speaker 3>whether it's blonde hair and blue eyes,</v>

3081
01:20:32.461 --> 01:20:34.370
<v Speaker 3>whatever the area is we're doing or one of the very,</v>

3082
01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:37.610
<v Speaker 3>very few species that even fucking take that into consideration.</v>

3083
01:20:37.650 --> 01:20:38.210
<v Speaker 3>Whereas,</v>

3084
01:20:38.210 --> 01:20:38.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3085
01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:40.190
<v Speaker 3>other species in the animal fucking kingdom,</v>

3086
01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:41.053
<v Speaker 3>we just let it,</v>

3087
01:20:41.190 --> 01:20:41.940
<v Speaker 3>let it go.</v>

3088
01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:42.151
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3089
01:20:42.151 --> 01:20:42.511
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3090
01:20:42.511 --> 01:20:42.751
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

3091
01:20:42.751 --> 01:20:43.231
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3092
01:20:43.231 --> 01:20:44.760
<v Speaker 3>The idea that we want to engineer it,</v>

3093
01:20:44.761 --> 01:20:45.594
<v Speaker 3>it's nonsense.</v>

3094
01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:45.931
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3095
01:20:45.931 --> 01:20:48.870
<v Speaker 3>to me it's a massive form of control freak is.</v>

3096
01:20:48.871 --> 01:20:49.320
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3097
01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:50.730
<v Speaker 3>but it's based on science.</v>

3098
01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:54.810
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to make like the genetically the perfect species.</v>

3099
01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:57.300
<v Speaker 3>But I say that's ridiculous cause it's not about that.</v>

3100
01:20:57.450 --> 01:20:57.901
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

3101
01:20:57.901 --> 01:20:59.880
<v Speaker 3>it's not about like what looks the best,</v>

3102
01:20:59.881 --> 01:21:01.200
<v Speaker 3>what's the most sexually attracted?</v>

3103
01:21:01.201 --> 01:21:01.530
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

3104
01:21:01.530 --> 01:21:02.363
<v Speaker 3>what has the best,</v>

3105
01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:04.290
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it is about the brain.</v>

3106
01:21:04.291 --> 01:21:08.850
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it is about the mind and the mind's reaction to all the experiences of</v>

3107
01:21:08.851 --> 01:21:12.210
<v Speaker 3>life and how the mind develops and the mind of a,</v>

3108
01:21:12.211 --> 01:21:13.320
<v Speaker 3>a Geek,</v>

3109
01:21:13.530 --> 01:21:13.921
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3110
01:21:13.921 --> 01:21:16.100
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to engineer all the geeks out engineer?</v>

3111
01:21:16.770 --> 01:21:19.160
<v Speaker 3>Y'All fucking inherit the Earth Day.</v>

3112
01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:20.130
<v Speaker 3>But they're there.</v>

3113
01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:20.910
<v Speaker 3>They're on,</v>

3114
01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:22.560
<v Speaker 3>they're on the computer level.</v>

3115
01:21:22.590 --> 01:21:22.820
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

3116
01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:23.031
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

3117
01:21:23.031 --> 01:21:23.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3118
01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:23.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3119
01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:25.020
<v Speaker 3>attacking in the mental form.</v>

3120
01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:28.710
<v Speaker 3>The idea that you've got to eliminate the most progressive aspect of society.</v>

3121
01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:33.860
<v Speaker 3>The people that are the people that are fluent in computer technology and</v>

3122
01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:38.940
<v Speaker 3>creating infrastructure that this whole fucking internet runs on the idea that</v>

3123
01:21:38.941 --> 01:21:40.200
<v Speaker 3>you're going to eliminate them.</v>

3124
01:21:40.201 --> 01:21:43.080
<v Speaker 3>It's this silly that's so short sighted.</v>

3125
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:44.183
<v Speaker 3>It's so stupid.</v>

3126
01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:46.110
<v Speaker 3>Be Like idiocracy.</v>

3127
01:21:46.111 --> 01:21:46.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3128
01:21:46.410 --> 01:21:46.891
<v Speaker 3>Well you've,</v>

3129
01:21:46.891 --> 01:21:47.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

3130
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:49.020
<v Speaker 3>you've engineered yourself into a corner.</v>

3131
01:21:49.021 --> 01:21:49.111
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

3132
01:21:49.111 --> 01:21:50.190
<v Speaker 3>you think that you,</v>

3133
01:21:50.191 --> 01:21:50.850
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

3134
01:21:50.850 --> 01:21:52.620
<v Speaker 3>because you're attracted to broad cheeks,</v>

3135
01:21:52.621 --> 01:21:53.760
<v Speaker 3>like that's what everybody needs.</v>

3136
01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:54.733
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

3137
01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:56.370
<v Speaker 3>If that was true of eugenics was true,</v>

3138
01:21:56.371 --> 01:21:58.650
<v Speaker 3>maybe on a physical sense is pure physical,</v>

3139
01:21:58.651 --> 01:21:59.484
<v Speaker 3>not emotional,</v>

3140
01:22:00.150 --> 01:22:03.070
<v Speaker 3>intellectual for a worker it would be good for sex work.</v>

3141
01:22:03.190 --> 01:22:04.170
<v Speaker 3>Do I get a piss break?</v>

3142
01:22:05.150 --> 01:22:06.900
<v Speaker 3>It would mean to go through that door.</v>

3143
01:22:06.901 --> 01:22:07.291
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

3144
01:22:07.291 --> 01:22:08.400
<v Speaker 3>the last door on the left.</v>

3145
01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:09.151
<v Speaker 3>Think about,</v>

3146
01:22:09.151 --> 01:22:11.190
<v Speaker 3>I like that you're still rocking the wallet chain.</v>

3147
01:22:11.191 --> 01:22:12.240
<v Speaker 3>Iraq one as well.</v>

01:22:13.531 --> 01:22:13.911
<v Speaker 3>but a lot,</v>

3151
01:22:13.911 --> 01:22:15.300
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes the worst steel.</v>

3152
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:16.040
<v Speaker 3>Nice man.</v>

3153
01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:17.370
<v Speaker 3>It's my girlfriend shitting in their,</v>

3154
01:22:17.371 --> 01:22:18.204
<v Speaker 3>just pee on her.</v>

3155
01:22:20.010 --> 01:22:20.843
<v Speaker 3>Now we're talking,</v>

3156
01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:21.481
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

3157
01:22:21.481 --> 01:22:23.940
<v Speaker 3>I got to talk about this because Eddie and I were talking about this on the way</v>

3158
01:22:23.941 --> 01:22:24.774
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>

3159
01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:25.100
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3160
01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:26.580
<v Speaker 3>there's an article on some Internet.</v>

3161
01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:27.450
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong?</v>

3162
01:22:27.450 --> 01:22:28.283
<v Speaker 3>Is she coming back then?</v>

3163
01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:29.841
<v Speaker 3>She's not really,</v>

3164
01:22:29.841 --> 01:22:30.661
<v Speaker 3>I think she's in the bathroom.</v>

3165
01:22:30.661 --> 01:22:31.370
<v Speaker 3>You should really in there.</v>

3166
01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:31.860
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

3167
01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:32.131
<v Speaker 3>Don't,</v>

3168
01:22:32.131 --> 01:22:32.430
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

3169
01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:33.263
<v Speaker 3>don't wait.</v>

3170
01:22:33.450 --> 01:22:33.900
<v Speaker 3>I'll wait.</v>

<v Speaker 7>do they try to have,</v>

3407
01:27:59.541 --> 01:28:00.740

3483
01:29:36.571 --> 01:29:37.404
<v Speaker 7>fucking bill.</v>

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:45.990
<v Speaker 7>it becomes your production and it's your crew and it's your production company.</v>

3488
01:29:45.991 --> 01:29:46.501

01:29:46.501 --> 01:29:47.011
<v Speaker 7>like I said,</v>

3490
01:29:47.011 --> 01:29:50.010
<v Speaker 7>the signing a deal with live nation was like the best thing I could have done</v>

3491
01:29:50.011 --> 01:29:51.490
<v Speaker 7>for myself because you know,</v>

3492
01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:56.780
<v Speaker 7>live nation is huge and I would help out with do concerts through them.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

3495
01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:58.321
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

3496
01:29:58.321 --> 01:29:58.900
<v Speaker 7>but then it no,</v>

3497
01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:00.300

3502
01:30:06.330 --> 01:30:08.250
<v Speaker 7>and then you can always walk into a show.</v>

3545
01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:08.580
<v Speaker 7>When you get into a situation like that,</v>

3554
01:31:15.811 --> 01:31:18.600
<v Speaker 7>this is what the kids want to hear sometimes it used to be,</v>

3555
01:31:18.630 --> 01:31:19.261
<v Speaker 7>you know what I mean?</v>

3556

01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:20.071
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3558
01:31:20.071 --> 01:31:20.401
<v Speaker 7>I Kinda,</v>

3559
01:31:20.401 --> 01:31:24.390
<v Speaker 7>I kinda made my own thing and that's obviously what they're buying in the first</v>

3560
01:31:24.391 --> 01:31:24.600
<v Speaker 7>place.</v>

3561
01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:26.190
<v Speaker 7>So they're never going to question you on that.</v>

3562
01:31:26.191 --> 01:31:26.541
<v Speaker 7>But it's,</v>

3563
01:31:26.541 --> 01:31:27.480
<v Speaker 7>it's usually,</v>

3564
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.530
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3565
01:31:28.530 --> 01:31:32.910
<v Speaker 7>just some kind of time constraint or something,</v>

3566
01:31:32.911 --> 01:31:33.151
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3567
01:31:33.151 --> 01:31:34.740
<v Speaker 7>where they get other acts too,</v>

3568
01:31:34.741 --> 01:31:34.981
<v Speaker 7>which,</v>

3569
01:31:34.981 --> 01:31:35.340
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3570
01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:36.173
<v Speaker 7>and like I said,</v>

3571
01:31:36.370 --> 01:31:36.641
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

3572
01:31:36.641 --> 01:31:38.150
<v Speaker 7>the funnier it,</v>

3573
01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:40.530
<v Speaker 7>the easier it gets is when you just say,</v>

3574
01:31:40.531 --> 01:31:41.040
<v Speaker 7>you know what?</v>

3575
01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:41.460
<v Speaker 7>Fuck it.</v>

3576
01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:41.760
<v Speaker 7>Let it,</v>

3577
01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:43.110
<v Speaker 7>let everyone do what they want.</v>

3578
01:31:43.111 --> 01:31:43.621
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>

3579
01:31:43.621 --> 01:31:48.150
<v Speaker 7>If fucking DJ super awesome wants to cut my set by 15 minutes and then,</v>

3580
01:31:48.210 --> 01:31:49.050
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3581
01:31:49.650 --> 01:31:50.550
<v Speaker 7>early in your career,</v>

3582
01:31:50.551 --> 01:31:51.930
<v Speaker 7>it's always a pissing contest.</v>

3583
01:31:51.931 --> 01:31:52.381
<v Speaker 7>And so it was like,</v>

3584
01:31:52.381 --> 01:31:52.591
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

3585
01:31:52.591 --> 01:31:52.771
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

3586
01:31:52.771 --> 01:31:53.341
<v Speaker 7>I'm not doing it.</v>

3587
01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:54.061
<v Speaker 7>If that's not having,</v>

3588
01:31:54.061 --> 01:31:54.960
<v Speaker 7>then I'm not going on.</v>

3589
01:31:54.961 --> 01:31:56.100
<v Speaker 7>If they cut me this much,</v>

3590
01:31:56.101 --> 01:31:56.940
<v Speaker 7>I'm not going on.</v>

3591
01:31:57.150 --> 01:31:58.200
<v Speaker 7>And then you see it a lot,</v>

3592
01:31:58.710 --> 01:31:59.201
<v Speaker 7>you know what mean?</v>

3593
01:31:59.201 --> 01:32:00.640
<v Speaker 7>But then you get to a point where I was like,</v>

3594
01:32:00.690 --> 01:32:01.060
<v Speaker 7>all right,</v>

3595
01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:01.870
<v Speaker 7>let them let them,</v>

3596
01:32:01.870 --> 01:32:02.111
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3597
01:32:02.111 --> 01:32:05.260
<v Speaker 7>because you can always explain this shit and,</v>

3598
01:32:05.261 --> 01:32:05.521
<v Speaker 7>and,</v>

3599
01:32:05.521 --> 01:32:07.900
<v Speaker 7>and one of the beautiful things I find with my,</v>

3600
01:32:07.930 --> 01:32:08.260
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3601
01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:11.830
<v Speaker 7>horde of fucking fans is that I can always just tell it how it is.</v>

3602
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:12.580
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>

3603
01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:14.200
<v Speaker 7>So then after you have the opportunity,</v>

3604
01:32:14.210 --> 01:32:15.340
<v Speaker 7>now I always,</v>

<v Speaker 7>you know what I mean?</v>

3608
01:32:18.521 --> 01:32:18.651
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

3609
01:32:18.651 --> 01:32:19.630
<v Speaker 7>and then if everyone says,</v>

3610
01:32:19.631 --> 01:32:20.230
<v Speaker 7>well dude,</v>

3611

3614
01:32:22.811 --> 01:32:23.680
<v Speaker 7>And then I can just say,</v>

3615
01:32:23.681 --> 01:32:25.420
<v Speaker 7>look like you can make a blog entry.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Absolutely.</v>

3617
01:32:25.841 --> 01:32:26.351
<v Speaker 7>Explaining yourself.</v>

3618
01:32:26.351 --> 01:32:29.030
<v Speaker 7>You don't have to wait for a reporter to kite and you don't kind of bull shit</v>

<v Speaker 7>well listen,</v>

3624

<v Speaker 7>I really apologize,</v>

3625
01:32:34.211 --> 01:32:36.550
<v Speaker 7>but it's because of this is why we couldn't do this.</v>

3626
01:32:37.130 --> 01:32:37.480
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>the same thing.</v>

3651
01:33:18.101 --> 01:33:22.210
<v Speaker 4>You have to listen to people until everybody's coming to see you and then you</v>

3652
01:33:22.211 --> 01:33:23.350
<v Speaker 4>don't have to listen to anybody anymore.</v>

3653
01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:24.753
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>

3716
01:34:50.251 --> 01:34:52.080
<v Speaker 4>have control of it because I don't want to sleep.</v>

3717
01:34:52.410 --> 01:34:55.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to rest on it and let it creep up on me and burn the house down.</v>

<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3721
01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:59.330
<v Speaker 4>the human mind's a fairy fucking tricky thing,</v>

3722
01:34:59.331 --> 01:34:59.571
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3723
01:34:59.571 --> 01:35:01.220
<v Speaker 4>It's gotta be kept on pointing,</v>

3724
01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:02.840

3727
01:35:04.821 --> 01:35:05.790
<v Speaker 4>that feeling of a,</v>

3728
01:35:05.810 --> 01:35:08.930
<v Speaker 4>it's a very frustrating feeling of having somebody else trying to influence what</v>

3729
01:35:08.931 --> 01:35:09.980
<v Speaker 4>the fuck you're trying to do.</v>

3730
01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:10.521
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3731
01:35:10.521 --> 01:35:10.941

3736
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.750
<v Speaker 4>a digital artist,</v>

3737
01:35:14.751 --> 01:35:15.680
<v Speaker 4>as a comedian,</v>

3738
01:35:15.681 --> 01:35:19.880
<v Speaker 4>I think as anything people want to define you and they have their own ideas and</v>

3739
01:35:19.881 --> 01:35:23.060
<v Speaker 4>the same thing that made you not be a good website designer and be like,</v>

3740
01:35:23.061 --> 01:35:23.320
<v Speaker 4>bitch,</v>

3743
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:26.480
<v Speaker 4>That's like your music,</v>

3744
01:35:26.481 --> 01:35:27.260
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3745
01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:29.060
<v Speaker 4>And that's how you have to be as a comedian too.</v>

3746
01:35:29.061 --> 01:35:30.860
<v Speaker 4>I think they're very much the same.</v>

3747
01:35:30.861 --> 01:35:31.161
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3748
01:35:31.161 --> 01:35:31.994
<v Speaker 4>in order to,</v>

3749
01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:34.490
<v Speaker 4>to really get your point across,</v>

3750
01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:34.770
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3751
01:35:34.770 --> 01:35:37.010
<v Speaker 4>you have to all have a solitary vision,</v>

3752
01:35:37.310 --> 01:35:38.143
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3753
01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:39.320
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a crew,</v>

3754
01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:39.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3755
01:35:39.710 --> 01:35:40.340
<v Speaker 4>as far as the,</v>

3756
01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:41.540
<v Speaker 4>what we hear from you</v>

3757
01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:42.813
<v Speaker 6>musically,</v>

3758
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.831
<v Speaker 6>musically,</v>

3759
01:35:44.831 --> 01:35:47.320
<v Speaker 6>I really liked to kind of just run the show there,</v>

3760
01:35:47.890 --> 01:35:52.000
<v Speaker 6>but I have a crew for the show who helped me with the visuals,</v>

3761
01:35:52.001 --> 01:35:52.631
<v Speaker 6>that technology,</v>

3762
01:35:52.631 --> 01:35:53.650
<v Speaker 6>the cube stuff,</v>

3763
01:35:53.651 --> 01:35:54.700

3764
01:35:55.390 --> 01:35:56.950
<v Speaker 6>everything and come up with everything.</v>

3765
01:35:56.951 --> 01:35:58.930
<v Speaker 6>And you record everything and produced musically.</v>

3766
01:35:58.931 --> 01:35:59.764
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

3767
01:35:59.770 --> 01:36:00.440
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

3768
01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:01.273
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3769
01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:01.541
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3770
01:36:01.541 --> 01:36:02.051
<v Speaker 6>it's fun,</v>

3771
01:36:02.051 --> 01:36:02.381
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3772
01:36:02.381 --> 01:36:02.651
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3773
01:36:02.651 --> 01:36:05.170
<v Speaker 6>and that's kind of what kind of got it all started for me.</v>

3774
01:36:05.171 --> 01:36:05.501
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3775
01:36:05.501 --> 01:36:05.651
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

3776
01:36:05.651 --> 01:36:07.390
<v Speaker 6>I didn't come out of the gate as a,</v>

3777
01:36:07.391 --> 01:36:07.691
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3778
01:36:07.691 --> 01:36:11.470
<v Speaker 6>the purveyor and awesome play button pusher of other people's wars stuff,</v>

3779
01:36:11.950 --> 01:36:14.050
<v Speaker 6>original music or sampled half and half.</v>

3780
01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:14.351
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3781
01:36:14.351 --> 01:36:15.020
<v Speaker 6>never sampled.</v>

3782
01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:15.853
<v Speaker 6>That's everything.</v>

3783
01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:16.271
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3784
01:36:16.271 --> 01:36:17.620
<v Speaker 6>I really like to do that.</v>

3785
01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:18.100
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3786
01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:19.150
<v Speaker 6>and just keep it that way.</v>

3787
01:36:19.151 --> 01:36:19.530
<v Speaker 6>Just,</v>

3788
01:36:19.530 --> 01:36:20.080
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3789
01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:21.220
<v Speaker 6>obviously for the whole like,</v>

3790
01:36:21.221 --> 01:36:21.401
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3791
01:36:21.401 --> 01:36:26.401
<v Speaker 6>we don't have to pay out fucking serious like sync fees or licensing or buying</v>

3792
01:36:27.401 --> 01:36:28.234
<v Speaker 6>the rights to,</v>

3793
01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:28.660
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3794
01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:31.990
<v Speaker 6>you'd make a derivative work of something that's already been done.</v>

3795
01:36:31.991 --> 01:36:34.090
<v Speaker 6>That's something I like really like to avoid.</v>

3796
01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:35.560
<v Speaker 6>So you've never sampled anything?</v>

3797
01:36:35.650 --> 01:36:36.300
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

3798
01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:36.880
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3799
01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:37.720
<v Speaker 6>I have actually.</v>

3800
01:36:37.721 --> 01:36:38.250
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

3801
01:36:38.250 --> 01:36:39.910
<v Speaker 6>I have sampled a couple things,</v>

3802
01:36:39.970 --> 01:36:40.180
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3803
01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:42.130
<v Speaker 6>but they were just like a little boutique tracks.</v>

3804
01:36:42.131 --> 01:36:44.020
<v Speaker 6>It never really went out and made it big.</v>

3805
01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:48.430
<v Speaker 6>Are there any samples that you've heard in your head that you wanted a sample</v>

3806
01:36:48.431 --> 01:36:48.851
<v Speaker 6>but you're like,</v>

3807
01:36:48.851 --> 01:36:49.121
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>

3808
01:36:49.121 --> 01:36:50.260
<v Speaker 6>it's too much of a headache to,</v>

3809
01:36:50.650 --> 01:36:50.860
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3810
01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:51.251
<v Speaker 6>it's never,</v>

3811
01:36:51.251 --> 01:36:52.720
<v Speaker 6>it's never a headache to do it.</v>

3812
01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:56.310
<v Speaker 6>It's easier to ask for forgiveness than it is permission.</v>

3813
01:36:56.930 --> 01:36:57.763
<v Speaker 6>Really.</v>

3814
01:36:57.790 --> 01:36:58.623
<v Speaker 6>What happened?</v>

3815
01:36:59.550 --> 01:37:00.660
<v Speaker 4>Business work explained this to me.</v>

3816
01:37:00.690 --> 01:37:00.781
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3817
01:37:00.781 --> 01:37:03.930
<v Speaker 4>what happens when like Mc Hammer makes it song like can't touch this.</v>

3818
01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:08.150
<v Speaker 6>Well Dan do as fucking directed.</v>

3819
01:37:08.151 --> 01:37:09.200
<v Speaker 6>You can't touch it.</v>

3820
01:37:11.900 --> 01:37:13.760
<v Speaker 6>That's like the ultimate anti sample right there.</v>

3821
01:37:13.761 --> 01:37:15.070
<v Speaker 6>He is at the mash ups.</v>

3822
01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:16.100
<v Speaker 6>Do you enjoy mash up?</v>

3823
01:37:16.110 --> 01:37:17.480
<v Speaker 6>Sold all the answer the question.</v>

3824
01:37:17.481 --> 01:37:17.871
<v Speaker 6>Hold on.</v>

3825
01:37:17.871 --> 01:37:18.070
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

3826
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:18.891
<v Speaker 6>What does that mean?</v>

3827
01:37:18.891 --> 01:37:19.641
<v Speaker 6>What happens there?</v>

3828
01:37:19.641 --> 01:37:20.474
<v Speaker 6>Who gets the money?</v>

3829
01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.930
<v Speaker 6>Who gets the money for MC Hammer remix?</v>

3830
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.360
<v Speaker 6>You can't touch this if I take,</v>

3831
01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:26.240
<v Speaker 6>you can't touch this and put this into dance track.</v>

3832
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.590
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3833
01:37:26.590 --> 01:37:27.380
<v Speaker 6>that's not what I'm saying.</v>

3834
01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:27.940
<v Speaker 6>What do you say touch.</v>

3835
01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:28.910
<v Speaker 6>This is Rick James.</v>

3836
01:37:28.911 --> 01:37:30.590
<v Speaker 6>It's she's super free.</v>

3837
01:37:30.650 --> 01:37:31.610
<v Speaker 6>Well he couldn't touch it.</v>

3838
01:37:31.970 --> 01:37:32.600
<v Speaker 6>Don't,</v>

3839
01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:32.781
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3840
01:37:32.781 --> 01:37:32.961
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3841
01:37:32.961 --> 01:37:33.200
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

3842
01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:36.490
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying that the track that is that Rick's Jane.</v>

3843
01:37:36.530 --> 01:37:38.210
<v Speaker 6>That's a Rick derivative work.</v>

3844
01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:38.901
<v Speaker 6>Completely.</v>

3845
01:37:38.901 --> 01:37:39.201
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3846
01:37:39.201 --> 01:37:40.430
<v Speaker 6>So how has that worked?</v>

3847
01:37:40.431 --> 01:37:41.750
<v Speaker 6>As James gets money,</v>

3848
01:37:42.130 --> 01:37:44.060
<v Speaker 6>there are some laws that would dictate,</v>

3849
01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:44.451
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3850
01:37:44.451 --> 01:37:49.400
<v Speaker 6>that it's a cover as opposed to a direct sampling of the recording.</v>

3851
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:52.940
<v Speaker 6>Now these laws are still not even close to,</v>

3852
01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:53.271
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3853
01:37:53.271 --> 01:37:54.320
<v Speaker 6>super defined.</v>

3854
01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:55.111
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3855
01:37:55.111 --> 01:37:56.280
<v Speaker 6>so it's always the case.</v>

3856
01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:58.170
<v Speaker 7>It's always a musicologist involved.</v>

3857
01:37:58.171 --> 01:38:01.440
<v Speaker 7>And especially with like vanilla ice is ice ice baby,</v>

3858
01:38:01.770 --> 01:38:03.120
<v Speaker 7>which was the other match.</v>

3859
01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:04.950
<v Speaker 7>His,</v>

3860
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:06.690
<v Speaker 7>his whole defense to all that was,</v>

3861
01:38:06.691 --> 01:38:11.040
<v Speaker 7>it's not Denon and then [inaudible] he was like,</v>

3862
01:38:11.041 --> 01:38:11.251
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

3863
01:38:11.251 --> 01:38:12.900
<v Speaker 7>it's Dannon and then,</v>

3864
01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:13.920
<v Speaker 7>and then,</v>

3865
01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:14.500
<v Speaker 7>and then,</v>

3866
01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:16.140
<v Speaker 7>and then I'm like,</v>

3867
01:38:16.141 --> 01:38:17.850
<v Speaker 7>wow.</v>

3868
01:38:18.710 --> 01:38:19.543
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3869
01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:20.161
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

3870
01:38:20.161 --> 01:38:22.200
<v Speaker 7>it said there are like certain things you can get away with.</v>

3871
01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:25.260
<v Speaker 7>It used to be like kind of like a general apply rule where you could say,</v>

3872
01:38:25.261 --> 01:38:25.591
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

3873
01:38:25.591 --> 01:38:26.424
<v Speaker 7>well then fine.</v>

3874
01:38:26.490 --> 01:38:30.330
<v Speaker 7>No more than three seconds should be the rule.</v>

3875
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:31.111
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>

3876
01:38:31.111 --> 01:38:31.460
<v Speaker 7>And then,</v>

3877
01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:35.040
<v Speaker 7>and then it's obviously changed because people can recreate the exact same thing</v>

3878
01:38:35.041 --> 01:38:36.570
<v Speaker 7>just as easily 10 say.</v>

3879
01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:38.010
<v Speaker 7>It's like the constant,</v>

3880
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.491
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3881
01:38:38.491 --> 01:38:38.971
<v Speaker 7>like that,</v>

3882
01:38:38.971 --> 01:38:39.301
<v Speaker 7>those,</v>

3883
01:38:39.301 --> 01:38:39.601
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

3884
01:38:39.601 --> 01:38:40.800
<v Speaker 7>those songs pissed me off.</v>

3885
01:38:40.801 --> 01:38:41.280
<v Speaker 7>That's like,</v>

3886
01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:44.070
<v Speaker 7>you're just making me think of like some cool old song.</v>

3887
01:38:44.071 --> 01:38:44.904
<v Speaker 7>But I used to like,</v>

3888
01:38:45.090 --> 01:38:46.650
<v Speaker 7>I would still just call it a remax.</v>

3889
01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:46.840
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3890
01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:47.341
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>

3891
01:38:47.341 --> 01:38:47.920
<v Speaker 7>It's a remix,</v>

3892
01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:48.540
<v Speaker 7>remake,</v>

3893
01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:49.141
<v Speaker 7>remix,</v>

3894
01:38:49.141 --> 01:38:49.801
<v Speaker 7>cover,</v>

3895
01:38:49.801 --> 01:38:50.431
<v Speaker 7>all that stuff.</v>

3896
01:38:50.431 --> 01:38:55.350
<v Speaker 7>I actually recently did a cover of a Radiohead Song Codex off,</v>

3897
01:38:55.351 --> 01:38:55.510
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3898
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:56.370
<v Speaker 7>the king of limbs.</v>

3899
01:38:56.670 --> 01:38:57.180
<v Speaker 7>Now,</v>

3900
01:38:57.180 --> 01:38:57.510
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3901
01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:59.130
<v Speaker 7>the way that I did that is,</v>

3902
01:38:59.131 --> 01:38:59.940
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3903
01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:00.271
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3904
01:39:00.271 --> 01:39:00.511
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

3905
01:39:00.511 --> 01:39:02.130
<v Speaker 7>I'm a huge Radiohead fan,</v>

3906
01:39:02.430 --> 01:39:07.430
<v Speaker 7>so I kind of took it as myself as an exercise to see if I could reproduce it as</v>

3907
01:39:08.311 --> 01:39:09.091
<v Speaker 7>close to as possible.</v>

3908
01:39:09.091 --> 01:39:12.600
<v Speaker 7>Minus obviously is fucking amazing vocal and I share it because I can't sing for</v>

3909
01:39:12.601 --> 01:39:13.434
<v Speaker 7>a fuck.</v>

3910
01:39:13.530 --> 01:39:14.100
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

3911
01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:14.610
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3912
01:39:14.610 --> 01:39:14.971
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3913
01:39:14.971 --> 01:39:18.060
<v Speaker 7>I remade his track and threw it up on soundcloud,</v>

3914
01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:18.720
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3915
01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:19.411
<v Speaker 7>just kind of like,</v>

3916
01:39:19.411 --> 01:39:19.740
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3917
01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:21.060
<v Speaker 7>with the huge disclaimer saying,</v>

3918
01:39:21.061 --> 01:39:21.301
<v Speaker 7>dude,</v>

3919
01:39:21.301 --> 01:39:21.811
<v Speaker 7>this is not,</v>

3920
01:39:21.811 --> 01:39:22.150
<v Speaker 7>there's,</v>

3921
01:39:22.150 --> 01:39:23.220
<v Speaker 7>this is not a remix.</v>

3922
01:39:23.970 --> 01:39:26.090
<v Speaker 7>And I hate to say it,</v>

3923
01:39:26.091 --> 01:39:28.380
<v Speaker 7>the whole thing as an artistic exercise and you know,</v>

3924
01:39:28.381 --> 01:39:30.120
<v Speaker 7>I don't plan on monitorizing off that.</v>

3925
01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:31.410
<v Speaker 7>If I actually had planned on anything,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Your rhythmic and I'm thinking about sweet dreams and it was queen.</v>

3963
01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3964
01:40:16.230 --> 01:40:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3965
01:40:16.450 --> 01:40:16.960
<v Speaker 1>It's a mate.</v>

3966
01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:18.580
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck gets the money for that though?</v>

3967
01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:19.733
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3968
01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:22.450
<v Speaker 1>They go to court over that quarter with it.</v>

3969
01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:24.480
<v Speaker 1>They probably got permission for the member.</v>

3970
01:40:24.490 --> 01:40:25.300
<v Speaker 1>The verve.</v>

3971
01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:27.130
<v Speaker 1>You remember that song is a bittersweet symphony.</v>

3972
01:40:27.210 --> 01:40:29.950
<v Speaker 1>I apparently they lost all their money to the rolling stones,</v>

3973
01:40:30.790 --> 01:40:32.410
<v Speaker 1>took the music without asking.</v>

3974
01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:37.710
<v Speaker 1>It's very acceptable to sample music and then just wrap over it.</v>

3975
01:40:37.930 --> 01:40:42.070
<v Speaker 1>But no one really is sampled music and song over it.</v>

3976
01:40:43.450 --> 01:40:44.440
<v Speaker 1>We're sampling shit.</v>

3977
01:40:44.590 --> 01:40:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they did?</v>

3978
01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:47.261
<v Speaker 1>They sampled it.</v>

3979
01:40:47.261 --> 01:40:49.150
<v Speaker 1>They just took the rolling stones music.</v>

3980
01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:50.180
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

3981
01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:51.013
<v Speaker 1>Either way.</v>

3982

<v Speaker 8>I knew that my seat was a flotation device.</v>

4222
01:47:16.050 --> 01:47:17.850
<v Speaker 8>Boat was hitting the rock sons.</v>

4223
01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:19.680
<v Speaker 8>There's no doubt about it.</v>

4224
01:47:19.681 --> 01:47:20.011
<v Speaker 8>Hey,</v>

4225
01:47:20.011 --> 01:47:20.671
<v Speaker 8>it is what it is.</v>

4226
01:47:20.671 --> 01:47:21.920
<v Speaker 8>But it all worked out great.</v>

4227
01:47:22.030 --> 01:47:22.440
<v Speaker 8>It works.</v>

4228
01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:23.251
<v Speaker 8>You're Russell Peters.</v>

4229
01:47:23.251 --> 01:47:23.850
<v Speaker 8>You went,</v>

4230
01:47:23.850 --> 01:47:26.340
<v Speaker 8>we're actually cooler now than we were when we were together.</v>

4231
01:47:26.370 --> 01:47:26.881
<v Speaker 8>That's beautiful.</v>

4232
01:47:26.881 --> 01:47:28.860
<v Speaker 8>She'd probably love you now that you should respect you,</v>

4233
01:47:28.861 --> 01:47:30.030
<v Speaker 8>that you got away from her bullshit.</v>

4234
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:31.250
<v Speaker 8>She girls,</v>

4235
01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:33.240
<v Speaker 8>girls need that.</v>

4236
01:47:33.241 --> 01:47:35.670
<v Speaker 8>And then when they're in a situation where you cannot ever leave,</v>

4237
01:47:35.671 --> 01:47:36.660
<v Speaker 8>like we have a child together,</v>

4238
01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:38.690
<v Speaker 8>there's girls that abused guys because they're,</v>

4239
01:47:38.691 --> 01:47:41.370
<v Speaker 8>they're constantly in this psychological drama,</v>

4240
01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:44.130
<v Speaker 8>this see saw battle of putting guys on the defensive.</v>

4241
01:47:44.220 --> 01:47:46.590
<v Speaker 8>So the guy proves that he's a man.</v>

4242
01:47:46.591 --> 01:47:49.890
<v Speaker 8>Like I dated a girl that I always wanted to fight and I was like,</v>

4243
01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:51.210
<v Speaker 8>I can't do this anymore.</v>

4244
01:47:51.330 --> 01:47:55.010
<v Speaker 8>She left and then she started dating some other dude and did the same goddamn</v>

4245
01:47:55.020 --> 01:47:57.390
<v Speaker 8>thing and then I had a call center and then you,</v>

4246
01:47:57.391 --> 01:47:57.670
<v Speaker 8>right,</v>

4247
01:47:57.670 --> 01:47:58.201
<v Speaker 8>exactly.</v>

4248
01:47:58.201 --> 01:47:58.621
<v Speaker 8>But I mean,</v>

4249
01:47:58.621 --> 01:47:59.161
<v Speaker 8>as a person,</v>

4250
01:47:59.161 --> 01:48:00.330
<v Speaker 8>I liked her as a person.</v>

4251
01:48:00.331 --> 01:48:00.810
<v Speaker 8>I was like,</v>

4252
01:48:00.810 --> 01:48:01.770
<v Speaker 8>what do you think's going on?</v>

4253
01:48:01.771 --> 01:48:02.071
<v Speaker 8>She's like,</v>

4254
01:48:02.071 --> 01:48:02.970
<v Speaker 8>I can't help it.</v>

4255
01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.740
<v Speaker 8>I have to push a guy.</v>

4256
01:48:05.010 --> 01:48:05.341
<v Speaker 8>She goes,</v>

4257
01:48:05.341 --> 01:48:05.671
<v Speaker 8>it's like,</v>

4258
01:48:05.671 --> 01:48:06.271
<v Speaker 8>it's in me.</v>

4259
01:48:06.271 --> 01:48:06.961
<v Speaker 8>I don't know what it is.</v>

4260
01:48:06.961 --> 01:48:09.780
<v Speaker 8>I want to push them into a corner and I want to get him to tell me to shut the</v>

4261
01:48:09.781 --> 01:48:10.440
<v Speaker 8>fuck up.</v>

4262
01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:11.350
<v Speaker 8>I want to know the heel.</v>

4263
01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:12.780
<v Speaker 8>He's willing to walk away from me,</v>

4264
01:48:12.930 --> 01:48:14.070
<v Speaker 8>otherwise I can't respect him.</v>

4265
01:48:14.190 --> 01:48:14.551
<v Speaker 8>It's true.</v>

4266
01:48:14.551 --> 01:48:16.050
<v Speaker 8>You can't walk away when you have a kid.</v>

4267
01:48:16.051 --> 01:48:17.640
<v Speaker 8>When you get one of those crazy bitches pregnant,</v>

4268
01:48:17.790 --> 01:48:18.630
<v Speaker 8>that's what happens.</v>

4269
01:48:18.710 --> 01:48:22.290
<v Speaker 8>Or they're stuck in a goddamn circuit loop.</v>

4270
01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:26.250
<v Speaker 8>It turns out mine was only crazy because of the hormones from being pregnant and</v>

4271
01:48:26.251 --> 01:48:26.970
<v Speaker 8>postpartum.</v>

4272
01:48:26.970 --> 01:48:27.091

<v Speaker 6>they weren't called mashups.</v>

4466
01:53:05.010 --> 01:53:06.140
<v Speaker 6>They were just called mixes.</v>

4467
01:53:06.230 --> 01:53:06.920
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4468
01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:07.850
<v Speaker 6>It was like growing up.</v>

4469
01:53:07.851 --> 01:53:08.121
<v Speaker 6>You would,</v>

4470
01:53:08.121 --> 01:53:11.780
<v Speaker 6>you would take whatever fucking acapella record they had because it was hard to</v>

4471
01:53:11.781 --> 01:53:12.950
<v Speaker 6>get acapellas back then.</v>

4472
01:53:12.951 --> 01:53:14.420
<v Speaker 6>So if a record had an Acapella,</v>

4473
01:53:14.630 --> 01:53:17.900
<v Speaker 6>you would fuck with it with however many beats you could find that would match</v>

4474
01:53:17.901 --> 01:53:18.734
<v Speaker 6>that acapella.</v>

4475
01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:23.090
<v Speaker 6>Like I would play sweetheart by rainy Davis and I would find as many fucking</v>

4476
01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:25.820
<v Speaker 6>beats that would go with that with sweetheart back in the day.</v>

4477
01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:28.850
<v Speaker 6>Then you would try and change them as much as fast as you could.</v>

4478
01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:32.780
<v Speaker 6>And that was the challenge because you'd have to dig the record out and you</v>

4479
01:53:32.781 --> 01:53:34.490
<v Speaker 6>didn't have the fucking bpms in front of you.</v>

4480
01:53:34.491 --> 01:53:35.630
<v Speaker 6>There was no sink button.</v>

4481
01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:37.790
<v Speaker 6>It's too susceptible to train wrecking though.</v>

4482
01:53:37.791 --> 01:53:39.530
<v Speaker 6>That's the problem with mash ups.</v>

4483
01:53:39.531 --> 01:53:40.161
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

4484
01:53:40.161 --> 01:53:42.800
<v Speaker 6>You could totally just mash something up and it sounds like shit.</v>

4485
01:53:43.010 --> 01:53:45.410
<v Speaker 6>There's very few people have a perception of music.</v>

4486
01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:46.273
<v Speaker 6>The way he does it.</v>

4487
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:47.330
<v Speaker 6>It's almost creepy.</v>

4488
01:53:47.331 --> 01:53:49.220
<v Speaker 6>Like you have like a smell that I don't have.</v>

4489
01:53:49.250 --> 01:53:50.690
<v Speaker 6>I am a creepy music.</v>

4490
01:53:50.691 --> 01:53:52.220
<v Speaker 6>We played some music and he pulled,</v>

4491
01:53:52.221 --> 01:53:52.431
<v Speaker 6>he goes,</v>

4492
01:53:52.431 --> 01:53:52.551
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

4493
01:53:52.551 --> 01:53:53.960
<v Speaker 6>that's the salt and pepper in there.</v>

4494
01:53:53.961 --> 01:53:54.621
<v Speaker 6>The salt and pepper.</v>

4495
01:53:54.621 --> 01:53:55.190
<v Speaker 6>There's one,</v>

4496
01:53:55.190 --> 01:53:55.551
<v Speaker 6>and we were like,</v>

4497
01:53:55.551 --> 01:53:57.050
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

4498
01:53:58.180 --> 01:54:00.350
<v Speaker 6>Like a hundred times and break it down.</v>

4499
01:54:00.351 --> 01:54:00.830
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

4500
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:02.390
<v Speaker 6>stop this spot right here.</v>

4501
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:03.260
<v Speaker 6>And we're like,</v>

4502
01:54:03.260 --> 01:54:03.831
<v Speaker 6>oh yeah.</v>

4503
01:54:03.831 --> 01:54:04.670
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

4504
01:54:04.671 --> 01:54:05.750
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck?</v>

4505
01:54:05.930 --> 01:54:07.370
<v Speaker 6>How did you even pick that out man?</v>

4506
01:54:07.371 --> 01:54:09.110
<v Speaker 6>Like if you sample the snare and probably able to go,</v>

4507
01:54:09.111 --> 01:54:10.100
<v Speaker 6>I know where that snares wrong.</v>

4508
01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:10.760
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4509
01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:11.031
<v Speaker 6>he'll,</v>

4510
01:54:11.031 --> 01:54:12.440
<v Speaker 6>he'll write the song.</v>

4511
01:54:12.500 --> 01:54:14.030
<v Speaker 6>It's really bizarre,</v>

4512
01:54:14.031 --> 01:54:14.361
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

4513
01:54:14.361 --> 01:54:14.590
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

4514
01:54:14.590 --> 01:54:15.423
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

4515
01:54:15.450 --> 01:54:17.090
<v Speaker 6>it's still prevailing and music today,</v>

4516
01:54:17.091 --> 01:54:17.811
<v Speaker 6>even with the,</v>

4517
01:54:17.811 --> 01:54:20.150
<v Speaker 6>even the latest and greatest like electronic music,</v>

4518
01:54:20.151 --> 01:54:23.750
<v Speaker 6>cause you hear this one little sample or snare or something like that and it's</v>

4519
01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:25.070
<v Speaker 6>off another dude shit.</v>

4520
01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:26.293
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

4521
01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:29.990
<v Speaker 6>That's like kind of when I stopped fucking listening to music,</v>

4522
01:54:30.050 --> 01:54:30.380
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4523
01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:32.240
<v Speaker 6>because I find that I'm analyzing.</v>

4524
01:54:32.241 --> 01:54:33.560
<v Speaker 6>It's like where did he get that?</v>

4525
01:54:34.010 --> 01:54:37.730
<v Speaker 6>Where did he just enjoy his homeboy wasn't in the back fucking hitting the snare</v>

4526
01:54:37.731 --> 01:54:38.241
<v Speaker 6>on the mic,</v>

4527
01:54:38.241 --> 01:54:38.430
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4528
01:54:38.430 --> 01:54:39.350
<v Speaker 6>and they're all,</v>

4529
01:54:39.351 --> 01:54:40.160
<v Speaker 6>it's just,</v>

4530
01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:41.780
<v Speaker 6>just incestual ripping.</v>

4531
01:54:41.810 --> 01:54:42.643
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

4532
01:54:43.730 --> 01:54:45.440
<v Speaker 6>You could rip anything as long as it's good.</v>

4533
01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:46.273
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4534
01:54:46.670 --> 01:54:50.810
<v Speaker 6>To put together the melodies that are magical and resonate with the planet.</v>

4535
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.950
<v Speaker 6>That's the talent,</v>

4536
01:54:52.190 --> 01:54:52.770
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

4537
01:54:52.770 --> 01:54:54.620
<v Speaker 6>Rip it off whether you sample it,</v>

4538
01:54:54.850 --> 01:54:59.850
<v Speaker 6>can you put together this unique little piece of art it's going to resonate with</v>

4539
01:54:59.991 --> 01:55:00.321
<v Speaker 6>the world.</v>

4540

<v Speaker 8>It was horrible.</v>

4575
01:55:52.770 --> 01:55:53.130

01:55:54.870 --> 01:55:55.470
<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>

4580
01:55:55.470 --> 01:55:56.700
<v Speaker 8>son of a bitch.</v>

<v Speaker 8>it looks like I stole from my own fucking Pete.</v>

4585
01:56:04.180 --> 01:56:05.910
<v Speaker 8>The only thing you don't have to worry about with how he is,</v>

4586
01:56:05.911 --> 01:56:07.720
<v Speaker 8>he's not going to kick your ass cause you won't touch you.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 8>it's true.</v>

<v Speaker 8>He's terrified of touching p.</v>

4590

4597
01:56:18.601 --> 01:56:19.411
<v Speaker 8>You never have to worry about it.</v>

4598
01:56:19.411 --> 01:56:20.280
<v Speaker 8>I'm kicking your ass.</v>

4601
01:56:25.950 --> 01:56:26.783
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

4602
01:56:26.970 --> 01:56:28.480
<v Speaker 8>it's like watching a Dj right now.</v>

4603
01:56:28.481 --> 01:56:29.314

4678
01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:29.170
<v Speaker 9>No Xbox,</v>

01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:36.760
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>

4685
01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:38.110
<v Speaker 9>people are still charging,</v>

4686
01:58:38.111 --> 01:58:38.591
<v Speaker 9>charging,</v>

4687
01:58:38.591 --> 01:58:39.101
<v Speaker 9>charging,</v>

4688
01:58:39.101 --> 01:58:39.700
<v Speaker 9>charging.</v>

4689
01:58:39.700 --> 01:58:40.580
<v Speaker 9>And I told x box,</v>

4690
01:58:40.581 --> 01:58:41.260

01:58:41.260 --> 01:58:42.093

01:58:42.490 --> 01:58:43.700
<v Speaker 9>take my pay pal,</v>

4693
01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:44.401
<v Speaker 9>take my bees.</v>

4694
01:58:44.401 --> 01:58:48.070
<v Speaker 9>So take everything off my account and they won't do it.</v>

4695
01:58:48.090 --> 01:58:48.520
<v Speaker 9>Why?</v>

4696
01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:50.710
<v Speaker 9>Because they want to research who,</v>

4697
01:58:50.711 --> 01:58:52.000
<v Speaker 9>where the money's coming from.</v>

4698
01:58:52.001 --> 01:58:53.380
<v Speaker 9>So they're using my money.</v>

4699
01:58:53.790 --> 01:58:54.221
<v Speaker 9>They're using,</v>

4700
01:58:54.221 --> 01:58:56.920
<v Speaker 9>my research is going to reimburse you.</v>

4701
01:58:57.260 --> 01:58:58.390
<v Speaker 9>I'm sure they will,</v>

4702
01:58:58.391 --> 01:59:01.660
<v Speaker 9>but they're not going to reimburse all the bills that are bouncing right now.</v>

4703
01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:02.411
<v Speaker 9>Fuck you.</v>

4704
01:59:02.411 --> 01:59:03.244
<v Speaker 9>X Box.</v>

4705
01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:04.513
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4706
01:59:07.790 --> 01:59:08.630
<v Speaker 3>ran out of breath</v>

4707
01:59:10.060 --> 01:59:10.893
<v Speaker 9>playing your life.</v>

4708
01:59:10.940 --> 01:59:15.140
<v Speaker 9>You're really playing on the odds that one out of the 10 fucking Anon don't work</v>

4709
01:59:15.141 --> 01:59:15.590
<v Speaker 9>for fun.</v>

4710
01:59:15.590 --> 01:59:16.370
<v Speaker 9>I know,</v>

4711
01:59:16.370 --> 01:59:17.030
<v Speaker 9>I know.</v>

4712
01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:17.751
<v Speaker 9>That's risky.</v>

4713
01:59:17.751 --> 01:59:18.930
<v Speaker 9>I wouldn't double down on their,</v>

4714
01:59:18.931 --> 01:59:19.310
<v Speaker 9>hey,</v>

4715
01:59:19.310 --> 01:59:19.881
<v Speaker 9>you're right.</v>

4716
01:59:19.881 --> 01:59:20.151
<v Speaker 9>I know.</v>

4717
01:59:20.151 --> 01:59:20.840
<v Speaker 9>Exactly.</v>

4718
01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:23.010
<v Speaker 9>There's an inside job going on in Xbox.</v>

4719
01:59:23.180 --> 01:59:23.910
<v Speaker 9>I think so.</v>

4720
01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:25.050
<v Speaker 3>Do you think some of the incidents,</v>

4721
01:59:25.570 --> 01:59:26.403
<v Speaker 3>Jackie,</v>

4722
01:59:27.450 --> 01:59:29.490
<v Speaker 3>speaking of my ex's bucks,</v>

4723
01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:30.353
<v Speaker 3>she's moving.</v>

4724
01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:32.130
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4725
01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.260
<v Speaker 3>here's Russell Peters,</v>

4726
01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:35.370
<v Speaker 3>standup comedian.</v>

4727
01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:37.980
<v Speaker 3>Here's the beautiful thing about drunk.</v>

4728
01:59:37.981 --> 01:59:39.040
<v Speaker 3>What do you bond for?</v>

4729
01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:39.780
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

4730
01:59:39.780 --> 01:59:40.800
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want nothing else.</v>

4731
01:59:40.970 --> 01:59:41.501
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful thing.</v>

4732
01:59:41.501 --> 01:59:42.120
<v Speaker 3>You're perfect.</v>

4733
01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:42.780
<v Speaker 3>Don't change.</v>

4734
01:59:42.780 --> 01:59:46.020
<v Speaker 3>The beautiful thing about anonymous is that everything's anonymous.</v>

4735
01:59:46.050 --> 01:59:47.190
<v Speaker 3>It just like fight club.</v>

4736
01:59:47.191 --> 01:59:48.090
<v Speaker 3>There's the people weren't,</v>

4737
01:59:48.091 --> 01:59:48.450
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

4738
01:59:48.450 --> 01:59:49.600
<v Speaker 3>this kid's going to get arrested,</v>

4739
01:59:49.620 --> 01:59:51.890
<v Speaker 3>but we supposed to not to fucking talk about regionally.</v>

4740
01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:53.460
<v Speaker 3>Occasionally people were going to get arrested.</v>

4741
01:59:53.610 --> 01:59:56.520
<v Speaker 3>The beauty of anonymous is what it represents is the future of government.</v>

4742
01:59:56.760 --> 01:59:58.770
<v Speaker 3>That's what it represents is that the government is going to be,</v>

4743
01:59:59.650 --> 02:00:01.250
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be what,</v>

4744
02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:03.570
<v Speaker 3>10 [inaudible] who really knows security</v>

4745
02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:06.810
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>

4746
02:00:06.810 --> 02:00:08.610
<v Speaker 3>not what I'm saying now listen to what I'm saying.</v>

4747
02:00:08.730 --> 02:00:11.340
<v Speaker 3>It represents the will of the people when they're doing something,</v>

4748
02:00:11.341 --> 02:00:12.030
<v Speaker 3>when they're takedown,</v>

4749
02:00:12.030 --> 02:00:15.360
<v Speaker 3>they're taking down a government website because of the,</v>

4750
02:00:15.370 --> 02:00:17.250
<v Speaker 3>the National Defense Authorization Act.</v>

4751
02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:19.590
<v Speaker 3>What they're doing is they're essentially making a stand for the people.</v>

4752
02:00:19.591 --> 02:00:19.981
<v Speaker 3>They're saying,</v>

4753
02:00:19.981 --> 02:00:22.530
<v Speaker 3>listen to the internet does not like this.</v>

4754
02:00:22.650 --> 02:00:26.070
<v Speaker 3>And everyone usually gets behind it and then you see it's bills like Sopa get</v>

4755
02:00:26.071 --> 02:00:27.400
<v Speaker 3>taken down and you go,</v>

4756
02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:27.850
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

4757
02:00:27.850 --> 02:00:30.420
<v Speaker 3>You know the Internet has to say the Internet has to say,</v>

4758
02:00:30.510 --> 02:00:33.060
<v Speaker 3>and there's people that are extreme miss on the internet and that's what</v>

4759
02:00:33.061 --> 02:00:33.840
<v Speaker 3>anonymous is.</v>

4760
02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:36.480
<v Speaker 3>Did the craziest soldiers at the front of the line that are willing to do nutty</v>

4761
02:00:36.481 --> 02:00:39.250
<v Speaker 3>shit like tapped by the CIA website and they not?</v>

4762
02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:40.200
<v Speaker 3>They don't necessarily.</v>

4763
02:00:40.380 --> 02:00:40.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

4764
02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:41.221
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to be.</v>

4765
02:00:41.221 --> 02:00:41.791
<v Speaker 3>It could be three.</v>

4766
02:00:41.791 --> 02:00:46.440
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter what they represent as anonymous individuals are the will of</v>

4767
02:00:46.441 --> 02:00:47.640
<v Speaker 3>the entire group on the,</v>

4768
02:00:47.641 --> 02:00:48.390
<v Speaker 3>on the Internet.</v>

4769
02:00:48.390 --> 02:00:50.340
<v Speaker 3>They don't do shit that people hate.</v>

4770
02:00:50.520 --> 02:00:51.630
<v Speaker 3>They don't do anonymous,</v>

4771
02:00:51.631 --> 02:00:53.850
<v Speaker 3>has never doing shit that people are really mad at.</v>

4772
02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.280
<v Speaker 3>Now have you ever noticed they get creepy and they put,</v>

4773
02:00:56.370 --> 02:00:57.660
<v Speaker 3>you know they call themselves anonymous?</v>

4774
02:00:57.661 --> 02:00:57.850
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4775
02:00:57.850 --> 02:00:59.520
<v Speaker 3>people's personal information online.</v>

4776
02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:01.170
<v Speaker 3>That's some Douche bags.</v>

4777
02:01:01.470 --> 02:01:05.160
<v Speaker 3>But the reality of the ethics behind the group is that they're trying to take</v>

4778
02:01:05.161 --> 02:01:06.300
<v Speaker 3>down corruption.</v>

4779
02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:08.640
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to step in and stop shit.</v>

4780
02:01:08.700 --> 02:01:12.630
<v Speaker 3>They trying to do pickup where wikileaks got tripped up because there was a</v>

4781
02:01:12.631 --> 02:01:13.464
<v Speaker 3>public figure.</v>

4782
02:01:13.650 --> 02:01:13.891
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>

4783
02:01:13.891 --> 02:01:16.050
<v Speaker 9>But at what point do you think that,</v>

4784
02:01:16.090 --> 02:01:16.480
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

4785
02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:21.150
<v Speaker 9>they'll kind of curb that as not to become the dictators themselves.</v>

4786
02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:21.911
<v Speaker 3>Who is they?</v>

4787
02:01:21.911 --> 02:01:22.571
<v Speaker 3>That's the issue.</v>

4788
02:01:22.571 --> 02:01:23.660
<v Speaker 3>The issue is who is day?</v>

4789
02:01:24.340 --> 02:01:25.240
<v Speaker 3>Lauren is fine.</v>

4790
02:01:25.241 --> 02:01:28.660
<v Speaker 3>As long as there's no true organization and it really does represent the people,</v>

4791
02:01:28.661 --> 02:01:29.494
<v Speaker 3>then it'll be,</v>

4792
02:01:29.740 --> 02:01:31.480
<v Speaker 3>the internet would be truly democratic.</v>

4793
02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:35.140
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're saying they may become evil.</v>

4794
02:01:35.141 --> 02:01:37.000
<v Speaker 3>Right now they're doing everything for the px.</v>

4795
02:01:37.001 --> 02:01:37.370
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

4796
02:01:37.370 --> 02:01:37.640
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

4797
02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:38.270
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4798
02:01:38.270 --> 02:01:38.960
<v Speaker 3>Then all of a sudden,</v>

4799
02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:39.231
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4800
02:01:39.231 --> 02:01:39.711
<v Speaker 3>so fine,</v>

4801
02:01:39.711 --> 02:01:39.951
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

4802
02:01:39.951 --> 02:01:40.190
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

4803
02:01:40.190 --> 02:01:40.460
<v Speaker 10>let's,</v>

4804
02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:43.100
<v Speaker 10>let's take a non right and let's put them in power.</v>

4805
02:01:43.490 --> 02:01:43.820
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4806
02:01:43.820 --> 02:01:44.840
<v Speaker 3>well no one's saying that.</v>

4807
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:45.770
<v Speaker 3>The idea is</v>

4808
02:01:47.660 --> 02:01:49.640
<v Speaker 3>the idea is we've got to get to a certain point in time,</v>

4809
02:01:49.641 --> 02:01:51.350
<v Speaker 3>we realized it was a global government.</v>

4810
02:01:51.380 --> 02:01:53.270
<v Speaker 3>I think we should have anonymous is power.</v>

4811
02:01:53.271 --> 02:01:54.950
<v Speaker 3>We should have the Internet be power.</v>

4812
02:01:54.951 --> 02:01:56.630
<v Speaker 3>We should have voting online.</v>

4813
02:01:56.631 --> 02:01:58.150
<v Speaker 3>We should have everything the Internet is.</v>

4814
02:01:58.190 --> 02:01:59.023
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

4815
02:01:59.070 --> 02:01:59.331
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4816
02:01:59.331 --> 02:02:00.164
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

4817
02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:03.910
<v Speaker 3>so it only takes four fucking dudes to go and change it.</v>

4818
02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:04.941
<v Speaker 3>I get that.</v>

4819
02:02:04.941 --> 02:02:05.930
<v Speaker 3>I get through,</v>

4820
02:02:06.050 --> 02:02:07.640
<v Speaker 3>but who are those three or four dudes?</v>

4821
02:02:07.850 --> 02:02:11.300
<v Speaker 3>We got to eliminate the fact that there can ever be three or four dudes that</v>

4822
02:02:11.301 --> 02:02:12.710
<v Speaker 3>have access to any we have to kill.</v>

4823
02:02:12.711 --> 02:02:13.730
<v Speaker 3>The [inaudible] have to do,</v>

4824
02:02:13.731 --> 02:02:17.630
<v Speaker 3>they can never be three or four dudes that have access to anything.</v>

4825
02:02:17.631 --> 02:02:19.220
<v Speaker 3>It has to be all transparent.</v>

4826
02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:20.570
<v Speaker 3>Once it becomes transparent,</v>

4827
02:02:20.571 --> 02:02:21.440
<v Speaker 3>then he can't steal,</v>

4828
02:02:21.590 --> 02:02:22.400
<v Speaker 3>then he can't lie.</v>

4829
02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:23.240
<v Speaker 3>Then it'd be really simple.</v>

4830
02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:25.010
<v Speaker 3>Internet 2.0 you know what it is,</v>

4831
02:02:25.011 --> 02:02:25.370
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4832
02:02:25.370 --> 02:02:28.790
<v Speaker 3>We're all moving into a certain direction with is going to be no secrets.</v>

4833
02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:30.550
<v Speaker 3>I think really clear shall inherit.</v>

4834
02:02:31.390 --> 02:02:34.940
<v Speaker 3>The information is going to take over and all your ideas about,</v>

4835
02:02:34.941 --> 02:02:35.151
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

02:02:35.151 --> 02:02:37.160
<v Speaker 3>wanting to be wanting to have privacy.</v>

4837
02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:38.360
<v Speaker 3>All that bullshit is going to go.</v>

4838
02:02:38.361 --> 02:02:39.194
<v Speaker 3>Bye Bye son.</v>

4839
02:02:39.250 --> 02:02:40.100
<v Speaker 3>Cause he was going to be no.</v>

4840
02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:41.540
<v Speaker 3>Who's who's watching the,</v>

4841
02:02:41.690 --> 02:02:44.270
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be no one watching him and everyone's going to have access to</v>

4842
02:02:44.271 --> 02:02:44.690
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

4843
02:02:44.690 --> 02:02:47.330
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately it will be complete and total transparency.</v>

4844
02:02:47.450 --> 02:02:47.950
<v Speaker 3>Cheers Buddy.</v>

<v Speaker 10>None of it.</v>

4893
02:04:07.250 --> 02:04:09.620
<v Speaker 10>I question a lot of things like what?</v>

4894
02:04:09.650 --> 02:04:10.970
<v Speaker 10>Namely the moon landing.</v>

4895
02:04:10.971 --> 02:04:12.960
<v Speaker 10>I don't fucking trust one single bit.</v>

4896
02:04:13.470 --> 02:04:14.370
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

4897
02:04:14.420 --> 02:04:15.253
<v Speaker 10>Not One bit.</v>

4898
02:04:15.340 --> 02:04:16.940
<v Speaker 10>Trust that moon landing because,</v>

4899
02:04:17.300 --> 02:04:18.590
<v Speaker 10>because I met,</v>

4900
02:04:18.650 --> 02:04:19.200
<v Speaker 10>I told,</v>

4901
02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:20.660
<v Speaker 10>I think I said this once before and one of the,</v>

4902
02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:21.481
<v Speaker 10>one of the buckets,</v>

4903
02:04:21.481 --> 02:04:21.801
<v Speaker 10>you wait,</v>

4904
02:04:21.801 --> 02:04:22.011
<v Speaker 10>wait,</v>

4905
02:04:22.011 --> 02:04:22.161
<v Speaker 10>wait,</v>

4906
02:04:22.161 --> 02:04:22.400
<v Speaker 10>wait.</v>

4907
02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:22.620
<v Speaker 10>Well,</v>

4908
02:04:22.620 --> 02:04:22.751
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

4909
02:04:22.751 --> 02:04:22.821
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

4910
02:04:22.821 --> 02:04:22.941
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

4911
02:04:22.941 --> 02:04:23.061
<v Speaker 10>no.</v>

4912
02:04:23.061 --> 02:04:23.391
<v Speaker 10>Hold on.</v>

4913
02:04:23.391 --> 02:04:24.350
<v Speaker 10>Did you see,</v>

4914
02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:27.170
<v Speaker 10>hold on us emotionally upset and Neil Armstrong,</v>

4915
02:04:27.171 --> 02:04:27.650
<v Speaker 10>God,</v>

4916
02:04:27.650 --> 02:04:28.310
<v Speaker 10>stop right there.</v>

4917
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.461
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

4918
02:04:28.461 --> 02:04:30.520
<v Speaker 10>but if you going to work enough,</v>

4919
02:04:30.610 --> 02:04:33.140
<v Speaker 10>Joe is going to work is if you're saying we were talking about something,</v>

4920
02:04:33.141 --> 02:04:33.974
<v Speaker 10>it's like,</v>

4921
02:04:34.270 --> 02:04:34.580
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

4922
02:04:34.580 --> 02:04:36.050
<v Speaker 10>he's not a Dj and he got upset.</v>

4923
02:04:36.051 --> 02:04:36.261
<v Speaker 10>I'd be like,</v>

4924
02:04:36.261 --> 02:04:36.711
<v Speaker 10>motherfucker,</v>

4925
02:04:36.711 --> 02:04:37.560
<v Speaker 10>you're not DJ.</v>

4926
02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:39.720
<v Speaker 10>You're put in a mix tape and you got aids.</v>

4927
02:04:39.910 --> 02:04:40.610
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

4928
02:04:40.610 --> 02:04:41.780
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4929
02:04:42.050 --> 02:04:43.680
<v Speaker 3>he hit him with the aides</v>

4930
02:04:45.450 --> 02:04:45.730
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

4931
02:04:45.730 --> 02:04:47.900
<v Speaker 3>hey listen,</v>

4932
02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:49.191
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing.</v>

4933
02:04:49.191 --> 02:04:50.390
<v Speaker 3>Whenever someone says something,</v>

4934
02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:51.310
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

4935
02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:52.490
<v Speaker 3>Make lemonade.</v>

4936
02:04:52.491 --> 02:04:56.030
<v Speaker 3>If someone says something as crazy as the moon landing didn't happen,</v>

4937
02:04:56.031 --> 02:04:58.790
<v Speaker 3>you got to let them talk without interrupting with some fucking emotional shit</v>

4938
02:04:58.791 --> 02:05:00.150
<v Speaker 3>about neurons here.</v>

4939
02:05:00.220 --> 02:05:01.053
<v Speaker 3>Gotta let him talk.</v>

4940
02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:06.030
<v Speaker 10>I have reasons for this now because I wanted to believe that we went to the moon</v>

4941
02:05:06.031 --> 02:05:09.480
<v Speaker 10>because I'm a big nerd for space shit.</v>

4942
02:05:09.481 --> 02:05:11.910
<v Speaker 10>And like watch all the Hubble footage and the,</v>

4943
02:05:12.230 --> 02:05:13.840
<v Speaker 10>and all the shit they send out.</v>

4944
02:05:14.050 --> 02:05:17.400
<v Speaker 10>And it excites me to think that there's other shit out there.</v>

4945
02:05:17.850 --> 02:05:19.980
<v Speaker 10>And when you look at the space race,</v>

4946
02:05:19.981 --> 02:05:20.814
<v Speaker 10>first of all,</v>

4947
02:05:20.910 --> 02:05:25.350
<v Speaker 10>it was against Russia at that time and they were trying to beat somebody to</v>

4948
02:05:25.351 --> 02:05:26.160
<v Speaker 10>somewhere,</v>

4949
02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:26.993
<v Speaker 10>right,</v>

4950
02:05:27.170 --> 02:05:27.570
<v Speaker 10>right.</v>

4951
02:05:27.570 --> 02:05:28.403
<v Speaker 10>It was a random,</v>

4952
02:05:28.530 --> 02:05:28.801
<v Speaker 10>right.</v>

4953
02:05:28.801 --> 02:05:29.970
<v Speaker 10>It was exactly a race.</v>

4954
02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:34.590
<v Speaker 10>And then I met this two Indian kids after one of my shows in Houston.</v>

4955
02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:35.400
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>

4956
02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:36.150
<v Speaker 10>they were,</v>

4957
02:05:36.150 --> 02:05:36.540
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

4958
02:05:36.540 --> 02:05:38.230
<v Speaker 10>they were basically rocket scientists.</v>

4959
02:05:38.231 --> 02:05:39.990
<v Speaker 10>They were studying astrophysicist,</v>

4960
02:05:41.060 --> 02:05:42.590
<v Speaker 3>even the people who study,</v>

4961
02:05:42.591 --> 02:05:43.370
<v Speaker 3>they were shredding them.</v>

4962
02:05:43.370 --> 02:05:44.203
<v Speaker 3>They were cutting those two</v>

4963
02:05:44.230 --> 02:05:44.501
<v Speaker 10>people.</v>

4964
02:05:44.501 --> 02:05:45.010
<v Speaker 10>They were,</v>

4965
02:05:45.010 --> 02:05:46.790
<v Speaker 10>they were astrophysicist is what they were.</v>

4966
02:05:46.791 --> 02:05:47.210
<v Speaker 10>And,</v>

4967
02:05:47.210 --> 02:05:47.801
<v Speaker 10>and I was,</v>

4968
02:05:47.801 --> 02:05:49.540
<v Speaker 10>and I had a watch on that I had bought,</v>

4969
02:05:49.541 --> 02:05:51.240
<v Speaker 10>because I'm a fucking donkey I,</v>

4970
02:05:51.241 --> 02:05:51.851
<v Speaker 10>and not this one,</v>

4971
02:05:51.851 --> 02:05:53.050
<v Speaker 10>but I had a watch on that.</v>

4972
02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:53.861
<v Speaker 10>Allegedly,</v>

4973
02:05:53.861 --> 02:05:55.960
<v Speaker 10>the face of the watch was made of moon rock.</v>

4974
02:05:56.250 --> 02:05:56.721
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

4975
02:05:56.721 --> 02:06:00.010
<v Speaker 10>And it was a limited piece and all kinds of horse float and must be if it's only</v>

4976
02:06:00.011 --> 02:06:00.880
<v Speaker 10>fucking from the moon,</v>

4977
02:06:00.881 --> 02:06:01.110
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

4978
02:06:01.110 --> 02:06:03.580
<v Speaker 10>Well until your crumb one basically.</v>

4979
02:06:03.581 --> 02:06:05.140
<v Speaker 10>And then they smudged it and whatever.</v>

4980
02:06:05.410 --> 02:06:05.741
<v Speaker 10>Anyway,</v>

4981
02:06:05.741 --> 02:06:06.221
<v Speaker 10>so I was like,</v>

4982
02:06:06.221 --> 02:06:06.581
<v Speaker 10>Hey,</v>

4983
02:06:06.581 --> 02:06:06.791
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

4984
02:06:06.791 --> 02:06:08.950
<v Speaker 10>so have we been to the moon in this chick was like,</v>

4985
02:06:08.980 --> 02:06:11.140
<v Speaker 10>no reason to lie to me whatsoever.</v>

4986
02:06:11.650 --> 02:06:12.250
<v Speaker 10>And she was like,</v>

4987
02:06:12.250 --> 02:06:12.761
<v Speaker 10>they said,</v>

4988
02:06:12.761 --> 02:06:13.300
<v Speaker 10>we have.</v>

4989
02:06:13.300 --> 02:06:13.781
<v Speaker 10>And I'm like,</v>

4990
02:06:13.781 --> 02:06:14.614
<v Speaker 10>what does that mean?</v>

4991
02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:15.491
<v Speaker 10>And she goes,</v>

4992
02:06:15.491 --> 02:06:15.911
<v Speaker 10>they said,</v>

4993
02:06:15.911 --> 02:06:16.301
<v Speaker 10>we have.</v>

4994
02:06:16.301 --> 02:06:16.601
<v Speaker 10>And I go,</v>

4995
02:06:16.601 --> 02:06:16.720
<v Speaker 10>wait,</v>

4996
02:06:16.720 --> 02:06:17.500
<v Speaker 10>I don't know what that means.</v>

4997
02:06:17.500 --> 02:06:18.041
<v Speaker 10>They said,</v>

4998
02:06:18.041 --> 02:06:18.874
<v Speaker 10>we have accents.</v>

4999
02:06:18.910 --> 02:06:19.331
<v Speaker 10>I go,</v>

5000
02:06:19.331 --> 02:06:21.070
<v Speaker 10>is it possible that we've been to the moon?</v>

5001
02:06:21.071 --> 02:06:21.291
<v Speaker 10>She goes,</v>

5002
02:06:21.291 --> 02:06:22.800
<v Speaker 10>it's not possible that we've been to the manic.</v>

5003
02:06:22.810 --> 02:06:23.800
<v Speaker 10>What do you mean it's not possible?</v>

5004
02:06:23.801 --> 02:06:24.634
<v Speaker 10>She goes,</v>

5005
02:06:25.150 --> 02:06:26.890
<v Speaker 10>it's impossible to go to the moon.</v>

5006
02:06:26.920 --> 02:06:29.590
<v Speaker 10>That because we can't get past the radiation belt,</v>

5007
02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:30.101
<v Speaker 10>the radiate,</v>

5008
02:06:30.101 --> 02:06:34.720
<v Speaker 10>we can't build a suit that will protect humans from that radiation without their</v>

5009
02:06:34.721 --> 02:06:36.760
<v Speaker 10>skin falling off the radiation on the moon?</v>

5010
02:06:36.850 --> 02:06:37.121
<v Speaker 10>No,</v>

5011
02:06:37.121 --> 02:06:39.130
<v Speaker 10>the van Allen Radiation Belt between,</v>

5012
02:06:39.131 --> 02:06:39.761
<v Speaker 10>between,</v>

5013
02:06:39.761 --> 02:06:40.930
<v Speaker 10>between the moon and that.</v>

5014
02:06:41.210 --> 02:06:42.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm no radiation,</v>

5015
02:06:43.020 --> 02:06:43.930
<v Speaker 3>no radiation to expert.</v>

5016
02:06:44.110 --> 02:06:48.220
<v Speaker 3>But I've heard it argued that you never pass through the belt and in fact the</v>

5017
02:06:48.221 --> 02:06:51.530
<v Speaker 3>belt is like a donut and there's a hole in the center and if you pass through</v>

5018
02:06:51.540 --> 02:06:52.373
<v Speaker 3>you can do that.</v>

5019
02:06:52.420 --> 02:06:53.260
<v Speaker 3>My issue with it,</v>

5020
02:06:53.290 --> 02:06:53.561
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

5021
02:06:53.561 --> 02:06:56.530
<v Speaker 3>my number one issue is that they never did anything to test.</v>

5022
02:06:56.770 --> 02:06:59.800
<v Speaker 3>They never even sent a chicken in this space and see if it comes back alive.</v>

5023
02:06:59.950 --> 02:07:00.271
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5024
02:07:00.271 --> 02:07:00.601
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5025
02:07:00.601 --> 02:07:00.791
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

5026
02:07:00.791 --> 02:07:02.950
<v Speaker 3>Monkeys went into space and then land the Russian.</v>

5027
02:07:03.340 --> 02:07:03.760
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

5028
02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:04.571
<v Speaker 3>no one knew.</v>

5029
02:07:04.571 --> 02:07:07.750
<v Speaker 3>Like there was like extreme radiation out there and in fact there's a thing</v>

5030
02:07:07.751 --> 02:07:11.590
<v Speaker 3>called the operation starfish prime where they actually detonated a nuclear bomb</v>

5031
02:07:11.830 --> 02:07:15.340
<v Speaker 3>in the magnetosphere because they were trying to punch a hole through it and it</v>

5032
02:07:15.341 --> 02:07:18.460
<v Speaker 3>made it like they made it way more radioactive.</v>

5033
02:07:18.461 --> 02:07:19.171
<v Speaker 3>Like they made the,</v>

5034
02:07:19.171 --> 02:07:20.830
<v Speaker 3>the van Allen radiation belts,</v>

5035
02:07:20.831 --> 02:07:21.760
<v Speaker 3>like more charts.</v>

5036
02:07:21.940 --> 02:07:22.780
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean they still,</v>

5037
02:07:22.781 --> 02:07:23.321
<v Speaker 3>if there was a,</v>

5038
02:07:23.321 --> 02:07:24.460
<v Speaker 3>if it is a donut shape,</v>

5039
02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:26.410
<v Speaker 3>apparently you can like fly through it,</v>

5040
02:07:26.411 --> 02:07:30.190
<v Speaker 3>but I would've liked to have seen someone do it and you know all like a monkey</v>

5041
02:07:30.191 --> 02:07:32.150
<v Speaker 3>or something that said it.</v>

5042
02:07:32.370 --> 02:07:34.720
<v Speaker 3>There's slingshot around the fucking wound,</v>

5043
02:07:34.990 --> 02:07:35.621
<v Speaker 6>there's all that.</v>

5044
02:07:35.621 --> 02:07:36.081
<v Speaker 6>And then the Gr,</v>

5045
02:07:36.081 --> 02:07:37.180
<v Speaker 6>I had my iPhone in my hand,</v>

5046
02:07:37.181 --> 02:07:37.810
<v Speaker 6>she goes,</v>

5047
02:07:37.810 --> 02:07:41.470
<v Speaker 6>your iPhone has more technology and then the entire room and NASA did back then.</v>

5048
02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:42.071
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

5049
02:07:42.071 --> 02:07:45.160
<v Speaker 4>But that doesn't mean that they couldn't make ample calculations.</v>

5050
02:07:45.190 --> 02:07:47.080
<v Speaker 4>Even though even though your iPhone,</v>

5051
02:07:47.210 --> 02:07:48.220
<v Speaker 4>your iPhone is doing,</v>

5052
02:07:48.221 --> 02:07:51.340
<v Speaker 4>is interacting with a graphic user interfaces,</v>

5053
02:07:51.341 --> 02:07:53.710
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of processing going around.</v>

5054
02:07:53.830 --> 02:07:54.191
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

5055
02:07:54.191 --> 02:07:54.461
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5056
02:07:54.461 --> 02:07:55.121
<v Speaker 4>there's signals,</v>

5057
02:07:55.121 --> 02:07:55.811
<v Speaker 4>it's picking up,</v>

5058
02:07:55.811 --> 02:07:57.250
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of shit going on with that.</v>

5059
02:07:57.490 --> 02:07:58.750
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have to do all that.</v>

5060
02:07:58.780 --> 02:07:58.901
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

5061
02:07:58.901 --> 02:08:00.100
<v Speaker 4>all they had was numbers,</v>

5062
02:08:00.220 --> 02:08:00.401
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5063
02:08:00.401 --> 02:08:02.820
<v Speaker 6>Well there was the number so they can physically calculated.</v>

5064
02:08:03.190 --> 02:08:04.023
<v Speaker 6>However,</v>

5065
02:08:04.450 --> 02:08:08.650
<v Speaker 6>all the equipment they had during the space launch was the equivalent of that of</v>

5066
02:08:08.651 --> 02:08:09.330
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

5067
02:08:09.330 --> 02:08:13.240
<v Speaker 6>like one 16th of an iPhone in the whole facility.</v>

5068
02:08:13.270 --> 02:08:14.051
<v Speaker 6>Not even that.</v>

5069
02:08:14.051 --> 02:08:14.860
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't even that.</v>

5070
02:08:14.860 --> 02:08:15.491
<v Speaker 6>By the way,</v>

5071
02:08:15.491 --> 02:08:16.061
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't matter.</v>

5072
02:08:16.061 --> 02:08:19.360
<v Speaker 6>They still could have done it because they did do it without people for sure.</v>

5073
02:08:19.361 --> 02:08:19.531
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

5074
02:08:19.531 --> 02:08:19.780
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

5075
02:08:19.780 --> 02:08:20.710
<v Speaker 6>So you know what I'm saying?</v>

5076
02:08:20.711 --> 02:08:23.020
<v Speaker 6>The calculations are not that different space.</v>

5077
02:08:23.080 --> 02:08:24.070
<v Speaker 6>You just can't send huge,</v>

5078
02:08:24.150 --> 02:08:24.580
<v Speaker 6>well that's,</v>

5079
02:08:24.580 --> 02:08:25.170
<v Speaker 6>that's the</v>

5080
02:08:25.170 --> 02:08:27.560
<v Speaker 4>question is there's really been no evidence they would ever,</v>

5081
02:08:27.590 --> 02:08:30.920
<v Speaker 4>they were able to take biological life into space and return it.</v>

5082
02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:33.830
<v Speaker 4>There's been no evidence of that and there has been evidence that they really</v>

5083
02:08:33.831 --> 02:08:37.550
<v Speaker 4>absolutely cannot predict solar flares and all kinds of crazy shit that happens.</v>

5084
02:08:37.820 --> 02:08:38.960
<v Speaker 4>Storms flare up.</v>

5085
02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:39.271
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5086
02:08:39.271 --> 02:08:41.220
<v Speaker 6>They may spark then predict.</v>

5087
02:08:41.370 --> 02:08:43.830
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people believe that people did land on the moon,</v>

5088
02:08:43.860 --> 02:08:44.760
<v Speaker 4>but that the,</v>

5089
02:08:44.930 --> 02:08:48.180
<v Speaker 4>they faked a lot of the footage and one of the reasons for that is they did fake</v>

5090
02:08:48.181 --> 02:08:49.500
<v Speaker 4>a lot of footage at NASA.</v>

5091
02:08:49.650 --> 02:08:52.650
<v Speaker 4>Like there was some footage from Gemini missions where they were practice</v>

5092
02:08:52.740 --> 02:08:54.030
<v Speaker 4>clearly the same images,</v>

5093
02:08:54.031 --> 02:08:56.820
<v Speaker 4>exact same images in practice pictures,</v>

5094
02:08:56.940 --> 02:08:57.121
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5095
02:08:57.121 --> 02:09:00.270
<v Speaker 4>where they're like wearing suits and hung by wires and then they black those</v>

5096
02:09:00.271 --> 02:09:01.051
<v Speaker 4>pictures out.</v>

5097
02:09:01.051 --> 02:09:02.670
<v Speaker 4>The publicity people did and said,</v>

5098
02:09:02.671 --> 02:09:04.020
<v Speaker 4>and these people don't know any better,</v>

5099
02:09:04.070 --> 02:09:04.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5100
02:09:04.270 --> 02:09:06.750
<v Speaker 4>was a a time of really extreme ignorance.</v>

5101
02:09:06.900 --> 02:09:07.111
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5102
02:09:07.111 --> 02:09:08.820
<v Speaker 4>people didn't have access to information.</v>

5103
02:09:08.970 --> 02:09:12.260
<v Speaker 4>And so there's photos of 'em Collins and uh,</v>

5104
02:09:12.300 --> 02:09:15.480
<v Speaker 4>Michael Collins and he's a on this and one of the Gemini missions.</v>

5105
02:09:15.630 --> 02:09:16.500
<v Speaker 4>He's on this fucking a,</v>

5106
02:09:16.620 --> 02:09:19.920
<v Speaker 4>it looks like he's in deep space with the exact same photo,</v>

5107
02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:21.660
<v Speaker 4>is him out of practice,</v>

5108
02:09:21.661 --> 02:09:23.900
<v Speaker 4>run hanging by wires and it's just date.</v>

5109
02:09:24.190 --> 02:09:25.740
<v Speaker 4>Someone got overzealous and they said,</v>

5110
02:09:25.741 --> 02:09:25.921
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

5111
02:09:25.921 --> 02:09:26.970
<v Speaker 4>here's a perfect picture.</v>

5112
02:09:26.971 --> 02:09:27.601
<v Speaker 4>Why ruin it?</v>

5113
02:09:27.601 --> 02:09:28.650
<v Speaker 4>Let's just put it in space.</v>

5114
02:09:28.860 --> 02:09:29.611
<v Speaker 4>Tell people was there,</v>

5115
02:09:29.611 --> 02:09:31.290
<v Speaker 4>it's not like the guy didn't go to space.</v>

5116
02:09:31.380 --> 02:09:32.370
<v Speaker 4>He absolutely did.</v>

5117
02:09:32.480 --> 02:09:32.671
<v Speaker 4>Just,</v>

5118
02:09:32.671 --> 02:09:35.220
<v Speaker 4>they might not have been able to take such good fucking pictures up there,</v>

5119
02:09:35.370 --> 02:09:35.671
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

5120
02:09:35.671 --> 02:09:37.800
<v Speaker 4>And so they faked a lot of shit.</v>

5121
02:09:37.801 --> 02:09:42.510
<v Speaker 4>And so that makes the whole thing fuzzy because you look at it and you go psalms</v>

5122
02:09:42.511 --> 02:09:43.141
<v Speaker 4>wrong man,</v>

5123
02:09:43.141 --> 02:09:43.741
<v Speaker 4>something's wrong.</v>

5124
02:09:43.741 --> 02:09:44.700
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is wrong?</v>

5125
02:09:44.701 --> 02:09:45.840
<v Speaker 4>There's some shit here that's wrong.</v>

5126
02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:49.680
<v Speaker 4>The reason why is I think a bunch of the shit we're looking at probably was</v>

5127
02:09:49.681 --> 02:09:50.910
<v Speaker 4>taking place in a studio.</v>

5128
02:09:51.060 --> 02:09:53.090
<v Speaker 4>A lot of the photographs are probably horseshit.</v>

5129
02:09:53.220 --> 02:09:54.360
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean they didn't go.</v>

5130
02:09:54.600 --> 02:09:59.500
<v Speaker 6>I don't mean to leave like derail and debunk the whole fucking thing,</v>

5131
02:09:59.501 --> 02:10:02.910
<v Speaker 6>but do you did with it?</v>

5132
02:10:02.930 --> 02:10:06.820
<v Speaker 6>They did or whether they didn't really matter.</v>

5133
02:10:06.970 --> 02:10:07.620
<v Speaker 6>It does.</v>

5134
02:10:07.620 --> 02:10:08.453
<v Speaker 6>It's fast.</v>

5135
02:10:09.290 --> 02:10:10.520
<v Speaker 6>It absolutely Madison has.</v>

5136
02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:11.010
<v Speaker 6>I want to</v>

5137
02:10:11.010 --> 02:10:13.740
<v Speaker 4>find out if it's possible to pull off a hoax of that magnitude.</v>

5138
02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:14.221
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5139
02:10:14.221 --> 02:10:17.040
<v Speaker 4>if you look about what the United States had been capable of doing as far as</v>

5140
02:10:17.041 --> 02:10:19.810
<v Speaker 4>like getting us into wars under false pretenses,</v>

5141
02:10:20.210 --> 02:10:20.761
<v Speaker 4>corruption,</v>

5142
02:10:20.761 --> 02:10:21.510
<v Speaker 4>all the bullshit,</v>

5143
02:10:21.510 --> 02:10:24.120
<v Speaker 4>you wonder how far it is possible to take it.</v>

5144
02:10:24.180 --> 02:10:27.070
<v Speaker 4>We know it's possible to create war gag doubly.</v>

5145
02:10:27.090 --> 02:10:27.331
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

5146
02:10:27.331 --> 02:10:28.230
<v Speaker 4>we got brains.</v>

5147
02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:31.200
<v Speaker 4>Arguably that's way crazier than putting someone on the moon.</v>

5148
02:10:31.590 --> 02:10:32.423
<v Speaker 4>Arguably,</v>

5149
02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:33.240
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5150
02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:34.160
<v Speaker 4>letting people,</v>

5151
02:10:34.340 --> 02:10:35.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5152
02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:39.500
<v Speaker 3>figuring out how to trick a gigantic chunk of people to go into another part of</v>

5153
02:10:39.501 --> 02:10:42.350
<v Speaker 3>the world and kill people for you seems to be,</v>

5154
02:10:42.351 --> 02:10:43.520
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to fake that,</v>

5155
02:10:43.521 --> 02:10:45.000
<v Speaker 3>you're going to fake an operation to get into that.</v>

5156
02:10:45.001 --> 02:10:46.400
<v Speaker 3>You're going to bullshit your way into that.</v>

5157
02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:48.140
<v Speaker 3>That seems like the moon landing.</v>

5158
02:10:48.141 --> 02:10:48.441
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

5159
02:10:48.441 --> 02:10:49.310
<v Speaker 3>it's like nothing.</v>

5160
02:10:49.580 --> 02:10:50.560
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing in comparison.</v>

5161
02:10:50.580 --> 02:10:50.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5162
02:10:50.700 --> 02:10:51.170
<v Speaker 3>cause you can't,</v>

5163
02:10:51.170 --> 02:10:51.831
<v Speaker 3>you can't prove,</v>

5164
02:10:51.831 --> 02:10:54.350
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even see this shit coming when I came here today.</v>

5165
02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:54.920
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

5166
02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:55.371
<v Speaker 3>honestly,</v>

5167
02:10:55.371 --> 02:10:57.080
<v Speaker 3>moon landing shit wasn't real,</v>

5168
02:10:57.081 --> 02:10:57.860
<v Speaker 3>was it not?</v>

5169
02:10:57.860 --> 02:11:00.200
<v Speaker 3>I was not in the back of my mind.</v>

5170
02:11:00.730 --> 02:11:01.563
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't in mine,</v>

5171
02:11:01.710 --> 02:11:03.470
<v Speaker 3>but I forgot the Russells of Mungai.</v>

5172
02:11:03.500 --> 02:11:03.711
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

5173
02:11:03.711 --> 02:11:03.871
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

5174
02:11:03.871 --> 02:11:04.131
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

5175
02:11:04.131 --> 02:11:06.350
<v Speaker 3>I've argued with people and I absolutely don't know.</v>

5176
02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

5177
02:11:06.980 --> 02:11:07.311
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

5178
02:11:07.311 --> 02:11:12.311
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe you are totally down for you or the moon hoax crusade or no,</v>

5179
02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:15.131
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5180
02:11:15.131 --> 02:11:15.261
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5181
02:11:15.261 --> 02:11:15.370
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5182
02:11:15.370 --> 02:11:15.571
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5183
02:11:15.571 --> 02:11:15.751
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5184
02:11:15.751 --> 02:11:15.861
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5185
02:11:15.861 --> 02:11:15.990
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5186
02:11:15.990 --> 02:11:16.250
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

5187
02:11:16.250 --> 02:11:16.581
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

5188
02:11:16.581 --> 02:11:16.851
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

5189
02:11:16.851 --> 02:11:17.400
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5190
02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:18.260
<v Speaker 3>Here's my issue.</v>

5191
02:11:18.290 --> 02:11:20.210
<v Speaker 3>My issue is how can I even argue it?</v>

5192
02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:22.400
<v Speaker 3>How is it possible that I even have points?</v>

5193
02:11:22.670 --> 02:11:25.060
<v Speaker 3>How is it possible that anybody had ever heard of the moons?</v>

5194
02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:26.890
<v Speaker 3>You see breezy right there,</v>

5195
02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:28.250
<v Speaker 3>fucking all this shit.</v>

5196
02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:29.720
<v Speaker 3>I hope someone did go to the moon.</v>

5197
02:11:29.721 --> 02:11:30.560
<v Speaker 3>I hope someone did.</v>

5198
02:11:30.561 --> 02:11:31.370
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

5199
02:11:31.370 --> 02:11:32.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they didn't,</v>

5200
02:11:32.780 --> 02:11:36.410
<v Speaker 3>but I do know that it's weird that it's the only time in human history where</v>

5201
02:11:36.411 --> 02:11:38.660
<v Speaker 3>people have been more than 400 feet above the earth's surface.</v>

5202
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:40.460
<v Speaker 3>No other space shuttle mission,</v>

5203
02:11:40.461 --> 02:11:41.870
<v Speaker 3>no other space station mission.</v>

5204
02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:43.400
<v Speaker 3>Nothing goes any higher than that.</v>

5205
02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:44.060
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

5206
02:11:44.060 --> 02:11:49.060
<v Speaker 3>But they went 260,000 miles out and then return to earth man when they did in</v>

5207
02:11:50.581 --> 02:11:53.550
<v Speaker 3>1969 to 1972 I know if I had a boss,</v>

5208
02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:54.800
<v Speaker 3>a bit of a head fuck,</v>

5209
02:11:54.801 --> 02:11:55.700
<v Speaker 3>can't do it now.</v>

5210
02:11:55.701 --> 02:11:56.090
<v Speaker 3>We haven't,</v>

5211
02:11:56.090 --> 02:11:56.923
<v Speaker 3>haven't had flux.</v>

5212
02:11:56.930 --> 02:11:59.930
<v Speaker 3>It's a bit of a head fuck now when they talk about going to the moon,</v>

5213
02:12:00.170 --> 02:12:01.340
<v Speaker 3>George W.</v>

5214
02:12:01.340 --> 02:12:01.350
<v Speaker 3>Bush,</v>

5215
02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:03.290
<v Speaker 3>why do that lady,</v>

5216
02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:04.133
<v Speaker 3>why don't,</v>

5217
02:12:04.190 --> 02:12:08.450
<v Speaker 3>why don't we just released like a two k 13 edition of going to the moon and</v>

5218
02:12:08.451 --> 02:12:08.630
<v Speaker 3>back?</v>

5219
02:12:08.630 --> 02:12:08.950
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5220
02:12:08.950 --> 02:12:10.540
<v Speaker 3>you know you do a of the day,</v>

5221
02:12:10.550 --> 02:12:11.061
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

5222
02:12:11.061 --> 02:12:11.660
<v Speaker 3>he can't.</v>

5223
02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:12.291
<v Speaker 3>They say the,</v>

5224
02:12:12.291 --> 02:12:14.450
<v Speaker 3>our technology is much more improved now,</v>

5225
02:12:14.451 --> 02:12:17.180
<v Speaker 3>so they would have to read easier,</v>

5226
02:12:17.181 --> 02:12:21.350
<v Speaker 3>can't you would say so they can't use the Saturn five rockets though because</v>

5227
02:12:21.470 --> 02:12:22.460
<v Speaker 3>that's like an old model.</v>

5228
02:12:22.461 --> 02:12:25.280
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to just recreate what worked in the 60s they want to apply</v>

5229
02:12:25.281 --> 02:12:29.780
<v Speaker 3>modern technology and a printer and then now might've monitoring too fucked up.</v>

5230
02:12:29.781 --> 02:12:31.820
<v Speaker 3>Playing devil's advocate to the extreme here,</v>

5231
02:12:31.821 --> 02:12:32.670
<v Speaker 3>I never pretended I,</v>

5232
02:12:32.671 --> 02:12:34.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck happened.</v>

5233
02:12:34.490 --> 02:12:35.323
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't mind</v>

5234
02:12:36.650 --> 02:12:38.840
<v Speaker 3>fucking artists to perform on the moon.</v>

5235
02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:42.080
<v Speaker 3>It would be pretty dope if we could actually go to the moon if it was safe.</v>

5236
02:12:42.410 --> 02:12:42.681
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5237
02:12:42.681 --> 02:12:43.514
<v Speaker 3>I don't know</v>

5238
02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:50.210
<v Speaker 3>if you've seen the photos that they had that they had a lunar rover orbiter to</v>

5239
02:12:50.220 --> 02:12:51.053
<v Speaker 3>took photos,</v>

5240
02:12:51.060 --> 02:12:51.831
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck it was.</v>

5241
02:12:51.831 --> 02:12:53.720
<v Speaker 3>The Mars orbiter.</v>

5242
02:12:54.110 --> 02:12:56.810
<v Speaker 3>Now they took photos of the moon and they showed like the little spots where the</v>

5243
02:12:56.811 --> 02:13:01.811
<v Speaker 3>astronauts were walking like fair footprints fucking way in 50 eggs.</v>

5244
02:13:03.390 --> 02:13:04.940
<v Speaker 3>It looks fake as fuck.</v>

5245
02:13:04.941 --> 02:13:06.560
<v Speaker 3>Like what the footprints are you still there,</v>

5246
02:13:06.990 --> 02:13:07.823
<v Speaker 3>Shannon?</v>

5247
02:13:08.330 --> 02:13:11.810
<v Speaker 3>Romain agnostic to do to the whole.</v>

5248
02:13:11.840 --> 02:13:12.650
<v Speaker 3>I do too.</v>

5249
02:13:12.650 --> 02:13:13.910
<v Speaker 3>I would think it would be hilarious though,</v>

5250
02:13:13.911 --> 02:13:14.450
<v Speaker 3>is if,</v>

5251
02:13:14.450 --> 02:13:16.520
<v Speaker 3>even if we actually did go to the moon,</v>

5252
02:13:16.670 --> 02:13:20.210
<v Speaker 3>if some overzealous NASA fucking freak said,</v>

5253
02:13:20.211 --> 02:13:20.541
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

5254
02:13:20.541 --> 02:13:22.330
<v Speaker 3>these hoaxers who got to fucking show them,</v>

5255
02:13:22.350 --> 02:13:24.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to show a nonpartisan.</v>

5256
02:13:24.990 --> 02:13:25.823
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5257
02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:26.561
<v Speaker 3>Third parties.</v>

5258
02:13:26.561 --> 02:13:27.590
<v Speaker 3>It's gotta be a third party.</v>

5259
02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:31.560
<v Speaker 3>Can't be a third party because he won't let anybody go anywhere near the sites.</v>

5260
02:13:31.770 --> 02:13:32.150
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

5261
02:13:32.150 --> 02:13:35.760
<v Speaker 8>they've declared a ban on flyovers of all the moons sites.</v>

5262
02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:38.250
<v Speaker 8>This is true because they don't want to disturb the area.</v>

5263
02:13:38.370 --> 02:13:39.210
<v Speaker 8>This is absolutely true.</v>

5264
02:13:39.211 --> 02:13:40.000
<v Speaker 8>Obama's pastor,</v>

5265
02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:43.400
<v Speaker 8>so the optics Sadat allowed the other countries like India,</v>

5266
02:13:43.410 --> 02:13:47.190
<v Speaker 8>go see a picture of that epic landing spot.</v>

5267
02:13:47.220 --> 02:13:47.761
<v Speaker 8>Can't go there.</v>

5268
02:13:47.761 --> 02:13:49.260
<v Speaker 8>You can't fly over and take a picture</v>

5269
02:13:52.390 --> 02:13:54.600
<v Speaker 8>that seems suspect a little bit.</v>

5270
02:13:54.601 --> 02:13:55.500
<v Speaker 8>It does a little bit.</v>

5271
02:13:55.580 --> 02:13:55.921
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

5272
02:13:55.921 --> 02:13:56.290
<v Speaker 8>I look,</v>

5273
02:13:56.290 --> 02:13:57.510
<v Speaker 8>I've argued with it.</v>

5274
02:13:57.570 --> 02:13:58.403
<v Speaker 8>I don't,</v>

5275
02:13:58.440 --> 02:13:59.400
<v Speaker 8>I've argued with it.</v>

5276
02:13:59.430 --> 02:14:03.840
<v Speaker 8>I've argued with this Guy Phil plait from bad astronomy.com and he's a great guy</v>

5277
02:14:03.841 --> 02:14:06.480
<v Speaker 8>and I really wished I didn't have to argue with them cause I love,</v>

5278
02:14:06.660 --> 02:14:09.120
<v Speaker 8>I love so much of the Shitty says like I love his,</v>

5279

02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:11.670
<v Speaker 8>He did a Ted talk on asteroids.</v>

5281
02:14:11.671 --> 02:14:13.180
<v Speaker 8>It was fucking awesome what did meet you?</v>

5282
02:14:13.290 --> 02:14:15.090
<v Speaker 8>But it was his problem with me.</v>

5283
02:14:15.091 --> 02:14:15.470
<v Speaker 8>It's,</v>

5284
02:14:15.470 --> 02:14:16.950
<v Speaker 8>they're so proud about it,</v>

5285
02:14:16.951 --> 02:14:17.100
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

5286
02:14:17.100 --> 02:14:18.190
<v Speaker 8>I didn't talk to him about it.</v>

5287
02:14:20.150 --> 02:14:21.420
<v Speaker 8>Is that,</v>

5288

<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to be taking them seriously.</v>

5859
02:30:12.350 --> 02:30:16.910
<v Speaker 4>But it is kind of fascinating that if you ever see current current TV they have,</v>

5860
02:30:16.911 --> 02:30:17.690
<v Speaker 4>or vanguard,</v>

<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

5863
02:30:19.251 --> 02:30:20.570
<v Speaker 4>I think that's untrue TV or one of the,</v>

5864
02:30:20.571 --> 02:30:24.080
<v Speaker 4>one of those TV networks were secure cable network and they uh,</v>

5865
02:30:24.081 --> 02:30:24.381
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

5866
02:30:24.381 --> 02:30:25.880
<v Speaker 4>they spend a lot of time and the,</v>

5867
02:30:25.881 --> 02:30:28.310
<v Speaker 4>there's the in the woods where these people are like,</v>

5868
02:30:28.311 --> 02:30:31.520
<v Speaker 4>there's like a lot of like serious crime going on because people are cutting</v>

5869
02:30:31.521 --> 02:30:32.360
<v Speaker 4>down these trees.</v>

5870
02:30:34.820 --> 02:30:38.690
<v Speaker 4>They find these accuracy labs out in the woods and they go in with guns and it's</v>

5871
02:30:38.691 --> 02:30:39.051
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

5872
02:30:39.051 --> 02:30:40.130
<v Speaker 4>The military comes in.</v>

5873
02:30:40.131 --> 02:30:40.851
<v Speaker 4>It's really nuts,</v>

5874
02:30:40.851 --> 02:30:41.684
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

5875
02:30:42.530 --> 02:30:43.610
<v Speaker 4>It's just like Columbia.</v>

5876
02:30:44.520 --> 02:30:45.353
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know.</v>

5877
02:30:45.680 --> 02:30:46.341
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know either.</v>

5878
02:30:46.341 --> 02:30:46.941
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was a,</v>

5879
02:30:46.941 --> 02:30:48.320
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was the same thing that you thought.</v>

5880
02:30:48.321 --> 02:30:49.690
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was some shit mate in the lab.</v>

5881
02:30:49.770 --> 02:30:53.870
<v Speaker 9>So is this like something generally accepted that should go in hand in hand with</v>

5882
02:30:53.900 --> 02:30:55.280
<v Speaker 9>like electronic music then?</v>

5883
02:30:55.680 --> 02:30:56.070
<v Speaker 8>No.</v>

5884
02:30:56.070 --> 02:30:56.311

5887
02:30:58.411 --> 02:30:59.250

6058
02:36:13.300 --> 02:36:14.120
<v Speaker 9>Oh right.</v>

6059
02:36:14.120 --> 02:36:14.960
<v Speaker 9>Cause you're Canadian,</v>

02:36:15.230 --> 02:36:16.063
<v Speaker 9>the Canadian thing.</v>

<v Speaker 8>this doesn't make no,</v>

6069
02:36:27.310 --> 02:36:28.390
<v Speaker 8>I don't think that's what it is,</v>

6070
02:36:28.391 --> 02:36:28.721
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

6071
02:36:28.721 --> 02:36:32.350

6072
02:36:32.351 --> 02:36:36.910
<v Speaker 8>positive person and he's ambitious and he's obviously to go from where you</v>

6073
02:36:37.120 --> 02:36:41.650
<v Speaker 8>started doing that kind of music and then four years later you're filling the</v>

6074
02:36:41.650 --> 02:36:41.750
<v Speaker 8>Roger Center.</v>

6075
02:36:41.750 --> 02:36:43.360
<v Speaker 8>You have to be ambitious.</v>

6076
02:36:43.361 --> 02:36:44.230
<v Speaker 8>There's no way around</v>

6077
02:36:46.200 --> 02:36:48.610
<v Speaker 8>back and in terms of fucking doing shit then fine</v>

6078
02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:53.290
<v Speaker 8>fucking smoking weed and all that shit right now.</v>

6080
02:36:54.401 --> 02:36:56.680
<v Speaker 8>Like I'm just so preoccupied with fucking this,</v>

6081
02:36:56.681 --> 02:36:57.550
<v Speaker 8>that and the other thing.</v>

02:36:58.601 --> 02:36:59.434
<v Speaker 8>But you're drinking.</v>

6085
02:36:59.710 --> 02:37:00.790
<v Speaker 8>That's what doesn't make any sense.</v>

6086
02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:02.080
<v Speaker 8>You're altering your state.</v>

6087
02:37:02.110 --> 02:37:02.321
<v Speaker 8>You're,</v>

<v Speaker 8>It's a different alteration.</v>

6091
02:37:05.320 --> 02:37:05.501
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

6092

<v Speaker 8>It allows you to like relax your standards.</v>

6099
02:37:18.390 --> 02:37:21.580
<v Speaker 8>It allows you to come here and get some work on that.</v>

6100
02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:23.820
<v Speaker 8>Let you ego flight shortly.</v>

6101

6110
02:37:34.340 --> 02:37:35.540
<v Speaker 8>It wasn't even who I got high with.</v>

6111
02:37:35.541 --> 02:37:36.280
<v Speaker 8>Its high.</v>

6113
02:37:36.590 --> 02:37:39.440
<v Speaker 8>I just tried it every time I tried it.</v>

6114
02:37:39.441 --> 02:37:41.450
<v Speaker 8>I did not like the like the way I feel paranoid,</v>

6118
02:37:46.761 --> 02:37:48.110
<v Speaker 8>Do you know that most of the people,</v>

6119
02:37:48.111 --> 02:37:48.891
<v Speaker 8>what most people get,</v>

6120
02:37:48.891 --> 02:37:51.920
<v Speaker 8>it's called Endeca and what indicators is couch weed makes you really sleepy and</v>

6121
02:37:51.921 --> 02:37:52.370
<v Speaker 8>tired.</v>

6122
02:37:52.370 --> 02:37:55.100
<v Speaker 8>There's another thing called Sativa South American.</v>

6123
02:37:55.101 --> 02:37:57.020
<v Speaker 8>We'd like South Pacific,</v>

<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

6128
02:38:05.060 --> 02:38:07.730
<v Speaker 8>I think he's thinking that the Salvia divinorum Oh yeah,</v>

6129
02:38:07.970 --> 02:38:08.840
<v Speaker 8>this is sativa,</v>

6130
02:38:08.841 --> 02:38:09.590
<v Speaker 8>sativa,</v>

6131
02:38:09.590 --> 02:38:10.071
<v Speaker 8>Sativa,</v>

6132
02:38:10.071 --> 02:38:10.880
<v Speaker 8>road.</v>

02:38:10.880 --> 02:38:11.710
<v Speaker 8>Marijuana.</v>

6134
02:38:11.710 --> 02:38:12.110
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

6135
02:38:12.110 --> 02:38:12.943
<v Speaker 8>It's a different,</v>

6136
02:38:13.430 --> 02:38:13.860
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

6137
02:38:13.860 --> 02:38:14.541
<v Speaker 8>it's a,</v>

6138
02:38:14.541 --> 02:38:16.160
<v Speaker 8>it's a much more heady,</v>

6139
02:38:16.161 --> 02:38:17.630
<v Speaker 8>much more Carl Sagan.</v>

6140
02:38:17.631 --> 02:38:21.260
<v Speaker 8>Much more staring at fucking documentaries sativa.</v>

6141
02:38:21.350 --> 02:38:21.890
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

6142
02:38:21.890 --> 02:38:22.760
<v Speaker 8>Much more like,</v>

6143
02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:24.350
<v Speaker 8>you know what I'm saying is that I do that.</v>

6144
02:38:25.430 --> 02:38:26.570
<v Speaker 8>Most people don't know that.</v>

6145
02:38:27.110 --> 02:38:27.681
<v Speaker 8>I know you do.</v>

6146
02:38:27.681 --> 02:38:28.514
<v Speaker 8>I know you do,</v>

6147
02:38:28.670 --> 02:38:30.860
<v Speaker 8>but there is totally to totally different effects.</v>

6148
02:38:30.861 --> 02:38:31.581
<v Speaker 8>Eddie likes it all.</v>

6149
02:38:31.581 --> 02:38:32.260
<v Speaker 8>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>

6150
02:38:32.260 --> 02:38:33.093
<v Speaker 8>I think it's all good</v>

6151
02:38:35.180 --> 02:38:35.571
<v Speaker 8>right away.</v>

6152
02:38:35.571 --> 02:38:36.580
<v Speaker 8>I started to Moria anyway.</v>

6153
02:38:37.610 --> 02:38:38.530
<v Speaker 8>I agree with that as well.</v>

6154
02:38:38.690 --> 02:38:40.670
<v Speaker 8>Especially once you're a seasoned smoker.</v>

6155
02:38:40.880 --> 02:38:41.181
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

6156
02:38:41.181 --> 02:38:41.421
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

6157
02:38:41.421 --> 02:38:41.631
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

6158
02:38:41.631 --> 02:38:41.811
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

6159
02:38:41.811 --> 02:38:42.770
<v Speaker 8>It's not the same shit.</v>

6160
02:38:42.800 --> 02:38:43.011
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

6161
02:38:43.011 --> 02:38:46.670
<v Speaker 8>it's definitely not start smoking till I don't think it is,</v>

6162
02:38:46.671 --> 02:38:46.881
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

6163
02:38:46.881 --> 02:38:48.230
<v Speaker 8>I don't think it has the same effect.</v>

6164
02:38:48.970 --> 02:38:50.270
<v Speaker 8>It's anything that has the same effect.</v>

6165
02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:55.190
<v Speaker 8>I used to really think that sativa like controlled your appetite and Endeca.</v>

6166
02:38:55.191 --> 02:38:56.780
<v Speaker 8>You got the munchies and all that shit.</v>

6167
02:38:57.320 --> 02:38:59.060
<v Speaker 8>I think it's whatever you think it is.</v>

6168
02:38:59.170 --> 02:38:59.640
<v Speaker 8>That's right.</v>

6169
02:38:59.640 --> 02:39:00.450
<v Speaker 9>Whoa.</v>

6170
02:39:00.450 --> 02:39:03.750
<v Speaker 9>I kind of see that because I've been doing a lot of hybrids lately.</v>

6257
02:41:09.811 --> 02:41:11.030
<v Speaker 10>honestly when I was up in,</v>

6258
02:41:11.090 --> 02:41:11.231
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

6259

6262
02:41:21.240 --> 02:41:22.730
<v Speaker 10>over and over again and every day</v>

6263
02:41:22.790 --> 02:41:23.623
<v Speaker 1>Tom the door.</v>

6264
02:41:26.900 --> 02:41:27.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6265
02:41:27.081 --> 02:41:27.914
<v Speaker 1>that's the one.</v>

6266
02:41:28.970 --> 02:41:31.040
<v Speaker 1>It was just playing over and over and over in the head.</v>

6267
02:41:31.270 --> 02:41:34.040
<v Speaker 1>And every time that the security thing went off at the door,</v>

6268
02:41:34.041 --> 02:41:35.450
<v Speaker 1>that opened up and like I said,</v>

6269
02:41:35.451 --> 02:41:38.660
<v Speaker 1>it was either a cop or my mom or my mom dressed up as a cop.</v>

6270
02:41:38.690 --> 02:41:40.120
<v Speaker 1>You need a sample that a new,</v>

6271
02:41:40.490 --> 02:41:41.200

<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

6273
02:41:41.601 --> 02:41:42.230
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect.</v>

6274
02:41:42.230 --> 02:41:43.430
<v Speaker 1>That's when I decided,</v>

6275
02:41:43.460 --> 02:41:44.293
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

6276
02:41:44.660 --> 02:41:45.560
<v Speaker 1>not for everyone.</v>

6277
02:41:46.220 --> 02:41:47.053
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like a,</v>

6278
02:41:47.060 --> 02:41:47.731
<v Speaker 1>like a senior,</v>

6279
02:41:47.731 --> 02:41:50.640
<v Speaker 1>a Stanley Kubrick movie or you need to grab that shit.</v>

6280
02:41:50.720 --> 02:41:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Mom dressed up like a jazzy Jeff juggling it before the fucking chorus comes in.</v>

6281
02:41:54.650 --> 02:41:55.483
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a sec.</v>

6282
02:41:56.650 --> 02:41:57.483
<v Speaker 13>Shit.</v>

6283
02:41:57.820 --> 02:41:58.653
<v Speaker 13>Monahan</v>

6284
02:42:00.790 --> 02:42:03.600
<v Speaker 13>wanted shit out Monahan.</v>

6285
02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:04.913
<v Speaker 13>Can we do this?</v>

6286
02:42:05.880 --> 02:42:06.713
<v Speaker 13>One of the hill?</v>

6287
02:42:07.490 --> 02:42:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Ain't no,</v>

6288
02:42:07.740 --> 02:42:10.880
<v Speaker 1>they're running harder to jazzy Jeff is juggling and back and forth.</v>

6289
02:42:11.480 --> 02:42:13.130
<v Speaker 1>That's a very specific accent.</v>

6290
02:42:13.131 --> 02:42:14.180
<v Speaker 1>I would say that the Philadelphia,</v>

6291
02:42:14.210 --> 02:42:14.361
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6292
02:42:14.361 --> 02:42:15.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it played out.</v>

6293
02:42:15.380 --> 02:42:15.951
<v Speaker 1>Is that legal?</v>

6294
02:42:15.951 --> 02:42:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Is that a Philadelphia accent?</v>

6295
02:42:17.180 --> 02:42:17.271
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

6296
02:42:17.271 --> 02:42:18.104
<v Speaker 1>it's Boston.</v>

6297
02:42:18.180 --> 02:42:18.990
<v Speaker 4>Is it really?</v>

6298
02:42:18.990 --> 02:42:19.800
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

6299
02:42:19.800 --> 02:42:20.310
<v Speaker 4>Boston,</v>

6300
02:42:20.310 --> 02:42:21.020
<v Speaker 4>Philadelphia,</v>

6301
02:42:21.020 --> 02:42:21.600
<v Speaker 4>Andrew saw,</v>

6302
02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:21.910
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

6303
02:42:21.910 --> 02:42:23.190
<v Speaker 4>we were fade outs.</v>

6304
02:42:23.310 --> 02:42:23.641
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

6305
02:42:23.641 --> 02:42:25.000
<v Speaker 4>you're from fucking Boston.</v>

6306
02:42:25.050 --> 02:42:25.711
<v Speaker 4>Don't like that.</v>

6307
02:42:25.711 --> 02:42:25.951
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6308
02:42:25.951 --> 02:42:26.341
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't,</v>

6309
02:42:26.341 --> 02:42:27.870
<v Speaker 4>it sounded like Philadelphia to me.</v>

6310
02:42:27.930 --> 02:42:30.960
<v Speaker 4>But Boston black is very different than Boston white.</v>

6311
02:42:30.990 --> 02:42:32.670
<v Speaker 4>There's this does it different accents.</v>

6312
02:42:32.850 --> 02:42:37.530
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a lot of the pack your car that didn't get inherited by the Boston</v>

6313
02:42:37.531 --> 02:42:38.460
<v Speaker 4>black community.</v>

6322
02:42:52.330 --> 02:42:53.163
<v Speaker 10>I remember we were in,</v>

6323
02:42:53.200 --> 02:42:57.850
<v Speaker 10>in Scotland in 2000 and he had this girlfriend at the time who was from</v>

6324
02:42:57.851 --> 02:42:59.420
<v Speaker 10>Liverpool and uh,</v>

6325
02:42:59.470 --> 02:42:59.741
<v Speaker 10>she,</v>

6326
02:42:59.741 --> 02:43:03.100
<v Speaker 10>we were walking and everything was fucking uphill in Scotland in Edinburgh.</v>

6327
02:43:03.490 --> 02:43:03.761
<v Speaker 10>And,</v>

6328
02:43:03.761 --> 02:43:03.940
<v Speaker 10>uh,</v>

6329
02:43:03.940 --> 02:43:05.560
<v Speaker 10>she was complaining about walking and goes,</v>

6330
02:43:05.830 --> 02:43:06.101
<v Speaker 10>bitch,</v>

6331
02:43:06.101 --> 02:43:09.310
<v Speaker 10>don't act like you're too fucking high post to be walking up and down.</v>

6332
02:43:09.550 --> 02:43:12.220
<v Speaker 10>And I just thought it was the funniest shit because she said that and adding</v>

6333
02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:12.700
<v Speaker 6>color.</v>

02:43:14.730 --> 02:43:15.970
<v Speaker 6>remember all yeah.</v>

6336
02:43:15.971 --> 02:43:16.804
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

6337
02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:21.550
<v Speaker 6>I can't remember the cabaret fucking Voltaire or what we were at the Edinburgh</v>

6338
02:43:21.551 --> 02:43:22.510
<v Speaker 6>comedy festival.</v>

6339
02:43:22.540 --> 02:43:23.230
<v Speaker 6>Oh Shit.</v>

6340
02:43:23.230 --> 02:43:24.063
<v Speaker 6>And I just remember thinking,</v>

6341
02:43:24.110 --> 02:43:25.660
<v Speaker 6>I kept saying by the castle,</v>

6342
02:43:25.840 --> 02:43:26.611
<v Speaker 6>it was by the cast.</v>

6343
02:43:26.611 --> 02:43:28.020
<v Speaker 6>So we were on North Castle Street.</v>

6344
02:43:28.140 --> 02:43:28.550
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

6345
02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:28.770
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

6346
02:43:28.770 --> 02:43:29.320
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

6347
02:43:29.320 --> 02:43:30.340
<v Speaker 6>And I would just,</v>

6348
02:43:30.370 --> 02:43:32.590
<v Speaker 6>I would just even years later I would say to him,</v>

6349
02:43:32.591 --> 02:43:32.771
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>

6350

6351
02:43:36.220 --> 02:43:40.270
<v Speaker 6>Cause there was a song called high post at that time to post high.</v>

6352
02:43:40.600 --> 02:43:41.261
<v Speaker 6>When was this?</v>

6353
02:43:41.261 --> 02:43:42.094
<v Speaker 6>He had the two.</v>

6354
02:43:42.570 --> 02:43:43.210
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

6355
02:43:43.210 --> 02:43:45.550
<v Speaker 6>Teresa band raising shit.</v>

6356
02:43:45.580 --> 02:43:50.390
<v Speaker 6>I'm banned from a place on fucking castle or the cabaret Voltaire.</v>

6357
02:43:50.391 --> 02:43:51.400
<v Speaker 6>I was what did you do to them?</v>

6358
02:43:51.430 --> 02:43:52.270
<v Speaker 6>Well I didn't do anything.</v>

6359
02:43:52.271 --> 02:43:55.570
<v Speaker 6>I was testing the integrity of a bottle outside of the nightclub,</v>

6360
02:43:55.600 --> 02:43:58.810
<v Speaker 6>basically kicking it against a care of seeing how much it would take to smash.</v>

6361
02:43:59.050 --> 02:44:01.710
<v Speaker 6>And so it's funny cause that was odd,</v>

6362
02:44:01.810 --> 02:44:02.643
<v Speaker 6>segregate</v>

6363
02:44:04.660 --> 02:44:05.710
<v Speaker 6>the official and whatever.</v>

6364
02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:10.510
<v Speaker 6>But I was playing at the club that night and then we stopped or whatever and now</v>

6365
02:44:10.511 --> 02:44:13.540
<v Speaker 6>I'm out of town and having a cigarette and I'm like kind of edge and a bottle on</v>

6366
02:44:13.541 --> 02:44:14.141
<v Speaker 6>the fucking thing.</v>

6367
02:44:14.141 --> 02:44:15.640
<v Speaker 6>Cause everyone was like smashing bottles.</v>

6368
02:44:15.641 --> 02:44:16.474
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking Edinburgh.</v>

6369
02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:19.270
<v Speaker 6>So I'm going crazy fucking whatever.</v>

6370
02:44:20.210 --> 02:44:21.360
<v Speaker 6>And I start like,</v>

6371
02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:24.700
<v Speaker 6>like Kinda like back kicking this fucking bottle on their thing and all the</v>

6372
02:44:24.701 --> 02:44:27.520
<v Speaker 6>security guys are watching me waiting for the fucking thing to break.</v>

6373
02:44:27.521 --> 02:44:31.180
<v Speaker 6>Cause they knew as soon as it breaks it had grounds to fucking kicked me out and</v>

6374
02:44:31.510 --> 02:44:34.060
<v Speaker 6>he had a weapon or something.</v>

6375
02:44:34.400 --> 02:44:36.730
<v Speaker 6>So then they had evidence that you're a Douche bag.</v>

6376
02:44:37.060 --> 02:44:37.893
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6377
02:44:38.840 --> 02:44:41.620
<v Speaker 6>So I finally broke it and then they all came out and they say,</v>

6649
02:51:17.770 --> 02:51:21.690
<v Speaker 9>She got [inaudible] little thing you put in your pocket that gives along the</v>

6650
02:51:21.720 --> 02:51:22.480
<v Speaker 9>lines,</v>

6651
02:51:22.480 --> 02:51:23.241
<v Speaker 9>the CD,</v>

6652
02:51:23.241 --> 02:51:26.010
<v Speaker 9>disk sized fucking vibrator that they give you.</v>

6653
02:51:26.360 --> 02:51:29.590
<v Speaker 9>You know it's the worst and it lights the light.</v>

6654
02:51:30.190 --> 02:51:31.011
<v Speaker 9>You know it's the worst.</v>

6655
02:51:31.011 --> 02:51:31.791
<v Speaker 9>This is the worst thing.</v>

6656
02:51:31.791 --> 02:51:33.920
<v Speaker 9>Si true story that that that thing,</v>

6657
02:51:33.921 --> 02:51:37.080
<v Speaker 9>if you go out of bounds at the Burbank Olive Garden,</v>

6658
02:51:37.130 --> 02:51:38.930
<v Speaker 9>always an hour and a half to two hour wait.</v>

6659
02:51:39.110 --> 02:51:42.950
<v Speaker 9>So if you go out of bounds it starts playing this really embarrassing song and</v>

6660
02:51:42.951 --> 02:51:44.090
<v Speaker 9>it won't stop.</v>

6661
02:51:44.180 --> 02:51:46.450
<v Speaker 9>So like I would always go do your thing you're talking about,</v>

6662
02:51:47.810 --> 02:51:51.110
<v Speaker 9>I would go to target and next thing you know he'd start playing nursery rhymes</v>

6663
02:51:51.111 --> 02:51:52.550
<v Speaker 9>but really loud and it's like,</v>

6664
02:51:53.510 --> 02:51:58.130
<v Speaker 9>it's like an ice cream truck in your pocket looking at you and it's like,</v>

6665
02:51:58.131 --> 02:51:58.964
<v Speaker 9>it's like you're,</v>

6666
02:51:59.940 --> 02:52:00.170
<v Speaker 9>yeah,</v>

6667
02:52:00.170 --> 02:52:01.670
<v Speaker 9>I swear to God and it's like a way to say,</v>

6668
02:52:01.671 --> 02:52:01.881
<v Speaker 9>hey,</v>

6669
02:52:01.881 --> 02:52:03.020
<v Speaker 9>you're stealing something.</v>

6670
02:52:03.021 --> 02:52:04.760
<v Speaker 9>You're stealing the olive garden's property.</v>

6671
02:52:04.820 --> 02:52:06.400
<v Speaker 9>We're going to annoy everybody</v>

6672
02:52:06.400 --> 02:52:09.130
<v Speaker 6>around you by this really high pitched nursery.</v>

6674
02:52:11.590 --> 02:52:15.220
<v Speaker 6>I guess as long as it's 10 that it's torturing you.</v>

6675
02:52:15.370 --> 02:52:17.640
<v Speaker 6>Whereas if it was like an alarm that went off like right,</v>

6676
02:52:17.650 --> 02:52:18.970
<v Speaker 6>he'd probably sue them for that shit.</v>

6677
02:52:18.971 --> 02:52:19.300
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

6678
02:52:19.300 --> 02:52:19.451
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

6679
02:52:19.451 --> 02:52:23.310
<v Speaker 6>how do I get this to shut off so they can't like put like some audio that's like</v>

<v Speaker 6>Hey what are you doing with them?</v>

<v Speaker 6>My pay,</v>

6685
02:52:32.480 --> 02:52:33.650

<v Speaker 3>the the wheels on my cart lock up.</v>

6689
02:52:43.550 --> 02:52:44.383
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

6690
02:52:45.170 --> 02:52:49.610
<v Speaker 3>They had a certain distance where you could travel away from the store before</v>

6691
02:52:49.611 --> 02:52:50.444
<v Speaker 3>the car locked up.</v>

6692
02:52:50.510 --> 02:52:52.930
<v Speaker 3>But this was so fucking stupid cause it was right in front of this.</v>

<v Speaker 6>That actually is kind of bad ass though.</v>

6741
02:54:06.371 --> 02:54:09.760

02:54:17.170 --> 02:54:20.810
<v Speaker 3>I was at the supermarket and my fucking wheels locked down.</v>

6748
02:54:20.830 --> 02:54:21.700

6750
02:54:22.991 --> 02:54:23.920
<v Speaker 3>I had two choices.</v>

6751
02:54:23.921 --> 02:54:26.920
<v Speaker 3>Either I'm going to call someone and tell them,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I did so I dragged it through the parking lot,</v>

6755
02:54:33.671 --> 02:54:34.630
<v Speaker 3>drag the shit I got to,</v>

6756
02:54:34.631 --> 02:54:35.920
<v Speaker 3>I did an angry man.</v>

6757
02:54:36.040 --> 02:54:38.860
<v Speaker 6>I that happened to me in Canada and urban home out,</v>

02:54:38.880 --> 02:54:43.880
<v Speaker 6>what does it at home outfitters and I had a shit load of shit in there fucking</v>

6759
02:54:43.921 --> 02:54:46.860
<v Speaker 6>cart and I had parked far enough where I couldn't get,</v>

6760
02:54:46.980 --> 02:54:49.860
<v Speaker 6>I pushed the cart in the goes still the car won't go there,</v>

6761
02:54:49.940 --> 02:54:51.030
<v Speaker 6>more the fuck do I have a car?</v>

6762
02:54:51.060 --> 02:54:53.890
<v Speaker 6>And it really pisses me off because we weren't as Mexicans in Canada can help.</v>

6763
02:54:54.050 --> 02:54:55.100
<v Speaker 3>Two things I never do.</v>

6764
02:54:55.170 --> 02:54:56.760
<v Speaker 3>Hey Hammer,</v>

6765
02:54:58.950 --> 02:54:59.870
<v Speaker 3>Ian's going to come out.</v>

6766
02:54:59.900 --> 02:55:00.651
<v Speaker 3>Two things I never do.</v>

6767
02:55:00.651 --> 02:55:02.000
<v Speaker 3>I never purposely litter.</v>

6768
02:55:02.240 --> 02:55:03.073
<v Speaker 3>I never let her,</v>

6769
02:55:03.080 --> 02:55:04.130
<v Speaker 3>I always bring back cards</v>

6770
02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:05.300
<v Speaker 8>just it's not that fucking hard.</v>

6771
02:55:05.630 --> 02:55:10.070
<v Speaker 8>You didn't know about these fucking carts and then this is all brand new.</v>

6772
02:55:10.071 --> 02:55:11.900
<v Speaker 8>This is like discovery channel shift from me.</v>

6773
02:55:12.020 --> 02:55:16.170
<v Speaker 8>There's carts and say you can't fuck you go further than a certain distance.</v>

6774
02:55:16.210 --> 02:55:17.210
<v Speaker 8>Never shot up.</v>

6775
02:55:17.930 --> 02:55:18.890
<v Speaker 8>The carts will lock.</v>

6776
02:55:18.920 --> 02:55:21.440
<v Speaker 8>They literally look stupid that you can't you.</v>

6777
02:55:21.441 --> 02:55:22.490
<v Speaker 8>So you have to drag them.</v>

6778
02:55:22.540 --> 02:55:26.310
<v Speaker 8>So essentially they're on like this rubber pads and she does just grabbing it.</v>

6779
02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:28.273
<v Speaker 8>Is that so wrong?</v>

6780
02:55:28.430 --> 02:55:29.810
<v Speaker 10>I mean if I own a supermarket</v>

6781
02:55:31.460 --> 02:55:35.210
<v Speaker 10>amount of fucking cards and people were just going to be taking those fucking</v>

6782
02:55:35.211 --> 02:55:35.670
<v Speaker 10>things,</v>

6783
02:55:35.670 --> 02:55:37.830
<v Speaker 8>make them go out to the street just to the street.</v>

6784
02:55:37.831 --> 02:55:38.480
<v Speaker 8>They rang.</v>

6785
02:55:38.480 --> 02:55:39.500
<v Speaker 8>You got them out there.</v>

6786
02:55:39.790 --> 02:55:40.210
<v Speaker 8>It's,</v>

6787
02:55:40.210 --> 02:55:41.430
<v Speaker 8>it's like a cell phone.</v>

6788
02:55:41.431 --> 02:55:44.340
<v Speaker 8>I'm sure it's like one of those dog things to those dog electrical.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

6790
02:55:44.530 --> 02:55:47.550
<v Speaker 8>but then you get to look at the value of the fucking cart.</v>

6791
02:55:47.551 --> 02:55:49.330
<v Speaker 8>The cart probably costs about</v>

6792
02:55:51.450 --> 02:55:56.430
<v Speaker 8>$7 I would say 30 I thought if the value of having your customers not have to</v>

6793
02:55:56.431 --> 02:55:57.960
<v Speaker 8>fucking drag their food,</v>
