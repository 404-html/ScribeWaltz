1
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.910
<v Speaker 1>I am one of the directors of science and</v>
<v Speaker 1>my specialty is communications and the</v>

2
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>idea that a mission ends when you return</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the data,</v>

3
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.880
<v Speaker 1>when you make the discoveries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the scientists publish their</v>

4
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:20.400
<v Speaker 1>papers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me the mission doesn't end until you</v>

5
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 1>have some sort of public involvement</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you have some sort of public</v>

6
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.980
<v Speaker 1>buyin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's as important as any other</v>

7
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:28.500
<v Speaker 1>part of the mission you had been trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell people for years that our</v>

8
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:32.220
<v Speaker 1>communications team on a mission is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like having your crack team of</v>

9
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 1>electrical engineers or your or your</v>
<v Speaker 1>best computer programmers.</v>

10
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.680
<v Speaker 1>You need to have people that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand communication as well.</v>

11
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.371
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

12
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:38.941
<v Speaker 1>it helps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

13
00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:40.710
<v Speaker 1>in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started out as a research</v>

14
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:43.680
<v Speaker 1>astrophysicist and so I understand a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the topics as well,</v>

15
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.060
<v Speaker 1>but I do communications now a NASA and</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as why NASA is important,</v>

16
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I think this is one of these things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have no idea.</v>

17
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.100
<v Speaker 1>We run at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>108 science missions.</v>

18
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Those are mostly spacecraft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are on balloons or sounding</v>

19
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:01.910
<v Speaker 1>rockets or on the space station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

20
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.010
<v Speaker 1>some of them are on the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have people embedded with the,</v>

21
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Zombie reindeer herders,</v>

22
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>trying to understand how climate change</v>
<v Speaker 1>is changing the migration of reindeer</v>

23
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:10.381
<v Speaker 1>herds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

24
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing that NASA is all over and,</v>

25
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything from the disaster mitigation</v>

26
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.450
<v Speaker 1>from all of those hurricanes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We actually sent staff to Puerto Rico</v>

27
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>when Fema was overwhelmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been setting up communication</v>

28
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>centers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean everything from determining what</v>
<v Speaker 1>set off the big bang to,</v>

30
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are those wildfires going to be</v>

31
00:01:31.741 --> 00:01:35.820
<v Speaker 1>spreading to in southern California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have 108 missions and I've never seen</v>

32
00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 1>any organization operate more</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficiently.</v>

33
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.840
<v Speaker 1>I've never worked with more brilliant</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

34
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people often don't understand</v>

35
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:45.870
<v Speaker 1>what the real value is as far as blue</v>
<v Speaker 1>sky research.</v>

36
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people talk about spinoffs and people</v>

37
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>joke about things like velcro and Tang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

38
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 1>those are jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

39
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more intelligent people might notice</v>

40
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:55.290
<v Speaker 1>things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.920
<v Speaker 1>microprocessors started at NASA cell</v>
<v Speaker 1>phones,</v>

42
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>the reason you have computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason the United States was poised</v>

43
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>to lead the computer revolution was</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the Apollo program.</v>

44
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.483
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

45
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all of those kind of fall flat to</v>

46
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.320
<v Speaker 1>tell you the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that people don't understand.</v>

47
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.470
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a NASA satellite doing research just out</v>

48
00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 1>of curiosity to see what gases in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere that discovered that the</v>

49
00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:20.070
<v Speaker 1>ozone hole is being depleted in the 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties.</v>

50
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.160
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the NASA scientists with a number of</v>

51
00:02:23.161 --> 00:02:25.310
<v Speaker 1>university scientists went running to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UN instead.</v>

52
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.170
<v Speaker 1>If we don't do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are literally going to destroy the</v>

53
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:31.110
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they made the Montreal.</v>

54
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.360
<v Speaker 1>They actually got the Montreal protocol</v>
<v Speaker 1>sign.</v>

55
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>They actually make treaties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other band,</v>

56
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 1>these chemicals that we're depleting our</v>
<v Speaker 1>ozone layer.</v>

57
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.610
<v Speaker 1>And we've since done an atmospheric</v>
<v Speaker 1>models that show that we would have</v>

58
00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:45.540
<v Speaker 1>actually destroyed the ozone layer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had we done nothing by the year 20,</v>

59
00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which if not in my lifetime is probably</v>

60
00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:51.890
<v Speaker 1>in our children's lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

61
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.330
<v Speaker 1>basically that would have destroyed</v>
<v Speaker 1>agriculture.</v>

62
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Crops would've failed all over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

63
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't have livestock outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People couldn't have lived outside.</v>

64
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we very nearly destroyed civilization</v>

65
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 1>and your grandchildren would have lived</v>
<v Speaker 1>through that.</v>

66
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 1>And so when people talk about what's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best NASA spinoff,</v>

67
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worth of blue sky research that you</v>

68
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 1>don't understand where it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lead best friend,</v>

69
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>if I know this grandchildren.</v>
