25
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:41.181
<v Speaker 2>strange shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're a about 150 miles or so outside</v>

26
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.830
<v Speaker 2>arena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one 70 outside of Reno,</v>

27
00:01:43.831 --> 00:01:45.640
<v Speaker 2>Nevada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

28
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.740
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just saw so much strangeness today.</v>

29
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.750
<v Speaker 2>This is lonely country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

30
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.400
<v Speaker 2>lonely country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a lot of,</v>

31
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.470
<v Speaker 2>what do you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Desert,</v>

32
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.180
<v Speaker 2>desert rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>desert rats,</v>

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.030
<v Speaker 2>all these people there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no offense if you're one of them</v>

34
00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:02.580
<v Speaker 2>listening to this podcast right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you're wonderful people.</v>

35
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.260
<v Speaker 2>Lots of four wheelers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of side by sides,</v>

36
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.330
<v Speaker 2>lots of long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird haircuts,</v>

37
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.840
<v Speaker 2>weird haircuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they just,</v>

38
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 2>it gets to a certain point all man ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to cut the end.</v>

39
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.070
<v Speaker 2>They just free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No is reno is fucking metropolis</v>

40
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.770
<v Speaker 2>compared to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've always thought of Reno's being</v>

41
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 2>that one of those weird places I really</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to go to.</v>

42
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.910
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no offense,</v>

43
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:28.320
<v Speaker 2>if you're from Reno and you're listening</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this,</v>

44
00:02:28.321 --> 00:02:30.860
<v Speaker 2>if that is is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a bigger state than I thought and</v>

45
00:02:30.861 --> 00:02:33.470
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's as empty as anything.</v>

46
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.820
<v Speaker 2>You know what the game means?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does gaming does that mean the,</v>

47
00:02:36.821 --> 00:02:38.910
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like how much it's amplifying the</v>

48
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 2>sound that's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I crank it up way high,</v>

49
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:42.840
<v Speaker 2>it's probably too hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

50
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 2>it's making a red.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

51
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:44.730
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

52
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 2>There's a clipping going red,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means it's too much.</v>

53
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Or I'll leave it right there so jamie</v>
<v Speaker 2>can handle this and Jamie knows how to</v>

54
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:51.781
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a new thing.</v>

55
00:02:51.781 --> 00:02:55.610
<v Speaker 2>I think I picked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called an apogee microphone cause</v>

56
00:02:55.611 --> 00:03:00.611
<v Speaker 2>some people were complaining about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sound quality of my ipod or iphone</v>

57
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 2>recorded podcasts and someone from my</v>
<v Speaker 2>message board recommended this is pretty</v>

58
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 2>dope.</v>

59
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 2>I like how it hooks up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just hooks it up right to the base of</v>

60
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:10.380
<v Speaker 2>your iphones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

61
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 2>this might be the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is really your first time.</v>

62
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you're the one who's breaking into in</v>

<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are about,</v>

66
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.630

<v Speaker 2>we were about five miles,</v>

67
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 2>or excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five hours outside of Reno in this</v>

68
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:31.441
<v Speaker 2>incredibly beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>desolate landscape chasing these deer</v>

69
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 2>that have these ears that they're there.</v>

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 2>And Dan and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan was behind me with the camera and I</v>

73
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:48.664
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

74
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 2>being a clumsy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sneaky fuck,</v>

75
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 2>trying to sneak up on these things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just didn't work out.</v>

76
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:55.800
<v Speaker 2>But God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was fun trying to do,</v>

77
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.460
<v Speaker 2>we got clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got some good stuff.</v>

78
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got so close that it could have</v>

79
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 2>happened once one time.</v>

80
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 2>It legitimately could have happened the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time we got kind of close a few times.</v>

81
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.620
<v Speaker 2>But one time I got inside of 30 yards</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as I was crawling towards them in</v>

82
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 2>the bushes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made too much noise and they'd got up</v>

83
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 2>and bolted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

84
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two deer that were in,</v>

85
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.140
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is too many,</v>

86
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.150
<v Speaker 2>too many details and catch it on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

87
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 2>It's called meet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either it's on sportsman channel.</v>

88
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:26.380
<v Speaker 2>It's an excellent show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

89
00:04:26.381 --> 00:04:27.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

90
00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:30.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking trip has been really</v>

91
00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:31.090
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

92
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:34.660
<v Speaker 2>it's nice to be off the grid for seven</v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

93
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done that in awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn,</v>

94
00:04:36.941 --> 00:04:37.774
<v Speaker 2>that feels good.</v>

95
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.260
<v Speaker 2>When was the last time you did that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably last time I hung with you guys.</v>

96
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.310
<v Speaker 2>Probably Prince of Wales Moon with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

97
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.120
<v Speaker 2>that was not quite a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

98
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 2>it was miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was less or more miserable than,</v>

99
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is way more fun.</v>

100
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.890

<v Speaker 2>But I don't mind he,</v>

101
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.650
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't really bug me as long as we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have water.</v>

102
00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:02.680
<v Speaker 2>We had plenty of water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you just keep your skin covered.</v>

103
00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:03.514
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

104
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.680
<v Speaker 2>burst into flames.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

105
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:06.700
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

106
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.930
<v Speaker 2>I've done a lot of these mediators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I haven't been doing them lately.</v>

107
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.250
<v Speaker 2>The last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the first time I've been off</v>

108
00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:14.500
<v Speaker 2>grid and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

109
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:16.420
<v Speaker 2>a good long time too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it felt amazing.</v>

110
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.160
<v Speaker 2>The first three days just felt like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>vacation.</v>

111
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it made me realize like we're so</v>

112
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:27.410
<v Speaker 2>addicted to taking in information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least I am.</v>

113
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.820
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so addicted to checking the news and</v>

114
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:34.000
<v Speaker 2>finding out what's going on in the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we just,</v>

115
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.520
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of times,</v>

116
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.890
<v Speaker 2>doesn't give you a chance to use your</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain and think about what you actually</v>

117
00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:44.380
<v Speaker 2>feel about things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't get a chance.</v>

118
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.410
<v Speaker 2>You're just so wrapped up in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paying attention to all the news and all</v>

119
00:05:49.571 --> 00:05:54.340
<v Speaker 2>the information and all the stuff that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>being fed to you constantly through the</v>

120
00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:56.980
<v Speaker 2>media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through social media networks,</v>

121
00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>

122
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.530
<v Speaker 2>just everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just too much.</v>

123
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.120
<v Speaker 2>I tried to keep my phone off for four</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours at a time during the days,</v>

124
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.700
<v Speaker 2>even if I'm working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nice.</v>

125
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Just try to shut and put it on airplane</v>
<v Speaker 2>mode,</v>

126
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.450
<v Speaker 2>put it away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just step away from it as much as I</v>

127
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:12.201
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

128
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 2>my friend Ari got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do what he did,</v>

129
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 2>but what he did was he switched to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>flip phone.</v>

130
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.730
<v Speaker 2>A smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

131
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:20.643
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sue said,</v>

132
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 2>enough said enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it.</v>

133
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 2>I need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like having the phone.</v>

134
00:06:25.581 --> 00:06:27.260
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had a flip phone,</v>

135
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:30.710
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be recording a podcast right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now cause I need a fucking iphone for</v>

136
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the first thing you do in the</v>

137
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:32.900
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you wake up,</v>

138
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.230
<v Speaker 2>you check your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it shouldn't,</v>

139
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.600
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is for me using it,</v>

140
00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't help it.</v>

141
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.770
<v Speaker 2>I try not to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I've been trying to do lately,</v>

142
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:45.700
<v Speaker 2>I checked my phone to make sure nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>important is going on like a,</v>

143
00:06:45.701 --> 00:06:49.640
<v Speaker 2>I'll look at my text messages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure that they're okay.</v>

144
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.330
<v Speaker 2>Nothing's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one,</v>

145
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.470
<v Speaker 2>no nine one one calls or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then uh,</v>

146
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.990
<v Speaker 2>then I just try to start my day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I used to,</v>

147
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.570
<v Speaker 2>I used to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to hit it hard for like an hour</v>

148
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.900
<v Speaker 2>check the news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>check all the bullshit,</v>

149
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.010
<v Speaker 2>check my twitter feed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>check all the lakes people post me,</v>

150
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.110
<v Speaker 2>check what I'm supposed to be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>check this,</v>

151
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:09.944
<v Speaker 2>check that.</v>

152
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to do that anymore.</v>

153
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent a fair amount of time off the</v>

154
00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:18.860
<v Speaker 2>grid and in this connected like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the past 10 years.</v>

155
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.860
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird kind of addiction because</v>

156
00:07:21.861 --> 00:07:23.990
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what I felt so when we</v>

157
00:07:23.991 --> 00:07:26.030
<v Speaker 2>got out here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it had been a long time since I'd been</v>

158
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:27.470
<v Speaker 2>offered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we got out here and it was like,</v>

159
00:07:27.471 --> 00:07:29.360
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is great.</v>

160
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.250
<v Speaker 2>It's good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quiet.</v>

161
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Speaker 2>I think we're doing something weird to</v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves by constantly being connected</v>

162
00:07:36.501 --> 00:07:41.000
<v Speaker 2>to everything and everyone and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's terrified to be disconnected,</v>

163
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.920
<v Speaker 2>terrified to take a week off of just</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing coming in,</v>

164
00:07:45.921 --> 00:07:48.410
<v Speaker 2>but your own thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

165
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:50.600
<v Speaker 2>the actual world that you see in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your face,</v>

166
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.660
<v Speaker 2>which is not what we get a lot of times</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't,</v>

167
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.700
<v Speaker 2>I've been talking about that a lot is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a real problem with getting</v>

168
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:03.701
<v Speaker 2>all the bummer news from 7 billion</v>
<v Speaker 2>people all over the world because you</v>

169
00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:08.960
<v Speaker 2>get a distorted perception of what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on in the world because you're,</v>

170
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.820
<v Speaker 2>you're connected to everything that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening all the time,</v>

171
00:08:13.821 --> 00:08:15.860
<v Speaker 2>24 seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime,</v>

172
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Speaker 2>anytime anything fucked up goes down.</v>

173
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.830
<v Speaker 2>You hear about it instantly and it just</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives you this,</v>

174
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.270
<v Speaker 2>this feeling that the world has fallen</v>
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>

175
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.750
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the time nothing is happening</v>

176
00:08:26.751 --> 00:08:28.790
<v Speaker 2>where most people are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the pre,</v>

177
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.250
<v Speaker 2>pre iphones or pre these kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>phones.</v>

178
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.740
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really did disconnect from,</v>

179
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.690
<v Speaker 2>from news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't watch news.</v>

180
00:08:35.691 --> 00:08:36.760
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

181
00:08:36.761 --> 00:08:39.010
<v Speaker 2>Nick didn't do all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

182
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 2>there's no active claim that anymore and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way that,</v>

183
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it would extract myself</v>
<v Speaker 2>from that stream of information now</v>

184
00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:49.460
<v Speaker 2>because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is everywhere.</v>

185
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't open one web browser or</v>

186
00:08:51.651 --> 00:08:54.260
<v Speaker 2>anything without seeing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

187
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a</v>

188
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.510
<v Speaker 3>hard time with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

189
00:08:57.511 --> 00:08:59.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like to know.</v>

190
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.120
<v Speaker 3>And now I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lately I feel responsible.</v>

191
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.850
<v Speaker 3>Lately I feel more responsible that I do</v>
<v Speaker 3>need to know.</v>

192
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's about managing it,</v>

193
00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the big thing is managing</v>

194
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:12.480
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you know,</v>

195
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:15.750
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to completely disconnect</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself from the world,</v>

196
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.290
<v Speaker 3>but just connect sometimes and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

197
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:23.220
<v Speaker 3>and know when you're getting too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'll go down those,</v>

198
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.770
<v Speaker 3>you ever go down one of those youtube</v>
<v Speaker 3>rabbit holes?</v>

199
00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:30.480
<v Speaker 3>We watch one video on big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

200
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's four hours later.</v>

201
00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.980
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck just happened?</v>

202
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.680
<v Speaker 3>Interviewed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've watched several people get eaten</v>

203
00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 3>by crocodiles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I watched this thing,</v>

204
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.550
<v Speaker 3>the top crocodile attacks of 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

205
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why am I watching this?</v>

206
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.570
<v Speaker 3>There are good ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

207
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.370
<v Speaker 3>really good ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's awful.</v>

208
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.200
<v Speaker 3>It's just awful to support assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a noisy,</v>

209
00:09:55.201 --> 00:09:57.180
<v Speaker 3>it's noisy life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a busy life.</v>

210
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:01.060
<v Speaker 3>And to me it's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the business that I can second more</v>

211
00:10:01.061 --> 00:10:05.580
<v Speaker 3>than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a constant pushing it to everything</v>

212
00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:07.680
<v Speaker 3>that's going on to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's for a hunter,</v>

213
00:10:07.681 --> 00:10:09.420
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason of getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>disconnected.</v>

214
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.600
<v Speaker 3>That is the part that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

215
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:13.881
<v Speaker 3>I dunno it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

216
00:10:13.881 --> 00:10:16.560
<v Speaker 3>that that's what light that lights me up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and makes me happy just to,</v>

217
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:21.970
<v Speaker 3>just to fucking settle down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like don't have things to do always.</v>

218
00:10:21.971 --> 00:10:24.120
<v Speaker 3>And always be going somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always doing something.</v>

219
00:10:24.121 --> 00:10:27.990
<v Speaker 3>And I try to live a pretty relaxed life</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

220
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.210
<v Speaker 3>but I mean it seems too busy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

221
00:10:30.211 --> 00:10:32.750
<v Speaker 3>you were taken into a whole nother level</v>
<v Speaker 3>this weekend.</v>

222
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.650
<v Speaker 3>You were talking about one day one and</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go to the mountain by yourself for 40</v>

223
00:10:37.651 --> 00:10:38.370
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

224
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:39.780
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love to do that.</v>

225
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:40.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would,</v>

226
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I will do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do a lot of meditation and then in the</v>

227
00:10:45.181 --> 00:10:48.600
<v Speaker 3>lineage of meditation that I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of a solo practice are</v>

228
00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:52.650
<v Speaker 3>basically solo retreat where you go</v>
<v Speaker 3>either in a cabin or out of the woods or</v>

229
00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:54.750
<v Speaker 3>whatever you or whatever you want to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you just,</v>

230
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.030
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just there by yourself doing your</v>

231
00:10:57.031 --> 00:11:00.180
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I have not had a chance to do that</v>

232
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:01.680
<v Speaker 3>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also used to,</v>

233
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.100
<v Speaker 3>when I used to be a wilderness guide and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would run programs for people,</v>

234
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.770
<v Speaker 3>they would always do a solo at the end</v>
<v Speaker 3>of their wilderness experience to sit</v>

235
00:11:08.771 --> 00:11:11.070
<v Speaker 3>down in the woods all alone by</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>

236
00:11:11.071 --> 00:11:12.120
<v Speaker 3>four days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six days,</v>

237
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.640
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

238
00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:15.171
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

239
00:11:15.171 --> 00:11:17.430
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not something I think that most</v>

240
00:11:17.431 --> 00:11:18.420
<v Speaker 3>people are drawn to.</v>

241
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's a type of thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that um,</v>

242
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:23.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is a weird thing for people</v>

243
00:11:23.881 --> 00:11:26.760
<v Speaker 3>in our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's something massively</v>

244
00:11:26.761 --> 00:11:31.700
<v Speaker 3>valuable to be gained by that just self</v>
<v Speaker 3>now and self experience.</v>

245
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:33.360
<v Speaker 3>Just this reflection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

246
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.120
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well reflection but then also</v>

247
00:11:36.121 --> 00:11:38.190
<v Speaker 3>exploration I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

248
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.230
<v Speaker 3>have your own thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man.</v>

249
00:11:40.231 --> 00:11:44.280
<v Speaker 3>And like what's actually there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what's really inside you?</v>

250
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:44.731
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

251
00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:46.310
<v Speaker 3>what really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

252
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.400
<v Speaker 3>disconnected from all the input of</v>
<v Speaker 3>information and the need to go and do</v>

253
00:11:50.401 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 3>stuff and the need to say stuff but just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fucking be</v>

254
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.330
<v Speaker 2>there with what's going on with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

255
00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

256
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the isolation tank and you and I have</v>

257
00:12:01.691 --> 00:12:03.200
<v Speaker 2>talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

258
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.950
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's weird is when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell people about it,</v>

259
00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.100
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had many people says to me,</v>

260
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be alone with my</v>

261
00:12:10.451 --> 00:12:11.470
<v Speaker 2>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

262
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:12.790
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

263
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.380
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to be alone with your</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts.</v>

264
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.940
<v Speaker 2>You want to know how you really feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>about things and explore whether or not</v>

265
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.350
<v Speaker 2>you're right about things are wrong or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you have a bias or</v>

266
00:12:23.351 --> 00:12:25.840
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you have some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>preconceived notion.</v>

267
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I've found that a</v>

268
00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:33.781
<v Speaker 2>lot of people do is they have an opinion</v>
<v Speaker 2>on something and then when confronted</v>

269
00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:37.540
<v Speaker 2>with new evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do their damnest to try to defend</v>

270
00:12:37.541 --> 00:12:39.380
<v Speaker 2>that original opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dig again.</v>

271
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could do it again and they fucked</v>

272
00:12:41.741 --> 00:12:44.620
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta be able to be flexible with</v>

273
00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:46.450
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ideas or not you.</v>

274
00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.353
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

275
00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:48.920
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

276
00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.990
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea of like going out to</v>

277
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.880
<v Speaker 3>mountain and being there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me it's about,</v>

278
00:12:52.881 --> 00:12:57.881
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a disconnect in our</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture from the actual experience and</v>

279
00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.250
<v Speaker 3>however you want to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your actual physical experience that</v>

280
00:13:01.251 --> 00:13:06.010
<v Speaker 3>you're having in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the actual emotional experience or the</v>

281
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:11.060
<v Speaker 3>even even mental experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's so much controlling</v>

282
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:12.890
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

283
00:13:12.891 --> 00:13:15.680
<v Speaker 3>we control ourselves or other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the other forces control us.</v>

284
00:13:15.681 --> 00:13:20.450
<v Speaker 3>But the actual sitting in what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually happening is to me the most</v>

285
00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.680
<v Speaker 3>compelling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

286
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.670
<v Speaker 3>part of being alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's a lot of ways that</v>

287
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.050
<v Speaker 3>people go about doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

288
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.900
<v Speaker 3>but it is challenging and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not something that,</v>

289
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.070
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

290
00:13:34.071 --> 00:13:35.270
<v Speaker 3>People,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it scares the shit out.</v>

291
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:35.840
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

292
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.550
<v Speaker 3>Because it is scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

293
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:38.720
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's intense life.</v>

294
00:13:38.721 --> 00:13:40.280
<v Speaker 3>Some tense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

295
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.780
<v Speaker 2>so you actually have to confront what</v>
<v Speaker 2>life is when,</v>

296
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.210
<v Speaker 2>when nothing else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

297
00:13:45.211 --> 00:13:47.880
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're really just thinking alone</v>

298
00:13:47.881 --> 00:13:49.720
<v Speaker 2>by yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing else is occupying thoughts,</v>

299
00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.140
<v Speaker 2>not a television show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not an album.</v>

300
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.330
<v Speaker 2>You're a law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those things are great too,</v>

301
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.360
<v Speaker 2>but to be alone with your thoughts.</v>

302
00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.130
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I actually,</v>

303
00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:02.800
<v Speaker 3>and I think it extends to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to being with other people too.</v>

304
00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:06.280
<v Speaker 3>Like if I think there is something to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>practicing,</v>

305
00:14:06.281 --> 00:14:08.800
<v Speaker 3>being able to be present in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience that's happening.</v>

306
00:14:08.801 --> 00:14:11.110
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that different spiritual</v>

307
00:14:11.111 --> 00:14:13.720
<v Speaker 3>traditions are searching for that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>

308
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:19.330
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of different things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people do to try to feel better and do</v>

309
00:14:19.331 --> 00:14:20.470
<v Speaker 3>better at life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

310
00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:21.250
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

311
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.160
<v Speaker 3>the practice of doing it yourself I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think is one thing.</v>

312
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:25.620
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

313
00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.960
<v Speaker 3>I think an even more challenging thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>is sort of that sort of,</v>

314
00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rodness or,</v>

315
00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:34.300
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or simplicity or even connection with</v>

316
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.510
<v Speaker 3>somebody else presidencies even fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>harder.</v>

317
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:41.520
<v Speaker 3>So I actually think it opens up with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>way of living life that is a,</v>

318
00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.580
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating and really exciting.</v>

319
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And an important point about being alone</v>

320
00:14:47.981 --> 00:14:49.900
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when you're around other people,</v>

321
00:14:49.901 --> 00:14:53.390
<v Speaker 2>other people influence your thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they influence what you feel,</v>

322
00:14:53.391 --> 00:14:56.960
<v Speaker 2>the influenced the way you react to</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and to be alone.</v>

323
00:14:56.961 --> 00:14:59.480
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of that to be alone in</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

324
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.360
<v Speaker 2>That's what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really interesting.</v>

325
00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:06.140
<v Speaker 2>That's really interesting to me because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a tornado out there.</v>

326
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a dusty twister dust bin over</v>

327
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.210
<v Speaker 2>the call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went to that cross.</v>

328
00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.860
<v Speaker 2>God Damn Tornado,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I better run for the hills.</v>

329
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.200
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what hit us like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

330
00:15:18.201 --> 00:15:20.020
<v Speaker 2>before we came into Austin and we've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>swiped,</v>

331
00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:24.500
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got hit by this huge Austin,</v>

332
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.210
<v Speaker 2>Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

333
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.320
<v Speaker 2>not Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>

334
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.390
<v Speaker 2>I thought you locked doors too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

335
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.250
<v Speaker 2>I like Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>

336
00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.780
<v Speaker 2>I Hate Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevada.</v>

337
00:15:32.781 --> 00:15:35.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm just fucking around phones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

338
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.010
<v Speaker 2>but the place where we are at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

339
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.090
<v Speaker 2>is particularly unusual kind of nature</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it's,</v>

340
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.360
<v Speaker 2>it's desert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's uh,</v>

341
00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.640
<v Speaker 2>it's got these sage plants everywhere.</v>

342
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.730
<v Speaker 2>We should really smell awesome when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>step on them and break them.</v>

343
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.380
<v Speaker 2>They have this cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

344
00:15:51.381 --> 00:15:54.710
<v Speaker 2>say he just got a great smell to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have this,</v>

345
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.630
<v Speaker 2>the sage plants all over the place in</v>
<v Speaker 2>these very small shrubs,</v>

346
00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.390
<v Speaker 2>occasional trees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that many,</v>

347
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.320
<v Speaker 2>but mostly like these like six foot high</v>
<v Speaker 2>and most shrubs.</v>

348
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.570
<v Speaker 2>And there was a few of those trees like</v>
<v Speaker 2>those cedars and there's a,</v>

349
00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.660
<v Speaker 2>and these red Mahogany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

350
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:16.880
<v Speaker 2>it's high desert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So high elevation desert please.</v>

351
00:16:16.881 --> 00:16:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Big massive basins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flat basis with,</v>

352
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:20.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty,</v>

353
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:23.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sharp and tall mountains.</v>

354
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

355
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.070
<v Speaker 2>each of these basins in the valley and</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to what,</v>

356
00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:30.710
<v Speaker 2>what was it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12,500 or 13,000 feet?</v>

357
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:32.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just above where we were hunting.</v>

358
00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.740
<v Speaker 2>We were really high up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were above 9,000 feet and there's a</v>

359
00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:42.250
<v Speaker 2>rock slides everywhere where like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the side of the mountains are eroding</v>

360
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:47.500
<v Speaker 2>and we had to climb up that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all these like chunks of rock and</v>

361
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:51.200
<v Speaker 2>especially problematic when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to sneak up on these fucking</v>

362
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:56.000
<v Speaker 2>awesome hearing mule deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause everything's like clank client.</v>

363
00:16:56.001 --> 00:16:58.160
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're stepping on broken pottery</v>

364
00:16:58.161 --> 00:17:00.170
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just weird.</v>

365
00:17:00.171 --> 00:17:02.390
<v Speaker 2>It almost looks like somebody made it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

366
00:17:02.391 --> 00:17:04.940
<v Speaker 2>when you see all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like somebody decided to make like</v>

367
00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:08.690
<v Speaker 2>a giant runway filled with broken chips</v>
<v Speaker 2>of rock.</v>

368
00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.260
<v Speaker 2>Just really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really cool.</v>

369
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.470
<v Speaker 2>But just like an alien landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been to uh,</v>

370
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.120
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

371
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.340
<v Speaker 2>the high country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the desert up there before.</v>

372
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.700
<v Speaker 2>So for me it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a first and it was also,</v>

373
00:17:22.701 --> 00:17:25.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

374
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.250
<v Speaker 2>it's beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

375
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:30.680
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to live there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

376
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.150
<v Speaker 2>it's cool to visit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

377
00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:34.280
<v Speaker 2>it's like one of those things I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to,</v>

378
00:17:34.281 --> 00:17:36.770
<v Speaker 2>I'll dry it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my only beef with it.</v>

379
00:17:36.771 --> 00:17:38.450
<v Speaker 2>I think it is beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

380
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:44.300
<v Speaker 2>it just looks like it needs a bath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's interesting too because it's so</v>

381
00:17:44.301 --> 00:17:48.530
<v Speaker 2>perfect for these deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deer everywhere up there and they're</v>

382
00:17:48.531 --> 00:17:53.250
<v Speaker 2>fucking big and fat and healthy and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing is eating these sage</v>

383
00:17:53.251 --> 00:17:57.630
<v Speaker 2>bushes and then taking naps and running</v>
<v Speaker 2>from mountain lions and shit.</v>

384
00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:02.640
<v Speaker 2>Cause we found some big thick ropes of</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit there were filled with hair that is</v>

385
00:18:02.641 --> 00:18:07.641
<v Speaker 2>either a giant fucking coyote or most</v>
<v Speaker 2>likely a mountain lion or maybe bear.</v>

386
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.910
<v Speaker 2>That one seemed way too big to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>coyote's.</v>

387
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.820
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

388
00:18:11.821 --> 00:18:13.140
<v Speaker 2>that was a mount lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

389
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.033
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

390
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.980
<v Speaker 2>Woke up one more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buy a pack of coyotes around us.</v>

391
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How they were fucking scream and they</v>

392
00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:23.880
<v Speaker 2>sounded so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was screaming.</v>

393
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:28.010
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We only saw a deer and uh,</v>

394
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.890
<v Speaker 2>we saw a couple of coyotes or scanning</v>
<v Speaker 2>the horizon.</v>

395
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:36.360
<v Speaker 2>But the landscape for people is death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you lived out there,</v>

396
00:18:36.361 --> 00:18:38.430
<v Speaker 2>you'd be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

397
00:18:38.431 --> 00:18:41.460
<v Speaker 2>you never catch one of these deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he had a rifle,</v>

398
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.200
<v Speaker 2>you have a really good chance because</v>
<v Speaker 2>for some reason they know your bow</v>

399
00:18:46.201 --> 00:18:51.201
<v Speaker 2>hunting so they stay and like one 61 70</v>
<v Speaker 2>yards and just fucking stare at you.</v>

400
00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.020
<v Speaker 2>But anything you get inside of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

401
00:18:55.021 --> 00:18:57.460
<v Speaker 2>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be dear.</v>

402
00:18:57.461 --> 00:19:01.290
<v Speaker 2>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did we get within a hundred yards of</v>

403
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.510
<v Speaker 2>like maybe two groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two groups?</v>

404
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:08.540
<v Speaker 2>The first day we got inside of 30 and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have had a shot if it wasn't for</v>

405
00:19:08.831 --> 00:19:12.030
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We only had a tag for a buck.</v>

406
00:19:12.031 --> 00:19:15.060
<v Speaker 2>I should probably explain what a tag is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're hung on public land.</v>

407
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.420
<v Speaker 2>Do you may not know this because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people don't,</v>

408
00:19:18.421 --> 00:19:21.870
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't until I started hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>

409
00:19:21.871 --> 00:19:26.871
<v Speaker 2>the people of the United States of</v>
<v Speaker 2>America own massive chunks of land is</v>

410
00:19:27.391 --> 00:19:31.260
<v Speaker 2>your land is my land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that song,</v>

411
00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.000
<v Speaker 2>this land is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that.</v>

412
00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.240
<v Speaker 2>But it really is that it's not just in</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory,</v>

413
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.600
<v Speaker 2>it's public land and it's rare because</v>
<v Speaker 2>most countries don't have what we have.</v>

414
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:47.300
<v Speaker 2>We have these giant chunks of forest</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can hunt in and you could fish</v>

415
00:19:47.941 --> 00:19:50.520
<v Speaker 2>in and you can hike in and you can camp</v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

416
00:19:50.521 --> 00:19:53.670
<v Speaker 2>You can do all these different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to hunting them.</v>

417
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing that people don't know,</v>

418
00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.930
<v Speaker 2>especially people that are like down on</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting,</v>

419
00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:02.370
<v Speaker 2>is it hunting is closely regulated by</v>
<v Speaker 2>wildlife agencies.</v>

420
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:07.370
<v Speaker 2>That's manned by biologists that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>working on science and data for that</v>

421
00:20:08.611 --> 00:20:11.340
<v Speaker 2>particular area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the area where we were at,</v>

422
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.310
<v Speaker 2>it's not that easy to get a tag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Steve Rinella,</v>

423
00:20:14.311 --> 00:20:17.580
<v Speaker 2>how to use his points to get me in there</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

424
00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:22.980
<v Speaker 2>And what points are as you put in for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tag you have to put in every year and it</v>

425
00:20:22.981 --> 00:20:26.130
<v Speaker 2>takes like a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you can hunt in this place,</v>

426
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.310
<v Speaker 2>you could probably only hunt here like</v>
<v Speaker 2>every three years.</v>

427
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.280
<v Speaker 2>But there's other places like the Nevada</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strip,</v>

428
00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.170
<v Speaker 2>which is on the Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevada border.</v>

429
00:20:34.171 --> 00:20:37.260
<v Speaker 2>That is so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some strip that's in Nevada,</v>

430
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arizona Strip,</v>

431
00:20:38.761 --> 00:20:40.530
<v Speaker 2>which is on the border of Arizona and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Utah,</v>

432
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.230
<v Speaker 2>which is the most cherished place for</v>
<v Speaker 2>mule deer.</v>

433
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:47.590
<v Speaker 2>Where you can only hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like once in your life.</v>

434
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.480
<v Speaker 2>Like literally it takes like 20 plus</v>
<v Speaker 2>years to get a tag like area.</v>

435
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.150
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a 13 v.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

436
00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:59.290
<v Speaker 2>So it's supposed to be the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these places,</v>

437
00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

438
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.780
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot of people there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we were like,</v>

439
00:21:04.781 --> 00:21:07.540
<v Speaker 2>we saw a few people while we were there</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were also hunting.</v>

440
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.000
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shout out to James Kawasaki.</v>

441
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.560
<v Speaker 2>It gave us some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

442
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.400
<v Speaker 2>some great tips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We met a really cool dude from Hawaii,</v>

443
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:18.730
<v Speaker 2>James Kawasaki.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We found him a hunting up there and he</v>

444
00:21:18.731 --> 00:21:21.720
<v Speaker 2>gave us some good tips about where to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>and study.</v>

445
00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:25.480
<v Speaker 2>Know he's such a fucking good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's cool when you meet someone like</v>

446
00:21:25.481 --> 00:21:27.250
<v Speaker 2>that is doing the same thing that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

447
00:21:27.251 --> 00:21:29.200
<v Speaker 2>And then he was leaving and we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>comments,</v>

448
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:30.700
<v Speaker 2>be able for generous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

449
00:21:30.701 --> 00:21:33.880
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a guy who was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to give you information,</v>

450
00:21:33.881 --> 00:21:35.230
<v Speaker 2>which happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

451
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get people that want to hoard,</v>

452
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:38.590
<v Speaker 2>hoard their honey holes.</v>

453
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:42.100
<v Speaker 2>But he gave us all this information so</v>
<v Speaker 2>it still doesn't help.</v>

454
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.720
<v Speaker 2>That's probably why he gave us the</v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

455
00:21:43.721 --> 00:21:44.554
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but shit,</v>

456
00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.930
<v Speaker 2>he ain't get county thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for us,</v>

457
00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.270
<v Speaker 2>trip Nevada folk have been incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>generous.</v>

458
00:21:49.271 --> 00:21:53.290
<v Speaker 2>He was doing this and we're uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're right behind a truck pulling a</v>

459
00:21:53.291 --> 00:21:55.630
<v Speaker 2>trailer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that belongs to remy Warren and his</v>

460
00:21:55.631 --> 00:21:57.580
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they just hooked us up.</v>

461
00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.340
<v Speaker 2>The stuff in the trailer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two trucks,</v>

462
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.970
<v Speaker 2>it was really incredibly generous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's the thing about Nevada,</v>

463
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.640
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's a big empty placement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe everybody's really,</v>

464
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:08.480
<v Speaker 2>I joke around about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

465
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.810
<v Speaker 2>that place being a drug addled Shill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

466
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.510
<v Speaker 2>I've met a lot of really nice people</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Nevada.</v>

467
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:16.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a bad reputation because vegas is</v>

468
00:22:16.901 --> 00:22:21.901
<v Speaker 2>linked to organized crime and gambling</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the other sorted shit that comes</v>

469
00:22:23.591 --> 00:22:25.270
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People think of it as like,</v>

470
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was horrible sin full place,</v>

471
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.850
<v Speaker 2>but that's just a small area of Nevada.</v>

472
00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Most of my friends that I know that live</v>
<v Speaker 2>around Vegas that are involved in like</v>

473
00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.200
<v Speaker 2>the MMA business there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking the nicest people in the</v>

474
00:22:38.201 --> 00:22:41.080
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they'll tell you like in Nevada is</v>

475
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.740
<v Speaker 2>like what's outside of the Strip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great town.</v>

476
00:22:44.741 --> 00:22:47.320
<v Speaker 2>Like Henderson Henderson's a great town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

477
00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.570
<v Speaker 2>It's really nice place to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real safe.</v>

478
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.090
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of good spots in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevada.</v>

479
00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.260
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

480
00:22:53.261 --> 00:22:56.150
<v Speaker 2>point being we're out here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

481
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.870
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

482
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:59.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just a really fascinating,</v>

483
00:22:59.441 --> 00:23:04.441
<v Speaker 2>interesting landscape to spend seven</v>
<v Speaker 2>days but bring a lot of fucking water,</v>

484
00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:10.000
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm impressed that you haven't been in a</v>

485
00:23:10.001 --> 00:23:12.040
<v Speaker 2>landscape like this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

486
00:23:12.041 --> 00:23:15.760
<v Speaker 2>this is what the majority of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>American West looks like.</v>

487
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:18.100
<v Speaker 2>It's Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

488
00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.130
<v Speaker 2>Flat with know bumpy mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of them.</v>

489
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

490
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:27.370
<v Speaker 2>the first place that we hunted in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Montana was a little like this when</v>

491
00:23:27.371 --> 00:23:28.170
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

492
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:31.780
<v Speaker 2>in the Missouri breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a right on the banks of the</v>

493
00:23:31.781 --> 00:23:32.650
<v Speaker 2>Missouri River.</v>

494
00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:34.720
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I got hooked.</v>

495
00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:39.820
<v Speaker 2>It's Goddamn Steve Rinella.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a little crack dealer with this</v>

496
00:23:39.821 --> 00:23:42.880
<v Speaker 2>hunting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gave me the first dose for free</v>

497
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.730
<v Speaker 2>and then he got me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's the same sort of feeling in the</v>

498
00:23:48.731 --> 00:23:53.731
<v Speaker 2>Missouri breaks is that feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 2>massiveness and also that you are</v>

499
00:23:55.761 --> 00:23:58.940
<v Speaker 2>completely insignificant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Invisible.</v>

500
00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The universe or the world,</v>

501
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:04.280
<v Speaker 2>the natural world around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really doesn't give a fuck.</v>

502
00:24:04.281 --> 00:24:07.940
<v Speaker 2>You could fall and smash your head open</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a rock and those wheel dear will</v>

503
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:10.040
<v Speaker 2>bounce on by you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like nothing happened.</v>

504
00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:11.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

505
00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.253
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

506
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:14.690
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing like that.</v>

507
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.830
<v Speaker 2>I think the place it's sunk that in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most was probably Prince of Wales,</v>

508
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:24.370
<v Speaker 2>so uninviting</v>
<v Speaker 2>Laska one of the harshest places I've</v>

509
00:24:25.101 --> 00:24:25.821
<v Speaker 2>been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

510
00:24:25.821 --> 00:24:27.630
<v Speaker 2>It's weird though because that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one's like heaven.</v>

511
00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.270
<v Speaker 2>Hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the sun comes out,</v>

512
00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.070
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to be anywhere else.</v>

513
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.740
<v Speaker 2>But then most of the year when it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>raining,</v>

514
00:24:33.741 --> 00:24:35.970
<v Speaker 2>because it does need most of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

515
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:37.580
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking miserable.</v>

516
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:42.290
<v Speaker 2>It rained every fucking day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were there all day and Dan Dodi was</v>

517
00:24:42.291 --> 00:24:43.910
<v Speaker 2>warning us before we went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

518
00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:45.260
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck that place.</v>

519
00:24:45.261 --> 00:24:47.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go back to that place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Steve and I was like,</v>

520
00:24:47.991 --> 00:24:49.740
<v Speaker 2>why you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that place,</v>

521
00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:50.953
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

522
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.630
<v Speaker 2>So I swore twice in my life I would not</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back and I broke that prompt us.</v>

523
00:24:55.910 --> 00:25:00.640
<v Speaker 2>But it is also just amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just so as far as the,</v>

524
00:25:00.641 --> 00:25:04.070
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the animals both under the water and</v>

525
00:25:04.071 --> 00:25:06.620
<v Speaker 2>above the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a rich rich environment.</v>

526
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.040
<v Speaker 2>Well then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also super unusual too.</v>

527
00:25:10.041 --> 00:25:12.620
<v Speaker 2>Like the way it looks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a rain forest.</v>

528
00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:14.060
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's close.</v>

529
00:25:14.061 --> 00:25:17.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's quite maybe parts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the island art,</v>

530
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:19.890
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to look that up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's like,</v>

531
00:25:19.891 --> 00:25:20.810
<v Speaker 2>he's a shit ton now.</v>

532
00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:23.570
<v Speaker 2>Both what it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it was really cool about it,</v>

533
00:25:23.571 --> 00:25:27.830
<v Speaker 2>there's a lake at the top that's so high</v>
<v Speaker 2>up that beavers don't go there,</v>

534
00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:31.190
<v Speaker 2>so you can drink right out of the lake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we would take our water bottles,</v>

535
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.950
<v Speaker 2>we just dip it in the lake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just drink right out of the way.</v>

536
00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:38.330
<v Speaker 2>So this place is almost the exact</v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite of that.</v>

537
00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:44.170
<v Speaker 2>Whereas that place is all just rain and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and lush greenery and the occasional</v>

538
00:25:46.821 --> 00:25:49.340
<v Speaker 2>sunshine pops through and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

539
00:25:49.341 --> 00:25:53.020
<v Speaker 2>look at this place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's shines like a green emerald.</v>

540
00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

541
00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.660
<v Speaker 2>To,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you rather get dropped off making</v>

542
00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:01.250
<v Speaker 2>keep here and there have to make it</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

543
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:03.740
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd probably make it better.</v>

544
00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:08.060
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't make it here naked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your skin would peel off.</v>

545
00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.713
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you could,</v>

546
00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.530
<v Speaker 2>you would be cold as fuck until he</v>
<v Speaker 2>figured out how to start a fire,</v>

547
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:14.420
<v Speaker 2>how to kill something and where it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>skin.</v>

548
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:17.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to set it up to be a large</v>

549
00:26:17.541 --> 00:26:18.374
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

550
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:21.230
<v Speaker 2>You have to kill a bunch of squirrels to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sew them together,</v>

551
00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.930
<v Speaker 2>make a Dick Holster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because</v>

552
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.560
<v Speaker 2>a lot of shit you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then again,</v>

553
00:26:27.561 --> 00:26:29.660
<v Speaker 2>if you just take it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means you don't even have a gun or</v>

554
00:26:29.661 --> 00:26:32.600
<v Speaker 2>a bow and Arrow and that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then those things are good,</v>

555
00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.970
<v Speaker 2>but I think that Prince of Wales was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the most profound of all the that</v>

556
00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:39.410
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I felt it.</v>

557
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:44.470
<v Speaker 2>The Missouri breaks that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that feeling of like complete Ditto,</v>

558
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.590
<v Speaker 2>not detachment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like it doesn't give a fuck.</v>

559
00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:52.350
<v Speaker 2>Then the landscape does not give a fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

560
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:57.370
<v Speaker 2>It's just completely oblivious to your</v>
<v Speaker 2>presence and it has existed in this form</v>

561
00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.210
<v Speaker 2>for thousands and thousands and</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years.</v>

562
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Did you get that feeling here too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

563
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:03.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

564
00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:03.690
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

565
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.970
<v Speaker 3>I was curious because both of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>aunts,</v>

566
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.430
<v Speaker 3>both of Missouri breaks the Alaska one</v>
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>

567
00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:10.710
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're a non motorized,</v>

568
00:27:10.711 --> 00:27:12.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like is there any breaks?</v>

569
00:27:12.151 --> 00:27:15.150
<v Speaker 3>We dropped the cars off and we voted and</v>
<v Speaker 3>truly,</v>

570
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.690
<v Speaker 3>you know you call that a true wilderness</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience and same thing with Prince of</v>

571
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:21.210
<v Speaker 3>Wales and we got dropped off by a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Andy,</v>

572
00:27:21.211 --> 00:27:23.610
<v Speaker 3>if we needed to get out there and in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>pitch,</v>

573
00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:25.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get out of there and a picture it</v>

574
00:27:25.741 --> 00:27:27.870
<v Speaker 3>would have been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was wondering if that was a little</v>

575
00:27:27.871 --> 00:27:29.630
<v Speaker 3>bit of the of the feeling you got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

576
00:27:29.631 --> 00:27:33.540
<v Speaker 3>there's a little bit more of an ominous</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting set of situations.</v>

577
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we had a truck that we would drive</v>

578
00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:40.830
<v Speaker 2>to the top of this hill and then for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>top of the hill we walked and fuck did</v>

579
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:45.831
<v Speaker 2>we walk Dan Dodi and I walked up hills</v>
<v Speaker 2>at Dai thousand foot elevation,</v>

580
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:51.000
<v Speaker 2>some steep fucking kills two hours and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours every day.</v>

581
00:27:51.001 --> 00:27:52.710
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was hurting.</v>

582
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.330
<v Speaker 2>But it was a great cardio though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome workout.</v>

583
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:03.480
<v Speaker 2>So you were telling me about these</v>
<v Speaker 2>wilderness trips that you take people</v>

584
00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:04.314
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

585
00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.510
<v Speaker 3>you like wilderness therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my,</v>

586
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.640
<v Speaker 3>my first job out of college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

587
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:14.020
<v Speaker 3>I had been living in Panama with my ex</v>
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend and we were moving to Utah</v>

588
00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:16.720
<v Speaker 3>and I just needed a job and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know what I was going to do.</v>

589
00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.350
<v Speaker 3>And</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to Craig's list and we</v>

590
00:28:20.351 --> 00:28:22.510
<v Speaker 3>looked at salt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the area around Salt Lake City and there</v>

591
00:28:22.511 --> 00:28:27.511
<v Speaker 3>was a job advertisement for a wilderness</v>
<v Speaker 3>guide or wilderness instructor.</v>

592
00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:30.550
<v Speaker 3>They called it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know this shit existed at that</v>

593
00:28:30.551 --> 00:28:31.061
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

594
00:28:31.061 --> 00:28:34.180
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a huge industry and most of it's</v>

595
00:28:34.181 --> 00:28:37.720
<v Speaker 3>in the western United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but their therapeutic wilderness</v>

596
00:28:37.721 --> 00:28:40.990
<v Speaker 3>programs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are tied to a bunch of therapeutic</v>

597
00:28:40.991 --> 00:28:43.720
<v Speaker 3>boarding schools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the most basic sense,</v>

598
00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:48.580
<v Speaker 3>there's kids from generally pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>wealthy families across the country that</v>

599
00:28:48.581 --> 00:28:51.400
<v Speaker 3>are having trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their parents don't know what to do and</v>

600
00:28:51.401 --> 00:28:53.740
<v Speaker 3>they'll send them away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

601
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:54.910
<v Speaker 3>as an intervention.</v>

602
00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:59.860
<v Speaker 3>And usually the intention just to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>these kids go to a boarding school where</v>

603
00:28:59.861 --> 00:29:03.910
<v Speaker 3>there's a therapeutic presence also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in order to get into those schools,</v>

604
00:29:03.911 --> 00:29:06.940
<v Speaker 3>those schools require a wilderness</v>
<v Speaker 3>stage.</v>

605
00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:07.810
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

606
00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:11.710
<v Speaker 3>so I worked for a program and went out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and,</v>

607
00:29:11.711 --> 00:29:13.150
<v Speaker 3>and just kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

608
00:29:13.151 --> 00:29:13.541
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

609
00:29:13.541 --> 00:29:14.374
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

610
00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.970
<v Speaker 3>the type of program where everything was</v>
<v Speaker 3>made by hands.</v>

611
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:20.350
<v Speaker 3>He got out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will given a half of an elk hide,</v>

612
00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:23.320
<v Speaker 3>you were given a knife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you were taught some of the</v>

613
00:29:23.321 --> 00:29:25.750
<v Speaker 3>basic skills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we had to make our own backpacks out</v>

614
00:29:25.751 --> 00:29:28.990
<v Speaker 3>of sticks and elk hide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would sew our own moccasins,</v>

615
00:29:28.991 --> 00:29:31.810
<v Speaker 3>we would do all that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then all the fire that we made,</v>

616
00:29:31.811 --> 00:29:33.950
<v Speaker 3>we had to make my hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

617
00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:35.590
<v Speaker 3>with a boat drill too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

618
00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:36.550
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

619
00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:38.260
<v Speaker 3>so it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was this amazing,</v>

620
00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.050
<v Speaker 3>it was really life changing for me</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I you,</v>

621
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:42.460
<v Speaker 3>I love the outdoors.</v>

622
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.130
<v Speaker 3>I love the wilderness and all that kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of stuff.</v>

623
00:29:44.131 --> 00:29:45.730
<v Speaker 3>And then I didn't know what I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do with my life,</v>

624
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:50.790
<v Speaker 3>but got out to this place where there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally walked out into the,</v>

625
00:29:50.891 --> 00:29:53.440
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks a lot like this where I work.</v>

626
00:29:53.441 --> 00:29:58.320
<v Speaker 3>So just these massive brown dry</v>
<v Speaker 3>wilderness areas and got out there in</v>

627
00:29:58.321 --> 00:30:00.210
<v Speaker 3>these groups of kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

628
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:04.600
<v Speaker 3>some of these kids would stay in these</v>
<v Speaker 3>programs for 90 to 120 days.</v>

629
00:30:04.601 --> 00:30:08.500
<v Speaker 3>And so literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and here's the part that I still very</v>

630
00:30:08.501 --> 00:30:11.800
<v Speaker 3>much don't agree with and I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that these programs would literally</v>

631
00:30:11.801 --> 00:30:15.150
<v Speaker 3>kidnap you out of your bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's companies of yelling,</v>

632
00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:16.053
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

633
00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's like,</v>

634
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:20.170
<v Speaker 3>you can do that for a job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can be kind of a heavier,</v>

635
00:30:20.171 --> 00:30:23.110
<v Speaker 3>a tough guy that literally goes for an</v>
<v Speaker 3>intervention,</v>

636
00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:28.140
<v Speaker 3>flies to a family's whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>takes the kid out of their bed and flies</v>

637
00:30:28.421 --> 00:30:30.340
<v Speaker 3>them and drop them in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wilderness.</v>

638
00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:31.203
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

639
00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.090
<v Speaker 3>as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's traumatic man.</v>

640
00:30:34.091 --> 00:30:35.790
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like you're,</v>

641
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:37.750
<v Speaker 3>how old are these kids?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually?</v>

642
00:30:37.751 --> 00:30:40.720
<v Speaker 3>14 to 19 is low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>19.</v>

643
00:30:40.721 --> 00:30:42.400
<v Speaker 3>That's an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

644
00:30:42.401 --> 00:30:43.990
<v Speaker 3>Well that's where it gets sketchy as</v>
<v Speaker 3>far.</v>

645
00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:48.280
<v Speaker 3>So that's sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I should say 14 to 18 and the</v>

646
00:30:48.281 --> 00:30:49.670
<v Speaker 3>adult too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

647
00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:53.540
<v Speaker 3>So they have ways to sort of override</v>
<v Speaker 3>the age system at,</v>

648
00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:55.270
<v Speaker 3>at times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

649
00:30:55.990 --> 00:31:00.760
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these programs are meant to sort of</v>

650
00:31:00.761 --> 00:31:05.170
<v Speaker 3>give the kid a chance to look at their</v>
<v Speaker 3>lives,</v>

651
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.620
<v Speaker 3>how they've been behaving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and an opportunity to just kind of like</v>

652
00:31:08.621 --> 00:31:10.810
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but reflect and sort of explore and</v>

653
00:31:10.811 --> 00:31:12.010
<v Speaker 3>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's,</v>

654
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.920
<v Speaker 3>there is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of good,</v>

655
00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.140
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of good that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it really does help people.</v>

656
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there,</v>

657
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.660
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of bad too.</v>

658
00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:24.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can ever imagine that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could literally kidnapped the kid</v>

659
00:31:24.371 --> 00:31:27.770
<v Speaker 3>out of your house and not fuck up the</v>
<v Speaker 3>trust you have with.</v>

660
00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:28.613
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

661
00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:31.450
<v Speaker 3>it's messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

662
00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:32.090
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>

663
00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:34.690
<v Speaker 3>so I did that for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started there and then I started</v>

664
00:31:34.691 --> 00:31:39.370
<v Speaker 3>working in a more state run sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>correctional programs.</v>

665
00:31:39.371 --> 00:31:43.510
<v Speaker 3>So for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I lead the trips in Minnesota that</v>

666
00:31:43.511 --> 00:31:44.344
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

667
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:49.500
<v Speaker 3>it was a 21 day sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was basically an alternative to a</v>

668
00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:52.900
<v Speaker 3>60 day Juvi sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically you steal a car,</v>

669
00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:55.900
<v Speaker 3>you could either go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the judge can either send you to Juvie</v>

670
00:31:55.901 --> 00:32:00.610
<v Speaker 3>for 60 days or send them to me and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd go on a a bad ass,</v>

671
00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:01.870
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

672
00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:05.200
<v Speaker 3>200 mile hiking trip or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely take that over at Juvi.</v>

673
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:06.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

674
00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.120
<v Speaker 3>but yet big for obvious reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then the other reasons too is that,</v>

675
00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.133
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

676
00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:16.140
<v Speaker 3>these programs are generally run by</v>
<v Speaker 3>really like grounded good people that</v>

677
00:32:17.591 --> 00:32:19.750
<v Speaker 3>treat people well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least the ones I always worked for.</v>

678
00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:24.810
<v Speaker 3>I worked for programs with really like</v>
<v Speaker 3>exemplary leadership and you know,</v>

679
00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:30.070
<v Speaker 3>I think what these kids could learn and</v>
<v Speaker 3>those programs as opposed to go into</v>

680
00:32:30.071 --> 00:32:32.340
<v Speaker 3>Juvie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

681
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:34.150
<v Speaker 3>being in the shit holes that doors are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a,</v>

682
00:32:34.151 --> 00:32:36.120
<v Speaker 3>it was a really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much better option,</v>

683
00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:37.360
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

684
00:32:37.361 --> 00:32:39.070
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine that's a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way better.</v>

685
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:44.100
<v Speaker 3>But just to kidnapping part is crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the states,</v>

686
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:49.430
<v Speaker 3>they've given up on discipline their</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids so much that they just say,</v>

687
00:32:49.431 --> 00:32:50.130
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

688
00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:51.830
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucked up raising this kid.</v>

689
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:56.840
<v Speaker 3>It's time to just electro shock therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jolt them with wilderness.</v>

690
00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.130
<v Speaker 3>Totally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>

691
00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:00.320
<v Speaker 3>And it's a long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slow,</v>

692
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.140
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable shock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 120 days in the desert like this</v>

693
00:33:04.141 --> 00:33:06.290
<v Speaker 3>and this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

694
00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.860
<v Speaker 3>So when you get these kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like if they're kidnapped,</v>

695
00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.100
<v Speaker 3>how many days into this kidnapping do</v>
<v Speaker 3>you meet them?</v>

696
00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:14.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>day one.</v>

697
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean the data right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

698
00:33:16.251 --> 00:33:18.120
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of programs have kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

699
00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.140
<v Speaker 3>an inbetween camps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you come in and maybe the first two</v>

700
00:33:21.141 --> 00:33:22.520
<v Speaker 3>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a halfway house.</v>

701
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:23.391
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

702
00:33:23.391 --> 00:33:27.020
<v Speaker 3>Like a wilderness halfway house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a base camp,</v>

703
00:33:27.021 --> 00:33:29.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like where you learn how to do some of</v>

704
00:33:29.301 --> 00:33:33.410
<v Speaker 3>the skills and maybe you start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the other thing is is there's</v>

705
00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:37.580
<v Speaker 3>relationships with and therapists have</v>
<v Speaker 3>these programs and that's how it works,</v>

706
00:33:37.581 --> 00:33:39.410
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's the people that work with the</v>

707
00:33:39.411 --> 00:33:42.770
<v Speaker 3>kids directly are like what I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which as an instructor,</v>

708
00:33:42.771 --> 00:33:47.590
<v Speaker 3>so it usually there'd be two of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two adults with a group of 10 kids and</v>

709
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.700
<v Speaker 3>it was all an all boy usually segregated</v>
<v Speaker 3>into,</v>

710
00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.720
<v Speaker 3>into male and female.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I pretty much just work with dudes</v>

711
00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:55.520
<v Speaker 3>for a long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>

712
00:33:55.521 --> 00:33:56.181
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>

713
00:33:56.181 --> 00:34:00.980
<v Speaker 3>So it's the instructors with lead the</v>
<v Speaker 3>days and you'd usually hike or float or</v>

714
00:34:00.981 --> 00:34:04.730
<v Speaker 3>whatever you do and you know most of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>day and then you would run,</v>

715
00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:06.380
<v Speaker 3>you call them.</v>

716
00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:11.030
<v Speaker 3>Circles are like processing things where</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody would use will really,</v>

717
00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:14.390
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it was came down to learning</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to communicate and communicating</v>

718
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:17.910
<v Speaker 3>honestly and openly as really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually I learned a lot by,</v>

719
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:20.930
<v Speaker 3>by being there doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then once a week or twice a week,</v>

720
00:34:20.931 --> 00:34:25.931
<v Speaker 3>a therapist would drop in somehow</v>
<v Speaker 3>magically and have therapy sessions with</v>

721
00:34:26.691 --> 00:34:27.770
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>

722
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:29.480
<v Speaker 3>So a therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't even know,</v>

723
00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:32.360
<v Speaker 3>well they developed a relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

724
00:34:32.361 --> 00:34:33.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they'd worked with him for,</v>

725
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:35.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three to four months that they were</v>

726
00:34:35.631 --> 00:34:39.580
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they became a pretty fluffy,</v>

727
00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:41.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>usually they became pretty close with</v>

728
00:34:41.911 --> 00:34:45.050
<v Speaker 3>the therapist too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So did that,</v>

729
00:34:45.051 --> 00:34:48.200
<v Speaker 3>did it stick with many of these kids</v>
<v Speaker 3>have so many questions,</v>

730
00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:50.190
<v Speaker 3>did it stick with them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like wait,</v>

731
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:52.550
<v Speaker 3>how many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that experience actually changed</v>

732
00:34:52.551 --> 00:34:53.990
<v Speaker 3>their life so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

733
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.370
<v Speaker 3>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good question.</v>

734
00:34:55.371 --> 00:34:58.130
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think anybody has the actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard numbers on that.</v>

735
00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.550
<v Speaker 3>Maybe some people are looking to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and they call that recidivism.</v>

736
00:35:01.551 --> 00:35:04.210
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if he ended up back in the morning</v>

737
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:09.370
<v Speaker 3>are um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know for a fact that I stay in contact</v>

738
00:35:10.491 --> 00:35:13.310
<v Speaker 3>with a ton of the kids that I worked</v>
<v Speaker 3>with just cause you know,</v>

739
00:35:13.311 --> 00:35:17.240
<v Speaker 3>we've got to know each other really well</v>
<v Speaker 3>and respect each other and became</v>

740
00:35:17.241 --> 00:35:21.710
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know I've seen the benefit</v>

741
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.000
<v Speaker 3>almost across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

742
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:28.460
<v Speaker 3>like good things learned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of growing up happened,</v>

743
00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of like a forced right rite of</v>

744
00:35:31.251 --> 00:35:32.330
<v Speaker 3>passage in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

745
00:35:32.331 --> 00:35:33.460
<v Speaker 3>the idea that forced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

746
00:35:33.461 --> 00:35:34.001
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

747
00:35:34.001 --> 00:35:38.360
<v Speaker 3>Read of passage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I don't agree with the forest a</v>

748
00:35:38.361 --> 00:35:40.140
<v Speaker 3>lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a bunch of those kids I could</v>

749
00:35:40.141 --> 00:35:45.141
<v Speaker 3>point to 12 right now that I know just</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of turned around and maybe went to</v>

750
00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:50.100
<v Speaker 3>college or didn't go to college but</v>
<v Speaker 3>ended up having good relationships with</v>

751
00:35:50.101 --> 00:35:53.040
<v Speaker 3>their family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are feeling good about life.</v>

752
00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:56.010
<v Speaker 3>But then there's probably far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>far,</v>

753
00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:59.460
<v Speaker 3>I know there's far more where that</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't necessarily happen.</v>

754
00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:02.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily think it was a bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>deal for them to go through that</v>

755
00:36:02.581 --> 00:36:03.840
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

756
00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:05.930
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

757
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:08.160
<v Speaker 3>it's not a cure all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what it does,</v>

758
00:36:08.161 --> 00:36:12.390
<v Speaker 3>I think it's self selects for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people who really do kind of want to</v>

759
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:16.410
<v Speaker 3>figure shit out cause it gives you a</v>
<v Speaker 3>break and time to do that.</v>

760
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.951
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

761
00:36:19.951 --> 00:36:21.240
<v Speaker 3>I wish I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I had more time.</v>

762
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.270
<v Speaker 2>How much resistance did you experience?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when these kids were getting</v>

763
00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.270
<v Speaker 2>kidnapped and all of a sudden they would</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to you?</v>

764
00:36:27.271 --> 00:36:29.610
<v Speaker 2>Like how many of them were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this,</v>

765
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.860
<v Speaker 2>get me home please?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mom.</v>

766
00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:32.970
<v Speaker 2>Many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

767
00:36:32.971 --> 00:36:33.691
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

768
00:36:33.691 --> 00:36:38.280
<v Speaker 2>30 40 50% of just like either shutting</v>
<v Speaker 2>down completely and not compliant with</v>

769
00:36:38.281 --> 00:36:39.300
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more,</v>

770
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>direct,</v>

771
00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.310
<v Speaker 2>direct sort of resistance or amy or</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

772
00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.880
<v Speaker 2>Most of those come around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's up?</v>

773
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Did they come around?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

774
00:36:49.051 --> 00:36:50.010
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

775
00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.770
<v Speaker 2>There's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only a couple folks,</v>

776
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:55.260
<v Speaker 2>a couple of dudes I ever knew that kept</v>
<v Speaker 2>it up,</v>

777
00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:56.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of had the,</v>

778
00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:59.340
<v Speaker 2>had the stamina to keep that up at some</v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

779
00:36:59.341 --> 00:37:00.121
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

780
00:37:00.121 --> 00:37:03.510
<v Speaker 2>it's just sort of like accepting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that you were there,</v>

781
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:05.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean cause fuck man,</v>

782
00:37:05.251 --> 00:37:08.820
<v Speaker 2>they get get literally dropped in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of a desert and you're told</v>

783
00:37:08.821 --> 00:37:12.690
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be there for three</v>
<v Speaker 2>months or four months at some point.</v>

784
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.960
<v Speaker 2>You either have to accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well not either.</v>

785
00:37:18.601 --> 00:37:20.300
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you just do just kind of,</v>

786
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:23.970
<v Speaker 2>you know face reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well for someone who's on a fucked up</v>

787
00:37:23.971 --> 00:37:27.600
<v Speaker 2>path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really might be one of the only ways</v>

788
00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:31.920
<v Speaker 2>to correct it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to give yourself that chance.</v>

789
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:35.670
<v Speaker 2>Like we were talking about being out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there in the desert,</v>

790
00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.870
<v Speaker 2>the high country and you get kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a little bit of a reset.</v>

791
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:44.550
<v Speaker 2>Like you get to relax and be alone with</v>
<v Speaker 2>your thoughts and just experience a</v>

792
00:37:44.551 --> 00:37:49.551
<v Speaker 2>completely different set of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the input of a set of data than</v>

793
00:37:51.091 --> 00:37:54.000
<v Speaker 2>you're used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're used to like certain kinds of data</v>

794
00:37:54.001 --> 00:37:56.760
<v Speaker 2>and the input.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for a lot of these kids they used to</v>

795
00:37:56.761 --> 00:38:01.320
<v Speaker 2>hanging around with fuck ups and being</v>
<v Speaker 2>around their asshole friends and doing</v>

796
00:38:01.321 --> 00:38:05.160
<v Speaker 2>stupid shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they get stuck in these patterns.</v>

797
00:38:05.161 --> 00:38:10.161
<v Speaker 2>These grooves get cut deep and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>momentum of their life and their past is</v>

798
00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:15.510
<v Speaker 2>incredibly difficult to escape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I was really excited to</v>

799
00:38:15.511 --> 00:38:17.130
<v Speaker 2>hear about this when you were telling me</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

800
00:38:17.131 --> 00:38:18.010
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh that,</v>

801
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:21.210
<v Speaker 2>that might work like for some people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

802
00:38:21.211 --> 00:38:21.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

803
00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.690
<v Speaker 2>and then you asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how many does it work for?</v>

804
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:29.720
<v Speaker 2>One of the tougher things is that even</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it does work,</v>

805
00:38:30.151 --> 00:38:33.710
<v Speaker 2>so say you yanked out of your home and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

806
00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:35.830
<v Speaker 2>like just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so your,</v>

807
00:38:35.831 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 2>your</v>

808
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:40.350
<v Speaker 3>home and your friends and your community</v>
<v Speaker 3>has so much to do with,</v>

809
00:38:40.351 --> 00:38:42.220
<v Speaker 3>with how you end up interacting in what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do.</v>

810
00:38:42.221 --> 00:38:46.990
<v Speaker 3>So even if you get sent away for four</v>
<v Speaker 3>months or even years to these programs</v>

811
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:50.890
<v Speaker 3>and then you may change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we pro club,</v>

812
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.800
<v Speaker 3>not even me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will change your a kickboard someone</v>

813
00:38:53.801 --> 00:38:56.830
<v Speaker 3>will change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then no matter how much you change</v>

814
00:38:56.831 --> 00:38:58.990
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go back to that situation that you</v>

815
00:38:58.991 --> 00:39:01.660
<v Speaker 3>came from the house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your family,</v>

816
00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:04.000
<v Speaker 3>just the culture that you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

817
00:39:04.001 --> 00:39:05.520
<v Speaker 3>is it hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

818
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:07.620
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to walk,</v>

819
00:39:07.621 --> 00:39:10.890
<v Speaker 3>to not slip back into old patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then also even just to fit in that</v>

820
00:39:10.891 --> 00:39:11.590
<v Speaker 3>site.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

821
00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:14.230
<v Speaker 3>that's what I've been working with kids</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Way Leon is that,</v>

822
00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:16.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go away and have these big experiences</v>

823
00:39:16.661 --> 00:39:18.280
<v Speaker 3>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they go home and mom and dad are</v>

824
00:39:18.281 --> 00:39:22.720
<v Speaker 3>still exactly how they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

825
00:39:22.721 --> 00:39:26.770
<v Speaker 3>as a try to be impartial.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I'm good at being</v>

826
00:39:26.771 --> 00:39:29.590
<v Speaker 3>impartial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I try looking in getting to know</v>

827
00:39:29.591 --> 00:39:31.660
<v Speaker 3>these kids and all the things that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>went through.</v>

828
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:37.830
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucking hard not to point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every finger had the family and the pen.</v>

829
00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:40.630
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's hard is that the parents were</v>

830
00:39:40.631 --> 00:39:44.860
<v Speaker 2>raised by equally fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's almost not even their fault.</v>

831
00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:46.000
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

832
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.580
<v Speaker 2>the line of blame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to do that,</v>

833
00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:50.740
<v Speaker 2>can go back and really long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the monkeys from the trees,</v>

834
00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:52.060
<v Speaker 2>if you believe in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

835
00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:55.960
<v Speaker 3>So that's the thing about a wilderness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a long intervention like that at</v>

836
00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.510
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what I meant about self</v>

837
00:39:57.511 --> 00:40:02.130
<v Speaker 3>select because it's possible for</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody who really wants to change</v>

838
00:40:02.131 --> 00:40:02.701
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

839
00:40:02.701 --> 00:40:05.190
<v Speaker 3>to change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to change the momentum of your family,</v>

840
00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:09.060
<v Speaker 3>to change the momentum of your past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes a lot of energy to do it.</v>

841
00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:13.260
<v Speaker 3>It takes like a lot of dedication,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of letting go of a bunch of stuff.</v>

842
00:40:13.261 --> 00:40:15.940
<v Speaker 3>But it really is a pretty amazing thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

843
00:40:15.941 --> 00:40:19.260
<v Speaker 3>to be a part of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that kind of experience does</v>

844
00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:22.140
<v Speaker 3>facilitate that sort of thing if one</v>

845
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:23.730
<v Speaker 2>wants to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then like I said,</v>

846
00:40:23.731 --> 00:40:25.150
<v Speaker 2>once you get home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't give you,</v>

847
00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.330
<v Speaker 2>it's not like it gets easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

848
00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.450
<v Speaker 2>you certainly can grow a lot and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>change a lot.</v>

849
00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.850
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like we need that for</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents too.</v>

850
00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

851
00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>

852
00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:36.930
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

853
00:40:36.931 --> 00:40:41.931
<v Speaker 2>parenting is a very bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of a,</v>

854
00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:48.900
<v Speaker 2>it's incredibly complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very difficult to do.</v>

855
00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:53.760
<v Speaker 2>And it's an unbelievably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she neutra responsibility to be in</v>

856
00:40:53.761 --> 00:40:58.761
<v Speaker 2>charge of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the really the future of a life and all</v>

857
00:41:00.121 --> 00:41:04.860
<v Speaker 2>the people that life is going to touch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're using your son is you want</v>

858
00:41:04.861 --> 00:41:09.120
<v Speaker 2>to grow up and all the things that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>teach him and all the experiences that</v>

859
00:41:09.121 --> 00:41:12.870
<v Speaker 2>he has with you will reflect on how he</v>
<v Speaker 2>interacts with other people.</v>

860
00:41:12.871 --> 00:41:17.871
<v Speaker 2>And that ripple effect carries on to</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands and millions of people</v>

861
00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:18.930
<v Speaker 2>potentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

862
00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:22.920
<v Speaker 2>it's incredibly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so much responsibility and it's</v>

863
00:41:22.921 --> 00:41:26.040
<v Speaker 2>incredibly difficult to do correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no fucking,</v>

864
00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.620
<v Speaker 2>there's no requirements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody could do it.</v>

865
00:41:28.621 --> 00:41:30.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like one of the most important</v>

866
00:41:30.361 --> 00:41:34.370
<v Speaker 2>things in the world is to raise a person</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's to affect other people in a</v>

867
00:41:34.371 --> 00:41:36.150
<v Speaker 2>positive way and</v>

868
00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:41.380
<v Speaker 3>so fucking hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So hard to do and yet so easy to be in</v>

869
00:41:44.121 --> 00:41:46.740
<v Speaker 3>that position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you have to do is fuck it.</v>

870
00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:47.990
<v Speaker 3>Everybody fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

871
00:41:47.991 --> 00:41:49.680
<v Speaker 3>I can't stop thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

872
00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my boy was born two months ago.</v>

873
00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:56.360
<v Speaker 3>My first kid and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel all of a sudden saddled with this</v>

874
00:41:56.361 --> 00:41:58.400
<v Speaker 3>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

875
00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:01.280
<v Speaker 3>it actually just go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going bond beyond him.</v>

876
00:42:01.281 --> 00:42:02.440
<v Speaker 3>I feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

877
00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:07.310
<v Speaker 3>I just think I feel so much less of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>narcissist than I ever have that just</v>

878
00:42:07.311 --> 00:42:11.600
<v Speaker 3>that it's not about me and I need to</v>
<v Speaker 3>clean my shit up.</v>

879
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:12.480
<v Speaker 3>I need to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

880
00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:16.550
<v Speaker 3>get my act together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should give him a as good as an</v>

881
00:42:16.551 --> 00:42:18.760
<v Speaker 3>example if I possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

882
00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.990
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know,</v>

883
00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:22.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a very new dad.</v>

884
00:42:22.401 --> 00:42:26.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think one of the best things we</v>

885
00:42:26.961 --> 00:42:30.200
<v Speaker 3>could do as a people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a culture is for,</v>

886
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:31.480
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pete,</v>

887
00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:36.480
<v Speaker 3>for parents who are put in that position</v>
<v Speaker 3>with all that responsibility to somehow</v>

888
00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:41.690
<v Speaker 3>look at themselves real hard and take</v>
<v Speaker 3>that time to,</v>

889
00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:47.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the best way to put it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just improve themselves rather than</v>

890
00:42:47.391 --> 00:42:50.450
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out how to parent a</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain way or parent better.</v>

891
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:53.210
<v Speaker 3>I really think the best thing we could</v>
<v Speaker 3>do is just be better people,</v>

892
00:42:53.211 --> 00:42:55.100
<v Speaker 3>would be better humans ourselves.</v>

893
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:58.400
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very quick point.</v>

894
00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:00.170
<v Speaker 2>Lead by example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

895
00:43:00.171 --> 00:43:04.190
<v Speaker 2>that was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I used to teach taekwondo,</v>

896
00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:05.450
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

897
00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:11.020
<v Speaker 2>the things that they would call you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the term that the Koreans uses sub ohm</v>

898
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:14.030
<v Speaker 2>Nim and there was one who leads by</v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

899
00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:17.990
<v Speaker 2>That was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea behind it behind being an</v>

900
00:43:17.991 --> 00:43:21.890
<v Speaker 2>instructor and to be a parent that leads</v>
<v Speaker 2>by example.</v>

901
00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:22.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

902
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:27.140
<v Speaker 2>or sometimes some people learn a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>from parents being a fuck up.</v>

903
00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people's parents were</v>

904
00:43:29.931 --> 00:43:33.560
<v Speaker 2>fucking losers and they're just go get</v>
<v Speaker 2>them totally.</v>

905
00:43:33.561 --> 00:43:35.390
<v Speaker 2>They just get shit done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

906
00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:40.400
<v Speaker 2>their hustle because their parents were</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug addicts or alcoholics or jailbirds</v>

907
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.830
<v Speaker 2>or whatever the fuck it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they just felt the pain of their</v>

908
00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:47.600
<v Speaker 2>family being awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

909
00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.530
<v Speaker 2>But that's not a good bet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

910
00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:53.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's third from experience or</v>
<v Speaker 3>learning by example too.</v>

911
00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:56.700
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can either accept in love with you</v>

912
00:43:56.730 --> 00:43:59.410
<v Speaker 3>what's your parents do or rejected or</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

913
00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:01.300
<v Speaker 3>something in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

914
00:44:01.301 --> 00:44:03.220
<v Speaker 3>But so the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I learned.</v>

915
00:44:03.221 --> 00:44:07.330
<v Speaker 3>So I worked with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with young guys between the ages of 14</v>

916
00:44:07.331 --> 00:44:10.210
<v Speaker 3>and that toward the end of when I did</v>
<v Speaker 3>that work,</v>

917
00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:15.040
<v Speaker 3>I would do more specialty work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I do like one on ones to one time I</v>

918
00:44:15.041 --> 00:44:17.770
<v Speaker 3>did a 55 day wilderness trip with one</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid,</v>

919
00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:20.050
<v Speaker 3>just him and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was tire thing.</v>

920
00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:24.880
<v Speaker 3>But what I low was that like 55 days was</v>
<v Speaker 3>one kid.</v>

921
00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:27.970
<v Speaker 3>So he was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was fucking fantastic.</v>

922
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.680
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He loved to work out.</v>

923
00:44:29.681 --> 00:44:30.900
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

924
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.850
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a good kid,</v>

925
00:44:32.851 --> 00:44:36.690
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like 19 or 20 and just not sure</v>

926
00:44:36.691 --> 00:44:38.760
<v Speaker 3>about college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not sure what to do.</v>

927
00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:40.110
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did they kidnap him?</v>

928
00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.450
<v Speaker 3>He knew he was coming because he was an</v>
<v Speaker 3>adult.</v>

929
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.930
<v Speaker 3>He's legally an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

930
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:47.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the first day he showed up and I</v>

931
00:44:47.461 --> 00:44:49.020
<v Speaker 3>remember he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

932
00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:51.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to pretend like I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be here until I die.</v>

933
00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:53.790
<v Speaker 3>He had this really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective.</v>

934
00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:55.500
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

935
00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:56.880
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know this is going to be long.</v>

936
00:44:56.890 --> 00:44:58.650
<v Speaker 3>It's going to suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm just going to sort of,</v>

937
00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:01.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just not count days.</v>

938
00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:03.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to like count my time or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

939
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:07.350
<v Speaker 3>But he was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was really into lifting weights</v>

940
00:45:07.351 --> 00:45:09.740
<v Speaker 3>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was at the time and uh,</v>

941
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:14.700
<v Speaker 3>so we would do pushups one day we did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we height like 14 miles in 1400</v>

942
00:45:14.701 --> 00:45:18.660
<v Speaker 3>pushups or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like try to blow shoulders up.</v>

943
00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.470
<v Speaker 3>It was so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when I was going to say is that what</v>

944
00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:25.440
<v Speaker 3>I learned from working with kids so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that example thing is there's,</v>

945
00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:30.530
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing to compare to that as</v>
<v Speaker 3>far as what people are,</v>

946
00:45:31.951 --> 00:45:34.350
<v Speaker 3>kids are good guys especially will</v>
<v Speaker 3>respond to,</v>

947
00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:38.070
<v Speaker 3>is that example like you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can tell them,</v>

948
00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:39.793
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids,</v>

949
00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:43.470
<v Speaker 3>they catch bullshit the fucking second</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes out of your mouth.</v>

950
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:44.700
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're saying one thing,</v>

951
00:45:44.701 --> 00:45:48.630
<v Speaker 3>but you're not living in being honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're not being real about yourself,</v>

952
00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:50.640
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't work.</v>

953
00:45:50.641 --> 00:45:51.480
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

954
00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:54.240
<v Speaker 3>I think that that was a real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

955
00:45:54.241 --> 00:45:57.600
<v Speaker 3>and I did this for five or six years and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've spent probably six,</v>

956
00:45:57.601 --> 00:46:02.601
<v Speaker 3>700 days out doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I came back from the experience just</v>

957
00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:08.930
<v Speaker 3>seeing this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this huge gap in our culture about role</v>

958
00:46:10.171 --> 00:46:13.440
<v Speaker 3>models and mentors and just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just regular relationships that seem</v>

959
00:46:13.441 --> 00:46:17.430
<v Speaker 3>pretty natural and pretty normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

960
00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:22.020
<v Speaker 3>that just like I would get into a group</v>
<v Speaker 3>of these kids and you would just,</v>

961
00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there'd be something there.</v>

962
00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:27.900
<v Speaker 3>They would recognize something in me and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd recognize something in them and it</v>

963
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:29.790
<v Speaker 3>just a really cool thing to be a part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

964
00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:31.200
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

965
00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:33.690
<v Speaker 3>what did you guys do for 55 days in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>woods?</v>

966
00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:37.260
<v Speaker 3>I leave that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we would hike a lot most of the day,</v>

967
00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:40.760
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would hike probably eight to 15 week</v>

968
00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:42.420
<v Speaker 3>camping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>backpacking,</v>

969
00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:45.840
<v Speaker 3>backpack up on the shores of Lake</v>
<v Speaker 3>Superior.</v>

970
00:46:45.841 --> 00:46:47.820
<v Speaker 3>So there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called the superior hiking trail.</v>

971
00:46:47.821 --> 00:46:52.110
<v Speaker 3>It's a 200 plus mile footpath that goes</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the hills and mountains,</v>

972
00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:54.620
<v Speaker 3>like over lake superior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

973
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:55.590
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would hike.</v>

974
00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:58.310
<v Speaker 3>We'd swim in the lake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

975
00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:01.680
<v Speaker 3>at that point in time I had this idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I was going to ask my girlfriend to</v>

976
00:47:01.681 --> 00:47:02.880
<v Speaker 3>marry her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was looking for,</v>

977
00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:05.280
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets these little jewels,</v>

978
00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:09.240
<v Speaker 3>stones and all the rivers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we'd spend a lot of time looking for</v>

979
00:47:09.241 --> 00:47:12.230
<v Speaker 3>stones and I don't know man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just hey,</v>

980
00:47:12.231 --> 00:47:13.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

981
00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.650
<v Speaker 3>really and push ups and push ups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>push ups.</v>

982
00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:20.130
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so a lot of conversations about the</v>

983
00:47:20.131 --> 00:47:21.360
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about life,</v>

984
00:47:21.361 --> 00:47:24.060
<v Speaker 3>about yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How to change your path.</v>

985
00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.111
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

986
00:47:25.111 --> 00:47:26.320
<v Speaker 3>Some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

987
00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:29.070
<v Speaker 3>and then a lot of times have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>silence,</v>

988
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:30.103
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

989
00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:32.700
<v Speaker 3>we weren't going to talk what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>16 hours a day,</v>

990
00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:37.000
<v Speaker 3>it just be too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

991
00:47:37.001 --> 00:47:38.830
<v Speaker 3>he ended up doing great man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

992
00:47:38.831 --> 00:47:41.440
<v Speaker 3>I think he's off kind of killing it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>life right now.</v>

993
00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.010
<v Speaker 3>But that's an extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

994
00:47:45.011 --> 00:47:47.710
<v Speaker 3>that's an extreme example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now how is this organized?</v>

995
00:47:47.711 --> 00:47:49.030
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his parents were like,</v>

996
00:47:49.031 --> 00:47:51.400
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck up time to put you in the woods.</v>

997
00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:52.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

998
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:55.110
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they had heard about it and they,</v>

999
00:47:55.640 --> 00:48:00.160
<v Speaker 3>they just felt like that would be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>chance for him to break his pattern.</v>

1000
00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:01.210
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1001
00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.170
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's,</v>

1002
00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.450
<v Speaker 3>there was a generally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1003
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:09.070
<v Speaker 3>like different categories of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of kids who would come to these places.</v>

1004
00:48:09.071 --> 00:48:12.080
<v Speaker 3>So there you'd have your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1005
00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:16.950
<v Speaker 3>drug abuser sorta out of control kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have your internet addicted,</v>

1006
00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:20.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slightly softer guy,</v>

1007
00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:21.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that socially awkward.</v>

1008
00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:24.790
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes we hit an emotional health</v>
<v Speaker 3>outbreaks.</v>

1009
00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:27.910
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they kind of broke,</v>

1010
00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:29.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into categories tends,</v>

1011
00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:30.940
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but honestly,</v>

1012
00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:34.000
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the cool thing about spending that</v>

1013
00:48:34.001 --> 00:48:38.380
<v Speaker 3>much time with people is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1014
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:43.390
<v Speaker 3>like he doesn't take long to see through</v>
<v Speaker 3>those behaviors to really seem like a</v>

1015
00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:45.010
<v Speaker 3>good kid.</v>

1016
00:48:45.010 --> 00:48:47.530
<v Speaker 3>And Pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've worked with hundreds if not</v>

1017
00:48:47.531 --> 00:48:52.531
<v Speaker 3>thousands of kids and maybe one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

1018
00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:56.780
<v Speaker 3>I can only think of one that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>think was like somebody that went and</v>

1019
00:48:56.781 --> 00:48:58.600
<v Speaker 3>we'd go have a beer with or hang out</v>
<v Speaker 3>with today.</v>

1020
00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:00.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the good kids,</v>

1021
00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:01.720
<v Speaker 3>they're really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're great human beings.</v>

1022
00:49:01.721 --> 00:49:03.170
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1023
00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:06.910
<v Speaker 3>either shitty circumstances are made a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of bad decisions or just were</v>

1024
00:49:06.911 --> 00:49:08.380
<v Speaker 3>confused or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean whatever,</v>

1025
00:49:08.381 --> 00:49:10.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I could have ended up there easy</v>

1026
00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:13.020
<v Speaker 3>if I would've gotten busted in high</v>
<v Speaker 3>school for budgets,</v>

1027
00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:14.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drinking and partying I,</v>

1028
00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:16.690
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you were born into the</v>

1029
00:49:16.691 --> 00:49:20.950
<v Speaker 3>household that they were born into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the big things</v>

1030
00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:24.040
<v Speaker 3>obviously about life is that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>pick your parents,</v>

1031
00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:26.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can't pick your neighborhood</v>

1032
00:49:26.501 --> 00:49:27.760
<v Speaker 3>that you grew up in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>

1033
00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:29.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have a say until you were an</v>

1034
00:49:29.411 --> 00:49:30.244
<v Speaker 3>adult.</v>

1035
00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:31.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1036
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:33.810
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1037
00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:36.600
<v Speaker 3>so after I did the wilderness stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went and,</v>

1038
00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:39.370
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I became a high school teacher in the</v>

1039
00:49:39.371 --> 00:49:41.500
<v Speaker 3>Bronx.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was part of the New York City teaching</v>

1040
00:49:41.501 --> 00:49:44.770
<v Speaker 3>fellowship programs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So basically we give you a free master's</v>

1041
00:49:44.771 --> 00:49:48.400
<v Speaker 3>if you teach for a couple of years in</v>
<v Speaker 3>high need areas.</v>

1042
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:52.420
<v Speaker 3>So it was an English teacher and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>really cool to school in the southeast</v>

1043
00:49:52.421 --> 00:49:54.970
<v Speaker 3>Bronx for a couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1044
00:49:54.971 --> 00:49:56.560
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1045
00:49:57.010 --> 00:50:02.010
<v Speaker 3>just that was the most challenging and</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably rewarding thing that I've ever</v>

1046
00:50:02.621 --> 00:50:06.630
<v Speaker 3>done and really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so a lot of the positions,</v>

1047
00:50:06.631 --> 00:50:10.990
<v Speaker 3>so first I worked with mostly wealthy</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids at some of these private pay</v>

1048
00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:14.170
<v Speaker 3>wilderness programs event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a lot of stuff for correctional</v>

1049
00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:16.240
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was rural poor,</v>

1050
00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:18.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a lot of um,</v>

1051
00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:22.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids from reservations and just sort of,</v>

1052
00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:26.320
<v Speaker 3>no offense but white trash type kids.</v>

1053
00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.830
<v Speaker 3>And then I moved to the inner city and</v>
<v Speaker 3>worked there.</v>

1054
00:50:28.831 --> 00:50:31.360
<v Speaker 3>And so I got a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a good spectrum on,</v>

1055
00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:35.330
<v Speaker 3>on working with different kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really just ended up that I kind of</v>

1056
00:50:35.331 --> 00:50:36.400
<v Speaker 3>liked them all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1057
00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:40.880
<v Speaker 3>there's fucking people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings while you were saying,</v>

1058
00:50:40.881 --> 00:50:41.930
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't pick where your,</v>

1059
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:46.990
<v Speaker 3>where your front man and you can argue</v>
<v Speaker 3>how big of a difference that makes</v>

1060
00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:50.420
<v Speaker 3>giant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost everything in terms of your</v>

1061
00:50:50.421 --> 00:50:51.530
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1062
00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:54.190
<v Speaker 3>and so many people don't realize that as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

1063
00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:57.980
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of times the really fortunate</v>
<v Speaker 3>ones don't realize it because they just</v>

1064
00:50:57.981 --> 00:51:00.800
<v Speaker 3>think that everybody's got it like this</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they just take that,</v>

1065
00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:02.840
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my life's hard to,</v>

1066
00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:04.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my life was,</v>

1067
00:51:04.941 --> 00:51:06.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only challenging.</v>

1068
00:51:06.891 --> 00:51:09.890
<v Speaker 3>And then we moved around a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my mom,</v>

1069
00:51:09.891 --> 00:51:13.070
<v Speaker 3>my Stepdad were really nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People got lucky,</v>

1070
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:15.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't fuck ups,</v>

1071
00:51:15.831 --> 00:51:18.080
<v Speaker 3>they weren't assholes.</v>

1072
00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:21.320
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't beat me and torture me is</v>

1073
00:51:21.321 --> 00:51:22.580
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Such a horrible,</v>

1074
00:51:22.581 --> 00:51:27.581
<v Speaker 3>horrible stories of what parents do to</v>
<v Speaker 3>their children.</v>

1075
00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:31.310
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to wonder what their parents did</v>

1076
00:51:31.311 --> 00:51:36.311
<v Speaker 3>to them that started this whole path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like unstopped before some</v>

1077
00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:40.490
<v Speaker 3>momentum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some of the things you were telling</v>

1078
00:51:40.491 --> 00:51:41.540
<v Speaker 3>me about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1079
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:44.630
<v Speaker 3>the poor kids that you worked with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like yeah.</v>

1080
00:51:44.631 --> 00:51:49.631
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the kids that just this</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing light field kid,</v>

1081
00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:52.250
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1082
00:51:52.251 --> 00:51:54.610
<v Speaker 3>co comes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did,</v>

1083
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:55.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember how it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1084
00:51:55.791 --> 00:51:58.250
<v Speaker 3>I think he came into school one morning</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1085
00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:00.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his dad had,</v>

1086
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:03.320
<v Speaker 3>had bashed his skull in with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a baseball bat.</v>

1087
00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:05.810
<v Speaker 3>Just just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he got drunk and got angry.</v>

1088
00:52:05.811 --> 00:52:08.120
<v Speaker 3>He just beat the fuck on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1089
00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:13.520
<v Speaker 3>I remember that morning feeling just so</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopeless and just like,</v>

1090
00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:17.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing I could do to protect this kid.</v>

1091
00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:20.630
<v Speaker 3>Like I could be the best teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can be the best role model and friend</v>

1092
00:52:20.631 --> 00:52:25.190
<v Speaker 3>of this guy then than I ever could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But every night he has to go back into</v>

1093
00:52:25.191 --> 00:52:28.610
<v Speaker 3>this</v>
<v Speaker 3>unimaginable,</v>

1094
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:31.170
<v Speaker 3>horrible place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1095
00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:33.920
<v Speaker 3>And it's insidious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of weird ways it comes out</v>

1096
00:52:33.921 --> 00:52:37.100
<v Speaker 3>to it and it's another student of mine</v>
<v Speaker 3>of mine,</v>

1097
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:42.150
<v Speaker 3>a hug a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her mom would basically tell her that</v>

1098
00:52:42.231 --> 00:52:44.960
<v Speaker 3>she was always sick and there's a name</v>
<v Speaker 3>for this.</v>

1099
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:48.170
<v Speaker 3>There's like a condition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember where a parent needs their</v>

1100
00:52:48.171 --> 00:52:51.440
<v Speaker 3>kids to be around so much for their own</v>
<v Speaker 3>wellbeing.</v>

1101
00:52:51.441 --> 00:52:53.510
<v Speaker 3>Somehow they turned them into a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hypochondriac.</v>

1102
00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:54.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be heard of this.</v>

1103
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:55.701
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1104
00:52:55.701 --> 00:52:56.534
<v Speaker 3>there's a name for it.</v>

1105
00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:02.420
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember it right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but weird shit man.</v>

1106
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just weird stuff.</v>

1107
00:53:03.921 --> 00:53:04.251
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1108
00:53:04.251 --> 00:53:09.250
<v Speaker 3>I think there's so many people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>working so hard to do good things for</v>

1109
00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:11.870
<v Speaker 3>people in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the harder circumstances.</v>

1110
00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:13.293
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1111
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:17.540
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like an overwhelming force.</v>

1112
00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:18.890
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1113
00:53:18.891 --> 00:53:21.320
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing I've seen in like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1114
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:25.040
<v Speaker 3>I seen a bunch of those kids that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>taught and so I taught in a school,</v>

1115
00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:28.590
<v Speaker 3>I was their only teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's of like a kindergarten model for</v>

1116
00:53:28.591 --> 00:53:29.390
<v Speaker 3>high school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1117
00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:32.490
<v Speaker 3>And all the learning was based on</v>
<v Speaker 3>projects they did and they had</v>

1118
00:53:32.491 --> 00:53:35.580
<v Speaker 3>internships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they didn't go from math to English</v>

1119
00:53:35.581 --> 00:53:38.820
<v Speaker 3>to science and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just worked one on one and they</v>

1120
00:53:38.821 --> 00:53:39.330
<v Speaker 3>tried,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1121
00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:42.060
<v Speaker 3>kind of worked out everything at all</v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

1122
00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:43.710
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1123
00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:47.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were my students for two entire</v>

1124
00:53:47.431 --> 00:53:48.390
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1125
00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:51.330
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of time we spent together was</v>

1126
00:53:51.331 --> 00:53:53.340
<v Speaker 3>just really intense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Man,</v>

1127
00:53:53.341 --> 00:53:56.160
<v Speaker 3>we got very close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1128
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:57.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm losing my train of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1129
00:53:57.481 --> 00:53:59.220
<v Speaker 3>so there's a lot of people trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>good things,</v>

1130
00:53:59.221 --> 00:54:04.221
<v Speaker 3>but it is that home life or that</v>
<v Speaker 3>cultural pole trajectory.</v>

1131
00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:07.920
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

1132
00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:11.040
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno what the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to combat it.</v>

1133
00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:12.410
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of those,</v>

1134
00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:14.150
<v Speaker 4>Pat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm one of those,</v>

1135
00:54:14.151 --> 00:54:15.830
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>programs like the one that you were</v>

1136
00:54:15.831 --> 00:54:18.650
<v Speaker 4>involved in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be one of the only ways to do</v>

1137
00:54:18.651 --> 00:54:19.230
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1138
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:23.510
<v Speaker 4>Or a program like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something that's going to give them</v>

1139
00:54:23.511 --> 00:54:25.400
<v Speaker 4>individualized attention and let them</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1140
00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:26.870
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there might be a light at the end of</v>

1141
00:54:26.871 --> 00:54:28.940
<v Speaker 4>this tunnel and it might be a way out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1142
00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.480
<v Speaker 4>There's nice people out there like Dan</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dodi that are going to help you out.</v>

1143
00:54:32.481 --> 00:54:36.290
<v Speaker 4>And he recognizes that there's people</v>
<v Speaker 4>out there that need help,</v>

1144
00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:38.720
<v Speaker 3>but they're filled with that shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everyday too,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1148
00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:44.750
<v Speaker 3>it is interesting because I'm this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was born in North Dakota.</v>

1149
00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.930

<v Speaker 3>my students who act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I mean,</v>

1151
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:51.290

<v Speaker 3>So like the school,</v>

1152
00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:54.320
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1153
00:54:54.321 --> 00:54:57.020
<v Speaker 3>segregated and it was completely black</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Latino,</v>

1154
00:54:57.450 --> 00:55:02.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Mexican and Dominican and Puerto</v>

1155
00:55:02.330 --> 00:55:05.060
<v Speaker 3>Rican and black and not a single white</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid in the entire school.</v>

1156
00:55:05.061 --> 00:55:08.120
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just not that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so there's immediately this odd</v>

1157
00:55:08.121 --> 00:55:13.121
<v Speaker 3>dynamic for me to go and teach in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a location like that,</v>

1158
00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:16.370
<v Speaker 3>that there is a racial dynamic present</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter,</v>

1159
00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:19.610
<v Speaker 3>no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my kids would tease me about how</v>

1160
00:55:19.611 --> 00:55:21.350
<v Speaker 3>when I was on a time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1161
00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:22.290
<v Speaker 3>it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we,</v>

1162
00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:26.990
<v Speaker 3>we got past any racial barriers or at</v>
<v Speaker 3>least most racial barriers,</v>

1163
00:55:26.991 --> 00:55:29.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were able just to see each other as</v>

1164
00:55:29.871 --> 00:55:31.880
<v Speaker 3>human beings and him worked together</v>
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>

1165
00:55:32.330 --> 00:55:35.390
<v Speaker 3>But so there is a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get what you just said.</v>

1166
00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:38.060
<v Speaker 3>They get a lot of people tell him that</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time,</v>

1167
00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:39.350
<v Speaker 3>but there's a light at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>tunnel.</v>

1168
00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:40.520
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's options,</v>

1169
00:55:40.521 --> 00:55:41.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

1170
00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:45.050
<v Speaker 3>you can take ahold of his life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just his words.</v>

1171
00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:46.570
<v Speaker 4>Two kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1172
00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.310
<v Speaker 4>just lip service,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1173
00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:51.730
<v Speaker 4>and they hear that before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you gotta get good grades or You</v>

1174
00:55:51.731 --> 00:55:53.880
<v Speaker 4>got to go to college and get a good job</v>
<v Speaker 4>to hear all these things,</v>

1175
00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:56.460
<v Speaker 3>things that don't seem to resonate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1176
00:55:56.461 --> 00:55:59.010
<v Speaker 3>because it's disconnected from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience of life.</v>

1177
00:55:59.011 --> 00:56:00.630
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I can go in there and say that,</v>

1178
00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:04.080
<v Speaker 3>and I went to college and I had a good</v>
<v Speaker 3>safe childhood and then in a safe place</v>

1179
00:56:04.610 --> 00:56:07.230
<v Speaker 3>and I can see that it doesn't fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>mean anything because they go home and</v>

1180
00:56:07.231 --> 00:56:08.760
<v Speaker 3>it's not safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not.</v>

1181
00:56:08.761 --> 00:56:11.010
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's what it comes down to</v>
<v Speaker 3>more than anything.</v>

1182
00:56:11.011 --> 00:56:16.011
<v Speaker 3>It's people are in a state of fight or</v>
<v Speaker 3>flight constantly because it's,</v>

1183
00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:17.640
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a safety thing.</v>

1184
00:56:17.810 --> 00:56:18.643
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1185
00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:21.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like</v>

1186
00:56:21.790 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 4>everyone rinella was talking a those</v>
<v Speaker 4>deer</v>

1187
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.750
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like a,</v>

1188
00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:28.360
<v Speaker 2>the deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Jack Rabbit runs in front of the deer</v>

1189
00:56:28.361 --> 00:56:30.970
<v Speaker 2>and the deer leaps up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like someone hit it with an electric</v>

1190
00:56:30.971 --> 00:56:31.804
<v Speaker 2>shock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1191
00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Like they're constantly on there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly on guard.</v>

1192
00:56:36.761 --> 00:56:39.760
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that happens also with children and</v>

1193
00:56:39.761 --> 00:56:40.594
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1194
00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:45.660
<v Speaker 2>I have talked to him this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a feral cat and that fucking cat</v>

1195
00:56:46.301 --> 00:56:49.720
<v Speaker 2>was wild to the day he died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had him when he was a baby.</v>

1196
00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:52.240
<v Speaker 2>I got the money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a kid and he was only a couple</v>

1197
00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.320
<v Speaker 2>months old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was already,</v>

1198
00:56:53.321 --> 00:56:55.570
<v Speaker 2>it was already too late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was fucking wild.</v>

1199
00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:59.230
<v Speaker 2>He was just in his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything was out to get them.</v>

1200
00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:01.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1201
00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:07.030
<v Speaker 2>I can't officially say this cause I</v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't studied it officially,</v>

1202
00:57:07.031 --> 00:57:11.420
<v Speaker 2>but I think that there are no versions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you call it ps Pete,</v>

1203
00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:14.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ptsd or just stuck in the state of</v>

1204
00:57:14.321 --> 00:57:15.920
<v Speaker 2>hypervigilance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever news.</v>

1205
00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:18.550
<v Speaker 2>It's just coming from a place that's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>safe.</v>

1206
00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:22.780
<v Speaker 2>A place that's fucked up and to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>expected to,</v>

1207
00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:28.560
<v Speaker 2>to be able to overcome that without any</v>
<v Speaker 2>real time assistance and work.</v>

1208
00:57:28.721 --> 00:57:31.240
<v Speaker 2>He's really unreasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just,</v>

1209
00:57:31.241 --> 00:57:32.320
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really not like,</v>

1210
00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:37.390
<v Speaker 2>you can't just decide right to quick</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause it's your body.</v>

1211
00:57:37.391 --> 00:57:38.410
<v Speaker 2>It's semantic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1212
00:57:38.411 --> 00:57:40.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's either you get to pay to you.</v>

1213
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:42.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's your mind.</v>

1214
00:57:42.581 --> 00:57:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's both,</v>

1215
00:57:43.661 --> 00:57:45.040
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like you can just say,</v>

1216
00:57:45.041 --> 00:57:45.520
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna,</v>

1217
00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:48.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's far more,</v>

1218
00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:50.960
<v Speaker 2>it's far more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1219
00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.840
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a battleship that's moving a</v>

1220
00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:55.570
<v Speaker 2>hundred miles an hour and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>expected to turn on a dime.</v>

1221
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:59.440
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a lot of weight momentum</v>

1222
00:57:59.441 --> 00:58:03.430
<v Speaker 2>behind that passed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to Michael Irvin once,</v>

1223
00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:07.130
<v Speaker 2>I was on a flight with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just random and uh,</v>

1224
00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:09.880
<v Speaker 2>it was all the way to Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a long ass time.</v>

1225
00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:14.170
<v Speaker 2>And he and I were talking about a work</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's been doing with,</v>

1226
00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:16.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some young kids come from troubled</v>

1227
00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:21.780
<v Speaker 2>houses and troubled backgrounds as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was telling me that when a child</v>

1228
00:58:22.511 --> 00:58:27.511
<v Speaker 2>is in the womb and the mother is</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiencing intense stress from</v>

1229
00:58:28.331 --> 00:58:30.250
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from crime,</v>

1230
00:58:30.251 --> 00:58:32.950
<v Speaker 2>bad neighborhoods that kind of shed a</v>
<v Speaker 2>domestic abuse,</v>

1231
00:58:32.951 --> 00:58:37.330
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the child grows up with more of a</v>

1232
00:58:37.331 --> 00:58:41.380
<v Speaker 2>propensity for violence like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that violence becomes like almost in</v>

1233
00:58:41.381 --> 00:58:45.490
<v Speaker 2>their DNA as a response to any perceived</v>
<v Speaker 2>threat,</v>

1234
00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:49.590
<v Speaker 2>whether it's real or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that the,</v>

1235
00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:51.880
<v Speaker 2>we have to understand that these</v>
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>

1236
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:56.910
<v Speaker 2>like they're being wired for violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're wired to deal with bad</v>

1237
00:58:58.061 --> 00:59:00.010
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad situations,</v>

1238
00:59:00.011 --> 00:59:01.330
<v Speaker 2>crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

1239
00:59:01.331 --> 00:59:05.020
<v Speaker 2>it's literally a part of their genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in them,</v>

1240
00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:10.110
<v Speaker 2>it's their DNA almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or it is so this the republican white</v>

1241
00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:18.480
<v Speaker 2>conservative idea that people need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull themselves up by their bootstraps,</v>

1242
00:59:19.110 --> 00:59:20.260
<v Speaker 2>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the Cliche,</v>

1243
00:59:20.261 --> 00:59:22.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They to get their shit together like</v>

1244
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:24.800
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it more complicated than that?</v>

1245
00:59:25.410 --> 00:59:26.730
<v Speaker 3>It is man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so here's the,</v>

1246
00:59:26.731 --> 00:59:28.520
<v Speaker 3>here's the interesting thing is I</v>
<v Speaker 3>applied,</v>

1247
00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:32.520
<v Speaker 3>do think that I actually agree with that</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a different way.</v>

1248
00:59:32.730 --> 00:59:36.330
<v Speaker 3>I think that you can never expect</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody else to do any of that.</v>

1249
00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:39.870
<v Speaker 3>Like the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're born and raised in the way you</v>

1250
00:59:39.871 --> 00:59:44.871
<v Speaker 3>are and then at some point you fully</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to take responsibility for that.</v>

1251
00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:48.360
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter how shitty or great in your</v>

1252
00:59:48.361 --> 00:59:50.550
<v Speaker 3>childhood was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter what you're dealing with,</v>

1253
00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:54.150
<v Speaker 3>I think that that there is no one else</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to do it for you.</v>

1254
00:59:54.151 --> 00:59:57.470
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do think that there's a,</v>

1255
00:59:57.490 --> 00:59:59.700
<v Speaker 3>there is a piece of truth in what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're saying.</v>

1256
00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:04.730
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that general mindset is nuanced or</v>

1257
01:00:04.921 --> 01:00:08.250
<v Speaker 3>understanding enough of what people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>working with that they're unrealistic</v>

1258
01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:09.570
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1259
01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:10.350
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1260
01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:11.340
<v Speaker 3>they might just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1261
01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:14.390
<v Speaker 2>what's conveniently aloof?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1262
01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:19.670
<v Speaker 2>they're conveniently ignorant about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances that are involved in</v>

1263
01:00:20.411 --> 01:00:25.411
<v Speaker 2>creating a child that grows up and has</v>
<v Speaker 2>been in juvenile detention since they</v>

1264
01:00:25.901 --> 01:00:30.901
<v Speaker 2>were a little kid and has been in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of all sorts of police custody and</v>

1265
01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:38.380
<v Speaker 2>been in crime situations from the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were young to say that you need to</v>

1266
01:00:38.381 --> 01:00:42.220
<v Speaker 2>just straighten your act up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they don't have any examples and</v>

1267
01:00:42.221 --> 01:00:45.940
<v Speaker 2>the examples that they see on tv might</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well be them watching iron man.</v>

1268
01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:46.811
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1269
01:00:46.811 --> 01:00:49.090
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't seem real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not real.</v>

1270
01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:49.901
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1271
01:00:49.901 --> 01:00:54.100
<v Speaker 3>that's an issue I have with that whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>debate or political discussion or</v>

1272
01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:56.650
<v Speaker 3>however you want to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that it to be,</v>

1273
01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.850
<v Speaker 3>it's only up there talking about a</v>
<v Speaker 3>situation and never as the actual</v>

1274
01:01:00.851 --> 01:01:05.590
<v Speaker 3>conversation being had a conversation</v>
<v Speaker 3>between people who had actually affects</v>

1275
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:09.610
<v Speaker 3>is rarely brought out and it's just a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of people looking at things from</v>

1276
01:01:09.611 --> 01:01:14.611
<v Speaker 3>the outside and commenting and talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it and not actually digging into</v>

1277
01:01:15.761 --> 01:01:17.650
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's just doesn't really,</v>

1278
01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:20.580
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't serve anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like it serves anyone.</v>

1279
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also like very dismissive.</v>

1280
01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:29.220
<v Speaker 2>He was very dismissive of other people's</v>
<v Speaker 2>misfortune and not really appreciating</v>

1281
01:01:29.931 --> 01:01:32.360
<v Speaker 2>or understanding your fortune,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1282
01:01:32.361 --> 01:01:36.800
<v Speaker 2>we're all born to come totally different</v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances for the most part.</v>

1283
01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:41.720
<v Speaker 2>And most of us here in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about this yesterday,</v>

1284
01:01:42.050 --> 01:01:47.050
<v Speaker 2>that people that are in this country are</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much more fortunate than someone</v>

1285
01:01:48.021 --> 01:01:50.150
<v Speaker 2>who's born in some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1286
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:54.620
<v Speaker 2>terrible third world situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we were talking about Liberia.</v>

1287
01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reality of Liberia,</v>

1288
01:01:56.571 --> 01:01:58.770
<v Speaker 2>which is former,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1289
01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:02.750
<v Speaker 2>prison or not prison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>college slave colony with what they did</v>

1290
01:02:02.751 --> 01:02:07.751
<v Speaker 2>was they took American slaves that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>released and they shipped them back to</v>

1291
01:02:08.001 --> 01:02:11.870
<v Speaker 2>Africa literally and created this</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible,</v>

1292
01:02:11.871 --> 01:02:14.500
<v Speaker 2>horrible environment through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1293
01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:18.740
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of different factors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but several war being a big one of them.</v>

1294
01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:23.520
<v Speaker 2>And vice has a really insightful and</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing piece on,</v>

1295
01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:24.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Liberia.</v>

1296
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:27.780
<v Speaker 2>I think it's vice guide to travel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All my God,</v>

1297
01:02:27.781 --> 01:02:29.690
<v Speaker 2>it's an awful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1298
01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:31.650
<v Speaker 2>you can't say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1299
01:02:31.651 --> 01:02:36.651
<v Speaker 2>being born to a blue collar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white family in Cleveland is anything</v>

1300
01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:45.960
<v Speaker 2>remotely as bad as being a child born in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Liberia or he can.</v>

1301
01:02:45.961 --> 01:02:50.500
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then looking at that person though,</v>

1302
01:02:50.501 --> 01:02:53.100
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the child who's born in Cleveland,</v>

1303
01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:53.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1304
01:02:53.941 --> 01:02:57.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's a lot of kids that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>born there that wish,</v>

1305
01:02:57.241 --> 01:02:58.050
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1306
01:02:58.050 --> 01:02:59.910
<v Speaker 2>why couldn't I have been born in New</v>
<v Speaker 2>York City?</v>

1307
01:02:59.911 --> 01:03:01.040
<v Speaker 2>Or Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why couldn't I have been,</v>

1308
01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:02.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1309
01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:04.350
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1310
01:03:04.351 --> 01:03:08.310
<v Speaker 2>it comes back to what you were saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>about being a dad and the responsibility</v>

1311
01:03:08.311 --> 01:03:13.311
<v Speaker 2>of being a good person and being a</v>
<v Speaker 2>better person is that making and</v>

1312
01:03:13.681 --> 01:03:18.681
<v Speaker 2>developing human beings and creating a</v>
<v Speaker 2>community together with each human</v>

1313
01:03:19.861 --> 01:03:24.810
<v Speaker 2>beings is so incredibly difficult and</v>
<v Speaker 2>were handed this responsibility with no</v>

1314
01:03:24.811 --> 01:03:25.800
<v Speaker 2>instruction manual.</v>

1315
01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:26.890
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing.</v>

1316
01:03:26.891 --> 01:03:28.840
<v Speaker 3>No good leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No instructions.</v>

1317
01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:30.370
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right man.</v>

1318
01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.233
<v Speaker 3>Well</v>

1319
01:03:31.930 --> 01:03:35.410
<v Speaker 2>leadership guys like you or some other</v>
<v Speaker 2>folks out there that are doing similar</v>

1320
01:03:35.411 --> 01:03:37.510
<v Speaker 2>things that you can find,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1321
01:03:37.511 --> 01:03:39.280
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't find them,</v>

1322
01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:40.173
<v Speaker 2>fuck</v>

1323
01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:41.790
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

1324
01:03:41.790 --> 01:03:45.360
<v Speaker 3>one thing I think it's really important</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're kind of hitting not there or</v>

1325
01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:50.420
<v Speaker 3>we're saying is</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like a big leap to go from the</v>

1326
01:03:51.271 --> 01:03:54.240
<v Speaker 3>place of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of blaming others and just feeling like</v>

1327
01:03:54.241 --> 01:03:56.370
<v Speaker 3>all my shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like look at my book,</v>

1328
01:03:56.371 --> 01:03:57.840
<v Speaker 3>what I was eating and it was really</v>
<v Speaker 3>shitty.</v>

1329
01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:02.460
<v Speaker 3>It's a big leap to go beyond that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>accept it.</v>

1330
01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:04.500
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter what it is,</v>

1331
01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:08.100
<v Speaker 3>what you got going on in your life and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then even a bigger leap.</v>

1332
01:04:08.101 --> 01:04:13.101
<v Speaker 3>I think to start taking responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 3>for both yourself and other people.</v>

1333
01:04:14.131 --> 01:04:14.851
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1334
01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:18.150
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what is,</v>

1335
01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.740
<v Speaker 3>not that it's missing because it's out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1336
01:04:19.741 --> 01:04:23.790
<v Speaker 3>but I just think it could be like we got</v>
<v Speaker 3>time in our lives,</v>

1337
01:04:23.791 --> 01:04:25.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we're doing okay in general in this</v>

1338
01:04:25.471 --> 01:04:30.060
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we could take more time for each</v>

1339
01:04:30.061 --> 01:04:32.080
<v Speaker 3>other in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just across the board today,</v>

1340
01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:35.100
<v Speaker 3>whether that's in our schools or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

1341
01:04:35.101 --> 01:04:36.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any answers.</v>

1342
01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.760
<v Speaker 2>You have some answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you've got some great ideas,</v>

1343
01:04:40.761 --> 01:04:45.761
<v Speaker 2>but I think one of the things that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about yesterday was the amount of</v>

1344
01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:51.550
<v Speaker 2>children that you had communicated with</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had taught that found themselves in</v>

1345
01:04:53.331 --> 01:04:57.320
<v Speaker 2>some horrific situations that you had to</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of experience with them.</v>

1346
01:04:58.370 --> 01:05:03.370
<v Speaker 2>And I think that human beings today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at some point in time,</v>

1347
01:05:04.551 --> 01:05:09.110
<v Speaker 2>we have to realize that we are some sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a super organism.</v>

1348
01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:14.360
<v Speaker 2>We are all connected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if this kid who grows up in this</v>

1349
01:05:14.361 --> 01:05:18.280
<v Speaker 2>horrible environment and is just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>abused</v>

1350
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:23.280
<v Speaker 4>and subject to all sorts of violence and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kids can go perpetuate more of the</v>

1351
01:05:23.651 --> 01:05:25.630
<v Speaker 4>same,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if no one steps in,</v>

1352
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:30.940
<v Speaker 4>if no one offers some solid example that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can do better,</v>

1353
01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:36.180
<v Speaker 4>like some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of just some pathway through</v>

1354
01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:39.430
<v Speaker 4>the bullshit and bullshit is not strong</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough worth.</v>

1355
01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and for me like so I've spent a lot of</v>

1356
01:05:43.241 --> 01:05:46.520
<v Speaker 3>time thinking about and reading about</v>
<v Speaker 3>studying sort of both,</v>

1357
01:05:46.550 --> 01:05:49.510
<v Speaker 3>both rites of passage at different parts</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the world,</v>

1358
01:05:49.511 --> 01:05:54.070
<v Speaker 3>but then also just this really simple</v>
<v Speaker 3>concept of mentoring or mentorship or</v>

1359
01:05:54.071 --> 01:05:57.130
<v Speaker 3>role models.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think I got real lucky like I had</v>

1360
01:05:57.131 --> 01:05:59.320
<v Speaker 3>an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only did I have a good family and</v>

1361
01:05:59.321 --> 01:06:01.060
<v Speaker 3>good parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like amazing parents.</v>

1362
01:06:01.570 --> 01:06:04.870
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have this like string of role models</v>

1363
01:06:04.871 --> 01:06:07.540
<v Speaker 3>that I had from little kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've talked about this briefly</v>

1364
01:06:07.541 --> 01:06:09.130
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my first one was my taekwondo</v>

1365
01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:11.320
<v Speaker 3>instructor at Russ kid best or Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1366
01:06:11.410 --> 01:06:14.410
<v Speaker 3>like he was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was super shy,</v>

1367
01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:19.300
<v Speaker 3>super like very soft as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then this dude in a sports car drove</v>

1368
01:06:19.301 --> 01:06:20.500
<v Speaker 3>into Drayton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>North Dakota.</v>

1369
01:06:20.830 --> 01:06:22.760
<v Speaker 3>And I started taking taekwondo with him</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1370
01:06:22.761 --> 01:06:24.730
<v Speaker 3>and he was just this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1371
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:27.130
<v Speaker 3>bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brash,</v>

1372
01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.780
<v Speaker 3>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>confident guy.</v>

1373
01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:33.430
<v Speaker 3>And then I looked up to him like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I attribute a lot of my,</v>

1374
01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:35.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the quality of the good qualities I</v>

1375
01:06:35.681 --> 01:06:39.420
<v Speaker 3>value about myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both to him and to taekwondo itself.</v>

1376
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:41.050
<v Speaker 3>Cause it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it teaches them how to get teachers</v>

1377
01:06:41.051 --> 01:06:44.020
<v Speaker 3>great things to kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he was a mentor.</v>

1378
01:06:44.021 --> 01:06:47.590
<v Speaker 3>And then in high school I had this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this farmer and worked on a pig farms</v>

1379
01:06:47.591 --> 01:06:52.030
<v Speaker 3>and he was John Weirs and we didn't talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>about shit,</v>

1380
01:06:52.031 --> 01:06:54.550
<v Speaker 3>we didn't lie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't like fill me full of wisdom.</v>

1381
01:06:54.620 --> 01:06:58.190
<v Speaker 3>What we did was just worked again the</v>
<v Speaker 3>work side by side and we shoveled pink</v>

1382
01:06:58.191 --> 01:07:01.440
<v Speaker 3>shit and dumped it on the field over and</v>
<v Speaker 3>over and over.</v>

1383
01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:04.480
<v Speaker 3>And I went to college,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had this great mentor who sort of,</v>

1384
01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:07.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonchalantly took me under his wing and</v>

1385
01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:10.420
<v Speaker 3>kind of on and on throw my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1386
01:07:10.421 --> 01:07:12.130
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

1387
01:07:12.131 --> 01:07:13.810
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've spent a lot of time thinking about</v>

1388
01:07:13.811 --> 01:07:17.000
<v Speaker 3>it and I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just really wish that for,</v>

1389
01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.300
<v Speaker 3>for people or want that for people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1390
01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:21.370
<v Speaker 3>cause cause you can't rely on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>parents.</v>

1391
01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.740
<v Speaker 3>You have everything you need in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1392
01:07:23.741 --> 01:07:25.370
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too much pressure for,</v>

1393
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:28.140
<v Speaker 4>well also I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well as we were talking about earlier,</v>

1394
01:07:28.141 --> 01:07:31.800
<v Speaker 4>their parents didn't know what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were doing and their parents pass</v>

1395
01:07:31.801 --> 01:07:36.801
<v Speaker 4>didn't know what the fuck they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for a lot of us that's,</v>

1396
01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:39.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the reality that we find</v>

1397
01:07:39.391 --> 01:07:44.391
<v Speaker 4>ourselves being born into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think with doing with some of the</v>

1398
01:07:44.791 --> 01:07:49.470
<v Speaker 4>things that you've done and now also</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the amount of data and information</v>

1399
01:07:49.471 --> 01:07:54.471
<v Speaker 4>that's available today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we have a chance of affecting</v>

1400
01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:59.880
<v Speaker 4>our society and our culture and the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>we communicate with each other and just,</v>

1401
01:08:00.270 --> 01:08:02.880
<v Speaker 4>just who we are as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a species.</v>

1402
01:08:02.881 --> 01:08:04.080
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this crazy,</v>

1403
01:08:04.081 --> 01:08:07.700
<v Speaker 4>weird super organism of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are,</v>

1404
01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:10.410
<v Speaker 4>we're in a better position to change</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1405
01:08:10.450 --> 01:08:13.560
<v Speaker 4>And then then ever before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like my grandparents came over from</v>

1406
01:08:13.561 --> 01:08:17.660
<v Speaker 4>Italy and Ireland on a fucking boat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knew what the hell was going on.</v>

1407
01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:19.580
<v Speaker 4>Their parents didn't know shit and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>brought him over here.</v>

1408
01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.710
<v Speaker 4>They just heard there was a better</v>
<v Speaker 4>chance.</v>

1409
01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:23.060
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was an opportunity,</v>

1410
01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:26.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean they might've saw a photo of what</v>
<v Speaker 4>New York looked like,</v>

1411
01:08:26.481 --> 01:08:29.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they might have and they took a chance</v>

1412
01:08:29.541 --> 01:08:33.410
<v Speaker 4>and they came over here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That the difference between them and</v>

1413
01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:37.970
<v Speaker 4>what the kind of experience and the kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of access to information that your</v>

1414
01:08:37.971 --> 01:08:40.940
<v Speaker 4>children are going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where my children are going to have.</v>

1415
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:43.640
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking profound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1416
01:08:43.641 --> 01:08:46.670
<v Speaker 4>And I think we're at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're a part of something that's really</v>

1417
01:08:46.671 --> 01:08:51.671
<v Speaker 4>interesting right now and that the human</v>
<v Speaker 4>race is becoming hyper aware of all the</v>

1418
01:08:52.881 --> 01:08:57.170
<v Speaker 4>variables that are fucking it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the big ones of course,</v>

1419
01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:01.910
<v Speaker 4>is the abuse and mishandling and miss</v>
<v Speaker 4>raising of children.</v>

1420
01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:02.913
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1421
01:09:03.210 --> 01:09:04.900
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to that point,</v>

1422
01:09:04.901 --> 01:09:06.820
<v Speaker 3>there's this been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing that I've been paying</v>

1423
01:09:06.821 --> 01:09:11.350
<v Speaker 3>attention to that I think is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So as we have more information and it,</v>

1424
01:09:11.351 --> 01:09:14.440
<v Speaker 3>as things happen faster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has all of this compounds and things</v>

1425
01:09:14.441 --> 01:09:15.310
<v Speaker 3>go faster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>faster,</v>

1426
01:09:15.311 --> 01:09:19.720
<v Speaker 3>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the impact of slowing down</v>

1427
01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:23.020
<v Speaker 3>becomes very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very valuable very,</v>

1428
01:09:23.021 --> 01:09:24.160
<v Speaker 3>very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1429
01:09:24.161 --> 01:09:25.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about all these wilderness</v>

1430
01:09:25.631 --> 01:09:30.400
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also bring up like meditation or any</v>

1431
01:09:30.401 --> 01:09:34.540
<v Speaker 3>of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that as other things speed up,</v>

1432
01:09:34.570 --> 01:09:39.570
<v Speaker 3>I think that those are these things like</v>
<v Speaker 3>have the power to just smack you across</v>

1433
01:09:40.481 --> 01:09:43.330
<v Speaker 3>your face and like change six fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1434
01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:44.830
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know if this has just been</v>

1435
01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:48.280
<v Speaker 3>our observation for 10 years or so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that,</v>

1436
01:09:48.281 --> 01:09:48.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1437
01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:51.880
<v Speaker 3>150 years ago or whatever in the western</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States,</v>

1438
01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.520
<v Speaker 3>if we had slow lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we would've had a huge</v>

1439
01:09:54.521 --> 01:09:56.830
<v Speaker 3>impact by going and camping for a week.</v>

1440
01:09:57.130 --> 01:10:02.130
<v Speaker 3>But today when you're pulled out of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy digital electronic life and you go</v>

1441
01:10:02.411 --> 01:10:06.670
<v Speaker 3>back and we feel that human simplicity</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a little bit of time,</v>

1442
01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:11.140
<v Speaker 3>I think the combination of the two</v>
<v Speaker 3>offers a really powerful place.</v>

1443
01:10:11.170 --> 01:10:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you can get that awareness</v>

1444
01:10:13.931 --> 01:10:16.690
<v Speaker 3>and sort of that the impact of slowing</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

1445
01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:20.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Compounded with all of the information</v>

1446
01:10:20.111 --> 01:10:22.120
<v Speaker 3>and the power and everything that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

1447
01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:23.860
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

1448
01:10:23.861 --> 01:10:26.560
<v Speaker 3>I think we're on the verge or a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>ripe place.</v>

1449
01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:28.210
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a time where,</v>

1450
01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1451
01:10:30.131 --> 01:10:33.130
<v Speaker 3>people can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can really change themselves all a lot</v>

1452
01:10:33.131 --> 01:10:35.170
<v Speaker 3>quicker or maybe even a lot more than</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think is.</v>

1453
01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:40.240
<v Speaker 3>That's another thing I would love for</v>
<v Speaker 3>people just to think or believe that</v>

1454
01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:42.220
<v Speaker 3>things could be different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they could change.</v>

1455
01:10:42.221 --> 01:10:43.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I,</v>

1456
01:10:43.281 --> 01:10:45.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I've been involved in for so</v>

1457
01:10:45.821 --> 01:10:47.320
<v Speaker 3>long and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is possible.</v>

1458
01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:51.190
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think also any kind of a trip,</v>

1459
01:10:51.730 --> 01:10:56.050
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a meditative trip or even</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a camping trip or something where</v>

1460
01:10:56.051 --> 01:10:59.680
<v Speaker 4>you have that opportunity to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>reset and reassess,</v>

1461
01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:04.210
<v Speaker 4>it gives you sovereignty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gives you personal sovereignty instead</v>

1462
01:11:04.211 --> 01:11:06.340
<v Speaker 4>of just being just caught up in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>momentum.</v>

1463
01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:08.320
<v Speaker 4>A buddy of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friend,</v>

1464
01:11:08.321 --> 01:11:09.700
<v Speaker 4>Ari,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should fear again,</v>

1465
01:11:09.790 --> 01:11:11.950
<v Speaker 4>bringing them up again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was with another buddy of mine,</v>

1466
01:11:11.951 --> 01:11:13.890
<v Speaker 4>big Jay Oakerson and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1467
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:17.820
<v Speaker 4>they were watching this couple make out</v>
<v Speaker 4>through a window.</v>

1468
01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:21.870
<v Speaker 4>They were doing the podcast and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were on the roof and they were</v>

1469
01:11:21.871 --> 01:11:24.750
<v Speaker 4>watching this couple through the window.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a couple making out.</v>

1470
01:11:24.751 --> 01:11:27.870
<v Speaker 4>And then in the middle of making out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they started checking their phones.</v>

1471
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:32.670
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what's going on today.</v>

1472
01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:34.440
<v Speaker 4>I was kind of sad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of sad,</v>

1473
01:11:34.441 --> 01:11:37.380
<v Speaker 4>but maybe they'd go suck in bed for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

1474
01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:38.700
<v Speaker 4>But if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1475
01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:43.350
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to not just have all this access</v>

1476
01:11:43.351 --> 01:11:48.351
<v Speaker 4>to data but also have the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 4>decide what you take in and what you</v>

1477
01:11:50.161 --> 01:11:51.780
<v Speaker 4>don't take care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's,</v>

1478
01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.930
<v Speaker 4>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're passing the wildlife viewing area</v>

1479
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:57.570
<v Speaker 4>cause I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well they think they're talking about</v>

1480
01:11:57.571 --> 01:11:58.710
<v Speaker 4>the humans that live here</v>

1481
01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:04.030
<v Speaker 3>near in the middle of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1482
01:12:04.031 --> 01:12:06.700
<v Speaker 3>I think it's kind of super a super</v>
<v Speaker 3>charged time for that man.</v>

1483
01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.970
<v Speaker 3>And it's cool to see people like</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally change your life.</v>

1484
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.170
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one other thing,</v>

1485
01:12:11.171 --> 01:12:12.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm involved in his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1486
01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.810
<v Speaker 3>I started a men's group in Bozeman where</v>
<v Speaker 3>I live in Montana and I've been a part</v>

1487
01:12:16.811 --> 01:12:18.520
<v Speaker 3>of men's groups for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a while,</v>

1488
01:12:18.521 --> 01:12:22.540
<v Speaker 3>probably six or seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's something that's really not</v>

1489
01:12:22.541 --> 01:12:24.460
<v Speaker 3>understood or really not even knowing</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

1490
01:12:24.461 --> 01:12:29.170
<v Speaker 3>but really odd is it's a group of guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>that get together to really practice</v>

1491
01:12:29.171 --> 01:12:34.171
<v Speaker 3>being completely real and I'm really</v>
<v Speaker 3>clear all the bullshit out of the way</v>

1492
01:12:34.841 --> 01:12:37.750
<v Speaker 3>and it's been incredibly helpful for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me.</v>

1493
01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:40.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where was I going with that?</v>

1494
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:43.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But just that I've been party are privy</v>

1495
01:12:43.061 --> 01:12:46.960
<v Speaker 3>to so many people just sort of like just</v>
<v Speaker 3>changing like,</v>

1496
01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a lot more fucking happy and a lot</v>

1497
01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:54.380
<v Speaker 3>more productive and I think it's easy to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get stuck in thinking that things just</v>

1498
01:12:54.461 --> 01:12:57.190
<v Speaker 3>are how they are and what sovereignty is</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge.</v>

1499
01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:59.710
<v Speaker 3>That's the biggest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like owning what you feel,</v>

1500
01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:02.440
<v Speaker 3>honoring what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>owning who you are,</v>

1501
01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:03.300
<v Speaker 3>all of that.</v>

1502
01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:05.280
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also a lot of times people that get</v>

1503
01:13:05.281 --> 01:13:08.720
<v Speaker 4>out of high school to going to college</v>
<v Speaker 4>and get out of college and get a job and</v>

1504
01:13:08.721 --> 01:13:12.570
<v Speaker 4>get a job and start the career they push</v>
<v Speaker 4>forth and their career and before they</v>

1505
01:13:12.571 --> 01:13:17.571
<v Speaker 4>know what they're fucking 40 years old</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they can't stop the momentum of the</v>

1506
01:13:19.021 --> 01:13:20.970
<v Speaker 4>life and then not enjoying it.</v>

1507
01:13:21.190 --> 01:13:21.941
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're desperate,</v>

1508
01:13:21.941 --> 01:13:22.850
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're quiet.</v>

1509
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:23.860
<v Speaker 3>They're quietly desperate.</v>

1510
01:13:24.010 --> 01:13:25.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't that Toro.</v>

1511
01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:28.150
<v Speaker 4>Most men lead lives of quiet</v>
<v Speaker 4>desperation.</v>

1512
01:13:28.190 --> 01:13:30.400
<v Speaker 4>It's such a great fucking quote.</v>

1513
01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:34.490
<v Speaker 3>So why aren't we teaching every 17 year</v>
<v Speaker 3>old kid who's coming out of high school</v>

1514
01:13:34.491 --> 01:13:35.360
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1515
01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:38.060
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's probably your future.</v>

1516
01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:39.950
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you get on top of this.</v>

1517
01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:43.270
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How you teach people like this.</v>

1518
01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:46.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They listen to podcasts to hear people</v>

1519
01:13:46.451 --> 01:13:49.840
<v Speaker 4>talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They realize that their parents didn't</v>

1520
01:13:49.841 --> 01:13:53.210
<v Speaker 4>have a fucking awesome information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1521
01:13:53.230 --> 01:13:57.340
<v Speaker 4>and look a lot of pants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they mean the right thing when they tell</v>

1522
01:13:57.341 --> 01:13:59.920
<v Speaker 4>them get a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't take any chances.</v>

1523
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:01.143
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>y'all,</v>

1524
01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:02.420
<v Speaker 4>you got a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

1525
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.861
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will.</v>

1526
01:14:02.861 --> 01:14:04.420
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dreams don't pay the bills.</v>

1527
01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:07.210
<v Speaker 4>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not doing that because they're</v>

1528
01:14:07.211 --> 01:14:10.300
<v Speaker 4>assholes for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're doing that because that's been</v>

1529
01:14:10.301 --> 01:14:11.890
<v Speaker 4>their experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their life.</v>

1530
01:14:11.891 --> 01:14:14.230
<v Speaker 4>And they don't want their kid to be a</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking idiot.</v>

1531
01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.870
<v Speaker 4>And they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't understand.</v>

1532
01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:18.670
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't know.</v>

1533
01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:20.830
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so listen up fuckers,</v>

1534
01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:22.090
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look around,</v>

1535
01:14:22.091 --> 01:14:24.880
<v Speaker 4>look around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look around and notice how many adults</v>

1536
01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:29.940
<v Speaker 4>either have shitty lives they don't like</v>
<v Speaker 4>or are like going through massive</v>

1537
01:14:30.041 --> 01:14:33.760
<v Speaker 4>amounts of self help or therapy or all</v>
<v Speaker 4>these things at all ages.</v>

1538
01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:35.410
<v Speaker 4>And not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1539
01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:36.790
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you thinking antidepressants</v>

1540
01:14:36.791 --> 01:14:40.540
<v Speaker 4>come from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did that many people have broken brains</v>

1541
01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.530
<v Speaker 4>or is there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1542
01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:45.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm not denying that there's most</v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly quite a few people that have</v>

1543
01:14:45.971 --> 01:14:50.140
<v Speaker 4>natural chemical imbalances and</v>
<v Speaker 4>pharmaceutical drugs can benefit them.</v>

1544
01:14:50.170 --> 01:14:51.100
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>

1545
01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.510
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No doubt about it.</v>

1546
01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:57.490
<v Speaker 4>But I know for a fact there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who get medicated because they</v>

1547
01:14:57.491 --> 01:15:01.450
<v Speaker 4>fucking hate their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instead of picking a life that you enjoy</v>

1548
01:15:01.451 --> 01:15:05.920
<v Speaker 4>or working towards developing your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's something that you would enjoy,</v>

1549
01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:07.910
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the,</v>

1550
01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.380
<v Speaker 4>some of the most satisfying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1551
01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:11.770
<v Speaker 4>email and twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tweets,</v>

1552
01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.450
<v Speaker 4>twitters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tweet messages,</v>

1553
01:15:13.451 --> 01:15:15.880
<v Speaker 4>and facebook things that I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>gotten is people that have listened to</v>

1554
01:15:15.881 --> 01:15:17.410
<v Speaker 4>this podcast and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

1555
01:15:17.710 --> 01:15:22.450
<v Speaker 4>I realized I am 36 and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always wanted to do this and I'm</v>

1556
01:15:22.451 --> 01:15:24.850
<v Speaker 4>going to quit my fucking job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm gonna figure out how to do that.</v>

1557
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:27.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to work towards that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to save up some money and I'm</v>

1558
01:15:27.941 --> 01:15:30.700
<v Speaker 4>gonna fucking whatever it is I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to make pottery.</v>

1559
01:15:30.701 --> 01:15:33.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to start fucking selling my</v>
<v Speaker 4>paintings.</v>

1560
01:15:33.351 --> 01:15:37.210
<v Speaker 4>So whatever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's got a thing.</v>

1561
01:15:37.330 --> 01:15:40.000
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't have a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>find the fucking thing.</v>

1562
01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:45.220
<v Speaker 4>But you can't think that that whole like</v>
<v Speaker 4>work,</v>

1563
01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:49.200
<v Speaker 4>get a good job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get your benefits and,</v>

1564
01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:51.580
<v Speaker 4>and don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't do anything stupid because you</v>

1565
01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:53.860
<v Speaker 4>don't want to get fired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That life is bullshit.</v>

1566
01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.260
<v Speaker 4>That is bullshit life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>

1567
01:15:56.890 --> 01:16:01.180
<v Speaker 4>If you got a good job that you enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a great life and then your job</v>

1568
01:16:01.181 --> 01:16:02.980
<v Speaker 4>doesn't feel like a job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1569
01:16:02.981 --> 01:16:05.320
<v Speaker 4>even though it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can be challenging and difficult.</v>

1570
01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:07.630
<v Speaker 4>If you could find something you actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>enjoy doing,</v>

1571
01:16:07.631 --> 01:16:12.610
<v Speaker 4>your life will be immeasurably better</v>
<v Speaker 4>than if you're just grinding it out</v>

1572
01:16:12.611 --> 01:16:17.520
<v Speaker 4>waiting for that five o'clock fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>Buzzer to come right away.</v>

1573
01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:19.990
<v Speaker 4>I like to talk about it though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's a really important</v>

1574
01:16:19.991 --> 01:16:24.130
<v Speaker 4>difference is to be descriptive rather</v>
<v Speaker 4>than prescriptive.</v>

1575
01:16:24.131 --> 01:16:26.650
<v Speaker 4>Because if you try to force yourself</v>
<v Speaker 4>into,</v>

1576
01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:30.310
<v Speaker 4>if you're trying to be Joe Rogan or if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to be anybody else out</v>

1577
01:16:30.311 --> 01:16:32.010
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want that life like,</v>

1578
01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:34.420
<v Speaker 4>like good luck with that in the long</v>
<v Speaker 4>run.</v>

1579
01:16:34.421 --> 01:16:39.070
<v Speaker 4>Like I feel like you have to sink into</v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself and just actually fucking be</v>

1580
01:16:39.071 --> 01:16:41.080
<v Speaker 4>who you are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to find though,</v>

1581
01:16:41.081 --> 01:16:42.880
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is hard to find who you are.</v>

1582
01:16:42.910 --> 01:16:44.370
<v Speaker 4>It totally is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's the,</v>

1583
01:16:44.530 --> 01:16:48.590
<v Speaker 4>I think that's your job until you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>until you are who you are and that's</v>

1584
01:16:48.591 --> 01:16:50.350
<v Speaker 4>wrong the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't be embarrassed if you're</v>

1585
01:16:50.351 --> 01:16:53.380
<v Speaker 4>pretending to be somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause I think we all get that when</v>

1586
01:16:53.381 --> 01:16:57.010
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to find yourself telling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Me and I most certainly have been</v>

1587
01:16:57.011 --> 01:17:00.470
<v Speaker 4>massively influenced by a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I respected and,</v>

1588
01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:04.240
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and listen to them or watch them or saw</v>

1589
01:17:04.241 --> 01:17:05.800
<v Speaker 4>their work or whatever it is.</v>

1590
01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:11.220
<v Speaker 4>That's okay as long as you eventually</v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out who you are and then it kind</v>

1591
01:17:11.571 --> 01:17:13.580
<v Speaker 4>of happened to you before you even know</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1592
01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.650
<v Speaker 4>Like when I was young man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always,</v>

1593
01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:18.680
<v Speaker 4>I never felt very secure and I always</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

1594
01:17:18.681 --> 01:17:22.910
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I could fucking be someone.</v>

1595
01:17:22.970 --> 01:17:26.570
<v Speaker 4>Like all these people that I admire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I wish I could figure out how to be</v>

1596
01:17:26.571 --> 01:17:29.600
<v Speaker 4>me instead of wishing I was all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>other people.</v>

1597
01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:31.520
<v Speaker 4>And somewhere along the line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just Kinda,</v>

1598
01:17:31.670 --> 01:17:35.570
<v Speaker 4>if you pursue what you actually enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it kind of happens totally.</v>

1599
01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:39.140
<v Speaker 4>But it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not an easy process and it's a</v>

1600
01:17:39.141 --> 01:17:42.860
<v Speaker 4>process of self reflection and you gotta</v>
<v Speaker 4>be honest.</v>

1601
01:17:42.861 --> 01:17:45.260
<v Speaker 4>And that's where these moments that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about,</v>

1602
01:17:45.261 --> 01:17:49.100
<v Speaker 4>like meditative moments or moments where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can go to the mountains and be by</v>

1603
01:17:49.101 --> 01:17:51.800
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those moments are huge because they give</v>

1604
01:17:51.801 --> 01:17:56.801
<v Speaker 4>you this opportunity to maybe examine</v>
<v Speaker 4>your ideas a little more closely instead</v>

1605
01:17:58.221 --> 01:18:00.980
<v Speaker 4>of just constantly being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>

1606
01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:04.660
<v Speaker 4>just inundated with other people's</v>
<v Speaker 4>opinions about what you,</v>

1607
01:18:04.670 --> 01:18:06.500
<v Speaker 2>you should have your own experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1608

<v Speaker 2>You gotta just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just got to live and you got to</v>

1609
01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:10.490
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think you've got to</v>

1610
01:18:10.491 --> 01:18:13.790
<v Speaker 2>experience as much as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether that's a trip around the world</v>

1611
01:18:13.791 --> 01:18:18.230
<v Speaker 2>are traveling or to a different place or</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hallucinogenic experience it done in a</v>

1612
01:18:18.231 --> 01:18:21.560
<v Speaker 2>safe way or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like you got to,</v>

1613
01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.660
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to find yourself.</v>

1614
01:18:23.661 --> 01:18:24.321
<v Speaker 2>You'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He got wires all over them.</v>

1616
01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:29.570
<v Speaker 2>And if you're born in this fucking town</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're driving through,</v>

1617
01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:34.430
<v Speaker 2>good luck</v>
<v Speaker 2>handing out cash pay day loans.</v>

1618
01:18:34.730 --> 01:18:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in a place way smaller and</v>

1619
01:18:36.741 --> 01:18:39.570
<v Speaker 2>tidier than this real review.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan Dodi is,</v>

1620
01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:43.070
<v Speaker 2>he made it through 600 people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>600 how many of them you fuck?</v>

1621
01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.360
<v Speaker 2>We left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We left when I was in sixth grade.</v>

1622
01:18:47.361 --> 01:18:51.500
<v Speaker 2>So unfortunately these are</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably better off that way.</v>

1623
01:18:51.710 --> 01:18:53.180
<v Speaker 2>What's your fuck people they think</v>

<v Speaker 2>casino and a 24 hour gas station.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I bought a cigarette smoking.</v>

1647
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:56.150
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people here can describe with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gun tastes like in your mouth.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that that's a possibility.</v>

1650
01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:12.540

<v Speaker 4>old bar,</v>

1666
01:21:00.721 --> 01:21:03.810
<v Speaker 4>like that old barn that we were passing</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that little shack or whatever</v>

<v Speaker 4>distressed wood.</v>

<v Speaker 4>my liking.</v>

01:21:21.370 --> 01:21:23.790
<v Speaker 4>It's at half mast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did somebody die while we were in the</v>

1674

<v Speaker 4>woods?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some shit.</v>

1675
01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:29.760

<v Speaker 4>things that went down for seven days.</v>

1689
01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:07.110
<v Speaker 4>That people can get robbed like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you hear about terrible things in</v>

1690
01:22:07.111 --> 01:22:10.230
<v Speaker 4>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the good news or the good fact about</v>

<v Speaker 4>without having,</v>

1692
01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:17.640
<v Speaker 4>it's not like you live your life in some</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of a Mormon missionary factory and</v>

1693
01:22:17.641 --> 01:22:21.810
<v Speaker 4>then they send you out there to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>awful parts of the world and all of a</v>

<v Speaker 4>brutal dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what's a dictator like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>out there and there's some Kim Jong Un</v>
<v Speaker 4>type dudes in the world.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and they started driving out in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>jungle.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's the other thing that happened in</v>

1717
01:23:26.981 --> 01:23:30.340
<v Speaker 4>Brazil recently presented Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 4>student from Australia,</v>

1718
01:23:30.341 --> 01:23:33.610
<v Speaker 4>I believe was out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got kidnapped by these cops.</v>

1719
01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:37.420
<v Speaker 4>Cops took him to two ATM machines and</v>
<v Speaker 4>made them withdraw money.</v>

1720
01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:38.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1721
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:40.790
<v Speaker 4>Cops,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cops.</v>

1722
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:44.920
<v Speaker 4>Fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to trust them.</v>

1723
01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:48.070
<v Speaker 4>But you know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like again,</v>

1724
01:23:48.430 --> 01:23:51.220
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck happened to them and what</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened?</v>

1725
01:23:51.250 --> 01:23:54.040
<v Speaker 4>What happened to these people that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>robbing these people?</v>

1726
01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:56.260
<v Speaker 4>Something bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1727
01:23:56.470 --> 01:24:00.790
<v Speaker 4>it's not necessarily 100% their fault</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's who they've become.</v>

1728
01:24:01.630 --> 01:24:06.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm not taking away ownership of their</v>
<v Speaker 4>own actions,</v>

1729
01:24:06.281 --> 01:24:10.780
<v Speaker 4>but you got to think about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>development of their ideas,</v>

1730
01:24:10.990 --> 01:24:14.680
<v Speaker 4>how it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had this friend of mine on the podcast</v>

1731
01:24:14.681 --> 01:24:19.150
<v Speaker 4>recently and he was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he grew up in a standards Byron bowers</v>

1732
01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:24.500
<v Speaker 4>and he grew up in a really poor area of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Georgia and a lot of crime where he was</v>

1733
01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:30.940
<v Speaker 4>just a lot of like really fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 4>family environments and he was saying</v>

1734
01:24:31.121 --> 01:24:35.170
<v Speaker 4>that when we thought about like robin</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like go into a store and</v>

1735
01:24:35.171 --> 01:24:37.930
<v Speaker 4>stealing something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we didn't think it was a bad thing</v>

1736
01:24:38.170 --> 01:24:40.570
<v Speaker 4>because that's how you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how you get things.</v>

1737
01:24:40.571 --> 01:24:43.210
<v Speaker 4>You've got to go get it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to go steal and that it was</v>

1738
01:24:43.211 --> 01:24:45.020
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what you grew up.</v>

1739
01:24:45.050 --> 01:24:50.050
<v Speaker 4>Now he's a successful comedian and he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing well and it's like he can step</v>

1740
01:24:50.591 --> 01:24:55.591
<v Speaker 4>back and have the hindsight vision of</v>
<v Speaker 4>his current state and like realize like,</v>

1741
01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.100
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was why I thought that way.</v>

1742
01:25:00.150 --> 01:25:00.983
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1743
01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:06.640
<v Speaker 4>And I'm sure these guys that robbed you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they didn't have a fucking pretty</v>

1744
01:25:06.641 --> 01:25:07.660
<v Speaker 4>upbringing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was nothing,</v>

1745
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:10.810
<v Speaker 4>it's not like they went from a gated</v>
<v Speaker 4>community to robin people in Peru.</v>

1746
01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.340
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not like they are doing it because</v>

1747
01:25:12.341 --> 01:25:14.830
<v Speaker 4>they were just morally poor people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1748
01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:16.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were.</v>

1749
01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:19.420
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what made them that way?</v>

1750
01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:23.200
<v Speaker 4>Think about your own little boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's two months old.</v>

1751
01:25:23.530 --> 01:25:28.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean you get to shape what that boy</v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes as he becomes a man and someone</v>

1752
01:25:29.921 --> 01:25:32.350
<v Speaker 4>did that to the Guy who robbed you in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Peru,</v>

1753
01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:33.640
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that is,</v>

1754
01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:38.320
<v Speaker 4>that's how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it really sort of highlights the</v>

1755
01:25:38.321 --> 01:25:42.730
<v Speaker 4>bizarre nature of humans raising humans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should really be raised by robots.</v>

1756
01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:45.310
<v Speaker 4>We should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1757
01:25:45.311 --> 01:25:47.890
<v Speaker 4>someone should come along and just make</v>
<v Speaker 4>the perfect human razor.</v>

1758
01:25:48.490 --> 01:25:49.960
<v Speaker 4>Now obviously not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1759
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.520
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you're going to do a great job,</v>

1760
01:25:51.521 --> 01:25:54.010
<v Speaker 4>but for people who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whose parents are going to do a shitty</v>

1761
01:25:54.011 --> 01:25:56.410
<v Speaker 4>job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if they're going to come up</v>

1762
01:25:56.411 --> 01:25:58.960
<v Speaker 4>with technology one day and I think they</v>
<v Speaker 4>will,</v>

1763
01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 4>that will be able to install better</v>
<v Speaker 4>memories and a better pattern of</v>

1764
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:07.070
<v Speaker 2>behavior in a person's brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like almost like they're going to be</v>

1765
01:26:07.071 --> 01:26:09.160
<v Speaker 2>able to defrag your hard drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1766
01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:11.510
<v Speaker 2>You mean just like with a click of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>switch,</v>

1767
01:26:11.511 --> 01:26:14.870
<v Speaker 2>but he's a little hook you up to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like say if somebody gave you a</v>

1768
01:26:14.871 --> 01:26:15.681
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1769
01:26:15.681 --> 01:26:17.810
<v Speaker 2>But it has a virus on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all fucked up.</v>

1770
01:26:17.811 --> 01:26:21.320
<v Speaker 2>Every time you check your email and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sends you dick pictures and it takes you</v>

1771
01:26:21.321 --> 01:26:23.720
<v Speaker 2>to rush an escort sites like you mother</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuckers,</v>

1772
01:26:23.721 --> 01:26:26.510
<v Speaker 2>which you did in my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the your your computer,</v>

1773
01:26:26.511 --> 01:26:27.650
<v Speaker 2>your computer is fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1774
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:30.470
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you bring it down to the computer</v>

1775
01:26:30.471 --> 01:26:31.161
<v Speaker 2>store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy can go,</v>

1776
01:26:31.161 --> 01:26:32.210
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got a virus.</v>

1777
01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:34.070
<v Speaker 2>Here's what we're gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna,</v>

1778
01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:38.990
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna wipe your hard drive clean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reinstall your operating system,</v>

1779
01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:42.170
<v Speaker 2>and then I'll back up your crucial files</v>
<v Speaker 2>and add them later.</v>

1780
01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1781
01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:47.090
<v Speaker 2>that's got to be the future of human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

1782
01:26:47.210 --> 01:26:50.420
<v Speaker 2>I think you're totally right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think that there's some things</v>

1783
01:26:50.421 --> 01:26:54.260
<v Speaker 2>that are acting in that way already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's participate in your child's</v>

1784
01:26:54.261 --> 01:26:55.970
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's uncomfortable suit,</v>

1785
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.300
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

1786
01:26:57.620 --> 01:26:58.401
<v Speaker 2>Massive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1787
01:26:58.401 --> 01:26:59.450
<v Speaker 2>they're sharing the message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1788
01:26:59.451 --> 01:27:02.210
<v Speaker 2>but what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's uncomfortable,</v>

1789
01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:06.850
<v Speaker 2>even if it's an that's a billboard here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle of nowhere participating in</v>

1790
01:27:06.851 --> 01:27:08.990
<v Speaker 2>your child's life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's uncomfortable.</v>

1791
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:12.200
<v Speaker 2>Who though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck sees that billboard and goes,</v>

1792
01:27:12.201 --> 01:27:16.040
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stop ignoring my kids doing</v>

1793
01:27:16.041 --> 01:27:19.360
<v Speaker 2>math.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to participate even if it's</v>

1794
01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:21.500
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable because I need my math.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1795
01:27:21.501 --> 01:27:23.810
<v Speaker 2>fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that sign makes it happen for one</v>

1796
01:27:23.811 --> 01:27:25.140
<v Speaker 2>fucking kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1797
01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:26.850
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

1798
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:30.320
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was saying there's a lot of recent</v>

1799
01:27:31.130 --> 01:27:34.520
<v Speaker 2>research and study that that has</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

1800
01:27:34.521 --> 01:27:35.354
<v Speaker 2>specifically</v>

1801
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:37.640
<v Speaker 3>ptsd and in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that realm</v>

1802
01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:44.260
<v Speaker 3>that shows how memories and our</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences when we're young and older,</v>

1803
01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:49.960
<v Speaker 3>how they truly are stored in our body</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that there are techniques available</v>

1804
01:27:50.841 --> 01:27:54.530
<v Speaker 3>now that truly can unlock and free</v>
<v Speaker 3>those.</v>

1805
01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:55.510
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1806
01:27:56.140 --> 01:28:01.140
<v Speaker 3>it's not psychology in the sense of just</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk therapy or just figuring things out</v>

1807
01:28:01.161 --> 01:28:02.570
<v Speaker 3>or analyzing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

1808
01:28:02.571 --> 01:28:06.020
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's much more a body body based.</v>

1809
01:28:06.021 --> 01:28:10.130
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is that if there is an</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience that happens,</v>

1810
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:14.450
<v Speaker 3>the natural human ranges too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's overwhelming,</v>

1811
01:28:14.451 --> 01:28:15.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fight,</v>

1812
01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:21.220
<v Speaker 3>you run or flight or you freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's the freezing that these people</v>

1813
01:28:23.961 --> 01:28:28.520
<v Speaker 3>will argue that things literally get</v>
<v Speaker 3>like locked and etched into your bodies,</v>

1814
01:28:28.521 --> 01:28:31.040
<v Speaker 3>either yourselves or your musculature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1815
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:32.420
<v Speaker 3>I dunno what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever it is,</v>

1816
01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:36.740
<v Speaker 3>but that through processes of awareness</v>
<v Speaker 3>and relaxation and,</v>

1817
01:28:36.741 --> 01:28:40.200
<v Speaker 3>and being able to go into that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really can open and release a lot of</v>

1818
01:28:40.201 --> 01:28:40.300
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1819
01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:43.430
<v Speaker 3>So it's not an automatic hit a button</v>
<v Speaker 3>defrag the entire thing.</v>

1820
01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:46.190
<v Speaker 3>But there are things that people do</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1821
01:28:46.370 --> 01:28:49.640
<v Speaker 3>that truly work in that way and in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>

1822
01:28:49.670 --> 01:28:53.840
<v Speaker 3>And it's not mainstream at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1823
01:28:53.930 --> 01:28:56.840
<v Speaker 3>I think it will be one day and actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>really think it will be.</v>

1824
01:28:57.350 --> 01:29:00.200
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that there's proof now that</v>

1825
01:29:00.201 --> 01:29:03.690
<v Speaker 3>things are more malleable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our memories are more malleable,</v>

1826
01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:08.730
<v Speaker 3>are sort of set patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although they're very firm can be</v>

1827
01:29:08.731 --> 01:29:10.860
<v Speaker 3>shifted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's a lot of hope in</v>

1828
01:29:10.861 --> 01:29:12.120
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's really cool.</v>

1829
01:29:12.121 --> 01:29:12.954
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1830
01:29:13.170 --> 01:29:16.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like that's an accepted</v>
<v Speaker 3>viewpoint at this point.</v>

1831
01:29:16.530 --> 01:29:18.060
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's being more and more</v>

1832
01:29:18.061 --> 01:29:20.400
<v Speaker 4>accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people are understanding now</v>

1833
01:29:20.401 --> 01:29:25.401
<v Speaker 4>more and more that there's a method that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the human mind has sort of undergone in</v>

1834
01:29:26.851 --> 01:29:28.950
<v Speaker 4>order to take these memories in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>first place.</v>

1835
01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:34.160
<v Speaker 4>And if there's a way to reexamine those</v>
<v Speaker 4>initial ideas and form new ideas based</v>

1836
01:29:36.450 --> 01:29:41.280
<v Speaker 4>on better data and a better</v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding of how your actual,</v>

1837
01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:44.520
<v Speaker 4>your mind works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very few people know how their mind</v>

1838
01:29:44.521 --> 01:29:47.700
<v Speaker 4>works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just know that I get mad when this</v>

1839
01:29:47.701 --> 01:29:48.534
<v Speaker 4>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1840
01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:51.460
<v Speaker 4>This pisses me off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know what,</v>

1841
01:29:51.570 --> 01:29:55.620
<v Speaker 4>one thing that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a beautiful idea that has been going</v>

1842
01:29:55.621 --> 01:30:00.621
<v Speaker 4>around is look at something when it</v>
<v Speaker 4>happens and decide how to make that a</v>

1843
01:30:03.901 --> 01:30:08.901
<v Speaker 4>positive for you and decide how to give</v>
<v Speaker 4>that thing meaning because nothing truly</v>

1844
01:30:09.751 --> 01:30:12.810
<v Speaker 4>has any meaning other than the meaning</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you give it.</v>

1845
01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:17.700
<v Speaker 4>And the meaning that I might have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>something might be very different than</v>

1846
01:30:17.701 --> 01:30:19.710
<v Speaker 4>you would have for the exact same</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

1847
01:30:19.710 --> 01:30:23.940
<v Speaker 4>And we don't even know who's right or</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong until you look at like where that</v>

1848
01:30:23.941 --> 01:30:25.750
<v Speaker 4>path takes you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I might look at it,</v>

1849
01:30:25.751 --> 01:30:27.960
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what 10 toady was right.</v>

1850
01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:29.940
<v Speaker 4>I should just let that brush off my</v>
<v Speaker 4>shoulders.</v>

1851
01:30:29.941 --> 01:30:31.920
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he did and now he's doing great.</v>

1852
01:30:32.110 --> 01:30:34.020
<v Speaker 4>Me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm still carrying around that one</v>

1853
01:30:34.021 --> 01:30:35.550
<v Speaker 4>fucked up experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1854
01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:39.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's people that are still</v>
<v Speaker 4>repeating arguments that they had in the</v>

1855
01:30:39.481 --> 01:30:42.050
<v Speaker 4>ninth grade while they're in their car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're sitting there going,</v>

1856
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:44.940
<v Speaker 4>this motherfucker thinks you can get</v>
<v Speaker 4>away with that off to cause us.</v>

1857
01:30:45.210 --> 01:30:46.550
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go fucking foreign number.</v>

1858
01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:48.390
<v Speaker 4>I know for sure tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>girl.</v>

1859
01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:49.253
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1860
01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:50.193
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of,</v>

1861
01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:54.660
<v Speaker 4>a lot of stuff that we carry around in</v>
<v Speaker 4>our brains and we don't know why it's</v>

1862
01:30:54.661 --> 01:30:57.270
<v Speaker 4>even there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just bouncing around and he got to</v>

1863
01:30:57.271 --> 01:30:58.840
<v Speaker 4>do a cleanup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1864
01:30:59.000 --> 01:30:59.833
<v Speaker 4>de Frag.</v>

1865
01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:03.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I think one of the best tools to</v>

1866
01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:06.220
<v Speaker 3>begin that entire process is simple</v>
<v Speaker 3>mindfulness practices,</v>

1867
01:31:06.221 --> 01:31:08.500
<v Speaker 3>which are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what that means is that when</v>

1868
01:31:08.501 --> 01:31:12.550
<v Speaker 3>something fucked up happens and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to immediately have that knee jerk</v>

1869
01:31:12.551 --> 01:31:14.410
<v Speaker 3>reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all it is is that you,</v>

1870
01:31:14.411 --> 01:31:16.550
<v Speaker 3>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you keep it a little fucking space and</v>

1871
01:31:16.551 --> 01:31:19.660
<v Speaker 3>you let it be there and then you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>decide to freak out or do whatever you</v>

1872
01:31:19.661 --> 01:31:20.060
<v Speaker 3>want.</v>

1873
01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:23.630
<v Speaker 4>Give it a lot of space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Give it a lot of space and think about</v>

1874
01:31:23.631 --> 01:31:24.620
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't,</v>

1875
01:31:24.621 --> 01:31:29.621
<v Speaker 4>don't let the momentum of every event</v>
<v Speaker 4>run your life because you'll just be</v>

1876
01:31:29.901 --> 01:31:34.901
<v Speaker 4>bouncing from one catastrophe to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>next and mindfulness is like a term that</v>

1877
01:31:36.081 --> 01:31:39.830
<v Speaker 4>gets really bandied about a lot lately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think the way you're describing it</v>

1878
01:31:39.831 --> 01:31:43.220
<v Speaker 4>as she is very important like under</v>
<v Speaker 4>examine these things.</v>

1879
01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:44.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

1880
01:31:44.370 --> 01:31:44.751
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

1881
01:31:44.751 --> 01:31:46.370
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an overused terminance and a</v>

1882
01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:48.220
<v Speaker 3>misunderstood term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think in,</v>

1883
01:31:48.430 --> 01:31:51.810
<v Speaker 3>it's a very simple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>practical way.</v>

1884
01:31:51.811 --> 01:31:55.160
<v Speaker 3>It's just being able to just being aware</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what's happening,</v>

1885
01:31:55.210 --> 01:31:55.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1886
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:58.030
<v Speaker 4>and being in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being in the moment.</v>

1887
01:31:58.031 --> 01:32:00.490
<v Speaker 4>Don't live in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thinking about the argument that you got</v>

1888
01:32:00.491 --> 01:32:03.130
<v Speaker 4>in the ninth grade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't think about your future.</v>

1889
01:32:03.131 --> 01:32:06.730
<v Speaker 4>Only think about this moment right now</v>
<v Speaker 4>because this is what you have.</v>

1890
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:09.460
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and I are in this car driving down</v>

1891
01:32:09.461 --> 01:32:12.940
<v Speaker 4>this godforsaken shit hole highway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We could get hit in the head with a</v>

1892
01:32:12.941 --> 01:32:15.760
<v Speaker 4>fucking media before this podcast even</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes it to the Internet.</v>

1893
01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:18.440
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're assuming right now as we speak in</v>

1894
01:32:18.441 --> 01:32:19.810
<v Speaker 4>the dimension of this is going to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

1895
01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:22.060
<v Speaker 4>but it might not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might not.</v>

1896
01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:26.700
<v Speaker 3>I like what you said about you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking things as learning opportunities,</v>

1897
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:31.080
<v Speaker 3>you know in general that that just</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything in life that happens to you,</v>

1898
01:32:31.081 --> 01:32:34.620
<v Speaker 3>whether it's good or bad is an</v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunity you can capitalize them.</v>

1899
01:32:34.621 --> 01:32:36.090
<v Speaker 3>Just cause you can learn from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know</v>

1900
01:32:36.170 --> 01:32:37.310
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

1901
01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:40.430
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to break free of the parents</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you used to have,</v>

1902
01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:44.390
<v Speaker 4>that's where I really advocate self help</v>
<v Speaker 4>books,</v>

1903
01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:45.890
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though like a lot of people think</v>

1904
01:32:45.891 --> 01:32:49.490
<v Speaker 4>self help books are bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know why their bullshit because most</v>

1905
01:32:49.491 --> 01:32:52.190
<v Speaker 4>people don't really listen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't really know.</v>

1906
01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:56.090
<v Speaker 4>They don't do anything to try to change</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pattern of behavior that they're</v>

1907
01:32:56.091 --> 01:32:58.760
<v Speaker 4>stuck in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just read the book and you go,</v>

1908
01:32:58.790 --> 01:33:03.530
<v Speaker 4>oh well they don't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to do something about it.</v>

1909
01:33:03.531 --> 01:33:06.280
<v Speaker 4>But being inspired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1910
01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:10.980
<v Speaker 4>even sometimes a fucking really good</v>
<v Speaker 4>movie can change your life because it,</v>

1911
01:33:10.981 --> 01:33:14.480
<v Speaker 4>it'll make a little incremental change</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a certain direction.</v>

1912
01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:18.840
<v Speaker 4>And then over time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that could be a gigantic factor in</v>

1913
01:33:18.841 --> 01:33:23.330
<v Speaker 4>determining your happiness or your</v>
<v Speaker 4>unhappiness depending on like how you</v>

1914
01:33:23.331 --> 01:33:24.770
<v Speaker 4>choose to behave and think.</v>

1915
01:33:24.890 --> 01:33:27.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a big stigma to against</v>

1916
01:33:28.010 --> 01:33:30.820
<v Speaker 3>self help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I think for guys especially,</v>

1917
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:35.300
<v Speaker 3>but probably for everybody that we just</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to get over that shit,</v>

1918
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:40.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got gotta be okay and I don't know</v>

1919
01:33:40.370 --> 01:33:45.370
<v Speaker 3>because all of that self help spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 3>type stuff that's,</v>

1920
01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:51.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>made fun of and made fun of for good</v>

1921
01:33:51.141 --> 01:33:51.810
<v Speaker 3>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1922
01:33:51.810 --> 01:33:53.810
<v Speaker 3>but there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some things in there that,</v>

1923
01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:56.820
<v Speaker 3>that aren't all that right.</v>

1924
01:33:56.980 --> 01:34:00.430
<v Speaker 4>There's been just incredibly health</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yonis patellas calling us,</v>

1925
01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:07.780
<v Speaker 4>don't get no fuck you hang up on him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How's it going to,</v>

1926
01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:09.460
<v Speaker 4>I was going to talk to him and say</v>
<v Speaker 4>something silly,</v>

1927
01:34:09.461 --> 01:34:11.680
<v Speaker 4>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when a podcast,</v>

1928
01:34:11.681 --> 01:34:14.890
<v Speaker 4>Yani,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope you understand 60 miles outside</v>

1929
01:34:14.891 --> 01:34:16.300
<v Speaker 4>of Reno,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wherever the fuck we are.</v>

1930
01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:21.190
<v Speaker 4>We're headed to the metropolis of Reno,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nevada.</v>

1931
01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:25.120
<v Speaker 4>Andrew dice clay was here the day before</v>
<v Speaker 4>we left,</v>

1932
01:34:25.890 --> 01:34:28.000
<v Speaker 4>but the show day we're leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1933
01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:29.853
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1934
01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:32.230
<v Speaker 4>I was going to call them and say hi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop on it.</v>

1935
01:34:32.231 --> 01:34:35.560
<v Speaker 4>But we had to drive five hours to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>middle of nowhere.</v>

1936
01:34:36.850 --> 01:34:41.620
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so let's wrap this thing up was bring it</v>

1937
01:34:41.621 --> 01:34:45.940
<v Speaker 4>on back home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think your life experiences and</v>

1938
01:34:45.941 --> 01:34:47.890
<v Speaker 4>what you're trying to do is very</v>
<v Speaker 4>knowable dude.</v>

1939
01:34:47.891 --> 01:34:52.420
<v Speaker 4>And I think what you're trying to do and</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you have done is very exceptional.</v>

1940
01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:56.110
<v Speaker 4>And that's one of the reasons why I</v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to do this with you because this</v>

1941
01:34:56.111 --> 01:34:58.360
