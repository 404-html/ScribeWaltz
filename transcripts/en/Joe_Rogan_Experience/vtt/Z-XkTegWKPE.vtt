5
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.580
<v Speaker 2>It does feel pretty recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A year ago.</v>

6
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

7
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.750
<v Speaker 2>It's already October.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm scared.</v>

8
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.880
<v Speaker 2>Let's just fuck and spark up a joint </v>
<v Speaker 2>launch.</v>

9
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.410
<v Speaker 2>One of them backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

10
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.240
<v Speaker 2>One of these backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are so good.</v>

11
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.350
<v Speaker 2>Just smell it.</v>

12
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Just smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone was commenting on your blunt </v>

15
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:32.660
<v Speaker 2>rolling technique after the Elon Musk </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

16
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't roll them.</v>

17
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

18
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.830
<v Speaker 2>and I knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

19
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.490
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does he.</v>

20
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can barely roll a blunt.</v>

21
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:37.970
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the professional in the world.</v>

22
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 2>It's a pretty real good bond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't read.</v>

23
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smells good.</v>

24
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.470
<v Speaker 2>It smells so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They taste good too.</v>

25
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.820
<v Speaker 2>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are phenomenal.</v>

26
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 2>The I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a blunt man.</v>

27
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

28
00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:52.401
<v Speaker 2>It's probably bad for your lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something about the tobacco </v>

29
00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:56.331
<v Speaker 2>gets you a little high up and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana sort of like spreads you out </v>

30
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 2>and it puts you in like a new dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

31
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:00.810
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good one.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Halloween.</v>

<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

35
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.690
<v Speaker 2>Last year I did.</v>

36
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.720
<v Speaker 2>I did comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea what I was talking about </v>

37
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.720
<v Speaker 2>while I was on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

38
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.981
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this 400 people in this room know what </v>

39
00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:21.181
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always thought of bringing in all my </v>

40
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:21.181
<v Speaker 2>marijuana and booze in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

41
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 2>like why like it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in the old West when you have to </v>

42
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.860
<v Speaker 2>turn in your guns and just dumping them </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the table because I have so much </v>

43
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.610
<v Speaker 2>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>

44
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

49
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.780
<v Speaker 2>day back.</v>

<v Speaker 2>when he's high,</v>

54
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.520
<v Speaker 2>when he smokes weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then when he's not smoking weed,</v>

68
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.100
<v Speaker 2>The one thing about Arias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one thing that you could say </v>

69
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 2>after all the welding talking on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense.</v>

70
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.720
<v Speaker 2>Ari has rock solid ethics off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

71
00:02:41.721 --> 00:02:43.890
<v Speaker 2>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if Ari says going to do something,</v>

72
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.010
<v Speaker 2>he does it like so if I'm fucking with </v>
<v Speaker 2>him and saying I don't think you're </v>

73
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.140
<v Speaker 2>doing it like I don't really mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

74
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.850
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just kind of,</v>

75
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.900
<v Speaker 2>you're poking at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

76
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.740
<v Speaker 2>So if you're out there already and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear this molly fucking around,</v>

77
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 2>I know you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can talk to you for the next 30 days.</v>

78
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.960
<v Speaker 3>Dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He came back,</v>

79
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.070
<v Speaker 3>he came to our class for that last one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was so much easier than most clubs </v>

80
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.271
<v Speaker 3>can believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You questioned how hard my class one we </v>

81
00:03:12.271 --> 00:03:12.271
<v Speaker 3>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Encino.</v>

82
00:03:12.271 --> 00:03:12.271
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

83
00:03:12.271 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 3>this is so easy compared to what I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been doing in New York.</v>

84
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 3>Like it's all easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go easy,</v>

85
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's all how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>

86
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 3>If you do hot yoga and you go 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent every pose.</v>

87
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking hard to the matter who's </v>

88
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.930
<v Speaker 3>teaching?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

89
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.221
<v Speaker 3>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's this guy that I go to a </v>

90
00:03:29.221 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 3>hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a drinking problem,</v>

91
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:34.861
<v Speaker 3>legit drinking water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this guy that I go to yoga with </v>

92
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 3>a who is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>

93
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.350
<v Speaker 3>It seems like he just doesn't ever go </v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>

94
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.770
<v Speaker 3>He started just kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

95
00:03:43.771 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 3>you put your arms above your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He always does this.</v>

96
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.210
<v Speaker 3>He's never doing this research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fully stretched to extend his palms net </v>

97
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 3>connected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you do that,</v>

98
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:53.300
<v Speaker 3>it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

99
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 3>If you just kind of half ass every pose </v>
<v Speaker 3>and do this.</v>

100
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get through a 90 minute class.</v>

101
00:03:57.791 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 3>You're not doing the same thing as if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you do.</v>

102
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:04.441
<v Speaker 3>If you do any of you ever go to like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>group training class somewhere you can </v>

103
00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:07.760
<v Speaker 3>see people and there's like a 63 year </v>
<v Speaker 3>old lady who's doing a with.</v>

104
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 3>She's on her knees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>

105
00:04:09.971 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 3>this is hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and talking at a normal rate,</v>

106
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>

107
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.380
<v Speaker 3>You're not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

108
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 3>I got in trouble with my crossfit class </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was just getting pissed.</v>

109
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:21.250
<v Speaker 3>I was throwing up everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was throwing up every single day.</v>

110
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.040
<v Speaker 3>I was also drinking a coffee right </v>
<v Speaker 3>before it started,</v>

111
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.460
<v Speaker 3>so it's throwing up coffee every single </v>
<v Speaker 3>day and one day I just snapped.</v>

112
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.760
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

113
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 3>the black guy's not doing his burpees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The black guy.</v>

114
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 3>That's what they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

115
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:33.550
<v Speaker 3>That's what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't talk like that.</v>

116
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.610
<v Speaker 3>It's got a name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go in,</v>

117
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't know it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm pointing to him.</v>

118
00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:40.150
<v Speaker 3>He's not doing his burpees and then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the joke I made out of it was,</v>

119
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Wendell,</v>

120
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 3>the gay guy says I can't call you the </v>
<v Speaker 3>black guy but you're not doing.</v>

121
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:49.111
<v Speaker 3>You're throwing it back to a cross fit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the idea that we're doing this </v>

122
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.140
<v Speaker 3>in general heart rate sense because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can sprinkle it in.</v>

123
00:04:53.141 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 3>I want to go to a spin class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the way that is how,</v>

124
00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 3>if you want to like get a real bump in </v>
<v Speaker 3>those points,</v>

125
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 3>it's about a bumping heart like </v>
<v Speaker 3>sustained accelerated heart rate.</v>

126
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.500
<v Speaker 3>So a spin class is gonna get you a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch.</v>

127
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.680
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like Joe,</v>

128
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know that he's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a way better athlete than you,</v>

129
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:14.000
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't mean that we put pin in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

130
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.310
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean the month to find me </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he'll automatically beat us because</v>

131
00:05:19.781 --> 00:05:24.781
<v Speaker 3>he's in better physical condition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can actually beat them if you're </v>

132
00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:28.951
<v Speaker 3>going to push it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it in your brain that makes you </v>

133
00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:33.241
<v Speaker 3>do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because we just looked at your map and </v>

134
00:05:33.241 --> 00:05:33.820
<v Speaker 3>you burned a thousand calories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there some sort of.</v>

135
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.910
<v Speaker 3>I talked to Pat McAfee one time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said it's about exclusivity.</v>

136
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.320
<v Speaker 3>It's about rape and murder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My head's filled with it.</v>

137
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 3>Stopping rapists and stop and murderers </v>
<v Speaker 3>and killing child molesters.</v>

138
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:50.791
<v Speaker 3>That's where.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about killing bad people when you </v>

139
00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:50.791
<v Speaker 3>work out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I do.</v>

140
00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:51.370
<v Speaker 3>When I get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get tired.</v>

141
00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:53.590
<v Speaker 3>I think about like saving someone I care</v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

142
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.160
<v Speaker 3>I think about stopping someone is trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to murder someone I love.</v>

143
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think</v>

144
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.250
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love your face.</v>

145
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think about my second wife.</v>

146
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.910
<v Speaker 4>I think about protecting people I care </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

147
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.910
<v Speaker 4>Can you tell me one time you'll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's hard,</v>

148
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:13.340
<v Speaker 4>you'll go a pretending someone is trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to kill me.</v>

149
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

150
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.470
<v Speaker 4>So you're like pretending.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

151
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.220
<v Speaker 4>I really don't have words for that.</v>

152
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.530
<v Speaker 1>That's what you gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's,</v>

153
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 1>that's what if you think about worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>case scenario,</v>

154
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.320
<v Speaker 1>you're tired and someone's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill someone you care about and you </v>

155
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.450
<v Speaker 1>don't have enough energy to stop them.</v>

156
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.960
<v Speaker 4>But do you think you learned that switch</v>
<v Speaker 4>in?</v>

157
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.940
<v Speaker 4>Like a type one is not talking window a </v>
<v Speaker 4>crow a learned from martial arts?</v>

158
00:06:36.941 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

159
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:38.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure,</v>

160
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:39.260
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

161
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:41.600
<v Speaker 1>because that's the scariest place you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could ever be.</v>

162
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Like the scariest place that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be is life and death.</v>

163
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.400
<v Speaker 1>So like just putting yourself in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

164
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.800
<v Speaker 1>just want to lose weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

165
00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:50.000
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

166
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.610
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not.</v>

167
00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to save yourself like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you got.</v>

168
00:06:54.801 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 1>You got to put yourself in like </v>
<v Speaker 1>animalistic fury.</v>

169
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Speaker 1>That's how you gotta you gotta put </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

170
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.360
<v Speaker 1>you gotta to put yourself in this state </v>
<v Speaker 1>of just 100 percent effort.</v>

171
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.910
<v Speaker 1>I was pegged at 180 177 beats per minute</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the last 35,</v>

172
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.680
<v Speaker 1>35 minutes.</v>

173
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.240
<v Speaker 4>That's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's got to do it.</v>

174
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:20.040
<v Speaker 4>See that David Goggins guy had gotten my</v>
<v Speaker 4>head with a.</v>

175
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.350
<v Speaker 4>just embrace the suck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

176
00:07:22.351 --> 00:07:27.351
<v Speaker 4>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can get there where I go and just </v>

177
00:07:27.351 --> 00:07:27.351
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like during the marathon I just go,</v>

178
00:07:27.351 --> 00:07:28.260
<v Speaker 4>this is where I'm going to be for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>next five and a half hours.</v>

179
00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.150
<v Speaker 4>This is where I'm at and is what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing and I can,</v>

180
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:35.180
<v Speaker 4>I can wrap my head around that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I can wrap my head </v>

181
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.941
<v Speaker 4>around like I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the explosive activity of it and going </v>

182
00:07:37.941 --> 00:07:40.761
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to save my family and then </v>

183
00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:40.761
<v Speaker 4>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that might not work for you,</v>

184
00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:41.370
<v Speaker 4>but there still could be a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>tactic that works for you.</v>

185
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.660
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even like bat going that fucking hard to</v>

186
00:07:46.861 --> 00:07:49.140
<v Speaker 4>where your body is completely giving </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

187
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:50.840
<v Speaker 4>There's part of me that goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

188
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:51.780
<v Speaker 4>what are we doing here?</v>

189
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.400
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when I'm working out,</v>

190
00:07:53.401 --> 00:07:55.140
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really fucking hard.</v>

191
00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:00.290
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you definitely have to protect your </v>

192
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:00.290
<v Speaker 4>health,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

193
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:00.960
<v Speaker 4>Like the last you want to be doing this </v>
<v Speaker 4>and having a heart attack.</v>

194
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.730
<v Speaker 4>That's my.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's always my fear is I go,</v>

195
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.450
<v Speaker 4>easy buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Easy buddy is a good way to look at it,</v>

196
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.170
<v Speaker 4>but I've been doing that kind of working</v>
<v Speaker 4>out forever.</v>

197
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.000
<v Speaker 4>That's how it worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

198
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.440
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go crazy.</v>

200
00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:22.010
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever thought about someone who </v>
<v Speaker 4>like really disrespected you right </v>

201
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:22.010
<v Speaker 4>before you lift?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

202
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:26.970
<v Speaker 4>Like that's all that happens online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't read that Shit because I've </v>

203
00:08:28.891 --> 00:08:31.740
<v Speaker 4>gone to like a moment where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I would have cracked that dude in</v>

204
00:08:31.741 --> 00:08:33.930
<v Speaker 4>the face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then right before,</v>

205
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.620
<v Speaker 4>right before I said no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have not,</v>

206
00:08:35.621 --> 00:08:37.620
<v Speaker 4>and I know I'm definitely know what I </v>
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>

207
00:08:37.621 --> 00:08:39.360
<v Speaker 4>I know who I'm thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try it.</v>

208
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:40.290
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't say any names.</v>

209
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.620
<v Speaker 4>What does he rhyme with in order to like</v>
<v Speaker 4>egg</v>

210
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.810
<v Speaker 1>to really get yourself into that place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

211
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:54.250
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to think about something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's terrifying and negative,</v>

212
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>but to me that's like,</v>

213
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.390
<v Speaker 4>that's the ultimate position that where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to need energy.</v>

214
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.470
<v Speaker 4>This is so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That one.</v>

215
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.980
<v Speaker 4>The best shape I've ever been in is when</v>
<v Speaker 4>I met my wife.</v>

216
00:09:04.981 --> 00:09:09.981
<v Speaker 4>I was 186 pounds.</v>

235
00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:02.390
<v Speaker 4>as much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that make sense?</v>

236
00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I did the best I could do for sure 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>

289
00:12:09.431 --> 00:12:11.890
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't have done any better because </v>
<v Speaker 2>if I did any more.</v>

290
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.920
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that you could say is </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a little more time like maybe a </v>

291
00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.400
<v Speaker 2>month or two more time on some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bits like,</v>

292
00:12:18.401 --> 00:12:20.400
<v Speaker 2>but you never know when that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

293
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.360
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

294
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:27.600
<v Speaker 2>there's a sort of like a period where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're developing and then they mature </v>

295
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.891
<v Speaker 2>and then they're solid and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>never know like are they done or zero </v>

296
00:12:31.891 --> 00:12:35.240
<v Speaker 2>like one more tagline that I'm missing </v>
<v Speaker 2>here because you know how like it's </v>

297
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.820
<v Speaker 2>always the case you film and then right </v>
<v Speaker 2>after you're done you have a brand new </v>

298
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:38.820
<v Speaker 2>tagline that makes the bit.</v>

299
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like the next Saturday that mother </v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucker,</v>

300
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.770
<v Speaker 2>but next week I wrote that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did that special the next week I'm in,</v>

301
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.020

303
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:57.180

<v Speaker 2>Like I talked to women in whatever the </v>

304
00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.301
<v Speaker 2>bid is and the next week I write the bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>we set a fleshlight attachment for </v>

<v Speaker 2>Where the fuck was that?</v>

307
00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.570
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mind doesn't open up.</v>

308
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Your mind isn't open up all the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>until it's like,</v>

309
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:12.060
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have any pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pressure's gone and then you're </v>

310
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:12.060
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

311
00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:12.940
<v Speaker 2>I can take it here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can take it there.</v>

312
00:13:12.941 --> 00:13:17.941
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could think like this before I </v>

313
00:13:17.941 --> 00:13:17.941
<v Speaker 2>record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can't.</v>

314
00:13:17.941 --> 00:13:21.520
<v Speaker 2>You know what's interesting is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about this the after the </v>

315
00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.051
<v Speaker 2>specials over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't have any material and I </v>

316
00:13:25.051 --> 00:13:25.051
<v Speaker 2>don't have anything to think about.</v>

317
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.190
<v Speaker 2>But you always find it like overtime and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then before you know,</v>

318
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:29.620
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

319
00:13:29.621 --> 00:13:30.810
<v Speaker 2>I got to do our.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

320
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:36.150
<v Speaker 2>it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happens and it happens quicker the </v>

321
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.150
<v Speaker 2>more you've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

322
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you know you can do it.</v>

323
00:13:36.461 --> 00:13:38.650
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the sad things about these</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

324
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.210
<v Speaker 2>Like I was talking to a guy the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

325
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.610
<v Speaker 2>like how long you been doing comedy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like seven years.</v>

326
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:43.530
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much time do you have?</v>

327
00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:44.270
<v Speaker 2>He's like 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

328
00:13:44.271 --> 00:13:46.900
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking ruthlessly unacceptable.</v>

329
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.980
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

330
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.010
<v Speaker 2>you are lazy when you've been doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy for seven years,</v>

331
00:13:51.011 --> 00:13:53.680
<v Speaker 2>you have 20 minutes and out of those 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes 10 you should throw away.</v>

332
00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.150
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

333
00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:57.430
<v Speaker 2>But that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're not doing it enough.</v>

334
00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.490
<v Speaker 2>You're not doing it enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't get enough sets in this,</v>

335
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>

336
00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.540
<v Speaker 2>You do an open mics and when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing open mics,</v>

337
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.600
<v Speaker 2>everyone's sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you look like a hero if you have </v>

338
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.031
<v Speaker 2>anything that's remotely humorous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you try that remotely humorous </v>

339
00:14:12.031 --> 00:14:13.790
<v Speaker 2>stuff and you do it on at the Ice House </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people like,</v>

340
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:15.940
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go on.</v>

341
00:14:15.941 --> 00:14:18.590
<v Speaker 2>Between you and you and you know you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this bullshit.</v>

342
00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:21.650
<v Speaker 2>They're used to doing an open mic night </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people just not having it.</v>

343
00:14:21.651 --> 00:14:24.730
<v Speaker 2>So a real sets are so different than if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

344
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.430
<v Speaker 2>if you don't get in front of real crowds</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not,</v>

345
00:14:27.431 --> 00:14:29.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not entirely up to you.</v>

346
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.940
<v Speaker 2>Obviously when you're starting out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to get.</v>

347
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.810
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

348
00:14:31.811 --> 00:14:33.550
<v Speaker 2>Real crowds?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a real show.</v>

349
00:14:33.551 --> 00:14:34.620
<v Speaker 2>A professional.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

351
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.200
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's invaluable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even if you give somebody an </v>

352
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:44.500
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to come on your show for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

353
00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:46.150
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an up and comer,</v>

354
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.480
<v Speaker 2>because they don't normally have real </v>
<v Speaker 2>audiences perform in front of giant for </v>

355
00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:52.940
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a wake up call.</v>

356
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they're like,</v>

357
00:14:53.871 --> 00:14:55.310
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a real show.</v>

358
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:57.770
<v Speaker 2>People have expectations and they pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

359
00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.870
<v Speaker 2>When you go to one of those open mic </v>
<v Speaker 2>nights,</v>

360
00:14:59.871 --> 00:15:02.240
<v Speaker 2>people are just drunk and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>

361
00:15:02.241 --> 00:15:06.860
<v Speaker 2>So you're just laughing at basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything you can kill,</v>

362
00:15:06.861 --> 00:15:07.880
<v Speaker 2>but how bad they are.</v>

363
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.550
<v Speaker 2>People are just like slamming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made almost career out of that.</v>

364
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter Chen,</v>

365
00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.640
<v Speaker 2>who was a guy who is so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

366
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Chris Mcguire was auditioning for Mitzi </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Peter.</v>

367
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.350
<v Speaker 2>Mitzi thought it was funny because Mitzi</v>
<v Speaker 2>was so hilarious.</v>

368
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:32.650
<v Speaker 2>She thought it was funny that one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>worst comics in La don't pull his </v>

369
00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:37.100
<v Speaker 2>picture up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was hosting the open mic night.</v>

370
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:38.300
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

371
00:15:38.301 --> 00:15:43.301
<v Speaker 2>She thought it was funny and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I knew that mcguire was going to </v>

372
00:15:43.301 --> 00:15:43.580
<v Speaker 2>have to audition for Mitzi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I said fuck that.</v>

373
00:15:43.581 --> 00:15:44.540
<v Speaker 2>So I called up the store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

374
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:45.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm hosting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

375
00:15:45.831 --> 00:15:49.100
<v Speaker 2>I'll host the open Mike Nights Jenelle </v>
<v Speaker 2>styles to the open mic night,</v>

376
00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:52.220
<v Speaker 2>just just to keep him from hosting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

377
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.470
<v Speaker 2>So you did that like as a save for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>buddy?</v>

378
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:55.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

379
00:15:55.220 --> 00:16:00.220
<v Speaker 2>because I knew he was gonna you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this would be too much to address and </v>

380
00:16:00.681 --> 00:16:03.440
<v Speaker 2>you have three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be too much.</v>

381
00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:04.910
<v Speaker 2>Too much chaos to address.</v>

382
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
<v Speaker 5>I hosted a show as a favor one time and </v>
<v Speaker 5>ended up snapping on a lady in the </v>

383
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.120
<v Speaker 5>yachting and ruined the show and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were like,</v>

384
00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.080
<v Speaker 5>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why did you a dude?</v>

385
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:19.150
<v Speaker 5>Because I arrived,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a showcase for Montreal and I </v>

386
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.150
<v Speaker 5>arrived at the show before it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

387
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.410
<v Speaker 5>So there's like a 7:00</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing and then the 9:00</v>

<v Speaker 2>it was such a train wreck.</v>

443
00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:01.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people just think that if you're </v>

444
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.091
<v Speaker 2>saying something they disagree with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't think that they need to just </v>

445
00:19:03.091 --> 00:19:06.291
<v Speaker 2>like wait it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think they can stop you in the </v>

446
00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:06.291
<v Speaker 2>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me in particular,</v>

447
00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:11.100
<v Speaker 2>a lot of my bits start off one way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they look like they're going to be </v>

448
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.090
<v Speaker 2>way more outrageous than they are and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I turn them around.</v>

449
00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:18.150
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I'm starting it off and then </v>

450
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.150
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just attack,</v>

451
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:19.760
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're fucking up the bit,</v>

452
00:19:19.761 --> 00:19:24.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even understand what I'm </v>

453
00:19:24.761 --> 00:19:24.761
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

454
00:19:24.761 --> 00:19:24.761
<v Speaker 4>It's the whole thing about freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 4>speech in a weird way.</v>

455
00:19:24.761 --> 00:19:27.290
<v Speaker 4>I had a joke about pedophilia and I just</v>
<v Speaker 4>started it.</v>

456
00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:32.740
<v Speaker 4>And the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this woman who was a fan of mine and </v>

457
00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:32.740
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she just goes,</v>

458
00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.741
<v Speaker 4>no stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then now it looks like I'm probing </v>

459
00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:39.130
<v Speaker 4>Ophelia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't gotten to the fucking </v>

460
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:40.720
<v Speaker 4>punchline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just looks like I'm in the fucking kids </v>

461
00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:40.720
<v Speaker 4>because they will a lot to finish it.</v>

462
00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.830
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those people shouldn't be allowed at </v>

463
00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:46.731
<v Speaker 5>shows because they're not even letting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not even letting the art form </v>

464
00:19:46.731 --> 00:19:47.910
<v Speaker 5>take place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't.</v>

465
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.460
<v Speaker 5>You crafted something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't let it play out.</v>

466
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:51.300
<v Speaker 5>You can't do that.</v>

467
00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:53.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they should just kick you out.</v>

468
00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:58.370
<v Speaker 2>You just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking up the whole experience </v>

469
00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:00.801
<v Speaker 2>for the whole crowd because like a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Brian holtzman would literally </v>

470
00:20:00.801 --> 00:20:02.400
<v Speaker 2>never be able to perform if the audience</v>
<v Speaker 2>is filled with people like that.</v>

471
00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:04.560
<v Speaker 2>So people like you and I who enjoyed </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

472
00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:09.860
<v Speaker 2>we would never be able to see him </v>
<v Speaker 2>because his whole act is saying </v>

473
00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:11.850
<v Speaker 2>outrageous shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That absolutely he doesn't really mean.</v>

474
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the funny thing is the twists and </v>

475
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:16.880
<v Speaker 2>the turns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

476
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.030
<v Speaker 2>And you to laugh at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other funny thing is,</v>

477
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.740
<v Speaker 2>is that he supposed to act like he does </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean it.</v>

478
00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.010
<v Speaker 2>That's what's fun like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are like,</v>

479
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.220
<v Speaker 2>always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

480
00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:31.490
<v Speaker 2>they get super upset about this thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like he said this and they're </v>

481
00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:31.490
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

482
00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:31.490
<v Speaker 2>but don't you get that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

483
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:36.590
<v Speaker 2>it's the performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to have this joke about the </v>

484
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.590
<v Speaker 2>second coming project.</v>

485
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.900
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what the second coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>project is?</v>

486
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:42.590
<v Speaker 2>When they first started fucking around </v>
<v Speaker 2>with genes and cloning,</v>

487
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:48.410
<v Speaker 2>they um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a group of radical Christians </v>

488
00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:49.170
<v Speaker 2>that had this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it might've,</v>

489
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:54.630
<v Speaker 2>it might've been bullshit eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what their idea was they were going </v>

490
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:58.621
<v Speaker 2>to take some genetic material from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shroud of Turin and they were going to </v>

491
00:20:58.621 --> 00:21:01.180
<v Speaker 2>clone Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so my bit was,</v>

492
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.650
<v Speaker 2>what if you clone Jesus and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>come out good.</v>

493
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:06.910
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

494
00:21:06.911 --> 00:21:11.020
<v Speaker 2>they had to do Dolly the sheep like 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>times until they got it right.</v>

495
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.630
<v Speaker 2>Like what if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if you would,</v>

496
00:21:13.631 --> 00:21:18.631
<v Speaker 2>if you cloned Jesus and he comes back </v>
<v Speaker 2>handicapped and I had this whole fucked </v>

497
00:21:18.641 --> 00:21:22.330
<v Speaker 2>up thing about them following around </v>
<v Speaker 2>this handicap Jesus.</v>

498
00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Instead of turning water into wine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns like dog shit into the cookies.</v>

499
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:31.980
<v Speaker 2>And so this fucking lady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this lady goes next subject and she's </v>

500
00:21:34.241 --> 00:21:34.960
<v Speaker 2>sitting in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

501
00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:35.830
<v Speaker 2>in the front row.</v>

502
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:41.040
<v Speaker 2>So I did the bit to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked her in the eyes and I kept </v>

503
00:21:41.861 --> 00:21:43.480
<v Speaker 2>doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

504
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:48.130
<v Speaker 2>by the power of Christ compel you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it was a horrible pit,</v>

505
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:53.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like we're talking like 1998 or </v>

506
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:53.160
<v Speaker 2>some shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

507
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.810
<v Speaker 2>So it was clunky anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

508
00:21:55.930 --> 00:22:00.000
<v Speaker 2>she's literally saying next subject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

509
00:22:00.001 --> 00:22:02.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm never gonna Never gonna listen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

510
00:22:02.111 --> 00:22:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like when you tell someone,</v>

511
00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:06.400
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would they shut the fuck up?</v>

512
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:08.970
<v Speaker 2>Nobody that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>

513
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.380
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want them to shut the fuck up.</v>

514
00:22:11.381 --> 00:22:16.381
<v Speaker 2>But you have no understanding of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>power of persuasion or the fact that </v>

515
00:22:16.381 --> 00:22:20.850
<v Speaker 2>other people aren't you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not in control of other </v>

516
00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:20.850
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you tell someone,</v>

517
00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:21.970
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

518
00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:27.330
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just a poor way of you </v>

519
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.091
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand human beings like </v>

520
00:22:30.091 --> 00:22:30.091
<v Speaker 2>you haven't thought this through.</v>

521
00:22:30.091 --> 00:22:31.000
<v Speaker 2>You just know what you want your selfish</v>
<v Speaker 2>little head.</v>

522
00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:36.150
<v Speaker 2>And so you say it to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how most arguments in most </v>

523
00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:39.091
<v Speaker 2>fights get started because people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>take into consideration at all the fact </v>

524
00:22:39.091 --> 00:22:43.471
<v Speaker 2>that they're communicating with another </v>
<v Speaker 2>human being has their own set of </v>

525
00:22:43.471 --> 00:22:43.471
<v Speaker 2>emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own life,</v>

526
00:22:43.471 --> 00:22:44.620
<v Speaker 2>their own problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own ego.</v>

527
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.280
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a sure fire away any comedy show</v>

528
00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:51.730
<v Speaker 2>to hear more of the same topic because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd be like,</v>

529
00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.650
<v Speaker 2>next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next subject.</v>

530
00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>

531
00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:01.380
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost sometimes I preface it where I </v>

532
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:01.380
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

533
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:06.301
<v Speaker 2>you got like if you don't like what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>about to say because I have a couple of </v>

534
00:23:06.301 --> 00:23:08.350
<v Speaker 2>things now that are a little too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could just talk to me after the show.</v>

535
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:09.640
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't even do that.</v>

536
00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:14.670
<v Speaker 2>Just don't interrupt things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got 500 people change my mind on </v>

537
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:14.670
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

538
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Like I had a bit that worked on the buy </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast very well.</v>

539
00:23:16.811 --> 00:23:19.270
<v Speaker 2>And then I've tried it in the club and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this black chick came up to me and she's</v>

540
00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:24.271
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a really fucked up joke that was </v>

541
00:23:24.271 --> 00:23:24.271
<v Speaker 2>like really super racist or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it super,</v>

542
00:23:24.271 --> 00:23:26.830
<v Speaker 2>super racist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the black guy at crossfit racist or</v>

543
00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.320
<v Speaker 2>I think it might've been worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

544
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

545
00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.940
<v Speaker 2>It didn't bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by the black chick in DC was like,</v>

546
00:23:33.941 --> 00:23:38.941
<v Speaker 2>I love the show all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think this is a year ago and I </v>

547
00:23:39.161 --> 00:23:40.610
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a part of me is like a.</v>

548
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:42.270
<v Speaker 2>is it a bit that's in the special then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

549
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.700
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

550
00:23:42.701 --> 00:23:42.970
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

551
00:23:42.971 --> 00:23:44.080
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

552
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.110
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

553
00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.890
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like it's all,</v>

554
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:53.110
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like I didn't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to tell it but I could figure </v>

555
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.990
<v Speaker 4>it out to work it out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't wanna have to deal with all</v>

556
00:23:53.991 --> 00:23:55.910
<v Speaker 4>the fucking steps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the steps.</v>

557
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.720
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

558
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to die on the hill right </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I don't,</v>

559
00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't really talk about race much in </v>
<v Speaker 4>my act.</v>

560
00:24:01.101 --> 00:24:02.190
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really,</v>

561
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to die on that hill for </v>
<v Speaker 4>that bit to do with a bit like that.</v>

562
00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:09.920
<v Speaker 4>You gotta look at it as if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone trying to deconstruct it.</v>

563
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:12.410
<v Speaker 4>Like you're someone who's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>attack that bit.</v>

564
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:17.800
<v Speaker 4>See for me a bit works best the very </v>
<v Speaker 4>first time I do it and then and then </v>

565
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.640
<v Speaker 4>every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every,</v>

566
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:23.710
<v Speaker 4>every work in bid I do around that to </v>
<v Speaker 4>like take it apart and figure out </v>

567
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:23.750
<v Speaker 4>another way to approach it.</v>

568
00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:27.620
<v Speaker 4>That's where I start fucking it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the first time I say it I go,</v>

569
00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:29.480
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's hope we can find that again.</v>

570
00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.030
<v Speaker 4>That's I'm the polar opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

571
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:34.730
<v Speaker 4>Occasionally I'll say something good the</v>
<v Speaker 4>first time,</v>

572
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.880
<v Speaker 4>but most of the time when I say </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that seems like a sprout or a </v>

573
00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.100
<v Speaker 4>seed and then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

574
00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.760
<v Speaker 4>but how much time do you spend listening</v>
<v Speaker 4>to recordings?</v>

575
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.040
<v Speaker 4>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot.</v>

576
00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:50.050
<v Speaker 4>Now I look back to that last special.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did it obsessive Lee and then I got </v>

577
00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:53.861
<v Speaker 4>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got into recording and now what I do </v>

578

<v Speaker 4>The Hannibal,</v>

610
00:26:04.601 --> 00:26:07.340
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to run it by him first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I got real clean audio of it.</v>

611
00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:12.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you are doing it through the </v>

612
00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:12.820
<v Speaker 4>soundboard?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

613
00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.911
<v Speaker 4>I do it through the h four slash six is </v>
<v Speaker 4>like the best and I have a basically a </v>

614
00:26:15.911 --> 00:26:17.910
<v Speaker 4>surround sound mic on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which ones are called the gun?</v>

615
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.950
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>H four slash six.</v>

616
00:26:18.951 --> 00:26:22.040
<v Speaker 4>It's bigger than a zoom h four slash </v>
<v Speaker 4>six.</v>

617
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:27.400
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Am I right on that or is it just the </v>

618
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:27.400
<v Speaker 4>eight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Six?</v>

619
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:27.400
<v Speaker 4>I would say the h six.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a six.</v>

620
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:27.400
<v Speaker 4>Eight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six.</v>

621
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.910
<v Speaker 4>The other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the h four n zoom,</v>

622
00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.060
<v Speaker 4>zoom h six o them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

623
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.530
<v Speaker 4>Audio recorder and it was big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that thing?</v>

624
00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.200
<v Speaker 4>It's about the size of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's about the size of this box,</v>

625
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.640
<v Speaker 4>but they make a zoo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks like.</v>

626
00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:43.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They make a zoom that's smaller that I </v>

627
00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:43.840
<v Speaker 4>take with me now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That fits in my pocket,</v>

628
00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.480
<v Speaker 4>like the size of a lighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's really great.</v>

629
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pull that up.</v>

630
00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:51.450
<v Speaker 2>Let me see what that looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I like about doing it on my phone </v>

631
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:54.530
<v Speaker 2>though is that I have them always with </v>
<v Speaker 2>me all the time and then I sync it up in</v>

632
00:26:54.531 --> 00:26:59.531
<v Speaker 2>my car on the way to the Gig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I did the other night to </v>

633
00:26:59.531 --> 00:27:02.650
<v Speaker 2>listen on the way there on the way out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go like that because I liked the.</v>

634
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:07.430
<v Speaker 2>I liked the puzzle solving aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting together sets.</v>

635
00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.590
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you go like a man,</v>

636
00:27:09.591 --> 00:27:12.530
<v Speaker 2>like why does this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I do it fourth it kills,</v>

637
00:27:12.531 --> 00:27:14.300
<v Speaker 2>but if I do it fifth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's garbage.</v>

638
00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you try to like figure it out.</v>

639
00:27:16.791 --> 00:27:19.010
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe this needs to be punched up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they should move here.</v>

640
00:27:19.011 --> 00:27:21.050
<v Speaker 2>I liked doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like figuring that out.</v>

641
00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's always those mystery </v>

642
00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:26.080
<v Speaker 2>punchlines that you didn't think were </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be a punchline and crushes.</v>

643
00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:26.120
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

644
00:27:26.121 --> 00:27:28.010
<v Speaker 2>like what the fuck is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you laughing at?</v>

645
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:29.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what happened there</v>

646
00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:34.650
<v Speaker 4>due to the time that you guys were in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the back of the room and I said I used </v>

647
00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:37.030
<v Speaker 4>to think and Helen Keller the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>person and I didn't think that was funny</v>

648
00:27:37.031 --> 00:27:42.031
<v Speaker 4>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're like please don't do that a </v>

649
00:27:42.031 --> 00:27:42.031
<v Speaker 4>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

650
00:27:42.031 --> 00:27:42.031
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was at a stand up on the spot,</v>

651
00:27:42.031 --> 00:27:45.610
<v Speaker 4>on the spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I send them all the spots of the most </v>

652
00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:45.610
<v Speaker 4>useful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

653
00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:45.610
<v Speaker 4>Super.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

654
00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:45.970
<v Speaker 4>So which one is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got the h six.</v>

655
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
<v Speaker 4>I've got the H,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four n and then the h one n is the one </v>

656
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:51.850
<v Speaker 4>that got that take with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The h six is the larger one.</v>

657
00:27:51.851 --> 00:27:56.851
<v Speaker 4>That's like a Taser looking thing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then which is the one you take with you </v>

658
00:27:56.851 --> 00:27:56.851
<v Speaker 4>the one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's really little.</v>

659
00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:59.680
<v Speaker 4>What's the comparison in the sound </v>
<v Speaker 4>between the h one,</v>

660
00:27:59.681 --> 00:28:03.370
<v Speaker 4>N and h six.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A big jump in my opinion.</v>

661
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:04.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

662
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Jamie should be the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>

663
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.180
<v Speaker 2>So?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

664
00:28:08.181 --> 00:28:09.210
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be,</v>

665
00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.570
<v Speaker 2>it should be the same microphones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

666
00:28:11.571 --> 00:28:13.610
<v Speaker 2>the age six is just going to lie to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>six tracks.</v>

667
00:28:13.611 --> 00:28:18.611
<v Speaker 2>That's what the six is logistics inputs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was probably just one track or </v>

668
00:28:18.611 --> 00:28:19.550
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's too specific for this left </v>
<v Speaker 2>and right.</v>

669
00:28:19.551 --> 00:28:20.630
<v Speaker 2>That's why there's two microphones.</v>

670
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.540
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

671
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:23.600
<v Speaker 4>That was a great mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I take that with me and you,</v>

672
00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:26.640
<v Speaker 4>it shows you how much time you have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You put a 64 gigabyte,</v>

673
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:31.590
<v Speaker 4>a mini SD card in and you get like 118 </v>
<v Speaker 4>hours of recording.</v>

674
00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.390
<v Speaker 4>How's the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you do,</v>

675
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:35.790
<v Speaker 4>I go through batteries pretty quick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you use lithium batteries,</v>

676
00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:38.010
<v Speaker 4>it's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you do mini</v>

677
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:40.740
<v Speaker 2>sd card,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could take that mini SD card and put</v>

678
00:28:40.741 --> 00:28:45.120
<v Speaker 2>it if you have a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just got an android phone,</v>

679
00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:49.590
<v Speaker 2>I got this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a galaxy note nine and it has a,</v>

680
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:52.610
<v Speaker 2>it takes up to one terabyte of storage </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

681
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:56.040
<v Speaker 2>Look at the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that new?</v>

682
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:58.040
<v Speaker 2>But it takes an SD card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

683
00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes an SD card.</v>

684
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.760
<v Speaker 2>It takes up to one terabyte of storage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

685
00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.240
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just phenomenal.</v>

686
00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:10.950
<v Speaker 2>They used to be that they were like way </v>
<v Speaker 2>inferior to iphones.</v>

687
00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:12.720
<v Speaker 2>It's not the case anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

688
00:29:12.721 --> 00:29:14.670
<v Speaker 2>I think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look how big that screen is.</v>

689
00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:16.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

690
00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:17.160
<v Speaker 2>Cup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ready?</v>

691
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.710
<v Speaker 2>Ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who makes that a Samsung?</v>

692
00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.940
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

694
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:28.370
<v Speaker 2>instant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it as a pen we could write on the </v>

695
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:31.140
<v Speaker 2>lock screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on the lock screen you can take notes</v>

696
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:36.260
<v Speaker 2>and write on the screen.</v>

700
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:51.990
<v Speaker 2>that's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then this also works as a remote </v>

701
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:51.990
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're playing music,</v>

00:30:06.921 --> 00:30:09.980
<v Speaker 2>that Jamie was telling me is that you </v>

715
00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.870

716
00:30:23.871 --> 00:30:27.680
<v Speaker 2>business line or you disabled the </v>

885
00:36:51.301 --> 00:36:52.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a stickler for details.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

886
00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:55.110
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cons,</v>

887
00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:58.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rain was a long time.</v>

888
00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

889
00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:05.090
<v Speaker 4>during [inaudible] lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they estimated that he killed in his </v>

890
00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:05.790
<v Speaker 4>people killed 10 percent of the world's </v>
<v Speaker 4>population.</v>

891
00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:10.820
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they killed so many people that change </v>

892
00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:12.891
<v Speaker 4>the carbon footprint of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They literally change how many people </v>

893
00:37:12.891 --> 00:37:16.701
<v Speaker 4>were burning things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They literally changed it in core </v>

894
00:37:16.701 --> 00:37:20.571
<v Speaker 4>samples.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you do a core sample on the </v>

895
00:37:20.571 --> 00:37:22.611
<v Speaker 4>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the carbon footprint of human beings is </v>

896
00:37:22.611 --> 00:37:25.401
<v Speaker 4>less while he was alive because he </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed one out of 10 human beings that </v>

897
00:37:25.401 --> 00:37:26.240
<v Speaker 4>lived.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he was eco.</v>

898
00:37:26.241 --> 00:37:28.340
<v Speaker 4>It was eco friendly for what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

899
00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:33.680
<v Speaker 4>It's very greasy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a weird thing that Dan Carlin </v>

900
00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:33.720
<v Speaker 4>goes over and his wrath of the con </v>
<v Speaker 4>series,</v>

901
00:37:33.721 --> 00:37:36.420
<v Speaker 4>which is like one of the greatest hits </v>
<v Speaker 4>history series of all time.</v>

902
00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.070
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't recommend it enough.</v>

903
00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:44.080
<v Speaker 4>I wish I could go back to the day I </v>
<v Speaker 4>found it and I was like seven part </v>

904
00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.300
<v Speaker 4>series or whatever and I'd play it </v>
<v Speaker 4>laying in bed,</v>

905
00:37:45.301 --> 00:37:50.301
<v Speaker 4>fall asleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wake up and have to go find out where I </v>

906
00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:50.301
<v Speaker 4>left off.</v>

907
00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:50.301

957
00:39:48.251 --> 00:39:50.800
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

958
00:39:50.801 --> 00:39:51.850
<v Speaker 3>I can't help them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to put those things up </v>

963
00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:02.820
<v Speaker 3>everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Motherfucker.</v>

964
00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.960
<v Speaker 3>You're going to see those images of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these workouts every day and I'm doing </v>

965
00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:04.960
<v Speaker 3>two a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to work.</v>

966
00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:05.800
<v Speaker 3>Do a day like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

967
00:40:05.801 --> 00:40:07.420
<v Speaker 3>Me Too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I already did mine today.</v>

968
00:40:07.421 --> 00:40:11.290
<v Speaker 3>I walked three miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do on that bullshit fucking</v>

969
00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.410
<v Speaker 3>treadmill that we were talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These stumps treadmill.</v>

970
00:40:14.411 --> 00:40:19.411
<v Speaker 3>You don't like that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just is not enjoyable because it's </v>

971
00:40:19.411 --> 00:40:19.411
<v Speaker 3>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard as weight.</v>

972
00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:24.420
<v Speaker 3>So that's the whole idea behind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's difficult to keep going for point </v>

973
00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:24.420
<v Speaker 3>total,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

974
00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:24.820
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the move,</v>

975
00:40:24.821 --> 00:40:25.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

976
00:40:25.391 --> 00:40:26.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was two,</v>

977
00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:31.260
<v Speaker 3>like what are the other things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The initial thought I had was like last </v>

978
00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:34.410
<v Speaker 3>year we had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was 15 slash 20 minute hot yoga </v>

979
00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:37.471
<v Speaker 3>classes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the idea was I'm going to do those </v>

980
00:40:37.471 --> 00:40:37.471
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

981
00:40:37.471 --> 00:40:40.270
<v Speaker 3>Well the idea for that was that it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult but attainable.</v>

982
00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:42.670
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you had to be disciplined to do it.</v>

983
00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:45.580
<v Speaker 3>So now you're going to do two workouts a</v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

984
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:46.900
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And 15 minutes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The Yoga is one.</v>

986
00:40:49.301 --> 00:40:49.960
<v Speaker 3>That's the one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

987
00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:51.110
<v Speaker 3>I'll work out today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

00:40:51.111 --> 00:40:55.360
<v Speaker 3>And then another hardcore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing the 15 hot yoga classes on top</v>

989
00:40:55.361 --> 00:40:58.300
<v Speaker 3>of all the other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this number?</v>

<v Speaker 3>The one that's your calories burned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

991
00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:04.180

<v Speaker 3>When you walked in,</v>

992

995
00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:12.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're doing an intense one.</v>

<v Speaker 6>when you get to look out over the entire</v>
<v Speaker 6>audience.</v>

<v Speaker 6>seem real and it just happened.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you,</v>

1084
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:16.900
<v Speaker 2>bird did the forum burdens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not 20,000,</v>

1085
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:19.380
<v Speaker 2>9,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Western Forum,</v>

1086
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:22.730
<v Speaker 2>the Great Western Forum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that it is the thing online</v>

1087
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:23.760
<v Speaker 2>that it was 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1088
00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:26.050
<v Speaker 2>They're wrong because Dean del Ray said </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was 9,000.</v>

1089
00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:28.380
<v Speaker 2>I think they just made a mistake but </v>
<v Speaker 2>huge.</v>

1090
00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:29.370
<v Speaker 2>Either way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's huge.</v>

1091
00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.020
<v Speaker 2>So I was thinking last night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you,</v>

1092
00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.750
<v Speaker 2>I know that you're not like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you're a little bit like this,</v>

1093
00:45:33.751 --> 00:45:36.300
<v Speaker 2>but to compare different times of </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy,</v>

1094
00:45:36.301 --> 00:45:37.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1095
00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:39.330
<v Speaker 2>and compare people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you don't like comparing people,</v>

1096
00:45:39.331 --> 00:45:44.331
<v Speaker 2>but has there ever been a time in comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>where this many acts were selling </v>

1097
00:45:44.331 --> 00:45:46.980
<v Speaker 2>arenas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This many acts were selling theaters and</v>

1098
00:45:46.981 --> 00:45:49.350

<v Speaker 2>which is way bigger than that.</v>

1101
00:45:53.461 --> 00:45:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Madison Square Garden I think is </v>
<v Speaker 2>$18,000.</v>

1102
00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:59.300
<v Speaker 2>How about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sebastian is ready to sell for car.</v>

1104
00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.880
<v Speaker 2>Square Garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just stop and think about that.</v>

1105
00:46:05.881 --> 00:46:08.430
<v Speaker 2>That's almost 80,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1106
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.290
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1107
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:15.930

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:30.540
<v Speaker 2>There's so many comics selling theaters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>theaters that I don't think there's ever</v>

1113
00:46:30.541 --> 00:46:31.620
<v Speaker 2>been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And then there's the big first of all </v>

1117
00:46:42.801 --> 00:46:42.801
<v Speaker 2>this Kevin Hart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the biggest of the big.</v>

1118
00:46:42.801 --> 00:46:46.911
<v Speaker 2>He sells out 50,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carol Williams is actually a lot bigger </v>

1119
00:46:46.911 --> 00:46:46.911
<v Speaker 2>than he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kat Williams.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm joking.</v>

1122
00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:55.330
<v Speaker 2>Didn't he got Williams?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just slamming potential.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I liked that.</v>

1124
00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:57.640

<v Speaker 2>I liked tattoos,</v>

1125
00:46:57.650 --> 00:47:00.300
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's eccentric at best.</v>

1126
00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:03.240
<v Speaker 2>Kevin is the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest.</v>

1127
00:47:03.241 --> 00:47:04.990
<v Speaker 2>It's the biggest monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's fit.</v>

1128
00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:07.730
<v Speaker 2>He can sell 50,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sold $50,000.</v>

1129
00:47:07.731 --> 00:47:09.560
<v Speaker 2>Philadelphia when he did a special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1130
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:11.660
<v Speaker 2>there's only one of him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1131
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:15.390
<v Speaker 2>it was real close to him that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>forget about is Larry the cable guy?</v>

1132
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:20.630
<v Speaker 2>Because Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cable guy was selling out football </v>

1133
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:22.701
<v Speaker 2>stadiums because Josh Wolfe was opening </v>
<v Speaker 2>for him and Josh Wolfe took a picture </v>

1134
00:47:22.701 --> 00:47:22.830
<v Speaker 2>and showed it to me and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1135
00:47:22.831 --> 00:47:25.380
<v Speaker 2>this was me onstage opening up for Larry</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cable guy.</v>

1136
00:47:25.381 --> 00:47:26.760
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1137
00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:28.440
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people don't think about.</v>

1138
00:47:28.441 --> 00:47:29.040
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Larry,</v>

1139
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:34.050
<v Speaker 2>the cable guy is the most humble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like plus he's doing that in like the </v>

1140
00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:37.951
<v Speaker 2>heartland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people will just dismiss it because </v>

1141
00:47:37.951 --> 00:47:38.770
<v Speaker 2>it's not like an la show or so.</v>

1142
00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Those two guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1143
00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:42.730
<v Speaker 2>I think Kevin Hart is Numero Uno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's number one.</v>

1144
00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:47.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's Chappelle could </v>

1145
00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:50.310
<v Speaker 2>basically do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sells out mass the forum,</v>

1146
00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.530
<v Speaker 2>not the form of the Hollywood bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A bowl.</v>

1147
00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:53.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1148
00:47:53.081 --> 00:47:54.840
<v Speaker 2>That's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that $20,000,</v>

1149
00:47:55.660 --> 00:48:00.660
<v Speaker 2>$20,000</v>

1151
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll probably be like,</v>

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:10.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do the belly room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he just goes and does that </v>

1155
00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:10.950
<v Speaker 2>because he likes it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He likes the intimate shows.</v>

1156
00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's also,</v>

1157
00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:15.310
<v Speaker 2>I hate to use a term like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a legitimate artist.</v>

1158
00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:20.170
<v Speaker 2>He's just trying to do better work to </v>
<v Speaker 2>better comedy and always evolve it.</v>

1159
00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:25.350
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the rare guys that could do </v>
<v Speaker 2>a special and then the next week 11 new </v>

1160
00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:25.350
<v Speaker 2>our.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1161
00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:26.020
<v Speaker 2>and somehow it comes out works.</v>

1162
00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:29.350
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's just supremely dedicated,</v>

1163
00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:30.210
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1164
00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:35.940
<v Speaker 2>So there's him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's Chris Rock can still sell out </v>

1165
00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:37.030
<v Speaker 2>pretty big places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If Louis came back,</v>

1166
00:48:37.031 --> 00:48:42.031
<v Speaker 2>I think he could sell out giant places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Giant burst sells out everywhere he </v>

1167
00:48:42.031 --> 00:48:44.620
<v Speaker 2>wants to burke and sell out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sold out Boston Garden,</v>

1168
00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:48.580
<v Speaker 2>which is 18,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>wells fargo center in Philly.</v>

1169
00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.530
<v Speaker 2>How big is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>15,000.</v>

1170
00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

1171
00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.520
<v Speaker 2>He could sell out all those places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to put in perspective,</v>

1172
00:48:54.521 --> 00:48:55.900
<v Speaker 2>and I think you guys can understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1173
00:48:55.901 --> 00:48:58.840
<v Speaker 2>but I mean you were selling out clubs </v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1174
00:48:58.841 --> 00:49:01.480
<v Speaker 2>like six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>17 years ago.</v>

1175
00:49:01.481 --> 00:49:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Were you just doing clubs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1176
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:05.170
<v Speaker 2>for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you were,</v>

1177
00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:08.530
<v Speaker 2>when you were selling them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were selling out just clubs,</v>

1178
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:13.800
<v Speaker 2>that's an achievement in this business </v>
<v Speaker 2>to sell out weekends and ad shows is a </v>

1179
00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.971
<v Speaker 2>login achievement that so undermined </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go in and use San Jose or you </v>

1180
00:49:17.971 --> 00:49:18.760
<v Speaker 2>do whatever.</v>

1181
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:21.910
<v Speaker 2>You sell out everything and then go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1182
00:49:21.911 --> 00:49:23.620
<v Speaker 2>like Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's,</v>

1183
00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:26.410
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the possibilities are endless.</v>

1184
00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the Internet.</v>

1185
00:49:28.810 --> 00:49:29.830
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it is.</v>

1186
00:49:29.831 --> 00:49:34.831
<v Speaker 2>It's people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's like this network of </v>

1187
00:49:34.831 --> 00:49:36.820
<v Speaker 2>comics now that everybody knows about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1188
00:49:36.821 --> 00:49:39.440
<v Speaker 2>if you know about bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know about Joey Diaz,</v>

1189
00:49:39.441 --> 00:49:40.480
<v Speaker 2>you know about you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1190
00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:45.550
<v Speaker 2>but there's this thing going on now </v>
<v Speaker 2>where everyone's sort of connected </v>

1191
00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:48.730
<v Speaker 2>that's never existed before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then a lot of these people,</v>

1192
00:49:48.731 --> 00:49:51.130
<v Speaker 2>not Sebastian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's one of the rare ones that doesn't.</v>

1193
00:49:51.131 --> 00:49:53.620
<v Speaker 2>But most of these people have podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Hart doesn't obviously,</v>

1194
00:49:53.621 --> 00:49:56.710
<v Speaker 2>but Kevin Hart has major movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sebastian actually does one.</v>

1195
00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:59.790
<v Speaker 2>He does a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know,</v>

1196
00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:04.830
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he can get to it like </v>

1197
00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:07.980
<v Speaker 2>weekly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they definitely considered serious </v>

1198
00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:07.980
<v Speaker 2>thinking to do it specifically for </v>
<v Speaker 2>serious.</v>

1199
00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Does it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whenever you can get to it.</v>

1200
00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:11.490
<v Speaker 2>Think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you've probably been,</v>

1201
00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:13.780
<v Speaker 2>you've been in this longest of the three</v>
<v Speaker 2>of us,</v>

1202
00:50:13.781 --> 00:50:18.220
<v Speaker 2>but have you ever known a time in comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>when comics were more friendly?</v>

1203
00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:20.500
<v Speaker 2>Like it seems like everyone's on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same team.</v>

1204
00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1205
00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:22.750
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a completely different thing.</v>

1206
00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:27.760
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because I really believe it's </v>

1207
00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:28.120
<v Speaker 2>because the internet and also because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's</v>

1208
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:29.070
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1209
00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:34.300
<v Speaker 1>things were fighting for anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like tonight show spots are stupid shit </v>

1210
00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:38.321
<v Speaker 1>like that or Sitcom auditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the past it was like there was </v>

1211
00:50:38.321 --> 00:50:42.101
<v Speaker 1>three channels and there was the tonight</v>
<v Speaker 1>show and the letterman show and </v>

1212
00:50:42.101 --> 00:50:42.710
<v Speaker 1>everybody wanted to host the tonight </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

1213
00:50:42.711 --> 00:50:47.711
<v Speaker 1>but Jay Leno was hosting it forever or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Carson before him and there was </v>

1214
00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:51.551
<v Speaker 1>this competition between comics when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were just cut throat and there's </v>

1215
00:50:51.551 --> 00:50:54.630
<v Speaker 1>not that anymore now instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like radio shows,</v>

1216
00:50:54.631 --> 00:50:59.631
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Radio shows always shit on the other </v>

1217
00:50:59.631 --> 00:51:02.261
<v Speaker 1>radio shows always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always saw other morning shows in </v>

1218
00:51:02.261 --> 00:51:02.261
<v Speaker 1>town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They shit on him.</v>

1219
00:51:02.261 --> 00:51:03.500
<v Speaker 1>It was all shitting on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody fucked them.</v>

1220
00:51:03.501 --> 00:51:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Like Howard stern was notorious for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1221
00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:08.450
<v Speaker 1>We do the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start wars for ratings.</v>

1222
00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we do the opposite.</v>

1223
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:15.400
<v Speaker 1>We all have successful podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we all have each other on our </v>

1224
00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.550
<v Speaker 1>podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all super friendly about it.</v>

1225
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:19.160
<v Speaker 1>We all promote each other's specials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all,</v>

1226
00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:24.400
<v Speaker 1>we all hang out together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a camaraderie amongst </v>

1227
00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.791
<v Speaker 1>comedians now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be like there might be some </v>

1228
00:51:27.791 --> 00:51:28.370
<v Speaker 1>comradery amongst a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would always go bad.</v>

1229
00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:33.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was never like bunch of real </v>

1230
00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:34.700
<v Speaker 1>headliners hanging out together like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are now.</v>

1231
00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:35.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1232
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:40.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean even the simplest things like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dalea does something funny and I'll just</v>

1233
00:51:40.151 --> 00:51:45.151
<v Speaker 4>put it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll talk about it all my open tabs and </v>

1234
00:51:45.151 --> 00:51:45.910
<v Speaker 4>get like half a million views and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you just go like I deleted.</v>

1235

<v Speaker 4>watch these days because I just watched </v>

<v Speaker 3>It felt like the green room at the main </v>

<v Speaker 3>room and the comedy store.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That means fucking flying helicopters.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that these,</v>

1298
00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:03.780
<v Speaker 3>the old way of looking at things as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong way.</v>

<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1349
00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:52.180
<v Speaker 4>you're not listening to me when you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1350
00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.680

1351
00:56:53.681 --> 00:56:55.750
<v Speaker 4>it makes me happy to see good things </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen to you.</v>

1352
00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:57.670
<v Speaker 4>I will always be a fan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will always support you.</v>

1353
00:56:57.671 --> 00:56:58.720
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as soon as he said that,</v>

1354
00:56:58.721 --> 00:57:01.030
<v Speaker 4>I thought it sounds super silly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm.</v>

1355
00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:03.200
<v Speaker 4>Before I met you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a fan like when you,</v>

1356
00:57:03.201 --> 00:57:05.200
<v Speaker 4>when that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the Carlos stuff went down,</v>

1357
00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:10.530
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got behind your back and I was </v>

1358
00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:10.530
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fan of Joe's.</v>

1359
00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:10.530
<v Speaker 4>I like what he's doing that he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>standing up for me.</v>

1360
00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:15.480
<v Speaker 4>And in a weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being a fan of something so fucking fun </v>

1361
00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:18.750
<v Speaker 4>when you become a fan and I think what </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcasts have done is allowed you to </v>

1362
00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:21.490
<v Speaker 4>enter by become intimate with your fans </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they support you in a way.</v>

1363
00:57:21.491 --> 00:57:24.520
<v Speaker 4>Like people go out and they see a video </v>
<v Speaker 4>of dns singing and they go,</v>

1364
00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:25.600
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm happy.</v>

1365
00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:28.210

<v Speaker 4>10,000</v>

1366
00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:29.200
<v Speaker 4>seats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there are people going,</v>

1367
00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:31.300
<v Speaker 4>fuck yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my guys winning.</v>

1368
00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:32.340
<v Speaker 4>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1369
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:33.410
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying.</v>

1370
00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're fans of each other too.</v>

1371
00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:37.250
<v Speaker 1>That's big too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also,</v>

1372
00:57:37.251 --> 00:57:38.510
<v Speaker 1>people realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1373
00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:43.570
<v Speaker 1>like you can be a fan of someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that somehow or another </v>

1374
00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:45.050
<v Speaker 1>you're a lesser person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1375
00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:49.400
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm sure bill burr is a fan of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chappelle.</v>

1376
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:51.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure Chappelle's a fan of Chris </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rock,</v>

1377
00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:54.980
<v Speaker 1>like people are fans of other people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>

1378
00:57:55.550 --> 00:57:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I think in the past that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>the case.</v>

1379
00:57:58.341 --> 00:58:00.230
<v Speaker 1>It was not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about separate camps.</v>

1380
00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:01.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1381
00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:03.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm in this year on that side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is so dumb,</v>

1382
00:58:03.801 --> 00:58:05.300
<v Speaker 1>so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you can also,</v>

1383
00:58:05.301 --> 00:58:06.610
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1384
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:09.800

<v Speaker 1>like there's a different sensibility.</v>

1422
00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:39.500
<v Speaker 1>There's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a more generous sensibility.</v>

<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1450
01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:38.330

1459
01:00:57.730 --> 01:00:59.621
<v Speaker 1>around those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to feel like there's something </v>

1460
01:00:59.621 --> 01:00:59.621
<v Speaker 1>wrong with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1462
01:00:59.621 --> 01:01:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Real stuck up super conservative people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just think there's something </v>

1463
01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:05.720
<v Speaker 1>wrong with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do I think this way?</v>

1464
01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Why do I always want to say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate thing?</v>

1465
01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.180
<v Speaker 4>It's like a muscle twitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go.</v>

1466
01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:12.190
<v Speaker 4>Just see how far you can make it a </v>
<v Speaker 4>course.</v>

1467
01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.450
<v Speaker 4>You start talking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be in a foot race.</v>

1468
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:19.660
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

1469
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:23.090
<v Speaker 1>You just see eyes widen and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1470
01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:24.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1471
01:01:24.511 --> 01:01:26.600
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not at a seminar right now,</v>

1472
01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.150
<v Speaker 1>and that's what's bullshit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>seminars.</v>

1473
01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1474
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:32.600
<v Speaker 1>imagine if you were in the world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

1475
01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:37.720
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think this is one of the </v>

1476
01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:37.720
<v Speaker 1>reasons why so many people are so fucked</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1477
01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>It's so depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the world of showing to,</v>

1478
01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:43.540
<v Speaker 1>showing up to a place and then having </v>
<v Speaker 1>your behavior limited into this very </v>

1479
01:01:43.761 --> 01:01:48.761
<v Speaker 1>narrow and rigid parameters all day long</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your livelihood and your success of </v>

1480
01:01:49.191 --> 01:01:54.191
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your family and whether or not you can </v>

1481
01:01:54.191 --> 01:01:56.291
<v Speaker 1>send your kids to a good school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that dependent upon whether or not </v>

1482
01:01:56.291 --> 01:02:00.191
<v Speaker 1>you're willing to play the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to wear an outfit with a suit </v>

1483
01:02:00.191 --> 01:02:03.641
<v Speaker 1>and tie because if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be unpredictable and you show </v>

1484
01:02:03.641 --> 01:02:04.280
<v Speaker 1>up with that t shirt on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a football shirt on at work.</v>

1485
01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.760
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is he drunk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is crazy?</v>

1486
01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:09.230
<v Speaker 1>He's doing drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't</v>

1487
01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:15.240
<v Speaker 4>little join around people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>just like joints around people crashed.</v>

1488
01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:19.980
<v Speaker 4>Tesla's stock</v>

1489
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.230
<v Speaker 3>by $9,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>or some stupid shit.</v>

1490
01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.790
<v Speaker 3>So crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1491
01:02:23.791 --> 01:02:27.960
<v Speaker 3>but not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It bounced right back into that world.</v>

1492
01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:29.580
<v Speaker 3>Like the guy can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1493
01:02:29.581 --> 01:02:32.000
<v Speaker 3>we were drinking whisky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1494
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:35.220
<v Speaker 3>No one has a problem with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is way more of a hard drug.</v>

1495
01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:37.860
<v Speaker 3>Way more of a crazy drug than a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>puff of a joint.</v>

1496
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:39.810
<v Speaker 3>We were drinking whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one cared.</v>

1497
01:02:39.811 --> 01:02:42.090
<v Speaker 3>We drank whiskey for three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one cared.</v>

1498
01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:43.970
<v Speaker 3>Smoked a little joint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1499
01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:45.240
<v Speaker 3>let you think.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Music.</v>

1619
01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:52.670
<v Speaker 2>The music is really the sting song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it was.</v>

1620
01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:55.010
<v Speaker 2>Pizza Shit movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the trailer sucks.</v>

1621
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:57.200
<v Speaker 2>Look at this as like an acting class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

1622
01:07:57.201 --> 01:07:57.890
<v Speaker 2>Let it play out.</v>

1623
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:59.130
<v Speaker 10>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>hold on a second.</v>

1624
01:07:59.131 --> 01:08:00.180
<v Speaker 10>I'm sure to pull the audio off.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we'll do Youtube Yankees for the </v>

<v Speaker 2>You look at them.</v>

1627
01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:12.280
<v Speaker 9>There's a look.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So fake.</v>

1628
01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:17.300
<v Speaker 10>No.</v>

1629

<v Speaker 3>This is so bad,</v>

1631
01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:30.740
<v Speaker 3>I can't even do a mobster anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it feels like a joke to play.</v>

1632
01:08:32.530 --> 01:08:34.660
<v Speaker 3>You could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would have to be like,</v>

1633
01:08:34.661 --> 01:08:37.510
<v Speaker 3>do you have to be authentic James </v>
<v Speaker 3>Gandolfini back to life.</v>

1634
01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.940
<v Speaker 3>Like if James Gandolfini was alive </v>
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>

1635
01:08:39.941 --> 01:08:41.520
<v Speaker 3>he could be a movie.</v>

1636
01:08:41.530 --> 01:08:42.820

1637
01:08:42.970 --> 01:08:44.170
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be authentic.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd believe it,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but he gotta be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gotta be done.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Scorsese,</v>

1641
01:08:49.991 --> 01:08:52.150

<v Speaker 3>like it's just.</v>

1642
01:08:52.690 --> 01:08:57.690
<v Speaker 3>There's just a bunch of people.</v>

1718
01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:41.900
<v Speaker 4>They had him dub his voice so they took </v>
<v Speaker 4>out his voice because he couldn't </v>

1719
01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:41.900
<v Speaker 4>understand them I guess.</v>

1782
01:15:55.651 --> 01:16:00.651
<v Speaker 3>Second time around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe in the context of the entire </v>

1783
01:16:00.651 --> 01:16:02.040
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love these mustaches.</v>

01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:04.810

1787
01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:18.270
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's still real.</v>

1788
01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:23.860
<v Speaker 3>It's one of my favorite things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watching all comics go up in the main </v>

1789
01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:23.860
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>

<v Speaker 3>their crowd.</v>

1793
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:34.580
<v Speaker 3>You could see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't realize what that was until you</v>

1794
01:16:34.581 --> 01:16:37.470
<v Speaker 3>just said it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it before and I've always been</v>

1795
01:16:37.471 --> 01:16:38.410
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1800
01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:47.880
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so funny to get more aggressive.</v>

1801
01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:51.490
<v Speaker 3>You can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a natural get aggressive about</v>

1802
01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:55.410
<v Speaker 3>being progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Motherfuckers aggressively progressive.</v>

1803
01:16:56.410 --> 01:17:01.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when all was like thought of </v>

1804
01:17:01.410 --> 01:17:01.410
<v Speaker 3>as you were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you were all.</v>

1805
01:17:01.410 --> 01:17:05.160
<v Speaker 3>You were like soft and progressive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitive and kind.</v>

1806
01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:08.400
<v Speaker 3>Now alt is right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all right,</v>

1807
01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:10.020
<v Speaker 3>you think of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think of outright</v>

1808
01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:12.470
<v Speaker 1>like that's all you hear about now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1809
01:17:12.471 --> 01:17:14.860
<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is like assholes.</v>

1810
01:17:14.890 --> 01:17:18.080
<v Speaker 1>You think of racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>xenophobia,</v>

1811
01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:21.770
<v Speaker 1>like the word all got sort of hijack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

1812
01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think about that,</v>

1813
01:17:23.361 --> 01:17:24.320
<v Speaker 1>but it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

1814
01:17:24.321 --> 01:17:29.321
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people's mind will definitely go </v>

1815
01:17:29.321 --> 01:17:31.430
<v Speaker 1>outright over the last few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like in the context in the world of </v>

1816
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:36.011
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually oddly usually implied </v>

1817
01:17:36.011 --> 01:17:37.610
<v Speaker 1>somebody who's probably far to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1818
01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:42.611
<v Speaker 1>but only with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think only within income with </v>

1819
01:17:42.611 --> 01:17:44.890
<v Speaker 1>audiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they even know that </v>

1820
01:17:44.890 --> 01:17:47.231
<v Speaker 1>expression anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like true all universally </v>

1821
01:17:47.231 --> 01:17:48.350
<v Speaker 1>publicly has sort of been hijacked by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1822
01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:53.090
<v Speaker 1>or at least the definition of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>hijacked by outright people.</v>

1823
01:17:53.150 --> 01:17:54.410
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is true,</v>

1824
01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:58.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1825
01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:00.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess so.</v>

1826
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:03.050
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I assume there's got to be an ot left,</v>

1827
01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:03.920
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1828
01:18:03.921 --> 01:18:04.220
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

1829
01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:09.440
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the problem is once you say </v>

1830
01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:09.440
<v Speaker 1>all now everybody just thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1831
01:18:09.570 --> 01:18:12.450
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have automatically turned out.</v>

1832
01:18:12.451 --> 01:18:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds made up.</v>

1833
01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1834
01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:17.790
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the alternative to the right of</v>

1835
01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:19.680
<v Speaker 1>the ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's young,</v>

1836
01:18:19.710 --> 01:18:20.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1837
01:18:20.710 --> 01:18:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But assholes.</v>

1838
01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:25.290
<v Speaker 1>So like the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think of conservative,</v>

1839
01:18:25.291 --> 01:18:30.291
<v Speaker 1>you would think of like Lindsey Graham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think of people that are probably </v>

1840
01:18:30.291 --> 01:18:30.291
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they keep it up.</v>

1841
01:18:33.490 --> 01:18:36.820
<v Speaker 4>Slippery shoes and the Lindsey Graham </v>
<v Speaker 4>was a chick until this week.</v>

1842
01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:38.940
<v Speaker 4>I literally went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's it,</v>

1843
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:40.600

1844
01:18:40.601 --> 01:18:41.410
<v Speaker 4>woman.</v>

<v Speaker 4>can't tell if it's gay or not.</v>

01:23:16.510 --> 01:23:18.880
<v Speaker 3>When he flies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the draw for flying private.</v>

1963
01:23:18.890 --> 01:23:23.890
<v Speaker 3>I obviously I can't afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Omega three or four days just wouldn't </v>

1964
01:23:23.890 --> 01:23:26.431
<v Speaker 3>make any money on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But is that you get done and you go </v>

1965
01:23:26.431 --> 01:23:26.431
<v Speaker 3>home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get done and you go to a.</v>

1966
01:23:26.431 --> 01:23:31.350
<v Speaker 3>You get on a plane and you fly home or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you just wait 20 minutes and you saved </v>

1967
01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:32.050
<v Speaker 3>$30,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Twenty minutes.</v>

1968
01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.600
<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't be nice to get on a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fly private.</v>

1969
01:23:34.601 --> 01:23:37.110
<v Speaker 3>You fucking cock done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you calling that?</v>

1970
01:23:37.150 --> 01:23:41.230
<v Speaker 3>God has no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just making them a cup.</v>

1971
01:23:41.530 --> 01:23:46.530
<v Speaker 3>You fly private though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't fly private and you have flow </v>

1972
01:23:46.530 --> 01:23:47.650
<v Speaker 3>private for like a couple of times but </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's never like.</v>

1973
01:23:47.651 --> 01:23:48.610
<v Speaker 3>Because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1974
01:23:48.611 --> 01:23:50.750
<v Speaker 3>I just got to get home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

1975
01:23:51.390 --> 01:23:56.290
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead of doing crazy transpo to get to</v>

1976
01:23:56.291 --> 01:24:00.300
<v Speaker 3>a Gig for a short of short flight though</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't do it like on a red,</v>

1977
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:02.470
<v Speaker 3>call them out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>call them out for flying private.</v>

1978
01:24:02.471 --> 01:24:05.980
<v Speaker 3>I saw that because I never thought about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it in the news like when.</v>

1979
01:24:05.981 --> 01:24:06.880
<v Speaker 3>That'd be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1980
01:24:06.881 --> 01:24:07.850
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you know,</v>

1981
01:24:07.851 --> 01:24:12.851
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the grossest celebrity </v>
<v Speaker 3>things ever is the posing in front of </v>

1982
01:24:12.851 --> 01:24:12.851
<v Speaker 3>the private jet.</v>

1983
01:24:12.851 --> 01:24:17.790
<v Speaker 3>Dude doesn't know what all the Comedians</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do that though because that's all </v>

1984
01:24:18.930 --> 01:24:19.990
<v Speaker 3>I guess they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1985
01:24:20.010 --> 01:24:23.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm black ones but I'm saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not our friends.</v>

1986
01:24:23.790 --> 01:24:24.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1987
01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:25.670
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A few that suck.</v>

1988
01:24:25.671 --> 01:24:26.640
<v Speaker 3>That do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1989
01:24:26.710 --> 01:24:31.710
<v Speaker 3>I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you looking at me looking at you </v>

1990
01:24:31.710 --> 01:24:34.120
<v Speaker 3>because you know who I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's only.</v>

1991
01:24:34.121 --> 01:24:36.460
<v Speaker 3>You can do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a weird thing.</v>

1992
01:24:36.490 --> 01:24:39.670
<v Speaker 3>It's like it would definitely pose in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of it shirtless.</v>

1993
01:24:39.671 --> 01:24:40.320
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would.</v>

1994
01:24:41.210 --> 01:24:46.210
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would it be weird if we were all on a </v>

1995
01:24:46.210 --> 01:24:46.720
<v Speaker 3>private jet flying somewhere and we post</v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff.</v>

1996
01:24:46.810 --> 01:24:47.710
<v Speaker 3>Would that be okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1997
01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:50.410
<v Speaker 3>because that's like dig in Aspen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>celebrate.</v>

1998
01:24:50.411 --> 01:24:53.740
<v Speaker 3>After sober October is over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we decided to book a Gig together and we</v>

1999
01:24:53.741 --> 01:24:58.741
<v Speaker 3>all were shirtless yammered on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>runway looking rip because we're gonna </v>

2000
01:24:58.741 --> 01:25:01.240
<v Speaker 3>lose shitloads of weight this month and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we all post.</v>

2001
01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:01.880
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2002
01:25:02.050 --> 01:25:03.580
<v Speaker 3>Let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really excited now.</v>

2003
01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:09.600
<v Speaker 3>How much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the most amount of points you've </v>

2004
01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:09.610
<v Speaker 3>gotten in a month and a month?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2005
01:25:10.150 --> 01:25:14.710
<v Speaker 3>I think it was right just under 4,500.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forty 500 is a lot.</v>

2006
01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:19.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the most I've seen somebody do with </v>

2007
01:25:19.770 --> 01:25:20.320
<v Speaker 3>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seven.</v>

2008
01:25:20.370 --> 01:25:22.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

2009
01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:27.280
<v Speaker 3>But that's like you're really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really going after it all the time,</v>

2010
01:25:27.340 --> 01:25:30.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably probably 30 days.</v>

2011
01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:33.070
<v Speaker 3>More than twice of what I did for 15 </v>
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

2012
01:25:33.550 --> 01:25:34.450
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

2013
01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:37.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

2014
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:39.110
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2015
01:25:39.250 --> 01:25:40.480
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing we didn't discuss </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

2016
01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:43.210
<v Speaker 3>So what's the bet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are the stakes?</v>

2017
01:25:43.211 --> 01:25:45.040
<v Speaker 3>What are we doing right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens if you win?</v>

2018
01:25:45.041 --> 01:25:46.570
<v Speaker 3>What happens if you lose?</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

2019
01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:49.270
<v Speaker 3>it's just us because ours isn't even in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this bed.</v>

2020
01:25:49.450 --> 01:25:50.140
<v Speaker 3>He asked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

2021
01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:50.860
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes.</v>

2022
01:25:50.890 --> 01:25:55.890
<v Speaker 3>My long walks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We couldn't stop giggling because I'm </v>

2023
01:25:55.890 --> 01:25:57.620
<v Speaker 3>like pictured already shirtless in New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York with a chest strap on it.</v>

2024
01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:00.970
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's.</v>

2025
01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's going to be San hope</v>

2026
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:07.190
<v Speaker 2>called me and said he wanted to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do this though.</v>

2027
01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:12.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to do this and he's also </v>

2028
01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:13.661
<v Speaker 2>not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like sober octoberish I can't go </v>

2029
01:26:13.661 --> 01:26:13.661
<v Speaker 2>off everything or I'll have a stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will nest that.</v>

2030
01:26:13.661 --> 01:26:18.541
<v Speaker 2>He can't go off everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just can't go off of the meeting is </v>

2031
01:26:18.541 --> 01:26:19.850
<v Speaker 2>actually going to a doctor this week and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to get himself checked out.</v>

2032
01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:25.180
<v Speaker 2>Which is a rare thing is stan hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know those stand up </v>

2033
01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:28.680
<v Speaker 2>is sort of a policy to not go to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor and when it breaks he dies.</v>

2034
01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's his idea.</v>

2035
01:26:31.170 --> 01:26:34.200
<v Speaker 2>His idea didn't want Mris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want diagnosis,</v>

2036
01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:37.770
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want recommendations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want prescriptions.</v>

2037
01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:42.970
<v Speaker 2>He is going this week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to go this week to get </v>

2038
01:26:42.970 --> 01:26:43.190
<v Speaker 2>himself checked out to make sure that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>can go.</v>

2039
01:26:43.191 --> 01:26:45.170
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2040
01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:51.320
<v Speaker 2>as much as Stan hope is sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fatalist and he loves being this lovable</v>

2041
01:26:51.591 --> 01:26:56.510
<v Speaker 2>drunk and I can't feel good to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>always be drunk,</v>

2042
01:26:56.780 --> 01:26:57.680
<v Speaker 2>it just can't feel good.</v>

2043
01:26:57.680 --> 01:26:59.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's taken time off before I.</v>

2044
01:26:59.621 --> 01:27:02.210
<v Speaker 2>I know he's taken time off before </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking as well.</v>

2045
01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:04.580
<v Speaker 2>I know he quit smoking for quite a while</v>
<v Speaker 2>at one point in time.</v>

2046
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:07.640
<v Speaker 2>I think he would like to be healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2047
01:27:07.641 --> 01:27:09.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know he would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would have more energy.</v>

2048
01:27:09.261 --> 01:27:11.770
<v Speaker 2>I think it would make his comedy better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do not.</v>

2049
01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:13.700
<v Speaker 2>This comedy is not amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

2050
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.600
<v Speaker 2>But I just think you'd have more energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>know energy is a big thing.</v>

2051
01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:21.770
<v Speaker 2>So I think and I also think he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to do and connects them to us.</v>

2052
01:27:21.771 --> 01:27:26.150
<v Speaker 2>He's out there and fucking bumfuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bisbee Arizona out with a bunch of dorks</v>

2053
01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:27.610
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2054
01:27:29.690 --> 01:27:34.690
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like partying as fuck you like </v>

2055
01:27:34.690 --> 01:27:34.690
<v Speaker 2>partying anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2058
01:27:40.761 --> 01:27:43.700

<v Speaker 2>Encrypted email.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and then I want you to watch a machine </v>

2061

2062
01:27:50.890 --> 01:27:50.890
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's make another one.</v>

2063
01:27:50.890 --> 01:27:51.260
<v Speaker 2>Let's make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had,</v>

2064
01:27:51.261 --> 01:27:53.210
<v Speaker 2>I've had moments where that where people</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

2065
01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.970
<v Speaker 2>we could get you into some trouble and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>got fucking scared.</v>

2066
01:27:56.150 --> 01:27:58.220
<v Speaker 2>I was with a group in Tanzania.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

2067
01:27:58.221 --> 01:28:00.200
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go kidnap a baby elephant</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're into it.</v>

2068
01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:01.640
<v Speaker 2>I was mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn Dude.</v>

2069
01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:03.870
<v Speaker 2>Kidnap a baby elephant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2070
01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Another tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kidnap this elephant sanctuary and they </v>

2071
01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:11.390
<v Speaker 2>get the kid back and the Messiah was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going into kidnap back and I was like,</v>

2072
01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:17.290
<v Speaker 2>part of me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get a little bit of a buzz I'm </v>

2073
01:28:17.290 --> 01:28:17.290
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was just.</v>

2074
01:28:17.290 --> 01:28:18.660
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like a good way to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2075
01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

2076
01:28:20.601 --> 01:28:23.320
<v Speaker 2>Instagram video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about the insta stories.</v>

2077
01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:26.480
<v Speaker 2>The um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the time to do those instastories</v>

2078
01:28:26.481 --> 01:28:28.670
<v Speaker 2>because it does not interfere with </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual life.</v>

2079
01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:33.880
<v Speaker 2>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how often are you present in real life </v>

2080
01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:36.311
<v Speaker 2>when you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at your dots on your instastory </v>

2081
01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:36.680
<v Speaker 2>and like Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like 70 dot.</v>

2082
01:28:36.710 --> 01:28:38.450
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't ever put that many.</v>

2083
01:28:38.451 --> 01:28:40.760
<v Speaker 2>I put up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably put up 10 a day.</v>

2084
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:42.950
<v Speaker 2>That's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2085
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:46.260
<v Speaker 2>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not mine or yours might be mine.</v>

2086
01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:48.110
<v Speaker 2>Why is it beeping?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I take it off of this?</v>

2087
01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:51.920
<v Speaker 2>Having it hanging like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes it'll just do it anyways,</v>

2088
01:28:51.921 --> 01:28:54.470
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fine like that for working out.</v>

2089
01:28:55.060 --> 01:29:00.060
<v Speaker 2>If it beeps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One beat means it's on that three beat </v>

2090
01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:01.410
<v Speaker 2>means I shut all the beeps off on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>APP so I could use it in yoga class.</v>

2091
01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2092
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:02.820
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2093
01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:04.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't want it to beep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And of course,</v>

2094
01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:05.290
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2095
01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:10.560
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can wear those sensors right if you </v>

2096
01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:10.560
<v Speaker 4>want it to like make,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get a good reading to start.</v>

2097
01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:11.970
<v Speaker 4>It worked out great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was good.</v>

2098
01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:15.720
<v Speaker 4>I look at instastories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I look at instagram as part of business.</v>

2099
01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:19.350
<v Speaker 1>Start me again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking thing's annoying.</v>

2100

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you looked at as part of business.</v>

2101
01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:24.880
<v Speaker 4>Part of my business and so I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am very present in life.</v>

2102
01:29:24.881 --> 01:29:26.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the story,</v>

2103
01:29:26.171 --> 01:29:31.171
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like in moments like when the rat </v>

2104
01:29:31.171 --> 01:29:33.961
<v Speaker 4>runs into our house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely learned the story that I </v>

2105
01:29:33.961 --> 01:29:33.961
<v Speaker 4>always have my phone on me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in my pocket.</v>

<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2108
01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:41.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm terrible at this at home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was not a good parent.</v>

2109
01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:45.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm taking care of my kids by myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my wife somewhere traveling abroad.</v>

2116
01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:59.960
<v Speaker 4>it looks like more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said I love the school with a bag of </v>

2117
01:29:59.960 --> 01:29:59.980
<v Speaker 4>rice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's only 1:00</v>

2118
01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:04.980
<v Speaker 4>PM and you have eight dots already </v>
<v Speaker 4>summer from last night and yesterday </v>

2119
01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:04.980
<v Speaker 4>it's 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2120
01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:06.720
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2121
01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:09.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm parenting by myself.</v>

2122
01:30:09.551 --> 01:30:10.780
<v Speaker 4>I can't do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not good at it.</v>

2123
01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:11.740
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2124
01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:13.840
<v Speaker 4>it's a good chance to bond with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids.</v>

2125
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:16.990
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or they realize exactly how out of touch</v>

2126
01:30:16.991 --> 01:30:18.360
<v Speaker 4>you are with their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2127
01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:22.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not one for giving parental advice,</v>

2128
01:30:22.621 --> 01:30:27.621
<v Speaker 1>but what I would say to do is abandoned </v>
<v Speaker 1>all other things you do while you're </v>

2129
01:30:27.621 --> 01:30:29.400
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think of yourself as like a mom,</v>

2130
01:30:29.570 --> 01:30:34.570
<v Speaker 1>like a house mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like instead of like trying to squeeze </v>

2131
01:30:34.570 --> 01:30:35.550
<v Speaker 1>it in with all the other shit you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't be good at it if you do that.</v>

2132
01:30:35.970 --> 01:30:36.620
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

2133
01:30:36.630 --> 01:30:37.040
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2134
01:30:37.041 --> 01:30:42.041
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if my wife goes somewhere and I have to </v>

2135
01:30:42.041 --> 01:30:42.041
<v Speaker 1>just take care of my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do anything else.</v>

2136
01:30:42.041 --> 01:30:44.310
<v Speaker 1>I schedule nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing else.</v>

2137
01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:46.680
<v Speaker 1>If I do a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to do it during the day while the</v>

2138
01:30:46.681 --> 01:30:49.770
<v Speaker 1>kids are at school and then once there I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't go to,</v>

2139
01:30:49.970 --> 01:30:52.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't do shows that night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do shit.</v>

2140
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:55.140

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2205
01:33:15.761 --> 01:33:20.470
<v Speaker 1>being a teenager's fucking tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta like remind them over and over</v>

2206
01:33:20.471 --> 01:33:25.471
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with a term called </v>

2207
01:33:25.471 --> 01:33:27.850
<v Speaker 1>downpour of hormones that you just don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what to do with.</v>

2208
01:33:27.890 --> 01:33:29.280
<v Speaker 1>You remember what that was like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Confused bodies in fucking disarray for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2211
01:33:35.321 --> 01:33:40.321
<v Speaker 1>It's probably exacerbated by like them </v>
<v Speaker 1>being like this generation then knowing </v>

2212
01:33:40.321 --> 01:33:44.221
<v Speaker 1>that you're racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking trunk and racist.</v>

2213
01:33:45.670 --> 01:33:48.130
<v Speaker 1>And then the crossfit people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>picketing outside your house.</v>

2214
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:57.760

01:33:57.770 --> 01:33:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the most you've ever,</v>

2216
01:33:59.350 --> 01:34:02.740
<v Speaker 1>the most you've ever gotten is um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what did I,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's a normal workout for me,</v>

2219
01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:13.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think 200 is like a is a good strong </v>

2233
01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:45.860
<v Speaker 4>But you're planning on Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're planning on trust.</v>

2234
01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:51.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2235
01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:51.340
<v Speaker 4>points a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're running six days a week,</v>

2239
01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:57.890

<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

2242
01:34:59.751 --> 01:35:01.280
<v Speaker 2>That's the key to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We put an 8,000</v>

<v Speaker 2>When I'm doing the hunting trip,</v>

<v Speaker 2>when you're.</v>

2251
01:35:26.150 --> 01:35:31.150
<v Speaker 2>That's some of the most brutal workouts </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever done because you're hiking at </v>

2252
01:35:31.150 --> 01:35:33.590
<v Speaker 2>altitude and when you're at altitude </v>

<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>hunting.</v>

2259
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:53.510

2260
01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:55.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would come out to some crazy number.</v>

<v Speaker 2>they were much less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gave us a first class experience.</v>

2304
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:57.190
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2305
01:37:57.450 --> 01:37:59.340

<v Speaker 3>Like what would be the stakes go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gotta be.</v>

2307
01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:05.790

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:33.630
<v Speaker 3>That's where Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cable guy performs.</v>

2320
01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:37.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking places like that.</v>

2321
01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:40.380
<v Speaker 3>It's so big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As audiences are winds,</v>

2322
01:38:40.381 --> 01:38:41.360
<v Speaker 3>floyd mayweather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pacquiao.</v>

2323
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:43.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's in December.</v>

2324
01:38:43.630 --> 01:38:47.170
<v Speaker 3>Is it in December?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2325
01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:50.360
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be in Japan though,</v>

2326
01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:55.260
<v Speaker 3>into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This might be a day of a book to get.</v>

2327
01:38:55.261 --> 01:39:00.261
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's talk that it might be their </v>

2328
01:39:00.261 --> 01:39:00.261
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2329
01:39:00.261 --> 01:39:02.680
<v Speaker 3>let's go to that in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds crazy,</v>

2330
01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:06.210
<v Speaker 3>but it also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like asking a hundred grand.</v>

2331
01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:11.760
<v Speaker 3>We're not flying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coach are not flying coach.</v>

2332
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:15.760
<v Speaker 3>She lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way</v>

2333
01:39:16.130 --> 01:39:16.850
<v Speaker 1>he could win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2334
01:39:16.851 --> 01:39:21.610
<v Speaker 1>So someone has to someone else to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But more importantly one person is going</v>

2335
01:39:21.611 --> 01:39:22.590
<v Speaker 1>to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

2336
01:39:22.591 --> 01:39:27.591
<v Speaker 1>So like if you beat me and I beat you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't mean shit because we're all </v>

2337
01:39:27.591 --> 01:39:27.591
<v Speaker 1>beating Ari.</v>

2338
01:39:27.591 --> 01:39:28.800
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a skins game.</v>

2339
01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:30.480
<v Speaker 3>He's already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2340
01:39:30.481 --> 01:39:31.090
<v Speaker 3>he's going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not</v>

2341
01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:32.400
<v Speaker 1>doing the fucking point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

2342
01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:33.750
<v Speaker 1>but maybe he's listening to us right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2343
01:39:33.751 --> 01:39:35.070
<v Speaker 1>He's stewing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should we call him?</v>

2344
01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:38.010
<v Speaker 1>He's getting angry and he's sober,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which Mike might do even more.</v>

2345
01:39:38.130 --> 01:39:39.060
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

2346
01:39:39.090 --> 01:39:40.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to fucking win.</v>

2347
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:45.950
<v Speaker 1>What if red goes crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking goes whole hog every day.</v>

2348
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Six hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Takes spin classes and crossfit classes </v>

2349
01:39:51.870 --> 01:39:53.280
<v Speaker 1>and whereas it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during Jujitsu,</v>

2350
01:39:53.610 --> 01:39:57.270
<v Speaker 1>floyd mayweather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his planet come back in Tokyo before his</v>

2351
01:39:57.271 --> 01:39:58.000
<v Speaker 1>rematch with Mandy.</v>

2352
01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:01.490
<v Speaker 3>This was a couple weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2353
01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:03.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he wants a tune up fight.</v>

2354
01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:06.140
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might not be real.</v>

2355
01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:06.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might that be?</v>

2356
01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:08.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2357
01:40:08.170 --> 01:40:09.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2358
01:40:09.330 --> 01:40:10.920
<v Speaker 1>would you go to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to go to the fight though.</v>

2359
01:40:10.970 --> 01:40:12.540
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be an interesting fight.</v>

2360
01:40:12.570 --> 01:40:14.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're both past their prime,</v>

2361
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:16.290
<v Speaker 1>but it will be a fun event too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2362
01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:19.230
<v Speaker 1>But I mean was just knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucas,</v>

2363
01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:24.120
<v Speaker 1>PTSA and floyd hasn't fought in a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>since he beat conor Mcgregor,</v>

2364
01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:27.330
<v Speaker 1>but that's not a real box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a boxing match,</v>

2365
01:40:27.331 --> 01:40:29.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's on a boxing match at an elite </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

2366
01:40:29.191 --> 01:40:34.191
<v Speaker 1>Like if it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he was boxing terrence Crawford or </v>

2367
01:40:34.191 --> 01:40:36.360
<v Speaker 1>someone who's like at the very top now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not in that kind of zone right now,</v>

2368
01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:41.750
<v Speaker 1>but he's still the best ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It if not the one of assurance of the </v>

2369
01:40:42.181 --> 01:40:44.460
<v Speaker 1>greatest boxers in the history of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world ever.</v>

2370
01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:46.180
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no question.</v>

2371
01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:48.310
<v Speaker 3>What we should do is tear the tear of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the winnings.</v>

2372
01:40:48.850 --> 01:40:50.920
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First place pays for nothing.</v>

2373
01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:52.570
<v Speaker 3>Whole weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked this idea.</v>

2374
01:40:52.571 --> 01:40:57.571
<v Speaker 3>Second pays for their pace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for their tickets to whatever is least </v>

2375
01:40:57.571 --> 01:40:59.470
<v Speaker 3>expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pays for their ticket and nothing else.</v>

2376
01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:04.740
<v Speaker 3>Third place plays for a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>all hotels are saying tear it off,</v>

2377
01:41:05.801 --> 01:41:08.380
<v Speaker 3>so that's the last place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just pays the most out,</v>

2378
01:41:08.381 --> 01:41:10.810
<v Speaker 3>but he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not dropping so forth.</v>

2379
01:41:10.811 --> 01:41:14.440
<v Speaker 3>Twenty grams in the last place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Person has to cover flights,</v>

2380
01:41:14.441 --> 01:41:15.880
<v Speaker 3>but they can use their miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2381
01:41:15.881 --> 01:41:18.390
<v Speaker 3>the problem is res bets are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2382
01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:18.730
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2383
01:41:19.030 --> 01:41:23.520
<v Speaker 3>The loser has to wear a beard of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>pubes and he's got a.</v>

2384
01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:28.920
<v Speaker 3>he's got to clean his face with his </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking all of his suggestions.</v>

2385
01:41:30.631 --> 01:41:35.631
<v Speaker 3>So psychotic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drink all of our pis and I really am </v>

2386
01:41:35.631 --> 01:41:36.430
<v Speaker 3>solid over my shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

2387
01:41:36.431 --> 01:41:37.340
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2388
01:41:37.341 --> 01:41:37.990
<v Speaker 3>you were not drinking.</v>

2389
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:39.760
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2390
01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:42.610
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to do a panhandler for six hours</v>

2391
01:41:42.611 --> 01:41:45.040
<v Speaker 3>on the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was a homeless guy who was like,</v>

2392
01:41:45.041 --> 01:41:48.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm into that already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2393
01:41:48.761 --> 01:41:49.510
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2394
01:41:49.511 --> 01:41:51.430
<v Speaker 3>He wanted us to do really ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

2395
01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:54.490
<v Speaker 3>like down the street naked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The tears of paying for it.</v>

2396
01:41:54.491 --> 01:41:56.320
<v Speaker 3>So it's not all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good idea.</v>

2397
01:41:56.430 --> 01:42:01.430
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So one person doesn't take the whole </v>

2398
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.430
<v Speaker 3>beating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First place pays nothing all week.</v>

2399
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:02.560
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first place should be.</v>

2400
01:42:02.830 --> 01:42:05.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't cover the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd get like a belt.</v>

2401
01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:06.620
<v Speaker 3>We should make a belt.</v>

<v Speaker 4>rid of the meet and greet.</v>

2500
01:46:13.230 --> 01:46:18.230

<v Speaker 4>a meet and greet,</v>

2503
01:46:22.311 --> 01:46:26.090
<v Speaker 4>but I definitely can't do 1200 people </v>
<v Speaker 4>like I did when I did the Wilbur.</v>

2504
01:46:26.091 --> 01:46:30.020

<v Speaker 4>next door and it was fucking chaos.</v>

2531
01:47:27.020 --> 01:47:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

2532
01:47:27.691 --> 01:47:32.691
<v Speaker 1>But you're not really a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just a guy trying to get me to </v>

2533
01:47:32.691 --> 01:47:32.691
<v Speaker 1>work for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll say I'll sign one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll sign one.</v>

2536
01:47:34.991 --> 01:47:39.991
<v Speaker 1>And they get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some guy got mad and philly </v>

01:47:39.991 --> 01:47:41.330
<v Speaker 1>remember that dude got upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's famous.</v>

2538
01:47:42.140 --> 01:47:43.530
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a fan.</v>

2539
01:47:43.531 --> 01:47:45.420
<v Speaker 1>You just told me you're not a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He told me.</v>

2540
01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:47.830
<v Speaker 1>He literally told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like a huge.</v>

2541

<v Speaker 1>You don't even sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he goes,</v>

2542

<v Speaker 1>like $7.</v>

2543
01:47:51.580 --> 01:47:56.580
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck what they sell for </v>

2544
01:47:56.580 --> 01:47:56.580
<v Speaker 1>my autograph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2545
01:47:56.580 --> 01:47:57.690
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

2546
01:47:57.780 --> 01:47:59.310
<v Speaker 1>don't show up at the airport and </v>
<v Speaker 1>harassed me.</v>

2547
01:47:59.311 --> 01:48:00.630
<v Speaker 1>Then I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll sign one.</v>

2548
01:48:00.770 --> 01:48:02.510
<v Speaker 4>Do you do a meet and greet?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You used to do meet and greet tonight.</v>

2549
01:48:02.580 --> 01:48:04.980
<v Speaker 1>I used to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll still do that,</v>

2550
01:48:04.981 --> 01:48:08.220
<v Speaker 1>but I used to do meet and greets at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago theater for 3,700</v>

2551
01:48:08.221 --> 01:48:13.221
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would wait and take photos with </v>

2552
01:48:13.221 --> 01:48:14.520
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't do it anymore.</v>

2553
01:48:14.521 --> 01:48:17.790
<v Speaker 1>People go too crazy as the podcast got </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazier and crazier.</v>

2554
01:48:17.791 --> 01:48:22.791
<v Speaker 1>People go crazy and they were hold on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your arm and want to tell you how you </v>

2555
01:48:22.791 --> 01:48:24.240
<v Speaker 1>changed their life and want to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like long stories.</v>

2556
01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:24.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2557
01:48:25.890 --> 01:48:30.890
<v Speaker 1>there's 500 people behind you waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't give you 15 minutes here.</v>

2558
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:33.090
<v Speaker 1>I can give you five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2559
01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:38.380
<v Speaker 1>it just got too strange and it just got </v>
<v Speaker 1>too many people wanting to get on the </v>

2560
01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:42.501
<v Speaker 1>podcast like you got to get me on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you my story about </v>

2561
01:48:42.501 --> 01:48:42.870
<v Speaker 1>beating drug addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm sure it's a great story.</v>

2562
01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:44.370
<v Speaker 1>I can't get you on a stop.</v>

2563
01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:46.230
<v Speaker 1>This is not how this works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2564
01:48:46.231 --> 01:48:48.010
<v Speaker 1>There's just too much of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much.</v>

2565
01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:50.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was just high,</v>

2566
01:48:50.430 --> 01:48:52.650
<v Speaker 1>I want to take a picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a good time.</v>

2567
01:48:52.890 --> 01:48:54.420
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not that.</v>

2568
01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Then it's all these agenda driven people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all want to do things and they </v>

2569
01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:01.410
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want you to do things for them.</v>

2570
01:49:01.411 --> 01:49:03.810
<v Speaker 1>They think there's too many people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been on the podcast,</v>

2571
01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:08.840
<v Speaker 1>just regular folks and then they get on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcast and now people know about </v>

2572
01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:09.750
<v Speaker 1>them and so a lot of people think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2573
01:49:09.751 --> 01:49:13.050
<v Speaker 1>if I just got on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would make my career totally,</v>

2574
01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:18.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're a singer or they have a </v>

2575
01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:18.450
<v Speaker 1>book or this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just gets too annoying.</v>

2576
01:49:19.070 --> 01:49:21.090
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too overwhelming.</v>

2577
01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:24.030
<v Speaker 1>But the meet and greet is actually like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of your brand,</v>

2578
01:49:24.031 --> 01:49:24.530
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2579
01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:25.390
<v Speaker 4>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2580
01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:26.500
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like when we did,</v>

2581
01:49:26.530 --> 01:49:30.070
<v Speaker 4>we did the Chicago theater run with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Macondo and nate and all those guys.</v>

2582
01:49:31.540 --> 01:49:32.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know,</v>

2583
01:49:32.210 --> 01:49:35.140
<v Speaker 4>just um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I uh,</v>

2584
01:49:35.350 --> 01:49:35.990
<v Speaker 4>like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>None of the,</v>

2585
01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:38.320
<v Speaker 4>none of the guys wanted to do meet and </v>
<v Speaker 4>greet and I.</v>

2586
01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:40.930
<v Speaker 4>There was like a thousand people waiting</v>
<v Speaker 4>outside the theater and I thought,</v>

2587
01:49:41.110 --> 01:49:46.110
<v Speaker 4>I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's different because that's who </v>

2588
01:49:46.110 --> 01:49:46.110
<v Speaker 4>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if I go see a band I am,</v>

2589
01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:51.240
<v Speaker 4>I am like super compelled to go talk to </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and tell them how great I thought </v>

2590
01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:52.420
<v Speaker 4>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Part of that is who I am.</v>

2591
01:49:52.630 --> 01:49:57.630
<v Speaker 4>And so I went out and did pictures with </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone waiting in the alley at the </v>

2592
01:49:57.630 --> 01:49:58.660
<v Speaker 4>Chicago theater and I was like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when someone goes,</v>

2593
01:49:58.661 --> 01:49:59.470
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have no idea.</v>

2594
01:49:59.471 --> 01:50:01.210
<v Speaker 4>I love the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love Tommy.</v>

2595
01:50:01.211 --> 01:50:02.460
<v Speaker 4>I love the weight loss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I beat,</v>

2596
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:04.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that interaction.</v>

2597
01:50:04.271 --> 01:50:06.970
<v Speaker 4>I remember one time I was in Scotland </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

2598
01:50:07.150 --> 01:50:07.930
<v Speaker 4>I just hit it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2599
01:50:07.931 --> 01:50:09.820
<v Speaker 4>is anyone any fans when you go have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>beer with me?</v>

2600
01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:15.060
<v Speaker 4>And these three guys showed up and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was right when bobcat was on your </v>

2601
01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:15.730
<v Speaker 4>podcast and we just bullshitted about </v>
<v Speaker 4>bobcat appearance.</v>

2602
01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:17.440
<v Speaker 4>We'd all listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2603
01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:18.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I,</v>

2604
01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:23.580
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know what I'd like to maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>charge only like weed out the people </v>

2605
01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:23.980
<v Speaker 4>that don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2606
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:25.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But see there's the problem,</v>

2607
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:30.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm philosophically opposed to making </v>

2608
01:50:30.510 --> 01:50:32.830
<v Speaker 2>people pay for pictures and making </v>
<v Speaker 2>people pay to hang out with you.</v>

2609
01:50:32.831 --> 01:50:34.090
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think it's right.</v>

2610
01:50:34.250 --> 01:50:37.200
<v Speaker 4>But there should be a way to like just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2611
01:50:37.210 --> 01:50:39.260
<v Speaker 4>but there's this thin the herd is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing unless you</v>

2612
01:50:39.370 --> 01:50:44.370
<v Speaker 2>charged money or pick people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like there's a company now that does </v>

2613
01:50:44.370 --> 01:50:48.541
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do these vip things and someone </v>

2614
01:50:48.541 --> 01:50:48.541
<v Speaker 2>brought it up to me and like you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>make this.</v>

2615
01:50:48.541 --> 01:50:49.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing it.</v>

2616
01:50:49.230 --> 01:50:50.760
<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could make someone stop.</v>

2617
01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:53.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I used to do it for free forever.</v>

2618
01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.990
<v Speaker 2>I stopped doing it because too many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people got too weird.</v>

2619
01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:59.020
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not going to charge people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not going to do it.</v>

2620
01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:04.140
<v Speaker 2>But I know a lot of fucking people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>do a lot of people and they make a lot </v>

2621
01:51:04.140 --> 01:51:05.230
<v Speaker 2>of money doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You used to do it right?</v>

2622
01:51:05.470 --> 01:51:06.930
<v Speaker 2>What the ingredient?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2623
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:08.260
<v Speaker 2>I used to also feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2624
01:51:08.290 --> 01:51:10.330
<v Speaker 2>honestly like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like meeting people.</v>

2625
01:51:10.331 --> 01:51:15.331
<v Speaker 2>I a people on the street and meet them </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I walk out of the back of the </v>

2626
01:51:15.370 --> 01:51:16.330
<v Speaker 2>venue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always,</v>

2627
01:51:16.331 --> 01:51:17.920
<v Speaker 2>there's people there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always meet people,</v>

2628
01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:19.450
<v Speaker 2>but I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2629
01:51:19.510 --> 01:51:22.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that good at the meet and greet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not that comfortable with it.</v>

2630
01:51:22.810 --> 01:51:23.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it that much.</v>

2631
01:51:23.850 --> 01:51:25.060
<v Speaker 4>The is definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2632
01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:27.190
<v Speaker 4>in not being shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not you.</v>

2633
01:51:27.191 --> 01:51:27.940
<v Speaker 4>You're not like,</v>

01:51:28.110 --> 01:51:33.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm not very social people that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people that are demanding and </v>

2635
01:51:33.110 --> 01:51:33.600
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2636
01:51:33.601 --> 01:51:37.040
<v Speaker 2>you don't love your fans because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not true extra thing from now.</v>

2637
01:51:37.410 --> 01:51:37.710
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2638
01:51:37.711 --> 01:51:38.910
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the arrangement.</v>

2639
01:51:38.970 --> 01:51:41.760
<v Speaker 2>The range of Nez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work hard on my act.</v>

2643
01:51:47.730 --> 01:51:49.560
<v Speaker 2>That's the arrangement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

2644
01:51:49.570 --> 01:51:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Goodnight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are Our deals done?</v>

2645
01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:56.600
<v Speaker 2>And now if you think that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell me some fucking life story for 20 </v>

2646
01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:57.320
<v Speaker 2>minutes or I'm not your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2647
01:51:57.460 --> 01:51:59.670
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not the arrangement.</v>

2648
01:51:59.671 --> 01:52:04.671
<v Speaker 2>This is not like you're demanding too </v>
<v Speaker 2>much and you're also not aware of how </v>

2649
01:52:04.671 --> 01:52:05.190
<v Speaker 2>many other people would want to do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>

2650
01:52:05.690 --> 01:52:07.550
<v Speaker 2>Like it would be impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

2651
01:52:07.551 --> 01:52:09.330
<v Speaker 2>it's untenable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do it.</v>

2652
01:52:09.331 --> 01:52:10.730
<v Speaker 2>There's too many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that for me,</v>

2653
01:52:10.731 --> 01:52:13.860
<v Speaker 2>like anybody who wants to wait outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>that door,</v>

2654
01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:16.890
<v Speaker 2>I'll meet anybody to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She fucked up.</v>

2655
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:21.910
<v Speaker 2>Son shouldn't have said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a mistake that they're not </v>

2656
01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:22.020
<v Speaker 2>going to wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're coming right now.</v>

2657
01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:27.680
<v Speaker 2>There was one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a little trailer out there </v>

2658
01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:27.680
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

<v Speaker 4>because we're so very different.</v>

2660
01:52:30.261 --> 01:52:31.670
<v Speaker 4>Men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2661
01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:36.700
<v Speaker 4>there was once a comment on his </v>
<v Speaker 4>instagram that made me laugh so hard </v>

2662
01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:37.140
<v Speaker 4>compared to my comments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a,</v>

2663
01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:42.160
<v Speaker 4>Hey Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really sorry for looking at you at </v>

2664
01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:42.750
<v Speaker 4>the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They said,</v>

2665
01:52:42.860 --> 01:52:43.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

2666
01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:46.340
<v Speaker 4>Hi Heidi with the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2667
01:52:46.630 --> 01:52:49.220
<v Speaker 4>but it's just Tom's face just like he </v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

2668
01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:51.380
<v Speaker 4>He's not needy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>

2669
01:52:51.381 --> 01:52:53.540
<v Speaker 4>And so when some guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hi Tom on high,</v>

2670
01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:55.340
<v Speaker 4>and then the guys didn't know what to </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

2671
01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:56.040
<v Speaker 4>I walked away.</v>

2672
01:52:56.150 --> 01:52:56.960
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2673
01:52:56.990 --> 01:52:58.310
<v Speaker 3>he came out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still remember it.</v>

2674
01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:03.360
<v Speaker 3>I was Atlanta airport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He came over as I was about to take the </v>

2675
01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:05.770
<v Speaker 3>escalator at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at Hartsfield Jackson and he,</v>

2676
01:53:05.930 --> 01:53:06.590
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big fan.</v>

2682
01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:15.590
<v Speaker 3>Never thought twice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he wrote,</v>

2683
01:53:15.890 --> 01:53:18.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry that I bothered you at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>airport.</v>

2684
01:53:18.171 --> 01:53:19.980
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't bother me at all.</v>

2685
01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:25.040
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just someone who's trying to get </v>

2686
01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:25.460
<v Speaker 3>a reaction from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not really sorry.</v>

2687
01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:27.920
<v Speaker 3>And also there was nothing to be sorry </v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

2688
01:53:27.950 --> 01:53:30.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt he was like,</v>

2689
01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:31.490
<v Speaker 3>he just wants to keep it going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 4>kind of fucking the hammer.</v>

2714
01:54:17.710 --> 01:54:20.440

<v Speaker 4>Of course he called me about it because </v>

2717
01:54:31.110 --> 01:54:31.620
<v Speaker 4>I didn't see it</v>

<v Speaker 3>How do you spell it?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I noticed soon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called the zone yet,</v>

2725
01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:52.040
<v Speaker 3>what's called what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's not zone.</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Hey man.</v>

2727
01:54:54.020 --> 01:54:56.990
<v Speaker 3>He can't change how people pronounce </v>
<v Speaker 3>things phonetically.</v>

2728
01:54:56.991 --> 01:55:01.991
<v Speaker 3>That's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm probably made it and it got </v>

2729
01:55:01.991 --> 01:55:01.991
<v Speaker 3>stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

01:55:01.991 --> 01:55:02.180
<v Speaker 3>a blue saucy just beat the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rory Macdonald.</v>

2731
01:55:02.210 --> 01:55:07.210
<v Speaker 3>Stopped him in the second round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even get a chance to see it </v>

2732
01:55:07.210 --> 01:55:09.371
<v Speaker 3>because I thought it was going to be on </v>
<v Speaker 3>TV and so I went to check my Bella tour </v>

2733
01:55:09.371 --> 01:55:12.290
<v Speaker 3>on my dvr and it wasn't even there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he beat him with his Dick.</v>

2734
01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:19.080
<v Speaker 4>Pick it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how I got to cut weight </v>

2735
01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:19.080
<v Speaker 4>without cooking hog on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:21.490
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to see that footage now.</v>

2737
01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:25.960
<v Speaker 4>How big?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A 10 inches.</v>

2738
01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:28.780
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's bigger than this.</v>

2739
01:55:30.150 --> 01:55:31.660
<v Speaker 4>Fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fatter than a water bottle.</v>

2740
01:55:38.770 --> 01:55:43.770
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No certain point in time you dick </v>

2741
01:55:43.770 --> 01:55:43.770
<v Speaker 4>becomes a liability when it's as fat as </v>
<v Speaker 4>a water.</v>

2742
01:55:43.770 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't</v>

2743
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:48.980
<v Speaker 1>know what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how we brought that into </v>

2744
01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:50.691
<v Speaker 1>the ring with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like every girl needs probably </v>

2745
01:55:50.691 --> 01:55:51.930
<v Speaker 1>unsatisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

2746
01:55:52.530 --> 01:55:53.760
<v Speaker 1>As soon as they pull it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

2747
01:55:53.790 --> 01:55:55.980
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of here out.</v>

2748
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:58.080
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's always one 72.</v>

2749
01:55:58.510 --> 01:56:03.510
<v Speaker 1>He was weighed one 72 that day because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got on the scale after he did know he </v>

2750
01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:04.080
<v Speaker 1>weighs more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fights it one 85.</v>

2751
01:56:04.350 --> 01:56:09.350
<v Speaker 1>He cuts wait to get to one 85.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to be a light heavyweight </v>

2752
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:12.321
<v Speaker 1>champion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he used to be fighting it maybe a </v>

2753
01:56:12.321 --> 01:56:12.321
<v Speaker 1>little too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing wrong,</v>

2754
01:56:12.321 --> 01:56:14.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe it looks at the school and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scale was off because I said I'm </v>

2755
01:56:14.970 --> 01:56:18.081
<v Speaker 1>going to say this now that I said that </v>
<v Speaker 1>once you weighed one 95 to 30,</v>

2756
01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:24.520
<v Speaker 1>something could make one 72.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would destroy everyone in the </v>

2757
01:56:24.520 --> 01:56:25.650
<v Speaker 1>welterweight division.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a murderer.</v>

2758
01:56:25.710 --> 01:56:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Is that how you say his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Gardens.</v>

2759
01:56:27.530 --> 01:56:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Saucy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was Gerald mean dyslexic </v>

2760
01:56:32.530 --> 01:56:32.530
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>

2761
01:56:32.530 --> 01:56:34.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm dyslexic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things when I read things,</v>

2762
01:56:34.891 --> 01:56:37.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't see it right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a monster man.</v>

2763
01:56:37.531 --> 01:56:42.531
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the big losses for the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 1>because in my opinion is one of the top </v>

2764
01:56:42.531 --> 01:56:46.260
<v Speaker 1>two or 385 pounds in the world at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC had beaten Chris Weidman and then he</v>

2765
01:56:46.261 --> 01:56:51.261
<v Speaker 1>goes over and fights in beltour now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently they just came up with </v>

2766
01:56:51.261 --> 01:56:56.091
<v Speaker 1>some large cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to get big names over </v>

2767
01:56:56.091 --> 01:56:56.091
<v Speaker 1>there either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2768
01:56:56.091 --> 01:56:59.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about UFC is no </v>

2769
01:56:59.740 --> 01:56:59.790
<v Speaker 1>hammer me about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like do tours really cool.</v>

2770
01:56:59.791 --> 01:57:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Just being down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like Chael Sonnen,</v>

2771
01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:05.250
<v Speaker 1>rampage Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fifty cent was there.</v>

2772
01:57:05.251 --> 01:57:06.330
<v Speaker 1>It was like a really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2773
01:57:06.331 --> 01:57:06.930
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2774
01:57:07.410 --> 01:57:10.830
<v Speaker 1>if you're a passer by failure of mma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're like,</v>

2775
01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:12.090
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck up.</v>

2776
01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:14.880
<v Speaker 1>They're doing really good fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have big.</v>

2777
01:57:15.030 --> 01:57:18.840
<v Speaker 1>They have big talent there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they have Michael Chandler who's one</v>

2778
01:57:18.841 --> 01:57:22.830
<v Speaker 1>of the top light weights in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rory Macdonald is one of the best,</v>

2779
01:57:22.831 --> 01:57:24.540
<v Speaker 1>if not the best welterweight in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

2780
01:57:24.541 --> 01:57:26.760
<v Speaker 1>He's definitely top two or three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's beaten.</v>

2781
01:57:26.761 --> 01:57:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Tyron Woodley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the UFC champion,</v>

2782
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:31.440
<v Speaker 1>who I think is the best rory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They snagged over them right?</v>

2783
01:57:31.441 --> 01:57:34.040
<v Speaker 1>They snagged him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have underlay.</v>

2784
01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Silva is that habit vandelays way past </v>
<v Speaker 1>his prime and so his rampage,</v>

<v Speaker 1>they're doing the legends tour and </v>

2787
01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:46.010
<v Speaker 1>rampage just knocked out family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but vandelay doesn't look good anymore </v>

2788
01:57:46.010 --> 01:57:48.330
<v Speaker 1>and they should let them choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let them choose.</v>

2789
01:57:49.820 --> 01:57:52.530
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing a great job.</v>

2790
01:57:53.010 --> 01:57:54.510
<v Speaker 1>They're doing a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really,</v>

2791
01:57:54.690 --> 01:57:59.690
<v Speaker 1>they're promoting these fights well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're putting on and the welterweight </v>

2792
01:57:59.690 --> 01:58:03.771
<v Speaker 1>division they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Douglas Lema was one of the best in </v>

2793
01:58:03.771 --> 01:58:03.771
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

2794
01:58:03.771 --> 01:58:05.370
<v Speaker 1>They have a Paul Daley who can knock out</v>
<v Speaker 1>any living human being.</v>

2795
01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:09.600
<v Speaker 1>They have Lorenz Larkin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty cent was given away a cash prize.</v>

2796
01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:11.790
<v Speaker 1>Hazers Trey Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got into the steam room.</v>

2797
01:58:11.791 --> 01:58:14.760

<v Speaker 1>What does it has to award Bella tour?</v>

2798
01:58:14.761 --> 01:58:17.370
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welterweight Grand Prize winner.</v>

2799
01:58:17.371 --> 01:58:19.920
<v Speaker 1>A million dollar cash prize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he just go bankrupt?</v>

2800
01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:24.780
<v Speaker 1>50 of this part of a deal he had with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the get the strap brand,</v>

2801
01:58:24.781 --> 01:58:26.820
<v Speaker 1>which I guess he owned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>owned and sold.</v>

2802
01:58:26.821 --> 01:58:28.900
<v Speaker 1>And part of that money is going into </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2803
01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:32.490
<v Speaker 1>A million dollars goes to give the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person a million dollar cash prize.</v>

2804
01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:35.400
<v Speaker 1>So the welterweight grand prixs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had koresh cough,</v>

2805
01:58:35.401 --> 01:58:38.550
<v Speaker 1>just fought Lima.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those two guys are excellent to Koresh.</v>

2806
01:58:38.560 --> 01:58:41.650
<v Speaker 1>Cough is another top 10 guy in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2807
01:58:41.651 --> 01:58:44.500
<v Speaker 1>And he's fighting for Bella to Lima,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat him.</v>

2808
01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Lima and rory had a great fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rory beat Lima by decision.</v>

2809
01:58:50.110 --> 01:58:52.090
<v Speaker 1>So there's Rory Douglas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lema,</v>

2810
01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:54.510
<v Speaker 1>Paul Daley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and still to this day like Paul Dale,</v>

2812
01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:58.980
<v Speaker 1>He's so fucking dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A puncher I'll just do is.</v>

2813
01:58:59.170 --> 01:59:01.480

<v Speaker 1>nuclear missile.</v>

2814
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:04.330

<v Speaker 4>And we're doing.</v>

3100
02:10:59.220 --> 02:11:00.940
<v Speaker 12>You do not have consent to use my voice.</v>

3101
02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.120
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about the bet.</v>

3102
02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:08.310
<v Speaker 4>Here's what we're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3103
02:11:08.610 --> 02:11:11.340
<v Speaker 4>So with these mind zone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fitness trackers,</v>

3104
02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:16.970
<v Speaker 4>a joe did 200 today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's planning on doing two days.</v>

3105
02:11:16.980 --> 02:11:19.080
<v Speaker 4>So we're thinking the person who gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>the most,</v>

3106
02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:22.920
<v Speaker 4>most calories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most points burnt in a week.</v>

3107
02:11:22.970 --> 02:11:25.470
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have to pay for anything out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of this challenge.</v>

3108
02:11:25.471 --> 02:11:25.730
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3109
02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:27.120
<v Speaker 12>Running away from</v>

02:11:27.570 --> 02:11:29.640
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3112
02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:36.510
<v Speaker 4>So the bet is we're going to go away </v>
<v Speaker 4>from.</v>

3113
02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:40.710
<v Speaker 4>We're fighting.</v>

3450
02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:56.300

<v Speaker 4>I don't care about begging for money.</v>

3452
02:26:58.490 --> 02:27:00.410
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he finds it enticing.</v>

3453
02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:01.920
<v Speaker 11>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3456
02:27:06.070 --> 02:27:11.070

<v Speaker 4>We'll figure the tiered structure will </v>

3457
02:27:11.070 --> 02:27:11.590
<v Speaker 4>make it to the second place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't play as much as third place.</v>

3458
02:27:11.591 --> 02:27:12.260
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't pay as much.</v>

3459
02:27:12.310 --> 02:27:15.020
<v Speaker 11>Fortunately the way we can be joe rogan </v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm definitely going to that by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just made eye contact with me and I </v>

<v Speaker 4>Other people should know?</v>

3560

<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

3562
02:31:48.390 --> 02:31:51.370
<v Speaker 4>I thought it kind of is going to be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be really going to be a </v>

3563
02:31:52.961 --> 02:31:54.670
<v Speaker 4>good one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how much weight we are going to</v>

3564
02:31:54.671 --> 02:31:55.000
<v Speaker 4>lose.</v>

<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to get down below one </v>
<v Speaker 1>90,</v>

3567
02:31:59.890 --> 02:32:04.890
<v Speaker 4>do body measurements because I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like I did chest across the </v>

3568
02:32:04.890 --> 02:32:05.170
<v Speaker 4>nipples,</v>
<v Speaker 4>belly across the belly button,</v>

3569
02:32:05.260 --> 02:32:08.470
<v Speaker 4>waste and then biceps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>calves and thighs.</v>

3570
02:32:09.250 --> 02:32:10.930
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you all my exact measurements </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

3571
02:32:10.931 --> 02:32:12.520
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think it was accurate.</v>

3572
02:32:12.521 --> 02:32:16.510
<v Speaker 4>My blood pressure today was my doctor </v>
<v Speaker 4>calling about my blood pressure today to</v>

3573
02:32:16.511 --> 02:32:19.840
<v Speaker 4>figure out jesus will know because when </v>
<v Speaker 4>I do sober october go so low.</v>

3574
02:32:20.380 --> 02:32:21.650
<v Speaker 4>Is that bad?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3575
02:32:21.670 --> 02:32:22.810
<v Speaker 4>it's good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm on medication.</v>

3576
02:32:22.811 --> 02:32:25.570
<v Speaker 4>He wants to kind of watch my medication </v>
<v Speaker 4>so that if I.</v>

3577
02:32:25.650 --> 02:32:29.650
<v Speaker 4>What do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Losartan and a or some another thing.</v>

3578
02:32:29.770 --> 02:32:33.380
<v Speaker 4>Jesus on that shit because I have high </v>
<v Speaker 4>blood pressure.</v>

3579
02:32:33.820 --> 02:32:35.740
<v Speaker 4>one 2,995.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it today,</v>

3580
02:32:35.990 --> 02:32:37.850
<v Speaker 1>but is that a natural thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have?</v>

3581
02:32:37.851 --> 02:32:39.260
<v Speaker 1>High blood pressure is because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking.</v>

3582
02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:45.000
<v Speaker 4>I think it's probably lifestyle induced </v>
<v Speaker 4>and things from being overweight and </v>

3583
02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.610
<v Speaker 4>probably from drinking but some bad </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing yet.</v>

3584
02:32:47.640 --> 02:32:49.020
<v Speaker 4>But they got you on pills?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3585
02:32:49.260 --> 02:32:50.560
<v Speaker 4>but I not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have.</v>

3586
02:32:50.600 --> 02:32:55.600
<v Speaker 4>It's better than a stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I think me being proactive and </v>

3587
02:32:55.600 --> 02:32:59.311
<v Speaker 4>getting encino cardiologist these past </v>
<v Speaker 4>five years has been the best thing that </v>

3588
02:32:59.311 --> 02:33:03.871
<v Speaker 4>ever happened to me because there are </v>
<v Speaker 4>significant side effects to a lot of </v>

3589
02:33:03.871 --> 02:33:04.150
<v Speaker 4>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

3590
02:33:04.210 --> 02:33:05.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You gotta look into that stuff.</v>

3591
02:33:05.771 --> 02:33:07.190
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to get off the pills all </v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

<v Speaker 4>but I'd like to get below two.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You can do that.</v>

3599
02:33:24.620 --> 02:33:27.410
<v Speaker 1>You think about what fighters do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about my friend cam hanes,</v>

3600
02:33:27.411 --> 02:33:30.230
<v Speaker 1>when he was getting down to run 240 </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles,</v>

3601
02:33:30.290 --> 02:33:33.860
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to get down to 169 or below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know what he did?</v>

3602
02:33:34.340 --> 02:33:36.980
<v Speaker 1>He ate 2000 calories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>burned off three.</v>

3603
02:33:37.580 --> 02:33:42.580
<v Speaker 1>Just kept doing it every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Send 10 people say they can't lose </v>

3604

<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>

3606
02:33:42.580 --> 02:33:47.410
<v Speaker 1>You just got to be willing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that actually lose weight </v>

3607
02:33:47.410 --> 02:33:47.410
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

3608
02:33:47.410 --> 02:33:48.270
<v Speaker 4>If you're hungry all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>losing weight,</v>

3609
02:33:48.271 --> 02:33:49.480
<v Speaker 4>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>

3610
02:33:50.930 --> 02:33:55.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't have what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How I lose weight is not the healthy </v>

3611
02:33:55.930 --> 02:33:55.930
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You crash.</v>

3612
02:33:55.930 --> 02:33:56.790
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck it.</v>

3613
02:33:56.791 --> 02:33:58.380
<v Speaker 4>Let's drop calories below a thousand.</v>

3614
02:33:58.510 --> 02:33:59.470
<v Speaker 1>RIght?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

3615
02:33:59.660 --> 02:34:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Can't do that because we actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed this on a podcast very </v>

3616
02:34:04.660 --> 02:34:08.281
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is your metabolism crashes </v>

3617
02:34:08.281 --> 02:34:10.741
<v Speaker 1>as well and your body goes into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>famine mode and he wants to protect </v>

3618
02:34:10.741 --> 02:34:10.900
<v Speaker 1>calories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anything you do eat,</v>

3619
02:34:10.901 --> 02:34:14.830
<v Speaker 1>you gain back much quicker and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>far more difficult for you to lose again</v>

3620
02:34:14.831 --> 02:34:19.831
<v Speaker 1>because your body has a mechanism in </v>
<v Speaker 1>place to protect because your body </v>

3621
02:34:19.831 --> 02:34:19.831
<v Speaker 1>thinks it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3622
02:34:19.831 --> 02:34:22.720
<v Speaker 1>we have to hold onto these calories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It slows You down.</v>

3623
02:34:22.780 --> 02:34:25.420
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking like one of the guys,</v>

3624
02:34:25.421 --> 02:34:27.000
<v Speaker 1>layne norton who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3625
02:34:27.160 --> 02:34:31.600
<v Speaker 1>he was involved in bodybuilding and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was saying that his blinking was slower.</v>

3626
02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:35.320
<v Speaker 1>He was blinking slower because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>shredding.</v>

3627
02:34:35.350 --> 02:34:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Getting down to like low body weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3628
02:34:38.790 --> 02:34:43.790
<v Speaker 1>His metabolism crashed so hard that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was literally blinking and thinking </v>

3629
02:34:43.790 --> 02:34:45.580
<v Speaker 1>slower and thinking is for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For comics,</v>

3630
02:34:45.670 --> 02:34:50.670
<v Speaker 1>terrible to be thinking slower when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on stage as the last thing you </v>

3631
02:34:50.670 --> 02:34:50.670
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3632
02:34:51.230 --> 02:34:54.220
<v Speaker 1>if you just work out like a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>maniac and eat healthy,</v>

3633
02:34:54.310 --> 02:34:59.310
<v Speaker 1>just cut out the sugar and the fat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the bullshit your body will slim </v>

3634
02:34:59.310 --> 02:34:59.310
<v Speaker 1>down was just going to go clean.</v>

3635
02:34:59.310 --> 02:35:02.470
<v Speaker 1>I heard of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a nutritionist talk me through how</v>

3636
02:35:02.471 --> 02:35:03.990
<v Speaker 1>they eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they say.</v>

3637
02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the thing that.</v>

3638
02:35:05.290 --> 02:35:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing I always had a problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

3639
02:35:06.820 --> 02:35:08.290
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to eat before you work out.</v>

3640
02:35:08.291 --> 02:35:13.291
<v Speaker 1>You need a little bit about meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you need some energy for your </v>

3641
02:35:13.291 --> 02:35:16.471
<v Speaker 1>workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't necessarily have fast cardio </v>

3642
02:35:16.471 --> 02:35:16.471
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

3643
02:35:16.471 --> 02:35:17.230
<v Speaker 1>well that's what I've been doing the 16 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour fast.</v>

3644
02:35:17.260 --> 02:35:22.260
<v Speaker 1>She might be old school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if there's a lot of people that are </v>

3645
02:35:22.260 --> 02:35:24.460
<v Speaker 1>nutrition and the science behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletic performance has changed so much</v>

3646
02:35:24.730 --> 02:35:26.260
<v Speaker 1>over the last five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 Years.</v>

3647
02:35:26.830 --> 02:35:27.760
<v Speaker 1>This not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3648
02:35:27.910 --> 02:35:31.570
<v Speaker 1>just talking to some random nutritionist</v>
<v Speaker 1>might not be the best person to talk to.</v>

3649
02:35:31.660 --> 02:35:33.280
<v Speaker 1>They might not be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3650
02:35:33.281 --> 02:35:34.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say because I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

3651
02:35:35.080 --> 02:35:36.460
<v Speaker 1>but she might not be on the ball.</v>

3652
02:35:36.610 --> 02:35:37.050
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3653
02:35:37.051 --> 02:35:39.550
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I had so much information.</v>

3654
02:35:39.551 --> 02:35:41.350
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you listen to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

3655
02:35:41.680 --> 02:35:43.720
<v Speaker 1>you get so much information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zach bitters,</v>

3656
02:35:43.721 --> 02:35:48.721
<v Speaker 1>like you got to go fatty meats and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then and then you hear Jordan </v>

3657
02:35:48.721 --> 02:35:51.700
<v Speaker 1>peterson's daughter saying that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people and then you go,</v>

3658
02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:53.560
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very specific situation.</v>

3659
02:35:53.561 --> 02:35:56.570
<v Speaker 1>She hAs severe autoimmune immune issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>severe.</v>

3660
02:35:57.400 --> 02:36:02.400
<v Speaker 1>She's most likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to other nutritionist that </v>

3661
02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:05.401
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's probably got some gut bacteria </v>

3662
02:36:05.401 --> 02:36:06.670
<v Speaker 1>issue that she needs to get her gut </v>
<v Speaker 1>biome sorted out.</v>

3663
02:36:07.650 --> 02:36:10.450
<v Speaker 1>It's all so above my pay grade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite honestly.</v>

3664
02:36:10.451 --> 02:36:14.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean I get interested in this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I talk about and there's some things</v>

3665
02:36:14.051 --> 02:36:15.670
<v Speaker 1>that I could say with certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainty,</v>

3666
02:36:15.671 --> 02:36:19.870
<v Speaker 1>but not really what you should and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't do in terms of each individual</v>

3667
02:36:19.871 --> 02:36:22.870
<v Speaker 1>person in their diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say if I was you,</v>

3668
02:36:23.050 --> 02:36:28.050
<v Speaker 1>what I would get down to is I would say </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely start eating a lot of </v>

3669
02:36:28.050 --> 02:36:28.050
<v Speaker 1>vegetables.</v>

3670
02:36:28.050 --> 02:36:29.110
<v Speaker 1>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much universal.</v>

3671
02:36:29.170 --> 02:36:31.570
<v Speaker 1>Everybody agrees except these crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>carnivore people,</v>

3672
02:36:31.571 --> 02:36:36.571
<v Speaker 1>but I think their situation is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>either an elimination diet or a calorie </v>

3673
02:36:36.571 --> 02:36:40.831
<v Speaker 1>restricted diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not really the best for </v>

3674
02:36:40.831 --> 02:36:43.321
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think for the kind of shit </v>

3675
02:36:43.321 --> 02:36:43.321
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3676
02:36:43.321 --> 02:36:44.320
<v Speaker 1>I think broccoli,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kale,</v>

3677
02:36:44.350 --> 02:36:45.640
<v Speaker 1>spinach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff,</v>

3678
02:36:45.650 --> 02:36:47.740
<v Speaker 1>sauteed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff's fantastic for you.</v>

3679
02:36:47.770 --> 02:36:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Then on top of that mean obviously I eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>red meat.</v>

3680
02:36:50.950 --> 02:36:55.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of red meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you should eat just like very </v>

3681
02:36:55.950 --> 02:36:59.701
<v Speaker 1>nutrient dense meet and I think you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should take multivitamins just to cover </v>

3682
02:36:59.741 --> 02:37:01.240
<v Speaker 1>all your bases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3683
02:37:01.241 --> 02:37:06.241
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of like really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>green supplements that you can add to </v>

3684
02:37:06.241 --> 02:37:09.901
<v Speaker 1>water or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little packets you could take out your </v>

3685
02:37:09.901 --> 02:37:09.901
<v Speaker 1>calories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3686
02:37:09.901 --> 02:37:10.660
<v Speaker 1>So you just eat until you're full.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3687
02:37:11.260 --> 02:37:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3688
02:37:12.100 --> 02:37:13.460

<v Speaker 1>a day?</v>

3689
02:37:13.750 --> 02:37:16.510
<v Speaker 1>I really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had to guess what's elc?</v>

3690
02:37:16.550 --> 02:37:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Elc is pretty lean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3691
02:37:17.831 --> 02:37:21.200
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty lean and you looks like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're eating maybe eight ounces elk.</v>

3692
02:37:22.180 --> 02:37:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I probably eat a pound of that a day for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

3751
02:39:55.820 --> 02:39:57.860
<v Speaker 1>And lifting weights will also add to </v>

<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

3769
02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:45.800
<v Speaker 4>was a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I was working on,</v>

3770
02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:45.800
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

3771
02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:49.161
<v Speaker 4>this is a very.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you looking at the numbers on that </v>

3772
02:40:49.161 --> 02:40:49.161
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very motivational.</v>

3773
02:40:49.161 --> 02:40:50.460
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's funny,</v>

3774
02:40:50.490 --> 02:40:53.220
<v Speaker 4>when before when I was in college,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I ran and what was really fun,</v>

3775
02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:58.400
<v Speaker 4>the stuff these rudders journals is to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get done your run and write them in </v>

3776
02:40:58.400 --> 02:40:58.950
<v Speaker 4>tracking your fitness.</v>

3777
02:40:58.950 --> 02:41:03.950
<v Speaker 4>Tracking your workout is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really fun to look at numbers and </v>

3778
02:41:03.950 --> 02:41:05.160
<v Speaker 4>stack up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like it feels like some,</v>

3779
02:41:05.190 --> 02:41:09.150
<v Speaker 4>like almost like a hoarder's vibe or </v>
<v Speaker 4>like an ocd vibe.</v>

3780
02:41:09.360 --> 02:41:10.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's definitely better.</v>

3781
02:41:10.531 --> 02:41:13.710
<v Speaker 4>Like when it's on this app than it is if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just know you're worked out.</v>

3782
02:41:14.120 --> 02:41:15.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to.</v>

3783
02:41:15.271 --> 02:41:17.400
<v Speaker 4>When I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when fitbit first came out,</v>

3784
02:41:17.401 --> 02:41:19.620
<v Speaker 4>I used to get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to get to 12,000</v>

3785
02:41:19.621 --> 02:41:22.470
<v Speaker 4>steps every day and I would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would land from a flight,</v>

3786
02:41:22.471 --> 02:41:27.471
<v Speaker 4>get up to my hotel room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>open a bottle of wine and just start </v>

3787
02:41:27.471 --> 02:41:28.650
<v Speaker 4>dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking weird as fuck.</v>

3788
02:41:29.370 --> 02:41:31.240
<v Speaker 4>Like if someone came and complained,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3789
02:41:31.250 --> 02:41:32.950
<v Speaker 4>they would think I was on meth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3790
02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:34.050
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it feels good.</v>

3791
02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:37.350
<v Speaker 4>It feels good to set goals I might have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I always tell people like one of the</v>

3792
02:41:37.380 --> 02:41:40.020
<v Speaker 4>best ways to get things done is to write</v>
<v Speaker 4>things down.</v>

3793
02:41:40.220 --> 02:41:42.450
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's such a huge motivating factor.</v>

3794
02:41:42.451 --> 02:41:45.780
<v Speaker 4>Like you have a list of shit that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to do today and check those bitches</v>

3795
02:41:45.781 --> 02:41:48.660
<v Speaker 4>off and then at the end of the day you </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel good.</v>

3796
02:41:48.750 --> 02:41:50.160
<v Speaker 4>Like you go to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you feel good.</v>

3797
02:41:50.161 --> 02:41:52.080
<v Speaker 4>I checked off all those things on my </v>
<v Speaker 4>list.</v>

3798
02:41:52.081 --> 02:41:54.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm better now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel better than I was before.</v>

3799
02:41:54.270 --> 02:41:56.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My wife's a big list maker.</v>

3800
02:41:56.560 --> 02:41:58.020
<v Speaker 4>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you make a list,</v>

3801
02:41:58.021 --> 02:42:01.680
<v Speaker 4>it really does organize your day like I </v>
<v Speaker 4>will when I was shooting,</v>

3802
02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:06.800
<v Speaker 4>shooting the promo thing for my tour </v>
<v Speaker 4>next week and I shot at this weekend in </v>

3803
02:42:06.800 --> 02:42:08.580
<v Speaker 4>san jose and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

3804
02:42:08.670 --> 02:42:11.040
<v Speaker 4>I had all these different things I </v>
<v Speaker 4>needed to do and my wife's like,</v>

3805
02:42:11.041 --> 02:42:12.360
<v Speaker 4>make a fucking list.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I went,</v>

3806
02:42:12.420 --> 02:42:13.390
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3807
02:42:13.470 --> 02:42:18.470
<v Speaker 4>So I wrote down all the shots I needed </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I'd feel like I didn't feel like I </v>

3808
02:42:18.470 --> 02:42:18.890
<v Speaker 4>didn't get the night before and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>just banged it out and I was like,</v>

3809
02:42:18.891 --> 02:42:20.280
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was fucking easy as shit.</v>

3810
02:42:20.370 --> 02:42:25.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so much better than like trying to </v>

3811
02:42:25.370 --> 02:42:25.370
<v Speaker 4>remember what else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what else do I need to do?</v>

3812
02:42:25.370 --> 02:42:27.810
<v Speaker 4>And then like half ass in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You knoW what you did.</v>

3813
02:42:27.811 --> 02:42:32.811
<v Speaker 4>That's very impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You came up with a new hour pretty </v>

3814
02:42:32.811 --> 02:42:32.940
<v Speaker 4>fucking quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how long did it take you to come up</v>

3815
02:42:32.941 --> 02:42:34.310
<v Speaker 4>with a new hour?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3816
02:42:34.311 --> 02:42:35.130
<v Speaker 4>I came up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

3817
02:42:35.610 --> 02:42:37.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe like a february,</v>

3818
02:42:38.850 --> 02:42:39.810
<v Speaker 4>march,</v>
<v Speaker 4>april,</v>

3819
02:42:39.811 --> 02:42:40.890
<v Speaker 4>may,</v>
<v Speaker 4>june,</v>

3820
02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:45.660
<v Speaker 4>six months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did you do to ramp up your writing?</v>

3821
02:42:45.750 --> 02:42:49.050
<v Speaker 4>A super aware.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my biggest thing for me,</v>

3822
02:42:49.051 --> 02:42:50.330
<v Speaker 4>which I think helped me back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've,</v>

3823
02:42:51.030 --> 02:42:53.190
<v Speaker 4>I've talked about this a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe a lot,</v>

3824
02:42:53.191 --> 02:42:57.030
<v Speaker 4>but when you were in production brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you didn't have room for comedy brain.</v>

3825
02:42:57.210 --> 02:43:02.210
<v Speaker 4>Like when I was making a tv show I never</v>
<v Speaker 4>did another room for comedy and so I </v>

3826
02:43:02.210 --> 02:43:03.690
<v Speaker 4>might be obsessed with football so there</v>
<v Speaker 4>might be something wrong with me,</v>

3827
02:43:03.691 --> 02:43:06.000
<v Speaker 4>but when I'm in comedy brain and which </v>
<v Speaker 4>is when I'm.</v>

3828
02:43:06.240 --> 02:43:09.390
<v Speaker 4>When I'm doing a special,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's focused on only that material,</v>

3829
02:43:09.420 --> 02:43:14.420
<v Speaker 4>like only the material.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when I docked on the special I just </v>

3830
02:43:14.420 --> 02:43:14.550
<v Speaker 4>went up and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

3831
02:43:14.700 --> 02:43:16.860
<v Speaker 4>It was the most enjoyable time in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

3832
02:43:16.861 --> 02:43:19.030
<v Speaker 4>It's like everything was a bit just </v>
<v Speaker 4>walking around.</v>

3833
02:43:19.031 --> 02:43:24.031
<v Speaker 4>I was looking for things and just being </v>
<v Speaker 4>inspired by the littlest thing even to </v>

3834
02:43:24.031 --> 02:43:25.190
<v Speaker 4>this day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's part of the reason I like to go</v>

3835
02:43:25.191 --> 02:43:27.130
<v Speaker 4>over to New York and do podcasts and </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck around.</v>

3836
02:43:27.430 --> 02:43:32.430
<v Speaker 4>I was on anthony humanist podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I came up with two bits in the moment </v>

3837
02:43:32.430 --> 02:43:32.430
<v Speaker 4>that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do those,</v>

3838
02:43:32.430 --> 02:43:36.940
<v Speaker 4>those are going to new environment and </v>
<v Speaker 4>new feeling your brain firing and done.</v>

3839
02:43:36.941 --> 02:43:41.941
<v Speaker 4>Not denying myself the opportunity of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit because a bit is silly or goofy or </v>

3840
02:43:41.941 --> 02:43:42.790
<v Speaker 4>hacky in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

3841
02:43:42.791 --> 02:43:44.800
<v Speaker 4>that's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's keep working that.</v>

3842
02:43:45.370 --> 02:43:46.330
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3843
02:43:46.331 --> 02:43:50.260
<v Speaker 4>I have right now I have like 55 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I'm,</v>

3844
02:43:50.500 --> 02:43:55.500
<v Speaker 4>that I feel is really solid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the goal now sort of like we were </v>

3845
02:43:55.500 --> 02:43:57.850
<v Speaker 4>talking to tom was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>untangling it is like weaving it in.</v>

3846
02:43:57.850 --> 02:44:02.850
<v Speaker 4>So that one that follows the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So right now I'm playing with these </v>

3847
02:44:02.850 --> 02:44:02.850
<v Speaker 4>bits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>putting them in different places,</v>

3848
02:44:02.860 --> 02:44:05.800
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure out what could follow a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit.</v>

3849
02:44:05.830 --> 02:44:08.260
<v Speaker 4>That's the funnest part also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3850
02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:10.840
<v Speaker 4>And then once I do that and once I have </v>
<v Speaker 4>no what I'm doing,</v>

3851
02:44:10.841 --> 02:44:15.841
<v Speaker 4>my next vessel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what it almost becomes less fun </v>

3852
02:44:15.841 --> 02:44:18.751
<v Speaker 4>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I don't want to go to the </v>

3853
02:44:18.751 --> 02:44:18.751
<v Speaker 4>store because I don't want to write new </v>
<v Speaker 4>bits,</v>

3854
02:44:18.751 --> 02:44:21.220
<v Speaker 4>but like in this salad days or when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just all writing,</v>

3855
02:44:21.460 --> 02:44:26.460
<v Speaker 4>I loved that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just going up on stage and going in la </v>

3856
02:44:26.460 --> 02:44:29.371
<v Speaker 4>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bought a gun and just go and just </v>

3857
02:44:29.371 --> 02:44:29.371
<v Speaker 4>feeling the energy and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3858
02:44:29.371 --> 02:44:29.371
<v Speaker 4>I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in it.</v>

3859
02:44:29.371 --> 02:44:31.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't know where this is going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could lose them.</v>

3860
02:44:31.640 --> 02:44:32.100
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3861
02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:33.430
<v Speaker 4>So I wouldn't buy numbing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>joking.</v>

3862
02:44:33.431 --> 02:44:37.210
<v Speaker 4>I went and bought a gun because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought it wouldn't be a good bit when I</v>

3863
02:44:37.211 --> 02:44:39.490
<v Speaker 4>went and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you say that on stage?</v>

3864
02:44:39.500 --> 02:44:40.350
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yoU should,</v>

3865
02:44:40.390 --> 02:44:42.340
<v Speaker 4>but that should be part of the bet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you serious?</v>

3866
02:44:42.341 --> 02:44:43.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3868
02:44:45.501 --> 02:44:50.501
<v Speaker 4>be a good bet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was driving out in burbank and I was </v>

<v Speaker 4>that makes it seem like there's </v>

3881
02:45:12.571 --> 02:45:12.571
<v Speaker 4>something wrong that you're pointing it </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

3882

3883
02:45:13.530 --> 02:45:15.070
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in that culture you have to bring it</v>

3884
02:45:15.071 --> 02:45:17.410
<v Speaker 4>up in that culture that is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting that they.</v>

3885
02:45:17.590 --> 02:45:22.590
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like when he had a mr mike on </v>

3886
02:45:22.590 --> 02:45:22.990
<v Speaker 4>magic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mike,</v>

<v Speaker 4>not magic mike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Killer killer mike on.</v>

3888
02:45:25.570 --> 02:45:28.120
<v Speaker 4>It was really cool to hear this through </v>
<v Speaker 4>mike magic.</v>

3889
02:45:28.121 --> 02:45:30.430
<v Speaker 4>Mike was here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're white guy.</v>

3890
02:45:30.431 --> 02:45:33.550
<v Speaker 4>Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was cool to hear their perspective on</v>

3891
02:45:33.551 --> 02:45:33.970
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3892
02:45:33.971 --> 02:45:35.640
<v Speaker 4>Because culturally you always see a </v>
<v Speaker 4>company,</v>

3893
02:45:35.660 --> 02:45:38.560
<v Speaker 4>the nra come from this like whIte </v>
<v Speaker 4>redneck thing.</v>

3894
02:45:39.580 --> 02:45:40.450
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's.</v>

3895
02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:41.170
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3896
02:45:41.171 --> 02:45:42.820
<v Speaker 4>he makes real good points.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3897
02:45:42.821 --> 02:45:44.440
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a lawyer.</v>

3898
02:45:44.441 --> 02:45:46.870
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure it was like he was.</v>

3899
02:45:46.871 --> 02:45:49.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he makes really good points in terms</v>

3900
02:45:49.331 --> 02:45:51.790
<v Speaker 4>of like a personal safety and </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibility.</v>

3901
02:45:52.120 --> 02:45:57.120
<v Speaker 4>The thing about like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people equate nra with mass shootings </v>

3902
02:45:57.120 --> 02:45:58.480
<v Speaker 4>and all kinds of other crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is not really totally fair because</v>

3903
02:45:58.481 --> 02:46:00.970
<v Speaker 4>no nra member has ever committed a mass </v>
<v Speaker 4>shooting.</v>

3904
02:46:01.420 --> 02:46:02.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whenever something happens,</v>

3905
02:46:02.831 --> 02:46:03.460
<v Speaker 4>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3906
02:46:03.461 --> 02:46:08.461
<v Speaker 4>this is all because these people want </v>
<v Speaker 4>the other people that have access to </v>

3907
02:46:08.461 --> 02:46:08.740
<v Speaker 4>these kinds of guns.</v>

3908
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:13.220
<v Speaker 1>The real connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as always an ad nauseum.</v>

3909
02:46:13.221 --> 02:46:16.010
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about this too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is psychotropic drugs.</v>

3910
02:46:16.011 --> 02:46:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Those people are almost all on some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of psych medicine.</v>

3911
02:46:18.770 --> 02:46:19.530
<v Speaker 1>All of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3912
02:46:19.830 --> 02:46:22.970
<v Speaker 1>The is a ca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it causation or correlation?</v>

3913
02:46:22.971 --> 02:46:27.971
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the psychotropic drugs cause causing </v>

3914
02:46:27.971 --> 02:46:30.020
<v Speaker 1>them to do this or are they on </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotropic drugs because they're crazy</v>

3915
02:46:30.021 --> 02:46:33.110
<v Speaker 1>and they shouldn't haVe a gun anyway and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be more difficult.</v>

3916
02:46:33.111 --> 02:46:38.111
<v Speaker 1>I'm I'm 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in believed that you should test </v>

3917
02:46:38.111 --> 02:46:42.161
<v Speaker 1>people and that there should be some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of standards in terms of mental </v>

3918
02:46:42.161 --> 02:46:44.490
<v Speaker 1>health in terms of Whether or not you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>committed assault,</v>

3919
02:46:44.540 --> 02:46:45.890
<v Speaker 1>whether or not like those kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

3920
02:46:46.250 --> 02:46:48.380
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you have a history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental illness,</v>

3921
02:46:48.381 --> 02:46:51.500
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you have a history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>lashing out or violent outbursts.</v>

3922
02:46:51.501 --> 02:46:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those kind of people shouldn't have guns</v>

3923
02:46:53.390 --> 02:46:55.880
<v Speaker 1>that the kind of people that think </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody shouLd have access to a gun,</v>

3924
02:46:55.881 --> 02:46:59.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a little irresponsible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the kind of people that think no one</v>

3925
02:46:59.900 --> 02:47:04.900
<v Speaker 1>should have a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's irresponsible to scratch </v>

3926
02:47:04.900 --> 02:47:04.900
<v Speaker 1>crazy talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3927
02:47:04.900 --> 02:47:05.790
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to happen in our country.</v>

<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4007
02:50:01.601 --> 02:50:06.601

<v Speaker 4>it's different cause you're letting it </v>

4008
02:50:06.601 --> 02:50:06.601
<v Speaker 4>be different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4009
02:50:06.601 --> 02:50:08.020
<v Speaker 4>it depends on how close you are with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy because if you're really good</v>

4010
02:50:08.140 --> 02:50:13.140
<v Speaker 1>close with the guy and he's saying funny</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and you think they're funny and </v>

<v Speaker 1>It's just hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

4014
02:50:19.511 --> 02:50:24.511
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone knows that we're all </v>

4015
02:50:24.511 --> 02:50:24.550
<v Speaker 1>close friends and that's our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's our language.</v>

4016
02:50:24.551 --> 02:50:27.880
<v Speaker 1>But there are people who are not your </v>
<v Speaker 1>close friends who was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and then they'll start fucking with you.</v>

4019
02:50:30.881 --> 02:50:32.920
<v Speaker 1>And nick gets a little slippery and </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow.</v>

<v Speaker 4>there's uh,</v>

4022
02:50:34.821 --> 02:50:37.010
<v Speaker 4>it's narcissism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's guys who Built it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>when you're young and you're hungry in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this business and you want to succeed,</v>

4027
02:50:48.270 --> 02:50:53.270

<v Speaker 4>might be able to give you work him and </v>

<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's taught to stand up.</v>

4039
02:51:16.290 --> 02:51:17.540

<v Speaker 4>I'll say this about myself,</v>

4043
02:51:20.351 --> 02:51:21.930

<v Speaker 4>I like to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>weakness.</v>

4046
02:51:24.931 --> 02:51:25.800
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

4047
02:51:25.900 --> 02:51:29.520
<v Speaker 4>there's someone that I'm told you </v>
<v Speaker 4>privately that stole from me,</v>

4048
02:51:29.730 --> 02:51:34.580
<v Speaker 4>that was a friend separate and it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4049
02:51:34.620 --> 02:51:39.620
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that fucking makes me angry because I </v>

4050
02:51:39.620 --> 02:51:41.631
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember when it happened and I had </v>

4051
02:51:41.631 --> 02:51:41.631
<v Speaker 4>already dealt with something else that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was similar to that.</v>

4052
02:51:41.631 --> 02:51:43.290
<v Speaker 4>I remember I was at my wife's lake house</v>
<v Speaker 4>when someone texted me and said,</v>

4053
02:51:43.291 --> 02:51:46.320
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you give that job to that person?</v>

4054
02:51:46.380 --> 02:51:48.810
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no man,</v>

4055
02:51:48.811 --> 02:51:51.390
<v Speaker 4>it pulled this fucking thing in my.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In my head.</v>

4056
02:51:51.391 --> 02:51:53.190
<v Speaker 4>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember thinking,</v>

4057
02:51:53.191 --> 02:51:54.330
<v Speaker 4>did you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think I'm weak?</v>

4058
02:51:54.480 --> 02:51:56.610
<v Speaker 4>Do you think I won't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think?</v>

4059
02:51:56.880 --> 02:51:58.980
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that you can do that to me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4060
02:51:59.400 --> 02:52:00.780
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I didn't say anything.</v>

4061
02:52:00.781 --> 02:52:05.781
<v Speaker 4>I didn't say anything because I learned </v>
<v Speaker 4>the first time around that it really </v>

4062
02:52:05.781 --> 02:52:06.550
<v Speaker 4>almost like all these that come out </v>
<v Speaker 4>about sexual assault.</v>

4063
02:52:06.570 --> 02:52:11.570
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't benefit you to coMe out and </v>

<v Speaker 4>say that someone stole joke from you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just equate still.</v>

4066
02:52:13.300 --> 02:52:14.680
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's coming.</v>

4067
02:52:14.860 --> 02:52:19.860

<v Speaker 4>when you look at these women and said </v>

4071
02:52:21.580 --> 02:52:24.060
<v Speaker 4>There's not a lot of benefit to go and </v>
<v Speaker 4>say you've been raped because now you've</v>

<v Speaker 4>and you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And You've got to defend yourself from </v>

4074
02:52:31.700 --> 02:52:32.480
<v Speaker 4>something you didn't do to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so when you get stolen from them,</v>

4075
02:52:32.770 --> 02:52:34.600
<v Speaker 4>obviously that is a stretch of an </v>
<v Speaker 4>equivalent person.</v>

4076

<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's what I do for a living.</v>

4106
02:53:51.650 --> 02:53:52.090
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

4107
02:53:52.340 --> 02:53:57.340
<v Speaker 4>oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you really don't have any </v>

4108
02:53:57.340 --> 02:53:57.340
<v Speaker 4>material and you don't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>write,</v>

4109
02:53:57.340 --> 02:53:57.340
<v Speaker 4>you don't know how to write new </v>
<v Speaker 4>material.</v>

4110
02:53:57.340 --> 02:53:57.980
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shut the fuck up.</v>

4111
02:53:58.130 --> 02:53:59.820
<v Speaker 4>So that's what you can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4112
02:53:59.930 --> 02:54:00.680
<v Speaker 4>suck a dick.</v>

4113
02:54:02.440 --> 02:54:05.320
<v Speaker 1>There's two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two different types of mindsets.</v>

4114
02:54:05.321 --> 02:54:10.321
<v Speaker 1>The type of mindset where someone like </v>
<v Speaker 1>steals someone else's ideas and tries to</v>

4115
02:54:12.221 --> 02:54:17.221
<v Speaker 1>pass them off as their own is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite mindset as to someone who's</v>

4116
02:54:18.490 --> 02:54:20.290
<v Speaker 1>creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're creative,</v>

4117
02:54:20.291 --> 02:54:25.291
<v Speaker 1>you're thinking about a bit and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not thinking about yourself and how the </v>

4118
02:54:25.291 --> 02:54:28.621
<v Speaker 1>bid is going to work for you and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to kill when you get out </v>

4119
02:54:28.621 --> 02:54:28.621
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're stealing,</v>

4125
02:54:39.970 --> 02:54:44.970
<v Speaker 1>they get addicted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things about people </v>

4126
02:54:44.970 --> 02:54:44.970
<v Speaker 1>that get called out for bits and they </v>

02:54:44.970 --> 02:54:48.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I already did that bit at the </v>

4128
02:54:48.850 --> 02:54:51.151
<v Speaker 1>laugh factory here because they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted to get addicted to the </v>

4129
02:54:51.151 --> 02:54:51.820
<v Speaker 1>reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That bit gets.</v>

02:54:57.360 --> 02:55:00.541
<v Speaker 1>stuff like an I am and the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are trying to be creative.</v>

4132
02:55:01.180 --> 02:55:04.550
<v Speaker 1>What you're trying to do is you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to like summon</v>

4133
02:55:04.550 --> 02:55:09.550
<v Speaker 2>these ideas out of the ether.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to pull them out of the </v>

4134
02:55:09.550 --> 02:55:10.160
<v Speaker 2>air and then once you have them like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4135
02:55:10.161 --> 02:55:11.570
<v Speaker 2>I got it in a bottle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it in a bottle,</v>

4136
02:55:11.571 --> 02:55:13.200
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I've got to add things to it.</v>

4137

<v Speaker 2>I've got to bring it alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta fucking frankenstein and it's </v>

4138
02:55:18.450 --> 02:55:19.220
<v Speaker 2>alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then one day,</v>

4139
02:55:19.221 --> 02:55:24.221
<v Speaker 2>months and months later you trot that </v>
<v Speaker 2>bid out of the improvident fucking </v>

4140
02:55:24.221 --> 02:55:26.360
<v Speaker 2>crushes and that is one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing feelings.</v>

4141
02:55:27.030 --> 02:55:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Like someone like sam tripoli or bill </v>
<v Speaker 2>burke come up and go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>We all love that about each other too.</v>

4146
02:55:37.041 --> 02:55:39.680
<v Speaker 2>I love when someone's got a new bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was that new.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What has that been like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh dude,</v>

<v Speaker 2>midnight.</v>

4149
02:55:44.810 --> 02:55:47.500
<v Speaker 2>I remember watching you run it in the or</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the.</v>

4150
02:55:47.580 --> 02:55:49.640
<v Speaker 2>At its infancy probably like eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>months ago.</v>

4151
02:55:49.820 --> 02:55:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Right when I was getting ready to in </v>
<v Speaker 2>february when I was getting ready to </v>

02:55:54.820 --> 02:55:54.820
<v Speaker 2>tape my special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw you doing yours and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4155
02:55:57.351 --> 02:55:59.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting ready to film and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of months.</v>

4156
02:55:59.101 --> 02:56:00.110
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4157
02:56:00.111 --> 02:56:03.200
<v Speaker 2>like dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the greatest feeling when you sit</v>

4158
02:56:03.201 --> 02:56:05.990
<v Speaker 2>as a comic in the back and you watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>your friends just fucking murderer.</v>

4159
02:56:05.991 --> 02:56:08.210
<v Speaker 2>It's inspires you with shit you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard.</v>

4160
02:56:08.270 --> 02:56:09.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4161
02:56:09.170 --> 02:56:10.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the best.</v>

4162
02:56:10.760 --> 02:56:12.380
<v Speaker 2>But people that still will never get </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

4163
02:56:12.440 --> 02:56:14.990
<v Speaker 2>They will never get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're missing that.</v>

4164
02:56:15.310 --> 02:56:16.850
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sad.</v>

4165
02:56:17.280 --> 02:56:21.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a sad thing because they're always </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have to live this weird lie.</v>

4166
02:56:22.310 --> 02:56:27.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does weird lie of creativity because </v>

4167
02:56:27.310 --> 02:56:30.410
<v Speaker 2>creativity is so slippery and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>be thinking about yourself.</v>

4168
02:56:30.440 --> 02:56:33.290
<v Speaker 2>That's not what it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the opposite about that.</v>

4169
02:56:33.291 --> 02:56:38.291
<v Speaker 2>It's all about the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about how it gets to the </v>

4170
02:56:38.291 --> 02:56:38.480
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about how it works.</v>

4171
02:56:38.481 --> 02:56:41.660
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to like take yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally out of the equation.</v>

4172
02:56:42.170 --> 02:56:44.600
<v Speaker 2>But the people still there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all about them.</v>

4173
02:56:44.900 --> 02:56:47.390
<v Speaker 2>It's all about them getting a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling,</v>

4174
02:56:47.391 --> 02:56:51.270
<v Speaker 2>doing someone else's bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I really think that that is.</v>

4175
02:56:51.320 --> 02:56:55.160
<v Speaker 2>There's this weird balance to the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think when when you do that,</v>

4176
02:56:55.161 --> 02:57:00.161
<v Speaker 2>I think it takes away from your ability </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do the other thing takes away from </v>

4177
02:57:00.161 --> 02:57:03.881
<v Speaker 2>your ability to be creative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would almost argue I'm the exact </v>

4178
02:57:03.881 --> 02:57:06.491
<v Speaker 2>opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it gets up and running and </v>

4179
02:57:06.491 --> 02:57:08.890
<v Speaker 2>murderous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost feel like I'm lying to the </v>

4180
02:57:08.890 --> 02:57:08.890
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm cheating going,</v>

4181
02:57:08.890 --> 02:57:08.930
<v Speaker 2>going like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4182
02:57:08.931 --> 02:57:10.400
<v Speaker 2>it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing it too long.</v>

4183
02:57:10.430 --> 02:57:12.290
<v Speaker 2>I have a hard time doing sets of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>store when I'm.</v>

4184
02:57:12.350 --> 02:57:13.700
<v Speaker 2>When I got my hour ready,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

4185
02:57:13.750 --> 02:57:15.440
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing going there for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to.</v>

4186
02:57:15.450 --> 02:57:20.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm still in a spot from someone who </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't use it and I'm just going up </v>

4187
02:57:20.450 --> 02:57:20.450
<v Speaker 2>with shit that works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4188
02:57:20.450 --> 02:57:20.840
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on bert.</v>

4189
02:57:21.050 --> 02:57:26.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're giving the audience a good </v>

4190
02:57:26.050 --> 02:57:26.050
<v Speaker 2>time and you're keeping everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>sharp.</v>

4191
02:57:26.050 --> 02:57:27.290
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like once a bit is done,</v>

4192
02:57:27.291 --> 02:57:32.000
<v Speaker 2>it's you can't just leave it alone </v>
<v Speaker 2>because like if I had to today go up and</v>

4193
02:57:32.001 --> 02:57:35.840
<v Speaker 2>do my bruce jenner bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be able to do it.</v>

4194
02:57:35.870 --> 02:57:38.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Haven't done it in two years.</v>

4195
02:57:38.300 --> 02:57:42.110
<v Speaker 2>I literally wouldn't be able to do it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my best bits ever and I wouldn't.</v>

4196
02:57:42.170 --> 02:57:43.970
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't know where to start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have to go back,</v>

4197
02:57:44.210 --> 02:57:49.210
<v Speaker 2>listen to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I would have to go do it a </v>

4198
02:57:49.210 --> 02:57:49.210
<v Speaker 2>bunch of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's get it polished.</v>

4199
02:57:49.210 --> 02:57:54.080
<v Speaker 2>It's really fun though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When someone calls out a joke that you </v>

4200
02:57:54.080 --> 02:57:55.070
<v Speaker 2>haven't told in years and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it this past week.</v>

02:59:23.570 --> 02:59:28.570
<v Speaker 1>how people interpret your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you do something and then </v>

<v Speaker 1>people really like it and they take it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they make a clip about it or </v>

4245
02:59:32.800 --> 02:59:33.440
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they add something to it or they.</v>

4246
02:59:33.790 --> 02:59:36.890
<v Speaker 1>One of the weirder things has been the </v>

<v Speaker 2>nine years ago when I first started </v>

03:02:51.550 --> 03:02:56.550
<v Speaker 2>You've changed immeasurably in almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most renaissance way is like you </v>

4323

<v Speaker 2>have conversations with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't know what the fUck they even </v>

4324
03:03:02.281 --> 03:03:05.190

4325
03:03:05.190 --> 03:03:08.101

4326
03:03:08.101 --> 03:03:08.101
<v Speaker 2>and how you put out your ideas.</v>

03:03:08.101 --> 03:03:08.350
<v Speaker 2>you're willing to change.</v>

4328
03:03:08.350 --> 03:03:09.760
<v Speaker 2>I remember when you stopped saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>faggot,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like in conversation.</v>

4331
03:03:14.680 --> 03:03:16.090
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was like,</v>

4332
03:03:16.091 --> 03:03:18.010
<v Speaker 2>that's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'll just stop to.</v>

4333
03:03:18.070 --> 03:03:20.180
<v Speaker 2>We were in the old desk squad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4334

<v Speaker 2>east or west.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4337
03:03:24.580 --> 03:03:29.580
<v Speaker 2>Well the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fun thing to say and you don't </v>

4338
03:03:29.580 --> 03:03:32.911
<v Speaker 2>mean it in a homophobic way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's stills fun to say I still let it </v>

4339
03:03:32.911 --> 03:03:33.130
<v Speaker 2>slip out every now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Age,</v>

4340
03:03:33.131 --> 03:03:35.440
<v Speaker 2>like a fine wine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fun thing to say,</v>

4341
03:03:35.441 --> 03:03:37.660
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is the way it makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people feel.</v>

4342
03:03:37.661 --> 03:03:42.550
<v Speaker 2>It's not fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's language should be about intent.</v>

4343
03:03:42.670 --> 03:03:46.870
<v Speaker 2>It should be about you're conveying your</v>
<v Speaker 2>intent through a sound.</v>

4344
03:03:46.940 --> 03:03:51.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is it's not working </v>

4345
03:03:51.940 --> 03:03:51.940
<v Speaker 2>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if,</v>

4346
03:03:51.940 --> 03:03:55.610
<v Speaker 2>if someone is hearing it on the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>end and it's making them angry and </v>

4347
03:03:55.610 --> 03:03:55.610
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

4348
03:03:55.610 --> 03:03:55.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm being silly about it.</v>

4349
03:03:55.610 --> 03:03:57.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna silly faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're like,</v>

4350
03:03:58.050 --> 03:03:58.500
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4351
03:03:58.501 --> 03:03:59.150
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

4352
03:03:59.151 --> 03:03:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4353
03:03:59.631 --> 03:04:04.631
<v Speaker 1>well it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an ineffective use of sound to </v>

4354
03:04:04.631 --> 03:04:04.631
<v Speaker 1>convey my thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4355
03:04:04.670 --> 03:04:08.540
<v Speaker 1>and is it worth it to piss people off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4356
03:04:08.541 --> 03:04:09.590
<v Speaker 1>is it worth it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4357
03:04:09.591 --> 03:04:13.340
<v Speaker 1>look what happened with tommy and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word retard,</v>

4358
03:04:13.400 --> 03:04:16.560
<v Speaker 1>which he's not calling anyone that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not the,</v>

4359
03:04:17.020 --> 03:04:20.510
<v Speaker 1>the bid is about forbidden language and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he literally.</v>

4360
03:04:20.511 --> 03:04:25.070
<v Speaker 1>All he said in that bit was that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not allowed to use that word anyMore.</v>

4361
03:04:25.340 --> 03:04:28.640
<v Speaker 1>and in saying that there was massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>protests.</v>

4362
03:04:28.641 --> 03:04:33.641
<v Speaker 1>There's all these people freaking out </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't even want you to </v>

4363
03:04:33.641 --> 03:04:35.240
<v Speaker 1>utter the sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real problem because that kind of</v>

4364
03:04:35.241 --> 03:04:40.241
<v Speaker 1>thinking is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this to say that it can't be used </v>

4365
03:04:40.241 --> 03:04:42.050
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can't admit that it's a word,</v>

4366
03:04:42.290 --> 03:04:44.630
<v Speaker 1>like you cannot say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot utter it,</v>

4367
03:04:44.631 --> 03:04:46.790
<v Speaker 1>but it's abracadabra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's a magic word.</v>

4368
03:04:47.270 --> 03:04:49.190
<v Speaker 1>You can't even bring it up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

4369
03:04:49.240 --> 03:04:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Who had to understand that we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing.</v>

4370
03:04:51.770 --> 03:04:53.960
<v Speaker 1>So this word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the word is,</v>

4371
03:04:54.140 --> 03:04:59.140
<v Speaker 1>that you can't say it anymore because </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember they were trying to get rid of </v>

4372
03:04:59.140 --> 03:04:59.140
<v Speaker 1>bossy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember bossing?</v>

4373
03:04:59.140 --> 03:04:59.520
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4374
03:04:59.530 --> 03:05:04.530
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to say that bossy is a </v>

4375
03:05:04.530 --> 03:05:04.530
<v Speaker 1>sexist word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't use bossy.</v>

4376
03:05:04.530 --> 03:05:07.220
<v Speaker 1>They abandoned it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's that point is that they'll,</v>

4377
03:05:07.340 --> 03:05:12.340
<v Speaker 1>they'll try to find something to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>offended by and they'll try to put </v>

4378
03:05:12.340 --> 03:05:15.680
<v Speaker 1>whatever that word is into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>forbidden category and then you can have</v>

4379
03:05:15.681 --> 03:05:19.100
<v Speaker 1>so many words in that category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's going to be crazy and then you</v>

4380
03:05:19.101 --> 03:05:24.101
<v Speaker 1>have noises that you can't make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the real thing that's going to </v>

4381
03:05:24.101 --> 03:05:24.650
<v Speaker 1>change and I really think this is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to happen,</v>

4382
03:05:24.830 --> 03:05:29.830
<v Speaker 1>is we're going to figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bypass language is going to be weighted </v>

4383
03:05:29.830 --> 03:05:33.180
<v Speaker 1>to directly convey information to people</v>
<v Speaker 1>without language and it's going to </v>

4384
03:05:33.180 --> 03:05:37.721
<v Speaker 1>happen through some sort of technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>and elon musk was talking about it on </v>

4385
03:05:37.721 --> 03:05:40.580
<v Speaker 1>the podcast or something called neuro </v>
<v Speaker 1>link that he's working on that some sort</v>

4386
03:05:40.581 --> 03:05:45.581
<v Speaker 1>of a really revolutionary way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase bandwidth between you and ideas</v>

4387
03:05:47.211 --> 03:05:48.470
<v Speaker 1>and how ideas get to your head.</v>

4388
03:05:48.470 --> 03:05:52.160
<v Speaker 1>It's going to Be something that you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's going to be like step</v>

4389
03:05:52.161 --> 03:05:55.700
<v Speaker 1>one and then you're going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that from person to person.</v>

4390
03:05:56.090 --> 03:06:01.090
<v Speaker 1>And I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this were so invasive now with </v>

4391
03:06:01.090 --> 03:06:02.870
<v Speaker 1>social media like it's so and cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>phones and electronics.</v>

4392
03:06:02.900 --> 03:06:07.900
<v Speaker 1>everything is in your life and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are getting closer and closer to each </v>

4393
03:06:07.900 --> 03:06:10.931
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the Side effects is that of </v>

4394
03:06:10.931 --> 03:06:12.740
<v Speaker 1>that is that people now realize they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt you so they can attack you easier.</v>

4395
03:06:12.741 --> 03:06:16.190
<v Speaker 1>And they go and they can tear things </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to can light things on fire because</v>

4396
03:06:16.191 --> 03:06:21.191
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily because it's a wise </v>

4397
03:06:21.191 --> 03:06:22.370
<v Speaker 1>thing or it's a measureD thing or it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really well thought out thing.</v>

4398
03:06:22.520 --> 03:06:25.280
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it just Because it's a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that they can use.</v>

4399
03:06:25.281 --> 03:06:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Like you gave a chimp and ak 47 and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>just started shooting up the jungle.</v>

4400
03:06:29.120 --> 03:06:32.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally that is what a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were doing with social media,</v>

4401
03:06:32.330 --> 03:06:37.330
<v Speaker 1>but I think that is just a stage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that eventually we're going to bypass </v>

4402
03:06:37.330 --> 03:06:38.360
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

4403
03:06:38.420 --> 03:06:42.320
<v Speaker 1>I really think that the thing it's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be like emojis,</v>

4404
03:06:42.750 --> 03:06:46.730
<v Speaker 1>that way they can communicate through </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a form of hieroglyphics almost.</v>

4405
03:06:46.760 --> 03:06:48.890
<v Speaker 1>This is a conversation that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a November 5th one.</v>
