<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>

174
00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:33.710

<v Speaker 1>Everybody.</v>

175

<v Speaker 1>they have to have something because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's God fucking lose.</v>

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.980
<v Speaker 2>He said that to everybody right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got rich.</v>

234
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:20.780
<v Speaker 2>Let me be rich and famous right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear your pitch,</v>

235
00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Jim,</v>

236
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.530
<v Speaker 1>something you think you could get away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

237
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.160
<v Speaker 1>as he said it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to sort of like,</v>

238
00:10:27.161 --> 00:10:28.500
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>

239
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:29.710
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

240
00:10:29.711 --> 00:10:34.711
<v Speaker 1>that's what happens when you got to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>careful that tide goes in and it goes </v>

241
00:10:34.711 --> 00:10:36.160
<v Speaker 1>out and people come up and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember.</v>

242
00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:41.460
<v Speaker 1>They remember and remember when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked with them and we've seen and </v>

243
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:41.460
<v Speaker 1>we've seen them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've seen them,</v>

244
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.310
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but being a comedian,</v>

245
00:10:42.311 --> 00:10:47.311
<v Speaker 1>we get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get a chance to sit in a different </v>

246
00:10:47.311 --> 00:10:50.161
<v Speaker 1>seat because we sort of are our jobs or </v>
<v Speaker 1>our observational,</v>

247
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.170
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We still have our own demons,</v>

248
00:10:53.171 --> 00:10:54.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just different.</v>

249
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.710
<v Speaker 1>You also get humbled a lot as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian.</v>

250
00:10:56.711 --> 00:10:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to get those jokes.</v>

251
00:10:58.211 --> 00:11:00.100
<v Speaker 1>You're performing in front of a live </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

252
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.040
<v Speaker 1>It's all live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta work and it doesn't work.</v>

253
00:11:03.041 --> 00:11:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

254
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.910
<v Speaker 1>You got to go back to the drawing board </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's got to assess.</v>

255
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Actors don't get a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why they're </v>

256
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:12.030
<v Speaker 1>kind of shaky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More shaky.</v>

257
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

258
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Don't get a lot of that testing it live </v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of people.</v>

259
00:11:15.161 --> 00:11:17.490
<v Speaker 1>That humility that comes with that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't and and it's in.</v>

260
00:11:17.491 --> 00:11:18.790
<v Speaker 1>It's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to her act,</v>

261
00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.710
<v Speaker 1>another actor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's tough because see,</v>

262
00:11:20.711 --> 00:11:23.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm a comic who became an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm cheating.</v>

263
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.110
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can go do this and I can go.</v>

264
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be in St Louis tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know some jokes so I can,</v>

265
00:11:29.231 --> 00:11:29.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get.</v>

266
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.020
<v Speaker 1>I can get my thing off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just actors,</v>

267
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.160
<v Speaker 1>it's tough when you figured out a way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>balance three careers,</v>

268
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:39.040
<v Speaker 1>you can sing too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could do anything.</v>

269
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:40.870
<v Speaker 1>You're a weird guy in that way.</v>

270
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:45.870
<v Speaker 1>You got a lot of weird talent yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about Justin Bieber and </v>

271
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Chris Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got some weird ability to shift </v>

272
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:50.360
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only him,</v>

273
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.340
<v Speaker 1>but I've been fortunate in the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>now things have up like,</v>

274
00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:55.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in the day,</v>

275
00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 1>like you could only do one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing I will never forget,</v>

276
00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Keenan Ivory Wayans told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

277
00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's with the singing shit?</v>

278
00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:08.440
<v Speaker 1>You motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see you trying to sing and shit </v>

279
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.670
<v Speaker 1>or I would try to sing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you see them?</v>

280
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.070
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is real.</v>

281
00:12:12.071 --> 00:12:13.150
<v Speaker 1>And grow back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jamie,</v>

<v Speaker 1>stop youtube.</v>

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.680
<v Speaker 1>it costs a million and a half dollars to</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw this party.</v>

314
00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:30.670
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>shit is number one in the country,</v>

428
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.790
<v Speaker 1>and then that's how I got into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

429
00:17:34.791 --> 00:17:37.310
<v Speaker 1>So long story longer.</v>

00:17:39.801 --> 00:17:43.700
<v Speaker 1>a lot of actors and actresses that can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just need those opportunities.</v>

432
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Just like in life when your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When your opportunity comes,</v>

433
00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:50.850
<v Speaker 1>if you prepare for it now could jump </v>
<v Speaker 1>into it and grab it.</v>

434
00:17:50.851 --> 00:17:55.830
<v Speaker 1>And what I was told was by my guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>brianne who does all of my music,</v>

435
00:17:55.831 --> 00:17:59.670
<v Speaker 1>he found slow jams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He found a goal that you found,</v>

436
00:17:59.671 --> 00:18:04.671
<v Speaker 1>blame it on the alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says you got to stop singing funny </v>

437
00:18:04.671 --> 00:18:08.001
<v Speaker 1>shit and seeing a real record and once </v>
<v Speaker 1>you sing the real record and not say </v>

<v Speaker 1>now you got a better goal.</v>

<v Speaker 1>of singing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were singing these funny songs about </v>

466
00:19:24.681 --> 00:19:27.520
<v Speaker 1>who let the dogs out and so we took who </v>
<v Speaker 1>let the dogs out and put it in like a,</v>

467
00:19:27.521 --> 00:19:28.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

468
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:32.310
<v Speaker 1>like a vaudeville or show tune who let </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dogs or whatever it was.</v>

469
00:19:32.311 --> 00:19:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But beginning of that I saw that ad lib,</v>

470
00:19:35.131 --> 00:19:40.131
<v Speaker 1>like I was watching these dogs and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were coming towards me and I was </v>

471
00:19:40.131 --> 00:19:40.320
<v Speaker 1>wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

472
00:19:40.321 --> 00:19:42.750
<v Speaker 1>who let them out and there was a pit </v>
<v Speaker 1>bull there and you know,</v>

473
00:19:42.751 --> 00:19:45.560
<v Speaker 1>you have to be careful because pit bulls</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be contentious,</v>

474
00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.070
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I go into the song,</v>

475
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:51.120
<v Speaker 1>the pit bull community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like jamie foxx,</v>

476
00:19:51.121 --> 00:19:56.121
<v Speaker 1>session people shameless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there was another thing where </v>

477
00:19:57.651 --> 00:20:02.390
<v Speaker 1>jimmy fallon was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing some type of,</v>

478
00:20:02.391 --> 00:20:07.391
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was saying what was going to be on </v>

479
00:20:07.391 --> 00:20:10.361
<v Speaker 1>the next show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was doing a bad version of </v>

480
00:20:10.361 --> 00:20:14.770
<v Speaker 1>signing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I actually know how to sign if I </v>

481
00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:14.770
<v Speaker 1>was doing a bad version of sign </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

482
00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.640
<v Speaker 1>I know we'll talk more about it later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

483
00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:20.600
<v Speaker 1>all those types of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as I was doing it as a joke,</v>

484
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.870
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that the person that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking about happened to be deaf.</v>

485
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

486
00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:28.900
<v Speaker 1>And so then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

487
00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.720
<v Speaker 1>so it was just all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I try to tell people,</v>

488
00:20:31.721 --> 00:20:32.080
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

489
00:20:32.081 --> 00:20:34.210
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we never mean anything bad.</v>

490
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.400
<v Speaker 1>We poke fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're not.</v>

491
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:37.960
<v Speaker 1>We don't mean anythIng bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't just,</v>

492
00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.120
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't kill us.</v>

493
00:20:40.121 --> 00:20:45.121
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because I got to keep doing what I </v>

494
00:20:45.121 --> 00:20:45.121
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

495
00:20:45.121 --> 00:20:45.121
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's getting tougher.</v>

496
00:20:45.121 --> 00:20:46.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just what we're talking about,</v>

497
00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.160
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about people</v>

498
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.120
<v Speaker 4>commenting on things that you can't read</v>
<v Speaker 4>the comments.</v>

499
00:20:50.121 --> 00:20:55.121
<v Speaker 4>There's just too many people and people </v>
<v Speaker 4>are always looking for something to be </v>

500
00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:58.681
<v Speaker 4>recreationally outraged at in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>comments and get that ass through the </v>

501
00:20:58.681 --> 00:21:02.010
<v Speaker 4>comment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>comment and hit you right where you go </v>

502
00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:02.010
<v Speaker 4>sometimes because damn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this motherfucker's right.</v>

503
00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:04.180
<v Speaker 4>It's good to though a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You went there right?</v>

504
00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:09.181
<v Speaker 4>When they're actually right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like someone can say something </v>

505
00:21:09.181 --> 00:21:09.181
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous about you and if you know </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's ridiculous,</v>

506
00:21:09.181 --> 00:21:11.220
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if it's got a hint of truth.</v>

507
00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.580
<v Speaker 1>But when somebody says something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>your teeth,</v>

508
00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.590
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of look in the mirror.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>comedian.</v>

564
00:23:23.391 --> 00:23:24.290
<v Speaker 1>I called robert,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing,</v>

581
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.640
<v Speaker 1>we fuck with robert downey jr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's our guy.</v>

582
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Like I did his birthday party and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>first joke was how dare you take all of </v>

583
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:08.460
<v Speaker 1>these roles from black people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

584
00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's laughing.</v>

585
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:12.920
<v Speaker 1>So it sorta liked to entertain as man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

586
00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:14.750
<v Speaker 1>we got to give us room.</v>

587
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.430
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like to play any.</v>

588
00:24:16.431 --> 00:24:18.770
<v Speaker 1>I'll show you when I got to take that </v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

589
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:21.130
<v Speaker 1>You gotta take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't worry about.</v>

590
00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:22.970
<v Speaker 1>I started chappelle somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

591
00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:28.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would ask him about his jokes and </v>

592
00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:28.060
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yo man,</v>

593
00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:28.060
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

594
00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.660
<v Speaker 1>people have said worse shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it said something about </v>

595
00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump saying grab by the pussy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>some shit,</v>

596
00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:32.450
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was true.</v>

597
00:24:32.451 --> 00:24:37.451
<v Speaker 1>It was like the oNe thing that you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at what happened with politics this </v>

598
00:24:37.451 --> 00:24:42.430
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people sort of stripped away a lot of </v>

599
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:42.430
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

600
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:45.641
<v Speaker 1>Regardless of what you believed in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever person you voted for.</v>

601
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:52.310
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot of things that were sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>addressed about like maybe we're playing</v>

602
00:24:52.311 --> 00:24:57.311
<v Speaker 1>things a little too close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some of those politicians were </v>

603
00:24:57.311 --> 00:25:00.581
<v Speaker 1>afraid to say what Donald Trump was </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying and they ended up being left in </v>

604
00:25:00.581 --> 00:25:01.670
<v Speaker 1>the dust because people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

605
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:06.850
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a point in the sense of we're </v>

606
00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:06.850
<v Speaker 1>playing things a little too close.</v>

607
00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:06.850
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

608
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:08.600
<v Speaker 1>when you look at that as a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

609
00:25:08.601 --> 00:25:09.710
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

610
00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:15.040
<v Speaker 1>that was good for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was good for me in a certain way </v>

611
00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:15.040
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

612
00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:15.700
<v Speaker 1>it is great jokes too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

613
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:20.770
<v Speaker 1>it does say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we becoming too fragile when it </v>

614
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.940
<v Speaker 1>comes to our race?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like black folk?</v>

615
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

616
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:27.680
<v Speaker 1>some people are racist and some people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are perceptionist know what that means.</v>

617
00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Know the perception is the perception in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America was the white man.</v>

618
00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump can be president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The woman can't do it.</v>

619
00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Perception doesn't mean that if you vote</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Donald Trump that you're racist.</v>

620
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't think everybody's here because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a big thing.</v>

621
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes this perception I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll make,</v>

622
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:48.230
<v Speaker 1>I'll make it clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a joke in front of all black people</v>

623
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:51.710
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black people are very interesting people</v>

624
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:54.970
<v Speaker 1>because we deal with racism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception ism.</v>

625
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.870
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're very nervous.</v>

626
00:25:56.871 --> 00:25:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Flyers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

627
00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:03.340
<v Speaker 1>We don't like to get home planes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First thing we do when we get on the </v>

628
00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:03.340
<v Speaker 1>plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see who's flying this motherfucker.</v>

629
00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.090
<v Speaker 1>We look in The cockpit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we look and see a black guy,</v>

630
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:07.520
<v Speaker 1>we will stop and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

631
00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.870
<v Speaker 1>how long have you been flying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

632
00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:17.270
<v Speaker 1>you got your hours with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the perception and don't </v>

633
00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.020
<v Speaker 1>let a woman sitting next to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit we good.</v>

634
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.610
<v Speaker 1>It could be a bright sunny day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that how's the weather?</v>

635
00:26:21.611 --> 00:26:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Or we're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as you're sitting in that seat,</v>

636
00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.570
<v Speaker 1>anytime you hit a bump bump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brother,</v>

637
00:26:26.571 --> 00:26:29.780
<v Speaker 1>we straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same situation.</v>

638
00:26:29.781 --> 00:26:34.781
<v Speaker 1>You go in the cockpit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that white guy with that salt </v>

639
00:26:34.781 --> 00:26:37.691
<v Speaker 1>and pepper hair and those aviators and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's forum hair like this and it's </v>

640
00:26:37.691 --> 00:26:39.950
<v Speaker 1>storming outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit fly the shit through a hurricane.</v>

641
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.630
<v Speaker 1>So it's the perception that we have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about some time.</v>

642
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

643
00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:47.330
<v Speaker 1>it definitely makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

644
00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:52.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely that you don't like </v>

645
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:52.370
<v Speaker 1>the Donald Trump thinks funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know who had it,</v>

646
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:53.520
<v Speaker 1>said it best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alonzo bowden,</v>

647
00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:54.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alonzo.</v>

648
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:57.480
<v Speaker 1>No funny comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said he goes,</v>

649
00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:00.630
<v Speaker 1>not all Donald Trump supporters are </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>

650
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:03.030
<v Speaker 1>but aLl racists are Donald Trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporters.</v>

651
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:10.990
<v Speaker 1>That he definitely awakened that side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I repeat,</v>

652
00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.900
<v Speaker 1>I will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I will say this,</v>

653
00:27:12.901 --> 00:27:17.901
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the perception gets us all to know </v>

654
00:27:17.901 --> 00:27:17.901
<v Speaker 1>because like my daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was interested in my oldest,</v>

655
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:19.680
<v Speaker 1>my oldest daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when,</v>

656
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:20.700
<v Speaker 1>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

657
00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:23.800
<v Speaker 1>when the election happened and when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

658
00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.210
<v Speaker 1>the results came in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dan,</v>

659
00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm so mad I can't take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

660
00:27:27.301 --> 00:27:27.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

661
00:27:27.641 --> 00:27:29.010
<v Speaker 1>you were going to go march.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

662
00:27:29.011 --> 00:27:30.810
<v Speaker 1>what did you all vote?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not all of us,</v>

663
00:27:30.811 --> 00:27:31.980
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

664
00:27:31.981 --> 00:27:32.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

665
00:27:32.971 --> 00:27:36.270
<v Speaker 1>you gotta get out there because their </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception was she had it in the bag.</v>

666
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.490
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you gotta get out there and be,</v>

667
00:27:38.491 --> 00:27:39.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is.</v>

668
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that is.</v>

669
00:27:41.161 --> 00:27:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a weird times for everybody,</v>

670
00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think social media is allowing</v>

671
00:27:45.871 --> 00:27:47.180
<v Speaker 1>people to express themselves.</v>

672
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's expressed themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>perform them forming groups,</v>

673
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:52.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just like,</v>

674
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're progressive or they're,</v>

675
00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:59.550
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're liberal or they're conservative </v>

676
00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:00.420
<v Speaker 1>and this everybody has a voice is </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody has a voice.</v>

677
00:28:00.421 --> 00:28:02.250
<v Speaker 1>There's so much voices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say this,</v>

678
00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:05.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can appreciate this because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

679
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:06.840
<v Speaker 1>we've lived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were living in two worlds.</v>

680
00:28:06.841 --> 00:28:10.920
<v Speaker 1>We live when it wasn't here and we live </v>
<v Speaker 1>in it's discretion.</v>

681
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Social media allows you not to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>discretion.</v>

682
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:20.180
<v Speaker 1>You're able to go in and type whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to say and that usually that's </v>

683
00:28:20.641 --> 00:28:23.460
<v Speaker 1>what we pay attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Discretion is this.</v>

684
00:28:23.461 --> 00:28:25.230
<v Speaker 1>We're sitting at the dinner table and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yo,</v>

685
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:28.830
<v Speaker 1>I said something that you did like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the discretion was.</v>

686
00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:31.410
<v Speaker 1>I'll address that later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

687
00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.530
<v Speaker 1>So now that you don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>discretion,</v>

688
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:38.280
<v Speaker 1>anybody's voice can be heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not everybody.</v>

689
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:45.080
<v Speaker 1>How do you say it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not everybody has a point that we should</v>

690
00:28:46.561 --> 00:28:47.910
<v Speaker 1>hook all of our wagons to.</v>

691
00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:53.320
<v Speaker 1>What I noticed is that we will hook our </v>
<v Speaker 1>wagons to the most extreme point and </v>

692
00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.900
<v Speaker 1>that may be only 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

693
00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Like when my homies with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

694
00:28:56.311 --> 00:28:57.070
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear what they say,</v>

695
00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:58.880
<v Speaker 1>man it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as I said how many views did</v>

696
00:28:58.881 --> 00:29:00.060
<v Speaker 1>it get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>80,000</v>

697
00:29:00.061 --> 00:29:02.370
<v Speaker 1>views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I says 8 million people in philly alone.</v>

698
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Why are you just listening to those </v>
<v Speaker 1>80,000</v>

699
00:29:05.251 --> 00:29:10.251
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you sort of have to put balance in </v>

700
00:29:10.251 --> 00:29:10.251
<v Speaker 1>the way you sort of sift through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>

701
00:29:10.251 --> 00:29:11.310
<v Speaker 1>It does make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

702
00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I tried to put it out to people,</v>

703
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:15.720
<v Speaker 1>if you're running into the room and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 100 people in that room,</v>

704
00:29:15.721 --> 00:29:18.210
<v Speaker 1>what are the odds that one person is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking idiot.</v>

705
00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:19.620
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

706
00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One person.</v>

707
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:25.810
<v Speaker 1>It almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost every room of a random group of </v>

708
00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:25.810
<v Speaker 1>100 people and I'm being very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very polite.</v>

709
00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:28.110
<v Speaker 1>One person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means probably a few,</v>

710
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.420
<v Speaker 1>probably a few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's go with one.</v>

711
00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:35.480
<v Speaker 1>One out of 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means there's 3 million fucking </v>

712
00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.260
<v Speaker 1>idiots in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just straight idiots.</v>

713
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Non unfixable idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

714
00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:45.160
<v Speaker 1>so if you're going to read the comments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're opening yourself up to that.</v>

715
00:29:45.161 --> 00:29:50.161
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to get your opinion </v>
<v Speaker 1>swayed by people who just want to just </v>

716
00:29:50.161 --> 00:29:53.941
<v Speaker 1>want to see if they can affect you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just want to see if they can fuck with </v>

717
00:29:53.941 --> 00:29:57.351
<v Speaker 1>you and touch you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just see a big james to get you to </v>

718
00:29:57.351 --> 00:29:58.690
<v Speaker 1>change the way you're dressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably I don't like.</v>

719
00:29:58.691 --> 00:30:01.500
<v Speaker 1>So I tell all of my artists and all my </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends don't change.</v>

720
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Don't read it because what happens is </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody starts coloring inside the </v>

721
00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:07.120
<v Speaker 1>lines and then nobody's dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

722
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you remember back in the day,</v>

723
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:10.390
<v Speaker 1>madonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous point,</v>

724
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:15.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I'd come out naked just </v>

725
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.430
<v Speaker 1>dancing to the grant.</v>

726
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.430
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all good.</v>

727
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.330
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I hope will want,</v>

728
00:30:17.331 --> 00:30:19.120
<v Speaker 1>I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't tuck your art in.</v>

729
00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Don't tuck your art in for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>

730
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:25.950
<v Speaker 1>for the comments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we'll end up not having </v>

731
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:25.950
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not having anything to celebrate.</v>

732
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:29.080
<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is good.</v>

733
00:30:29.081 --> 00:30:34.081
<v Speaker 1>Like having something to celebrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody did a song that was dope or </v>

734
00:30:34.081 --> 00:30:34.081
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was dope.</v>

735
00:30:34.081 --> 00:30:35.710
<v Speaker 1>I got outside the box as opposed to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we love celebrating,</v>

736
00:30:35.711 --> 00:30:37.300
<v Speaker 1>which is the crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

737
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:38.110

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

738
00:30:38.111 --> 00:30:41.680
<v Speaker 1>especially for comics because it's one </v>
<v Speaker 1>per.</v>

739
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:44.170
<v Speaker 1>If you do a crazy movie is a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people involved.</v>

740
00:30:44.171 --> 00:30:49.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're onstage you say something </v>

741
00:30:49.171 --> 00:30:49.171
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just you.</v>

742
00:30:49.171 --> 00:30:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going back out.</v>

743
00:30:50.141 --> 00:30:55.141
<v Speaker 1>So it's about to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna be passing out a whole bunch </v>

744

<v Speaker 1>like how much time did you take off?</v>

746
00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:01.440
<v Speaker 1>I've never actually taken off because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>still do gigs.</v>

747
00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:03.310
<v Speaker 1>Like I got a gig tomorrow,</v>

750
00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

751
00:31:07.751 --> 00:31:12.751
<v Speaker 1>like I know like as a comedian you gotta</v>
<v Speaker 1>live like I just can't jump out there </v>

752
00:31:12.751 --> 00:31:14.230
<v Speaker 1>and just started talking or writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes.</v>

753
00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Like I've lived through some crazy shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>so I got to go out there and talk about </v>

754
00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:20.220
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

755
00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:24.090
<v Speaker 1>had I not been hell because the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>Thing I hate is the one thing that's </v>

756
00:31:24.341 --> 00:31:29.341
<v Speaker 1>tough for comedian is to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful because we talk from a shit </v>

757
00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:35.400
<v Speaker 1>is fucked up point of View and I got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a little anger and I got to have a </v>

758
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.350
<v Speaker 1>little poke fun and if I become that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if I become what I poke fun at,</v>

759
00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:43.650
<v Speaker 1>then I can't get it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why my house people come to my </v>

760
00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:43.650
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

761
00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:45.360
<v Speaker 1>My daughter used to ask me this dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is this room not?</v>

762
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000

<v Speaker 1>I said I dOn't want to complete the </v>

763
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.090
<v Speaker 1>house because it gives me a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm still trying to get on like I don't </v>

<v Speaker 4>stay normal because you must get </v>
<v Speaker 4>overwhelmed by requests and people just </v>

<v Speaker 1>other people and see how people in our </v>

834
00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.920
<v Speaker 1>business when they do get behind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gates,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't mean funny no more.</v>

837
00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to be funny more.</v>

838
00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:16.640
<v Speaker 1>That's how you came up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be sexy now.</v>

839
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:20.420
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all fall into the sexy,</v>

840
00:35:20.421 --> 00:35:20.850
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah.</v>

841
00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:22.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It keep the teeth gooby,</v>

842
00:35:22.851 --> 00:35:27.851
<v Speaker 1>keeping my head looking goofy hair at </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is because that's what I </v>

843
00:35:27.851 --> 00:35:29.390
<v Speaker 1>draw upon when I go out because people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can sense it,</v>

844
00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.430
<v Speaker 1>don't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

845
00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:34.390
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think stand up is kind of in some ways</v>

846
00:35:34.391 --> 00:35:39.391
<v Speaker 4>it's a like a mind meld or a massive </v>
<v Speaker 4>gnosis like gear connecting with the </v>

847
00:35:39.391 --> 00:35:43.971
<v Speaker 4>audience and if there's anything false </v>
<v Speaker 4>about what you're thinking or what </v>

848
00:35:43.971 --> 00:35:45.300
<v Speaker 4>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of them at least can feel it.</v>

849
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:50.840
<v Speaker 4>SometImes all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some of them can feel it and it'll </v>

850
00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:51.600
<v Speaker 4>fuck with the energy of the room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you're in the groove,</v>

851
00:35:51.601 --> 00:35:54.590
<v Speaker 4>you're really being yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why when you see dave onstage,</v>

852
00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.750
<v Speaker 4>one of the things about chappelle is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he's always himself.</v>

853
00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:03.440
<v Speaker 4>He can just be himself and so you relax </v>
<v Speaker 4>as an audience member and slide right </v>

854
00:36:03.571 --> 00:36:06.810
<v Speaker 4>into his mind and he takes you on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>journey because he's himself.</v>

855
00:36:06.811 --> 00:36:07.740
<v Speaker 4>He's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not.</v>

856
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:13.100
<v Speaker 4>He's not dIsconnected by fame and </v>
<v Speaker 4>celebrity and that way he was cheating.</v>

857
00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:14.490
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How he passed up.</v>

858
00:36:14.491 --> 00:36:19.491
<v Speaker 4>All that money just went to africa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just settled in and then came back and </v>

859
00:36:20.311 --> 00:36:25.311
<v Speaker 4>didn't do any scheduled gigs for years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would show up with a speaker and set </v>

860
00:36:26.471 --> 00:36:31.471
<v Speaker 4>up a speaker in a park in seattle and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just gather a crowd around and start </v>

861
00:36:31.471 --> 00:36:31.471
<v Speaker 4>doing standup.</v>

862
00:36:31.471 --> 00:36:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my seat.</v>

863
00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:33.620
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

864
00:36:33.621 --> 00:36:36.860
<v Speaker 1>how do you find that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He figured it out how he did it?</v>

865
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that because like I said,</v>

866
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:46.450
<v Speaker 1>if you success can sometimes be our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our coffin,</v>

867
00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:48.800
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said when you're,</v>

868
00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:53.860
<v Speaker 1>when you're a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even all the way down to the way I </v>

869
00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:53.860
<v Speaker 1>handled like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like uh,</v>

870
00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:58.180
<v Speaker 1>like social media is interested in me </v>
<v Speaker 1>just sort of brand new on it and what </v>

872

<v Speaker 1>but I was just talking about how people </v>

885
00:37:30.981 --> 00:37:32.000
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

886
00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:37.180
<v Speaker 1>it's just gas station shades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But everybody thought they was,</v>

887
00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>

888
00:37:39.471 --> 00:37:40.030
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nah,</v>

889
00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:42.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want them to think that.</v>

890
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:44.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't want them to think that I spent </v>
<v Speaker 1>$2,000</v>

891
00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:49.900
<v Speaker 1>because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we always lose our fucking shades </v>

892
00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:49.900
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

893
00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.270
<v Speaker 1>So I actually hit my boy davao and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dave schottenstein,</v>

894
00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:53.300
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

895
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:57.230
<v Speaker 1>I want to do a eyeglass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

896
00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:57.580
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

897
00:37:57.581 --> 00:37:58.540
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to go?</v>

898
00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:58.940
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

899
00:37:58.941 --> 00:37:59.150
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

900
00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:03.860
<v Speaker 1>I want to do an eyeglass that costs less</v>
<v Speaker 1>than $30.</v>

901
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:09.430
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what we're gonna do is we're going </v>

902
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.430
<v Speaker 1>to go through each frame and make sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>each frame is tight,</v>

903
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:10.220
<v Speaker 1>like the dope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like amazing.</v>

904
00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Because I told them the story about </v>
<v Speaker 1>being at the gas station and they were </v>

905
00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:15.220
<v Speaker 1>liKe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

906
00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:17.180
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we ended up doing this whole line.</v>

907
00:38:17.181 --> 00:38:19.550
<v Speaker 1>I went through all 200 frames and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

908
00:38:19.551 --> 00:38:22.970
<v Speaker 1>This line's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called a revolt,</v>

909
00:38:22.971 --> 00:38:27.971
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody thought that it was </v>

910
00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:31.490
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 bucks,</v>

911
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:37.390
<v Speaker 1>$30 shiFts and now even dot lo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bella thorne and all these other people </v>

912
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:42.060
<v Speaker 1>are wearing the shades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>BeCause what we noticed when we did do </v>

913
00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:44.671
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people embrace it a little more because </v>

914
00:38:44.671 --> 00:38:47.611
<v Speaker 1>we did a commercial that was that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost made that mistake where we get </v>

915
00:38:47.611 --> 00:38:52.230
<v Speaker 1>clothes on and we tell people how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>the clothes cost and people got turned </v>

916
00:38:54.641 --> 00:38:58.040
<v Speaker 1>off because the jeans were like $400.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacket was 2000.</v>

917
00:38:58.070 --> 00:38:59.020
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

918
00:38:59.420 --> 00:38:59.920
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

919
00:38:59.921 --> 00:39:02.690
<v Speaker 1>What we were trying to say was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although these closing costs,</v>

920
00:39:02.691 --> 00:39:07.691
<v Speaker 1>it's our glasses only cost 30 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that story In itself,</v>

921
00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.260
<v Speaker 1>I take that and run with that and say </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

922
00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:15.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the guy buying the high end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know stuff.</v>

923
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:18.690
<v Speaker 1>I want to keep it sorta cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regular,</v>

924
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.600
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

925
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:20.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that make sense?</v>

926
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:21.960
<v Speaker 4>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

927
00:39:21.961 --> 00:39:23.990
<v Speaker 4>I know it really rich dude who drives a </v>
<v Speaker 4>pickup truck.</v>

928
00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:29.380
<v Speaker 4>He's rich as fuck and he just likes to </v>
<v Speaker 4>drive around in a shitty old toyota </v>

929
00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:29.380
<v Speaker 4>pickup truck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He likes it.</v>

930
00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.630
<v Speaker 4>And why you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because he wants to feel normal,</v>

931
00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.200
<v Speaker 4>feel normal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel grimy.</v>

932
00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:35.690
<v Speaker 4>You want to feel normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't wash his hands sometimes.</v>

933
00:39:35.691 --> 00:39:40.691
<v Speaker 4>Get dirt under his fingernails.</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretends he's a farmer and combined a </v>

934
00:39:40.691 --> 00:39:42.080
<v Speaker 4>whole fucking world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are weird like that.</v>

935
00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:44.930
<v Speaker 1>But we have to balance both because I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

936
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.770
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:40:34.291 --> 00:40:34.291
<v Speaker 1>that's what they try to snatch from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we did.</v>

961
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:39.300
<v Speaker 1>We did the television show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris spencer in a buddy lewis wrote </v>

962
00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.541
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote this incredible script called </v>

963
00:40:42.541 --> 00:40:45.121
<v Speaker 1>white famous and white famous was about </v>
<v Speaker 1>a comedian who's trying to become </v>

964
00:40:45.791 --> 00:40:48.250
<v Speaker 1>mainstream without losing his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

965
00:40:48.251 --> 00:40:49.930
<v Speaker 1>his black audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is all these.</v>

966
00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:51.160
<v Speaker 1>All of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We go through that,</v>

967
00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:56.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the minute you started doing </v>

968
00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:56.590
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

969
00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:56.590
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

970
00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:59.860
<v Speaker 1>the sort of soft movies and brother man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't cuss no more motherfuckers</v>

971
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:03.370
<v Speaker 4>you cussing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

972
00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:07.980
<v Speaker 4>I think the problem with shining is when</v>
<v Speaker 4>it defines you problem when,</v>

973
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:10.850
<v Speaker 4>when you just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything is flat like floyd mayweather</v>

974
00:41:10.851 --> 00:41:15.851
<v Speaker 4>in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's part of his persona as part of why </v>

975
00:41:15.851 --> 00:41:17.240
<v Speaker 4>people root against him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like ford is a genius and he my printing</v>

976
00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:20.360
<v Speaker 4>not just a genius boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's the greatest defensive boxer,</v>

977
00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:24.080
<v Speaker 4>my opinion of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also a genius in that he figured out</v>

978
00:41:24.081 --> 00:41:27.900
<v Speaker 4>a way where he has this style that's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>appealing to a lot of people,</v>

979
00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:33.370
<v Speaker 4>but what is appealing is people want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>see him get his ass kicked and it never </v>

980
00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:33.410
<v Speaker 4>fucking happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>

981
00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:33.810
<v Speaker 4>in</v>

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:39.380
<v Speaker 1>floyd's the hmi floyd comes by the house</v>
<v Speaker 1>man and I don't want to put everything </v>

983
00:41:39.391 --> 00:41:41.850
<v Speaker 1>out there that he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's super,</v>

984
00:41:41.851 --> 00:41:44.730
<v Speaker 1>super competItive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's amazing.</v>

985
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:47.970
<v Speaker 1>But he also understands that yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>j fox,</v>

986
00:41:47.971 --> 00:41:49.540
<v Speaker 1>I understanding what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your alternate.</v>

987
00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:50.020
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

988
00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.830
<v Speaker 1>they want me to follow j fox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what keeps me competitive all</v>

989
00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:54.020
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easy work,</v>

990
00:41:54.021 --> 00:41:57.450
<v Speaker 1>light work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he would sit at my crib and speak for</v>

991
00:41:57.451 --> 00:42:02.451
<v Speaker 1>like hours about the business of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to turn these boxers.</v>

992
00:42:04.501 --> 00:42:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Mine's on like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yo,</v>

994
00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Don't get your money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get your business,</v>

995
00:42:09.091 --> 00:42:14.091
<v Speaker 1>get on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he talks about just what you </v>

996
00:42:14.091 --> 00:42:14.091
<v Speaker 1>said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

997
00:42:14.091 --> 00:42:16.790
<v Speaker 1>I know the reason that I fight oscar de </v>
<v Speaker 1>la hoya on cinco de mayo is because they</v>

998
00:42:18.571 --> 00:42:19.430
<v Speaker 1>want to see the va.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

999
00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.250
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1000
00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.920
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he carved out a niche for</v>

1001
00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:22.760
<v Speaker 4>being the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1002
00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:25.260
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the charismatic villain.</v>

1003
00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:26.290
<v Speaker 4>does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1004
00:42:26.291 --> 00:42:28.020
<v Speaker 4>And he wasn't in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't,</v>

1005
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:31.350
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was pretty boy floyd mayweather here.</v>

1006
00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.640
<v Speaker 4>And then he became money mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1007
00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:36.690
<v Speaker 4>But had he stayed pretty boy.</v>

1008
00:42:36.691 --> 00:42:38.640

<v Speaker 4>or something,</v>

1009
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:44.750
<v Speaker 4>but not really because shane had lost to</v>
<v Speaker 4>a few guys like what floyd did better </v>

1010
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:46.290
<v Speaker 4>than anybody is not get hit.</v>

1028
00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.320
<v Speaker 4>He got rocked In that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was one of the few moments where he</v>

1029
00:43:19.321 --> 00:43:21.330
<v Speaker 4>really got caught by a world class </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighter.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This next fight coming up.</v>

1032
00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1033
00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:29.050
<v Speaker 4>connor's not that level of boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know someone.</v>

1034
00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:30.460
<v Speaker 4>I forget who it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It said it.</v>

1035
00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:33.300
<v Speaker 4>I think it might've been a daily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1036
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:38.530
<v Speaker 4>but someone was saying that he's got to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was patent [inaudible] saying that he </v>

1037
00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:42.751
<v Speaker 4>has to almost cheat within the rules and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's got to like fight in the </v>

1038
00:43:42.791 --> 00:43:44.710
<v Speaker 4>clinic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's got to like dirty box.</v>

1039
00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:49.660
<v Speaker 4>He's got to figure out a way to tie him </v>
<v Speaker 4>up and manipulate them and move his body</v>

1040
00:43:49.661 --> 00:43:54.661
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got to figure out A way to be good </v>

1041
00:43:54.661 --> 00:43:56.290
<v Speaker 4>defensively to and he's got a hurt them.</v>

00:46:17.421 --> 00:46:18.360
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the lights.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you mean?</v>

1102
00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:25.010

<v Speaker 4>when the lights are that bright and you </v>

<v Speaker 4>tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it was hatton.</v>

1107

<v Speaker 4>sending the lights,</v>

1108
00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:37.310
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1114
00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:47.670
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When he gets into that ring and he's got</v>

1115
00:46:47.671 --> 00:46:51.780
<v Speaker 4>shoes on and he fills those big ass </v>
<v Speaker 4>gloves on his hands and then it looks on</v>

1116
00:46:51.781 --> 00:46:56.781
<v Speaker 4>the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He sees floyd is moving around and </v>

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:09.140
<v Speaker 1>like going visiting people in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets out.</v>

1229
00:51:09.141 --> 00:51:10.730
<v Speaker 1>This is around just before nine slash </v>
<v Speaker 1>11.</v>

1230
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:14.270
<v Speaker 1>And then my stepfather was incredible in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life because he taught me how to play</v>

1231
00:51:14.271 --> 00:51:16.820
<v Speaker 1>tennis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So back in the seventies,</v>

<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

1234
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:20.240
<v Speaker 1>in the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like playing tennis.</v>

1235
00:51:20.241 --> 00:51:20.800
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1236
00:51:20.801 --> 00:51:22.520
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen a black dude play </v>
<v Speaker 1>tennis.</v>

1237
00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:27.880
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to learn some people like yanik </v>

<v Speaker 1>Those were like heroes of mine.</v>

1240
00:51:30.351 --> 00:51:32.720
<v Speaker 1>So he taught me how to play play tennis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when he gets out,</v>

1241
00:51:32.721 --> 00:51:34.640
<v Speaker 1>he gets out of jail and make sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is cool.</v>

1242
00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:40.060
<v Speaker 1>I take him to the us open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there is me and my pops watching </v>

1243
00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:41.990
<v Speaker 1>venus when he's crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this is what we need to do.</v>

1247
00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:49.970
<v Speaker 1>So he watches venus play and then a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of days after that,</v>

1248
00:51:49.971 --> 00:51:50.750
<v Speaker 1>it was nine slash 11.</v>

1249
00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1250
00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:55.580
<v Speaker 1>he stayed with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been with me since then,</v>

1251
00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it early on I would just go by and check</v>

1252
00:51:57.771 --> 00:52:00.290
<v Speaker 1>the drawers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure there's no paraphernalia,</v>

1253
00:52:00.291 --> 00:52:01.930
<v Speaker 1>no wrong shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke your weed.</v>

1254
00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:04.070
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do no more than that.</v>

1255
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.230
<v Speaker 1>And we've been cool since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1256
00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:09.500
<v Speaker 1>and it saved a lot of money in rehab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1257
00:52:09.501 --> 00:52:11.980
<v Speaker 1>So I'm just right there and hands on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1258
00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:17.050
<v Speaker 1>well sometimes people just being </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by loved ones is enough to </v>

1259
00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:17.050
<v Speaker 1>keep them from doing anything stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1260
00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:17.120
<v Speaker 1>it can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can.</v>

1261
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:19.070
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was bumpy at first,</v>

1262
00:52:19.071 --> 00:52:21.950
<v Speaker 1>won't go into it because he wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little book and talked about it.</v>

1263
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:26.390
<v Speaker 1>It was bumpy at first because when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>first got out I did some shit for him.</v>

1264
00:52:26.391 --> 00:52:27.260
<v Speaker 1>Got him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got him,</v>

1265
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.340
<v Speaker 1>got him a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1266
00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:30.000
<v Speaker 1>He relapsed this car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>

1267
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:31.520
<v Speaker 1>He's back in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1268
00:52:31.521 --> 00:52:33.920
<v Speaker 1>So it was a couple little things that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to work out,</v>

1269
00:52:33.921 --> 00:52:36.320
<v Speaker 1>but now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see him now like,</v>
