<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

7
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.781
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

8
00:00:08.781 --> 00:00:11.360
<v Speaker 1>how many people get your name wrong when they try to pronounce it?</v>

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

10
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.011
<v Speaker 1>so many people,</v>

11
00:00:13.011 --> 00:00:14.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't even care anymore.</v>

12
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.330
<v Speaker 1>I just had it where it comes out and cause I live in,</v>

13
00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:18.920
<v Speaker 1>it's a funny name where I come from,</v>

14
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.230
<v Speaker 1>right from England who grown up was a funny name,</v>

15
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.740
<v Speaker 1>but in Mexico is even stranger names.</v>

16
00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:25.400
<v Speaker 1>So I just normally make it Ian,</v>

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.570

19
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

20
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.100
<v Speaker 1>So everyone,</v>

21
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.000
<v Speaker 1>I messed that up too.</v>

22
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:33.460
<v Speaker 1>If they see it spelled yes.</v>

23
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.270
<v Speaker 1>A microphone about a fist from your face.</v>

24
00:00:35.271 --> 00:00:35.481
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

25
00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:36.314
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>

26
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.473
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Yo on,</v>

28
00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:40.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever heard that name before.</v>

29
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Does enact a call young referred?</v>

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.480
<v Speaker 1>He's in fantastic four.</v>

32
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

33
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.220
<v Speaker 1>He's the stretchy guy.</v>

34
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.461
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

35
00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:47.000
<v Speaker 1>no shit.</v>

36
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.930
<v Speaker 1>In fantastic four.</v>

37
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:48.261
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

38
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:48.770
<v Speaker 1>he kind of,</v>

39
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.270
<v Speaker 1>he's made that name a little bit more,</v>

40
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.320
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more acceptable.</v>

41
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

42
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.580
<v Speaker 1>how did you wind up living in Mexico City?</v>

43
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.090
<v Speaker 1>So I came to Mexico or went to Mexico and the year 2000 and uh,</v>

44
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.210
<v Speaker 1>I'll kind of messed around for a few years in the UK.</v>

45
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.010
<v Speaker 1>What did the game to journalism.</v>

46
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.900
<v Speaker 1>So I found one way to get into it was to start working in a foreign country</v>

47
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.860
<v Speaker 1>rather than going to my local newspaper and work and go to a foreign country and</v>

48
00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:16.694
<v Speaker 1>start working.</v>

49
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.300
<v Speaker 1>And I had a romantic idea about Latin America thinking I'd be like,</v>

50
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.650
<v Speaker 1>I saw the movie Salvador.</v>

51
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

52
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:01:22.821 --> 00:01:24.470
<v Speaker 1>Oliver Stone's movie from the 80s.</v>

54
00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:24.921
<v Speaker 1>I kind of had a,</v>

55
00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:25.251
<v Speaker 1>had a,</v>

56
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:28.160
<v Speaker 1>had a romantic idea about running around with grillers,</v>

57
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

58
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.770
<v Speaker 1>fighting military dictatorships.</v>

59
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.970
<v Speaker 1>So I arrived in Mexico in 2000 and got a job at,</v>

60
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:36.260
<v Speaker 1>I had an English language newspaper.</v>

61
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.100
<v Speaker 1>How old were you?</v>

62
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.260
<v Speaker 1>27 when I first left the UK.</v>

63
00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

64
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.091
<v Speaker 1>28 when I,</v>

65
00:01:40.091 --> 00:01:41.810
<v Speaker 1>I messed around for a bit in Mexico as well,</v>

66
00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:43.040
<v Speaker 1>and then got the job when I was 28.</v>

67
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Mexico City is a wild place.</v>

68
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

69
00:01:44.921 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

70
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.400
<v Speaker 1>It's so packed.</v>

71
00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:46.651
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

72
00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:47.181
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to,</v>

73
00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:49.370
<v Speaker 1>I've only been there twice for a UFC events,</v>

74
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.350
<v Speaker 1>but every time I'm there I'm just shaking my head.</v>

75
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't believe how it's traffic works.</v>

76
00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:53.774
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

77
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

78
00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:55.030
<v Speaker 1>18 years.</v>

79
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.311
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

80
00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:56.450
<v Speaker 1>A lot of time in that traffic.</v>

81
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Nobody cares about red lights,</v>

82
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.521
<v Speaker 1>green lights,</v>

83
00:01:58.521 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 1>they don't care.</v>

84
00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>It's stressful.</v>

85
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Everyone who wants to cut you up all the time.</v>

86
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

87
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.380
<v Speaker 1>People shout at you a lot.</v>

88
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.850
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to get used to people calling you like Ben Deco cerebral.</v>

89
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.010
<v Speaker 1>I tried different tactics,</v>

90
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:11.660
<v Speaker 1>not just try and relax and not get angry.</v>

91
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Did you know how to speak Spanish before you went there?</v>

92
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

93
00:02:14.031 --> 00:02:16.760
<v Speaker 1>so I spent one year in Spain living in Spain before I went.</v>

94
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.290
<v Speaker 1>Now I spent a year in the Middle East as well.</v>

95
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

96
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.390
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

97
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.591
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

98
00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:23.780
<v Speaker 1>I started off when I arrived I spoke more to Spanish,</v>

99
00:02:23.781 --> 00:02:24.141
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>

100
00:02:24.141 --> 00:02:25.880
<v Speaker 1>which is like all yet DLC on your deal.</v>

101
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.580
<v Speaker 1>And then I changed more to like the Mexican Spanish,</v>

102
00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:29.414
<v Speaker 1>which was like,</v>

103
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.911
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

104
00:02:29.911 --> 00:02:30.411
<v Speaker 1>your way.</v>

105
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:31.310
<v Speaker 1>Keep us all away.</v>

106
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.941
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

107
00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:32.181
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

108
00:02:32.181 --> 00:02:32.810
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

109
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.643
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

110
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.730
<v Speaker 1>So when did you start getting into narco journalism?</v>

111
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.010
<v Speaker 1>So like I arrived to say with the romantic idea about what I might cover in,</v>

112
00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:43.251
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

113
00:02:43.251 --> 00:02:43.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

114
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.430
<v Speaker 1>in Mexico or Latin America and right away realize all that idea of grillers in</v>

115
00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:50.630
<v Speaker 1>military dictatorships that have gone.</v>

116
00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:51.740
<v Speaker 1>That was the last century.</v>

117
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.490
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

118
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Che Guevara,</v>

119
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.050
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff had gone.</v>

120
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.570
<v Speaker 1>But right away when I arrived,</v>

121
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.453
<v Speaker 1>my very first off,</v>

122
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.150
<v Speaker 1>first I back in the UK,</v>

123
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.880
<v Speaker 1>grew up around a lot of drugs in the UK.</v>

124
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>So going back to the eighties,</v>

125
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.390
<v Speaker 1>I grew up a lot,</v>

126
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>people taking drugs.</v>

127
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>I had a few friends who died from heroin overdoses back then for people I knew</v>

128
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>died of heroin overdoses.</v>

129

00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:44.671
<v Speaker 1>Alex Borenstein and I'm Dr. Mike Hart from Canada and we talked about it and I</v>

151
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:49.600
<v Speaker 1>know people that have had that happen to them where they've had schizophrenia or</v>

152
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 1>a psychotic breaks because of just massive doses of marijuana.</v>

153
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.810
<v Speaker 1>And especially people that don't do it or people that do it too much for too</v>

154
00:03:58.811 --> 00:03:59.644
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

155
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.513
<v Speaker 1>It does happen.</v>

156
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 1>I had that debate.</v>

157
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why it came to mind.</v>

158
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

159
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

160
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know a lot of people smoke weed,</v>

161
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.031
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people.</v>

162
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:10.710
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>

163
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

164
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.741
<v Speaker 1>now when,</v>

165
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:16.741
<v Speaker 1>when my sister had a breakdown when she was 18 and I was 16 at a time and when</v>

166
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:18.221
<v Speaker 1>that came out,</v>

167
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:18.921
<v Speaker 1>it turned out awesome.</v>

168
00:04:18.921 --> 00:04:19.051
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

169
00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:19.410
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

170
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.310
<v Speaker 1>my grandmother had an issue with schizophrenia and I think identity as a time</v>

171
00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:27.850
<v Speaker 1>bomb waiting to go off or if it was how much the,</v>

172
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:28.510
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

173
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.710
<v Speaker 1>the hatch was involved in that.</v>

174
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 1>There's other issues as well.</v>

175
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 1>So I don't really know the science of it,</v>

176
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:35.290
<v Speaker 1>but Ben way going back.</v>

177
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:35.591
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

178
00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:37.540
<v Speaker 1>so I've been around a lot of drugs before.</v>

179
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.091
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

180
00:04:38.091 --> 00:04:39.340
<v Speaker 1>so when I arrived in Mexico,</v>

181
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:40.480
<v Speaker 1>actually one of the first,</v>

182
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

183
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.370
<v Speaker 1>first arriving in Mexico,</v>

184
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I ended up hanging around with some,</v>

185
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.650
<v Speaker 1>some people and they were smoking a lot of crack in Mexico.</v>

186
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.060
<v Speaker 1>It's one of some of the first people I met.</v>

187
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

188
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.703
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

189
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:51.031
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

190
00:04:51.031 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 1>I went down to the beach,</v>

191
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 1>like backpacking down to the beach and these people were smoking,</v>

192
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:55.631
<v Speaker 1>smoking crack.</v>

193
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:56.021
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

194
00:04:56.021 --> 00:04:56.711
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of strange.</v>

195
00:04:56.711 --> 00:04:58.630
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know those people smoking crack down here.</v>

196
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.470
<v Speaker 1>So when I got a job at the local newspaper in English and I just started looking</v>

197
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:05.531
<v Speaker 1>at the crime thing,</v>

198
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:09.310
<v Speaker 1>one of the first deals I did was on the issue of crack being sold locally and</v>

199
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:11.050
<v Speaker 1>how that linked to the cartels.</v>

200
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.480
<v Speaker 1>And then very soon does very,</v>

201
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:13.961
<v Speaker 1>very quick.</v>

202
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:15.220
<v Speaker 1>I just fell in right away.</v>

203
00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:15.611
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

204
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:16.630
<v Speaker 1>all these things happen by accident.</v>

205
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 1>I just fell into covering the crime beat and this has gone back to 2001.</v>

206
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.540
<v Speaker 1>So 2001,</v>

207
00:05:23.541 --> 00:05:25.720
<v Speaker 1>it was the same year that chapel was man escaped from prison.</v>

208
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

209
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 1>then I was calling a lot then to a great journeys from twiner has,</v>

210
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:32.760
<v Speaker 1>who's plan con ls.</v>

211
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.340
<v Speaker 1>You're a real legend from Tijuana who survived the shooting by it,</v>

212
00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:38.690
<v Speaker 1>by cartels and you know,</v>

213
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.180
<v Speaker 1>phoning him up all the time.</v>

214
00:05:40.181 --> 00:05:42.550
<v Speaker 1>Just getting him and had given me information can be tips.</v>

215
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.260
<v Speaker 1>And that is how it really started with that.</v>

216
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:44.841
<v Speaker 1>And our big store,</v>

217
00:05:44.841 --> 00:05:46.700
<v Speaker 1>I did it back in those days was a,</v>

218
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.390
<v Speaker 1>the court marshal if some generals for drug trafficking.</v>

219
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.030
<v Speaker 1>And that was really where it began.</v>

220
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.760
<v Speaker 1>That'd been generals for drug traffic.</v>

221
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:56.230
<v Speaker 1>How much of an issue is that?</v>

222
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

223
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

224
00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>corruption must be</v>

225
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably ramping.</v>

226
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.370
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

227
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.450
<v Speaker 1>corruption even isn't necessarily enough word for it.</v>

228
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I could state capture,</v>

229
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna say this is the real beginning and it has been a whole crazy 18 years</v>

230
00:06:09.811 --> 00:06:12.570
<v Speaker 1>of covering this stuff means this is the very beginning about,</v>

231
00:06:12.571 --> 00:06:13.440
<v Speaker 1>and I've seen a whole lot of,</v>

232
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.300
<v Speaker 1>for a crazy stuff in that time,</v>

233
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.501
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

234
00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:20.320
<v Speaker 1>just to get a sense of how bad the corruption is or what it really means and</v>

235
00:06:20.321 --> 00:06:20.391
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

236
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:21.480
<v Speaker 1>on the ground level,</v>

237
00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:23.100
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

238
00:06:23.101 --> 00:06:24.960
<v Speaker 1>there's a policemen.</v>

239
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Let you interview policemen,</v>

240
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.250
<v Speaker 1>you get to know the policemen in a certain town,</v>

241
00:06:29.251 --> 00:06:30.084
<v Speaker 1>certain city.</v>

242
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.271
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

243
00:06:31.271 --> 00:06:35.160
<v Speaker 1>and it's hard to know in a hat or military guys are politicians and you want to</v>

244
00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:36.210
<v Speaker 1>believe these are good people.</v>

245
00:06:36.211 --> 00:06:39.510
<v Speaker 1>You want to believe there's good policemen out there who really want to stop</v>

246
00:06:39.511 --> 00:06:40.344
<v Speaker 1>crime.</v>

247
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.790
<v Speaker 1>So there was one policeman,</v>

248
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.130
<v Speaker 1>his nickname was Tice at Dyson,</v>

249
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.420
<v Speaker 1>like Mike Tyson.</v>

250
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.940
<v Speaker 1>His nickname was Tyson because he was a world built bloke,</v>

251
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.240
<v Speaker 1>well built guy and uh,</v>

252
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.330
<v Speaker 1>he was friendly with depressed gut from Mitchell can friendly,</v>

253
00:06:54.331 --> 00:06:55.164
<v Speaker 1>would depress.</v>

254
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

255
00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.080
<v Speaker 1>and then it came out that he was actually a drug cartel member ranking member in</v>

256
00:07:02.251 --> 00:07:06.990
<v Speaker 1>a drug cartel and he actually confessed,</v>

257
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.260
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

258
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.670
<v Speaker 1>they used to have a thing where the police,</v>

259
00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:09.630
<v Speaker 1>the federal police,</v>

260
00:07:09.631 --> 00:07:10.231
<v Speaker 1>when they got him,</v>

261
00:07:10.231 --> 00:07:13.140
<v Speaker 1>got him to confess on camera and he confessed.</v>

262
00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Not only was he turning a blind eye,</v>

263
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.000
<v Speaker 1>not only was he carrying out murders,</v>

264
00:07:18.001 --> 00:07:21.150
<v Speaker 1>he was training the young kids how to the capitate people,</v>

265
00:07:21.151 --> 00:07:22.080
<v Speaker 1>how to cut people up.</v>

266
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.910
<v Speaker 1>And it was expanding in graphic detail how he like in a,</v>

267
00:07:26.911 --> 00:07:28.500
<v Speaker 1>how they managed to cut limbs off.</v>

268
00:07:28.501 --> 00:07:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Halle gets young people train the cut limbs off to get them to lose their fear.</v>

269
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.240
<v Speaker 1>So that's the level of corruption that could be a policeman you're dealing with</v>

270
00:07:36.241 --> 00:07:37.650
<v Speaker 1>and that's really who they are.</v>

271
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

272
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.540
<v Speaker 1>so that's one of the craziest things about a corruption down there.</v>

273
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Did you have any hazards</v>

274
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.600
<v Speaker 2>Tinsey in getting involved in narco journalism knowingness?</v>

275
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would imagine that's one of the most dangerous</v>

276
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:54.820
<v Speaker 1>avenues to pursue in journalism.</v>

277
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.710
<v Speaker 1>So this was little by little,</v>

278
00:07:56.711 --> 00:07:57.790
<v Speaker 1>I got involved in cover knee,</v>

279
00:07:57.791 --> 00:07:58.590
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>

280
00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.030
<v Speaker 1>like going back to 2000 and this hadn't happened,</v>

281
00:08:01.031 --> 00:08:02.140
<v Speaker 1>this war hadn't happened.</v>

282
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.930
<v Speaker 1>It was still like a crime issue at that moment.</v>

283
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.390
<v Speaker 1>So I began to cover these things.</v>

284
00:08:07.391 --> 00:08:12.391
<v Speaker 1>And then around 2004 I got a job for the Houston chronicle out of Houston,</v>

285
00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:12.971
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>

286
00:08:12.971 --> 00:08:13.804
<v Speaker 1>I was covering,</v>

287
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.080
<v Speaker 1>I was a string of covering Mexico for them and I flew up to a lot to Nuevo</v>

288
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Laredo and there was a turf war beginning there,</v>

289
00:08:23.681 --> 00:08:25.750
<v Speaker 1>which is really the beginning of the drug war,</v>

290
00:08:25.751 --> 00:08:27.540
<v Speaker 1>which is toward Mexico.</v>

291
00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Part began on the border with Texas in this city called Nuevo Laredo.</v>

292
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.310
<v Speaker 1>Over the bridge from Laredo,</v>

293
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Texas back in 2004.</v>

294
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.690
<v Speaker 1>So there was a lot of interest from the Texas newspapers,</v>

295
00:08:40.691 --> 00:08:43.300
<v Speaker 1>what was going on as a whole bunch of bodies piling up there.</v>

296
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.061
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

297
00:08:45.061 --> 00:08:47.590
<v Speaker 1>it's going back to these days and this is kind of innocent looking back,</v>

298
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:47.951
<v Speaker 1>innocent,</v>

299
00:08:47.951 --> 00:08:50.860
<v Speaker 1>looking at myself then an innocent looking at what Mexico is like.</v>

300
00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:52.660
<v Speaker 1>Then they would simply say,</v>

301
00:08:52.661 --> 00:08:54.640
<v Speaker 1>go to the place I draw up the Monterey,</v>

302
00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:00.410
<v Speaker 1>rent a car and just drive the car to Norbury either with bus by myself.</v>

303
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.180
<v Speaker 1>And now people just don't do that.</v>

304
00:09:03.181 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 1>This is too much crazy stuff going on.</v>

305
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 1>But back then it was still light or you can just do that.</v>

306
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:08.791
<v Speaker 1>So there was,</v>

307
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:09.690
<v Speaker 1>you see crazy stuff.</v>

308
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of crazy stuff?</v>

309
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:11.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

310
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:14.960
<v Speaker 1>now you can get stopped by an armed group driving on those roads.</v>

311
00:09:14.961 --> 00:09:15.271
<v Speaker 1>He could,</v>

312
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:18.570
<v Speaker 1>you could just drive along and it could be a group of guys with guns could stop</v>

313
00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:18.901
<v Speaker 1>the car,</v>

314
00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:19.651
<v Speaker 1>get someone out,</v>

315
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:20.550
<v Speaker 1>takes take your way.</v>

316
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:20.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

317
00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:23.880
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole people a lot more careful about,</v>

318
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:24.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

319
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:24.750
<v Speaker 1>where you are now.</v>

320
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:25.091
<v Speaker 1>Now when,</v>

321
00:09:25.091 --> 00:09:25.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

322
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.310
<v Speaker 1>when you move around the roads,</v>

323
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.800
<v Speaker 1>you can be very careful how you move and how you plan this stuff.</v>

324
00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:30.600
<v Speaker 1>You don't just wander by yourself.</v>

325
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Dry ran these places.</v>

326
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:33.991
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

327
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:36.450
<v Speaker 1>so back then when this was happening and um,</v>

328
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.561
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

329
00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:38.394
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

330
00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.160
<v Speaker 1>this body's turning up and was trying to figure out why and,</v>

331
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.641
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

332
00:09:41.641 --> 00:09:41.791
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

333
00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:45.180
<v Speaker 1>there was one guy I interviewed who was a head of chamber of Commerce.</v>

334
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

335
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:47.161
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

336
00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:47.561
<v Speaker 1>talk to me,</v>

337
00:09:47.561 --> 00:09:47.700
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

338
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:48.533
<v Speaker 1>very interesting guy.</v>

339
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.970
<v Speaker 1>About a couple of weeks later,</v>

340
00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:54.270
<v Speaker 1>he became the chief of police for the city and they asked him and said,</v>

341
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:55.104
<v Speaker 1>are you scared?</v>

342
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.453
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

343
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:56.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

344
00:09:56.881 --> 00:09:57.870
<v Speaker 1>you scared about being killed?</v>

345
00:09:57.871 --> 00:09:58.021
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

346
00:09:58.021 --> 00:09:58.111
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

347
00:09:58.111 --> 00:09:58.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not scared.</v>

348
00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:59.970
<v Speaker 1>It's under the corrupt people who get killed.</v>

349
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:05.100
<v Speaker 1>And he was shot dead six hours after he gave that statement,</v>

350
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:06.900
<v Speaker 1>they shot him dead.</v>

351
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.730
<v Speaker 1>And that was one of the real markers.</v>

352
00:10:08.731 --> 00:10:10.590
<v Speaker 1>If something really strange is going on in Mexico,</v>

353
00:10:10.591 --> 00:10:13.440
<v Speaker 1>something is like going to erupt in Mexico.</v>

354
00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

355
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.820
<v Speaker 1>and then from there it kind of just escalated and escalated and,</v>

356
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:18.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

357
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.370
<v Speaker 1>started working by the other media,</v>

358
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.451
<v Speaker 1>Time magazine,</v>

359
00:10:21.451 --> 00:10:23.640
<v Speaker 1>New York Times different people.</v>

360
00:10:23.641 --> 00:10:24.421
<v Speaker 1>Enough to what I said,</v>

361
00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:24.970
<v Speaker 1>I can't do the,</v>

362
00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.280
<v Speaker 1>I can't just write new stories about this.</v>

363
00:10:27.281 --> 00:10:30.000
<v Speaker 1>I've got to write books about this because this stuff is big and it's</v>

364
00:10:30.001 --> 00:10:30.834
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>

365
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.400
<v Speaker 1>It must be immensely complicated for the people that live there.</v>

366
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.140
<v Speaker 1>It seems like there's no escape.</v>

367
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:38.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

368
00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:38.620
<v Speaker 1>if</v>

369
00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.880
<v Speaker 2>you can't turn to the police,</v>

370
00:10:39.881 --> 00:10:41.470
<v Speaker 2>the police are the cartel.</v>

371
00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:42.700
<v Speaker 2>There's the cartel,</v>

372
00:10:42.701 --> 00:10:43.534
<v Speaker 2>the police,</v>

373
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.490
<v Speaker 2>all the politicians,</v>

374
00:10:45.491 --> 00:10:47.140
<v Speaker 2>most likely if they're alive,</v>

375
00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:48.520
<v Speaker 2>have to be compromised.</v>

376
00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

377
00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:50.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

378
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:51.850
<v Speaker 1>there's been some varied,</v>

379
00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:53.320
<v Speaker 1>very desperate people and I mean,</v>

380
00:10:53.321 --> 00:10:55.480
<v Speaker 1>there's been some bird has been some inspirational people as well.</v>

381
00:10:55.481 --> 00:10:56.051
<v Speaker 1>Fight in this.</v>

382
00:10:56.051 --> 00:10:56.920
<v Speaker 1>There's been heroes.</v>

383
00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.173
<v Speaker 1>There are heroes.</v>

384
00:10:59.050 --> 00:10:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

385
00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.140
<v Speaker 1>just to get more of a sense of what that means on the ground as well.</v>

386
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

387
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:02.551
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

388
00:11:02.551 --> 00:11:02.860
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

389
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.180
<v Speaker 1>and some of the things you see,</v>

390
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:05.771
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

00:11:05.771 --> 00:11:06.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

392
00:11:06.071 --> 00:11:08.290
<v Speaker 1>some of the things that stay with me in Africa for a while,</v>

393
00:11:08.291 --> 00:11:09.730
<v Speaker 1>it was quite romantic covering this.</v>

394
00:11:09.731 --> 00:11:10.061
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

395
00:11:10.061 --> 00:11:10.301

402
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.170
<v Speaker 1>these crazy people,</v>

403
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.040
<v Speaker 1>but then you start seeing that the human pain in all of this.</v>

404
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>she was in our home with our two children in Monterrey and a,</v>

415

<v Speaker 1>it was like in the night,</v>

421
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.230
<v Speaker 1>didn't know how to apply.</v>

<v Speaker 1>How do I reply to that?</v>

427
00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:12.850
<v Speaker 1>She just couldn't speak.</v>

428
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:14.101

431
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:20.590
<v Speaker 1>the 18 year old was a philosophy student and he said,</v>

432
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

437
00:12:30.031 --> 00:12:30.864
<v Speaker 1>can we got your sign?</v>

438
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.661
<v Speaker 1>Give us this amount of money.</v>

439
00:12:31.661 --> 00:12:32.494
<v Speaker 1>We'll give them back.</v>

440
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.590
<v Speaker 1>So she went round to like relatives just got the money.</v>

441
00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:36.940
<v Speaker 1>She wanted to get the money right away.</v>

442
00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:39.100
<v Speaker 1>She turned up with the money,</v>

443
00:12:39.101 --> 00:12:39.731
<v Speaker 1>gave some money,</v>

444
00:12:39.731 --> 00:12:42.670
<v Speaker 1>and then they just cut off the calls and she hadn't heard from him since.</v>

445
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:44.610
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

446
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:45.910
<v Speaker 1>I said miss seeing her face,</v>

447
00:12:45.911 --> 00:12:49.160
<v Speaker 1>the devastation and the page that I,</v>

448
00:12:49.161 --> 00:12:49.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

449
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:49.840
<v Speaker 1>just couldn't,</v>

450
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.910
<v Speaker 1>couldn't go on with life after that and just not knowing,</v>

451
00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:52.900
<v Speaker 1>not having the closure.</v>

452
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:58.590
<v Speaker 1>And I met her when I went to report on one of the worst atrocities,</v>

453
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.070
<v Speaker 1>which was 49 borders,</v>

454
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:08.550
<v Speaker 1>who'd all been decapitated or had their hands and feet cut off and all been</v>

455
00:13:09.161 --> 00:13:12.020
<v Speaker 1>dumped on a road and they would take them to the Morgan.</v>

456
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Monta Ryan arrived in the morgue.</v>

457
00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:14.531
<v Speaker 1>I was inside.</v>

458
00:13:14.531 --> 00:13:19.300
<v Speaker 1>The more to smelling the smell of the dead bodies is kind of weird smell you get</v>

459
00:13:19.301 --> 00:13:20.530
<v Speaker 1>from like decaying flesh,</v>

460
00:13:20.531 --> 00:13:23.980
<v Speaker 1>kind of a sweet smell you get from when you're around those places where you can</v>

461
00:13:23.981 --> 00:13:28.600
<v Speaker 1>smell that the body is the k and I was inside the Morgan a came out is outside</v>

462
00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:30.670
<v Speaker 1>the morgue and she was trying to see if,</v>

463
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.470
<v Speaker 1>if her son might be among those people,</v>

464
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:33.993
<v Speaker 1>among those bodies.</v>

465
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.553
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

466
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.651
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

467
00:13:40.651 --> 00:13:41.484
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

468
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.780
<v Speaker 2>it's so insane that this is right next door to America and there's so little</v>

469
00:13:45.781 --> 00:13:48.780
<v Speaker 2>effort put on doing something about it,</v>

470
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:54.200
<v Speaker 2>including doing something to mitigate the influence of illegal drugs by making</v>

471
00:13:55.951 --> 00:13:56.784
<v Speaker 2>drugs legal.</v>

472
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.491
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

473
00:13:57.491 --> 00:13:59.580
<v Speaker 2>that would be one gigantic step.</v>

474
00:13:59.581 --> 00:13:59.760
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

475
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.160
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to stop people from doing drugs.</v>

476
00:14:02.161 --> 00:14:02.341
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

477
00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:03.750
<v Speaker 2>this is an illogical,</v>

478
00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:05.310
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous approach.</v>

479
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people should do most of those drugs,</v>

480
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.800
<v Speaker 2>but when you make drugs illegal,</v>

481
00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.050
<v Speaker 2>only criminals are going to sell those drugs.</v>

482
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.970
<v Speaker 2>And this is exactly what you have right next door to American.</v>

483
00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.830
<v Speaker 2>It's just unbelievably insane that there's this amount of crime.</v>

484
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.950
<v Speaker 2>A drive away from San Antonio.</v>

485
00:14:22.951 --> 00:14:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

486
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:23.951
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

487
00:14:23.951 --> 00:14:27.010
<v Speaker 1>And talking about that issue of the money and the economics of days.</v>

488
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.990
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

489
00:14:28.991 --> 00:14:29.890
<v Speaker 1>you look at cocaine,</v>

490
00:14:29.891 --> 00:14:30.730
<v Speaker 1>so you could say you've got the,</v>

491
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.590
<v Speaker 1>there was four main drugs,</v>

492
00:14:32.591 --> 00:14:33.011
<v Speaker 1>now it's,</v>

493
00:14:33.011 --> 00:14:34.480
<v Speaker 1>you've got fentanyl coming in as well,</v>

494
00:14:34.481 --> 00:14:34.770
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

495
00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.190
<v Speaker 1>and the cartels and making fentanyl,</v>

496
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.780
<v Speaker 1>they're making it,</v>

497
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:38.500
<v Speaker 1>making it yet.</v>

498
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.450
<v Speaker 1>And I made it and making it bring in precursors,</v>

499
00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:41.860
<v Speaker 1>making it as a lab.</v>

500
00:14:41.861 --> 00:14:42.400
<v Speaker 1>One lab,</v>

501
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.330
<v Speaker 1>I was in Nogales,</v>

502
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:44.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

503
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.560
<v Speaker 1>about a year and a half ago,</v>

504
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.440
<v Speaker 1>they passed a lab in Nogales rotten the border.</v>

505
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.590
<v Speaker 1>They'll make them have the lab they're making the finet Fenton in and bring up</v>

506
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:51.703
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>

507
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.930
<v Speaker 1>but as well as that you've got out of the four main drugs,</v>

508
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.450
<v Speaker 1>historically a marijuana,</v>

509
00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.633
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

510
00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.633
<v Speaker 1>heroin,</v>

511
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:59.990
<v Speaker 1>cocaine and crystal meth.</v>

512
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.360
<v Speaker 1>And this goes back a hundred years.</v>

513
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Like so Sinhala,</v>

514
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.230
<v Speaker 1>which is the cradle of Mexican drug trafficking.</v>

515
00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.430
<v Speaker 1>It's in the low,</v>

516
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:10.610
<v Speaker 1>is a bit like Sicily as to the Mafia and likes in an arrest and a Mexican drug</v>

517
00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:11.960
<v Speaker 1>cartels where it began.</v>

518
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:18.040
<v Speaker 1>And it began right to go back to 1914 you had in the u s to Harrison's narcotics</v>

519
00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:21.890
<v Speaker 1>tax act when they made a,</v>

520
00:15:21.891 --> 00:15:25.040
<v Speaker 1>they restricted opium and cocaine in the United States.</v>

521
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:27.620
<v Speaker 1>And from 1915,</v>

522
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.560
<v Speaker 1>they began a cross border trade from Mexico to the United States.</v>

523
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.600
<v Speaker 1>So that's when it started all the way back then.</v>

524
00:15:32.601 --> 00:15:33.680
<v Speaker 1>So over a hundred years ago,</v>

525
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.380
<v Speaker 1>some of the very first people doing it,</v>

526
00:15:36.381 --> 00:15:38.240
<v Speaker 1>we're actually Chinese Mexicans.</v>

527
00:15:38.241 --> 00:15:40.940
<v Speaker 1>They were Chinese immigrants that arrive in Mexico.</v>

528
00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:41.870
<v Speaker 1>They began doing this,</v>

529
00:15:41.871 --> 00:15:42.740
<v Speaker 1>they bought opium,</v>

530
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:43.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

531
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:44.330
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

532
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:45.610
<v Speaker 1>from China planted in,</v>

533
00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.453
<v Speaker 1>in Mexico.</v>

534
00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.580
<v Speaker 1>And some of the first people receiving it with Chinese Americans.</v>

535
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Some of these very early cases,</v>

536
00:15:50.781 --> 00:15:54.800
<v Speaker 1>a case from 1916 investigated his documents about this case where there was</v>

537
00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Chinese Mexicans trafficking to Chinese Americans here in California.</v>

538
00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.810
<v Speaker 1>And at that time there was a governor of Baja,</v>

539
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:01.820
<v Speaker 1>California involved.</v>

540
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:02.841
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

541
00:16:02.841 --> 00:16:03.674
<v Speaker 1>right back then.</v>

542
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:05.720
<v Speaker 1>What is the solution?</v>

543
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Is there any solutions to this?</v>

544
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:08.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

545
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:09.373
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

546
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:10.161
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

547
00:16:10.161 --> 00:16:10.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

548
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:11.630
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people covering this,</v>

549
00:16:11.631 --> 00:16:12.530
<v Speaker 1>you get very weary.</v>

550
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 1>You want to see solutions.</v>

551
00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.353
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

552
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:19.430
<v Speaker 1>you want to find solutions and you want to come with that optimism of finding</v>

553
00:16:19.431 --> 00:16:21.890
<v Speaker 1>solutions and you want to justify why you're doing this.</v>

554
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.030
<v Speaker 1>What you're doing is for not just to tell the stories but to look for solutions</v>

555
00:16:26.031 --> 00:16:26.864
<v Speaker 1>to this.</v>

556
00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

557
00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:28.011
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

558
00:16:28.011 --> 00:16:28.821
<v Speaker 1>it gets worried about that.</v>

559
00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:29.990
<v Speaker 1>There's three areas.</v>

560
00:16:29.991 --> 00:16:31.370
<v Speaker 1>I believe that our traditions first,</v>

561
00:16:31.371 --> 00:16:34.670
<v Speaker 1>I do agree with you on the idea of drug policy reform.</v>

562
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.381
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

563
00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:37.970
<v Speaker 1>it is tough uphill battle.</v>

564
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean going back to 2012 I wrote editorials about,</v>

565
00:16:41.571 --> 00:16:41.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

566
00:16:41.691 --> 00:16:45.710
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons you should legalize marijuana is because of the marijuana</v>

567
00:16:45.711 --> 00:16:46.431
<v Speaker 1>come from Mexico,</v>

568
00:16:46.431 --> 00:16:47.660
<v Speaker 1>which goes to cartels,</v>

569
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:49.520
<v Speaker 1>which pays killers,</v>

570
00:16:49.521 --> 00:16:50.720
<v Speaker 1>which pays for corruption.</v>

571
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.300
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>

572
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.160
<v Speaker 1>marijuana,</v>

573
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.941
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>

574
00:16:55.941 --> 00:16:56.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

575
00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.580
<v Speaker 1>love is legalized in the United States and the violence has,</v>

576
00:16:58.581 --> 00:17:00.110
<v Speaker 1>she just got worse in Mexico.</v>

577
00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:02.740
<v Speaker 1>So you've also got the issue of heroin,</v>

578
00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.093
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

579
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.090
<v Speaker 1>cocaine,</v>

580
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.131
<v Speaker 1>crystal Meth,</v>

581
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:07.964
<v Speaker 1>fentanyl,</v>

582
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.970
<v Speaker 1>and you've got the cartels are going to bunch of other rackets now.</v>

583
00:17:10.971 --> 00:17:12.270
<v Speaker 1>They're still crude oil,</v>

584
00:17:12.271 --> 00:17:13.160
<v Speaker 1>which is a big deal.</v>

585
00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.060
<v Speaker 1>They still billions of dollars worth of crude oil criminals down there from</v>

586
00:17:17.061 --> 00:17:20.180
<v Speaker 1>pipelines can tap into a pipeline or something.</v>

587
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:20.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

588
00:17:20.421 --> 00:17:21.740
<v Speaker 1>You kind of pipeline you have,</v>

589
00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.240
<v Speaker 1>you'd normally put in two taps.</v>

590
00:17:23.241 --> 00:17:24.680
<v Speaker 1>You drill two holes in the pipeline,</v>

591
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.620
<v Speaker 1>you drill a hole to put,</v>

592
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.581
<v Speaker 1>to take the oil out,</v>

593
00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:31.200
<v Speaker 1>you'd drill a hole to put water in to try and keep it equal.</v>

594
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

595
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:32.743
<v Speaker 1>the pressure,</v>

596
00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:36.420
<v Speaker 1>the same Dev you saw as a crazy video recently of a,</v>

597
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:36.711
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

598
00:17:36.711 --> 00:17:38.480
<v Speaker 1>in a small town in Mexico where a bunch of,</v>

599
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.040
<v Speaker 1>there was a tap open of really,</v>

600
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:41.060
<v Speaker 1>really bad tap,</v>

601
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:45.530
<v Speaker 1>the origins spraying out and a bunch of people were lining up just to pick up</v>

602
00:17:45.531 --> 00:17:49.810
<v Speaker 1>the oil from the pipeline and exploded and just,</v>

603
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.120
<v Speaker 1>it was just like crazy death toll.</v>

604
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:52.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

605
00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:53.850
<v Speaker 1>I did see that from,</v>

606
00:17:53.851 --> 00:17:54.091
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

607
00:17:54.091 --> 00:17:54.924
<v Speaker 1>from Nada,</v>

608
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:56.640
<v Speaker 1>but a bad way that I do believe in,</v>

609
00:17:56.641 --> 00:17:57.121
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

610
00:17:57.121 --> 00:17:58.170
<v Speaker 1>in drug policy reform,</v>

611
00:17:58.171 --> 00:17:58.891
<v Speaker 1>we have to talk about,</v>

612
00:17:58.891 --> 00:17:59.940
<v Speaker 1>this has to be on a table.</v>

613
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:00.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

614
00:18:00.691 --> 00:18:01.201
<v Speaker 1>Americans,</v>

615
00:18:01.201 --> 00:18:01.321
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

616
00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:01.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

617
00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:03.870
<v Speaker 1>no one knows really what American spend on drugs,</v>

618
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.820
<v Speaker 1>but as the survey are where you can find on line if you just tap and what do</v>

619
00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Americans spend on illegal drugs?</v>

620
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.040
<v Speaker 1>And it is an estimate of $100 billion a year.</v>

621
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

622
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:16.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

623
00:18:16.351 --> 00:18:18.210
<v Speaker 1>that amount of money I've been,</v>

624
00:18:18.211 --> 00:18:18.930
<v Speaker 1>that's an estimate.</v>

625
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:19.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

626
00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:19.860
<v Speaker 1>it could be right.</v>

627
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:20.011
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

628
00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:21.510
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to know how it's a very round number,</v>

629
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.820
<v Speaker 1>but like $100 billion a year.</v>

630
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:24.391
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

631
00:18:24.391 --> 00:18:27.450
<v Speaker 1>if you think about that pumping into these cartels year after year,</v>

632
00:18:27.451 --> 00:18:27.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

633
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:28.523
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>

634
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.090
<v Speaker 1>You know how much of that,</v>

635
00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:34.710
<v Speaker 1>if it's 30 billion of that guide down in Mexico in over 10 years,</v>

636
00:18:34.711 --> 00:18:36.900
<v Speaker 1>300 billion over 30 years,</v>

637
00:18:36.901 --> 00:18:38.160
<v Speaker 1>close to a trillion dollars,</v>

638
00:18:38.161 --> 00:18:39.360
<v Speaker 1>that really creates this,</v>

639
00:18:39.361 --> 00:18:40.194
<v Speaker 1>this monster,</v>

640
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:41.970
<v Speaker 1>but know a secondary.</v>

641
00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:43.680
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not believe in drug policy reform.</v>

642
00:18:43.681 --> 00:18:43.861
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

643
00:18:43.861 --> 00:18:44.694
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how,</v>

644
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean Rehab,</v>

645
00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.690
<v Speaker 1>they want to needs it because heroin addicts by lot of heroin.</v>

646
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.230
<v Speaker 1>So every one you save from that you can,</v>

647
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:52.681
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

648
00:18:52.681 --> 00:18:52.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

649
00:18:52.921 --> 00:18:55.350
<v Speaker 1>you can stop a lot of heroin and a lot of that money.</v>

650
00:18:55.351 --> 00:18:57.810
<v Speaker 1>What does money goes to these people who are doing this stuff.</v>

651
00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.680
<v Speaker 1>But a second area I believe is his social work.</v>

652
00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

653
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:03.000
<v Speaker 1>in the neighborhoods.</v>

654
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

655
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.011
<v Speaker 1>like I've talked to,</v>

656
00:19:05.011 --> 00:19:08.160
<v Speaker 1>I've done a lot of interviews with particularly with the assassins,</v>

657
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:13.220
<v Speaker 1>with the killers in cartels in Mexico and also around Latin America.</v>

658
00:19:13.651 --> 00:19:15.360
<v Speaker 1>I've been traveling around Jamaica,</v>

659
00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:16.981
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>

660
00:19:16.981 --> 00:19:17.850
<v Speaker 1>Central America,</v>

661
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:18.570
<v Speaker 1>Colombia,</v>

662
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.220
<v Speaker 1>talking to a lot of the killers especially.</v>

663
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.460
<v Speaker 1>And when I sit down with them,</v>

664
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:23.880
<v Speaker 1>I try and get their life story.</v>

665
00:19:23.881 --> 00:19:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Like how did they first get into this because you're not born doing this stuff.</v>

666
00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:29.880
<v Speaker 1>And often,</v>

667
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:30.301
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

668
00:19:30.301 --> 00:19:32.430
<v Speaker 1>in some cases that is the different profiles.</v>

669
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:33.353
<v Speaker 1>There's some of them,</v>

670
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:35.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

671
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:36.323
<v Speaker 1>in noticed one,</v>

672
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:37.170
<v Speaker 1>one guy,</v>

673
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.430
<v Speaker 1>this is done in Honduras,</v>

674
00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.140
<v Speaker 1>which is also crazy situation,</v>

675
00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.181
<v Speaker 1>was a guy there.</v>

676
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:46.110
<v Speaker 1>I actually met him before I'd met him when I was doing some reporting down there</v>

677
00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:47.190
<v Speaker 1>back in 2015.</v>

678
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:52.670
<v Speaker 1>And he was driving for us and he was also carrying a gun to help protect us as</v>

679
00:19:54.121 --> 00:19:55.410
<v Speaker 1>with the journeys to that I had had,</v>

680
00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:56.830
<v Speaker 1>had been hit before.</v>

681
00:19:56.831 --> 00:19:58.170
<v Speaker 1>We've been actually shot before.</v>

682
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:00.001
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

683
00:20:00.001 --> 00:20:00.834
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

684
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.450
<v Speaker 1>then I met him again afterwards and gone to tell his story,</v>

685
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.730
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of typical of a lot of these guys.</v>

686
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:11.900
<v Speaker 1>And he described how he been abandoned as a kid by his parents and had this real</v>

687
00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:20.400
<v Speaker 1>hate that he had with the world.</v>

688
00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:21.091
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

689
00:20:21.091 --> 00:20:22.110
<v Speaker 1>and I just fucked a world.</v>

690
00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

691
00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:28.380
<v Speaker 1>and he described the first time that he carried out murders.</v>

692
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

693
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:29.730
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

694
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:30.271
<v Speaker 1>this is us though.</v>

695
00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:31.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm an he carried out.</v>

696
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.420
<v Speaker 1>They already doc,</v>

697
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:37.140
<v Speaker 1>he documented all these hits he'd done and to capitations he'd done in his kind</v>

698
00:20:37.141 --> 00:20:37.974
<v Speaker 1>of crazy stuff.</v>

699
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.010
<v Speaker 1>But the first time a cat it,</v>

700
00:20:40.011 --> 00:20:40.970
<v Speaker 1>a murder was probably the,</v>

701
00:20:40.971 --> 00:20:41.181
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

702
00:20:41.181 --> 00:20:45.520
<v Speaker 1>the freakiest when he was I think 14 and they got a,</v>

703
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.470
<v Speaker 1>a family,</v>

704
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.550
<v Speaker 1>they went into a house,</v>

705
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:49.151
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't a lot.</v>

706
00:20:49.151 --> 00:20:51.070
<v Speaker 1>They've got family and they butchered a family.</v>

707
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.350
<v Speaker 1>And he described when he described that and then described later on,</v>

708
00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:56.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

709
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:58.540
<v Speaker 1>how he became a higher killer.</v>

710
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.180
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about him,</v>

711
00:21:01.181 --> 00:21:03.010
<v Speaker 1>like some of these people you think they're psychopaths,</v>

712
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:03.361
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

713
00:21:03.361 --> 00:21:05.080
<v Speaker 1>they really don't care.</v>

714
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.160
<v Speaker 1>But some of them really do have these conflicts inside the heart.</v>

715
00:21:09.161 --> 00:21:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I think he was someone or a list of back to that interview and he had,</v>

716
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:14.500
<v Speaker 1>and it's hard to,</v>

717
00:21:14.501 --> 00:21:19.210
<v Speaker 1>to balance that someone who does evil but also has it been a victim as well,</v>

718
00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:20.440
<v Speaker 1>a victim and the victimizer.</v>

719
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:22.600
<v Speaker 1>And you feel that pain since,</v>

720
00:21:22.601 --> 00:21:24.490
<v Speaker 1>since then he himself been been murdered.</v>

721
00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.373
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

722
00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:26.740
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

723
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:26.951
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

724
00:21:26.951 --> 00:21:27.360
<v Speaker 1>he's uh,</v>

725
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:27.571
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

726
00:21:27.571 --> 00:21:28.161
<v Speaker 1>you know one,</v>

727
00:21:28.161 --> 00:21:32.650
<v Speaker 1>so how you get social work to reach people from a very young age because often</v>

728
00:21:32.651 --> 00:21:34.840
<v Speaker 1>they are recruited into organized crime when they're 12,</v>

729
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.760
<v Speaker 1>13 years old.</v>

730
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.260
<v Speaker 1>So he butchered his family when was 14 when it was his stealing money from them.</v>

731
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:42.610
<v Speaker 1>So the story would,</v>

732
00:21:42.611 --> 00:21:43.190
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

733
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:47.220
<v Speaker 1>he said that he was hanging around with these basically street kids and one of</v>

734
00:21:47.221 --> 00:21:48.054
<v Speaker 1>the other kids said,</v>

735
00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.930
<v Speaker 1>I know where there's some money in a house,</v>

736
00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.300
<v Speaker 1>we can get some money in a house.</v>

737
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:58.050
<v Speaker 1>So they went in there and killed his family and it turned out there was no money</v>

738
00:21:59.381 --> 00:21:59.710
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

739
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:03.250
<v Speaker 1>And the reason the other kid had said go there was because he'd actually been</v>

740
00:22:03.251 --> 00:22:06.550
<v Speaker 1>living with his family and he said they'd been abusive to him.</v>

741
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.180
<v Speaker 1>So he wanted to like Rivett have revenge on his family.</v>

742
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Well what was so really sick of that is to when he was describing it was they</v>

743
00:22:14.861 --> 00:22:19.861
<v Speaker 1>had this family and they would to stop them defending themselves.</v>

744
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.690
<v Speaker 1>They would like take them one by one,</v>

745
00:22:22.691 --> 00:22:23.411
<v Speaker 1>like pin him in a,</v>

746
00:22:23.411 --> 00:22:24.790
<v Speaker 1>in a room and take them one by one.</v>

747
00:22:24.791 --> 00:22:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I'd take them out,</v>

748
00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:29.560
<v Speaker 1>butchered them how the other ones didn't really know what was going on and</v>

749
00:22:29.561 --> 00:22:29.921
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

750
00:22:29.921 --> 00:22:31.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean the action itself,</v>

751
00:22:31.481 --> 00:22:34.120
<v Speaker 1>but how like teenage kids can think about that stuff.</v>

752
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:37.820
<v Speaker 1>And then later on when he was talking about the uh,</v>

753
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:43.180
<v Speaker 1>decapitations he was talking about they get contracts with the capitation inside</v>

754
00:22:43.181 --> 00:22:43.901
<v Speaker 1>the quite like they say,</v>

755
00:22:43.901 --> 00:22:44.470
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

756
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:45.430
<v Speaker 1>we want this killing.</v>

757
00:22:45.431 --> 00:22:46.780
<v Speaker 1>We wanted to to capitate a guy,</v>

758
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:48.340
<v Speaker 1>we want this doc,</v>

759
00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:50.520
<v Speaker 1>we want to see video of the guy being the cap tech.</v>

760
00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:51.880
<v Speaker 1>We want that.</v>

761
00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.720
<v Speaker 1>We want the guy to suffer.</v>

762
00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.930
<v Speaker 1>And when he hacks the heads off,</v>

763
00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:02.560
<v Speaker 1>dare sometimes still be a moment when like when the life goes out of them and</v>

764
00:23:02.631 --> 00:23:03.770
<v Speaker 1>when the body is still luck.</v>

765
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.633
<v Speaker 1>Twitching.</v>

766
00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Lucky says they can still see like was there's a bit like nerves.</v>

767
00:23:08.181 --> 00:23:09.014
<v Speaker 1>It was like a chicken,</v>

768
00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:10.100
<v Speaker 1>like a headless chicken.</v>

769
00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:13.220
<v Speaker 1>There's a bit as a part when he's still like twitching a bit,</v>

770
00:23:13.221 --> 00:23:15.410
<v Speaker 1>even after day or you know,</v>

771
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.360
<v Speaker 1>they've lost a kind of seven there,</v>

772
00:23:17.361 --> 00:23:18.194
<v Speaker 1>connections there.</v>

773
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:20.263
<v Speaker 3>Ooh.</v>

774
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.400
<v Speaker 1>Now when you're interviewing these people,</v>

775
00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.230
<v Speaker 1>how nervous are you?</v>

776
00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean this seems like if you're putting all this stuff down,</v>

777
00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:33.970
<v Speaker 1>you could implicate them in some crimes and it seems like it would be very</v>

778
00:23:33.971 --> 00:23:35.800
<v Speaker 1>convenient for them to try to get rid of you.</v>

779
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:37.060
<v Speaker 1>So is,</v>

780
00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.600
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole bunch of different situations around interview.</v>

781
00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:40.181
<v Speaker 1>So some labs,</v>

782
00:23:40.181 --> 00:23:41.410
<v Speaker 1>I've interviewed people in prisons,</v>

783
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.490
<v Speaker 1>a lot of time in prisons.</v>

784
00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

785
00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:43.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

786
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.980
<v Speaker 1>this took me years to,</v>

787
00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 1>to get to a lot of these people.</v>

788
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:46.940
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

789
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:47.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

790
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:48.290
<v Speaker 1>W it wasn't like,</v>

791
00:23:48.291 --> 00:23:49.124
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

792
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:49.581
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

793
00:23:49.581 --> 00:23:51.170
<v Speaker 1>when I first started doing this I was like,</v>

794
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:51.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

795
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:51.921
<v Speaker 1>how do I get,</v>

796
00:23:51.921 --> 00:23:55.130
<v Speaker 1>how do I reach them and start going around to drug rehab places and talking to</v>

797
00:23:55.131 --> 00:23:56.120
<v Speaker 1>people in Drug Rehab?</v>

798
00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm going into prisons and NCLR wireless.</v>

799
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:03.080
<v Speaker 1>I did a lot of interviews in and in one prison I got to know a lot of prisoners</v>

800
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:08.660
<v Speaker 1>and the prisoners [inaudible] in a Christian evangelical wing there and they</v>

801
00:24:08.661 --> 00:24:10.580
<v Speaker 1>were going through this weird Christian in.</v>

802
00:24:10.581 --> 00:24:15.581
<v Speaker 1>I like Christina in a discovery of God there and then through the street on the</v>

803
00:24:15.891 --> 00:24:16.311
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>

804
00:24:16.311 --> 00:24:17.690
<v Speaker 1>often light through content.</v>

805
00:24:17.691 --> 00:24:19.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're old time through contacts on the street.</v>

806
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

807
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.190
<v Speaker 1>and in Honduras,</v>

808
00:24:22.191 --> 00:24:25.340
<v Speaker 1>a lot of great contacts with a friend is a journalist who grew up in his</v>

809
00:24:25.341 --> 00:24:25.701
<v Speaker 1>neighbors.</v>

810
00:24:25.701 --> 00:24:25.821
<v Speaker 1>We'd,</v>

811
00:24:25.821 --> 00:24:26.570
<v Speaker 1>all of these guys,</v>

812
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:27.051
<v Speaker 1>he just knows,</v>

813
00:24:27.051 --> 00:24:30.110
<v Speaker 1>knows that his guys from growing up now.</v>

814
00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:31.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

815
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:32.270
<v Speaker 1>there's different,</v>

816
00:24:32.271 --> 00:24:33.200
<v Speaker 1>different things,</v>

817
00:24:33.201 --> 00:24:34.640
<v Speaker 1>you know that have been bad situations.</v>

818
00:24:34.641 --> 00:24:37.120
<v Speaker 1>I think anybody covering this has had some bad situations.</v>

819
00:24:37.121 --> 00:24:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Sometime people get angry,</v>

820
00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:40.460
<v Speaker 1>people threatened them and so forth.</v>

821
00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:42.430
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of the time when it's,</v>

822
00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.880
<v Speaker 1>when you talk to people,</v>

823
00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:45.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

824
00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.520
<v Speaker 1>And one thing that you have to be very low Tom,</v>

825
00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:51.990
<v Speaker 1>you have to be very stringent about protecting the identity and really serious</v>

826
00:24:51.991 --> 00:24:56.700
<v Speaker 1>about that because there's been cases where various cases where other people</v>

827
00:24:56.701 --> 00:25:01.701
<v Speaker 1>have interviewed killers and shown their identity either through the [inaudible]</v>

828
00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:08.970
<v Speaker 1>face or through like some dumb thing being showed and they have been themselves</v>

829
00:25:10.321 --> 00:25:14.790
<v Speaker 1>murdered in a butchered after these x given these interviews or like other</v>

830
00:25:14.791 --> 00:25:15.541
<v Speaker 1>things are happened,</v>

831
00:25:15.541 --> 00:25:18.120
<v Speaker 1>they'd been threatened or something to family or arrested or Sifo.</v>

832
00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.030
<v Speaker 1>So you really got to protect people's identities.</v>

833
00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:22.883
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

834
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:28.070
<v Speaker 1>In a way in terms of when they talk and stuff and I didn't really feel nervous</v>

835
00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:30.270
<v Speaker 1>when I need one of these people,</v>

836
00:25:30.271 --> 00:25:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I probably feel more nervous hit or come to you.</v>

837
00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.100
<v Speaker 1>That's just 40 kids.</v>

838
00:25:35.101 --> 00:25:36.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like all the other on a big show.</v>

839
00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:37.381
<v Speaker 1>It's a different,</v>

840
00:25:37.381 --> 00:25:40.200
<v Speaker 1>a different thing when you're like talking to</v>

841
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.121
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

842
00:25:42.121 --> 00:25:42.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

843
00:25:42.301 --> 00:25:43.470
<v Speaker 1>you start with easy questions,</v>

844
00:25:43.471 --> 00:25:43.951
<v Speaker 1>like anything,</v>

845
00:25:43.951 --> 00:25:47.940
<v Speaker 1>you start talking about how in a how you know people are human,</v>

846
00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:49.480
<v Speaker 1>they're human beings and people have got it.</v>

847
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:53.250
<v Speaker 1>People are complicated and I haven't just interviewed and I've also got drunk</v>

848
00:25:53.251 --> 00:25:55.120
<v Speaker 1>with somebody people and hung around with somebody.</v>

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

851
00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:57.780
<v Speaker 1>for times trying to get closer,</v>

852
00:25:57.781 --> 00:25:58.140
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

853

<v Speaker 1>sit down and do interviews and just leave.</v>

868
00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.193
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

869
00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:21.511
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

870
00:26:21.511 --> 00:26:21.661
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

871
00:26:21.661 --> 00:26:25.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a complicated world for them is it's their normality knows if for them is</v>

872
00:26:25.241 --> 00:26:25.940
<v Speaker 1>normal.</v>

873
00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

874
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:26.650
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

875
00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:27.580
<v Speaker 1>it's what they've,</v>

876
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:29.561
<v Speaker 1>what they've lived,</v>

877
00:26:29.561 --> 00:26:30.490
<v Speaker 1>what they've been through,</v>

878
00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:32.140
<v Speaker 1>what's happening around them.</v>

879
00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

880
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:33.940
<v Speaker 1>and this level of murder,</v>

881
00:26:33.941 --> 00:26:36.340
<v Speaker 1>this happened a lot of parts of Latin American now it's crazy.</v>

882
00:26:36.341 --> 00:26:37.930
<v Speaker 1>But in these areas is in his,</v>

883
00:26:37.931 --> 00:26:38.051
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

884
00:26:38.051 --> 00:26:40.660
<v Speaker 1>He talked to other people who had just on the edge of this,</v>

885
00:26:40.661 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 1>we'll have family members involved in this and it's just they're living this,</v>

886
00:26:44.071 --> 00:26:44.251
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

887
00:26:44.251 --> 00:26:47.280
<v Speaker 1>these are levels of violence and it's interesting to compare historically these</v>

888
00:26:47.281 --> 00:26:48.120
<v Speaker 1>levels of violence.</v>

889
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:49.663
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

890
00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.110
<v Speaker 1>because you look at some of the worst cities like San Pedro,</v>

891
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:55.740
<v Speaker 1>Sula on Doris Caracas harm Sierra wireless,</v>

892
00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:01.670
<v Speaker 1>and these are places which have levels of violence,</v>

893
00:27:01.741 --> 00:27:04.800
<v Speaker 1>which are like way worst in medieval Europe,</v>

894
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.720
<v Speaker 1>a lot based in medieval Europe.</v>

895
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:08.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

896
00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:12.930
<v Speaker 1>look at the figures per hundred thousand because some of them have over a</v>

897
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:12.930
<v Speaker 1>hundred,</v>

898
00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:13.110
<v Speaker 1>a hundred thousand,</v>

899
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.640
<v Speaker 1>150,</v>

900
00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.310
<v Speaker 1>100,000 and medieval Europe a lot.</v>

901
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.230
<v Speaker 1>These cities were like 20 per hundred thousand.</v>

902
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:19.643
<v Speaker 1>So they're way worse,</v>

903
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.870
<v Speaker 1>way worse in the wild west than like now there are some place in the United</v>

904
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.871
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

905
00:27:23.871 --> 00:27:24.440
<v Speaker 1>the de la.</v>

906
00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:24.551
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

907
00:27:24.551 --> 00:27:28.440
<v Speaker 1>And I did and I've done some research recently in Baltimore Marin hand and I was</v>

908
00:27:28.441 --> 00:27:28.670
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>

909
00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:33.420
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting to compare that to Latin America and that's a high level.</v>

910
00:27:33.421 --> 00:27:36.750
<v Speaker 1>That's 40 by a hundred thousands that's not as the same level,</v>

911
00:27:36.751 --> 00:27:39.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's significant still more than medieval Europe.</v>

912
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

913
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

914
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Baltimore is worse than Medieval Europe.</v>

915
00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:43.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

916
00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:43.691
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to ask.</v>

917
00:27:43.691 --> 00:27:43.951
<v Speaker 1>That gets,</v>

918
00:27:43.951 --> 00:27:47.340
<v Speaker 1>you have to have to do some professors then they weren't in a like you get like,</v>

919
00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:48.001
<v Speaker 1>you know they might be,</v>

920
00:27:48.001 --> 00:27:48.421
<v Speaker 1>they might say,</v>

921
00:27:48.421 --> 00:27:51.450
<v Speaker 1>well Jerusalem in this time or in a line I like,</v>

922
00:27:51.451 --> 00:27:54.570
<v Speaker 1>you've got to try and it's hard to note that it really dig down exact club net.</v>

923
00:27:54.571 --> 00:27:57.590
<v Speaker 1>There was outbreaks of violence and killing in certain places,</v>

924
00:27:57.591 --> 00:28:00.000
<v Speaker 1>but the overall average of all average year,</v>

925
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.320
<v Speaker 1>that's a significant leap.</v>

926
00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:02.980
<v Speaker 1>100% leap ea.</v>

927
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

928
00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Baltimore.</v>

929
00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.090
<v Speaker 1>What about South side of Chicago?</v>

930
00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:07.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not that,</v>

931
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:13.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean like the level I think in Chicago comes out around 20 or something,</v>

932
00:28:13.831 --> 00:28:16.950
<v Speaker 1>so it's not now the Emerg that of the whole city.</v>

933
00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:17.850
<v Speaker 1>Now these again,</v>

934
00:28:17.851 --> 00:28:21.300
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things about the violence in the United States compared to Latin</v>

935
00:28:21.301 --> 00:28:23.720
<v Speaker 1>America in Baltimore is,</v>

936
00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:23.981
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

937
00:28:23.981 --> 00:28:24.200
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

938
00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:28.590
<v Speaker 1>is significant bit of fairly what the city of Baltimore is a fairly small place</v>

939
00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.120
<v Speaker 1>where they're talking about.</v>

940
00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.570
<v Speaker 1>So in Mexico you have entire states that are like really violent or entire</v>

941
00:28:33.571 --> 00:28:35.400
<v Speaker 1>countries in Latin America,</v>

942
00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.460
<v Speaker 1>whereas in the u s it tends to be neighborhoods which are violent.</v>

943
00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:39.661
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

944
00:28:39.661 --> 00:28:42.290
<v Speaker 1>so if you really focus on the south side of Chicago,</v>

945
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.430
<v Speaker 1>it's probably similar levels to Baltimore.</v>

946
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:44.851
<v Speaker 1>Then,</v>

947
00:28:44.851 --> 00:28:45.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

948
00:28:45.071 --> 00:28:45.904
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

949
00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:47.700
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at the whole city,</v>

950
00:28:47.701 --> 00:28:49.800
<v Speaker 1>you've got neighbors did a pretty safe in Chicago as well.</v>

951
00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:51.263
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

952
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.510
<v Speaker 1>through all of this time that you spent down in Mexico,</v>

953
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:56.010
<v Speaker 1>have you seen it?</v>

954
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.210
<v Speaker 1>You've seen it escalate,</v>

955
00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.710
<v Speaker 1>you've seen it get worse and worse.</v>

956
00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

957
00:28:59.451 --> 00:29:04.451
<v Speaker 1>So there was first this really big escalation happening in 2008 was the first</v>

958
00:29:04.561 --> 00:29:07.020
<v Speaker 1>big escalation where it was a cause of that.</v>

959
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:08.490
<v Speaker 1>So you had,</v>

960
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:11.580
<v Speaker 1>there was a steady build up there was happening.</v>

961
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

962
00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:14.730
<v Speaker 1>and then in 2006,</v>

963
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:20.450
<v Speaker 1>do you had the president fully pickar that on Claire to military crack down on</v>

964
00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.713
<v Speaker 1>drug cartels.</v>

965
00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:26.160
<v Speaker 1>And after that with those as big response and things started really getting out</v>

966
00:29:26.161 --> 00:29:26.994
<v Speaker 1>of hand,</v>

967
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:31.050
<v Speaker 1>we'd already seen violence escalating before.</v>

968
00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.520
<v Speaker 1>And in my idea,</v>

969
00:29:32.521 --> 00:29:34.980
<v Speaker 1>my kind of theory behind this is that,</v>

970
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:36.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

971
00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.700
<v Speaker 1>you had in Mexico back in the 20th century,</v>

972
00:29:38.701 --> 00:29:40.590
<v Speaker 1>more of a top down,</v>

973
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.033
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

974
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.620
<v Speaker 1>centralized government controlling everything you had,</v>

975
00:29:44.621 --> 00:29:49.060
<v Speaker 1>the Pri and power and they were basically,</v>

976
00:29:49.061 --> 00:29:50.530
<v Speaker 1>they will have to coordinate through corruption.</v>

977
00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:55.330
<v Speaker 1>So back then they'd have the drug cartels working for them and an interesting</v>

978
00:29:55.331 --> 00:29:56.041
<v Speaker 1>story guy.</v>

979
00:29:56.041 --> 00:29:56.720
<v Speaker 1>And back then,</v>

980
00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:00.880
<v Speaker 1>the 19 day nine 70 store in a book called drug lord by Terence Popper who</v>

981
00:30:00.881 --> 00:30:01.211
<v Speaker 1>interviewed,</v>

982
00:30:01.211 --> 00:30:01.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

983
00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:05.230
<v Speaker 1>a drug trafficker in the eighties when he got the,</v>

984
00:30:05.231 --> 00:30:06.880
<v Speaker 1>his job is to ha have hit a plateau,</v>

985
00:30:06.881 --> 00:30:08.410
<v Speaker 1>which is the head of a certain territory.</v>

986
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.510
<v Speaker 1>When he got the job,</v>

987
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:14.950
<v Speaker 1>he went with the state police at the time and said,</v>

988
00:30:14.951 --> 00:30:16.930
<v Speaker 1>I want to become the head of the plaza.</v>

989
00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.860
<v Speaker 1>And they took him in and tortured him for two days unlike,</v>

990
00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.630
<v Speaker 1>and I beat the crap out of him,</v>

991
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.120
<v Speaker 1>put electric shocks on his nuts.</v>

992
00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:30.250
<v Speaker 1>One of the big taught at Dmexco put water laced with Chile in his nose.</v>

993
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Smell like one of these big,</v>

994
00:30:31.151 --> 00:30:32.230
<v Speaker 1>so your whole face burns.</v>

995
00:30:32.231 --> 00:30:34.090
<v Speaker 1>He's a like torture techniques they have.</v>

996
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.760
<v Speaker 1>And after two days of torture him and said,</v>

997
00:30:36.761 --> 00:30:37.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

998
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:37.800
<v Speaker 1>well done,</v>

999
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:37.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1000
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.870
<v Speaker 1>you survived.</v>

1001
00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Well you've got the job.</v>

1002
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:45.960
<v Speaker 1>So we know what it shows is that the police had the upper hand,</v>

1003
00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:46.991
<v Speaker 1>the police control this.</v>

1004
00:30:46.991 --> 00:30:47.410
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

1005
00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:47.681
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1006
00:30:47.681 --> 00:30:49.210
<v Speaker 1>we control this racket and you know,</v>

1007
00:30:49.211 --> 00:30:51.340
<v Speaker 1>we can fuck around and tortured and killed.</v>

1008
00:30:51.341 --> 00:30:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Rock rock was when we like,</v>

1009
00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:54.851
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1010
00:30:54.851 --> 00:30:55.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1011
00:30:55.091 --> 00:30:56.380
<v Speaker 1>in all up the presidency.</v>

1012
00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:56.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1013
00:30:56.711 --> 00:30:57.610
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

1014
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:59.200
<v Speaker 1>in that time,</v>

1015
00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Carlos Salinas became president in [inaudible] 94,</v>

1016
00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.190
<v Speaker 1>his brother Raul Salinas,</v>

1017
00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:03.460
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1018
00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:05.670
<v Speaker 1>there's the Swiss investigators,</v>

1019
00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.290
<v Speaker 1>bank accounts and said he had $500 million in bank accounts.</v>

1020
00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:09.750
<v Speaker 1>We say,</v>

1021
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:10.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1022
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:10.090
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1023
00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:11.230
<v Speaker 1>they believed it was drug money.</v>

1024
00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:12.880
<v Speaker 1>So right up to the presidency,</v>

1025
00:31:12.881 --> 00:31:13.960
<v Speaker 1>this was was being run.</v>

1026
00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:15.310
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1027
00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.900
<v Speaker 1>when makes a code change democracy.</v>

1028
00:31:16.901 --> 00:31:19.240
<v Speaker 1>So when I arrived in Mexico was changing to democracy and it's like,</v>

1029
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:19.601
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1030
00:31:19.601 --> 00:31:21.130
<v Speaker 1>great democracy is going to happen.</v>

1031
00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Free markets going to happen.</v>

1032
00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:23.711
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1033
00:31:23.711 --> 00:31:27.370
<v Speaker 1>we're in a good days at a 21st century now.</v>

1034
00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.510
<v Speaker 1>But what happened was you'd look to political control shifted.</v>

1035
00:31:31.511 --> 00:31:35.860
<v Speaker 1>So you had a bunch of different political parties and they were fighting over</v>

1036
00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:36.694
<v Speaker 1>the drug trade.</v>

1037
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:37.901
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1038
00:31:37.901 --> 00:31:41.680
<v Speaker 1>I was one time in regular echo when the federal police had a shootout with the</v>

1039
00:31:41.681 --> 00:31:42.514
<v Speaker 1>municipal police.</v>

1040
00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:45.880
<v Speaker 1>They were fighting each other probably because they work for different drug</v>

1041
00:31:45.881 --> 00:31:46.714
<v Speaker 1>cartels.</v>

1042
00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1043
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:48.550
<v Speaker 1>So that's what started.</v>

1044
00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.320
<v Speaker 1>But then you had the techniques,</v>

1045
00:31:50.321 --> 00:31:51.640
<v Speaker 1>like the technique of beheading</v>

1046
00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:54.730
<v Speaker 1>wasn't really a big deal.</v>

1047
00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:55.901
<v Speaker 1>It was very,</v>

1048
00:31:55.901 --> 00:32:00.901
<v Speaker 1>very rarely used up until around 2006 and one of the first incidents was in</v>

1049
00:32:01.841 --> 00:32:05.890
<v Speaker 1>acapulco in 2006 in about June,</v>

1050
00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:10.890
<v Speaker 1>2006 now it might have been after inspired by the al Qaeda car,</v>

1051
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.760
<v Speaker 1>we in a video which was shown him full of Mexican TV.</v>

1052
00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:16.841
<v Speaker 1>I remember when that came out,</v>

1053
00:32:16.841 --> 00:32:18.370
<v Speaker 1>when they'd decapitated the guy in Iraq</v>

1054
00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.930
<v Speaker 1>and they decapitate first it was two policemen,</v>

1055
00:32:21.931 --> 00:32:22.764
<v Speaker 1>Eddie capitate.</v>

1056
00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Later that year in September,</v>

1057
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.840
<v Speaker 1>2006 there was five heads,</v>

1058
00:32:28.841 --> 00:32:30.460
<v Speaker 1>they rolled onto a disco dance floor.</v>

1059
00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:32.980
<v Speaker 1>And then his thing just became,</v>

1060
00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.250
<v Speaker 1>just escalating,</v>

1061
00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.880
<v Speaker 1>just became this kind of light using his terror public terror.</v>

1062
00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:38.920
<v Speaker 1>So 2006,</v>

1063
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:44.110
<v Speaker 1>2008 was a big escalation and then 2011 12 were like crazy.</v>

1064
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.480
<v Speaker 1>And then it subsided a bit in a pub.</v>

1065
00:32:47.481 --> 00:32:50.840
<v Speaker 1>The violence got bit less public and it was more like hidden,</v>

1066
00:32:50.841 --> 00:32:52.010
<v Speaker 1>like mass grave stuff.</v>

1067
00:32:52.011 --> 00:32:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Now the worst mass grave has been discovered so far,</v>

1068
00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:56.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1069
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.290
<v Speaker 1>was in Veracruz.</v>

1070
00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:02.460
<v Speaker 1>I've been to the side of it and it was 250 bodies were found in this mass grave</v>

1071
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:09.860
<v Speaker 1>in one place and it was right next to a housing estate.</v>

1072
00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.550
<v Speaker 1>And there's families who was,</v>

1073
00:33:12.551 --> 00:33:14.300
<v Speaker 1>so one of the saddest things was you sick.</v>

1074
00:33:14.301 --> 00:33:19.220
<v Speaker 1>You see their kid is bicycles and basketball hoops and stuff right next to this</v>

1075
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:20.960
<v Speaker 1>and the field next to that,</v>

1076
00:33:20.961 --> 00:33:25.961
<v Speaker 1>they'd dub up 250 bodies and the smell was like emanating to this housing</v>

1077
00:33:27.291 --> 00:33:28.124
<v Speaker 1>estate.</v>

1078
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:29.510
<v Speaker 1>And he's looking at a Middle Clark,</v>

1079
00:33:29.511 --> 00:33:30.980
<v Speaker 1>the dream of becoming middle class.</v>

1080
00:33:30.981 --> 00:33:31.814
<v Speaker 1>That was the,</v>

1081
00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:34.160
<v Speaker 1>the kind of in this housing state and right next to it,</v>

1082
00:33:34.161 --> 00:33:35.330
<v Speaker 1>this violence.</v>

1083
00:33:35.331 --> 00:33:39.700
<v Speaker 1>But when I say a lot of these stories and having been the crazy stories,</v>

1084
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:43.340
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of the weird thing is a lot of Mexico lives in normality around this</v>

1085
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.390
<v Speaker 1>is not what you,</v>

1086
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:45.470
<v Speaker 1>this is not what you see every day.</v>

1087
00:33:45.471 --> 00:33:46.640
<v Speaker 1>This is why this happens.</v>

1088
00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:49.280
<v Speaker 1>But there's also just a normality that could just be like,</v>

1089
00:33:49.281 --> 00:33:50.600
<v Speaker 1>you're outside here in la.</v>

1090
00:33:50.601 --> 00:33:54.050
<v Speaker 1>And normal people living normal lives around this as well.</v>

1091
00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.160
<v Speaker 2>What is the response in Mexico?</v>

1092
00:33:57.161 --> 00:34:02.161
<v Speaker 2>Like what would it mean after they wanted to have this military action against</v>

1093
00:34:03.101 --> 00:34:03.940
<v Speaker 2>the cartels?</v>

1094
00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:06.550
<v Speaker 2>Obviously that hasn't really put a dent in it.</v>

1095
00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:07.470
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1096
00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:07.840
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1097
00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:08.550
<v Speaker 2>what's the,</v>

1098
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:11.110
<v Speaker 2>the current thought process behind dealing with this?</v>

1099
00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:12.770
<v Speaker 1>So there's been a,</v>

1100
00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of like citizen,</v>

1101
00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:15.473
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1102
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.700
<v Speaker 1>protest movement various times,</v>

1103
00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:18.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1104
00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:19.950
<v Speaker 1>during these recent years.</v>

1105
00:34:19.951 --> 00:34:20.490
<v Speaker 1>And wire them was,</v>

1106
00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:21.930
<v Speaker 1>it was a very interesting gargled hobbyist,</v>

1107
00:34:21.931 --> 00:34:25.350
<v Speaker 1>Cecilia who is a poet and a writer whose son was murdered.</v>

1108
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:27.000
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

1109
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:27.900
<v Speaker 1>when it first happened,</v>

1110
00:34:27.901 --> 00:34:29.520
<v Speaker 1>his son was murdered and he just came out,</v>

1111
00:34:29.521 --> 00:34:31.410
<v Speaker 1>sis the press where he's like an icon.</v>

1112
00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:32.431
<v Speaker 1>There's just like,</v>

1113
00:34:32.431 --> 00:34:32.940
<v Speaker 1>this is just,</v>

1114
00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:33.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1115
00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Mexico's gone,</v>

1116
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.081
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

1117
00:34:34.081 --> 00:34:34.561
<v Speaker 1>I can't deal with,</v>

1118
00:34:34.561 --> 00:34:35.490
<v Speaker 1>is my son's being killed.</v>

1119
00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:39.780
<v Speaker 1>And then he began talking in very now and then he went to the streets and people</v>

1120
00:34:39.781 --> 00:34:41.040
<v Speaker 1>coming out publicly,</v>

1121
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:42.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1122
00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:43.283
<v Speaker 1>crying.</v>

1123
00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:45.870
<v Speaker 1>And it was one of the first times there's a realization,</v>

1124
00:34:45.871 --> 00:34:48.900
<v Speaker 1>a lot of innocent people dying with this and people come out.</v>

1125
00:34:48.901 --> 00:34:49.170
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1126
00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:49.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1127
00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:50.280
<v Speaker 1>I went to some of these things.</v>

1128
00:34:50.281 --> 00:34:51.870
<v Speaker 1>People come out crying,</v>

1129
00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:54.160
<v Speaker 1>family members and she actually a sense we,</v>

1130
00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:55.380
<v Speaker 1>we're victims here because there's a,</v>

1131
00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:58.410
<v Speaker 1>for a long time since it's simply bad guys killing bad guys.</v>

1132
00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.090
<v Speaker 1>And that wasn't the case.</v>

1133
00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:01.021
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1134
00:35:01.021 --> 00:35:02.220
<v Speaker 1>the current president,</v>

1135
00:35:02.221 --> 00:35:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador who just won the election last year and he just took</v>

1136
00:35:06.301 --> 00:35:07.560
<v Speaker 1>power on December the first,</v>

1137
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.110
<v Speaker 1>so he's got to mix things.</v>

1138
00:35:10.111 --> 00:35:12.660
<v Speaker 1>So one of them is this idea of the war's over.</v>

1139
00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:14.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to create peace,</v>

1140
00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.560
<v Speaker 1>we can have forgiveness,</v>

1141
00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:20.610
<v Speaker 1>reconciliation and up is hard to know what that really means.</v>

1142
00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.460
<v Speaker 1>And his second thing is we need to have,</v>

1143
00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:24.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1144
00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.450
<v Speaker 1>more of a unified state police.</v>

1145
00:35:27.451 --> 00:35:32.160
<v Speaker 1>So like what I described before about you had local police fighting the federal</v>

1146
00:35:32.161 --> 00:35:32.700
<v Speaker 1>police.</v>

1147
00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:33.301
<v Speaker 1>So we've got to have,</v>

1148
00:35:33.301 --> 00:35:34.290
<v Speaker 1>so he's got this idea now,</v>

1149
00:35:34.291 --> 00:35:35.310
<v Speaker 1>the national guard,</v>

1150
00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:39.780
<v Speaker 1>which is a kind of hybrid between military and police thing around,</v>

1151
00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:41.970
<v Speaker 1>and that's basically his,</v>

1152
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.510
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

1153
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:44.400
<v Speaker 1>these kind of two thrusts he's in now.</v>

1154
00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.470
<v Speaker 1>He's only been in power for a couple of months.</v>

1155
00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.830
<v Speaker 1>January was still a bad month in terms of murders,</v>

1156
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.850
<v Speaker 1>in terms of bodies.</v>

1157
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:54.390
<v Speaker 1>Last year was more than 33,000 dead last year,</v>

1158
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.310
<v Speaker 1>which is the size of Mexico,</v>

1159
00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:59.640
<v Speaker 1>the equivalent of the United States having close to 100,000.</v>

1160
00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine what that would mean in the United States.</v>

1161
00:36:02.611 --> 00:36:05.010
<v Speaker 1>If you had that many people dying in a year,</v>

1162
00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:06.423
<v Speaker 1>a month,</v>

1163
00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:08.030
<v Speaker 1>the whole year in a year,</v>

1164
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:08.780
<v Speaker 1>100,000.</v>

1165
00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:09.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1166
00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1167
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:12.100
<v Speaker 2>when these people are,</v>

1168
00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:16.360
<v Speaker 2>when they're being recruited by the cartels,</v>

1169
00:36:16.361 --> 00:36:18.010
<v Speaker 2>when the police officers are being recruited,</v>

1170
00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:21.010
<v Speaker 2>the big issue must be will they must be two issues,</v>

1171
00:36:21.011 --> 00:36:21.221
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1172
00:36:21.221 --> 00:36:22.054
<v Speaker 2>Safety.</v>

1173
00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Like if they don't join the cartel,</v>

1174
00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:25.060
<v Speaker 2>they probably get murdered.</v>

1175
00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:26.110
<v Speaker 2>And two,</v>

1176
00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:29.560
<v Speaker 2>the amount of money the cartel would give them would be far more than the</v>

1177
00:36:29.561 --> 00:36:32.380
<v Speaker 2>government would give them to be a legitimate police officer.</v>

1178
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:33.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1179
00:36:33.181 --> 00:36:33.441
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1180
00:36:33.441 --> 00:36:33.671
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

1181
00:36:33.671 --> 00:36:35.160
<v Speaker 1>that's like a no.</v>

1182
00:36:35.161 --> 00:36:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Famously platinum blonde plateau,</v>

1183
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:37.291
<v Speaker 1>plateau,</v>

1184
00:36:37.291 --> 00:36:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Poloma,</v>

1185
00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:37.811
<v Speaker 1>luck,</v>

1186
00:36:37.811 --> 00:36:38.640
<v Speaker 1>silver or led.</v>

1187
00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.010
<v Speaker 1>You want to have the silver of the bribe,</v>

1188
00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:42.240
<v Speaker 1>the lead of the bullet.</v>

1189
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.261
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1190
00:36:43.261 --> 00:36:44.780
<v Speaker 1>but even beyond that for a long time,</v>

1191
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:47.250
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these people who joined the police,</v>

1192
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:47.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1193
00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:48.750
<v Speaker 1>like from the beginning,</v>

1194
00:36:48.751 --> 00:36:49.060
<v Speaker 1>they're in.</v>

1195
00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:49.690
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1196
00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:50.090
<v Speaker 1>I've taught,</v>

1197
00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:50.341
<v Speaker 1>I've got,</v>

1198
00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:51.091
<v Speaker 1>I've got on video,</v>

1199
00:36:51.091 --> 00:36:51.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1200
00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:55.730
<v Speaker 1>met a video back in 2010 in Sierra wireless of a bunch of,</v>

1201
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1202
00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:58.380
<v Speaker 1>of rappers just hang around in the middle of all this.</v>

1203
00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.200
<v Speaker 1>And one of their friends were saying,</v>

1204
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:02.940
<v Speaker 1>and they were talking and these people were saying,</v>

1205
00:37:02.941 --> 00:37:03.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1206
00:37:03.091 --> 00:37:04.380
<v Speaker 1>some of them been done for taking drugs,</v>

1207
00:37:04.381 --> 00:37:06.090
<v Speaker 1>have the board and they'd been in gangs and stuff.</v>

1208
00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:07.830
<v Speaker 1>And one was like,</v>

1209
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:08.663
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a policeman.</v>

1210
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:10.830
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

1211
00:37:10.831 --> 00:37:12.210
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a policeman and make some money,</v>

1212
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:12.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1213
00:37:12.961 --> 00:37:14.790
<v Speaker 1>basically through corruptions that as I said,</v>

1214
00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:17.140
<v Speaker 1>it is like that is the mentality of somebody.</v>

1215
00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.900
<v Speaker 1>People joining the police from early on.</v>

1216
00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Another guy,</v>

1217
00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Guy Open,</v>

1218
00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.470
<v Speaker 1>open a first book with his guy,</v>

1219
00:37:22.471 --> 00:37:23.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1220
00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:23.580
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

1221
00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:24.960
<v Speaker 1>who became policemen.</v>

1222
00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1223
00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:26.693
<v Speaker 1>when he was 18,</v>

1224
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:28.350
<v Speaker 1>he was basically a hard,</v>

1225
00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.273
<v Speaker 1>tough guy.</v>

1226
00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.740
<v Speaker 1>Pet American football from Durango,</v>

1227
00:37:31.741 --> 00:37:36.720
<v Speaker 1>became a policeman when he was 18 and into police learn to torture and learned a</v>

1228
00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:37.290
<v Speaker 1>murder.</v>

1229
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:37.601
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1230
00:37:37.601 --> 00:37:38.940
<v Speaker 1>that's what I learned in a place.</v>

1231
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:41.220
<v Speaker 1>And it just at 20 after two years,</v>

1232
00:37:41.221 --> 00:37:43.250
<v Speaker 1>just left the place and went full time into crime.</v>

1233
00:37:43.251 --> 00:37:44.084
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

1234
00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:45.630
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

1235
00:37:45.631 --> 00:37:48.260
<v Speaker 1>you've got a situation where you know,</v>

1236
00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:48.840
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

1237
00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.700
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1238
00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:52.640
<v Speaker 1>it's worse even as beyond that they're the bad,</v>

1239
00:37:52.641 --> 00:37:54.810
<v Speaker 1>a lockable might imagine of corruption.</v>

1240
00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:55.560
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

1241
00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:56.000
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1242
00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
<v Speaker 2>all of this essentially is escalated from the time you came to Mexico.</v>

1243
00:38:01.101 --> 00:38:02.030
<v Speaker 2>So when you came back to,</v>

1244
00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.070
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like you got in,</v>

1245
00:38:04.071 --> 00:38:04.281
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1246
00:38:04.281 --> 00:38:08.030
<v Speaker 2>if it was a story you got in at almost the perfect time.</v>

1247
00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1248
00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:09.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1249
00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:09.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1250
00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:10.630
<v Speaker 1>Horrible way.</v>

1251
00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:10.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1252
00:38:10.831 --> 00:38:10.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1253
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:11.281
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1254
00:38:11.281 --> 00:38:11.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1255
00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:11.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1256
00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:12.603
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1257
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:13.091
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1258
00:38:13.091 --> 00:38:13.924
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1259
00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:14.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1260
00:38:14.171 --> 00:38:14.391
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

1261
00:38:14.391 --> 00:38:15.940
<v Speaker 1>you don't do these things on purpose,</v>

1262
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:16.361
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1263
00:38:16.361 --> 00:38:16.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1264
00:38:16.571 --> 00:38:17.440
<v Speaker 1>you don't think,</v>

1265
00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:19.900
<v Speaker 1>and if I look back 20 years ago,</v>

1266
00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:20.111
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1267
00:38:20.111 --> 00:38:21.670
<v Speaker 1>it's 18 years I've been in Mexico now,</v>

1268
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.540
<v Speaker 1>I had grown up in Mexico and that,</v>

1269
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:25.383
<v Speaker 1>in that sense,</v>

1270
00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:25.950
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1271
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:26.771
<v Speaker 1>I've never looked back.</v>

1272
00:38:26.771 --> 00:38:31.771
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's it now in terms of myself seeing this.</v>

1273
00:38:32.141 --> 00:38:32.351
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1274
00:38:32.351 --> 00:38:32.620
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1275
00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:33.011
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1276
00:38:33.011 --> 00:38:34.480
<v Speaker 1>I think for anybody it's paced,</v>

1277
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:35.280
<v Speaker 1>painful.</v>

1278
00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:35.771
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1279
00:38:35.771 --> 00:38:39.520
<v Speaker 1>how you process that level of depth,</v>

1280
00:38:39.521 --> 00:38:40.440
<v Speaker 1>that level of murder,</v>

1281
00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:41.350
<v Speaker 1>level of suffering.</v>

1282
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1283
00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.031
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1284
00:38:43.031 --> 00:38:43.391
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1285
00:38:43.391 --> 00:38:44.224
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1286
00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:45.600
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1287
00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:45.791
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1288
00:38:45.791 --> 00:38:47.000
<v Speaker 1>it's horrible stuff to see and,</v>

1289
00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:47.221
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1290
00:38:47.221 --> 00:38:48.054
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

1291
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.800
<v Speaker 1>you could still have a lot of people,</v>

1292
00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:51.693
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1293
00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:54.730
<v Speaker 1>separated from that in our families.</v>

1294
00:38:54.731 --> 00:38:57.790
<v Speaker 1>People bring up children and,</v>

1295
00:38:58.650 --> 00:38:58.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1296
00:38:58.841 --> 00:38:59.710
<v Speaker 1>you want to separate,</v>

1297
00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:00.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1298
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:01.990
<v Speaker 1>kids from that.</v>

1299
00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:03.221
<v Speaker 1>So off often,</v>

1300
00:39:03.221 --> 00:39:05.200
<v Speaker 1>like middle class kids in Mexico,</v>

1301
00:39:05.201 --> 00:39:09.790
<v Speaker 1>quite sheltered because families want to shelter them as much as they can from,</v>

1302
00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:10.060
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

1303
00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.170
<v Speaker 1>from that violence and just,</v>

1304
00:39:11.171 --> 00:39:11.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1305
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.480
<v Speaker 1>not let them see that side of things.</v>

1306
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:16.240
<v Speaker 1>How much of that do you have to deal with in Mexico City?</v>

1307
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.890
<v Speaker 1>So Mexico City,</v>

1308
00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:18.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1309
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:23.770
<v Speaker 1>is about the same murder rate as Houston to Mexico City is not supervised now.</v>

1310
00:39:24.251 --> 00:39:25.690
<v Speaker 1>It's still not super safe,</v>

1311
00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:27.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's not super Vinad.</v>

1312
00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:30.520
<v Speaker 1>So Mexico City is kind of,</v>

1313
00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:32.890
<v Speaker 1>and there are parts of Mexico,</v>

1314
00:39:32.891 --> 00:39:37.891
<v Speaker 1>which of which are fairly safe now the state of Yucatan were meritorious is the</v>

1315
00:39:38.771 --> 00:39:40.480
<v Speaker 1>same murder level as Belgium.</v>

1316
00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:45.460
<v Speaker 1>So you've got oasis within Mexico where you don't have this level of violence.</v>

1317
00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:49.180
<v Speaker 1>So Mexico City is it and is a great city.</v>

1318
00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Mexico City is a great city to live in in many ways apart from the traffic and</v>

1319
00:39:53.511 --> 00:39:55.120
<v Speaker 1>the pollution and various things.</v>

1320
00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:55.371
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1321
00:39:55.371 --> 00:39:56.500
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of things that are,</v>

1322
00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:57.361
<v Speaker 1>and I know,</v>

1323
00:39:57.361 --> 00:39:59.080
<v Speaker 1>and I love all of Mexico and I love all of,</v>

1324
00:39:59.120 --> 00:39:59.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1325
00:39:59.311 --> 00:39:59.891
<v Speaker 1>Latin America.</v>

1326
00:39:59.891 --> 00:40:00.360
<v Speaker 1>I love even,</v>

1327
00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.990
<v Speaker 1>and even the bad places I still love.</v>

1328
00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:03.550
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy going to these places.</v>

1329
00:40:03.551 --> 00:40:07.150
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy meeting people there in a hangout,</v>

1330
00:40:07.151 --> 00:40:08.140
<v Speaker 1>in his areas.</v>

1331
00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:09.640
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of good things about him still.</v>

1332
00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:14.850
<v Speaker 1>But dealing with all the horrific tragedies that you report about and</v>

1333
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:16.263
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

1334
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:18.190
<v Speaker 1>do you look for an escape route?</v>

1335
00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1336
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.060
<v Speaker 1>are you,</v>

1337
00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:21.250
<v Speaker 1>are you looking to get the fuck out of dodge?</v>

1338
00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:22.661
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1339
00:40:22.661 --> 00:40:22.870
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

1340
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:23.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1341
00:40:23.171 --> 00:40:24.004
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1342
00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:26.860
<v Speaker 1>there's been different times where,</v>

1343
00:40:26.861 --> 00:40:27.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1344
00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:27.993
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1345
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:29.171

<v Speaker 1>We'll see if that's true.</v>

1379
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

00:41:03.101 --> 00:41:03.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1382
00:41:03.331 --> 00:41:05.110
<v Speaker 1>you get caught still doing this stuff.</v>

1384
00:41:05.751 --> 00:41:06.730
<v Speaker 1>when you've covered something,</v>

1385
00:41:06.731 --> 00:41:07.600
<v Speaker 1>people will want more,</v>

1386
00:41:07.601 --> 00:41:08.940
<v Speaker 1>people are interested as a,</v>

1387
00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.840
<v Speaker 1>and there's relevance to this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1389
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:16.090

1390
00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.310
<v Speaker 1>the danger in staff is simply,</v>

1391
00:41:18.311 --> 00:41:20.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean we'd journalism's in a bad way.</v>

1392
00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:22.300
<v Speaker 1>I love the media in a bad way.</v>

1393
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:23.703
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1394
00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.040
<v Speaker 1>and just simply getting know,</v>

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:26.260
<v Speaker 1>trying to be know I'm a free lance,</v>

<v Speaker 1>documentaries and do these things.</v>

1400
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:37.490

1442
00:42:48.981 --> 00:42:53.840
<v Speaker 1>thing that happened there when a lot of regular people rose up with guns against</v>

00:46:02.281 --> 00:46:03.114
<v Speaker 1>I won't take your photo.</v>

1585
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:07.410
<v Speaker 1>And then a guy came up and said to the other guys,</v>

1586
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:08.160
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1587
00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.960
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing this the Da guy here?</v>

1588
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.261
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1589
00:46:10.261 --> 00:46:13.410
<v Speaker 1>the agent among you taking your photographs,</v>

1590
00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:15.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1591
00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:15.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1592
00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:16.531
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

1593
00:46:16.531 --> 00:46:17.364
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1594
00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:17.611
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1595
00:46:17.611 --> 00:46:18.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

1596
00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:18.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even American.</v>

1597
00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:19.853
<v Speaker 1>I'm British.</v>

1598
00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:21.031
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1599
00:46:21.031 --> 00:46:21.141
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1600
00:46:21.141 --> 00:46:21.300
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1601
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:21.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1602
00:46:21.661 --> 00:46:22.500
<v Speaker 1>this is a DEA guy.</v>

1603
00:46:22.501 --> 00:46:22.830
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

1604
00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:23.280
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1605
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:27.420
<v Speaker 1>my brother was arrested in Texas and the Dea guy pretended to be a journalist,</v>

1606
00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:28.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1607
00:46:28.231 --> 00:46:29.160
<v Speaker 1>some bullshit story.</v>

1608
00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:30.721
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

1609
00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:30.910
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1610
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:31.440
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

1611
00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:31.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1612
00:46:31.891 --> 00:46:32.940
<v Speaker 1>I can show you my website.</v>

1613
00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:36.990
<v Speaker 1>So they've got the cell phone out and,</v>

1614
00:46:36.991 --> 00:46:37.501
<v Speaker 1>and look through it,</v>

1615
00:46:37.501 --> 00:46:39.720
<v Speaker 1>his cell phone and found out my website.</v>

1616
00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.320
<v Speaker 1>And the guy calmed down a bit and he said,</v>

1617
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:43.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1618
00:46:43.621 --> 00:46:44.010
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1619
00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:44.880
<v Speaker 1>if I see you,</v>

1620
00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:46.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put a bullet in your head,</v>

1621
00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:49.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to throw a grenade at you.</v>

1622
00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

1623
00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:51.203
<v Speaker 1>He added.</v>

1624
00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.580
<v Speaker 1>So I left in,</v>

1625
00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:57.630
<v Speaker 1>I kind of tried to talk about a left and uh,</v>

1626
00:46:58.740 --> 00:46:59.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1627
00:46:59.200 --> 00:46:59.380
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1628
00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:03.330
<v Speaker 1>and they went and then I didn't publish the photographs I've still got and I</v>

1629
00:47:03.331 --> 00:47:06.020
<v Speaker 1>both to photo ops and one of the guys sent me an email saying what happened to</v>

1630
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:06.863
<v Speaker 1>photographs,</v>

1631
00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:08.190
<v Speaker 1>my emails and my website.</v>

1632
00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:09.930
<v Speaker 1>So I just ignored it.</v>

1633
00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.980
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of them got killed in a big fight they had with the federal</v>

1634
00:47:13.981 --> 00:47:15.750
<v Speaker 1>police afterwards.</v>

1635
00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:17.593
<v Speaker 1>So that was one.</v>

1636
00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:18.773
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1637
00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:19.151
<v Speaker 1>and it's been,</v>

1638
00:47:19.151 --> 00:47:19.261
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1639
00:47:19.261 --> 00:47:20.010
<v Speaker 1>it's been a few more.</v>

1640
00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:21.360
<v Speaker 1>So it's a lot of touch and go.</v>

1641
00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1642
00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:22.650
<v Speaker 1>These situations.</v>

1643
00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:23.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1644
00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:24.420
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1645
00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:25.530
<v Speaker 1>the federal police,</v>

1646
00:47:25.531 --> 00:47:29.920
<v Speaker 1>do they have a plan to try to eradicate these moms or is it</v>

1647
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:31.540
<v Speaker 2>a lot of lip service?</v>

1648
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:32.030
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1649
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:36.730
<v Speaker 2>is it really possible to radically these gangs or is it just one of those things</v>

1650
00:47:36.731 --> 00:47:39.730
<v Speaker 2>where they say they're going to do something but they have to kind of protect</v>

1651
00:47:39.731 --> 00:47:40.564
<v Speaker 2>themselves?</v>

1652
00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:42.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1653
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.660
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1654
00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:43.130
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1655
00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:44.930
<v Speaker 1>there's been different different times.</v>

1656
00:47:44.931 --> 00:47:49.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean sometimes there's been the federal police have done well done after a</v>

1657
00:47:49.071 --> 00:47:52.070
<v Speaker 1>particular guy or sometimes with the Americans.</v>

1658
00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:53.410
<v Speaker 1>He no doubt been a,</v>

1659
00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:55.133
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1660
00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.710
<v Speaker 1>in our rest of very many significant kingpins,</v>

1661
00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:03.370
<v Speaker 1>the problem is his word is the door doing a deeper questions is that like when</v>

1662
00:48:04.911 --> 00:48:06.720
<v Speaker 1>you take down some of these kingpins,</v>

1663
00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:10.460
<v Speaker 1>you've always got other people who will fight over their same territory.</v>

1664
00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:12.980
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

1665
00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:18.880
<v Speaker 1>you take out Chapo Guzman and then you get a fight among his sons and some odd</v>

1666
00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:21.860
<v Speaker 1>one of his lieutenants over it,</v>

1667
00:48:21.861 --> 00:48:22.694
<v Speaker 1>over the empire.</v>

1668
00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Now what's happened,</v>

1669
00:48:24.321 --> 00:48:27.920
<v Speaker 1>and one of the reasons the violence has increased in Mexico is because they've</v>

1670
00:48:27.921 --> 00:48:32.300
<v Speaker 1>had this onslaught attacking cartels over the years.</v>

1671
00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Then you end up with like the lieutenants then taking over and then their</v>

1672
00:48:37.851 --> 00:48:40.730
<v Speaker 1>lieutenants taking over and then their lieutenants taking over.</v>

1673
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:42.650
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened in Chicago as well.</v>

1674
00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:46.340
<v Speaker 2>Or I spoke to a police officer in Chicago and he said the violence escalated</v>

1675
00:48:46.341 --> 00:48:46.791
<v Speaker 2>afterwards.</v>

1676
00:48:46.791 --> 00:48:48.590
<v Speaker 2>Some big gang rests.</v>

1677
00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.360
<v Speaker 2>And once they had gotten,</v>

1678
00:48:50.361 --> 00:48:53.330
<v Speaker 2>some leaders have some gangs and other people tried to fill the void.</v>

1679
00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:54.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1680
00:48:54.011 --> 00:48:54.611
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1681
00:48:54.611 --> 00:48:54.971
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1682
00:48:54.971 --> 00:48:55.210
<v Speaker 1>The sound.</v>

1683
00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:55.391
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1684
00:48:55.391 --> 00:48:58.090
<v Speaker 1>so then you get some of the people who are in power now,</v>

1685
00:48:58.850 --> 00:48:59.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1686
00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:00.370
<v Speaker 1>like very young,</v>

1687
00:49:00.371 --> 00:49:04.480
<v Speaker 1>very violent people and people who are not as smart when those not as mature,</v>

1688
00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:05.433
<v Speaker 1>not calculated.</v>

1689
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:05.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1690
00:49:05.771 --> 00:49:05.981
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1691
00:49:05.981 --> 00:49:07.600
<v Speaker 1>so you to you and also you end up with these,</v>

1692
00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:08.920
<v Speaker 1>the fragmented territory.</v>

1693
00:49:08.921 --> 00:49:12.280
<v Speaker 1>So you have people controlling rather than having big cartel,</v>

1694
00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:16.250
<v Speaker 1>some leader who controls it and a half the country you end up with these cartel</v>

1695
00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:20.560
<v Speaker 1>lethal allowed these gangs controlling a part of the state now has one state</v>

1696
00:49:20.561 --> 00:49:21.394
<v Speaker 1>called good Arrow,</v>

1697
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:26.590
<v Speaker 1>which you've seen this really light cartel fragmentation and you've got maybe 12</v>

1698
00:49:26.591 --> 00:49:31.130
<v Speaker 1>different groups in this one state and you get like a place where they're going</v>

1699
00:49:31.131 --> 00:49:34.420
<v Speaker 1>to one controls controller up along a road and then in our group controls it</v>

1700
00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:36.670
<v Speaker 1>passing a certain point.</v>

1701
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:39.700
<v Speaker 1>So there was some,</v>

1702
00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.440
<v Speaker 1>some friends went up there,</v>

1703
00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:42.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1704
00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:47.230
<v Speaker 1>seven journeys went up there and got held up on this road up there 2017 as well.</v>

1705
00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.200
<v Speaker 1>And they got,</v>

1706
00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:54.240
<v Speaker 1>were in a car going like they're two vehicles and about 200 guys blocked the</v>

1707
00:49:54.881 --> 00:49:59.660
<v Speaker 1>road and the leader of this group was a guy I believe called [inaudible].</v>

1708
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:01.063
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1709
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:01.601
<v Speaker 1>like again,</v>

1710
00:50:01.601 --> 00:50:01.991
<v Speaker 1>his name,</v>

1711
00:50:01.991 --> 00:50:02.710
<v Speaker 1>blondie,</v>

1712
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:06.550
<v Speaker 1>polite and he's like maybe 23 years old,</v>

1713
00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:07.870
<v Speaker 1>like 200 guys there.</v>

1714
00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:08.770
<v Speaker 1>They said some of the kids,</v>

1715
00:50:08.771 --> 00:50:09.340
<v Speaker 1>I talked to,</v>

1716
00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:12.790
<v Speaker 1>one of the friends who was there and he said some of these are kids who was the</v>

1717
00:50:12.791 --> 00:50:15.610
<v Speaker 1>youngest like 10 years old among this mob of people.</v>

1718
00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:16.850
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

1719
00:50:16.850 --> 00:50:17.591
<v Speaker 1>they held him up,</v>

1720
00:50:17.591 --> 00:50:19.750
<v Speaker 1>they took away their VH one of the vehicles.</v>

1721
00:50:19.751 --> 00:50:20.980
<v Speaker 1>They took away all their laptops,</v>

1722
00:50:20.981 --> 00:50:21.431
<v Speaker 1>cameras,</v>

1723
00:50:21.431 --> 00:50:22.264
<v Speaker 1>all that equipment,</v>

1724
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:23.470
<v Speaker 1>stuck them in the car,</v>

1725
00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:24.643
<v Speaker 1>two go.</v>

1726
00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to be careful when you're traveling that you have like a,</v>

1727
00:50:28.071 --> 00:50:30.460
<v Speaker 2>an obviously expensive laptop or camera,</v>

1728
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:31.490
<v Speaker 2>something along those lines.</v>

1729
00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:33.390
<v Speaker 1>I think from the point of view of his,</v>

1730
00:50:33.391 --> 00:50:33.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1731
00:50:33.541 --> 00:50:33.751
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>

1732
00:50:33.751 --> 00:50:34.584
<v Speaker 1>they can take it away.</v>

1733
00:50:34.590 --> 00:50:35.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm going and it's happened a lot,</v>

1734
00:50:35.611 --> 00:50:37.450
<v Speaker 1>a lot of cases recently,</v>

1735
00:50:37.890 --> 00:50:39.210
<v Speaker 1>colleagues just being robbed.</v>

1736
00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:40.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1737
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:43.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean you get like an armed group and the take away that basically the hold</v>

1738
00:50:43.571 --> 00:50:44.400
<v Speaker 1>them down,</v>

1739
00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:45.240
<v Speaker 1>take all their stuff.</v>

1740
00:50:45.241 --> 00:50:46.590
<v Speaker 1>So you don't know sort of going,</v>

1741
00:50:46.591 --> 00:50:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I know various colleagues,</v>

1742
00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:48.571
<v Speaker 1>photographers,</v>

1743
00:50:48.571 --> 00:50:51.840
<v Speaker 1>and if you're a freelance photographer and you lose a good camera,</v>

1744
00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:53.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1745
00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:53.521
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

1746
00:50:53.521 --> 00:50:54.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1747
00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:55.220
<v Speaker 1>then in there like,</v>

1748
00:50:55.570 --> 00:50:55.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1749
00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:56.900
<v Speaker 1>some of the TV people would have,</v>

1750
00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:58.590
<v Speaker 1>they have less expensive cameras and they used to,</v>

1751
00:50:58.591 --> 00:50:59.640
<v Speaker 1>I remember a few years ago,</v>

1752
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:01.260
<v Speaker 1>a TV group,</v>

1753
00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:01.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1754
00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:05.820
<v Speaker 1>interviewed some gang members are in Honduras and they stole their camera.</v>

1755
00:51:05.821 --> 00:51:10.520
<v Speaker 1>And it was at that time it was like an $80,000 camera and the TV network on a</v>

1756
00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:13.920
<v Speaker 1>say of what are the TV network apparently was more pissed about losing the</v>

1757
00:51:13.921 --> 00:51:14.754
<v Speaker 1>camera.</v>

1758
00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:17.430
<v Speaker 1>It was about these guys,</v>

1759
00:51:17.431 --> 00:51:17.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1760
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:18.523
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1761
00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:20.760
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] now having guns pointed to them.</v>

1762
00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:23.850
<v Speaker 1>What is the attitude in Mexico?</v>

1763
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1764
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:29.230
<v Speaker 2>a special amongst people who are studying the narco wars with all this,</v>

1765
00:51:29.941 --> 00:51:30.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1766
00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:31.710
<v Speaker 2>build that wall stuff,</v>

1767
00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:32.970
<v Speaker 2>all this,</v>

1768
00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:34.260
<v Speaker 2>what's going on in America?</v>

1769
00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:35.123
<v Speaker 2>There's this,</v>

1770
00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:37.110
<v Speaker 2>this is very strange,</v>

1771
00:51:37.111 --> 00:51:37.591
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1772
00:51:37.591 --> 00:51:41.370
<v Speaker 2>Versus left polarization over here about whether or not there should be a wall</v>

1773
00:51:41.371 --> 00:51:42.990
<v Speaker 2>between the United States and Mexico.</v>

1774
00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1775
00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:44.803
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1776
00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:45.381
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1777
00:51:45.381 --> 00:51:49.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean the thing Mexican's are obviously very anti Trump in Mexico.</v>

1778
00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:50.660
<v Speaker 1>It's in a farm and I,</v>

1779
00:51:50.661 --> 00:51:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Trump is very unpopular from the very beginning when he said,</v>

1780
00:51:54.861 --> 00:51:56.990
<v Speaker 1>I know they are rapists and murderers.</v>

1781
00:51:56.991 --> 00:51:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1782
00:51:57.350 --> 00:51:58.610
<v Speaker 1>Someone's doing the raping.</v>

1783
00:51:58.611 --> 00:51:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1784
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.620
<v Speaker 1>How many?</v>

1785
00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:00.520
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of United.</v>

1786
00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:01.730
<v Speaker 1>You look at surveys,</v>

1787
00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:03.200
<v Speaker 1>the level's very low.</v>

1788
00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:04.840
<v Speaker 1>So is anybody like me?</v>

1789
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Trump in Mexico?</v>

1790
00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:06.231
<v Speaker 1>I was there.</v>

1791
00:52:06.231 --> 00:52:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Like there's always contrarians.</v>

1792
00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.070
<v Speaker 1>I've seen numbers like,</v>

1793
00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:10.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1794
00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:13.580
<v Speaker 1>people will say like 80% or something.</v>

1795
00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:14.780
<v Speaker 1>I think he's terrible.</v>

1796
00:52:14.781 --> 00:52:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Sent means they must be at 20% somewhere else.</v>

1797
00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:17.293
<v Speaker 1>Don't.</v>

1798
00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:22.310
<v Speaker 1>I haven't met a Mexican who's been like pro Trump and I never have.</v>

1799
00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:25.910
<v Speaker 1>I met a Salvadoran who was pro Trump one time in,</v>

1800
00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:29.570
<v Speaker 1>in the heated guy had been deported and he was like,</v>

1801
00:52:29.571 --> 00:52:30.021
<v Speaker 1>I know you'll get,</v>

1802
00:52:30.021 --> 00:52:30.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1803
00:52:30.291 --> 00:52:30.681
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

1804
00:52:30.681 --> 00:52:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Trump's going to turn out to be a great president.</v>

1805
00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:33.020
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1806
00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.040
<v Speaker 1>so I see that.</v>

1807
00:52:34.041 --> 00:52:34.690
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1808
00:52:34.690 --> 00:52:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Mexico's very,</v>

1809
00:52:35.541 --> 00:52:39.020
<v Speaker 1>very anti Trump in terms of the wall.</v>

1810
00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:40.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

1811
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:40.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1812
00:52:40.491 --> 00:52:40.731
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1813
00:52:40.731 --> 00:52:41.564
<v Speaker 1>in terms of what</v>

1814
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:44.780
<v Speaker 1>I intended,</v>

1815
00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:45.420
<v Speaker 1>the smugglers,</v>

1816
00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:50.420
<v Speaker 1>mom was talking to a smuggler in Nogales about this and he was describing he,</v>

1817
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:51.320
<v Speaker 1>he'd smile.</v>

1818
00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:52.360
<v Speaker 1>He was from Nogales,</v>

1819
00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.980
<v Speaker 1>from a neighborhood called Buenos Aires,</v>

1820
00:52:54.981 --> 00:52:57.950
<v Speaker 1>which is right on the border with the United States.</v>

1821
00:52:57.951 --> 00:52:58.570
<v Speaker 1>He has no god,</v>

1822
00:52:58.570 --> 00:52:59.403
<v Speaker 1>Sonora,</v>

1823
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:00.343
<v Speaker 1>Nogales,</v>

1824
00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:01.130
<v Speaker 1>Arizona.</v>

1825
00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:01.950
<v Speaker 1>So in August,</v>

1826
00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:02.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1827
00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.380
<v Speaker 1>so Noriega and Garth's Arizona.</v>

1828
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:05.930
<v Speaker 1>And he was from the neighborhood right on the border there.</v>

1829
00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:12.340
<v Speaker 1>And he described that he first took people over the border of the United States</v>

1830
00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:15.020
<v Speaker 1>back in the 1980s when he was at school.</v>

1831
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:16.063
<v Speaker 1>He's a high school.</v>

1832
00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:20.540
<v Speaker 1>And the reason was that that time was just an old fence and there was a hole in</v>

1833
00:53:20.541 --> 00:53:20.871
<v Speaker 1>the fence.</v>

1834
00:53:20.871 --> 00:53:24.140
<v Speaker 1>They used to go through into United States and go back into Mexico to send old</v>

1835
00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:25.153
<v Speaker 1>wire fence.</v>

1836
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:28.440
<v Speaker 1>And the first time he took people through,</v>

1837
00:53:28.441 --> 00:53:30.730
<v Speaker 1>people would arrive from southern Mexico saying,</v>

1838
00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:31.913
<v Speaker 1>how do we get to the US?</v>

1839
00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:32.261
<v Speaker 1>And he'd say,</v>

1840
00:53:32.261 --> 00:53:32.371
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1841
00:53:32.371 --> 00:53:32.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1842
00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:33.443
<v Speaker 1>this way.</v>

1843
00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:34.800
<v Speaker 1>And they give them a tip.</v>

1844
00:53:34.801 --> 00:53:38.550
<v Speaker 1>He said the first time he got the equivalent of about 50 cents was what you made</v>

1845
00:53:38.551 --> 00:53:40.530
<v Speaker 1>to take people to the United States 50 cents.</v>

1846
00:53:41.410 --> 00:53:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays,</v>

1847
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:45.960
<v Speaker 1>the cost of going into the u s is $5,000.</v>

1848
00:53:45.961 --> 00:53:47.880
<v Speaker 1>That's what you paid to go legal in the United States.</v>

1849
00:53:47.881 --> 00:53:48.780
<v Speaker 1>5,000 bucks.</v>

1850
00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:50.251
<v Speaker 1>So we were saying,</v>

1851
00:53:50.251 --> 00:53:50.491
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1852
00:53:50.491 --> 00:53:53.850
<v Speaker 1>look at that increase every time that the u s puts more security,</v>

1853
00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:56.070
<v Speaker 1>it means it's more expensive.</v>

1854
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.600
<v Speaker 1>When it's more expensive,</v>

1855
00:53:57.601 --> 00:53:59.910
<v Speaker 1>that means more money going to criminals,</v>

1856
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:02.430
<v Speaker 1>which means there's not an industry doing it.</v>

1857
00:54:02.431 --> 00:54:07.431
<v Speaker 1>So now the cartels make a big percentage of that money of human smuggling into</v>

1858
00:54:08.491 --> 00:54:10.600
<v Speaker 1>the u s um,</v>

1859
00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:12.180
<v Speaker 1>by luck in terms of the wall,</v>

1860
00:54:12.181 --> 00:54:12.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

1861
00:54:12.691 --> 00:54:13.524
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1862
00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:15.400
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

1863
00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:17.050
<v Speaker 1>when Trump first came in,</v>

1864
00:54:17.051 --> 00:54:18.760
<v Speaker 1>he had the line that Mexico's going to pay for it.</v>

1865
00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1866
00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:20.240
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1867
00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.170
<v Speaker 1>and then it was this kind of line in a right.</v>

1868
00:54:22.171 --> 00:54:22.601
<v Speaker 1>The beginning,</v>

1869
00:54:22.601 --> 00:54:23.020
<v Speaker 1>he kinda,</v>

1870
00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:26.260
<v Speaker 1>he threatened Mexican president saying,</v>

1871
00:54:26.261 --> 00:54:26.441
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1872
00:54:26.441 --> 00:54:29.140
<v Speaker 1>if you don't agree to pay for the wall and why are you going to come and meet</v>

1873
00:54:29.141 --> 00:54:29.974
<v Speaker 1>me?</v>

1874
00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:31.360
<v Speaker 1>And then it was like,</v>

1875
00:54:31.361 --> 00:54:31.571
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1876
00:54:31.571 --> 00:54:36.010
<v Speaker 1>he's really going to try to shake down in Mexico for like billions of dollars.</v>

1877
00:54:36.011 --> 00:54:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Is He really going to try and do that?</v>

1878
00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:38.471
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1879
00:54:38.471 --> 00:54:40.840
<v Speaker 1>and that was kind of scary moment.</v>

1880
00:54:40.841 --> 00:54:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Then think from point of view of Mexico when he first got to powers lie.</v>

1881
00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:47.800
<v Speaker 1>He's going to do that and then he's going to deport 3 million and he's going to,</v>

1882
00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:48.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1883
00:54:48.011 --> 00:54:50.170
<v Speaker 1>he's going to kill Nafta.</v>

1884
00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:51.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1885
00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Actually those things haven't really come to pass.</v>

1886
00:54:53.861 --> 00:54:54.191
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

1887
00:54:54.191 --> 00:54:57.190
<v Speaker 1>if you look over the last couple of years of Trump has some really hit Mexico</v>

1888
00:54:57.191 --> 00:54:58.024
<v Speaker 1>very hard.</v>

1889
00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:02.560
<v Speaker 1>So the concern was that he was going to take money that should be allocated to</v>

1890
00:55:02.561 --> 00:55:03.490
<v Speaker 1>other ways.</v>

1891
00:55:03.491 --> 00:55:06.580
<v Speaker 1>It's going to help Mexico and he was going to try to take that and use it to</v>

1892
00:55:06.581 --> 00:55:07.414
<v Speaker 1>build the wall.</v>

1893
00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:08.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1894
00:55:08.621 --> 00:55:10.000
<v Speaker 1>no one really knew when he first came in.</v>

1895
00:55:10.001 --> 00:55:10.211
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1896
00:55:10.211 --> 00:55:10.540
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1897
00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Mexico's going to pay for this wall.</v>

1898
00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1899
00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:13.710
<v Speaker 1>The Wall just got 10 foot higher.</v>

1900
00:55:13.711 --> 00:55:14.320
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

1901
00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1902
00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:15.041
<v Speaker 1>It was light.</v>

1903
00:55:15.041 --> 00:55:15.730
<v Speaker 1>It was like in a,</v>

1904
00:55:15.730 --> 00:55:16.451
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to do that?</v>

1905
00:55:16.451 --> 00:55:16.661
<v Speaker 1>You're going,</v>

1906
00:55:16.661 --> 00:55:18.820
<v Speaker 1>are you going to start threatening Mexican militarily and say,</v>

1907
00:55:18.821 --> 00:55:19.481
<v Speaker 1>give us money?</v>

1908
00:55:19.481 --> 00:55:19.751
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1909
00:55:19.751 --> 00:55:20.471
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of like,</v>

1910
00:55:20.471 --> 00:55:20.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1911
00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:21.411
<v Speaker 1>like is it a,</v>

1912
00:55:21.411 --> 00:55:22.350
<v Speaker 1>is it a shakedown?</v>

1913
00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Good to shake down.</v>

1914
00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:23.501
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of,</v>

1915
00:55:23.501 --> 00:55:26.740
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of a crazy diplomatic thing when he first got here.</v>

1916
00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:30.100
<v Speaker 1>So that was kind of scary for a moment from the point of view of Mexico.</v>

1917
00:55:30.610 --> 00:55:32.200
<v Speaker 1>But I think after you look at the last couple of years,</v>

1918
00:55:32.201 --> 00:55:32.381
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1919
00:55:32.381 --> 00:55:35.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm really hit Mexico with and now he wants to build the wall.</v>

1920
00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:36.921
<v Speaker 1>Now as he does it,</v>

1921
00:55:36.921 --> 00:55:39.460
<v Speaker 1>there's the big fasten in terms of the spending here,</v>

1922
00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:41.680
<v Speaker 1>but if he wants to build it,</v>

1923
00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:43.013
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1924
00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:44.981
<v Speaker 1>or Extendix,</v>

1925
00:55:44.981 --> 00:55:46.290
<v Speaker 1>there is warden sections of the border.</v>

1926
00:55:46.291 --> 00:55:47.124
<v Speaker 1>We're ready.</v>

1927
00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:48.430
<v Speaker 1>If he wants to extend it,</v>

1928
00:55:48.550 --> 00:55:48.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1929
00:55:48.821 --> 00:55:49.690
<v Speaker 1>it won't stop.</v>

1930
00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:50.890
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the hard drugs.</v>

1931
00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:52.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1932
00:55:52.391 --> 00:55:53.560
<v Speaker 1>if you look at heroin,</v>

1933
00:55:53.650 --> 00:55:54.371
<v Speaker 1>cocaine,</v>

1934
00:55:54.371 --> 00:55:54.881
<v Speaker 1>crystal Meth,</v>

1935
00:55:54.881 --> 00:55:55.840
<v Speaker 1>high value drugs,</v>

1936
00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.240
<v Speaker 1>they normally go through the ports of entry,</v>

1937
00:55:58.480 --> 00:55:59.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1938
00:55:59.050 --> 00:56:00.160
<v Speaker 1>So shipping.</v>

1939
00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:00.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1940
00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:01.533
<v Speaker 1>I mean they go,</v>

1941
00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:01.950
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1942
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:02.783
<v Speaker 1>or through the,</v>

1943
00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:04.270
<v Speaker 1>through the ports of entry through Leica.</v>

1944
00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:06.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have a through in cost,</v>

1945
00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:06.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1946
00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Because trucks,</v>

1947
00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:08.531
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1948
00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:08.771
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1949
00:56:08.771 --> 00:56:09.401
<v Speaker 1>you go through,</v>

1950
00:56:09.401 --> 00:56:12.450
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the Laredo in Laredo,</v>

1951
00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:13.313
<v Speaker 1>Laredo,</v>

1952
00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:16.430
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons that was a big fight in the war started there in Mexico</v>

1953
00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:18.040
<v Speaker 1>because that's a very valuable territory.</v>

1954
00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:22.750
<v Speaker 1>There's something like 8,000 trucks go over that border every day.</v>

1955
00:56:23.830 --> 00:56:24.221
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1956
00:56:24.221 --> 00:56:25.480
<v Speaker 1>if you have 8,000 trucks,</v>

1957
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:28.060
<v Speaker 1>how many of those can use search in a day?</v>

1958
00:56:29.050 --> 00:56:31.480
<v Speaker 1>And also the way they can hide this stuff in trucks,</v>

1959
00:56:31.481 --> 00:56:35.410
<v Speaker 1>they can hide drugs in like a metal.</v>

1960
00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:36.640
<v Speaker 1>They can put them in,</v>

1961
00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:36.820
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1962
00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:38.470
<v Speaker 1>in some kind of metal container,</v>

1963
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:39.700
<v Speaker 1>seal it up,</v>

1964
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:40.840
<v Speaker 1>soldier it up,</v>

1965
00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:41.980
<v Speaker 1>put a bunch of,</v>

1966
00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:43.030
<v Speaker 1>so who doesn't smell?</v>

1967
00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:44.381
<v Speaker 1>So somebody has to say,</v>

1968
00:56:44.381 --> 00:56:45.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to open that with a blowtorch.</v>

1969
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:50.290
<v Speaker 1>And as a searching after rip that vehicle apart to find the drugs,</v>

1970
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.180
<v Speaker 1>they were putting them inside wheels.</v>

1971
00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:53.563
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

1972
00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

1973
00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Mass inside ties and stuff.</v>

1974
00:56:56.401 --> 00:56:57.234
<v Speaker 1>That's like the,</v>

1975
00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:58.173
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>

1976
00:56:58.420 --> 00:56:58.980
<v Speaker 1>there's song,</v>

1977
00:56:58.980 --> 00:56:59.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1978
00:56:59.290 --> 00:56:59.610
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>

1979
00:56:59.610 --> 00:57:01.030
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the older tricks from the,</v>

1980
00:57:01.031 --> 00:57:01.601
<v Speaker 1>like the 70.</v>

1981
00:57:01.601 --> 00:57:02.231
<v Speaker 1>There's a song that is,</v>

1982
00:57:02.231 --> 00:57:02.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1983
00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:04.840
<v Speaker 1>one of the first narco corridos their drug ballots.</v>

1984
00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1985
00:57:06.010 --> 00:57:06.341
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

1986
00:57:06.341 --> 00:57:11.341
<v Speaker 1>it was called contraband and trend treason for the 1970s and that was about</v>

1987
00:57:11.951 --> 00:57:12.450
<v Speaker 1>hiring,</v>

1988
00:57:12.450 --> 00:57:13.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1989
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:15.910
<v Speaker 1>hiding marijuana back in the nine tires back then.</v>

1990
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:16.151
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1991
00:57:16.151 --> 00:57:16.590
<v Speaker 1>me now,</v>

1992
00:57:16.590 --> 00:57:17.620
<v Speaker 1>the trap cars now,</v>

1993
00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:18.730
<v Speaker 1>like super sophisticated,</v>

1994
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.110
<v Speaker 1>they have some weird trap cars.</v>

1995
00:57:20.111 --> 00:57:23.620
<v Speaker 1>We have to do like a bunch of stuff like open the door,</v>

1996
00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:27.790
<v Speaker 1>move some staff to actually to actually open file the drugs.</v>

1997
00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Other slight,</v>

1998
00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:32.220
<v Speaker 1>some trick sort of door has to be actively.</v>

1999
00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:32.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2000
00:57:32.411 --> 00:57:33.490
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine if there's a will,</v>

2001
00:57:33.491 --> 00:57:34.780
<v Speaker 1>there's a way there's that much.</v>

2002
00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:35.801
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2003
00:57:35.801 --> 00:57:37.600
<v Speaker 1>I remember hearing that from,</v>

2004
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.901
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2005
00:57:37.901 --> 00:57:39.010
<v Speaker 1>it's not a reliable source,</v>

2006
00:57:39.011 --> 00:57:42.520
<v Speaker 1>but from the Sopranos there we're talking about only 20% of all the shipping</v>

2007
00:57:42.521 --> 00:57:44.800
<v Speaker 1>containers or get brought into America gets searched.</v>

2008
00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2009
00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

2010
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:47.103
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

2011
00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:47.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2012
00:57:47.291 --> 00:57:47.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2013
00:57:47.441 --> 00:57:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2014
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:48.191
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2015
00:57:48.191 --> 00:57:48.431
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2016
00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:49.051
<v Speaker 1>so to the,</v>

2017
00:57:49.051 --> 00:57:51.540
<v Speaker 1>the hard drugs and learned a lot of time on through the,</v>

2018
00:57:51.541 --> 00:57:52.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2019
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:53.890
<v Speaker 1>the ports of entry and,</v>

2020
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:56.470
<v Speaker 1>and they have their data and other classic trick they have is you get,</v>

2021
00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:58.120
<v Speaker 1>they allow some to get busted.</v>

2022
00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:02.770
<v Speaker 1>So you allow one guy to get busted and they set somebody up.</v>

2023
00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:04.480
<v Speaker 1>So they're taking some drugs through,</v>

2024
00:58:04.481 --> 00:58:04.841
<v Speaker 1>they get,</v>

2025
00:58:04.841 --> 00:58:07.300
<v Speaker 1>they get busted or the f entities on them,</v>

2026
00:58:07.301 --> 00:58:09.310
<v Speaker 1>and then meanwhile more drugs are going through.</v>

2027
00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:12.340
<v Speaker 1>And is this the United States border?</v>

2028
00:58:12.341 --> 00:58:13.060
<v Speaker 1>That's tests.</v>

2029
00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:14.770
<v Speaker 1>That's catching this guy.</v>

2030
00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2031
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2032
00:58:16.310 --> 00:58:17.170
<v Speaker 1>So they're not getting,</v>

2033
00:58:17.590 --> 00:58:19.890
<v Speaker 1>they're not getting tested in Mexico as they crossover,</v>

2034
00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:20.111
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2035
00:58:20.111 --> 00:58:21.430
<v Speaker 1>It's only in the United States border.</v>

2036
00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:21.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2037
00:58:21.851 --> 00:58:22.121
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>

2038
00:58:22.121 --> 00:58:25.240
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they might catch him in Mexico sometimes,</v>

2039
00:58:25.241 --> 00:58:26.860
<v Speaker 1>but the majority is gonna be the United States.</v>

2040
00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:30.040
<v Speaker 1>So the United States border patrol guys,</v>

2041
00:58:30.070 --> 00:58:31.780
<v Speaker 1>are they ever caught being corrupt?</v>

2042
00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:32.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2043
00:58:32.171 --> 00:58:32.591
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

2044
00:58:32.591 --> 00:58:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2045
00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:34.750
<v Speaker 1>There's been cases of us,</v>

2046
00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:40.110
<v Speaker 1>border patrol and customs entry people who have been,</v>

2047
00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:40.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2048
00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Caught taking a bunch of money,</v>

2049
00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:43.001
<v Speaker 1>taking bribes,</v>

2050
00:58:43.001 --> 00:58:46.360
<v Speaker 1>allowing in our land certain cars through the course Sandvik was through.</v>

2051
00:58:46.361 --> 00:58:47.170
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

2052
00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:48.610
<v Speaker 1>How does one fix this?</v>

2053
00:58:48.611 --> 00:58:48.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2054
00:58:48.851 --> 00:58:50.050
<v Speaker 1>if you had a magic wand,</v>

2055
00:58:50.051 --> 00:58:53.350
<v Speaker 1>you were going to wave it over Mexico and fix this problem.</v>

2056
00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

2057
00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:56.610
<v Speaker 1>if somebody said you on,</v>

2058
00:58:56.830 --> 00:58:57.700
<v Speaker 1>you're a smart guy,</v>

2059
00:58:58.270 --> 00:59:00.030
<v Speaker 1>you've been in the business for a long time,</v>

2060
00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:02.980
<v Speaker 1>we're going to let you dictate how this takes place.</v>

2061
00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:03.971
<v Speaker 1>So I'd say,</v>

2062
00:59:03.971 --> 00:59:04.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2063
00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:04.841
<v Speaker 1>three things.</v>

2064
00:59:04.841 --> 00:59:06.250
<v Speaker 1>So like drug policy reform.</v>

2065
00:59:06.251 --> 00:59:08.710
<v Speaker 1>So we've got to talk about how we deal with his drug situation.</v>

2066
00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:10.640
<v Speaker 1>So I mean like a mirror.</v>

2067
00:59:10.930 --> 00:59:11.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2068
00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:13.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean some of that is,</v>

2069
00:59:13.731 --> 00:59:14.201
<v Speaker 1>is here,</v>

2070
00:59:14.201 --> 00:59:14.561
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2071
00:59:14.561 --> 00:59:17.020
<v Speaker 1>And you probably got a better idea than me about how to,</v>

2072
00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:18.271
<v Speaker 1>why American,</v>

2073
00:59:18.271 --> 00:59:19.570
<v Speaker 1>what Americans takes so many drugs.</v>

2074
00:59:19.571 --> 00:59:22.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean I got from a drug taking myself in the UK,</v>

2075
00:59:22.521 --> 00:59:22.891
<v Speaker 1>our guess.</v>

2076
00:59:22.891 --> 00:59:24.740
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it's not that different.</v>

2077
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:27.430
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of answers to that.</v>

2078
00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2079
00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:32.940
<v Speaker 2>the biggest one is entirely that most people don't enjoy what they do and they</v>

2080
00:59:34.421 --> 00:59:35.254
<v Speaker 2>want an escape.</v>

2081
00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:37.000
<v Speaker 2>I think that's probably the biggest one.</v>

2082
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:38.343
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

2083
00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:41.170
<v Speaker 2>there's some ridiculous number that was just a,</v>

2084
00:59:41.171 --> 00:59:44.040
<v Speaker 2>we're just who discussing the number on the podcast have a,</v>

2085
00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:45.580
<v Speaker 2>how many people actually was it?</v>

2086
00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:47.890
<v Speaker 2>It was a Johann Hari,</v>

2087
00:59:47.891 --> 00:59:48.724
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>

2088
00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:50.193
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2089
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:52.720
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about the number of people that actually enjoy their job.</v>

2090
00:59:52.721 --> 00:59:57.721
<v Speaker 2>67% people have in this country don't like what they do or you know,</v>

2091
00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.030
<v Speaker 2>are just</v>

2092
01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.020
<v Speaker 2>sleepwalking through their life.</v>

2093
01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:06.310
<v Speaker 2>There's a another significant percent that hate what they do.</v>

2094
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.420
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a few leftover that love what they do.</v>

2095
01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:14.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a very small number of people maybe like myself or maybe like</v>

2096
01:00:14.951 --> 01:00:18.100
<v Speaker 2>yourself that actually enjoy what they do for a living and feel like they're</v>

2097
01:00:18.101 --> 01:00:19.120
<v Speaker 2>following their passion.</v>

2098
01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:21.880
<v Speaker 2>Most people were just working a job and they fucking hate it.</v>

2099
01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:23.380
<v Speaker 2>And then when they get off work,</v>

2100
01:00:23.381 --> 01:00:24.370
<v Speaker 2>they want to get fucked up.</v>

2101
01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:26.200
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of these people,</v>

2102
01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:26.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2103
01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:27.040
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2104
01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.260
<v Speaker 2>they have psychological issues.</v>

2105
01:00:29.261 --> 01:00:30.610
<v Speaker 2>They're suffering from abuse,</v>

2106
01:00:30.611 --> 01:00:31.630
<v Speaker 2>childhood abuse.</v>

2107
01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:32.861
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to,</v>

2108
01:00:32.861 --> 01:00:37.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's been some significant statistics about childhood abuse and how</v>

2109
01:00:37.121 --> 01:00:40.810
<v Speaker 2>many people from childhood abuse wind up using and abusing drugs and becoming</v>

2110
01:00:40.811 --> 01:00:42.670
<v Speaker 2>addicted and even overdosing on drugs.</v>

2111
01:00:42.671 --> 01:00:44.470
<v Speaker 2>And it's ridiculously high.</v>

2112
01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:45.670
<v Speaker 2>It's about pain,</v>

2113
01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:48.970
<v Speaker 2>pain and suffering and trying to remove that pain and suffering from your life.</v>

2114
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:50.583
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2115
01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:51.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2116
01:00:51.401 --> 01:00:56.170
<v Speaker 2>people that don't know how to make healthy choices and don't have friends that</v>

2117
01:00:56.171 --> 01:00:59.230
<v Speaker 2>are making healthy choices and don't know what to do with their life.</v>

2118
01:00:59.320 --> 01:00:59.891
<v Speaker 2>That's a big,</v>

2119
01:00:59.891 --> 01:01:00.461
<v Speaker 2>big part of it.</v>

2120
01:01:00.461 --> 01:01:03.460
<v Speaker 2>There's another part of it that's because it's illegal cause something about</v>

2121
01:01:03.461 --> 01:01:06.100
<v Speaker 2>things that are illegal that are intoxicating and enticing.</v>

2122
01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:06.701
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2123
01:01:06.701 --> 01:01:11.020
<v Speaker 2>when you look at the statistics in Holland in particular where marijuana has</v>

2124
01:01:11.021 --> 01:01:11.440
<v Speaker 2>been,</v>

2125
01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:11.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2126
01:01:11.711 --> 01:01:13.330
<v Speaker 2>you could buy it in coffee shops forever.</v>

2127
01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.910
<v Speaker 2>Not that many people smoke marijuana in Holland.</v>

2128
01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:16.601
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of,</v>

2129
01:01:16.601 --> 01:01:16.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2130
01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:18.280
<v Speaker 2>marijuana tourism,</v>

2131
01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:23.760
<v Speaker 2>especially back in the day now that America has legal marijuana almost</v>

2132
01:01:24.101 --> 01:01:24.700
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

2133
01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:27.910
<v Speaker 2>Not a lot of people are going to Holland specifically to get fucked up.</v>

2134
01:01:27.911 --> 01:01:29.350
<v Speaker 2>But there was always the thing,</v>

2135
01:01:29.351 --> 01:01:29.591
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2136
01:01:29.591 --> 01:01:30.430
<v Speaker 2>when we were younger,</v>

2137
01:01:30.431 --> 01:01:31.151
<v Speaker 2>it was always a guy.</v>

2138
01:01:31.151 --> 01:01:32.680
<v Speaker 2>He's going to go to Holland and go get high.</v>

2139
01:01:32.681 --> 01:01:33.514
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

2140
01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:34.910
<v Speaker 1>I won't know.</v>

2141
01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:35.030
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2142
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.630
<v Speaker 1>I used to go there,</v>

2143
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:38.390
<v Speaker 1>one of the teenage well but never there for some of that on a,</v>

2144
01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:38.730
<v Speaker 1>on a,</v>

2145
01:01:38.730 --> 01:01:41.270
<v Speaker 1>on a boat and arrived in Amsterdam,</v>

2146
01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:41.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2147
01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:42.310
<v Speaker 1>back in those days.</v>

2148
01:01:42.310 --> 01:01:43.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2149
01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.350
<v Speaker 1>It actually,</v>

2150
01:01:44.350 --> 01:01:45.230
<v Speaker 1>it made me,</v>

2151
01:01:45.231 --> 01:01:46.280
<v Speaker 1>made me swell small.</v>

2152
01:01:46.281 --> 01:01:48.860
<v Speaker 1>What you're saying is they're about enjoying the job and is true.</v>

2153
01:01:48.861 --> 01:01:49.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2154
01:01:49.071 --> 01:01:49.904
<v Speaker 1>when he said that,</v>

2155
01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:50.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2156
01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:52.220
<v Speaker 1>I do love what I do and enjoy what I do.</v>

2157
01:01:52.221 --> 01:01:54.620
<v Speaker 1>So that's what Intel is one of the size of that thing.</v>

2158
01:01:54.621 --> 01:01:54.891
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2159
01:01:54.891 --> 01:01:55.724
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2160
01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:56.391
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2161
01:01:56.391 --> 01:01:56.601
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2162
01:01:56.601 --> 01:01:57.051
<v Speaker 1>so I mean,</v>

2163
01:01:57.051 --> 01:01:59.150
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the issue of drugs,</v>

2164
01:01:59.151 --> 01:02:00.080
<v Speaker 1>we have to talk about this.</v>

2165
01:02:00.081 --> 01:02:04.220
<v Speaker 1>How can we stop American stop spending that money or allowed that money if it's</v>

2166
01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:08.720
<v Speaker 1>going to be spent not to be going to a black market and Andy stabilizing these</v>

2167
01:02:08.721 --> 01:02:09.554
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

2168
01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:11.060
<v Speaker 1>but also a lot of issues in,</v>

2169
01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.350
<v Speaker 1>in Mexico as well.</v>

2170
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:13.243
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2171
01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:13.941
<v Speaker 1>like again,</v>

2172
01:02:13.941 --> 01:02:14.870
<v Speaker 1>that social work,</v>

2173
01:02:14.871 --> 01:02:16.310
<v Speaker 1>how do you change the reality?</v>

2174
01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:17.301
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

2175
01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:18.134
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

2176
01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>people who are abused and suffer taking drugs,</v>

2177
01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:25.730
<v Speaker 1>but people who are abusing suffer in Latin America becoming assassins.</v>

2178
01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2179
01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the weird things,</v>

2180
01:02:27.691 --> 01:02:28.051
<v Speaker 1>and on a,</v>

2181
01:02:28.051 --> 01:02:29.400
<v Speaker 1>on a moral level,</v>

2182
01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.570
<v Speaker 1>on a level of morality.</v>

2183
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>And I knew a lot of kids growing up who sold drugs and there wasn't really an</v>

2184
01:02:35.491 --> 01:02:37.920
<v Speaker 1>amazing and moral thing to think about in I sell drugs.</v>

2185
01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:39.970
<v Speaker 1>He was an easy step to take on a sim out,</v>

2186
01:02:39.971 --> 01:02:40.571
<v Speaker 1>sell some weed,</v>

2187
01:02:40.571 --> 01:02:44.160
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm gonna sell some speed and sell some ecstasy and then layer on</v>

2188
01:02:44.290 --> 01:02:45.150
<v Speaker 1>heroin or would ever,</v>

2189
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>but for somebody to commit a murder,</v>

2190
01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>that seems like a bigger,</v>

2191
01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:50.611
<v Speaker 1>a lot bigger deal.</v>

2192
01:02:50.611 --> 01:02:51.391
<v Speaker 1>How'd you get into,</v>

2193
01:02:51.391 --> 01:02:53.390
<v Speaker 1>how'd you crossed that line to becoming a murderer?</v>

2194
01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:55.800
<v Speaker 1>How do they cross that line so</v>

2195
01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:56.590
<v Speaker 2>easily?</v>

2196
01:02:56.590 --> 01:02:56.711
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2197
01:02:56.711 --> 01:02:59.470
<v Speaker 2>I think it goes back to that young boy that you were talking about,</v>

2198
01:02:59.471 --> 01:02:59.891
<v Speaker 2>the butcher,</v>

2199
01:02:59.891 --> 01:03:00.724
<v Speaker 2>that family,</v>

2200
01:03:00.790 --> 01:03:03.190
<v Speaker 2>he was abandoned and angry and hurt.</v>

2201
01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.010
<v Speaker 2>So much pain and the suffering,</v>

2202
01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.150
<v Speaker 2>that's often the case.</v>

2203
01:03:07.151 --> 01:03:08.980
<v Speaker 2>They want other people to suffer when,</v>

2204
01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:11.520
<v Speaker 2>when you see people that are doing terrible things to be,</v>

2205
01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:13.030
<v Speaker 2>but they're almost always suffering.</v>

2206
01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:16.810
<v Speaker 2>They're almost almost always wanting other people to feel what they feel.</v>

2207
01:03:16.811 --> 01:03:17.920
<v Speaker 2>They're lashing out.</v>

2208
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:19.001
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2209
01:03:19.001 --> 01:03:19.834
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2210
01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:20.201
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2211
01:03:20.201 --> 01:03:24.190
<v Speaker 2>that social work aspect that you're discussing so critical and something that</v>

2212
01:03:24.191 --> 01:03:29.191
<v Speaker 2>we've discussed about this country that how few people are putting,</v>

2213
01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:30.251
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2214
01:03:30.251 --> 01:03:30.470
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

2215
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:32.230
<v Speaker 2>and very few politicians,</v>

2216
01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:36.820
<v Speaker 2>very few people that are running this country are putting efforts into try to</v>

2217
01:03:36.821 --> 01:03:41.821
<v Speaker 2>heal these communities that have suffered from just years and years of systemic</v>

2218
01:03:43.451 --> 01:03:44.141
<v Speaker 2>racism,</v>

2219
01:03:44.141 --> 01:03:47.050
<v Speaker 2>years and years of just embedded poverty.</v>

2220
01:03:47.051 --> 01:03:51.940
<v Speaker 2>That's almost impossible to escape years and years of crime and drugs and just</v>

2221
01:03:51.941 --> 01:03:53.710
<v Speaker 2>growing up in this community of despair,</v>

2222
01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:55.840
<v Speaker 2>this is what you were talking about with Baltimore.</v>

2223
01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:59.530
<v Speaker 2>This is what we're talking about with south side of Chicago and various cities</v>

2224
01:03:59.531 --> 01:04:00.520
<v Speaker 2>all over this country.</v>

2225
01:04:00.521 --> 01:04:01.150
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

2226
01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:02.200
<v Speaker 2>they don't get better,</v>

2227
01:04:02.201 --> 01:04:02.650
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2228
01:04:02.650 --> 01:04:04.690
<v Speaker 2>They date stay fucked up.</v>

2229
01:04:04.990 --> 01:04:05.520
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

2230
01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:05.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2231
01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:10.150
<v Speaker 2>I had Michael Wood who is a police officer from Baltimore and he was discussing</v>

2232
01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:15.130
<v Speaker 2>what it was like being in Baltimore as a police officer and then looking at some</v>

2233
01:04:15.131 --> 01:04:20.050
<v Speaker 2>documents from the 1970s that detailed the crime in the very same areas that he</v>

2234
01:04:20.051 --> 01:04:24.670
<v Speaker 2>was patrolling in and this the same crime in the same areas.</v>

2235
01:04:24.671 --> 01:04:29.050
<v Speaker 2>And this sense of just overwhelming futility.</v>

2236
01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.720
<v Speaker 2>Like there was nothing that he was going to be able to do.</v>

2237
01:04:31.721 --> 01:04:33.100
<v Speaker 2>There's going to put a dent in this,</v>

2238
01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:35.110
<v Speaker 2>cause this was a lot of,</v>

2239
01:04:35.111 --> 01:04:40.090
<v Speaker 2>it was a product of in these areas in Baltimore where there was law that you</v>

2240
01:04:40.091 --> 01:04:44.110
<v Speaker 2>were not allowed to sell homes to black people in these certain areas.</v>

2241
01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:46.840
<v Speaker 2>So they kept these people in these poor areas.</v>

2242
01:04:47.110 --> 01:04:49.870
<v Speaker 2>And even though they had this desire to escape into the,</v>

2243
01:04:49.871 --> 01:04:52.300
<v Speaker 2>the more affluent or safer communities,</v>

2244
01:04:52.301 --> 01:04:54.460
<v Speaker 2>they weren't allowed to for a long time.</v>

2245
01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:55.121
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2246
01:04:55.121 --> 01:04:58.150
<v Speaker 2>there's so much of that in this country that the,</v>

2247
01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:58.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2248
01:04:58.601 --> 01:04:59.830
<v Speaker 2>the people that are in control,</v>

2249
01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:01.420
<v Speaker 2>but everybody just wants to get elected.</v>

2250
01:05:01.421 --> 01:05:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Everybody just wants to,</v>

2251
01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:03.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2252
01:05:03.101 --> 01:05:04.120
<v Speaker 2>and then once they get elected,</v>

2253
01:05:04.121 --> 01:05:05.800
<v Speaker 2>then they're looking to get reelected.</v>

2254
01:05:05.801 --> 01:05:08.980
<v Speaker 2>So they spend a gigantic percentage of their time campaigning.</v>

2255
01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:09.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2256
01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:14.790
<v Speaker 2>there's no universal effort on the part of all the citizens of the country to</v>

2257
01:05:14.951 --> 01:05:16.720
<v Speaker 2>try to look at all these areas and say,</v>

2258
01:05:16.721 --> 01:05:16.871
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2259
01:05:16.871 --> 01:05:17.350
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

2260
01:05:17.350 --> 01:05:18.280
<v Speaker 2>this is us.</v>

2261
01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:18.791
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2262
01:05:18.791 --> 01:05:21.040
<v Speaker 2>just because you don't live in the south side of Chicago,</v>

2263
01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:22.270
<v Speaker 2>that those are human beings.</v>

2264
01:05:22.271 --> 01:05:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Those are just like you.</v>

2265
01:05:23.351 --> 01:05:23.890
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2266
01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:25.060
<v Speaker 2>you could have been them.</v>

2267
01:05:25.061 --> 01:05:26.110
<v Speaker 2>They could have been you.</v>

2268
01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:28.350
<v Speaker 2>If they were you when you were them,</v>

2269
01:05:28.351 --> 01:05:29.860
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you hope that you would help?</v>

2270
01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:33.760
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you hope that someone would come in and try to fix this area?</v>

2271
01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:34.920
<v Speaker 2>Someone would try to Portman.</v>

2272
01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:38.830
<v Speaker 2>We pour so much money in the foreign countries we pour so much money in is</v>

2273
01:05:38.831 --> 01:05:43.030
<v Speaker 2>subsidizing various industries that a lot of people disagree with.</v>

2274
01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:43.591
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2275
01:05:43.591 --> 01:05:43.990
<v Speaker 2>and there's,</v>

2276
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.321
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2277
01:05:44.321 --> 01:05:45.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an economist.</v>

2278
01:05:45.281 --> 01:05:47.860
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno what economic sense that on any of that stuff makes.</v>

2279
01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:52.750
<v Speaker 2>But I do know that money is allocated in a lot of different ways and the idea is</v>

2280
01:05:52.751 --> 01:05:54.340
<v Speaker 2>that it's going to be better for all of us.</v>

2281
01:05:54.610 --> 01:05:54.731
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2282
01:05:54.731 --> 01:05:58.270
<v Speaker 2>it's not better for all of us to keep these communities as fucked up as they are</v>

2283
01:05:58.271 --> 01:05:59.050
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

2284
01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:00.310
<v Speaker 2>And there's no effort,</v>

2285
01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:01.293
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

2286
01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Very little done.</v>

2287
01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:03.670
<v Speaker 2>No movement,</v>

2288
01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:04.713
<v Speaker 2>no change,</v>

2289
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:05.980
<v Speaker 2>no gigantic step,</v>

2290
01:06:05.981 --> 01:06:06.310
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2291
01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:10.000
<v Speaker 2>no 10 year plan to eradicate gang violence.</v>

2292
01:06:10.001 --> 01:06:13.390
<v Speaker 2>No 10 year plan to radicating illegal drug sales and murder.</v>

2293
01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:14.630
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

2294
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:15.920
<v Speaker 1>this great social work,</v>

2295
01:06:16.130 --> 01:06:17.870
<v Speaker 1>they're awesome quest social workers down there and said it.</v>

2296
01:06:17.871 --> 01:06:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Awesome heroes in these places.</v>

2297
01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:23.180
<v Speaker 1>And they're somebody I talked to a lot based set up YDS,</v>

2298
01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:25.960
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Sandra who grew up in the neighborhoods.</v>

2299
01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>You're one of the first people to introduce me to a young gang members in this,</v>

2300
01:06:28.371 --> 01:06:29.204
<v Speaker 1>in this area.</v>

2301
01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2302
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:31.040
<v Speaker 1>she used to work in a factory,</v>

2303
01:06:31.041 --> 01:06:34.840
<v Speaker 1>they're going to social work and now she's a psychologist and she,</v>

2304
01:06:34.841 --> 01:06:34.951
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2305
01:06:34.951 --> 01:06:35.121
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

2306
01:06:35.121 --> 01:06:38.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean she's somebody who who really will do the work and reach people and,</v>

2307
01:06:38.081 --> 01:06:39.560
<v Speaker 1>and like save lives.</v>

2308
01:06:40.070 --> 01:06:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2309
01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:40.971
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2310
01:06:40.971 --> 01:06:41.331
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>

2311
01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:41.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2312
01:06:41.511 --> 01:06:44.300
<v Speaker 1>basic stuff you really get in the community and try and reach and they have to</v>

2313
01:06:44.301 --> 01:06:46.820
<v Speaker 1>reach the kids when they're often 12,</v>

2314
01:06:46.821 --> 01:06:47.181
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>

2315
01:06:47.181 --> 01:06:50.030
<v Speaker 1>12 and you can often see in these areas who are,</v>

2316
01:06:50.031 --> 01:06:51.320
<v Speaker 1>the kids are going to get into this,</v>

2317
01:06:51.321 --> 01:06:52.940
<v Speaker 1>who are going to be recruited by the cartels,</v>

2318
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:56.210
<v Speaker 1>who are going to get to gangs because there's certain profiles in these people.</v>

2319
01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:57.260
<v Speaker 1>They haven't got their families.</v>

2320
01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:59.260
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to some guys in,</v>

2321
01:06:59.261 --> 01:07:02.000
<v Speaker 1>in also set up wireless from the battery last Deca,</v>

2322
01:07:02.030 --> 01:07:02.660
<v Speaker 1>which is the,</v>

2323
01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:06.560
<v Speaker 1>one of the big gangs there started in the u s actually among prisoners in spread</v>

2324
01:07:06.561 --> 01:07:11.270
<v Speaker 1>into Mexico and became almost like a paramilitary group in Mexico about how they</v>

2325
01:07:11.271 --> 01:07:12.890
<v Speaker 1>recruit people.</v>

2326
01:07:12.891 --> 01:07:13.850
<v Speaker 1>And then this guy was saying,</v>

2327
01:07:13.851 --> 01:07:14.031
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2328
01:07:14.031 --> 01:07:14.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2329
01:07:14.301 --> 01:07:15.970
<v Speaker 1>we will see in our,</v>

2330
01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:19.970
<v Speaker 1>I can see from these young kids who's going to be able to kill and you know</v>

2331
01:07:19.971 --> 01:07:21.530
<v Speaker 1>who's going to be a real fight and who's not.</v>

2332
01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:25.220
<v Speaker 1>And if these people have gotten parents who love them and so forth,</v>

2333
01:07:25.221 --> 01:07:25.941
<v Speaker 1>these guys aren't going to,</v>

2334
01:07:25.941 --> 01:07:26.774
<v Speaker 1>aren't going to,</v>

2335
01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:27.770
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to work for me.</v>

2336
01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:28.551
<v Speaker 1>I need,</v>

2337
01:07:28.551 --> 01:07:30.020
<v Speaker 1>I need someone who's like got hate,</v>

2338
01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:31.580
<v Speaker 1>who's calling to anger in them.</v>

2339
01:07:31.581 --> 01:07:32.210
<v Speaker 1>And I can,</v>

2340
01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:33.450
<v Speaker 1>I can do something with one of those.</v>

2341
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:36.680
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of about the perverse opposite of this stuff really.</v>

2342
01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:39.320
<v Speaker 1>But so if people don't have that families,</v>

2343
01:07:39.370 --> 01:07:40.460
<v Speaker 1>and this makes my guess,</v>

2344
01:07:40.461 --> 01:07:43.280
<v Speaker 1>think a bit more sympathize,</v>

2345
01:07:43.281 --> 01:07:44.021
<v Speaker 1>I guess as well too.</v>

2346
01:07:44.021 --> 01:07:44.161
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2347
01:07:44.161 --> 01:07:44.390
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2348
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:46.400
<v Speaker 1>the idea of how important family is,</v>

2349
01:07:46.850 --> 01:07:48.590
<v Speaker 1>handball and loving parents is,</v>

2350
01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:49.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2351
01:07:49.071 --> 01:07:50.240
<v Speaker 1>whether you're together or separate,</v>

2352
01:07:50.241 --> 01:07:50.660
<v Speaker 1>leaner,</v>

2353
01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:51.560
<v Speaker 1>loving parents,</v>

2354
01:07:51.561 --> 01:07:52.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2355
01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:53.260
<v Speaker 1>having that and uh,</v>

2356
01:07:54.110 --> 01:07:54.943
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2357
01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:55.970
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't have that,</v>

2358
01:07:55.971 --> 01:07:56.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2359
01:07:56.151 --> 01:07:58.790
<v Speaker 1>you need social work and new people are going to offer something and try.</v>

2360
01:07:58.791 --> 01:07:59.900
<v Speaker 1>And now though there was a,</v>

2361
01:07:59.901 --> 01:08:01.700
<v Speaker 1>an interesting mayor of Midian,</v>

2362
01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:02.751
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

2363
01:08:02.751 --> 01:08:06.440
<v Speaker 1>Andrea Guajardo and he had these ideas of trying to change the reality of the</v>

2364
01:08:06.441 --> 01:08:07.940
<v Speaker 1>city and he said,</v>

2365
01:08:07.941 --> 01:08:08.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to build the most,</v>

2366
01:08:08.901 --> 01:08:10.010
<v Speaker 1>he was a mathematician.</v>

2367
01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:12.200
<v Speaker 1>So I've got to see us as a mathematical problem,</v>

2368
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:13.543
<v Speaker 1>this issue.</v>

2369
01:08:14.210 --> 01:08:17.900
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to build the beautiful building and the ugliest part of the city</v>

2370
01:08:17.901 --> 01:08:22.730
<v Speaker 1>and the worst part of the city to make and force people who want to see.</v>

2371
01:08:22.730 --> 01:08:27.050
<v Speaker 1>We made a conservatory and put it in there in the poorest neighborhood so that</v>

2372
01:08:27.051 --> 01:08:30.470
<v Speaker 1>people who want to be in this conceptually have to travel to the poorest</v>

2373
01:08:30.471 --> 01:08:33.260
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood and go there and try and change the reality.</v>

2374
01:08:33.261 --> 01:08:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Because if you see around you,</v>

2375
01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:37.070
<v Speaker 1>a horrible neighborhood at dusk street,</v>

2376
01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:37.611
<v Speaker 1>no light,</v>

2377
01:08:37.611 --> 01:08:39.050
<v Speaker 1>nothing working in a,</v>

2378
01:08:39.051 --> 01:08:39.861
<v Speaker 1>what do you turn into?</v>

2379
01:08:39.861 --> 01:08:41.960
<v Speaker 1>And if you see a nice environment around you,</v>

2380
01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:43.610
<v Speaker 1>can you change people that way?</v>

2381
01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:44.661
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2382
01:08:44.661 --> 01:08:45.494
<v Speaker 1>How did it work?</v>

2383
01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:46.971
<v Speaker 1>It for a while,</v>

2384
01:08:46.971 --> 01:08:49.230
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to know exactly because also there was a,</v>

2385
01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:53.010
<v Speaker 1>a truce between some of the gangsters there as well for awhile.</v>

2386
01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:54.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2387
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.330
<v Speaker 1>was it related to the construction of the conservatory?</v>

2388
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:56.640
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2389
01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:59.300
<v Speaker 1>the theme I have met and have the government was involved in the Theresa on</v>

2390
01:08:59.330 --> 01:08:59.871
<v Speaker 1>truth or not,</v>

2391
01:08:59.871 --> 01:09:03.830
<v Speaker 1>but there was for a time the murder rate did drop quite dramatically in Midian.</v>

2392
01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.353
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2393
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:06.141
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2394
01:09:06.141 --> 01:09:08.880
<v Speaker 1>not that I have people have carried on in a bit meti and has improved.</v>

2395
01:09:08.881 --> 01:09:12.020
<v Speaker 1>And Medi Medi in Columbia was the worst,</v>

2396
01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:15.920
<v Speaker 1>the most violent city in the world back in the 1990s and it's not in an</v>

2397
01:09:15.921 --> 01:09:16.281
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>

2398
01:09:16.281 --> 01:09:16.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2399
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:18.410
<v Speaker 1>people do like their city now in Midian.</v>

2400
01:09:19.310 --> 01:09:19.910
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2401
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:21.710
<v Speaker 1>So it had some impact.</v>

2402
01:09:21.711 --> 01:09:21.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2403
01:09:21.891 --> 01:09:22.311
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

2404
01:09:22.311 --> 01:09:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2405
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:23.450
<v Speaker 1>And the social workers,</v>

2406
01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:25.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they have some impact on individual people,</v>

2407
01:09:25.851 --> 01:09:30.080
<v Speaker 1>but I would imagine that the overwhelming volume of children that are being</v>

2408
01:09:30.081 --> 01:09:30.914
<v Speaker 1>recruited,</v>

2409
01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:33.140
<v Speaker 1>that it's very hard to put a real dent in it.</v>

2410
01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:36.860
<v Speaker 1>But I think in out quite has it had an effect because when that was the most</v>

2411
01:09:36.861 --> 01:09:39.560
<v Speaker 1>violent city in the world around 2010,</v>

2412
01:09:39.561 --> 01:09:43.730
<v Speaker 1>2011 and now is this turf war there between the Sinaloa cartel,</v>

2413
01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:47.840
<v Speaker 1>which is Chapo Guzman against local widest cartel.</v>

2414
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:49.890
<v Speaker 1>And there was a,</v>

2415
01:09:50.090 --> 01:09:53.150
<v Speaker 1>there was 9,000 killed in that city over four years of that,</v>

2416
01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:54.043
<v Speaker 1>of that war.</v>

2417
01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.131
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

2418
01:09:55.131 --> 01:09:55.964
<v Speaker 1>I was covering,</v>

2419
01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:58.820
<v Speaker 1>covering it then to just driving around from scene to scene and be like,</v>

2420
01:09:59.420 --> 01:09:59.571
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2421
01:09:59.571 --> 01:10:00.201
<v Speaker 1>massacre here.</v>

2422
01:10:00.201 --> 01:10:01.610
<v Speaker 1>Masker they're just driving around,</v>

2423
01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:01.971
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

2424
01:10:01.971 --> 01:10:02.270
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

2425
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:03.103
<v Speaker 1>this things happening.</v>

2426
01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:07.430
<v Speaker 1>And afterwards there was a lot of social work put into the city.</v>

2427
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.571
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2428
01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:09.980
<v Speaker 1>and Sandra described by lunch,</v>

2429
01:10:09.981 --> 01:10:10.641
<v Speaker 1>they said there's,</v>

2430
01:10:10.641 --> 01:10:10.851
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2431
01:10:10.851 --> 01:10:11.684
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2432
01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:12.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2433
01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.000
<v Speaker 1>I like a waterfall of,</v>

2434
01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:15.170
<v Speaker 1>of aid money coming in.</v>

2435
01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:18.380
<v Speaker 1>There was like us in a USA ID and stuff.</v>

2436
01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:22.790
<v Speaker 1>We stopped putting money into this and other different groups and the murder</v>

2437
01:10:22.791 --> 01:10:23.900
<v Speaker 1>rate did really drop.</v>

2438
01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:25.041
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2439
01:10:25.041 --> 01:10:27.620
<v Speaker 1>and it hasn't gone back up to that level since.</v>

2440
01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:32.240
<v Speaker 1>So I think it does have a real effect when it's put as a policy.</v>

2441
01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2442
01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:34.970
<v Speaker 1>and it does have an effect on these things.</v>

2443
01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:36.421
<v Speaker 1>But also when you,</v>

2444
01:10:36.421 --> 01:10:38.930
<v Speaker 1>you talked a little while ago about a magic wand on this,</v>

2445
01:10:38.931 --> 01:10:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2446
01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:43.790
<v Speaker 1>in making a police force that actually protects the community or making a police</v>

2447
01:10:43.791 --> 01:10:45.470
<v Speaker 1>force that has some kind of effect.</v>

2448
01:10:45.471 --> 01:10:45.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2449
01:10:45.621 --> 01:10:47.390
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in England,</v>

2450
01:10:47.391 --> 01:10:49.670
<v Speaker 1>which is in a pretty safe place,</v>

2451
01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:52.400
<v Speaker 1>relatively in Nice and not like police and you know,</v>

2452
01:10:52.401 --> 01:10:55.280
<v Speaker 1>hate the no beer anti police would ever growing up.</v>

2453
01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2454
01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:57.440
<v Speaker 1>and now I appreciate,</v>

2455
01:10:57.441 --> 01:10:57.801
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

2456
01:10:57.801 --> 01:10:57.951
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2457
01:10:57.951 --> 01:11:01.400
<v Speaker 1>you have police who actually protect community in some way and the same in the</v>

2458
01:11:01.401 --> 01:11:02.151
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

2459
01:11:02.151 --> 01:11:03.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean the United States,</v>

2460
01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:08.180
<v Speaker 1>the police do protect people to a large extent compared to these countries.</v>

2461
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:10.610
<v Speaker 1>And in obviously the tissues,</v>

2462
01:11:10.611 --> 01:11:13.680
<v Speaker 1>here is our issue of racism and killing and violence and so forth.</v>

2463
01:11:13.681 --> 01:11:14.610
<v Speaker 1>But still,</v>

2464
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.560
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of the people who,</v>

2465
01:11:16.730 --> 01:11:18.420
<v Speaker 4>who believe that they know,</v>

2466
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:21.750
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people believe they have guns for self defense.</v>

2467
01:11:21.751 --> 01:11:24.240
<v Speaker 4>And I respect the right to have constant for self defense.</v>

2468
01:11:24.990 --> 01:11:29.850
<v Speaker 4>But really in America you're generally safe because the police are pretty hard</v>

2469
01:11:29.970 --> 01:11:30.870
<v Speaker 4>on clamping down.</v>

2470
01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:35.730
<v Speaker 4>But how do you create a police force which really has the will to protect people</v>

2471
01:11:36.430 --> 01:11:36.601
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>

2472
01:11:36.601 --> 01:11:37.530
<v Speaker 4>how do you have that,</v>

2473
01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:37.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2474
01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:38.220
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2475
01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:38.521
<v Speaker 4>with the,</v>

2476
01:11:38.521 --> 01:11:39.170
<v Speaker 4>with the,</v>

2477
01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:43.380
<v Speaker 4>the word and the passion and the commitment to help people in Mexico.</v>

2478
01:11:43.381 --> 01:11:43.980
<v Speaker 4>That would be,</v>

2479
01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:44.813
<v Speaker 4>that'd be a dream.</v>

2480
01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:48.930
<v Speaker 4>The people that have dealt with police officers that are corrupt have a very</v>

2481
01:11:48.931 --> 01:11:50.950
<v Speaker 4>difficult time hearing what you're saying right there.</v>

2482
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:53.910
<v Speaker 4>Those people would be angry or what you're saying saying,</v>

2483
01:11:53.911 --> 01:11:54.061
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2484
01:11:54.061 --> 01:11:54.121
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2485
01:11:54.121 --> 01:11:54.360
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2486
01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.190
<v Speaker 4>the police officer's here are corrupt.</v>

2487
01:11:56.191 --> 01:11:56.971
<v Speaker 4>They are bad.</v>

2488
01:11:56.971 --> 01:11:57.870
<v Speaker 4>There is racism.</v>

2489
01:11:57.871 --> 01:11:58.830
<v Speaker 4>There are real problems.</v>

2490
01:11:58.860 --> 01:11:59.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2491
01:11:59.630 --> 01:12:00.090
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2492
01:12:00.090 --> 01:12:00.601
<v Speaker 4>and there is,</v>

2493
01:12:00.601 --> 01:12:03.450
<v Speaker 4>but I think there's also real problem being a police officer,</v>

2494
01:12:03.451 --> 01:12:03.961
<v Speaker 4>period.</v>

2495
01:12:03.961 --> 01:12:08.550
<v Speaker 4>I think police officers have an insanely difficult job and I think most of them</v>

2496
01:12:08.551 --> 01:12:09.840
<v Speaker 4>are dealing with PTSD.</v>

2497
01:12:09.841 --> 01:12:11.580
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a giant percentage of them.</v>

2498
01:12:11.670 --> 01:12:15.060
<v Speaker 4>Like all over the world and in America too,</v>

2499
01:12:15.061 --> 01:12:19.200
<v Speaker 4>that are constantly dealing with violence and the threat of violence and</v>

2500
01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:23.760
<v Speaker 4>arresting criminals and being shot at and people lying to them.</v>

2501
01:12:23.970 --> 01:12:24.930
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think,</v>

2502
01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:30.000
<v Speaker 4>I think most people are very ill equipped to handle something like that.</v>

2503
01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:31.333
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2504
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:32.183
<v Speaker 4>I agree there's,</v>

2505
01:12:32.530 --> 01:12:35.340
<v Speaker 4>there are definitely problems with the police and there are problems.</v>

2506
01:12:35.730 --> 01:12:35.971
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2507
01:12:35.971 --> 01:12:37.630
<v Speaker 4>the police shootings are rare,</v>

2508
01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:38.610
<v Speaker 4>very real problems.</v>

2509
01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:39.360
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2510
01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:39.631
<v Speaker 4>please,</v>

2511
01:12:39.631 --> 01:12:41.310
<v Speaker 4>killing innocent people here is very real.</v>

2512
01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:42.080
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2513
01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.620
<v Speaker 4>and you've always got to look for improvement.</v>

2514
01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:44.011
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2515
01:12:44.011 --> 01:12:44.581
<v Speaker 4>there's people,</v>

2516
01:12:44.581 --> 01:12:46.110
<v Speaker 4>families against suffering from that,</v>

2517
01:12:46.230 --> 01:12:47.063
<v Speaker 4>from that violence.</v>

2518
01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:48.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to belittle this.</v>

2519
01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:48.841
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2520
01:12:48.841 --> 01:12:49.051
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2521
01:12:49.051 --> 01:12:49.591
<v Speaker 4>you're not.</v>

2522
01:12:49.591 --> 01:12:50.171
<v Speaker 4>I know you're not,</v>

2523
01:12:50.171 --> 01:12:53.100
<v Speaker 4>I just have to sort of clarify because I know so many people would be hearing</v>

2524
01:12:53.101 --> 01:12:53.551
<v Speaker 4>this and going,</v>

2525
01:12:53.551 --> 01:12:53.731
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2526
01:12:53.731 --> 01:12:54.780
<v Speaker 4>Mexico is terrible.</v>

2527
01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:55.673
<v Speaker 4>The United States,</v>

2528
01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:56.280
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2529
01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:56.491
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2530
01:12:56.491 --> 01:12:58.260
<v Speaker 4>there's a ton of videos.</v>

2531
01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:02.940
<v Speaker 4>The real issue though is we're also dealing with the sheer number of</v>

2532
01:13:02.941 --> 01:13:07.830
<v Speaker 4>interactions of police have with people with the vast majority of them are fine.</v>

2533
01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:08.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2534
01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:08.870
<v Speaker 4>The sound,</v>

2535
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:09.040
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2536
01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:09.541
<v Speaker 4>the other thing,</v>

2537
01:13:09.541 --> 01:13:09.751
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2538
01:13:09.751 --> 01:13:12.300
<v Speaker 4>say that the crime of kidnapping kidnappings are horrific.</v>

2539
01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:13.080
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2540
01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.050
<v Speaker 4>antisocial crime.</v>

2541
01:13:14.051 --> 01:13:15.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm a horrific crime and his choice lives.</v>

2542
01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:16.801
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2543
01:13:16.801 --> 01:13:19.050
<v Speaker 4>there's one video,</v>

2544
01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:21.000
<v Speaker 4>a really video,</v>

2545
01:13:21.001 --> 01:13:21.960
<v Speaker 4>which really made me sick,</v>

2546
01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:23.010
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2547
01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:25.080
<v Speaker 4>which was given to a family of a kid of buck,</v>

2548
01:13:25.081 --> 01:13:28.950
<v Speaker 4>a 14 year old kid who was taken and they were,</v>

2549
01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:33.510
<v Speaker 4>they send this video to his family in Mexico and they were beating this kid and</v>

2550
01:13:33.511 --> 01:13:34.350
<v Speaker 4>saying to this kid,</v>

2551
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:34.561
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2552
01:13:34.561 --> 01:13:35.610
<v Speaker 4>this is this,</v>

2553
01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:37.160
<v Speaker 4>you in the go center camera.</v>

2554
01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:40.080
<v Speaker 4>This is your fault bitch to the mums is your fault.</v>

2555
01:13:40.081 --> 01:13:42.600
<v Speaker 4>Look how your kids getting beaten now you're going to give me the money.</v>

2556
01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:43.843
<v Speaker 4>So I'll ask him for like,</v>

2557
01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:44.693
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2558
01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:47.310
<v Speaker 4>was it $200,000 for time?</v>

2559
01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:48.660
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2560
01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:51.990
<v Speaker 4>and those kinds of crimes and a kidnapping doesn't happen in the United States</v>

2561
01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:56.250
<v Speaker 4>on a very big level because you've got effective law enforcement.</v>

2562
01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:58.013
<v Speaker 4>So some,</v>

2563
01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:58.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2564
01:13:58.290 --> 01:13:58.580
<v Speaker 4>our house,</v>

2565
01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:00.750
<v Speaker 4>I was at one conference and those are real nice,</v>

2566
01:14:00.810 --> 01:14:01.411
<v Speaker 4>real nice guy,</v>

2567
01:14:01.411 --> 01:14:03.900
<v Speaker 4>but there's people calling for the abolition of the police and they shouldn't be</v>

2568
01:14:03.901 --> 01:14:06.390
<v Speaker 4>a police force saying you really want to live.</v>

2569
01:14:07.290 --> 01:14:08.550
<v Speaker 4>Like when no police,</v>

2570
01:14:08.551 --> 01:14:11.040
<v Speaker 4>you would only live with a dysfunctional police when they can just kidnap your</v>

2571
01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:11.883
<v Speaker 4>kid</v>

2572
01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:15.130
<v Speaker 1>and like send a video to like that and you've got no protection from that kind</v>

2573
01:14:15.131 --> 01:14:15.670
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

2574
01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2575
01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:16.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2576
01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.800
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely problems here,</v>

2577
01:14:17.801 --> 01:14:19.150
<v Speaker 1>but also you've got to see the,</v>

2578
01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:19.381
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2579
01:14:19.381 --> 01:14:23.440
<v Speaker 1>the other side of having completed dysfunctional police force and what that</v>

2580
01:14:23.441 --> 01:14:23.790
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>

2581
01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:27.140
<v Speaker 2>There's just such a staggering difference between the United States and Mexico</v>

2582
01:14:27.141 --> 01:14:29.540
<v Speaker 2>in that regard in regard to gang violence,</v>

2583
01:14:29.541 --> 01:14:30.530
<v Speaker 2>drug violence,</v>

2584
01:14:30.531 --> 01:14:33.710
<v Speaker 2>just overall murders and the stories that we hear from over.</v>

2585
01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:34.760
<v Speaker 2>It's so different.</v>

2586
01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:38.570
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you could just draw a little line in the dirt,</v>

2587
01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:40.070
<v Speaker 2>he crossed that line.</v>

2588
01:14:40.071 --> 01:14:40.910
<v Speaker 2>You're in hell.</v>

2589
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:42.650
<v Speaker 2>And then you cross this line.</v>

2590
01:14:42.651 --> 01:14:43.484
<v Speaker 2>You're in Houston.</v>

2591
01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:44.751
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2592
01:14:44.751 --> 01:14:46.280
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking crazy.</v>

2593
01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:46.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2594
01:14:46.401 --> 01:14:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2595
01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:47.661
<v Speaker 1>I'm an a,</v>

2596
01:14:47.661 --> 01:14:48.001
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2597
01:14:48.001 --> 01:14:48.834
<v Speaker 1>I'm in,</v>

2598
01:14:49.290 --> 01:14:51.940
<v Speaker 1>I'll get criticized sometimes from a metro,</v>

2599
01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:56.000
<v Speaker 1>sometimes Mesic Mexican government sources or Mexican tourism sources.</v>

2600
01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:56.451
<v Speaker 1>And I like,</v>

2601
01:14:56.451 --> 01:14:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm covering this stuff so,</v>

2602
01:14:57.541 --> 01:14:58.700
<v Speaker 1>and I'm shining the worst.</v>

2603
01:14:59.660 --> 01:14:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2604
01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:03.110
<v Speaker 1>and it can give it a story picture sometime because you know,</v>

2605
01:15:03.111 --> 01:15:07.040
<v Speaker 1>when I tell a story of 49 decapitated bodies with the hands and feet cut off,</v>

2606
01:15:07.041 --> 01:15:07.401
<v Speaker 1>people think,</v>

2607
01:15:07.401 --> 01:15:07.731
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2608
01:15:07.731 --> 01:15:08.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2609
01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:09.460
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you say this stuff,</v>

2610
01:15:09.461 --> 01:15:11.960
<v Speaker 1>when some guy describing cap there and people with this kind of does,</v>

2611
01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:13.453
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2612
01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:13.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2613
01:15:13.721 --> 01:15:14.620
<v Speaker 1>if not people outside.</v>

2614
01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:17.570
<v Speaker 1>And I don't say it was well as that it is still is a great country.</v>

2615
01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:19.273
<v Speaker 1>I still,</v>

2616
01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:20.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2617
01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:21.110
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the United States.</v>

2618
01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2619
01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:22.080
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

2620
01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:23.270
<v Speaker 1>I probably love Mexico more.</v>

2621
01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.990
<v Speaker 1>And what do you love more about Mexico besides the food?</v>

2622
01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2623
01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:28.611
<v Speaker 1>I'm an,</v>

2624
01:15:28.611 --> 01:15:31.040
<v Speaker 1>I would say generally the atmosphere's good.</v>

2625
01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.890
<v Speaker 1>I just feel uh,</v>

2626
01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:35.750
<v Speaker 1>feel people are nice generally.</v>

2627
01:15:35.751 --> 01:15:38.060
<v Speaker 1>I think despite all of this horrific violence,</v>

2628
01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:43.040
<v Speaker 1>do you think it's because they don't have the same sort of a ruthless ambition</v>

2629
01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:44.500
<v Speaker 1>that people in the United States have?</v>

2630
01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I think there is a sense,</v>

2631
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:49.700
<v Speaker 1>we were talking before about why people are into drugs.</v>

2632
01:15:49.701 --> 01:15:54.650
<v Speaker 1>And one thing that occurred to me is this kind of hyper competitiveness of</v>

2633
01:15:54.651 --> 01:15:55.484
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

2634
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:58.460
<v Speaker 1>And people can feel like failures.</v>

2635
01:15:59.510 --> 01:16:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Like if you feel like a fairly,</v>

2636
01:16:00.861 --> 01:16:01.730
<v Speaker 1>if you feel like,</v>

2637
01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:05.300
<v Speaker 1>I guess maybe social media affected this as well because you see what people</v>

2638
01:16:05.301 --> 01:16:09.110
<v Speaker 1>have and you expect you to have more and you feel you haven't lived up to it.</v>

2639
01:16:09.710 --> 01:16:11.510
<v Speaker 1>I think in Mexico people,</v>

2640
01:16:12.170 --> 01:16:13.790
<v Speaker 1>if you're broken the United States,</v>

2641
01:16:13.791 --> 01:16:15.980
<v Speaker 1>if when you come often maybe feel like a personal failure,</v>

2642
01:16:15.981 --> 01:16:17.840
<v Speaker 1>how come you living in America and you're broke,</v>

2643
01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:18.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2644
01:16:18.610 --> 01:16:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2645
01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:21.100
<v Speaker 1>whereas in Mexico lots of people are broke so he like,</v>

2646
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2647
01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:24.890
<v Speaker 1>it's like you don't feel that same kind of personal failure with that.</v>

2648
01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:26.520
<v Speaker 2>When I'm there,</v>

2649
01:16:26.521 --> 01:16:31.440
<v Speaker 2>one thing that always strikes me is how happy people seem and that I think</v>

2650
01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:35.850
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain stress level that a lot of Americans put themselves into where</v>

2651
01:16:35.851 --> 01:16:40.851
<v Speaker 2>they're constantly pursuing material possessions and material wealth and success</v>

2652
01:16:41.371 --> 01:16:46.371
<v Speaker 2>and that oftentimes this leads to really exacerbated stress levels and it's not,</v>

2653
01:16:47.461 --> 01:16:48.390
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make you happy.</v>

2654
01:16:48.391 --> 01:16:52.380
<v Speaker 2>Like the whole idea of having things in our mind is a,</v>

2655
01:16:52.410 --> 01:16:54.690
<v Speaker 2>someday if I buy this car,</v>

2656
01:16:54.691 --> 01:16:55.471
<v Speaker 2>I'll be happy.</v>

2657
01:16:55.471 --> 01:16:56.940
<v Speaker 2>If I live in this neighborhood,</v>

2658
01:16:56.941 --> 01:16:57.751
<v Speaker 2>I'll be happy.</v>

2659
01:16:57.751 --> 01:16:58.081
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2660
01:16:58.081 --> 01:17:01.530
<v Speaker 2>so they work 12 hours a day to try to achieve that dream and they're never</v>

2661
01:17:01.531 --> 01:17:02.310
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>

2662
01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:03.690
<v Speaker 2>And they're always stressed out.</v>

2663
01:17:03.691 --> 01:17:06.600
<v Speaker 2>And even though the vast majority,</v>

2664
01:17:06.610 --> 01:17:07.590
<v Speaker 2>the United States,</v>

2665
01:17:07.591 --> 01:17:10.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's some insane number 34,</v>

2666
01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:12.560
<v Speaker 4>if you make one $35,000 a year,</v>

2667
01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:14.450
<v Speaker 4>you were in the top 1% of the world.</v>

2668
01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:19.760
<v Speaker 4>So there's a giant percentage of this country that's in the top 1% of the world.</v>

2669
01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:22.580
<v Speaker 4>Yet the overall happiness level,</v>

2670
01:17:22.581 --> 01:17:23.840
<v Speaker 4>at least from what I've read,</v>

2671
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:26.840
<v Speaker 4>is quite a bit below the people in Mexico.</v>

2672
01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.100
<v Speaker 4>Yay.</v>

2673
01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:28.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2674
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.820
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2675
01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:29.511
<v Speaker 4>a lot of these things.</v>

2676
01:17:29.511 --> 01:17:29.691
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2677
01:17:29.691 --> 01:17:29.841
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

2678
01:17:29.841 --> 01:17:29.990
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2679
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:32.850
<v Speaker 4>how do you see you on happiness will measure your own happiness,</v>

2680
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:34.730
<v Speaker 4>will sense if of successful failure?</v>

2681
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.751
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2682
01:17:35.751 --> 01:17:36.231
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>

2683
01:17:36.231 --> 01:17:37.730
<v Speaker 4>so that's part of it.</v>

2684
01:17:37.731 --> 01:17:38.061
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2685
01:17:38.061 --> 01:17:38.894
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2686
01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:40.460
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2687
01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:41.420
<v Speaker 4>getting the food is great.</v>

2688
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:42.030
<v Speaker 4>The food is,</v>

2689
01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:44.420
<v Speaker 4>the food at the food is my giant fan of Mexican food.</v>

2690
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:45.141
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

2691
01:17:45.141 --> 01:17:46.150
<v Speaker 4>There's a place down here that,</v>

2692
01:17:46.151 --> 01:17:46.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2693
01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:48.140
<v Speaker 4>I take the guys here that work here all the time.</v>

2694
01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:50.480
<v Speaker 4>It is as Mexican as you get.</v>

2695
01:17:50.481 --> 01:17:51.860
<v Speaker 4>No one speaks English there.</v>

2696
01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:56.840
<v Speaker 4>They have a Mexican soap operas playing on the television and the food is just</v>

2697
01:17:56.841 --> 01:17:58.010
<v Speaker 4>sensational.</v>

2698
01:17:58.280 --> 01:17:59.240
<v Speaker 4>It's so good.</v>

2699
01:17:59.720 --> 01:17:59.961
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2700
01:17:59.961 --> 01:18:00.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2701
01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:00.711
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2702
01:18:00.711 --> 01:18:01.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2703
01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:01.650
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2704
01:18:01.650 --> 01:18:03.020
<v Speaker 4>so some of these things as well as that,</v>

2705
01:18:03.021 --> 01:18:03.261
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2706
01:18:03.261 --> 01:18:06.380
<v Speaker 4>but before you took him out this border between Mexico and the u s yeah,</v>

2707
01:18:06.381 --> 01:18:06.561
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2708
01:18:06.561 --> 01:18:07.460
<v Speaker 4>it's a huge,</v>

2709
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.660
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2710
01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:13.630
<v Speaker 4>is that vast difference between countries and cultures and I,</v>

2711
01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:14.511
<v Speaker 4>and the interaction,</v>

2712
01:18:14.511 --> 01:18:17.210
<v Speaker 4>another issue I guess is the issue of guns going south.</v>

2713
01:18:17.211 --> 01:18:18.770
<v Speaker 4>And we talked about lot other crops come up.</v>

2714
01:18:19.370 --> 01:18:20.690
<v Speaker 4>It was a god of firearms,</v>

2715
01:18:20.691 --> 01:18:21.620
<v Speaker 4>a lot of firearms.</v>

2716
01:18:21.621 --> 01:18:23.570
<v Speaker 4>Like that fast and furious deal.</v>

2717
01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:24.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2718
01:18:24.210 --> 01:18:29.000
<v Speaker 4>Well the Eric Holder thing that went down years ago where they sold it was some</v>

2719
01:18:29.001 --> 01:18:33.980
<v Speaker 4>sort of a sting and they sold guns and those guns wind up being used to kill</v>

2720
01:18:33.981 --> 01:18:36.530
<v Speaker 4>Americans and even American police officers,</v>

2721
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:37.281
<v Speaker 4>ea show.</v>

2722
01:18:37.281 --> 01:18:38.000
<v Speaker 4>So that was,</v>

2723
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.280
<v Speaker 4>so the ATF or gone off this and this,</v>

2724
01:18:40.281 --> 01:18:42.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean the number of guns knows</v>

2725
01:18:42.650 --> 01:18:43.940
<v Speaker 1>how many guns have gone down,</v>

2726
01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:46.290
<v Speaker 1>but there was one study that,</v>

2727
01:18:47.050 --> 01:18:51.950
<v Speaker 1>and it came to conclusion at about two over 200,000 guns every year go from the</v>

2728
01:18:51.951 --> 01:18:53.000
<v Speaker 1>United States into Mexico.</v>

2729
01:18:54.710 --> 01:18:55.543
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2730
01:18:55.630 --> 01:18:56.830
<v Speaker 4>so that,</v>

2731
01:18:57.010 --> 01:18:57.730
<v Speaker 4>that isn't it.</v>

2732
01:18:57.730 --> 01:18:59.110
<v Speaker 4>That's an insane number.</v>

2733
01:18:59.330 --> 01:19:00.240
<v Speaker 1>200,000 guns.</v>

2734
01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:04.080
<v Speaker 1>And I interviewed a guy in prison in set up wireless for gun trafficking,</v>

2735
01:19:04.890 --> 01:19:09.890
<v Speaker 1>and he would drive every weekend from Mexico to the United States,</v>

2736
01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:11.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2737
01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:14.730
<v Speaker 1>by like 10 to 15,</v>

2738
01:19:15.210 --> 01:19:15.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2739
01:19:15.930 --> 01:19:18.060
<v Speaker 1>mostly our fifteens some other guns as well,</v>

2740
01:19:18.810 --> 01:19:20.280
<v Speaker 1>and drive them down into,</v>

2741
01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:21.270
<v Speaker 1>into Mexico.</v>

2742
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:23.040
<v Speaker 1>And it's pretty easy to get into Mexico.</v>

2743
01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:24.300
<v Speaker 1>So you drive them in.</v>

2744
01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:24.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2745
01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:24.941
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2746
01:19:24.941 --> 01:19:25.160
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2747
01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:25.993
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2748
01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:26.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2749
01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:28.530
<v Speaker 1>a piece of Piss is very easy.</v>

2750
01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:29.251
<v Speaker 1>You basically,</v>

2751
01:19:29.251 --> 01:19:30.390
<v Speaker 1>most of the time you've got no control.</v>

2752
01:19:30.391 --> 01:19:35.391
<v Speaker 1>Now he would actually hide them in fridges and in stoves and would pay an import</v>

2753
01:19:37.711 --> 01:19:39.030
<v Speaker 1>tax for the fridges and stoves.</v>

2754
01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

2755
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.650
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2756
01:19:40.650 --> 01:19:42.480
<v Speaker 1>but he was buying them and he said,</v>

2757
01:19:42.510 --> 01:19:42.981
<v Speaker 1>shit themselves.</v>

2758
01:19:42.981 --> 01:19:44.130
<v Speaker 1>And how did you buy the guns?</v>

2759
01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:45.053
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2760
01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I would no idea to say what idea did you showed to by your guns?</v>

2761
01:19:47.701 --> 01:19:47.911
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2762
01:19:47.911 --> 01:19:48.744
<v Speaker 1>or nothing at all,</v>

2763
01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.190
<v Speaker 1>said no idea whatsoever.</v>

2764
01:19:50.190 --> 01:19:50.441
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>

2765
01:19:50.441 --> 01:19:50.511
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2766
01:19:50.511 --> 01:19:51.344
<v Speaker 1>nothing at all.</v>

2767
01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:52.680
<v Speaker 1>So did buy them from gun shows,</v>

2768
01:19:52.681 --> 01:19:53.850
<v Speaker 1>see buy from gun shows.</v>

2769
01:19:53.851 --> 01:19:57.450
<v Speaker 1>But then what he would do was he was used the private sale loophole,</v>

2770
01:19:57.900 --> 01:19:59.400
<v Speaker 1>which they're trying to close now.</v>

2771
01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:01.500
<v Speaker 1>So he would go in there.</v>

2772
01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:04.020
<v Speaker 1>And then I went to the guns to a gun show in,</v>

2773
01:20:04.021 --> 01:20:04.950
<v Speaker 1>in Mesquite,</v>

2774
01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:07.020
<v Speaker 1>in the Greater Dallas area,</v>

2775
01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.790
<v Speaker 1>known as the gun show captain of America,</v>

2776
01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:13.650
<v Speaker 1>and went to Gunshow there ad asked people,</v>

2777
01:20:13.651 --> 01:20:15.090
<v Speaker 1>can you sell me guns in our,</v>

2778
01:20:15.190 --> 01:20:16.021
<v Speaker 1>I've done live here.</v>

2779
01:20:16.021 --> 01:20:16.854
<v Speaker 1>Can you tell me guns?</v>

2780
01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:19.050
<v Speaker 1>And first I said,</v>

2781
01:20:19.051 --> 01:20:19.281
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

2782
01:20:19.281 --> 01:20:20.114
<v Speaker 1>you need to be tasteless.</v>

2783
01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:20.561
<v Speaker 1>And someone said,</v>

2784
01:20:20.561 --> 01:20:20.791
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2785
01:20:20.791 --> 01:20:21.001
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

2786
01:20:21.001 --> 01:20:21.834
<v Speaker 1>Consider these guns.</v>

2787
01:20:22.290 --> 01:20:22.740
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

2788
01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:25.170
<v Speaker 1>the reason to get out is they say it's a private sale.</v>

2789
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:26.663
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

2790
01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:27.833
<v Speaker 1>some of them,</v>

2791
01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:29.140
<v Speaker 1>and I know some of the,</v>

2792
01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:29.501
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2793
01:20:29.501 --> 01:20:32.280
<v Speaker 1>the pro gun people get angry talking about this,</v>

2794
01:20:32.281 --> 01:20:33.960
<v Speaker 1>but I saw this with my own eyes.</v>

2795
01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:37.680
<v Speaker 1>They've got a whole bunch of boxed up EOF 15 rifles and they're sending them as</v>

2796
01:20:37.681 --> 01:20:38.560
<v Speaker 1>being private status.</v>

2797
01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:39.210
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2798
01:20:39.210 --> 01:20:41.500
<v Speaker 1>private sale now he,</v>

2799
01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:44.160
<v Speaker 1>so he was just to simply buying these guns and taking them down.</v>

2800
01:20:44.161 --> 01:20:45.810
<v Speaker 1>I saw right in front of me as well.</v>

2801
01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Somebody who,</v>

2802
01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:47.491
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

2803
01:20:47.491 --> 01:20:47.910
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

2804
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:49.680
<v Speaker 1>who said to the person,</v>

2805
01:20:49.681 --> 01:20:50.130
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

2806
01:20:50.130 --> 01:20:51.120
<v Speaker 1>I can't buy it,</v>

2807
01:20:51.121 --> 01:20:52.560
<v Speaker 1>was looking for different gun and said,</v>

2808
01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:53.191
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2809
01:20:53.191 --> 01:20:54.130
<v Speaker 1>I can't buy it.</v>

2810
01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:55.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't have,</v>

2811
01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:57.030
<v Speaker 1>I can't use it to buy the gun.</v>

2812
01:20:57.610 --> 01:20:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2813
01:20:57.940 --> 01:20:59.010
<v Speaker 1>and the person will,</v>

2814
01:20:59.011 --> 01:20:59.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2815
01:20:59.281 --> 01:20:59.971
<v Speaker 1>still happy.</v>

2816
01:20:59.971 --> 01:21:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Like even the private sale loophole if the,</v>

2817
01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:02.490
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

2818
01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:03.360
<v Speaker 1>in theory,</v>

2819
01:21:03.361 --> 01:21:07.080
<v Speaker 1>if you suspect the person is a criminal or we use them for criminal purposes,</v>

2820
01:21:07.081 --> 01:21:08.220
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't sell him the gun,</v>

2821
01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:09.960
<v Speaker 1>but they don't care.</v>

2822
01:21:10.650 --> 01:21:12.090
<v Speaker 1>And so one thing,</v>

2823
01:21:12.170 --> 01:21:12.421
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2824
01:21:12.421 --> 01:21:13.890
<v Speaker 1>you really want to,</v>

2825
01:21:13.891 --> 01:21:15.210
<v Speaker 1>people really want people who they could,</v>

2826
01:21:15.211 --> 01:21:17.100
<v Speaker 1>it could be ms 13 undocumented.</v>

2827
01:21:17.101 --> 01:21:20.040
<v Speaker 1>They can still walk in and buy guns and some of these places.</v>

2828
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2829
01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:21.720
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>

2830
01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:22.553
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2831
01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:23.611
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2832
01:21:23.611 --> 01:21:23.901
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

2833
01:21:23.901 --> 01:21:24.131
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

2834
01:21:24.131 --> 01:21:25.230
<v Speaker 1>that's a big issue as well.</v>

2835
01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:25.641
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2836
01:21:25.641 --> 01:21:27.230
<v Speaker 2>Those gun shows are pretty bizarre.</v>

2837
01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:27.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2838
01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:30.980
<v Speaker 2>You're walking around with a bunch of people just itching to shoot somebody.</v>

2839
01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:35.510
<v Speaker 2>They're just hoping somebody breaks in their house.</v>

2840
01:21:35.810 --> 01:21:38.600
<v Speaker 2>I know a guy who keeps a gun and his ankle at all times.</v>

2841
01:21:38.601 --> 01:21:40.010
<v Speaker 2>He keeps one in his back.</v>

2842
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:41.240
<v Speaker 2>He's got a,</v>

2843
01:21:41.241 --> 01:21:42.920
<v Speaker 2>he's got a holster that he carries with him.</v>

2844
01:21:42.921 --> 01:21:45.110
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes he carries a knife is what I mean.</v>

2845
01:21:45.111 --> 01:21:47.480
<v Speaker 2>He's literally begging for someone to fuck with them.</v>

2846
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:48.703
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

2847
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:51.430
<v Speaker 1>I've got no problem with the people who like,</v>

2848
01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:52.293
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2849

<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

2850
01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:55.180
<v Speaker 1>I talked to a guy from the Alaska machine gun association.</v>

2851
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:58.103
<v Speaker 1>He had,</v>

2852
01:21:59.370 --> 01:22:02.020
<v Speaker 1>he has about 200 guns in his basement.</v>

2853
01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:02.883
<v Speaker 1>200 guns.</v>

2854
01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:03.800
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2855
01:22:05.350 --> 01:22:06.730
<v Speaker 1>And I'd have a problem with,</v>

2856
01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:07.090
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

2857
01:22:07.090 --> 01:22:07.291
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2858
01:22:07.291 --> 01:22:08.590
<v Speaker 1>with people with doing that,</v>

2859
01:22:08.591 --> 01:22:09.670
<v Speaker 1>but then there's still like,</v>

2860
01:22:09.671 --> 01:22:13.240
<v Speaker 1>how do you stop the Gun's going to criminals the same,</v>

2861
01:22:13.241 --> 01:22:13.570

2862
01:22:13.570 --> 01:22:14.750
<v Speaker 1>the criminals in Baltimore.</v>

2863
01:22:15.190 --> 01:22:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2864
01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I also interviewed in Baltimore or gun trafficker who,</v>

2865
01:22:18.051 --> 01:22:19.690
<v Speaker 1>who's taken guns into the city of Baltimore.</v>

2866
01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:20.360
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2867
01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:20.631
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2868
01:22:20.631 --> 01:22:23.300
<v Speaker 2>the gun show loophole is very strange.</v>

2869
01:22:23.330 --> 01:22:24.163
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange.</v>

2870
01:22:24.210 --> 01:22:24.891
<v Speaker 2>That's allowed.</v>

2871
01:22:24.891 --> 01:22:26.120
<v Speaker 2>And this is coming from someone,</v>

2872
01:22:26.121 --> 01:22:30.060
<v Speaker 2>me personally who owns guns and I believe in the second amendment and I just,</v>

2873
01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:35.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that the way to stop people from doing illegal activities is to</v>

2874
01:22:35.061 --> 01:22:38.510
<v Speaker 2>make those activities illegal for people who don't do anything illegal.</v>

2875
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:39.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2876
01:22:39.230 --> 01:22:39.711
<v Speaker 2>I think they're,</v>

2877
01:22:39.711 --> 01:22:43.070
<v Speaker 2>the real issue is the psychology behind people that are willing to shoot people</v>

2878
01:22:43.071 --> 01:22:46.640
<v Speaker 2>in the first place and the deal with the overall mentality of these human beings</v>

2879
01:22:46.641 --> 01:22:49.520
<v Speaker 2>and try to figure out what's wrong with our society.</v>

2880
01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:51.590
<v Speaker 2>Curate at a base level,</v>

2881
01:22:51.591 --> 01:22:51.741
<v Speaker 2>at a,</v>

2882
01:22:51.741 --> 01:22:52.820
<v Speaker 2>at a human level,</v>

2883
01:22:52.821 --> 01:22:53.810
<v Speaker 2>that's what's really wrong.</v>

2884
01:22:53.811 --> 01:22:55.460
<v Speaker 2>It's not the inanimate object of a gun.</v>

2885
01:22:55.461 --> 01:22:59.060
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem is the human beings that are willing to use these guns to</v>

2886
01:22:59.061 --> 01:23:00.260
<v Speaker 2>commit horrific acts.</v>

2887
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:01.341
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think.</v>

2888
01:23:01.341 --> 01:23:04.580
<v Speaker 2>But when you have something like drug cartels,</v>

2889
01:23:04.581 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 2>which or gangs</v>

2890
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:06.701
<v Speaker 4>which exists,</v>

2891
01:23:06.701 --> 01:23:10.630
<v Speaker 4>and then you have this thing called a gun show and then you have this gun show</v>

2892
01:23:10.631 --> 01:23:11.111
<v Speaker 4>loophole,</v>

2893
01:23:11.111 --> 01:23:13.780
<v Speaker 4>well boy you got a fucking giant hole in your damn.</v>

2894
01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:15.730
<v Speaker 4>You know you got water pouring right through,</v>

2895
01:23:15.731 --> 01:23:15.941
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2896
01:23:15.941 --> 01:23:16.331
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

2897
01:23:16.331 --> 01:23:17.290
<v Speaker 4>how do you not fix that up?</v>

2898
01:23:17.291 --> 01:23:20.440
<v Speaker 4>If you are a person who believes in second amendment,</v>

2899
01:23:20.441 --> 01:23:22.960
<v Speaker 4>you believe in legal and responsible gun use,</v>

2900
01:23:23.170 --> 01:23:26.050
<v Speaker 4>you should be angry at that because that,</v>

2901
01:23:26.230 --> 01:23:28.120
<v Speaker 4>that represents a gigantic problem.</v>

2902
01:23:28.330 --> 01:23:30.910
<v Speaker 4>And that also represents a threat to legal gun ownership.</v>

2903
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:34.930
<v Speaker 4>Because if this keeps happening and people keep getting outreach and more mass</v>

2904
01:23:34.931 --> 01:23:38.050
<v Speaker 4>shootings happen with illegally acquired guns after a while,</v>

2905
01:23:38.350 --> 01:23:38.800
<v Speaker 4>you know there's,</v>

2906
01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:39.250
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2907
01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:41.230
<v Speaker 4>it's going to come to some sort of a,</v>

2908
01:23:41.231 --> 01:23:42.850
<v Speaker 4>a real conflict with people.</v>

2909
01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:43.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2910
01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:45.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually doing a new book about gun trafficking.</v>

2911
01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:46.600
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2912
01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:49.210
<v Speaker 4>so I'm really interested to hear about his issues and on what the actual room</v>

2913
01:23:49.211 --> 01:23:50.890
<v Speaker 4>for compromise is all log.</v>

2914
01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:55.240
<v Speaker 4>We know someone like yourself who believes in the second amendment.</v>

2915
01:23:55.690 --> 01:23:59.230
<v Speaker 4>How much room for compromise do you think there is in on these issues?</v>

2916
01:23:59.231 --> 01:24:01.720
<v Speaker 4>I may like closing the gun show loophole.</v>

2917
01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:02.830
<v Speaker 4>The other thing,</v>

2918
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:03.521
<v Speaker 4>like for example,</v>

2919
01:24:03.521 --> 01:24:04.630
<v Speaker 4>the issue of 50 cals.</v>

2920
01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:05.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2921
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:07.870
<v Speaker 4>Laugh 50 cows in Mexico,</v>

2922
01:24:07.871 --> 01:24:08.500
<v Speaker 4>the cartels,</v>

2923
01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:08.861
<v Speaker 4>cartels,</v>

2924
01:24:08.861 --> 01:24:09.694
<v Speaker 4>he's 50 cows.</v>

2925
01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:12.100
<v Speaker 4>They used them to set up ambushes.</v>

2926
01:24:12.190 --> 01:24:14.770
<v Speaker 4>They'll use it to hit a military vehicles,</v>

2927
01:24:14.771 --> 01:24:15.604
<v Speaker 4>please vehicles.</v>

2928
01:24:16.030 --> 01:24:16.591
<v Speaker 4>So they're,</v>

2929
01:24:16.591 --> 01:24:19.810
<v Speaker 4>they're the seller side of a mountain and there are 50 cows and go back and bang</v>

2930
01:24:19.811 --> 01:24:20.840
<v Speaker 4>and I go right through it.</v>

2931
01:24:20.841 --> 01:24:22.510
<v Speaker 4>They're like baseball size bullets.</v>

2932
01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:23.680
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy now.</v>

2933
01:24:23.810 --> 01:24:24.300
<v Speaker 4>Massive.</v>

2934
01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:24.960
<v Speaker 4>Quite that big.</v>

2935
01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:26.640
<v Speaker 4>But they're big ass bullets now.</v>

2936
01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:27.081
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2937
01:24:27.081 --> 01:24:29.030
<v Speaker 4>And I don't understand that a lot of these myths completion,</v>

2938
01:24:29.050 --> 01:24:30.100
<v Speaker 4>military are corrupt as well.</v>

2939
01:24:30.101 --> 01:24:30.551
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

2940
01:24:30.551 --> 01:24:32.560
<v Speaker 4>if you are an honest one or whatever,</v>

2941
01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:33.171
<v Speaker 4>you're going in a,</v>

2942
01:24:33.171 --> 01:24:35.000
<v Speaker 4>in a car and he's fucking hit by one of those guns.</v>

2943
01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:35.913
<v Speaker 4>Your vehicle,</v>

2944
01:24:36.130 --> 01:24:37.150
<v Speaker 4>the now open up on you.</v>

2945
01:24:37.690 --> 01:24:39.730
<v Speaker 4>So is there any room there do you think for like,</v>

2946
01:24:39.731 --> 01:24:40.564
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2947
01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:42.280
<v Speaker 4>clamp down on 50 cows?</v>

2948
01:24:42.281 --> 01:24:43.690
<v Speaker 4>I've never heard that discussion that much.</v>

2949
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:46.420
<v Speaker 4>I have a friend who was one and see Anthony Kumina.</v>

2950
01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:47.530
<v Speaker 4>He's got a 50 caliber.</v>

2951
01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:49.090
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>

2952
01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:49.930
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

2953
01:24:49.930 --> 01:24:51.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean the idea that you're using that for self defense,</v>

2954
01:24:51.851 --> 01:24:54.670
<v Speaker 4>unless you're going to war with Russia or you know,</v>

2955
01:24:54.671 --> 01:24:57.640
<v Speaker 4>fighting against some gang cartel gang,</v>

2956
01:24:57.641 --> 01:24:59.080
<v Speaker 4>that's a invading your city.</v>

2957
01:24:59.110 --> 01:25:02.140
<v Speaker 4>That seems that's a military weapon.</v>

2958
01:25:02.170 --> 01:25:04.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's the same argument I think for uh,</v>

2959
01:25:04.810 --> 01:25:05.643
<v Speaker 4>having a,</v>

2960
01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:07.720
<v Speaker 4>a fighter jet with Hellfire missiles.</v>

2961
01:25:07.930 --> 01:25:11.650
<v Speaker 4>Do I think you should be able to own a Cessna and fly a little prep playing</v>

2962
01:25:11.651 --> 01:25:11.980
<v Speaker 4>around?</v>

2963
01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:12.550
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2964
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:13.300
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2965
01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:15.460
<v Speaker 4>Do I think you should be able to own a jet?</v>

2966
01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:16.750
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2967
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:19.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean there are a lot of rich folks with private jets.</v>

2968
01:25:19.090 --> 01:25:19.870
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2969
01:25:19.870 --> 01:25:23.710
<v Speaker 4>Do I think you should be able to own a fighter jet that goes the speed of sound</v>

2970
01:25:23.711 --> 01:25:24.100
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

2971
01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:24.730
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2972
01:25:24.730 --> 01:25:27.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just a faster jet,</v>

2973
01:25:27.251 --> 01:25:27.580
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2974
01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:27.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2975
01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:28.210
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2976
01:25:28.210 --> 01:25:28.660
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2977
01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:32.830
<v Speaker 4>Do you think you should be able to own a fighter jet with 50 caliber guns</v>

2978
01:25:32.890 --> 01:25:33.723
<v Speaker 4>strapped to it?</v>

2979
01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:35.050
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2980
01:25:35.050 --> 01:25:36.100
<v Speaker 4>well what the fuck is that?</v>

2981
01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:37.330
<v Speaker 4>Are you starting a war?</v>

2982
01:25:37.390 --> 01:25:38.350
<v Speaker 4>Like what are you doing it?</v>

2983
01:25:38.370 --> 01:25:40.930
<v Speaker 4>This is like these levels that things get to,</v>

2984
01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:41.793
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2985
01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:42.520
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2986
01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:43.301
<v Speaker 4>that's this.</v>

2987
01:25:43.301 --> 01:25:47.590
<v Speaker 4>There's the argument against a t automatic weapons or you can't use automatic,</v>

2988
01:25:47.630 --> 01:25:51.300
<v Speaker 4>like certain states have regulations in terms of what you can and you know,</v>

2989
01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:53.770
<v Speaker 4>in California you can't even have a silencer.</v>

2990
01:25:54.130 --> 01:25:54.963
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2991
01:25:54.970 --> 01:25:59.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why because it's very bad to have that loud bang of a gun.</v>

2992
01:25:59.141 --> 01:26:00.520
<v Speaker 4>It's terrible for your ears.</v>

2993
01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:02.160
<v Speaker 4>And if you're a hunter or,</v>

2994
01:26:02.161 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 4>or someone who likes to shoot target practice</v>

2995
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:04.500
<v Speaker 2>or something,</v>

2996
01:26:04.500 --> 01:26:06.410
<v Speaker 2>that's a terrible thing for your ears.</v>

2997
01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:09.500
<v Speaker 2>And there's a suppressor that get put on the end of the barrel and will mitigate</v>

2998
01:26:09.501 --> 01:26:09.711
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2999
01:26:09.711 --> 01:26:10.760
<v Speaker 2>But for whatever reason,</v>

3000
01:26:10.761 --> 01:26:14.150
<v Speaker 2>I think mostly because of films and public perception,</v>

3001
01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:17.720
<v Speaker 2>people think that those silencers are only used by assassins or something like</v>

3002
01:26:17.721 --> 01:26:17.980
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3003
01:26:17.980 --> 01:26:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Are you using to kill people?</v>

3004
01:26:19.850 --> 01:26:20.291
<v Speaker 1>So do they,</v>

3005
01:26:20.291 --> 01:26:20.631
<v Speaker 1>they get it.</v>

3006
01:26:20.631 --> 01:26:21.311
<v Speaker 1>They convert the,</v>

3007
01:26:21.311 --> 01:26:23.330
<v Speaker 1>the semiautomatics from the states in Mexico,</v>

3008
01:26:23.331 --> 01:26:25.120
<v Speaker 1>they convert the fully automatic yes</v>

3009
01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:26.611
<v Speaker 2>here too.</v>

3010
01:26:26.611 --> 01:26:27.091
<v Speaker 2>And then of course,</v>

3011
01:26:27.091 --> 01:26:28.320
<v Speaker 2>you know about bump stocks,</v>

3012
01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:30.930
<v Speaker 2>which makes it much more,</v>

3013
01:26:30.931 --> 01:26:31.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3014
01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:32.820
<v Speaker 2>free with the trigger.</v>

3015
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.301
<v Speaker 2>I'm much,</v>

3016
01:26:33.301 --> 01:26:35.130
<v Speaker 2>much easier to fire rapidly rather.</v>

3017
01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:36.750
<v Speaker 1>So how do you feel about the issue?</v>

3018
01:26:36.751 --> 01:26:36.961
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3019
01:26:36.961 --> 01:26:39.700
<v Speaker 1>one of the issues is of having a,</v>

3020
01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:39.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3021
01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:44.920
<v Speaker 1>a database like the ATF or they're not allowed to have a searchable database on,</v>

3022
01:26:47.670 --> 01:26:49.290
<v Speaker 1>on guns in the United States.</v>

3023
01:26:49.490 --> 01:26:50.400
<v Speaker 1>So they have like,</v>

3024
01:26:50.430 --> 01:26:53.100
<v Speaker 1>they have like paper files and stuff they go through still and they can't have</v>

3025
01:26:53.101 --> 01:26:55.590
<v Speaker 1>like a digital database on guns.</v>

3026
01:26:55.650 --> 01:26:56.550
<v Speaker 1>That seems ridiculous,</v>

3027
01:26:56.551 --> 01:26:57.090
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

3028
01:26:57.090 --> 01:26:57.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3029
01:26:57.650 --> 01:26:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean you think they think I'm a bit,</v>

3030
01:26:59.180 --> 01:26:59.551
<v Speaker 1>I guess the,</v>

3031
01:26:59.551 --> 01:27:00.940
<v Speaker 1>these are the gun lobby.</v>

3032
01:27:00.941 --> 01:27:04.560
<v Speaker 1>See the idea of a guy in a registry as being a step to taking away their guns</v>

3033
01:27:04.561 --> 01:27:06.330
<v Speaker 1>because um,</v>

3034
01:27:06.810 --> 01:27:09.450
<v Speaker 1>like once you start registering that you can go then afterwards and say,</v>

3035
01:27:09.451 --> 01:27:11.490
<v Speaker 1>well we know where the guns are or whatever,</v>

3036
01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:14.970
<v Speaker 1>but how do you feel thing there's flexibility on that issue of like the gun.</v>

3037
01:27:15.570 --> 01:27:17.130
<v Speaker 1>I've liked having searchable databases.</v>

3038
01:27:17.131 --> 01:27:17.881
<v Speaker 1>I mean like with a car,</v>

3039
01:27:17.881 --> 01:27:21.600
<v Speaker 1>like you have a license plate and if there's a hit and run you just type it in</v>

3040
01:27:21.601 --> 01:27:25.710
<v Speaker 1>and you know whose car it is within seconds with gun tracing you can't,</v>

3041
01:27:25.711 --> 01:27:25.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3042
01:27:25.861 --> 01:27:27.420
<v Speaker 1>you find a gun at a crime scene,</v>

3043
01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:28.081
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

3044
01:27:28.081 --> 01:27:29.490
<v Speaker 1>You can't just trade it in or put a button,</v>

3045
01:27:29.491 --> 01:27:30.324
<v Speaker 1>your Guy Bang.</v>

3046
01:27:30.330 --> 01:27:31.320
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

3047
01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:32.820
<v Speaker 1>they have to go through paper.</v>

3048
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:36.420
<v Speaker 1>I have to go through a whole formal trace and go through this kind of search.</v>

3049
01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:39.110
<v Speaker 1>She then there's flexibility on that issue as well or,</v>

3050
01:27:39.111 --> 01:27:40.650
<v Speaker 1>or how do you feel about that yourself?</v>

3051
01:27:40.750 --> 01:27:40.991
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3052
01:27:40.991 --> 01:27:41.970
<v Speaker 2>I've myself field,</v>

3053
01:27:41.971 --> 01:27:43.690
<v Speaker 2>there should be a traceable database.</v>

3054
01:27:44.590 --> 01:27:49.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean if it's just like a car and a glad you brought up that analogy because</v>

3055
01:27:49.630 --> 01:27:50.470
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

3056
01:27:51.130 --> 01:27:52.510
<v Speaker 2>when you get a car,</v>

3057
01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:54.580
<v Speaker 2>you have to know how to drive a car.</v>

3058
01:27:54.820 --> 01:27:55.480
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>

3059
01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:57.580
<v Speaker 2>in order to have a license to drive a car,</v>

3060
01:27:57.581 --> 01:27:59.560
<v Speaker 2>you have to take a test,</v>

3061
01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:03.370
<v Speaker 2>you have to take a written test and you have to take a physical driving test</v>

3062
01:28:03.371 --> 01:28:04.210
<v Speaker 2>with an instructor.</v>

3063
01:28:04.211 --> 01:28:08.590
<v Speaker 2>They have to see and think about how many more people drive cars then own guns.</v>

3064
01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:12.040
<v Speaker 2>So it's possible to do this with guns yet it's not done.</v>

3065
01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:13.390
<v Speaker 2>When I bought my first gun,</v>

3066
01:28:13.391 --> 01:28:13.571
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

3067
01:28:13.571 --> 01:28:14.404
<v Speaker 2>here you go.</v>

3068
01:28:14.530 --> 01:28:15.363
<v Speaker 2>It's like what?</v>

3069
01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:16.323
<v Speaker 2>Like that's it.</v>

3070
01:28:16.450 --> 01:28:16.781
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah,</v>

3071
01:28:16.781 --> 01:28:17.614
<v Speaker 2>you're not a criminal.</v>

3072
01:28:17.690 --> 01:28:17.921
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

3073
01:28:17.921 --> 01:28:19.210
<v Speaker 2>we did a check check on you.</v>

3074
01:28:19.211 --> 01:28:19.901
<v Speaker 2>You're not a criminal.</v>

3075
01:28:19.901 --> 01:28:20.650
<v Speaker 2>Here's a gun.</v>

3076
01:28:20.650 --> 01:28:23.290
<v Speaker 2>And I bought a pistol about a 38 revolver.</v>

3077
01:28:23.290 --> 01:28:24.250
<v Speaker 2>That was my first gun.</v>

3078
01:28:24.670 --> 01:28:29.650
<v Speaker 2>And I went to the gun range and practice with the gun and I read about how to do</v>

3079
01:28:29.651 --> 01:28:34.651
<v Speaker 2>it and I talked to an instructor about safety and put goggles on and ear muffs</v>

3080
01:28:34.961 --> 01:28:35.411
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

3081
01:28:35.411 --> 01:28:38.950
<v Speaker 2>make sure you're protected and how to properly hold the gun while you shoot it</v>

3082
01:28:38.951 --> 01:28:39.910
<v Speaker 2>and all these different things.</v>

3083
01:28:39.911 --> 01:28:42.850
<v Speaker 2>But it's stunning to me that you don't have to do that.</v>

3084
01:28:43.390 --> 01:28:43.601
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3085
01:28:43.601 --> 01:28:48.601
<v Speaker 2>you can own 150 guns and know how to operate zero of them and they're all yours.</v>

3086
01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:50.410
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

3087
01:28:50.410 --> 01:28:51.400
<v Speaker 2>you don't even have to prove,</v>

3088
01:28:51.401 --> 01:28:51.671
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3089
01:28:51.671 --> 01:28:53.050
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck then safety is.</v>

3090
01:28:53.051 --> 01:28:53.681
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to prove,</v>

3091
01:28:53.681 --> 01:28:53.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3092
01:28:53.921 --> 01:28:54.754
<v Speaker 2>anything that's,</v>

3093
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.863
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

3094
01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:56.631
<v Speaker 1>But not me.</v>

3095
01:28:56.631 --> 01:28:57.630
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to shoot guns.</v>

3096
01:28:57.631 --> 01:28:58.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a,</v>

3097
01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:00.890
<v Speaker 1>since I've been doing research with new pickup and shooting a few guns in</v>

3098
01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:01.231
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>

3099
01:29:01.231 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 1>I wa I went</v>

3100
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:05.940
<v Speaker 4>over to Serbia and arrived in Serbia on a hangover.</v>

3101
01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:09.960
<v Speaker 4>I'd see my friends in the UK and got drunk with them and arrived in a hangover</v>

3102
01:29:09.961 --> 01:29:10.794
<v Speaker 4>and I'd met,</v>

3103
01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:11.111
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3104
01:29:11.111 --> 01:29:11.944
<v Speaker 4>the contact dancer.</v>

3105
01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:15.660
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to go to a gun club and he took me into a nuclear bunker.</v>

3106
01:29:16.290 --> 01:29:19.390
<v Speaker 4>And Find Ak 47 just came off the plane.</v>

3107
01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:20.541
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3108
01:29:20.541 --> 01:29:20.820
<v Speaker 4>Me.</v>

3109
01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:21.520
<v Speaker 4>And it was like,</v>

3110
01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:21.770
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

3111
01:29:21.770 --> 01:29:22.780
<v Speaker 4>They had a crazy,</v>

3112
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.981
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

3113
01:29:22.981 --> 01:29:26.400
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want to fight at a crazy amount of guns there so I can see it's,</v>

3114
01:29:26.401 --> 01:29:26.591
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3115
01:29:26.591 --> 01:29:27.990
<v Speaker 4>it's fun to fire these things.</v>

3116
01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:30.630
<v Speaker 4>Do you think they actually are good in self defense?</v>

3117
01:29:30.631 --> 01:29:30.801
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3118
01:29:30.801 --> 01:29:30.980
<v Speaker 4>do you,</v>

3119
01:29:30.980 --> 01:29:31.741
<v Speaker 4>do you actually think,</v>

3120
01:29:31.741 --> 01:29:31.981
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3121
01:29:31.981 --> 01:29:32.960
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3122
01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:33.541
<v Speaker 4>It makes go.</v>

3123
01:29:33.541 --> 01:29:34.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't have guns.</v>

3124
01:29:34.530 --> 01:29:34.820
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3125
01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:35.110
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3126
01:29:35.110 --> 01:29:35.943
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't,</v>

3127
01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:38.190
<v Speaker 4>when I travel in the field,</v>

3128
01:29:38.490 --> 01:29:38.790
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3129
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:40.370
<v Speaker 4>I won't go security.</v>

3130
01:29:40.450 --> 01:29:40.750
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3131
01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:45.420
<v Speaker 4>they'd generally security is going to be more of a hindrance because they're</v>

3132
01:29:45.421 --> 01:29:46.254
<v Speaker 4>attracted attention.</v>

3133
01:29:46.290 --> 01:29:46.471
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3134
01:29:46.471 --> 01:29:49.530
<v Speaker 4>Tried to attention and you've got to go basically what my hands up and send it.</v>

3135
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.861
<v Speaker 4>This is it.</v>

3136
01:29:49.861 --> 01:29:50.221
<v Speaker 4>This is me.</v>

3137
01:29:50.221 --> 01:29:51.054
<v Speaker 4>It's what I'm doing.</v>

3138
01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:53.040
<v Speaker 4>And most of the situations there,</v>

3139
01:29:53.041 --> 01:29:54.720
<v Speaker 4>you've got to have a lot of people with heavy guns.</v>

3140
01:29:54.721 --> 01:29:55.441
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to our gun.</v>

3141
01:29:55.441 --> 01:29:55.970
<v Speaker 4>These guys.</v>

3142
01:29:55.970 --> 01:29:56.803
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3143
01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:59.490
<v Speaker 4>In Central America was a bit different in Honduras.</v>

3144
01:29:59.600 --> 01:29:59.860
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>

3145
01:29:59.860 --> 01:30:00.840
<v Speaker 4>I was with guys with guns.</v>

3146
01:30:00.841 --> 01:30:03.210
<v Speaker 4>They're not out of choice,</v>

3147
01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:03.471
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3148
01:30:03.471 --> 01:30:03.600
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

3149
01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.050
<v Speaker 4>of choosing security because the,</v>

3150
01:30:05.051 --> 01:30:05.201
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3151

<v Speaker 4>the journey's himself was Karen a gun.</v>

3152
01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:10.470

3153
01:30:10.471 --> 01:30:12.320
<v Speaker 4>he was carrying a mini UC was driving his journey.</v>

3154
01:30:12.321 --> 01:30:14.520
<v Speaker 4>His friend of mine or Lean Castro's name is Greg,</v>

3155
01:30:14.521 --> 01:30:15.354
<v Speaker 4>Greg Ernest.</v>

3156
01:30:16.050 --> 01:30:18.200
<v Speaker 4>He was driving around and he had a mini UC,</v>

3157
01:30:18.890 --> 01:30:19.723
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3158
01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:20.140
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

3159
01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:23.970
<v Speaker 4>on his lap as he was driving around to crime scenes and running around doing</v>

3160
01:30:23.971 --> 01:30:24.804
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

3161
01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:25.993
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3162
01:30:26.370 --> 01:30:26.881
<v Speaker 4>but do you,</v>

3163
01:30:26.881 --> 01:30:29.790
<v Speaker 4>do you think guns are actually effective for self defense?</v>

3164
01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:29.971
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3165
01:30:29.971 --> 01:30:31.860
<v Speaker 4>do you have guns for self defense and believe in that?</v>

3166
01:30:31.861 --> 01:30:33.840
<v Speaker 4>I would simply just enjoy the sport of shooting guns.</v>

3167
01:30:33.930 --> 01:30:34.231
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3168
01:30:34.231 --> 01:30:35.310
<v Speaker 4>I hunt in,</v>

3169
01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:35.910
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3170
01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:37.770
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I have used,</v>

3171
01:30:37.771 --> 01:30:39.120
<v Speaker 4>although I archery hunt.</v>

3172
01:30:39.121 --> 01:30:40.230
<v Speaker 4>Now most of the,</v>

3173
01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:41.790
<v Speaker 4>most of the hunts I go on when I,</v>

3174
01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:44.740
<v Speaker 4>when I go to these places to uh,</v>

3175
01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:47.370
<v Speaker 4>to bow hunt specifically.</v>

3176
01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:48.720
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3177
01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:50.310
<v Speaker 4>but I have rifles for hunting.</v>

3178
01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:51.160
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3179
01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:56.160
<v Speaker 4>I have hand guns for self defense in it depends entirely on the situation.</v>

3180
01:30:56.671 --> 01:30:57.211
<v Speaker 4>That's like saying,</v>

3181
01:30:57.211 --> 01:30:59.850
<v Speaker 4>do you think cars are effective to get you where you want to go?</v>

3182
01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:00.541
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3183
01:31:00.541 --> 01:31:01.410
<v Speaker 4>they are effective.</v>

3184
01:31:01.411 --> 01:31:03.570
<v Speaker 4>If you drive carefully and you,</v>

3185
01:31:03.571 --> 01:31:03.901
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3186
01:31:03.901 --> 01:31:07.350
<v Speaker 4>use the blinkers and look when you change lanes and you know,</v>

3187
01:31:07.351 --> 01:31:11.760
<v Speaker 4>make sure you observe the speed limit and all the different laws and are aware</v>

3188
01:31:11.761 --> 01:31:13.020
<v Speaker 4>and don't crash in anybody.</v>

3189
01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:14.280
<v Speaker 4>But if you're an asshole,</v>

3190
01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:14.810
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3191
01:31:14.810 --> 01:31:15.570
<v Speaker 4>they are not effective.</v>

3192
01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:17.250
<v Speaker 4>You're going to wind up dying in a car accident.</v>

3193
01:31:17.251 --> 01:31:19.050
<v Speaker 4>You're going to flip your car over in the side of the road.</v>

3194
01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:19.980
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3195
01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:21.630
<v Speaker 4>if you're in a terrible situation,</v>

3196
01:31:21.631 --> 01:31:25.020
<v Speaker 4>it is better to have a gun then and not have a gun if you know how to use it,</v>

3197
01:31:25.260 --> 01:31:26.820
<v Speaker 4>if someone's breaking into your house.</v>

3198
01:31:26.850 --> 01:31:27.683
<v Speaker 4>There has been,</v>

3199
01:31:27.970 --> 01:31:32.580
<v Speaker 4>there's countless stories of people protecting their families from,</v>

3200
01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:35.160
<v Speaker 4>from bad guys when they have guns.</v>

3201
01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:35.610
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

3202
01:31:35.610 --> 01:31:36.720
<v Speaker 4>these are real stories.</v>

3203
01:31:36.721 --> 01:31:37.531
<v Speaker 4>They do exist.</v>

3204
01:31:37.531 --> 01:31:38.820
<v Speaker 4>There are people that I've talked to,</v>

3205
01:31:39.150 --> 01:31:39.451
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3206
01:31:39.451 --> 01:31:40.860
<v Speaker 4>you mean you can find them.</v>

3207
01:31:40.861 --> 01:31:42.390
<v Speaker 4>There's countless stories.</v>

3208
01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:45.090
<v Speaker 4>There's also countless stories of people leaving their guns,</v>

3209
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.811
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3210
01:31:45.811 --> 01:31:47.000
<v Speaker 4>unlocked and a child,</v>

3211
01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:49.350
<v Speaker 4>a child gets a hold of it and kills himself accidentally.</v>

3212
01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:49.981
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

3213
01:31:49.981 --> 01:31:52.710
<v Speaker 4>there's stories of children accidentally killing their mothers.</v>

3214
01:31:53.130 --> 01:31:53.370
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

3215
01:31:53.370 --> 01:31:54.720
<v Speaker 4>there's all those stories too.</v>

3216
01:31:55.140 --> 01:31:56.150
<v Speaker 4>So Ken,</v>

3217
01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:59.440
<v Speaker 4>a gun be effective in self defense for sure.</v>

3218
01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 4>That's why</v>

3219
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:01.030
<v Speaker 2>the military used them.</v>

3220
01:32:01.031 --> 01:32:02.560
<v Speaker 2>That's why police officers use them.</v>

3221
01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:07.740
<v Speaker 2>That's why people train and they go to the range and they take tactical courses</v>

3222
01:32:07.991 --> 01:32:10.420
<v Speaker 2>to learn how to use a gun for self defense.</v>

3223
01:32:10.421 --> 01:32:11.021
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

3224
01:32:11.021 --> 01:32:12.640
<v Speaker 2>A gun can be used for self defense.</v>

3225
01:32:12.850 --> 01:32:16.270
<v Speaker 2>It's the best thing for the best tool for self defense.</v>

3226
01:32:16.271 --> 01:32:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Other than,</v>

3227
01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:17.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3228
01:32:17.250 --> 01:32:19.180
<v Speaker 2>obviously living in a good neighborhood,</v>

3229
01:32:19.181 --> 01:32:20.014
<v Speaker 2>having a uh,</v>

3230
01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:20.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3231
01:32:20.490 --> 01:32:21.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3232
01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:22.240
<v Speaker 2>security alarm,</v>

3233
01:32:22.241 --> 01:32:23.200
<v Speaker 2>all these different steps.</v>

3234
01:32:23.201 --> 01:32:24.880
<v Speaker 2>A dog dogs are good,</v>

3235
01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.800
<v Speaker 2>especially at dogs as a trained dog.</v>

3236
01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:28.060
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

3237
01:32:28.090 --> 01:32:30.820
<v Speaker 2>guns absolutely can protect you.</v>

3238
01:32:30.970 --> 01:32:31.810
<v Speaker 2>If you're in a situation,</v>

3239
01:32:31.811 --> 01:32:33.940
<v Speaker 2>someone breaks in your house and you shoot that person dead,</v>

3240
01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:35.171
<v Speaker 2>that's you.</v>

3241
01:32:35.171 --> 01:32:37.660
<v Speaker 2>You're safer then that person killing you.</v>

3242
01:32:37.930 --> 01:32:38.980
<v Speaker 2>That has happened.</v>

3243
01:32:39.370 --> 01:32:40.770
<v Speaker 2>But it's a decision that me,</v>

3244
01:32:40.771 --> 01:32:42.220
<v Speaker 2>this is a gross generalization.</v>

3245
01:32:42.221 --> 01:32:45.610
<v Speaker 2>That's an entirely dependent upon the situation that you find yourself in.</v>

3246
01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.380
<v Speaker 2>But if you're not,</v>

3247
01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:50.620
<v Speaker 2>if you're not protected by,</v>

3248
01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:50.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3249
01:32:50.830 --> 01:32:51.301
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

3250
01:32:51.301 --> 01:32:53.260
<v Speaker 2>if you don't understand how to use it,</v>

3251
01:32:53.410 --> 01:32:54.580
<v Speaker 2>if you're not trained,</v>

3252
01:32:54.850 --> 01:32:55.683
<v Speaker 2>if you don't,</v>

3253
01:32:56.110 --> 01:33:00.610
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have training to keep your shit together when things go south.</v>

3254
01:33:01.390 --> 01:33:05.140
<v Speaker 2>Because when you're in a situation and your life is in danger,</v>

3255
01:33:05.141 --> 01:33:07.720
<v Speaker 2>if you've never been in a high pressure situation before,</v>

3256
01:33:08.890 --> 01:33:12.130
<v Speaker 2>how do you know you can keep it together and even hit something you're aiming</v>

3257
01:33:12.131 --> 01:33:12.520
<v Speaker 2>at?</v>

3258
01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:17.520
<v Speaker 2>People have wild trigger panic and they have a really hard time dealing with</v>

3259
01:33:18.011 --> 01:33:21.040
<v Speaker 2>life or death situations if they haven't served in the military or have been</v>

3260
01:33:21.041 --> 01:33:21.791
<v Speaker 2>some very,</v>

3261
01:33:21.791 --> 01:33:23.200
<v Speaker 2>very high stress situations.</v>

3262
01:33:23.201 --> 01:33:27.400
<v Speaker 2>We have to learn how to control yourself under extreme pressure conditions.</v>

3263
01:33:27.730 --> 01:33:28.481
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot,</v>

3264
01:33:28.481 --> 01:33:30.310
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of factors there.</v>

3265
01:33:30.730 --> 01:33:32.690
<v Speaker 2>But I would say the same thing as like you,</v>

3266
01:33:32.890 --> 01:33:34.810
<v Speaker 2>you would also say that with martial arts.</v>

3267
01:33:34.811 --> 01:33:37.810
<v Speaker 2>Like can you defend yourself if you know martial arts?</v>

3268
01:33:37.811 --> 01:33:38.644
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3269
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:40.090
<v Speaker 2>depends on what you know.</v>

3270
01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:43.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean some martial arts or fucking horseshit you,</v>

3271
01:33:43.071 --> 01:33:43.310
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3272
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.630
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3273
01:33:43.630 --> 01:33:45.820
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people out there practicing nonsense.</v>

3274
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.060
<v Speaker 2>And if someone who actually knew how to fight just punched him in the face,</v>

3275
01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:50.200
<v Speaker 2>they would be doomed.</v>

3276
01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:54.880
<v Speaker 2>And then there's other people out there that are experts that would be very calm</v>

3277
01:33:54.881 --> 01:33:58.150
<v Speaker 2>if someone tried to fight them and they would know what to do and what not to</v>

3278
01:33:58.151 --> 01:33:58.301
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

3279
01:33:58.301 --> 01:33:59.490
<v Speaker 2>And if the person wasn't armed,</v>

3280
01:33:59.491 --> 01:34:01.060
<v Speaker 2>they would be able to easily dispatch them.</v>

3281
01:34:01.570 --> 01:34:03.550
<v Speaker 2>It really is dependent upon the situation,</v>

3282
01:34:03.551 --> 01:34:04.930
<v Speaker 2>how much effort you've put into it,</v>

3283
01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:06.460
<v Speaker 2>how much thought you've put into it.</v>

3284
01:34:06.461 --> 01:34:06.611
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3285
01:34:06.611 --> 01:34:10.990
<v Speaker 2>but there is a lot of people out there that if you broke into their house,</v>

3286
01:34:10.991 --> 01:34:15.160
<v Speaker 2>you're making a huge mistake because they are trained and prepared and ready</v>

3287
01:34:15.161 --> 01:34:16.480
<v Speaker 2>because they don't want to be a victim.</v>

3288
01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:18.520
<v Speaker 2>And it doesn't mean they're bad people.</v>

3289
01:34:18.730 --> 01:34:19.501
<v Speaker 2>And I think we,</v>

3290
01:34:19.501 --> 01:34:22.270
<v Speaker 2>we have a problem in this country where we look at things.</v>

3291
01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:23.680
<v Speaker 2>They're very binary there.</v>

3292
01:34:23.681 --> 01:34:24.820
<v Speaker 2>One or zero there,</v>

3293
01:34:24.821 --> 01:34:25.600
<v Speaker 2>good or bad.</v>

3294
01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:26.433
<v Speaker 2>Guns are bad.</v>

3295
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:27.281
<v Speaker 2>Guns are always bad.</v>

3296
01:34:27.281 --> 01:34:28.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go on God.</v>

3297
01:34:28.351 --> 01:34:29.830
<v Speaker 2>God put bad guys.</v>

3298
01:34:29.831 --> 01:34:30.940
<v Speaker 2>Take your gun sometimes.</v>

3299
01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:31.481
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3300
01:34:31.481 --> 01:34:32.230
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes,</v>

3301
01:34:32.230 --> 01:34:34.870
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you kill the bad guy and you protect your family though too.</v>

3302
01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:35.733
<v Speaker 2>That's real too.</v>

3303
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:36.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3304
01:34:36.131 --> 01:34:36.311
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3305
01:34:36.311 --> 01:34:37.360
<v Speaker 1>I have respect for people having,</v>

3306
01:34:37.361 --> 01:34:38.590
<v Speaker 1>having guns for self defense.</v>

3307
01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:40.660
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about that shooting.</v>

3308
01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:44.790
<v Speaker 1>I've been around a few shootouts in Latin America and uh,</v>

3309
01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:45.633
<v Speaker 1>and over in Haiti.</v>

3310
01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:47.560
<v Speaker 1>And one thing about that from,</v>

3311
01:34:47.561 --> 01:34:49.420
<v Speaker 1>from a journalist point of view and being around,</v>

3312
01:34:49.421 --> 01:34:51.220
<v Speaker 1>and I've been seeing a lot of violence as well,</v>

3313
01:34:51.221 --> 01:34:52.210
<v Speaker 1>a lot people fighting.</v>

3314
01:34:52.770 --> 01:34:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3315
01:34:53.170 --> 01:34:54.580
<v Speaker 1>even going back to England,</v>

3316
01:34:54.581 --> 01:34:55.840
<v Speaker 1>people having physical fights,</v>

3317
01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:56.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3318
01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:58.400
<v Speaker 1>or with knives and that kind of thing.</v>

3319
01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:02.270
<v Speaker 1>So one of the differences I think with guns is,</v>

3320
01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:03.561
<v Speaker 1>and it's funny,</v>

3321
01:35:03.561 --> 01:35:05.750
<v Speaker 1>you can't see bullets is as I said,</v>

3322
01:35:05.751 --> 01:35:06.030
<v Speaker 1>it's such a,</v>

3323
01:35:06.030 --> 01:35:06.270
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

3324
01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:07.130
<v Speaker 1>it's like a small thing,</v>

3325
01:35:07.131 --> 01:35:10.820
<v Speaker 1>but like you can't see the thing that's hanging when you see a guy with a knife,</v>

3326
01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:11.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3327
01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:12.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like the guy's scary.</v>

3328
01:35:12.681 --> 01:35:13.281
<v Speaker 1>You can see,</v>

3329
01:35:13.281 --> 01:35:15.230
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine that knife sticking into you,</v>

3330
01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:18.020
<v Speaker 1>but the gun is like you were seeing,</v>

3331
01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:18.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3332
01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:19.221
<v Speaker 1>the object,</v>

3333
01:35:19.221 --> 01:35:21.050
<v Speaker 1>you can't see really that the polygamy in.</v>

3334
01:35:21.050 --> 01:35:22.700
<v Speaker 1>So one of the Times,</v>

3335
01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:27.740
<v Speaker 1>one of the Times I was in Haiti and I went in to cover the earthquake in 2010,</v>

3336
01:35:28.850 --> 01:35:29.271
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>

3337
01:35:29.271 --> 01:35:29.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3338
01:35:29.511 --> 01:35:30.051
<v Speaker 1>real sad,</v>

3339
01:35:30.051 --> 01:35:30.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3340
01:35:30.271 --> 01:35:31.730
<v Speaker 1>like crazy amount of debt day.</v>

3341
01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:34.910
<v Speaker 1>And we were covering the looting,</v>

3342
01:35:35.340 --> 01:35:35.691
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3343
01:35:35.691 --> 01:35:40.691
<v Speaker 1>afterwards and the police came and started firing right into where people were</v>

3344
01:35:43.941 --> 01:35:45.230
<v Speaker 1>looting and was with a camera man.</v>

3345
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:48.380
<v Speaker 1>And the police were fine,</v>

3346
01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:48.771
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

3347
01:35:48.771 --> 01:35:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Bang and [inaudible] and it drew in his same situation.</v>

3348
01:35:51.591 --> 01:35:51.761
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

3349
01:35:51.761 --> 01:35:52.850
<v Speaker 1>not right in that scene there,</v>

3350
01:35:52.851 --> 01:35:55.880
<v Speaker 1>but in another scene they shot and killed somebody.</v>

3351
01:35:55.881 --> 01:35:59.390
<v Speaker 1>The police just firing at the looters and all the Lucas started running when the</v>

3352
01:35:59.391 --> 01:36:00.171
<v Speaker 1>police or fire,</v>

3353
01:36:00.171 --> 01:36:02.460
<v Speaker 1>I note a foreign going with the,</v>

3354
01:36:02.461 --> 01:36:04.220
<v Speaker 1>how high were they firing when they were firing,</v>

3355
01:36:04.221 --> 01:36:04.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3356
01:36:04.670 --> 01:36:05.061
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>

3357
01:36:05.061 --> 01:36:05.894
<v Speaker 1>Finally split that.</v>

3358
01:36:06.650 --> 01:36:10.750
<v Speaker 1>And a camera man I was with was just sat down.</v>

3359
01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:11.990
<v Speaker 1>He was like filming this.</v>

3360
01:36:13.490 --> 01:36:15.500
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is one of the problems that wildlife,</v>

3361
01:36:15.501 --> 01:36:17.390
<v Speaker 1>cameraman get shot in these places.</v>

3362
01:36:17.391 --> 01:36:19.190
<v Speaker 1>You start feeling like you're watching on TV.</v>

3363
01:36:19.340 --> 01:36:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

3364
01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:20.953
<v Speaker 1>Cause you feel like,</v>

3365
01:36:21.110 --> 01:36:21.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3366
01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:22.850
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing the lasing loud is amazing.</v>

3367
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Look or look at what I'm watching and you're seeing this and this.</v>

3368
01:36:26.991 --> 01:36:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Let not saying run,</v>

3369
01:36:28.071 --> 01:36:29.100
<v Speaker 1>we've got to go like the fire.</v>

3370
01:36:29.101 --> 01:36:29.934
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

3371
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.580
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

3372
01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:32.090
<v Speaker 1>it's like we got to get the shot.</v>

3373
01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:34.453
<v Speaker 1>We got a go.</v>

3374
01:36:34.930 --> 01:36:35.270
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

3375
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.721
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

3376
01:36:35.721 --> 01:36:37.310
<v Speaker 1>there's another sad,</v>

3377
01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:39.611
<v Speaker 1>sad thing of a,</v>

3378
01:36:39.611 --> 01:36:40.041
<v Speaker 1>of a,</v>

3379
01:36:40.041 --> 01:36:41.900
<v Speaker 1>of a guy filming,</v>

3380
01:36:42.190 --> 01:36:42.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3381
01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:46.060
<v Speaker 1>American journalist called Bradley wrote and will,</v>

3382
01:36:46.350 --> 01:36:46.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3383
01:36:46.710 --> 01:36:49.970
<v Speaker 1>in a rest in peace who was killed in Mexico back in 2006.</v>

3384
01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:56.110
<v Speaker 1>And he was filming a shooting in state of war Hakka and he filmed these guys</v>

3385
01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:02.030
<v Speaker 1>shooting and he fell and was hit and it carried on filming.</v>

3386
01:37:02.670 --> 01:37:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

3387
01:37:03.290 --> 01:37:04.280
<v Speaker 1>He filmed his own death.</v>

3388
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.581
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3389
01:37:04.581 --> 01:37:05.810
<v Speaker 1>you can literally see there.</v>

3390
01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:07.393
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3391
01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:08.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3392
01:37:08.090 --> 01:37:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Sad has worked for news agency when that,</v>

3393
01:37:09.471 --> 01:37:10.310
<v Speaker 1>that day when he was,</v>

3394
01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:11.413
<v Speaker 1>when he was killed in,</v>

3395
01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:12.651
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3396
01:37:12.651 --> 01:37:15.830
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of courageous camera people and you know,</v>

3397
01:37:15.831 --> 01:37:18.680
<v Speaker 2>they get locked into that job and it becomes normalized.</v>

3398
01:37:18.681 --> 01:37:19.700
<v Speaker 2>Almost like you were saying,</v>

3399
01:37:19.701 --> 01:37:22.460
<v Speaker 2>the people that live in these war torn areas,</v>

3400
01:37:22.730 --> 01:37:24.920
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a normal way of life to them and all their,</v>

3401
01:37:24.921 --> 01:37:26.090
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of murders.</v>

3402
01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:28.190
<v Speaker 2>If you're there on a daily basis,</v>

3403
01:37:28.191 --> 01:37:30.080
<v Speaker 2>it seems like almost like a regular life.</v>

3404
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:31.730
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these cameramen,</v>

3405
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:33.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're courageous people.</v>

3406
01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:37.310
<v Speaker 2>You see these guys who go over to war zones and film what's going on in</v>

3407
01:37:37.311 --> 01:37:38.690
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan and you know,</v>

3408
01:37:38.691 --> 01:37:40.010
<v Speaker 2>and I've met some of these guys,</v>

3409
01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:41.273
<v Speaker 2>there's just,</v>

3410
01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:45.500
<v Speaker 2>it's a crazy way of life to just accept the fact that you're an observer that</v>

3411
01:37:45.501 --> 01:37:48.410
<v Speaker 2>might be a victim and you're capturing all this.</v>

3412
01:37:48.411 --> 01:37:49.610
<v Speaker 2>So people like me can get,</v>

3413
01:37:49.611 --> 01:37:50.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3414
01:37:50.150 --> 01:37:54.200
<v Speaker 2>some semblance of a perception to what's going on in that part of the world.</v>

3415
01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:55.760
<v Speaker 1>I went to the Philippines,</v>

3416
01:37:55.761 --> 01:37:59.400
<v Speaker 1>southern Philippines and saw the fight against the Islamic state there,</v>

3417
01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:01.033
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3418
01:38:01.230 --> 01:38:05.710
<v Speaker 1>in end of 2017 and it was interesting seeing that compared to the violence I</v>

3419
01:38:05.711 --> 01:38:06.521
<v Speaker 1>cover normally in,</v>

3420
01:38:06.521 --> 01:38:07.170
<v Speaker 1>in Mexico.</v>

3421
01:38:07.170 --> 01:38:08.910
<v Speaker 1>So that was isis.</v>

3422
01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:10.700
<v Speaker 1>They took over to city morale.</v>

3423
01:38:10.701 --> 01:38:11.534
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

3424
01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:13.200
<v Speaker 1>and it was an error.</v>

3425
01:38:13.201 --> 01:38:13.701
<v Speaker 1>They caught it.</v>

3426
01:38:13.701 --> 01:38:14.190
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

3427
01:38:14.190 --> 01:38:14.710
<v Speaker 1>it was interesting,</v>

3428
01:38:14.710 --> 01:38:15.960
<v Speaker 1>was more self contained.</v>

3429
01:38:16.050 --> 01:38:16.471
<v Speaker 1>They had,</v>

3430
01:38:16.471 --> 01:38:16.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3431
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:18.630
<v Speaker 1>an area called the main battle area,</v>

3432
01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:19.640
<v Speaker 1>the MBA thing,</v>

3433
01:38:19.641 --> 01:38:20.820
<v Speaker 1>may main battle area.</v>

3434
01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:25.530
<v Speaker 1>So in that area was isis and the Philippine army just done that at all the time.</v>

3435
01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Just like constant bang,</v>

3436
01:38:26.791 --> 01:38:27.061
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

3437
01:38:27.061 --> 01:38:27.331
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

3438
01:38:27.331 --> 01:38:27.601
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

3439
01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Bang and planes going over and bombing.</v>

3440
01:38:30.750 --> 01:38:31.351
<v Speaker 1>But actually,</v>

3441
01:38:31.351 --> 01:38:33.060
<v Speaker 1>even when you're outside that main area,</v>

3442
01:38:33.090 --> 01:38:33.841
<v Speaker 1>even if you're,</v>

3443
01:38:33.841 --> 01:38:33.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3444
01:38:33.991 --> 01:38:37.470
<v Speaker 1>we were just outside it and even if you're like 600 meters or 600 meters from</v>

3445
01:38:37.471 --> 01:38:38.250
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3446
01:38:38.250 --> 01:38:38.790
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

3447
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:39.840
<v Speaker 1>you're not in the fighting,</v>

3448
01:38:39.841 --> 01:38:41.190
<v Speaker 1>the fighting is over there.</v>

3449
01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in something like Mexico,</v>

3450
01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:46.590
<v Speaker 1>South America locked on this fighting is kind of happening everywhere.</v>

3451
01:38:46.591 --> 01:38:50.520
<v Speaker 1>There's no real control over Wayne where the main battle area is.</v>

3452
01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:51.741
<v Speaker 1>But there,</v>

3453
01:38:51.741 --> 01:38:54.600
<v Speaker 1>they didn't really let any journalists inside,</v>

3454
01:38:54.601 --> 01:38:58.050
<v Speaker 1>like deep into the main battle there and didn't really let any journalists in,</v>

3455
01:38:58.051 --> 01:39:03.051
<v Speaker 1>was sitting outside and hearing just constant ricochet of gunfire and,</v>

3456
01:39:03.210 --> 01:39:05.880
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes bullets will come out of the area.</v>

3457
01:39:05.881 --> 01:39:10.860
<v Speaker 1>So there was an Australian guy and I think he bent over to pick up some cookies</v>

3458
01:39:11.550 --> 01:39:13.200
<v Speaker 1>and a bullet hit him in the neck.</v>

3459
01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3460
01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:14.941
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3461
01:39:14.941 --> 01:39:19.941
<v Speaker 1>saw the x ray actually the bullet embedded in the side of his neck and Nestle,</v>

3462
01:39:20.551 --> 01:39:23.970
<v Speaker 1>it takes taken out and he was so it must've been at the end of its terminal</v>

3463
01:39:23.971 --> 01:39:24.804
<v Speaker 1>velocity.</v>

3464
01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:25.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3465
01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:25.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3466
01:39:25.861 --> 01:39:27.090
<v Speaker 1>So it must have been a far,</v>

3467
01:39:27.091 --> 01:39:27.511
<v Speaker 1>far,</v>

3468
01:39:27.511 --> 01:39:28.380
<v Speaker 1>far shot.</v>

3469
01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:29.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3470
01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:29.471
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3471
01:39:29.471 --> 01:39:29.611
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3472
01:39:29.611 --> 01:39:31.830
<v Speaker 1>That went through something else for it hit him.</v>

3473
01:39:31.890 --> 01:39:32.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3474
01:39:32.131 --> 01:39:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3475
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3476
01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:33.181
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3477
01:39:33.181 --> 01:39:33.720
<v Speaker 1>so he,</v>

3478
01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:34.050
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

3479
01:39:34.050 --> 01:39:36.680
<v Speaker 1>maybe it didn't go into fast though that crazy though.</v>

3480
01:39:36.690 --> 01:39:37.040
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

3481
01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3482
01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:37.621
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3483
01:39:37.621 --> 01:39:38.560
<v Speaker 1>So it was kind of a of beans.</v>

3484
01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3485
01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:39.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3486
01:39:39.511 --> 01:39:40.630
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

3487
01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Kay.</v>

3488
01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:43.590
<v Speaker 1>He was okay with it or that guy's lucky.</v>

3489
01:39:43.770 --> 01:39:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3490
01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:45.720
<v Speaker 1>It's shot in the neck and you are okay.</v>

3491
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:46.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3492
01:39:46.051 --> 01:39:46.560
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3493
01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:46.921
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3494
01:39:46.921 --> 01:39:47.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3495
01:39:47.190 --> 01:39:47.641
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

3496
01:39:47.641 --> 01:39:48.170
<v Speaker 1>in terms of,</v>

3497
01:39:48.170 --> 01:39:48.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3498
01:39:48.350 --> 01:39:50.070
<v Speaker 1>some of the people who've really been in a,</v>

3499
01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:51.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3500
01:39:51.390 --> 01:39:51.661
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

3501
01:39:51.661 --> 01:39:51.861
<v Speaker 1>they would,</v>

3502
01:39:51.861 --> 01:39:52.320
<v Speaker 1>they had a,</v>

3503
01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:53.153
<v Speaker 1>one of the guys,</v>

3504
01:39:53.230 --> 01:39:54.063
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3505
01:39:54.090 --> 01:39:59.090
<v Speaker 1>one of the police special force guys had a camera on his helmet and he went,</v>

3506
01:39:59.161 --> 01:40:01.740
<v Speaker 1>he showed me that footage and he was right there.</v>

3507
01:40:01.741 --> 01:40:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Right inside they're going,</v>

3508
01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:04.110
<v Speaker 1>they're like really,</v>

3509
01:40:04.140 --> 01:40:07.500
<v Speaker 1>really close buildings fighting with Islamic isis people.</v>

3510
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:11.730
<v Speaker 1>And it was the same techniques I talked to the general and he had a big chart</v>

3511
01:40:12.090 --> 01:40:17.090
<v Speaker 1>showing how the techniques of guerrilla warfare had evolved from like Fallujah,</v>

3512
01:40:17.730 --> 01:40:18.563
<v Speaker 1>Aleppo,</v>

3513
01:40:18.930 --> 01:40:19.763
<v Speaker 1>Mosul,</v>

3514
01:40:20.070 --> 01:40:24.240
<v Speaker 1>and how this kind of weird new form of guerrilla warfare they have of like</v>

3515
01:40:24.241 --> 01:40:26.580
<v Speaker 1>fighting house to house.</v>

3516
01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3517
01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:29.910
<v Speaker 1>so there'll be besties is suicidal kind of guerrilla war.</v>

3518
01:40:29.911 --> 01:40:32.340
<v Speaker 1>They rise up and there'll be like,</v>

3519
01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:32.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3520
01:40:32.641 --> 01:40:34.200
<v Speaker 1>super close fighting really close.</v>

3521
01:40:34.210 --> 01:40:34.770
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

3522
01:40:34.770 --> 01:40:38.990
<v Speaker 1>and then when the bond they'd hired in like in a basement and stuff and they,</v>

3523
01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:43.230
<v Speaker 1>they drill holes in the walls so they can fire through and fight through.</v>

3524
01:40:43.650 --> 01:40:45.000
<v Speaker 1>And the footage he had,</v>

3525
01:40:45.001 --> 01:40:48.100
<v Speaker 1>he showed me the footage he had from being like Ryan side,</v>

3526
01:40:48.101 --> 01:40:48.601
<v Speaker 1>close up,</v>

3527
01:40:48.601 --> 01:40:49.650
<v Speaker 1>like running literally in a room,</v>

3528
01:40:49.651 --> 01:40:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

3529
01:40:50.250 --> 01:40:51.180
<v Speaker 1>taking these people out.</v>

3530
01:40:51.690 --> 01:40:52.260
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>

3531
01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:52.860
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3532
01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:54.100
<v Speaker 1>this just crazy.</v>

3533
01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:57.970
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to persuade the guy to let me pull that footage out there.</v>

3534
01:40:58.230 --> 01:40:58.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3535
01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:00.880
<v Speaker 1>it did look kind of crazy video game,</v>

3536
01:41:00.881 --> 01:41:02.050
<v Speaker 1>kind of cooler warfare.</v>

3537
01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:05.170
<v Speaker 1>So could've offered article called call [inaudible].</v>

3538
01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:06.213
<v Speaker 1>Judy could,</v>

3539
01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:07.313
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>

3540
01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:08.261
<v Speaker 1>could have Judy.</v>

3541
01:41:08.261 --> 01:41:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3542
01:41:09.070 --> 01:41:09.903
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3543
01:41:11.110 --> 01:41:11.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3544
01:41:11.530 --> 01:41:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Mexico right now is almost like a war.</v>

3545
01:41:15.130 --> 01:41:15.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3546
01:41:15.461 --> 01:41:16.960
<v Speaker 1>you can call it a drug war,</v>

3547
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:18.820
<v Speaker 1>but because there's no,</v>

3548
01:41:18.910 --> 01:41:21.220
<v Speaker 1>it's not like an army versus army more.</v>

3549
01:41:21.220 --> 01:41:22.360
<v Speaker 1>We don't think about it that way.</v>

3550
01:41:22.361 --> 01:41:24.060
<v Speaker 1>But from,</v>

3551
01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:27.610
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the amount of violence that goes on over there and the amount of</v>

3552
01:41:27.611 --> 01:41:29.440
<v Speaker 1>casualties it rivals,</v>

3553
01:41:29.441 --> 01:41:31.090
<v Speaker 1>anything that's going on in the world right now.</v>

3554
01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:31.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3555
01:41:31.481 --> 01:41:36.010
<v Speaker 1>So I'll be talking a lot about this over the years and with some experts is a</v>

3556
01:41:36.011 --> 01:41:37.690
<v Speaker 1>good writer called Robert Bunker,</v>

3557
01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:41.710
<v Speaker 1>who's an external research if it a Pentagon and he investigates this stuff.</v>

3558
01:41:42.370 --> 01:41:44.710
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy called John Sullivan from here in California,</v>

3559
01:41:44.711 --> 01:41:48.530
<v Speaker 1>was a police officer who also did a bunch of research and you know,</v>

3560
01:41:48.550 --> 01:41:49.600
<v Speaker 1>got like a doctorate in,</v>

3561
01:41:49.601 --> 01:41:49.841
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3562
01:41:49.841 --> 01:41:50.021
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3563
01:41:50.021 --> 01:41:51.220
<v Speaker 1>in starting all this stuff as well.</v>

3564
01:41:51.850 --> 01:41:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Talk to them about their ideas about what this means,</v>

3565
01:41:54.341 --> 01:41:54.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3566
01:41:54.551 --> 01:41:55.241
<v Speaker 1>what is the,</v>

3567
01:41:55.241 --> 01:41:56.074
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3568
01:41:56.140 --> 01:41:56.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3569
01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:59.200
<v Speaker 1>how can we define this in terms of warfare,</v>

3570
01:41:59.340 --> 01:41:59.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3571
01:41:59.650 --> 01:42:00.483
<v Speaker 1>how's it fit in?</v>

3572
01:42:01.210 --> 01:42:02.620
<v Speaker 1>And they directed me to one,</v>

3573
01:42:02.710 --> 01:42:06.430
<v Speaker 1>a book by an Israeli historian called the transformation of war.</v>

3574
01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:09.880
<v Speaker 1>And this was written back in the early 1990s,</v>

3575
01:42:09.881 --> 01:42:13.270
<v Speaker 1>and he basically predicted then you're going to see a transformation in,</v>

3576
01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.440
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3577
01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:15.640
<v Speaker 1>in war and armed conflict around the world.</v>

3578
01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:17.850
<v Speaker 1>And in our,</v>

3579
01:42:17.851 --> 01:42:19.180
<v Speaker 1>we have like nuclear weapons,</v>

3580
01:42:19.390 --> 01:42:19.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3581
01:42:19.810 --> 01:42:22.960
<v Speaker 1>but they're useless in these situations and a nuclear weapons.</v>

3582
01:42:22.961 --> 01:42:25.960
<v Speaker 1>You can't use a nuclear weapon to solve the problem in Mexico.</v>

3583
01:42:25.961 --> 01:42:29.170
<v Speaker 1>You can't use a nuclear weapon to deal with Islamic state,</v>

3584
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:30.161
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3585
01:42:30.161 --> 01:42:30.371
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

3586
01:42:30.371 --> 01:42:32.590
<v Speaker 1>these internally insurgencies in countries.</v>

3587
01:42:33.130 --> 01:42:36.340
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at and Mexico,</v>

3588
01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:37.151
<v Speaker 1>so kind of weird,</v>

3589
01:42:37.151 --> 01:42:41.920
<v Speaker 1>hybrid hybrid says soap with tween crime and war.</v>

3590
01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:45.250
<v Speaker 1>So I use the word crime Wallace in some of these places,</v>

3591
01:42:45.251 --> 01:42:46.330
<v Speaker 1>say my Mexico,</v>

3592
01:42:46.930 --> 01:42:47.860
<v Speaker 1>El Salvador,</v>

3593
01:42:47.861 --> 01:42:48.521
<v Speaker 1>Guatemala,</v>

3594
01:42:48.521 --> 01:42:49.354
<v Speaker 1>Honduras,</v>

3595
01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:50.860
<v Speaker 1>where you have now,</v>

3596
01:42:50.861 --> 01:42:52.930
<v Speaker 1>maybe there are some situations in Mexico where it be,</v>

3597
01:42:52.990 --> 01:42:53.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3598
01:42:53.170 --> 01:42:53.431
<v Speaker 1>the Co,</v>

3599
01:42:53.431 --> 01:42:53.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3600
01:42:53.590 --> 01:42:57.310
<v Speaker 1>there was a group who called the helis go new generation cartel,</v>

3601
01:42:58.020 --> 01:42:58.451
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>

3602
01:42:58.451 --> 01:43:02.500
<v Speaker 1>a guy shot down and military helicopter using an RPG seven.</v>

3603
01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3604
01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:03.971
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3605
01:43:03.971 --> 01:43:07.000
<v Speaker 1>and that killed eight soldiers and a federal policeman in the helicopter.</v>

3606
01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:09.190
<v Speaker 1>There was one shoot out,</v>

3607
01:43:09.191 --> 01:43:14.191
<v Speaker 1>which involved 2000 federal police and five hungered security.</v>

3608
01:43:15.861 --> 01:43:19.390
<v Speaker 1>It was like 500 cartel hitmen had this crazy battle.</v>

3609
01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:24.880
<v Speaker 1>Mitchell can sometimes you actually get acid starts to look more like a kind of</v>

3610
01:43:24.881 --> 01:43:25.720
<v Speaker 1>regular conflict.</v>

3611
01:43:26.110 --> 01:43:27.370
<v Speaker 1>But generally it's all,</v>

3612
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:29.190
<v Speaker 1>you know what way more kind of hybrids.</v>

3613
01:43:29.191 --> 01:43:30.400
<v Speaker 1>There's kind of weird mix.</v>

3614
01:43:30.401 --> 01:43:32.920
<v Speaker 1>And Taj trying to get my head around is for a long time,</v>

3615
01:43:32.921 --> 01:43:35.230
<v Speaker 1>for some years I was trying to thinking or is this a civil war?</v>

3616
01:43:35.770 --> 01:43:36.521
<v Speaker 1>Should we look at it?</v>

3617
01:43:36.521 --> 01:43:37.570
<v Speaker 1>And then it becomes okay this.</v>

3618
01:43:37.571 --> 01:43:38.171
<v Speaker 1>And then it was,</v>

3619
01:43:38.171 --> 01:43:39.340
<v Speaker 1>we know Robert Bunker when heat,</v>

3620
01:43:39.341 --> 01:43:40.780
<v Speaker 1>when I talked to him one time and he said,</v>

3621
01:43:41.530 --> 01:43:41.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3622
01:43:41.771 --> 01:43:44.930
<v Speaker 1>like this doesn't fit into these theories in,</v>

3623
01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:45.970
<v Speaker 1>he's not quite war.</v>

3624
01:43:45.971 --> 01:43:46.870
<v Speaker 1>It's more than crime.</v>

3625
01:43:46.871 --> 01:43:48.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird hybrid in between,</v>

3626
01:43:49.310 --> 01:43:49.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3627
01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:50.950
<v Speaker 1>to kind of crime war.</v>

3628
01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:52.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's the way you got to understand these,</v>

3629
01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:53.233
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

3630
01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:56.000
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of the conflicts amount of world today,</v>

3631
01:43:56.001 --> 01:43:56.691
<v Speaker 1>these are spreading.</v>

3632
01:43:56.691 --> 01:43:56.841
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3633
01:43:56.841 --> 01:43:58.310
<v Speaker 1>you look up Somalia,</v>

3634
01:43:58.311 --> 01:43:59.360
<v Speaker 1>you look at Libya,</v>

3635
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:01.340
<v Speaker 1>you look at a lot of these places,</v>

3636
01:44:01.341 --> 01:44:03.320
<v Speaker 1>it kind of weird mix instability.</v>

3637
01:44:03.890 --> 01:44:06.230
<v Speaker 1>And then this is what a lot of refugees are fleeing from.</v>

3638
01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:07.371
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3639
01:44:07.371 --> 01:44:07.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3640
01:44:07.730 --> 01:44:08.391
<v Speaker 1>I was down in,</v>

3641
01:44:08.391 --> 01:44:09.224
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3642
01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:10.813
<v Speaker 1>to Kuana,</v>

3643
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.863
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3644
01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Christmas I fired the migrant caravan that came through Mexico Central</v>

3645
01:44:15.981 --> 01:44:16.814
<v Speaker 1>Americans,</v>

3646
01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:17.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3647
01:44:17.451 --> 01:44:18.380
<v Speaker 1>which caused a big,</v>

3648
01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:21.830
<v Speaker 1>a big storm here that Trump kind of here before the election.</v>

3649
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:23.540
<v Speaker 1>What was that like or is that overblown?</v>

3650
01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3651
01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:26.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a big deal.</v>

3652
01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3653
01:44:27.650 --> 01:44:29.030
<v Speaker 1>was it a publicity event?</v>

3654
01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:29.261
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3655
01:44:29.261 --> 01:44:32.110
<v Speaker 1>cause that why they were doing it and making it such a big deal and everybody's</v>

3656
01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:33.410
<v Speaker 1>walking towards the border.</v>

3657
01:44:33.411 --> 01:44:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a bit more than that.</v>

3658
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:36.710
<v Speaker 1>I think there w uh,</v>

3659
01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:37.251
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

3660
01:44:37.251 --> 01:44:38.084
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3661
01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:38.750
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

3662
01:44:38.750 --> 01:44:39.441
<v Speaker 1>this caravan,</v>

3663
01:44:39.441 --> 01:44:43.400
<v Speaker 1>it started a few years ago and they started off in Mexico for security.</v>

3664
01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3665
01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:49.430
<v Speaker 1>there was an issue back a few years ago where the cartels would kidnap migrants</v>

3666
01:44:49.431 --> 01:44:50.264
<v Speaker 1>en masse.</v>

3667
01:44:50.810 --> 01:44:53.900
<v Speaker 1>They will just get loads of migrants and you think these people are poor,</v>

3668
01:44:53.901 --> 01:44:55.190
<v Speaker 1>how can they make money from them?</v>

3669
01:44:55.670 --> 01:44:56.391
<v Speaker 1>But they'd get them,</v>

3670
01:44:56.391 --> 01:44:59.030
<v Speaker 1>put them in camps and they know they have family in the United States.</v>

3671
01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:00.231
<v Speaker 1>So they say,</v>

3672
01:45:00.231 --> 01:45:00.531
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3673
01:45:00.531 --> 01:45:01.940
<v Speaker 1>we've got 50 people in the camp.</v>

3674
01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:06.590
<v Speaker 1>We want $5,000 off each one of you off your family.</v>

3675
01:45:06.591 --> 01:45:07.251
<v Speaker 1>Like give us number,</v>

3676
01:45:07.251 --> 01:45:08.180
<v Speaker 1>we're going to call your family.</v>

3677
01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:08.931
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3678
01:45:08.931 --> 01:45:09.561
<v Speaker 1>send us the money.</v>

3679
01:45:09.561 --> 01:45:11.080
<v Speaker 1>That and then sometimes they'd agree on,</v>

3680
01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:11.241
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3681
01:45:11.241 --> 01:45:12.800
<v Speaker 1>2000 you know like,</v>

3682
01:45:12.801 --> 01:45:15.260
<v Speaker 1>but so sounds like you know you're making money out of poor people,</v>

3683
01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:16.880
<v Speaker 1>but you do it on mass.</v>

3684
01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:20.390
<v Speaker 1>You do it 10,000 people and you get a couple of thousand dollars each.</v>

3685
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:23.150
<v Speaker 1>That's like $20,000 200 to 200 minutes.</v>

3686
01:45:23.151 --> 01:45:24.050
<v Speaker 1>I told her $1 million,</v>

3687
01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:28.940
<v Speaker 1>so they started doing caravans for strength to avoid these mass kidnappings.</v>

3688
01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:32.210
<v Speaker 1>What was different about the latest caravan?</v>

3689
01:45:32.250 --> 01:45:33.200
<v Speaker 1>The actually became,</v>

3690
01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:34.880
<v Speaker 1>became a caravan crossing borders.</v>

3691
01:45:34.881 --> 01:45:37.550
<v Speaker 1>It used to be going through parts of Mexico together.</v>

3692
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:39.890
<v Speaker 1>Then they started crossing borders.</v>

3693
01:45:39.891 --> 01:45:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Now the caravan began in October,</v>

3694
01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:48.400
<v Speaker 1>around October 12th and there was a call for them to meet and my friend all lean</v>

3695
01:45:49.701 --> 01:45:51.590
<v Speaker 1>again though the journey's done in Honduras.</v>

3696
01:45:51.591 --> 01:45:56.390
<v Speaker 1>He was down there filming with his TV crew putting on TV or they're down here,</v>

3697
01:45:56.391 --> 01:45:57.680
<v Speaker 1>they're going on this caravan.</v>

3698
01:45:57.681 --> 01:45:59.360
<v Speaker 1>It's only when boom and like Lowe's,</v>

3699
01:45:59.361 --> 01:46:01.400
<v Speaker 1>people saw it on TV and they're like,</v>

3700
01:46:01.401 --> 01:46:02.234
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>

3701
01:46:02.270 --> 01:46:02.691
<v Speaker 1>I'm leaving,</v>

3702
01:46:02.691 --> 01:46:03.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm leaving now.</v>

3703
01:46:03.741 --> 01:46:06.230
<v Speaker 1>The desperation was so heavy in a,</v>

3704
01:46:06.231 --> 01:46:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Honduras isn't a real meltdown kind of stage.</v>

3705
01:46:08.811 --> 01:46:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Honduras is bad Venezuela's worse,</v>

3706
01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:13.460
<v Speaker 1>but Honduras might be like number two,</v>

3707
01:46:13.461 --> 01:46:13.760
<v Speaker 1>far,</v>

3708
01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:14.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3709
01:46:14.150 --> 01:46:16.490
<v Speaker 1>real meltdown cases in Latin America right now.</v>

3710
01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:18.490
<v Speaker 1>So people were like,</v>

3711
01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:18.820
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3712
01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:19.670
<v Speaker 1>talk to some of these people.</v>

3713
01:46:19.671 --> 01:46:21.110
<v Speaker 1>They would say that I saw on TV and I was,</v>

3714
01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:21.621
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

3715
01:46:21.621 --> 01:46:23.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to decided right away,</v>

3716
01:46:23.931 --> 01:46:24.561
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get my bag,</v>

3717
01:46:24.561 --> 01:46:25.394
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go.</v>

3718
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:27.020
<v Speaker 1>So they arrived at the,</v>

3719
01:46:27.050 --> 01:46:29.700
<v Speaker 1>when they went through and got a mile into quite a miler in,</v>

3720
01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:31.760
<v Speaker 1>they became big like 7,000 people,</v>

3721
01:46:32.230 --> 01:46:32.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3722
01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:33.770
<v Speaker 1>arrive at the,</v>

3723
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:38.830
<v Speaker 1>at the border with Mexico and you know,</v>

3724
01:46:39.230 --> 01:46:40.370
<v Speaker 1>first of all they try to,</v>

3725
01:46:40.371 --> 01:46:40.521
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3726
01:46:40.521 --> 01:46:41.030
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3727
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.391
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

3728
01:46:41.391 --> 01:46:45.530
<v Speaker 1>a push and shove on the board and tear gas was fired and they went down and</v>

3729
01:46:45.531 --> 01:46:49.740
<v Speaker 1>cross the river in some of them walking across with a rope.</v>

3730
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Some of them go across on tires.</v>

3731
01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:54.460
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of crazy scene in the scene.</v>

3732
01:46:54.461 --> 01:46:56.970
<v Speaker 1>Now there was squatted half the bridge and the now kindness.</v>

3733
01:46:56.971 --> 01:46:58.380
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of kind of a big deal.</v>

3734
01:46:59.010 --> 01:47:02.030
<v Speaker 1>I know the idea of calling them an invading army and so forth was,</v>

3735
01:47:02.050 --> 01:47:02.320
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

3736
01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:03.530
<v Speaker 1>was obviously overblown,</v>

3737
01:47:03.570 --> 01:47:06.630
<v Speaker 1>but like I think it was significant scenes,</v>

3738
01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:08.550
<v Speaker 1>quite storic scenes that were happening down there.</v>

3739
01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:13.350
<v Speaker 1>And what was the overall goal to make it through to the United States?</v>

3740
01:47:13.410 --> 01:47:13.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3741
01:47:13.861 --> 01:47:15.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a different people at different ideas.</v>

3742
01:47:15.961 --> 01:47:17.220
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of on his weird things,</v>

3743
01:47:17.221 --> 01:47:17.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3744
01:47:17.431 --> 01:47:18.720
<v Speaker 1>like it was girly nights,</v>

3745
01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:18.721
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

3746
01:47:18.721 --> 01:47:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Now some people had no idea where they will go and had no real plan.</v>

3747
01:47:22.691 --> 01:47:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Some people [inaudible] had very clear,</v>

3748
01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:25.831
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3749
01:47:25.831 --> 01:47:27.630
<v Speaker 1>cases of being like I'm a refugee.</v>

3750
01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3751
01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:33.080
<v Speaker 1>in our understanding a bit about refugee legislation and not fleeing very</v>

3752
01:47:34.110 --> 01:47:37.950
<v Speaker 1>specific cases where they've been targeted by gangs,</v>

3753
01:47:37.951 --> 01:47:39.900
<v Speaker 1>working with corrupt police who want to kill them,</v>

3754
01:47:39.901 --> 01:47:44.280
<v Speaker 1>who have like hacked them and they've run and like I want to seek refuge in the</v>

3755
01:47:44.281 --> 01:47:45.810
<v Speaker 1>United States or in Mexico,</v>

3756
01:47:45.930 --> 01:47:47.220
<v Speaker 1>someone them seeking refuge in Mexico,</v>

3757
01:47:48.630 --> 01:47:50.730
<v Speaker 1>which is not the safest place to see each.</v>

3758
01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:51.280
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

3759
01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:55.620
<v Speaker 1>there's been cases of people who have one camera man or know who fed Honduras</v>

3760
01:47:55.890 --> 01:47:57.030
<v Speaker 1>and then was killed in Mexico.</v>

3761
01:47:57.390 --> 01:48:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Has there ever been any discussion of the United States military intervening and</v>

3762
01:48:02.131 --> 01:48:04.230
<v Speaker 1>trying to do something about the cartels?</v>

3763
01:48:05.250 --> 01:48:07.170
<v Speaker 1>So there's been like a us,</v>

3764
01:48:07.290 --> 01:48:08.123
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3765
01:48:09.090 --> 01:48:09.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3766
01:48:09.540 --> 01:48:12.270
<v Speaker 1>some US forces like us marshals,</v>

3767
01:48:12.770 --> 01:48:13.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3768
01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:15.510
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they're like,</v>

3769
01:48:15.810 --> 01:48:16.550
<v Speaker 1>you didn't,</v>

3770
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Mexico's very proud of its constitution and very proud of its sovereignty and</v>

3771
01:48:20.401 --> 01:48:22.350
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want us force acting in Mexico.</v>

3772
01:48:22.351 --> 01:48:22.880
<v Speaker 1>And I think the,</v>

3773
01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:23.080
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3774
01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:24.360
<v Speaker 1>the kind of idea really of,</v>

3775
01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:27.420
<v Speaker 1>of US military military's pretty out there.</v>

3776
01:48:27.610 --> 01:48:28.261
<v Speaker 1>How is pretty,</v>

3777
01:48:28.261 --> 01:48:28.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3778
01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:28.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3779
01:48:28.651 --> 01:48:33.600
<v Speaker 1>like it wouldn't help if he's be bogged down into more problems and,</v>

3780
01:48:33.630 --> 01:48:35.340
<v Speaker 1>and there'd be nap time in Mexico Ford App,</v>

3781
01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:40.880
<v Speaker 1>but there have been some cases of us doing some kind of activity in Mexico.</v>

3782
01:48:42.241 --> 01:48:43.260
<v Speaker 1>Like for example,</v>

3783
01:48:43.740 --> 01:48:45.900
<v Speaker 1>when they went off to chapel was man,</v>

3784
01:48:46.710 --> 01:48:48.840
<v Speaker 1>when they got him and there's a big shootout.</v>

3785
01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:49.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3786
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:54.180
<v Speaker 1>they've gotten the first time I said without shots fired and,</v>

3787
01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:55.231
<v Speaker 1>and then he went to prison.</v>

3788
01:48:55.231 --> 01:48:57.160
<v Speaker 1>He escaped that one escape from her.</v>

3789
01:48:57.161 --> 01:48:58.230
<v Speaker 1>He says keep more than once.</v>

3790
01:48:58.231 --> 01:48:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3791
01:48:58.400 --> 01:48:59.191
<v Speaker 1>And escaped twice.</v>

3792
01:48:59.191 --> 01:48:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3793
01:48:59.430 --> 01:49:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Did he get helicoptered out once?</v>

3794
01:49:01.350 --> 01:49:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

3795
01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:04.450
<v Speaker 1>I'd to have been a happy and how he called down,</v>

3796
01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:05.460
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy.</v>

3797
01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:08.970
<v Speaker 1>He had the one tunnel escape with the electric bike,</v>

3798
01:49:09.450 --> 01:49:10.410
<v Speaker 1>which was crazy.</v>

3799
01:49:10.590 --> 01:49:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3800
01:49:11.290 --> 01:49:11.440
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

3801
01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:13.690
<v Speaker 1>when he went to the John and went to the bathroom,</v>

3802
01:49:13.691 --> 01:49:16.080
<v Speaker 1>we just step behind the door and he's gone.</v>

3803
01:49:16.190 --> 01:49:17.550
<v Speaker 1>That was insane.</v>

3804
01:49:17.670 --> 01:49:20.580
<v Speaker 1>It was really weird when I went to New York right now,</v>

3805
01:49:20.581 --> 01:49:22.320
<v Speaker 1>seeing him in the court in New York,</v>

3806
01:49:22.590 --> 01:49:25.980
<v Speaker 1>like seeing him in the flesh after all these years covering this stuff.</v>

3807
01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:28.560
<v Speaker 1>And I saw him and it was like,</v>

3808
01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3810

3855
01:50:50.771 --> 01:50:53.170

3856
01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:55.511
<v Speaker 1>And there's a church,</v>

3857

3879
01:51:24.020 --> 01:51:24.853
<v Speaker 1>in the village.</v>

3880
01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:27.130
<v Speaker 1>And he said to the chair,</v>

3881
01:51:27.131 --> 01:51:27.380
<v Speaker 1>to them,</v>

3882

3884
01:51:31.931 --> 01:51:32.141

3885
01:51:32.141 --> 01:51:33.430
<v Speaker 1>in this church ceremony.</v>

3886
01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:34.641
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

3887

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3888
01:51:34.930 --> 01:51:35.411
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

3889
01:51:35.411 --> 01:51:37.090
<v Speaker 1>really bizarre scenes up there.</v>

3890
01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:38.880
<v Speaker 1>And there was so bizarre to,</v>

3891
01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:42.910
<v Speaker 1>but did you talk to them about the contradiction of being an evangelical</v>

3892
01:51:42.911 --> 01:51:43.744
<v Speaker 1>Christian,</v>

3893
01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:48.430
<v Speaker 1>being involved in essentially a mass murder and drug running operation?</v>

3894
01:51:48.431 --> 01:51:48.691
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3895
01:51:48.691 --> 01:51:50.760
<v Speaker 1>so the cousin is supposedly,</v>

3896
01:51:50.761 --> 01:51:53.380
<v Speaker 1>and he was like a cattle ranch and now I don't exactly,</v>

3897
01:51:53.381 --> 01:51:53.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3898
01:51:53.711 --> 01:51:54.544
<v Speaker 1>obviously he's,</v>

3899
01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:55.270
<v Speaker 1>he calls,</v>

3900
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:56.103

<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3903
01:51:58.760 --> 01:51:59.030
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3904
01:51:59.030 --> 01:52:01.240
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know how much he might have been involved in the past,</v>

3905
01:52:01.241 --> 01:52:01.571
<v Speaker 1>but his,</v>

3906
01:52:01.571 --> 01:52:01.930
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

3907
01:52:01.930 --> 01:52:02.231
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

3908
01:52:02.231 --> 01:52:02.920
<v Speaker 1>he says he's,</v>

3909
01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:03.230
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3910
01:52:03.230 --> 01:52:03.650
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3911
01:52:03.650 --> 01:52:05.980
<v Speaker 1>he's a farmer there and the mother,</v>

3912
01:52:06.350 --> 01:52:06.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3913
01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Chapos mother who's 88 or was 88,</v>

3914
01:52:09.191 --> 01:52:09.550
<v Speaker 1>they're now,</v>

3915
01:52:09.550 --> 01:52:12.040
<v Speaker 1>it's like 89 90 now.</v>

3916
01:52:12.970 --> 01:52:13.803
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3917
01:52:14.530 --> 01:52:14.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3918
01:52:14.741 --> 01:52:17.260
<v Speaker 1>she talks about her son with kind of pride it,</v>

3919
01:52:17.261 --> 01:52:21.250
<v Speaker 1>I did it and I didn't push too hard and there was a gunman around and stuff.</v>

3920
01:52:21.330 --> 01:52:22.840
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like [inaudible].</v>

3921
01:52:23.710 --> 01:52:24.543
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3922
01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:25.841
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3923
01:52:25.841 --> 01:52:26.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3924
01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:26.560
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

3925
01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:27.041
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

3926
01:52:27.041 --> 01:52:27.480
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

3927
01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:28.450
<v Speaker 1>this is their way of life.</v>

3928
01:52:28.451 --> 01:52:28.721
<v Speaker 1>I mean these,</v>

3929
01:52:28.721 --> 01:52:29.320
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>

3930
01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:30.880
<v Speaker 1>so seeing him in the court,</v>

3931
01:52:31.250 --> 01:52:31.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3932
01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:33.100
<v Speaker 1>was kind of bizarre seeing,</v>

3933
01:52:33.101 --> 01:52:33.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3934
01:52:33.281 --> 01:52:34.091
<v Speaker 1>seeing him right there.</v>

3935
01:52:34.091 --> 01:52:34.924
<v Speaker 1>And in New York,</v>

3936
01:52:34.940 --> 01:52:35.773
<v Speaker 1>in Brooklyn,</v>

3937
01:52:36.490 --> 01:52:36.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3938
01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:38.680
<v Speaker 1>right there in Brooklyn and they bought it.</v>

3939
01:52:38.681 --> 01:52:42.400
<v Speaker 1>All of these crazy characters is p as a cooperating witnesses.</v>

3940
01:52:42.401 --> 01:52:44.320
<v Speaker 1>They brought in 14 cooperating witnesses.</v>

3941
01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:46.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm on a bunch of other gangs.</v>

3942
01:52:46.491 --> 01:52:47.900
<v Speaker 1>How does they protect those people?</v>

3943
01:52:48.590 --> 01:52:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3944
01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:49.821
<v Speaker 1>I mean heavily,</v>

3945
01:52:49.821 --> 01:52:50.810
<v Speaker 1>heavily protected.</v>

3946
01:52:50.980 --> 01:52:51.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3947
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:51.700
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3948
01:52:51.700 --> 01:52:52.533
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3949
01:52:53.090 --> 01:52:57.410
<v Speaker 1>I think it was ethically very questionable why they bought a lot of those people</v>

3950
01:52:57.411 --> 01:52:57.740
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

3951
01:52:57.740 --> 01:52:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3952
01:52:58.160 --> 01:52:58.993
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

3953
01:52:59.210 --> 01:53:04.210
<v Speaker 1>they brought in one guy whose nickname is Jupiter Petta who confessed himself as</v>

3954
01:53:05.541 --> 01:53:08.960
<v Speaker 1>many as 150 killings and maybe did a lot more,</v>

3955
01:53:09.410 --> 01:53:09.741
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3956
01:53:09.741 --> 01:53:10.101
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3957
01:53:10.101 --> 01:53:11.930
<v Speaker 1>and he makes a deal,</v>

3958
01:53:12.740 --> 01:53:16.880
<v Speaker 1>likely makes a deal to cooperate against their chapters.</v>

3959
01:53:16.890 --> 01:53:19.730
<v Speaker 1>So you get into a kind of weird intrigued there,</v>

3960
01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:20.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3961
01:53:20.350 --> 01:53:22.160
<v Speaker 1>about what the government was doing.</v>

3962
01:53:22.190 --> 01:53:23.760
<v Speaker 1>This whole case is,</v>

3963
01:53:23.761 --> 01:53:27.170
<v Speaker 1>there's a history in this country with the prosecuting the mob,</v>

3964
01:53:27.740 --> 01:53:28.580
<v Speaker 1>John Guardian,</v>

3965
01:53:28.590 --> 01:53:33.380
<v Speaker 1>Sammy the bull Gravano who so admitted murderer and talked about the murders</v>

3966
01:53:33.770 --> 01:53:37.620
<v Speaker 1>that he committed and still they allowed him to get free day one.</v>

3967
01:53:37.730 --> 01:53:42.050
<v Speaker 1>His want to hit John got his lawyer was one of the lawyers for our chapel.</v>

3968
01:53:42.290 --> 01:53:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

3969
01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:43.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3970
01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:46.020
<v Speaker 1>And then they head out to the,</v>

3971
01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:48.050
<v Speaker 1>that they got something to do with these lawyers there.</v>

3972
01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:50.030
<v Speaker 1>It was a crazy kind of show.</v>

3973
01:53:50.350 --> 01:53:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3974
01:53:50.570 --> 01:53:51.081
<v Speaker 1>It was weird.</v>

3975
01:53:51.081 --> 01:53:53.420
<v Speaker 1>It was like in a New York and this show they were putting on there.</v>

3976
01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:54.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3977
01:53:54.620 --> 01:53:55.030
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3978
01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:58.850
<v Speaker 1>I felt kind of disconnect with the things I've been seeing over the last few</v>

3979
01:53:58.850 --> 01:53:58.851
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

3980
01:53:58.851 --> 01:53:59.930
<v Speaker 1>And it didn't really,</v>

3981
01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:01.070
<v Speaker 1>why was it in New York?</v>

3982
01:54:02.030 --> 01:54:06.170
<v Speaker 1>The United they indicted him and a bunch of places and I think they chose New</v>

3983
01:54:06.170 --> 01:54:08.120
<v Speaker 1>York for the reason they wanted more of a show.</v>

3984
01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3985
01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:09.320
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3986
01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:09.761
<v Speaker 1>I think they,</v>

3987
01:54:09.761 --> 01:54:09.970
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

3988
01:54:09.970 --> 01:54:10.150
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3989
01:54:10.150 --> 01:54:12.260
<v Speaker 1>they bought in a more than 50 witnesses,</v>

3990
01:54:13.050 --> 01:54:13.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3991
01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:13.761
<v Speaker 1>three and a half,</v>

3992
01:54:13.761 --> 01:54:15.110
<v Speaker 1>three months of Crile.</v>

3993
01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:15.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3994
01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:16.580
<v Speaker 1>what was his defense?</v>

3995
01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:21.650
<v Speaker 1>So they originally tried a bit of a defense of,</v>

3996
01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:26.680
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to go back to fence of how there's a kind of government conspiracy,</v>

3997
01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:27.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3998
01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:32.500
<v Speaker 1>of like showing things like fast and furious that you mentioned like saying,</v>

3999
01:54:33.261 --> 01:54:33.411
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4000
01:54:33.411 --> 01:54:35.660
<v Speaker 1>how come the government's trafficking guns,</v>

4001
01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:40.490
<v Speaker 1>two cartels and one of the witnesses had before one of the witnesses against</v>

4002
01:54:40.491 --> 01:54:40.591
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

4003
01:54:40.591 --> 01:54:44.450
<v Speaker 1>it before use this weird defense called public authority saying he had</v>

4004
01:54:44.451 --> 01:54:48.200
<v Speaker 1>permission from the United States government to traffic drugs are basically</v>

4005
01:54:48.201 --> 01:54:50.690
<v Speaker 1>saying there's a kind of conspiracy involving in Mexican government's tardy,</v>

4006
01:54:50.691 --> 01:54:52.850
<v Speaker 1>corrupt and working with cartels.</v>

4007
01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:57.170
<v Speaker 1>The U s government is corrupt and working cartels and having very specific</v>

4008
01:54:57.171 --> 01:55:02.120
<v Speaker 1>agencies and El Chapo was kind of a full guy that they're putting this blame on</v>

4009
01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:03.170
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

4010
01:55:03.170 --> 01:55:04.880
<v Speaker 1>That didn't really the gut,</v>

4011
01:55:04.881 --> 01:55:07.130
<v Speaker 1>the u s prosecutors shut that down.</v>

4012
01:55:07.131 --> 01:55:07.581
<v Speaker 1>And the judge,</v>

4013
01:55:07.581 --> 01:55:08.414
<v Speaker 1>they just said,</v>

4014
01:55:08.450 --> 01:55:09.770
<v Speaker 1>you can't talk about this stuff.</v>

4015
01:55:09.950 --> 01:55:10.790
<v Speaker 1>You can't say that.</v>

4016
01:55:11.150 --> 01:55:12.650
<v Speaker 1>So I went fast and furious,</v>

4017
01:55:12.651 --> 01:55:13.484
<v Speaker 1>came up,</v>

4018
01:55:13.970 --> 01:55:14.361
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

4019
01:55:14.361 --> 01:55:14.960
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4020
01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:15.800
<v Speaker 1>you can't talk about it.</v>

4021
01:55:15.801 --> 01:55:16.401
<v Speaker 1>You can't talk.</v>

4022
01:55:16.401 --> 01:55:16.801
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

4023
01:55:16.801 --> 01:55:17.960
<v Speaker 1>who couldn't talk about it in a court?</v>

4024
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Well that's ethically ambiguous,</v>

4025
01:55:19.701 --> 01:55:19.851
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4026
01:55:19.851 --> 01:55:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4027
01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:20.871
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

4028
01:55:20.871 --> 01:55:22.220
<v Speaker 1>That's a real thing that happened.</v>

4029
01:55:22.221 --> 01:55:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4030
01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:23.220
<v Speaker 1>So there was,</v>

4031
01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:23.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4032
01:55:23.601 --> 01:55:25.040
<v Speaker 1>we can't talk about it as you add to that.</v>

4033
01:55:25.190 --> 01:55:27.620
<v Speaker 1>And then the defense tried a bit,</v>

4034
01:55:27.621 --> 01:55:29.660
<v Speaker 1>well they had audios of El Chapo and they said,</v>

4035
01:55:29.661 --> 01:55:29.811
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4036
01:55:29.811 --> 01:55:30.920
<v Speaker 1>do you know how you noticed him?</v>

4037
01:55:31.550 --> 01:55:34.580
<v Speaker 1>And is he really the main guy in the law cartel now?</v>

4038
01:55:34.581 --> 01:55:36.950
<v Speaker 1>There is as well.</v>

4039
01:55:36.970 --> 01:55:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4040
01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:39.070
<v Speaker 1>very possibly he's not the top guy in,</v>

4041
01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:39.620
<v Speaker 1>in Arcata.</v>

4042
01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 1>They might well be another guy called miles and bother who's the number one?</v>

4043
01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:46.920
<v Speaker 1>And he might be more of an emblematic figure,</v>

4044
01:55:47.310 --> 01:55:52.310
<v Speaker 1>but for some reason El Chapo became the most famous in the world.</v>

4045
01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:53.560
<v Speaker 1>And so this other guy's,</v>

4046
01:55:53.580 --> 01:55:54.240
<v Speaker 1>he's still free.</v>

4047
01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:54.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4048
01:55:54.351 --> 01:55:54.920
<v Speaker 1>he's still free.</v>

4049
01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:55.680
<v Speaker 1>What is his name again?</v>

4050
01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:56.281
<v Speaker 1>Myo.</v>

4051
01:55:56.281 --> 01:55:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Zambada.</v>

4052
01:55:57.030 --> 01:55:57.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4053
01:55:57.450 --> 01:55:58.000
<v Speaker 1>and where's he?</v>

4054
01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:58.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4055
01:55:58.690 --> 01:56:00.100
<v Speaker 1>I knew somewhere in mountains.</v>

4056
01:56:00.170 --> 01:56:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Mezcal throws in the mountains often many.</v>

4057
01:56:02.830 --> 01:56:03.211
<v Speaker 1>What are these,</v>

4058
01:56:03.211 --> 01:56:04.260
<v Speaker 1>these weird things you'd think?</v>

4059
01:56:04.261 --> 01:56:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're a drug lord and you've got all of the money,</v>

4060
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:08.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4061
01:56:08.251 --> 01:56:10.380
<v Speaker 1>you've got millions,</v>

4062
01:56:10.380 --> 01:56:10.381
<v Speaker 1>billions,</v>

4063
01:56:10.381 --> 01:56:10.711
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

4064
01:56:10.711 --> 01:56:11.880
<v Speaker 1>let's say hundreds and millions.</v>

4065
01:56:11.881 --> 01:56:16.170
<v Speaker 1>I think they exaggerate how much money some of these guys have individually.</v>

4066
01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:18.220
<v Speaker 1>But then you could go anywhere in the world.</v>

4067
01:56:18.221 --> 01:56:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you could go somewhere out?</v>

4068
01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:22.480
<v Speaker 1>But these guys tend to be in their places that they,</v>

4069
01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:23.353
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

4070
01:56:23.670 --> 01:56:23.911
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

4071
01:56:23.911 --> 01:56:24.511
<v Speaker 1>they're people.</v>

4072
01:56:24.511 --> 01:56:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Like some of these people are people who are very educated.</v>

4073
01:56:27.090 --> 01:56:28.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean a chopper who's,</v>

4074
01:56:28.530 --> 01:56:29.071
<v Speaker 1>as a kid,</v>

4075
01:56:29.071 --> 01:56:34.071
<v Speaker 1>he was carrying sacks full of oranges to sell almost an education and they start</v>

4076
01:56:35.431 --> 01:56:40.431
<v Speaker 1>handling hundreds of billions of dollars that do dealing with a billion dollar</v>

4077
01:56:40.501 --> 01:56:44.460
<v Speaker 1>international business and they've got the capacity to understand and deal with</v>

4078
01:56:44.461 --> 01:56:45.240
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

4079
01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:46.140
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>

4080
01:56:46.141 --> 01:56:49.110
<v Speaker 1>they still really hyper local in some ways.</v>

4081
01:56:49.111 --> 01:56:50.430
<v Speaker 1>They're still like people who,</v>

4082
01:56:50.730 --> 01:56:52.110
<v Speaker 1>they understand their world,</v>

4083
01:56:52.111 --> 01:56:54.960
<v Speaker 1>they understand it from their environment to control them,</v>

4084
01:56:54.961 --> 01:56:56.580
<v Speaker 1>become masters of their environment,</v>

4085
01:56:57.220 --> 01:56:57.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4086
01:56:57.690 --> 01:57:00.390
<v Speaker 1>to become kind of powerful in,</v>

4087
01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:01.440
<v Speaker 1>in that place,</v>

4088
01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:03.420
<v Speaker 1>who in that place.</v>

4089
01:57:03.421 --> 01:57:04.090
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

4090
01:57:04.090 --> 01:57:04.561
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't,</v>

4091
01:57:04.561 --> 01:57:04.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4092
01:57:04.801 --> 01:57:08.130
<v Speaker 1>the idea of them go into like sitting in Italy in a cafe and kind of running it</v>

4093
01:57:08.131 --> 01:57:08.940
<v Speaker 1>from there and they don't,</v>

4094
01:57:08.940 --> 01:57:11.910
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of beyond that would have to be there near the business because</v>

4095
01:57:11.911 --> 01:57:13.350
<v Speaker 1>otherwise someone would just take it over,</v>

4096
01:57:13.351 --> 01:57:13.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4097
01:57:13.710 --> 01:57:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4098
01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:14.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4099
01:57:14.310 --> 01:57:14.491
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4100
01:57:14.491 --> 01:57:14.671
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4101
01:57:14.671 --> 01:57:18.000
<v Speaker 1>So that's how many have to run that thing with an iron first.</v>

4102
01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:18.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4103
01:57:18.751 --> 01:57:18.961
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4104
01:57:18.961 --> 01:57:19.210
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

4105
01:57:19.210 --> 01:57:19.941
<v Speaker 1>you could think though,</v>

4106
01:57:19.941 --> 01:57:20.880
<v Speaker 1>or maybe like,</v>

4107
01:57:21.270 --> 01:57:21.691
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4108
01:57:21.691 --> 01:57:22.420
<v Speaker 1>I guess so.</v>

4109
01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:23.880
<v Speaker 1>He really get your Christian cousin,</v>

4110
01:57:23.881 --> 01:57:24.720
<v Speaker 1>you won't rip you off.</v>

4111
01:57:24.810 --> 01:57:25.643
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4112
01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:27.391
<v Speaker 1>But how am I also,</v>

4113
01:57:27.391 --> 01:57:28.860
<v Speaker 1>how much money do you need to make?</v>

4114
01:57:29.050 --> 01:57:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4115
01:57:29.670 --> 01:57:30.510
<v Speaker 1>Taking you get out.</v>

4116
01:57:30.570 --> 01:57:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Maybe when it,</v>

4117
01:57:31.651 --> 01:57:32.730
<v Speaker 1>again with corruption,</v>

4118
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:35.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's the issue of like a lot of police in Mexico poor,</v>

4119
01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:37.830
<v Speaker 1>so that's why they take deals.</v>

4120
01:57:37.831 --> 01:57:38.220
<v Speaker 1>But there's uh,</v>

4121
01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:39.480
<v Speaker 1>an ex governor called Thomas,</v>

4122
01:57:39.481 --> 01:57:44.400
<v Speaker 1>he Addington who I met a few years ago when he was governor of Tamaulipas state</v>

4123
01:57:45.210 --> 01:57:46.050
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

4124
01:57:46.051 --> 01:57:46.440
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

4125
01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:50.070
<v Speaker 1>he was not only taking money from drug traffickers after he left being governor,</v>

4126
01:57:50.071 --> 01:57:53.340
<v Speaker 1>he got into drug trafficking himself and he's like,</v>

4127
01:57:53.370 --> 01:57:53.701
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

4128
01:57:53.701 --> 01:57:56.070
<v Speaker 1>well once you made couple of million,</v>

4129
01:57:56.380 --> 01:57:57.110
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

4130
01:57:57.110 --> 01:57:59.040
<v Speaker 1>do you need to make an art 10 million?</v>

4131
01:57:59.041 --> 01:57:59.421
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>

4132
01:57:59.421 --> 01:57:59.571
<v Speaker 1>governor,</v>

4133
01:57:59.571 --> 01:58:00.404
<v Speaker 1>the same with,</v>

4134
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:02.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the business we've been,</v>

4135
01:58:02.341 --> 01:58:03.200
<v Speaker 1>this is what does it,</v>

4136
01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:03.931
<v Speaker 1>what's the incentive?</v>

4137
01:58:03.931 --> 01:58:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Why did they think they always want to make more money?</v>

4138
01:58:05.980 --> 01:58:06.371
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4139
01:58:06.371 --> 01:58:09.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean we were talking about that recently with Jeff Bezos when we found out he</v>

4140
01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:11.200
<v Speaker 2>has $150 billion.</v>

4141
01:58:11.201 --> 01:58:13.270
<v Speaker 2>Like when do you just say we're good,</v>

4142
01:58:13.630 --> 01:58:14.201
<v Speaker 2>we're good.</v>

4143
01:58:14.201 --> 01:58:14.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4144
01:58:14.770 --> 01:58:15.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4145
01:58:15.130 --> 01:58:16.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4146
01:58:16.091 --> 01:58:17.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it becomes,</v>

4147
01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:20.590
<v Speaker 2>it's a game more than it is anything else.</v>

4148
01:58:20.591 --> 01:58:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Like there might as well be playing Parcheesi or monopoly or what they're trying</v>

4149
01:58:24.251 --> 01:58:24.880
<v Speaker 2>to win.</v>

4150
01:58:24.880 --> 01:58:25.121
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4151
01:58:25.121 --> 01:58:27.130
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to constantly win.</v>

4152
01:58:27.131 --> 01:58:31.180
<v Speaker 2>And also you have an obligation because you're a CEO of this company,</v>

4153
01:58:31.181 --> 01:58:32.710
<v Speaker 2>so you,</v>

4154
01:58:32.740 --> 01:58:36.940
<v Speaker 2>you're running this enormous business that's earning money for all these other</v>

4155
01:58:36.941 --> 01:58:37.810
<v Speaker 2>people as well.</v>

4156
01:58:37.930 --> 01:58:39.430
<v Speaker 2>It's all very complicated though.</v>

4157
01:58:39.431 --> 01:58:41.920
<v Speaker 2>That has to do with a lot of psychological where</v>

4158
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:45.520
<v Speaker 1>people can't put things into perspective and they get caught up in the race.</v>

4159
01:58:45.780 --> 01:58:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

4160
01:58:46.380 --> 01:58:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4161
01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:46.781
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

4162
01:58:46.781 --> 01:58:46.931
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4163
01:58:46.931 --> 01:58:49.800
<v Speaker 1>maybe drug traffickers are thinking that same thing somebody does when they're</v>

4164
01:58:49.801 --> 01:58:50.634
<v Speaker 1>making.</v>

4165
01:58:50.670 --> 01:58:51.870
<v Speaker 1>And then also that like,</v>

4166
01:58:52.010 --> 01:58:52.770
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4167
01:58:52.770 --> 01:58:53.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4168
01:58:53.500 --> 01:58:55.510
<v Speaker 1>people have explained to me involved in this world,</v>

4169
01:58:56.140 --> 01:58:57.100
<v Speaker 1>they make a lot of money,</v>

4170
01:58:57.101 --> 01:58:58.150
<v Speaker 1>but they spend a lot of money.</v>

4171
01:58:58.670 --> 01:58:59.980
<v Speaker 1>While these numbers are wrong,</v>

4172
01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:00.800
<v Speaker 1>knock with chopper.</v>

4173
01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:01.633
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

4174
01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:02.021
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4175
01:59:02.021 --> 01:59:03.580
<v Speaker 1>his worth $14 billion.</v>

4176
01:59:03.581 --> 01:59:04.900
<v Speaker 1>That's what the US government said.</v>

4177
01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:07.090
<v Speaker 1>In that case he's worth 14 billion.</v>

4178
01:59:07.810 --> 01:59:09.520
<v Speaker 1>But then he's,</v>

4179
01:59:09.810 --> 01:59:10.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4180
01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:10.931
<v Speaker 1>peerless bay to me,</v>

4181
01:59:10.931 --> 01:59:11.121
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4182
01:59:11.121 --> 01:59:11.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4183
01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:13.930
<v Speaker 1>14 billion is when you take the value of drugs.</v>

4184
01:59:13.931 --> 01:59:14.630
<v Speaker 1>You'll send Hee Hee.</v>

4185
01:59:14.630 --> 01:59:16.520
<v Speaker 1>He trafficked and you're adding the opera singers,</v>

4186
01:59:16.540 --> 01:59:17.530
<v Speaker 1>$14 billion worth,</v>

4187
01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:21.700
<v Speaker 1>but really all the time you're paying back suppliers,</v>

4188
01:59:21.701 --> 01:59:25.350
<v Speaker 1>you're paying people off your own money and you know,</v>

4189
01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:28.020
<v Speaker 1>and you know you're buying hippos and chats,</v>

4190
01:59:29.060 --> 01:59:30.760
<v Speaker 1>cold covered rolls Royces.</v>

4191
01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:31.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4192
01:59:32.350 --> 01:59:33.011
<v Speaker 1>There's some of that.</v>

4193
01:59:33.011 --> 01:59:33.910
<v Speaker 1>I think some of that was,</v>

4194
01:59:33.911 --> 01:59:35.110
<v Speaker 1>might have been exaggerated with him.</v>

4195
01:59:35.111 --> 01:59:37.390
<v Speaker 1>He had a lot of kind of more like middle class houses.</v>

4196
01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

4197
01:59:37.900 --> 01:59:38.800
<v Speaker 1>I went to one of the last,</v>

4198
01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:41.590
<v Speaker 1>the last hideout he was caught and it was more like a middle class.</v>

4199
01:59:41.890 --> 01:59:43.210
<v Speaker 1>It's just a normal house in a house,</v>

4200
01:59:43.211 --> 01:59:44.200
<v Speaker 1>but he'd have a lot of those.</v>

4201
01:59:44.230 --> 01:59:46.060
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck happened with Sean Penn?</v>

4202
01:59:46.270 --> 01:59:46.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4203
01:59:46.630 --> 01:59:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Why was Sean Penn up there talking to him?</v>

4204
01:59:49.090 --> 01:59:51.040
<v Speaker 1>That was so strange.</v>

4205
01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4206
01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:55.930

<v Speaker 1>when he was a got of fight.</v>

4209
02:00:02.591 --> 02:00:03.341
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Alvarez,</v>

4210
02:00:03.341 --> 02:00:04.174
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was.</v>

4211
02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4212

4213
02:00:05.981 --> 02:00:07.480
<v Speaker 1>like why was Sean Penn visiting him?</v>

4214
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4215
02:00:07.790 --> 02:00:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Bizarre moment.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean you have a,</v>

02:00:23.470 --> 02:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>And there was a woman that Sean Penn knew that hooked us all up.</v>

4223
02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:27.453
<v Speaker 1>But I'm just gonna steal the,</v>

4235
02:00:41.170 --> 02:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>So the story started,</v>

4236
02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:44.111
<v Speaker 1>so Kate,</v>

4237
02:00:44.111 --> 02:00:45.400
<v Speaker 1>the Castillo who you see there,</v>

4238
02:00:46.150 --> 02:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>she was an actress in a TV series about drug traffickers,</v>

4239
02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:54.070
<v Speaker 1>which have now become a huge deal in Latin America.</v>

4240
02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:58.610
<v Speaker 1>They called out like telenovelas means like soap operas kind of thing,</v>

4241
02:00:58.611 --> 02:01:02.050
<v Speaker 1>series TV series and the whole badge them made about drug traffickers,</v>

4242
02:01:02.410 --> 02:01:03.243
<v Speaker 1>which are really popular.</v>

4243
02:01:03.910 --> 02:01:06.280
<v Speaker 1>And she was in one called La Reina del Sur,</v>

4244
02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:07.173
<v Speaker 1>the Queen of the south.</v>

4245
02:01:07.970 --> 02:01:12.970
<v Speaker 1>And in that she played this drug trafficker and afterwards in some kind of weird</v>

4246
02:01:16.180 --> 02:01:17.530
<v Speaker 1>moment afterwards,</v>

4247
02:01:17.531 --> 02:01:20.200
<v Speaker 1>I think she was like really into her role and stuff.</v>

4248
02:01:20.980 --> 02:01:22.630
<v Speaker 1>She came out with this message,</v>

4249
02:01:22.631 --> 02:01:23.800
<v Speaker 1>she wrote saying,</v>

4250
02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:26.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a Mexico is in such a disease,</v>

4251
02:01:26.651 --> 02:01:28.960
<v Speaker 1>such tragic situation in Mexico.</v>

4252
02:01:29.590 --> 02:01:30.423
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4253
02:01:30.570 --> 02:01:31.403
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4254
02:01:31.420 --> 02:01:35.700
<v Speaker 1>why don't they come in a drug traffickers common like um,</v>

4255
02:01:36.430 --> 02:01:37.780
<v Speaker 1>traffic with love.</v>

4256
02:01:38.350 --> 02:01:40.700
<v Speaker 1>I trust you more than I do the government.</v>

4257
02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:44.150
<v Speaker 1>And these are kind of sentiments that some people have,</v>

4258
02:01:44.151 --> 02:01:44.511
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

4259
02:01:44.511 --> 02:01:47.150
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of a strange thing kind of bit of an out there thing for,</v>

4260
02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:48.830
<v Speaker 1>for a TV star to say.</v>

4261
02:01:49.850 --> 02:01:51.830
<v Speaker 1>And then Chapo,</v>

4262
02:01:52.430 --> 02:01:57.430
<v Speaker 1>El Chapo apparently became kind of enamel with her seeing her on TV and they</v>

4263
02:01:59.121 --> 02:02:00.650
<v Speaker 1>started this kind of communication.</v>

4264
02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Now Sean Penn then got involved in this and was like Ah,</v>

4265
02:02:09.201 --> 02:02:09.381
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

4266
02:02:09.381 --> 02:02:12.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go there as well and we can talk about the idea,</v>

4267
02:02:12.591 --> 02:02:17.591
<v Speaker 1>but the end of the tens of the meeting was as well talking about making a movie</v>

4268
02:02:17.601 --> 02:02:22.601
<v Speaker 1>or TV series of his story and our chapel giving the rights to Kate.</v>

4269
02:02:22.970 --> 02:02:25.400
<v Speaker 1>The Castillo in Sean Penn was kind of involved in this summer.</v>

4270
02:02:25.401 --> 02:02:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Now Sean Penn is a bit of discussion that now that Sean Penn and Kate del</v>

4271
02:02:29.571 --> 02:02:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Castillo fell out over this.</v>

4272
02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:33.470
<v Speaker 1>They have different versions of what happened there.</v>

4273
02:02:34.220 --> 02:02:34.941
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

4274
02:02:34.941 --> 02:02:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Sean Penn decided to go and write this story for rolling stone about how to</v>

4275
02:02:37.851 --> 02:02:38.540
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

4276
02:02:38.540 --> 02:02:39.373
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4277
02:02:39.410 --> 02:02:44.410
<v Speaker 1>So they went then and his meeting was arranged and they went up to the mountains</v>

4278
02:02:44.660 --> 02:02:48.170
<v Speaker 1>and when that photo was taken and I,</v>

4279
02:02:48.171 --> 02:02:52.160
<v Speaker 1>they eat at that point that he didn't actually give an interview to Sean Penn,</v>

4280
02:02:52.161 --> 02:02:56.240
<v Speaker 1>but they had a dinner and had a meeting up in the mountains and,</v>

4281
02:02:57.160 --> 02:02:58.310
<v Speaker 1>and then left.</v>

4282
02:02:58.370 --> 02:03:00.470
<v Speaker 1>And then there were meant to afterwards,</v>

4283
02:03:00.471 --> 02:03:04.490
<v Speaker 1>there was then a big attempt to hit chapel,</v>

4284
02:03:04.820 --> 02:03:05.653
<v Speaker 1>but he escaped.</v>

4285
02:03:06.290 --> 02:03:11.290
<v Speaker 1>So that's when some people say that the Mexican government had followed them in.</v>

4286
02:03:11.781 --> 02:03:12.800
<v Speaker 1>I use their,</v>

4287
02:03:12.801 --> 02:03:14.570
<v Speaker 1>their trace or try and get to a chapel,</v>

4288
02:03:15.380 --> 02:03:16.490
<v Speaker 1>but he did escape.</v>

4289
02:03:16.490 --> 02:03:19.730
<v Speaker 1>He almost got caught close to there quite soon after as by escaped.</v>

4290
02:03:20.420 --> 02:03:21.500
<v Speaker 1>That's makes sense.</v>

4291
02:03:21.501 --> 02:03:21.861
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4292
02:03:21.861 --> 02:03:24.060
<v Speaker 1>how else would Sean Penn be able to slide through?</v>

4293
02:03:24.061 --> 02:03:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Is a famous actor.</v>

4294
02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:27.020
<v Speaker 1>I bet he doesn't even speak Spanish.</v>

4295
02:03:27.050 --> 02:03:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4296
02:03:27.580 --> 02:03:28.940
<v Speaker 1>That housing daggy does.</v>

4297
02:03:29.230 --> 02:03:29.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4298
02:03:29.570 --> 02:03:30.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if,</v>

4299
02:03:30.900 --> 02:03:31.820
<v Speaker 1>so if he was followed.</v>

4300
02:03:31.821 --> 02:03:33.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that he was,</v>

4301
02:03:33.110 --> 02:03:33.943
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4302
02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:34.701
<v Speaker 1>in any case,</v>

4303
02:03:34.701 --> 02:03:35.960
<v Speaker 1>in any way deliberately.</v>

4304
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.530
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4305
02:03:36.530 --> 02:03:37.370
<v Speaker 1>I leading them there,</v>

4306
02:03:37.371 --> 02:03:38.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's something that I think about all the time.</v>

4307
02:03:38.991 --> 02:03:39.621
<v Speaker 1>I think about,</v>

4308
02:03:39.621 --> 02:03:39.831
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4309
02:03:39.831 --> 02:03:42.050
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to meet criminals,</v>

4310
02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:43.753
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4311
02:03:43.970 --> 02:03:45.170
<v Speaker 1>am I being followed?</v>

4312
02:03:45.970 --> 02:03:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4313
02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:48.080
<v Speaker 1>and am I going to lead,</v>

4314
02:03:48.230 --> 02:03:48.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4315
02:03:48.411 --> 02:03:51.200
<v Speaker 1>what's my connection with Laura force much conviction with criminals.</v>

4316
02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:54.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a very difficult thing that I've been bantering and thinking about for lot</v>

4317
02:03:54.511 --> 02:03:55.344
<v Speaker 1>of years.</v>

4318
02:03:55.490 --> 02:03:56.900
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

4319
02:03:57.130 --> 02:03:58.600
<v Speaker 1>the Chapo escapes,</v>

4320
02:03:58.810 --> 02:03:59.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4321
02:03:59.150 --> 02:04:01.790
<v Speaker 1>and then said he couldn't meet up again for the interview because he was,</v>

4322
02:04:01.820 --> 02:04:03.350
<v Speaker 1>it was too hot for him.</v>

4323
02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>So they made this video interview where he was sent some questions and he</v>

4324
02:04:09.201 --> 02:04:11.930
<v Speaker 1>videoed himself answering the questions,</v>

4325
02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:13.460
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of interesting.</v>

4326
02:04:13.461 --> 02:04:17.060
<v Speaker 1>It was the first kind of statement he made and he said,</v>

4327
02:04:17.061 --> 02:04:18.410
<v Speaker 1>I know various things.</v>

4328
02:04:18.411 --> 02:04:19.880
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing it since I was 15.</v>

4329
02:04:20.210 --> 02:04:21.410
<v Speaker 1>It didn't really give much away.</v>

4330
02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:25.040
<v Speaker 1>And then he was caught and when he was caught they were like,</v>

4331
02:04:25.041 --> 02:04:26.360
<v Speaker 1>we've got to move to stories.</v>

4332
02:04:26.361 --> 02:04:30.500
<v Speaker 1>And then the story came out large bang after he was caught in early 2016 so it</v>

4333
02:04:30.501 --> 02:04:33.140
<v Speaker 1>had to have some sort of an impact and then catching them.</v>

4334
02:04:33.350 --> 02:04:34.183
<v Speaker 1>I must've,</v>

4335
02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:34.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4336
02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:35.970
<v Speaker 1>it's possible.</v>

4337
02:04:35.980 --> 02:04:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4338
02:04:36.450 --> 02:04:37.283
<v Speaker 1>makes sense.</v>

4339
02:04:37.570 --> 02:04:38.790
<v Speaker 1>It's possible.</v>

4340
02:04:38.791 --> 02:04:39.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4341
02:04:39.010 --> 02:04:40.350
<v Speaker 1>chopper thing was pretty,</v>

4342
02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:40.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4343
02:04:40.951 --> 02:04:45.951
<v Speaker 1>he'd already been caught before he was caught in 2014 was imprisoned,</v>

4344
02:04:47.850 --> 02:04:52.850
<v Speaker 1>escaped in 2015 through that tunnel and then was caught again in 2016 so yeah,</v>

4345
02:04:54.931 --> 02:04:57.930
<v Speaker 1>me maybe it had an impact on United on that when they were looking for them.</v>

4346
02:04:57.990 --> 02:04:58.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4347
02:04:58.171 --> 02:04:59.360
<v Speaker 1>They were looking for him and he seemed,</v>

4348
02:04:59.361 --> 02:05:02.130
<v Speaker 1>he seemed to have lost a lot of his protection in a he before.</v>

4349
02:05:02.131 --> 02:05:03.510
<v Speaker 1>And I go back a few years.</v>

4350
02:05:04.230 --> 02:05:06.930
<v Speaker 1>I know he had enormous protection in and there's mountains.</v>

4351
02:05:06.931 --> 02:05:07.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4352
02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:09.810
<v Speaker 1>in a village you see there's a house above,</v>

4353
02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:10.221
<v Speaker 1>like there's a,</v>

4354
02:05:10.221 --> 02:05:13.740
<v Speaker 1>there's kind of a main clearing where his mother's compound is in,</v>

4355
02:05:13.741 --> 02:05:16.710
<v Speaker 1>so pretty basic still that village then are up from there.</v>

4356
02:05:16.711 --> 02:05:18.270
<v Speaker 1>You see a,</v>

4357
02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:19.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4358
02:05:19.860 --> 02:05:21.690
<v Speaker 1>a house on a hill and apparent that as well.</v>

4359
02:05:21.691 --> 02:05:22.590
<v Speaker 1>Chapter for long time.</v>

4360
02:05:22.591 --> 02:05:22.770
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

4361
02:05:22.770 --> 02:05:23.790
<v Speaker 1>don't just stay in that house.</v>

4362
02:05:24.620 --> 02:05:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4363
02:05:25.230 --> 02:05:25.411

02:05:26.431 --> 02:05:27.120
<v Speaker 1>In the past,</v>

4367
02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:28.140
<v Speaker 1>he had so much protection.</v>

4368
02:05:28.141 --> 02:05:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Anytime the military will come close at the mountain,</v>

4369
02:05:30.691 --> 02:05:34.080
<v Speaker 1>you've got hundreds of people in radio saying that if they were coming up,</v>
