<v Speaker 1>but there's no real crowd control.</v>

14
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 1>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all comics work in the booth.</v>

15
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:29.700

63
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.180
<v Speaker 3>it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

64
00:02:13.181 --> 00:02:17.020
<v Speaker 3>the true shamonic tradition is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was explained to me,</v>

65
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.490
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by uh,</v>

66
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.990
<v Speaker 3>this Guy Jack hair and he said that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea is that you,</v>

67
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.330
<v Speaker 3>you eat the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the drug,</v>

68
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.630
<v Speaker 3>the plant Mush chaminade a miscarriage</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a very different,</v>

69
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.150
<v Speaker 3>it's not so Simon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's some other type of,</v>

70
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.340
<v Speaker 3>what you're shooting for is a Jessica</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mall.</v>

71
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.650
<v Speaker 3>You're should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the active compound is musket ball and</v>

72
00:02:35.651 --> 00:02:37.840
<v Speaker 3>what its Axon a very different mechanism</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>

73
00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:40.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the mechanism of action of m Anita</v>

74
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.970
<v Speaker 3>Miscarry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually acts as a Gaba agonist.</v>

75
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.120
<v Speaker 3>So it's going to give you more of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>neurotransmitter Gaba.</v>

76
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.020
<v Speaker 3>Whereas siliciden the mechanism of</v>
<v Speaker 3>action that there recently finding,</v>

77
00:02:50.021 --> 00:02:52.060
<v Speaker 3>which I learned a lot about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the maps conferences,</v>

78
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.830
<v Speaker 3>mechanism of action of silicide been is</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually restricting blood flow to</v>

79
00:02:56.831 --> 00:02:58.990
<v Speaker 3>your default mode network,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of your brain,</v>

80
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.320
<v Speaker 3>which is your top down control mechanism</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your brain so that you're basically</v>

81
00:03:03.321 --> 00:03:08.120
<v Speaker 3>your mental cerebral filter that allows</v>
<v Speaker 3>you to focus on the day to day mundane</v>

82
00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:11.510
<v Speaker 3>tasks starts to go to sleep and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>happens to be the center that controls</v>

83
00:03:11.511 --> 00:03:15.200
<v Speaker 3>depression and a bunch of other things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why the clinical application is</v>

84
00:03:15.201 --> 00:03:18.590
<v Speaker 3>proving so important and impressive and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these people,</v>

85
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.170
<v Speaker 3>but that's a totally different mechanism</v>
<v Speaker 3>of action.</v>

86
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.890
<v Speaker 3>Then the Amanita miscarried,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is basically flooding your brain</v>

87
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.160
<v Speaker 3>with more Gaba from what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the musk,</v>

88
00:03:28.161 --> 00:03:30.200
<v Speaker 3>Amal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a tricky beast and it doesn't</v>

89
00:03:30.201 --> 00:03:33.020
<v Speaker 3>necessarily come out through your gut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

90
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.960
<v Speaker 3>once it gets processed through your</v>
<v Speaker 3>kidneys and you piss it,</v>

91
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.090
<v Speaker 3>it can be passed up to five times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say through different people.</v>

92
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.230
<v Speaker 3>So like I could Piss,</v>

93
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.490
<v Speaker 1>oh sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could drink it,</v>

94
00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:45.960
<v Speaker 1>you could piss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give it to Brian,</v>

95
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.600
<v Speaker 1>he can take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Brian could give it to two</v>

96
00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:50.760
<v Speaker 1>other people and everybody will be high</v>
<v Speaker 1>as fuck.</v>

97
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they say?</v>

98
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.950
<v Speaker 1>How'd they know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would they know?</v>

99
00:03:55.951 --> 00:03:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Why would they find out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing with our lives?</v>

100
00:03:58.411 --> 00:04:00.460
<v Speaker 1>We're sitting around and drinking each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other's pissed to get high.</v>

101
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.180
<v Speaker 1>What are you seeing in fairies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cock sucker.</v>

102
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.790
<v Speaker 1>They love drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching Pluto.</v>

103
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.440
<v Speaker 1>The sure fire way if you really want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>commit is to eat it and then drink.</v>

104
00:04:10.441 --> 00:04:12.420
<v Speaker 1>You're pissed and then you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

105
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.030
<v Speaker 1>you feel so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it didn't work,</v>

106
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.820
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sitting there with piss mouth and not</v>

107
00:04:17.821 --> 00:04:19.980
<v Speaker 1>high and just taking what kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>loser ham.</v>

108
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.990
<v Speaker 1>I should just become a republican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

109
00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:26.130
<v Speaker 1>I should just go the other way and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>single malt scotch and sneaking some</v>

110
00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:29.690
<v Speaker 1>Cuban cigars and just become an asphalt</v>
<v Speaker 1>or renting a movie while I'm,</v>

111
