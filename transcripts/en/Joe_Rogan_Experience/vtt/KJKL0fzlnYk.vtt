<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a month.</v>

20
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:39.643
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in Europe for the whole month </v>

24
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.870
<v Speaker 1>it's everything in the toolbox I brought</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this record.</v>

25
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.820
<v Speaker 1>So that's Kinda where the title came </v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

26
00:00:52.821 --> 00:00:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.270
<v Speaker 1>it's been eight years since my last real</v>
<v Speaker 1>studio album,</v>

28
00:00:56.271 --> 00:00:58.940
<v Speaker 1>so I figured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

29
00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:01.100
<v Speaker 1>maybe this could be the last one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope not,</v>

30
00:01:01.101 --> 00:01:02.710
<v Speaker 1>but just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.441
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:04.340
<v Speaker 1>that my story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

33
00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:05.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the family,</v>

34
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.610
<v Speaker 1>I dedicate a lot more of my time to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

35
00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Then I used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

36
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm just because of some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.923
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extra issues we deal with which </v>

38
00:01:13.311 --> 00:01:14.990
<v Speaker 1>everything is wonderful and great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

39
00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:16.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dude,</v>

40
00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:18.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm 30 pounds lighter than the last time</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was here to do that.</v>

41
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it started here because I,</v>

42
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.740
<v Speaker 1>I put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I purposely came here that day.</v>

43
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.540
<v Speaker 1>It was the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you remember,</v>

44
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.690
<v Speaker 1>it was awhile ago and you've done a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand podcasts since that day.</v>

45
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.770
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.603
<v Speaker 1>it was the first time I had come out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started talking about anything </v>

47
00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:33.830
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.290
<v Speaker 1>that was going on in my life in a public</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

49
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.250
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.230
<v Speaker 1>I got a lot off my chest that day and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>also plan that day to,</v>

51
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.820
<v Speaker 1>to put myself in a position to hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself accountable by this,</v>

52
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.660
<v Speaker 1>by stating I don't feel good about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way I look right now.</v>

53
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.280
<v Speaker 1>And I reached out for like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretically for help,</v>

54
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.193
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I got an incredible response from </v>

55
00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.963
<v Speaker 1>the podcast audience and my own fans and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I got offered from everybody </v>

56
00:02:01.941 --> 00:02:03.740
<v Speaker 1>everywhere how to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and the other.</v>

57
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.963
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't really need that because within </v>

58
00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:10.940
<v Speaker 1>my own circle some people stepped up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also did it to hold myself accountable</v>

59
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:13.040
<v Speaker 1>to put it in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've thrown it out there,</v>

60
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.240
<v Speaker 1>I put it up there on the wall and snip </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stamped it and said,</v>

61
00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:18.950
<v Speaker 1>here's what I want out of life right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

62
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:22.150
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nobody stopping me but me and at</v>

63
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.993
<v Speaker 1>sometimes some of the things I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to get on and see you talking </v>

64
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:28.280
<v Speaker 1>about I'm not letting this inner bitch </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked my ass today.</v>

65
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.740
<v Speaker 1>And I just started taking things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that to heart,</v>

66
00:02:30.741 --> 00:02:32.080
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

67
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.800
<v Speaker 1>after she changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you do different?</v>

68
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.190
<v Speaker 1>We started talking about it last time in</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy.</v>

69
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.053
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's helped a lot for me because of </v>

70
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.310
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.821
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

72
00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:41.654
<v Speaker 1>the added pressures are family faces </v>
<v Speaker 1>with my oldest daughter having cystic </v>

73
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:46.670
<v Speaker 1>fibrosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.850
<v Speaker 1>it just for a long time it was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning how to live life with it,</v>

75
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that got heavy.</v>

76
00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:53.090
<v Speaker 1>There was some real dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:54.110
<v Speaker 1>heavy moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.210
<v Speaker 1>scary moments for her in the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.830
<v Speaker 1>so we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean as a human,</v>

80
00:02:57.831 --> 00:02:58.664
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have this baby and you're just </v>

81
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out how to not screw it</v>
<v Speaker 1>up with a normal health situation,</v>

82
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is this added thing.</v>

83
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 1>So it took a long time for me to come to</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>

84
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>At first I got really angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got into some real,</v>

85
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:13.763
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lieutenant Dan more with God kind of </v>

86
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>at the top of the sail boat flipped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 1>as I was there all the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it got to a point where I almost,</v>

89
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.483
<v Speaker 1>I was at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost got locked up for trying to </v>

90

<v Speaker 1>fight a cop that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 1>trying to just talk to me about </v>

92
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:30.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just lost my job.</v>

93
00:03:30.141 --> 00:03:30.974

<v Speaker 1>I had so much anger over so much that I </v>

94
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:35.614
<v Speaker 1>wasn't dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I found a guy that really got </v>

95
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:40.310
<v Speaker 1>me therapists and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

00:04:29.541 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 1>it's the added stress of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

120
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:33.490
<v Speaker 1>I have a wife that when I go on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road,</v>

121
00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:36.730
<v Speaker 1>she's the sole handler of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

122
00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

123
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.920
<v Speaker 1>And so that these things pile on you </v>
<v Speaker 1>guilt and stress and all this,</v>

124
00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:43.150
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

125
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.580
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just between that and when I'm home</v>

126
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:47.260
<v Speaker 1>I just invest myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be home,</v>

127
00:04:47.261 --> 00:04:49.300
<v Speaker 1>I want to do as much as I can to lift </v>
<v Speaker 1>that weight.</v>

128
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.270
<v Speaker 1>So like I get caught by the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the things I want to do,</v>

129
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 1>I can't do all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

130
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.873
<v Speaker 1>But it started again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm taking care of myself like I'm </v>

131
00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 1>actually about to start Jujitsu again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:04:58.481 --> 00:04:59.530
<v Speaker 1>which.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

133
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:00.364
<v Speaker 1>because I forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so goddamn fat in the middle of </v>

134
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.493
<v Speaker 1>hip escapes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

135
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.333
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was hurting my back or my neck every </v>

136
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:07.960
<v Speaker 1>other time I tried to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just quit because it was getting,</v>

137
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

138
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:10.180
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were advanced.</v>

139
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I was probably pretty close to getting a</v>
<v Speaker 1>blue belt,</v>

140
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was about a year in,</v>

141
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 1>on like four lessons a week with just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the private.</v>

142
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 1>I was with mark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Vanessa said,</v>

143
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.223
<v Speaker 1>Beverly Hills Jujitsu for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm just looking to see what I </v>

144
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:24.631
<v Speaker 1>want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

145
00:05:24.631 --> 00:05:26.950
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to Eddie a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to a few other guys.</v>

146
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:31.951
<v Speaker 1>Cron has taught you doing any exercise </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all besides that?</v>

147
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not much weights or anything like that.</v>

148
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

149
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.710
<v Speaker 1>keep it moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I two hour,</v>

150
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.350
<v Speaker 1>two hours on stage tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good to do something first.</v>

151
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a,</v>

152
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.250
<v Speaker 1>I always tell people like Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so grueling that I,</v>

153
00:05:47.251 --> 00:05:47.791
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

154
00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:48.311
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

155
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:50.720
<v Speaker 1>you could just jump in and you will get </v>
<v Speaker 1>in shape through Jujitsu,</v>

156
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.573
<v Speaker 1>but a good thing to do is find a place </v>
<v Speaker 1>that teaches you kettlebells and take </v>

157
00:05:56.111 --> 00:06:01.111
<v Speaker 1>some Kettlebell and just just get your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body strong enough that it can remember.</v>

158
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:03.610
<v Speaker 1>One of the things marcus used to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought marcus,</v>

159
00:06:03.611 --> 00:06:04.444
<v Speaker 1>used to run me around the gym for 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes before we could even start a </v>

160
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:07.610
<v Speaker 1>lesson.</v>

161
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Like I literally had to Puke for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first like month.</v>

162
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that old school way.</v>

163
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:14.690
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it would take so long that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be like,</v>

164
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:15.524
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're past the puking thing you ran </v>

165
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:17.084
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was like at first I would like </v>

166
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.083
<v Speaker 1>literally be run till I was puking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the crazy part of ours is 15 </v>

167
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:26.060
<v Speaker 1>minutes after you felt great when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were doing the last thing,</v>

168
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:27.770
<v Speaker 1>so it was it all work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

169
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The old school guys,</v>

170
00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:30.164
<v Speaker 1>that's how they used to do at these two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like all the old school Carlson </v>

171
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 1>gracie classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have a grueling physical workout,</v>

172
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 1>first hip escaped pushups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit ups,</v>

173
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 1>bodyweight squats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this different stuff.</v>

174
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 1>There's a good thought process behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

175
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:43.934
<v Speaker 1>not just that it gets you in shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also that you learn how to do </v>

176
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:46.994
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu when you're tired so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn how to just use technique and not </v>

177
00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:53.750
<v Speaker 1>use like you're almost have no choice </v>
<v Speaker 1>but to relax.</v>

178
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

179
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a people that disagree with that</v>

180
00:06:57.111 --> 00:06:57.944
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think you should learn technique </v>

181
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.760
<v Speaker 1>when you're fresh in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sits and better,</v>

182
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's just two different schools of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

183
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.533
<v Speaker 1>I don't think either one is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely good to understand what </v>

184
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:11.630
<v Speaker 1>it's like to be tired and how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to train and how to,</v>

185
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.640
<v Speaker 1>how to push yourself when your tire </v>
<v Speaker 1>shore.</v>

186
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited.</v>

187
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:16.004
<v Speaker 1>I'm really looking forward to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just started talking about like </v>

188
00:07:18.741 --> 00:07:20.160
<v Speaker 1>about two weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really getting back to,</v>

189
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.100
<v Speaker 1>well that's a lot of weight to lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

190
00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:25.670
<v Speaker 1>That's a big accomplishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got 15 to go to really to hit my goal.</v>

191
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will it be 2:25</v>

192
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:29.400
<v Speaker 1>to 25?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you good?</v>

193
00:07:29.401 --> 00:07:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

194
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking vitamins or supplements or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything along those lines.</v>

195
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Like a daily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

196
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:36.531
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

197
00:07:36.531 --> 00:07:39.650
<v Speaker 1>I have restrictions because I take blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinners and stuff because of titanium,</v>

198
00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:40.484
<v Speaker 1>heart valve I have so like I have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a vitamin that's devoid of a </v>

199
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.250
<v Speaker 1>vitamin K because that's what makes your</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood clot.</v>

200
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.113
<v Speaker 1>So I like a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of the juicing things and </v>

201
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:50.870
<v Speaker 1>like things like that when you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go on a juice cleanse,</v>

202
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:51.704
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it because it's like a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Kale based and like Kale is heavy </v>

203
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:56.354
<v Speaker 1>green with it's high in vitamin K,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll totally screw up my blood </v>

204
00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:00.360
<v Speaker 1>chemistry with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.480
<v Speaker 1>because I'm going the other direction </v>
<v Speaker 1>with blood thinners.</v>

206
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:03.863
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to otherwise like a clock could </v>

207
00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:08.240
<v Speaker 1>hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like stick to that titanium valve,</v>

208
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.310
<v Speaker 1>break off and wind up in my brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

209
00:08:10.311 --> 00:08:13.100
<v Speaker 1>And then Tom stroked out and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last thing we need.</v>

210
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.083
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when you put the microphone </v>

211
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:17.740
<v Speaker 1>up to your heart and you can hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

212
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:18.603
<v Speaker 1>I would say I'm so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like when I'm in here I've keep </v>

213
00:08:20.281 --> 00:08:22.040
<v Speaker 1>feeling like you can hear it anyway.</v>

214
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like all through this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear it.</v>

215
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Twentieth white noise to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I want to hear it,</v>

216
00:08:25.761 --> 00:08:26.594
<v Speaker 1>I can hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can take my pulse like this just by </v>

217
00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:28.990
<v Speaker 1>telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

218
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can feel it.</v>

219
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.570
<v Speaker 1>I can hear it in my own skull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I could hear it in my bones that it</v>

220
00:08:34.571 --> 00:08:35.600
<v Speaker 1>can hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in me.</v>

221
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.820
<v Speaker 1>How long is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good for?</v>

222
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.061
<v Speaker 1>Forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forever.</v>

223
00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:42.080
<v Speaker 1>As long as I take care of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's been 20 years.</v>

224
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.093
<v Speaker 1>Literally in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2018 it happened 90 or [inaudible] </v>

225
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.020
<v Speaker 1>98.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

226
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.140
<v Speaker 1>I just get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

227
00:08:48.141 --> 00:08:50.680
<v Speaker 1>as long as I keep the thinning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blood thinners going and you know,</v>

228
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.553
<v Speaker 1>I get checked in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

229
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.940
<v Speaker 1>two times,</v>

230
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the blood thinners it because</v>

231
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.000
<v Speaker 2>if you got a clot it would somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another get stuck in that valley or,</v>

232
00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:01.350
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

233
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.980
<v Speaker 2>It's a titanium valves to the clock </v>

235
00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:10.400
<v Speaker 2>too much claude.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What would happen to the regular?</v>

240
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:22.923
<v Speaker 2>The other choice would have been a pig </v>
<v Speaker 2>valve and those are good for about 15 </v>

<v Speaker 2>it could know Dallas was Dallas.</v>

351
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:43.170
<v Speaker 2>That's should've came up.</v>

352
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:46.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was weird.</v>

353
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:48.470
<v Speaker 2>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

354
00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.560
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

355
00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:53.260
<v Speaker 2>that's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like walkout songs are a big deal.</v>

356
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.770
<v Speaker 2>You can't have a wag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sets the tone.</v>

357
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.390
<v Speaker 2>The thing for me is when I hear one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my songs,</v>

358
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:59.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just always like,</v>

359
00:13:59.951 --> 00:14:00.401
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>

360
00:14:00.401 --> 00:14:05.401
<v Speaker 2>When you saw him becomes a curse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

361
00:14:05.551 --> 00:14:06.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

362
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:09.190
<v Speaker 2>Jon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anik does stats on fist bumps,</v>

363
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:10.323
<v Speaker 2>like how many times people fist bump </v>
<v Speaker 2>bruce buffer whether or not they win or </v>

364
00:14:12.461 --> 00:14:13.640
<v Speaker 2>lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

365
00:14:13.641 --> 00:14:14.474
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Diego Sanchez broke the curse and </v>

366
00:14:15.971 --> 00:14:19.450
<v Speaker 2>his last fight he fist bumped bruce any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any one?</v>

367
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:23.380
<v Speaker 2>So the fist bump was a cursed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to figure it out cause he,</v>

368
00:14:23.381 --> 00:14:27.100
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like 50 slash 50 right now,</v>

369
00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:27.934
<v Speaker 2>like whether or not people when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>fist bump priest buffer when they went </v>

370
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.263
<v Speaker 2>and there was a bad streak for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like three or four people in a row last </v>

371
00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.160
<v Speaker 2>that we're fist bumping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

372
00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:37.970
<v Speaker 2>bruce gives you the intro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

373
00:14:37.971 --> 00:14:38.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

374
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.440
<v Speaker 2>and when he gives you the Dji go a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nightmare,</v>

375
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.710
<v Speaker 2>she's a little fist bump and if you fist</v>
<v Speaker 2>bump them back,</v>

376
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:48.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

377
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.193
<v Speaker 2>if you do engage in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Anik was trying to figure out like </v>

378
00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:56.930
<v Speaker 2>Anik is kind of a degenerate gambler in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most positive way.</v>

379
00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's not losing his family or his</v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

380
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:00.644
<v Speaker 2>but he fucking loves gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he's always giving you stats on </v>

381
00:15:03.411 --> 00:15:08.360
<v Speaker 2>this and that is something to put a on </v>
<v Speaker 2>things he actually bets on.</v>

382
00:15:08.361 --> 00:15:11.150
<v Speaker 2>But he's always thinking that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you bet on it?</v>

383
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.043
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if you could bet on how many </v>

384
00:15:14.271 --> 00:15:18.020
<v Speaker 2>people who fist bump bruce buffer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could find somebody to take the bet.</v>

385
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.033
<v Speaker 2>The thought process would be you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally in the zone if you've got the </v>

386
00:15:21.111 --> 00:15:24.710
<v Speaker 2>time to fist bump bruce buffer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if it buy it though,</v>

387
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.470
<v Speaker 2>because it's also your moment when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying your name and.</v>

388
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

389
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.600
<v Speaker 2>It's a tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tricky.</v>

390
00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:38.483
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like it's about even just one </v>

391
00:15:40.311 --> 00:15:41.144
<v Speaker 2>of them things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone should do stats on it because </v>

392
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Jon Anik is only done like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

393
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.470
<v Speaker 2>just off the top of his head in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>basement right now.</v>

394
00:15:48.471 --> 00:15:52.190
<v Speaker 2>Starting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Starting to watch the fight for sure.</v>

395
00:15:52.191 --> 00:15:53.240
<v Speaker 2>Write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

396
00:15:53.241 --> 00:15:54.390
<v Speaker 2>Let's take the notes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

397
00:15:54.391 --> 00:15:56.180
<v Speaker 2>you can basically bet on anything these </v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

398
00:15:56.181 --> 00:15:57.014
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Vegas you can pretty much find a lot </v>

399
00:16:00.051 --> 00:16:00.884
<v Speaker 2>of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you could bet on you that you </v>

400
00:16:02.391 --> 00:16:04.520
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even bet,</v>

401
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.950
<v Speaker 2>but I liked the fact that you can bet on</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

402
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:10.790
<v Speaker 2>Why Not Anders coin flips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

403
00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:11.624
<v Speaker 2>I liked that it's freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like this idea that people are </v>

404
00:16:13.911 --> 00:16:15.860
<v Speaker 2>telling you what you can and can't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with your money.</v>

405
00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't gamble your money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

406
00:16:17.781 --> 00:16:19.250
<v Speaker 2>you have to go to a spot in the desert.</v>

407
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.440
<v Speaker 2>Like why says who says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

408
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.690
<v Speaker 2>like why can't you gamble right here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why can't someplace,</v>

409
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:26.533
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why can't you have a casino on every </v>

410
00:16:27.531 --> 00:16:29.000
<v Speaker 2>corner?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>

411
00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:30.111
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

412
00:16:30.111 --> 00:16:34.940
<v Speaker 2>people are going to lose our paycheck on</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves are family and one was really,</v>

413
00:16:34.941 --> 00:16:35.774
<v Speaker 2>really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really is that what's going to do </v>

414
00:16:37.581 --> 00:16:40.070
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at the casino maybe be for a while,</v>

415
00:16:40.071 --> 00:16:41.630
<v Speaker 2>but then people will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

416
00:16:41.631 --> 00:16:46.160
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't go there as much as like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the infant tyler [inaudible] of people,</v>

417
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep them,</v>

418
00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:48.793
<v Speaker 2>protect them from themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't protect them from liquor </v>

419
00:16:50.751 --> 00:16:52.430
<v Speaker 2>stores are fast cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

420
00:16:52.431 --> 00:16:54.320
<v Speaker 2>those things were everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everywhere.</v>

421
00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.340
<v Speaker 2>Good point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

422
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you man.</v>

423
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.200
<v Speaker 2>I could never live in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

424
00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:04.010
<v Speaker 2>I could live in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

425
00:17:04.011 --> 00:17:08.150
<v Speaker 2>if it was between Beirut and Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegas,</v>

426
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:09.590
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll figure it out.</v>

427
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:11.680
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

428
00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:15.140
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me like this.</v>

429
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:16.003
<v Speaker 2>Just the whole thing is it's built.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's shows and it's wonderful </v>

430
00:17:20.021 --> 00:17:22.730
<v Speaker 2>and as neon there's great restaurants </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that stuff,</v>

431
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.310
<v Speaker 2>but it's also built on you losing money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

432
00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.600
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is built on you losing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When's the real population of Vegas?</v>

433
00:17:29.601 --> 00:17:30.434
<v Speaker 2>Like a half a million people like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people that aren't there visiting </v>

434
00:17:33.771 --> 00:17:36.800
<v Speaker 2>gambling and for the fuckery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's take a guess.</v>

435
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm guessing like half a million people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

436
00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.650
<v Speaker 2>I bet you're about right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six,</v>

437
00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:43.840
<v Speaker 2>600,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30,000.</v>

438
00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty far off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty close.</v>

439
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:48.170
<v Speaker 2>That's a good guest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would that have been?</v>

440
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:52.880
<v Speaker 2>Close enough to win the price is right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

441
00:17:52.881 --> 00:17:56.190
<v Speaker 2>so if you've got a real small town there</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's acting like a city too.</v>

442
00:17:56.191 --> 00:17:58.060
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

443
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.950
<v Speaker 2>like what is the population at any given</v>
<v Speaker 2>time with all the hotels filled?</v>

444
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:07.600
<v Speaker 2>This weekend's a big week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least dolt more than that probably,</v>

445
00:18:07.601 --> 00:18:10.380
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying at least even like an off</v>
<v Speaker 2>season,</v>

446
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:10.830
<v Speaker 2>off day.</v>

447
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:11.663
<v Speaker 2>You're probably at least double that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of the folks that work in </v>

448
00:18:14.341 --> 00:18:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they live in like Henderson or something</v>

449
00:18:16.501 --> 00:18:18.800
<v Speaker 2>like that where you can go and a nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>

450
00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:22.770
<v Speaker 2>Kids can ride bikes in the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like normal for there to uh,</v>

451
00:18:22.771 --> 00:18:24.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>summerland too.</v>

452
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:26.710
<v Speaker 2>That's really nice over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

453
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.650
<v Speaker 2>There's a few of those spots that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

454
00:18:28.651 --> 00:18:30.240
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually like staying over there at that</v>

455
00:18:30.241 --> 00:18:31.074
<v Speaker 2>red rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the don't like the Strip </v>

456
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.253
<v Speaker 2>fuckery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

457
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:36.910
<v Speaker 2>That's why I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

458
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:37.783
<v Speaker 2>just seemed like a quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I want the fuck where y'all take a </v>

459
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:39.883
<v Speaker 2>cab over 40 minutes away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She says there's one and a half 90 </v>

460
00:18:44.291 --> 00:18:47.400
<v Speaker 2>people there at any given time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably more like that.</v>

461
00:18:47.401 --> 00:18:49.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for the fights,</v>

462
00:18:49.411 --> 00:18:52.170
<v Speaker 2>what about a big fight weekend I typed </v>
<v Speaker 2>in for hotels.</v>

463
00:18:52.171 --> 00:18:53.640
<v Speaker 2>How many people were in that hotel </v>
<v Speaker 2>rooms?</v>

464
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:56.940
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a 148,000</v>

465
00:18:56.941 --> 00:18:57.960

<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you right now,</v>

496
00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.793
<v Speaker 2>gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Burke crushers going on a cruise and </v>

498
00:20:33.811 --> 00:20:36.390
<v Speaker 2>this fitness challenges falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

499
00:20:36.391 --> 00:20:39.600
<v Speaker 2>Bert is strongly in last place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Talk about the Mickey Mantle Gene.</v>

501
00:20:41.891 --> 00:20:45.030
<v Speaker 2>He's not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's fascinating is red shift.</v>

502
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.560
<v Speaker 2>Fear is very close to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's only,</v>

503
00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:51.490

<v Speaker 2>That's sneaky bitch that he was ahead of</v>

504
00:20:51.491 --> 00:20:53.140
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's how close he is.</v>

505
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:54.303
<v Speaker 2>He's so close that before his workout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like 100 points ahead of me </v>

506
00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:01.630
<v Speaker 2>before my workout rather after his.</v>

<v Speaker 2>If you're an asshole and you want to get</v>

00:21:08.201 --> 00:21:12.310
<v Speaker 2>on a fucking treadmill for two hours,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

613
00:26:06.561 --> 00:26:07.394
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's because it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's some psychological way of </v>

614
00:26:09.411 --> 00:26:12.260
<v Speaker 2>ripping things that some people are more</v>
<v Speaker 2>talented at it,</v>

615
00:26:12.261 --> 00:26:14.720
<v Speaker 2>that they just know where to make cool.</v>

616
00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:19.780
<v Speaker 2>They make it look like if you had like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pair of Levi's that were the.</v>

617
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.400
<v Speaker 2>He was getting thin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would advance that shit.</v>

618
00:26:22.401 --> 00:26:23.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was something cool.</v>

619
00:26:23.391 --> 00:26:24.224
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would like if it was like we didn't </v>

00:26:25.281 --> 00:26:27.200
<v Speaker 2>do it on like rip them up like they do </v>
<v Speaker 2>nowadays,</v>

621
00:26:27.201 --> 00:26:29.540
<v Speaker 2>but like let's say you had a pair of </v>
<v Speaker 2>jeans long enough,</v>

622
00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:31.710
<v Speaker 2>they know the knees would get thin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they ripped a little.</v>

623
00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:32.573
<v Speaker 2>You just kind of run with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe stress him out a little bit more </v>

624
00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:39.410
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh well presenting the $1,625</v>

625
00:26:39.411 --> 00:26:41.630
<v Speaker 2>designer tee shirt complete with tears </v>
<v Speaker 2>and holes.</v>

626
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:42.643
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can all agree if you buy that you're </v>

627
00:26:45.001 --> 00:26:47.850
<v Speaker 2>a fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you spent a thousand dollars on a tee</v>

628
00:26:47.851 --> 00:26:48.684
<v Speaker 2>shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of.</v>

629
00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:49.683
<v Speaker 2>The only good thing about that is I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that's the lady's tee shirt and </v>

630
00:26:51.511 --> 00:26:52.344
<v Speaker 2>I'm holding bumped them and all she has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do is bend over tire shoes and it </v>

631
00:26:57.151 --> 00:26:58.710
<v Speaker 2>might not be a nip slip.</v>

632
00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.050
<v Speaker 2>It might be a nip poke through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

633
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:01.913
<v Speaker 2>Like look where those holes are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quite possibly those ties are jutting </v>

<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

636
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.290
<v Speaker 2>She might not even be wearing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shirt.</v>

637
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.860
<v Speaker 2>That might not even be a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be a mannequin.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was an amazing routine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it while I was trying to figure </v>

695
00:29:58.571 --> 00:30:01.270
<v Speaker 2>out a way that I get away with making </v>
<v Speaker 2>fun of Bruce Jenner without being called</v>

696
00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:05.470
<v Speaker 2>transphobic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>circuitous route.</v>

00:30:37.691 --> 00:30:38.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

708

<v Speaker 2>It's a dope car.</v>

710
00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:45.460
<v Speaker 2>And he was a dope car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

784
00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:02.620
<v Speaker 2>If it's not a spectacle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not interesting.</v>

785
00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:06.230
<v Speaker 2>I have to keep changing things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's not an absolute spectacle to the</v>

<v Speaker 2>no matter what.</v>

792
00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:24.020

<v Speaker 2>you won't be able to use anymore.</v>

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:42.430
<v Speaker 2>like multiple fucking whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

927
00:40:42.431 --> 00:40:43.264
<v Speaker 2>like molten dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the video of the lava </v>

928
00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:47.763
<v Speaker 2>consuming that Mustang?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you walk Haasz dissolved if you got </v>

929
00:40:51.851 --> 00:40:53.680
<v Speaker 2>payments and you just fucking damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

930
00:40:53.681 --> 00:40:57.010
<v Speaker 2>this car is killing me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These payments at killing me just parked</v>

931
00:40:57.011 --> 00:40:57.844
<v Speaker 2>that bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would that lava is coming in Hawaii </v>

932
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:03.040
<v Speaker 2>watching get melted.</v>

933
00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.233
<v Speaker 2>Set up a camera better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine there's a lot of mustangs over </v>

934
00:41:06.461 --> 00:41:07.294
<v Speaker 2>there either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably is a lot of American cars </v>

935
00:41:09.371 --> 00:41:10.101
<v Speaker 2>over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

936
00:41:10.101 --> 00:41:10.934
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they buy a lot of toyotas because they </v>

937
00:41:12.731 --> 00:41:14.380
<v Speaker 2>don't break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're small.</v>

938
00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:17.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's also like you don't do,</v>

939
00:41:17.381 --> 00:41:19.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything has to get flown over there.</v>

940
00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:22.810
<v Speaker 2>So you don't want anything to break </v>
<v Speaker 2>superexpensive yeah.</v>

941
00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:23.973
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Food is more expensive there than like </v>

942
00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:30.640
<v Speaker 2>the only other place that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>comparable to me was Perth really?</v>

943
00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:33.140
<v Speaker 2>Well because everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like everything is same day.</v>

944
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:38.070
<v Speaker 2>It's the furthest like city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like isolated by itself in Australia and</v>

945
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:42.410
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe in the world away from any</v>
<v Speaker 2>other major city.</v>

946
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:43.820
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

947
00:41:43.821 --> 00:41:44.654
<v Speaker 2>Because Australia is as big as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States and it's really the only </v>

948
00:41:47.541 --> 00:41:50.460
<v Speaker 2>major city on the west coast that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>

949
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.220
<v Speaker 2>How big is Perth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

950
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like a city and know.</v>

951
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:57.440
<v Speaker 2>Do you perform there a lot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not allowed to spend.</v>

952
00:41:57.441 --> 00:41:59.630
<v Speaker 2>Probably almost 10 years since I've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Australia.</v>

953
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:02.390
<v Speaker 2>I love Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do not love that fucking flight,</v>

954
00:42:02.391 --> 00:42:03.224
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tough.</v>

955
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:04.850
<v Speaker 2>That's a rough life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Takes a minute.</v>

956
00:42:04.851 --> 00:42:06.050
<v Speaker 2>They'll get over that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

957
00:42:06.051 --> 00:42:07.100
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you land and you're like,</v>

958
00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.650
<v Speaker 2>where am I for a couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

959
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:17.230
<v Speaker 2>That's what the fuck is that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a fish with a lion head.</v>

960
00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:19.640
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

961
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.650
<v Speaker 2>that's what they thought Jonah and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whale looked like.</v>

962
00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:23.840
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thousand years ago.</v>

963
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Strange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

964
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Like dude was trying to make a run for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and then look at emily was like,</v>

965
00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:31.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get the fuck away from this</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

966
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:34.910
<v Speaker 2>Kind of looks like me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a little disturbing.</v>

967
00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:39.050
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm gonna get Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bald headed dude with a beard.</v>

968
00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:42.740
<v Speaker 2>Trying to get away from this lion fish </v>
<v Speaker 2>with wings thing.</v>

969
00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:43.790
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what they thought.</v>

970
00:42:43.791 --> 00:42:45.710
<v Speaker 2>A whale was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Craziness.</v>

971
00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:47.473
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just imagine what it was like living a </v>

972
00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:53.960
<v Speaker 2>thousand years ago when there was no </v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures.</v>

973
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:55.400
<v Speaker 2>That's the glass floor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

974
00:42:55.401 --> 00:42:57.860
<v Speaker 2>that's my feet right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're in this church,</v>

975
00:42:57.861 --> 00:42:59.210
<v Speaker 2>the church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A thousand years old.</v>

976
00:42:59.211 --> 00:43:01.340
<v Speaker 2>And that goes back to that last one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy,</v>

977
00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:04.340
<v Speaker 2>that one that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the glass floor.</v>

978
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.233
<v Speaker 2>And then you look down and they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>this entirely different church </v>

979
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:13.340
<v Speaker 2>underneath it that's way older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't know how old it is.</v>

980
00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:16.460
<v Speaker 2>Been there forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be several thousand years old.</v>

981
00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.220
<v Speaker 2>The church is gorgeous though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of those churches.</v>

982
00:43:19.221 --> 00:43:20.990
<v Speaker 2>And have you been to the Vatican?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

983
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:23.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the mind fuck of all mine phones.</v>

984
00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.233
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like St Peter's Basilica when you're </v>

985
00:43:25.941 --> 00:43:27.500
<v Speaker 2>walking around that place and you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

986
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:29.930
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

987
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:32.090
<v Speaker 2>how did people do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's retarded,</v>

988
00:43:32.091 --> 00:43:34.100
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievable.</v>

989
00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:37.130
<v Speaker 2>Vatican's no power saws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

990
00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.320
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no fucking cranes.</v>

991
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:44.090
<v Speaker 2>Everything was like ladders and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The paintings and art.</v>

992
00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:46.700
<v Speaker 2>Just stunning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stunning.</v>

993
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:50.210
<v Speaker 2>Billions of dollars with the art and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole area.</v>

994
00:43:50.211 --> 00:43:52.340
<v Speaker 2>The whole Vatican is essentially its own</v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

995
00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:53.193
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they can keep those kid fuckers over </v>

996
00:43:54.531 --> 00:43:56.330
<v Speaker 2>there and they never have to export </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

997
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:58.380
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

1002
00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:13.160

<v Speaker 2>That's a dark,</v>

1003
00:44:13.161 --> 00:44:15.430
<v Speaker 2>dark institution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no denying it.</v>

1004
00:44:15.431 --> 00:44:16.264
<v Speaker 2>I mean they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just busted another group of </v>

1005
00:44:17.511 --> 00:44:19.580
<v Speaker 2>priests in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Pennsylvania,</v>

1006
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:23.450
<v Speaker 2>molested more than a thousand kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moving them around,</v>

1007
00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:28.230
<v Speaker 2>charging them organized religion in </v>
<v Speaker 2>general is the biggest mind controlled.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's over existed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1009

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:36.270
<v Speaker 1>and what's the best way and make you </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe a certain thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's better ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some that you go,</v>

1015
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.000
<v Speaker 1>What have they done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so terrible.</v>

1016
00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:46.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1017
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:49.980
<v Speaker 1>no baptist scandals like that large </v>
<v Speaker 1>scale scandals.</v>

1018
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:51.563
<v Speaker 1>Even the Mormons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they've had a few like dudes who </v>

1019
00:44:53.321 --> 00:44:55.760
<v Speaker 1>want a more than one bride that got </v>
<v Speaker 1>greedy and more than a few.</v>

1020
00:44:56.290 --> 00:45:00.840
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole part of their thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how they still live,</v>

1021
00:45:00.841 --> 00:45:01.674
<v Speaker 1>but there's some sex sec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sec tease that a branched off and got </v>

1022
00:45:07.921 --> 00:45:08.754
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real freaky on the scale that the </v>

1023
00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Catholic Church has done things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unprecedented.</v>

1024
00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Unprecedented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Completely.</v>

1025
00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:15.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they,</v>

1026
00:45:15.771 --> 00:45:20.550
<v Speaker 1>they actively shield these people from </v>
<v Speaker 1>prosecution and they kept it all.</v>

1027
00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are people actually getting like,</v>

1028
00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:26.490
<v Speaker 1>like I've heard some things like they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going after like cardinals and shit,</v>

1029
00:45:26.491 --> 00:45:27.490
<v Speaker 1>like the criminals.</v>

1030
00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.810
<v Speaker 1>That is the step down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1031
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:30.743
<v Speaker 1>That last pope had to step down because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to prosecute him for crimes </v>

1032
00:45:32.791 --> 00:45:33.624
<v Speaker 1>against humanity because he was one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dudes who orchestrated a lot of </v>

1033
00:45:36.001 --> 00:45:36.900
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1034
00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:42.040
<v Speaker 1>The Guy Right before then he moved a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>who went on to molest 100 deaf children.</v>

1035
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember reading stuff about that.</v>

1036
00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.570
<v Speaker 1>It's dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dark,</v>

1037
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:49.560
<v Speaker 1>and it's one of those things where </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1038
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a part of their family.</v>

1039
00:45:52.741 --> 00:45:54.340
<v Speaker 1>It's been a part of their families </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

1040
00:45:54.341 --> 00:45:56.370
<v Speaker 1>It's been a part of their history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go to church,</v>

1041
00:45:56.371 --> 00:45:59.040
<v Speaker 1>they pay their respects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's okay.</v>

1042
00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:00.870
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't want to hear it,</v>

1043
00:46:00.871 --> 00:46:01.704
<v Speaker 1>but it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The old evidence is just so </v>

1044
00:46:03.451 --> 00:46:05.580
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much,</v>

1045
00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:08.590
<v Speaker 1>so much shit that's attached to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point I.</v>

1046
00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:11.700
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think again,</v>

1047
00:46:11.701 --> 00:46:13.530
<v Speaker 1>people like you're saying you get.</v>

1048
00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.690
<v Speaker 1>I was raised Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>

1049
00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.960
<v Speaker 1>By the time I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did this thing called confirmation,</v>

1050
00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:22.760
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a similar thing to what this,</v>

1051
00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:23.683
<v Speaker 1>the time that you're becoming a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making good choices as an adult </v>

1052
00:46:25.981 --> 00:46:28.020
<v Speaker 1>because it wasn't just men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

1053
00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:30.190
<v Speaker 1>by the time I did that and realized </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1054
00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:31.770
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1055
00:46:31.771 --> 00:46:33.250
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot or you know,</v>

1056
00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:35.910
<v Speaker 1>there's low too much magic going on for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1057
00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:37.710
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like going on with this.</v>

1058
00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Like I like just factual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledgeable things,</v>

1059
00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:44.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if these people really existed,</v>

1060
00:46:44.851 --> 00:46:46.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and were they really like,</v>

1061
00:46:46.201 --> 00:46:47.034
<v Speaker 1>I'm not buying into the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody on this earth didn't take a </v>

1062
00:46:50.701 --> 00:46:51.900
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I took a shit.</v>

1063
00:46:51.901 --> 00:46:53.790
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all take the same shifts.</v>

1064
00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:56.760
<v Speaker 1>It'd be nice if someone came up with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good religion,</v>

1065
00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:59.520
<v Speaker 1>a real solid locked down one.</v>

1066
00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:00.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is one.</v>

1067
00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.920
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd all just would have to agree on it.</v>

1068
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:04.463
<v Speaker 1>How about just the golden rule that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't mean that could basically be a </v>

1069
00:47:07.891 --> 00:47:10.470
<v Speaker 1>religion and it's of the Church of </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal law,</v>

1070
00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:12.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do unto others as you would have them do</v>

1071
00:47:12.841 --> 00:47:15.560
<v Speaker 1>unto you and you could hold corporations</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>

1072
00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:16.381
<v Speaker 1>You could be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1073
00:47:16.381 --> 00:47:17.214
<v Speaker 1>we stuck what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's more powerful than 10 million </v>

1074
00:47:19.081 --> 00:47:19.914
<v Speaker 1>people on a facebook page that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching these corporations and the </v>

1075
00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:24.481
<v Speaker 1>minute they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1076
00:47:24.481 --> 00:47:25.314
<v Speaker 1>you're not giving back to the community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are taken care of the people that are </v>

1077
00:47:27.091 --> 00:47:28.920
<v Speaker 1>taking care of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's easily.</v>

1078
00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:30.340
<v Speaker 1>But it takes work.</v>

1079
00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:32.170
<v Speaker 2>It's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easily done.</v>

1080
00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:36.070
<v Speaker 2>If everybody in the world just really </v>
<v Speaker 2>treated the next person like they wanted</v>

1081
00:47:36.071 --> 00:47:39.610
<v Speaker 2>to be treated themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

1082
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:41.330
<v Speaker 2>And did it as a law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1083
00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:42.190
<v Speaker 2>And then we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1084
00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:45.070
<v Speaker 2>we held people accountable to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1085
00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.140
<v Speaker 2>You are not responding to the universal </v>
<v Speaker 2>law,</v>

1086
00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:49.500
<v Speaker 2>universal golden golden rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1087
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:51.760
<v Speaker 2>it sounds super simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean to get a lot of work,</v>

1088
00:47:51.761 --> 00:47:54.760
<v Speaker 2>but it's the principle is simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1089
00:47:54.761 --> 00:47:55.594
<v Speaker 2>And all the other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all other forms of commerce and </v>

1090
00:47:57.671 --> 00:47:59.860
<v Speaker 2>everything else would still fall under </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1091
00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:00.963
<v Speaker 2>Just like you could do whatever you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as you're treating people </v>

1092
00:48:02.711 --> 00:48:03.760
<v Speaker 2>kindly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1093
00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:08.020
<v Speaker 2>Like ideally commerce and capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff should be real simple.</v>

1094
00:48:08.021 --> 00:48:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Like you have a great cd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to sell it,</v>

1095
00:48:11.681 --> 00:48:14.260
<v Speaker 2>you want 20 bucks for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody gives you 20 bucks,</v>

1096
00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:16.180
<v Speaker 2>they're happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're happy.</v>

1097
00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:18.070
<v Speaker 2>That should be commerce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1098
00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:19.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be.</v>

1099
00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:21.250
<v Speaker 2>You sell something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people buy it,</v>

1100
00:48:21.251 --> 00:48:24.040
<v Speaker 2>everybody's good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you get a little greedy,</v>

1101
00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:24.913
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we can figure out a way to corner </v>

1102
00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:27.273
<v Speaker 2>this market and keep other people from </v>
<v Speaker 2>selling this or selling that or we've </v>

1103
00:48:31.121 --> 00:48:34.740
<v Speaker 2>got to stop people from growing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if they grow this and sell that,</v>

1104
00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:35.613
<v Speaker 2>you're not doing what's best for doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you would want them to do for to </v>

1105
00:48:38.651 --> 00:48:39.750
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1106
00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:42.550
<v Speaker 2>So you're breaking the law violation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The golden rule.</v>

1107
00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:43.423
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's what I've thought about it </v>

1108
00:48:45.431 --> 00:48:46.450
<v Speaker 2>obviously before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1109
00:48:46.451 --> 00:48:48.370
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would be like,</v>

1110
00:48:48.371 --> 00:48:50.110
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be a really cool thing to do.</v>

1111
00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:50.973
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be the way you know somebody </v>

1112
00:48:52.601 --> 00:48:53.900
<v Speaker 2>with enough charisma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1113
00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:55.090
<v Speaker 2>could pull it off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1114
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:56.103
<v Speaker 2>get people to get behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really all it would say because </v>

1115
00:48:58.070 --> 00:48:59.170
<v Speaker 2>people getting behind it.</v>

1116
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:00.333
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is there's so many </v>

1117
00:49:01.001 --> 00:49:04.450
<v Speaker 2>people that just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're seeing this with politics,</v>

1118
00:49:04.451 --> 00:49:05.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm,</v>

1119
00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:07.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm fascinated by these cabinet </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearings,</v>

1120
00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.470
<v Speaker 2>like a watch little clips of it before I</v>
<v Speaker 2>just have to tune out and talk fuckery.</v>

1121
00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.560
<v Speaker 2>Talk about fuckery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1122
00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:17.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that do did or what he</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't do,</v>

1123
00:49:17.051 --> 00:49:19.090
<v Speaker 2>but I think what's happening is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that,</v>

1124
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:24.510
<v Speaker 2>what's happening is first of all he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved with a.</v>

1125
00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:27.670
<v Speaker 2>He was a big part of the Patriot Act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

1126
00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:29.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's involved in some,</v>

1127
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:33.550
<v Speaker 2>some issues that a lot of people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>very concerned with in terms of like how</v>

1128
00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:37.800
<v Speaker 2>his position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his stance on privacy and on rights and.</v>

1129
00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:38.750
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1130
00:49:39.090 --> 00:49:43.060
<v Speaker 2>There's more to it than just did you </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck with someone in high school?</v>

1131
00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:46.140
<v Speaker 2>Did you sexually assault someone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you do that when you're 18 digit,</v>

1132
00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:46.710
<v Speaker 2>do you remember?</v>

1133
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:47.543
<v Speaker 2>Like there's more to it than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just like they don't want that </v>

1134
00:49:50.591 --> 00:49:51.424
<v Speaker 2>guy in there and then you're seeing all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that want to pretend that </v>

1135
00:49:54.131 --> 00:49:56.290
<v Speaker 2>he's the best guy ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all the people.</v>

1136
00:49:57.130 --> 00:49:59.410
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating.</v>

1137
00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:00.753
<v Speaker 2>It's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating to watch because it's </v>

1138
00:50:02.231 --> 00:50:07.231
<v Speaker 2>essentially like a less like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Clarence Thomas hearings from.</v>

1139
00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Was it like the 19 eighties?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe Clarence Thomas.</v>

1140
00:50:12.131 --> 00:50:13.990
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that was late eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Early nineties.</v>

1141
00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:15.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around there.</v>

1142
00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:16.533
<v Speaker 2>Clarence Thomas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was with Anita Hill where he had </v>

1143
00:50:19.571 --> 00:50:23.950
<v Speaker 2>sexually harassed or they were working </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and she came whatever,</v>

1144
00:50:23.951 --> 00:50:24.784
<v Speaker 2>coke or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that he's now the longest </v>

1145
00:50:26.591 --> 00:50:28.520
<v Speaker 2>running a member of the Supreme Court.</v>

1146
00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:31.653
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's now been in the supreme court </v>

1147
00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:33.970
<v Speaker 2>longer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1148
00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Read that check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make sure that's true.</v>

1149
00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:39.490
<v Speaker 2>Isn't Bruce Katie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ken's Bader Ginsburg.</v>

1150
00:50:39.491 --> 00:50:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Has she been there longest serving 26 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years as of October fourth mob?</v>

1151
00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:45.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

1152
00:50:46.090 --> 00:50:47.650
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1153
00:50:47.651 --> 00:50:48.484
<v Speaker 2>So it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Needed hell's out there then with the </v>

1154
00:50:51.521 --> 00:50:52.354
<v Speaker 2>memory of pubic hairs on Coke and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie now and Hbo Movie Not Too Long </v>

1155
00:50:56.651 --> 00:50:58.030
<v Speaker 2>Ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1156
00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:59.440

<v Speaker 2>I saw it.</v>

1157
00:50:59.450 --> 00:50:59.950

<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

1158
00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:01.240
<v Speaker 2>Was it okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a pretty good movie.</v>

1159
00:51:01.241 --> 00:51:02.320
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1160
00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:03.790
<v Speaker 2>we lived through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

1161
00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:07.130
<v Speaker 2>it's like whenever I see movies about </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Oj trial or something,</v>

1162
00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:07.540

<v Speaker 2>We saw it live for like 700 days.</v>

1164
00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:15.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm always fascinated by those movies </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of creative license.</v>

1165
00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:17.590
<v Speaker 2>Like if you do a movie on Richard Nixon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:20.170

<v Speaker 2>Or even crazier.</v>

1167
00:51:20.171 --> 00:51:22.690
<v Speaker 2>You do a movie on Lincoln Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what the fuck.</v>

1168
00:51:22.691 --> 00:51:25.880

<v Speaker 2>he wrote it down.</v>

1169
00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:30.010
<v Speaker 2>You're having him say a bunch of Shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>Day to day talking to his wife and kids.</v>

1170

<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1172
00:51:34.871 --> 00:51:37.610
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to just put some words in</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Washington's mouth like</v>

1213
00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:43.550

1229
00:54:22.221 --> 00:54:27.221
<v Speaker 2>nominated for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably was probably was from moon,</v>

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:38.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just one of them dudes too.</v>

1235
00:54:38.871 --> 00:54:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're that good of an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you blend into these movies.</v>

1236
00:54:42.321 --> 00:54:42.970
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's not Sam Rockwell.</v>

1238
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:46.063
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's almost a compliment to the </v>

1239
00:54:47.931 --> 00:54:51.290
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now should he be more of the leading guy</v>

1240
00:54:51.291 --> 00:54:52.530
<v Speaker 1>and doing those big rolls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing actor.</v>

1242
00:54:53.661 --> 00:54:55.800
<v Speaker 1>But he's gotten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's done some really big things,</v>

1254
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.460
<v Speaker 1>It was a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The road freaked me out.</v>

1255
00:55:19.461 --> 00:55:22.220
<v Speaker 1>I turned it off when you're teaching his</v>
<v Speaker 1>son how to shoot himself in the mouth.</v>

1256
00:55:22.221 --> 00:55:23.060
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

1263
00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:36.893
<v Speaker 1>I want it to go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a few of those movies that are </v>

1264
00:55:39.231 --> 00:55:40.910
<v Speaker 1>just so depressing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>a new thing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tiny yeezy slides too small for your </v>

00:59:55.340 --> 01:00:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think it's crazy to me because</v>

1359
01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:02.570
<v Speaker 1>there's an era of his career that I look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at it and I'm like,</v>

1364
01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:16.670
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a professional troll now.</v>

<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like eight months ago where that was </v>

1371
01:00:31.221 --> 01:00:32.920
<v Speaker 1>like poop scoop,</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't give a fuck </v>

1384
01:00:54.261 --> 01:00:54.861
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1385
01:00:54.861 --> 01:00:56.930
<v Speaker 1>you're not that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've never been a,</v>

1386
01:00:56.931 --> 01:00:58.130
<v Speaker 1>I need publicity guy.</v>

1387
01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:00.710
<v Speaker 1>Well here's what it is and here's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is.</v>

1388
01:01:00.711 --> 01:01:04.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like people like to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>speculate about what I do or my career.</v>

1389
01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:05.533
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've written a few songs in this life </v>

1390
01:01:08.181 --> 01:01:09.014
<v Speaker 1>that I could go somewhere and sit down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just sit on a fucking stump and eat </v>

1391
01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:14.120
<v Speaker 1>food for the rest of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never worry,</v>

1392
01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:15.433
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could feed my family and all that off </v>

1393
01:01:16.431 --> 01:01:17.264
<v Speaker 1>of a few songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make music because I love making </v>

1394
01:01:18.861 --> 01:01:19.700
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1395
01:01:19.790 --> 01:01:20.623
<v Speaker 1>And of course you want people to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to fucking the more people you </v>

1396
01:01:23.541 --> 01:01:24.374
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want people you want fame or all </v>

1397
01:01:26.170 --> 01:01:27.020
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't,</v>

1398
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:28.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

1399
01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:28.893
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the first things is the first </v>

1400
01:01:29.961 --> 01:01:31.810
<v Speaker 1>time I ever came on your podcast was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1401
01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:32.713
<v Speaker 1>I like going to Ralph's and sitting at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the olive bar and fucking getting my </v>

1402
01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:37.913
<v Speaker 1>olives while my songs playing on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio and the guys standing right next </v>

1403
01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:41.210
<v Speaker 1>to me.</v>

1404
01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:43.460
<v Speaker 1>I had no fucking idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind that at all.</v>

1405
01:01:43.461 --> 01:01:44.294
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you're not a need attention kind </v>

1406
01:01:47.151 --> 01:01:50.540
<v Speaker 1>of a guy and some people are and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of part of their business.</v>

1407
01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Like this whole Kanye Donald trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1408
01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.750
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's trolling,</v>

1409
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.823
<v Speaker 1>but I also wonder if what we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about earlier about car </v>

1410
01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:00.674
<v Speaker 1>accidents and brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's a little bit of </v>

1411
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:04.070
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also the reason I,</v>

1412
01:02:04.071 --> 01:02:04.904
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say it's trolling is because there's </v>

1413
01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:13.220
<v Speaker 1>likes and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get to car Dash Ian,</v>

1414
01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Kanye West levels of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure you know this just you have</v>

1415
01:02:16.941 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>for fucking million instagram followers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't start</v>

1416
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.900
<v Speaker 2>instagram until you told me to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that,</v>

1417
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.033
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm saying is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could monetize that shit really </v>

1418
01:02:27.421 --> 01:02:29.070
<v Speaker 2>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those 4 million people.</v>

1419
01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:30.990
<v Speaker 2>You're not that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not selling that shit out.</v>

1420
01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:33.960
<v Speaker 2>These people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are definitely monetizing that shit</v>

1421
01:02:33.961 --> 01:02:35.670
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Kim Kardashian gets on there,</v>

1422
01:02:35.850 --> 01:02:38.070
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't give you a commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she'll tell you,</v>

1423
01:02:38.071 --> 01:02:39.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm just using this new cream on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1424
01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:40.733
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it,</v>

1425
01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:43.740
<v Speaker 2>somebody paid her 100 fucking 50 grand </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that post.</v>

1426
01:02:43.741 --> 01:02:44.850
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1427
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:47.640
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so the more eyes,</v>

1428
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:49.950
<v Speaker 2>the better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really what they're monetizing as</v>

1429
01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:50.793
<v Speaker 2>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I had 10 million people on my </v>

1430
01:02:52.411 --> 01:02:54.930
<v Speaker 2>instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could sell fucking posts.</v>

1431
01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:57.180
<v Speaker 2>The real problem with that is people </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't believe them,</v>

1432
01:02:57.780 --> 01:02:58.613
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>

1433
01:02:58.710 --> 01:03:01.710
<v Speaker 2>but their eyes are still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I say I like something,</v>

1434
01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:04.040
<v Speaker 2>it's because I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if,</v>

1435
01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:04.893
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is people but cues me and have </v>

1437
01:03:08.530 --> 01:03:09.363
<v Speaker 2>I'm my instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I tell people about a product and </v>

1438
01:03:11.461 --> 01:03:12.300
<v Speaker 2>people like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>cool done in a few times,</v>

1444
01:03:19.771 --> 01:03:20.640
<v Speaker 2>but I usually say,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm not getting fucking paid.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1448
01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:30.620
<v Speaker 2>Plus I ain't got enough instagram </v>
<v Speaker 2>followers to get Jamie.</v>

1449
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:35.430
<v Speaker 2>Jamie was saying you need $70,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the number.</v>

1450
01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:36.390
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1451
01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:37.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1452
01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:39.390
<v Speaker 2>I know you don't give a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you did,</v>

1453
01:03:39.391 --> 01:03:41.460
<v Speaker 2>if you were a chick with a fake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you might be able to get a little.</v>

1454
01:03:41.790 --> 01:03:43.800
<v Speaker 2>I might have 4 million followers of.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

1457
01:03:48.751 --> 01:03:51.480
<v Speaker 2>Kim Kardashian has got $118 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>followers.</v>

1458
01:03:51.481 --> 01:03:53.630
<v Speaker 2>Just wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good googly Mowgli.</v>

1459
01:03:54.010 --> 01:03:54.661
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And let's say,</v>

1460
01:03:54.661 --> 01:03:55.750
<v Speaker 2>what did they say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>

1461
01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:56.673
<v Speaker 2>if you're actually good at social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 10 percent of your audience </v>

1462
01:03:59.431 --> 01:04:00.264
<v Speaker 2>engages you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's still 10 million people that </v>

1463
01:04:03.751 --> 01:04:07.470
<v Speaker 2>will engage with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of fun.</v>

1464
01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:10.950
<v Speaker 2>I believe I threw that number out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just cut it sounds about right.</v>

1465
01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:12.960

<v Speaker 2>Matt's famous now,</v>

1468
01:04:17.371 --> 01:04:18.990
<v Speaker 2>like when we were young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>famous was,</v>

1469
01:04:19.830 --> 01:04:20.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're on tv or the radio or you </v>

1470
01:04:24.271 --> 01:04:25.104
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies,</v>

1471
01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:28.320
<v Speaker 2>if you did something in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a book,</v>

1472
01:04:28.590 --> 01:04:30.600
<v Speaker 2>wrote a play or a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1473
01:04:30.610 --> 01:04:35.060
<v Speaker 2>You invented the plane and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>got you famous.</v>

1474
01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:38.160
<v Speaker 2>Now you just got to keep eyes on you </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing fucked up shit.</v>

1475
01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:41.840
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about that today while I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was watching gladiator because uh,</v>

1476
01:04:41.850 --> 01:04:43.750
<v Speaker 2>what I was watching that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking the,</v>

1477
01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:47.670
<v Speaker 2>in the Roman times there was no </v>
<v Speaker 2>accountability like for emperors,</v>

1478
01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:51.690
<v Speaker 2>you could do all kinds of fucked up shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>and no one could do anything about it.</v>

1479
01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:52.763
<v Speaker 2>These are the killed you eventually or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you got away with it for a long period </v>

1480
01:04:56.101 --> 01:04:58.110
<v Speaker 2>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But today,</v>

1481
01:04:58.990 --> 01:05:01.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's so much,</v>

1482
01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:06.150
<v Speaker 2>there's so much accountability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People find out what awful things you've</v>

1483
01:05:06.151 --> 01:05:09.540
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They find out you've stolen money or had</v>

1484
01:05:09.541 --> 01:05:13.690
<v Speaker 2>people killed or do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took over this or dominated that.</v>

1485
01:05:13.691 --> 01:05:18.691
<v Speaker 2>Like this to be a like to be a dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at Kim Jong Aoun like someone,</v>

1486
01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:24.490
<v Speaker 2>some along those lines today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to keep those people locked up.</v>

1487
01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's barely keeping that together.</v>

01:05:31.411 --> 01:05:34.570
<v Speaker 2>people with the Internet like sneaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>it in and you know what they did?</v>

<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

01:05:42.641 --> 01:05:45.430
<v Speaker 2>believe their leaders of God or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something of that nature.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They just don't want to die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1496
01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:49.780
<v Speaker 2>They're scared and they're hungry and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have any power.</v>

1497
01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:50.643
<v Speaker 2>They don't have any energy because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're eating just rice and fucking </v>

1498
01:05:52.571 --> 01:05:53.404
<v Speaker 2>starving to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even imagined when they catch those </v>

1499
01:05:54.761 --> 01:05:56.710
<v Speaker 2>dudes that sneak across the border,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1500
01:05:56.711 --> 01:05:57.544
<v Speaker 2>that make a run for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they get them and bring them to </v>

1501
01:05:58.960 --> 01:05:59.793
<v Speaker 2>hospitals and patch them up and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find all these crazy parasites in </v>

1502
01:06:02.951 --> 01:06:05.530
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Massive mountain nutrition and these are</v>

1503
01:06:05.531 --> 01:06:09.580
<v Speaker 2>soldiers like North Korean soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just all fucked up and this.</v>

1504
01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:10.713
<v Speaker 2>But that's a window into time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you went back into the Roman </v>

1505
01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:15.520
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1506
01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.353
<v Speaker 2>that's how everybody was rocking it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were all dominating their people </v>

1507
01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:22.270
<v Speaker 2>and use an iron fist and keep.</v>

1508
01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:26.620
<v Speaker 2>Keep these generals well fed and keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>the army well fed and use it to dominate</v>

1509
01:06:26.621 --> 01:06:29.000
<v Speaker 2>the civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uhm,</v>

1510
01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:31.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know gladiators,</v>

1511
01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:35.740
<v Speaker 2>just a movie and just fake and fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still,</v>

1512
01:06:35.741 --> 01:06:40.270
<v Speaker 2>you gotta wonder like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How close was that to life back then?</v>

1513
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:43.470
<v Speaker 2>And how bad did it smell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bad?</v>

1514
01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:47.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean like tubes have on hbo called </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rome,</v>

1515
01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.240
<v Speaker 2>like where they had and they had this </v>
<v Speaker 2>one scene,</v>

1516
01:06:49.241 --> 01:06:52.660
<v Speaker 2>I remember it like were they were all in</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a public toilet,</v>

1517
01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:53.990
<v Speaker 2>a shittery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugary,</v>

1518
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:57.430
<v Speaker 2>sugary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they had it.</v>

1519
01:06:57.431 --> 01:06:59.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what at the time was,</v>

1520
01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:00.333
<v Speaker 2>I guess the toilet paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was like calf skin rags or </v>

1521
01:07:03.761 --> 01:07:04.594
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they book and like white rats and </v>

1522
01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:08.140
<v Speaker 2>they walk out and throw it in a pile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1523
01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:11.070
<v Speaker 2>how could that have smelled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's accurate,</v>

1524
01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.760
<v Speaker 2>if that's accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1525
01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:13.693
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that lives,</v>

1526
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:15.343
<v Speaker 2>there it is Roman public toilets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they would go into like a tube and </v>

1527
01:07:19.691 --> 01:07:21.430
<v Speaker 2>that tube would go right down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>

1528
01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:22.433
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I imagine how the whole city smelled </v>

1529
01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:25.750
<v Speaker 2>like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that was one of the reasons why all</v>

1530
01:07:25.751 --> 01:07:29.170
<v Speaker 2>these people got sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when a disease would spread through</v>

1531
01:07:29.171 --> 01:07:31.120
<v Speaker 2>the city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there was no sanitation.</v>

1532
01:07:31.121 --> 01:07:33.400
<v Speaker 2>It was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

1533
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:34.263
<v Speaker 2>how did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't even have like flushable </v>

1534
01:07:35.591 --> 01:07:36.311
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1535
01:07:36.311 --> 01:07:37.144
<v Speaker 2>Nothing flushed out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had developed aqua ducks so they </v>

1536
01:07:39.941 --> 01:07:44.941
<v Speaker 2>just had a system of flowing water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it wasn't pressurized or anything,</v>

1537
01:07:45.011 --> 01:07:45.844
<v Speaker 2>so I just have to pick it up was one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that was cool about Pompei </v>

1538
01:07:49.301 --> 01:07:50.134
<v Speaker 2>was they had a sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had figured out how to boil water </v>

1539
01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:57.320
<v Speaker 2>and then they had the water would go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the floor and the walls they had</v>

1540
01:07:57.450 --> 01:07:59.560
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like double spaced walls.</v>

1541
01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:00.633
<v Speaker 2>So they had one outside wall and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside wall and the heat would go </v>

1542
01:08:03.461 --> 01:08:06.040
<v Speaker 2>through and they would go through a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sentence.</v>

1543
01:08:06.041 --> 01:08:06.874
<v Speaker 2>So you could go into the sauna and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like a regular sauna here and be </v>

1544
01:08:10.330 --> 01:08:11.990
<v Speaker 2>hot as fuck in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1545
01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.110
<v Speaker 2>they were just pump a sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1546
01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:18.620
<v Speaker 2>Like they figured out how to make things</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty cool for what they had,</v>

1547
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:19.783
<v Speaker 2>but fuck live and back there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile tell me people aren't </v>

1548
01:08:22.671 --> 01:08:24.680
<v Speaker 2>going to think like that a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 2>years from now about us.</v>

1549
01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Those dummies shitting into a ceramic </v>
<v Speaker 2>bowl and then hitting the water to flush</v>

1550
01:08:29.121 --> 01:08:30.380
<v Speaker 2>it away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Idiots.</v>

1551
01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:32.420
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine what it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

1552
01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:36.170
<v Speaker 2>Did we installed these toilets here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shoot hot water up your.</v>

1553
01:08:36.171 --> 01:08:40.310
<v Speaker 2>But you know those up or just cleaning </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to a right in the hole.</v>

1554
01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:43.040
<v Speaker 2>It shoots right in that hole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to be careful.</v>

1555
01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:43.873
<v Speaker 2>Feels like you have to take a shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he gets up in there and you're </v>

1556
01:08:45.291 --> 01:08:46.340
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh I have to shit again.</v>

1557
01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:47.503
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the water's literally getting </v>

1558
01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:52.880
<v Speaker 2>through the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it cleans your butthole so nice.</v>

1559
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:54.740
<v Speaker 2>And after you have one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1560
01:08:54.741 --> 01:08:59.741
<v Speaker 2>why would I ever use a regular toilet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>First Time I was like in the nineties.</v>

1561
01:09:00.801 --> 01:09:02.390
<v Speaker 2>In Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan.</v>

1562
01:09:02.391 --> 01:09:05.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I experienced it to me.</v>

1563
01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.000
<v Speaker 2>For me it was just a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Jamie says he holds his shit.</v>

1564
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.863
<v Speaker 2>Is that correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Preferred versus the home toilet that </v>

1565
01:09:11.151 --> 01:09:13.610
<v Speaker 2>like why would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why should it home if you'd like it make</v>

1566
01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:14.453
<v Speaker 2>sense to ship you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can keep this one in at bay for </v>

1567
01:09:16.881 --> 01:09:18.710
<v Speaker 2>me honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly.</v>

1568
01:09:18.711 --> 01:09:22.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean like in Europe a bad day is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>normal thing in our hotel room.</v>

1569
01:09:22.131 --> 01:09:24.290
<v Speaker 2>It's not here as much as not as good </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

1570
01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:25.910
<v Speaker 2>I have a bad day in my house and never </v>
<v Speaker 2>used it.</v>

1571
01:09:25.911 --> 01:09:28.790
<v Speaker 2>Once it's a magazine rack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I throw magazines there.</v>

1572
01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:33.290
<v Speaker 2>Wash your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just weird.</v>

1573
01:09:33.291 --> 01:09:34.220
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1574
01:09:34.230 --> 01:09:37.430
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't work as good as it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's more for women.</v>

1575
01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:38.443
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1576
01:09:39.250 --> 01:09:42.220
<v Speaker 2>it's a cooter cleanser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1577
01:09:42.650 --> 01:09:43.640
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's something funny.</v>

1578
01:09:43.641 --> 01:09:44.474
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just did this tour of Europe and we </v>

1579
01:09:46.731 --> 01:09:49.700
<v Speaker 2>started noticing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not going to name countries by,</v>

1580
01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:52.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I have fans and all them.</v>

1581
01:09:52.210 --> 01:09:53.043
<v Speaker 2>I don't want him to get upset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we noticed there's a different of </v>

1582
01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:56.713
<v Speaker 2>some countries you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get washcloths in your bathroom in </v>

1583
01:10:00.141 --> 01:10:03.830
<v Speaker 2>some countries you don't [inaudible] and</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and my band,</v>

1584
01:10:03.831 --> 01:10:05.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came to the conclusion that from now on,</v>

1585
01:10:05.661 --> 01:10:06.494
<v Speaker 2>whenever we come to these countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you don't get the wash cloths and </v>

1586
01:10:08.631 --> 01:10:09.464
<v Speaker 2>your hotel room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to shake hands with </v>

1587
01:10:11.181 --> 01:10:15.350
<v Speaker 2>people that didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't even wash closet in the bathroom.</v>

1588
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:16.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1589
01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:19.700
<v Speaker 2>What do you wash your hands with bro?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could wash your hands like this.</v>

<v Speaker 2>spicy food.</v>

1597
01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:40.213
<v Speaker 2>They know it's going to come out messy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they give you a goddamn garden hose </v>

<v Speaker 2>teaser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That shit's terrible for your diabetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

1656
01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:23.430
<v Speaker 2>There's like 180 grams of sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so delicious.</v>

1657
01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.890
<v Speaker 2>So delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But honestly,</v>

1658
01:13:26.891 --> 01:13:28.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like I used to drink so much coke</v>

1659
01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:31.050
<v Speaker 2>and then that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another one we talked about.</v>

1660
01:13:31.051 --> 01:13:32.610
<v Speaker 2>Weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing I got rid of,</v>

1661
01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:33.493
<v Speaker 2>man was drinking Coca Cola.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The weight falls off about 20 pounds of </v>

1662
01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:38.220
<v Speaker 2>the 35.</v>

1663
01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:40.650
<v Speaker 2>Now it just falls off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You realize like,</v>

1664
01:13:40.651 --> 01:13:41.484
<v Speaker 2>what was I doing was I doing to myself </v>
<v Speaker 2>and just a little bit of cardio and I </v>

1665
01:13:45.181 --> 01:13:47.520
<v Speaker 2>was like every other day I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1666
01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:51.120
<v Speaker 2>I just lost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1667
01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:54.380
<v Speaker 2>$35 because I dropped five pounds out on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the road that I didn't even realize it.</v>

1668
01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:56.460
<v Speaker 2>Not even worth trying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1669
01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:00.600
<v Speaker 2>Just continuing just consulting that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that food in Europe is a lot</v>

1670
01:14:00.601 --> 01:14:02.250
<v Speaker 2>cleaner just in general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1671
01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.080
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they don't have a lot of.</v>

1672
01:14:04.081 --> 01:14:05.370
<v Speaker 2>Our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1673
01:14:05.371 --> 01:14:08.370
<v Speaker 2>their wheat is like what you would call </v>
<v Speaker 2>heirloom wheat.</v>

1674
01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:09.743
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a lot of the complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>gluten's in our wheat that make it a </v>

1675
01:14:12.431 --> 01:14:14.670
<v Speaker 2>little bit more difficult to process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1676
01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:17.910
<v Speaker 2>this is all real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people think there's some sort of a</v>

1677
01:14:17.930 --> 01:14:18.763
<v Speaker 2>like that people are exaggerating the </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects of gluten and gluten </v>

1678
01:14:22.241 --> 01:14:23.074
<v Speaker 2>intolerance.</v>

1679
01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:26.770
<v Speaker 2>The issue is that at one point in time </v>
<v Speaker 2>bread was different.</v>

1680
01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.050
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was different,</v>

1681
01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:30.123
<v Speaker 2>but it was a lower yield,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so say like if you had an acre and you </v>

1682
01:14:33.401 --> 01:14:35.860
<v Speaker 2>were planting wheat on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would get way less wheat out of that</v>

1683
01:14:35.861 --> 01:14:36.694
<v Speaker 2>Acre than you would with the newer wheat</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the newer weed is just more complex </v>

1684
01:14:40.031 --> 01:14:41.920
<v Speaker 2>gluten's in it and you get a higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>yield.</v>

1685
01:14:41.921 --> 01:14:43.300
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what they're looking for </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1686
01:14:43.301 --> 01:14:45.820
<v Speaker 2>but when you eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just harder to digest.</v>

1687
01:14:45.821 --> 01:14:47.740
<v Speaker 2>And it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was in Italy,</v>

1688
01:14:47.741 --> 01:14:49.570
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody skinny.</v>

1689
01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all eating bread,</v>

1690
01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:53.950
<v Speaker 2>they're all eating pasta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all eating pizza.</v>

1691
01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:54.813
<v Speaker 2>They're all skinny at the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These dudes who don't work out at the </v>

1692
01:14:57.551 --> 01:15:00.280
<v Speaker 2>most get like a little paunch the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1693
01:15:00.281 --> 01:15:02.410
<v Speaker 2>drinking wine every night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got a little paunch.</v>

1694
01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:06.520
<v Speaker 1>They also walk a lot more than us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also ride bikes a lot more than us.</v>

1695
01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Like they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things,</v>

1696
01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:11.910
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of time in Holland this last </v>
<v Speaker 1>trip and I couldn't find a fat person to</v>

1697
01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.600
<v Speaker 1>just biking everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biking everywhere.</v>

1698
01:15:13.601 --> 01:15:15.970
<v Speaker 1>And they're eating cheese and bread all </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

1699
01:15:16.170 --> 01:15:17.003
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like literally every meal she's in </v>

1700
01:15:18.491 --> 01:15:19.324
<v Speaker 1>bread with your meal,</v>

1701
01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.193
<v Speaker 2>but they must be pissed that weed's </v>
<v Speaker 2>legal everywhere else because people </v>

1702
01:15:23.831 --> 01:15:25.600
<v Speaker 2>used to go to Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically</v>

1703
01:15:25.710 --> 01:15:28.470
<v Speaker 1>the friends that own shops over there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>

1705
01:15:28.981 --> 01:15:31.300
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on right now is there's,</v>

1706
01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I understood what he was telling me,</v>

1707
01:15:32.851 --> 01:15:33.684
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1708
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:34.583
<v Speaker 1>Canada is investing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tons of money with the government over </v>

1709
01:15:38.761 --> 01:15:43.260
<v Speaker 1>there to like corporate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like start growing corporate we'd like,</v>

1710
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:46.050
<v Speaker 1>and they're going to phase out to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>locals and take it over.</v>

1711
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:47.303
<v Speaker 1>Like they're going to phase out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee shop because there's weed isn't </v>

1712
01:15:50.311 --> 01:15:52.470
<v Speaker 1>legal in Holland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's decriminalized.</v>

1713
01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:57.390
<v Speaker 1>If you own a weed shop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can only have let's say 500 grams of</v>

1714
01:15:57.391 --> 01:15:59.930
<v Speaker 1>time in the shop legally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1715
01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.760
<v Speaker 1>If you have a good shop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're moving that,</v>

1716
01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:05.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an afternoon.</v>

1717
01:16:06.150 --> 01:16:08.010
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and getting,</v>

1718
01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:08.933
<v Speaker 1>bringing weed to your shop is illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like it's a smuggling </v>

1719
01:16:12.721 --> 01:16:15.300
<v Speaker 1>operation needs to be in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once it's in there it's okay.</v>

1720
01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Once it's in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could sell it.</v>

1721
01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:19.970
<v Speaker 1>But getting it to your spot is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking illegal to,</v>

1722
01:16:20.010 --> 01:16:23.130
<v Speaker 1>to move that much weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked up.</v>

1723
01:16:23.131 --> 01:16:23.964
<v Speaker 1>Like these guys I've know a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys I want a cup of coffee shops and </v>

1724
01:16:25.741 --> 01:16:27.150
<v Speaker 1>they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fuckery man.</v>

1725
01:16:27.151 --> 01:16:28.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a constant.</v>

1726
01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:33.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like half a criminal operation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're running and it used to be the,</v>

1727
01:16:33.021 --> 01:16:35.610
<v Speaker 1>you get mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you used to be able to get mushrooms,</v>

1728
01:16:35.611 --> 01:16:38.680
<v Speaker 1>you'd be able to get like a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and now you can't.</v>

1729
01:16:38.681 --> 01:16:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Not like hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like narcotics,</v>

1730
01:16:40.621 --> 01:16:43.440
<v Speaker 1>like coke or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anything natural like mushrooms,</v>

1731
01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:45.330
<v Speaker 1>you could get acid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was first in there,</v>

1732
01:16:45.450 --> 01:16:47.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that was legal because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was really young.</v>

1733
01:16:47.881 --> 01:16:48.714
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>

1734
01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:51.830
<v Speaker 2>Well Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a wild ass place.</v>

1735
01:16:51.831 --> 01:16:55.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is the spot where like some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the best kickboxing ever came from.</v>

1736
01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:56.953
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One little spot in Europe and they </v>

1737
01:16:58.851 --> 01:17:02.480
<v Speaker 2>created Ramon Dekkers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rob Cayman,</v>

1738
01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:03.343
<v Speaker 2>Ernesto hoost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some of the greatest kickboxers of </v>

1739
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:06.170
<v Speaker 2>all time.</v>

1740
01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere you go see them with like a</v>

1741
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:11.330
<v Speaker 2>gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

1742
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:12.223
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just amazing that this one </v>

1743
01:17:13.821 --> 01:17:18.821
<v Speaker 2>place became a hotbed for a source of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their prize kickbox footballer.</v>

1744
01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:22.820
<v Speaker 2>Kickboxing are probably the top two </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1745
01:17:23.150 --> 01:17:23.983
<v Speaker 2>I mean they literally have created some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the all time greatest kickboxers and </v>

1746
01:17:28.731 --> 01:17:31.190
<v Speaker 2>it's not a big country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

1747
01:17:31.191 --> 01:17:32.024
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of the greatest kickboxing </v>

1748
01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:34.380
<v Speaker 2>coaches as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some,</v>

1749
01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:37.220
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really unusual,</v>

1750
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:39.110
<v Speaker 2>really unusual that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened there.</v>

1751
01:17:39.130 --> 01:17:39.963
<v Speaker 2>And it's hard to describe why like no </v>
<v Speaker 2>one really to be an interesting </v>

1752
01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:46.040
<v Speaker 2>documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So figure out the roots of that.</v>

1753
01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.540
<v Speaker 2>Somebody went to Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1754
01:17:47.541 --> 01:17:48.940
<v Speaker 2>somebody brought it back from Thailand </v>
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>

1755
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:49.783
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just switched it up and put their own </v>

1756
01:17:51.021 --> 01:17:52.310
<v Speaker 2>little spin on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1757
01:17:52.311 --> 01:17:53.144
<v Speaker 2>And a few guys went over to Thailand </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck some ties up to because what they </v>

1758
01:17:56.031 --> 01:17:58.520
<v Speaker 2>had done is they incorporated a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>western boxing,</v>

1759
01:17:58.790 --> 01:18:01.670
<v Speaker 2>like Ramon dekkers in particular was one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the greats.</v>

1760
01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:05.180
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he did was he was a small guy,</v>

1761
01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:06.014
<v Speaker 2>like the same size as the ties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was unusual because a lot of the </v>

1762
01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:09.793
<v Speaker 2>people from Amsterdam or big people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those places where I think </v>

1763
01:18:12.561 --> 01:18:16.430
<v Speaker 2>the average height for a person who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like six feet tall.</v>

1764
01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:17.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's an unusually tall place as shit </v>

1765
01:18:21.921 --> 01:18:24.800
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some fucking Viking DNA.</v>

1766
01:18:25.370 --> 01:18:27.350
<v Speaker 2>I was watching that show for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vikings.</v>

1767
01:18:27.351 --> 01:18:29.450
<v Speaker 2>I got deep into that show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that show it was pretty dark.</v>

1768
01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:33.560
<v Speaker 2>But Mrs Reagan got tired of seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>people get sorted up slashed to pieces.</v>

1769
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:36.440
<v Speaker 2>She got bored with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty dark.</v>

1770
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:40.640
<v Speaker 2>People would just get fucked up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrows cut open and it's the whole show.</v>

1771
01:18:40.641 --> 01:18:44.540
<v Speaker 2>They're always going to war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they did their viking.</v>

1772
01:18:44.541 --> 01:18:45.374
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they took a lot of mushrooms to </v>

1773
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:50.900
<v Speaker 2>pillage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe is viking a way of life.</v>

1774
01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:53.690
<v Speaker 2>If you could go back in one time to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1775
01:18:53.691 --> 01:18:57.620
<v Speaker 2>if you had like a time machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back and watch one time in history,</v>

1776
01:18:57.930 --> 01:19:01.180
<v Speaker 2>what do you think you would go to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>him go to see?</v>

1777
01:19:01.181 --> 01:19:06.181
<v Speaker 2>Like how people lived well at being very</v>
<v Speaker 2>smell sensitive.</v>

1778
01:19:06.970 --> 01:19:10.100
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be that far back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably want to go.</v>

1779
01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:12.830
<v Speaker 2>I know that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably like,</v>

1780
01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>King Arthur era.</v>

1781
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:16.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that kind of thing.</v>

1782
01:19:16.131 --> 01:19:19.740
<v Speaker 2>I was heavy dungeons and dragons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe go,</v>

1783
01:19:20.050 --> 01:19:20.883
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go see if there's anything to add of </v>

1784
01:19:22.121 --> 01:19:23.720
<v Speaker 2>that dragon shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1785
01:19:23.721 --> 01:19:24.620
<v Speaker 2>the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the grail,</v>

1786
01:19:24.621 --> 01:19:27.410
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any of that drag shit.</v>

1787
01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:32.940
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what that was all based on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why there's so many dragons in folk</v>

1788
01:19:32.941 --> 01:19:33.774
<v Speaker 2>lore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Chinese folklore and European </v>

1789
01:19:36.141 --> 01:19:40.160
<v Speaker 2>folklore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many unrelated dragons.</v>

1790
01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:41.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1791
01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:43.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people that have been,</v>

1792
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.903
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've watched a lot of ancient aliens so </v>

1793
01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.440
<v Speaker 2>that they'll always have an explanation.</v>

1794
01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.640
<v Speaker 2>My man with the hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

1795
01:19:49.690 --> 01:19:50.610
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sucralose.</v>

1796
01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:54.920

1799
01:19:59.510 --> 01:20:01.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily agree with </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1800
01:20:01.311 --> 01:20:02.990
<v Speaker 2>They say no to everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's.</v>

1801
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:04.850
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's merit to some of it,</v>

1802
01:20:04.851 --> 01:20:05.684
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a show you watch with your </v>

1803
01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:07.853
<v Speaker 2>boys at like 1:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning and you get baked and </v>

<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>

1809
01:20:30.090 --> 01:20:32.910
<v Speaker 2>during the podcast.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He really knows about food and really </v>

1836
01:21:24.061 --> 01:21:24.900
<v Speaker 2>understands food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1837
01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:25.913
<v Speaker 2>I think he should have a cooking show he</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually know can whip up some fucking </v>

1838
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:30.560
<v Speaker 2>mean food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1839
01:21:30.570 --> 01:21:34.560
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we like now that Bourdain's gone,</v>

1840
01:21:34.770 --> 01:21:39.280
<v Speaker 2>like we'd need more of those kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows that explore food and bordain show</v>

1841
01:21:39.281 --> 01:21:40.114
<v Speaker 2>changed the way I feel about food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to think of food is just </v>

1842
01:21:43.051 --> 01:21:43.884
<v Speaker 2>something that tastes really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think of it as an art form and </v>

1843
01:21:46.521 --> 01:21:51.300
<v Speaker 2>then I watched his show and the reverend</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had for chefs and for the creation of</v>

1844
01:21:51.301 --> 01:21:52.950
<v Speaker 2>food and made me realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1845
01:21:52.951 --> 01:21:55.920
<v Speaker 2>this is an art form that I was ignorant </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

1846
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:58.590
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think of it the right way on </v>
<v Speaker 2>all levels.</v>

1847
01:21:58.591 --> 01:21:59.424
<v Speaker 2>Not just like the high chef level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he brings it to the home front where </v>

1848
01:22:02.191 --> 01:22:06.100
<v Speaker 2>it's like even as local,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's eat,</v>

1849
01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.000
<v Speaker 2>Cook and some sandwiches.</v>

1850
01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.260
<v Speaker 2>Making sandwiches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1851
01:22:10.410 --> 01:22:12.990
<v Speaker 2>you're right man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like street food level.</v>

1852
01:22:12.991 --> 01:22:16.590
<v Speaker 2>He loves Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loved Street Tacos and Shit.</v>

1853
01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:18.210
<v Speaker 2>He would go everywhere and by street </v>
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>

1854
01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:21.480
<v Speaker 2>Me Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're cooking,</v>

1855
01:22:21.481 --> 01:22:22.890
<v Speaker 2>you feel like that though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

1856
01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:25.020
<v Speaker 2>You just now I see you cooking all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1857
01:22:25.021 --> 01:22:25.854
<v Speaker 2>Whenever you're posting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This should never invite me over to </v>

1858
01:22:27.210 --> 01:22:30.420
<v Speaker 2>somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to set it up here.</v>

1859
01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:31.613
<v Speaker 2>I was going to set a thing up here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they never figured out how to get </v>

1860
01:22:33.721 --> 01:22:34.554
<v Speaker 2>ventilation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we have a grill back there that's </v>

1861
01:22:35.761 --> 01:22:36.594
<v Speaker 2>never been used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just sitting back there looking at </v>

1862
01:22:38.581 --> 01:22:39.414
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's taken a stake to be nice and pink </v>

1863
01:22:42.781 --> 01:22:47.190
<v Speaker 2>in the middle and gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's drinking wine.</v>

1864
01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:48.180
<v Speaker 2>I wonder why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See?</v>

1865
01:22:48.181 --> 01:22:49.014
<v Speaker 2>This is how.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How stony his show is like they let him </v>

1866
01:22:51.481 --> 01:22:56.481
<v Speaker 2>wear a shirt that you can't wear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they had a blur out his shirt thing.</v>

1867
01:22:57.860 --> 01:22:58.651
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay man.</v>

1868
01:22:58.651 --> 01:22:59.690
<v Speaker 2>You can't wear that shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All.</v>

1869
01:22:59.750 --> 01:23:00.840
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it all.</v>

1870
01:23:00.850 --> 01:23:02.640
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what I'm wearing.</v>

1871
01:23:02.641 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 2>So do what you gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1872
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:09.430
<v Speaker 1>So they got to follow him around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That blur thing drives me nuts.</v>

1873
01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could it possibly be that.</v>

1874
01:23:11.981 --> 01:23:12.920
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1875
01:23:13.150 --> 01:23:15.670
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's times when I see cyclists back.</v>

1876
01:23:15.850 --> 01:23:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back when he had that loser video,</v>

1877
01:23:18.190 --> 01:23:21.940
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that comes up when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>video is him in a mask that's blurred.</v>

1878
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:23.743
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1881
01:23:28.751 --> 01:23:31.840

<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's a fascinating guy to,</v>

1886
01:23:41.250 --> 01:23:43.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a devout scientologist.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You don't hear about him that often.</v>

1896
01:24:03.130 --> 01:24:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another thing,</v>

1897
01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:06.240
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the same kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1898
01:24:06.450 --> 01:24:08.800
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not playing the game.</v>

1899
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:10.183
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's just an artist.</v>

1901
01:24:11.621 --> 01:24:13.450
<v Speaker 1>When it's time to make music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's music.</v>

1902
01:24:13.570 --> 01:24:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's still.</v>

1903
01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:16.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>

1904
01:24:16.961 --> 01:24:17.794
<v Speaker 1>it's for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

1905
01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:19.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1906
01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:20.171
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1907
01:24:20.171 --> 01:24:21.670
<v Speaker 1>this is a product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this record.</v>

1908
01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not a product.</v>

1909
01:24:22.841 --> 01:24:24.940
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I did eight years of my life,</v>

1910
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:27.970
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't make it because I was concerned</v>

1911
01:24:27.971 --> 01:24:29.560
<v Speaker 1>about keeping my otherwise that's why </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy,</v>

1912
01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:31.900
<v Speaker 1>because they got to put a record out </v>
<v Speaker 1>every year.</v>

1913
01:24:32.290 --> 01:24:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Those are the guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1914
01:24:33.281 --> 01:24:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you fucking.</v>

1915
01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:36.400
<v Speaker 1>That's all us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1916
01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:40.740
<v Speaker 1>that takes a lot to put a fucking room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's going to be good.</v>

1917
01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:42.820
<v Speaker 1>So anybody that can put out a record </v>
<v Speaker 1>every year,</v>

1918
01:24:42.821 --> 01:24:45.340
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's next level.</v>

1919
01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:46.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Louis Ck was doing that for awhile </v>

1920
01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:49.481
<v Speaker 1>at standup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1921
01:24:49.481 --> 01:24:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is hard to do.</v>

1922
01:24:51.341 --> 01:24:52.174
<v Speaker 1>George Carlin did it every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Carlin did a standup special </v>

1923
01:24:54.971 --> 01:24:57.820
<v Speaker 1>every year and to us to to all stand up </v>
<v Speaker 1>comics.</v>

1924
01:24:57.821 --> 01:24:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Will we all get together and talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1925
01:24:59.351 --> 01:25:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Everybody kind of agrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost impossible.</v>

1926
01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:02.763
<v Speaker 1>He did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very few people could do it and not </v>

1927
01:25:07.031 --> 01:25:10.210
<v Speaker 1>to criticize Carlin because Carlin and </v>
<v Speaker 1>did it and pulled it off,</v>

1928
01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:14.200
<v Speaker 1>but most of us feel like that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough time.</v>

1929
01:25:14.410 --> 01:25:15.243
<v Speaker 1>Like you need more time to let it cook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Need more time to add twists to never </v>

1930
01:25:20.170 --> 01:25:21.003
<v Speaker 1>had a record come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think the shortest period would </v>

1931
01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:24.303
<v Speaker 1>be two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two and a half years and that's you </v>

1932
01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:28.720
<v Speaker 1>probably just constantly going at it.</v>

1933
01:25:29.070 --> 01:25:29.903
<v Speaker 1>Anytime I wasn't touring or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we locked in a room somewhere and </v>

1934
01:25:32.321 --> 01:25:34.900
<v Speaker 1>trying to make music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you record,</v>

1935
01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:37.450
<v Speaker 1>when you will like say if you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to lay down an album,</v>

1936
01:25:37.451 --> 01:25:38.284
<v Speaker 1>do you have everything completely mapped</v>
<v Speaker 1>out before you go into the studio or do </v>

1937
01:25:41.501 --> 01:25:43.270
<v Speaker 1>you fuck around with it while you're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

1938
01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Will the process for this album in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

1939
01:25:46.481 --> 01:25:51.481
<v Speaker 1>which was wild because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when layla was born and the disease we,</v>

1940
01:25:52.861 --> 01:25:53.261
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1941
01:25:53.261 --> 01:25:55.780
<v Speaker 1>we found out she was diagnosed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>cystic fibrosis.</v>

1942
01:25:56.410 --> 01:26:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I actually was planning to not tour any </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that anymore,</v>

1943
01:26:00.341 --> 01:26:02.680
<v Speaker 1>but I was going to write songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was gonna go to.</v>

1944
01:26:02.681 --> 01:26:03.514
<v Speaker 1>I went to Nashville,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started hanging out with a few </v>

1945
01:26:05.361 --> 01:26:06.920
<v Speaker 1>songwriters out there and wrote some </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1946
01:26:06.921 --> 01:26:08.000
<v Speaker 1>One of the songs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it ain't easy,</v>

1947
01:26:08.001 --> 01:26:11.240
<v Speaker 1>which I played years ago on your podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>is on this album.</v>

1948
01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1949
01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:16.190
<v Speaker 1>so I wrote some songs with people but </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1950
01:26:16.191 --> 01:26:18.290
<v Speaker 1>the intention was they were going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>for other people.</v>

1951
01:26:18.710 --> 01:26:22.370
<v Speaker 1>So I recorded them in a very kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>plain Jane Way.</v>

1952
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:26.540
<v Speaker 1>Not My spin on what they would have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>an after a few years.</v>

1953
01:26:26.590 --> 01:26:31.590
<v Speaker 1>I just never really pursued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too much of a sales pitch I had,</v>

1954
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:32.743
<v Speaker 1>would have had you have to go out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like be that smooth or selling your </v>

1955
01:26:34.401 --> 01:26:39.401
<v Speaker 1>songs and it just never appealed to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so after a few years I,</v>

1956
01:26:40.101 --> 01:26:40.934
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did an acoustic record and then I </v>

1957
01:26:43.641 --> 01:26:45.590
<v Speaker 1>started touring that for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just old songs,</v>

1958
01:26:45.591 --> 01:26:48.560
<v Speaker 1>but I recorded them acoustically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1959
01:26:50.690 --> 01:26:51.523
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1960
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:53.630
<v Speaker 1>after that was done and I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1961
01:26:53.690 --> 01:26:55.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to keep working,</v>

1962
01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:57.253
<v Speaker 1>what am I gonna do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went back and revisited some of these </v>

1963
01:26:58.431 --> 01:27:00.410
<v Speaker 1>songs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I realized after we record them,</v>

1964
01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:04.430
<v Speaker 1>that's why I didn't see that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>my songs because I recorded the demo way</v>

1965
01:27:04.431 --> 01:27:06.170
<v Speaker 1>that I thought other people would want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to use them.</v>

1966
01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:09.090
<v Speaker 1>So I went and rerecorded about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

1967
01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:11.120
<v Speaker 1>five or six of the songs that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>already here.</v>

1968
01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:14.410
<v Speaker 1>And then my buddy evidence from dilated </v>
<v Speaker 1>peoples,</v>

1969
01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:15.773
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got involved with me and we recorded a </v>

1970
01:27:16.791 --> 01:27:17.624
<v Speaker 1>few of these rap tracks and it started </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of coming together and it kind of </v>

1971
01:27:19.521 --> 01:27:20.354
<v Speaker 1>started coming together in a similar way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the original Whitey Ford sings the </v>

1972
01:27:22.461 --> 01:27:23.294
<v Speaker 1>blues record it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I kind of also named it what </v>

1973
01:27:25.401 --> 01:27:26.780
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1974
01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:27.873
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of similarities and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like I just pulled everything from </v>

1975
01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:33.713
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every part of the tool box that I've </v>

1976
01:27:34.671 --> 01:27:36.890
<v Speaker 1>learned from since I started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1977
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:37.783
<v Speaker 1>what it was the ice tea years or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>house of pain years or the Whitey Ford </v>

1978
01:27:40.641 --> 01:27:41.474
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just drew on it all and trying to see </v>

1979
01:27:43.821 --> 01:27:44.654
<v Speaker 1>what you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said it was the eight years of </v>

1980
01:27:45.501 --> 01:27:46.334
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a literal representation </v>

1981
01:27:49.461 --> 01:27:50.294
<v Speaker 1>of what's happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an emotional journey of like </v>

1982
01:27:52.461 --> 01:27:53.294
<v Speaker 1>all the kinds of feelings and shit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I like a lot of struggles and a lot of </v>

1983
01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:56.721
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1984
01:27:56.721 --> 01:27:58.280
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's my best record,</v>

1985
01:27:58.430 --> 01:28:00.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eight years right here.</v>

1986
01:28:00.170 --> 01:28:03.500
<v Speaker 1>So I've never been in no rush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big statement,</v>

1987
01:28:03.501 --> 01:28:05.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's your best record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my best record ever.</v>

1988
01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm confident in it.</v>

1989
01:28:07.210 --> 01:28:08.390
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it available everywhere?</v>

1990
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:12.610
<v Speaker 1>Like the shit out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I own my masters.</v>

1991
01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:14.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does that work?</v>

1992
01:28:15.550 --> 01:28:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you get more extreme?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1993
01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:20.180
<v Speaker 1>if you own your masters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get paid outright.</v>

1994
01:28:20.181 --> 01:28:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the label on my own label.</v>

1995
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:26.420
<v Speaker 1>So the people that complain about not </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting paid by streaming or people that</v>

1996
01:28:26.421 --> 01:28:27.254
<v Speaker 1>are signed to record deals that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting a small piece of what the </v>

1997
01:28:30.681 --> 01:28:33.800
<v Speaker 1>masters getting a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you own the master,</v>

1998
01:28:34.420 --> 01:28:35.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so streaming is viable for someone who </v>

1999
01:28:37.971 --> 01:28:40.520
<v Speaker 1>owns the map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's viable period.</v>

2000
01:28:40.521 --> 01:28:41.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids know what I mean.</v>

2001
01:28:41.661 --> 01:28:42.980
<v Speaker 1>That's the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the,</v>

2002
01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:44.870
<v Speaker 1>it's the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean now.</v>

2003
01:28:45.170 --> 01:28:48.350
<v Speaker 1>But the people who say it doesn't pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>their in shitty deals,</v>

2004
01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:49.260
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2005
01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it pays.</v>

2006
01:28:50.210 --> 01:28:52.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like it to pay a little better.</v>

2007
01:28:52.281 --> 01:28:53.180
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he pays.</v>

2008
01:28:53.181 --> 01:28:53.900
<v Speaker 1>He pays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2009
01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Who Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you take a million streams it</v>

2010
01:28:57.261 --> 01:29:02.261
<v Speaker 1>equals out to around $8,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like it just in general,</v>

2011
01:29:02.401 --> 01:29:05.070
<v Speaker 1>like that's the payment from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for what that is to have to a label,</v>

2012
01:29:05.071 --> 01:29:07.970
<v Speaker 1>like it would be around a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>streams.</v>

2013
01:29:07.971 --> 01:29:09.690
<v Speaker 1>This is about the equivalent of about </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight grand.</v>

2014
01:29:10.290 --> 01:29:11.850
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't sound like a lot,</v>

2015
01:29:11.851 --> 01:29:13.200
<v Speaker 1>but a million streams is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2016
01:29:13.201 --> 01:29:16.620
<v Speaker 1>a thousand guys that or people fans of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yours that stream you're shit,</v>

2017
01:29:16.650 --> 01:29:18.360
<v Speaker 1>whatever thousand times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 times,</v>

2018
01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:19.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

2019
01:29:19.441 --> 01:29:20.274
<v Speaker 1>it goes quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think drake like streamed a </v>

2020
01:29:22.410 --> 01:29:24.600
<v Speaker 1>billion streams as first week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2021
01:29:24.810 --> 01:29:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Know that's a nice chunk of change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2022
01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:30.000
<v Speaker 1>David crosby was tweeting about how bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>streaming deals are,</v>

2023
01:29:30.450 --> 01:29:33.810
<v Speaker 1>but that is because he has a bad deal as</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't know what his master.</v>

2024
01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

2025
01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:36.780
<v Speaker 1>if he's recording a deal for another </v>
<v Speaker 1>record,</v>

2026
01:29:36.810 --> 01:29:38.280
<v Speaker 1>for the record company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2027
01:29:38.710 --> 01:29:40.570
<v Speaker 1>And he's all his older songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2028
01:29:40.571 --> 01:29:41.220
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2029
01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Then he's probably got shit deals on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean some of my older stuff,</v>

2030
01:29:43.951 --> 01:29:45.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't get paid on what I feel like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>should,</v>

2031
01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:48.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's like the stuff since I've owned</v>
<v Speaker 1>my masters,</v>

2032
01:29:48.181 --> 01:29:50.700
<v Speaker 1>which is the last 15 years of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2033
01:29:51.090 --> 01:29:51.923
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating for me on the outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at what happens with labels and </v>

2034
01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:56.720
<v Speaker 1>how they do things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2035
01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:58.470
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

2036
01:29:58.471 --> 01:29:59.304
<v Speaker 1>They're sort of survival instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How they figured out how to labels or </v>

2037
01:30:02.461 --> 01:30:06.720
<v Speaker 1>signing casters now because of streaming</v>
<v Speaker 1>streaming.</v>

2038
01:30:07.170 --> 01:30:09.760
<v Speaker 1>You should be getting checks from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

2039
01:30:09.810 --> 01:30:11.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't allow them to stream me.</v>

2040
01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:14.940
<v Speaker 1>But honestly you could come in door a </v>
<v Speaker 1>spotify.</v>

2041
01:30:14.941 --> 01:30:17.250
<v Speaker 1>I say nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you'd probably have to be exclusive</v>

2042
01:30:17.251 --> 01:30:22.170
<v Speaker 1>to one of them is the deal to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well either way what they are is just,</v>

2043
01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.640
<v Speaker 1>it's not just streaming digital.</v>

2044
01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Your Youtube views are streaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's streaming doesn't have to be with</v>

2045
01:30:27.451 --> 01:30:28.490
<v Speaker 1>a streaming service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2046
01:30:28.770 --> 01:30:29.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

2047
01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:32.370
<v Speaker 1>you should have a digital company that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is representing you,</v>

2048
01:30:32.371 --> 01:30:35.260
<v Speaker 1>that's collecting all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know,</v>

2049
01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:37.410
<v Speaker 1>I just make sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2050
01:30:37.411 --> 01:30:39.530
<v Speaker 1>But that's like streaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2051
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:40.423
<v Speaker 1>you know what the youtube thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most fascinating thing about it is </v>

2052
01:30:41.970 --> 01:30:44.460
<v Speaker 1>it's only youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the crazy thing.</v>

2053
01:30:44.461 --> 01:30:45.294
<v Speaker 1>We think about how big the Internet is </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's really only one thing like </v>

2054
01:30:48.091 --> 01:30:49.080
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

2055
01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:49.973
<v Speaker 1>it was a good moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They came and the branding and </v>

2056
01:30:52.350 --> 01:30:54.050
<v Speaker 1>everything they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw like,</v>

2057
01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:56.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was a documentary </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it wasn't full length,</v>

2058
01:30:56.911 --> 01:30:58.710
<v Speaker 1>but it might've been just like a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>like feature,</v>

2059
01:30:58.711 --> 01:31:01.650
<v Speaker 1>like within a news kind of segment thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how the,</v>

2060
01:31:01.651 --> 01:31:04.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the original videos that were huge on,</v>

2061
01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:07.310
<v Speaker 1>on youtube or like a kid biting another </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>

2062
01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:09.630
<v Speaker 1>And like the original first for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>longest time,</v>

2063
01:31:09.631 --> 01:31:13.290
<v Speaker 1>the most played video on youtube was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>charlie biting the kid or something,</v>

2064
01:31:13.291 --> 01:31:15.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where it all came from.</v>

2065
01:31:15.361 --> 01:31:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Like it almost came from America's home </v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

2066
01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:19.613
<v Speaker 1>like funniest home video kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube kind of filled in that void for </v>

2067
01:31:22.561 --> 01:31:25.140
<v Speaker 1>a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were memes before there were memes.</v>

2068
01:31:25.141 --> 01:31:26.720
<v Speaker 1>They were just viral videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2069
01:31:27.250 --> 01:31:28.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so long ago.</v>

2070
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:31.530
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a decade ago and that,</v>

2071
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:35.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the necessity of having to change</v>

2072
01:31:35.041 --> 01:31:37.110
<v Speaker 1>the music business is what changed </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>

2073
01:31:37.111 --> 01:31:37.944
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they caught on like ritv knows </v>

2074
01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:42.360
<v Speaker 1>and play videos anymore and nobody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>buying records.</v>

2075
01:31:42.361 --> 01:31:43.910
<v Speaker 1>So we got to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

2076
01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:45.730
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing for the longest was like</v>

2077
01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:46.613
<v Speaker 1>when the bottom had really fallen out </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a while of making any money off of </v>

2078
01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:50.753
<v Speaker 1>actual records was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you can pull my record and you can </v>

2079
01:31:53.281 --> 01:31:54.114
<v Speaker 1>download my record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't download the tee shirt </v>

2080
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.760
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2081
01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:57.593
<v Speaker 1>So it became sell the lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the music became background music to </v>

2082
01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:02.623
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was part of the lifestyle and the </v>

2083
01:32:03.821 --> 01:32:07.330
<v Speaker 1>cars and this and all I wanted you to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really go by this limited edition tee</v>

2084
01:32:07.331 --> 01:32:09.250
<v Speaker 1>shirt that I'm sending you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2085
01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:12.880
<v Speaker 1>That's what that's the game changed into</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's still that.</v>

2086
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:14.980
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why the fuck are you in the troll</v>

2087
01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:17.230
<v Speaker 1>ism and all that because people want </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes on them.</v>

2088
01:32:17.231 --> 01:32:19.630
<v Speaker 1>So the next thing they have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to sell,</v>

2089
01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:21.430
<v Speaker 1>they can sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2090
01:32:21.431 --> 01:32:22.264
<v Speaker 1>That's what's interesting to me about </v>
<v Speaker 1>labels is now labels get a piece of </v>

2091
01:32:24.881 --> 01:32:26.740
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do these three 60 deals.</v>

2092
01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Don't say Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was unheard of.</v>

2093
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:33.910
<v Speaker 1>You didn't get that many tee shirts or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get piece of it.</v>

2094
01:32:33.911 --> 01:32:35.980
<v Speaker 1>They get pieces of live money because </v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

2095
01:32:35.981 --> 01:32:36.814
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like how cool it used to be like I </v>

2096
01:32:39.071 --> 01:32:39.880
<v Speaker 1>had to pay you.</v>

2097
01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:41.170
<v Speaker 1>I used to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>

2098
01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:43.570
<v Speaker 1>a record label would give me half a </v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars.</v>

2099
01:32:43.810 --> 01:32:46.240
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd go and make a record with that.</v>

2100
01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:48.600
<v Speaker 1>I'd have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could spend whatever I want and making</v>

2101
01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:50.920
<v Speaker 1>a record and whatever the rest of money </v>
<v Speaker 1>leftover was mine.</v>

2102
01:32:50.921 --> 01:32:51.754
<v Speaker 1>That 500 grand was mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spend it all making the record or I </v>

2103
01:32:53.381 --> 01:32:56.330
<v Speaker 1>could spend 50 grand making a record and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pocket the rest.</v>

2104
01:32:56.331 --> 01:32:58.170
<v Speaker 1>That was up to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2105
01:32:58.930 --> 01:33:00.220
<v Speaker 1>and then after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my job,</v>

2106
01:33:00.221 --> 01:33:02.040
<v Speaker 1>your job as a label is to sell that </v>
<v Speaker 1>record.</v>

2107
01:33:02.050 --> 01:33:02.883
<v Speaker 1>My job was to hit the road and go tour </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I go to her for a few years and at </v>

2108
01:33:06.131 --> 01:33:06.964
<v Speaker 1>first I'm not even making money touring </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're giving me money to go out </v>

2109
01:33:09.311 --> 01:33:10.840
<v Speaker 1>there and tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called tour support.</v>

2110
01:33:10.841 --> 01:33:11.674
<v Speaker 1>That used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that actually gets added onto your </v>

2111
01:33:13.721 --> 01:33:15.370
<v Speaker 1>bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't get paid?</v>

2112
01:33:15.810 --> 01:33:16.030
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2113
01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:16.863
<v Speaker 1>You would get like money for tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like it wouldn't cover like a bus </v>

2114
01:33:19.481 --> 01:33:20.314
<v Speaker 1>and abandon all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that the label would supplement that </v>

2115
01:33:22.571 --> 01:33:23.404
<v Speaker 1>with what they called tour support,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would also become part of the </v>

2116
01:33:25.841 --> 01:33:27.010
<v Speaker 1>debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You owe the label,</v>

2117
01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:28.353
<v Speaker 1>but as you built your live audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your guarantees would go up sooner or </v>

2118
01:33:32.531 --> 01:33:33.364
<v Speaker 1>later you can stop taking that money and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your record sales would pay that </v>

2119
01:33:37.841 --> 01:33:38.674
<v Speaker 1>off hopefully if you were doing well </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough and now you've got your own </v>

2120
01:33:40.811 --> 01:33:45.150
<v Speaker 1>stream of revenue with live t shirts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this other outside shit that yours.</v>

2121
01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:49.450
<v Speaker 1>That's the way it was when I came up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's like that's not a deal.</v>

2122
01:33:49.730 --> 01:33:50.563
<v Speaker 1>They want it how they sneak that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when napster and shit drop the </v>

2123
01:33:54.551 --> 01:33:57.190
<v Speaker 1>bottom out of the record business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody was paying for records.</v>

2124
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:58.263
<v Speaker 1>Labels weren't going to give you a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>a million dollars just for your record </v>

2125
01:34:01.181 --> 01:34:02.740
<v Speaker 1>because nobody was buying records.</v>

2126
01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:05.440
<v Speaker 1>They want to sell your tee shirts to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that amazing?</v>

2127
01:34:05.441 --> 01:34:06.274
<v Speaker 1>Note they figured out how to stay alive </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that just because they always knew </v>

2128
01:34:08.831 --> 01:34:10.890
<v Speaker 1>that people are going to be needy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It always it.</v>

2129
01:34:11.050 --> 01:34:11.883
<v Speaker 1>It all boils down to this too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I host somebody one day like really </v>

2130
01:34:14.231 --> 01:34:18.340
<v Speaker 1>investigates this and make some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary about it is like they had so</v>

2131
01:34:18.341 --> 01:34:20.650
<v Speaker 1>many opportunities to be ahead of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie industry,</v>

2132
01:34:20.651 --> 01:34:21.484
<v Speaker 1>didn't take the same hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took hits and they deal dealt with </v>

2133
01:34:23.981 --> 01:34:24.814
<v Speaker 1>piracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

2134
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:27.880
<v Speaker 1>the music industry had a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you remember,</v>

2135
01:34:27.881 --> 01:34:28.714
<v Speaker 1>there was like some kids that got in </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble for downloading ridiculous </v>

2136
01:34:31.211 --> 01:34:32.044
<v Speaker 1>amounts of music and their parents were </v>
<v Speaker 1>being held responsible and the music </v>

2137
01:34:34.901 --> 01:34:38.680
<v Speaker 1>industry backed off of it because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>news wasn't good.</v>

2138
01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:41.500
<v Speaker 1>The movie industry never backed off of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of shit.</v>

2139
01:34:41.501 --> 01:34:42.334
<v Speaker 1>They've told you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to fucking sue your life </v>

2140
01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:44.250
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

2141
01:34:44.250 --> 01:34:45.083
<v Speaker 1>People did get sued for your music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the music industry backed off </v>

2142
01:34:47.771 --> 01:34:48.604
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't put the pedal down and keep </v>

2143
01:34:49.841 --> 01:34:51.880
<v Speaker 1>the foot on the neck like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to steal this.</v>

2144
01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:54.190
<v Speaker 1>This costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to remember back then,</v>

2145
01:34:54.191 --> 01:34:55.600
<v Speaker 1>if I were to got a half a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>

2146
01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:57.950
<v Speaker 1>I probably would have spent up to to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that on a record,</v>

2147
01:34:58.190 --> 01:35:02.210
<v Speaker 1>$200,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>just on them making studio time.</v>

2148
01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Whoever's got to be involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineers,</v>

2149
01:35:04.431 --> 01:35:06.980
<v Speaker 1>producers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 grand off top,</v>

2150
01:35:06.981 --> 01:35:09.960
<v Speaker 1>just minimum we would have spent on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>record and then it gets.</v>

2151
01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:11.580
<v Speaker 1>You go out and people steal it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2152
01:35:11.690 --> 01:35:12.500
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same,</v>

2153
01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:15.770
<v Speaker 1>you know we're going with do you ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>download shit for free?</v>

2154
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:20.750
<v Speaker 1>My thing we not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At first my thing became later like,</v>

2155
01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:22.100
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what,</v>

2156
01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:23.390
<v Speaker 1>this is the wave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2157
01:35:23.690 --> 01:35:24.523
<v Speaker 1>But if I adapt my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My philosophy was if I downloaded your </v>

2158
01:35:26.691 --> 01:35:28.610
<v Speaker 1>shit and light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked it.</v>

2159
01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:30.510
<v Speaker 1>I would go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd go buy it.</v>

2160
01:35:30.850 --> 01:35:31.683
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

2161
01:35:31.730 --> 01:35:33.630
<v Speaker 1>if I downloaded it and it was trashed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and vague,</v>

2162
01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:36.630
<v Speaker 1>I looked at it as like a taste test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

2163
01:35:36.850 --> 01:35:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if more people adapted that things</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have.</v>

2164
01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:40.273
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the record industry had plenty of </v>

2165
01:35:41.541 --> 01:35:43.800
<v Speaker 1>opportunities to jump ahead of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And B,</v>

2166
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:44.743
<v Speaker 1>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was technology out there already </v>

2167
01:35:45.771 --> 01:35:48.410
<v Speaker 1>that people were dealing with bringing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it so that I'm telling him and this wave</v>

2168
01:35:48.411 --> 01:35:50.600
<v Speaker 1>is coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the recommendation was making so</v>

2169
01:35:50.601 --> 01:35:51.434
<v Speaker 1>much money at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the amount of money they </v>

2170
01:35:52.881 --> 01:35:53.714
<v Speaker 1>were making off of the boy bands and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brittany Spears is enough that it was </v>

2171
01:35:56.571 --> 01:35:57.404
<v Speaker 1>retarded how much money was in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>record business and they let it all go </v>

2172
01:36:00.081 --> 01:36:00.914
<v Speaker 1>down the drain because they thought they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had all the answers and they thought it </v>

2173
01:36:03.171 --> 01:36:04.040
<v Speaker 1>had no money.</v>

2174
01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:06.870
<v Speaker 1>What could they have done to stop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to go back.</v>

2175
01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:07.733
<v Speaker 1>I have some books on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was taking out a lot street </v>

2176
01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:11.093
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were people ready there to help </v>

2177
01:36:12.021 --> 01:36:15.120
<v Speaker 1>set up things like master and how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>monetize it and control it.</v>

2178
01:36:15.121 --> 01:36:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Like there was ways to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were ways to be part of it instead</v>

2179
01:36:19.941 --> 01:36:20.774
<v Speaker 1>of like wait till it was too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will think about the movie industry too </v>

2180
01:36:23.201 --> 01:36:25.940
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that people want to go to the movies.</v>

2181
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:30.230
<v Speaker 1>Like the experience is not as good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apple Music saves the music industry.</v>

2182
01:36:30.650 --> 01:36:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Like apple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If first items,</v>

2183
01:36:32.150 --> 01:36:34.640
<v Speaker 1>why didn't the recognition like there </v>
<v Speaker 1>were people telling them,</v>

2184
01:36:34.641 --> 01:36:36.350
<v Speaker 1>this is coming and I didn't mean to </v>
<v Speaker 1>interrupt you,</v>

2185
01:36:36.351 --> 01:36:39.500
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they could have made </v>
<v Speaker 1>the itunes first,</v>

2186
01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:40.453
<v Speaker 1>not called Itunes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like the industry itself should </v>

2187
01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:45.330
<v Speaker 1>digitize and been ready,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2188
01:36:45.390 --> 01:36:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Would have been that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come up with their own version of itunes</v>

2189
01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:52.670
<v Speaker 1>and they could have invested a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 1>money to music industry is booming,</v>

2190
01:36:52.671 --> 01:36:53.504
<v Speaker 1>but artists are losing big because most </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists are signed to record deals with </v>

2191
01:36:56.361 --> 01:37:01.361
<v Speaker 1>just 12 percent of revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twelve percent whoa.</v>

2192
01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:03.313
<v Speaker 2>Forty $3,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year was its most profitable year </v>

2193
01:37:05.691 --> 01:37:09.140
<v Speaker 2>since 2006 listeners to spending more </v>
<v Speaker 2>money than ever,</v>

2194
01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:14.560
<v Speaker 2>largely on streaming and live music with</v>
<v Speaker 2>consumer spending tow totaling more than</v>

2195
01:37:14.841 --> 01:37:16.370
<v Speaker 2>$20,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>last year.</v>

2196
01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:17.893
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet artists aren't feeling the increase </v>

2197
01:37:19.011 --> 01:37:23.720
<v Speaker 2>of the 20 billion music industry </v>
<v Speaker 2>entities such as record labels took home</v>

2198
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:24.583
<v Speaker 2>10 billion musicians taking home just </v>
<v Speaker 2>five point 1 billion with the majority </v>

2199
01:37:28.071 --> 01:37:30.740
<v Speaker 2>of the revenue coming from touring and </v>
<v Speaker 2>concert sales.</v>

2200
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:32.143
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing that it's like a </v>

2201
01:37:33.651 --> 01:37:35.510
<v Speaker 2>parasitic industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you.</v>

2202
01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:36.493
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People don't necessarily need them the </v>

2203
01:37:38.271 --> 01:37:39.050
<v Speaker 2>way they used to.</v>

2204
01:37:39.050 --> 01:37:40.460
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not they'd like they use to.</v>

2205
01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:42.350
<v Speaker 1>I was going to just play devil's </v>
<v Speaker 1>advocate and say,</v>

2206
01:37:42.351 --> 01:37:44.690
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it used to be that I'm the guy to put up</v>

2207
01:37:44.691 --> 01:37:45.840
<v Speaker 1>all the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm the label,</v>

2208
01:37:45.850 --> 01:37:46.683
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm putting up millions of dollars in </v>

2209
01:37:47.451 --> 01:37:49.640
<v Speaker 1>advanced gambling it on you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you.</v>

2210
01:37:49.641 --> 01:37:51.830
<v Speaker 1>When you want to take away my lion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>share it.</v>

2211
01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:52.693
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

2212
01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Now it's totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can do this on your own.</v>

2213
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2214
01:37:57.061 --> 01:37:59.460
<v Speaker 1>You could start an instagram started </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube.</v>

2215
01:37:59.461 --> 01:38:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Start this and you can make beats on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your laptop or like,</v>

2216
01:38:03.090 --> 01:38:05.340
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the guy who does everything?</v>

2217
01:38:05.610 --> 01:38:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Everything he's done is his own shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

2218
01:38:08.100 --> 01:38:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

2219
01:38:09.150 --> 01:38:09.983
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2220
01:38:10.150 --> 01:38:11.160
<v Speaker 1>You don't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

2221
01:38:12.150 --> 01:38:12.983
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's got a conspiracy theory </v>

2222
01:38:13.890 --> 01:38:14.723
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's got more support than he would </v>

2223
01:38:16.261 --> 01:38:17.610
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he does.</v>

2224
01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:18.580
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2225
01:38:18.610 --> 01:38:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Now it does.</v>

2226
01:38:19.230 --> 01:38:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean basically has become huge all</v>

2227
01:38:22.081 --> 01:38:22.914
<v Speaker 1>on his own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2228
01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:24.900
<v Speaker 1>And you meet me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look,</v>

2229
01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:28.530
<v Speaker 1>it's like so many viral music hits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2230
01:38:28.531 --> 01:38:29.364
<v Speaker 1>they get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get big online just because kids </v>

2231
01:38:30.931 --> 01:38:33.690
<v Speaker 1>share it and they like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then then it becomes gigantic.</v>

2232
01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Like with the music industry that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>

2233
01:38:36.211 --> 01:38:38.310
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the labels have nothing to do with that,</v>

2234
01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:39.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2235
01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:40.693
<v Speaker 1>There's labels that are doing their </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing out there that they actually know </v>

2236
01:38:42.481 --> 01:38:44.190
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing in marketing wise and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>

2237
01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:48.060
<v Speaker 1>There's still a lot of kids that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>being made famous by label.</v>

2238
01:38:48.061 --> 01:38:50.200
<v Speaker 1>So there's some benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of these,</v>

2239
01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:51.293
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the reasons that some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists are only seeing five point one </v>

2240
01:38:52.921 --> 01:38:54.560
<v Speaker 1>minutes because they're signed to record</v>
<v Speaker 1>deals.</v>

2241
01:38:54.570 --> 01:38:56.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay z ain't only seeing five,</v>

2242
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.450
<v Speaker 1>five percent of what he's due because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2243
01:38:59.510 --> 01:39:00.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been in the game long enough,</v>

2244
01:39:00.721 --> 01:39:01.554
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they started out with their own </v>

2245
01:39:02.221 --> 01:39:02.520
<v Speaker 1>label.</v>

2246
01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:06.090
<v Speaker 1>They started to beverly beginning </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rockafella records was independent.</v>

2247
01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.190
<v Speaker 1>So that's the kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2248
01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:10.930
<v Speaker 1>those guys are never gonna lose as long </v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

2249
01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:13.530
<v Speaker 1>they can still make music that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>buy.</v>

2250
01:39:13.650 --> 01:39:14.483
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They figure out a way to rope you in </v>

2251
01:39:15.781 --> 01:39:19.470
<v Speaker 1>early to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like even if your record is successful,</v>

2252
01:39:19.471 --> 01:39:21.990
<v Speaker 1>the second record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you're going to be able to</v>

2253
01:39:21.991 --> 01:39:23.900
<v Speaker 1>be independent on the second record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll you,</v>

2254
01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:25.950
<v Speaker 1>they own you for several down the line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2255
01:39:26.130 --> 01:39:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Usually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it used to be.</v>

2256
01:39:27.391 --> 01:39:31.190
<v Speaker 1>I think the standard was like eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight that.</v>

2257
01:39:31.250 --> 01:39:32.460
<v Speaker 1>But that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2258
01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:33.170
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2259
01:39:33.170 --> 01:39:35.280
<v Speaker 1>it's misleading because it depends on </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're from too.</v>

2260
01:39:35.281 --> 01:39:36.170
<v Speaker 1>There's also like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2261
01:39:36.171 --> 01:39:37.004
<v Speaker 1>if your first record was very successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have a lawyer that has anywhere </v>

2262
01:39:39.361 --> 01:39:41.760
<v Speaker 1>with all your renegotiating before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do second record,</v>

2263
01:39:41.761 --> 01:39:43.050
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are things you learn,</v>

2264
01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:46.830
<v Speaker 1>but like if you're struggling that at </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight record thing too.</v>

2265
01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:47.663
<v Speaker 1>Also if you study the record business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes back to like when actually </v>

2266
01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:54.060
<v Speaker 1>artists used to be built that like over </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2267
01:39:54.330 --> 01:39:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Nobody expected the first album to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

2268
01:39:56.581 --> 01:39:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Like when you signed bands like in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties,</v>

2269
01:39:58.601 --> 01:39:59.340
<v Speaker 1>the bike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2270
01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:01.530
<v Speaker 1>they had a plan like my album three and </v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

2271
01:40:01.531 --> 01:40:03.810
<v Speaker 1>here's where we'll be used to build </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists.</v>

2272
01:40:03.811 --> 01:40:08.640
<v Speaker 1>They used to be a and are they actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to nurture and fucking take care of</v>

2273
01:40:08.641 --> 01:40:10.560
<v Speaker 1>a band for a long time and watch them </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow?</v>

2274
01:40:10.570 --> 01:40:13.050
<v Speaker 1>What I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the way it used to be until like,</v>

2275
01:40:13.051 --> 01:40:14.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was.</v>

2276
01:40:14.581 --> 01:40:15.414
<v Speaker 1>I maybe the eighties had changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a record deal for my comedy album </v>

2277
01:40:18.781 --> 01:40:19.614
<v Speaker 1>in 1999.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a record deal with warner </v>

2278
01:40:21.031 --> 01:40:22.740
<v Speaker 1>brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a real record deal,</v>

2279
01:40:22.741 --> 01:40:24.880
<v Speaker 1>like a met with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2280
01:40:24.881 --> 01:40:28.370
<v Speaker 1>they promoted it the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2281
01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:33.000
<v Speaker 1>I went through the whole record industry</v>
<v Speaker 1>business and there was always a comedian</v>

2282
01:40:33.001 --> 01:40:33.834
<v Speaker 1>or two on labels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they don't have that anymore because </v>

2283
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:38.460
<v Speaker 1>comedy albums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the do it yourself.</v>

2284
01:40:38.670 --> 01:40:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that you definitely can do</v>

2285
01:40:40.591 --> 01:40:41.424
<v Speaker 1>it yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but comedy albums just aren't that </v>

2286
01:40:42.511 --> 01:40:44.780
<v Speaker 1>popular anymore for some strange reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2287
01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:46.620
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2288
01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:48.093
<v Speaker 1>it's a peer support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also the art form you want to watch it </v>

2289
01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:53.100
<v Speaker 1>exam was about to say it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so visual that now</v>

2290
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:57.840
<v Speaker 2>comedy albums were big when everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have a TV screen or everything is</v>

2291
01:40:57.940 --> 01:40:59.480
<v Speaker 2>like you could listen and imagine what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we.</v>

2292
01:40:59.481 --> 01:41:02.650
<v Speaker 2>What he was doing or saying and </v>
<v Speaker 2>translate super well,</v>

2293
01:41:02.651 --> 01:41:06.220
<v Speaker 2>like Mitch Hedberg translates amazing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>cd to,</v>

2294
01:41:06.221 --> 01:41:08.410
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to just audio only because his,</v>

2295
01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:12.070
<v Speaker 2>he basically just stands there and tells</v>
<v Speaker 2>great jokes.</v>

2296
01:41:12.370 --> 01:41:13.600
<v Speaker 2>Like he doesn't have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2297
01:41:14.130 --> 01:41:16.570
<v Speaker 2>it's fun to watch them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more fun to watch him,</v>

2298
01:41:16.571 --> 01:41:19.390
<v Speaker 2>but once you know what he looks like and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how he does it,</v>

2299
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:21.940
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of cool to listen to it on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>albums.</v>

2300
01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:24.243
<v Speaker 2>I was just talking about Steven right </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other day to Steven Wright was a </v>

2301
01:41:26.921 --> 01:41:28.630
<v Speaker 2>genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was amazing.</v>

2302
01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:29.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>

2303
01:41:29.670 --> 01:41:31.770
<v Speaker 2>that style is hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See what,</v>

2304
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:35.770
<v Speaker 2>what Mitch Hedberg basically did was do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Steven Wright style,</v>

2305
01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:36.753
<v Speaker 2>but like a more stony drug style but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the drugs allowed him to come up </v>

2306
01:41:42.401 --> 01:41:43.780
<v Speaker 2>with way more of those things.</v>

2307
01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:49.420
<v Speaker 2>Hedberg he just go on for days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had so much fucking material man.</v>

2308
01:41:49.421 --> 01:41:53.410
<v Speaker 2>That guy wrote constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was always writing until the end.</v>

2309
01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:55.210
<v Speaker 2>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2310
01:41:55.211 --> 01:41:57.550
<v Speaker 2>the drugs got to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously they killed him.</v>

2311
01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:00.620
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was uh,</v>

2312
01:42:00.910 --> 01:42:01.743
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

2313
01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:05.380
<v Speaker 2>that's a non sequitur style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the hardest style of comedy.</v>

2314
01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:06.573
<v Speaker 2>You say one thing and then you say </v>
<v Speaker 2>something totally unrelated to the next </v>

2315
01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:11.920
<v Speaker 2>joke and the next joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally unrelated.</v>

2316
01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:17.040
<v Speaker 2>No sequencing or no man and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all segues.</v>

2317
01:42:17.050 --> 01:42:18.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't a secret.</v>

2318
01:42:18.460 --> 01:42:19.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an outlet.</v>

2319
01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:21.280
<v Speaker 2>Sequency too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they don't.</v>

2320
01:42:21.330 --> 01:42:23.410
<v Speaker 2>They don't fit in together in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

2321
01:42:23.411 --> 01:42:25.880
<v Speaker 2>shape or form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just total non sequitur.</v>

2322
01:42:25.890 --> 01:42:26.890
<v Speaker 2>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a funny thing.</v>

2323
01:42:26.891 --> 01:42:29.650
<v Speaker 2>I thought of his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another funny thing I thought of,</v>

2324
01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:32.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his style is so unique.</v>

2325
01:42:32.770 --> 01:42:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Just the way he delivered things was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>unique.</v>

2326
01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:39.370
<v Speaker 2>He was funny just talking about nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>like talking about anything.</v>

2327
01:42:39.371 --> 01:42:40.820
<v Speaker 2>One of my favorite jokes at his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2328
01:42:41.290 --> 01:42:42.123
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody asked me if I want a frozen </v>

2329
01:42:43.181 --> 01:42:44.410
<v Speaker 2>banana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2330
01:42:44.411 --> 01:42:47.140
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want a regular banana later.</v>

2331
01:42:47.230 --> 01:42:52.230
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just silly joke,</v>

2332
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:59.140
<v Speaker 2>but it's such a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

2333
01:42:59.230 --> 01:43:01.810
<v Speaker 2>All Day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got like one of the best.</v>

2334
01:43:01.870 --> 01:43:05.290
<v Speaker 2>He's his albums with some of the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>donor material of all time.</v>

2335
01:43:05.291 --> 01:43:07.090
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the best made me go listen to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>

2336
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was an incredible man,</v>

2337
01:43:08.690 --> 01:43:09.523
<v Speaker 2>so I'm familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just haven't listened to him or heard </v>

2338
01:43:11.141 --> 01:43:11.974
<v Speaker 2>any of them throwing them on every now </v>
<v Speaker 2>and again when I'm on my way to the </v>

2339
01:43:13.601 --> 01:43:14.434
<v Speaker 2>airport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I you still listened to on serious all </v>

2340
01:43:16.181 --> 01:43:18.610
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the comedy channel than the dirtier,</v>

2341
01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:22.060
<v Speaker 2>darker one and he'd pop on there every </v>
<v Speaker 2>once in a while.</v>

2342
01:43:22.061 --> 01:43:22.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2343
01:43:23.670 --> 01:43:24.520
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2344
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:27.050
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had Sirius in forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you still?</v>

2345
01:43:27.090 --> 01:43:29.190
<v Speaker 2>It's used to listen to that now because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2346
01:43:29.860 --> 01:43:30.970
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2347
01:43:30.971 --> 01:43:31.804
<v Speaker 2>I don't really honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my favorite thing in the car is silence </v>

2348
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:37.180
<v Speaker 2>really by myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

2349
01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:38.233
<v Speaker 2>I get a lot of thinking done driving </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's or like if I'm ever really </v>

2350
01:43:42.101 --> 01:43:44.020
<v Speaker 2>like stumped while I'm working on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>song,</v>

2351
01:43:44.110 --> 01:43:46.690
<v Speaker 2>like because I don't write things down </v>
<v Speaker 2>or anything.</v>

2352
01:43:46.691 --> 01:43:51.130
<v Speaker 2>Like just I'll get in the car and drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then somehow it'll work itself out.</v>

2353
01:43:51.530 --> 01:43:54.770
<v Speaker 2>I can really just relax behind the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wheel.</v>

2354
01:43:54.890 --> 01:43:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what you mean.</v>

2355
01:43:56.210 --> 01:43:58.160
<v Speaker 2>Unless I'm in the middle of like fucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

2356
01:43:58.750 --> 01:43:59.583
<v Speaker 2>be like at night I can get in the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could drive on an open road and it'll </v>

2357
01:44:02.601 --> 01:44:04.370
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really relaxes me.</v>

2358
01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:07.790
<v Speaker 2>I have a car that it take to the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>store all the time and it's a 1993.</v>

2359
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Porsche doesn't have any radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no radio.</v>

2360
01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:13.760
<v Speaker 2>It's manual transmission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no power steering,</v>

2361
01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:15.820
<v Speaker 2>no air conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

2362
01:44:16.130 --> 01:44:18.770
<v Speaker 2>it's just an old car and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when,</v>

2363
01:44:18.830 --> 01:44:22.730
<v Speaker 2>when you drive it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel every bump into you shifted.</v>

2364
01:44:22.970 --> 01:44:23.803
<v Speaker 2>But because of all that I have to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it makes it fires my brain up </v>

2365
01:44:28.071 --> 01:44:29.480
<v Speaker 2>because I'm doing all these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

2366
01:44:29.481 --> 01:44:31.130
<v Speaker 2>hitting a clutch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shifting the gears,</v>

2367
01:44:31.460 --> 01:44:32.293
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>managing this heavy steering wheel and </v>

2368
01:44:34.371 --> 01:44:36.590
<v Speaker 2>all that jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I get to the store,</v>

2369
01:44:36.591 --> 01:44:38.870
<v Speaker 2>my brain is like charged up because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2370
01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:40.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like I've been doing a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

2371
01:44:40.461 --> 01:44:43.820
<v Speaker 2>It's exercise and your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in the back seat,</v>

2372
01:44:43.821 --> 01:44:45.230
<v Speaker 2>sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2373
01:44:45.290 --> 01:44:47.600
<v Speaker 2>waiting to get to the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I leave myself up.</v>

2374
01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:50.750
<v Speaker 2>I love to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you still get that crazy audi?</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's in the style,</v>

2401
01:46:03.741 --> 01:46:04.574
<v Speaker 2>like it's still relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they've kept that style basically </v>

2402
01:46:06.861 --> 01:46:10.760
<v Speaker 2>with just a little few facelifts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>improvements for a few years.</v>

2403
01:46:10.761 --> 01:46:12.500
<v Speaker 2>Essentially like a mini Lamborghini.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2404
01:46:12.501 --> 01:46:13.830
<v Speaker 2>It's the same engine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2405
01:46:13.831 --> 01:46:16.790
<v Speaker 2>That's the Guy Yardo at the same engine </v>
<v Speaker 2>as the guy who was a vet.</v>

2406
01:46:16.791 --> 01:46:17.624
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's more than enough power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The crazy thing about today's cars are </v>

2407
01:46:20.330 --> 01:46:22.790
<v Speaker 2>so they have so much power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just ridiculous.</v>

2408
01:46:22.791 --> 01:46:25.970
<v Speaker 2>Like every year it's like a new faster </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero to 60 time.</v>

2409
01:46:26.420 --> 01:46:28.490
<v Speaker 2>New Records on the nurburgring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2410
01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:30.620
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you taking this?</v>

2411
01:46:30.621 --> 01:46:32.570
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you going to drive this </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that fast,</v>

2412
01:46:33.050 --> 01:46:33.883
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just going to be teleporting the new </v>

2413
01:46:35.810 --> 01:46:36.643
<v Speaker 2>corvette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zr one has 700 and something fucking </v>

2414
01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:41.040
<v Speaker 2>horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does the,</v>

2415
01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:44.330
<v Speaker 2>how does even stay on it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barely does that.</v>

2416
01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:45.193
<v Speaker 2>One of the drivers from GM,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of like the head execs from gm took </v>

2417
01:46:47.871 --> 01:46:48.704
<v Speaker 2>it on a race track like when they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>first releasing it and crashed like </v>

2418
01:46:51.601 --> 01:46:54.120
<v Speaker 2>immediately spun out and slammed into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking wall.</v>

2419
01:46:58.790 --> 01:47:00.690
<v Speaker 2>You got to know what the fuck you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

2420
01:47:00.691 --> 01:47:01.524
<v Speaker 2>If you're you're throttling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have to be able to navigate </v>

2421
01:47:03.721 --> 01:47:04.554
<v Speaker 2>that throttle with 700 horsepower </v>
<v Speaker 2>because no matter what those wheels are </v>

2422
01:47:07.501 --> 01:47:08.334
<v Speaker 2>spinning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to how much especially rear </v>

2423
01:47:09.601 --> 01:47:10.434
<v Speaker 2>wheel drive them and how much traction </v>
<v Speaker 2>control do you have ever seen that </v>

2424
01:47:12.781 --> 01:47:13.920
<v Speaker 2>video?</v>
<v Speaker 2>See?</v>

2425
01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:14.783
<v Speaker 2>Find the fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good video to watch to let you </v>

2426
01:47:18.601 --> 01:47:21.720
<v Speaker 2>know like this is a crazy vehicle that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you people are selling.</v>

2427
01:47:21.950 --> 01:47:22.783
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're letting people get a car that is </v>

2428
01:47:24.571 --> 01:47:28.470
<v Speaker 2>so much faster than anything that was on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the road five years ago.</v>

2429
01:47:29.090 --> 01:47:29.923
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking insane mobilian this </v>

2430
01:47:31.710 --> 01:47:35.400
<v Speaker 2>speed limiting changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That car comes in handy.</v>

2431
01:47:36.030 --> 01:47:37.580
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2432
01:47:37.850 --> 01:47:40.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>GM exec crashes.</v>

2433
01:47:41.010 --> 01:47:44.860
<v Speaker 2>New Corvette Z R one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he got.</v>

2434
01:47:44.910 --> 01:47:49.910
<v Speaker 2>This was before it was even released.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This dude showed everyone I got an extra</v>

2435
01:47:50.251 --> 01:47:53.060
<v Speaker 2>one you sent me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was funny.</v>

2436
01:47:53.110 --> 01:47:56.310
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I liked a picture of his so long ago</v>

2437
01:47:56.311 --> 01:47:57.210
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here it is.</v>

2438
01:47:57.211 --> 01:47:58.044
<v Speaker 2>Look at this guy.</v>

2439
01:48:00.570 --> 01:48:05.570
<v Speaker 2>Play that again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This play it from the beginning.</v>

2440
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:08.850
<v Speaker 2>This knucklehead started to click.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll see if there's more angles on.</v>

2441
01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:09.571
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2442
01:48:09.571 --> 01:48:11.130
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this right away.</v>

2443
01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:12.570
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy.</v>

2444
01:48:12.780 --> 01:48:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know how to drive.</v>

2445
01:48:13.981 --> 01:48:17.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking executive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2446
01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:18.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's driving like an asshole.</v>

2447
01:48:19.170 --> 01:48:21.280
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't know how to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry sir.</v>

2448
01:48:21.450 --> 01:48:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Put the foot down and he doesn't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck he's doing.</v>

2449
01:48:25.290 --> 01:48:27.170
<v Speaker 2>Dumb ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look that.</v>

2450
01:48:27.171 --> 01:48:28.004
<v Speaker 2>That's a car that you have to know how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to navigate once the side one the asset </v>

2451
01:48:31.830 --> 01:48:34.320
<v Speaker 2>kicks out to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just stomping it.</v>

2452
01:48:37.950 --> 01:48:38.783
<v Speaker 2>Sure he got uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he felt like a nice amount of shit at </v>

2453
01:48:42.421 --> 01:48:43.254
<v Speaker 2>the next board meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should look at that fucking car </v>

2454
01:48:45.991 --> 01:48:47.250
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good Lord.</v>

2455
01:48:47.251 --> 01:48:49.110
<v Speaker 2>What a beast of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they retailing for?</v>

2456
01:48:49.610 --> 01:48:51.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more than a hundred.</v>

2457
01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:53.940
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like 150,</v>
<v Speaker 2>160,000</v>

2458
01:48:54.250 --> 01:48:56.580
<v Speaker 2>probably fully loaded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is a monster.</v>

2459
01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:59.820
<v Speaker 2>It looks like what they've done to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>body stuff.</v>

2460
01:48:59.910 --> 01:49:00.743
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know where your Ra has a huge </v>

2461
01:49:02.701 --> 01:49:03.534
<v Speaker 2>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

2462
01:49:03.630 --> 01:49:07.740
<v Speaker 2>you're already as a four wheel drive car</v>
<v Speaker 2>and 755 horsepower.</v>

2463
01:49:07.860 --> 01:49:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Good Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good Lord saying Lord.</v>

2464
01:49:12.090 --> 01:49:17.090
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is it's hard to keep all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that power down on the,</v>

2465
01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:20.700
<v Speaker 2>on the ground with a rear wheel drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

2466
01:49:20.701 --> 01:49:23.730
<v Speaker 2>You're just going to get a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sliding and if you know how to drive you</v>

2467
01:49:23.731 --> 01:49:25.380
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who know how to drive,</v>

2468
01:49:25.381 --> 01:49:27.760
<v Speaker 2>they want to kick the ass end outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

2469
01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:33.320
<v Speaker 2>But like if you drive a like say a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nissan gtrs perfect example,</v>

2470
01:49:33.630 --> 01:49:34.463
<v Speaker 2>one of the best things about that car as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a regular person can drive it pretty </v>

2471
01:49:37.471 --> 01:49:38.304
<v Speaker 2>fast because there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>electronics and what they would call </v>

2472
01:49:40.990 --> 01:49:43.200
<v Speaker 2>nanny controls and sort of keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything in order.</v>

2473
01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:45.690
<v Speaker 2>So that car has been around for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2474
01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:48.490
<v Speaker 2>They really haven't changed a whole lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the way it looks.</v>

2475
01:49:48.670 --> 01:49:49.503
<v Speaker 2>They've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've made these incremental </v>

2476
01:49:50.681 --> 01:49:51.514
<v Speaker 2>improvements and performance and to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>day that is one of the cars you could </v>

2477
01:49:55.241 --> 01:49:57.460
<v Speaker 2>drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That car is a mother fucker.</v>

2478
01:49:57.461 --> 01:49:59.470
<v Speaker 2>I rented one of those in Austin last </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

2479
01:49:59.770 --> 01:50:00.603
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it fun to crazy to like does it </v>

2480
01:50:03.791 --> 01:50:06.970
<v Speaker 2>defies logic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It defies physics.</v>

2481
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.863
<v Speaker 2>That's the NYSSMA one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want that one unless you want </v>

2482
01:50:10.331 --> 01:50:12.270
<v Speaker 2>to take it to a track because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit's harshest.</v>

2483
01:50:12.271 --> 01:50:13.810
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just want the regular one.</v>

2484
01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:18.840
<v Speaker 2>The regular one is beastie enough?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're amazing cars though.</v>

2485
01:50:19.240 --> 01:50:21.000
<v Speaker 2>All the pop up windows trying to get you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to buy it,</v>

2486
01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:23.020
<v Speaker 2>buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buy it,</v>

2487
01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:23.973
<v Speaker 2>buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buy it.</v>

2488
01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:27.940
<v Speaker 2>But really if I was going to get a brand</v>
<v Speaker 2>new Japanese car,</v>

2489
01:50:28.420 --> 01:50:32.290
<v Speaker 2>the real car to get now is the new NSX.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The new NSX.</v>

2490

<v Speaker 2>it down outside.</v>

<v Speaker 2>regular engines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2546
01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:02.450
<v Speaker 2>When that was first by long before it </v>
<v Speaker 2>came out,</v>

2547
01:53:02.451 --> 01:53:03.284
<v Speaker 2>like about a year before it came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would like see this ugly fucking </v>

2549
01:53:07.191 --> 01:53:09.890

<v Speaker 2>So you couldn't see the car,</v>

2550
01:53:09.891 --> 01:53:11.740
<v Speaker 2>but you could totally tell what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shape was.</v>

2551
01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:14.400
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2554
01:53:20.700 --> 01:53:22.160
<v Speaker 2>And I drove one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once I had,</v>

2555

01:56:29.591 --> 01:56:31.210
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we should listen,</v>

2629
01:56:32.330 --> 01:56:34.060
<v Speaker 2>said he was an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might be.</v>

2630
01:56:35.950 --> 01:56:37.810
<v Speaker 2>Might be a higher thinking life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2631
01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:41.490
<v Speaker 2>he might as well be right if he was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>alien and he looked exactly like that.</v>

2632
01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:42.333
<v Speaker 2>I'll be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he grabbed the joint in the way he </v>

2633
01:56:43.691 --> 01:56:45.240
<v Speaker 2>kind of looked at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was kinda like,</v>

2634
01:56:45.241 --> 01:56:47.380
<v Speaker 2>it seemed kind of like a guy who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like,</v>

2635
01:56:47.660 --> 01:56:49.960
<v Speaker 2>we're not familiar with this practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

2636
01:56:50.140 --> 01:56:54.580
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe he's so smart that he thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be funny if you print attended.</v>

2637
01:56:54.581 --> 01:56:57.190
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know what a joint was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could be.</v>

2638
01:56:57.580 --> 01:56:59.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he didn't know what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

2639
01:56:59.111 --> 01:57:01.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying as he was about to </v>
<v Speaker 2>partake,</v>

2640
01:57:01.031 --> 01:57:03.190
<v Speaker 2>he kind of had this real inquisitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>lake.</v>

2641
01:57:03.670 --> 01:57:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there was a part.</v>

2642
01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:07.480
<v Speaker 2>It was a blunt and he almost seemed like</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't know what a blunt was.</v>

2643
01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:08.913
<v Speaker 2>Like you've never been a believer that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can believe that the glass tip could </v>

2644
01:57:11.831 --> 01:57:13.480
<v Speaker 2>have thrown them off because that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little unique.</v>

2645
01:57:13.481 --> 01:57:14.950
<v Speaker 2>If you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not familiar.</v>

2646
01:57:15.010 --> 01:57:17.080
<v Speaker 2>Not Everybody is hip to weed culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2647
01:57:17.200 --> 01:57:18.700
<v Speaker 2>as we think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2648
01:57:19.630 --> 01:57:20.463
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when he said that Tesla is going </v>

2649
01:57:22.661 --> 01:57:25.410
<v Speaker 2>private funding secure at 4:20,</v>

2650
01:57:27.770 --> 01:57:30.610
<v Speaker 2>which is $20,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that joke,</v>

2651
01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:33.670
<v Speaker 2>that joke cost them $20,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sec got mad at him.</v>

2652
01:57:33.671 --> 01:57:38.440
<v Speaker 2>They find him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was also your stock price is a little</v>

2653
01:57:38.441 --> 01:57:39.274
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that was one of the things in your </v>

2654
01:57:40.391 --> 01:57:43.750
<v Speaker 2>shareholders into a panic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie was concerned that they were going</v>

2655
01:57:43.751 --> 01:57:48.520
<v Speaker 2>to contact us and see if we arranged </v>
<v Speaker 2>that pot smoking part.</v>

2656
01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:49.773
<v Speaker 2>Like if that was something that had been</v>
<v Speaker 2>arranged in advance because it crashed </v>

2657
01:57:52.001 --> 01:57:54.830
<v Speaker 2>the stock stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>

2658
01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:58.970
<v Speaker 2>I was like Joe Rogan making noise out </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

02:00:57.551 --> 02:00:58.384

<v Speaker 2>episode of season two and then I went on</v>

<v Speaker 2>need to know about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People occasionally tweet me once and I </v>

2741
02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 2>why am I watching someone that you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the one,</v>

2742
02:01:40.041 --> 02:01:42.500
<v Speaker 2>the star trekking one and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>made me go look at it.</v>

2743
02:01:42.501 --> 02:01:43.334
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me go look at it again because I </v>

2744
02:01:44.481 --> 02:01:45.314
<v Speaker 2>think I watched it in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I tried early on and it was the </v>

2745
02:01:47.541 --> 02:01:50.230
<v Speaker 2>one where the politician had the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck the DA.</v>

2746
02:01:50.330 --> 02:01:51.163
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2747
02:01:51.230 --> 02:01:52.510
<v Speaker 2>and that kind of just seems like all </v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2748
02:01:52.630 --> 02:01:53.510
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2749
02:01:53.511 --> 02:01:57.040
<v Speaker 2>This weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I probably just wasn't as good.</v>

2750
02:01:57.110 --> 02:01:58.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then when you told me about that,</v>

2751
02:01:58.941 --> 02:01:59.774
<v Speaker 2>when I went back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started there and that was the last </v>

2752
02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:01.753
<v Speaker 2>season and I worked my way back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually got to that one again and </v>

2753
02:02:03.321 --> 02:02:05.480
<v Speaker 2>rewatched it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh these are all pretty crazy.</v>

2754
02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Did you see heavy metal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see that one?</v>

2755
02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:10.340
<v Speaker 2>That's the one with the drones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The drones coming after people.</v>

2756
02:02:10.400 --> 02:02:11.233
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2757
02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:12.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2758
02:02:12.710 --> 02:02:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Well that's too close to home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I binge watched black mirror.</v>

2759
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:19.460
<v Speaker 2>Pretty tough over just two or three day </v>
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

2760
02:02:19.461 --> 02:02:22.820
<v Speaker 2>And like for like a couple of weeks I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was convinced I'm living in a simulation</v>

2761
02:02:22.821 --> 02:02:23.654
<v Speaker 2>like after watching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the dating ones where they </v>

2762
02:02:26.561 --> 02:02:29.630
<v Speaker 2>just keep me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just blew my mind a little bit.</v>

2763
02:02:30.110 --> 02:02:32.180
<v Speaker 2>That was another thing that Ilan must </v>
<v Speaker 2>freaked me out about.</v>

2764
02:02:32.810 --> 02:02:35.390
<v Speaker 2>He was saying it's quite possible that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we are living in a simulation.</v>

2765
02:02:35.391 --> 02:02:36.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2766
02:02:36.130 --> 02:02:39.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm always playing with that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like is it like you posted something the</v>

2767
02:02:39.951 --> 02:02:41.510
<v Speaker 2>other day that was like someone.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Was that a real t shirt by the way?</v>

2769
02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:44.751
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2770
02:02:44.751 --> 02:02:48.440
<v Speaker 2>it's a real teacher that you can buy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not from Donald trump store.</v>

2771
02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:52.040
<v Speaker 2>It's a company that sell them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like trump store.shop.</v>

2772
02:02:52.170 --> 02:02:53.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's a real short.</v>

<v Speaker 2>showing you like where some things could</v>
<v Speaker 2>go in a total dystopian way.</v>

2784
02:03:27.651 --> 02:03:30.230
<v Speaker 2>Like where do you see crocodile that </v>
<v Speaker 2>episode?</v>

<v Speaker 2>That one was so fucked up.</v>

2876
02:07:03.970 --> 02:07:06.900

<v Speaker 1>Netflix too,</v>

2877
02:07:07.220 --> 02:07:09.630
<v Speaker 1>but right now it's on itunes and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to run it.</v>

2878
02:07:09.631 --> 02:07:11.460
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think I found it on Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2883
02:07:19.381 --> 02:07:20.214
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the figuring out something like </v>

2884
02:07:22.111 --> 02:07:22.944
<v Speaker 1>they're a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't figure out about that was </v>

2885
02:07:24.091 --> 02:07:28.560
<v Speaker 1>where was the flash point where this guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>became this guy.</v>

2886
02:07:28.590 --> 02:07:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Like what was the thing he did make </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody believe because that was never</v>

2887
02:07:33.541 --> 02:07:36.130
<v Speaker 1>made clear to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never understood like,</v>

2888
02:07:36.370 --> 02:07:37.203
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can understand people getting this </v>

2889
02:07:38.380 --> 02:07:39.213
<v Speaker 1>excited about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what was the thing that he did or </v>

2890
02:07:42.011 --> 02:07:45.250
<v Speaker 1>said or that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I never understood that</v>

2891
02:07:45.270 --> 02:07:46.103
<v Speaker 2>part of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been reading this book and it's </v>

2892
02:07:47.311 --> 02:07:49.500
<v Speaker 2>actually pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually have it right here,</v>

2893
02:07:49.950 --> 02:07:52.320
<v Speaker 2>the art of living and dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2894
02:07:52.321 --> 02:07:54.170
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote this book about one.</v>

2895
02:07:54.480 --> 02:07:55.313
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote this book after he became Osho </v>

2896
02:07:57.660 --> 02:08:00.290
<v Speaker 2>or maybe they published it after he </v>
<v Speaker 2>became Osha,</v>

2897
02:08:00.540 --> 02:08:02.050
<v Speaker 2>but it's a very good book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2898
02:08:02.051 --> 02:08:03.060
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2899
02:08:03.061 --> 02:08:06.270
<v Speaker 2>he had some very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what I think I left it at home.</v>

2900
02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:08.633
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here it is.</v>

2901
02:08:08.700 --> 02:08:09.533
<v Speaker 2>He had some very good ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's like he's like </v>

2902
02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:14.940
<v Speaker 2>philosophically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a fascinating guy.</v>

2903
02:08:15.340 --> 02:08:16.173
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it was a fascinating guy and there's </v>

2904
02:08:18.211 --> 02:08:21.120
<v Speaker 2>real good evidence that his followers </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking poisoned him.</v>

2905
02:08:21.930 --> 02:08:24.300
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say this real good evidence.</v>

2906
02:08:24.330 --> 02:08:25.163
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that filed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>case very closely that believe that </v>

2907
02:08:28.801 --> 02:08:32.190
<v Speaker 2>people close to him may have poisoned </v>
<v Speaker 2>him and taking his,</v>

2908
02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:35.160
<v Speaker 2>taking his money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the whole thing,</v>

<v Speaker 2>massive mind.</v>

2935
02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:42.793
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>cool there because I've never seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitive.</v>

2938
02:09:51.071 --> 02:09:51.904
<v Speaker 1>I've read this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like there's motherfuckers to </v>

2939
02:09:53.621 --> 02:09:54.610
<v Speaker 1>say it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2940
02:09:54.611 --> 02:09:55.444
<v Speaker 1>you set up and all this shit and that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>had such a perfect society going that </v>

2941
02:09:58.390 --> 02:10:00.160
<v Speaker 1>nobody wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would succeed,</v>

2942
02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:01.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2943
02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:02.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2944
02:10:02.110 --> 02:10:02.943
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure it's been proven that </v>

2945
02:10:03.551 --> 02:10:05.380
<v Speaker 1>the dude was doing some pretty criminal </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2946
02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:06.573
<v Speaker 1>Here's two things that seem to happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever anybody runs any kind of crazy </v>

2947
02:10:10.391 --> 02:10:15.391
<v Speaker 1>called or any sort of like a weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>community outside the norm.</v>

2948
02:10:17.890 --> 02:10:18.723
<v Speaker 1>It always becomes sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It always becomes like the dudes as a </v>

2949
02:10:21.740 --> 02:10:25.420
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what got him in trouble.</v>

2950
02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:26.433
<v Speaker 1>I'm and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I remember there being some </v>

2951
02:10:28.661 --> 02:10:29.240
<v Speaker 1>sexual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2952
02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:32.620
<v Speaker 1>They're having sex with children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

2953
02:10:32.900 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what they got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If</v>

2954
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:36.380
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to bust him on something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2955
02:10:36.381 --> 02:10:37.850
<v Speaker 2>if they're really wanting to bring them </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

2956
02:10:37.851 --> 02:10:39.380
<v Speaker 2>that's what they would accuse him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2957
02:10:39.381 --> 02:10:40.214
<v Speaker 2>you can't truly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once someone accuses you have sex with </v>

2958
02:10:42.141 --> 02:10:44.060
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're not guilty,</v>

2959
02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:45.253
<v Speaker 2>it's on you forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is like these no one has </v>

2960
02:10:48.861 --> 02:10:52.580
<v Speaker 2>ever pulled off like a Utopian </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative society.</v>

2961
02:10:52.610 --> 02:10:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

2962
02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:59.030
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting because at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire history of the United States,</v>

2963
02:10:59.090 --> 02:11:01.940
<v Speaker 2>no one's been able to do it like they </v>
<v Speaker 2>try it,</v>

2964
02:11:02.150 --> 02:11:05.210
<v Speaker 2>they'll try it for a little bit and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>it falls apart every single one of them.</v>

2965
02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:07.970
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that no one,</v>

2966
02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:10.390
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Waco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one like this.</v>

2967
02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:12.410
<v Speaker 2>I look at it like the line from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Matrix.</v>

2968
02:11:12.411 --> 02:11:13.244
<v Speaker 2>It's like our first version of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>matrix kept failing because it was all </v>

2969
02:11:16.161 --> 02:11:16.994
<v Speaker 2>too good and too nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had to fuck it up a little for </v>

2970
02:11:18.591 --> 02:11:19.590
<v Speaker 2>everybody will accept it.</v>

2971
02:11:23.390 --> 02:11:27.430
<v Speaker 2>It's just to me it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite fascinating that you know,</v>

2972
02:11:27.610 --> 02:11:30.800
<v Speaker 2>we stick to a standard way of living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

2973
02:11:30.801 --> 02:11:31.634
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our modern industrial western </v>

2974
02:11:33.651 --> 02:11:34.484
<v Speaker 2>civilization and that is it in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>deviation of that is scrutinized to the </v>

2975
02:11:38.661 --> 02:11:41.570
<v Speaker 2>point where it's dismantled and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government steps in.</v>

2976
02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:45.320
<v Speaker 2>They always have guns too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a guns and gun.</v>

2977
02:11:45.370 --> 02:11:46.203
<v Speaker 2>Wait too many guns because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to protect their way of life </v>

2978
02:11:48.021 --> 02:11:50.780
<v Speaker 2>and then someone's banging people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>wives and taken all the money.</v>

2979
02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:52.153
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird that no one has figured it </v>

2980
02:11:54.741 --> 02:11:55.574
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not One group has just got it nailed it </v>

2981
02:11:57.690 --> 02:11:58.523
<v Speaker 2>once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably part of the thing that power </v>

2982
02:11:59.601 --> 02:12:00.434
<v Speaker 2>corrupts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't have one person that's like </v>

2983
02:12:01.790 --> 02:12:02.710
<v Speaker 2>the Almighty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2984
02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:03.553
<v Speaker 2>It all over over thing because he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to take advantage and then </v>

2985
02:12:06.021 --> 02:12:08.480
<v Speaker 2>somebody smart within click is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2986
02:12:08.481 --> 02:12:10.370
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not right and it's going to fall</v>

2987
02:12:10.371 --> 02:12:11.204
<v Speaker 2>apart and it always is one person or </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be a person underneath </v>

2988
02:12:15.411 --> 02:12:18.290
<v Speaker 2>that wants that position and it's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do something to get it.</v>

2989
02:12:18.770 --> 02:12:22.730
<v Speaker 2>But it's always like one charismatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>person that seems to lead these things.</v>

2990
02:12:23.420 --> 02:12:25.790
<v Speaker 2>Like whether it's Jonestown or whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Waco,</v>

2991
02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:27.050
<v Speaker 2>Charles Manson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>

2992
02:12:27.230 --> 02:12:28.130
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2993
02:12:28.131 --> 02:12:30.110
<v Speaker 2>It's always one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One Dude's like,</v>

2994
02:12:30.111 --> 02:12:32.360
<v Speaker 2>this society is fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2995
02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:34.490
<v Speaker 2>You can take that and apply it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hitler.</v>

2996
02:12:34.550 --> 02:12:35.361
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

2997
02:12:35.361 --> 02:12:36.230
<v Speaker 2>Me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2998
02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:40.160
<v Speaker 2>One guy gets to everybody's attention </v>
<v Speaker 2>and next thing you know.</v>

2999
02:12:41.270 --> 02:12:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is weird,</v>

3000
02:12:42.141 --> 02:12:44.450
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this desire to have like our big,</v>

3001
02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:46.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big daddy who got all the answers,</v>

3002
02:12:46.730 --> 02:12:48.890
<v Speaker 2>who's better than us because we're all </v>
<v Speaker 2>so confused.</v>

3003
02:12:48.891 --> 02:12:52.070
<v Speaker 2>It would be very comforting if someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>came along who really understood at all,</v>

3004
02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:55.820
<v Speaker 2>I've got the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a big ass giant,</v>

3005
02:12:55.821 --> 02:12:59.770
<v Speaker 2>crazy white beard like Osho did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they bowed you,</v>

3006
02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:03.480
<v Speaker 2>their answers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blame the people you wanted to blame and</v>

3007
02:13:03.481 --> 02:13:04.460
<v Speaker 2>make you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3008
02:13:04.461 --> 02:13:06.840
<v Speaker 2>That's another good technique is to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure you know,</v>

3009
02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:08.540
<v Speaker 2>what does everybody want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3010
02:13:08.541 --> 02:13:12.050
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're going to blame it on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll focus our hate capitalism.</v>

3011
02:13:12.051 --> 02:13:13.440
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3012
02:13:13.740 --> 02:13:17.420
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these things don't work out </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have to be based on what we</v>

3013
02:13:17.421 --> 02:13:18.670
<v Speaker 2>talked about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

3014
02:13:19.190 --> 02:13:23.450
<v Speaker 2>Doing unto others as you want them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to fully living that lifestyle.</v>

3015
02:13:23.470 --> 02:13:24.303
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All alright.</v>

3016
02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:25.153
<v Speaker 2>When it doesn't happen like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cats get the power they getting </v>

3017
02:13:28.321 --> 02:13:29.870
<v Speaker 2>charged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to keep that power.</v>

3018
02:13:29.871 --> 02:13:31.010
<v Speaker 2>They want to stay in charge</v>

3019
02:13:32.180 --> 02:13:33.990
<v Speaker 1>and they're not going to treat other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that way.</v>

3020
02:13:33.991 --> 02:13:34.571
<v Speaker 1>They want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna.</v>

3021
02:13:34.571 --> 02:13:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Start intimidating people because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you keep people in line.</v>

3022
02:13:38.550 --> 02:13:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People want to be subjugated,</v>

3023
02:13:41.731 --> 02:13:42.780
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you saying.</v>

3024
02:13:42.781 --> 02:13:43.560
<v Speaker 1>They want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want.</v>

3025
02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:45.360
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want somebody to babysit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3026
02:13:45.690 --> 02:13:46.523
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can just sit over here and just be </v>

3027
02:13:46.921 --> 02:13:47.731
<v Speaker 1>dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3028
02:13:47.731 --> 02:13:49.590
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if no one was in charge,</v>

3029
02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:51.830
<v Speaker 1>someone would come along that would want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be in charge of.</v>

3030
02:13:51.860 --> 02:13:52.591
<v Speaker 1>Someone would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

3031
02:13:52.591 --> 02:13:54.690
<v Speaker 1>The problem with this organization is </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no leadership.</v>

3032
02:13:55.800 --> 02:13:56.633
<v Speaker 1>We need a strong leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need someone who respects the values </v>

3033
02:13:58.980 --> 02:14:01.470
<v Speaker 1>and principles this society was founded </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

3034
02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:04.590
<v Speaker 1>but someone who also understands how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a leader and then people go,</v>

3035
02:14:04.591 --> 02:14:06.240
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

3036
02:14:07.530 --> 02:14:09.210
<v Speaker 1>That makes so much sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3037
02:14:09.270 --> 02:14:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Guide us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just want to.</v>

3038
02:14:11.060 --> 02:14:11.620
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3039
02:14:11.620 --> 02:14:12.630
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing.</v>

3040
02:14:12.660 --> 02:14:14.910
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what goes on in instagram.</v>

3041
02:14:14.970 --> 02:14:16.770
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to believe everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>got their.</v>

3042
02:14:16.830 --> 02:14:20.400
<v Speaker 1>That that guy's got his shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's got his shit together,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Not knowing that like behind the scenes </v>

3045
02:14:24.510 --> 02:14:26.370
<v Speaker 1>he's falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's falling the fuck apart,</v>

3046

<v Speaker 1>they got there.</v>

3048
02:14:28.610 --> 02:14:29.443
<v Speaker 1>She had a friend recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No names or anything but like a friend </v>

3049

<v Speaker 1>but something it was just like just </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows you none of that shit is real </v>

3061

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3063
02:15:07.710 --> 02:15:08.543
<v Speaker 1>Elon Musk talked about that to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that you see on instagram that </v>

3064
02:15:11.221 --> 02:15:12.054

<v Speaker 1>They're always trying to project you the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best version of what their life is.</v>

3068
02:15:23.251 --> 02:15:24.084

<v Speaker 1>struggles like this,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but we're going to get through it.</v>

3072

<v Speaker 1>We're going to be one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like about you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3075
02:15:39.060 --> 02:15:39.893
<v Speaker 1>even though you're a famous guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been a successful musician for a long </v>

3076
02:15:42.151 --> 02:15:43.620
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I used to be fast,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It is the highest contact of that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>have to ship my brain before we do.</v>
