91
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.200

<v Speaker 2>Last time steps was here.</v>

92
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about killing babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that?</v>

93
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was talking about like maybe she'll</v>

94
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.670
<v Speaker 2>be able to board a baby six months after</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's born.</v>

95
00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:25.390
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you talking about man?</v>

96
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he have notes?</v>

97
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.020
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

98
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that's what he hasn't prepared.</v>

99
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 2>You don't have no notes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was like,</v>

100
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:32.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's kill alive babies.</v>

101
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gay dudes feel very differently about</v>

102
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 2>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they can't make them as long as</v>

103
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 2>they're doing only gay things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no babies being made.</v>

104
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so detached from the idea of a baby.</v>

105
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.190
<v Speaker 2>Did you think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taylor?</v>

106
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just telling you that shit.</v>

107
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 2>Did he have strong points?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

108
00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 2>Straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Killed a baby who's just being</v>

109
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:01.640
<v Speaker 2>controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

110
00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:02.530
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

111

00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:12.184
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

146
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.650
<v Speaker 2>You just get the shakes and you feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like shit,</v>

147
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.150
<v Speaker 2>but heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could live.</v>

148
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.130
<v Speaker 2>Booze is one of the rare drugs that will</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill you if you drop it cold Turkey if</v>

149
00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:22.000
<v Speaker 2>you're an alcoholic.</v>

150
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.000
<v Speaker 2>But do you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a difference between</v>

151
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.040
<v Speaker 2>heavy drinker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

152
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.831
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

153
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:30.400
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

154
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.610
<v Speaker 2>Casual Boozer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

155
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.930
<v Speaker 2>like if you booze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe if you have like two or three</v>

156
00:05:34.931 --> 00:05:37.180
<v Speaker 2>drinks at night and then quit cold</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkey will be fine.</v>

157
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.310
<v Speaker 2>But if you're one of those all day</v>
<v Speaker 2>drinkers.</v>

158
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you quit cold Turkey,</v>

159
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.510
<v Speaker 2>you will die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very common.</v>

160
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.360
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the more common drugs that</v>

161
00:05:46.361 --> 00:05:47.410
<v Speaker 2>you die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>

162
00:05:47.411 --> 00:05:50.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a like Benzos,</v>

163
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.610
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those will kill you from withdrawal.</v>

164
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 2>There's a few different pharmaceuticals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll kill you from withdrawal,</v>

165
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.660

<v Speaker 4>list.</v>

166
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:03.320
<v Speaker 4>I think it's very rare that people die</v>
<v Speaker 4>from heroin withdrawal or they get</v>

167
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:04.154
<v Speaker 4>really sick.</v>

<v Speaker 4>for first of all,</v>

177
00:06:25.891 --> 00:06:27.230
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that he points out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>

178
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.370
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's talk about a drug free society.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's like there's never been one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

180
00:06:30.931 --> 00:06:32.640
<v Speaker 4>there's never been one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's never been a drug for you and</v>

181
00:06:32.641 --> 00:06:35.910
<v Speaker 4>you don't normally want it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes when it comes to whether it's</v>

182
00:06:35.911 --> 00:06:38.610
<v Speaker 4>caffeine or alcohol and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>pharmaceutical drugs,</v>

183
00:06:38.611 --> 00:06:40.440
<v Speaker 4>things that help people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

184
00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 4>we have this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We decided to demonize certain drugs and</v>

185
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:45.450
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the drugs you've got to be worried about</v>

186
00:06:45.451 --> 00:06:49.710
<v Speaker 4>like alcohol's ones carries once because</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you quit cold Turkey,</v>

187
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.230
<v Speaker 4>if you're a hardcore drinker and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>drink and all the time</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't think it helps.</v>

190
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it activates the same part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your brain.</v>

191
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.380
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to a photographer,</v>

192
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.260
<v Speaker 3>I was at this festival this weekend and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had a,</v>

193
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.830

<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

196
00:07:16.021 --> 00:07:20.610
<v Speaker 3>you can only develop black and white</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you develop your color</v>

197

<v Speaker 3>pitches,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Poppers are those little things where if</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was like a ice cream place and they</v>

<v Speaker 3>That kills a lot of brands.</v>

216
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.410
<v Speaker 3>I remember I did one weekend in college</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I think I did it on a Friday</v>

217
00:08:22.411 --> 00:08:25.400
<v Speaker 3>night and on the Sunday I was just</v>
<v Speaker 3>walking on.</v>

218
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I was forced into Yale</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because I was trying to justify how</v>

219
00:08:31.141 --> 00:08:34.860
<v Speaker 3>I felt or if it was a natural yell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yelling was happening.</v>

220
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.000
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

222
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:40.410
<v Speaker 3>something you ever just tweak out by</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

223
00:08:40.411 --> 00:08:43.180
<v Speaker 3>Just you ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You never did.</v>

<v Speaker 3>After like a crazy workout</v>

225
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.990
<v Speaker 3>after work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm usually spent a week out do</v>

226
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.030

<v Speaker 2>put a show for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Change your state of mind just by</v>

230
00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:05.191
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

231
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:06.430
<v Speaker 2>Like people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you smile,</v>

232
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.890

<v Speaker 2>if you freak out,</v>

235
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:12.690

<v Speaker 2>those battle cries.</v>

240
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.230
<v Speaker 3>Why else are they doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Getting fired up?</v>

241
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.840
<v Speaker 3>You get hyped up by yelling or singing a</v>
<v Speaker 3>song.</v>

242
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:30.380
<v Speaker 3>Viking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a New Zealand New Zealand,</v>

243
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:32.094
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

244
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:32.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where they,</v>

245
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:36.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will play this video of them</v>

246
00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:39.330
<v Speaker 3>playing the USA team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

247
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:43.220
<v Speaker 3>And they're doing this elaborate thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing.</v>

248
00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:48.510
<v Speaker 3>It's very elaborate and just energetic</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they cut to the USA team and they're</v>

249
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.130
<v Speaker 3>kind of looking back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kinda just con.</v>

250
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.510
<v Speaker 3>Not Confused,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just what's going on.</v>

251
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.640
<v Speaker 3>And they went through this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this right here?</v>

252
00:09:56.641 --> 00:09:57.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

253
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.420
<v Speaker 2>And they didn't a basketball game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basketball,</v>

254
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.090
<v Speaker 2>some volume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is ridiculous.</v>

255
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.510
<v Speaker 5>Basketball</v>
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

256
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.160
<v Speaker 5>dusted by 45 points.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're playing NBA superstars.</v>

257
00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:15.820
<v Speaker 5>You fucked the dummies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just for the culture.</v>

258
00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.560
<v Speaker 5>That's what they do all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's.</v>

259
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.900
<v Speaker 5>But it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems so stupid.</v>

260
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:28.990
<v Speaker 5>It seems stupid if you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you played basketball and stupid?</v>

261
00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.370
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think if you.</v>

262
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.290
<v Speaker 5>It's a performance art,</v>

263
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.520
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other players clapped.</v>

264
00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Clapped like good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good job.</v>

265
00:10:37.611 --> 00:10:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that game.</v>

266
00:10:39.831 --> 00:10:42.590
<v Speaker 2>What was the final score that game?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred million to zero.</v>

267
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do all of that and then you're</v>

268
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.780
<v Speaker 2>asking kit kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

269
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:53.910
<v Speaker 2>that is one of the most unfair things</v>
<v Speaker 2>every day like nba superstars play in</v>

270
00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:55.880
<v Speaker 2>the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is so fucked up.</v>

271
00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.940
<v Speaker 2>It was in our country country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so fucked up.</v>

272
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.250
<v Speaker 2>It's so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

273
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.520
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andre Ward was an Olympic gold medalist,</v>

274
00:11:04.521 --> 00:11:06.350
<v Speaker 2>but if you let him boxing the Olympics</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

275
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.450
<v Speaker 2>it will be so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just wrong.</v>

276
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

277
00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just way better than the box in the</v>

278
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.040
<v Speaker 3>Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't let the professionals.</v>

279
00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:17.290
<v Speaker 3>Is it an age cap?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It</v>

280
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:18.150
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just.</v>

281
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.983
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

282
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they allow professionals</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

283
00:11:20.521 --> 00:11:24.010
<v Speaker 2>although that whole professional</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonprofessional things very,</v>

284
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.310
<v Speaker 2>very weird now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially now that they let nba players</v>

285
00:11:27.311 --> 00:11:29.010
<v Speaker 2>play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

286
00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:30.410
<v Speaker 2>because like there was always talk of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

287
00:11:30.411 --> 00:11:31.690
<v Speaker 2>Like when they were talking about doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

288
00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.520
<v Speaker 2>like it was back when Mike Tyson was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>

289
00:11:33.521 --> 00:11:33.941
<v Speaker 2>Then we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

290
00:11:33.941 --> 00:11:36.250
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What have you let Mike Tyson box the</v>

291
00:11:36.251 --> 00:11:37.810
<v Speaker 2>Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good luck.</v>

292
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:39.383
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

293
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.760
<v Speaker 3>the players from the other teams I pros</v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

294
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:42.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

295
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.910
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever that other countries,</v>

296
00:11:44.911 --> 00:11:47.520
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spain had some solid plans and some of</v>

297
00:11:47.521 --> 00:11:48.660
<v Speaker 3>them are NBA players.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paula,</v>

298
00:11:48.661 --> 00:11:53.661
<v Speaker 3>all marcus saw a rudy guns [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of other players that played in</v>

299
00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:54.514
<v Speaker 3>the NBA.</v>

300
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.890
<v Speaker 2>Australia actually put up a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a decent team.</v>

301
00:11:57.891 --> 00:12:00.730
<v Speaker 2>They got bogut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe Patty Mills,</v>

302
00:12:00.731 --> 00:12:02.530
<v Speaker 2>I might be fucking out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have a handful of,</v>

303
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.680
<v Speaker 2>a handful of pros from other countries</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in those pro leagues that have been</v>

304
00:12:08.201 --> 00:12:12.760
<v Speaker 2>competitive against but not those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which there's pros and then there's</v>

305
00:12:12.761 --> 00:12:15.790
<v Speaker 2>American pros when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>basketball,</v>

306
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.640
<v Speaker 2>there's no competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of a joke,</v>

307
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:21.610
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's getting close for a second for a</v>

308
00:12:21.611 --> 00:12:25.900
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Skinny Spain and Spain has some guys and</v>

309
00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:30.901
<v Speaker 2>spans a bunch of guys in the league.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's within Spain plays a USA.</v>

310
00:12:30.971 --> 00:12:35.410
<v Speaker 2>It's basically like some NBA players</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing against other nba players,</v>

311
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.380
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Versus random dudes.</v>

312
00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.720
<v Speaker 2>It instead of it being random dudes from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spain,</v>

313
00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:42.250
<v Speaker 2>it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

314
00:12:42.251 --> 00:12:46.180
<v Speaker 2>they might be playing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys on USA might be playing</v>

315
00:12:46.181 --> 00:12:48.970
<v Speaker 2>against one of their real NBA teammates.</v>

316
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

317
00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.530
<v Speaker 2>The rules are a little different to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>international basketball.</v>

318
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:54.700
<v Speaker 2>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the difference?</v>

319
00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:55.780
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go 10,</v>

320
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.500
<v Speaker 2>but once the ball hits the rim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can swat it off and an MBA and an</v>

321
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:02.800
<v Speaker 2>all American basketball pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't even touch the ball if it's</v>

322
00:13:02.801 --> 00:13:05.220
<v Speaker 2>anywhere close to the rim or above it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a.</v>

323
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.750
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole act like that's a whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>extra rule if you're like,</v>

324
00:13:07.751 --> 00:13:09.110
<v Speaker 2>if you're a seven foot tall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

325
00:13:09.111 --> 00:13:11.120
<v Speaker 2>You can just snatch the ball every time</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to near the room.</v>

326
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a couple of other little small ones</v>

327
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.300
<v Speaker 2>like bumping into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting how other countries</v>

328
00:13:16.301 --> 00:13:20.380
<v Speaker 2>used to used to be a noncompetitive in</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain sport.</v>

329
00:13:20.381 --> 00:13:22.990
<v Speaker 2>Like boxing is a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For the longest time,</v>

330
00:13:22.991 --> 00:13:26.650
<v Speaker 2>like the American boxers were head and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulders above the rest of the world.</v>

331
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:27.250
<v Speaker 2>Then?</v>

332
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like especially like in the heavyweight</v>

333
00:13:28.931 --> 00:13:30.980
<v Speaker 2>division,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't even close there.</v>

334
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Like there was Henry Cooper who hurt</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muhammad Ali real bad.</v>

335
00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:37.120
<v Speaker 2>That was an interesting story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is back on.</v>

336
00:13:37.121 --> 00:13:40.600
<v Speaker 2>Muhammad Ali was still cassius clay</v>
<v Speaker 2>before he became a home and wait,</v>

337
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:45.670
<v Speaker 2>and Henry Cooper was like the big</v>
<v Speaker 2>English heavyweight and he rocked</v>

338
00:13:45.671 --> 00:13:48.670
<v Speaker 2>Mohammed Ali with a left hook and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what Angelo Dundee did.</v>

339
00:13:48.671 --> 00:13:52.960
<v Speaker 2>He cut Muhammad Ali's gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went back to the corner and he sliced</v>

340
00:13:52.961 --> 00:13:54.230
<v Speaker 2>his gloves and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

341
00:13:54.231 --> 00:13:56.290
<v Speaker 2>we got to change these gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These gloves are fucked up.</v>

342
00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.960
<v Speaker 2>So they bought them all this time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had an</v>

343
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.260
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

344
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:04.600
<v Speaker 2>they had an undo the tape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get another pair of gloves,</v>

345
00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:08.410
<v Speaker 2>like the cut his fucking gloves because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the type of tricks you can do in</v>

346
00:14:08.411 --> 00:14:09.770
<v Speaker 2>the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

347
00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:10.933
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

348
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:12.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they did.</v>

349
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.530
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ever see the fight,</v>

350
00:14:14.531 --> 00:14:18.190
<v Speaker 2>he got cracked like more than he ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>got cracked in his entire career.</v>

351
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.870
<v Speaker 2>But Google Henry Cooper a rocks Mohammed</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ali.</v>

352
00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.320
<v Speaker 2>And so Mohammed Ali,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't Muhammad Ali was Cassius clay</v>

353
00:14:26.321 --> 00:14:28.840
<v Speaker 2>back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he drops him with like the perfect</v>

354
00:14:28.841 --> 00:14:33.220
<v Speaker 2>left hook that was his big punch to and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ali just crashes down to his ass and</v>

355
00:14:33.221 --> 00:14:36.760
<v Speaker 2>he's like out and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they gave them all sorts of time.</v>

356
00:14:36.761 --> 00:14:39.160

384
00:15:57.081 --> 00:16:02.081
<v Speaker 2>together all of these videos and he used</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do the voiceover for a lot of these</v>

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.280
<v Speaker 2>I forget his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was a.</v>

392
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.770
<v Speaker 2>He had a tremendous library of films.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

393
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.630
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike Tyson used to go and watch,</v>

394
00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously we're talking about the early</v>

395
00:16:35.211 --> 00:16:38.380
<v Speaker 2>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is before vhs tapes or raw.</v>

396
00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things weren't on vhs tapes,</v>

397
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:44.630
<v Speaker 2>so he would watch them like on 16</v>
<v Speaker 2>millimeter film.</v>

398
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:45.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

399
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:47.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>

400
00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm struggling to remember his fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>name.</v>

401
00:16:49.701 --> 00:16:54.701
<v Speaker 2>It's driving me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something with a J.</v>

402
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:56.503
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>point being,</v>

403
00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:01.540
<v Speaker 2>he probably edited that out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who didn't want to show the controversy</v>

404
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:06.740
<v Speaker 2>because it was plain straight cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just cheated.</v>

405
00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:10.210
<v Speaker 3>I want to hear the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the commentators did during that</v>

406
00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.720
<v Speaker 3>stall point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

407
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.720
<v Speaker 3>we don't know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or did they just veer off into other Ta</v>

408
00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:21.770
<v Speaker 3>sometimes how baseball commentators just</v>
<v Speaker 3>start talking about some weird random</v>

409
00:17:22.351 --> 00:17:26.690
<v Speaker 3>shit about their family</v>
<v Speaker 3>is downside,</v>

<v Speaker 3>baseball players.</v>

415
00:17:37.021 --> 00:17:38.100

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

416
00:17:38.101 --> 00:17:39.900
<v Speaker 3>Because there's so much downtime.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I forget what Teva was,</v>

<v Speaker 5>ritual.</v>

424
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:04.410
<v Speaker 5>Just each from like every little nuance</v>
<v Speaker 5>to just what he would do with his left</v>

425
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.260
<v Speaker 5>foot and just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And He,</v>

426
00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.220
<v Speaker 5>and then he was doing that for all his</v>
<v Speaker 5>teammates because you got so much</v>

427

<v Speaker 5>eye.</v>

432
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:24.650
<v Speaker 5>Twitch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my high school wrestling coach refused</v>

433
00:18:24.651 --> 00:18:26.490
<v Speaker 5>to call baseball sport.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

434
00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:28.800
<v Speaker 5>it's not a sport skill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>skills,</v>

435
00:18:28.801 --> 00:18:30.030
<v Speaker 5>game,</v>
<v Speaker 5>skills game.</v>

436
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.470
<v Speaker 5>But you do have to run,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to run.</v>

437
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:39.120
<v Speaker 5>This is not my favorite sport,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I respect it a lot.</v>

438
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.040
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

439
00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.660
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

440
00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.050
<v Speaker 5>heavy biases from the cups.</v>

441
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.240
<v Speaker 5>I don't know anybody was playing</v>
<v Speaker 5>baseball once they get arrested,</v>

442
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.520
<v Speaker 5>that's a lot of you got to be arrested</v>
<v Speaker 5>or you gonna fuck j Lo.</v>

443
00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:57.450
<v Speaker 5>That's how a lot of people found out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hobby Baez is one of the best defenders</v>

444
00:18:57.451 --> 00:19:01.000
<v Speaker 5>and elite makes incredible plays.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And where you like,</v>

445
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:03.000
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's athletics.</v>

446
00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:04.320
<v Speaker 5>If somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh for sure.</v>

447
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.080
<v Speaker 5>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a lot of skill involved,</v>

448
00:19:07.081 --> 00:19:10.410
<v Speaker 5>but it's definitely it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Definitely athletes.</v>

449
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:11.350
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

450
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.590
<v Speaker 5>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's like there's a big gap between</v>

451
00:19:13.591 --> 00:19:17.430
<v Speaker 5>dad and say like basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you have to be in some extreme</v>

452
00:19:17.431 --> 00:19:18.330
<v Speaker 5>cardio,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

453
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.070
<v Speaker 5>Basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're running back and forth and back</v>

454
00:19:20.071 --> 00:19:23.460
<v Speaker 5>and forth and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those guys are always sore after games</v>

455
00:19:23.461 --> 00:19:25.920
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they got fucking plantar fasciitis and</v>

456
00:19:25.921 --> 00:19:29.280
<v Speaker 5>shoulder issues.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Constant activity is no,</v>

457
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:33.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can be in left field a couple of</v>

458
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.280
<v Speaker 5>minutes and not do anything.</v>

459
00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.800
<v Speaker 5>Just chilling out there with your own</v>
<v Speaker 5>thoughts.</v>

460
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.260
<v Speaker 5>Talking to the fans and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

461
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:45.300
<v Speaker 5>it's none of that in basketball just</v>
<v Speaker 5>standing around except for during free</v>

462
00:19:45.301 --> 00:19:48.660
<v Speaker 5>throws or downtime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But baseball players might go,</v>

463
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.080
<v Speaker 5>especially if the pitcher is killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

464
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:55.020
<v Speaker 5>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just get into your fucking stands</v>

465
00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.790
<v Speaker 5>halfheartedly and.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

466
00:19:56.791 --> 00:19:59.700
<v Speaker 5>it might not be coming out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the other thing about baseball</v>

467
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.400
<v Speaker 5>fans will torture you if you're sitting</v>
<v Speaker 5>out there.</v>

468
00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:05.270
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a long time to be out there on a</v>

469
00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:08.430
<v Speaker 5>away game plus the drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's 18 minutes of action.</v>

470
00:20:08.431 --> 00:20:13.431
<v Speaker 5>Your average major league baseball game,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's like less than one fight.</v>

471
00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:21.930
<v Speaker 5>Eighteen minutes actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's like one championship fight or</v>

472
00:20:21.931 --> 00:20:26.400
<v Speaker 5>less than less than one championship</v>
<v Speaker 5>fight or basically one slash three round</v>

473
00:20:26.401 --> 00:20:28.770
<v Speaker 5>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is 15 minutes of action.</v>

474
00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.260
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We acted like we made a big discovery in</v>

475
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:32.851
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yo.</v>

476
00:20:32.851 --> 00:20:34.170
<v Speaker 5>Baseball borrowing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

477
00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.641
<v Speaker 5>we did it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well.</v>

478
00:20:35.641 --> 00:20:37.920
<v Speaker 5>Baseball is one of those games,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you tried to invent it today,</v>

479
00:20:37.921 --> 00:20:40.520
<v Speaker 5>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get the fuck away from there with DNA.</v>

480
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.700
<v Speaker 5>That shit is definitely old school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the other thing about that 18</v>

481
00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:48.250
<v Speaker 5>minutes of action,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not even action of</v>

482
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:52.000
<v Speaker 3>everybody that's in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody moving at once,</v>

483
00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:57.001
<v Speaker 3>like a football game or basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's maybe three or four people moving</v>

484
00:20:57.131 --> 00:20:59.080
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

485
00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:01.990
<v Speaker 3>depends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually if you turned on the double play</v>

486
00:21:01.991 --> 00:21:04.810
<v Speaker 3>then you know it was a handful of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in.</v>

487
00:21:04.811 --> 00:21:06.940
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty boring.</v>

488
00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.120
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ain't get paid a lot.</v>

489
00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:12.190
<v Speaker 3>A lot of games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's crazy how much money is</v>

490
00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:14.530
<v Speaker 3>involved in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People I get mad,</v>

491
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.890
<v Speaker 3>but it's gone to like Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where else?</v>

492
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:22.980
<v Speaker 3>What other countries adopted baseball</v>
<v Speaker 3>adopted it took it a super popular in</v>

493
00:21:23.351 --> 00:21:24.940
<v Speaker 3>Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know Cuba.</v>

494
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:25.860
<v Speaker 3>Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

495
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:30.870
<v Speaker 3>I take it maybe Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexico on a career.</v>

496
00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

497
00:21:34.241 --> 00:21:35.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just guessing.</v>

498
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:39.340
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing how little interest people</v>
<v Speaker 3>here have for soccer.</v>

499
00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:44.530
<v Speaker 3>That's what's really amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you say a soccer worldwide and see</v>

500
00:21:44.531 --> 00:21:49.531
<v Speaker 3>how little we give a fuck about it here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except those annoying white dudes that</v>

501
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.340
<v Speaker 3>like to get really hyped up about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the World Cup comes around and they</v>

502
00:21:54.341 --> 00:21:56.590
<v Speaker 3>scream and yell at bars like they really</v>
<v Speaker 3>give a fuck.</v>

503
00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:00.610
<v Speaker 3>This reportedly growing belief that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bryce Harper's next contract could be</v>

504
00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:04.150
<v Speaker 3>worth over $400,000,000.</v>

505
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:11.430
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't imagine Jesus just a that</v>
<v Speaker 3>type of a serious scrutiny and attention</v>

506
00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:19.830
<v Speaker 3>on my finances like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian has expectation.</v>

507
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.800
<v Speaker 3>This is not even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not The contract is set yet,</v>

508
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:28.900
<v Speaker 3>but when people are talking about what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might make so much money,</v>

509
00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.760
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too much money,</v>

510
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.800
<v Speaker 3>too much money to be resting over your</v>
<v Speaker 3>head,</v>

511
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:35.710
<v Speaker 3>sink full of hundreds to well say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about.</v>

512
00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it depends on what state he lives</v>

513
00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:41.500
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much money it actually is.</v>

514
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a thing like with floyd</v>

515
00:22:43.961 --> 00:22:45.040
<v Speaker 3>mayweather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

516
00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:49.720
<v Speaker 3>like a big thing about floyd mayweather</v>
<v Speaker 3>is how much money he makes is not just</v>

517
00:22:49.721 --> 00:22:52.330
<v Speaker 3>that he's a great boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that he's going to make</v>

518
00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.970
<v Speaker 3>$300,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently it's going to be even more</v>

519
00:22:54.971 --> 00:22:56.740
<v Speaker 3>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you see the paper view numbers,</v>

520
00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:01.360
<v Speaker 3>they're talking about six point $5,</v>
<v Speaker 3>million pay per view buys,</v>

521
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.080
<v Speaker 3>so it's more than 2 million more than</v>
<v Speaker 3>the manny Pacquiao fight.</v>

522
00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.620
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that include the potential refunds</v>

523
00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:09.700
<v Speaker 3>today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>

524
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:13.510
<v Speaker 3>Well to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did nickname himself money</v>

525
00:23:13.511 --> 00:23:16.300
<v Speaker 3>mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he did after he was pretty boy</v>

526
00:23:16.301 --> 00:23:17.230
<v Speaker 3>floyd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He changed it,</v>

527
00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.050
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he built the persona around.</v>

528
00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:21.760
<v Speaker 3>I spend money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

529
00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.730
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is.</v>

530
00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.790
<v Speaker 3>It's cool and good for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he did make a big thing about</v>

531
00:23:27.791 --> 00:23:31.890
<v Speaker 3>spending money that one time he showed</v>
<v Speaker 3>up like $100,</v>

532
00:23:31.891 --> 00:23:34.680
<v Speaker 3>million dollar check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stupid.</v>

533
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.530
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

534
00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:39.790
<v Speaker 3>why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unlike a regular ass check on a regular</v>

535
00:23:39.791 --> 00:23:44.020
<v Speaker 3>chase bank check.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't even a big cardboard one night</v>

536
00:23:44.021 --> 00:23:45.260
<v Speaker 3>even net or print out</v>

537
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.910
<v Speaker 2>or print it out on a or even a wire or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

538
00:23:49.911 --> 00:23:51.290
<v Speaker 2>I will get that wired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

539
00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:55.790
<v Speaker 2>Laminate that thing is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's really holding onto a $100,000,000</v>

540
00:23:55.791 --> 00:23:58.820
<v Speaker 2>check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was just a regular as check that</v>

541
00:23:58.821 --> 00:24:01.130
<v Speaker 2>you would buy groceries on in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties.</v>

542
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:02.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

543
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.240
<v Speaker 2>That $100 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

544
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:08.820
<v Speaker 2>I guess he wrote it to himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's made with it promotions general</v>

545
00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.310
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

546
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got 100 million and a bank of</v>

547
00:24:13.221 --> 00:24:15.950
<v Speaker 2>America I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it seems like he just holds onto it</v>

548
00:24:15.951 --> 00:24:17.540
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

549
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.280
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't catch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird.</v>

550
00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:21.250
<v Speaker 2>Out of his book bag at one of the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

551
00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.150
<v Speaker 2>but I mean why is he hanging on onto</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

552
00:24:23.151 --> 00:24:27.450
<v Speaker 2>Why did you should probably catch that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was his other account anyways.</v>

553
00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.820
<v Speaker 2>It's mainly where the promotions</v>
<v Speaker 2>account.</v>

554
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:31.400
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the bay where the personal account,</v>

555
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:34.250
<v Speaker 2>the checking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's probably gonna make more than</v>

556
00:24:34.251 --> 00:24:36.920
<v Speaker 2>$300.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Million Dollars from this last fight.</v>

557
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.570
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

558
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.890
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine that they won't do that</v>

559
00:24:42.891 --> 00:24:45.680
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That him and connor won't do it again</v>

560
00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.520
<v Speaker 2>with a wet finger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Konica figure out how to not get tired.</v>

561
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:56.410
<v Speaker 2>If he could convince people like say if</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fights Paulie Malignaggi he's beats</v>

562
00:24:56.411 --> 00:24:59.300
<v Speaker 2>the shit out of Paulie Malignaggi and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then says Freud,</v>

563
00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:04.040
<v Speaker 2>let's do it one more fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think Florida.</v>

564
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:05.060
<v Speaker 2>Nah Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

565
00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:05.930
<v Speaker 2>We did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know,</v>

566
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:09.860
<v Speaker 2>I know he starts thinking about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>money could.</v>

567
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.250
<v Speaker 2>If you could figure out a way to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>people excited about it.</v>

568
00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Connor could get somehow somehow or</v>
<v Speaker 2>another get more people to pay attention</v>

569
00:25:18.561 --> 00:25:21.530
<v Speaker 2>because it was an interesting fight for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first three or four rounds.</v>

570
00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.090
<v Speaker 2>It's made it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He made it look interesting,</v>

571
00:25:23.091 --> 00:25:25.250
<v Speaker 2>but it really wasn't interested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was interesting.</v>

572
00:25:25.251 --> 00:25:27.500
<v Speaker 2>But then when I thought back it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>interested.</v>

573
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.300
<v Speaker 2>Well he caught clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

574
00:25:29.301 --> 00:25:31.010
<v Speaker 2>he caught him with an upper cut in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first round.</v>

575
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Nobody hits fully clean like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lloyd underestimated in my thoughts.</v>

576
00:25:34.791 --> 00:25:38.020
<v Speaker 2>So wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't doing that shoulder roll?</v>

577
00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:39.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>

578
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.850
<v Speaker 2>Because he wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't believe in Conexpo.</v>

579
00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:47.980
<v Speaker 2>So floyd usually boxes anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is when you always see</v>

580
00:25:47.991 --> 00:25:52.430
<v Speaker 2>them boxing that like he blocked Canelo</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he does that and and he goes off of</v>

581
00:25:52.431 --> 00:25:54.560
<v Speaker 2>that counter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's what it was.</v>

582
00:25:54.561 --> 00:25:56.930
<v Speaker 2>I think he knew that conner was going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get tired if he was backing up.</v>

583
00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:02.020
<v Speaker 2>He knows that connor has a endurance</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems and as long as he wasn't</v>

584
00:26:02.271 --> 00:26:04.400
<v Speaker 2>throwing a lot of punches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which floyd wasn't,</v>

585
00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:07.550
<v Speaker 2>and he's constantly faking and moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got connor backing up.</v>

586
00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:10.640
<v Speaker 2>He could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's way easier to be defensive if</v>

587
00:26:10.641 --> 00:26:13.640
<v Speaker 2>you're not being authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're not thinking about hitting</v>

588
00:26:13.641 --> 00:26:15.770
<v Speaker 2>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're constantly like fainting and</v>

589
00:26:15.771 --> 00:26:17.570
<v Speaker 2>you've got your hands up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're moving forward,</v>

590
00:26:17.571 --> 00:26:19.700
<v Speaker 2>but really what you're thinking about is</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he's throwing.</v>

591
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.300
<v Speaker 2>You can get away with a lot and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could press for it a lot more because</v>

592
00:26:23.301 --> 00:26:25.640
<v Speaker 2>you're going to see the punches coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're not really thinking too</v>

593
00:26:25.641 --> 00:26:29.090
<v Speaker 2>much about throwing your own punches</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless he's like a clear wide opening.</v>

594
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:32.840
<v Speaker 2>So for the first couple of rounds he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly like putting pressure on them,</v>

595
00:26:32.841 --> 00:26:35.810
<v Speaker 2>sizing him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I watched it after the fight,</v>

596
00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:38.180
<v Speaker 2>it became way more obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like while you're watching it,</v>

597
00:26:38.181 --> 00:26:39.110
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's gonna Happen?</v>

598
00:26:39.111 --> 00:26:42.650
<v Speaker 2>What's gonna happen once you already</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what's what's happened then.</v>

599
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.190
<v Speaker 2>Then I watched it and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

600
00:26:44.191 --> 00:26:46.470
<v Speaker 2>I could see exactly what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's fainting,</v>

601
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:49.770
<v Speaker 2>putting a lot of pressure on conor and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's making kind of backup a lot,</v>

602
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:53.610
<v Speaker 2>which exists is exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also connor's not very</v>

603
00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:55.080
<v Speaker 2>efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not a boxer.</v>

604
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.310
<v Speaker 2>So like there's a lot of energy being</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasted.</v>

605
00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.870
<v Speaker 2>Like he's going to get tired more easily</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he doesn't run so he doesn't</v>

606
00:27:00.871 --> 00:27:02.640
<v Speaker 2>have the same kind of endurance of floyd</v>
<v Speaker 2>has.</v>

607
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.200
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of factors in there.</v>

608
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:06.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was 111 punches,</v>

609
00:27:06.121 --> 00:27:08.100
<v Speaker 3>but some of them were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

610
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.610
<v Speaker 3>all the ones that connor landed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mean there was a few of them.</v>

611
00:27:11.611 --> 00:27:14.100
<v Speaker 3>They were like little [inaudible] yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

612
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.060
<v Speaker 3>There were also like weird ones like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Patty Patty,</v>

613
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:20.190
<v Speaker 3>patty punches to the side of the head in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the back of the head.</v>

614
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:25.220
<v Speaker 3>This is one main it kind of this and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>just is this box and shit.</v>

615
00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:28.591
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

616
00:27:28.591 --> 00:27:30.420
<v Speaker 3>you get used to that in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

617
00:27:30.421 --> 00:27:33.900
<v Speaker 3>you get used to hammer fists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I think that's what I saw.</v>

618
00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.580
<v Speaker 3>I was talking about the and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people were just wondering if</v>

619
00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:42.210
<v Speaker 3>muscle memory is going to just kick in</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was going to do some weird</v>

620
00:27:42.211 --> 00:27:44.220
<v Speaker 3>information and it did kick it a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit,</v>

621
00:27:44.221 --> 00:27:46.380
<v Speaker 3>but not to the extreme.</v>

622
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there was some massive penalties</v>

623
00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:52.800
<v Speaker 2>for any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if he had any sort of a point</v>

624
00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:55.630
<v Speaker 2>deduction or anything that they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>something illegal.</v>

625
00:27:55.631 --> 00:27:59.130
<v Speaker 2>I think he had a massive penalty more</v>
<v Speaker 2>than a million dollars for each thing.</v>

626
00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:00.370
<v Speaker 2>He fucked up 10</v>

627
00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:02.410
<v Speaker 3>mil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 Mil makes them for each one.</v>

628
00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:07.030
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At that 10 mil makes you get your shit</v>

629
00:28:07.031 --> 00:28:07.864
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

630
00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:09.890
<v Speaker 2>As long as he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get disqualified.</v>

631
00:28:09.891 --> 00:28:13.340
<v Speaker 2>It might be worth it like 10 million for</v>
<v Speaker 2>one fucking needed of the body.</v>

632
00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:16.950
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

633
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:21.720
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know you used to fight until</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the last time I did the podcast.</v>

634
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:25.770
<v Speaker 3>I just thought you have got to work out</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot and just really liked mixed</v>

635
00:28:25.771 --> 00:28:28.590
<v Speaker 3>martial arts and combat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I never fought in mixed martial arts</v>

636
00:28:28.591 --> 00:28:31.440
<v Speaker 3>because he wasn't around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a kickboxing.</v>

637
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did that.</v>

638
00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:33.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I remember just seeing</v>

639
00:28:33.841 --> 00:28:34.980
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody said,</v>

640
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.110
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you talking about rogen like that.</v>

641
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.930
<v Speaker 3>He'll kick you in your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

642
00:28:39.931 --> 00:28:41.790
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I looked up Rogan.</v>

643
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.920
<v Speaker 3>Kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

644
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.650
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This whole time</v>

645
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:49.770
<v Speaker 3>she was kicking the shit out of her</v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

646
00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:50.843
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

647
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:52.860
<v Speaker 3>How'd that feel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

648
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.530
<v Speaker 3>to hit somebody feels weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bag.</v>

649
00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.251
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bags.</v>

650
00:28:56.251 --> 00:28:57.084
<v Speaker 3>Easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

651
00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:00.210
<v Speaker 3>Bags don't hit back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When's the last time you hit somebody</v>

652
00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.080
<v Speaker 2>in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In anger or in a competition?</v>

653
00:29:03.081 --> 00:29:05.390
<v Speaker 2>It's been a long fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was anger.</v>

654
00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.700
<v Speaker 2>Neither one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neither one's in longer.</v>

655
00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.090
<v Speaker 2>Anger and anger is probably a highschool</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold.</v>

656
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:14.150
<v Speaker 2>Competitions when I was 22 or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

657
00:29:14.151 --> 00:29:16.370
<v Speaker 2>that was a taekwondo tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 19 then.</v>

658
00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:20.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was you.</v>

659
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.470
<v Speaker 3>The walk off those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meet with the Walker.</v>

660
00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:26.380
<v Speaker 2>Have you kicked so of the body like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

661
00:29:26.381 --> 00:29:28.970
<v Speaker 2>A spinning back kick to the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much bulletproof.</v>

662
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.600
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just moral protection.</v>

663
00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:36.010
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what was your at that moment when you</v>

664
00:29:36.011 --> 00:29:38.350
<v Speaker 3>saw him laying down and he's dead?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew he was gone,</v>

665
00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:40.230
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

666
00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.990
<v Speaker 3>taken Tam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not getting up.</v>

667
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:43.650
<v Speaker 2>Was it like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

668
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:46.810
<v Speaker 2>you have to walk away and make it look</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's no big deal.</v>

669
00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:50.140
<v Speaker 2>That was how my thought process was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get excited.</v>

670
00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.240
<v Speaker 2>Make lives like this is what I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do to everybody.</v>

671
00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:55.360
<v Speaker 2>Just relax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just walk off and have everybody so</v>

672
00:29:55.361 --> 00:29:56.560
<v Speaker 2>nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't even care.</v>

673
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.120
<v Speaker 2>Like this is just a normal thing for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

674
00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.090
<v Speaker 2>You kick people to go unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fall down,</v>

675
00:30:01.091 --> 00:30:04.630
<v Speaker 2>they can't get up that you gotta have</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people because you're in a</v>

676
00:30:04.631 --> 00:30:06.190
<v Speaker 2>tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to be fighting a bunch</v>

677
00:30:06.191 --> 00:30:08.500
<v Speaker 2>of people and then watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

678
00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:10.180
<v Speaker 2>You might have to fight three or four</v>
<v Speaker 2>times in a day.</v>

679
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Who was there rooting for you to see my</v>
<v Speaker 2>teammates because of the train with no,</v>

680
00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:18.380
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't even seem like even more I</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>

681
00:30:18.381 --> 00:30:20.740
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't really feel like me so long</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

682
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:21.703
<v Speaker 2>Just a hair.</v>

683
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

684
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean I also have a head protector on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back of my hand.</v>

685
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.560
<v Speaker 2>They would wear these a head protectors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either you could wear a full one that</v>

686
00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:32.440
<v Speaker 2>covers your whole head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like over your ears or you were one</v>

687
00:30:32.441 --> 00:30:35.050
<v Speaker 2>that's just the back of your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really just there.</v>

688
00:30:35.051 --> 00:30:37.660
<v Speaker 2>So when you get knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your head doesn't need fucking bounce</v>

689
00:30:37.661 --> 00:30:38.700
<v Speaker 2>off the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

690
00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.750
<v Speaker 2>because we were fighting on a basketball</v>
<v Speaker 2>court.</v>

691
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:43.990
<v Speaker 2>You look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just a wood floor shit.</v>

692
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of that fun on the hockey</v>

693
00:30:46.481 --> 00:30:49.810
<v Speaker 2>rink once where they put a plastic sheet</v>
<v Speaker 2>down on a hockey rink.</v>

694
00:30:49.811 --> 00:30:52.570
<v Speaker 2>So it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the ice but the cement underneath</v>

695
00:30:52.571 --> 00:30:55.060
<v Speaker 2>the hockey rink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we were basically fighting on cement.</v>

696
00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:59.560
<v Speaker 2>So the eighties with terrible is fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>awful bad for brain damage,</v>

697
00:30:59.561 --> 00:31:02.680
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people who got fucked up,</v>

698
00:31:02.681 --> 00:31:04.930
<v Speaker 2>knocked out and bounce their head off</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground.</v>

699
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.490
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw a lot of that.</v>

700
00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for no money,</v>

701
00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.080
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no future,</v>

702
00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:14.170
<v Speaker 2>no future and no money for the love of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the game.</v>

703
00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:17.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it prepares you for life and</v>

704
00:31:17.921 --> 00:31:20.920
<v Speaker 2>also you wanted to find out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to find out how I would.</v>

705
00:31:20.921 --> 00:31:25.030
<v Speaker 2>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to find out what it would be</v>

706
00:31:25.031 --> 00:31:27.700
<v Speaker 2>like to compete under high stress</v>
<v Speaker 2>situations.</v>

707
00:31:27.701 --> 00:31:29.950
<v Speaker 2>Like worrying about someone kicking you</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the face.</v>

708
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:34.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad that most people can't kick</v>

709
00:31:34.601 --> 00:31:38.620
<v Speaker 2>somebody in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm glad that's whatever I go to UFC</v>

710
00:31:38.621 --> 00:31:43.140
<v Speaker 2>fight or even made the ad just whenever</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody gets kicked in the face and if</v>

711
00:31:43.141 --> 00:31:45.220
<v Speaker 2>I got kicked in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you sold disappointed?</v>

712
00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.330
<v Speaker 2>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

713
00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:49.900
<v Speaker 2>It looks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks crazy.</v>

714
00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:51.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible for you.</v>

715
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:55.960
<v Speaker 2>The thing is more people can kick people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the face now than I think at any</v>

716
00:31:55.961 --> 00:31:57.310
<v Speaker 2>other time in human history.</v>

717
00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:01.630
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of fucking people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can kick people in the face now</v>

718
00:32:01.631 --> 00:32:05.500
<v Speaker 2>because of watching MMA and internet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>classes training.</v>

719
00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.650
<v Speaker 2>I think more people training now than.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Than ever before for sure.</v>

720
00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.470
<v Speaker 2>There's way more people that could</v>
<v Speaker 2>strangle people than ever.</v>

721
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:14.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent because the choke is</v>

722
00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:17.800
<v Speaker 2>easier to learn now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just more people doing Jujitsu than</v>

723
00:32:17.801 --> 00:32:19.780
<v Speaker 2>any other time in history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like before,</v>

724
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:24.040
<v Speaker 2>like in my early martial arts days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no one that was doing</v>

725
00:32:24.041 --> 00:32:27.430
<v Speaker 2>grappling really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I wrestled in high school and then</v>

726
00:32:27.431 --> 00:32:31.300
<v Speaker 2>there was no like Jujitsu classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was like you could take judo,</v>

727
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:35.710
<v Speaker 2>like there was judo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was very few like actual</v>

728
00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:38.490
<v Speaker 2>submission grappling schools or anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

729
00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.190
<v Speaker 2>Even nationwide there was a small</v>

730
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:41.810
<v Speaker 4>handful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knew what the fuck they were</v>

731
00:32:41.811 --> 00:32:43.680
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now everywhere you look,</v>

732
00:32:43.681 --> 00:32:47.180
<v Speaker 4>there's a Jujitsu school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I was down in San Diego,</v>

733
00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.370
<v Speaker 4>just San Diego alone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is not a big city.</v>

734
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:51.380
<v Speaker 4>They must have 100 Jujitsu schools</v>

735
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:53.120
<v Speaker 3>just in San Diego.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

736
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.800
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to start sponsoring more</v>

737
00:32:55.801 --> 00:32:56.930
<v Speaker 3>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

738
00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:00.380
<v Speaker 3>Are you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sponsored a and she.</v>

739
00:33:00.381 --> 00:33:01.400
<v Speaker 3>Ms Dot wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

740
00:33:01.401 --> 00:33:02.220
<v Speaker 3>And INVICTA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

741
00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:03.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's going to do more.</v>

742
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.110
<v Speaker 3>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some other people reached out.</v>

743
00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:08.590
<v Speaker 3>I got to just get some new designs for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the club.</v>

744
00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.000
<v Speaker 3>That's what's been holding me back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get some new designs that will.</v>

745
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:15.950
<v Speaker 3>That was an okay design,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I had a mix up like your face on her</v>

746
00:33:15.951 --> 00:33:18.760
<v Speaker 3>ass or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the whole body?</v>

747
00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:20.300
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just last day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

748
00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.370
<v Speaker 3>it was just in case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

749
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:25.340
<v Speaker 3>just in case she got knocked out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fell on her face.</v>

750
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:27.840
<v Speaker 3>Did Hannibal buress I come,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

751
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:31.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could do it in some organizations</v>

752
00:33:31.581 --> 00:33:32.570
<v Speaker 3>still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>

753
00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All over it.</v>

754
00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:38.090
<v Speaker 3>She didn't make weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That didn't make weight.</v>

755
00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.460
<v Speaker 3>I think it's harder for girls to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>weight.</v>

756
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.380
<v Speaker 3>Well she.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well she's.</v>

757
00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:47.410
<v Speaker 3>She's fighting next week at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she was trying to fight at 1:15</v>

758
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:52.460
<v Speaker 3>and she's fighting at 1:25 now or she</v>
<v Speaker 3>was trying to fight.</v>

759
00:33:52.461 --> 00:33:53.600
<v Speaker 3>I think she's trying to fight at one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

760
00:33:53.601 --> 00:33:55.070
<v Speaker 3>five and now fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want either.</v>

761
00:33:55.071 --> 00:33:58.600
<v Speaker 3>Was she cutting much weight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's cutting this weight this time.</v>

762
00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:00.500
<v Speaker 3>That was the other thought about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>conor fight.</v>

763
00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.480
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people thought that connor cut</v>
<v Speaker 3>too much weight.</v>

764
00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.340
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons why I burned</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

765
00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's part of it.</v>

766
00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.680
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does cut a lot of weight and that</v>

767
00:34:09.681 --> 00:34:12.380
<v Speaker 3>does drain your body and it's not like</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he's training,</v>

768
00:34:12.381 --> 00:34:13.970
<v Speaker 3>he's cutting that Wayne because he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

769
00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you only do it once,</v>

770
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:17.930
<v Speaker 3>you do it right before the weigh ins</v>

771
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:20.530
<v Speaker 4>you weigh in and then you put the weight</v>
<v Speaker 4>back on.</v>

772
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:23.500
<v Speaker 4>So all that endurance training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all this hard rounds that you did,</v>

773
00:34:23.890 --> 00:34:26.890
<v Speaker 4>that's not after you're dehydrated</v>

774
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:30.250
<v Speaker 3>yourself severely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your body's not used to operating</v>

775
00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:34.130
<v Speaker 3>exactly that level with this situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

776
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:35.260
<v Speaker 3>well he's used to it</v>

777
00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.750
<v Speaker 4>because he fights in mma like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but mma,</v>

778
00:34:37.751 --> 00:34:40.090
<v Speaker 4>you get more chances to take a break.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get.</v>

779
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:41.140
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's different.</v>

780
00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:42.880
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's more exhausting,</v>

781
00:34:42.881 --> 00:34:46.930
<v Speaker 4>like it could potentially be more</v>
<v Speaker 4>exhausting because there's grappling and</v>

782
00:34:46.931 --> 00:34:50.020
<v Speaker 4>there's kicks and there's just a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>more going on and you're fighting five</v>

783
00:34:50.021 --> 00:34:52.270
<v Speaker 4>minute rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you have more of a chance to get</v>

784
00:34:52.271 --> 00:34:55.870
<v Speaker 4>tired in that five minute rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you clench with someone,</v>

785
00:34:55.871 --> 00:34:58.900
<v Speaker 4>you could actually hold onto them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like referee's not going to break it.</v>

786
00:34:58.901 --> 00:35:01.450
<v Speaker 4>You can take them to the ground and get</v>
<v Speaker 4>on top of them.</v>

787
00:35:01.451 --> 00:35:03.880
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't hold your position and</v>
<v Speaker 4>catch your breath.</v>

788
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:06.220
<v Speaker 4>There's there's more opportunities to</v>
<v Speaker 4>recover.</v>

789
00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:09.470
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At weight cutting is the worst part of</v>

790
00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.340
<v Speaker 3>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent seems.</v>

791
00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:16.850
<v Speaker 3>It was even the fighter that a judge was</v>
<v Speaker 3>opposed to fight that day.</v>

792
00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:23.550
<v Speaker 3>She took a picture of herself and she</v>
<v Speaker 3>made weight,</v>

793
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:27.990
<v Speaker 3>but it looks terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was definitely one.</v>

794
00:35:27.991 --> 00:35:28.411
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five.</v>

795
00:35:28.411 --> 00:35:31.290
<v Speaker 3>Not at our member [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>One 15 wouldn't look crazy,</v>

796
00:35:31.291 --> 00:35:35.030
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it could if you were fine.</v>

797
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:36.870
<v Speaker 3>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>

798
00:35:36.871 --> 00:35:37.800
<v Speaker 3>I waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

799
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:39.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you okay?</v>

800
00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:43.510
<v Speaker 3>It was just a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She put it phone on.</v>

801
00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:44.460
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

802
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.260
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that she tried.</v>

803
00:35:46.261 --> 00:35:48.070
<v Speaker 3>She tried to make wait shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who Cares?</v>

804
00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.950
<v Speaker 3>A few pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I guess those few pounds matter.</v>

805
00:35:49.951 --> 00:35:54.951
<v Speaker 3>Obviously somebody is overweight and</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't go through the strenuous process</v>

806
00:35:56.671 --> 00:35:58.060
<v Speaker 3>that you went to today.</v>

807
00:35:58.350 --> 00:35:59.640
<v Speaker 4>Minute advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

808
00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:01.960
<v Speaker 4>You have an advantage if you're not</v>
<v Speaker 4>dehydrating yourself as much,</v>

809
00:36:01.961 --> 00:36:04.690
<v Speaker 4>but that advantage is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they should stop doing that.</v>

810
00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.630
<v Speaker 4>They really should figure out a way to</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop fighters from cutting weight like</v>

811
00:36:07.631 --> 00:36:09.010
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the alternative?</v>

812
00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:12.730
<v Speaker 4>The alternative is to weigh them like</v>
<v Speaker 4>randomly the same way they catch people</v>

813
00:36:12.731 --> 00:36:17.200
<v Speaker 4>that drugs like when like random drug</v>
<v Speaker 4>tests do random weight tests,</v>

814
00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.210
<v Speaker 4>like they show up and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh Hannah,</v>

815
00:36:19.211 --> 00:36:21.160
<v Speaker 4>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're 175 pounds.</v>

816
00:36:21.161 --> 00:36:23.680
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to be fighting at 1:55.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is that?</v>

817
00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:24.970
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

818
00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:26.500
<v Speaker 4>And then they catch you again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

819
00:36:26.501 --> 00:36:29.760
<v Speaker 4>well you're 176 pounds today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All you're definitely not fighting at</v>

820
00:36:29.761 --> 00:36:31.180
<v Speaker 4>1:55.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they'll,</v>

821
00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:34.180
<v Speaker 4>they'll give you a way parameter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it says it's healthy for you to cut</v>

822
00:36:34.181 --> 00:36:36.220
<v Speaker 4>10 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to fight at one 66.</v>

823
00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:40.240
<v Speaker 4>That's your weight class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it'll force fighters to be more</v>

824
00:36:40.241 --> 00:36:42.070
<v Speaker 4>disciplined about their actual weight.</v>

825
00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:46.090
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't balloon up in between</v>
<v Speaker 4>rounds or in between competition.</v>

826
00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.160
<v Speaker 4>And you're also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

827
00:36:48.161 --> 00:36:51.850
<v Speaker 4>you have to think about how much weight</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could actually dehydrate out of your</v>

828
00:36:51.851 --> 00:36:56.200
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Healthy California has some new Ra laws,</v>

829
00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.900
<v Speaker 4>like they only let you cut a certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of weight.</v>

830
00:36:58.930 --> 00:36:59.630
<v Speaker 4>Like they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

831
00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:02.430
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they periodically measure people like</v>

832
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:05.650
<v Speaker 4>during their camp and give them an</v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity and they measure them during</v>

833
00:37:05.651 --> 00:37:07.350
<v Speaker 4>the camp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And those was one of the reasons I</v>

834
00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.550
<v Speaker 4>hadn't Barao who was the bantamweight</v>
<v Speaker 4>champion.</v>

835
00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:13.360
<v Speaker 4>He fought aljamain sterling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they wouldn't let him fight at 1:35.</v>

836
00:37:13.361 --> 00:37:16.350
<v Speaker 4>They made them fight at 1:40 [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he cut too much weight</v>

837
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.340
<v Speaker 3>catch weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

838
00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:18.330
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

839
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:22.440
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that should be the option for</v>

840
00:37:22.441 --> 00:37:27.360
<v Speaker 3>the crazy fired is just to whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>weight you want to be class,</v>

841
00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:32.610
<v Speaker 3>that'd be one like foot fires that might</v>
<v Speaker 3>not be active on that on the bill.</v>

842
00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:35.340
<v Speaker 3>And we got the spot like guest but the</v>
<v Speaker 3>guest,</v>

843
00:37:35.341 --> 00:37:37.230
<v Speaker 3>but guest by on the comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>somebody just pops up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey pop up fight.</v>

845
00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.720
<v Speaker 3>No matter what the way it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these two fighters,</v>

846
00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:44.980
<v Speaker 3>they whatever the fuck wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to be,</v>

847
00:37:44.981 --> 00:37:48.630
<v Speaker 3>they've agreed to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got this guy coming in and one 65,</v>

848
00:37:48.631 --> 00:37:53.160
<v Speaker 3>this other guy coming in at 2:15.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They agreed to fight each other.</v>

849
00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:54.690
<v Speaker 3>You're cool with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like old school?</v>

850
00:37:54.691 --> 00:37:55.580
<v Speaker 3>UFC One?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

851
00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:57.780
<v Speaker 3>like the old school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not crazy,</v>

852
00:37:57.781 --> 00:38:00.240
<v Speaker 3>you know that sumo wrestler versus you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

853
00:38:00.241 --> 00:38:01.560
<v Speaker 3>100 pound dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

854
00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.410
<v Speaker 4>how much weight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thirty pounds difference like that cat</v>

855
00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:05.363
<v Speaker 4>was the cap.</v>

856
00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.720
<v Speaker 3>I think it's up to late.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leave it up to the person.</v>

857
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:12.790
<v Speaker 3>A guest is the guest spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

858
00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:13.990
<v Speaker 3>lot of</v>

859
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:16.990
<v Speaker 4>people do that in a grappling</v>
<v Speaker 4>tournaments and grappling tournaments.</v>

860
00:38:16.991 --> 00:38:19.870
<v Speaker 4>They have the absolute division and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolute division.</v>

861
00:38:19.871 --> 00:38:21.700
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes the lighter guys when the</v>
<v Speaker 4>whole thing.</v>

862
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:23.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's no hitting.</v>

863
00:38:24.490 --> 00:38:26.230
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing about grappling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

864
00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:29.650
<v Speaker 4>it's like you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get by and skill and technique</v>

865
00:38:29.651 --> 00:38:34.240
<v Speaker 4>and an understanding your positioning</v>
<v Speaker 4>where like know you're fighting a guy</v>

866
00:38:34.241 --> 00:38:36.060
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Francis</v>

867
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:39.970
<v Speaker 2>in Ghana or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a giant 265 pound dude.</v>

868
00:38:39.971 --> 00:38:41.920
<v Speaker 2>If you're 150 pound guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucked.</v>

869
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.080
<v Speaker 2>You're just fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy.</v>

870
00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:47.470
<v Speaker 2>He's what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight something or he's 10 and 1:10 and</v>

871
00:38:47.471 --> 00:38:48.041
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

872
00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:50.290
<v Speaker 2>I think he lost one of his early fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The commission.</v>

873
00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look that they have a 10 point plan to</v>

874
00:38:52.871 --> 00:38:55.210
<v Speaker 2>curb the weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cutting a while.</v>

875
00:38:55.211 --> 00:38:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Protecting fighters now normalized in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the commission's rules are steeper,</v>

876
00:38:59.471 --> 00:39:02.680
<v Speaker 2>fine for missing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait a 10 percent cap on the way to</v>

877
00:39:02.681 --> 00:39:05.490
<v Speaker 2>fighter is allowed to gain between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time the weigh ins.</v>

878
00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:06.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

879
00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.080
<v Speaker 2>And an event,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

880
00:39:08.081 --> 00:39:11.770
<v Speaker 2>and the weight class restrictions for</v>
<v Speaker 2>those who miss weight more than once,</v>

881
00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.140
<v Speaker 2>they also recognized for new weight</v>
<v Speaker 2>classes.</v>

882
00:39:14.141 --> 00:39:16.570
<v Speaker 2>I think that's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have a bunch of weight class.</v>

883
00:39:16.571 --> 00:39:18.430
<v Speaker 2>They should have weight classes every 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds.</v>

884
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:22.570
<v Speaker 2>That Guy Andy Foster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the California State Athletic</v>

885
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:24.070
<v Speaker 2>Commission Executive Director.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the shit.</v>

886
00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:28.630
<v Speaker 2>That guy's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really is the most proactive at of</v>

887
00:39:28.631 --> 00:39:32.470
<v Speaker 2>all of the athletic commission guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's it.</v>

888
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.110
<v Speaker 2>They'll figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They banned the use of [inaudible],</v>

889
00:39:35.111 --> 00:39:39.850
<v Speaker 2>which is interesting too because ivs</v>
<v Speaker 2>help you considerably to rehydrate.</v>

890
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

891
00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:42.900
<v Speaker 2>They banned him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

892
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:45.160
<v Speaker 2>they banned them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want people relying on that</v>

893
00:39:45.161 --> 00:39:50.120
<v Speaker 2>because thirsty</v>
<v Speaker 2>punched fight.</v>

894
00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:55.540
<v Speaker 2>Just all these articles about a Kevin</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doran about talking shit about under</v>

895
00:39:55.541 --> 00:39:56.590
<v Speaker 2>armour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

896
00:39:56.591 --> 00:39:59.640
<v Speaker 2>that crushed their stock yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easy.</v>

897
00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:03.580
<v Speaker 2>It's the trump of basketball shoe</v>
<v Speaker 2>stocks.</v>

898
00:40:03.581 --> 00:40:04.540
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what he did?</v>

899
00:40:04.541 --> 00:40:09.541
<v Speaker 2>He's just like casually commenting about</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how kids will pick schools based on</v>

900
00:40:09.671 --> 00:40:10.451
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

901
00:40:10.451 --> 00:40:11.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

902
00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:12.550
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

903
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:13.880
<v Speaker 2>sneakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have to wear it.</v>

904
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:14.800
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

905
00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started to rent.</v>

906
00:40:16.241 --> 00:40:18.970
<v Speaker 2>Takes a shot at under armor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he just said it and like in a matter</v>

907
00:40:18.971 --> 00:40:19.860
<v Speaker 2>of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a way,</v>

908
00:40:19.861 --> 00:40:21.880
<v Speaker 2>it's like kids don't want to play an</v>
<v Speaker 2>under underarmour.</v>

909
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:23.980
<v Speaker 2>So you look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to play in under armour.</v>

910
00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The top kids don't because they all play</v>

911
00:40:26.551 --> 00:40:31.551
<v Speaker 2>Nike on a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Podcast interview dropped the stock.</v>

912
00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:34.300
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A podcast,</v>

913
00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:38.380
<v Speaker 2>a ringer podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It dropped the stock three percent.</v>

914
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Much money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That must be for a giant company like</v>

915
00:40:42.191 --> 00:40:43.480
<v Speaker 2>under armour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three percent.</v>

916
00:40:43.481 --> 00:40:48.430
<v Speaker 2>That's a billion dollar plus company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three percent is probably tens of</v>

917
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:48.770
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

918
00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Get a bounce back though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much is the,</v>

919
00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:55.210
<v Speaker 2>the actual difference?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh Oh,</v>

920
00:40:55.211 --> 00:40:58.030
<v Speaker 2>it's slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's down 44 percent assessed to start a</v>

921
00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.980
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

922
00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:00.850
<v Speaker 2>that's not good if it's already been</v>
<v Speaker 2>slight.</v>

923
00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of issues with under</v>

924
00:41:05.471 --> 00:41:08.920
<v Speaker 2>armour and hunting too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people think that under armour</v>

925
00:41:08.921 --> 00:41:10.090
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

926
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:14.170
<v Speaker 2>they're worried about their hunting</v>
<v Speaker 2>division because like anti hunters,</v>

927
00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:17.020
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like the only gigantic company</v>

928
00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:22.530
<v Speaker 2>that has the stones to support something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's controversial as hunting.</v>

929
00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:23.950
<v Speaker 2>I haven't been around very long though</v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

930
00:41:23.951 --> 00:41:26.260
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Under armour 15 years.</v>

931
00:41:26.261 --> 00:41:28.990
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

932
00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.300
<v Speaker 2>Like I read that then I think they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the nineties.</v>

933
00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:33.860
<v Speaker 2>I read some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adidas started back long,</v>

934
00:41:33.861 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 2>long</v>

935
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.370
<v Speaker 3>time ago and then two brothers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where Puma started as the two</v>

936
00:41:37.371 --> 00:41:39.260
<v Speaker 3>brothers started due to some boom or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

937
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.550
<v Speaker 3>Or</v>

938
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:43.570

<v Speaker 4>They're just now rebounding from the</v>

<v Speaker 4>Talk about these fighters,</v>

947
00:42:02.561 --> 00:42:03.730
<v Speaker 4>dehydrating yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

948
00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.890
<v Speaker 3>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to live by those rules.</v>

949
00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.380
<v Speaker 3>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in.</v>

950
00:42:07.381 --> 00:42:08.290
<v Speaker 3>Not In this game</v>

951
00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:10.040
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about under armour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

952
00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:10.870
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

953
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:13.870
<v Speaker 4>have a hunting division.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they take a ton of shit because I</v>

954
00:42:13.871 --> 00:42:17.170
<v Speaker 4>know there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of like crowdfunding</v>

955
00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.460
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not crowd funds.</v>

956
00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:22.600
<v Speaker 4>What are those things?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it wasn't a fun thing.</v>

957
00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:26.110
<v Speaker 4>It was a crowd something or another that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going after.</v>

958
00:42:26.111 --> 00:42:28.960
<v Speaker 4>Cameron Hanes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they were calling him a trophy</v>

959
00:42:28.961 --> 00:42:31.270
<v Speaker 4>hunter and they were trying to get under</v>
<v Speaker 4>armour to drop him.</v>

960
00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:35.360
<v Speaker 4>But then you look at like how many</v>
<v Speaker 4>people like their,</v>

961
00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:39.400
<v Speaker 4>their hunting divisions is tiny division</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then under armour itself,</v>

962
00:42:39.401 --> 00:42:42.880
<v Speaker 4>the company is just gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very interesting.</v>

963
00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:46.420
<v Speaker 4>There's not a lot of companies that</v>
<v Speaker 4>would be that big that would support</v>

964
00:42:46.421 --> 00:42:48.520
<v Speaker 4>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Takes a lot of balls.</v>

965
00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:53.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means the CEO is definitely into</v>

966
00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.240
<v Speaker 3>hunting and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is my buddies.</v>

967
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:58.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>

968
00:42:58.331 --> 00:43:01.240
<v Speaker 3>the owners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like you imagine Nike got into</v>

969
00:43:01.241 --> 00:43:02.370
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>

970
00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:06.310
<v Speaker 3>He was in golf with Tiger Woods and</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously he was a gigantic athlete for</v>

971
00:43:06.311 --> 00:43:09.340
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now that he's not out there even</v>

972
00:43:09.341 --> 00:43:11.200
<v Speaker 3>playing golf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the golf division,</v>

973
00:43:11.201 --> 00:43:13.810
<v Speaker 3>I think they just closed it this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they don't even make anything</v>

974
00:43:13.811 --> 00:43:16.480
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll make some clothes for and some</v>

975
00:43:16.481 --> 00:43:18.370
<v Speaker 3>shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're putting golf spikes on the</v>

976
00:43:18.371 --> 00:43:20.670
<v Speaker 3>bottom of Jordan's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like they don't make clubs or</v>

977
00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:23.050
<v Speaker 3>anything anymore I think because what</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Huh.</v>

978
00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:27.320
<v Speaker 3>They just put in golf spikes on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom of just get some of those extra</v>

979
00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:30.220
<v Speaker 3>charges out there from the recalls</v>
<v Speaker 3>section and just talk some spikes on</v>

980
00:43:30.221 --> 00:43:32.530
<v Speaker 3>there and just get them out to the US</v>
<v Speaker 3>Open.</v>

981
00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:36.790
<v Speaker 4>Well we were talking last night about</v>
<v Speaker 4>rappers that get sponsored by shoe</v>

982
00:43:36.791 --> 00:43:39.820
<v Speaker 4>companies at the store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I didn't know that rappers had</v>

983
00:43:39.821 --> 00:43:43.990
<v Speaker 4>contracts with shoe companies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nike announces it will no longer make</v>

984
00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:45.730
<v Speaker 4>golf clubs balls and bags.</v>

985
00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:49.230
<v Speaker 3>You said this and I run DMC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They probably for sure how to contrast.</v>

986
00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:54.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 slash fifty cent and Jay Z had a</v>

987
00:43:54.221 --> 00:43:56.860
<v Speaker 3>commercial wrapping back and forth at</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

988
00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.730
<v Speaker 3>Who else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kanye has his own shoe.</v>

989
00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:01.640
<v Speaker 3>He has his own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He.</v>

990
00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he had it with Nike originally and</v>

991
00:44:03.701 --> 00:44:05.610
<v Speaker 3>then went to adidas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

992
00:44:05.611 --> 00:44:07.960
<v Speaker 3>that's the only rappers or could you</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine if a comic.</v>

993
00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:10.210
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Hart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kevin Hart,</v>

994
00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:13.660
<v Speaker 3>Kevin will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to go to the next absolute</v>

995
00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.870
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stratosphere as a comic or I mean,</v>

996
00:44:16.871 --> 00:44:18.820
<v Speaker 3>unless you really want to do it and do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it on a,</v>

997
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:23.250
<v Speaker 3>on a small artisanal level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you could.</v>

998
00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:24.880
<v Speaker 3>You could do whatever you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

999
00:44:24.881 --> 00:44:27.530
<v Speaker 3>I guess</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a.</v>

1000
00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that rappers get sponsored by companies</v>

1001
00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:33.360
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1002
00:44:33.361 --> 00:44:35.600
<v Speaker 5>like Kendrick Lamar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got a.</v>

1003
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:38.600
<v Speaker 5>Some sort of a shoe company thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Popular Person.</v>

1004
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:39.480
<v Speaker 5>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1005
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.280
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but does that guy work out?</v>

1006
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:46.070
<v Speaker 5>I think Ken's would probably works out</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably because you know what?</v>

1007
00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:50.760
<v Speaker 5>It's certain rappers I could tell that</v>
<v Speaker 5>they work out based on this show.</v>

1008
00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:51.840
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1009
00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.360
<v Speaker 5>because they have energy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well not even just energy,</v>

1010
00:44:54.361 --> 00:44:59.130
<v Speaker 5>but if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if your songs and your lyrics</v>

1011
00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:02.880
<v Speaker 5>are very dense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where your betterment and you wrap it</v>

1012
00:45:02.881 --> 00:45:05.970
<v Speaker 5>up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that takes a lot of breath control and</v>

1013
00:45:05.971 --> 00:45:07.770
<v Speaker 5>cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially if you're not doing it.</v>

1014
00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:10.850
<v Speaker 5>If you don't have a hype man on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you a hype man,</v>

1015
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:15.060
<v Speaker 5>the hype man is someone just isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just the energy is so you can catch a</v>

1016
00:45:15.061 --> 00:45:18.870
<v Speaker 5>breath and so he'll take those last</v>
<v Speaker 5>couple of words on a line and then you</v>

1017
00:45:18.871 --> 00:45:22.800
<v Speaker 5>catch your breath and then you come back</v>
<v Speaker 5>because a lot of people don't have the</v>

1018
00:45:22.801 --> 00:45:23.370
<v Speaker 5>breath control.</v>

1019
00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:25.830
<v Speaker 5>So a lot of times even if somebody is</v>
<v Speaker 5>not ripped,</v>

1020
00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:29.220
<v Speaker 5>they're in shape,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're lungs are in shape.</v>

1021
00:45:29.221 --> 00:45:32.640
<v Speaker 5>If they can do a whole a whole show of</v>
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

1022
00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.740
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of rapid fire songs and shit.</v>

1023
00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.780
<v Speaker 5>I never thought about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A hype man,</v>

1024
00:45:36.781 --> 00:45:37.381
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1025
00:45:37.381 --> 00:45:39.720
<v Speaker 5>That's what the hype man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean as far as it's definitely they</v>

1026
00:45:39.721 --> 00:45:43.620
<v Speaker 5>bring the energy up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of times if you see a rapper</v>

1027
00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:46.530
<v Speaker 5>and at their show and they don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 5>hype man,</v>

1028
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:47.251
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1029
00:45:47.251 --> 00:45:49.830
<v Speaker 5>I could spit my own shit all the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't need a hype man.</v>

1030
00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:51.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1031
00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:53.670
<v Speaker 5>Especially if they're fast with their</v>
<v Speaker 5>lyrics.</v>

1032
00:45:53.671 --> 00:45:55.050
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1033
00:45:55.051 --> 00:45:56.110
<v Speaker 5>And Kendrick does it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1034
00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:59.370
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't wrap over his own beats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a pet peeve of mine,</v>

1035
00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:05.090
<v Speaker 5>a lot of big rappers and they will just</v>
<v Speaker 5>wrap over the song,</v>

1036
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.230
<v Speaker 5>the actual song.</v>

1037
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.380
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>own lip sync.</v>

1038
00:46:09.381 --> 00:46:13.350
<v Speaker 5>And almost pretty much just wrap it over</v>
<v Speaker 5>the shit at their own concert.</v>

1039
00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:18.560
<v Speaker 5>Now get sometimes if a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say you pop up as somebody show to do a</v>

1040
00:46:20.581 --> 00:46:23.010
<v Speaker 5>guest spot as a rapper and you do your</v>
<v Speaker 5>biggest song.</v>

1041
00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:26.040
<v Speaker 5>This person's Dj doesn't have your</v>
<v Speaker 5>instrumental.</v>

1042
00:46:26.041 --> 00:46:28.800
<v Speaker 5>He only has the regular track,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the rap over that.</v>

1043
00:46:28.801 --> 00:46:30.600
<v Speaker 5>But it's just show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to hear you rap over that</v>

1044
00:46:30.601 --> 00:46:33.510
<v Speaker 5>because he was just rapping over as well</v>
<v Speaker 5>produced song.</v>

1045
00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:35.550
<v Speaker 5>I'd rather just hear this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chris being a club,</v>

1046
00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:36.550
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1047
00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:39.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just otherwise you're just seeing their</v>

1048
00:46:39.121 --> 00:46:41.400
<v Speaker 5>presence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just it.</v>

1049
00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:42.780
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1050
00:46:42.781 --> 00:46:44.970
<v Speaker 5>it's still fun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just not when you,</v>

1051
00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:49.530
<v Speaker 5>when you know what the alternative is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is you being a good polished</v>

1052
00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:51.300
<v Speaker 5>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you're like,</v>

1053
00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.760
<v Speaker 5>come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just don't wrap up your shit.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1055
00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:55.950
<v Speaker 5>That's a weird pop thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1056
00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.350
<v Speaker 5>Pop singers are kind of allowed to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1057
00:46:58.450 --> 00:47:00.000
<v Speaker 5>We know they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when they get busted,</v>

1058
00:47:00.001 --> 00:47:02.220
<v Speaker 5>it's a huge deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what was the girl Ashley?</v>

1059
00:47:02.221 --> 00:47:03.054
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nationally,</v>

1060
00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:06.120
<v Speaker 5>Samsung.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a big disaster,</v>

1061
00:47:06.121 --> 00:47:08.580
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She kind of vanished after that for that</v>

1062
00:47:08.581 --> 00:47:10.520
<v Speaker 5>too bad timing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1063
00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.920
<v Speaker 5>She had a show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're trying to ramp her up on on TV.</v>

1064
00:47:13.921 --> 00:47:16.650
<v Speaker 5>Like the diary of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1065

<v Speaker 5>Pulled the plug on that fucker.</v>

1066
00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.180
<v Speaker 5>That's it for her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1067
00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:22.500

<v Speaker 5>Not really.</v>

1068
00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:23.850
<v Speaker 5>Not really round.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

1069
00:47:23.851 --> 00:47:28.350
<v Speaker 5>The party.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was like 15 years ago,</v>

1070
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:29.590

<v Speaker 2>Seventy three.</v>

1114
00:49:32.951 --> 00:49:37.951

<v Speaker 4>smoking and he</v>

<v Speaker 5>Doesn't mean for sure he's gross switch.</v>

1280
00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:14.560
<v Speaker 5>When you think about how many people</v>
<v Speaker 5>have lost every jobs and money because</v>

1281
00:57:14.871 --> 00:57:18.930
<v Speaker 5>of twitter is really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had a situation happened because of</v>

1282
00:57:18.931 --> 00:57:19.600
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but nothing.</v>

1283
00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:23.540
<v Speaker 5>I haven't done any.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't had a stupid as social media</v>

1284
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:27.740
<v Speaker 5>blow up when you're thinking about how</v>
<v Speaker 5>insane it is with that,</v>

1285
00:57:27.741 --> 00:57:32.741
<v Speaker 5>with this is a media where you can</v>
<v Speaker 5>literally control every single word you</v>

1286
00:57:35.091 --> 00:57:40.091
<v Speaker 5>say and you still say some wild shit</v>
<v Speaker 5>that costs you millions of dollars,</v>

1287
00:57:40.791 --> 00:57:42.140
<v Speaker 5>will cost you relationships</v>

1288
00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:45.880
<v Speaker 4>around your friends you don't think</v>
<v Speaker 4>twice about.</v>

1289
00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:49.290
<v Speaker 4>And he said it online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I was going to say about these rich</v>

1290
00:57:49.291 --> 00:57:52.500
<v Speaker 4>women though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that like when you're a wealthy man</v>

1291
00:57:52.501 --> 00:57:55.500
<v Speaker 4>and the woman's not wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that you're wealthy is</v>

1292
00:57:55.501 --> 00:57:59.100
<v Speaker 4>attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then if she marries you,</v>

1293
00:57:59.100 --> 00:57:59.870
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1294
00:57:59.870 --> 00:58:03.470
<v Speaker 5>she's rich to now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now you're just a dude and now you're</v>

1295
00:58:03.471 --> 00:58:06.020
<v Speaker 5>gross,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and now she wants to stay rich.</v>

1296
00:58:06.021 --> 00:58:10.070
<v Speaker 5>So she has just kind of hang in there</v>
<v Speaker 5>and are you talking to me out of getting</v>

1297
00:58:10.071 --> 00:58:10.960
<v Speaker 5>married,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to.</v>

1298
00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:17.540
<v Speaker 5>I always tell people</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one day won't be around one day.</v>

1299
00:58:17.961 --> 00:58:21.200
<v Speaker 5>Marriage won't be a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to take time.</v>

1300
00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:23.540
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I spend my money on,</v>

1301
00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:26.960
<v Speaker 5>I do random,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I was,</v>

1302
00:58:26.961 --> 00:58:30.110
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was caught in a weird Internet</v>

1303
00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:35.150
<v Speaker 5>wormhole last week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was a little high and on some adderall</v>

1304
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:38.960
<v Speaker 5>and I clicked on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And on adderall or high on adderall,</v>

1305
00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:41.360
<v Speaker 5>high on weed and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus,</v>

1306
00:58:41.361 --> 00:58:43.530
<v Speaker 5>what's that like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's great because it's a,</v>

1307
00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:45.650
<v Speaker 5>you have to focus that energy of</v>
<v Speaker 5>adderall,</v>

1308
00:58:45.651 --> 00:58:48.380
<v Speaker 5>but the creativity of week,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>

1309
00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:49.900
<v Speaker 5>that's a good Combo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1310
00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:51.410
<v Speaker 5>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that how you write?</v>

1311
00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:54.980
<v Speaker 5>I was planning to write,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I just took some different times on</v>

1312
00:58:54.981 --> 00:58:57.260
<v Speaker 5>the internet than I would normally take.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should have written,</v>

1313
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:59.540
<v Speaker 5>but it's just when you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you take adderall,</v>

1314
00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:03.230
<v Speaker 5>which is supposed to do is when you take</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1315
00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:08.920
<v Speaker 5>you're supposed to get settled with what</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to work on right away and then</v>

1316
00:59:09.141 --> 00:59:12.290
<v Speaker 5>when it kicks in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you focus in on it versus you know,</v>

1317
00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:16.370
<v Speaker 5>I think when my shit kicked in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just on the Internet so I just</v>

1318
00:59:16.371 --> 00:59:17.960
<v Speaker 5>really dug deep into the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

1319
00:59:17.961 --> 00:59:21.140
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was this article,</v>

01:02:25.921 --> 01:02:29.070
<v Speaker 4>but you really can only drive them 250</v>
<v Speaker 4>miles.</v>

1392
01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:30.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck what they say.</v>

1393
01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.390
<v Speaker 4>And even that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you better be driving slow because if</v>

1394
01:02:33.391 --> 01:02:35.430
<v Speaker 4>you're driving fast or if you drive it</v>
<v Speaker 4>in traffic.</v>

1395
01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:40.700
<v Speaker 4>Like my business manager came out to</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anaheim for the UFC and he drove from a</v>

1396
01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:45.870
<v Speaker 4>Hollywood to Anaheim and his shit was</v>
<v Speaker 4>dead by the time we got to Anaheim.</v>

1397
01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.370
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's traffic.</v>

1398
01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:48.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he,</v>

1399
01:02:48.451 --> 01:02:50.130
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was stuck in traffic and it was no</v>

1400
01:02:50.131 --> 01:02:53.410
<v Speaker 4>like shit on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>off the road he had to find a super</v>

1401
01:02:53.411 --> 01:02:55.800
<v Speaker 4>station.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you got to go sit there for a half an</v>

1402
01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.970
<v Speaker 4>hour at the super station and when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>do that it's fills up to like 75 percent</v>

1403
01:02:59.971 --> 01:03:01.300
<v Speaker 4>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1404
01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:03.230
<v Speaker 4>That part's a little bit while</v>

1405
01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:04.473
<v Speaker 3>drive it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1406
01:03:05.030 --> 01:03:09.740
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'll get a used car that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>practical for the apocalypse.</v>

1407
01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:15.010
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you get like a hybrid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lexus hybrid.</v>

1408
01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:15.681
<v Speaker 4>Hybrid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1409
01:03:15.681 --> 01:03:18.200
<v Speaker 4>Those are the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you can operate.</v>

1410
01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:20.510
<v Speaker 4>I think they have a switch where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could operate.</v>

1411
01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:24.890
<v Speaker 4>I know they have that for the Acura Nsx,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that new NSX.</v>

1412
01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:28.930
<v Speaker 4>They have an all electric mode where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could drive a totally electric call.</v>

1413
01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:30.900
<v Speaker 4>You hit all the switches and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>warmer.</v>

1414
01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:33.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it's super fast.</v>

1415
01:03:34.790 --> 01:03:37.370
<v Speaker 4>Looks fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what A.</v>

1416
01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:38.293
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

1417
01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:39.200
<v Speaker 4>Lexus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lexus.</v>

1418
01:03:39.201 --> 01:03:41.480
<v Speaker 4>Hybrid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a bad ass car to that coop</v>

1419
01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:43.910
<v Speaker 4>because it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's sporty,</v>

1420
01:03:43.911 --> 01:03:47.630
<v Speaker 4>but it's just understated enough where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not driving a Ferrari or a</v>

1421
01:03:47.631 --> 01:03:49.910
<v Speaker 4>porsche or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's bad ass car.</v>

1422
01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:51.390
<v Speaker 4>That one right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That.</v>

1423
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:52.880
<v Speaker 4>What does that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ls.</v>

1427
01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:01.880
<v Speaker 4>of those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that thing.</v>

1428
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.440
<v Speaker 4>That's slick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty slick.</v>

1429
01:04:03.441 --> 01:04:05.910
<v Speaker 4>Good looking car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know what I like about lexuses,</v>

1430
01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:07.910

<v Speaker 4>fucking problem with them.</v>

1433
01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:16.580
<v Speaker 4>Those things just never break.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just drive them.</v>

1434
01:04:16.610 --> 01:04:20.030
<v Speaker 4>They never go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Customer service is fantastic.</v>

1435
01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:25.220
<v Speaker 4>They have the best customer service in</v>
<v Speaker 4>any car I've ever had and they're like</v>

1436
01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:28.280
<v Speaker 4>deer flashy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're not impressing a rapper,</v>

1437
01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.820
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what type of rapper</v>

1438
01:04:30.821 --> 01:04:31.670
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1439
01:04:31.671 --> 01:04:33.840
<v Speaker 4>that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1440
01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:35.940
<v Speaker 4>It was like A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1441
01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:38.260
<v Speaker 4>like de la soul.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'd probably be impressed</v>

1442
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:42.600
<v Speaker 4>young jeezy by looking at the books.</v>

1443
01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:44.420
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did this week,</v>

1444
01:04:44.421 --> 01:04:45.254
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1445
01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:50.120
<v Speaker 3>I donated some money to Red Cross for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Houston thing.</v>

1446
01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:55.270
<v Speaker 3>People get mad at you for that and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remembered right away about the Red</v>

1447
01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:59.150
<v Speaker 3>Cross shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a knee jerk donation and</v>

1448
01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:04.180
<v Speaker 3>donate to the Houston food bank also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I remembered about the shit</v>

1449
01:05:04.911 --> 01:05:09.911
<v Speaker 3>with how they handled the Haiti funds</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Katrina and then I emailed because</v>

1450
01:05:10.611 --> 01:05:12.680
<v Speaker 3>it was through Amazon payments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1451
01:05:12.681 --> 01:05:13.514
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1452
01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:17.290
<v Speaker 3>can I get that money back please?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to just give it to some other</v>

1453
01:05:17.291 --> 01:05:18.520
<v Speaker 3>source.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1454
01:05:18.521 --> 01:05:21.480
<v Speaker 3>did you really asked?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't got a response,</v>

1455
01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:25.210
<v Speaker 3>but it was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was one of the weirdest.</v>

1456
01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.390
<v Speaker 3>Now a top 10 weird emails I've sent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1457
01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:31.680
<v Speaker 3>I asked for a donation back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1458
01:05:31.690 --> 01:05:32.620
<v Speaker 3>that's slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1459
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:35.890
<v Speaker 3>I wanted back though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't because they,</v>

1460
01:05:35.891 --> 01:05:38.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it'd be better for some,</v>

1461
01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

1462
01:05:40.001 --> 01:05:44.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>organizations on the ground is one Texas</v>

1463
01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:49.240
<v Speaker 3>the Texas diaper because everybody need</v>
<v Speaker 3>diapers and they're based in San</v>

1464
01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:49.240
<v Speaker 3>Antonio.</v>

1465
01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:54.240
<v Speaker 3>So you can just sit and I just went on</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazon and just sent a grand worth of</v>

1466
01:05:54.781 --> 01:05:59.020
<v Speaker 3>diapers just because that made me feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>good because it's super specific and you</v>

1467
01:05:59.021 --> 01:06:01.720
<v Speaker 3>can't really get to fraudulent with</v>
<v Speaker 3>diapers.</v>

1468
01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:03.820
<v Speaker 3>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way of looking at it.</v>

1469
01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:06.430
<v Speaker 3>Like with product you just send the</v>
<v Speaker 3>product.</v>

1470
01:06:06.431 --> 01:06:09.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe somebody worst case</v>
<v Speaker 3>scenario somebody steals it,</v>

1471
01:06:09.281 --> 01:06:12.550
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part if you send in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthful product,</v>

1472
01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:15.340
<v Speaker 3>that money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit is getting broken up.</v>

1473
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:18.820
<v Speaker 3>Some of that should go on to the morgue</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some of that shit go to like ink.</v>

1474
01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird because I guess affective</v>

1475
01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:25.200
<v Speaker 4>charities have operating costs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way to.</v>

1476
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:27.800
<v Speaker 4>People got to get back to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People have to get paid,</v>

1477
01:06:27.810 --> 01:06:32.810
<v Speaker 4>you have to pay for logistics and</v>
<v Speaker 4>planning and and the Red Cross obviously</v>

1478
01:06:33.741 --> 01:06:35.630
<v Speaker 4>does a lot of good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>

1479
01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:37.370
<v Speaker 4>no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do a lot of good and people just</v>

1480
01:06:37.371 --> 01:06:40.070
<v Speaker 4>get mad at the accounting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how much of the money goes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>j.</v>

1492
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:11.760
<v Speaker 3>j.</v>
<v Speaker 3>j watt has one.</v>

1493
01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:16.220

<v Speaker 3>Texas is a few other ones that are on</v>

1494
01:07:16.221 --> 01:07:21.221
<v Speaker 3>the ground and in Houston or in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the area where red crosses,</v>

1495
01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:26.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there obviously I know they have</v>

1496
01:07:26.691 --> 01:07:29.810
<v Speaker 3>people on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's pretty general.</v>

1497
01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:30.721
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1498
01:07:30.721 --> 01:07:34.740
<v Speaker 4>they handle a lot of different things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they do a lot of good to like,</v>

1499
01:07:34.741 --> 01:07:37.230
<v Speaker 4>there's no denying that the Red Cross</v>
<v Speaker 4>does a lot of good,</v>

1500
01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.060
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's that whole accounting thing when</v>

1501
01:07:40.061 --> 01:07:41.490
<v Speaker 4>people get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's funny man,</v>

1502
01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:44.040
<v Speaker 4>because there's a lot of people just</v>
<v Speaker 4>waiting to get mad at something.</v>

1503
01:07:44.041 --> 01:07:46.110
<v Speaker 4>Even get mad at where you're donating</v>
<v Speaker 4>your money.</v>

1504
01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:51.160
<v Speaker 3>Well I think it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the issue is that from the</v>

1505
01:07:51.951 --> 01:07:55.910
<v Speaker 3>little research I did on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Red Cross hasn't had full</v>

1506
01:07:55.911 --> 01:08:00.911
<v Speaker 3>transparency with how I think people</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to know if you give a dollar to Red</v>

1507
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:07.120
<v Speaker 3>Cross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what percentage goes to this weapon</v>

1508
01:08:07.121 --> 01:08:10.430
<v Speaker 3>centers goes to this episode,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this goes to this and I don't think they</v>

1509
01:08:10.431 --> 01:08:13.670
<v Speaker 3>offer that and that makes people feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're getting shysters.</v>

1510
01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:16.880
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that's because they've been</v>
<v Speaker 4>around so long to like Red Cross has</v>

1511
01:08:16.881 --> 01:08:20.000
<v Speaker 4>been around for like how many years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred years.</v>

1512
01:08:20.001 --> 01:08:20.840
<v Speaker 4>Probably something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1513
01:08:20.841 --> 01:08:24.440
<v Speaker 4>And it wasn't until the Internet came</v>
<v Speaker 4>along that these questions even came up,</v>

1514
01:08:24.441 --> 01:08:27.230
<v Speaker 4>but that people demanded transparency</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably want to.</v>

1515
01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:32.540
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just because they haven't</v>
<v Speaker 3>been that many results from the Haiti</v>

1516
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:36.500
<v Speaker 3>earthquake where people don't see</v>
<v Speaker 3>tangible results.</v>

1517
01:08:36.501 --> 01:08:41.220
<v Speaker 3>And I know I donated a bunch on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>phone texting to,</v>

1518
01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:42.340
<v Speaker 3>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1519
01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:45.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why clef was doing Red</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cross thing if he was doing something</v>

1520
01:08:45.741 --> 01:08:48.560
<v Speaker 3>separate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I texted a lot just donate when that</v>

1521
01:08:48.561 --> 01:08:51.020
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think it's just when people</v>

1522
01:08:51.021 --> 01:08:53.840
<v Speaker 3>don't see results for the money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like,</v>

1523
01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:54.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to,</v>

1524
01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:57.670
<v Speaker 3>especially if you just try to help</v>
<v Speaker 3>something in that,</v>

1525
01:08:57.671 --> 01:09:02.671
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what makes it worse for</v>
<v Speaker 3>people where if you try to help and you</v>

1526
01:09:03.711 --> 01:09:07.880
<v Speaker 3>donated money to help and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>really see the results of it,</v>

1527
01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:08.960
<v Speaker 3>then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

1528
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:11.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Haiti things,</v>

1529
01:09:11.850 --> 01:09:15.930
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like the infrastructure was</v>
<v Speaker 4>so fucked up and there was so much</v>

1530
01:09:15.931 --> 01:09:20.820
<v Speaker 4>damage done down there that you would</v>
<v Speaker 4>need untold billions of dollars to fix</v>

1531
01:09:20.821 --> 01:09:23.310
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like when you donate millions,</v>

1532
01:09:23.311 --> 01:09:25.170
<v Speaker 4>it's like barely even going to see any</v>
<v Speaker 4>results.</v>

1533
01:09:25.171 --> 01:09:28.350
<v Speaker 4>Like I wonder how much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much damage was actually done to</v>

1534
01:09:28.351 --> 01:09:30.420
<v Speaker 4>hate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to wonder about Houston.</v>

1535
01:09:30.610 --> 01:09:34.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're talking about Houston</v>
<v Speaker 4>being just catastrophic to the point</v>

1536
01:09:34.441 --> 01:09:36.150
<v Speaker 4>where some places are never going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>recover</v>

1537
01:09:36.610 --> 01:09:39.510
<v Speaker 3>is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is pretty messed up.</v>

1538
01:09:39.511 --> 01:09:41.020
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's raining right now.</v>

1539
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:46.510
<v Speaker 3>Still raining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were saying how about how the</v>

1540
01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:53.880
<v Speaker 3>constant development that they've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing there was part of the reason why</v>

1541
01:09:54.611 --> 01:09:59.611
<v Speaker 3>the flood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it hit harder because they developed on</v>

1542
01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:04.170
<v Speaker 3>prairie grass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so certain land where this land might</v>

1543
01:10:04.171 --> 01:10:07.660
<v Speaker 3>have soaked up some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we probably would have still</v>

1544
01:10:07.661 --> 01:10:11.500
<v Speaker 3>flooded but it might have been less</v>
<v Speaker 3>severe if there wasn't needs because the</v>

1545
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:13.420
<v Speaker 3>next is a new development.</v>

1546
01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:15.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw that where they're saying that by</v>

1547
01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:17.810
<v Speaker 4>paving over these areas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

1548
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:19.650
<v Speaker 4>those areas can no longer absorb the</v>
<v Speaker 4>water.</v>

1549
01:10:19.651 --> 01:10:21.910
<v Speaker 4>But it seems like you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

1550
01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:25.050
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever see the graphic that shows</v>
<v Speaker 4>the difference between the amount of</v>

1551
01:10:25.051 --> 01:10:28.650
<v Speaker 4>water that rained down on Hurricane</v>
<v Speaker 4>Katrina versus the amount of water that</v>

1552
01:10:28.651 --> 01:10:32.280
<v Speaker 4>rained down so far on harvey?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not even including today.</v>

1553
01:10:32.281 --> 01:10:33.900
<v Speaker 4>And it's going to rain apparently</v>
<v Speaker 4>tomorrow too.</v>

1554
01:10:33.901 --> 01:10:35.480
<v Speaker 4>I think shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1555
01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:39.990
<v Speaker 4>it's so much more water than.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could you look at the difference for 10</v>

1556
01:10:39.991 --> 01:10:44.520
<v Speaker 4>to 15 trillion gallons as of August</v>
<v Speaker 4>28th.</v>

1557
01:10:44.521 --> 01:10:45.870
<v Speaker 4>And what is today?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The 29th,</v>

1558
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:48.000
<v Speaker 4>the 30th.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Today's the 30th.</v>

1559
01:10:48.150 --> 01:10:52.740
<v Speaker 4>So that's two days ago of rain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then Katrina is only six point 5</v>

1560
01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:53.431
<v Speaker 4>trillion gallons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1561
01:10:53.431 --> 01:10:54.360
<v Speaker 4>that's amazing.</v>

1562
01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:57.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm sure there's people that</v>

1563
01:10:57.510 --> 01:11:01.080
<v Speaker 3>dedicate their lives to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how do you count that they're out</v>

1564
01:11:01.081 --> 01:11:05.300
<v Speaker 3>there with scoops?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Measuring is in cubic.</v>

1565
01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:09.030
<v Speaker 3>Come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on man.</v>

1566
01:11:09.031 --> 01:11:11.460
<v Speaker 3>Beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beyond like oil drums.</v>

1567
01:11:11.461 --> 01:11:12.294
<v Speaker 3>You really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1568
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:14.280
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many really know?</v>

1569
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:19.790
<v Speaker 3>It definitely looks like a lot and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>hope it seems like a of water is all</v>

1570
01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:20.920
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1571
01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:21.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you know,</v>

1572
01:11:22.090 --> 01:11:25.720
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that I love about</v>
<v Speaker 4>tragedies is when people come together</v>

1573
01:11:25.721 --> 01:11:29.260
<v Speaker 4>and help each other out and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>things is liver is a line of fishing</v>

1574
01:11:29.261 --> 01:11:32.680
<v Speaker 4>boats of dudes pulling fishing boats to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go and rescue people.</v>

1575
01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:36.970
<v Speaker 4>It was like a whole line on the highway</v>
<v Speaker 4>of dudes with trucks pulling fishing</v>

1576
01:11:36.971 --> 01:11:41.320
<v Speaker 4>boats and they were dropping them off</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they were driving their boat rather</v>

1577
01:11:41.321 --> 01:11:45.780
<v Speaker 4>ride in their boat down these flooded</v>
<v Speaker 4>roads and rescuing people and bringing</v>

1578
01:11:45.781 --> 01:11:48.940
<v Speaker 4>them to safety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That kind of shit makes me so happy.</v>

1579
01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:50.980
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the fucked up things about</v>
<v Speaker 4>people's.</v>

1580
01:11:50.981 --> 01:11:55.420
<v Speaker 4>Like sometimes a bad thing makes people</v>
<v Speaker 4>see the good in people.</v>

1581
01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:57.070
<v Speaker 4>It makes people do good things,</v>

1582
01:11:57.230 --> 01:11:59.090
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how,</v>

1583
01:11:59.870 --> 01:12:04.870
<v Speaker 3>how insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the juxtaposition.</v>

1584
01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:10.300
<v Speaker 3>Does that have to be to like you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>your crib as watching a show on Sunday,</v>

1585
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:12.520
<v Speaker 3>relaxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1586
01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:17.810
<v Speaker 3>frat and then a few days later you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be saved by boat</v>

1587
01:12:19.330 --> 01:12:20.950
<v Speaker 3>from this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from this,</v>

1588
01:12:21.010 --> 01:12:24.130
<v Speaker 3>from this place where you usually just</v>
<v Speaker 3>walk out and get the mail.</v>

1589
01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:28.240
<v Speaker 3>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody has to pull up with a boat.</v>

1590
01:12:28.330 --> 01:12:30.810
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said it's okay</v>

1591
01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:35.470
<v Speaker 4>once every 500 year storm too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But how the fuck do they known that 500</v>

1592
01:12:35.471 --> 01:12:38.080
<v Speaker 4>years ago people wrote shit down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Park,</v>

1593
01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1594
01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:42.610
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they showed like raindrops and skulls.</v>

1595
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:46.790
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People House saved her with a jet ski.</v>

1596
01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.570
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1597
01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:50.030
<v Speaker 3>that's is</v>

1598
01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:53.440
<v Speaker 4>my friend's grandmother being jet skied</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of her living room in Houston.</v>

1599
01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:56.580
<v Speaker 4>What about y'all though?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What A.</v>

1600
01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:57.730
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That house is fucked.</v>

1601
01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:00.990
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of fucked houses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You other thing about Houston too,</v>

1602
01:13:00.991 --> 01:13:04.070
<v Speaker 4>is Houston so damp like Houston in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>summertime,</v>

1603
01:13:04.071 --> 01:13:06.700
<v Speaker 4>it's so moist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That means they're going to have crazy</v>

1604
01:13:06.701 --> 01:13:09.790
<v Speaker 4>mold growth there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mold is going to be off the charts and</v>

1605
01:13:09.791 --> 01:13:12.690
<v Speaker 4>that shit makes people sick as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like A.</v>

1606
01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.790
<v Speaker 4>I've had a friend in Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his whole,</v>

1607
01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:18.250
<v Speaker 4>his house had to be gutted because he</v>
<v Speaker 4>was getting sick and they couldn't</v>

1608
01:13:18.251 --> 01:13:22.270
<v Speaker 4>figure out what was wrong and they came</v>
<v Speaker 4>in and did some sort of a test of the</v>

1609
01:13:22.271 --> 01:13:23.430
<v Speaker 4>air and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

1610
01:13:23.431 --> 01:13:27.660
<v Speaker 4>you're house is infested.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they broke down his walls and</v>

1611
01:13:27.710 --> 01:13:31.360
<v Speaker 4>apparently there was some pipe leakage</v>
<v Speaker 4>or something inside the wall and then</v>

1612
01:13:31.361 --> 01:13:36.060
<v Speaker 4>just the general moisture of the air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The entire walls were filled with this</v>

1613
01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:38.170
<v Speaker 4>black mold and it was getting everybody</v>
<v Speaker 4>sick.</v>

1614
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:40.460
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit is girls.</v>

1615
01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:41.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mold is no,</v>

1616
01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:42.870
<v Speaker 4>no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1617
01:13:42.871 --> 01:13:47.310
<v Speaker 4>That black mold stuff can really fuck</v>

1685
01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.200
<v Speaker 5>Because it was a.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I mean I got it as an investment</v>
<v Speaker 5>property.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Frugal is the</v>

1693

1697
01:17:18.771 --> 01:17:20.900
<v Speaker 5>generating any income doesn't do anybody</v>
<v Speaker 5>any good.</v>

1698
01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:23.370
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely not.</v>

<v Speaker 3>do and so she hands me her phone and I</v>

<v Speaker 3>you gotta go give your number though.</v>

1719
01:18:34.530 --> 01:18:37.520

<v Speaker 3>I'm an oji in this game.</v>

1720
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.340

<v Speaker 5>you didn't give her your number because</v>

1723
01:18:47.371 --> 01:18:50.580

1732
01:19:15.210 --> 01:19:16.650
<v Speaker 3>It was suit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm like,</v>

1733
01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:17.580
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1734
01:19:17.581 --> 01:19:19.040
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1735
01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:19.970
<v Speaker 3>and it's so</v>

1736
01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:22.760
<v Speaker 5>goes on about that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but with the antibiotic for how long</v>

1737
01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:25.460
<v Speaker 5>that long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then she tried to continue the</v>

1738
01:19:25.461 --> 01:19:29.600
<v Speaker 5>conversation after.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's obvious that her vibe haS changed.</v>

1739
01:19:29.601 --> 01:19:30.710
<v Speaker 5>When I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she went from,</v>

1740
01:19:30.970 --> 01:19:34.400
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was that enough today to a very dry.</v>

1741
01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:35.533
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

1742
01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:38.450
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she continued the conversation.</v>

1743
01:19:39.170 --> 01:19:42.020
<v Speaker 5>That's not good in this kind of drive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Weird,</v>

1744
01:19:42.021 --> 01:19:43.370
<v Speaker 5>wet what she said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1745
01:19:43.371 --> 01:19:46.670
<v Speaker 5>so you're about to go on this tour with</v>
<v Speaker 5>nas and lauryn hill,</v>

1746
01:19:46.671 --> 01:19:48.290
<v Speaker 5>how do you approach the shows</v>
<v Speaker 5>differently?</v>

1747
01:19:48.291 --> 01:19:50.860
<v Speaker 5>But it's obvious that she just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>asking them so that you,</v>

1748
01:19:51.170 --> 01:19:52.190
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I was.</v>

1749
01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:53.163
<v Speaker 5>So I didn't,</v>

1750
01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:56.440
<v Speaker 3>I answered it and then she pulls out her</v>
<v Speaker 3>phone and she was like,</v>

1751
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:59.050
<v Speaker 3>oh my friends over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1752
01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:00.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

1753
01:20:00.401 --> 01:20:01.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

1754
01:20:03.370 --> 01:20:05.460
<v Speaker 3>she like goes like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

1755
01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:07.640
<v Speaker 3>And then I'll just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1756
01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:10.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just walked off somewhere else.</v>

1757
01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:15.770
<v Speaker 3>But then it was such a weird experience</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the comedian in me was hoping she</v>

1758
01:20:17.941 --> 01:20:22.941
<v Speaker 3>was doing some weird andy kaufman bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that intense,</v>

1759
01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:25.230
<v Speaker 3>it was just super weird because</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody was.</v>

1760
01:20:25.530 --> 01:20:27.180
<v Speaker 3>EveryboDy else was really chill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1761
01:20:27.190 --> 01:20:31.740
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't even having any network and</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussions with people like that there</v>

1762
01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.680
<v Speaker 3>and everybody else was really chill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't lIke talking to other people</v>

1763
01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.680
<v Speaker 3>that did that really happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I saw her later,</v>

1764
01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:42.240
<v Speaker 3>like a couple of hours later I said was</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you doing a bit.</v>

1765
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:47.270
<v Speaker 3>Was that again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she tried to play it like she</v>

1766
01:20:48.851 --> 01:20:49.900
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I could tell she was like,</v>

1767
01:20:49.901 --> 01:20:52.080
<v Speaker 3>I had to check,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you check me for what?</v>

1768
01:20:53.130 --> 01:20:57.520
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she was really into collecting</v>

1769
01:20:57.521 --> 01:20:59.280
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what she's really also,</v>

1770
01:20:59.350 --> 01:21:04.350
<v Speaker 3>she was a interacted with me based on</v>
<v Speaker 3>who else she's dealt with in her past</v>

1771
01:21:05.831 --> 01:21:08.740
<v Speaker 3>versus just interacted with me as an</v>
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>

1772
01:21:08.741 --> 01:21:13.741
<v Speaker 3>So she was just super salty and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>just so ironic that at this beautiful</v>

1773
01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:20.940
<v Speaker 3>black festival,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only person beIng weird backstage is</v>

1774
01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:24.190
<v Speaker 3>a white woman in her forties.</v>

1775
01:21:25.210 --> 01:21:30.210
<v Speaker 4>Taking that as a sign of disrespect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was crazy and you must've felt like</v>

1776
01:21:30.461 --> 01:21:31.780
<v Speaker 4>as soon as she said that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1777
01:21:31.781 --> 01:21:33.340
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this definitely was the right move.</v>

1778
01:21:33.341 --> 01:21:35.470
<v Speaker 4>Not to give you my number because you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking crazy.</v>

1779
01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:38.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just more like I was wondering</v>

1780
01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:39.910
<v Speaker 3>now then after I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was mine</v>

1781
01:21:41.450 --> 01:21:44.560
<v Speaker 3>because sometimes I give,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I give random people my number out,</v>

1782
01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:47.590
<v Speaker 3>have like random I've given,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know what.</v>

1783
01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:49.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe something that instinct,</v>

1784
01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:54.300
<v Speaker 3>he knew it just gave it to her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've given people in my email before</v>

1785
01:21:54.301 --> 01:21:55.410
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was just,</v>

1786
01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.410
<v Speaker 3>it was just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially since I was super high,</v>

1787
01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:59.303
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1788
01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:01.580
<v Speaker 4>well see the thing is for business</v>
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>

1789
01:22:01.581 --> 01:22:05.090
<v Speaker 4>email's the best way to contact people</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you can 100 percent or you can</v>

1790
01:22:05.091 --> 01:22:06.770
<v Speaker 4>email somebody at three in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's nothing.</v>

1791
01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:07.191
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1792
01:22:07.191 --> 01:22:09.560
<v Speaker 4>Not only that you can like if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1793

<v Speaker 4>for this thing in february between</v>

<v Speaker 4>at my calendar first.</v>

1796

<v Speaker 4>we.</v>

1800
01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:24.410
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's clear.</v>

1801
01:22:24.411 --> 01:22:27.110
<v Speaker 4>It's more having a conversation over the</v>
<v Speaker 4>phone that I got to remember.</v>

1802
01:22:27.111 --> 01:22:28.760
<v Speaker 4>I've got to write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>

1803
01:22:28.761 --> 01:22:31.820
<v Speaker 4>Let me get a piece of paper or let me</v>
<v Speaker 4>dictate it into my phone.</v>

1804
01:22:31.821 --> 01:22:35.170
<v Speaker 4>Like that's less effective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially.</v>

1805
01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:41.140
<v Speaker 4>It was fucking bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a crazy man.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I've met men and women that do that.</v>

1808
01:22:45.801 --> 01:22:47.690
<v Speaker 4>They want your number.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then if you don't want to give him your</v>

1809
01:22:47.770 --> 01:22:48.860
<v Speaker 4>number,</v>

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.380

1811
01:22:51.381 --> 01:22:52.970
<v Speaker 4>the very reason why I don't want to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>my number.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And also it came out</v>

01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:21.700
<v Speaker 3>the joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1842
01:24:27.881 --> 01:24:32.170
<v Speaker 3>central tv show.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It back by.</v>

1845
01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:47.500

<v Speaker 3>the premier announced by a month or two</v>

1846
01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:52.870
<v Speaker 3>because it was that and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so even though I had my comedy central</v>

1847
01:24:52.871 --> 01:24:57.871
<v Speaker 3>deal in place this since 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had an all around comedy central deal</v>

1848
01:24:58.301 --> 01:25:00.520
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then when that came out and then I</v>

1849
01:25:00.521 --> 01:25:04.900
<v Speaker 3>got my show with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then my show was scheduled to go on</v>

1850
01:25:04.901 --> 01:25:05.230
<v Speaker 3>the air.</v>

1851
01:25:05.230 --> 01:25:06.120
<v Speaker 3>It looked like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1852
01:25:06.121 --> 01:25:08.170
<v Speaker 3>he did the cosmic joke and then he got a</v>
<v Speaker 3>tv show.</v>

1853
01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:09.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no man,</v>

1854

<v Speaker 3>this is like my fourth development deal</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is finally to show that I got.</v>

1855
01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:19.880
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that funny how things work here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

1856
01:25:19.881 --> 01:25:23.620
<v Speaker 3>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the thing where instead of,</v>

1857
01:25:23.710 --> 01:25:27.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instead of just having this show that I</v>

1858
01:25:27.581 --> 01:25:30.640
<v Speaker 3>was able to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was this energy around it,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and 2005 july or early 2005.</v>

1860
01:25:35.211 --> 01:25:40.211
<v Speaker 3>It was this energy around it where if I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was going to do press around that time,</v>

1861
01:25:40.571 --> 01:25:42.640
<v Speaker 3>they were definitely gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What year was it?</v>

<v Speaker 3>it just kind of really affected the</v>

1868
01:25:57.070 --> 01:26:02.070
<v Speaker 3>energy around it and as far and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and my m one and an eagerness to do a</v>

1871
01:26:12.650 --> 01:26:16.820

<v Speaker 3>If you like,</v>

1877
01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:32.810

<v Speaker 3>task to do.</v>

1881
01:26:42.291 --> 01:26:43.400
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like just the,</v>

1884
01:26:49.190 --> 01:26:53.330
<v Speaker 3>four month period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was never bored during that time</v>

1885
01:26:53.450 --> 01:26:54.920
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I do movies,</v>

1886
01:26:54.930 --> 01:26:59.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm hellebore yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like movie just because it's no</v>

1887
01:27:00.111 --> 01:27:01.640
<v Speaker 3>use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just sit arOund and you go say some</v>

1888
01:27:01.641 --> 01:27:03.080
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like baseball.</v>

1889
01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:05.750
<v Speaker 3>It's baseball.</v>

1890
01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.370
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you talk about a 12 hour day that you</v>

1891
01:27:10.371 --> 01:27:13.160
<v Speaker 3>spend on a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot is actually for me,</v>

1892
01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:19.180
<v Speaker 3>45 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an hour of actual acting and shit and I</v>

1893
01:27:20.661 --> 01:27:25.661
<v Speaker 3>mean with me maybe 10 minutes of actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>acting because I'm not a good actor at</v>

1894
01:27:25.851 --> 01:27:27.020
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying words,</v>

1895
01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:29.720
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just shit.</v>

1896
01:27:29.721 --> 01:27:33.170
<v Speaker 3>It's just mind numbingly boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the finished product,</v>

1897
01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:36.590
<v Speaker 3>the finished product is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cool to see and it's dope to be a</v>

1898
01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:37.910
<v Speaker 3>product,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're doing it.</v>

1899
01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:39.980
<v Speaker 3>The director has a lot to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1900
01:27:39.981 --> 01:27:44.010
<v Speaker 3>he's moving around and he got a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit to do and so he might yet.</v>

1901
01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:46.100
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1902
01:27:46.101 --> 01:27:47.900
<v Speaker 3>doing that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's boring.</v>

1903
01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:49.970
<v Speaker 3>It's very boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no other way to do it though.</v>

1904
01:27:49.971 --> 01:27:53.130
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it's always that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1905
01:27:53.131 --> 01:27:57.860
<v Speaker 3>I think it depends on the budget of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they got money to burn,</v>

1906
01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:03.380
<v Speaker 3>then they got time to burn also doing an</v>
<v Speaker 3>indie movie,</v>

1907
01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:05.560
<v Speaker 3>then they ain't going to keep it going.</v>

1908
01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.300
<v Speaker 3>Gonna keep that shit moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then yeah,</v>

1909
01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:12.960
<v Speaker 3>if you're doing a at this one movie band</v>
<v Speaker 3>of robbers that's on netflix and it was</v>

1910
01:28:13.791 --> 01:28:14.630
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1911
01:28:14.631 --> 01:28:15.950
<v Speaker 3>we were active.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

1912
01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:21.410
<v Speaker 3>It's a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's time sawyer and huckleberry finn,</v>

1913
01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:23.210
<v Speaker 3>but in real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in real time,</v>

1914
01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:26.330
<v Speaker 3>like in current time.</v>

1916
01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:32.870
<v Speaker 3>it played a few scenes in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was quick.</v>

1917
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:34.880
<v Speaker 3>It was no wasted days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1918
01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:36.440
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you go to a movie set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

1930
01:29:08.190 --> 01:29:09.240
<v Speaker 3>Who planned this out</v>

1931
01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:13.000
<v Speaker 2>now when you were doing a tv show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many months ago?</v>

1932
01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:15.410
<v Speaker 2>You said it for like four months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1933
01:29:16.530 --> 01:29:19.200
<v Speaker 3>eight episodes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's two months of shooting and then</v>

1934
01:29:19.650 --> 01:29:22.830
<v Speaker 3>a month or a couple months of pre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pro?</v>

1935
01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:24.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And do you,</v>

1936
01:29:24.650 --> 01:29:26.370
<v Speaker 3>you enjoyed it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did enjoy.</v>

1937
01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:27.210
<v Speaker 3>I Just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1938
01:29:27.210 --> 01:29:28.600
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to do a.</v>

1939
01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:32.430
<v Speaker 3>I'll probably do something on tv next</v>
<v Speaker 3>year again to a show once I get the idea</v>

1940
01:29:32.431 --> 01:29:34.320
<v Speaker 3>right and figure out exactly.</v>

1941
01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:37.960
<v Speaker 2>You think you'd do comedy central comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>central needs to show a.</v>

1942
01:29:38.050 --> 01:29:38.883
<v Speaker 2>They need something.</v>

1943
01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:42.660
<v Speaker 3>I do somewhere I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what the best choices.</v>

1944
01:29:42.730 --> 01:29:44.530
<v Speaker 3>I had a good relationship over there</v>
<v Speaker 3>still.</v>

1945
01:29:44.730 --> 01:29:46.570
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we'll see.</v>

1946
01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:48.370
<v Speaker 3>We'll see what it is.</v>

1947
01:29:48.610 --> 01:29:51.130
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to do those things because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to deal with so many other</v>

1948
01:29:51.131 --> 01:29:53.080
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get so many different cooks in the</v>

1949
01:29:53.081 --> 01:29:54.670
<v Speaker 2>kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Executives,</v>

1950
01:29:55.150 --> 01:29:56.840
<v Speaker 2>all these different people hanging out.</v>

1951
01:29:58.110 --> 01:30:00.260
<v Speaker 3>Well part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they will,</v>

1952
01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:04.310
<v Speaker 3>they will pretty chill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>

1953
01:30:04.610 --> 01:30:06.050
<v Speaker 3>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1954
01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:11.750
<v Speaker 3>it will be weird aspects and just weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that you think you care about</v>

1955
01:30:12.261 --> 01:30:14.030
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll be a weird line,</v>

1956
01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:18.560
<v Speaker 3>like why don't you give a shit about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this line so much,</v>

1957
01:30:18.710 --> 01:30:23.390
<v Speaker 3>but they'll let other shit go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he'll sometimes give notes on</v>

1958
01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:27.710
<v Speaker 3>something that a st pretty insignificant</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me.</v>

1959
01:30:27.850 --> 01:30:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of times they just want to</v>

1960
01:30:29.171 --> 01:30:33.490
<v Speaker 2>justify their existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to justify their paycheck and</v>

1961
01:30:33.491 --> 01:30:35.920
<v Speaker 2>have some sort of point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if it doesn't make any sense,</v>

1962
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:38.020
<v Speaker 2>they just want to add to it.</v>

1964
01:30:40.931 --> 01:30:43.570
<v Speaker 2>his hat off and made it a little nod.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>conference calls is because everybody</v>

01:32:10.781 --> 01:32:13.180
<v Speaker 4>a few years back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I wish I could remember late</v>

01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:30.190
<v Speaker 4>so that's where I wound up doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the conversation on the phone was</v>

01:32:30.191 --> 01:32:32.410
<v Speaker 4>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they were going over the material.</v>

2019
01:32:40.871 --> 01:32:43.630
<v Speaker 4>It's such a bad idea anyway because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're always all broken up.</v>

2023
01:32:51.970 --> 01:32:55.030
<v Speaker 3>and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they break up your store and you broke</v>

<v Speaker 3>up a story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>longest story and my second one,</v>

2025
01:32:58.721 --> 01:33:02.500

<v Speaker 3>but they all netflix now and they're</v>

<v Speaker 4>Those things look way I tell people,</v>

2039
01:33:35.601 --> 01:33:35.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>They're not.</v>

2042
01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:45.950
<v Speaker 4>It's just your body is used to wearing a</v>
<v Speaker 4>cast on your feet.</v>

2043
01:33:46.890 --> 01:33:49.520
<v Speaker 4>Listen to everybody that's worried about</v>
<v Speaker 4>those things.</v>

2044
01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:54.820
<v Speaker 4>I swear If you just use those things and</v>
<v Speaker 4>walk for awhile and then like where I'm</v>

2045
01:33:56.121 --> 01:33:58.730
<v Speaker 4>a little bit and then eventually build</v>
<v Speaker 4>up to running with them,</v>

2046
01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:01.520
<v Speaker 4>you'll be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have to strengthen your feet.</v>

2047
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:06.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm neil brennan said he got plantar</v>
<v Speaker 4>fasciitis from running on a treadmill.</v>

2048
01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:09.620
<v Speaker 4>what those things on those vibram</v>
<v Speaker 4>fivefIngers shoes.</v>

2049
01:34:09.650 --> 01:34:11.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the ones that really stick to</v>

2050
01:34:11.891 --> 01:34:13.890
<v Speaker 3>your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Toe shoes.</v>

2051
01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:17.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I run with those and they're better for</v>

2052
01:34:17.341 --> 01:34:18.380
<v Speaker 4>your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like your.</v>

2053
01:34:18.430 --> 01:34:22.050
<v Speaker 4>Your foot has to be strong because most</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the time when you're running,</v>

2054
01:34:22.051 --> 01:34:25.530
<v Speaker 4>you're running with running shoes on</v>
<v Speaker 4>like have you seen the average pair of</v>

2055
01:34:25.531 --> 01:34:28.200
<v Speaker 4>running shoes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a thick heel and what happened</v>

2056
01:34:28.201 --> 01:34:30.990
<v Speaker 4>is nike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in the seventies whenever they</v>

2057
01:34:30.991 --> 01:34:34.380
<v Speaker 4>came out with these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they literally changed the way people</v>

2058
01:34:34.381 --> 01:34:38.220
<v Speaker 4>run because people started running in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>landing with their heel because that's</v>

2059
01:34:38.221 --> 01:34:40.560
<v Speaker 4>where the big cushion is changed the</v>
<v Speaker 4>gate,</v>

2060
01:34:40.590 --> 01:34:44.520
<v Speaker 4>the natural human gate and to put way</v>
<v Speaker 4>more pressure on your knees and people</v>

2061
01:34:44.521 --> 01:34:46.680
<v Speaker 4>started developing all these issues</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of that.</v>

2062
01:34:47.130 --> 01:34:48.810
<v Speaker 4>The real way to run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's supposed to.</v>

2063
01:34:48.811 --> 01:34:52.320
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to run on the forefoot</v>
<v Speaker 4>like landing on the ball of the foot and</v>

2064
01:34:52.321 --> 01:34:56.100
<v Speaker 4>let the natural structure of your foot</v>
<v Speaker 4>decelerate your stride.</v>

2065
01:34:56.130 --> 01:34:58.760
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're supposed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but most people's feet are not</v>

2066
01:34:58.761 --> 01:35:03.230
<v Speaker 4>conditioned for that because we wear</v>
<v Speaker 4>these thick ass sneakers everywhere and</v>

2067
01:35:03.231 --> 01:35:05.630
<v Speaker 4>those things act as it's like wearing a</v>
<v Speaker 4>cast everywhere.</v>

2068
01:35:05.630 --> 01:35:09.800
<v Speaker 4>That's how it's been described to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So over the last four or five months</v>

2069
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:12.650
<v Speaker 4>I've been running with what they call</v>
<v Speaker 4>minimal issues,</v>

2070
01:35:12.710 --> 01:35:14.510
<v Speaker 4>so there's almost no cushioning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It all.</v>

2071
01:35:14.511 --> 01:35:18.500
<v Speaker 4>It's very thin and I was saying that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so hot out that it was running in</v>

2072
01:35:18.501 --> 01:35:23.501
<v Speaker 4>these things and the bottom of my feet</v>
<v Speaker 4>got hot from the just from running on</v>

2073
01:35:23.571 --> 01:35:25.160
<v Speaker 4>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ground was so hot.</v>

2074
01:35:25.161 --> 01:35:27.890
<v Speaker 4>It was it starting to melt or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Today I could feel that I could feel the</v>

2075
01:35:27.891 --> 01:35:29.540
<v Speaker 4>heat through the bottom of my feet was</v>
<v Speaker 4>hurting.</v>

2076
01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:32.210
<v Speaker 4>It is actually like burning the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 4>of my foot,</v>

2077
01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:33.560
<v Speaker 4>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

2078
01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:35.770
<v Speaker 4>if you have dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be super fucking careful.</v>

2079
01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:38.720
<v Speaker 4>Your dogs outside because you're walking</v>
<v Speaker 4>your dog on concrete.</v>

2080
01:35:38.721 --> 01:35:41.120
<v Speaker 4>You could easily burn the shit out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>your dog's paws.</v>

2081
01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:43.970
<v Speaker 5>Just the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just had looked a little bit into it.</v>

2082
01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:45.560
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the painting,</v>

2083
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:49.100
<v Speaker 5>different sections of a asphalt I guess</v>
<v Speaker 5>here with,</v>

2084
01:35:49.250 --> 01:35:50.260
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's like white.</v>

2085
01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:54.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So It's a heat absorbing color instead</v>

2086
01:35:54.611 --> 01:35:59.110
<v Speaker 4>of black asphalt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Black asphalt apparently just absorbs</v>

2087
01:35:59.111 --> 01:36:02.230
<v Speaker 4>the heat and reflects the heat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Radiates it around.</v>

2088
01:36:02.231 --> 01:36:02.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2089
01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:04.820
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was dropping like 10 to 15 degrees</v>

2090
01:36:04.821 --> 01:36:06.300
<v Speaker 5>almost immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was her here.</v>

2091
01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:08.660
<v Speaker 5>You got 12 degrees just after one coat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>YeaH,</v>

2092
01:36:08.661 --> 01:36:10.130
<v Speaker 5>I've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>

2093
01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:13.520
<v Speaker 5>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And all that as hard as I saw in one</v>

2094
01:36:13.521 --> 01:36:15.290
<v Speaker 5>article,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's like 120 degrees.</v>

2095
01:36:15.291 --> 01:36:17.930
<v Speaker 5>It was getting some places like off</v>
<v Speaker 5>sunset boulevard and la,</v>

2096
01:36:17.931 --> 01:36:20.600
<v Speaker 5>like just in the middle of the day when</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like 85 outside,</v>

2097
01:36:20.601 --> 01:36:22.370
<v Speaker 5>90 degrees outside.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Makes sense.</v>

2098
01:36:22.371 --> 01:36:23.450
<v Speaker 5>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really extra hot.</v>

2099
01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:24.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it totally makes sense.</v>

2100
01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:27.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In all of la is asphalt basically to</v>

2101
01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:29.930
<v Speaker 5>paint that shit stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2102
01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:32.810
<v Speaker 5>This would change maybe maybe a little</v>
<v Speaker 5>bit on your feet.</v>

2103
01:36:33.110 --> 01:36:34.160
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you run it on</v>

2104
01:36:34.530 --> 01:36:36.480
<v Speaker 4>running on dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm running up hills,</v>

2105
01:36:36.990 --> 01:36:38.520
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was so hot.</v>

2106
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:41.460
<v Speaker 4>It was the first time it's ever like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>burned the bottom of my feet.</v>

2107
01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:43.190
<v Speaker 4>Like I could feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was hot.</v>

2108
01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:44.040
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jesus,</v>

2109
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:47.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't really jog,</v>

2110
01:36:47.130 --> 01:36:51.240
<v Speaker 4>but I'm a good judge of form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you?</v>

2111
01:36:51.330 --> 01:36:54.300
<v Speaker 4>I just like a running coach now know if</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could coach,</v>

2112
01:36:54.301 --> 01:36:56.340
<v Speaker 4>but I could just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could definitely tell you when you're</v>

2113
01:36:56.341 --> 01:37:00.810
<v Speaker 4>wrong because I see some people like to</v>
<v Speaker 4>heavy footed,</v>

2114
01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:04.920
<v Speaker 4>heavy footage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad when most people are running on</v>

2115
01:37:04.921 --> 01:37:06.750
<v Speaker 4>their heels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see people running and I'm like,</v>

2116
01:37:06.751 --> 01:37:08.040
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

2117
01:37:08.041 --> 01:37:11.430
<v Speaker 4>When you look around to you look around</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many people are wearing shoes with</v>

2118
01:37:11.431 --> 01:37:12.510
<v Speaker 4>elevated heels?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

2119
01:37:12.511 --> 01:37:14.130
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's kinda nuts.</v>

2120
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:18.150
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of not telling me people just</v>
<v Speaker 4>got accustomed to wearing those kinds of</v>

2121
01:37:18.151 --> 01:37:19.050
<v Speaker 4>sneakers and running</v>

2122
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:21.130
<v Speaker 5>people are running basketball shoes or</v>
<v Speaker 5>something too.</v>

2123
01:37:21.330 --> 01:37:22.970
<v Speaker 5>That's lIke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you probably shouldn't be doing that.</v>

2124
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:26.300
<v Speaker 4>I think you'd be better off with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you are with running shoes.</v>

2125
01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:29.420
<v Speaker 4>Just don't land that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just to land on your heel.</v>

2126
01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:31.760
<v Speaker 4>If you went to the ball of your feet</v>
<v Speaker 4>basketball shoes,</v>

2127
01:37:31.761 --> 01:37:33.560
<v Speaker 4>I think she'd be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what the fuck do I know?</v>

2128
01:37:34.130 --> 01:37:35.720
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm running with some really.</v>

2129
01:37:35.810 --> 01:37:40.410
<v Speaker 4>I run all knee with those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A five finger shoes now or with um,</v>

2130
01:37:40.510 --> 01:37:43.960
<v Speaker 4>I wear these morels too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're called vapor or something or</v>

2131
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.190
<v Speaker 4>like the real thin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>too minimalist.</v>

2132
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:52.030
<v Speaker 4>Do people ever try to read it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But people probably still will attempt</v>

2133
01:37:52.161 --> 01:37:53.870
<v Speaker 4>to stop you while you jog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2134
01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:55.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I don't do,</v>

2135
01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:56.133
<v Speaker 4>you can't.</v>

2136
01:37:57.650 --> 01:37:59.310
<v Speaker 4>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm in the middle.</v>

2137
01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:01.220
<v Speaker 4>You're literally going to interrupt a</v>
<v Speaker 4>workout.</v>

2138
01:38:01.250 --> 01:38:04.010
<v Speaker 4>Looks like I've had people come up to me</v>
<v Speaker 4>while I'm on the treadmill before,</v>

2139
01:38:04.011 --> 01:38:04.461
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

2140
01:38:04.461 --> 01:38:05.610
<v Speaker 4>can I get you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get a photo with you.</v>

2141
01:38:05.611 --> 01:38:08.840
<v Speaker 4>like definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now people do it.</v>

2142
01:38:08.841 --> 01:38:12.530
<v Speaker 4>If you can have a mouthful of food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could be eating food.</v>

2143
01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:16.460
<v Speaker 4>I was cutting food up for my daughter</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this lady asked me for a picture.</v>

2144
01:38:16.730 --> 01:38:18.290
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you crazy?</v>

2145
01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:21.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm feeding my kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2146
01:38:21.531 --> 01:38:24.170
<v Speaker 4>this is just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People just don't give a fuck.</v>

2147
01:38:24.171 --> 01:38:27.770
<v Speaker 4>They want to adorn their facebook with</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that they saw on tv once.</v>

2148
01:38:28.610 --> 01:38:29.410
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

2149
01:38:29.410 --> 01:38:31.280
<v Speaker 5>Not even printing it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't care.</v>

2150
01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:33.590
<v Speaker 5>Not even really pregnant usually.</v>

2151
01:38:34.170 --> 01:38:36.630
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't even want it that much.</v>

2152
01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:38.770
<v Speaker 4>It's just like they have a phone and</v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

2153
01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:40.710
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you have a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to pull the trigger.</v>

2154
01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:43.650
<v Speaker 4>YOu have a phone and you want to take a</v>
<v Speaker 4>picture like how many people do you see</v>

<v Speaker 4>fucking video.</v>

<v Speaker 4>fireworks video like how sad is your</v>

2159
01:38:56.641 --> 01:38:59.700

<v Speaker 4>watching little lights go off on your</v>

2160
01:38:59.701 --> 01:39:00.540
<v Speaker 4>foreign screen.</v>

<v Speaker 5>once that's clean up.</v>

2167

<v Speaker 5>but my face isn't in there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>do they have a deal with this dentist</v>

2419
01:50:11.051 --> 01:50:16.051
<v Speaker 3>office or do they just charge at night</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people to park in his dentist off?</v>

2420
01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:19.960
<v Speaker 3>Because you're not the dentist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can you come up?</v>

2421
01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:22.660
<v Speaker 3>And I was telling him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2422
01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:24.790
<v Speaker 3>yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told her that I was going to say that</v>

2423
01:50:24.791 --> 01:50:25.960
<v Speaker 3>before we got out the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2424
01:50:25.961 --> 01:50:26.541
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>

2425
01:50:26.541 --> 01:50:28.210
<v Speaker 3>Ask him if he's a dentist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gone.</v>

2426
01:50:28.810 --> 01:50:31.150
<v Speaker 3>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we'd get out.</v>

2427
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:32.770
<v Speaker 3>You're not the dentist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>

2428
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:35.890
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is calling?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was upset that you actually did it.</v>

2429
01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:37.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I was really about,</v>

2430
01:50:37.521 --> 01:50:38.141
<v Speaker 3>it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2431
01:50:38.141 --> 01:50:42.100
<v Speaker 3>Like what's the chances of it getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>told like I was really not because of</v>

2432
01:50:42.101 --> 01:50:43.960
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the cheapest was a part of it,</v>

2433
01:50:43.961 --> 01:50:47.440
<v Speaker 3>but it was genuinely I wanted to know</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reality of the situation.</v>

2434
01:50:47.610 --> 01:50:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And did they explain to,</v>

2435
01:50:49.811 --> 01:50:51.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2436
01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:53.410
<v Speaker 3>she was getting upset and I just paid</v>
<v Speaker 3>the $5.</v>

2437
01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:58.330
<v Speaker 3>She got real upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not upset,</v>

2438
01:50:58.331 --> 01:51:02.260
<v Speaker 3>but enough where she wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't have the same sense of humor</v>

2439
01:51:02.261 --> 01:51:04.330
<v Speaker 3>and a frugality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas she,</v>

2440
01:51:04.590 --> 01:51:07.510
<v Speaker 3>we weren't on the same wavelength as far</v>
<v Speaker 3>as that interaction.</v>

2441
01:51:07.511 --> 01:51:10.180
<v Speaker 3>So she wasn't rolling with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That trumps a lot of women crazy.</v>

2442
01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:13.660
<v Speaker 3>Find out that you cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2443
01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:17.320
<v Speaker 3>It was supposed to be bold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's one thing that women like</v>

2444
01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:19.150
<v Speaker 3>that I feel like when dudes make it</v>
<v Speaker 3>rain,</v>

2445
01:51:19.210 --> 01:51:20.710
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You throw in a bunch of money in the</v>

2446
01:51:20.711 --> 01:51:21.790
<v Speaker 3>air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't give a fuck.</v>

2447
01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:25.300
<v Speaker 3>There's something about that that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's exciting coming up out that</v>

2448
01:51:25.330 --> 01:51:30.100
<v Speaker 3>strippers like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the average women won't like that.</v>

2449
01:51:30.130 --> 01:51:30.963
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

2450
01:51:31.580 --> 01:51:33.880
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a male move.</v>

2451
01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:36.400
<v Speaker 3>Talk to make it rain as trip couples a</v>
<v Speaker 3>total mail move.</v>

2452
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:38.470
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a saying that you don't give a fuck</v>

2453
01:51:38.471 --> 01:51:40.240
<v Speaker 3>about money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's chuck it up in the air.</v>

2454
01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:43.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot behInd that.</v>

2455
01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:46.480
<v Speaker 3>I haven't bought out in the strip club</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

2456
01:51:46.481 --> 01:51:51.481
<v Speaker 3>but I think the most I've spent in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>night in the strip club is maybe 800,</v>

2457
01:51:53.890 --> 01:51:55.690
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2458
01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:59.650
<v Speaker 3>Which in atlanta is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spent two months In atlanta this</v>

2459
01:51:59.650 --> 01:52:00.850
<v Speaker 3>summer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty low.</v>

2460
01:52:00.851 --> 01:52:03.130
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some guys that go and just have</v>

2461
01:52:03.131 --> 01:52:04.810
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 grants such and such.</v>

2462
01:52:04.811 --> 01:52:07.720
<v Speaker 3>This rapper spent 20 grand in the strip</v>
<v Speaker 3>club,</v>

2463
01:52:07.721 --> 01:52:12.370
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's shocking and frightening to me.</v>

2464
01:52:12.590 --> 01:52:13.230
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2465
01:52:13.230 --> 01:52:14.530

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2466
01:52:14.590 --> 01:52:15.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>

2467
01:52:15.851 --> 01:52:17.890
<v Speaker 3>Strip clubs in atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I was at the tabernacle.</v>

2469
01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:21.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fun time,</v>

<v Speaker 5>of not worrying at all about grinding to</v>

2483
01:52:55.881 --> 01:52:57.860
<v Speaker 5>the point where you just throw it up in</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's a huge strip club.</v>

2492

<v Speaker 5>I don't like my strip clubs used it over</v>
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

2493
01:53:25.761 --> 01:53:28.240
<v Speaker 5>I like my strip clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kinda like dive bars,</v>

2494
01:53:28.850 --> 01:53:33.850
<v Speaker 5>like a certain strip clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you walk in and you throw up a couple</v>

2495
01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:37.250
<v Speaker 5>hundred dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you can kind of take over the</v>

2496
01:53:37.251 --> 01:53:39.180
<v Speaker 5>energy of the place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2497
01:53:39.250 --> 01:53:42.410
<v Speaker 5>like all the strippers and started</v>
<v Speaker 5>coming to you and shit had a small point</v>

2498
01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:43.730
<v Speaker 5>at a smaller place.</v>

2499
01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:48.160
<v Speaker 5>King of diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where rIck ross hangs out like</v>

2500
01:53:48.161 --> 01:53:48.660
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2501
01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:50.990
<v Speaker 5>Mayweather through something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then I can see that chemo,</v>

2502
01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:56.020
<v Speaker 5>diamonds and it has a basketball court.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we talked about strip clubs last</v>

2503
01:53:57.621 --> 01:54:01.010
<v Speaker 5>time we were here doing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2504
01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:03.590
<v Speaker 5>when they have a basketball court in</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

2505
01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:07.590
<v Speaker 5>and a barber shop in the strip club.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2506
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:12.230
<v Speaker 5>a barbershop and a basketball court.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why they have a basketball court?</v>

2507
01:54:12.290 --> 01:54:16.550
<v Speaker 5>Because sometimes before you want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>just get your endorphins going before</v>

2508
01:54:16.551 --> 01:54:17.870
<v Speaker 5>you throw out of money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess.</v>

2509
01:54:17.930 --> 01:54:20.060
<v Speaker 5>Or maybe the strippers like to play</v>
<v Speaker 5>basketball.</v>

2510
01:54:20.230 --> 01:54:21.890
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Weird.</v>

2511
01:54:22.130 --> 01:54:24.000
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's a.</v>

2512
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:28.730
<v Speaker 5>The music is great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a weird strip cup too because the</v>

2513
01:54:28.731 --> 01:54:30.410
<v Speaker 5>girls were close.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's going on?</v>

2514
01:54:30.650 --> 01:54:34.400

<v Speaker 5>This is the youtube version.</v>

2515
01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:38.030

2558
01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:28.560
<v Speaker 4>dollars at twitter for a billion dollar.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like how much moneY is twitter worth?</v>

2563
01:56:38.071 --> 01:56:39.930
<v Speaker 4>Like if twitter was going to be for</v>
<v Speaker 4>sale,</v>

2564
01:56:40.130 --> 01:56:42.900
<v Speaker 4>it had to be for sale first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would have to be lIke $15 billion.</v>

2565
01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:45.640
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Insane potential.</v>

2566
01:56:45.690 --> 01:56:46.090
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

2567
01:56:46.090 --> 01:56:51.090
<v Speaker 3>this is the thing with twitter from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit that I know is that it in</v>

2568
01:56:52.961 --> 01:56:57.490
<v Speaker 3>comparison to the other social medias,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've had travel.</v>

2569
01:56:57.820 --> 01:56:58.970
<v Speaker 3>Monetize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2570
01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:00.670
<v Speaker 3>In,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2571
01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:04.060
<v Speaker 3>in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like instagram is making money.</v>

2572
01:57:04.061 --> 01:57:06.820
<v Speaker 3>Facebook obviously making money and his</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole body up.</v>

2573
01:57:06.821 --> 01:57:11.821
<v Speaker 3>Snapchat is doing what twitter hasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>figured out how to get real revenue,</v>

2574
01:57:12.251 --> 01:57:16.030
<v Speaker 3>like people use twitter and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and are active on it and live tweet</v>

2575
01:57:16.031 --> 01:57:18.280
<v Speaker 3>events.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as far as the money,</v>

2576
01:57:18.730 --> 01:57:21.070
<v Speaker 3>it hasn't been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been lagging</v>

2577
01:57:21.140 --> 01:57:23.120
<v Speaker 4>in comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you understand that?</v>

2578
01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:24.500
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2579
01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:28.190
<v Speaker 4>like instagram has sponsored tweets with</v>
<v Speaker 4>that saY,</v>

2580
01:57:28.370 --> 01:57:32.600
<v Speaker 4>what are you putting up there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The market value of 15 point 7 billion</v>

2581
01:57:32.601 --> 01:57:34.340
<v Speaker 4>for twitter a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2582
01:57:34.430 --> 01:57:36.470
<v Speaker 4>So why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chick thinks she can get it for a</v>

2583
01:57:36.470 --> 01:57:37.550
<v Speaker 4>billion bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's tripping.</v>

2584
01:57:37.580 --> 01:57:39.020
<v Speaker 4>She's just trying to get attention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2585
01:57:39.370 --> 01:57:40.203
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2586
01:57:40.370 --> 01:57:41.290
<v Speaker 3>actually smoke.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's just pure,</v>

2588
01:57:44.350 --> 01:57:49.350
<v Speaker 3>just anger to come up with anger because</v>
<v Speaker 3>anger at not just to have the initial</v>

2589
01:57:50.530 --> 01:57:55.300

<v Speaker 3>didn't calm down.</v>

2591
01:57:59.470 --> 01:58:04.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to go through somebody like fucking</v>

01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:07.840
<v Speaker 3>do a crowdfunding twitter that's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid.</v>

2593
01:58:07.841 --> 01:58:12.670

2598

<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

2599
01:58:26.290 --> 01:58:29.590
<v Speaker 4>it's so stupid because there's 350</v>
<v Speaker 4>million people in this country.</v>

2600
01:58:29.591 --> 01:58:33.430
<v Speaker 4>if every single person what's mesh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She just wants to become the largest</v>

2601
01:58:33.431 --> 01:58:35.630
<v Speaker 4>shareholder so she can make the</v>
<v Speaker 4>decision.</v>

2604
01:58:40.781 --> 01:58:42.650
<v Speaker 4>like if you gave her 100 grand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you.</v>

2605
01:58:42.670 --> 01:58:46.210
<v Speaker 4>Does she give you an accounting form of</v>
<v Speaker 4>what she's doing with that 100 grand?</v>

2606
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:47.800
<v Speaker 4>That's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one's going to die.</v>

01:58:47.980 --> 01:58:52.120
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe she got 85 grand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing in and of itself.</v>

2608
01:58:52.160 --> 01:58:53.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the final number at the end,</v>

2609
01:58:53.691 --> 01:58:57.950
<v Speaker 3>the end of that number is seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means somebody gave like $2 or</v>

01:58:57.951 --> 01:58:59.900
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody gave a weird off.</v>

<v Speaker 3>good crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big crowd.</v>

2649
02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:46.820
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of crowd.</v>

2650
02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:49.010
<v Speaker 4>What a crowd here to see me right now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody.</v>

2652
02:00:50.090 --> 02:00:50.923
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>

2653
02:00:51.270 --> 02:00:54.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I'm disturbed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think it was.</v>

2654
02:00:54.980 --> 02:00:58.780
<v Speaker 3>I knew it would be bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it would be this,</v>

2655
02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:03.530
<v Speaker 3>get this bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this court this quick and yeah,</v>

2656
02:01:03.531 --> 02:01:06.080
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating.</v>

2657
02:01:06.150 --> 02:01:09.030
<v Speaker 4>The thing that fascinates me the most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not just him,</v>

2658
02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:12.420
<v Speaker 4>but how many people still support him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many pieces of any problem with it?</v>

2659
02:01:13.710 --> 02:01:16.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to.</v>

2660
02:01:17.550 --> 02:01:22.550
<v Speaker 3>I can't understand it really with a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They still are behind you behind all of</v>

2661
02:01:22.771 --> 02:01:26.460
<v Speaker 3>this or is it just where they have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>similar.</v>

2662
02:01:26.461 --> 02:01:29.190
<v Speaker 3>Just the people that are really into</v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

2663
02:01:29.370 --> 02:01:34.370
<v Speaker 3>Are they the same type of just egomaniac</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a narcissist is where they can't</v>

2664
02:01:35.220 --> 02:01:38.670
<v Speaker 3>admit wrong or they know that it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>

2665
02:01:38.671 --> 02:01:41.210
<v Speaker 3>but that I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm locked in now.</v>

2666
02:01:41.370 --> 02:01:44.730
<v Speaker 4>They're locked in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they're finding a way to justify</v>

2667
02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:49.260
<v Speaker 4>whatever he does no matter what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I had a cow bell yesterday on the</v>

2668
02:01:49.261 --> 02:01:50.940
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't read.</v>

2669
02:01:51.210 --> 02:01:54.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't read comments on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I did look at the thumbs up,</v>

2670
02:01:54.271 --> 02:01:59.271
<v Speaker 4>thumbs down and it's like he had as many</v>
<v Speaker 4>thumbs down as thumbs up.</v>

2671
02:01:59.310 --> 02:02:03.060
<v Speaker 4>That's super rare and I think a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was because he was talking a lot of</v>

2672
02:02:03.090 --> 02:02:04.460
<v Speaker 4>shit about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were both were.</v>

2673
02:02:04.461 --> 02:02:08.790
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about how ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is and I saw a couple of comments</v>

2674
02:02:08.791 --> 02:02:10.800
<v Speaker 4>on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that got mad because we were</v>

2675
02:02:10.801 --> 02:02:13.920
<v Speaker 4>talking about his response to</v>
<v Speaker 4>charlottesville and they were saying he</v>

2676
02:02:13.921 --> 02:02:18.690
<v Speaker 4>was saying on all sides because there</v>
<v Speaker 4>was violence on all sides,</v>

2677
02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:24.000
<v Speaker 4>like people showed up with torches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They showed up wIth torches for white</v>

2678
02:02:26.041 --> 02:02:27.210
<v Speaker 4>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>

2679
02:02:27.211 --> 02:02:30.580
<v Speaker 4>we're here for white folks only we have</v>
<v Speaker 4>torches like you don't.</v>

2680
02:02:30.581 --> 02:02:33.690
<v Speaker 4>You don't think that's an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't think people showing up a line</v>

2681
02:02:33.930 --> 02:02:38.730
<v Speaker 4>of crazy white supremacists with torches</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the people that were opposing them,</v>

2682
02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:39.960
<v Speaker 4>the people that are opposing them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2683
02:02:40.170 --> 02:02:42.110
<v Speaker 4>they fucked up too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the only reason why we're there</v>

2684
02:02:42.111 --> 02:02:44.580
<v Speaker 4>we're there is because there was people</v>
<v Speaker 4>with torches.</v>

2685
02:02:45.420 --> 02:02:46.350
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing is insane</v>

2686
02:02:46.420 --> 02:02:51.420
<v Speaker 3>is a and he doesn't have the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he doesn't know how to handle it</v>

2687
02:02:53.380 --> 02:02:56.080
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can't say that publicly.</v>

2688
02:02:56.110 --> 02:02:57.760
<v Speaker 3>He can say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey guys,</v>

2689
02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:01.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm panicking right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2690
02:03:01.150 --> 02:03:04.270
<v Speaker 4>he never said that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he can't say it explicitly,</v>

2691
02:03:04.271 --> 02:03:08.410
<v Speaker 4>but he kinda says it through his ax.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he's healthy.</v>

2692
02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:10.870
<v Speaker 4>Also too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think when you're 70 years old,</v>

2693
02:03:10.871 --> 02:03:12.790
<v Speaker 4>like you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like your brain gets older,</v>

2694
02:03:12.791 --> 02:03:13.780
<v Speaker 4>you're 34,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2695
02:03:14.590 --> 02:03:17.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm 50 now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My brain's getting older for sure.</v>

2696
02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:19.130
<v Speaker 4>What's it gonna be like in 22,</v>
<v Speaker 4>23 years.</v>

2697
02:03:19.131 --> 02:03:19.890
<v Speaker 4>So what does he took?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Third,</v>

2698
02:03:19.890 --> 02:03:21.190
<v Speaker 4>71,</v>
<v Speaker 4>72,</v>

2699
02:03:21.220 --> 02:03:22.990
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's that going to be like?</v>

2700
02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:26.290
<v Speaker 4>Not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you should be working all</v>

2701
02:03:26.290 --> 02:03:28.180
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2702
02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:29.610
<v Speaker 3>That dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2703
02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.580
<v Speaker 3>he's too old and he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a crazy person.</v>

2704
02:03:33.581 --> 02:03:38.130
<v Speaker 3>And he used to host the apprentice and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was on comedy central roast amongst</v>

2705
02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:40.500
<v Speaker 3>other things</v>
<v Speaker 3>to watch.</v>

2706
02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:44.610
<v Speaker 3>That's not to say that those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2707
02:03:44.690 --> 02:03:49.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can't be solid at a being</v>
<v Speaker 3>president,</v>

2708
02:03:49.391 --> 02:03:50.800
<v Speaker 3>but this guy,</v>

2709
02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:53.920
<v Speaker 4>you say he still watches five hours of</v>
<v Speaker 4>tv a day.</v>

2710
02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:57.010
<v Speaker 4>That's what I read yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who reported that?</v>

2711
02:03:57.020 --> 02:04:02.020
<v Speaker 4>Routers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I find a bunch of fake news,</v>

2712
02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:05.470
<v Speaker 4>how could anybody have time to watch</v>
<v Speaker 4>five hours of tv a day if you have a</v>

2713
02:04:05.471 --> 02:04:07.300
<v Speaker 4>real job?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't brand new particle,</v>

2714
02:04:07.301 --> 02:04:10.480
<v Speaker 4>but trump's session is a first look at</v>
<v Speaker 4>that hair.</v>

2715
02:04:10.630 --> 02:04:13.660
<v Speaker 4>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that they can just take a photo of</v>

2716
02:04:13.661 --> 02:04:15.160
<v Speaker 4>his hair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only black,</v>

2717
02:04:15.161 --> 02:04:18.010
<v Speaker 4>everything out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is the most bizarre image of a</v>

2718
02:04:18.011 --> 02:04:22.470
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That crazy helmet of hair got mixed it</v>

2719
02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:24.190
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you have a photo editor,</v>

2720
02:04:24.790 --> 02:04:29.410
<v Speaker 4>it's a good move actually because no</v>
<v Speaker 4>president has consumed as much hold on.</v>

2721
02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:32.590
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Presidents confused as much television</v>

2722
02:04:32.591 --> 02:04:36.490
<v Speaker 4>in the current one or reacted as quickly</v>
<v Speaker 4>or directly to what they're seeing.</v>

2723
02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:41.310
<v Speaker 4>He loves fox and frIends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Six 24:00 AM monday.</v>

2724
02:04:41.311 --> 02:04:45.120
<v Speaker 4>Trump gushed over twitter about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing reporting and quotes on the</v>

2725
02:04:45.121 --> 02:04:47.070
<v Speaker 4>morning talk show a week earlier.</v>

2726
02:04:47.490 --> 02:04:50.700
<v Speaker 4>He instructed the nation to in parenths</v>
<v Speaker 4>in quotes,</v>

2727
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:54.930
<v Speaker 4>watch fox and friends now for their</v>
<v Speaker 4>exemplary really Russia coverage.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Really laurie exemplary Russia coverage.</v>

2729
02:04:58.980 --> 02:05:03.870
<v Speaker 4>He tweeted about the program hosted by</v>
<v Speaker 4>steve dewey dokey duty.</v>

2730
02:05:03.900 --> 02:05:05.530
<v Speaker 4>How do you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Juicy,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Ainslie earnhardt and brian kilmeade</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven times in march alone.</v>

2733
02:05:19.890 --> 02:05:21.150
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>recently brought up,</v>

2735
02:05:24.601 --> 02:05:27.900
<v Speaker 4>telling him cheerfully.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked that group of three people</v>

2736
02:05:29.700 --> 02:05:34.230
<v Speaker 4>even after becoming president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trump reportedly manages to fIll his</v>

2737
02:05:34.230 --> 02:05:37.560
<v Speaker 4>days with plenty of television in quotes</v>
<v Speaker 4>and from his tweets.</v>

2738
02:05:37.561 --> 02:05:39.990
<v Speaker 4>It's often possible to discern when and</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he's watching,</v>

2739
02:05:39.991 --> 02:05:43.770
<v Speaker 4>and january,</v>

<v Speaker 4>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most mornings,</v>

<v Speaker 4>sometimes interrupted with text to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>host or panelists.</v>

2746
02:05:59.461 --> 02:06:02.940
<v Speaker 4>He Texts them after the 6:00 AM hour of</v>

2751
02:06:15.571 --> 02:06:18.600

<v Speaker 4>often provoke his tweets.</v>

02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:23.310
<v Speaker 4>The day of our interview with him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of his tweet topics were discussed</v>

2753
02:06:23.311 --> 02:06:25.890
<v Speaker 4>and we've discussed during the first two</v>

02:06:49.591 --> 02:06:51.540
<v Speaker 4>as much as I think you're terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be the president.</v>

2762
02:06:51.540 --> 02:06:54.960
<v Speaker 4>I thought the very least you understood</v>
<v Speaker 4>show business and goes,</v>

2763
02:06:54.961 --> 02:06:57.960

<v Speaker 4>won.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I got you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2765
02:07:02.370 --> 02:07:06.210
<v Speaker 4>That was when he called,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he called trump's mouth at cock</v>

2766
02:07:06.211 --> 02:07:07.850
<v Speaker 4>holster for putin.</v>

02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:09.750

<v Speaker 4>It was a great joke,</v>

2768
02:07:10.650 --> 02:07:14.130
<v Speaker 4>but it's crazy like seeing that on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>late night talk show,</v>

2769
02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:19.400
<v Speaker 4>a late night talk show on cbs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The hosts calls the president's mouth.</v>

2770
02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:23.160
<v Speaker 4>Believe caught.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what they did.</v>

2771
02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:26.130
<v Speaker 4>They probably it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you knew what it was.</v>

2772
02:07:26.190 --> 02:07:27.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a coc.</v>

2773
02:07:27.240 --> 02:07:30.420
<v Speaker 4>He's saying that</v>
<v Speaker 4>he know what he's saying,</v>

2774
02:07:30.600 --> 02:07:33.330
<v Speaker 4>but the fact that that was in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>monologue that cbs is like,</v>

2775
02:07:33.331 --> 02:07:34.164
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go for it.</v>

2776
02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:36.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no other president do.</v>

2777
02:07:36.450 --> 02:07:38.530
<v Speaker 4>You would never have that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not in a million years.</v>

2778
02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:41.170
<v Speaker 4>The elect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the minimal amount of respect.</v>

2779
02:07:41.230 --> 02:07:43.810
<v Speaker 4>No fcc fined for stephen colbert.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Late night.</v>

2780
02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:45.730
<v Speaker 4>Donald trump cock holster crack.</v>

2781
02:07:46.150 --> 02:07:48.370
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2782
02:07:48.371 --> 02:07:52.510
<v Speaker 4>They believed it was trump trying to go</v>
<v Speaker 4>after it for the fcc.</v>

2783
02:07:53.710 --> 02:07:56.380
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember when the fcc went after</v>
<v Speaker 4>howard stern?</v>

2784
02:07:56.710 --> 02:08:01.710
<v Speaker 4>People forget about that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got fined and he didn't even swear he</v>

2785
02:08:02.171 --> 02:08:04.930
<v Speaker 4>got fined hundreds of thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars.</v>

2786
02:08:05.140 --> 02:08:06.520
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2787
02:08:06.850 --> 02:08:09.940
<v Speaker 4>How do you think how you think it is his</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy?</v>

2788
02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:13.090
<v Speaker 4>You think he ends his term?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think he dies in office?</v>

2789
02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:15.350
<v Speaker 4>You think he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2790
02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:20.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets impeached.</v>

2791
02:08:21.670 --> 02:08:25.690
<v Speaker 4>You think what happens with trump?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>

2792
02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:29.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he gets a second term,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you think he makes it wrong.</v>

2793
02:08:29.651 --> 02:08:31.210
<v Speaker 4>I think he makes it to the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>term.</v>

2794
02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:34.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just how long wheels on a</v>

2795
02:08:34.691 --> 02:08:36.910
<v Speaker 4>giant disaster and it gets worse and</v>
<v Speaker 4>worse.</v>

2796
02:08:37.060 --> 02:08:39.220
<v Speaker 4>And I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing that howard stern had a</v>

2797
02:08:39.221 --> 02:08:42.490
<v Speaker 4>really good point about trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said he wants to be loved.</v>

2798
02:08:42.490 --> 02:08:45.640
<v Speaker 4>He wants people to love him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a terrible job if you want</v>

2799
02:08:45.641 --> 02:08:47.890
<v Speaker 4>people to love you because even the</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that supported you,</v>

2800
02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:50.830
<v Speaker 4>once you get in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to do this impossible job</v>

2801
02:08:50.831 --> 02:08:51.131
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

2802
02:08:51.131 --> 02:08:56.131
<v Speaker 4>No one's been able to do totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People forget that obama had like a very</v>

2803
02:08:57.041 --> 02:08:59.740
<v Speaker 4>low approval rating too at one point in</v>
<v Speaker 4>time in his presidency.</v>

2804
02:08:59.741 --> 02:09:03.580
<v Speaker 4>I think he was in the low forties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like 44 percent or something like that.</v>

2805
02:09:04.150 --> 02:09:08.230
<v Speaker 4>Approval rating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's not a job that anybody does.</v>

2806
02:09:08.231 --> 02:09:10.240
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if you're the best at ever,</v>

2807
02:09:10.241 --> 02:09:12.970
<v Speaker 4>you still people a giant percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the population.</v>

2808
02:09:12.980 --> 02:09:14.920
<v Speaker 4>Millions and millions of people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to fucking hate you.</v>

2809
02:09:15.310 --> 02:09:18.160
<v Speaker 4>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's in that guy psyche.</v>

2810
02:09:18.370 --> 02:09:20.260
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you check twitter like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2811
02:09:20.290 --> 02:09:21.123
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can.</v>

2812
02:09:21.980 --> 02:09:25.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can block himself from it a when he</v>

2813
02:09:25.511 --> 02:09:27.700
<v Speaker 4>broke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he blocks regular people when regular</v>

2814
02:09:27.701 --> 02:09:29.650
<v Speaker 4>people black himself from that.</v>

2815
02:09:29.650 --> 02:09:32.170
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But just like by delete that off his</v>

2816
02:09:32.171 --> 02:09:33.760
<v Speaker 4>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can kinda get away from it,</v>

2817
02:09:33.761 --> 02:09:36.550
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think he could just take</v>
<v Speaker 4>that attention away from him.</v>

2818
02:09:36.551 --> 02:09:37.930
<v Speaker 4>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so either.</v>

2819
02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:40.330
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think it's healthy for</v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

2820
02:09:40.331 --> 02:09:43.300
<v Speaker 4>especially at this late stage of his</v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

2821
02:09:43.390 --> 02:09:46.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seventies taking this kind of heat</v>

2822
02:09:47.080 --> 02:09:50.590
<v Speaker 4>because before he was president,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy,</v>

2823
02:09:50.591 --> 02:09:52.120
<v Speaker 4>whether people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people didn't like,</v>

2824
02:09:52.121 --> 02:09:53.440
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people loved them,</v>

2825
02:09:53.620 --> 02:09:58.030
<v Speaker 4>no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was genuinely generally able to like</v>

2826
02:09:58.031 --> 02:10:01.150
<v Speaker 4>walk around everywhere and not be hated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he'd go to restaurant.</v>

2827
02:10:01.151 --> 02:10:01.811
<v Speaker 4>People go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh look,</v>

2828
02:10:01.811 --> 02:10:03.030
<v Speaker 4>there's Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>

2829
02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:04.300
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People were like hating him.</v>

2830
02:10:05.890 --> 02:10:10.720
<v Speaker 4>His face kind of a douche bag maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like how you said that.</v>

2831
02:10:10.750 --> 02:10:12.750
<v Speaker 4>Maybe goes back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

2832
02:10:12.780 --> 02:10:14.860
<v Speaker 4>That was tough over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody was better.</v>

2833
02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:17.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might laugh or by try to get a</v>

2834
02:10:17.501 --> 02:10:19.480
<v Speaker 4>selfie with them and asked him a</v>
<v Speaker 4>question,</v>

2835
02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:24.840
<v Speaker 4>but now the amount of hate he</v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences is probably like four or 500</v>

2836
02:10:25.271 --> 02:10:28.570
<v Speaker 4>percent more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more even ramped up through the roof.</v>

2837
02:10:28.700 --> 02:10:33.460
<v Speaker 4>It's a five digit weird number or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something crazy quantifiable.</v>

2838
02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:34.473
<v Speaker 4>Hey</v>

2839

2840
02:10:37.350 --> 02:10:38.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody just wants to take a free shot</v>

2844
02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:50.480
<v Speaker 2>the president's show on comedy central.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

2845
02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:55.520
<v Speaker 2>God damn cold bear has been founded in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the radiance lately because he's been</v>

2846
02:10:55.521 --> 02:11:00.140
<v Speaker 2>ripping on him because I making that</v>
<v Speaker 2>goddamn legacy off of this being an</v>

<v Speaker 2>president.</v>

2849
02:11:04.191 --> 02:11:06.410
<v Speaker 2>The hair thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was already a done deal.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It didn't pressure him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when people are mad at that.</v>

2853
02:11:15.231 --> 02:11:16.850
<v Speaker 2>He didn't treat him like a dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

02:11:17.530 --> 02:11:19.610
<v Speaker 2>ProbablY had no idea that he was going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to win too.</v>

<v Speaker 4>12.</v>

2915
02:14:04.761 --> 02:14:07.800
<v Speaker 4>a group oF intelligent people that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>qualified,</v>

02:14:11.940 --> 02:14:14.490
<v Speaker 4>great morals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't have just a popularity contest</v>

2918
02:14:14.491 --> 02:14:17.100
<v Speaker 4>to see who gets to control the nukes.</v>

02:14:20.041 --> 02:14:22.710
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think we're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think once we have things written on</v>

2921
02:14:22.711 --> 02:14:26.970
<v Speaker 4>paper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once we have like a way that we operate,</v>

2922
02:14:26.971 --> 02:14:29.820
<v Speaker 4>once we have some sort of a plan that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>follow,</v>

2923
02:14:30.030 --> 02:14:32.920
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult to get to people to</v>
<v Speaker 4>shake that too,</v>

2924
02:14:32.990 --> 02:14:37.380
<v Speaker 4>to have some sort of a new reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 4>plan to run the country without</v>

2925
02:14:37.650 --> 02:14:40.270
<v Speaker 4>representative government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2926
02:14:40.271 --> 02:14:45.150
<v Speaker 4>like senators and congressmen and people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you have to like it mean they had</v>

2927
02:14:45.151 --> 02:14:47.520
<v Speaker 4>all that shit back when they couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>get ahold of people.</v>

2928
02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:48.451

2929
02:14:48.451 --> 02:14:50.910
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not saying that there shouldn't</v>

2930
02:14:50.911 --> 02:14:53.040
<v Speaker 4>be some representatives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying that the system that's in</v>

2931
02:14:53.041 --> 02:14:55.530
<v Speaker 4>place right noW was really in place</v>
<v Speaker 4>right now because you had a</v>

<v Speaker 4>representative every state and they had</v>
<v Speaker 4>to travel to dc and they did their</v>

2933
02:14:59.611 --> 02:15:00.810
<v Speaker 4>business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they come back to their</v>

2934
02:15:00.811 --> 02:15:01.980
<v Speaker 4>constituents.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will,</v>

2935
02:15:01.981 --> 02:15:04.110
<v Speaker 4>the constituents can all communicate in</v>
<v Speaker 4>real time.</v>

2936
02:15:04.111 --> 02:15:04.621
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 4>we have this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2938
02:15:05.751 --> 02:15:08.250

2939
02:15:08.251 --> 02:15:11.940

<v Speaker 4>That also should be an option 100</v>

2940
02:15:11.941 --> 02:15:13.260
<v Speaker 4>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should be voting online.</v>

2943
02:15:17.190 --> 02:15:19.950
<v Speaker 4>that could be easily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if the picks on the cloud,</v>

2944
02:15:19.951 --> 02:15:21.150

<v Speaker 3>So we just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a chairman and we got,</v>

2992
02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.210
<v Speaker 3>we do make goofy songs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We set,</v>

2993
02:17:30.610 --> 02:17:32.890
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's tony's crypt and chicago.</v>

2994
02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:34.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's nice setup there.</v>

2995
02:17:34.870 --> 02:17:36.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>

2996
02:17:36.011 --> 02:17:40.450
<v Speaker 3>we played some songs and shit and goof</v>
<v Speaker 3>off and do some interview stuff.</v>

2997
02:17:40.540 --> 02:17:42.340
<v Speaker 3>It's a fun time though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been good.</v>

2998
02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:43.780
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kinda,</v>

2999
02:17:43.870 --> 02:17:46.510
<v Speaker 3>it's kinda changed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3000
02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:48.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how I,</v>

3001
02:17:48.850 --> 02:17:52.600
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I talked to people I feel like a</v>

3002
02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:54.970
<v Speaker 3>better person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not because I have a podcast,</v>

3003
02:17:54.971 --> 02:17:58.060
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like I'm more in tune with</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a person is saying.</v>

3004
02:17:59.630 --> 02:18:00.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>

3005
02:18:00.780 --> 02:18:05.780
<v Speaker 3>am I ended up accidentally interviewing</v>
<v Speaker 3>people when you talk to them in real</v>

3006
02:18:06.941 --> 02:18:08.260
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like asking good,</v>

3007
02:18:08.261 --> 02:18:13.261
<v Speaker 3>quite weird like nat and a practicing</v>
<v Speaker 3>way where I ended up talking to people</v>

3008
02:18:13.361 --> 02:18:18.220
<v Speaker 3>but asking better questions then the</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you from.</v>

3009
02:18:18.221 --> 02:18:21.730
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the getting beyond the surface level.</v>

3010
02:18:21.731 --> 02:18:23.530
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's happened because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3011
02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Well I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like the same thing with me.</v>

3012
02:18:26.161 --> 02:18:29.970
<v Speaker 2>I've learned how to be a better</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation with you evolve for sure.</v>

3013
02:18:30.210 --> 02:18:33.810
<v Speaker 2>You also learn what's annoying about</v>
<v Speaker 2>your speech patterns.</v>

3014
02:18:33.930 --> 02:18:37.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say a lot of years.</v>

3015
02:18:37.130 --> 02:18:38.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I say.</v>

3016
02:18:38.371 --> 02:18:41.580
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like there's like,</v>

3017
02:18:41.850 --> 02:18:43.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3018
02:18:43.081 --> 02:18:45.030
<v Speaker 2>and like those are big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3019
02:18:45.210 --> 02:18:46.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3020
02:18:46.200 --> 02:18:49.320
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I just say three years,</v>

3021
02:18:50.800 --> 02:18:52.180
<v Speaker 2>five seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

3022
02:18:52.181 --> 02:18:55.470
<v Speaker 2>you also learned how bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of regular people are at</v>

3023
02:18:55.471 --> 02:18:59.100
<v Speaker 2>having actual conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people just waiting for you to</v>

3024
02:18:59.101 --> 02:19:02.010
<v Speaker 2>stop talking so they can talk like</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're barely paying attention to what</v>

3025
02:19:02.011 --> 02:19:02.844
<v Speaker 2>you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3026
02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:05.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being a good conversationalist.</v>

3027
02:19:05.710 --> 02:19:07.290
<v Speaker 2>It's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is</v>

3028
02:19:07.660 --> 02:19:09.220
<v Speaker 3>A lot of tools.</v>

3029
02:19:09.470 --> 02:19:10.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you,</v>

3030
02:19:10.460 --> 02:19:14.240
<v Speaker 2>did you read books and shit when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>first started or did you just go into it</v>

3031
02:19:14.300 --> 02:19:18.800
<v Speaker 2>or did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you study certain people when you,</v>

3032
02:19:19.340 --> 02:19:21.590
<v Speaker 2>as you went along or when you first</v>
<v Speaker 2>started?</v>

3033
02:19:21.700 --> 02:19:22.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3034
02:19:22.670 --> 02:19:23.960
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Total trial and error.</v>

3035
02:19:24.590 --> 02:19:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Just doing it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3036
02:19:25.931 --> 02:19:28.220
<v Speaker 2>in a thousand episodes we've done a</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand episodes</v>

3037
02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:32.720
<v Speaker 4>plus another 40 that were like fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>companions,</v>

3038
02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:35.450
<v Speaker 4>podcasts on a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>podcasts on a hike.</v>

3039
02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:37.640
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of dIfferent ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fight breakdowns.</v>

3040
02:19:38.100 --> 02:19:39.990
<v Speaker 3>How often do you listen to it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you watch?</v>

3041
02:19:40.090 --> 02:19:42.910
<v Speaker 4>I listened to occasionally I listened to</v>
<v Speaker 4>one if I think it sucks.</v>

3042
02:19:42.940 --> 02:19:45.360
<v Speaker 4>If I think I was bad or if I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3043
02:19:45.550 --> 02:19:47.980
<v Speaker 4>the person said something super</v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting,</v>

3044
02:19:47.981 --> 02:19:49.780
<v Speaker 4>like there was one the other day with</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sean Carroll.</v>

3045
02:19:50.050 --> 02:19:53.440
<v Speaker 4>He's an astrophysicist and a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a,</v>

3046
02:19:53.530 --> 02:19:58.150
<v Speaker 4>an expert and quantum theory and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>just shit.</v>

3047
02:19:58.151 --> 02:20:01.270
<v Speaker 4>He was saying it's so hard to grab a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hold of.</v>

3048
02:20:01.271 --> 02:20:03.140
<v Speaker 4>I had to listen to it several times</v>
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>

3049
02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:06.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's mostly just me asking questions</v>

3050
02:20:06.221 --> 02:20:09.010
<v Speaker 4>and hear him talk and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's just the stuff that he's saying</v>

3051
02:20:09.011 --> 02:20:11.830
<v Speaker 4>is so intense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to kind of listen to it over and</v>

3052
02:20:11.831 --> 02:20:15.850
<v Speaker 4>over again with my feeble little brain</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to try to store it,</v>

3053
02:20:16.630 --> 02:20:17.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3054
02:20:17.110 --> 02:20:18.040
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is he saying?</v>

3055
02:20:18.190 --> 02:20:21.010
<v Speaker 4>And there's another one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this woman that she's on all the time,</v>

3056
02:20:21.280 --> 02:20:22.120
<v Speaker 4>rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>patrick,</v>

3057
02:20:22.121 --> 02:20:24.460
<v Speaker 4>dr rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>patrick specialty,</v>

3058
02:20:24.740 --> 02:20:27.520
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nutritional absorption and just,</v>

3059
02:20:27.530 --> 02:20:30.610
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how nutrients affect the body.</v>

3060
02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:33.640
<v Speaker 4>That's the big thing with her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she's,</v>

3061
02:20:33.970 --> 02:20:35.630
<v Speaker 4>she's one of the smartest people I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever talked to him.</v>

3062
02:20:35.670 --> 02:20:36.690
<v Speaker 4>He's freaky smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3063
02:20:36.750 --> 02:20:39.970
<v Speaker 4>like almost like an alien,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you talking to and you realize how</v>

3064
02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:44.020
<v Speaker 4>dumb you are because you can ask her a</v>
<v Speaker 4>question about something and not only</v>

3065
02:20:44.021 --> 02:20:48.040
<v Speaker 4>can she tell you what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she'll recite the studies that were done</v>

3066
02:20:48.310 --> 02:20:51.490
<v Speaker 4>and what percentages?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The studies and it's just pulling this</v>

3067
02:20:51.520 --> 02:20:54.430
<v Speaker 4>right out of it in between our ears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's not.</v>

3068
02:20:54.480 --> 02:20:55.360
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nope,</v>

3069
02:20:55.570 --> 02:20:58.750
<v Speaker 4>pewter into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She has notes but she rarelY uses them</v>

3070
02:20:58.751 --> 02:21:00.310
<v Speaker 4>when she comes on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She'll like,</v>

3071
02:21:00.311 --> 02:21:02.590
<v Speaker 4>have something that she wants to talk</v>
<v Speaker 4>about some new study on,</v>

3072
02:21:02.591 --> 02:21:03.360
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3073
02:21:03.360 --> 02:21:06.650
<v Speaker 4>like broccoli sprouts was one that she</v>
<v Speaker 4>went over the last time because she's</v>

3074
02:21:06.670 --> 02:21:10.060
<v Speaker 4>been experimenting with broccoli sprouts</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she's a clinical researcher as well,</v>

3075
02:21:10.061 --> 02:21:14.320
<v Speaker 4>so she does actual scientific research.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she's one of them that I listened to</v>

3076
02:21:14.321 --> 02:21:17.080
<v Speaker 4>like several times to try to remember</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck she was saying.</v>

3077
02:21:17.190 --> 02:21:20.470
<v Speaker 3>So does she hit you up the same way?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually,</v>

3078
02:21:20.580 --> 02:21:24.810
<v Speaker 3>joe got this broccoli sprouts shit I</v>
<v Speaker 3>need to get off sometimes.</v>

3079
02:21:26.190 --> 02:21:27.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes</v>

3080
02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:30.580
<v Speaker 4>say I'll hit her up too because she's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>researcher too,</v>

3081
02:21:30.581 --> 02:21:33.610
<v Speaker 4>because she's always like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for lack of a better word,</v>

3082
02:21:33.611 --> 02:21:36.270
<v Speaker 4>balls deep in research and she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's like,</v>

3083
02:21:36.340 --> 02:21:38.330
<v Speaker 4>sometimes she doesn't have time to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>podcasts.</v>

3084
02:21:38.340 --> 02:21:41.320
<v Speaker 4>He's in the middle of so many different</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that she's working on.</v>

3085
02:21:41.620 --> 02:21:42.730
<v Speaker 4>Actual science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3086
02:21:43.390 --> 02:21:47.290
<v Speaker 4>that's the interesting thing about</v>
<v Speaker 4>having real scientists on as you realize</v>

3087
02:21:47.291 --> 02:21:48.940
<v Speaker 4>like what a different world they live</v>
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

3088
02:21:49.990 --> 02:21:52.590
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never have a scientist.</v>

3089
02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:58.360
<v Speaker 3>You might enjoy it maybe down the line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but right now I keep it to five pula.</v>

3090
02:21:59.050 --> 02:22:02.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep It fun and people I know and I</v>

3091
02:22:02.111 --> 02:22:06.160
<v Speaker 3>think it may be down in line as I grow</v>
<v Speaker 3>at it.</v>

3092
02:22:06.250 --> 02:22:11.050
<v Speaker 3>Then I be able to carry that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation with confidence or at least</v>

3093
02:22:11.080 --> 02:22:14.030
<v Speaker 3>lead them into what they want to say</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3094
02:22:14.031 --> 02:22:15.850
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and asking engaging questions during it.</v>

3095
02:22:15.851 --> 02:22:17.380
<v Speaker 3>But for right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keeping it,</v>

3096
02:22:17.381 --> 02:22:18.790
<v Speaker 3>rappers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedians,</v>

3097
02:22:18.791 --> 02:22:19.340
<v Speaker 3>musicians,</v>

3098
02:22:19.340 --> 02:22:22.400
<v Speaker 4>is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of my favorite podcasts that I do,</v>

3099
02:22:22.401 --> 02:22:25.550
<v Speaker 4>or like comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like yourself or my friends or um,</v>

3100
02:22:25.950 --> 02:22:28.890
<v Speaker 4>one thing I cAn tell you though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at that image of you guys,</v>

3101
02:22:29.480 --> 02:22:32.040
<v Speaker 4>this is what a mistake that we did when</v>
<v Speaker 4>we first started out.</v>

3102
02:22:32.041 --> 02:22:35.520
<v Speaker 4>We did it on couches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Problem with couches is you got to like</v>

3103
02:22:35.521 --> 02:22:38.520
<v Speaker 4>sit forward where the microphone is not</v>
<v Speaker 4>that comfortable.</v>

3104
02:22:38.770 --> 02:22:41.040
<v Speaker 4>Like I realized after awhile,</v>

<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3106
02:22:42.930 --> 02:22:47.670
<v Speaker 4>See like on this show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're sitting in these ergonomic office</v>

3107
02:22:47.671 --> 02:22:49.580
<v Speaker 4>chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're sitting in the back and,</v>

3108
02:22:49.620 --> 02:22:52.710
<v Speaker 4>but you're sitting up and you could sit</v>
<v Speaker 4>here for hours and hours at a time.</v>

3109
02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:55.950
<v Speaker 4>If you do three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sit the way byron powers is right there.</v>

3110
02:22:56.580 --> 02:22:57.900
<v Speaker 4>That shit's gonna hurt your back.</v>

3111
02:22:58.060 --> 02:22:58.711
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well we,</v>

3112
02:22:58.711 --> 02:23:01.990
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we keep about an hour and a half or so</v>

3113
02:23:02.280 --> 02:23:03.490
<v Speaker 4>hour and a half's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3114
02:23:03.720 --> 02:23:08.720
<v Speaker 4>that's right when it starts swing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like office chairs are the way to</v>

3115
02:23:10.141 --> 02:23:12.030
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a reason why they make these</v>

3116
02:23:12.031 --> 02:23:14.070
<v Speaker 4>things like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially these ergonomic ones,</v>

3117
02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:17.180
<v Speaker 4>these are from a ergo depot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're called capisce [inaudible].</v>

3118
02:23:17.220 --> 02:23:19.330
<v Speaker 4>For people that ask and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3119
02:23:19.460 --> 02:23:21.030
<v Speaker 4>they're not a sponsor or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just,</v>

3120
02:23:21.600 --> 02:23:25.710
<v Speaker 4>they're bad ass chairs and they force</v>
<v Speaker 4>you to sit up straight so you can sit in</v>

3121
02:23:25.711 --> 02:23:27.660
<v Speaker 4>these for hours and it doesn't fuck with</v>
<v Speaker 4>your back.</v>

3122
02:23:28.020 --> 02:23:29.350
<v Speaker 4>Solid tip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>joe rogan.</v>

3123
02:23:29.370 --> 02:23:30.750
<v Speaker 4>Solid tip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate it.</v>

3124
02:23:30.751 --> 02:23:34.410
<v Speaker 4>I made those mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a couch and ari shaffir took that</v>

3125
02:23:34.411 --> 02:23:35.310
<v Speaker 4>couch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He sold it.</v>

3126
02:23:35.490 --> 02:23:37.020
<v Speaker 4>I gave it to him and he did something</v>
<v Speaker 4>with it.</v>

3127
02:23:37.021 --> 02:23:39.870
<v Speaker 4>I think he evaded or something that</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody knows the couch.</v>

3128
02:23:39.990 --> 02:23:40.920
<v Speaker 4>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go on here.</v>

3129
02:23:41.690 --> 02:23:42.523
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's happening here.</v>

3130
02:23:42.780 --> 02:23:44.440
<v Speaker 5>That's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we went,</v>

3132
02:23:46.020 --> 02:23:49.350
<v Speaker 5>What does that mogue fest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Moga is the company they make</v>

3133
02:23:49.351 --> 02:23:53.340
<v Speaker 5>synthesizes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So a lot of bands you'll see they use</v>

3134
02:23:53.370 --> 02:23:54.990
<v Speaker 5>milk products.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

3135
02:23:55.890 --> 02:23:58.290
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there are many that we use on a</v>

3136
02:23:58.291 --> 02:23:59.310
<v Speaker 5>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3137
02:23:59.311 --> 02:24:03.210
<v Speaker 5>that there are many is the instrument</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you can operate with waves,</v>

3138
02:24:03.300 --> 02:24:05.940
<v Speaker 5>like just you move your hands around it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They make that.</v>

3139
02:24:06.660 --> 02:24:08.620
<v Speaker 5>And so tony,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

<v Speaker 5>And so I could be.</v>

3142
02:24:12.750 --> 02:24:14.940
<v Speaker 5>That's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That had festivals in durham.</v>

3143
02:24:15.540 --> 02:24:18.690
<v Speaker 5>So I reached out to them and they,</v>

<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

3147
02:24:26.611 --> 02:24:30.270
<v Speaker 5>a workshop where you can build your own</v>
<v Speaker 5>drum synthesizer.</v>

3148
02:24:30.390 --> 02:24:33.570
<v Speaker 5>So it's a two day workshop where you</v>
<v Speaker 5>built it,</v>

3149
02:24:33.660 --> 02:24:36.780
<v Speaker 5>they give you all the parts and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>build it from scratch and you do all the</v>

3150
02:24:36.781 --> 02:24:40.730
<v Speaker 5>solder it and school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I built this a drum at the size of</v>

3151
02:24:40.740 --> 02:24:41.570
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It may.</v>

3160
02:24:58.820 --> 02:25:00.740
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did a lot of.</v>

3161
02:25:00.980 --> 02:25:03.370
<v Speaker 5>That was my first time soldering</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything was doing.</v>

3162
02:25:03.410 --> 02:25:08.410
<v Speaker 5>I hadn't done actual building shit with</v>
<v Speaker 5>my hands in a long time,</v>

3163
02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:10.520
<v Speaker 5>but yeah.</v>

3164
02:25:10.521 --> 02:25:12.590
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then when we built them all,</v>

3165
02:25:13.070 --> 02:25:15.860
<v Speaker 5>everybody built their as an in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the end of the class,</v>

3166
02:25:16.550 --> 02:25:21.020
<v Speaker 5>linked them all together and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just kinda fucked around with them</v>

3167
02:25:21.021 --> 02:25:23.680
<v Speaker 5>and just make crazy noise.</v>

3170
02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:29.410
<v Speaker 5>That seems pretty bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3171
02:25:29.830 --> 02:25:31.900

3179
02:25:49.391 --> 02:25:52.810
<v Speaker 5>that we were able to hit them up a few</v>
<v Speaker 5>weeks before and they were able to</v>

3180
02:25:52.811 --> 02:25:54.850
<v Speaker 5>accommodate us with time slots and say</v>

3187
02:26:14.260 --> 02:26:16.660
<v Speaker 5>That's kind to be like kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>satisfying knowing that you made</v>

3188
02:26:16.661 --> 02:26:18.970
<v Speaker 5>something and I haven't used it yet</v>

3189
02:26:19.010 --> 02:26:22.040
<v Speaker 5>I had to get it from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from New York and uh,</v>

3190
02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:23.830
<v Speaker 5>bring it to chicago and started using</v>

3192
02:26:26.500 --> 02:26:30.820
<v Speaker 5>So like what do you make music?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We make songs on the podcast.</v>

3193
02:26:30.850 --> 02:26:33.280
<v Speaker 5>We do a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>instead of doing an ad read,</v>

3194
02:26:33.281 --> 02:26:38.281
<v Speaker 5>we do a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we do a jingle for you to do an original</v>

3195
02:26:38.591 --> 02:26:41.760
<v Speaker 5>song for each ad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you write the songs that you like,</v>

3196
02:26:41.770 --> 02:26:43.640
<v Speaker 5>what their talking points.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3197
02:26:43.900 --> 02:26:45.220
<v Speaker 5>we do well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we do the,</v>

3198
02:26:45.250 --> 02:26:49.560
<v Speaker 5>we do the song and it's kind of hooky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Usually just based is saying the same</v>

3199
02:26:49.570 --> 02:26:51.780
<v Speaker 5>like we got bev was one our sponsor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we go blah,</v>

3200
02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:54.190
<v Speaker 5>blah blah blah blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he'll produce around it.</v>

3201
02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:58.390
<v Speaker 5>and then we'll do to read after the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3202
02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:03.560
<v Speaker 5>the saw this is that there are many that</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's talking about to wave your hands</v>

3203
02:27:03.611 --> 02:27:06.700
<v Speaker 5>over it and it makes music,</v>
<v Speaker 5>millimeter stereo headphone out.</v>

3204
02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:15.850
<v Speaker 5>The other antenna will control that hand</v>
<v Speaker 5>technique.</v>

3205
02:27:16.090 --> 02:27:19.310
<v Speaker 5>I usually do a full openhand that's mars</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

3206
02:27:19.420 --> 02:27:20.620
<v Speaker 5>It's real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a weird,</v>

3207
02:27:20.621 --> 02:27:22.670
<v Speaker 5>weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's fun man in it.</v>

3208
02:27:22.690 --> 02:27:27.690
<v Speaker 5>so we've made some beats with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's fascinating.</v>

3209
02:27:27.811 --> 02:27:29.780
<v Speaker 5>I've never heard of this thing before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3210
02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:32.430
<v Speaker 5>we really used that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean we have an tonio,</v>

3211
02:27:32.710 --> 02:27:36.870
<v Speaker 5>he'll have a drum machine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We got a microphone that does like auto</v>

3212
02:27:36.871 --> 02:27:38.840
<v Speaker 5>tune and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3213
02:27:38.850 --> 02:27:43.800
<v Speaker 5>So it's really to cover up that we're a</v>
<v Speaker 5>bad interviews,</v>

3214
02:27:45.850 --> 02:27:47.520
<v Speaker 5>you'll be alone and we can't take us</v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

3215
02:27:47.521 --> 02:27:51.550
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just started goofing off and make it</v>

3216
02:27:51.551 --> 02:27:53.050
<v Speaker 5>a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So do you think like you'd probably not</v>

3217
02:27:53.051 --> 02:27:54.850
<v Speaker 5>an interview.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you just having a conversation?</v>

3218

<v Speaker 5>So It's just kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like a third host of the</v>

3251
02:29:10.241 --> 02:29:12.970
<v Speaker 5>show when the person finds out what it</v>
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

3252
02:29:12.971 --> 02:29:14.560
<v Speaker 5>And I explained it pretty much</v>

3253

<v Speaker 2>itunes,</v>

3256
02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:24.190
<v Speaker 2>soundcloud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other ones.</v>

3257
02:29:24.260 --> 02:29:26.020
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else you got?</v>

3258
02:29:26.500 --> 02:29:29.850
<v Speaker 2>What is it like google play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>google play,</v>

3259
02:29:30.310 --> 02:29:32.560
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how few people bring up</v>

3260
02:29:32.561 --> 02:29:37.210
<v Speaker 2>google play because like half the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>have android dome thing isn't like</v>

3261
02:29:38.050 --> 02:29:41.620
<v Speaker 2>google play never gets discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can get google play on an iphone</v>

3262
02:29:41.621 --> 02:29:42.280
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3263
02:29:42.280 --> 02:29:46.330
<v Speaker 2>but you can't get itunes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you get itunes on an android phone?</v>

3264
02:29:46.390 --> 02:29:50.510
<v Speaker 2>You can't get the podcasts on google</v>
<v Speaker 2>play on the iphone because there's a</v>

3265
02:29:50.680 --> 02:29:55.580
<v Speaker 2>podcast app which google apps on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone or whatever.</v>

3266
02:29:56.110 --> 02:29:59.470
<v Speaker 2>They don't let you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they let you use some podcast apps,</v>

3267
02:29:59.471 --> 02:30:00.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

3268
02:30:00.980 --> 02:30:03.300
<v Speaker 2>just that comedy podcasts app,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that arch fear is always,</v>

3269
02:30:03.400 --> 02:30:06.250
<v Speaker 2>is different though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a comedy app that's aggregating.</v>

3270
02:30:06.920 --> 02:30:09.430
<v Speaker 2>Let's see how many things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't let you choose an actual</v>

3271
02:30:09.431 --> 02:30:12.010
<v Speaker 2>podcast app other than there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

3272
02:30:12.011 --> 02:30:13.750
<v Speaker 2>I could be speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think so.</v>

3273
02:30:14.020 --> 02:30:14.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3274
02:30:14.710 --> 02:30:16.510
<v Speaker 2>it's a tough road for those android</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3275
02:30:17.100 --> 02:30:20.460
<v Speaker 2>It's tough road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People just look at you illegitimately</v>

3276
02:30:20.470 --> 02:30:22.660
<v Speaker 2>if you green text message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It hasn't.</v>

3282
02:30:36.010 --> 02:30:38.440
<v Speaker 2>They just showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put up a picture where you can only see</v>

3283
02:30:38.441 --> 02:30:40.420
<v Speaker 2>like the corner and the rest of it's all</v>
<v Speaker 2>shaded out.</v>

3284
02:30:40.421 --> 02:30:41.570
<v Speaker 2>I'll see if I can find it real quick.</v>

<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Brownlee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a video where marcus is</v>

3310
02:31:48.841 --> 02:31:50.250
<v Speaker 2>watching it and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

3311
02:31:50.280 --> 02:31:52.400

<v Speaker 2>Goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can tell shit.</v>

3313
02:31:54.150 --> 02:31:56.610
<v Speaker 2>You could see my reaction to it and by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>

3314
02:31:56.611 --> 02:31:58.620
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reaction is not even to the finished</v>

3315
02:31:58.621 --> 02:32:00.240
<v Speaker 2>product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be even better than it is</v>

3316
02:32:00.241 --> 02:32:02.250
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you see how the aside edges have</v>

3317
02:32:02.251 --> 02:32:05.550
<v Speaker 2>those weird grips to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really kind of interesting.</v>

3318
02:32:07.560 --> 02:32:10.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a mess and with it.</v>

3319
02:32:10.381 --> 02:32:13.410
<v Speaker 2>But you could see like when he's holding</v>
<v Speaker 2>it in his hand,</v>

3320
02:32:13.470 --> 02:32:18.070
<v Speaker 2>like what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that it just talking about it?</v>

3321
02:32:18.100 --> 02:32:20.130
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a different video than</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one I saw.</v>

3322
02:32:20.520 --> 02:32:22.500
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was on a couch.</v>

3323
02:32:23.310 --> 02:32:24.143
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>

3324
02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:28.170
<v Speaker 2>And you see the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't look like any other phone</v>

3325
02:32:28.171 --> 02:32:30.000
<v Speaker 2>you've ever seen before.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like see the sides of it.</v>

3327
02:32:32.640 --> 02:32:35.460
<v Speaker 2>It's all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got like ripples.</v>

3328
02:32:35.970 --> 02:32:38.700
<v Speaker 2>Like finger slots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3329
02:32:38.850 --> 02:32:40.350

<v Speaker 2>But he's got big hands so you can't tell</v>

3331
02:32:44.071 --> 02:32:45.570
<v Speaker 2>as much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got tiny hands.</v>

3332
02:32:45.571 --> 02:32:46.970
<v Speaker 2>I'd be trapped in this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To you.</v>

3333
02:32:47.460 --> 02:32:49.020
<v Speaker 2>which one do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A regular iphone?</v>

3334
02:32:49.050 --> 02:32:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get the one because my hands</v>

3335
02:32:51.301 --> 02:32:54.870
<v Speaker 2>can't enter this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to end it,</v>

3336
02:32:55.530 --> 02:32:56.363
<v Speaker 2>but there's so much.</v>

3337
02:32:56.370 --> 02:32:58.080
<v Speaker 2>It's so worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you go online,</v>

3338
02:32:58.230 --> 02:33:00.540
<v Speaker 2>like if you go online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to read something online,</v>

3339
02:33:00.541 --> 02:33:02.310

<v Speaker 2>screen.</v>

3340
02:33:02.340 --> 02:33:06.720
<v Speaker 2>It's just the experience and looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures and videos of fireworks and</v>

3341
02:33:06.721 --> 02:33:09.480
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

3342
02:33:09.481 --> 02:33:11.280
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little worried too that they</v>

3343
02:33:11.281 --> 02:33:12.810
<v Speaker 2>announced something they won't be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to deliver on,</v>

3344
02:33:12.811 --> 02:33:14.490
<v Speaker 2>which happens from time to time.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You see that little video showing how</v>

3364
02:34:06.450 --> 02:34:08.430
<v Speaker 2>people to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're in the floods,</v>

3365
02:34:08.460 --> 02:34:13.140
<v Speaker 2>how to charge their phones off of a nine</v>
<v Speaker 2>volt battery and a,</v>

3366
02:34:13.290 --> 02:34:15.010
<v Speaker 2>and a in a key.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3367
02:34:15.510 --> 02:34:20.510
<v Speaker 2>it lookS sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in a nine volt battery,</v>

3368
02:34:21.870 --> 02:34:24.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put the in a car charger.</v>

3369
02:34:25.810 --> 02:34:26.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the internet too much.</v>

3370
02:34:31.260 --> 02:34:33.400
<v Speaker 5>It's unplugged.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does happen.</v>

3371
02:34:33.650 --> 02:34:35.490
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a different lady I saw.</v>

3372
02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:40.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's got a car charger and she takes</v>

3373
02:34:40.301 --> 02:34:43.390
<v Speaker 2>the car charger and sticks on the end of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nine volt battery,</v>

3374
02:34:43.630 --> 02:34:47.050
<v Speaker 2>like One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the slots and then puts a key in</v>

3375
02:34:47.051 --> 02:34:48.740
<v Speaker 2>the other slot and I think you've got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>touch it.</v>

3376
02:34:49.030 --> 02:34:51.760
<v Speaker 2>You get the circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if this lady just burst into flames</v>

3377
02:34:51.761 --> 02:34:54.640
<v Speaker 2>and lost her islands so you can get</v>
<v Speaker 2>electrocuted by doing this.</v>

3378
02:34:55.300 --> 02:34:56.230
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be careful.</v>

3379
02:34:56.231 --> 02:34:57.940
<v Speaker 2>But It's a nine volt battery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>

3380
02:34:57.941 --> 02:35:00.430
<v Speaker 2>And obviously won't be a big charge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

3381
02:35:00.431 --> 02:35:03.160
<v Speaker 2>but it will charge the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she touches the two of them together.</v>

3382
02:35:03.161 --> 02:35:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That works.</v>

3383
02:35:04.511 --> 02:35:07.630
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nuts.</v>

3384
02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:10.510
<v Speaker 2>So if you're in a pinch and all you got</v>
<v Speaker 2>to nine volt battery and you need to</v>

3385
02:35:10.511 --> 02:35:14.320
<v Speaker 2>call nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make a battery adapter for an</v>

3386
02:35:14.321 --> 02:35:16.300
<v Speaker 2>iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't they make a little thing where</v>

3387
02:35:16.301 --> 02:35:18.160
<v Speaker 2>you can plug a nine volt battery into</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3388
02:35:18.220 --> 02:35:20.110
<v Speaker 2>Just go to a store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buy a battery,</v>

3389
02:35:20.170 --> 02:35:22.180
<v Speaker 2>plugged that fucker in and charge your</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>

3390
02:35:22.900 --> 02:35:26.930
<v Speaker 2>Does anybody have that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do they not have that?</v>

3391
02:35:27.170 --> 02:35:28.940
<v Speaker 2>Because they have those banks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3392
02:35:28.941 --> 02:35:31.700
<v Speaker 2>there's a power bank so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>plug your shit into.</v>

3393
02:35:33.250 --> 02:35:35.540
<v Speaker 6>It seems like somebody would have this.</v>

02:35:50.011 --> 02:35:52.290
<v Speaker 2>was on mashable and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out of here.</v>

3401
02:35:52.470 --> 02:35:55.560
<v Speaker 2>The thing goes eight miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sit on a fucker and you ride around</v>

3402
02:35:55.561 --> 02:35:58.680
<v Speaker 2>the airport with it as a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's legit.</v>

3403
02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:01.360
<v Speaker 2>I said related.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one way to stunt.</v>

3404
02:36:02.030 --> 02:36:06.520
<v Speaker 2>That's one way to handle a layover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>just drive around the airport until</v>

3405
02:36:06.540 --> 02:36:08.490
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your luggage runs out of batteries,</v>

3406
02:36:08.940 --> 02:36:12.150
<v Speaker 2>but you can also use the battery</v>
<v Speaker 2>charging of that,</v>

3407
02:36:12.210 --> 02:36:14.190
<v Speaker 2>the battery and use It to charge your</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>

3408
02:36:14.191 --> 02:36:16.860
<v Speaker 2>Like you can plug your phone into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That alone is worth it.</v>

3409
02:36:17.130 --> 02:36:19.200
<v Speaker 2>Like always having battery power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3410
02:36:19.201 --> 02:36:22.500
<v Speaker 2>They're connected to your luggage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of the.</v>

3411
02:36:22.510 --> 02:36:23.400
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3412
02:36:23.430 --> 02:36:25.410
<v Speaker 2>luggages are doing that now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

3413
02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a carry on.</v>

3414
02:36:28.260 --> 02:36:30.930
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People having a good old time.</v>

3415
02:36:30.990 --> 02:36:31.860
<v Speaker 2>I have to go.</v>

3416
02:36:34.430 --> 02:36:37.540
<v Speaker 5>I got to get online and media bias.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come on.</v>

3417
02:36:37.930 --> 02:36:38.140

<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look.</v>

3420
02:36:42.010 --> 02:36:43.930
<v Speaker 2>See?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's fitting her stuff in there and</v>

3421
02:36:43.931 --> 02:36:46.210
<v Speaker 2>then she drives off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will look at this.</v>

3422
02:36:46.211 --> 02:36:49.000
<v Speaker 2>She could plug into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I like to see.</v>

3423
02:36:49.001 --> 02:36:50.700
<v Speaker 2>You write that in an airport though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>

3424
02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:54.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know if I do it.</v>

3425
02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:56.650
<v Speaker 2>What you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that.</v>

3426
02:36:57.100 --> 02:36:59.500
<v Speaker 2>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had a gyroscope.</v>

3427
02:36:59.501 --> 02:37:02.290
<v Speaker 2>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting that backup a little bit</v>

3428
02:37:02.350 --> 02:37:05.890
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's just a segue just to</v>

3429
02:37:05.891 --> 02:37:06.724
<v Speaker 2>show you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3430
02:37:07.480 --> 02:37:09.710
<v Speaker 2>is there a standard option?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3431
02:37:10.990 --> 02:37:12.520
<v Speaker 2>can uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you stand up?</v>

3432
02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:14.320

<v Speaker 2>Go up?</v>

3433
02:37:14.410 --> 02:37:15.243
<v Speaker 2>And then</v>

3434
02:37:16.550 --> 02:37:19.060
<v Speaker 3>this is why that doesn't work because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>can fail.</v>

3435
02:37:19.140 --> 02:37:20.610
<v Speaker 2>Fail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
