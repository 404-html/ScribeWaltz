00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.280
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience fucking 16 hours to remote audio book.</v>

2
00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:04.730
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:05.563
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

4
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.520
<v Speaker 1>I cannot read out loud to save my life.</v>

5
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.870
<v Speaker 1>16 hours.</v>

6
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.970
<v Speaker 1>How many hours is the actual audio book?</v>

7
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.833
<v Speaker 1>Three.</v>

8
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.733
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

9
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.030
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

10
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I am the worst out loud reader and for like the first two chapters get mad if</v>

11
00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:18.884
<v Speaker 1>you fuck it up.</v>

12
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:19.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.500
<v Speaker 1>The guy who asked me like are the first,</v>

14
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.611
<v Speaker 1>first chapter.</v>

15
00:00:22.611 --> 00:00:22.851
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

16
00:00:22.851 --> 00:00:23.061
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

17
00:00:23.061 --> 00:00:23.990
<v Speaker 1>do you need glasses?</v>

18
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.221
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

19
00:00:25.221 --> 00:00:25.421
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

20
00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

21
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.331
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that good at it.</v>

22
00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:26.691
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

23
00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:27.411
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it drunk.</v>

24
00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Everyone wants to hear me do a drunk,</v>

25
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.960
<v Speaker 1>you can't fucking read drunk.</v>

26
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.670
<v Speaker 1>So then I described that day,</v>

27
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.040
<v Speaker 1>that day is all you supposed to had to go back and Redo it.</v>

28
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.540
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

29
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.220
<v Speaker 1>and then I was also like,</v>

30
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>like I'd read a passage and then I go on and be like,</v>

31
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

32
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.090
<v Speaker 1>and then I'd expound on what I just read and kind of was like an,</v>

33
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.980
<v Speaker 1>I was like a podcast and that was fucking horrible cause that took like forever.</v>

34
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.030
<v Speaker 1>And so that finally the guys like,</v>

35
00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:50.864
<v Speaker 1>just fucking read it.</v>

36
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.790
<v Speaker 1>So I'll just read it towards the end,</v>

37
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.780
<v Speaker 1>but it gets better.</v>

38
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.080
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd be better if you just read it and if you fucked up,</v>

39
00:00:57.081 --> 00:00:59.900
<v Speaker 2>just comment on the fact that you fucked that word up and just keep going on</v>

40
00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:01.220
<v Speaker 2>like that way people would,</v>

41
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.083
<v Speaker 2>they would get,</v>

42
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.560
<v Speaker 2>they'd get the book,</v>

43
00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:04.281
<v Speaker 2>the whole book,</v>

44
00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:07.790
<v Speaker 2>but they'd also get like experience of you reading the book.</v>

45
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.580
<v Speaker 2>Like you separating yourself from the book while you're at it.</v>

46
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.271
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

47
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

48
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it's going to sound like but cause I,</v>

49
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.890
<v Speaker 1>I did acknowledge it.</v>

50
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:16.431
<v Speaker 1>I did one,</v>

51
00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:21.431
<v Speaker 1>I did fuck up cause I'm a comic so I would work the piece as I was like if I was</v>

52
00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:22.274
<v Speaker 1>on stage.</v>

53
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.950
<v Speaker 1>And did they keep that in or do they edit that stuff?</v>

54
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.520
<v Speaker 1>They kept s I think they kept some of it in but they couldn't have kept all of</v>

55
00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:28.880
<v Speaker 1>it in.</v>

56
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.870
<v Speaker 1>That's so weird though that they decide what gets left in and what comes out.</v>

57
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.100
<v Speaker 1>This whole to this whole book writing process has been vulnerable as fucked</v>

58
00:01:36.101 --> 00:01:36.620
<v Speaker 1>because you,</v>

59
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.830
<v Speaker 1>you really let go of it because it's an entirely different industry.</v>

60
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.171
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

61
00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:40.591
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

62
00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:41.424
<v Speaker 2>I passed,</v>

63
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.600
<v Speaker 2>I had a book deal.</v>

64
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 2>I was writing the book and they were still giving these old wacky fucking notes.</v>

65
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 2>Just advice on like how I should talk about things,</v>

66
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:52.680
<v Speaker 2>what I should describe and how I was like,</v>

67
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:53.130
<v Speaker 2>we're not,</v>

68
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.270
<v Speaker 2>this is not happening.</v>

69
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.630
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

70
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 2>you're not involved in the creative process.</v>

71
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 2>I gave them their money back.</v>

72
00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.531
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

73
00:01:58.531 --> 00:01:59.370
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy.</v>

74
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.480
<v Speaker 2>Like they wanted me to essentially write my act down on paper and sell it as a</v>

75
00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:05.521
<v Speaker 2>book and they're like,</v>

76
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 2>well George Carlin did it and Jerry Seinfeld did it.</v>

77
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

78
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

79
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.473
<v Speaker 2>that's nice.</v>

80
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.461
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck.</v>

81
00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:11.294
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing that.</v>

82
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.370
<v Speaker 2>I write different than I do stand up.</v>

83
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.420
<v Speaker 2>It's two different things.</v>

84
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.940
<v Speaker 2>Like you can write when you're writing,</v>

85
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.960
<v Speaker 2>like just writing.</v>

86
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.920
<v Speaker 2>There's a way that you can express yourself that's unavailable if you're</v>

87
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:23.754
<v Speaker 2>talking,</v>

88
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

89
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.150
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

90
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.730
<v Speaker 1>it's why you,</v>

91
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.510
<v Speaker 1>the dragon dictate didn't work for me cause you'd talk it into this dragon</v>

92
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.010
<v Speaker 1>dictate and it would put it right into the computer,</v>

93
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.203
<v Speaker 1>like print it.</v>

94
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.130
<v Speaker 1>But it didn't work for me because it sounded spoken like it sounded like and,</v>

95
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.400
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

96
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.670
<v Speaker 1>and a couple like,</v>

97
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.400
<v Speaker 1>and one of the hard things for me was I,</v>

98
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.380
<v Speaker 1>I did that same thing where they wanted to,</v>

99
00:02:41.381 --> 00:02:44.540
<v Speaker 1>all the stories I had told on stage or on podcasts,</v>

100
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.201
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

101
00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:45.650
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

102
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.131
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that.</v>

103
00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:47.230
<v Speaker 1>I can't just fill it up with that.</v>

104
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.621
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

105
00:02:47.621 --> 00:02:49.900
<v Speaker 2>They want the stuff that they think they're going to sell.</v>

106
00:02:49.901 --> 00:02:50.710
<v Speaker 2>It's not a,</v>

107
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.850
<v Speaker 2>an artistic thing.</v>

108
00:02:51.851 --> 00:02:52.181
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

109
00:02:52.181 --> 00:02:53.170
<v Speaker 2>guess what dummy?</v>

110
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.270
<v Speaker 2>The same person that told those funny stories.</v>

111
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.130
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you other funny stories,</v>

112
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.990
<v Speaker 2>like we're not running out of funny stories here.</v>

113
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.880
<v Speaker 1>It's really fascinating.</v>

114
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.050
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

115
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 1>and their stories,</v>

116
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>I had to put in the book,</v>

117
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>I had to put the machine in.</v>

118
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>I can't not write that in there.</v>

119
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:06.881
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of,</v>

120
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 1>there's like the Will Smith Story.</v>

121
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 1>I had to put it in,</v>

122
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.580
<v Speaker 1>but then I wanted to do this several polls.</v>

123
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 1>One I wanted to do one where I met Ralph Sampson and when I was a kid I was</v>

124
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.533
<v Speaker 1>Ralph Sampson.</v>

125
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

126
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 1>he was a basketball player and I was,</v>

127
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 1>I went to school at,</v>

128
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>I went to,</v>

129
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>I was like in eighth grade I decided I really wanted to be a basketball player.</v>

130
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:27.241
<v Speaker 1>And so I went to Villanova basketball camp and Ralph Sampson came to speak.</v>

131
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 1>And like the first night I got a concussion and the two best basketball players</v>

132
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>got pulled out for drinking.</v>

133
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 1>So the next day I had to sit out with the two best possible players and everyone</v>

134
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 1>thought we drank together.</v>

135
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 1>So now all of a sudden I'm 15,</v>

136
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 1>14 and everyone thinks I'm cool because I'm parting with the 18 year olds.</v>

137
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.031
<v Speaker 1>So Ralph Sampson,</v>

138
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>coms,</v>

139
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.410
<v Speaker 1>I thought this define me.</v>

140
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Ralph Sampson comes up to give a speech.</v>

141
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:46.571
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

142
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:49.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to talk to you about two things there.</v>

143
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 1>5,000 kids on the gym floor.</v>

144
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.061
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

145
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:55.300

150
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 1>but I was the only fucking person,</v>

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.370
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't know the answer.</v>

196
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.130

199
00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:21.410
<v Speaker 1>legs the whole fucking time.</v>

200
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Cracking jokes while I'm cracking jokes.</v>

201
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 1>And how long did you hold the basketball?</v>

202
00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:25.834
<v Speaker 1>An hour.</v>

203
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.530
<v Speaker 1>That's a long time by my cousin ape.</v>

204
00:05:27.531 --> 00:05:28.540
<v Speaker 1>I almost brought him here to there.</v>

205
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:28.871
<v Speaker 1>I should have,</v>

206
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think about it.</v>

207
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 1>My cousin aid was there at the camp even cause he's from Philly.</v>

208
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:33.634
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know anyone.</v>

209
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.421
<v Speaker 1>My cousin,</v>

210
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

211
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.560
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even,</v>

212
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.370
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know you partied.</v>

213
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.551
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

214
00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:37.384
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

215
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

216
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 1>I just thought we'd all put our fucking hands off.</v>

217
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.441
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

218
00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:41.621
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

219
00:05:41.621 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 1>why would you put your hands up if you don't party?</v>

220
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:43.211
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

221
00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:44.140
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be cool.</v>

222
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.621
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

223
00:05:45.621 --> 00:05:48.430
<v Speaker 1>so like so now and then everyone would come up and they'd be like,</v>

224
00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:48.911
<v Speaker 1>party animal,</v>

225

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

227
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>But then I became cool at that camp and then I have friends and so I wrote that</v>

228
00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:57.290
<v Speaker 1>story is a little longer and I gave to them,</v>

229
00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

230
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 1>this is the best story.</v>

231
00:05:58.791 --> 00:05:59.720
<v Speaker 1>This defines me.</v>

232
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.810
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

233
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:01.643
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

234
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.001
<v Speaker 1>I'm out.</v>

235
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

236
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.650
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

237
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.090
<v Speaker 1>So it's all partying stories,</v>

238
00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's like that's a hilarious story.</v>

239
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Don't thanks so nutty that this could have possibly sent you on a path when you</v>

240
00:06:12.711 --> 00:06:13.544
<v Speaker 1>were that young.</v>

241
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

242
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.991
<v Speaker 1>13 years old.</v>

243
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:15.370
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

244
00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

245
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.570
<v Speaker 1>and it's all just wanting to be accepted.</v>

246
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:18.140
<v Speaker 1>I remember.</v>

247
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever have one of those moments where you'd go somewhere and you didn't</v>

248
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>know anybody but you felt like everyone fucking grew up together?</v>

249
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

250
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:24.830
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird feeling.</v>

251
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.720
<v Speaker 1>I felt like that a lot as a kid.</v>

252
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

253
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.030
<v Speaker 1>But I thought that that define me because then I became the,</v>

254
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.350
<v Speaker 1>I became the party animal but kind of lived up to whatever.</v>

255
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:34.341
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

256
00:06:34.341 --> 00:06:35.570
<v Speaker 1>I went to high school the very next year.</v>

257
00:06:35.571 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 1>It didn't know anyone,</v>

258
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 1>so I'm sure that kind of,</v>

259
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:38.151
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

260
00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:39.470
<v Speaker 1>well it worked in Villanova.</v>

261
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.701
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

262
00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely different personality that develops when kids have to move to</v>

263
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.361
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

264
00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:48.030
<v Speaker 1>If they move from one spot to another spot and move more than once they develop</v>

265
00:06:48.031 --> 00:06:48.231
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

266
00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Like it's this weird newcomer personality,</v>

267
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

268
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.490
<v Speaker 1>in every romantic kids movie,</v>

269
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:57.020
<v Speaker 1>the rebel that moved into town,</v>

270
00:06:57.021 --> 00:07:00.320
<v Speaker 1>the new kid that you don't know if any think he smoked cigarettes and fucking</v>

271
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:03.950
<v Speaker 1>twilight style movie or even like karate kid.</v>

272
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he like move into some new town dude,</v>

273
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.083
<v Speaker 1>crazy kid.</v>

274
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.771
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking,</v>

275
00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:10.820
<v Speaker 1>the day karate kid came out,</v>

276
00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:12.080
<v Speaker 1>it was my first day of tennis camp.</v>

277
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:13.863
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

278
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.043
<v Speaker 1>so I go,</v>

279
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.120
<v Speaker 1>I gotta fucking can't believe I didn't write about this.</v>

280
00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.040
<v Speaker 1>This I didn't mean no anyone.</v>

281
00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:19.874
<v Speaker 1>I know anyone.</v>

282
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:20.773
<v Speaker 1>So then the,</v>

283
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.580
<v Speaker 1>these all the La Veranda camp,</v>

284
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:24.230
<v Speaker 1>I started meeting the cool kids and they were like,</v>

285
00:07:24.231 --> 00:07:24.471

287
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:25.521
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

288
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:26.210
