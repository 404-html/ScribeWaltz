00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 1>You were the one that kept the peace because Kevin was,</v>

264
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 1>was losing his mind.</v>

265
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 1>And even high end Gracie kept saying,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we'll be okay.</v>

269
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:03.441
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

270
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:03.621
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

271
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

272
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.761
<v Speaker 1>just trust me.</v>

273
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:05.450
<v Speaker 1>We're okay.</v>

274
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.201
<v Speaker 1>And I swear to God,</v>

275
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 1>I thought he might've had a gun,</v>

276
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.800
<v Speaker 1>but what are you buddy buddy buddy saying like,</v>

277
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:09.643
<v Speaker 1>well that's going on.</v>

278
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.100
<v Speaker 1>You would it be okay about,</v>

279
00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.391
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

280
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:15.190
<v Speaker 1>So he bought some weed from some of my bounces there and,</v>

281
00:06:15.191 --> 00:06:15.550
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

282
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't look,</v>

283
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.611
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

284
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:16.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

285

00:06:17.321 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a felony there.</v>

288
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:20.870
<v Speaker 1>So I just get it and we walk off and while we would walk off,</v>

289
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.820
<v Speaker 1>we realized that I pick it out.</v>

290
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:23.180
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

291
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.571
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

292
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:24.650
<v Speaker 1>that is not enough.</v>

293
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 1>So I go back and I say,</v>

294
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

295
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.111

00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:27.771
<v Speaker 1>You need to give me more.</v>

297
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:28.101
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

298
00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:28.221
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

299
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:29.000
<v Speaker 1>that's not going happen.</v>

300
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Speaker 1>And he has this attitude.</v>

301
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.661
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

302
00:06:30.661 --> 00:06:30.921
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

303
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 1>well let me do it different.</v>

304
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be back in 10 minutes.</v>

305
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:34.970
<v Speaker 1>We are going to be back in 10 minutes.</v>

306
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.811
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

307
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:36.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

308
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.370

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:37.203
<v Speaker 1>that'd be here.</v>

310
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 1>So we walk around and we thought,</v>

311
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

312
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 1>maybe we should light it up.</v>

313
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:43.070
<v Speaker 1>At least we relax and we're in this weird,</v>

314
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.390
<v Speaker 1>what is it though?</v>

315
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.460
<v Speaker 1>There's meal boxes.</v>

316
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.891
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

317
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:46.724
<v Speaker 1>it's a</v>

318
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.843
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>

319
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.910
<v Speaker 1>And suddenly randomly start jumping up and she started getting angry and he hit</v>

320
00:06:55.411 --> 00:06:58.760
<v Speaker 1>a mailbox and then Ryan starts and I'll try to keep these boats,</v>

321
00:06:58.761 --> 00:06:59.421
<v Speaker 1>these guys down.</v>

322
00:06:59.421 --> 00:06:59.691

338
00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:09.711

345
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Finally everybody calmed down.</v>

346
00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:18.260
<v Speaker 1>We go back and these guys probably call somebody,</v>

371
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:51.140
<v Speaker 1>And he puts it down and he gave us a whole mountain</v>

392
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:22.730
<v Speaker 1>but no one,</v>

393
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.280
<v Speaker 1>nobody would notice the occlusive.</v>

394
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:26.360
<v Speaker 1>His name is Hans and drugs.</v>

395
00:08:26.361 --> 00:08:27.380
<v Speaker 1>They don't do anything like that.</v>

396
00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:30.500
<v Speaker 1>But real estate to show you saw people sitting down,</v>

<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

401
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:40.820
<v Speaker 1>That was where Masato the week boxer was.</v>

402
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Mickey Rourke was,</v>

403
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.400
<v Speaker 1>they're all 60 and we ran this a strip club and uh,</v>

404
00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:50.900
<v Speaker 1>this guy sits there and I'm with long hair and he comes over to me and says,</v>

405
00:08:50.901 --> 00:08:51.201
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

406

407
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.120
<v Speaker 1>Like a little feminine.</v>

408
00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:53.954
<v Speaker 1>That really weird.</v>

409
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.970
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be the biggest fan of biggest failures or we've got this crazy guy</v>

410
00:08:56.971 --> 00:08:57.151
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

411
00:08:57.151 --> 00:08:57.361
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

412
00:08:57.361 --> 00:08:59.220
<v Speaker 1>And I had no clue what to think.</v>

413
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:00.300
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

414
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:00.870
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

415
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.021
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

416
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:01.621
<v Speaker 1>you're a great fighter.</v>

417
00:09:01.621 --> 00:09:02.401
<v Speaker 1>You want to know what I do?</v>

418
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:05.280
<v Speaker 1>And he takes his shirt off and he's all tatted up and people start literally</v>

419
00:09:05.281 --> 00:09:06.330
<v Speaker 1>leaving the place there.</v>

420
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:06.930
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

421
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.240
<v Speaker 1>I realize he's Jaga right?</v>

422
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:09.090
<v Speaker 1>So we started talking,</v>

423
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:13.410
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about it and then a tattooed that I wanted them this color.</v>

424
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:13.981
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

425
00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:15.180
<v Speaker 1>but in America it's hard to find.</v>

426
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:17.220
<v Speaker 1>At the time people only wanted to use black ink.</v>

427
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.001
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

428
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:18.151
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

429
00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:18.901
<v Speaker 1>that's not hard at all.</v>

430
00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you come tomorrow morning?</v>

431
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:20.731
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

432
00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:21.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

433
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.350
<v Speaker 1>W I can do this for you.</v>

434
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.540
<v Speaker 1>So the next day he and I,</v>

435
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:27.840
<v Speaker 1>we go to this dodgy like five stories under the ground.</v>

436
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.673
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

437
00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:30.300
<v Speaker 1>It was the weirdest place.</v>

438
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.670
<v Speaker 1>We opened the door.</v>

439
00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:34.760
<v Speaker 1>There is a cage would have back that Masako</v>

440
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:40.800
<v Speaker 1>indicates with two dobermans do fly up against the thing.</v>

441
00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:43.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like just human skulls everywhere.</v>

442
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.450
<v Speaker 1>This pictures of books killing people.</v>

443
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

444
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:46.613
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

445
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:47.100
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

446
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.980
