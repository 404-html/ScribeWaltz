00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the main things,</v>

2
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:09.771
<v Speaker 1>I think that my advice would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot easier to focus on what you</v>

3
00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:15.441
<v Speaker 1>should eat then on what you shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that an more inclusionary</v>

4
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>diet is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is key.</v>

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.180
<v Speaker 1>So focusing on what your body needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:25.410
<v Speaker 1>not only for short term but what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs for long term focus on that more</v>

7
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:26.750
<v Speaker 1>than yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

8
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 1>because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

9
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>if you focus on what you're limiting</v>
<v Speaker 1>from your diet,</v>

10
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:34.020
<v Speaker 1>then you're not going to be getting all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good stuff that you need.</v>

11
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.150
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the talking a lot about</v>
<v Speaker 1>loss.</v>

12
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>You're also thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>

13
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:42.630
<v Speaker 1>it's so there's too many little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to become caught up in a lot</v>

14
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 1>of minutia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 1>and I know this because I've been there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

16
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.960
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:50.670
<v Speaker 1>getting caught up in all this little</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutia,</v>

18
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can take you forever to try to figure</v>

19
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>out what's going on.</v>

20
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>And then in the meantime you're getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>distracted from the important thing is</v>

21
00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>not as what you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

22
00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:01.080
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body is very resilient.</v>

23
00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 1>And if you feed it what it needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can fight off stuff.</v>

24
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>You're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to age better.</v>

25
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these little chemical reactions and</v>

26
00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>enzymatic reactions going on in all your</v>
<v Speaker 1>cells,</v>

27
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.570
<v Speaker 1>in your liver and your kidney and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

28
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>All these things are going to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening because you're feeding it.</v>

29
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.770
<v Speaker 1>And when you have a little bit of toxic</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

30
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.470
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these pathways are ready because</v>

31
00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:21.270
<v Speaker 1>they're so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting nourished,</v>

32
00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:23.370
<v Speaker 1>are getting what they need that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>activate in the,</v>

33
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 1>your body has protective mechanisms to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure it doesn't get cancered.</v>

34
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I explained that when you make reactive</v>

35
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:32.100
<v Speaker 1>oxygen species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can repair it or you can do the cell</v>

36
00:01:32.101 --> 00:01:32.430
<v Speaker 1>will die.</v>

37
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>But all those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those repair a stress response</v>

38
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:38.280
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they require that,</v>

39
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

40
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.920
<v Speaker 1>you're giving yourselves what they need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

41
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 1>So if you're so focused on what not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat,</v>

42
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>that you're not getting enough of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need,</v>

43
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.610
<v Speaker 1>then your body is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>capacity to do that isn't going to be as</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimal.</v>

45
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>So I really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think it's easier,</v>

46
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>especially for people that don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific background that don't have</v>

47
00:01:57.271 --> 00:02:00.210
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean because it takes a lot of time to</v>

48
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 1>sit there and read through all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific ses and figuring out what's</v>

49
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:05.070
<v Speaker 1>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the complex interactions,</v>

50
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I barely have time to do that and it's</v>

51
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>like I do this every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I do research every day and on top</v>

52
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:13.470
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my spare time I do and it's still</v>

53
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.170
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming and I still can only get so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much done.</v>

54
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Didn't you have like plans on being some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a marine biologist or something?</v>

55
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 2>At some point?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell people that story because this is</v>

56
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:25.950
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On twitter I found this rock,</v>

57
00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:29.670
<v Speaker 2>my daughter found this rock on the beach</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Santa Barbara and had all these holes</v>

58
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 2>in it and we're trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck it was was an asteroid or</v>

59
00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put on twitter,</v>

60
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:36.630
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's this rock Joe fucking Perry is</v>

61
00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:40.200
<v Speaker 2>the first guy to answer me on twitter</v>
<v Speaker 2>and tells me it's a see stone.</v>

62
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:43.980
<v Speaker 2>Like these animals had like burrowed</v>
<v Speaker 2>into this stone and created a little</v>

63
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:48.590
<v Speaker 2>homes really well</v>
<v Speaker 2>told me.</v>

64
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.170
<v Speaker 2>Well anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

65
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 2>I love the ocean and it captured me from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the very beginning.</v>

66
00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:59.723
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>

67
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 2>I love</v>

68
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Jacques Cousteau and watching those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those specials and I got to see,</v>

69
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.740
<v Speaker 1>seems speak a couple of times in Boston</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just was,</v>

70
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I wanted to be.</v>

71
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I W I went to woods hole and you know,</v>

72
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.350
<v Speaker 1>visited there and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

73
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

74
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 1>and I thought that's what I wanted to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>was be a marine biologist and uh,</v>

75
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the whole learning disability thing,</v>

76
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they didn't know what to call it</v>

77
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:31.150
<v Speaker 1>back then except the discipline thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

78
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't studying hard enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

79
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to get good grades.</v>

80
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 1>They studied as hard as I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

81
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:38.620
<v Speaker 1>it looked at the page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read it,</v>

82
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>nothing's stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this lexicon couldn't get grades.</v>

83
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Now it's like a Adhd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they call it down.</v>

84
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

85
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 1>and that's where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

86
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 1>they have different ways to teach kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>now and it doesn't involve,</v>

87
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like taking some pills.</v>

88
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's just different ways of</v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching that,</v>

89
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 1>that work and they just didn't have it</v>
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>

90
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.930
<v Speaker 1>What would you say to one though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like say if someone came along like some</v>

91
00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:05.190
<v Speaker 1>15 year old kid says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

92
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge UFC fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to fight in MMA.</v>

93
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how should I get started?</v>

94
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.240
<v Speaker 1>I would have him pick one discipline to</v>
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>

95
00:04:12.241 --> 00:04:14.340
<v Speaker 1>If you're 15 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go wrestle.</v>

96
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.590
<v Speaker 1>If he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are more drawn to boxing or</v>

97
00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:19.110
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing and then go do that along the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

98
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Play and experiment a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But athlete development is changing now.</v>

99
00:04:23.341 --> 00:04:26.310
<v Speaker 1>There's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this trend for when kids are as young as</v>

100
00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:28.280
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six years old that there's these an</v>

101
00:04:28.281 --> 00:04:31.170
<v Speaker 1>intensive training program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had larger cities where there's good</v>

102
00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:33.870
<v Speaker 1>resource,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good coaching and good facilities.</v>

103
00:04:33.871 --> 00:04:37.380
<v Speaker 1>They take these kids from an early age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they train them football or</v>

104
00:04:37.381 --> 00:04:40.500
<v Speaker 1>basketball or hockey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this with the intent of</v>

105
00:04:40.501 --> 00:04:41.850
<v Speaker 1>development professional athletes.</v>

106
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.840
<v Speaker 1>This approaches almost producing zero</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional athletes.</v>

107
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.350
<v Speaker 1>The ones who are successful are the ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>who played three or four sports growing</v>

108
00:04:49.351 --> 00:04:53.640
<v Speaker 1>up and then they get to a certain age</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they start narrowing in and</v>

109
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.310
<v Speaker 1>kind of defining the best way to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they going to do?</v>

110
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.350
<v Speaker 1>The Australians did it before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympics in 2000 they started to take it</v>

111
00:05:00.351 --> 00:05:02.280
<v Speaker 1>a whole bunch of metrics on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes finding,</v>

112
00:05:02.281 --> 00:05:03.900
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not good enough to win a metal</v>

113
00:05:03.901 --> 00:05:05.580
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you thought about this,</v>

114
00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:06.960
<v Speaker 1>try this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a result,</v>

115
00:05:06.961 --> 00:05:09.810
<v Speaker 1>the Ozzies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've won national governing body for</v>

116
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for their Olympic sports development as</v>

117
00:05:12.631 --> 00:05:14.670
<v Speaker 1>their assault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did 10 times per capita.</v>

118
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.870
<v Speaker 1>The man of metals at the u s did in</v>
<v Speaker 1>2012,</v>

119
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

120
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.150
<v Speaker 1>in the UK they did the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took it a little bit further as</v>

121
00:05:24.151 --> 00:05:28.320
<v Speaker 1>example of one woman who was good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she was some type of distance</v>

122
00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:29.190
<v Speaker 1>runner or something.</v>

123
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.320
<v Speaker 1>They'd all sorts of measurements like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

124
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.070
<v Speaker 1>the wrist to elbow measurement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is more technical than than I</v>

125
00:05:35.071 --> 00:05:36.170
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they found,</v>

126
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.920
<v Speaker 1>she had the certain measurement in here</v>
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

127
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:39.330
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to win a medal in this.</v>

128
00:05:39.331 --> 00:05:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever considered rowing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

129
00:05:40.981 --> 00:05:42.840
<v Speaker 1>I've never done road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three years later,</v>

130
00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:44.610
<v Speaker 1>she was an Olympic champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watts.</v>

131
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could be an Olympic rowing champion</v>

132
00:05:46.801 --> 00:05:48.660
<v Speaker 1>in three years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but think about if you are already a</v>

133
00:05:48.661 --> 00:05:52.470
<v Speaker 1>well trained athlete for something else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it involved that type of cardiovascular</v>

134
00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:55.980
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this specific biomechanics that</v>

135
00:05:55.981 --> 00:05:57.920
<v Speaker 1>fits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you know those biomechanics,</v>

136
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.870
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what to look for in an athlete,</v>

137
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 1>you can steer them in this direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The UK did great with metal count.</v>

138
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.120
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
