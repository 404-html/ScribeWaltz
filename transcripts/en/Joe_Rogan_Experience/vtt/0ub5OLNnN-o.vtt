<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by Katie Bowman.</v>

4
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.470
<v Speaker 3>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>move your DNA.</v>

5
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.140
<v Speaker 3>You could find her on twitter aligned </v>
<v Speaker 3>and.</v>

6
00:00:33.141 --> 00:00:36.650
<v Speaker 3>Well she's friends with Rob Wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she must be cool.</v>

7
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.030
<v Speaker 3>And you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's up?</v>

8
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.170
<v Speaker 3>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing well.</v>

9
00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:39.950
<v Speaker 3>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

10
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.960
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to talk to you too much </v>
<v Speaker 3>before the show because we were talking </v>

11
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.141
<v Speaker 3>about something that I'm very interested</v>
<v Speaker 3>in about how you live in Washington </v>

12
00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:49.010
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You found some clever area where it's in</v>

13
00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:53.180
<v Speaker 3>Washington but it's not rainy every day </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you actually get sun.</v>

14
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.800
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How'd you do that?</v>

15
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

16
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.690
<v Speaker 2>I followed my family that someone else </v>
<v Speaker 2>found that magic and like how it always </v>

17
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.130
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I decided to go up there too.</v>

18
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.730
<v Speaker 3>And it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see like Vancouver and Vancouver</v>

19
00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:10.010
<v Speaker 3>island right from where you're at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 3>I could row a boat to Canada if I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

21
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.690
<v Speaker 3>If the shit hit the fan shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit the fan and I got my out.</v>

22
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.250
<v Speaker 3>Well that's what you started talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

23
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 3>You started talking about like living </v>
<v Speaker 3>off the wild and,</v>

24
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 3>and that's something that you're really </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned with,</v>

25
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:23.850
<v Speaker 3>like are you a prepper?</v>

26
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

27
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really concerned with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it Kinda goes hand in hand with what</v>

28
00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:35.091
<v Speaker 2>I teach about natural movements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm trying to put back these </v>

29
00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:37.920
<v Speaker 2>isolated pieces of how you eat and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>you move and how you think and where you</v>

30
00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:41.130
<v Speaker 2>spend your time and even where you spend</v>
<v Speaker 2>your money of going.</v>

31
00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we all just kind of go spend a little</v>

32
00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 2>bit more time out in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in nature.</v>

33
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean more than the park.</v>

34
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:49.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really mean wild.</v>

35
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.380
<v Speaker 2>You can see how it's been done for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>long period of time.</v>

36
00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:57.381
<v Speaker 2>So trying to figure out how to get more </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement goes naturally with trying to </v>

37
00:01:57.381 --> 00:01:59.510
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to acquire your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>foods.</v>

38
00:01:59.511 --> 00:02:02.580
<v Speaker 2>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm a parent of two little kids.</v>

39
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:07.581
<v Speaker 2>I have a limited amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what if our food acquisition is our </v>

40
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:09.150
<v Speaker 2>movement is our teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our kids is our family,</v>

41
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:14.151
<v Speaker 2>time is everything and it's the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunk of time and we're just out there in</v>

42
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:16.590
<v Speaker 2>the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

43
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.500
<v Speaker 3>Then you're in an area that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly like dense with wilderness,</v>

44
00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:26.501
<v Speaker 3>with trees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with animals and that whole area of the </v>

45
00:02:26.501 --> 00:02:26.501
<v Speaker 3>Pacific northwest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a.</v>

46
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.190
<v Speaker 3>When you were talking about how you come</v>
<v Speaker 3>to California and everything's so dry,</v>

47
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.610
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like where's the life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you go up there,</v>

48
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.830
<v Speaker 3>there's so much life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>

49
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.360
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went up there with my friend Duncan.</v>

50
00:02:38.361 --> 00:02:43.361
<v Speaker 3>We were hunting for bigfoot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was for a TV show and we went wandering </v>

51
00:02:43.361 --> 00:02:44.750
<v Speaker 3>through the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing,</v>

52
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.550
<v Speaker 3>the soaps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my computer isn't working.</v>

53
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.820
<v Speaker 3>The sound wasn't working up until then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got an issue with stream.</v>

54
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.600
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a totally new setup.</v>

55
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.380
<v Speaker 3>So we're an hd now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you look lovely in hd.</v>

56
00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.260
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were,</v>

57
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:00.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

58
00:03:00.381 --> 00:03:05.381
<v Speaker 3>we just got this new computer and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole jazz and we would maybe we should </v>

59
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 3>just run the show for like a minute </v>
<v Speaker 3>before we go live.</v>

60
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 3>That's what we'll do next time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

61
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we went up there,</v>

62
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 3>like when you're wandering around </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the forest up there,</v>

63
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 3>the thing that is so shocking is how </v>
<v Speaker 3>many animals there are and how much life</v>

64
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:23.551
<v Speaker 3>there as you see elk crap everywhere and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these birds and rodents and just so </v>

65
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so many,</v>

66
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 3>so much variety of life up there</v>

67
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.910
<v Speaker 2>and that's the big stuff you can see </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath every footprint.</v>

68
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.420
<v Speaker 2>There's like one or 200 organisms living</v>
<v Speaker 2>in every foot footprint that you take </v>

69
00:03:35.971 --> 00:03:37.770
<v Speaker 2>there because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so deep.</v>

70
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.480
<v Speaker 2>It's just dense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dense is,</v>

71
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.560
<v Speaker 2>it's the densest place on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is dense of,</v>

72
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.830
<v Speaker 2>of plant and animal stuffs.</v>

73
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you don't have to worry about </v>

74
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.170
<v Speaker 3>drought up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not this millennia.</v>

75
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not like we do here in California that </v>

76
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.461
<v Speaker 3>we need 11 trillion gallons of water </v>
<v Speaker 3>just to balance out what's been lost </v>

77
00:03:59.461 --> 00:03:59.461
<v Speaker 3>over the last three years.</v>

78
00:03:59.461 --> 00:04:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even more,</v>

79
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.290
<v Speaker 2>even even more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess alarming to me is less than the </v>

80
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.470
<v Speaker 2>total water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the amount of organization amongst </v>

81
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.850
<v Speaker 2>people it takes to get it here like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

82
00:04:10.851 --> 00:04:11.510
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

83
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 2>that's always what I was worried about </v>
<v Speaker 2>failing here.</v>

84
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the water supply,</v>

85
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.650
<v Speaker 2>the food supply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the infrastructure,</v>

86
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.290
<v Speaker 2>the infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the delivery system,</v>

87
00:04:21.291 --> 00:04:23.330
<v Speaker 2>because none of it is actually here </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

88
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.080
<v Speaker 2>like I'm just thinking of something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a power outage where so much of your </v>

89
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.801
<v Speaker 2>water is dependent on it being cleaned </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of that is depends on energy </v>

90
00:04:32.991 --> 00:04:35.360
<v Speaker 2>that requires a bunch of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my,</v>

91
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.410
<v Speaker 2>my in laws who live here in California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their house has been without power for </v>

92
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.640
<v Speaker 2>two weeks and they live in an area north</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Orange County and they had to bring a</v>

93
00:04:43.641 --> 00:04:46.040
<v Speaker 2>generator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put a generator into a neighborhood</v>

94
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.030
<v Speaker 2>because they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

95
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.530
<v Speaker 2>it's got to dig for it and frankly we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have the manpower right now.</v>

96
00:04:51.531 --> 00:04:53.270
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I started hearing stuff like that,</v>

97
00:04:53.271 --> 00:04:55.850
<v Speaker 2>that's when I flee to the Pacific </v>
<v Speaker 2>northwest</v>

98
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.450
<v Speaker 3>so that there's an issue with their </v>
<v Speaker 3>lines.</v>

99
00:04:58.451 --> 00:05:03.451
<v Speaker 3>The power lines are down or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that and so they have to dig for </v>

100
00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 3>the lines to put them back up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to live in like the camping</v>

101
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.320
<v Speaker 2>for two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>camping in a very affluent area in </v>

102
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.410
<v Speaker 2>Orange County.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is like,</v>

103
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a nice neighborhood,</v>

104
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.780
<v Speaker 2>really nice neighborhood now where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>live,</v>

105
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.410
<v Speaker 2>do you have neighbors?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we do want me to have two and a half</v>

106
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.690
<v Speaker 2>acres and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are,</v>

107
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.330
<v Speaker 2>there are some neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

108
00:05:24.331 --> 00:05:27.930
<v Speaker 2>but it's not um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within the whole town,</v>

109
00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:31.530
<v Speaker 2>the whole town's pretty small and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can get to a place to see nobody,</v>

110
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within 10 minutes,</v>

111
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:35.520
<v Speaker 2>which I like.</v>

112
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is nice if you want to get to </v>

113
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.731
<v Speaker 3>nobody in 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I find that like when you're in </v>

114
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 3>small towns and small areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real issue is finding a cool small </v>

115
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.160
<v Speaker 3>town with a good sensibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nice,</v>

116
00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:52.190
<v Speaker 3>intelligent small town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you can find some small towns,</v>

117
00:05:52.191 --> 00:05:55.760
<v Speaker 3>like if you drive from southern </v>
<v Speaker 3>California up to northern California,</v>

118
00:05:55.761 --> 00:06:00.761
<v Speaker 3>you can drive through some spots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have these giant Mitt Romney signs </v>

119
00:06:00.761 --> 00:06:04.481
<v Speaker 3>that are still up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's the weird religious signs </v>

120
00:06:04.481 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 3>and these strange really sketchy </v>
<v Speaker 3>communities.</v>

121
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh boy,</v>

122
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:10.130
<v Speaker 3>you got a pretty view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but fuck these neighbors.</v>

123
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a retirement community,</v>

124
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are where I am.</v>

125
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 2>It's a retirement community because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a,</v>

126
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:17.890
<v Speaker 2>it used to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

127
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.490
<v Speaker 2>a logging town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

128
00:06:20.491 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 2>it's got this waterway there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's next to some ports.</v>

129
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:25.610
<v Speaker 2>And so they've been moving with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>and milling it up and there's some paper</v>

130
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:28.490
<v Speaker 2>mills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of that business has shut down</v>

131
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 2>as people are buying stuff from </v>
<v Speaker 2>overseas.</v>

132
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:35.741
<v Speaker 2>And then of course as the wood is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>being able to be replenished as fast as </v>

133
00:06:35.741 --> 00:06:39.891
<v Speaker 2>they'd been taking it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think in sunset magazine somebody </v>

134
00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:44.801
<v Speaker 2>wrote an article about this town that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could buy a few acres and,</v>

135
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 2>and that it wasn't this what they call a</v>
<v Speaker 2>rain shadow.</v>

136
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:51.530
<v Speaker 2>So it's in the banana belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sunny almost every single day.</v>

137
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.710
<v Speaker 2>Totally different than any other place </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Oregon or Washington.</v>

138
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.050
<v Speaker 2>And you could buy an acre for it long </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

139
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.780
<v Speaker 2>It was like $60,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>or $70,000.</v>

140
00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:02.100
<v Speaker 2>So a whole bunch of people went out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

141
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.710
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no work or anything,</v>

142
00:07:03.711 --> 00:07:07.070
<v Speaker 2>but they bought their homes and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>built them up,</v>

143
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.920
<v Speaker 2>but they're all kind of dying now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people,</v>

144
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.050
<v Speaker 2>the people who originally were there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

145
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:17.620
<v Speaker 2>so it's not that ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small kind of funky ideal town yet.</v>

146
00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:20.780
<v Speaker 2>But I decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I can make that happen.</v>

147
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.850
<v Speaker 2>You were going to make sure I can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

148
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Like people in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really about waiting around for </v>

149
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:28.130
<v Speaker 2>the ideal to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just build it from the ground up.</v>

150
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.110
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

151
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.900
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

152
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:31.480
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

153
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:36.570
<v Speaker 3>this area that you're at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you take your kids out fishing and </v>

154
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:37.240
<v Speaker 3>take them out gathering food and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>that jazz?</v>

155
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's huge.</v>

156
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:43.330
<v Speaker 2>A huge reservation land where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the salmon is unreal.</v>

157
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.210
<v Speaker 2>I live on the dungeness river,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so all the crap,</v>

158
00:07:46.211 --> 00:07:48.730
<v Speaker 2>like all the crab that you met here from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dungeness,</v>

159
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.040
<v Speaker 2>that's where it comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

160
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:56.190
<v Speaker 2>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first nation peoples that lived </v>

161
00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:56.190
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the food was so abundant,</v>

162
00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.190
<v Speaker 2>like that's all the things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

163
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:03.090
<v Speaker 2>totem poles and big dugout canoes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that came about because they </v>

164
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.830
<v Speaker 2>didn't have to really worry about food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like listless of elk today.</v>

165
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.250
<v Speaker 2>Let's just sit here until one walks by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait till Baird's walks by,</v>

166
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the berries and the fruit and the wild </v>

167
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.550
<v Speaker 2>Greens and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then again the fish you could,</v>

168
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on the time of year,</v>

169
00:08:17.141 --> 00:08:19.820
<v Speaker 2>just grab one out of the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

170
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.700
<v Speaker 2>if they're sponsors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not hard to eat there.</v>

171
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:22.990
<v Speaker 2>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a great place.</v>

172
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:28.170
<v Speaker 3>There's so many elk up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took a photograph of an elk standing </v>

173
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:28.170
<v Speaker 3>in front of a no hunting signs</v>

174
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:29.300
<v Speaker 2>close</v>

175
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.290
<v Speaker 3>because it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

176
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.730
<v Speaker 3>right when we were driving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these elk were just wandering across the</v>

177
00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:37.400
<v Speaker 3>road and they were just standing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of this no hunting.</v>

178
00:08:37.401 --> 00:08:38.720
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is ridiculous.</v>

179
00:08:38.721 --> 00:08:40.690
<v Speaker 3>That was the first elk I'd ever seen in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the wild to.</v>

180
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:42.830
<v Speaker 3>Those things are huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're huge.</v>

181
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:44.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you ever hit one with your car,</v>

182
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.630
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

183
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:49.690
<v Speaker 2>have not come close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been waiting waiting for that to </v>

184
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:49.690
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't seem.</v>

185
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.441
<v Speaker 2>That bright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Light seems smarter than a lot of </v>

186
00:08:53.441 --> 00:08:53.441
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

187
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that shows the area that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>living with.</v>

188
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.770
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're cautious.</v>

189
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.900
<v Speaker 2>They're fleeting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a little a herd of them that </v>

190
00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:05.580
<v Speaker 2>lives in our town there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that mascot of this little town,</v>

191
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:10.581
<v Speaker 2>and so there's a hurt and they've got </v>
<v Speaker 2>collars around their neck and we've got </v>

192
00:09:10.581 --> 00:09:13.920
<v Speaker 2>elk flashing lights so you can their </v>
<v Speaker 2>colors because they just kind of.</v>

193
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.950
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they are dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they just kind of stumbled across </v>

194
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.081
<v Speaker 2>the freeway every now and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they flash up when they're close to </v>

195
00:09:21.081 --> 00:09:21.930
<v Speaker 2>the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one on either side is they're moving</v>

196
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:26.931
<v Speaker 2>back and forth from the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the gps collar collar that that the </v>

197
00:09:26.931 --> 00:09:28.590
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the local government is fitted them with</v>

198
00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:33.591
<v Speaker 2>so that they can kind of track where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be in light the sign </v>

199
00:09:33.591 --> 00:09:36.821
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the color comes close to these </v>

200
00:09:36.821 --> 00:09:36.821
<v Speaker 2>signs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

201
00:09:36.821 --> 00:09:37.890
<v Speaker 2>that's where the elk are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can sometimes look up and see the</v>

202
00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:40.710
<v Speaker 2>whole herd sitting in the past year or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

203
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.120
<v Speaker 2>maybe walking across the freeway</v>

204
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:47.680
<v Speaker 3>seems weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I kind of liked the idea </v>

205
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:47.720
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

206
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:53.760
<v Speaker 3>they know where they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to put a collar on him and be able </v>

207
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:53.760
<v Speaker 3>to track them and seems like that's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>wild anymore.</v>

208
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.190
<v Speaker 3>Then you just roaming pet.</v>

209
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

210
00:09:54.821 --> 00:09:58.480
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it will their mascots wildish </v>
<v Speaker 2>roaming mascots.</v>

211
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Wildish wildish eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

212
00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.420
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean by whom?</v>

213
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.890
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hunting laws.</v>

214
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.450
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

215
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if all of them are colored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe just a couple of the males</v>

216
00:10:09.671 --> 00:10:11.560
<v Speaker 2>are so then no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be allowed.</v>

217
00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Kenny them really can't shoot them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

218
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.590
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not really like hunting area.</v>

219
00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.670
<v Speaker 2>They're like in these kind of like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods.</v>

220
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're totally.</v>

221
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.020
<v Speaker 3>You'd be amazed at some areas that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can hunt in there.</v>

222
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:30.030
<v Speaker 3>Like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an area called Evergreen </v>

223
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.170
<v Speaker 3>Colorado and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the issues that they have is the </v>

224
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:34.530
<v Speaker 3>local laws allow you to essentially hunt</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your backyard.</v>

225
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.620
<v Speaker 3>If you have more than x amount of land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not much,</v>

226
00:10:37.621 --> 00:10:39.270
<v Speaker 3>it's like two acres or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

227
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.710
<v Speaker 3>I might be butchering this law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I remember there was some sort of a,</v>

228
00:10:43.711 --> 00:10:48.711
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an issue online when people debating it </v>

229
00:10:48.711 --> 00:10:48.711
<v Speaker 3>because people were firing off guns and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their backyard,</v>

230
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.900
<v Speaker 3>like shooting it elk and deer and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

231
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.160
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is kind of fucked up.</v>

232
00:10:53.161 --> 00:10:55.740
<v Speaker 3>Like we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not really in the woods man.</v>

233
00:10:55.741 --> 00:10:58.200
<v Speaker 3>Like my swing set is 100 yards to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

234
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.330
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

235
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.720
<v Speaker 3>but they have so many animals up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a rich abundance of animals </v>

236
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.700
<v Speaker 3>and the people that rely on them for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>large part of their food,</v>

237
00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:13.701
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moderate income or lower income </v>

238
00:11:13.701 --> 00:11:13.701
<v Speaker 3>families,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they get an elk,</v>

239
00:11:13.701 --> 00:11:14.430
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boy that is a year's worth of meat.</v>

240
00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:19.431
<v Speaker 3>Like you've got a 1300 pound animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get 400 plus pounds of </v>

241
00:11:19.801 --> 00:11:22.620
<v Speaker 3>meat from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 400 meals,</v>

242
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.140
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for a lot of people that is literally</v>

243
00:11:25.141 --> 00:11:30.141
<v Speaker 3>a year's worth of meat for your family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they'll just shoot that fucker right </v>

244
00:11:30.141 --> 00:11:30.900
<v Speaker 3>in their backyard.</v>

245
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:32.980
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

246
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.740
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's got a duck for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes and come on over.</v>

247
00:11:36.741 --> 00:11:41.741
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you a ham.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The salmon fishing up there must be </v>

248
00:11:41.741 --> 00:11:41.780
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

249
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>

250
00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.040
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when does the weirdest going down?</v>

251
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

252
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.900
<v Speaker 2>there was a dam up there for a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>long time,</v>

253
00:11:48.901 --> 00:11:50.840
<v Speaker 2>like 100 years that they've just taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

254
00:11:50.841 --> 00:11:55.841
<v Speaker 2>You can actually watch the </v>
<v Speaker 2>deconstruction of this dam a couple of </v>

255
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:55.841
<v Speaker 2>years</v>

256
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:57.880
<v Speaker 4>and we were walking around at the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 4>of what has been,</v>

257
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:00.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this damned up body of,</v>

258
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.960
<v Speaker 4>of water and some friends of ours were </v>
<v Speaker 4>biologist took us upstream because </v>

259
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.381
<v Speaker 4>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're doing a lot of salmon </v>

260
00:12:10.381 --> 00:12:10.381
<v Speaker 4>restoration,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

261
00:12:10.381 --> 00:12:13.530
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to get everything back to</v>
<v Speaker 4>what it was a couple of hundred years </v>

262
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.180
<v Speaker 4>ago because it's very different because </v>
<v Speaker 4>of this dam.</v>

263
00:12:16.181 --> 00:12:21.181
<v Speaker 4>And he is our friend Keith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just reached down and he picked up </v>

264
00:12:21.181 --> 00:12:22.990
<v Speaker 4>the salmon like right out of the water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this huge thing.</v>

265
00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:26.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean the thing was a foot and a half </v>
<v Speaker 4>more.</v>

266
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.650
<v Speaker 4>It was 15 pounds and he just picked it </v>
<v Speaker 4>right up and he was like,</v>

267
00:12:29.651 --> 00:12:31.360
<v Speaker 4>here's where the eggs are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he.</v>

268
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:36.420
<v Speaker 4>Then it turned out to be a male and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>just grabbed it and he just shot all of </v>

269
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.390
<v Speaker 4>the salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Salmon is also the river because they're</v>

270
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.330
<v Speaker 4>spawning and he just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just deals with salmon all day long.</v>

271
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.400
<v Speaker 4>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was opponent out of a weird,</v>

272
00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:43.510
<v Speaker 4>like a salmon?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're.</v>

273
00:12:43.511 --> 00:12:48.511
<v Speaker 4>Or was he pulling out of the river was </v>
<v Speaker 4>retarded because they're spawning so </v>

274
00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.480
<v Speaker 4>when they're spawning they just rub up </v>
<v Speaker 4>against anything.</v>

275
00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:53.960
<v Speaker 4>Well they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they're spawning,</v>

276
00:12:53.961 --> 00:12:55.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to get to kind of shallow</v>

277
00:12:55.361 --> 00:12:57.100
<v Speaker 4>water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of them are kind of,</v>

278
00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:02.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to make it up through the </v>

279
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:02.160
<v Speaker 4>river even as the river changes in terms</v>
<v Speaker 4>of volumes.</v>

280
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.260
<v Speaker 4>So where it's a little low,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just kind of walk up.</v>

281
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.720
<v Speaker 4>It kind of take themselves out of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>water.</v>

282
00:13:07.721 --> 00:13:08.650
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're amazing.</v>

283
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:15.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I've seen bears pulled them out </v>

284
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.731
<v Speaker 4>on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in deeper waters because they're </v>

285
00:13:17.731 --> 00:13:18.520
<v Speaker 4>jumping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These ones are actually on the ground,</v>

286
00:13:18.521 --> 00:13:21.460
<v Speaker 4>but they're just wiggling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

287
00:13:21.461 --> 00:13:23.860
<v Speaker 4>So he said the females will be way more </v>
<v Speaker 4>scratched up.</v>

288
00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:28.861
<v Speaker 4>You can tell during spawning season a </v>
<v Speaker 4>male versus a female because the female </v>

289
00:13:28.861 --> 00:13:31.830
<v Speaker 4>is just really desperately trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>her eggs to someplace.</v>

290
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.460
<v Speaker 4>And I guess the male just drop his load </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of wherever he's less intense about</v>

291
00:13:36.461 --> 00:13:38.440
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Goofy designed by nature,</v>

292
00:13:38.441 --> 00:13:39.580
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

293
00:13:39.581 --> 00:13:44.581
<v Speaker 4>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or just amazing like in what I find </v>

294
00:13:44.581 --> 00:13:47.350
<v Speaker 4>interesting is so salmon that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>raising in,</v>

295
00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.020
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever they call it,</v>

296
00:13:50.021 --> 00:13:51.570
<v Speaker 4>like in the fisheries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

297
00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:56.580
<v Speaker 4>in the hatcheries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the identify them because they remove </v>

298
00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:56.800
<v Speaker 4>what they will call like a vestibular </v>
<v Speaker 4>Finn.</v>

299
00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.800
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's called an adipose Finn.</v>

300
00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:04.480
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that they can recognize which ones </v>

301
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:04.480
<v Speaker 4>are wild in which ones are introduced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

302
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:09.480
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was talking to some biologists in </v>

303
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.720
<v Speaker 4>part of a lot of stuff that I do is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is kind of redefining what's actually </v>

304
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.750
<v Speaker 4>this digital era and what's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't know what it is,</v>

305
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.780
<v Speaker 4>so it must not be necessary anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

306
00:14:16.781 --> 00:14:21.781
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting because he was </v>

307
00:14:21.781 --> 00:14:22.090
<v Speaker 4>explaining it's kind of like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>appendix of the fish.</v>

308
00:14:22.091 --> 00:14:23.500
<v Speaker 4>It's not really necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

309
00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:28.501
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it turns out that our appendix isn't </v>

310
00:14:28.501 --> 00:14:28.501
<v Speaker 4>really as digital as it was once </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought,</v>

311
00:14:28.501 --> 00:14:29.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a little bit more necessary.</v>

312
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.340
<v Speaker 4>And it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

313
00:14:30.341 --> 00:14:35.341
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has a role whether that role is </v>

314
00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:37.870
<v Speaker 4>challenged by modern living,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really more where,</v>

315
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.480
<v Speaker 4>what the issue is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it still is,</v>

316
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.900
<v Speaker 4>it still is harboring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember exactly what it is.</v>

317
00:14:43.901 --> 00:14:48.901
<v Speaker 4>It's harboring some sort of bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 4>depending on the exposure.</v>

318
00:14:50.351 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 4>You have two different foodstuffs and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll</v>

319
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.750
<v Speaker 2>have to look it up a little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

320
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:59.290
<v Speaker 2>But he said it's interesting that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>say that because they're wondering why </v>

321
00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:00.110
<v Speaker 2>these fish don't do really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really well.</v>

322
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:05.140
<v Speaker 2>So perhaps it's because they're removing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fin and as I did a little bit more </v>

323
00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:09.281
<v Speaker 2>research on that fin that Finn in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular deals with assisting swimming</v>

324
00:15:09.351 --> 00:15:11.930
<v Speaker 2>through very particular types of </v>
<v Speaker 2>turbulence.</v>

325
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.520
<v Speaker 2>And so it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

326
00:15:13.521 --> 00:15:16.160
<v Speaker 2>it's not something that you use 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of the time,</v>

327
00:15:16.161 --> 00:15:18.240
<v Speaker 2>but it's used over the lifetime of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>salmon.</v>

328
00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:22.310
<v Speaker 2>Just put like a tag on that thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of dragging it off.</v>

329
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Too much drag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

330
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:27.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

331
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.750
<v Speaker 2>there's so many problems to solve and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>little time,</v>

332
00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:34.950
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so many problems to solve when your </v>

333
00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:34.950
<v Speaker 5>people and you want to fuck with </v>
<v Speaker 5>animals,</v>

334
00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:38.270
<v Speaker 5>want to cut their fins off and put </v>
<v Speaker 5>collars on their elk in this area that </v>

335
00:15:38.351 --> 00:15:40.960
<v Speaker 5>you live in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sounds like ideally it sounds beautiful.</v>

336
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:45.990
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And does this have anything to do with </v>

337
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:49.801
<v Speaker 5>what you do for a living?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does it have anything to do with what </v>

338
00:15:49.801 --> 00:15:51.160
<v Speaker 5>you're all about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Movement and alignment and</v>

339
00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.480
<v Speaker 2>like I'm all about natural movement and </v>
<v Speaker 2>an alignment being a component of that,</v>

340
00:15:57.601 --> 00:16:02.601
<v Speaker 2>but I would say that the reason we moved</v>
<v Speaker 2>up there as we were just unable to </v>

341
00:16:02.601 --> 00:16:05.460
<v Speaker 2>execute our life the way with we wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

342
00:16:05.461 --> 00:16:06.250
<v Speaker 2>like there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

343
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:11.340
<v Speaker 2>there's a physical blockage to moving in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that we need to move and I was </v>

344
00:16:11.731 --> 00:16:16.731
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the only way to remove that </v>

345
00:16:16.731 --> 00:16:18.501
<v Speaker 2>blockage is to take ourselves away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the environment that's limiting this,</v>

346
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.340
<v Speaker 2>this way of moving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

347
00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.710
<v Speaker 2>which is larger than it sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>

348
00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:27.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure you get these seven exercises </v>

349
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:27.950
<v Speaker 2>into your workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

350
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.411
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very broad and it has to do with </v>

351
00:16:31.411 --> 00:16:34.280
<v Speaker 2>the loads that your body experiences and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that goes for light and noise and </v>

352
00:16:34.621 --> 00:16:38.400
<v Speaker 2>all the different ways your cells are </v>
<v Speaker 2>deformed by your habitat.</v>

353
00:16:38.401 --> 00:16:40.470
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about,</v>

354
00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:45.000
<v Speaker 2>when I talk about movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really like in the way that we move to</v>

355
00:16:45.001 --> 00:16:50.001
<v Speaker 2>be similar to animals that are in zoos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you ever go to a zoo and check </v>

356
00:16:50.701 --> 00:16:55.701
<v Speaker 2>out that kind of unfortunate thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see these animals and they have </v>

357
00:16:55.701 --> 00:16:55.701
<v Speaker 2>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

358
00:16:55.701 --> 00:16:55.860
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>

359
00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cages or habitats designed for them,</v>

360
00:16:59.891 --> 00:17:04.891
<v Speaker 2>but the way that they used them is </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty narrow and it goes for us as </v>

361
00:17:04.891 --> 00:17:04.891
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

362
00:17:04.891 --> 00:17:05.770
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why the move.</v>

363
00:17:05.771 --> 00:17:08.440
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted less people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more space,</v>

364
00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:11.710
<v Speaker 2>less rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less noise,</v>

365
00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:12.370
<v Speaker 2>more water.</v>

366
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:17.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when you say like we're being </v>

367
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.870
<v Speaker 5>deformed or like in what way?</v>

368
00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.660
<v Speaker 2>Well in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the analogy that I use,</v>

369
00:17:20.661 --> 00:17:25.661
<v Speaker 2>because I think it's easiest to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand is if you look at workers in </v>

370
00:17:25.661 --> 00:17:29.030
<v Speaker 2>a place like sea world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you seen their folded over fin?</v>

371
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.730
<v Speaker 2>That's the kind of defamation that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

372
00:17:31.731 --> 00:17:35.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about like um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are shaped really by the forces that</v>

373
00:17:35.841 --> 00:17:40.841
<v Speaker 2>you experience all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your mechanical environment is 100 </v>

374
00:17:40.841 --> 00:17:44.390
<v Speaker 2>percent of the time and so the resultant</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape of your body</v>

375
00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:50.760
<v Speaker 2>is based on this exposure in the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>way that the Orca was missing input,</v>

376
00:17:50.761 --> 00:17:55.560
<v Speaker 2>it was missing mechanical input and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was exposed to high levels of mechanical</v>

377
00:17:55.561 --> 00:17:59.460
<v Speaker 2>input that gets this result in shape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

378
00:17:59.461 --> 00:18:04.461
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the difference between what the Orca </v>

379
00:18:04.461 --> 00:18:04.461
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at an Orca,</v>

380
00:18:04.461 --> 00:18:07.731
<v Speaker 2>it's like clearly it's not supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be at seaworld and clearly that shaped </v>

381
00:18:07.731 --> 00:18:09.150
<v Speaker 2>doesn't seem conducive to swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

382
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:14.320
<v Speaker 2>at least in a straight line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we don't see that in ourselves very </v>

383
00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.411
<v Speaker 2>well though because we are the Orca in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tank and everyone else is in the </v>

384
00:18:18.411 --> 00:18:20.550
<v Speaker 2>tank with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's really hard to see how you would</v>

385
00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:25.551
<v Speaker 2>have been shaped and it's really hard to</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine what the resultant shape of us </v>

386
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:31.820
<v Speaker 2>would be culturally if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there were more examples of people </v>

387
00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.300
<v Speaker 2>who moved in drastically different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which there are not.</v>

388
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:38.800
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know posture is a big issue with </v>

389
00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.241
<v Speaker 5>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a big issue with anybody in all </v>

390
00:18:41.241 --> 00:18:41.241
<v Speaker 5>parts of the world that have to sit at </v>
<v Speaker 5>desks all the time.</v>

391
00:18:41.241 --> 00:18:46.221
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the expression sitting is the new </v>

392
00:18:46.221 --> 00:18:46.350
<v Speaker 5>smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've tried really hard in this place to</v>

393
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:51.590
<v Speaker 5>change that up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've got these desks or these chairs </v>

394
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.800
<v Speaker 5>from Ergo depot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are called Cup Pisco.</v>

395
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:57.140
<v Speaker 5>I had a couple different ones before I </v>
<v Speaker 5>started off with regular chairs like </v>

396
00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:57.690
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but by the end of the podcast,</v>

397
00:18:57.691 --> 00:19:01.370
<v Speaker 5>my back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had some back issues with Jujitsu.</v>

398
00:19:01.371 --> 00:19:06.371
<v Speaker 5>I had a bulging disc at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my cervical spine and that's all healed </v>

399
00:19:06.371 --> 00:19:10.911
<v Speaker 5>up now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if I sit in something like that and </v>

400
00:19:10.911 --> 00:19:12.780
<v Speaker 5>I kind of have that hunch thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>get from a chair by the end of the show,</v>

401
00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.390
<v Speaker 5>I'll just get stiff in my back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But with these things,</v>

402
00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:20.480
<v Speaker 5>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So something that forces you to sit </v>

403
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.021
<v Speaker 5>erect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you realize like how few of us actually </v>

404
00:19:24.021 --> 00:19:26.841
<v Speaker 5>do that and how many people are like </v>
<v Speaker 5>have that weird hunch spine thing going </v>

405
00:19:26.841 --> 00:19:30.681
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which constantly puts pressure on your </v>

406
00:19:30.681 --> 00:19:33.471
<v Speaker 5>spine and I never thought anything of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that until I started doing this fucking </v>

407
00:19:33.471 --> 00:19:35.250
<v Speaker 5>podcast and I'm like sitting down all </v>
<v Speaker 5>the time,</v>

408
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:36.180
<v Speaker 5>all day.</v>

409
00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:39.420
<v Speaker 5>And it just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it really puts into perspective how many</v>

410
00:19:39.421 --> 00:19:42.120
<v Speaker 5>people are doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Me for three hours a day.</v>

411
00:19:42.121 --> 00:19:43.020
<v Speaker 5>They're doing eight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nine,</v>

412
00:19:43.021 --> 00:19:46.230
<v Speaker 5>10 hours a day even more staring at </v>
<v Speaker 5>computers all day.</v>

413
00:19:46.231 --> 00:19:48.100
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's going blind early.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

414
00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:48.710
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm uh,</v>

415
00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.580
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my vision sucks.</v>

416
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.830
<v Speaker 5>It used to be really good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but now I need,</v>

417
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:58.040
<v Speaker 5>I need reading glasses to read stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's close up and I know it has </v>

418
00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.911
<v Speaker 5>something to do with age,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it definitely has something to do </v>

419
00:20:01.911 --> 00:20:01.911
<v Speaker 5>with staring at monitors too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just not good for you.</v>

420
00:20:01.911 --> 00:20:02.860
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the distance,</v>

421
00:20:02.861 --> 00:20:03.310
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

422
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.680
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to talk about casts,</v>

423
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:07.120
<v Speaker 2>casts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>casts.</v>

424
00:20:07.121 --> 00:20:09.520
<v Speaker 2>When you break your arm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are really easy to see.</v>

425
00:20:09.521 --> 00:20:11.950
<v Speaker 2>There's like a physical structure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't move your arm.</v>

426
00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:17.220
<v Speaker 2>It's really harder to see these </v>
<v Speaker 2>invisible casts so distance the distance</v>

427
00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:21.850
<v Speaker 2>of something from your eye is a cast </v>
<v Speaker 2>upon the Lens,</v>

428
00:20:21.851 --> 00:20:25.350
<v Speaker 2>so when you look at something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what allows you to focus on that is that</v>

429
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.860
<v Speaker 2>the distance that you're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

430
00:20:27.861 --> 00:20:29.410
<v Speaker 2>your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

431
00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:34.420
<v Speaker 2>your musculature of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will change the shape of your lens so </v>

432
00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.830
<v Speaker 2>that that distance is what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at.</v>

433
00:20:35.831 --> 00:20:40.831
<v Speaker 2>When you want to see something farther,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look up and you look at it and then </v>

434
00:20:40.831 --> 00:20:44.641
<v Speaker 2>these muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ciliary muscles in the eye will </v>

435
00:20:44.641 --> 00:20:46.420
<v Speaker 2>change the shape of the eye and allow </v>
<v Speaker 2>you to focus that to that distance.</v>

436
00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:51.990
<v Speaker 2>But humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>modern humans in the places where we </v>

437
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:55.600
<v Speaker 2>live very rarely look beyond 20 feet.</v>

438
00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're not looking at anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

439
00:20:57.851 --> 00:21:02.851
<v Speaker 2>so like you can say that it's the screen</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the screen is two feet away and </v>

440
00:21:02.851 --> 00:21:05.320
<v Speaker 2>there's certainly a much greater </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequency of screen use.</v>

441
00:21:05.321 --> 00:21:10.321
<v Speaker 2>Like by the time you look at your ipod </v>
<v Speaker 2>or your iphone and you're looking at </v>

442
00:21:10.321 --> 00:21:12.340
<v Speaker 2>your computer and doing whatever work </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's on that,</v>

443
00:21:12.341 --> 00:21:17.341
<v Speaker 2>that number has gone up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's always been high is that you </v>

444
00:21:17.341 --> 00:21:19.480
<v Speaker 2>don't see much beyond the walls of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

445
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:24.670
<v Speaker 2>So that's another reason you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to look very far indoors,</v>

446
00:21:24.671 --> 00:21:28.510
<v Speaker 2>does not allow you to look very far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so right now with that vision,</v>

447
00:21:28.511 --> 00:21:30.670
<v Speaker 2>with kind of understanding like why is </v>
<v Speaker 2>Myopia,</v>

448
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
<v Speaker 2>which is that near sightedness coming up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with such great frequency years to be </v>

449
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.030
<v Speaker 2>one kid in school with glasses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

450
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:42.660
<v Speaker 2>And now there are seven or eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got one third of the classroom who </v>

451
00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:46.951
<v Speaker 2>can't see at ages six and seven kids are</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting now to be put in glasses like </v>

452
00:21:46.951 --> 00:21:49.060
<v Speaker 2>in four and five years old because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been looking.</v>

453
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:51.010
<v Speaker 2>They don't even have outdoor playtime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

454
00:21:51.011 --> 00:21:56.011
<v Speaker 2>they're not even going outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they know that outdoor time is a </v>

455
00:21:58.421 --> 00:22:02.400
<v Speaker 2>factor in those and have less myopia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then they're trying to test it like,</v>

456
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.460
<v Speaker 2>is it the near work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

457
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:09.280
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a piece about this that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a difference between going outside.</v>

458
00:22:09.281 --> 00:22:10.540
<v Speaker 2>So they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it the vitamin D?</v>

459
00:22:10.541 --> 00:22:15.541
<v Speaker 2>Is it the light exposure?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they were able to figure out by </v>

460
00:22:15.541 --> 00:22:16.910
<v Speaker 2>isolation that it wasn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so then I.</v>

461
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:18.190
<v Speaker 2>my contribution is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

462
00:22:18.191 --> 00:22:23.191
<v Speaker 2>what about distance looking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That distance looking itself is a </v>

463
00:22:23.191 --> 00:22:24.280
<v Speaker 2>different variable in something that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't.</v>

464
00:22:24.281 --> 00:22:27.610
<v Speaker 2>It's not a load to the eye that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very experienced with.</v>

465
00:22:27.611 --> 00:22:31.390
<v Speaker 2>But if you had to again go out and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>your food and you were moving around,</v>

466
00:22:31.391 --> 00:22:33.670
<v Speaker 2>it's not just that you're outside more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

467
00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.310
<v Speaker 2>You need to be able to see things kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of far away.</v>

468
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.530
<v Speaker 2>If you've ever gone hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hunting is,</v>

469
00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.680
<v Speaker 2>especially if we're doing like spot and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stock type hunting,</v>

470
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:45.430
<v Speaker 2>being able to look at long distances and</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing and spotting animals,</v>

471
00:22:45.431 --> 00:22:47.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you make your way over there,</v>

472
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:52.440
<v Speaker 2>that's a skill to be able to look 30 or </v>
<v Speaker 2>40 or 60 feet to the top of a tree to </v>

473
00:22:52.991 --> 00:22:55.480
<v Speaker 2>kind of see what's up in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just a.</v>

474
00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.850
<v Speaker 2>it's a part of your workout that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>missing,</v>

475
00:22:57.851 --> 00:23:00.280
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not cross training your eyes with</v>

476
00:23:00.281 --> 00:23:05.281
<v Speaker 2>enough types of exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do two feet and you do however far </v>

477
00:23:05.281 --> 00:23:06.300
<v Speaker 2>your television is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then maybe the.</v>

478
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.670
<v Speaker 2>The bumper of the car in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're not distance lookers at all</v>

479
00:23:09.671 --> 00:23:10.090
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

480
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:13.060
<v Speaker 5>so have ophthalmologists and </v>
<v Speaker 5>optometrists have,</v>

481
00:23:13.061 --> 00:23:15.220
<v Speaker 5>they've sort of just accepted the fact </v>
<v Speaker 5>that people,</v>

482
00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:20.400
<v Speaker 5>their eyes are just going to go bad </v>
<v Speaker 5>because this is the environment we live </v>

483
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.101
<v Speaker 5>in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this is just an inevitable fact of </v>

484
00:23:23.101 --> 00:23:24.811
<v Speaker 5>aging.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And is that something that can be </v>

485
00:23:24.811 --> 00:23:24.811
<v Speaker 5>avoided by spending a lot of time </v>
<v Speaker 5>outdoors,</v>

486
00:23:24.811 --> 00:23:29.341
<v Speaker 5>looking at long distance stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at things that are 100 yards </v>

487
00:23:29.341 --> 00:23:29.970
<v Speaker 5>away,</v>
<v Speaker 5>500 yards away and focusing your,</v>

488
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:31.210
<v Speaker 5>your vision on those things?</v>

489
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:31.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I don't,</v>

490
00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they want you to accept </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

491
00:23:33.801 --> 00:23:35.840
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not an inevitable thing.</v>

492
00:23:35.841 --> 00:23:37.610
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're working on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature for it.</v>

493
00:23:37.611 --> 00:23:42.080
<v Speaker 2>So the actual researchers in eyes are </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to find like what it is,</v>

494
00:23:42.081 --> 00:23:45.620
<v Speaker 2>do we need more supplementation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're like,</v>

495
00:23:45.621 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 2>kids really</v>

496
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.790
<v Speaker 4>do need to be outside a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

497
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:51.710
<v Speaker 4>because the shape of the size of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>eye is changing.</v>

498
00:23:51.711 --> 00:23:56.711
<v Speaker 4>And so when the eye freezes or as cast </v>
<v Speaker 4>by something near and then your eyes </v>

499
00:23:56.981 --> 00:23:59.900
<v Speaker 4>start growing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the lens has to stay the same size,</v>

500
00:23:59.901 --> 00:24:02.540
<v Speaker 4>then you have this mismatch between the </v>
<v Speaker 4>size of your eye and the Lens.</v>

501
00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:07.541
<v Speaker 4>And so that's why this childhood myopia </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of starts moving with you into </v>

502
00:24:07.541 --> 00:24:10.280
<v Speaker 4>adulthood and you become an adult that </v>
<v Speaker 4>needs glasses.</v>

503
00:24:10.281 --> 00:24:11.540
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yes,</v>

504
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:16.541
<v Speaker 4>they are calling for that intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's a lot of I exercise </v>

505
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:18.560
<v Speaker 4>programs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

506
00:24:18.561 --> 00:24:21.590
<v Speaker 4>people trying to create some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>corrective.</v>

507
00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:26.650
<v Speaker 4>My recommendation is you got to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself near a window if you're an </v>

508
00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:26.650
<v Speaker 4>office worker and you have to just take </v>
<v Speaker 4>an eyebrow,</v>

509
00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.300
<v Speaker 4>you need to look as far away as possible</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to.</v>

510
00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.540
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you did a bunch of curls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bicep curls,</v>

511
00:24:32.541 --> 00:24:35.330
<v Speaker 4>and you never ever put your arm down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you did them all.</v>

512
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.000
<v Speaker 4>And then when you were done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you tied it up there.</v>

513
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:43.210
<v Speaker 4>You can imagine what the shape of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bicep would look like and the function </v>

514
00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:46.601
<v Speaker 4>of the elbow and the shoulder and how </v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually that bicep would not just </v>

515
00:24:46.601 --> 00:24:48.830
<v Speaker 4>pull your lower arm up to your upper </v>
<v Speaker 4>arm,</v>

516
00:24:48.831 --> 00:24:51.680
<v Speaker 4>but would start to pull your shoulder in</v>
<v Speaker 4>towards your upper arm.</v>

517
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.210
<v Speaker 4>Same thing goes with the eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

518
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:57.260
<v Speaker 4>first the muscles that move the shape of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Lens,</v>

519
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.450
<v Speaker 4>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then the tighter they are,</v>

520
00:24:59.451 --> 00:25:03.080
<v Speaker 4>the more they begin to pull the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>structure of the eyeball down itself.</v>

521
00:25:03.081 --> 00:25:04.970
<v Speaker 4>And then you're starting to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

522
00:25:04.971 --> 00:25:06.500
<v Speaker 4>how does that affect the pressure of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>eye?</v>

523
00:25:06.501 --> 00:25:09.800
<v Speaker 4>And in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in so many things that occur in the body</v>

524
00:25:09.801 --> 00:25:11.570
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

525
00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.630
<v Speaker 4>mechanically sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

526
00:25:14.631 --> 00:25:19.631
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all your pressures are depend on all </v>

527
00:25:19.631 --> 00:25:21.311
<v Speaker 4>your pressures everywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you start to forming the shape </v>

528
00:25:21.311 --> 00:25:24.521
<v Speaker 4>of structures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it does start effecting those functions </v>

529
00:25:24.521 --> 00:25:26.510
<v Speaker 4>that are positioned dependent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is almost all of them</v>

530
00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.250
<v Speaker 5>sort of like when people were a wallet </v>
<v Speaker 5>in their pockets,</v>

531
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:32.790
<v Speaker 5>bulging discs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a really common thing with folks.</v>

532
00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:38.030
<v Speaker 5>Have you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't know if you have a wallet and </v>

533
00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:38.030
<v Speaker 5>you put it in your back pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 5>please stop doing it.</v>

534
00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:38.250
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I recently,</v>

535
00:25:38.251 --> 00:25:43.251
<v Speaker 5>I used to get mocked because I had a </v>
<v Speaker 5>wallet chain because I lost my wallet </v>

536
00:25:43.251 --> 00:25:44.490
<v Speaker 5>twice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

537
00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.890
<v Speaker 5>Relax people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Plus they look kind of sweet.</v>

538
00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.020
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got this wallet recently.</v>

539
00:25:49.021 --> 00:25:54.021
<v Speaker 5>It's a front pocket wallet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just keeps a few credit cards and my </v>

540
00:25:54.021 --> 00:25:57.441
<v Speaker 5>driver's license and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went and minimalist and ever since I </v>

541
00:25:57.441 --> 00:26:00.891
<v Speaker 5>did that I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm aware that I can just sit down and </v>

542
00:26:00.891 --> 00:26:01.500
<v Speaker 5>have to pull it because I would always </v>
<v Speaker 5>take my wallet out of my pocket and then</v>

543
00:26:01.501 --> 00:26:03.720
<v Speaker 5>sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is one of the reasons why I wanted</v>

544
00:26:03.721 --> 00:26:05.670
<v Speaker 5>it attached to a chain because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>absentminded,</v>

545
00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:08.430
<v Speaker 5>but people that have these big fat </v>
<v Speaker 5>wallet,</v>

546
00:26:08.431 --> 00:26:09.990
<v Speaker 5>everybody gives you a business card all.</v>

547
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:12.390
<v Speaker 5>Let me just stick that in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're sitting on a brick,</v>

548
00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're sitting on an encyclopedia,</v>

549
00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:19.730
<v Speaker 5>stuff that sucker into your pocket and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got this weird angle that you're </v>

550
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:22.941
<v Speaker 5>at all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're always sitting in a weird lump </v>

551
00:26:22.941 --> 00:26:24.990
<v Speaker 5>and soft tissue is very pliable and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's something that.</v>

552
00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:30.530
<v Speaker 5>It's also something that really </v>
<v Speaker 5>frustrated me about getting a back </v>

553
00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:31.110
<v Speaker 5>injury was how many people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

554
00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.400
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have to get surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was like,</v>

555
00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:33.510
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

556
00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.830
<v Speaker 5>Like there's no way to fix this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no way to stretch this out.</v>

557
00:26:37.831 --> 00:26:39.390
<v Speaker 5>There's no way to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's compressed,</v>

558
00:26:39.391 --> 00:26:40.260
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have suffered Capri.</v>

559
00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:45.320
<v Speaker 5>Is there a way to decompress it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I went to other people and </v>

560
00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:45.320
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

561
00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:45.320
<v Speaker 5>of course we do decompression therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

562
00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.200
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well what the fuck?</v>

563
00:26:46.201 --> 00:26:51.201
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how come this doctor is telling me that </v>

564
00:26:51.201 --> 00:26:51.201
<v Speaker 5>you got to cut my back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then there's.</v>

565
00:26:51.201 --> 00:26:52.200
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever heard of the reverse hyper</v>
<v Speaker 5>machine?</v>

566
00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:54.150
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Louie Simmons,</v>

567
00:26:54.151 --> 00:26:56.460
<v Speaker 5>this guy from west side barbell in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Columbus,</v>

568
00:26:56.461 --> 00:26:58.980
<v Speaker 5>Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 5>created this amazing machine that I have</v>

569
00:26:58.981 --> 00:27:01.350
<v Speaker 5>in the back now that I use almost every </v>
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>

570
00:27:01.351 --> 00:27:06.351
<v Speaker 5>It's fantastic because it offers </v>
<v Speaker 5>decompression and this incredible </v>

571
00:27:06.351 --> 00:27:09.441
<v Speaker 5>strengthening of the back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's this amazing machine that as you </v>

572
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:15.050
<v Speaker 5>you're lifting up your.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're flexing your back and is very </v>

573
00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:19.101
<v Speaker 5>unusual way that it's really hard to </v>
<v Speaker 5>work out any other way and then on the </v>

574
00:27:19.101 --> 00:27:21.930
<v Speaker 5>release it's actually actively </v>
<v Speaker 5>decompressing your spine,</v>

575
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.200
<v Speaker 5>so it's because of guys like him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Louis Siemens is powerlifter genius,</v>

576
00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:32.330
<v Speaker 5>sort of bio mechanic dude who figured </v>
<v Speaker 5>out he had an injury and they wanted a </v>

577
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:34.740
<v Speaker 5>fuses discs and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck that,</v>

578
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:39.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me let me figure out a way around </v>

579
00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:39.770
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he figured out a way and he fixed it</v>

580
00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:39.770
<v Speaker 5>and he fixed it through this.</v>

581
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:44.900
<v Speaker 5>Just using what he knows about exercise </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the mechanics of the body and coming</v>

582
00:27:45.961 --> 00:27:50.961
<v Speaker 5>up with some sort of machine that would </v>
<v Speaker 5>allow the decompression of that soft </v>

583
00:27:50.961 --> 00:27:55.290
<v Speaker 5>tissue and that's something that I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>we all have to be aware of when it comes</v>

584
00:27:55.291 --> 00:27:58.350
<v Speaker 5>to posture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Posture is a giant one with people.</v>

585
00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:03.330
<v Speaker 5>I had terrible posture like most of my </v>
<v Speaker 5>life until I started getting back issues</v>

586
00:28:03.331 --> 00:28:06.960
<v Speaker 5>and one of the things that I realized is</v>
<v Speaker 5>even though I was healthy and strong,</v>

587
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:11.160
<v Speaker 5>I was able to avoid a lot of pain that </v>
<v Speaker 5>was associated with that bad posture.</v>

588
00:28:11.161 --> 00:28:16.161
<v Speaker 5>The bad posture was still screwing me up</v>
<v Speaker 5>and like just being able to sit up </v>

589
00:28:16.161 --> 00:28:18.270
<v Speaker 5>straight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just feels odd when you do it,</v>

590
00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.250
<v Speaker 5>but if you do it and like you force </v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

591
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.280
<v Speaker 5>it's like an active exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You force yourself to do it,</v>

592
00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:28.320
<v Speaker 5>you want a slump because it's like you </v>
<v Speaker 5>feel like you're using less energy but </v>

593
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:28.680
<v Speaker 5>you're really screwing your body up when</v>
<v Speaker 5>you do it</v>

594
00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.510
<v Speaker 2>and you're using less energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

595
00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.900
<v Speaker 2>Which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fine in some cases.</v>

596
00:28:34.901 --> 00:28:36.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean using less energy is good in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>cases,</v>

597
00:28:36.881 --> 00:28:40.530
<v Speaker 2>but I think it has has less to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>like with good posture,</v>

598
00:28:40.531 --> 00:28:42.130
<v Speaker 2>but the thing with the thing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>posture,</v>

599
00:28:42.131 --> 00:28:47.131
<v Speaker 2>his posture is this modern construct </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has arisen in a culture that </v>

600
00:28:48.071 --> 00:28:49.390
<v Speaker 2>doesn't move at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

601
00:28:49.391 --> 00:28:53.200
<v Speaker 2>So it's really like what's the optimal </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to be still because that's the wrong</v>

602
00:28:53.201 --> 00:28:55.660
<v Speaker 2>question or asking kind of the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

603
00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:57.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the first question.</v>

604
00:28:57.011 --> 00:29:02.011
<v Speaker 2>The first question is to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there is nothing you can change about </v>

605
00:29:02.011 --> 00:29:02.300
<v Speaker 2>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can't move to a wonderful place</v>

606
00:29:02.301 --> 00:29:05.800
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultivate a wonderful city to live in,</v>

607
00:29:05.801 --> 00:29:07.990
<v Speaker 2>but right now if you feel stuck in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>job,</v>

608
00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:13.000
<v Speaker 2>the tendency is to make that environment</v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

609
00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:18.150
<v Speaker 2>but I always like to point out that </v>
<v Speaker 2>posture isn't something that you would </v>

610
00:29:18.731 --> 00:29:23.731
<v Speaker 2>be as concerned about if you were moving</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot more in general that the resting </v>

611
00:29:23.731 --> 00:29:25.660
<v Speaker 2>tensions of your body would be doing all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that you know,</v>

612
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:29.170
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to do in small blips on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on different machines,</v>

613
00:29:29.171 --> 00:29:30.310
<v Speaker 2>in posture classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

614
00:29:30.311 --> 00:29:33.130
<v Speaker 2>in posture books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just got to move more to.</v>

615
00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:38.920
<v Speaker 5>And also even standing up though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if you are moving,</v>

616
00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:44.160
<v Speaker 5>like there's a lot of people that move </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they of have that hunch for thing </v>

617
00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.371
<v Speaker 5>going on and even if you're out there </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing stuff like especially like when </v>

618
00:29:47.371 --> 00:29:50.911
<v Speaker 5>you're exercising you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you put a tremendous amount of pressure </v>

619
00:29:50.911 --> 00:29:54.451
<v Speaker 5>on your back and really weird ways if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't use proper posture like with </v>

620
00:29:54.451 --> 00:29:55.570
<v Speaker 5>squats and things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so super important.</v>

621
00:29:55.630 --> 00:30:00.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forum forum is huge during your workout </v>

622
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:01.000
<v Speaker 2>and all the other times too.</v>

623
00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and form for everything,</v>

624
00:30:03.051 --> 00:30:05.210
<v Speaker 5>not just for lifting weights for martial</v>
<v Speaker 5>arts,</v>

625
00:30:05.211 --> 00:30:06.380
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this gigantic,</v>

626
00:30:06.381 --> 00:30:07.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing things correctly.</v>

627
00:30:07.491 --> 00:30:12.491
<v Speaker 5>If you do things incorrectly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you put a lot of load on weird areas of </v>

628
00:30:12.491 --> 00:30:15.521
<v Speaker 5>your joints and your hips and your back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so many people want to be healthier.</v>

629
00:30:16.671 --> 00:30:21.671
<v Speaker 5>So many people want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They wanted to get out of this Rut </v>

630
00:30:21.671 --> 00:30:22.400
<v Speaker 5>they're in and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and get there.</v>

631
00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:27.670
<v Speaker 5>But it seems like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just a modern life that most people are </v>

632
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:33.130
<v Speaker 5>either found themselves in by </v>
<v Speaker 5>circumstance by lack of understanding,</v>

633
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:36.730
<v Speaker 5>but whatever it is you find yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

634
00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:41.800
<v Speaker 5>this way or this way of life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which it almost makes it </v>

635
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:45.500
<v Speaker 5>incomprehensibly difficult to like be </v>
<v Speaker 5>healthy,</v>

636
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:46.820
<v Speaker 5>to be fit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be,</v>

637
00:30:46.821 --> 00:30:51.590
<v Speaker 5>to have a body that functions correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're sitting in a desk all day,</v>

638
00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:56.920
<v Speaker 5>like what are the things that people </v>
<v Speaker 5>should be concentrating on if they find </v>

639
00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.160
<v Speaker 5>themselves stuck in a work environment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in a cubicle.</v>

640
00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.870
<v Speaker 5>Like is there a way to mitigate that?</v>

641
00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.670
<v Speaker 2>There is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

642
00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:06.680
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the things that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>known for most is that thinking,</v>

643
00:31:06.681 --> 00:31:08.660
<v Speaker 2>if you think about in terms of like your</v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise,</v>

644
00:31:08.661 --> 00:31:10.180
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people will try to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

645
00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.520
<v Speaker 2>healthy to them as what are you doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>for exercise?</v>

646
00:31:13.521 --> 00:31:15.160
<v Speaker 2>What are you eating for your diet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

647
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:20.350
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to maximize those two </v>

648
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:20.910
<v Speaker 2>categories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

649
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:25.990
<v Speaker 2>you've got all of this other time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>which you are getting your work done and</v>

650
00:31:26.511 --> 00:31:31.511
<v Speaker 2>you can make that healthier too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like we know you were talking about </v>

651
00:31:31.511 --> 00:31:32.150
<v Speaker 2>your wallet for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was thinking,</v>

652
00:31:32.151 --> 00:31:37.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put this big hunk under one hip and </v>

653
00:31:37.151 --> 00:31:39.431
<v Speaker 2>so you take it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well a lot of people put two big hunks </v>

654
00:31:39.431 --> 00:31:43.960
<v Speaker 2>of wallet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dish type stuff under their feet every </v>

655
00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:44.330
<v Speaker 2>single day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they call them shoes.</v>

656
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:45.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll put like a big,</v>

657
00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.310
<v Speaker 2>big wedge about high heels.</v>

658
00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about trainers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

659
00:31:49.791 --> 00:31:53.420
<v Speaker 2>like your athletic shoe could have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>inch and a quarter is standard,</v>

660
00:31:53.421 --> 00:31:56.000
<v Speaker 2>a man's dress shoes almost two full </v>
<v Speaker 2>inches.</v>

661
00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:59.570
<v Speaker 2>We'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not sin in spiky and Fashiony,</v>

662
00:31:59.571 --> 00:32:04.571
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that is the equivalent to the </v>

663
00:32:04.571 --> 00:32:05.030
<v Speaker 2>wallet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just because it's symmetrical.</v>

664
00:32:05.031 --> 00:32:05.750
<v Speaker 2>We think of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

665
00:32:05.751 --> 00:32:07.640
<v Speaker 2>it's symmetrical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the thing,</v>

666
00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:11.540
<v Speaker 2>your wallet under your hip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just that it's asymmetrical.</v>

667
00:32:11.541 --> 00:32:16.541
<v Speaker 2>If you had a wallet in each hip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either the problems of having something </v>

668
00:32:16.541 --> 00:32:17.390
<v Speaker 2>underneath under that soft tissue would </v>
<v Speaker 2>still be there.</v>

669
00:32:17.391 --> 00:32:19.940
<v Speaker 2>It would just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be more subtle.</v>

670
00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:22.460
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't have this big torque there </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

671
00:32:22.461 --> 00:32:24.260
<v Speaker 2>It would just be kind of continuous </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure,</v>

672
00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:29.650
<v Speaker 2>but people put stuff on their feet every</v>
<v Speaker 2>single day that affects every other </v>

673
00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:33.191
<v Speaker 2>joint north of their ankle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you compensate all day long </v>

674
00:32:33.191 --> 00:32:34.100
<v Speaker 2>your whole entire life you've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>compensating.</v>

675
00:32:34.101 --> 00:32:37.940
<v Speaker 2>And over time you lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You lose parts to your body.</v>

676
00:32:37.941 --> 00:32:40.300
<v Speaker 2>You lose little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The little contract</v>

677
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:45.460
<v Speaker 4>components that make up muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the sarcomeres that make up your </v>

678
00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:45.460
<v Speaker 4>muscle length.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those just go away.</v>

679
00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.430
<v Speaker 4>You cannibalize those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

680
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:52.450
<v Speaker 4>which means you lose range of motion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means even when you go to move </v>

681
00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:54.200
<v Speaker 4>your parts during this part of your life</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you've set aside to move,</v>

682
00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.380
<v Speaker 4>which is different than the rest of your</v>
<v Speaker 4>life that you've set aside to not move.</v>

683
00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.810
<v Speaker 4>You're moving less,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're moving less of you.</v>

684
00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:02.630
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's always a huge one.</v>

685
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:07.660
<v Speaker 4>Like what if I told you your whole body </v>
<v Speaker 4>would work better if you fix what you </v>

686
00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:10.691
<v Speaker 4>were putting on your feet everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just going to put shoes on any </v>

687
00:33:10.691 --> 00:33:10.850
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what does it matter what they are?</v>

688
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:16.510
<v Speaker 4>If you could put on a pair of shoes that</v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed your whole body to function in a</v>

689
00:33:16.791 --> 00:33:19.190
<v Speaker 4>different way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be the equivalent to saying,</v>

690
00:33:19.191 --> 00:33:21.560
<v Speaker 4>I got this new workout,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this new cross training piece.</v>

691
00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:26.540
<v Speaker 4>Your workout is stale,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not as strong as you should be,</v>

692
00:33:26.541 --> 00:33:29.240
<v Speaker 4>or that you'd like to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For the thing that you're doing that you</v>

693
00:33:29.241 --> 00:33:34.241
<v Speaker 4>can introduce whole new load spectrum to</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body just by changing your shoes </v>

694
00:33:34.241 --> 00:33:35.360
<v Speaker 4>would have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think about those?</v>

695
00:33:35.361 --> 00:33:36.580
<v Speaker 4>What are they called?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mbts?</v>

696
00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.050
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it was called?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The barefoot technology.</v>

697
00:33:39.051 --> 00:33:41.080
<v Speaker 4>The rocker bottom ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are the.</v>

698
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.860
<v Speaker 4>What's the deal with those?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those stupid.</v>

699
00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.290
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are a rocking chair for your feet,</v>

700
00:33:45.291 --> 00:33:50.291
<v Speaker 4>so if you want it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you ever sit down in a rocking </v>

701
00:33:50.291 --> 00:33:52.541
<v Speaker 4>chair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's called momentum and that's not </v>

702
00:33:52.541 --> 00:33:53.780
<v Speaker 4>something you want in your gait pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want your shoes to be throwing</v>

703
00:33:53.781 --> 00:33:56.630
<v Speaker 4>you forwards that you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>expend as much energy to do it,</v>

704
00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:03.180
<v Speaker 4>that you balance yourself constantly on </v>
<v Speaker 4>those things and in doing that you're </v>

705
00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:04.790
<v Speaker 4>using all those little muscle groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that all bs?</v>

706
00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:07.940
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's all BS.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just.</v>

707
00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:11.000
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Its mostly bs.</v>

708
00:34:11.001 --> 00:34:13.630
<v Speaker 4>Mbs isn't there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Almost called MTS mpt.</v>

709
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:18.770
<v Speaker 4>It's just this bigger like I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always think a lot larger than that.</v>

710
00:34:18.771 --> 00:34:21.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking about like there is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cellular environment,</v>

711
00:34:21.410 --> 00:34:26.410
<v Speaker 4>there is a nutritious movement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's the equivalent to nutritious </v>

712
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:32.050
<v Speaker 4>food is that there is a way to move that</v>
<v Speaker 4>as nutritious to your body and you're </v>

713
00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:35.360
<v Speaker 4>missing some huge nutrients so you </v>
<v Speaker 4>should wear flat shoes all the time.</v>

714
00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:39.350
<v Speaker 4>Flexible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>flexible.</v>

715
00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.350
<v Speaker 4>There's a little bit of a bottom to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

716
00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:43.910
<v Speaker 4>There's more on the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you grab him,</v>

717
00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:46.670
<v Speaker 4>if he grabbed them and bend them over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do they do?</v>

718
00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:52.190
<v Speaker 4>Like here's my shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>flip flops.</v>

719
00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.350
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

720
00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:58.420
<v Speaker 4>but also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but decidedly not flip flops because if </v>

721
00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:58.420
<v Speaker 4>you put,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's just flip flops then you have to</v>

722
00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:03.281
<v Speaker 4>grab to hold them and then you've got </v>
<v Speaker 4>all this tension and your foot and your </v>

723
00:35:03.281 --> 00:35:04.280
<v Speaker 4>gait patterns all messed up from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from natural,</v>

724
00:35:04.281 --> 00:35:09.281
<v Speaker 4>just to hold on the thing on your foot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's kind of like your,</v>

725
00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.810
<v Speaker 4>your movement is very reflexive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

726
00:35:11.811 --> 00:35:16.811
<v Speaker 4>you are an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a primate and in your movements </v>

727
00:35:16.811 --> 00:35:18.890
<v Speaker 4>should be much more reflective than it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>happening right now.</v>

728
00:35:18.891 --> 00:35:23.891
<v Speaker 4>And in one of the reasons that makes it </v>
<v Speaker 4>so difficult is because of all of these </v>

729
00:35:23.891 --> 00:35:24.000
<v Speaker 4>casts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

730
00:35:24.001 --> 00:35:29.001
<v Speaker 4>these things that we put on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fascinating that you refer to like </v>

731
00:35:29.001 --> 00:35:30.410
<v Speaker 4>a cast for your eyes because I never </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought about it that way,</v>

732
00:35:30.411 --> 00:35:31.490
<v Speaker 4>but as soon as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

733
00:35:31.491 --> 00:35:32.870
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that totally makes sense.</v>

734
00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:35.010
<v Speaker 4>Like your house is kind of a cast is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cast,</v>

735
00:35:35.011 --> 00:35:38.370
<v Speaker 4>the cast being in a work environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an office as a cast,</v>

736
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.590
<v Speaker 5>not looking at things for large </v>
<v Speaker 5>distances.</v>

737
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.670
<v Speaker 5>That is a cast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

738
00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.030
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the shoe thing I wear converse all stars</v>

739
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:50.031
<v Speaker 5>most of the time because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they're flat and they're really </v>

740
00:35:50.031 --> 00:35:50.031
<v Speaker 5>flexible and light.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are okay.</v>

741
00:35:50.031 --> 00:35:50.031
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those would be helpful.</v>

742
00:35:50.031 --> 00:35:53.590
<v Speaker 2>Can you spread your toes out wide but </v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's this whole other level.</v>

743
00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:59.080
<v Speaker 2>Why is that important?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's muscles in their 25 percent of </v>

744
00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.470
<v Speaker 2>the number in your muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In your body or from your ankle down.</v>

745
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:02.990
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not me.</v>

746
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:04.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might have more muscles.</v>

747
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Not Muscle mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muscle mass.</v>

748
00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:10.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm just talking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about those toe shoes?</v>

749
00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Toe Shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the toe shoes.</v>

750
00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:14.380
<v Speaker 2>You get a little bit more for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to,</v>

751
00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:18.250
<v Speaker 2>you have to transition pretty hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you've been wearing cast,</v>

752
00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:23.280
<v Speaker 2>like if you broke your arm you wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>cut it off and then start doing </v>

753
00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.970
<v Speaker 2>cartwheels and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do all my workouts barefoot?</v>

754
00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:26.310
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

755
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:31.400
<v Speaker 5>I do all my weightlifting barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All my martial arts stuff is off course </v>

756
00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:31.400
<v Speaker 5>barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

757
00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:35.910
<v Speaker 5>like sometimes I'll take pictures of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>gym workouts and like,</v>

758
00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.140
<v Speaker 5>what are you doing barefoot?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>

759
00:36:37.141 --> 00:36:38.610
<v Speaker 5>you crazy going to drop things on your </v>
<v Speaker 5>feet.</v>

760
00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:39.720
<v Speaker 5>I guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

761
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.570
<v Speaker 5>you drop things in your feet normally </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're fucked anyway.</v>

762
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:45.240
<v Speaker 5>If you're lifting 400 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have shoes on,</v>

763
00:36:45.241 --> 00:36:47.050
<v Speaker 5>you're still fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's gonna.</v>

764
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:49.440
<v Speaker 5>Smush your toes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just don't drop things on your feet.</v>

765
00:36:49.441 --> 00:36:54.441
<v Speaker 5>Dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How often do you drop things on your </v>

766
00:36:54.441 --> 00:36:54.441
<v Speaker 5>feet?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't drop things on my feet.</v>

767
00:36:54.441 --> 00:36:54.441
<v Speaker 5>I pay attention.</v>

768
00:36:54.441 --> 00:36:54.441
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>

769
00:36:54.441 --> 00:36:54.630
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

770
00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:58.480
<v Speaker 2>if you go barefoot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you learn how to pay a lot of attention.</v>

771
00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:59.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>little kids,</v>

772
00:36:59.371 --> 00:37:04.371
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My Kid's stomped on my feet all the </v>

773
00:37:04.371 --> 00:37:05.991
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm barefoot around the house and they </v>

774
00:37:05.991 --> 00:37:05.991
<v Speaker 5>love it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They think it's funny,</v>

775
00:37:05.991 --> 00:37:10.870
<v Speaker 5>but I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>While I'm teaching my six year old </v>

776
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:12.591
<v Speaker 5>daughter a teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kickboxing and so now she thinks it's </v>

777
00:37:12.591 --> 00:37:15.840
<v Speaker 5>funny to just run up on me and leg </v>
<v Speaker 5>kicked me and it's starting to get hard.</v>

778
00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:19.380
<v Speaker 5>Like she's six and she's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She knows how to whip her body into it.</v>

779
00:37:19.381 --> 00:37:24.381
<v Speaker 5>Now she's a little athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She knows how to turn your hips because </v>

780
00:37:24.381 --> 00:37:24.720
<v Speaker 5>I've taught her like how to really </v>
<v Speaker 5>generate force.</v>

781
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:29.870
<v Speaker 5>So the other day she came up to me and </v>
<v Speaker 5>she did this like perfect pivot and </v>

782
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:30.840
<v Speaker 5>whack and just dug one right into my </v>
<v Speaker 5>calf.</v>

783
00:37:30.841 --> 00:37:32.220
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

784
00:37:32.221 --> 00:37:34.560
<v Speaker 5>you little fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it was good.</v>

785
00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.350
<v Speaker 5>It was good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was proud of how it's pretty good.</v>

786
00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.830
<v Speaker 5>But I didn't see it coming.</v>

787
00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:38.730
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just,</v>

788
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:43.880
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well when there's six they feel like </v>

789
00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.951
<v Speaker 5>you're invulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they just tee off on you whenever </v>

790
00:37:45.951 --> 00:37:45.951
<v Speaker 5>they want,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

791
00:37:45.951 --> 00:37:49.790
<v Speaker 5>we can't let them know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean it doesn't really hurt yet </v>

792
00:37:49.790 --> 00:37:54.110
<v Speaker 5>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey you gotta we've got about four more </v>

793
00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:54.110
<v Speaker 5>years of that before we're going to have</v>
<v Speaker 5>an issue.</v>

794
00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:56.730
<v Speaker 5>When she gets to like 13,</v>
<v Speaker 5>14,</v>

795
00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:59.340
<v Speaker 5>you could really hurt somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So don't only do it to me.</v>

796
00:37:59.341 --> 00:38:04.341
<v Speaker 5>We have like rules in our house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're only allowed to hit daddy and you </v>

797
00:38:04.341 --> 00:38:07.190
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he can't hit each other but you could </v>

798
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.190
<v Speaker 5>hit daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so we,</v>

799
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:09.870
<v Speaker 5>we play just by.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just feel like the best way to teach </v>

800
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:10.830
<v Speaker 5>the martial arts is to show them the </v>
<v Speaker 5>techniques,</v>

801
00:38:10.831 --> 00:38:15.831
<v Speaker 5>but then actually have them hit a person</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you can hit punching bags and </v>

802
00:38:15.831 --> 00:38:19.491
<v Speaker 5>stuff all you want,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I want them to like specifically </v>

803
00:38:19.491 --> 00:38:19.800
<v Speaker 5>target areas like this is the area </v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to hit I.</v>

804
00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.300
<v Speaker 5>This is why you're supposed to hit this </v>
<v Speaker 5>area.</v>

805
00:38:21.301 --> 00:38:25.620
<v Speaker 5>So I let him hit me like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>barefoot stuff.</v>

806
00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:26.280
<v Speaker 5>Point is.</v>

807
00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:27.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of people don't.</v>

808
00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:30.620
<v Speaker 2>Don't do anything barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're doing,</v>

809
00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.120
<v Speaker 2>you know the bulk of your movement with </v>
<v Speaker 2>barefoot,</v>

810
00:38:32.121 --> 00:38:37.121
<v Speaker 2>that's great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could also do your podcast </v>

811
00:38:37.121 --> 00:38:37.121
<v Speaker 2>barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

812
00:38:37.121 --> 00:38:37.121
<v Speaker 2>Why would that help?</v>

813
00:38:37.121 --> 00:38:39.700
<v Speaker 5>Why does it help your workout?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I'm moving my feet around.</v>

814
00:38:39.701 --> 00:38:44.701
<v Speaker 5>I'm sitting here will move around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would suggest that you move around </v>

815
00:38:44.701 --> 00:38:46.180
<v Speaker 5>more to like wiggle my toes around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are weird.</v>

816
00:38:46.181 --> 00:38:49.000
<v Speaker 5>They're sitting around barefoot somehow </v>
<v Speaker 5>or another would with girls.</v>

817
00:38:49.001 --> 00:38:54.001
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't bother me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like if I'm sitting like Eddie </v>

818
00:38:54.001 --> 00:38:54.001
<v Speaker 5>Bravo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love Eddie.</v>

819
00:38:54.001 --> 00:38:55.930
<v Speaker 5>Bravo two dads is a good buddy of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That dude's always barefoot.</v>

820
00:38:55.931 --> 00:38:57.610
<v Speaker 5>It was playing with his feet and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

821
00:38:57.611 --> 00:38:58.240
<v Speaker 5>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

822
00:38:58.241 --> 00:39:02.390
<v Speaker 5>puts his feet up on tables in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>restaurant and just.</v>

823
00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:04.210
<v Speaker 5>He's always stretching.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's super.</v>

824
00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:06.190
<v Speaker 5>He's a Jujitsu master,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he was always like,</v>

825
00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.510
<v Speaker 5>got one foot here and one foot here is </v>
<v Speaker 5>always pushing his weight down,</v>

826
00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.470
<v Speaker 5>stretching himself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's always barefoot.</v>

827
00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:14.490
<v Speaker 5>That's why he's a master maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

828
00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.660
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was that the 10,000</v>

829
00:39:16.661 --> 00:39:18.020
<v Speaker 5>hours thing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

830
00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:21.400
<v Speaker 5>it's got a lot of years of choking </v>
<v Speaker 5>people and thinking about it too,</v>

831
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:24.640
<v Speaker 5>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's always barefoot like so.</v>

832
00:39:24.641 --> 00:39:26.800
<v Speaker 5>There's probably something to that and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he lifts weights,</v>

833
00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:30.130
<v Speaker 5>will converse all stars of the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't let you lift weights at a gym</v>

834
00:39:30.131 --> 00:39:31.540
<v Speaker 5>gym most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>barefoot,</v>

835
00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:37.410
<v Speaker 5>but those toe shoes didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wasn't really a class action lawsuit </v>

836
00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:37.410
<v Speaker 5>that said those toe shoes were bullshit.</v>

837
00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:41.620
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The class action lawsuit was that the </v>

838
00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.760
<v Speaker 2>woman who brought about the class action</v>
<v Speaker 2>said that the advertising imply that all</v>

839
00:39:43.761 --> 00:39:46.310
<v Speaker 2>you had to do was buy the shoes that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't.</v>

840
00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.670
<v Speaker 2>You didn't have to figure out how to use</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body differently,</v>

841
00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:54.500
<v Speaker 2>so it had nothing to do with how they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How they performed it was about their,</v>

842
00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:59.590
<v Speaker 2>their claim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the way she interpreted it was that </v>

843
00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:02.531
<v Speaker 2>she just had to put them on her feet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she would be healthier and have </v>

844
00:40:02.531 --> 00:40:02.980
<v Speaker 2>less injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marika,</v>

845
00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:04.390
<v Speaker 2>let's</v>

846
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:05.760
<v Speaker 5>mark.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

847
00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.460
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These class action lawsuits,</v>

848
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:10.960
<v Speaker 5>some of them are just so God damn goofy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You let go.</v>

849
00:40:10.961 --> 00:40:12.100
<v Speaker 5>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>

850
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.520
<v Speaker 5>You thought you could put shoes on and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you would become a super person.</v>

851
00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:16.990
<v Speaker 5>Might have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's true though,</v>

852
00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:22.890
<v Speaker 5>but that's the real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they do one day come up with </v>

853
00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:23.860
<v Speaker 5>something that you just put it on and </v>
<v Speaker 5>makes you a way better athlete.</v>

854
00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:26.290
<v Speaker 5>Like then what's the point of being?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

855
00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.110
<v Speaker 5>it's like steroid shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

856
00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.890
<v Speaker 5>like all of a sudden people are running </v>
<v Speaker 5>faster.</v>

857
00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:32.470
<v Speaker 5>She didn't that um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

858
00:40:32.471 --> 00:40:35.800
<v Speaker 5>the South African guy who shot his </v>
<v Speaker 5>girlfriend the,</v>

859
00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:38.650
<v Speaker 5>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guy with the blades.</v>

860
00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:40.810
<v Speaker 5>Pistorius.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

861
00:40:40.811 --> 00:40:42.850
<v Speaker 5>That guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those blades,</v>

862
00:40:42.851 --> 00:40:47.851
<v Speaker 5>like a lot of people feel like they can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can actually run faster with those </v>

863
00:40:47.851 --> 00:40:51.601
<v Speaker 5>things on because they offer some sort </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a spring that you could with just </v>

864
00:40:51.601 --> 00:40:51.750
<v Speaker 5>your regular feet.</v>

865
00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.510
<v Speaker 5>So they get to that with shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then we've got an issue.</v>

866
00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:58.570
<v Speaker 5>People,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you think people will be taking their</v>

867
00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:01.060
<v Speaker 5>own feet off just to get those too?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When we've actually discussed that,</v>

868
00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.610
<v Speaker 5>what we've discussed is not for those </v>
<v Speaker 5>blades,</v>

869
00:41:03.611 --> 00:41:06.400
<v Speaker 5>but there's gonna come a time where </v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a guy that we,</v>

870
00:41:06.401 --> 00:41:11.401
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we talked about on the podcast once he </v>

871
00:41:11.401 --> 00:41:14.281
<v Speaker 5>had gotten his leg and his arm bitten </v>
<v Speaker 5>off by a shark and he had replaced them </v>

872
00:41:14.281 --> 00:41:19.230
<v Speaker 5>with these really high tech replacement </v>
<v Speaker 5>hands that articulate and his,</v>

873
00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:24.640
<v Speaker 5>his leg was perfectly suited to his body</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he walked around with no limp.</v>

874
00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:29.970
<v Speaker 5>It was so strange and you see the guys </v>
<v Speaker 5>there talking and he's having a </v>

875
00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:30.700
<v Speaker 5>conversation and talking about that and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's using his,</v>

876
00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:35.780
<v Speaker 5>his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his artificial hand and his real to </v>

877
00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:35.780
<v Speaker 5>gesture and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

878
00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:40.740
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what they're going to get better at </v>

879
00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:40.740
<v Speaker 5>those.</v>

880
00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:43.030
<v Speaker 5>Like the old days it was like I went to </v>
<v Speaker 5>school with this girl and she lost her </v>

881
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:43.880
<v Speaker 5>arm like really early on in life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was always,</v>

882
00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:45.630
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody was always weirded out by it.</v>

883
00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.300
<v Speaker 5>She had a hook.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a very nice girl,</v>

884
00:41:47.301 --> 00:41:52.301
<v Speaker 5>but she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if she had like this artificial hand </v>

885
00:41:52.301 --> 00:41:54.590
<v Speaker 5>that looked exactly like a real hand is </v>
<v Speaker 5>just a different color.</v>

886
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:56.450
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

887
00:41:56.510 --> 00:42:01.510
<v Speaker 5>how much different would people react to</v>
<v Speaker 5>her then a decade later if she has an </v>

888
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:05.681
<v Speaker 5>artificial hand that has some sort of an</v>
<v Speaker 5>artificial skin component to it that </v>

889
00:42:05.681 --> 00:42:09.161
<v Speaker 5>actually has sensitivity built into it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it interacts with her nerves that </v>

890
00:42:09.161 --> 00:42:09.410
<v Speaker 5>allows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

891
00:42:09.411 --> 00:42:13.100
<v Speaker 5>they have some that allow you to pick up</v>
<v Speaker 5>pieces of glass and not break them.</v>

892
00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:14.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean they have like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really?</v>

893
00:42:14.721 --> 00:42:16.670
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they allow you to feel pressure,</v>

894
00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:21.850
<v Speaker 5>like really sensitive one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they're developing one day they're </v>

895
00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:23.090
<v Speaker 5>going to get one that's better than your</v>
<v Speaker 5>actual legs.</v>

896
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:26.980
<v Speaker 5>So if you had these regular legs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can give you an operation and uh,</v>

897
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:31.990
<v Speaker 5>it'll make you run like Hussein bolt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have some artificial </v>

898
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:31.990
<v Speaker 5>legs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

899
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:32.570
<v Speaker 5>it's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to go through a rehab process.</v>

900
00:42:32.571 --> 00:42:35.120
<v Speaker 5>You won't be able to walk for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 5>of weeks because we're going to cut your</v>

901
00:42:35.121 --> 00:42:40.121
<v Speaker 5>fucking legs off and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These carbon fiber jammies in there and </v>

902
00:42:40.121 --> 00:42:44.470
<v Speaker 5>and put the joint endings in and fuse </v>
<v Speaker 5>them with this new thing that we've </v>

903
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.470
<v Speaker 5>created.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

904
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:45.460
<v Speaker 5>someone's going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>

905
00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:47.390
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a matter of time.</v>

906
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:53.630
<v Speaker 5>Just a matter of time before we have </v>
<v Speaker 5>artificial bodies into someone's going </v>

907
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:54.500
<v Speaker 5>to just suck your head right out of your</v>
<v Speaker 5>brain,</v>

908
00:42:54.501 --> 00:42:57.290
<v Speaker 5>right out of your head and stuffing into</v>
<v Speaker 5>this thing and boom,</v>

909
00:42:57.291 --> 00:43:01.380
<v Speaker 5>you're just going to be like piloting </v>
<v Speaker 5>around this crazy body right now.</v>

910
00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:01.640
<v Speaker 5>You think.</v>

911
00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:04.850
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely think that that's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond the point though,</v>

912
00:43:04.851 --> 00:43:09.851
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Until then we've got to deal with what </v>

913
00:43:09.851 --> 00:43:09.851
<v Speaker 2>we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

914
00:43:09.851 --> 00:43:09.851
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I would say,</v>

915
00:43:09.851 --> 00:43:11.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a biomechanist,</v>

916
00:43:11.041 --> 00:43:16.041
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of the colleagues that I work </v>
<v Speaker 2>with are in a orthopedic development and</v>

917
00:43:16.131 --> 00:43:18.920
<v Speaker 2>stuff that you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's kind of my,</v>

918
00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.280
<v Speaker 2>my territory just to see what people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming up with,</v>

919
00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:25.340
<v Speaker 2>but the big thing that you can't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>get around yet is that,</v>

920
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:31.030
<v Speaker 2>that your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that your parts are doing other parts </v>

921
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:34.391
<v Speaker 2>and just moving you around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's always kind of the limitation of </v>

922
00:43:34.391 --> 00:43:34.391
<v Speaker 2>like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you lose a part,</v>

923
00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:38.210
<v Speaker 2>you know that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the loss and you can replace it,</v>

924
00:43:38.211 --> 00:43:40.370
<v Speaker 2>but to voluntarily take off healthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>parts,</v>

925
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:43.310
<v Speaker 2>those parts do things other than just be</v>
<v Speaker 2>those parts.</v>

926
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:45.620
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're participating in the system.</v>

927
00:43:45.621 --> 00:43:50.621
<v Speaker 2>It's like kind of the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can't take an animal out of an </v>

928
00:43:50.621 --> 00:43:53.951
<v Speaker 2>ecosystem because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the other animals collapse without </v>

929
00:43:53.951 --> 00:43:55.430
<v Speaker 2>it because they're expanding out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>control and something else is dying off.</v>

930
00:43:55.431 --> 00:43:56.750
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing.</v>

931
00:43:56.751 --> 00:44:00.410
<v Speaker 2>The parts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the part has a role as a part,</v>

932
00:44:00.411 --> 00:44:05.411
<v Speaker 2>but it also has a role within the system</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that'll be the backfiring on </v>

933
00:44:05.411 --> 00:44:05.411
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

934
00:44:05.411 --> 00:44:09.100
<v Speaker 5>The balance though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like putting an invasive species </v>

935
00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:09.100
<v Speaker 5>into an ecosystem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>screws everything up.</v>

936
00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:09.890
<v Speaker 5>There's a balance.</v>

937
00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.010
<v Speaker 2>There's a relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>

938
00:44:12.011 --> 00:44:17.011
<v Speaker 2>It took a really long time to establish </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you start messing around that </v>

939
00:44:17.011 --> 00:44:17.560
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're playing clean up like the rest of</v>

940
00:44:17.561 --> 00:44:19.090
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>

941
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:23.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now when you like,</v>

942
00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:26.440
<v Speaker 5>when you think about human movement,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what?</v>

943
00:44:26.441 --> 00:44:31.441
<v Speaker 5>Besides the shoes that you wear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are the other big issues that </v>

944
00:44:31.441 --> 00:44:32.250
<v Speaker 5>people have and how</v>

945
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:37.250
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how they get through this life with </v>

946
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:37.250
<v Speaker 6>their body?</v>

947
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:40.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't walk enough like they're </v>

948
00:44:41.821 --> 00:44:44.190
<v Speaker 2>missing in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a whole group of people who</v>

949
00:44:44.191 --> 00:44:49.191
<v Speaker 2>don't eat any fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people don't eat any fat as a </v>

950
00:44:49.191 --> 00:44:52.731
<v Speaker 2>whole category of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a micronutrient and then they're slowly </v>

951
00:44:52.731 --> 00:44:57.381
<v Speaker 2>introducing it back in and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had all these health problems because </v>

952
00:44:57.381 --> 00:45:00.081
<v Speaker 2>I was missing I'm fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe I didn't eat any protein or </v>

953
00:45:00.081 --> 00:45:00.120
<v Speaker 2>maybe I didn't eat any animal products.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

954
00:45:00.121 --> 00:45:05.121
<v Speaker 2>like they've got these big voids in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their diet and then there are diseases </v>

955
00:45:05.121 --> 00:45:08.460
<v Speaker 2>that show up when you have some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some void like vitamin C,</v>

956
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:12.550
<v Speaker 2>no one even knew you needed vitamin C </v>
<v Speaker 2>until you have this group of sailors,</v>

957
00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:17.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this case population that went </v>

958
00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:17.570
<v Speaker 2>without it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

959
00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:17.570
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have that.</v>

960
00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:18.090
<v Speaker 2>They had adequate food so it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>calories they're missing.</v>

961
00:45:18.091 --> 00:45:21.550
<v Speaker 2>And it took 40 years before someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize it.</v>

962
00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:26.560
<v Speaker 2>The vitamin C it's APP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've figured out that we can get them </v>

963
00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.840
<v Speaker 2>their connective tissue to stop bleeding</v>
<v Speaker 2>profusely if we give them a oranges or </v>

964
00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:34.551
<v Speaker 2>lemons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it took another 60 or 70 years </v>

965
00:45:34.551 --> 00:45:34.551
<v Speaker 2>for someone to identify that as vitamin </v>
<v Speaker 2>C.</v>

966
00:45:34.551 --> 00:45:37.020
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's essential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body can't live without it,</v>

967
00:45:37.021 --> 00:45:40.050
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so walking is really one of those things</v>

968
00:45:40.051 --> 00:45:45.051
<v Speaker 2>that your body can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't function as it as it should </v>

969
00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:50.450
<v Speaker 2>without it that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are these other byproducts </v>

970
00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:51.870
<v Speaker 2>that go along when you walk in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular way,</v>

971
00:45:51.871 --> 00:45:53.760
<v Speaker 2>so that's where alignment comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's this,</v>

972
00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:59.210
<v Speaker 2>these series of loads that are created </v>
<v Speaker 2>by using your body and in walking would </v>

973
00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:03.401
<v Speaker 2>have been the thing that you would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing most often out of out of all the </v>

974
00:46:03.401 --> 00:46:04.860
<v Speaker 2>moves that your body has done for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>millennium,</v>

975
00:46:04.861 --> 00:46:09.861
<v Speaker 2>walking is the load maker that you would</v>
<v Speaker 2>do the most and there's people who just </v>

976
00:46:09.861 --> 00:46:11.430
<v Speaker 2>don't walk at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They work out,</v>

977
00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.170
<v Speaker 2>they're fit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they run,</v>

978
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:14.460
<v Speaker 2>they do everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't walk.</v>

979
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:15.600
<v Speaker 2>That's huge.</v>

980
00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:21.220
<v Speaker 6>So just walking alone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just important just to to balance out </v>

981
00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:21.440
<v Speaker 6>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just to be a normal,</v>

982
00:46:21.441 --> 00:46:22.220
<v Speaker 6>healthy person.</v>

983
00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:23.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

984
00:46:23.551 --> 00:46:24.690
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an input,</v>

985
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:26.810
<v Speaker 2>it's an input to your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to your body slam.</v>

986
00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.370
<v Speaker 2>We don't think of movement as an input,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a squash,</v>

987
00:46:29.371 --> 00:46:34.371
<v Speaker 2>like your cells are squashed by the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you move and then then the way that</v>

988
00:46:34.891 --> 00:46:36.990
<v Speaker 2>the cells expressed themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of,</v>

989
00:46:36.991 --> 00:46:41.991
<v Speaker 2>their genetic expression is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is comes about by the mechanical </v>

990
00:46:41.991 --> 00:46:43.590
<v Speaker 2>environment is one of the important </v>
<v Speaker 2>environments.</v>

991
00:46:43.591 --> 00:46:48.591
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and right now for a lot of people it's </v>

992
00:46:48.591 --> 00:46:48.591
<v Speaker 2>walking free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just walking,</v>

993
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:51.990
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really have any purpose in </v>
<v Speaker 2>our life any longer because you don't,</v>

994
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.620
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to walk anywhere to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything done.</v>

995
00:46:55.621 --> 00:46:57.840
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like this Orca Fin,</v>

996
00:46:57.841 --> 00:46:59.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>

997
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:03.000
<v Speaker 2>the way that an Orca swims in the wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>is what maintains its structure.</v>

998
00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:05.610
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing that the Orca can do now</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this flopped over fin.</v>

999
00:47:05.611 --> 00:47:08.490
<v Speaker 2>It can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can't do opposing fin curls.</v>

1000
00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:10.980
<v Speaker 2>It can't foam roller out the floppy </v>
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

1001
00:47:10.981 --> 00:47:13.710
<v Speaker 2>The structure has been set by the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that swims in a circle.</v>

1002
00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.320
<v Speaker 2>So it softens all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

1003
00:47:16.321 --> 00:47:20.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fins soften as the worker goes from it's</v>

1004
00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:23.040
<v Speaker 2>juvenile through its teenager to </v>
<v Speaker 2>adulthood.</v>

1005
00:47:23.041 --> 00:47:28.041
<v Speaker 2>But coupled package with that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>swimming in a particular way at depths </v>

1006
00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:32.290
<v Speaker 2>where the forces are such that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintains and shapes this structure,</v>

1007
00:47:32.291 --> 00:47:35.890
<v Speaker 2>this end result that we call an Orca.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're,</v>

1008
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:40.750
<v Speaker 2>we are swimming metaphorically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just counterclockwise all of the time.</v>

1009
00:47:40.751 --> 00:47:45.751
<v Speaker 2>And so our structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our definition of fit and healthy is </v>

1010
00:47:45.751 --> 00:47:48.760
<v Speaker 2>like the peak of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This orca with the flopped over fin,</v>

1011
00:47:48.761 --> 00:47:51.220
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get swimming in a circle at seaworld and</v>

1012
00:47:51.221 --> 00:47:56.221
<v Speaker 2>you can see the vast difference between </v>
<v Speaker 2>any possible swimming program he can be </v>

1013
00:47:56.221 --> 00:47:58.750
<v Speaker 2>put on there compared to how he would </v>
<v Speaker 2>swim in the ocean,</v>

1014
00:47:58.751 --> 00:48:03.751
<v Speaker 2>getting food every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like 100 miles of swimming </v>

1015
00:48:03.751 --> 00:48:06.421
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fast sprints when they have to get </v>

1016
00:48:06.421 --> 00:48:06.421
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1017
00:48:06.421 --> 00:48:07.540
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's mating their social time,</v>

1018
00:48:07.541 --> 00:48:12.220
<v Speaker 2>there's all these things that go on in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wild that is the necessary input for</v>

1019
00:48:12.221 --> 00:48:13.840
<v Speaker 2>being an Orca.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you just say,</v>

1020
00:48:13.841 --> 00:48:16.780
<v Speaker 2>well then what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what necessary inputs are we missing?</v>

1021
00:48:16.781 --> 00:48:21.781
<v Speaker 2>Kind of is as humans because so much of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our physiology depends on how we move </v>

1022
00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:23.800
<v Speaker 2>and how we don't.</v>

1023
00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:25.180
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1024
00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:29.960
<v Speaker 6>to use an analogy that you used earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the Orca in that pool is kind of in</v>

1025
00:48:29.961 --> 00:48:31.340
<v Speaker 6>a cast,</v>
<v Speaker 6>correct?</v>

1026
00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:35.420
<v Speaker 6>Because the atrophy of lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had my arm broke once and I had a cast</v>

1027
00:48:35.421 --> 00:48:40.421
<v Speaker 6>when I took my arm out of the cast,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was like this little shriveled up </v>

1028
00:48:40.421 --> 00:48:40.421
<v Speaker 6>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1029
00:48:40.421 --> 00:48:41.420
<v Speaker 6>and everybody knows that when you don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>use your muscles,</v>

1030
00:48:41.421 --> 00:48:42.370
<v Speaker 6>they just decide,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1031
00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:44.750
<v Speaker 6>we don't need these and they shrink </v>
<v Speaker 6>down.</v>

1032
00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:48.210
<v Speaker 6>And so that's what's happening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this poor things thin</v>

1033
00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:49.230
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everyone that,</v>

1034
00:48:49.231 --> 00:48:54.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even even people that you know who have </v>

1035
00:48:54.231 --> 00:48:56.511
<v Speaker 2>a ton of muscle mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just compare the distribution of </v>

1036
00:48:56.511 --> 00:49:00.921
<v Speaker 2>muscle mass that you see is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>compared to people who don't do those </v>

1037
00:49:00.921 --> 00:49:02.190
<v Speaker 2>particular things that you do to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>that muscle mass.</v>

1038
00:49:02.191 --> 00:49:07.191
<v Speaker 2>But there is a whole other mass </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution that would come about were </v>

1039
00:49:07.591 --> 00:49:09.600
<v Speaker 2>you to do other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm,</v>

1040
00:49:09.601 --> 00:49:12.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm mostly concerned with disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I,</v>

1041
00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.160
<v Speaker 2>what I work on most are human diseases </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1042
00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:18.600
<v Speaker 2>and basic human functions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm most interested in is,</v>

1043
00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:20.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll like,</v>

1044
00:49:20.281 --> 00:49:21.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting pregnant,</v>

1045
00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.430
<v Speaker 2>maintaining your delivery and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>delivering this child like that.</v>

1046
00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:28.860
<v Speaker 2>We're having some serious fertility and </v>
<v Speaker 2>delivery problems,</v>

1047
00:49:28.861 --> 00:49:29.820
<v Speaker 2>which are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1048
00:49:29.821 --> 00:49:32.940
<v Speaker 2>like the level one for a species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the survival of a species is like,</v>

1049
00:49:32.941 --> 00:49:37.941
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean people can't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>pregnant or they can't birth third </v>

1050
00:49:37.941 --> 00:49:41.720
<v Speaker 2>children anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they need special equipment and </v>

1051
00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:44.031
<v Speaker 2>medical intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like these are big signs for a species </v>

1052
00:49:44.031 --> 00:49:44.100
<v Speaker 2>that it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing happens in zoos,</v>

1053
00:49:44.101 --> 00:49:49.101
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like animals don't breed well in zoos </v>

1054
00:49:49.101 --> 00:49:51.831
<v Speaker 2>because they are missing things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's the same thing that we're </v>

1055
00:49:51.831 --> 00:49:51.831
<v Speaker 2>experienced.</v>

1056
00:49:51.831 --> 00:49:55.180
<v Speaker 6>That's an interesting way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Animals don't breed well in zoos because</v>

1057
00:49:55.181 --> 00:50:00.181
<v Speaker 6>they're missing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Their environment has been radically </v>

1058
00:50:00.181 --> 00:50:00.181
<v Speaker 6>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's the same thing with people.</v>

1059
00:50:00.181 --> 00:50:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're supposed to be interacting with </v>

1060
00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:05.180
<v Speaker 2>other animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like there's so much.</v>

1061
00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:05.400
<v Speaker 2>There's isolation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1062
00:50:05.401 --> 00:50:10.401
<v Speaker 2>not just the animal itself from its herd</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it's try,</v>

1063
00:50:10.651 --> 00:50:12.390
<v Speaker 2>but then from other animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1064
00:50:12.391 --> 00:50:17.391
<v Speaker 2>this is a big system and in zoo research</v>
<v Speaker 2>is really interesting because it's </v>

1065
00:50:17.391 --> 00:50:21.411
<v Speaker 2>covering everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what happens when you put a zoo in </v>

1066
00:50:21.411 --> 00:50:21.411
<v Speaker 2>a city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1067
00:50:21.411 --> 00:50:21.411
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1068
00:50:21.411 --> 00:50:25.961
<v Speaker 2>and have light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got light going on all of the </v>

1069
00:50:25.961 --> 00:50:25.961
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1070
00:50:25.961 --> 00:50:25.961
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1071
00:50:25.961 --> 00:50:28.460
<v Speaker 2>there's constant what they call night </v>
<v Speaker 2>lighting,</v>

1072
00:50:28.461 --> 00:50:30.260
<v Speaker 2>so light beyond this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sun.</v>

1073
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:33.560
<v Speaker 2>And then there's metal noises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the loud clanging.</v>

1074
00:50:33.561 --> 00:50:37.130
<v Speaker 2>Plus there's all these biological cues </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you ever go camping,</v>

1075
00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:38.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear the bugs,</v>

1076
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:43.750
<v Speaker 2>the bugs let you know the birds let you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know where everything else is in that </v>

1077
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:47.450
<v Speaker 2>there are cultures who understand who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who have this input of,</v>

1078
00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:52.400
<v Speaker 2>of noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And from a scientific perspective,</v>

1079
00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:53.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like these things.</v>

1080
00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:58.460
<v Speaker 2>All of the data that we have on humans </v>
<v Speaker 2>really comes from the last,</v>

1081
00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.890
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe like 60 to 100 years.</v>

1082
00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:03.530
<v Speaker 2>And so there's like these basic in </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychology tests,</v>

1083
00:51:03.531 --> 00:51:05.480
<v Speaker 2>like you've probably seen them where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got the arrows,</v>

1084
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:08.300
<v Speaker 2>the outset arrows pointed outward on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tips.</v>

1085
00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:10.410
<v Speaker 2>And then on the other tip of the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>early point in words,</v>

1086
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:13.850
<v Speaker 2>which line is longer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of an optical illusion and you</v>

1087
00:51:13.851 --> 00:51:18.851
<v Speaker 2>get it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everyone says that the arrows that </v>

1088
00:51:18.851 --> 00:51:18.851
<v Speaker 2>point in his longer or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was like,</v>

1089
00:51:18.851 --> 00:51:21.680
<v Speaker 2>so this is how the human brain works and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all this data like that.</v>

1090
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:27.190
<v Speaker 2>Only it turns out if you take that test </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a culture that actually needs to </v>

1091
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:29.930
<v Speaker 2>judge distance for survival,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a problem seeing.</v>

1092
00:51:29.931 --> 00:51:34.220
<v Speaker 2>It's not an optical illusion to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just poor skill when we look at it.</v>

1093
00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:39.580
<v Speaker 2>So there are all of these hypotheses on </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans are studying college aged humans </v>

1094
00:51:42.201 --> 00:51:44.150
<v Speaker 2>like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're looking at orcas with floppy,</v>

1095
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:49.390
<v Speaker 2>floppy fins and then are just making all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these judgments on whales and so I'm at </v>

1096
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:53.270
<v Speaker 2>with this realization that so much of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

1097
00:51:53.271 --> 00:51:56.600
<v Speaker 2>like your human physiology textbook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not human physiology,</v>

1098
00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:59.180
<v Speaker 2>that shape that you're looking at have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>skeleton that's,</v>

1099
00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:04.550
<v Speaker 2>that's modern guy who's worn shoes his </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole life and walked on flat and level,</v>

1100
00:52:04.551 --> 00:52:06.260
<v Speaker 2>flat and level ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another cast.</v>

1101
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:11.410
<v Speaker 2>You're not supposed to walk like flat </v>
<v Speaker 2>and level is the most weird abnormal </v>

1102
00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:16.150
<v Speaker 2>texture for you to ever walk on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yet you've probably only walked on </v>

1103
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:17.060
<v Speaker 2>flat and level for like 99 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>

1104
00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:22.090
<v Speaker 2>Your ankle joint has a different shape </v>
<v Speaker 2>than someone who has walked in the </v>

1105
00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:26.951
<v Speaker 2>wilderness their whole entire life </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they use more parts just to get </v>

1106
00:52:26.951 --> 00:52:26.951
<v Speaker 2>walking done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Use almost nothing to walk.</v>

1107
00:52:26.951 --> 00:52:28.340
<v Speaker 2>Walking is falling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's our.</v>

1108
00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:33.760
<v Speaker 2>That's our saying is sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For someone who sits in the chair most </v>

1109
00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:34.130
<v Speaker 2>of the time and walks on flat and level </v>
<v Speaker 2>in shoes that's falling.</v>

1110
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:37.010
<v Speaker 2>Some people have an incredibly difficult</v>
<v Speaker 2>time going up hills.</v>

1111
00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:40.220
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The different muscles and different.</v>

1112
00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:46.170
<v Speaker 5>One of the first times I went hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went hunting in Montana and we were </v>

1113
00:52:46.170 --> 00:52:50.311
<v Speaker 5>climbing up these hills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's used to be the great western </v>

1114
00:52:50.311 --> 00:52:50.830
<v Speaker 5>inland sea near,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1115
00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:55.890
<v Speaker 5>it's the Missouri breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so it's this weird clay like </v>

1116
00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:59.850
<v Speaker 5>material that covers all the ground and </v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're walking up hill you're </v>

1117
00:52:59.850 --> 00:53:03.190
<v Speaker 5>sliding a lot down and everything is </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of slippery.</v>

1118
00:53:03.310 --> 00:53:08.310
<v Speaker 5>So everywhere you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're constantly counterbalancing and </v>

1119
00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:10.831
<v Speaker 5>catching yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's not like us and you get </v>

1120
00:53:10.831 --> 00:53:10.870
<v Speaker 5>exhausted like you think you're in </v>
<v Speaker 5>shape.</v>

1121
00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:14.980
<v Speaker 5>Like you could do all kinds of crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>workouts and crossfit your brains out,</v>

1122
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:20.190
<v Speaker 5>but then you go up these hills all day </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're fucking tired and by the end </v>

1123
00:53:20.190 --> 00:53:24.840
<v Speaker 5>of the day you're starving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have this weird hunger for animal </v>

1124
00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:28.921
<v Speaker 5>protein to for animal protein and fat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like fatty things and even pasta or any </v>

1125
00:53:29.701 --> 00:53:34.701
<v Speaker 5>like high calorie things like this </v>
<v Speaker 5>intense craving for because your body's </v>

1126
00:53:34.701 --> 00:53:37.500
<v Speaker 5>just doing all this breaking down of </v>
<v Speaker 5>tissue all day long.</v>

1127
00:53:37.501 --> 00:53:41.160
<v Speaker 5>You're stressing your body in a weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>way that you just don't get.</v>

1128
00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:42.450
<v Speaker 5>Like walking around the city</v>

1129
00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:45.000
<v Speaker 2>we've gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've gotten rid of everything.</v>

1130
00:53:45.001 --> 00:53:50.001
<v Speaker 2>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only variable that we have left to </v>

1131
00:53:50.001 --> 00:53:50.950
<v Speaker 2>play with his intensity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like,</v>

1132
00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:52.920
<v Speaker 2>well I'm walking on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to go faster.</v>

1133
00:53:52.921 --> 00:53:57.921
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to go harder because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that's left to respond to</v>

1134
00:53:58.351 --> 00:54:03.351
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the thing with casts is if </v>

1135
00:54:03.351 --> 00:54:04.881
<v Speaker 2>you've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've removed any other movement </v>

1136
00:54:04.881 --> 00:54:08.841
<v Speaker 2>that would allow you to do any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cross training or use new parts in </v>

1137
00:54:08.841 --> 00:54:10.740
<v Speaker 2>different ways than all you have left to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do is the same thing harder or faster,</v>

1138
00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:16.130
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>texture for people who study the human </v>

1139
00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:19.611
<v Speaker 2>kinetic chain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like things like walking and like the </v>

1140
00:54:19.611 --> 00:54:21.510
<v Speaker 2>foot skin like you're going up hills and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoes probably,</v>

1141
00:54:21.511 --> 00:54:23.910
<v Speaker 2>but if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't have shoes on,</v>

1142
00:54:23.911 --> 00:54:27.000
<v Speaker 2>that first level of of traction would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the skin,</v>

1143
00:54:27.001 --> 00:54:32.001
<v Speaker 2>which means your skin has to be strong </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to carry the load of your body </v>

1144
00:54:32.001 --> 00:54:33.460
<v Speaker 2>here hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1145
00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:35.580
<v Speaker 2>people do a ton of work with their upper</v>
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>

1146
00:54:35.581 --> 00:54:40.581
<v Speaker 2>but they won't actually bring the hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>skin along to the strength of the rest </v>

1147
00:54:40.581 --> 00:54:41.670
<v Speaker 2>of their body because everything's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bar,</v>

1148
00:54:41.671 --> 00:54:46.671
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this flat uniform level never </v>

1149
00:54:46.671 --> 00:54:49.491
<v Speaker 2>occur in nature bar as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>picking up things with texture and each </v>

1150
00:54:49.491 --> 00:54:52.801
<v Speaker 2>other's texture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of bite in the skin and then </v>

1151
00:54:52.801 --> 00:54:53.700
<v Speaker 2>your skin strengthens and then your arms</v>
<v Speaker 2>are stronger because.</v>

1152
00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:59.540
<v Speaker 2>Because that first level of caring or </v>
<v Speaker 2>picking up or hauling out or doing </v>

1153
00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:01.860
<v Speaker 2>anything is traction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Traction between you and the earth,</v>

1154
00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:03.390
<v Speaker 2>human and the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Animal on earth,</v>

1155
00:55:03.391 --> 00:55:04.470
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a hand or foot.</v>

1156
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:09.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One thing I've never understood is I </v>

1157
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:09.870
<v Speaker 5>understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've never done it.</v>

1158
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:14.220
<v Speaker 5>I've never agreed with it is guys who </v>
<v Speaker 5>put risk traps on and do all these </v>

1159
00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:17.071
<v Speaker 5>exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're carrying weight that your </v>

1160
00:55:17.071 --> 00:55:20.071
<v Speaker 5>hands can support,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're kind of doing your body a </v>

1161
00:55:20.071 --> 00:55:21.190
<v Speaker 5>disservice or you're overloading your </v>
<v Speaker 5>joint 20 doing that,</v>

1162
00:55:21.191 --> 00:55:21.460
<v Speaker 5>aren't you?</v>

1163
00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:22.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1164
00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:27.770
<v Speaker 2>because what's happening is they can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get any stronger to carry that because </v>

1165
00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:28.230
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1166
00:55:28.231 --> 00:55:31.560
<v Speaker 2>it's this limited flat and round thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1167
00:55:31.561 --> 00:55:36.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can pick up your kettlebell or </v>

1168
00:55:36.561 --> 00:55:36.561
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as it's getting heavier,</v>

1169
00:55:36.561 --> 00:55:37.410
<v Speaker 2>it's the same handle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

1170
00:55:37.810 --> 00:55:42.810
<v Speaker 2>there's parts of you that are left out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of getting stronger because the </v>

1171
00:55:42.810 --> 00:55:46.110
<v Speaker 2>environment is repetitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you go out and hang from a tree,</v>

1172
00:55:46.111 --> 00:55:49.860
<v Speaker 2>if you were holding onto something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of fit in a little bit,</v>

1173
00:55:49.861 --> 00:55:54.861
<v Speaker 2>then you would be able to carry with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your hands whatever you were also able </v>

1174
00:55:54.861 --> 00:55:59.391
<v Speaker 2>to carry with for the rest of the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be some sort of cross </v>

1175
00:55:59.391 --> 00:55:59.391
<v Speaker 2>training for the hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't just be that same</v>

1176
00:55:59.391 --> 00:56:04.210
<v Speaker 5>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So instead of just gripping like this </v>

1177
00:56:04.210 --> 00:56:06.131
<v Speaker 5>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should do some stuff like this and </v>

1178
00:56:06.131 --> 00:56:06.131
<v Speaker 5>you should pull things and you should </v>
<v Speaker 5>be.</v>

1179
00:56:06.131 --> 00:56:08.450
<v Speaker 2>And texture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texture is,</v>

1180
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:13.870
<v Speaker 2>it's not musculoskeletal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has nothing to do with the amount </v>

1181
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:13.870
<v Speaker 2>your joints flex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1182
00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:16.350
<v Speaker 2>So girth of a bar is one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1183
00:56:16.351 --> 00:56:18.410
<v Speaker 2>the size and the shape of the bar and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the angle.</v>

1184
00:56:18.411 --> 00:56:20.480
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of cross training the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands,</v>

1185
00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 2>but there's also the skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your skin just not</v>

1186
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:28.980
<v Speaker 4>strong enough because the things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you are exercising with are these kind </v>

1187
00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:32.010
<v Speaker 4>of smooth man made fake things are not </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything that you would actually like.</v>

1188
00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:33.490
<v Speaker 4>This is the weight of a log.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like great.</v>

1189
00:56:33.491 --> 00:56:35.790
<v Speaker 4>Go pick up a log to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should pick up long.</v>

1190
00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:37.720
<v Speaker 4>You should pick up logs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pickup some,</v>

1191
00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:41.050
<v Speaker 4>some rocks or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or at least hall yourself up in a tree.</v>

1192
00:56:41.051 --> 00:56:42.970
<v Speaker 4>Every now and then instead of on a chin </v>
<v Speaker 4>up bar,</v>

1193
00:56:42.971 --> 00:56:43.660
<v Speaker 4>like in a gym.</v>

1194
00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:47.130
<v Speaker 5>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need trees to climb up,</v>

1195
00:56:47.131 --> 00:56:48.810
<v Speaker 5>but if you fall down from the tree,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're fucked.</v>

1196
00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:50.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or are you.</v>

1197
00:56:50.351 --> 00:56:52.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you've never really loaded.</v>

1198
00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:57.840
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other thing would walls you're </v>

1199
00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:57.840
<v Speaker 4>fucked if you fall from a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1200
00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:58.660
<v Speaker 4>the same thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1201
00:56:58.661 --> 00:57:01.450
<v Speaker 4>dropping something on your foot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You become a little bit more mindful.</v>

1202
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:02.800
<v Speaker 4>You become more mindful.</v>

1203
00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:08.060
<v Speaker 5>My friend Cameron does this work out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he does it once a week where he </v>

1204
00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:12.500
<v Speaker 5>takes a rock that's 135 pound rock and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he carries it up to the top of a </v>

1205
00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:14.700
<v Speaker 5>mountain and he doesn't want it two </v>
<v Speaker 5>ways.</v>

1206
00:57:14.701 --> 00:57:16.950
<v Speaker 5>Like sometimes he throws it in his </v>
<v Speaker 5>backpack.</v>

1207
00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:22.040
<v Speaker 5>He has like one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a big oversized tenzing backpacks,</v>

1208
00:57:22.321 --> 00:57:27.321
<v Speaker 5>like with all the straps on it that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>would use for like carrying game out of </v>

1209
00:57:27.321 --> 00:57:27.321
<v Speaker 5>the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a big l connor.</v>

1210
00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:30.090
<v Speaker 5>And to train his body to carry heavy </v>
<v Speaker 5>loads,</v>

1211
00:57:30.091 --> 00:57:35.091
<v Speaker 5>he just takes us 135 pound rock throws </v>
<v Speaker 5>in his backpack and goes up hills or </v>

1212
00:57:35.091 --> 00:57:39.470
<v Speaker 5>sometimes he just picks this rock up and</v>
<v Speaker 5>puts it on his shoulder and goes up </v>

1213
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:42.591
<v Speaker 5>hills and just rotate shoulders and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think in his eyes like anything you do </v>

1214
00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:49.760
<v Speaker 5>that's unusual or difficult and training</v>
<v Speaker 5>your body and training it in some way </v>

1215
00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:53.961
<v Speaker 5>that's going to sort of mimic what he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to have to do if he's hunting and </v>

1216
00:57:53.961 --> 00:57:55.350
<v Speaker 5>carrying an elk out of the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like similar to that.</v>

1217
00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:55.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1218
00:57:55.570 --> 00:58:00.570
<v Speaker 4>six law of specificity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to get to it as close as </v>

1219
00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:00.570
<v Speaker 4>possible,</v>

1220
00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:03.780
<v Speaker 5>but he's also still carrying this </v>
<v Speaker 5>awkward weight and doing things in a way</v>

1221
00:58:03.781 --> 00:58:05.760
<v Speaker 5>that makes you your body like </v>
<v Speaker 5>compensate.</v>

1222
00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:07.200
<v Speaker 4>But that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But see,</v>

1223
00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:10.110
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing with posture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why it's a modern construct.</v>

1224
00:58:10.111 --> 00:58:15.111
<v Speaker 4>Like to say that there's a safe way to </v>
<v Speaker 4>carry a rock really means that if I'm </v>

1225
00:58:15.181 --> 00:58:18.660
<v Speaker 4>only doing this one thing and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>sitting down the rest of the time,</v>

1226
00:58:18.661 --> 00:58:23.661
<v Speaker 4>that the only way that my whole body's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be trained is if I do my </v>

1227
00:58:23.661 --> 00:58:26.340
<v Speaker 4>training time symmetrically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you were just moving all the time,</v>

1228
00:58:26.341 --> 00:58:28.320
<v Speaker 4>kind of a nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would balance out and actually.</v>

1229
00:58:28.321 --> 00:58:33.321
<v Speaker 4>Because you'd never encouraged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never encounter the same load twice </v>

1230
00:58:33.321 --> 00:58:33.660
<v Speaker 4>really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I have kids,</v>

1231
00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:36.600
<v Speaker 4>I have a two year old and a three old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've never had a stroller.</v>

1232
00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:41.310
<v Speaker 4>We've carried those 30 and 40 pounders </v>
<v Speaker 4>exclusively miles.</v>

1233
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:44.100
<v Speaker 4>And so that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was our big thing.</v>

1234
00:58:44.101 --> 00:58:44.490
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1235
00:58:44.491 --> 00:58:45.640
<v Speaker 4>so everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1236
00:58:45.810 --> 00:58:50.810
<v Speaker 4>when you have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times your workout changes </v>

1237
00:58:50.810 --> 00:58:50.810
<v Speaker 4>because there's just no more time </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

1238
00:58:50.810 --> 00:58:55.550
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you carry them and then they're </v>

1239
00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:58.310
<v Speaker 4>dynamic and they're moving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means it's not like it's not </v>

1240
00:58:58.310 --> 00:59:00.630
<v Speaker 4>holding a 30 or 40 pound ball,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1241
00:59:00.631 --> 00:59:05.631
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a different load because there for </v>

1242
00:59:05.631 --> 00:59:07.940
<v Speaker 4>30 and 40 pounds is distributed at their</v>
<v Speaker 4>whim based on what they want to look at </v>

1243
00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:09.780
<v Speaker 4>and where they want to go and they want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to go to this site now.</v>

1244
00:59:09.781 --> 00:59:13.560
<v Speaker 4>So they are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are strong little shits,</v>

1245
00:59:13.561 --> 00:59:15.690
<v Speaker 4>like they're strong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're really strong,</v>

1246
00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:18.720
<v Speaker 4>but they've been carrying themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've been carrying them.</v>

1247
00:59:18.721 --> 00:59:20.910
<v Speaker 4>So it's like there's been this </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship,</v>

1248
00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:23.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm always strong enough to carry them </v>
<v Speaker 4>five miles.</v>

1249
00:59:23.391 --> 00:59:24.140
<v Speaker 4>No problem.</v>

1250
00:59:24.490 --> 00:59:26.050
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five miles,</v>

1251
00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:31.000
<v Speaker 3>five miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1252
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:34.710
<v Speaker 4>That's very impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Carrying anything that's 30 plus pounds,</v>

1253
00:59:34.711 --> 00:59:37.030
<v Speaker 4>five miles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't put down when you're like,</v>

1254
00:59:37.050 --> 00:59:38.460
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like we've committed,</v>

1255
00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:40.230
<v Speaker 4>we're in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're in the wilderness.</v>

1256
00:59:40.231 --> 00:59:44.700
<v Speaker 4>We will have to come out now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like my six year old is awesome.</v>

1257
00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:48.870
<v Speaker 4>She pulls full guard on your show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrap her legs around you and essentially</v>

1258
00:59:48.871 --> 00:59:50.610
<v Speaker 4>almost carries her homework and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of it.</v>

1259
00:59:50.611 --> 00:59:55.611
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So since they've never been in a </v>

1260
00:59:55.611 --> 00:59:57.051
<v Speaker 4>stroller,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they know how to hold on to and they </v>

1261
00:59:57.051 --> 00:59:59.211
<v Speaker 4>could hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean when they were like six or seven </v>

1262
00:59:59.211 --> 00:59:59.211
<v Speaker 4>months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were strong enough to hold on.</v>

1263
00:59:59.211 --> 01:00:00.360
<v Speaker 4>It could hang from their own hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

1264
01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:05.390
<v Speaker 4>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That you had to give them the </v>

1265
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.390
<v Speaker 4>environment to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was never put him in anything.</v>

1266
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:10.040
<v Speaker 4>That's so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you like have engineered this in a </v>

1267
01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:10.040
<v Speaker 4>way?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I think it was,</v>

1268
01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.000
<v Speaker 4>it's been around for a really long time.</v>

1269
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.970
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that's like in your own personal.</v>

1270
01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:19.020
<v Speaker 4>My own personal life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've just a really do everything that I </v>

1271
01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.490
<v Speaker 4>recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've just done myself.</v>

1272
01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:23.250
<v Speaker 4>I do it as a workout.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I carry both of them.</v>

1273
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:25.380
<v Speaker 4>Like when we go places and they get </v>
<v Speaker 4>tired.</v>

1274
01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:29.580
<v Speaker 4>I carry both my kids a six year old and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the four year old I always team up.</v>

1275
01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:32.520
<v Speaker 4>I have an 18 year old but I'm carrying a</v>
<v Speaker 4>six year old,</v>

1276
01:00:32.521 --> 01:00:35.520
<v Speaker 4>the four year old or hoist him up on my </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoulders and haul them around.</v>

1277
01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:38.190
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a really good workout if you,</v>

1278
01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:43.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you carry carrying 70 pounds and some </v>

1279
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:43.200
<v Speaker 4>sort of a weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1280
01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:46.400
<v Speaker 4>you got like 40 on one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30 on the other and you sort of balance </v>

1281
01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.310
<v Speaker 4>and amount,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it balances out over time.</v>

1282
01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:48.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess that's a thing with,</v>

1283
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:50.850
<v Speaker 4>with loads the body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they should balance out over time.</v>

1284
01:00:50.851 --> 01:00:52.950
<v Speaker 4>They don't always have to balance out </v>
<v Speaker 4>over an hour.</v>

1285
01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:55.640
<v Speaker 3>I found out something recently that </v>
<v Speaker 3>disturbed me.</v>

1286
01:00:56.870 --> 01:01:01.870
<v Speaker 3>I always throw my backpack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I throw it over my right shoulder like </v>

1287
01:01:03.351 --> 01:01:06.500
<v Speaker 3>this and I walk around and it just sits </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1288
01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:11.830
<v Speaker 3>But then when I throw it over my left </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoulder it slumps down and it's </v>

1289
01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:16.481
<v Speaker 3>awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't carry it on my skin right </v>

1290
01:01:16.481 --> 01:01:16.481
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1291
01:01:16.481 --> 01:01:17.510
<v Speaker 3>like my left shoulder doesn't know how </v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep it up.</v>

1292
01:01:17.511 --> 01:01:18.980
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what the fuck is going on?</v>

1293
01:01:18.981 --> 01:01:23.981
<v Speaker 3>Why does it keep doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does it keep falling over my left </v>

1294
01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:23.981
<v Speaker 3>one when I put on my right one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

1295
01:01:23.981 --> 01:01:25.790
<v Speaker 3>it just locks in place there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's effortless,</v>

1296
01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:28.970
<v Speaker 3>but over my left one it's like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>extra work.</v>

1297
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:31.520
<v Speaker 3>So I started carrying it only on my left</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

1298
01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:32.500
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1299
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:35.540
<v Speaker 3>pick up the slack bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's odd,</v>

1300
01:01:36.010 --> 01:01:38.720
<v Speaker 3>like I think I'm in balanced in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of strange way.</v>

1301
01:01:38.810 --> 01:01:39.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1302
01:01:39.291 --> 01:01:42.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the shape of your body is down on the,</v>

1303
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:43.910
<v Speaker 4>on the cellular level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1304
01:01:43.911 --> 01:01:48.911
<v Speaker 4>they look at bones and people they can </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell who his right hand and you'll be </v>

1305
01:01:48.911 --> 01:01:49.040
<v Speaker 4>able to tell you right handed or left </v>
<v Speaker 4>handed.</v>

1306
01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.390
<v Speaker 4>That's how all that anthropological data</v>
<v Speaker 4>just.</v>

1307
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:56.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's bone robust tenicity the size and </v>

1308
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:58.361
<v Speaker 4>the shape of your bone lets people know </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you did with your body while you </v>

1309
01:01:58.361 --> 01:01:58.361
<v Speaker 4>were here.</v>

1310
01:01:58.361 --> 01:02:03.130
<v Speaker 3>Well that's also why bounce in like </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain exercises like pictures and </v>

1311
01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:07.871
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get imbalanced because they're </v>

1312
01:02:07.871 --> 01:02:07.871
<v Speaker 3>always throwing with your right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my friend Steve Maxwell,</v>

1313
01:02:07.871 --> 01:02:12.460
<v Speaker 3>he's worked with a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have issues with their back and stuff </v>

1314
01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:15.191
<v Speaker 3>and like one of them was a kicker and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>fixed it all by making them kick with </v>

1315
01:02:15.191 --> 01:02:15.440
<v Speaker 3>the left leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1316
01:02:15.441 --> 01:02:17.360
<v Speaker 3>you're own kicking with your right leg </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>

1317
01:02:17.361 --> 01:02:19.040
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever kick with your left leg?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I was like,</v>

1318
01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like</v>

1319
01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.690
<v Speaker 5>you need to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you're,</v>

1320
01:02:21.691 --> 01:02:26.691
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're loading up one side of your body </v>

1321
01:02:26.691 --> 01:02:29.420
<v Speaker 5>constantly all day and the other side is</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting virtually no movement in the </v>

1322
01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:34.161
<v Speaker 5>same direction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's just going to have to start </v>

1323
01:02:34.161 --> 01:02:34.161
<v Speaker 5>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And all of his problems went away.</v>

1324
01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:36.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just do heavy,</v>

1325
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:41.770
<v Speaker 2>high loads on one side all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is your sport like that can't be your </v>

1326
01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:42.980
<v Speaker 2>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to a little bit better balanced.</v>

1327
01:02:43.030 --> 01:02:45.310
<v Speaker 5>But isn't that incredible?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I don't think pitchers,</v>

1328
01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:50.550
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really don't know what they do about </v>

1329
01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:52.861
<v Speaker 5>that now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's probably more people like </v>

1330
01:02:52.861 --> 01:02:52.861
<v Speaker 5>you now that are interacting with these </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys and teaching them things.</v>

1331
01:02:52.861 --> 01:02:55.060
<v Speaker 5>But I think for the most part they just </v>
<v Speaker 5>throw the one arm</v>

1332
01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.340
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing with the thing,</v>

1333
01:02:56.341 --> 01:02:58.370
<v Speaker 2>with the picture data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the CTCS,</v>

1334
01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:01.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just muscle,</v>

1335
01:03:01.471 --> 01:03:03.500
<v Speaker 2>like it's easy to correct a muscle </v>
<v Speaker 2>imbalance.</v>

1336
01:03:03.501 --> 01:03:04.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1337
01:03:04.291 --> 01:03:09.291
<v Speaker 2>you clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see that there's more muscle </v>

1338
01:03:09.291 --> 01:03:09.291
<v Speaker 2>mass on one side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their bone,</v>

1339
01:03:09.291 --> 01:03:14.090
<v Speaker 2>the bone itself is torked now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that the reason that you know if you </v>

1340
01:03:14.341 --> 01:03:15.930
<v Speaker 2>have enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you wind up,</v>

1341
01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:20.960
<v Speaker 2>if you imagine winding up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this great need for range of </v>

1342
01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:21.480
<v Speaker 2>motion behind you and your body is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficient.</v>

1343
01:03:21.481 --> 01:03:25.650
<v Speaker 2>If you are going to keep challenging the</v>
<v Speaker 2>muscles to get longer,</v>

1344
01:03:25.651 --> 01:03:29.160
<v Speaker 2>to stretch to that position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will just move the bone there so that</v>

1345
01:03:29.161 --> 01:03:31.620
<v Speaker 2>the muscles can go back to kind of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>regular length.</v>

1346
01:03:31.621 --> 01:03:36.060
<v Speaker 2>So now you have the same range of motion</v>
<v Speaker 2>in both arms,</v>

1347
01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:41.270
<v Speaker 2>but the range of motion isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different location on your pitching arm </v>

1348
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.940
<v Speaker 2>because you've twisted the bone there.</v>

1349
01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:46.940
<v Speaker 2>So that phenomenon of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your bones being shaped by what you </v>

1350
01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:49.170
<v Speaker 2>do is happening to all of us all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1351
01:03:49.171 --> 01:03:50.760
<v Speaker 2>People will say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have tibial torsion,</v>

1352
01:03:50.761 --> 01:03:51.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in my lower leg.</v>

1353
01:03:51.901 --> 01:03:52.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1354
01:03:52.321 --> 01:03:57.321
<v Speaker 2>your gait pattern has slowly wound your </v>
<v Speaker 2>bones so that your foot is no longer in </v>

1355
01:03:57.751 --> 01:04:01.860
<v Speaker 2>the same plane as it once was or would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been.</v>

1356
01:04:01.861 --> 01:04:06.861
<v Speaker 2>So you already are an entirely different</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape than you would have been had you </v>

1357
01:04:06.861 --> 01:04:06.861
<v Speaker 2>been moving differently throughout your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1358
01:04:06.861 --> 01:04:07.380
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1359
01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:11.820
<v Speaker 2>you're not just like more or less muscle</v>
<v Speaker 2>in shape or out of shape.</v>

1360
01:04:11.850 --> 01:04:13.350
<v Speaker 2>You're an entirely different shape.</v>

1361
01:04:13.790 --> 01:04:15.680
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1362
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:20.910
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I started doing martial arts when I was </v>

1363
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:23.051
<v Speaker 5>a young boy and did it all throughout my</v>
<v Speaker 5>adolescent years through puberty.</v>

1364
01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:29.030
<v Speaker 5>That's probably my body sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>developed to do those movements.</v>

1365
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:32.930
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the reasons why when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>take people,</v>

1366
01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:36.110
<v Speaker 5>one of the big issues with a martial </v>
<v Speaker 5>arts,</v>

1367
01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:41.170
<v Speaker 5>some martial arts that have really </v>
<v Speaker 5>difficult for older people to learn and </v>

1368
01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:43.010
<v Speaker 5>kicking seems to be one of the hardest </v>
<v Speaker 5>ones.</v>

1369
01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:48.250
<v Speaker 5>For whatever reason your body just does </v>
<v Speaker 5>not want to learn that as an older </v>

1370
01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:48.250
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But as a young person,</v>

1371
01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:50.960
<v Speaker 5>like my six year old,</v>
<v Speaker 5>her little hips are just so,</v>

1372
01:04:50.961 --> 01:04:55.961
<v Speaker 5>like loose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She knows she can just throw her legs </v>

1373
01:04:55.961 --> 01:04:55.961
<v Speaker 5>around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no resistance,</v>

1374
01:04:55.961 --> 01:04:59.770
<v Speaker 5>but old people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very difficult getting into </v>

1375
01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:00.200
<v Speaker 5>properly with enough speed and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and to,</v>

1376
01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:05.530
<v Speaker 5>to have impact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you get someone that's the same </v>

1377
01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:07.190
<v Speaker 5>age has been doing it since there were </v>
<v Speaker 5>child there could do it really quickly.</v>

1378
01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:10.340
<v Speaker 5>It's was like there's something about </v>
<v Speaker 5>the body developing,</v>

1379
01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.540
<v Speaker 5>doing those movements.</v>

1380
01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:12.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1381
01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:16.540
<v Speaker 2>zero to zero to five is the most where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the most malleable,</v>

1382
01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:18.190
<v Speaker 2>like your skeleton isn't</v>

1383
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:23.190
<v Speaker 4>even set yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then when you go from five to 15 and</v>

1384
01:05:24.011 --> 01:05:29.011
<v Speaker 4>probably all the way up to 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you are much more malleable than </v>

1385
01:05:29.011 --> 01:05:30.010
<v Speaker 4>you will be after your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your bone,</v>

1386
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:33.490
<v Speaker 4>your bone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We say bone density because it's easiest</v>

1387
01:05:33.491 --> 01:05:36.340
<v Speaker 4>to measure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but your bone shape and all that entails</v>

1388
01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:40.780
<v Speaker 4>is set really for life at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know if you would squat,</v>

1389
01:05:40.781 --> 01:05:43.120
<v Speaker 4>so you probably squat a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least if you're in a martial art,</v>

1390
01:05:43.121 --> 01:05:44.710
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times they're squatting put </v>
<v Speaker 4>into it,</v>

1391
01:05:44.711 --> 01:05:46.750
<v Speaker 4>but if you take someone who's been </v>
<v Speaker 4>sitting at their office,</v>

1392
01:05:46.751 --> 01:05:49.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>using a toilet their whole entire life,</v>

1393
01:05:49.331 --> 01:05:53.290
<v Speaker 4>their hips have never articulated to </v>
<v Speaker 4>that degree that you're,</v>

1394
01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:58.440
<v Speaker 4>that you're asking them to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in the tradition of the martial art </v>

1395
01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:01.201
<v Speaker 4>that people who came up with the martial</v>
<v Speaker 4>art oftentimes live in entirely </v>

1396
01:06:01.201 --> 01:06:01.330
<v Speaker 4>different lifestyle.</v>

1397
01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:02.490
<v Speaker 4>Where they're shaped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're.</v>

1398
01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:07.560
<v Speaker 4>There are shapes that facilitate sports </v>
<v Speaker 4>better and the in the shape that </v>

1399
01:06:07.721 --> 01:06:12.721
<v Speaker 4>facilitates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It tends to come from the areas that </v>

1400
01:06:12.721 --> 01:06:14.911
<v Speaker 4>create whatever the sport is that you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about because anthropometric </v>

1401
01:06:14.911 --> 01:06:16.660
<v Speaker 4>dimensions are the size and the shape of</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body.</v>

1402
01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:21.900
<v Speaker 4>Sports and leverages that you create are</v>
<v Speaker 4>heavily dependent on anther prometric </v>

1403
01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:26.821
<v Speaker 4>dimensions and so your pelvis you might </v>
<v Speaker 4>not be able to kick because your pelvis </v>

1404
01:06:26.821 --> 01:06:31.770
<v Speaker 4>is shaped by not kicking like you have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>not kicking pelvis because you were a </v>

1405
01:06:31.770 --> 01:06:35.701
<v Speaker 4>non kicker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't just all of a sudden start to </v>

1406
01:06:35.701 --> 01:06:38.641
<v Speaker 4>be a kicker any any more than the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pitcher can decide to not have it </v>

1407
01:06:38.641 --> 01:06:39.550
<v Speaker 4>twisted bone in his arm anymore after </v>
<v Speaker 4>throwing his whole entire life.</v>

1408
01:06:39.590 --> 01:06:44.590
<v Speaker 6>So if you develop your whole life as a </v>
<v Speaker 6>non kick and then someone tries to show </v>

1409
01:06:44.590 --> 01:06:44.590
<v Speaker 6>you kicking techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is there.</v>

1410
01:06:44.590 --> 01:06:49.301
<v Speaker 6>Is there a way to open you up and make </v>
<v Speaker 6>you more pliable and make your body </v>

1411
01:06:49.941 --> 01:06:51.440
<v Speaker 6>adapt to those movements better?</v>

1412
01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:56.560
<v Speaker 4>I think that there is because you are </v>
<v Speaker 4>malleable really as a structure </v>

1413
01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:00.431
<v Speaker 4>throughout your entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think that it's larger than do </v>

1414
01:07:00.431 --> 01:07:04.481
<v Speaker 4>this kick over and over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there are ways to facilitate the </v>

1415
01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:09.521
<v Speaker 4>mobility of the entire structure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if it were me and I was trying to </v>

1416
01:07:09.521 --> 01:07:10.190
<v Speaker 4>teach them martial art,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wouldn't just be the kick.</v>

1417
01:07:10.191 --> 01:07:10.880
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1418
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:16.390
<v Speaker 4>What do these that are good at kicking?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what are the other lifestyle </v>

1419
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:16.390
<v Speaker 4>things?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1420
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:17.240
<v Speaker 4>it's about frequency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not enough.</v>

1421
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:22.270
<v Speaker 4>It's not enough load like not kicking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're constantly adapting to not </v>

1422
01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:23.780
<v Speaker 4>kicking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the amount that you kick is,</v>

1423
01:07:23.781 --> 01:07:25.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean how many kicks are you going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>practice 100.</v>

1424
01:07:25.850 --> 01:07:30.850
<v Speaker 4>100.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's so it's so it's so it's too </v>

1425
01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:30.850
<v Speaker 4>small.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so small.</v>

1426
01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:34.910
<v Speaker 4>What you're asking to adapt to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are ways to create change in shape</v>

1427
01:07:34.911 --> 01:07:39.911
<v Speaker 4>and bones and that there's evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really does happen throughout a </v>

1428
01:07:39.911 --> 01:07:43.001
<v Speaker 4>lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just the exercise paradigm is so </v>

1429
01:07:43.001 --> 01:07:45.641
<v Speaker 4>small to training paradigm is so small.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you want to become more </v>

1430
01:07:45.641 --> 01:07:49.091
<v Speaker 4>malleable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to change everything that you </v>

1431
01:07:49.091 --> 01:07:49.091
<v Speaker 4>do all of the time and you will adapt to</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1432
01:07:49.091 --> 01:07:53.910
<v Speaker 6>Do people have a built in limitation as </v>
<v Speaker 6>far as their flexibility or is it simply</v>

1433
01:07:55.421 --> 01:07:59.520
<v Speaker 6>a matter of the amount of time and </v>
<v Speaker 6>effort you spend trying to explain?</v>

1434
01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:01.060
<v Speaker 6>You expand your flexibility?</v>

1435
01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:06.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't think humans have a builtin </v>
<v Speaker 4>limitation from birth,</v>

1436
01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:09.730
<v Speaker 4>but I think that your range of motion </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets set really,</v>

1437
01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:13.980
<v Speaker 4>really early and we are in a mobilizing </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture like we a mobilizer.</v>

1438
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:17.570
<v Speaker 4>Babies really like the whole culture </v>
<v Speaker 4>really doesn't work unless your kids are</v>

1439
01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:23.020
<v Speaker 4>quiet and still in someplace at the time</v>
<v Speaker 4>in which are the most dynamic and I'm </v>

1440
01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:26.870
<v Speaker 4>now people now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1441
01:08:26.871 --> 01:08:29.090
<v Speaker 4>we used to roll around in the back of </v>
<v Speaker 4>our station wagon,</v>

1442
01:08:29.091 --> 01:08:34.091
<v Speaker 4>but now kids are like locked in even </v>
<v Speaker 4>more for a longer period of time and </v>

1443
01:08:34.091 --> 01:08:37.070
<v Speaker 4>they have more casts on them now so </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're very,</v>

1444
01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:42.071
<v Speaker 4>very inflexible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Extremely inflexible or the ranges of </v>

1445
01:08:42.071 --> 01:08:44.660
<v Speaker 4>motion are in way different planes than </v>
<v Speaker 4>they would be.</v>

1446
01:08:44.661 --> 01:08:48.770
<v Speaker 4>So like you can still have 50 degrees of</v>
<v Speaker 4>hip motion,</v>

1447
01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:52.250
<v Speaker 4>but it's all in front of you instead of </v>
<v Speaker 4>port of it being behind you.</v>

1448
01:08:52.690 --> 01:08:53.660
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1449
01:08:53.661 --> 01:08:58.661
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the weird ones I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 5>teaching is teaching people to lift </v>

1450
01:08:58.671 --> 01:09:02.120
<v Speaker 5>their leg up and to move it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like in this range,</v>

1451
01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:05.510
<v Speaker 5>like whether it's a cross or this one is</v>
<v Speaker 5>even weirder.</v>

1452
01:09:05.511 --> 01:09:07.460
<v Speaker 5>Lifting your leg up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's called a hook kick.</v>

1453
01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:10.070
<v Speaker 5>You lift your leg up and bring it </v>
<v Speaker 5>across.</v>

1454
01:09:10.071 --> 01:09:15.071
<v Speaker 5>This way it's just a different movement </v>
<v Speaker 5>and a looseness of the hips and I've </v>

1455
01:09:15.071 --> 01:09:17.870
<v Speaker 5>talked to people about it and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>big copout as people go,</v>

1456
01:09:17.871 --> 01:09:20.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm not naturally flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're naturally flexible and I'm like,</v>

1457
01:09:20.811 --> 01:09:22.130
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know about all that.</v>

1458
01:09:22.190 --> 01:09:25.130
<v Speaker 5>I don't seem naturally flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see my mom,</v>

1459
01:09:25.131 --> 01:09:30.131
<v Speaker 5>I see my sister like they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not any but I've done it my </v>

1460
01:09:30.131 --> 01:09:30.890
<v Speaker 5>whole life so I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've become.</v>

1461
01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:35.510
<v Speaker 5>But there was this guy that used to work</v>
<v Speaker 5>out at our gym and he was a really,</v>

1462
01:09:35.511 --> 01:09:40.511
<v Speaker 5>like I'm very dedicated athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a pro football player who retired and </v>

1463
01:09:40.511 --> 01:09:45.200
<v Speaker 5>started getting into Jujitsu and he had </v>
<v Speaker 5>massive flexibility issues for a while,</v>

1464
01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:50.320
<v Speaker 5>but this guy was such a dedicated </v>
<v Speaker 5>athlete that he would get after </v>

1465
01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:50.320
<v Speaker 5>practice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he would,</v>

1466
01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:54.710
<v Speaker 5>he would do his training and then he </v>
<v Speaker 5>would stretch just like painful </v>

1467
01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:54.710
<v Speaker 5>stretches.</v>

1468
01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:59.710
<v Speaker 5>You could see that guy putting way more </v>
<v Speaker 5>time in it and then like a year later </v>

1469
01:09:59.710 --> 01:10:03.581
<v Speaker 5>he's doing the splits and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I pointed it out to everybody in the </v>

1470
01:10:03.581 --> 01:10:03.581
<v Speaker 5>class.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

1471
01:10:03.581 --> 01:10:07.370
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to hear anybody tell me you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can't get flexible because this fucking </v>

1472
01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:08.300
<v Speaker 5>guy got flexible in a year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like in a year,</v>

1473
01:10:08.301 --> 01:10:12.590
<v Speaker 5>this guy was this giant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>250 pound like giant quads,</v>

1474
01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:17.710
<v Speaker 5>like all stiff from all these years of </v>
<v Speaker 5>dead lifting and all that jazz and this </v>

1475
01:10:17.710 --> 01:10:17.710
<v Speaker 5>guy figured out like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1476
01:10:17.710 --> 01:10:20.240
<v Speaker 5>in order to get good at Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to have to really stretch,</v>

1477
01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.400
<v Speaker 5>and we all used him as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1478
01:10:22.401 --> 01:10:24.260
<v Speaker 5>now I know like it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it can be done,</v>

1479
01:10:24.261 --> 01:10:27.060
<v Speaker 5>but you got to really do it and you've </v>
<v Speaker 5>got to do it.</v>

1480
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:32.110
<v Speaker 5>It's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's gonna suck and it's not going to </v>

1481
01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:32.110
<v Speaker 5>feel comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's gonna.</v>

1482
01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:32.660
<v Speaker 5>You're gonna have to stretch that tissue</v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

1483
01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:34.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's frequency.</v>

1484
01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:39.360
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the easiest way to say is it's </v>

1485
01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:39.360
<v Speaker 4>all changeable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have to be super diligent.</v>

1486
01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:43.921
<v Speaker 4>It's about the amount of time that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're asking your body to do something </v>

1487
01:10:43.921 --> 01:10:46.480
<v Speaker 4>and if you imagine the shape of whatever</v>
<v Speaker 4>kick you can do now,</v>

1488
01:10:46.481 --> 01:10:49.210
<v Speaker 4>like whatever small circle it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you imagine this,</v>

1489
01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:53.410
<v Speaker 4>the kick that you want to have your </v>
<v Speaker 4>kicks just have to.</v>

1490
01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:55.630
<v Speaker 4>You have to coax the edge of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're.</v>

1491
01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.100
<v Speaker 4>Your body's like clay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1492
01:10:57.101 --> 01:10:59.860
<v Speaker 4>You're just a matter of you're just </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing the slow reshaping,</v>

1493
01:10:59.861 --> 01:11:04.861
<v Speaker 4>your slowly reshaping and and you want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to just be imagining the shape that </v>

1494
01:11:05.021 --> 01:11:08.170
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to make and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 4>pushing the limits of the tissue because</v>

1495
01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.120
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've been doing it so long,</v>

1496
01:11:10.121 --> 01:11:13.120
<v Speaker 4>you have the parts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your muscle mass becomes longer,</v>

1497
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:14.700
<v Speaker 4>shorter as necessary.</v>

1498
01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:19.700
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the orientation of the bone in its </v>

1499
01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:19.800
<v Speaker 6>socket and all those support issues like</v>
<v Speaker 6>those,</v>

1500
01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.480
<v Speaker 6>it takes a while to adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Takes a year.</v>

1501
01:11:21.481 --> 01:11:23.220
<v Speaker 6>It's not like I've been doing this for </v>
<v Speaker 6>six weeks.</v>

1502
01:11:23.221 --> 01:11:28.221
<v Speaker 6>When is it going to get better?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like you're not doing it for 40 </v>

1503
01:11:28.221 --> 01:11:28.260
<v Speaker 6>years,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you just have to look about.</v>

1504
01:11:28.530 --> 01:11:30.390
<v Speaker 6>You have to look at it more in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 6>time,</v>

1505
01:11:30.391 --> 01:11:35.391
<v Speaker 6>like realistic time and physiology,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think anyone can really accomplish</v>

1506
01:11:35.641 --> 01:11:37.680
<v Speaker 6>some serious physical,</v>
<v Speaker 6>physiological,</v>

1507
01:11:37.681 --> 01:11:40.230
<v Speaker 6>physical transformations,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but again,</v>

1508
01:11:40.231 --> 01:11:43.230
<v Speaker 6>not in that one hour that they allow </v>
<v Speaker 6>themselves three times a week.</v>

1509
01:11:43.231 --> 01:11:45.240
<v Speaker 6>It's got to be bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody wants a pill.</v>

1510
01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.640
<v Speaker 6>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking Dr.</v>

1511
01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:51.150
<v Speaker 6>every time you seen him on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's pushing some God damn diet pill.</v>

1512
01:11:51.151 --> 01:11:53.340
<v Speaker 6>They dragged him in front of Congress </v>
<v Speaker 6>because of that shit.</v>

1513
01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:57.620
<v Speaker 6>He was lying about Miracle Diet pills,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's a real issue with our culture</v>

1514
01:11:57.621 --> 01:11:58.260
<v Speaker 6>is we want to.</v>

1515
01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:03.640
<v Speaker 6>We want to eat things to lose weight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We want to put more food in our fat </v>

1516
01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:04.950
<v Speaker 6>faces and we just want,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1517
01:12:04.951 --> 01:12:09.951
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this diet is going to make you lose </v>

1518
01:12:09.951 --> 01:12:12.171
<v Speaker 6>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what what you're doing by telling </v>

1519
01:12:12.171 --> 01:12:14.070
<v Speaker 6>people that that you can have a pill and</v>
<v Speaker 6>lose weight is you're,</v>

1520
01:12:14.071 --> 01:12:16.680
<v Speaker 6>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What you're doing is denying the reality</v>

1521
01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:21.860
<v Speaker 6>of change and that change requires time </v>
<v Speaker 6>and effort and you can't just pop </v>

1522
01:12:22.381 --> 01:12:27.381
<v Speaker 6>something in there and get a shot and </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything goes away and all your fat </v>

1523
01:12:27.381 --> 01:12:27.500
<v Speaker 6>shrinks away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And like,</v>

1524
01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:30.330
<v Speaker 6>people that want to like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's this friend,</v>

1525
01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:33.120
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she uh,</v>

1526
01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:38.300
<v Speaker 6>got liposuction and didn't need it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean she might've been 20 pounds </v>

1527
01:12:39.331 --> 01:12:41.730
<v Speaker 6>overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like maybe if that,</v>

1528
01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:45.240
<v Speaker 6>like that's a few months of dedication.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

1529
01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:48.330
<v Speaker 6>Just a few months of let's watch our </v>
<v Speaker 6>diet,</v>

1530
01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:49.670
<v Speaker 6>let's you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

1531
01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:52.290
<v Speaker 6>she's got kids and Blah Blah Blah and </v>
<v Speaker 6>she,</v>

1532
01:12:52.291 --> 01:12:53.850
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>has a business and blah blah blah.</v>

1533
01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:58.870
<v Speaker 6>She just doesn't have that much time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you gotTa fucking vacuum stuffed </v>

1534
01:12:58.870 --> 01:13:03.831
<v Speaker 6>under your skin and they sucked all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fat out and now you've got to wear a </v>

1535
01:13:03.831 --> 01:13:05.280
<v Speaker 6>girdle and they going to wear these </v>
<v Speaker 6>compression shorts and shit.</v>

1536
01:13:05.281 --> 01:13:08.690
<v Speaker 6>And everything's all fucked up and lumpy</v>
<v Speaker 6>and like it's crazy.</v>

1537
01:13:08.770 --> 01:13:11.910
<v Speaker 6>Oozing postures,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a drain on her leg because the,</v>

1538
01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:13.980
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the fact that they suck out of it,</v>

1539
01:13:13.981 --> 01:13:17.550
<v Speaker 6>like everything gets infected and it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>all fucking pussy and shit.</v>

1540
01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:21.450
<v Speaker 6>Like you're going to go through two </v>
<v Speaker 6>months of rehabilitation,</v>

1541
01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:23.820
<v Speaker 6>you're going to recover.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's going to take you like,</v>

1542
01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:27.150
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you look slightly thinner right away,</v>

1543
01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:32.420
<v Speaker 6>but at what cost.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the instantaneous nature of the </v>

1544
01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:34.890
<v Speaker 6>gratification of just going to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>doctor or are going to suck it all out.</v>

1545
01:13:34.891 --> 01:13:39.891
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the same thing as the doctor </v>

1546
01:13:39.891 --> 01:13:39.891
<v Speaker 6>telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1547
01:13:39.891 --> 01:13:39.891
<v Speaker 6>you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're going to have to fuse her desk.</v>

1548
01:13:39.891 --> 01:13:40.770
<v Speaker 6>Like you're going to what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like wait a minute,</v>

1549
01:13:40.771 --> 01:13:42.270
<v Speaker 6>I'm moving around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything seems to be.</v>

1550
01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:44.970
<v Speaker 6>There's no way to fix this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just going to get worse.</v>

1551
01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.490
<v Speaker 6>Like they always say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just gonna get worse.</v>

1552
01:13:47.730 --> 01:13:52.730
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I continue to do the same shit that </v>

1553
01:13:52.730 --> 01:13:53.130
<v Speaker 6>made it bad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just going to get worse.</v>

1554
01:13:53.131 --> 01:13:56.850
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Isn't there some sort of a way to change</v>

1555
01:13:56.851 --> 01:13:59.820
<v Speaker 6>that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But nobody thinks about it that way.</v>

1556
01:13:59.850 --> 01:14:04.850
<v Speaker 6>Everybody wants instantaneous </v>
<v Speaker 6>gratification where there's a weird </v>

1557
01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:09.081
<v Speaker 6>space right now where we want,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we want to be better in the very same </v>

1558
01:14:09.081 --> 01:14:13.941
<v Speaker 6>habit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>doing the same things that got us to </v>

1559
01:14:13.941 --> 01:14:13.941
<v Speaker 6>where we are in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it's</v>

1560
01:14:13.941 --> 01:14:13.941
<v Speaker 4>so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like when does that work?</v>

1561
01:14:13.941 --> 01:14:17.620
<v Speaker 4>Anywhere else where like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what has happened,</v>

1562
01:14:17.621 --> 01:14:22.621
<v Speaker 4>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the ramifications of all those </v>

1563
01:14:22.621 --> 01:14:23.230
<v Speaker 4>things that you did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the solution,</v>

1564
01:14:23.231 --> 01:14:28.231
<v Speaker 4>the pill is really so that I don't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to change any of those things that got </v>

1565
01:14:28.231 --> 01:14:31.591
<v Speaker 4>me there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like everyone should take a class </v>

1566
01:14:31.591 --> 01:14:31.591
<v Speaker 4>in human physiology or something.</v>

1567
01:14:31.670 --> 01:14:33.820
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's also the reality of life.</v>

1568
01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:35.670
<v Speaker 5>Dove work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1569
01:14:35.690 --> 01:14:40.690
<v Speaker 5>most people have a job that requires </v>
<v Speaker 5>them to stay in a spot and it's really </v>

1570
01:14:40.791 --> 01:14:43.190
<v Speaker 5>difficult to do anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have this Jarvis desks,</v>

1571
01:14:43.191 --> 01:14:44.150
<v Speaker 5>not this one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

1572
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:46.580
<v Speaker 5>over there and the other room that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie setup,</v>

1573
01:14:46.581 --> 01:14:48.500
<v Speaker 5>you press a button and it stands with </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

1574
01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:52.790
<v Speaker 5>So like as you were at your office,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can do this and you can just go back</v>

1575
01:14:52.791 --> 01:14:57.791
<v Speaker 5>and sit down and you move around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea is to give yourself like a </v>

1576
01:14:57.791 --> 01:15:00.611
<v Speaker 5>couple of minutes sitting a couple </v>
<v Speaker 5>minutes standing and keep moving like </v>

1577
01:15:00.611 --> 01:15:00.611
<v Speaker 5>Zach,</v>

1578
01:15:00.611 --> 01:15:01.300
<v Speaker 4>is that effective?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>

1579
01:15:01.301 --> 01:15:03.580
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's like a whole,</v>

1580
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:06.760
<v Speaker 4>if you just talk about your office,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

1581
01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:08.660
<v Speaker 4>I like the standing workstation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1582
01:15:08.661 --> 01:15:10.810
<v Speaker 4>So the sitting kills stuff sitting's </v>
<v Speaker 4>worse than smoking.</v>

1583
01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:14.320
<v Speaker 4>Then everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm never gonna sit down ever worse.</v>

1584
01:15:14.321 --> 01:15:16.120
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you chain smoke.</v>

1585
01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.790
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you been changed sitting for a long</v>

1586
01:15:18.791 --> 01:15:23.791
<v Speaker 4>time?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What'd you chain smoke end chain set </v>

1587
01:15:23.791 --> 01:15:25.950
<v Speaker 4>than your far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well maybe it's smoking has been saving </v>

1588
01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:25.950
<v Speaker 4>your life by going outside for a smoke </v>
<v Speaker 4>break.</v>

1589
01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:28.810
<v Speaker 4>So small walks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know now like the literature is like</v>

1590
01:15:28.811 --> 01:15:32.230
<v Speaker 4>make sure you take a small walk every 20</v>
<v Speaker 4>minutes like that times perfectly with a</v>

1591
01:15:32.231 --> 01:15:37.231
<v Speaker 4>cigarette break.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And since it's not since it's the old </v>

1592
01:15:37.231 --> 01:15:37.231
<v Speaker 4>smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so old smoking.</v>

1593
01:15:37.231 --> 01:15:37.231
<v Speaker 4>But could you imagine</v>

1594
01:15:37.231 --> 01:15:38.980
<v Speaker 5>someone telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1595
01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:39.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll,</v>

1596
01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:44.560
<v Speaker 5>I'll work in your office by gotta to </v>
<v Speaker 5>take a walk every 20 minutes like fuck </v>

1597
01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:44.560
<v Speaker 5>off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to get anything done.</v>

1598
01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:46.090
<v Speaker 4>Well I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I tell people all the time</v>

1599
01:15:46.091 --> 01:15:48.910
<v Speaker 4>that they should do their phone calls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>walking,</v>

1600
01:15:49.530 --> 01:15:50.650
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like make your,</v>

1601
01:15:50.651 --> 01:15:55.651
<v Speaker 4>save up your phone calls and then just </v>
<v Speaker 4>go out and just take a 20 minute stroll </v>

1602
01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:57.430
<v Speaker 4>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just gotTa stop right here.</v>

1603
01:15:57.431 --> 01:15:59.230
<v Speaker 4>Because I don't have service for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keep walking.</v>

1604
01:15:59.730 --> 01:16:04.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See I live in the cities all different </v>

1605
01:16:04.730 --> 01:16:04.730
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know where these things.</v>

1606
01:16:04.730 --> 01:16:08.910
<v Speaker 4>What will you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you live and you get cell phone </v>

1607
01:16:08.910 --> 01:16:10.861
<v Speaker 4>service.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do everywhere I cell phone service </v>

1608
01:16:10.861 --> 01:16:10.870
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have in China right everywhere.</v>

1609
01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:13.290
<v Speaker 4>Even that can be good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Has that bad,</v>

1610
01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:16.660
<v Speaker 4>bad for bees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cell phone service.</v>

1611
01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:19.870
<v Speaker 4>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that whole emf thing,</v>

1612
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:25.470
<v Speaker 4>they wanted to put some emf weapons up </v>
<v Speaker 4>in an hour in our woods there so that </v>

1613
01:16:25.601 --> 01:16:30.601
<v Speaker 4>it's like we've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no literature that shows that </v>

1614
01:16:30.601 --> 01:16:33.361
<v Speaker 4>they're bad for the body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're going to put some emf weapons </v>

1615
01:16:33.361 --> 01:16:33.361
<v Speaker 4>and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1616
01:16:33.361 --> 01:16:33.361
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1617
01:16:33.361 --> 01:16:37.920
<v Speaker 4>I've seen some interesting studies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Clearly it's doing something so the,</v>

1618
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:43.750
<v Speaker 4>the easiest tissue to test his sperm </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you can get as much sperm to </v>

1619
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:44.770
<v Speaker 4>test and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can.</v>

1620
01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:48.850
<v Speaker 4>It's a ethical I guess to expose it to </v>
<v Speaker 4>emf so they can take,</v>

1621
01:16:49.170 --> 01:16:50.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just gonna throw it away anyway,</v>

1622
01:16:51.010 --> 01:16:56.010
<v Speaker 4>so you can take us to sperm samples and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can put one next to a phone or you </v>

1623
01:16:56.801 --> 01:17:01.801
<v Speaker 4>can have a guy where a phone on his hip </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the sperm is different after having </v>

1624
01:17:02.471 --> 01:17:07.471
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they don't know if it's the heat of </v>

1625
01:17:07.471 --> 01:17:07.471
<v Speaker 4>the device because there's a device in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your pocket,</v>

1626
01:17:07.471 --> 01:17:11.941
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people carry it right there in </v>

1627
01:17:11.941 --> 01:17:11.941
<v Speaker 4>their pocket or right there in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>shirt pockets,</v>

1628
01:17:11.941 --> 01:17:11.941
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1629
01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:14.960
<v Speaker 4>whether it's the heat or the EMF,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they haven't really broken it down.</v>

1630
01:17:14.961 --> 01:17:17.510
<v Speaker 4>And I've seen some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some other smaller studies on,</v>

1631
01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:19.910
<v Speaker 4>on um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1632
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:21.170
<v Speaker 4>fetuses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1633
01:17:21.171 --> 01:17:26.171
<v Speaker 4>where they make the mother have a device</v>
<v Speaker 4>and where a device to see what the cells</v>

1634
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:27.050
<v Speaker 4>look like.</v>

1635
01:17:27.050 --> 01:17:32.050
<v Speaker 4>So the data isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the data is pointing that there is some </v>

1636
01:17:32.050 --> 01:17:34.310
<v Speaker 4>sort of change all with all that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1637
01:17:34.311 --> 01:17:36.230
<v Speaker 4>It's like the dose makes the poison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much,</v>

1638
01:17:36.231 --> 01:17:39.710
<v Speaker 4>what is the change significant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what's gonna happen with that sperm</v>

1639
01:17:39.711 --> 01:17:41.900
<v Speaker 4>that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knows any of that.</v>

1640
01:17:41.901 --> 01:17:43.940
<v Speaker 4>So I guess just say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just say,</v>

1641
01:17:43.941 --> 01:17:44.870
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>use your phone.</v>

1642
01:17:44.871 --> 01:17:49.871
<v Speaker 4>I turn my phone off of air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put it on airplane mode if it's going </v>

1643
01:17:49.871 --> 01:17:51.050
<v Speaker 4>to be by my head when I go to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And other than that,</v>

1644
01:17:51.051 --> 01:17:53.960
<v Speaker 4>I don't keep it on my body or near my </v>
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>

1645
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:56.060
<v Speaker 4>Why do you keep it by your head?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well yeah,</v>

1646
01:17:56.061 --> 01:17:57.830
<v Speaker 4>like if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's my alarm or whatever,</v>

1647
01:17:57.831 --> 01:17:59.690
<v Speaker 4>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can use it for an alarm,</v>

1648
01:17:59.691 --> 01:18:01.010
<v Speaker 4>just turn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can turn it off.</v>

1649
01:18:01.011 --> 01:18:02.840
<v Speaker 4>So that's not transmitted admitting </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

1650
01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:04.820
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But is it's still generating heat?</v>

1651
01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:08.060
<v Speaker 4>Well it's not touching me anymore so </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not all my skin.</v>

1652
01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:11.450
<v Speaker 4>But if you carry it in your pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're carrying in your pocket,</v>

1653
01:18:11.451 --> 01:18:14.150
<v Speaker 4>it would still be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It generates heat more I think when it's</v>

1654
01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:15.110
<v Speaker 4>transmitting</v>

1655
01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:18.500
<v Speaker 5>wonder if people just show up like years</v>
<v Speaker 5>now everyone has asked cancer</v>

1656
01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:23.950
<v Speaker 4>back pocket area ships are all aligned </v>
<v Speaker 4>but now they have asked answer.</v>

1657
01:18:24.170 --> 01:18:29.170
<v Speaker 5>I think like Sheryl Crow has brain </v>
<v Speaker 5>cancer and she was saying that they were</v>

1658
01:18:29.781 --> 01:18:34.781
<v Speaker 5>trying to attribute it to or possibly </v>
<v Speaker 5>attributed to when she was doing press </v>

1659
01:18:34.971 --> 01:18:39.971
<v Speaker 5>for her first cd was the old days of </v>
<v Speaker 5>cell phones and she did all of it </v>

1660
01:18:39.971 --> 01:18:44.291
<v Speaker 5>through her mobile phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She had it up to her head the entire </v>

1661
01:18:44.291 --> 01:18:45.620
<v Speaker 5>time and it's that side of her head that</v>
<v Speaker 5>she has the issue with.</v>

1662
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:52.030
<v Speaker 4>I think that we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we do a lot of stuff that we have no </v>

1663
01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:53.250
<v Speaker 4>idea how it's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1664
01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:54.460
<v Speaker 4>trickle down later</v>

1665
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:56.260
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like everywhere we go,</v>

1666
01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:59.830
<v Speaker 5>you're experiencing wifi signals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>radio signals,</v>

1667
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:01.240
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1668
01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:04.090
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How does the satellite thing work?</v>

1669
01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:09.420
<v Speaker 5>I mean you have to Kinda like have a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an antenna or a dish that points up to </v>

1670
01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:11.110
<v Speaker 5>where the satellite is sending the </v>
<v Speaker 5>signal,</v>

1671
01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.900
<v Speaker 5>but that signal somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting here,</v>

1672
01:19:13.901 --> 01:19:17.200
<v Speaker 5>whether it hits your dish or not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it getting to bodies?</v>

1673
01:19:18.190 --> 01:19:20.650
<v Speaker 5>We know that cell phone signals fuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>with bees.</v>

1674
01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:26.300
<v Speaker 5>Like that's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they've figured out when they were </v>

1675
01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:26.530
<v Speaker 5>trying to figure out what's killing off </v>
<v Speaker 5>all these honeybees.</v>

1676
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:29.740
<v Speaker 5>Most,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most things point towards pesticides,</v>

1677
01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:35.040
<v Speaker 5>but there is an disease,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's also some issue that we </v>

1678
01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:39.121
<v Speaker 5>might be constantly fucking with their </v>
<v Speaker 5>navigation and their ability to </v>

1679
01:19:39.121 --> 01:19:43.411
<v Speaker 5>communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like living next door to </v>

1680
01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:43.900
<v Speaker 5>people that are just playing loud rock </v>
<v Speaker 5>music all day.</v>

1681
01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:46.060
<v Speaker 5>Do you survive?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes you do.</v>

1682
01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:48.160
<v Speaker 5>But does it fuck with the quality of </v>
<v Speaker 5>your life?</v>

1683
01:19:48.370 --> 01:19:49.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it does.</v>

1684
01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:54.560
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and because bees have this weird way of </v>

1685
01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:56.521
<v Speaker 5>communicating with each other that seems</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be interfering or with the cellular </v>

1686
01:19:57.281 --> 01:19:59.710
<v Speaker 5>systems that we have seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>interfering with that.</v>

1687
01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:05.070
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they've shown it was sonar and the </v>

1688
01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:05.070
<v Speaker 4>whales,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1689
01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:06.830
<v Speaker 4>everything is just messed up by these </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

1690
01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.190
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're creating</v>

1691
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:10.050
<v Speaker 2>for whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1692
01:20:10.051 --> 01:20:11.820
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're tangible,</v>

1693
01:20:11.821 --> 01:20:16.821
<v Speaker 2>they're invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just because they're </v>

1694
01:20:16.821 --> 01:20:18.411
<v Speaker 2>invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just don't think of visible things </v>

1695
01:20:18.411 --> 01:20:20.691
<v Speaker 2>having any sort of impacts like wrap me </v>
<v Speaker 2>up in something I want to head pounding </v>

1696
01:20:20.691 --> 01:20:21.510
<v Speaker 2>against my head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I can't see it,</v>

1697
01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.600
<v Speaker 2>how much could it really be harming me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

1698
01:20:24.601 --> 01:20:29.601
<v Speaker 2>every everyone's writing up this huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>list of things that are wrong with them </v>

1699
01:20:29.601 --> 01:20:29.690
<v Speaker 2>and what they're searching for and we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>just flapping on uh,</v>

1700
01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:35.240
<v Speaker 2>well it's just idiopathic or genetic or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever has no cause no known cause </v>

1701
01:20:35.341 --> 01:20:37.020
<v Speaker 2>it just happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's normal.</v>

1702
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.590
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1703
01:20:37.591 --> 01:20:42.591
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So our cell phone towers or chairs and </v>

1704
01:20:42.591 --> 01:20:42.591
<v Speaker 2>all this other stuff.</v>

1705
01:20:42.591 --> 01:20:46.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a weird feeling that you get </v>

1706
01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:46.420
<v Speaker 3>when you get to a completely deserted </v>
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>

1707
01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:49.070
<v Speaker 3>like a real wilderness place with total </v>
<v Speaker 3>quiet,</v>

1708
01:20:49.071 --> 01:20:50.780
<v Speaker 3>no cell phone service,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no nothing.</v>

1709
01:20:52.970 --> 01:20:55.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is weird.</v>

1710
01:20:55.461 --> 01:20:59.000
<v Speaker 3>Like absence of input that you feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

1711
01:20:59.040 --> 01:20:59.660
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1712
01:20:59.661 --> 01:21:01.790
<v Speaker 3>this feels weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I gotta get Outta here.</v>

1713
01:21:02.690 --> 01:21:07.690
<v Speaker 3>Desolate feels like so it's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>unforgiving.</v>

1714
01:21:07.841 --> 01:21:09.920
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't give a fuck if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>around or not around.</v>

1715
01:21:09.921 --> 01:21:14.921
<v Speaker 3>It's like that silence for whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like people that are afraid </v>

1716
01:21:14.921 --> 01:21:18.461
<v Speaker 3>to be alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you have to be out at parties all </v>

1717
01:21:18.461 --> 01:21:20.591
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It got to constantly be talking to </v>

1718
01:21:20.591 --> 01:21:21.971
<v Speaker 3>people on the phone when you're alone </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have to deal with your own </v>

1719
01:21:21.971 --> 01:21:23.891
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you go to those will true </v>

1720
01:21:23.891 --> 01:21:24.200
<v Speaker 3>wilderness areas with no cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 3>service.</v>

1721
01:21:24.201 --> 01:21:25.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1722
01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:27.020
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little scary.</v>

1723
01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:28.630
<v Speaker 3>This is real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1724
01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:31.130
<v Speaker 3>we try to go dark like two days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dark,</v>

1725
01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:33.680
<v Speaker 3>dark wood in the diamond family.</v>

1726
01:21:33.730 --> 01:21:38.730
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Bowman Bowman family goes dark two </v>

1727
01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:41.791
<v Speaker 2>days a week and you just go out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend more time outside than inside and </v>

1728
01:21:41.791 --> 01:21:43.390
<v Speaker 2>that's a great place about having great </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing about having the wilderness.</v>

1729
01:21:43.391 --> 01:21:48.391
<v Speaker 2>There is like huge trees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old growth trees have been around for a </v>

1730
01:21:48.391 --> 01:21:50.450
<v Speaker 2>long time and one time it was windy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>trees were falling</v>

1731
01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:53.080
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like trees are falling down.</v>

1732
01:21:53.081 --> 01:21:54.880
<v Speaker 3>We are in the wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>

1733
01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it happens.</v>

1734
01:21:58.841 --> 01:21:59.830
<v Speaker 3>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1735
01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:03.370
<v Speaker 3>You say that until you get hit by a tree</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I've avoided that.</v>

1736
01:22:03.371 --> 01:22:05.920
<v Speaker 3>You don't have that laissez faire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it happens.</v>

1737
01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:09.220
<v Speaker 3>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe A.</v>

1738
01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:10.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1739
01:22:10.170 --> 01:22:13.240
<v Speaker 3>Fucking hit by an old growth tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Way to go.</v>

1740
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:18.310
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were out in one fell and it sounded </v>

1741
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:21.091
<v Speaker 3>like a gunshot went off and we had </v>
<v Speaker 3>determined that it was a tree that fell </v>

1742
01:22:21.091 --> 01:22:22.220
<v Speaker 3>who was up in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was like boom.</v>

1743
01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:24.760
<v Speaker 3>We're like somebody out here shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck is that?</v>

1744
01:22:25.090 --> 01:22:28.060
<v Speaker 3>And the guy that we were with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I don't think so.</v>

1745
01:22:28.061 --> 01:22:31.700
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a tree with a felling </v>
<v Speaker 3>trees or no towel.</v>

1746
01:22:32.590 --> 01:22:35.920
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking had its time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happens when was blown like,</v>

1747
01:22:35.921 --> 01:22:40.921
<v Speaker 3>that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm tapping out bone and it just came </v>

1748
01:22:40.921 --> 01:22:40.921
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1749
01:22:40.921 --> 01:22:42.070
<v Speaker 3>you find them all over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1750
01:22:42.071 --> 01:22:46.060
<v Speaker 3>There are so many trees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that reality that this,</v>

1751
01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:50.140
<v Speaker 3>this thing has been there before </v>
<v Speaker 3>Columbus ever get near America.</v>

1752
01:22:50.141 --> 01:22:55.141
<v Speaker 3>I mean especially where you are in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pacific northwest when you're dealing </v>

1753
01:22:55.141 --> 01:22:56.290
<v Speaker 3>with some of those trees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a thousand years old,</v>

1754
01:22:56.570 --> 01:22:58.440
<v Speaker 2>almost the whole planet used to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>wooded,</v>

1755
01:22:58.441 --> 01:22:59.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've cut everything down.</v>

1756
01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:01.890
<v Speaker 2>It was almost all wooded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't even.</v>

1757
01:23:02.430 --> 01:23:06.700
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't even walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like up in up in British Columbia,</v>

1758
01:23:06.701 --> 01:23:07.810
<v Speaker 2>up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so thick.</v>

1759
01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:10.540
<v Speaker 2>The all of the trees falling down for </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1760
01:23:10.541 --> 01:23:14.230
<v Speaker 2>All that Moss and stuff that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>walking on is just old mushed up,</v>

1761
01:23:14.231 --> 01:23:19.231
<v Speaker 2>rotted trees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you couldn't even just walk through </v>

1762
01:23:19.231 --> 01:23:22.141
<v Speaker 2>the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are trees everywhere and they've </v>

1763
01:23:22.141 --> 01:23:24.900
<v Speaker 2>cut everything down and so much of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>desert that's in the middle of the </v>

1764
01:23:25.810 --> 01:23:27.280
<v Speaker 2>United States or from those from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fires,</v>

1765
01:23:27.290 --> 01:23:30.670
<v Speaker 2>like when they started using lumber for </v>
<v Speaker 2>oceans,</v>

1766
01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:35.760
<v Speaker 2>ocean ships like all of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The British military ships came from </v>

1767
01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.410
<v Speaker 2>lumber from the Pacific northwest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they are at,</v>

1768
01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:42.420
<v Speaker 2>once they realized that they had that </v>
<v Speaker 2>commodity they are using like wasn't </v>

1769
01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:43.870
<v Speaker 2>mink Mikan Otter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>otter offers where what brought everyone</v>

1770
01:23:43.871 --> 01:23:45.010
<v Speaker 2>to the Pacific northwest.</v>

1771
01:23:45.010 --> 01:23:47.620
<v Speaker 2>They cleaned all the mountain and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>what can we ship now if they would,</v>

1772
01:23:48.670 --> 01:23:51.880
<v Speaker 2>and then they shipped it out and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were making,</v>

1773
01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:53.740
<v Speaker 2>they were milling it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you mill it,</v>

1774
01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:59.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mass of the tree is lost in between </v>

1775
01:23:59.480 --> 01:23:59.480
<v Speaker 2>the boards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's um,</v>

1776
01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:03.330
<v Speaker 2>a sawdust and so sawdust was clogging </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the rivers and there was a big fire </v>

1777
01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:08.460
<v Speaker 2>and then the fire just went across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States because there was no </v>

1778
01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:12.610
<v Speaker 2>natural water barriers anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just burnt it down,</v>

1779
01:24:12.611 --> 01:24:13.810
<v Speaker 2>kind of like your cartilage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1780
01:24:13.811 --> 01:24:15.850
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can use some cartilage grows back,</v>

1781
01:24:15.851 --> 01:24:18.190
<v Speaker 2>but if you take it all the way down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom to the base cells,</v>

1782
01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:20.760
<v Speaker 5>no more's coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's really where that,</v>

1783
01:24:20.761 --> 01:24:24.750
<v Speaker 5>that rock,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really cool.</v>

1784
01:24:24.751 --> 01:24:26.410
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever used a pellet grill?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't.</v>

1785
01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:31.230
<v Speaker 5>A pellet grill and this is company.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A bunch of companies make them,</v>

1786
01:24:31.231 --> 01:24:36.231
<v Speaker 5>but one of them that I'm friends with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his green mountain grills and these </v>

1787
01:24:36.231 --> 01:24:40.011
<v Speaker 5>pellet grills,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they take hardwood pellets and it's </v>

1788
01:24:40.011 --> 01:24:41.760
<v Speaker 5>basically saw dust and they press it in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the natural sugars.</v>

1789
01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:45.810
<v Speaker 5>Allow it to maintain the shape of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like kitty litter.</v>

1790
01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:47.250
<v Speaker 5>If you have a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a cat.</v>

1791
01:24:47.251 --> 01:24:52.251
<v Speaker 5>We use this pine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Literally it looks real similar to the </v>

1792
01:24:52.251 --> 01:24:52.251
<v Speaker 5>stuff that you put it in this pellet </v>
<v Speaker 5>grill.</v>

1793
01:24:52.251 --> 01:24:56.040
<v Speaker 5>It's all digitally regulated so it can </v>
<v Speaker 5>keep the temperature at 200 degrees.</v>

1794
01:24:56.190 --> 01:25:01.190
<v Speaker 5>Can You keep it for like seven hours </v>
<v Speaker 5>with this like pot of of pellets and </v>

1795
01:25:01.190 --> 01:25:03.480
<v Speaker 5>it's like super efficient and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>smoker.</v>

1796
01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:07.260
<v Speaker 5>It's essentially a grill slash smoker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but instead of like,</v>

1797
01:25:07.261 --> 01:25:08.900
<v Speaker 5>have you ever used an old school smoker?</v>

1798
01:25:08.910 --> 01:25:11.790
<v Speaker 5>Like one of those big barrel smokers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are pain in the ass.</v>

1799
01:25:11.791 --> 01:25:13.950
<v Speaker 5>Like you got to like regulate the </v>
<v Speaker 5>openings,</v>

1800
01:25:13.951 --> 01:25:16.800
<v Speaker 5>the valves and make sure you get the </v>
<v Speaker 5>right amount of temperature.</v>

1801
01:25:16.801 --> 01:25:18.570
<v Speaker 5>You've got to keep thermometers in </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1802
01:25:18.571 --> 01:25:23.571
<v Speaker 5>And in the old days it was super </v>
<v Speaker 5>difficult to figure out how hot </v>

1803
01:25:23.571 --> 01:25:23.571
<v Speaker 5>everything was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1804
01:25:23.571 --> 01:25:25.710
<v Speaker 5>And then they figured out how to put </v>
<v Speaker 5>meat thermometer is actually in the meet</v>

1805
01:25:25.711 --> 01:25:28.140
<v Speaker 5>and have digital ones had come outside </v>
<v Speaker 5>and give you a reading.</v>

1806
01:25:28.141 --> 01:25:33.141
<v Speaker 5>But these pellet smokers essentially </v>
<v Speaker 5>they take all that hardwood sawdust that</v>

1807
01:25:33.841 --> 01:25:38.841
<v Speaker 5>used to be just waste and compress it </v>
<v Speaker 5>into these little pellets and then use </v>

1808
01:25:38.841 --> 01:25:39.300
<v Speaker 5>it to cook with smart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1809
01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:44.301
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it tastes really good too when you </v>

1810
01:25:44.301 --> 01:25:44.301
<v Speaker 5>cook it with because you were actually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's real.</v>

1811
01:25:44.301 --> 01:25:48.381
<v Speaker 5>It's not like that's the big issue with </v>
<v Speaker 5>using any sort of lighter fluid or </v>

1812
01:25:48.481 --> 01:25:52.440
<v Speaker 5>anything like those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those ones that are like easy match,</v>

1813
01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:56.030
<v Speaker 5>charcoal briquettes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those chemicals and those things.</v>

1814
01:25:56.031 --> 01:25:57.540
<v Speaker 5>And you can taste it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You smell it.</v>

1815
01:25:58.140 --> 01:25:58.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But this stuff,</v>

1816
01:25:58.861 --> 01:26:00.430
<v Speaker 5>you don't smell any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they're there,</v>

1817
01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:02.250
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it is,</v>

1818
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 5>that's the reality of</v>

1819
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.580
<v Speaker 3>chopping down trees just looks gross and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes you feel sad when you see it.</v>

1820
01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:10.730
<v Speaker 3>But your house is warm because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>chopped down trees.</v>

1821
01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:12.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1822
01:26:13.330 --> 01:26:14.860
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a cutting.</v>

1823
01:26:15.230 --> 01:26:19.150
<v Speaker 4>It's sad to be up there and don't drive </v>
<v Speaker 4>by a forest that's not there anymore.</v>

1824
01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:21.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those cut blocks was gigantic chunks,</v>

1825
01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:23.310
<v Speaker 3>but they kind of regulate that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1826
01:26:23.311 --> 01:26:25.140
<v Speaker 3>Like they only allow you to do it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain spots.</v>

1827
01:26:25.141 --> 01:26:26.490
<v Speaker 3>Then they regrow them and.</v>

1828
01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.070
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're regrowing Americans.</v>

1829
01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:30.330
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing with any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>management.</v>

1830
01:26:30.331 --> 01:26:35.010
<v Speaker 4>Like they're being replanted with stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be cut down into different</v>

1831
01:26:35.011 --> 01:26:37.440
<v Speaker 4>kinds of tree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a non native kind of tree.</v>

1832
01:26:37.441 --> 01:26:39.000
<v Speaker 4>It's the fast growing kind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1833
01:26:39.001 --> 01:26:41.040
<v Speaker 4>So I was trying to get it up and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a commodity,</v>

1834
01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:46.360
<v Speaker 4>a commodity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So get it planted and get it back up so </v>

1835
01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:47.160
<v Speaker 4>we can cut it down again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that old wood,</v>

1836
01:26:47.250 --> 01:26:51.090
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing like old growth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just been around forever.</v>

1837
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:56.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing like being in those </v>

1838
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:57.681
<v Speaker 3>forests to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you really do get that sense </v>

1839
01:26:57.681 --> 01:27:00.381
<v Speaker 3>that while this was here long before the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wheel or long before rather I'm the </v>

1840
01:27:00.381 --> 01:27:02.610
<v Speaker 3>engine or long before boats came over </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

1841
01:27:02.611 --> 01:27:04.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean this stuff out before the wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sixty zero,</v>

1842
01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:05.730
<v Speaker 3>6,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>year old trees,</v>

1843
01:27:05.731 --> 01:27:06.970
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1844
01:27:07.050 --> 01:27:08.790
<v Speaker 3>So I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the oldest tree?</v>

1845
01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:10.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's find out.</v>

1846
01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:12.250
<v Speaker 3>What do you guess?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had to guess,</v>

1847
01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:18.300
<v Speaker 3>it'd be like a sequoia or a redwood or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1848
01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:21.780
<v Speaker 3>How old do you think it would be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's trees.</v>

1849
01:27:21.781 --> 01:27:23.100
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Methuselah,</v>

1850
01:27:23.410 --> 01:27:28.410
<v Speaker 3>a brittle cone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pine tree from California's white </v>

1851
01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:29.010
<v Speaker 3>mountains is thought to be 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years old.</v>

1852
01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:34.950
<v Speaker 3>The oldest non non conal will know what </v>
<v Speaker 3>that means.</v>

1853
01:27:35.370 --> 01:27:39.190
<v Speaker 3>Non clonal tree in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The exact location of the normal trusted</v>

1854
01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:40.170
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1855
01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:44.040
<v Speaker 3>it's kept secret for its protection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1856
01:27:44.610 --> 01:27:49.610
<v Speaker 3>There's a tree that people are so gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to not tell them where the old </v>

1857
01:27:49.610 --> 01:27:53.961
<v Speaker 3>tree is because they'll go cut it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smoking chair out of the tree.</v>

1858
01:27:55.230 --> 01:28:00.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some asshole will go and use it to make </v>

1859
01:28:00.230 --> 01:28:00.230
<v Speaker 3>his headboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That stupid tree.</v>

1860
01:28:00.230 --> 01:28:01.500
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five thousand years old.</v>

1861
01:28:01.501 --> 01:28:04.590
<v Speaker 3>So that's a good answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a God damn old tree.</v>

1862
01:28:05.670 --> 01:28:06.690
<v Speaker 3>That's probably the wheel.</v>

1863
01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:08.820
<v Speaker 4>And there's probably wheels circles all </v>
<v Speaker 4>around it.</v>

1864
01:28:08.910 --> 01:28:10.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1865
01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:16.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's just being around something </v>

1866
01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:19.070
<v Speaker 3>that predates most of human history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just knowing that this thing was a seed </v>

1867
01:28:19.861 --> 01:28:24.861
<v Speaker 3>and that seed became this tree and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just seeing this entire world changed </v>

1868
01:28:24.861 --> 01:28:29.481
<v Speaker 3>during the time that it's been living </v>
<v Speaker 3>and breathing in carbon dioxide and </v>

1869
01:28:29.481 --> 01:28:31.020
<v Speaker 3>breathing out oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very freaky.</v>

1870
01:28:32.190 --> 01:28:37.190
<v Speaker 3>That's something you get with old growth</v>
<v Speaker 3>trees that you're not going to get with </v>

1871
01:28:37.190 --> 01:28:40.080
<v Speaker 3>those cut blocks that are reef </v>
<v Speaker 3>refurbished with these new little shitty</v>

1872
01:28:40.081 --> 01:28:43.110
<v Speaker 3>pine trees that are little tags on them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff.</v>

1873
01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:44.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of fucked.</v>

1874
01:28:44.670 --> 01:28:46.890
<v Speaker 3>That's just a weird thing about people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just,</v>

1875
01:28:46.891 --> 01:28:47.530
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1876
01:28:47.610 --> 01:28:50.850
<v Speaker 3>if we don't put regulations on stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why it's really cool.</v>

1877
01:28:50.851 --> 01:28:53.220
<v Speaker 3>Like a place like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever been to boulder,</v>

1878
01:28:53.221 --> 01:28:58.221
<v Speaker 3>Colorado?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't really allow people to build </v>

1879
01:28:58.221 --> 01:28:58.221
<v Speaker 3>like the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't see any apartment buildings in</v>

1880
01:28:58.221 --> 01:29:02.220
<v Speaker 3>the mountains you don't see like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a very strict amount</v>

1881
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:07.250
<v Speaker 5>of construction that they allow in and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're very strict about it and they </v>

1882
01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:11.310
<v Speaker 5>buy up space on people of like spaced </v>
<v Speaker 5>land that's for sale.</v>

1883
01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:16.340
<v Speaker 5>Like Boulder County will actually buy </v>
<v Speaker 5>that land and make sure that it remains </v>

1884
01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:17.010
<v Speaker 5>open space.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there'll be given ever build on it,</v>

1885
01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:21.630
<v Speaker 5>be kind of have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Keep people from fucking the whole thing</v>

1886
01:29:21.631 --> 01:29:22.290
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1887
01:29:23.630 --> 01:29:25.050
<v Speaker 5>wonder why no one wants to go to Alaska.</v>

1888
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:28.260
<v Speaker 4>I think the last frontier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some space up there.</v>

1889
01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:29.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with everyone's scared of bears.</v>

1890
01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:31.380
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll ask.</v>

1891
01:29:31.381 --> 01:29:33.310
<v Speaker 4>It's freaky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alaska is the law.</v>

1892
01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:36.450
<v Speaker 4>It's like the wild west.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is like the wild west up there.</v>

1893
01:29:36.630 --> 01:29:40.200
<v Speaker 5>The people are really cool though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you spent time in Alaska?</v>

1894
01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:42.890
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My husband had a big motorcycle trip.</v>

1895
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:47.950
<v Speaker 4>They did like a big motorcycle trip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like all around there and they were </v>

1896
01:29:47.950 --> 01:29:48.860
<v Speaker 4>just in some kind of back country and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like everyone here,</v>

1897
01:29:48.861 --> 01:29:52.430
<v Speaker 4>is this like hardy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are.</v>

1898
01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:55.400
<v Speaker 4>They are like the cowboy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever that equivalent spirit is there</v>

1899
01:29:55.401 --> 01:29:57.200
<v Speaker 4>going there because there's this less </v>
<v Speaker 4>rules,</v>

1900
01:29:57.201 --> 01:29:59.660
<v Speaker 4>more space,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more quiet.</v>

1901
01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:02.300
<v Speaker 5>We went to the movies at midnight and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>was bright outside.</v>

1902
01:30:03.190 --> 01:30:05.720
<v Speaker 5>This is fucking strange.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was in the middle of July.</v>

1903
01:30:06.110 --> 01:30:07.370
<v Speaker 5>It was really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we,</v>

1904
01:30:07.410 --> 01:30:09.830
<v Speaker 5>we did a comedy show up there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We got out of the show.</v>

1905
01:30:09.831 --> 01:30:11.060
<v Speaker 5>It was two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>3:00</v>

1906
01:30:11.061 --> 01:30:12.470
<v Speaker 5>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bright out,</v>

1907
01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:17.860
<v Speaker 5>see everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very strange and the people up </v>

1908
01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:20.771
<v Speaker 5>there there are so it's like there's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a sense of community,</v>

1909
01:30:20.841 --> 01:30:25.841
<v Speaker 5>even in the city like anchorage that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't really see in a lot of cities down</v>

1910
01:30:26.061 --> 01:30:28.190
<v Speaker 5>here because their reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1911
01:30:28.191 --> 01:30:31.310
<v Speaker 5>well every now and then a moose comes </v>
<v Speaker 5>into town and kicks the shit out of some</v>

1912
01:30:31.311 --> 01:30:34.280
<v Speaker 5>people at a supermarket or a bear </v>
<v Speaker 5>attack.</v>

1913
01:30:34.281 --> 01:30:37.540
<v Speaker 5>Someone that's in the wrong place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the wrong time or you know,</v>

1914
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:42.550
<v Speaker 5>it's just the reality that they live in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They all have to kind of band together </v>

1915
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:44.270
<v Speaker 5>because every now and then if you see a </v>
<v Speaker 5>car broken down the side of the road,</v>

1916
01:30:44.271 --> 01:30:46.880
<v Speaker 5>like you get out and help that person </v>
<v Speaker 5>because that could be you.</v>

1917
01:30:46.930 --> 01:30:51.930
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas if you're leaving here and you </v>

1918
01:30:51.930 --> 01:30:51.930
<v Speaker 5>get on the one on one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see some guy broken down,</v>

1919
01:30:51.930 --> 01:30:54.350
<v Speaker 5>you don't even think for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me pull over.</v>

1920
01:30:54.650 --> 01:30:56.940
<v Speaker 5>There's 100 million people drive by.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wrong.</v>

1921
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:59.390
<v Speaker 5>No one's thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me go help that guy.</v>

1922
01:30:59.750 --> 01:31:02.960
<v Speaker 5>But if you're in Alaska and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 5>only car you've seen for 20 minutes,</v>

1923
01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:04.370
<v Speaker 5>you pull over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey you okay?</v>

1924
01:31:04.371 --> 01:31:06.080
<v Speaker 5>Like what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you need a call,</v>

1925
01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:11.820
<v Speaker 5>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a sense of community because of </v>

1926
01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:11.820
<v Speaker 5>their harsh conditions because the </v>
<v Speaker 5>environment they're in.</v>

1927
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:12.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need people.</v>

1928
01:31:13.130 --> 01:31:16.810
<v Speaker 4>You really do need a tribal situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have,</v>

1929
01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:18.750
<v Speaker 4>you're spread out a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know you have your,</v>

1930
01:31:19.410 --> 01:31:24.410
<v Speaker 4>your claim or your space,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you need help it's going to </v>

1931
01:31:25.351 --> 01:31:27.660
<v Speaker 4>have to be some other person's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to come help</v>

1932
01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:31.960
<v Speaker 5>but don't think it's kind of healthier </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be in a place where there's like,</v>

1933
01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:34.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the term diffusion of responsibility,</v>

1934
01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:39.520
<v Speaker 5>the idea being that it's easier to </v>
<v Speaker 5>attack someone in front of a thousand </v>

1935
01:31:39.790 --> 01:31:44.790
<v Speaker 5>people than it is in front of one person</v>
<v Speaker 5>because one person feels obligated to </v>

1936
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:48.241
<v Speaker 5>help.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas a thousand people say someone </v>

1937
01:31:48.241 --> 01:31:50.131
<v Speaker 5>should jump in and do something but </v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody does anything because they don't </v>

1938
01:31:50.131 --> 01:31:50.590
<v Speaker 5>feel like they have to because there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>so many other folks.</v>

1939
01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:56.040
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that Kinda like what you get if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in a big city as opposed to like </v>

1940
01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:58.440
<v Speaker 5>maybe where you live or maybe Alaska or </v>
<v Speaker 5>just a.</v>

1941
01:31:58.441 --> 01:31:59.770
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a number</v>

1942
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:01.150
<v Speaker 3>that's manageable.</v>

1943
01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:03.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>

1944
01:32:03.670 --> 01:32:05.860
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like the town that we live in.</v>

1945
01:32:05.861 --> 01:32:08.180
<v Speaker 4>I grew up in a small town and then I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>been,</v>

1946
01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:13.220
<v Speaker 4>I was in southern California for a long </v>
<v Speaker 4>time and it never really felt connected </v>

1947
01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:17.191
<v Speaker 4>as easiest word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now that I'm out there in a little </v>

1948
01:32:17.191 --> 01:32:17.590
<v Speaker 4>bit more rugged or wilderness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1949
01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:18.760
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1950
01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:21.280
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel I feel safe,</v>

1951
01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:26.340
<v Speaker 4>safe knowing that there are neighbors or</v>
<v Speaker 4>community members,</v>

1952
01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:28.960
<v Speaker 4>I feel more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more safe there.</v>

1953
01:32:28.961 --> 01:32:31.630
<v Speaker 4>I think that I feel in the big city.</v>

1954
01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:34.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally makes sense.</v>

1955
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:35.420
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1956
01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:37.560
<v Speaker 3>I think big cities are a new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1957
01:32:37.650 --> 01:32:40.260
<v Speaker 3>as far as human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like our DNA,</v>

1958
01:32:40.330 --> 01:32:42.210
<v Speaker 3>we've only had them for a few hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1959
01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:44.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the biggest city?</v>

1960
01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:49.440
<v Speaker 3>It's probably something in China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like as far as population wise,</v>

1961
01:32:50.130 --> 01:32:53.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean la is kind of huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's really spread out.</v>

1962
01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:56.040
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a city,</v>

1963
01:32:56.041 --> 01:32:58.320
<v Speaker 3>but it's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a giant suburb,</v>

1964
01:32:58.730 --> 01:33:03.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the look at the city aspect of La you </v>

1965
01:33:03.730 --> 01:33:05.070
<v Speaker 3>got like downtown La is what we think of</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a city,</v>

1966
01:33:05.071 --> 01:33:06.600
<v Speaker 3>but because of the fact that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>earthquakes,</v>

1967
01:33:06.601 --> 01:33:11.601
<v Speaker 3>everything is only one level out here </v>
<v Speaker 3>are two levels at most except for </v>

1968
01:33:11.601 --> 01:33:12.840
<v Speaker 3>downtown and you have a few office </v>
<v Speaker 3>buildings here and there,</v>

1969
01:33:12.841 --> 01:33:16.950
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at the landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of like flat things.</v>

1970
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:21.030
<v Speaker 3>I would say probably the biggest is like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Singapore or something like that.</v>

1971
01:33:21.031 --> 01:33:21.310
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

1972
01:33:21.390 --> 01:33:24.690
<v Speaker 4>Hong Delhi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>India has got at least 25 million.</v>

1973
01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:28.950
<v Speaker 4>Do you know your neighbors really well?</v>
<v Speaker 4>My neighbor is a Douche bag.</v>

1974
01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:30.300
<v Speaker 4>So you do.</v>

1975
01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:33.440
<v Speaker 3>I know one neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1976
01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:38.441
<v Speaker 3>I know a couple neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a few people that live on my </v>

1977
01:33:38.441 --> 01:33:38.441
<v Speaker 3>block that I know that I'm friendly </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

1978
01:33:38.441 --> 01:33:38.441
<v Speaker 4>It's wet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People know,</v>

1979
01:33:38.441 --> 01:33:43.321
<v Speaker 4>go outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that it might even be like less </v>

1980
01:33:43.321 --> 01:33:45.771
<v Speaker 4>about numbers and more about how many </v>
<v Speaker 4>people go outside or not because it </v>

1981
01:33:45.771 --> 01:33:46.170
<v Speaker 4>seems to me like in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in big cities,</v>

1982
01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:50.160
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>w or even suburbs of big cities,</v>

1983
01:33:50.161 --> 01:33:52.080
<v Speaker 4>like everyone is pulled their car to </v>
<v Speaker 4>their garage.</v>

1984
01:33:52.081 --> 01:33:55.680
<v Speaker 4>They close their garage and then they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>in their house and then um,</v>

1985
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:58.110
<v Speaker 4>if they're outside,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're in their backyard with her,</v>

1986
01:33:58.320 --> 01:34:03.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>small family that there's not these </v>

1987
01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:03.420
<v Speaker 4>large communities of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>interacting outside.</v>

1988
01:34:03.421 --> 01:34:07.800
<v Speaker 4>So maybe maybe you could have that kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of that safety or you know,</v>

1989
01:34:07.801 --> 01:34:12.801
<v Speaker 4>everyone taking responsibility for </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that you live with because you </v>

1990
01:34:12.801 --> 01:34:16.431
<v Speaker 4>consider yourself living with them </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you see them and you're next to </v>

1991
01:34:16.431 --> 01:34:17.940
<v Speaker 4>them in some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some place.</v>

1992
01:34:17.941 --> 01:34:20.160
<v Speaker 4>But I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're in Alaska,</v>

1993
01:34:20.161 --> 01:34:24.720
<v Speaker 4>I imagine that even if you were in your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if you're up there by yourself,</v>

1994
01:34:24.721 --> 01:34:28.200
<v Speaker 4>you're still spending so much time </v>
<v Speaker 4>outside because you still have to get so</v>

1995
01:34:28.201 --> 01:34:32.820
<v Speaker 4>much for yourself I imagine or just get </v>
<v Speaker 4>out to go pick it up wherever it's being</v>

1996
01:34:32.821 --> 01:34:33.540
<v Speaker 4>shipped in.</v>

1997
01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:35.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's definitely that.</v>

1998
01:34:35.191 --> 01:34:40.191
<v Speaker 3>It's much more expensive to get things </v>
<v Speaker 3>up there and get food and groceries and </v>

1999
01:34:40.191 --> 01:34:42.510
<v Speaker 3>things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially the more rural you get,</v>

2000
01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:44.670
<v Speaker 3>the more problematic it is to get things</v>
<v Speaker 3>delivered.</v>

2001
01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:45.890
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2002
01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:49.110
<v Speaker 3>when I say my neighbors a Douche bag or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something bad guys just kind of goofy,</v>

2003
01:34:49.380 --> 01:34:52.050
<v Speaker 3>but there's some people in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood that are very cool,</v>

2004
01:34:52.051 --> 01:34:53.060
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2005
01:34:53.070 --> 01:34:55.260
<v Speaker 3>I see them and it's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nice to have a community where,</v>

2006
01:34:55.261 --> 01:34:57.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go up the street and you see,</v>

2007
01:34:57.410 --> 01:34:58.250
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>

2008
01:34:58.251 --> 01:34:59.330
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're still working on that.</v>

2009
01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blah Blah Blah.</v>

2010
01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:03.530
<v Speaker 3>So it's nice like you have like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>little sort of relationship with.</v>

2011
01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:08.531
<v Speaker 3>But I didn't choose these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just moved in and I got lucky that </v>

2012
01:35:08.531 --> 01:35:11.090
<v Speaker 3>some of them were okay and became </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends with some along the way.</v>

2013
01:35:11.090 --> 01:35:16.090
<v Speaker 3>But it's like ideally I've always said </v>
<v Speaker 3>the really smart thing to do would be </v>

2014
01:35:16.090 --> 01:35:17.360
<v Speaker 3>get together with all your friends and </v>
<v Speaker 3>loved ones and say,</v>

2015
01:35:17.361 --> 01:35:19.040
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's all live in this area.</v>

2016
01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:22.640
<v Speaker 3>Let's all move to this one street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that possible to do like,</v>

2017
01:35:22.641 --> 01:35:25.340
<v Speaker 3>let's get the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But nobody ever really does that.</v>

2018
01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:30.400
<v Speaker 3>They always say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had 15 of those conversations with </v>

2019
01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:33.221
<v Speaker 3>my friends and with my friend Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just moved out in my neighborhood </v>

2020
01:35:33.221 --> 01:35:33.221
<v Speaker 3>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2021
01:35:33.221 --> 01:35:33.221
<v Speaker 3>come,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come,</v>

2022
01:35:33.221 --> 01:35:37.780
<v Speaker 3>come look on my block.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like fucking guy moved like 10 </v>

2023
01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:37.780
<v Speaker 3>miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2024
01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:41.231
<v Speaker 3>why did you move over there dummy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my wife looks to be close to the </v>

2025
01:35:41.231 --> 01:35:41.270
<v Speaker 3>grocery store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fucking grocery store.</v>

2026
01:35:41.271 --> 01:35:46.271
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get in your car anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dummy isn't getting you car for 30 </v>

2027
01:35:46.271 --> 01:35:47.450
<v Speaker 3>seconds or three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it really that much of a difference?</v>

2028
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:53.000
<v Speaker 4>And it maybe that was the idea like with</v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhoods that you would be living </v>

2029
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:53.000
<v Speaker 4>with people like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2030
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.040
<v Speaker 4>you're all going the same place for work</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everyone goes to same school and.</v>

2031
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:57.230
<v Speaker 4>But now your neighborhood is just full </v>
<v Speaker 4>of all.</v>

2032
01:35:57.460 --> 01:35:59.870
<v Speaker 4>Like it's such a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's such a transient time.</v>

2033
01:35:59.871 --> 01:36:01.160
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and also big houses,</v>

2034
01:36:01.161 --> 01:36:02.360
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2035
01:36:02.361 --> 01:36:07.361
<v Speaker 4>I'm in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have friends who they go out to eat </v>

2036
01:36:07.361 --> 01:36:10.991
<v Speaker 4>for most of their meals right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Houses are large and so they're forced </v>

2037
01:36:10.991 --> 01:36:12.020
<v Speaker 4>by lack of space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2038
01:36:12.021 --> 01:36:17.021
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of one of those space things </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you have to go out and commune </v>

2039
01:36:17.021 --> 01:36:21.431
<v Speaker 4>with other people and you have your </v>
<v Speaker 4>seven favorite places and then by </v>

2040
01:36:21.431 --> 01:36:21.900
<v Speaker 4>default those became.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come,</v>

2041
01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:24.770
<v Speaker 4>you're a little community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here you can.</v>

2042
01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:27.200
<v Speaker 4>You can sustain yourself entirely within</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

2043
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:29.870
<v Speaker 4>your house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your compound,</v>

2044
01:36:29.871 --> 01:36:33.050
<v Speaker 4>and it's just made it so we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to really interact with anyone anymore.</v>

2045
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:39.000
<v Speaker 3>That's a big thing with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like to be sustained and they like </v>

2046
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.150
<v Speaker 3>to have all of their stuff that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>need.</v>

2047
01:36:40.151 --> 01:36:40.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what.</v>

2048
01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:42.340
<v Speaker 3>That's the prepper instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2049
01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:47.400
<v Speaker 3>I've got enough food here for a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like everybody's got this idea that if </v>

2050
01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:47.470
<v Speaker 3>the shit goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be fine.</v>

2051
01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:51.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to just start piling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just have a gun turret on my roof,</v>

2052
01:36:51.161 --> 01:36:53.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I live in,</v>

2053
01:36:53.781 --> 01:36:57.580
<v Speaker 3>in New York City I think is the worst </v>
<v Speaker 3>case scenario because people like I have</v>

2054
01:36:57.581 --> 01:36:59.800
<v Speaker 3>a friend who lives in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't even put his golf clubs in his</v>

2055
01:36:59.801 --> 01:37:00.970
<v Speaker 3>apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got no room.</v>

2056
01:37:00.971 --> 01:37:05.971
<v Speaker 3>He used to put it all in storage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if he wants to play golf is to go to </v>

2057
01:37:05.971 --> 01:37:09.031
<v Speaker 3>the storage place and open up his little</v>
<v Speaker 3>spot with a key and go in and get as </v>

2058
01:37:09.281 --> 01:37:10.600
<v Speaker 3>junk and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2059
01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:13.510
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're living in a box.</v>

2060
01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:18.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My Post apocalypto is less about </v>

2061
01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:18.860
<v Speaker 4>hoarding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2062
01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:18.960
<v Speaker 4>like food or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It more about assembling a team.</v>

2063
01:37:19.230 --> 01:37:22.980
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm looking for skill sets because </v>
<v Speaker 4>a skill set you can take on the road and</v>

2064
01:37:23.130 --> 01:37:26.220
<v Speaker 4>produce something with that skill set </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is necessary.</v>

2065
01:37:26.221 --> 01:37:31.221
<v Speaker 4>So I don't really care how much what you</v>
<v Speaker 4>got in your garage or how much canned </v>

2066
01:37:31.221 --> 01:37:35.661
<v Speaker 4>food you have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I care about like show me how fast you </v>

2067
01:37:35.661 --> 01:37:35.661
<v Speaker 4>can clean a fish who can make medicine </v>
<v Speaker 4>on herbs.</v>

2068
01:37:35.661 --> 01:37:37.010
<v Speaker 4>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of more my.</v>

2069
01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:39.340
<v Speaker 4>That's those are the applications taking</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

2070
01:37:39.550 --> 01:37:41.360
<v Speaker 3>Sonata herbs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any medicine,</v>

2071
01:37:41.361 --> 01:37:43.880
<v Speaker 3>any good that you can make other herbs </v>
<v Speaker 3>you just laying around.</v>

2072
01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:45.140
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What have you ever made?</v>

2073
01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:47.570
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there are,</v>

2074
01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:49.300
<v Speaker 4>there's all sorts of things you can make</v>
<v Speaker 4>an artist.</v>

2075
01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:50.690
<v Speaker 4>Can you make a mud pack?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

2076
01:37:50.691 --> 01:37:55.691
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you know of the things that are in </v>

2077
01:37:55.691 --> 01:37:56.460
<v Speaker 4>nature that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can take?</v>

2078
01:37:56.461 --> 01:37:57.570
<v Speaker 4>What can you eat?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's edible?</v>

2079
01:37:58.870 --> 01:38:00.600
<v Speaker 4>Like basic stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

2080
01:38:00.601 --> 01:38:05.601
<v Speaker 4>What is out here that people have known </v>
<v Speaker 4>about for forever that no one knows </v>

2081
01:38:05.821 --> 01:38:06.960
<v Speaker 4>about anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how,</v>

2082
01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:12.040
<v Speaker 4>how much of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many Irish people started with the </v>

2083
01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:14.241
<v Speaker 4>potato famine because no one knew </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything about the plants that were </v>

2084
01:38:14.241 --> 01:38:14.850
<v Speaker 4>sitting right there that they could have</v>
<v Speaker 4>sustained themselves on the entire time.</v>

2085
01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:18.030
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eaten plenty of edible stuff.</v>

2086
01:38:18.090 --> 01:38:20.970
<v Speaker 4>They just didn't have the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they had always eaten beforehand.</v>

2087
01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:22.410
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2088
01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:27.740
<v Speaker 4>That seems like ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's plenty of food mass there to </v>

2089
01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:28.800
<v Speaker 4>eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if the skill set is gone,</v>

2090
01:38:28.801 --> 01:38:33.801
<v Speaker 4>then it's really easy to kill yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trying to figure it out for the first </v>

2091
01:38:33.801 --> 01:38:33.801
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2092
01:38:33.801 --> 01:38:36.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure you've seen survivor man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've seen that show less drought duck.</v>

2093
01:38:36.990 --> 01:38:41.990
<v Speaker 5>I opened my eyes for watching that show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Watching how easy it is to not get food </v>

2094
01:38:42.230 --> 01:38:43.240
<v Speaker 5>like you think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>

2095
01:38:43.241 --> 01:38:48.241
<v Speaker 5>The guys in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 5>plenty of stuff to eat out there and </v>

2096
01:38:48.241 --> 01:38:50.221
<v Speaker 5>they seemed like foraging for food and </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to figure out how to like kill a </v>

2097
01:38:50.221 --> 01:38:53.821
<v Speaker 5>squirrel with some sort of a rock that </v>
<v Speaker 5>drops a little thing that he hits the </v>

2098
01:38:53.821 --> 01:38:55.990
<v Speaker 5>switch and the rock falls on his head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2099
01:38:56.010 --> 01:38:57.730
<v Speaker 5>Not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't really work that well.</v>

2100
01:38:58.270 --> 01:39:03.270
<v Speaker 4>Who is that guy that John?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it John mcclane is the guy who went </v>

2101
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:04.570
<v Speaker 4>out in the woods and then died in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bus.</v>

2102
01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:09.960
<v Speaker 4>They made a movie out of it into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wild so that everyone's like the </v>

2103
01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:10.410
<v Speaker 4>hypothesizing about like his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2104
01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:11.410
<v Speaker 4>his death and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2105
01:39:11.411 --> 01:39:16.411
<v Speaker 4>he must've eaten this particular </v>
<v Speaker 4>planning got poisoned and all the wild </v>

2106
01:39:16.411 --> 01:39:17.050
<v Speaker 4>food experts aren't so he starved to </v>
<v Speaker 4>death.</v>

2107
01:39:17.110 --> 01:39:18.460
<v Speaker 4>It's very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He starved,</v>

2108
01:39:18.810 --> 01:39:21.670
<v Speaker 4>he starved himself to death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like one of the reasons humans have such</v>

2109
01:39:21.671 --> 01:39:26.671
<v Speaker 4>a long juvenile period compared to any </v>
<v Speaker 4>other primate is getting food is hard </v>

2110
01:39:27.131 --> 01:39:29.890
<v Speaker 4>and it takes a really long time to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>taught how to get it.</v>

2111
01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:33.730
<v Speaker 4>Like to have this information handed </v>
<v Speaker 4>down into to get the skill,</v>

2112
01:39:33.731 --> 01:39:38.731
<v Speaker 4>the muscle if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be able to do it and you expend so </v>

2113
01:39:38.731 --> 01:39:42.631
<v Speaker 4>much energy trying to get it that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to eat not only to cover that </v>

2114
01:39:42.631 --> 01:39:45.610
<v Speaker 4>energy but enough to go beyond beyond </v>
<v Speaker 4>that a little bit.</v>

2115
01:39:45.611 --> 01:39:46.690
<v Speaker 4>And then if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2116
01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:51.720
<v Speaker 4>making kids or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then there's all this extra stuff and </v>

2117
01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:53.050
<v Speaker 4>it's very hard and no one has ever done </v>
<v Speaker 4>it ever.</v>

2118
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:58.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We really got soft when it comes to </v>

2119
01:39:58.510 --> 01:40:00.751
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ability to feed yourself without a </v>

2120
01:40:00.751 --> 01:40:02.890
<v Speaker 5>supermarket.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very monumentally difficult task to</v>

2121
01:40:02.891 --> 01:40:07.891
<v Speaker 5>do for the average person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That movie really pissed me off because </v>

2122
01:40:07.891 --> 01:40:11.880
<v Speaker 5>they twisted the into the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They twisted the ending because in the </v>

2123
01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:14.740
<v Speaker 5>movie he eats a poisonous plant and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>gets sick and he dies.</v>

2124
01:40:14.741 --> 01:40:19.490
<v Speaker 5>He missed misidentified as the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>plant and his liver toxic and he dies.</v>

2125
01:40:19.491 --> 01:40:24.491
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the reality is he did starve to </v>

2126
01:40:24.491 --> 01:40:24.491
<v Speaker 5>death because it's fucking hard to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>food,</v>

2127
01:40:24.491 --> 01:40:28.710
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you've ever gone hunting like </v>

2128
01:40:28.710 --> 01:40:30.690
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that my friend Brian </v>

2129
01:40:30.690 --> 01:40:31.660
<v Speaker 5>Count and I first realized the first </v>
<v Speaker 5>hunting trip that we went on.</v>

2130
01:40:31.661 --> 01:40:36.661
<v Speaker 5>Lucky we went with this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Steve Rinella is his famous hunter and </v>

2131
01:40:36.661 --> 01:40:36.661
<v Speaker 5>we.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But we're like Jesus,</v>

2132
01:40:36.661 --> 01:40:38.830
<v Speaker 5>like how the fuck did they do this </v>
<v Speaker 5>before they had guns?</v>

2133
01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:44.240
<v Speaker 5>Like we have guns and it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have guns and scopes and binoculars </v>

2134
01:40:44.891 --> 01:40:48.880
<v Speaker 5>and a trained hunter and we know the </v>
<v Speaker 5>territory and we have,</v>

2135
01:40:49.210 --> 01:40:54.160
<v Speaker 5>we have a tags which like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they know there's in the area,</v>

2136
01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:58.690
<v Speaker 5>there's all these like things that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>on our side and it's still a fucking for</v>

2137
01:40:58.691 --> 01:41:02.080
<v Speaker 5>days with no success.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like if you didn't have food with</v>

2138
01:41:02.081 --> 01:41:04.660
<v Speaker 5>you and you were going on these days </v>
<v Speaker 5>with no success,</v>

2139
01:41:04.661 --> 01:41:08.020
<v Speaker 5>you would be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you would start.</v>

2140
01:41:08.050 --> 01:41:13.050
<v Speaker 5>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It could be really easy to starve to </v>

2141
01:41:13.050 --> 01:41:13.050
<v Speaker 5>death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like real.</v>

2142
01:41:13.050 --> 01:41:14.110
<v Speaker 5>That's with a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like with a gun.</v>

2143
01:41:14.111 --> 01:41:19.111
<v Speaker 5>It's easy to start without a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you hear about someone that's like </v>

2144
01:41:19.111 --> 01:41:20.950
<v Speaker 5>survived in the woods by themselves for </v>
<v Speaker 5>like 20 years,</v>

2145
01:41:20.951 --> 01:41:23.050
<v Speaker 5>like eating frogs and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You like what?</v>

2146
01:41:23.620 --> 01:41:25.830
<v Speaker 5>How did that guy do it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that?</v>

2147
01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:28.180
<v Speaker 5>To be like touch and go almost everyday.</v>

2148
01:41:28.510 --> 01:41:30.830
<v Speaker 5>Very few stockpiles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very.</v>

2149
01:41:30.910 --> 01:41:32.920
<v Speaker 5>Let me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much can you store?</v>

2150
01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:38.070
<v Speaker 5>You can only store like a couple days </v>
<v Speaker 5>worth of vegetables or plant matter </v>

2151
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:41.590
<v Speaker 5>before that starts to go bad meat </v>
<v Speaker 5>depending on the temperature.</v>

2152
01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:44.530
<v Speaker 5>Usually only good for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unless it's freezing cold out,</v>

2153
01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:49.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not good for more than a couple of </v>

2154
01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:50.050
<v Speaker 5>days like you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to constantly be on the move,</v>

2155
01:41:50.410 --> 01:41:55.410
<v Speaker 5>which is why cities weren't really </v>
<v Speaker 5>figured out until we figured out how </v>

2156
01:41:55.410 --> 01:41:55.960
<v Speaker 5>stockpile shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once they fail,</v>

2157
01:41:56.110 --> 01:41:58.270
<v Speaker 5>stockpile shit and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2158
01:41:58.271 --> 01:42:00.190
<v Speaker 5>we have a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a grain silo,</v>

2159
01:42:00.191 --> 01:42:01.420
<v Speaker 5>we have enough food for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2160
01:42:01.421 --> 01:42:04.870
<v Speaker 5>somebody should invent a way to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>music out of a box.</v>

2161
01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:06.070
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's make a piano.</v>

2162
01:42:06.110 --> 01:42:07.930
<v Speaker 2>Like all that much of free time on her </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>

2163
01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2164
01:42:09.671 --> 01:42:10.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

2165
01:42:10.270 --> 01:42:15.270
<v Speaker 2>That is the container container.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of container free life is kind </v>

2166
01:42:15.911 --> 01:42:17.440
<v Speaker 2>of like my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my goal,</v>

2167
01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:22.560
<v Speaker 5>but isn't it kind of a catch 22?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you need society and culture </v>

2168
01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:24.700
<v Speaker 5>in order to figure out how to make a </v>
<v Speaker 5>computer,</v>

2169
01:42:24.701 --> 01:42:27.310
<v Speaker 5>which allows you to learn about how to </v>
<v Speaker 5>live in the wild.</v>

2170
01:42:29.530 --> 01:42:31.030
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need,</v>

2171
01:42:31.390 --> 01:42:36.390
<v Speaker 5>you need education in order to figure </v>
<v Speaker 5>out what's going wrong with the human </v>

2172
01:42:36.791 --> 01:42:41.791
<v Speaker 5>body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by living in this sedentary lifestyle </v>

2173
01:42:41.791 --> 01:42:45.030
<v Speaker 5>that you have to go through this </v>
<v Speaker 5>sedentary lifestyle to get that </v>

2174
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:48.511
<v Speaker 5>education,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to figure out that it's not good for </v>

2175
01:42:48.511 --> 01:42:48.511
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2176
01:42:48.511 --> 01:42:48.511
<v Speaker 2>Well we've been in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2177
01:42:48.511 --> 01:42:52.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what I could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damien is like we're stockpiling </v>

2178
01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:53.660
<v Speaker 2>information right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now we've got to figure out a way to</v>

2179
01:42:53.661 --> 01:42:57.670
<v Speaker 2>distribute it so it requires a whole new</v>
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>

2180
01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:59.670
<v Speaker 2>Like that's part of what civilization is</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

2181
01:42:59.671 --> 01:43:04.671
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is someone knows something that you </v>

2182
01:43:04.671 --> 01:43:06.611
<v Speaker 2>don't know and that you might want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>know that you find valuable so you can </v>

2183
01:43:06.611 --> 01:43:07.970
<v Speaker 2>go do some of his work for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he'll tell you.</v>

2184
01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:12.130
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that ultimately the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the pattern that most people have chosen</v>

2185
01:43:12.131 --> 01:43:15.760
<v Speaker 5>this like nine to five in a box and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>still sat in the car drive,</v>

2186
01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:19.330
<v Speaker 5>is that going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you think will will realize somewhere</v>

2187
01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:24.600
<v Speaker 5>down the line that that likes smoking is</v>
<v Speaker 5>like really bad for you and we should </v>

2188
01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:28.831
<v Speaker 5>try to phase that out and try to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or do you think we're so caught up in </v>

2189
01:43:28.831 --> 01:43:29.590
<v Speaker 5>this idea of achievement and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and our,</v>

2190
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:34.750
<v Speaker 5>our momentum is so in that direction </v>
<v Speaker 5>that will never pull away from it?</v>

2191
01:43:35.170 --> 01:43:35.170
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2192
01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:36.600
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2193
01:43:36.690 --> 01:43:38.160
<v Speaker 2>I think that we will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2194
01:43:38.161 --> 01:43:39.200
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2195
01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:44.340
<v Speaker 2>like you with European countries playing</v>
<v Speaker 2>around with things like four day work </v>

2196
01:43:44.340 --> 01:43:45.160
<v Speaker 2>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2197
01:43:45.170 --> 01:43:47.790
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much work it doesn't take as much as</v>

2198
01:43:47.791 --> 01:43:52.791
<v Speaker 2>much time as you're going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're probably not working at some </v>

2199
01:43:52.791 --> 01:43:52.791
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone I</v>

2200
01:43:52.791 --> 01:43:56.980
<v Speaker 4>hope is going to stand up and say I </v>
<v Speaker 4>could do my job like in three hours a </v>

2201
01:43:56.980 --> 01:43:57.870
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think um,</v>

2202
01:43:57.920 --> 01:43:59.770
<v Speaker 4>as people are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2203
01:43:59.771 --> 01:44:01.040
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as businesses are laying off,</v>

2204
01:44:01.041 --> 01:44:03.500
<v Speaker 4>people are doing enforced furloughs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2205
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:08.530
<v Speaker 4>where they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you now have four days to get the </v>

2206
01:44:08.530 --> 01:44:10.580
<v Speaker 4>same job done and you're gonna have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>take a 20 percent pay cut.</v>

2207
01:44:10.581 --> 01:44:13.760
<v Speaker 4>I think people are accepting that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because now they get this extra day.</v>

2208
01:44:13.761 --> 01:44:16.070
<v Speaker 4>They're actually better for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might have less money,</v>

2209
01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:17.660
<v Speaker 4>but at home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2210
01:44:18.110 --> 01:44:23.110
<v Speaker 4>I think that if you've had some health </v>
<v Speaker 4>issues usually end up valuing your </v>

2211
01:44:23.110 --> 01:44:24.530
<v Speaker 4>health a little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always after,</v>

2212
01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:27.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if the up and comers will </v>
<v Speaker 4>see it that way,</v>

2213
01:44:27.530 --> 01:44:32.530
<v Speaker 4>but then for the up and comers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not a lot of jobs for those up </v>

2214
01:44:32.530 --> 01:44:33.260
<v Speaker 4>and comers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not even,</v>

2215
01:44:33.261 --> 01:44:37.310
<v Speaker 4>there's not even the option for nine to </v>
<v Speaker 4>five work for so many people now who did</v>

2216
01:44:37.311 --> 01:44:38.420
<v Speaker 4>what they were supposed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2217
01:44:38.421 --> 01:44:41.510
<v Speaker 4>when they went to school or whatever and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got a trade or a job,</v>

2218
01:44:41.511 --> 01:44:43.730
<v Speaker 4>like there's no place for them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then they're going,</v>

2219
01:44:43.731 --> 01:44:46.520
<v Speaker 4>well I'll go back to school and try to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get a better job.</v>

2220
01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:49.130
<v Speaker 4>So I think everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think everything we're to transition,</v>

2221
01:44:49.190 --> 01:44:54.190
<v Speaker 4>a lot of things are gonna change and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think the work day in general with the </v>

2222
01:44:54.190 --> 01:44:55.330
<v Speaker 4>commute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the like digital commute,</v>

2223
01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:59.180
<v Speaker 4>people being able to work from their </v>
<v Speaker 4>computers wherever they are.</v>

2224
01:44:59.181 --> 01:45:01.910
<v Speaker 4>Eventually corporations will see that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's cheaper.</v>

2225
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:04.820
<v Speaker 4>The cheaper for them to still make the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same products,</v>

2226
01:45:06.050 --> 01:45:08.240
<v Speaker 4>paying people less,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but people get more free time.</v>

2227
01:45:08.910 --> 01:45:13.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people are always going to want </v>

2228
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.910
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing.</v>

2229
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:14.100
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if you could tell someone,</v>

2230
01:45:14.101 --> 01:45:19.101
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do the same job for three hours a </v>

2231
01:45:19.101 --> 01:45:19.280
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will be like good.</v>

2232
01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:20.310
<v Speaker 3>That way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saved money.</v>

2233
01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:20.840
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2234
01:45:20.850 --> 01:45:23.430
<v Speaker 3>but we don't doing the same job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm doing the same job,</v>

2235
01:45:23.460 --> 01:45:25.200
<v Speaker 3>you're making the same amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2236
01:45:25.201 --> 01:45:27.750
<v Speaker 3>but you only working three hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight hours a day,</v>

2237
01:45:27.751 --> 01:45:32.751
<v Speaker 3>but I'm getting the same shit done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't really reward people sort </v>

2238
01:45:32.751 --> 01:45:33.350
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2239
01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:38.360
<v Speaker 3>some jobs do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most jobs it's about the amount of </v>

2240
01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:38.360
<v Speaker 3>hours you put in.</v>

2241
01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:42.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I think that that person know who </v>

2242
01:45:42.230 --> 01:45:42.420
<v Speaker 4>said I can do it in three hours a day is</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be replaced by someone who does</v>

2243
01:45:42.750 --> 01:45:47.750
<v Speaker 4>like you'll just keep working.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll find someone who can do the job </v>

2244
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:52.460
<v Speaker 4>faster and for less,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the only thing keeping people who </v>

2245
01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:55.770
<v Speaker 4>don't do that in their seats is a maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>the law at a certain point.</v>

2246
01:45:55.771 --> 01:46:00.771
<v Speaker 4>Like if who you can fire and who you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't fire if people are tenured or or </v>

2247
01:46:00.771 --> 01:46:02.550
<v Speaker 4>whatever that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hasn't that been the transition for like</v>

2248
01:46:02.551 --> 01:46:07.551
<v Speaker 4>the last 30 or 40 years where you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>just paying people less relatively </v>

2249
01:46:07.551 --> 01:46:07.860
<v Speaker 4>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2250
01:46:07.861 --> 01:46:09.960
<v Speaker 4>the dollar is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is different than what it was,</v>

2251
01:46:09.961 --> 01:46:12.030
<v Speaker 4>but aren't we paying people less who are</v>
<v Speaker 4>working?</v>

2252
01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:17.120
<v Speaker 4>Wait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like who doesn't work like seven days a </v>

2253
01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:19.551
<v Speaker 4>week who goes home and doesn't still </v>
<v Speaker 4>have their email on and still answering </v>

2254
01:46:19.551 --> 01:46:20.760
<v Speaker 4>emails.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that they're getting.</v>

2255
01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:24.930
<v Speaker 4>I think that they're getting a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 4>work out of people for what they used to</v>

2256
01:46:24.931 --> 01:46:26.820
<v Speaker 4>pay and that the fact they are paying </v>
<v Speaker 4>people less.</v>

2257
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:32.030
<v Speaker 3>That is an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who has an issue with </v>

2258
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:34.050
<v Speaker 3>his work because once he's done working </v>
<v Speaker 3>he will not answer emails.</v>

2259
01:46:34.590 --> 01:46:35.790
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm done,</v>

2260
01:46:35.850 --> 01:46:40.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm done and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's successful enough so that you can </v>

2261
01:46:40.850 --> 01:46:44.151
<v Speaker 3>kind of pull this off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a real issue that we were </v>

2262
01:46:44.151 --> 01:46:44.151
<v Speaker 3>trying to reach you all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2263
01:46:44.151 --> 01:46:45.000
<v Speaker 3>I was done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm done working.</v>

2264
01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:50.240

01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:12.360
<v Speaker 4>not having everyone at the same desk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like going into the same desk every</v>

2299
01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:16.730
<v Speaker 4>single day is an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an environmental killer.</v>

2300
01:48:16.731 --> 01:48:19.160
<v Speaker 4>Like you're looking at the same wall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're looking in the same.</v>

<v Speaker 6>More thing I put here about the things </v>

2303
01:48:28.931 --> 01:48:30.270
<v Speaker 6>like you just are just so attached to </v>
<v Speaker 6>their people working.</v>

2305
01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:35.320
<v Speaker 6>shit?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Know,</v>

2306
01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:35.400
<v Speaker 6>like the thing at the end of the week </v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to get that purse.</v>

2307
01:48:35.401 --> 01:48:38.900
<v Speaker 6>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That watch I've got my eye on you.</v>

2308
01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:41.280
<v Speaker 6>That's what keeps you going.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Otherwise I'm like,</v>

2309
01:48:41.281 --> 01:48:43.290
<v Speaker 6>why the fuck am I doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Especially jobs,</v>

2310
01:48:43.291 --> 01:48:45.570
<v Speaker 6>they don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Rewards are critical.</v>

2311
01:48:46.830 --> 01:48:47.100
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2312
01:48:47.210 --> 01:48:52.210
<v Speaker 4>But then it turns out that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>even like the reward that much because </v>

2313
01:48:52.210 --> 01:48:52.400
<v Speaker 4>it's just onto the next reward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do we fix this?</v>

2314
01:48:52.401 --> 01:48:56.050
<v Speaker 4>Can I have a community that I am taking </v>
<v Speaker 4>up?</v>

<v Speaker 6>Take applications for you.</v>

2318
01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:03.350
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2319
01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:06.250
<v Speaker 4>I have applications or for my poke post </v>
<v Speaker 4>apocalypto team,</v>

2320

<v Speaker 4>really banking on that.</v>

2321
01:49:08.830 --> 01:49:10.030
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what it is.</v>

2322
01:49:10.031 --> 01:49:11.830
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really feel like I,</v>

2323
01:49:11.950 --> 01:49:13.690
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like with shoes,</v>

2324
01:49:13.700 --> 01:49:15.970
<v Speaker 4>I wear regular shoes my whole entire </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

2325
01:49:15.971 --> 01:49:20.971
<v Speaker 4>And then you switched to something </v>
<v Speaker 4>minimal and you didn't even know how </v>

2326
01:49:20.971 --> 01:49:20.971
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how your feet were feeling all day long.</v>

2327
01:49:20.971 --> 01:49:25.861
<v Speaker 4>It's very hard to sense how something is</v>
<v Speaker 4>limiting you until you take yourself out</v>

2328
01:49:27.581 --> 01:49:28.960
<v Speaker 4>and away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like going camping.</v>

2329
01:49:28.961 --> 01:49:32.500
<v Speaker 4>Like everyone feels better when they go </v>
<v Speaker 4>camping and they're out hiking.</v>

2330
01:49:32.501 --> 01:49:33.670

<v Speaker 4>whatever it is.</v>

2334
01:49:40.331 --> 01:49:43.570
<v Speaker 4>When you go outside and you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all of a sudden it's different.</v>

<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2340
01:49:56.741 --> 01:50:01.390
<v Speaker 4>I can feel this chair right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't sat in a chair continuously in</v>

2341
01:50:01.391 --> 01:50:04.870
<v Speaker 4>probably two years.</v>

2363
01:51:02.500 --> 01:51:07.500
<v Speaker 4>shape that I wanted and the strength </v>

2379
01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:53.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you just move around in different </v>

2380
01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:55.240
<v Speaker 4>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing completely sedentary or static.</v>

2381
01:51:55.510 --> 01:52:00.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's because I don't think that </v>

2382
01:52:00.510 --> 01:52:00.510
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2383
01:52:00.510 --> 01:52:03.271
<v Speaker 4>we say we're too sedentary and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that you have too much </v>

2384
01:52:03.271 --> 01:52:04.750
<v Speaker 4>repetitive geometry which are different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is different,</v>

2385
01:52:04.751 --> 01:52:09.751
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like you got to get out of your </v>

2386
01:52:09.751 --> 01:52:11.071
<v Speaker 4>couch and exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say maybe you just get out of </v>

2387
01:52:11.071 --> 01:52:11.071
<v Speaker 4>your couch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you keep watching Netflix.</v>

2388
01:52:11.071 --> 01:52:15.540
<v Speaker 4>Just sit cross legged on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just put your legs out in front of you </v>

2389
01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:16.030
<v Speaker 4>because that is movement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is exercise.</v>

2390
01:52:16.031 --> 01:52:18.940
<v Speaker 4>It's just not in a special clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In a class,</v>

2391
01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:24.000
<v Speaker 4>in a gym.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go over my friend's house and they </v>

2392
01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:24.000
<v Speaker 4>have chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2393
01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.230
<v Speaker 4>my kids freaks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2394
01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:30.300
<v Speaker 4>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're a little freaky for everyone </v>

2395
01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:30.300
<v Speaker 4>else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they are now.</v>

2396
01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:32.980
<v Speaker 4>They've never been sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never been sick.</v>

2397
01:52:33.010 --> 01:52:34.140
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>

2398
01:52:34.610 --> 01:52:36.700
<v Speaker 4>Got Alien Kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't bring them anywhere.</v>

2399
01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:42.400
<v Speaker 4>Travel all over the world because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are a filtration system and movement is </v>

2400
01:52:43.991 --> 01:52:45.800
<v Speaker 4>your biggest changer</v>

2401
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:51.250
<v Speaker 2>and most people don't move at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're too busy trying to figure out </v>

2402
01:52:51.250 --> 01:52:52.040
<v Speaker 2>how to not be stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stick with these clogged up filters like</v>

2403
01:52:52.041 --> 01:52:54.530
<v Speaker 2>your whole lymphatic system depends on </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

2404
01:52:54.531 --> 01:52:59.531
<v Speaker 2>A function like the biggest physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement portion of your immune system </v>

2405
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:02.720
<v Speaker 2>depends on movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have its own pump.</v>

2406
01:53:02.930 --> 01:53:03.800
<v Speaker 2>It uses the muscular.</v>

2407
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:09.870
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like your immune system relies on </v>

2408
01:53:09.870 --> 01:53:09.870
<v Speaker 4>movement.</v>

2409
01:53:09.870 --> 01:53:10.620
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your lymphatic system,</v>

2410
01:53:10.621 --> 01:53:11.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

2411
01:53:11.650 --> 01:53:16.650
<v Speaker 2>that's what's taking your cellular waste</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then moving it out of your body.</v>

2412
01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:22.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's laying right next to your arterial </v>

2413
01:53:22.921 --> 01:53:25.800
<v Speaker 2>and venous system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as muscles work,</v>

2414
01:53:25.801 --> 01:53:30.801
<v Speaker 2>they pump the blood over to the working </v>
<v Speaker 2>tissues and then it kind of washes </v>

2415
01:53:30.801 --> 01:53:35.271
<v Speaker 2>everything away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your lymphatic system doesn't need a </v>

2416
01:53:35.271 --> 01:53:36.390
<v Speaker 2>pump because why would it need a pump?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you not be moving?</v>

2417
01:53:36.391 --> 01:53:39.030
<v Speaker 2>Why would a human not be moving?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would an Orca not be swimming in the</v>

2418
01:53:39.031 --> 01:53:44.031
<v Speaker 2>ocean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because you have these parts of </v>

2419
01:53:44.031 --> 01:53:47.751
<v Speaker 2>your body that are movement dependent </v>
<v Speaker 2>because movement is something that </v>

2420
01:53:47.751 --> 01:53:50.670
<v Speaker 2>humans should be doing all of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only in recent times that,</v>

2421
01:53:51.630 --> 01:53:56.630
<v Speaker 2>that we haven't needed to move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then these systems that are movement </v>

2422
01:53:56.630 --> 01:53:56.630
<v Speaker 2>dependent is</v>

2423
01:53:56.630 --> 01:53:56.630
<v Speaker 4>Kinda fail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2424
01:53:56.630 --> 01:54:00.030
<v Speaker 4>But my kids get sick and my kids move a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot.</v>

2425
01:54:00.090 --> 01:54:02.670
<v Speaker 4>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do gymnastics classes,</v>

2426
01:54:02.850 --> 01:54:05.980
<v Speaker 4>exercise classes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're in school and they're doing,</v>

2427
01:54:05.981 --> 01:54:07.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2428
01:54:07.230 --> 01:54:08.790
<v Speaker 4>Are you kids going to school?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2429
01:54:09.340 --> 01:54:10.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I might.</v>

2430
01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:12.490
<v Speaker 2>My three and a half year ago</v>

2431
01:54:12.570 --> 01:54:14.760
<v Speaker 4>it started in preschool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's in a nature school,</v>

2432
01:54:14.761 --> 01:54:16.340
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's all outside nature.</v>

2433
01:54:16.350 --> 01:54:19.110
<v Speaker 4>School side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are freaks.</v>

2434
01:54:19.170 --> 01:54:21.900
<v Speaker 4>We're going deep here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does this mean in nature?</v>

2435
01:54:21.901 --> 01:54:22.990
<v Speaker 4>School school?</v>

2436
01:54:23.090 --> 01:54:27.080
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been around for like 15 years where</v>

2437
01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:28.970
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a building.</v>

2438
01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.590
<v Speaker 2>They do all their work outside.</v>

2439
01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:32.310
<v Speaker 4>They don't have a building.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2440
01:54:32.490 --> 01:54:34.800
<v Speaker 4>So what happens when it rains?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go to school,</v>

2441
01:54:35.070 --> 01:54:37.080
<v Speaker 4>go to school and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>humans.</v>

2442
01:54:37.090 --> 01:54:38.880
<v Speaker 4>And what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 4>People live in the woods.</v>

2443
01:54:38.970 --> 01:54:41.700
<v Speaker 4>So you just use an umbrella.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No read under a tent.</v>

2444
01:54:41.730 --> 01:54:42.360
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

2445
01:54:42.361 --> 01:54:47.361
<v Speaker 4>they're not doing that traditional kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of sitting and reading and working with </v>

2446
01:54:47.361 --> 01:54:50.990
<v Speaker 4>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're learning edibles and their </v>

2447
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000
<v Speaker 4>learning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're hiking and they're moving</v>

2448
01:54:51.001 --> 01:54:52.160
<v Speaker 4>and they're doing their math,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2449
01:54:52.180 --> 01:54:57.180
<v Speaker 4>buy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get this many branches and how to build </v>

2450
01:54:57.180 --> 01:54:59.151
<v Speaker 4>a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you teach the kids to be grizzly </v>

2451
01:54:59.151 --> 01:54:59.151
<v Speaker 4>Adams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kind of.</v>

2452
01:54:59.151 --> 01:55:01.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is fascinating.</v>

2453
01:55:01.070 --> 01:55:03.540
<v Speaker 4>How many kids go to your school with </v>
<v Speaker 4>your kids?</v>

2454
01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:05.940
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's 10,</v>

2455
01:55:06.030 --> 01:55:07.470
<v Speaker 4>12,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10,</v>

2456
01:55:07.471 --> 01:55:12.471
<v Speaker 4>12 woodsy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People that come down with like leaves </v>

2457
01:55:12.471 --> 01:55:13.070
<v Speaker 4>in their hair and not really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am the woods easiest.</v>

2458
01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:15.870
<v Speaker 4>You're the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the woods where they are not,</v>

2459
01:55:16.130 --> 01:55:21.130
<v Speaker 4>you're not very what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You seem totally normal to me I'm </v>

2460
01:55:21.130 --> 01:55:21.130
<v Speaker 4>totally almost normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2461
01:55:21.130 --> 01:55:21.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm totally normal.</v>

2462
01:55:21.430 --> 01:55:24.880
<v Speaker 2>I just like kids move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like movement.</v>

2463
01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:30.900
<v Speaker 2>There's movement and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise and they're two different </v>

2464
01:55:30.900 --> 01:55:33.900
<v Speaker 2>things and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like gymnastics and like taking these </v>

2465
01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:36.640
<v Speaker 2>movement classes is not the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement that I'm talking about,</v>

2466
01:55:36.641 --> 01:55:41.641
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like recess and stuff that that's a </v>

2467
01:55:41.641 --> 01:55:41.641
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2468
01:55:42.850 --> 01:55:43.940
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

2469
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:46.290
<v Speaker 4>my kids move all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

2470
01:55:46.291 --> 01:55:46.780
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2471
01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:48.570
<v Speaker 4>my kids when they're so they're active,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're kids.</v>

2472
01:55:48.571 --> 01:55:48.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2473
01:55:48.871 --> 01:55:53.871
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about like my kids will walk</v>
<v Speaker 4>two to three miles a day and they could </v>

2474
01:55:55.260 --> 01:55:58.080
<v Speaker 4>hang and climb and suspend themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2475
01:55:58.170 --> 01:56:02.130
<v Speaker 4>by the time they're one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they move more like monkeys.</v>

2476
01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:07.880
<v Speaker 4>They're very confident and strong and </v>
<v Speaker 4>capable because they've been put into </v>

2477
01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:09.810
<v Speaker 4>challenging environments and they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>never.</v>

2478
01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:13.700
<v Speaker 4>They don't have chairs or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They said no.</v>

2479
01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:16.080
<v Speaker 4>He goes eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We eat at a low table.</v>

2480
01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:19.750
<v Speaker 4>Sat on the floor with a low table.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Japanese style.</v>

2481
01:56:20.260 --> 01:56:25.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The bulk of the world doesn't have </v>

2482
01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:27.531
<v Speaker 4>furniture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it seems radical that I don't </v>

2483
01:56:27.531 --> 01:56:29.421
<v Speaker 4>have furniture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the bulk of humans right now on the </v>

2484
01:56:29.421 --> 01:56:29.421
<v Speaker 4>planet don't have furniture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you have furniture.</v>

2485
01:56:29.421 --> 01:56:30.360
<v Speaker 4>It's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your.</v>

2486
01:56:30.361 --> 01:56:33.840
<v Speaker 4>The weirdo also ruled the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2487
01:56:33.841 --> 01:56:34.440
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing.</v>

2488
01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:38.910
<v Speaker 4>That's true TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably couches.</v>

2489
01:56:39.250 --> 01:56:44.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you really do have no furniture in </v>

2490
01:56:44.611 --> 01:56:45.640
<v Speaker 4>your house?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2491
01:56:45.641 --> 01:56:47.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean I have to core,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

2492
01:56:47.101 --> 01:56:49.030
<v Speaker 4>I don't have couches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sleep.</v>

2493
01:56:49.290 --> 01:56:53.540
<v Speaker 4>We sleep on pads on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On the floor.</v>

2494
01:56:53.550 --> 01:56:54.720
<v Speaker 4>No pillows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pillows,</v>

2495
01:56:54.721 --> 01:56:56.370
<v Speaker 4>north your pillows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A cast.</v>

2496
01:56:56.371 --> 01:57:01.371
<v Speaker 4>Do you think your heads should be laid </v>
<v Speaker 4>out in front of you like that whole </v>

2497
01:57:01.371 --> 01:57:02.000
<v Speaker 4>entire time?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2498
01:57:02.010 --> 01:57:07.010
<v Speaker 4>You have a pillow underneath your head </v>
<v Speaker 4>between your shoulders and you sleep on </v>

2499
01:57:07.010 --> 01:57:07.010
<v Speaker 4>your back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I sleep.</v>

2500
01:57:07.010 --> 01:57:09.630
<v Speaker 4>I move constantly because it's never </v>
<v Speaker 4>really comfortable.</v>

2501
01:57:09.631 --> 01:57:12.840
<v Speaker 4>So in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that way,</v>

2502
01:57:12.870 --> 01:57:13.410
<v Speaker 4>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

2503
01:57:13.411 --> 01:57:15.540
<v Speaker 4>I move at night like just like any other</v>
<v Speaker 4>animal.</v>

2504
01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:21.980
<v Speaker 4>You're going going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going back to the roots I think for </v>

2505
01:57:22.681 --> 01:57:24.960
<v Speaker 4>disease and health yet is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's required.</v>

2506
01:57:25.230 --> 01:57:27.810
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever go on the road and staying </v>
<v Speaker 4>at a bed and go,</v>

2507
01:57:27.811 --> 01:57:29.220
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is awesome.</v>

2508
01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:34.340
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the couches Galore when I'm on </v>

2509
01:57:34.340 --> 01:57:36.891
<v Speaker 4>vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my husband had to like turn on the </v>

2510
01:57:36.891 --> 01:57:36.891
<v Speaker 4>television,</v>
<v Speaker 4>love it,</v>

2511
01:57:36.891 --> 01:57:38.460
<v Speaker 4>but it's like dessert,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dessert,</v>

2512
01:57:38.990 --> 01:57:41.340
<v Speaker 4>but we don't have this at home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just going to have this one.</v>

2513
01:57:41.341 --> 01:57:42.230
<v Speaker 4>We're on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2514
01:57:42.930 --> 01:57:44.880
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like any other sensible thing,</v>

2515
01:57:44.881 --> 01:57:47.520
<v Speaker 4>intake of sensible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there a way around it?</v>

2516
01:57:47.521 --> 01:57:52.521
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can you have a bed that's like semi </v>

2517
01:57:52.521 --> 01:57:52.521
<v Speaker 4>comfortable?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was Zero,</v>

2518
01:57:52.521 --> 01:57:53.640
<v Speaker 4>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a medium ground or middle ground?</v>

2519
01:57:53.641 --> 01:57:53.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2520
01:57:53.981 --> 01:57:56.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think it all just depends on </v>
<v Speaker 4>how your,</v>

2521
01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:01.650
<v Speaker 4>your state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm looking for really strong cells</v>

2522
01:58:01.651 --> 01:58:06.651
<v Speaker 4>had toe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so like it just comes from the loads </v>

2523
01:58:06.651 --> 01:58:08.760
<v Speaker 4>that you expose them to like your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you think of like what is the natural</v>

2524
01:58:08.761 --> 01:58:13.761
<v Speaker 4>environment for your body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you go to a massage therapist like </v>

2525
01:58:13.761 --> 01:58:13.860
<v Speaker 4>to push on you and give you pressure.</v>

2526
01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:17.460
<v Speaker 4>It's like because your input you are </v>
<v Speaker 4>missing.</v>

2527
01:58:17.461 --> 01:58:20.760
<v Speaker 4>Well I get it every night on the ground </v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm not missing.</v>

2528
01:58:21.390 --> 01:58:26.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm not missing all of that movement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in helping those tissues become </v>

2529
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:28.770
<v Speaker 4>unstuck because the floor does that for </v>
<v Speaker 4>you for free while you sleep.</v>

2530
01:58:29.260 --> 01:58:34.260
<v Speaker 4>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think that going and lying on the </v>

2531
01:58:34.260 --> 01:58:38.301
<v Speaker 4>ground on the floor is the equivalent to</v>
<v Speaker 4>going and getting like deep tissue </v>

2532
01:58:38.301 --> 01:58:38.400
<v Speaker 4>massage?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2533
01:58:38.540 --> 01:58:43.540
<v Speaker 4>well pressure wise it's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing.</v>

2534
01:58:43.601 --> 01:58:44.770
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pressure.</v>

2535
01:58:44.771 --> 01:58:46.930
<v Speaker 4>That's what makes sleeping on the floor </v>
<v Speaker 4>so uncomfortable.</v>

2536
01:58:46.931 --> 01:58:51.931
<v Speaker 4>I don't have ever gone camping and slept</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the ground and everyone's like </v>

2537
01:58:51.931 --> 01:58:52.630
<v Speaker 4>hurting the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you don't have the,</v>

2538
01:58:52.780 --> 01:58:54.820
<v Speaker 4>you don't have the strength really to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2539
01:58:54.821 --> 01:58:59.821
<v Speaker 4>You don't have the suppleness of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tissues and so you stiffen and react to </v>

2540
01:58:59.821 --> 01:59:03.511
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kind of like if someone pushes on you </v>

2541
01:59:03.511 --> 01:59:05.821
<v Speaker 4>really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like too deep at first you tense your </v>

2542
01:59:05.821 --> 01:59:08.221
<v Speaker 4>muscles in responsible with with time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way how you're probably imagining </v>

2543
01:59:09.311 --> 01:59:12.790
<v Speaker 4>sleeping on the ground feels is not how </v>
<v Speaker 4>it feels to me anymore.</v>

2544
01:59:12.850 --> 01:59:15.670
<v Speaker 4>It's how it felt to me at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not how it feels to me anymore.</v>

2545
01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:17.550
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've camped a bunch of times,</v>

2546
01:59:17.551 --> 01:59:20.070
<v Speaker 5>especially over the last couple years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have done several times,</v>

2547
01:59:20.550 --> 01:59:22.950
<v Speaker 5>five slash six days in a stretch and </v>
<v Speaker 5>sucks.</v>

2548
01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:28.100
<v Speaker 5>It's just not comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't feel like deep tissue </v>

2549
01:59:28.100 --> 01:59:28.570
<v Speaker 5>massage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the difference between massage,</v>

2550
01:59:28.571 --> 01:59:33.571
<v Speaker 5>especially sports massage is you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>needing out knots and different scar </v>

2551
01:59:34.201 --> 01:59:37.020
<v Speaker 5>tissue and blockages that have happened </v>
<v Speaker 5>from extreme,</v>

2552
01:59:37.050 --> 01:59:42.050
<v Speaker 5>from strenuous exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't see how laying on the </v>

2553
01:59:42.050 --> 01:59:42.050
<v Speaker 5>ground would do that.</v>

2554
01:59:42.050 --> 01:59:44.040
<v Speaker 4>Your jeep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your massage is targeted and in,</v>

2555
01:59:44.100 --> 01:59:48.380
<v Speaker 4>in local to whatever area someone is </v>
<v Speaker 4>applying it.</v>

2556
01:59:48.381 --> 01:59:53.381
<v Speaker 4>So in that way the sensations are </v>
<v Speaker 4>different because this is just kind of </v>

2557
01:59:53.381 --> 01:59:56.840
<v Speaker 4>whole body all at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but mechanically speaking it's the same.</v>

2558
01:59:57.380 --> 01:59:59.120
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pressure,</v>

2559
01:59:59.121 --> 02:00:04.121
<v Speaker 4>it's pressure being applied to tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something pushing on it and moving it </v>

2560
02:00:04.121 --> 02:00:08.651
<v Speaker 4>around and it's uncomfortable at first </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's such a large surface area </v>

2561
02:00:08.651 --> 02:00:13.601
<v Speaker 4>of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not you being comfortable </v>

2562
02:00:13.601 --> 02:00:13.601
<v Speaker 4>everywhere else and then someone working</v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

2563
02:00:13.601 --> 02:00:16.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three inches or seems like that's like a</v>

2564
02:00:16.961 --> 02:00:17.570
<v Speaker 4>mini.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2565
02:00:17.780 --> 02:00:21.890
<v Speaker 4>because it's hard because I mean heart </v>
<v Speaker 4>to hard is not natural either.</v>

2566
02:00:21.920 --> 02:00:22.820
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to sleep,</v>

2567
02:00:22.850 --> 02:00:25.820
<v Speaker 4>just imagine what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something soft.</v>

2568
02:00:25.821 --> 02:00:30.821
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You always be seeking something </v>

2569
02:00:30.821 --> 02:00:30.821
<v Speaker 4>comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just that you,</v>

2570
02:00:30.821 --> 02:00:33.910
<v Speaker 4>your bed is so comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What it does is it doesn't reveal your </v>

2571
02:00:33.910 --> 02:00:38.891
<v Speaker 4>discomfort,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you just assume one position again </v>

2572
02:00:38.891 --> 02:00:39.020
<v Speaker 4>the same geometry almost all night long.</v>

2573
02:00:39.710 --> 02:00:44.710
<v Speaker 4>So in that way your movement is less </v>
<v Speaker 4>where I moved much more during that </v>

2574
02:00:47.181 --> 02:00:52.181
<v Speaker 4>eight hours so that eight hours my cells</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a different experience than someone</v>

2575
02:00:52.431 --> 02:00:54.340
<v Speaker 4>who's sleeping in a bed and on a pillow </v>
<v Speaker 4>and.</v>

2576
02:00:54.420 --> 02:00:55.940
<v Speaker 4>And when I'm uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2577
02:00:55.980 --> 02:01:00.770
<v Speaker 4>I changed position,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is all the time it was at first.</v>

2578
02:01:00.771 --> 02:01:05.771
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But how long have you been doing this </v>

2579
02:01:05.771 --> 02:01:08.261
<v Speaker 4>for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been probably 18 months without a </v>

2580
02:01:08.841 --> 02:01:10.490
<v Speaker 4>bed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something smaller.</v>

2581
02:01:10.940 --> 02:01:15.940
<v Speaker 4>How long did it take to get used to?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It took me like a year to get rid of my </v>

2582
02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:20.201
<v Speaker 4>pillow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It took them a year to get rid of my </v>

2583
02:01:20.201 --> 02:01:20.201
<v Speaker 4>pillow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2584
02:01:20.201 --> 02:01:20.201
<v Speaker 4>Because it was tight through the neck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though I did,</v>

2585
02:01:20.201 --> 02:01:25.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the same neck mobilization and got </v>

2586
02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:27.101
<v Speaker 4>massage all of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The bulk of my day was doing the same </v>

2587
02:01:27.101 --> 02:01:29.030
<v Speaker 4>thing with how often do you have to turn</v>
<v Speaker 4>your head and look up or look down.</v>

2588
02:01:29.030 --> 02:01:33.680
<v Speaker 4>There's no need for actually using the </v>
<v Speaker 4>muscles of your neck anymore.</v>

2589
02:01:33.740 --> 02:01:34.700
<v Speaker 4>But finally I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2590
02:01:34.701 --> 02:01:37.610
<v Speaker 4>after doing the stretch I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where?</v>

2591
02:01:37.611 --> 02:01:40.670
<v Speaker 4>Why am I doing this stretch?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like where would this stretch happen?</v>

2592
02:01:41.180 --> 02:01:42.320
<v Speaker 4>Naturally it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2593
02:01:42.321 --> 02:01:44.360
<v Speaker 4>well if I was laying on my side curled </v>
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>

2594
02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:49.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at your dog or your cat </v>

2595
02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:49.400
<v Speaker 4>sleeping there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thirdly,</v>

2596
02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:51.530
<v Speaker 4>doing these weird positions and poses </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I found the literature on it in</v>

2597
02:01:52.140 --> 02:01:53.000
<v Speaker 4>the journal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2598
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:58.030
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we think that a lot of low back pain is </v>

2599
02:01:58.030 --> 02:01:58.030
<v Speaker 4>coming from these repetitive sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 4>positions on,</v>

2600
02:01:58.030 --> 02:02:00.170
<v Speaker 4>on beds and here's how all these humans </v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep.</v>

2601
02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:05.440
<v Speaker 4>Here's all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these other primates and other </v>

2602
02:02:05.440 --> 02:02:07.061
<v Speaker 4>animals sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There seems to be some weird way about </v>

2603
02:02:07.061 --> 02:02:10.151
<v Speaker 4>the way we sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I just cleaned up that environment </v>

2604
02:02:10.151 --> 02:02:12.800
<v Speaker 4>for myself about a hard mattress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could do a hard mattress if you have</v>

2605
02:02:12.801 --> 02:02:13.820
<v Speaker 4>a soft one now.</v>

2606
02:02:13.820 --> 02:02:17.000
<v Speaker 4>A hard one would give you more pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2607
02:02:17.001 --> 02:02:18.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's definitely gradual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2608
02:02:18.630 --> 02:02:23.630
<v Speaker 4>it's not with a pillow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took my pillow size and then over a </v>

2609
02:02:23.630 --> 02:02:27.430
<v Speaker 4>year just came down to a smaller and </v>
<v Speaker 4>smaller pillow and eventually tee shirt </v>

2610
02:02:27.430 --> 02:02:31.301
<v Speaker 4>until I didn't need it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And with the bed the bed was more </v>

2611
02:02:31.301 --> 02:02:34.301
<v Speaker 4>organic because we had little kids and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so it seems like you're never sleeping </v>

2612
02:02:34.301 --> 02:02:37.571
<v Speaker 4>in your own bed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like everyone's always moving around </v>

2613
02:02:37.571 --> 02:02:37.571
<v Speaker 4>beds and I slept in a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>mattress,</v>

2614
02:02:37.571 --> 02:02:37.910
<v Speaker 4>like this metric sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I was like,</v>

2615
02:02:37.911 --> 02:02:39.920
<v Speaker 4>that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's mattress.</v>

2616
02:02:40.250 --> 02:02:44.140
<v Speaker 4>My body should have enough give where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2617
02:02:44.141 --> 02:02:49.141
<v Speaker 4>a slightly different baby pressure isn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>stressing my body out and then that's </v>

2618
02:02:49.141 --> 02:02:51.140
<v Speaker 4>when I just started to explore this kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of stuff.</v>

2619
02:02:53.020 --> 02:02:58.020
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people that are doing this are </v>
<v Speaker 4>sleeping on the ground and having no </v>

2620
02:02:58.020 --> 02:02:59.070
<v Speaker 4>couches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think furniture free takes awhile.</v>

2621
02:02:59.150 --> 02:03:00.330
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to give up your couch </v>
<v Speaker 4>views.</v>

2622
02:03:00.331 --> 02:03:02.330
<v Speaker 4>Said how about just sitting on the floor</v>
<v Speaker 4>instead of it,</v>

2623
02:03:02.331 --> 02:03:07.331
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just with the sitting is the new </v>

2624
02:03:07.331 --> 02:03:10.031
<v Speaker 4>smoking stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing that that research </v>

2625
02:03:10.031 --> 02:03:12.371
<v Speaker 4>really showed is that you can be this </v>
<v Speaker 4>like really great exerciser or it was a </v>

2626
02:03:12.371 --> 02:03:16.331
<v Speaker 4>new category of sedentary active that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that all of the active than fittest </v>

2627
02:03:16.331 --> 02:03:18.500
<v Speaker 4>people within our culture are still </v>
<v Speaker 4>sedentary.</v>

2628
02:03:18.590 --> 02:03:20.780
<v Speaker 4>They're like moving like four percent of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the day.</v>

2629
02:03:21.140 --> 02:03:23.210
<v Speaker 4>And since your body again is movement </v>
<v Speaker 4>dependent,</v>

2630
02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:28.160
<v Speaker 4>their systems in the fittest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are like four percent better than</v>

2631
02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:33.400
<v Speaker 4>the people who don't move at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's like all this space to get </v>

2632
02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:35.240
<v Speaker 4>better physically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

2633
02:03:35.241 --> 02:03:40.241
<v Speaker 4>when I say better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really talking about basic </v>

2634
02:03:40.241 --> 02:03:40.850
<v Speaker 4>biological things like procreating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>digesting food.</v>

2635
02:03:40.851 --> 02:03:43.390
<v Speaker 4>Some people can't even go to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bathroom like their guts and their,</v>

2636
02:03:43.490 --> 02:03:48.230
<v Speaker 4>their bathroom doesn't work and these </v>
<v Speaker 4>are again basic human functions.</v>

2637
02:03:48.230 --> 02:03:53.230
<v Speaker 4>They can't sleep well and like they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not being like their humanness is </v>

2638
02:03:53.901 --> 02:03:56.420
<v Speaker 4>impaired in the same way that you would </v>
<v Speaker 4>see.</v>

2639
02:03:56.421 --> 02:03:57.710
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in zoo animals,</v>

2640
02:03:57.711 --> 02:04:00.740
<v Speaker 4>like just pacing and they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not on their bio.</v>

2641
02:04:00.741 --> 02:04:02.270
<v Speaker 4>Rhythms all messed up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I thought,</v>

2642
02:04:02.271 --> 02:04:04.610
<v Speaker 4>well I can get myself back on track.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need a couch.</v>

2643
02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:08.080
<v Speaker 4>It turned out to be better in all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>other things that we're talking about,</v>

2644
02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:11.290
<v Speaker 4>consumerism for our family and space </v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2645
02:04:11.291 --> 02:04:16.291
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm having little kids you know and </v>

2646
02:04:16.291 --> 02:04:16.550
<v Speaker 4>run around and less to clean and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>less.</v>

2647
02:04:16.580 --> 02:04:21.580
<v Speaker 4>It's just less minimal minimalism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which ends up being maximalism at for </v>

2648
02:04:22.260 --> 02:04:24.830
<v Speaker 4>your biology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2649
02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:27.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm still tripping out on the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 4>your kids don't get sick.</v>

2650
02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:29.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to figure out how that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>

2651
02:04:29.271 --> 02:04:34.271
<v Speaker 4>That little immune systems are subject </v>
<v Speaker 4>to so many different little bugs and </v>

2652
02:04:34.271 --> 02:04:34.520
<v Speaker 4>stuff when they're hanging out with </v>
<v Speaker 4>other little kids.</v>

2653
02:04:34.521 --> 02:04:39.521
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they just have the strength to push </v>

2654
02:04:39.521 --> 02:04:39.521
<v Speaker 4>it right through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it</v>

2655
02:04:39.521 --> 02:04:39.521
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that.</v>

2656
02:04:39.521 --> 02:04:41.160
<v Speaker 2>I think that with a lot of illness it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the delay,</v>

2657
02:04:41.161 --> 02:04:46.161
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're making the music as it </v>

2658
02:04:46.161 --> 02:04:48.321
<v Speaker 2>sits around for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just takes like what we envisioned </v>

2659
02:04:48.321 --> 02:04:50.190
<v Speaker 2>being sick is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the coping mechanism.</v>

2660
02:04:50.191 --> 02:04:55.191
<v Speaker 2>It's like a sluggish immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not that my kids don't interact </v>

2661
02:04:55.191 --> 02:04:55.680
<v Speaker 2>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just happens faster.</v>

2662
02:04:55.681 --> 02:04:56.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we,</v>

2663
02:04:56.730 --> 02:05:00.540
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we travel all over United States,</v>

2664
02:05:00.541 --> 02:05:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Canada and Europe for six weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They dust.</v>

2665
02:05:04.110 --> 02:05:06.390
<v Speaker 2>They're very robust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kids vaccinated?</v>

2666
02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:07.740
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not yet.</v>

2667
02:05:11.460 --> 02:05:14.580
<v Speaker 2>Not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an anti vaccine nation.</v>

2668
02:05:14.581 --> 02:05:15.330
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2669
02:05:15.331 --> 02:05:20.331
<v Speaker 2>I'm a have a particular timeline in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>development that I want them to explore </v>

2670
02:05:22.700 --> 02:05:25.740
<v Speaker 2>first and I don't want encroached with </v>
<v Speaker 2>any of that stuff.</v>

2671
02:05:25.741 --> 02:05:30.741
<v Speaker 2>And so I maximize lots of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2672
02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:38.480
<v Speaker 2>so like with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with I'm also an extended breast feeder </v>

2673
02:05:38.730 --> 02:05:42.000
<v Speaker 2>so like my children had been breastfed </v>
<v Speaker 2>for like the oldest one.</v>

2674
02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.950
<v Speaker 2>He stopped when he was three and a half </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2675
02:05:44.340 --> 02:05:48.030
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of people don't have that going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

2676
02:05:48.210 --> 02:05:48.970
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2677
02:05:48.990 --> 02:05:51.240
<v Speaker 2>with my younger one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's just too.</v>

2678
02:05:51.241 --> 02:05:56.241
<v Speaker 2>And so she's still breastfeeding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's lots of other things that I </v>

2679
02:05:56.241 --> 02:05:56.241
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really a,</v>

2680
02:05:56.241 --> 02:05:59.370
<v Speaker 2>don't do her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm more like here's all the things that</v>

2681
02:05:59.580 --> 02:06:04.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ended up improving their immune </v>

2682
02:06:04.580 --> 02:06:04.580
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2683
02:06:04.580 --> 02:06:08.991
<v Speaker 2>they play in dirt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've never been exposed to </v>

2684
02:06:08.991 --> 02:06:11.040
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics or anti bacterial products,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2685
02:06:11.041 --> 02:06:13.680
<v Speaker 2>things that now are showing up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>accumulate in the system.</v>

2686
02:06:13.681 --> 02:06:16.350
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that has a lot to do with it.</v>

2687
02:06:16.900 --> 02:06:21.900
<v Speaker 3>Do you have any issue or any worry or </v>
<v Speaker 3>concern about your kids catching measles</v>

2688
02:06:21.941 --> 02:06:26.941
<v Speaker 3>or mumps or one of these dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>diseases that have had a resurgence </v>

2689
02:06:26.941 --> 02:06:28.780
<v Speaker 3>because of a lack of vaccinations?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>

2690
02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:34.160
<v Speaker 3>that's a big issue in the east coast is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the measles and mumps and things along </v>

2691
02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:37.360
<v Speaker 3>those lines that used to be kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked down now because a lot of people</v>

2692
02:06:37.390 --> 02:06:41.290
<v Speaker 3>don't want to vaccinate their kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're seeing this make a resurgence.</v>

2693
02:06:41.380 --> 02:06:43.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I mean I wear,</v>

2694
02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:44.440
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not,</v>

2695
02:06:44.710 --> 02:06:49.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an anti vaccs like the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're really vaccinating is for </v>

2696
02:06:49.710 --> 02:06:53.011
<v Speaker 2>the benefit of weaker people for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most part because measles as a whole is </v>

2697
02:06:54.761 --> 02:06:59.761
<v Speaker 2>not something that is that dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are very few incidences </v>

2698
02:07:00.341 --> 02:07:04.990
<v Speaker 2>even when it was really bad that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would cause death or whatnot.</v>

2699
02:07:04.991 --> 02:07:08.860
<v Speaker 2>So there'll be vaccinated at a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>point for,</v>

2700
02:07:08.890 --> 02:07:13.890
<v Speaker 2>for the benefit of the community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just am not loading really their </v>

2701
02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:19.320
<v Speaker 2>systems with anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not particularly worried about </v>

2702
02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:23.131
<v Speaker 2>exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know they don't go to places where </v>

2703
02:07:23.131 --> 02:07:23.680
<v Speaker 2>measles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2704
02:07:23.800 --> 02:07:26.960
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where measles occurs.</v>

2705
02:07:26.961 --> 02:07:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Like they're not in doctor's offices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they travel all over the world.</v>

2706
02:07:30.401 --> 02:07:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Well they travel all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing.</v>

2707
02:07:32.291 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 2>But I mean as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as as I spend time</v>

2708
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:40.980
<v Speaker 4>detecting where like there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was someone who was exposed to </v>

2709
02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:43.570
<v Speaker 4>measles in Washington who came from </v>
<v Speaker 4>Disneyland.</v>

2710
02:07:43.670 --> 02:07:48.670
<v Speaker 4>So they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I got a notification saying this </v>

2711
02:07:48.670 --> 02:07:51.361
<v Speaker 4>person went from Disneyland to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Seatac airport who then went to this </v>

2712
02:07:51.361 --> 02:07:56.161
<v Speaker 4>place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you've been at any of these three </v>

2713
02:07:56.161 --> 02:07:56.161
<v Speaker 4>places,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is what our,</v>

2714
02:07:56.161 --> 02:07:59.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the government put out in local </v>

2715
02:07:59.400 --> 02:07:59.400
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was recently,</v>

2716
02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:00.270
<v Speaker 4>like in the last week and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2717
02:08:00.271 --> 02:08:01.120
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just got the,</v>

2718
02:08:01.210 --> 02:08:02.830
<v Speaker 4>I got it like in the last week and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>half.</v>

2719
02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.880
<v Speaker 4>So there are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are those cases.</v>

2720
02:08:06.881 --> 02:08:07.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2721
02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:10.430
<v Speaker 6>So you're not concerned with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's,</v>

2722
02:08:10.431 --> 02:08:11.920
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's interesting that we have these,</v>

2723
02:08:11.921 --> 02:08:16.921
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these ideas about what diseases we need </v>

2724
02:08:16.921 --> 02:08:17.950
<v Speaker 6>to be gravely concerned about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like measles is one,</v>

2725
02:08:18.310 --> 02:08:20.680
<v Speaker 6>chicken pox is another belly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2726
02:08:20.710 --> 02:08:22.900
<v Speaker 6>all the different ones that people are </v>
<v Speaker 6>terrified of,</v>

2727
02:08:23.260 --> 02:08:25.150
<v Speaker 6>the one that kills everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the flu,</v>

2728
02:08:25.460 --> 02:08:27.250
<v Speaker 6>the flu fucking kills the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

2729
02:08:27.251 --> 02:08:28.530
<v Speaker 6>There's so many people that die every </v>
<v Speaker 6>year,</v>

2730
02:08:28.570 --> 02:08:31.210
<v Speaker 6>the flu,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but most people don't get a flu shot.</v>

2731
02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:32.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shot.</v>

2732
02:08:32.990 --> 02:08:34.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2733
02:08:34.171 --> 02:08:34.980
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2734
02:08:35.910 --> 02:08:40.290
<v Speaker 4>from a biological standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we're looking at problems from,</v>

2735
02:08:40.470 --> 02:08:43.050
<v Speaker 4>we're all sick in this zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we don't see that.</v>

2736
02:08:43.051 --> 02:08:44.580
<v Speaker 4>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2737
02:08:45.150 --> 02:08:50.150
<v Speaker 4>the way that you are interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the disease has a lot to do with the </v>

2738
02:08:50.150 --> 02:08:51.090
<v Speaker 4>state of the being that you're bringing </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the disease.</v>

2739
02:08:51.091 --> 02:08:54.870
<v Speaker 4>So I'm working to maximize the state of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the being.</v>

2740
02:08:55.050 --> 02:08:57.660
<v Speaker 6>What about nutrition?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what kind of nutrition?</v>

2741
02:08:58.400 --> 02:08:59.250
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the same thing.</v>

2742
02:08:59.251 --> 02:09:00.200
<v Speaker 4>So my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>

2743
02:09:00.250 --> 02:09:05.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm much more scared by what other </v>

2744
02:09:05.250 --> 02:09:07.401
<v Speaker 4>people feed their family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think then I am about diseases that </v>

2745
02:09:07.591 --> 02:09:12.591
<v Speaker 4>they'll pick up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we don't really eat any processed </v>

2746
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:17.870
<v Speaker 4>food on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mostly I think for the first couple of </v>

2747
02:09:17.870 --> 02:09:22.481
<v Speaker 4>years of their life they had exclusively</v>
<v Speaker 4>proteins and vegetables exclusively.</v>

2748
02:09:24.180 --> 02:09:27.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they never had a goldfish cracker,</v>

2749
02:09:27.270 --> 02:09:30.180
<v Speaker 4>let me know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are swallowing a live fish.</v>

2750
02:09:30.270 --> 02:09:31.590
<v Speaker 4>I've been talking about the goldfish </v>
<v Speaker 4>cracker.</v>

2751
02:09:31.591 --> 02:09:34.590
<v Speaker 4>They never had a cheerios or goldfish </v>
<v Speaker 4>crackers or any of that kind of stuff.</v>

2752
02:09:34.591 --> 02:09:35.400
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2753
02:09:35.401 --> 02:09:36.780
<v Speaker 4>like we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I make cookies,</v>

2754
02:09:36.781 --> 02:09:38.390
<v Speaker 4>I make desserts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have sweets and,</v>

2755
02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:42.060
<v Speaker 4>and I'm more lenient now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like in that first hunk of time,</v>

2756
02:09:42.061 --> 02:09:42.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they're,</v>

2757
02:09:42.780 --> 02:09:45.330
<v Speaker 4>when they're developing so much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2758
02:09:45.331 --> 02:09:50.331
<v Speaker 4>like they had popsicles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they're regular kids you wouldn't </v>

2759
02:09:50.331 --> 02:09:51.000
<v Speaker 4>even know because I want them to fit.</v>

2760
02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.880
<v Speaker 4>I want us all to fit in society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As weird as my life sounds.</v>

2761
02:09:53.881 --> 02:09:58.881
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't even really know it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We throw great parties at our house and </v>

2762
02:09:58.881 --> 02:10:01.170
<v Speaker 4>every house has just decorated kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like Moroccan style.</v>

2763
02:10:01.290 --> 02:10:04.440
<v Speaker 4>It just looks like wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a lot of cool floor pillows or</v>

2764
02:10:04.441 --> 02:10:05.070
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole.</v>

2765
02:10:05.071 --> 02:10:06.600
<v Speaker 4>It's not just like you walk into a house</v>
<v Speaker 4>going,</v>

2766
02:10:06.601 --> 02:10:08.100
<v Speaker 4>where's all the furniture?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is weird.</v>

2767
02:10:08.460 --> 02:10:10.540
<v Speaker 4>It's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

2768
02:10:10.910 --> 02:10:13.800
<v Speaker 4>it's just slightly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just this kind of our,</v>

2769
02:10:13.860 --> 02:10:18.860
<v Speaker 4>our odd are oddness and we are the only </v>
<v Speaker 4>friends in our group that are like this,</v>

2770
02:10:20.310 --> 02:10:25.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so to them we're kind of frigates like </v>

2771
02:10:25.310 --> 02:10:25.310
<v Speaker 4>no one likes the desserts that I make </v>
<v Speaker 4>for kids,</v>

2772
02:10:25.310 --> 02:10:28.020
<v Speaker 4>birthday parties or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that all being said,</v>

2773
02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:30.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's kids are like,</v>

2774
02:10:30.421 --> 02:10:30.810
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2775
02:10:30.811 --> 02:10:32.690
<v Speaker 4>there are kids are melting down because </v>
<v Speaker 4>of Xyz.</v>

2776
02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:34.400
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2777
02:10:34.850 --> 02:10:36.040
<v Speaker 4>but our kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't have that.</v>

2778
02:10:36.041 --> 02:10:37.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean they have kid meltdowns or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

2779
02:10:37.671 --> 02:10:40.220
<v Speaker 4>but they just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just sleep regularly.</v>

2780
02:10:40.221 --> 02:10:41.090
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're healthy,</v>

2781
02:10:41.091 --> 02:10:41.810
<v Speaker 4>they're pretty healthy.</v>

2782
02:10:42.300 --> 02:10:47.300
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it sounds the sound ridiculously </v>

2783
02:10:47.300 --> 02:10:47.300
<v Speaker 6>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're healthy.</v>

2784
02:10:47.300 --> 02:10:48.240
<v Speaker 6>They've never been sick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

2785
02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:53.300
<v Speaker 6>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've never heard of anything like that </v>

2786
02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:53.300
<v Speaker 6>before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's really shocking to me.</v>

2787
02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:57.410
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought that that was just like a </v>

2788
02:10:57.410 --> 02:10:57.410
<v Speaker 6>natural part of being a child to gets </v>
<v Speaker 6>sick.</v>

2789
02:10:57.410 --> 02:10:57.730
<v Speaker 6>Your immune system rebounds and </v>
<v Speaker 6>strengthens.</v>

2790
02:10:57.731 --> 02:11:00.550
<v Speaker 6>It is actually good to expose your sick </v>
<v Speaker 6>kids.</v>

2791
02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:01.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we don't,</v>

2792
02:11:01.970 --> 02:11:06.970
<v Speaker 4>we don't keep them away from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't keep them away from sick </v>

2793
02:11:06.970 --> 02:11:06.970
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just,</v>

2794
02:11:06.970 --> 02:11:07.910
<v Speaker 4>if they get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

2795
02:11:07.911 --> 02:11:11.060
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't look like what getting sick </v>
<v Speaker 4>would look like.</v>

2796
02:11:11.061 --> 02:11:16.061
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're still interacting with any </v>

2797
02:11:16.061 --> 02:11:16.061
<v Speaker 4>pathogens and they're responding to it.</v>

2798
02:11:16.061 --> 02:11:16.530
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I see what you're saying.</v>

2799
02:11:16.531 --> 02:11:17.660
<v Speaker 6>So if they get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2800
02:11:17.661 --> 02:11:22.661
<v Speaker 6>it's a minor thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you wouldn't even the processes and </v>

2801
02:11:22.661 --> 02:11:22.661
<v Speaker 6>you don't even know.</v>

2802
02:11:22.661 --> 02:11:22.661
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't even know that there's,</v>

2803
02:11:22.661 --> 02:11:24.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't even know that they're sick</v>

2804
02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:28.340
<v Speaker 6>because it never,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they never get to an overload points.</v>

2805
02:11:28.810 --> 02:11:30.130
<v Speaker 4>What is sick?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is sick?</v>

2806
02:11:30.131 --> 02:11:32.260
<v Speaker 4>Like sick to me is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2807
02:11:32.261 --> 02:11:34.660
<v Speaker 4>I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my son had,</v>

2808
02:11:35.290 --> 02:11:40.290
<v Speaker 4>he just had his second fever and almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>four in four years and there was no </v>

2809
02:11:41.001 --> 02:11:46.001
<v Speaker 4>overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well he just went to bed with a fever </v>

2810
02:11:46.001 --> 02:11:46.910
<v Speaker 4>and he woke up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if so,</v>

2811
02:11:46.911 --> 02:11:48.920
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for me like sick is like they've been</v>

2812
02:11:48.921 --> 02:11:50.780
<v Speaker 4>to the doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've taken a medication.</v>

2813
02:11:51.980 --> 02:11:52.890
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what you're saying,</v>

2814
02:11:53.270 --> 02:11:56.540
<v Speaker 6>so you think sick is he needs medical </v>
<v Speaker 6>attention?</v>

2815
02:11:56.890 --> 02:11:58.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or you know how to,</v>

2816
02:11:58.700 --> 02:12:01.430
<v Speaker 4>how to stay home from school or had you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2817
02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:04.570
<v Speaker 4>something running down out of his nose </v>
<v Speaker 4>or whatever.</v>

2818
02:12:04.810 --> 02:12:06.880
<v Speaker 4>Like to me like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the fever,</v>

2819
02:12:06.881 --> 02:12:11.140
<v Speaker 4>that fever that he had was like he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>just hot and then it was just gone.</v>

2820
02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:13.060
<v Speaker 4>So you slept it up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2821
02:12:13.061 --> 02:12:15.430
<v Speaker 4>Well I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess I guess I compare it to myself.</v>

2822
02:12:15.431 --> 02:12:17.690
<v Speaker 4>Like I was at the pediatrician's office </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot as a kid.</v>

2823
02:12:17.691 --> 02:12:22.691
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember taking antibiotics once a </v>

2824
02:12:22.691 --> 02:12:23.950
<v Speaker 4>quarter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a lot.</v>

2825
02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:28.270
<v Speaker 6>And do you find yourself sick less as </v>
<v Speaker 6>well?</v>

2826
02:12:28.330 --> 02:12:33.330
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean all of us as a family that's so </v>

2827
02:12:33.330 --> 02:12:36.211
<v Speaker 6>unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All my friends that have young children </v>

2828
02:12:36.211 --> 02:12:38.820
<v Speaker 6>around my kids' age work,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everyone's battling colds all the time </v>

2829
02:12:38.820 --> 02:12:38.820
<v Speaker 6>because your kid's a little petri </v>
<v Speaker 6>dishes.</v>

2830
02:12:38.820 --> 02:12:39.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the same thing.</v>

2831
02:12:39.371 --> 02:12:41.140
<v Speaker 4>So I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just thought the same thing.</v>

2832
02:12:41.141 --> 02:12:45.490
<v Speaker 4>Like I compared to our group of families</v>
<v Speaker 4>who all have little kids,</v>

2833
02:12:46.300 --> 02:12:49.390
<v Speaker 4>I would say that they're sick a lot and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so I,</v>

2834
02:12:49.391 --> 02:12:50.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like this person is sick,</v>

2835
02:12:50.471 --> 02:12:51.790
<v Speaker 4>this person sick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this person sick.</v>

2836
02:12:51.791 --> 02:12:53.620
<v Speaker 4>And we always just go to the party.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like whatever.</v>

2837
02:12:53.621 --> 02:12:54.630
<v Speaker 4>Because I want my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

2838
02:12:55.330 --> 02:12:57.970
<v Speaker 4>I know that they get healthier through </v>
<v Speaker 4>interacting with it,</v>

2839
02:12:57.971 --> 02:13:02.750
<v Speaker 4>but I just had my first cold in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2840
02:13:02.751 --> 02:13:06.050
<v Speaker 4>like two years maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

2841
02:13:06.090 --> 02:13:09.370
<v Speaker 4>and I've had kids for almost four.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what is your diet like?</v>

2842
02:13:09.371 --> 02:13:11.050
<v Speaker 4>Like what do you eat?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same thing as a kid.</v>

2843
02:13:11.051 --> 02:13:14.770
<v Speaker 4>A lot of fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of protein engineered.</v>

2844
02:13:15.730 --> 02:13:17.500
<v Speaker 4>That's on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's on purpose.</v>

2845
02:13:17.501 --> 02:13:17.790
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2846
02:13:17.791 --> 02:13:22.791
<v Speaker 4>I try not to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It turned out to eat a lot of processed </v>

2847
02:13:22.791 --> 02:13:25.510
<v Speaker 4>foods and then a lot of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't do a lot of bread.</v>

2848
02:13:25.780 --> 02:13:28.300
<v Speaker 4>You don't need a lot of bread,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're not totally green free.</v>

2849
02:13:28.301 --> 02:13:30.520
<v Speaker 4>Like I like Amaris,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2852
02:13:36.391 --> 02:13:38.730
<v Speaker 4>which is an Ethiopian grain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just,</v>

2853
02:13:39.120 --> 02:13:41.130
<v Speaker 4>they're just freak food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is this talk?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Wonder.</v>

2856
02:13:44.690 --> 02:13:46.660
<v Speaker 4>No wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in</v>

2857
02:13:46.661 --> 02:13:49.320
<v Speaker 4>your house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have our version.</v>

2858
02:13:50.010 --> 02:13:50.940
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

2859
02:13:50.970 --> 02:13:53.130
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

2860
02:13:53.250 --> 02:13:55.170
<v Speaker 4>Good Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really weird.</v>

2861
02:13:55.470 --> 02:13:56.910
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>real weird.</v>

2862
02:13:57.300 --> 02:14:02.300
<v Speaker 6>Then we take your kids to Disneyland.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They see soda and popcorn and shit like </v>

2863
02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:02.300
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They freak out.</v>

2864
02:14:03.170 --> 02:14:05.750
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they freak out about food in packages.</v>

2865
02:14:05.751 --> 02:14:10.751
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems to be the packaging more than </v>

2866
02:14:10.751 --> 02:14:12.611
<v Speaker 4>anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what does that thing with the knob </v>

2867
02:14:12.611 --> 02:14:12.611
<v Speaker 4>that they have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2868
02:14:12.611 --> 02:14:13.550
<v Speaker 4>like the other kids have that and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>let them,</v>

2869
02:14:13.551 --> 02:14:14.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if we're going,</v>

2870
02:14:14.361 --> 02:14:15.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2871
02:14:15.171 --> 02:14:16.160
<v Speaker 4>you can't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2872
02:14:16.161 --> 02:14:17.840
<v Speaker 4>if someone's handing out something to </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>

2873
02:14:17.841 --> 02:14:19.010
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course you know,</v>

2874
02:14:19.011 --> 02:14:19.940
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a kid.</v>

2875
02:14:19.941 --> 02:14:21.800
<v Speaker 4>This is your community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is your time.</v>

2876
02:14:22.130 --> 02:14:26.350
<v Speaker 4>But I don't go out of my way to make it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to put it in there</v>

2877
02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:28.240
<v Speaker 6>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember when I was a kid,</v>

2878
02:14:28.241 --> 02:14:30.730
<v Speaker 6>TV dinners had a very special appeal to </v>
<v Speaker 6>me.</v>

2879
02:14:30.820 --> 02:14:32.380
<v Speaker 6>Like there's something about the TV </v>
<v Speaker 6>dinner,</v>

2880
02:14:32.381 --> 02:14:37.381
<v Speaker 6>like all of it in that little tray,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the little potatoes or like molded </v>

2881
02:14:37.381 --> 02:14:42.150
<v Speaker 6>to the little tiny little spot where the</v>
<v Speaker 6>potatoes go and the Brownie was baked </v>

2882
02:14:42.150 --> 02:14:44.320
<v Speaker 6>right in it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember Barry Steak with the stuff on</v>

2883
02:14:44.321 --> 02:14:45.940
<v Speaker 6>the meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you had to eat that now,</v>

2884
02:14:45.941 --> 02:14:47.230
<v Speaker 6>he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Christ,</v>

2885
02:14:47.231 --> 02:14:48.520
<v Speaker 6>what am I putting in my body?</v>

2886
02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:50.650
<v Speaker 4>Kenna was so one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all those foods.</v>

2887
02:14:50.651 --> 02:14:55.651
<v Speaker 4>I look at all the foods and all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sitcoms that I watched as a TV and it's </v>

2888
02:14:55.651 --> 02:14:55.651
<v Speaker 4>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2889
02:14:55.651 --> 02:14:58.000
<v Speaker 4>as a parent you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>am I going too far with this?</v>

2890
02:14:58.001 --> 02:14:59.590
<v Speaker 4>A little bit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do I want my kids,</v>

2891
02:14:59.591 --> 02:15:01.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have,</v>

2892
02:15:02.110 --> 02:15:05.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really liked my childhood.</v>

2893
02:15:05.411 --> 02:15:10.411
<v Speaker 4>My childhood was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only thing that I was just playing </v>

2894
02:15:10.411 --> 02:15:13.880
<v Speaker 4>with here is biological function because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I,</v>

2895
02:15:13.890 --> 02:15:18.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the difference between our kids and Oz </v>

2896
02:15:18.890 --> 02:15:21.730
<v Speaker 4>is that we grew up in a different time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there were no computers.</v>

2897
02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:27.070
<v Speaker 4>Like I didn't really sit down in front </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a computer until I was maybe 20.</v>

2898
02:15:27.450 --> 02:15:29.050
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a typewriter and you know,</v>

2899
02:15:29.051 --> 02:15:32.620
<v Speaker 4>I took typing in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you were running around,</v>

2900
02:15:32.690 --> 02:15:34.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after school for the most part.</v>

2901
02:15:34.571 --> 02:15:36.370
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now you know,</v>

2902
02:15:36.371 --> 02:15:38.380
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my one year old had my iphone.</v>

2903
02:15:38.550 --> 02:15:40.420
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's a swiping through picking the game</v>

2904
02:15:40.421 --> 02:15:43.030
<v Speaker 4>that she wants to play and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's,</v>

2905
02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:48.340
<v Speaker 4>she is going to be cast did so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>earlier by,</v>

2906
02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:53.400
<v Speaker 4>by this because zero to five is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>important and it's going to be just so </v>

2907
02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:57.970
<v Speaker 4>isn't it interesting that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's going to be more than what we </v>

2908
02:15:57.970 --> 02:15:58.960
<v Speaker 4>think is going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to affect more than her eyes.</v>

2909
02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:02.650
<v Speaker 4>It's going to affect more than,</v>
<v Speaker 4>than her hips,</v>

2910
02:16:02.710 --> 02:16:05.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be really how she thinks,</v>

2911
02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:06.190
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how they,</v>

2912
02:16:06.250 --> 02:16:10.600
<v Speaker 4>how they both think is just going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>so impacted by the age of information.</v>

2913
02:16:10.860 --> 02:16:13.560
<v Speaker 6>How did you find this freaky nature </v>
<v Speaker 6>school thing?</v>

2914
02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:15.360
<v Speaker 6>Like how did that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that the,</v>

2915
02:16:15.361 --> 02:16:20.361
<v Speaker 6>is that something that you knew about </v>
<v Speaker 6>before you moved to the location you </v>

2916
02:16:20.361 --> 02:16:20.361
<v Speaker 6>live in?</v>

2917
02:16:20.361 --> 02:16:21.180
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just started its first year.</v>

2918
02:16:21.181 --> 02:16:23.310
<v Speaker 4>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a model that they've had in Germany</v>

2919
02:16:23.311 --> 02:16:28.311
<v Speaker 4>for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've had this kind of for what they </v>

2920
02:16:28.311 --> 02:16:29.410
<v Speaker 4>call forest kindergarten for maybe 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

2921
02:16:29.411 --> 02:16:32.080
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's popular in Europe.</v>

2922
02:16:32.530 --> 02:16:34.180
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just started coming over here.</v>

2923
02:16:34.181 --> 02:16:35.770
<v Speaker 4>There's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you looked online,</v>

2924
02:16:35.771 --> 02:16:37.720
<v Speaker 4>you could find,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2925
02:16:38.140 --> 02:16:41.920
<v Speaker 4>maybe 100 schools already operating like</v>
<v Speaker 4>this and they're just,</v>

2926
02:16:42.010 --> 02:16:47.010
<v Speaker 4>they're just outdoor preschools,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although they're starting to go up </v>

2927
02:16:47.010 --> 02:16:47.010
<v Speaker 4>higher,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2928
02:16:47.010 --> 02:16:51.661
<v Speaker 4>where there they're doing the curriculum</v>
<v Speaker 4>does based on child led interests.</v>

2929
02:16:52.601 --> 02:16:57.601
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like my son came home and were just </v>

2930
02:16:57.601 --> 02:17:01.291
<v Speaker 4>like taking a hike some time and he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>telling me the names of the trees and </v>

2931
02:17:01.291 --> 02:17:01.360
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like stuff that I didn't even know.</v>

2932
02:17:01.361 --> 02:17:03.160
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so it's not,</v>

2933
02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:06.940
<v Speaker 4>it's not like doing block,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not sitting out in the forest,</v>

2934
02:17:06.941 --> 02:17:08.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stacking blocks,</v>

2935
02:17:08.021 --> 02:17:11.440
<v Speaker 4>you're not coding colors or you're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing any.</v>

2936
02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:12.910
<v Speaker 4>I think they call them Schema,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2937
02:17:12.940 --> 02:17:16.750
<v Speaker 4>like you're not doing any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>structured Schema,</v>

2938
02:17:17.260 --> 02:17:19.840
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it happens all very organically.</v>

2939
02:17:19.841 --> 02:17:21.370
<v Speaker 4>You just start to notice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2940
02:17:21.910 --> 02:17:26.650
<v Speaker 4>I think it's definitely lends it self to</v>
<v Speaker 4>a scientific kind of outcome because you</v>

2941
02:17:26.651 --> 02:17:27.370
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my son's like,</v>

2942
02:17:27.371 --> 02:17:32.371
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at the frost patterns on this </v>

2943
02:17:32.371 --> 02:17:32.371
<v Speaker 4>versus this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2944
02:17:32.371 --> 02:17:32.710
<v Speaker 4>here's how you can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2945
02:17:32.711 --> 02:17:35.360
<v Speaker 4>where it was frosty and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is clearly underwater.</v>

2946
02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:40.380
<v Speaker 4>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just starting to recognize and </v>

2947
02:17:40.380 --> 02:17:42.100
<v Speaker 4>observe deed data and details about </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

2948
02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:43.510
<v Speaker 4>So I like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2949
02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:48.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I like that I see things that way.</v>

2950
02:17:48.191 --> 02:17:53.191
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it'll work for both my </v>

2951
02:17:53.191 --> 02:17:53.191
<v Speaker 4>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it definitely works for my son who's</v>

2952
02:17:53.191 --> 02:17:53.220
<v Speaker 4>more kinda like</v>

2953
02:17:53.230 --> 02:17:57.010
<v Speaker 6>me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm fascinated by the fact that you as a</v>

2954
02:17:57.011 --> 02:18:02.011
<v Speaker 6>scientist now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>someone who is an expert in human </v>

2955
02:18:02.011 --> 02:18:05.011
<v Speaker 6>movement and biomechanics and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've decided to try to engineer your </v>

2956
02:18:05.081 --> 02:18:07.390
<v Speaker 6>children from the jump.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2957
02:18:07.391 --> 02:18:12.391
<v Speaker 6>I don't know anybody that's done that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now it's done it to such a degree that </v>

2958
02:18:12.391 --> 02:18:16.141
<v Speaker 6>you've done it where you've gotten rid </v>
<v Speaker 6>of your couch and sit on the floor and </v>

2959
02:18:16.141 --> 02:18:18.130
<v Speaker 6>you got your kids in some theory.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Woods school.</v>

2960
02:18:18.550 --> 02:18:19.930
<v Speaker 6>They were born at home,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2961
02:18:19.950 --> 02:18:21.550
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's born at home.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2962
02:18:21.551 --> 02:18:23.620
<v Speaker 6>Christ woman.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now you're going crazy.</v>

2963
02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:27.640
<v Speaker 6>What would you do if it was a breach?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you had to spin the kid around in the</v>

2964
02:18:27.641 --> 02:18:31.330
<v Speaker 6>box?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Good midwives can do a lot of stuff,</v>

2965
02:18:31.331 --> 02:18:33.010
<v Speaker 6>but it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very close to a hospital.</v>

2966
02:18:33.250 --> 02:18:34.120
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Freak you out.</v>

2967
02:18:34.210 --> 02:18:35.890
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Didn't freak me out.</v>

2968
02:18:36.750 --> 02:18:41.750
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have watched and been at lots of </v>

2969
02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:43.941
<v Speaker 4>births.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pelvic pelvic floor mechanics was my </v>

2970
02:18:43.941 --> 02:18:45.300
<v Speaker 4>whole undergraduate biomechanics work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you know a lot about something,</v>

2971
02:18:45.301 --> 02:18:46.660
<v Speaker 4>there's not a lot of fear there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2972
02:18:46.670 --> 02:18:50.220
<v Speaker 4>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a healthy dose of of emergency</v>

2973
02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:53.370
<v Speaker 4>preparedness to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything was going to be okay,</v>

2974
02:18:53.371 --> 02:18:54.790
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there was a,</v>

2975
02:18:54.930 --> 02:18:57.310
<v Speaker 4>there wasn't a lot of tension or stress </v>
<v Speaker 4>in me because I was.</v>

2976
02:18:57.310 --> 02:18:57.530
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty</v>

2977
02:18:57.530 --> 02:19:02.530
<v Speaker 6>cool with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What about if you need stitches or any </v>

2978
02:19:02.530 --> 02:19:02.600
<v Speaker 6>things along those lines?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They can do all that.</v>

2979
02:19:03.340 --> 02:19:04.590
<v Speaker 6>Midwife,</v>
<v Speaker 6>midwife.</v>

2980
02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:06.470
<v Speaker 6>I didn't do it myself,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but my wife can stitch you up.</v>

2981
02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:08.210
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh Christ.</v>

2982
02:19:08.540 --> 02:19:13.540
<v Speaker 6>Some amateur lady down there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not An amateur in you with a needle and </v>

2983
02:19:13.540 --> 02:19:13.820
<v Speaker 6>thread.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2984
02:19:13.821 --> 02:19:15.350
<v Speaker 6>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Knitting needles.</v>

2985
02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:20.240
<v Speaker 6>Dirty fingernails and no soap.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't know what you soap.</v>

2986
02:19:20.340 --> 02:19:22.540
<v Speaker 6>We want to keep everything biological.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2987
02:19:22.550 --> 02:19:25.250
<v Speaker 6>it's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you use a tub?</v>

2988
02:19:25.310 --> 02:19:27.580
<v Speaker 6>Did you give birth to the kid in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>water one?</v>

2989
02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:28.180
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One.</v>

2990
02:19:28.180 --> 02:19:28.360
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2991
02:19:28.900 --> 02:19:33.900
<v Speaker 5>The water thing is a freaky one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a lot of people that I've known </v>

2992
02:19:33.900 --> 02:19:35.500
<v Speaker 5>that have tried to do the birth in </v>
<v Speaker 5>house,</v>

2993
02:19:35.501 --> 02:19:37.840
<v Speaker 5>have done it in the tub to think it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>very strange.</v>

2994
02:19:38.090 --> 02:19:43.090
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes it very comfortable and </v>

2995
02:19:43.090 --> 02:19:43.090
<v Speaker 4>supported,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2996
02:19:43.090 --> 02:19:43.090
<v Speaker 4>what your labor and let people get out </v>
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>

2997
02:19:43.090 --> 02:19:45.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to actually do the birthday climb out of</v>

2998
02:19:45.231 --> 02:19:45.860
<v Speaker 4>the tub.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

2999
02:19:45.861 --> 02:19:46.640
<v Speaker 4>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3000
02:19:46.641 --> 02:19:48.560
<v Speaker 4>there are certain positions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really hard.</v>

3001
02:19:48.561 --> 02:19:49.030
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3002
02:19:49.031 --> 02:19:50.570
<v Speaker 4>you're teaching people how to kick and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

3003
02:19:50.571 --> 02:19:51.950
<v Speaker 4>you don't have the hip range of motion </v>
<v Speaker 4>to kick.</v>

3004
02:19:51.951 --> 02:19:56.951
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if you don't have the hip range of </v>

3005
02:19:56.951 --> 02:19:56.951
<v Speaker 4>motion to squat these unnecessary </v>
<v Speaker 4>positions that open all the bones up.</v>

3006
02:19:57.290 --> 02:19:58.490
<v Speaker 4>Lot of people can't get into them.</v>

3007
02:19:58.770 --> 02:20:03.770
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've always wondered about people that </v>

3008
02:20:03.770 --> 02:20:03.770
<v Speaker 5>need to sarian sections,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like women with rain,</v>

3009
02:20:03.770 --> 02:20:08.160
<v Speaker 5>narrow hips and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have a large husband and the baby's</v>

3010
02:20:08.190 --> 02:20:09.900
<v Speaker 5>got a giant fucking head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3011
02:20:10.010 --> 02:20:12.120
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what would you do in the wild?</v>

3012
02:20:12.121 --> 02:20:12.990
<v Speaker 5>Like you would die?</v>

3013
02:20:13.020 --> 02:20:14.160
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's.</v>

3014
02:20:14.220 --> 02:20:19.220
<v Speaker 4>I think that again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of things like the growth </v>

3015
02:20:19.220 --> 02:20:21.750
<v Speaker 4>rate of the baby that our diet and </v>
<v Speaker 4>movement related.</v>

3016
02:20:22.020 --> 02:20:24.330
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that growth rate of the baby,</v>

3017
02:20:24.390 --> 02:20:25.420
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like yes,</v>

3018
02:20:25.450 --> 02:20:27.750
<v Speaker 4>like your baby is not this arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 4>size.</v>

3019
02:20:27.751 --> 02:20:32.751
<v Speaker 4>It just pops out like in its DNA are </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be eight point eight pounds or </v>

3020
02:20:32.751 --> 02:20:32.751
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

3021
02:20:32.751 --> 02:20:36.860
<v Speaker 4>it's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is a relationship in gestation </v>

3022
02:20:36.860 --> 02:20:40.670
<v Speaker 4>that has to do with that for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't figure out like what's </v>

3023
02:20:40.670 --> 02:20:40.670
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the signal for a woman?</v>

3024
02:20:40.670 --> 02:20:42.210
<v Speaker 4>You start giving birth and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3025
02:20:42.211 --> 02:20:47.211
<v Speaker 4>it's got to be something to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>size of the head and the and the pelvis </v>

3026
02:20:47.211 --> 02:20:48.990
<v Speaker 4>and the autism signal and the lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they're trying to figure it out.</v>

3027
02:20:48.991 --> 02:20:53.630
<v Speaker 4>Like we still don't know a lot of basic </v>
<v Speaker 4>things about how this species worked.</v>

3028
02:20:53.640 --> 02:20:58.640
<v Speaker 4>We've kind of gone right down into like </v>
<v Speaker 4>advanced technology and no one's really </v>

3029
02:20:58.640 --> 02:20:59.610
<v Speaker 4>done a lot of work just going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how does this,</v>

3030
02:20:59.820 --> 02:21:02.580
<v Speaker 4>how does this species work before we go </v>
<v Speaker 4>over and look at other animals?</v>

3031
02:21:02.581 --> 02:21:04.860
<v Speaker 4>Like how does this one work again?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3032
02:21:05.580 --> 02:21:07.470
<v Speaker 4>and so the big thing was like narrow </v>
<v Speaker 4>hips,</v>

3033
02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:10.470
<v Speaker 4>like narrow hips is one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is one of my pet peeves,</v>

3034
02:21:10.500 --> 02:21:14.460
<v Speaker 4>like telling women that they're too </v>
<v Speaker 4>small to give to give birth,</v>

3035
02:21:14.461 --> 02:21:19.461
<v Speaker 4>but then they look at data of women who </v>
<v Speaker 4>are up and move more through their </v>

3036
02:21:19.461 --> 02:21:20.790
<v Speaker 4>pregnancy and head circumference,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3037
02:21:20.791 --> 02:21:21.410
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3038
02:21:21.870 --> 02:21:26.870
<v Speaker 4>that the shape of the baby again is </v>
<v Speaker 4>based on movement of the vessel in which</v>

3039
02:21:27.691 --> 02:21:31.800
<v Speaker 4>it's in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's becoming more understood to be</v>

3040
02:21:31.801 --> 02:21:36.801
<v Speaker 4>very mechano regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mechano meaning like any sort of </v>

3041
02:21:36.801 --> 02:21:40.251
<v Speaker 4>mechanical forces on the embryo in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>embryo is sensing movement and there's </v>

3042
02:21:40.321 --> 02:21:43.510
<v Speaker 4>pressure on the uterus and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3043
02:21:43.530 --> 02:21:44.970
<v Speaker 4>and that's an environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an,</v>

3044
02:21:44.971 --> 02:21:46.920
<v Speaker 4>a mechanical environment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>affects foot position,</v>

3045
02:21:46.921 --> 02:21:51.690
<v Speaker 4>the ability for it to move and twist and</v>
<v Speaker 4>to start that developmental phase.</v>

3046
02:21:51.691 --> 02:21:56.691
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of things that we do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that limits developing human movement </v>

3047
02:21:56.761 --> 02:21:58.350
<v Speaker 4>because we are so still.</v>

3048
02:21:58.780 --> 02:22:03.520
<v Speaker 5>So the more active your child is a child</v>
<v Speaker 5>or the more active you are,</v>

3049
02:22:03.521 --> 02:22:06.700
<v Speaker 5>rather it changes the shape of your </v>
<v Speaker 5>child in the womb,</v>

3050
02:22:06.701 --> 02:22:08.700
<v Speaker 5>the size of your child,</v>
<v Speaker 5>brother in the womb.</v>

3051
02:22:08.730 --> 02:22:13.140
<v Speaker 4>We'll allow it affects their spacing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It affects their space and the pressures</v>

3052
02:22:13.141 --> 02:22:16.140
<v Speaker 4>that are on them that are there </v>
<v Speaker 4>mechanical environment</v>

3053
02:22:17.060 --> 02:22:20.090
<v Speaker 5>and how does that affect a woman having </v>
<v Speaker 5>narrow hips?</v>

3054
02:22:20.091 --> 02:22:25.091
<v Speaker 5>I mean this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it possible that a baby would be </v>

3055
02:22:25.091 --> 02:22:25.091
<v Speaker 5>small enough that it would pass through </v>
<v Speaker 5>if she's really.</v>

3056
02:22:25.500 --> 02:22:28.380
<v Speaker 5>Whereas if she's sedentary and she has </v>
<v Speaker 5>narrow hips,</v>

3057
02:22:28.381 --> 02:22:30.090
<v Speaker 5>the baby's just going to be too big and </v>
<v Speaker 5>fat.</v>

3058
02:22:30.091 --> 02:22:30.570
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it is?</v>

3059
02:22:30.600 --> 02:22:31.330
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>

3060
02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:33.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean narrow hips like your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

3061
02:22:33.180 --> 02:22:36.690
<v Speaker 4>your hip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the obstetrical conjugate this space,</v>

3062
02:22:36.750 --> 02:22:41.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where the baby is coming out is not a </v>

3063
02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:41.750
<v Speaker 4>set structure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have hinges in.</v>

3064
02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:44.910
<v Speaker 4>There were things articulate and become </v>
<v Speaker 4>bigger or smaller as needed,</v>

3065
02:22:45.120 --> 02:22:50.120
<v Speaker 4>but those hinges,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being able to articulate depends on how </v>

3066
02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:51.960
<v Speaker 4>fluid you yourself made.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how much,</v>

3067
02:22:51.990 --> 02:22:54.150
<v Speaker 4>how much movement did you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3068
02:22:54.420 --> 02:22:56.700
<v Speaker 4>were you squatting for a long period of </v>
<v Speaker 4>time?</v>

3069
02:22:56.701 --> 02:23:01.701
<v Speaker 4>So like squatting is something that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>totally natural for humans and humans </v>

3070
02:23:01.701 --> 02:23:05.010
<v Speaker 4>would have to do it a few times a day to</v>
<v Speaker 4>bathroom,</v>

3071
02:23:05.011 --> 02:23:06.750
<v Speaker 4>but also getting up and down off of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>floor.</v>

3072
02:23:06.751 --> 02:23:10.590
<v Speaker 4>So you imagine what the shape of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pelvis would be in the mall.</v>

3073
02:23:10.660 --> 02:23:15.300
<v Speaker 4>The mobility of the hips and the sacred </v>
<v Speaker 4>and all these joints that play a role in</v>

3074
02:23:15.301 --> 02:23:20.301
<v Speaker 4>birth and then you go how but how </v>
<v Speaker 4>natural are they not when you want to </v>

3075
02:23:20.581 --> 02:23:23.910
<v Speaker 4>take them to something like birthing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that everyone does.</v>

3076
02:23:23.911 --> 02:23:26.310
<v Speaker 4>So I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a natural birthing advocate,</v>

3077
02:23:26.580 --> 02:23:28.920
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time I'm more an </v>
<v Speaker 4>advocate for like if you,</v>

3078
02:23:28.980 --> 02:23:33.130
<v Speaker 4>if you want to have like a vaginal </v>
<v Speaker 4>delivery instead of Assyrian,</v>

3079
02:23:33.300 --> 02:23:37.350
<v Speaker 4>there's work to do in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to do a certain kick,</v>

3080
02:23:37.610 --> 02:23:42.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for your martial arts class that takes </v>

3081
02:23:42.610 --> 02:23:44.721
<v Speaker 4>training to reestablish this shape and </v>
<v Speaker 4>mobility so that you don't have too </v>

3082
02:23:44.721 --> 02:23:45.660
<v Speaker 4>small of a space.</v>

3083
02:23:45.900 --> 02:23:49.230
<v Speaker 5>So what do you do to stretch out your </v>
<v Speaker 5>quote unquote space?</v>

3084
02:23:49.310 --> 02:23:51.260
<v Speaker 4>Well you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just become more mobile.</v>

3085
02:23:51.261 --> 02:23:52.600
<v Speaker 4>So the hips in general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so like,</v>

3086
02:23:52.660 --> 02:23:56.780
<v Speaker 4>like I couldn't well more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more specifically like furniture,</v>

3087
02:23:56.781 --> 02:24:01.781
<v Speaker 4>like again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at your relationship with your </v>

3088
02:24:01.781 --> 02:24:01.781
<v Speaker 4>furniture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

3089
02:24:01.781 --> 02:24:03.740
<v Speaker 4>getting pregnant women off the couch and</v>
<v Speaker 4>onto a floor and in,</v>

3090
02:24:03.741 --> 02:24:08.741
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in what happens when you get on the </v>

3091
02:24:08.741 --> 02:24:08.741
<v Speaker 4>floor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you get on the floor,</v>

3092
02:24:08.741 --> 02:24:11.710
<v Speaker 4>you're essentially doing something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>looks like the exercise that you go to a</v>

3093
02:24:11.931 --> 02:24:14.840
<v Speaker 4>class to do for an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3094
02:24:14.841 --> 02:24:17.930
<v Speaker 4>So all the things that you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you go to prenatal yoga,</v>

3095
02:24:17.931 --> 02:24:21.110
<v Speaker 4>they give you hip opening exercise and </v>
<v Speaker 4>like to sit on the floor.</v>

3096
02:24:21.770 --> 02:24:25.130
<v Speaker 4>You can go to the classes too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but don't go back onto the couch,</v>

3097
02:24:25.550 --> 02:24:29.110
<v Speaker 4>which is putting you back into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>position that you're adapting to it.</v>

3098
02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:32.690
<v Speaker 4>You don't adapt anymore to your class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you do two sitting on the couch.</v>

3099
02:24:32.691 --> 02:24:35.090
<v Speaker 4>You adapt to what you do 100 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>

3100
02:24:35.750 --> 02:24:38.510
<v Speaker 4>So just sit on the floor in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>position that you're doing</v>

3101
02:24:39.220 --> 02:24:44.220
<v Speaker 5>and how has it say on the forum more </v>
<v Speaker 5>beneficial because you're supporting </v>

3102
02:24:44.220 --> 02:24:45.820
<v Speaker 5>your weight on a flat structure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a flat surface.</v>

3103
02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:51.080
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't physically assume the same </v>

3104
02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:51.080
<v Speaker 4>geometry and the couch that you are in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the chair,</v>

3105
02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:52.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you automatically have to rotate your</v>

3106
02:24:52.831 --> 02:24:56.430
<v Speaker 4>hips and drop your knees and your </v>
<v Speaker 4>pelvis.</v>

3107
02:24:56.431 --> 02:24:59.100
<v Speaker 4>Now you're engaging,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your core muscles are working,</v>

3108
02:24:59.101 --> 02:25:01.020
<v Speaker 4>so the baby's getting bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're on the couch,</v>

3109
02:25:01.021 --> 02:25:02.640
<v Speaker 4>so even though the baby's getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>bigger,</v>

3110
02:25:02.641 --> 02:25:05.720
<v Speaker 4>that weight's never put on the muscles </v>
<v Speaker 4>that hold the baby,</v>

3111
02:25:05.721 --> 02:25:08.850
<v Speaker 4>so then you have to start tucking your </v>
<v Speaker 4>pelvis under a,</v>

3112
02:25:08.851 --> 02:25:13.851
<v Speaker 4>wearing a baby support belt because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not training your muscles </v>

3113
02:25:13.851 --> 02:25:15.870
<v Speaker 4>relative to the natural mass </v>
<v Speaker 4>accumulation of having a baby.</v>

3114
02:25:15.871 --> 02:25:19.590
<v Speaker 4>You have to be up and moving around with</v>
<v Speaker 4>that weight in order to adapt to it.</v>

3115
02:25:19.591 --> 02:25:22.890
<v Speaker 4>You can't put a Kettlebell in your lap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trained to it,</v>

3116
02:25:22.891 --> 02:25:27.891
<v Speaker 4>you to move it and swinging it around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had to move and swing around your </v>

3117
02:25:27.891 --> 02:25:27.891
<v Speaker 4>pregnancy weight to adapt to it.</v>

3118
02:25:27.891 --> 02:25:32.680
<v Speaker 6>And women that have natural or naturally</v>
<v Speaker 6>small hips and they can do all this.</v>

3119
02:25:33.681 --> 02:25:38.681
<v Speaker 6>You think it would aid them and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>would have like a normal birth or would </v>

3120
02:25:38.681 --> 02:25:40.100
<v Speaker 6>they still have like a huge issue?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know a lot of women,</v>

3121
02:25:40.360 --> 02:25:43.760
<v Speaker 6>like especially in Western medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they get to a point where they're like,</v>

3122
02:25:43.761 --> 02:25:44.840
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we've got to cut you.</v>

3123
02:25:44.900 --> 02:25:46.460
<v Speaker 6>We can't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that baby's not going to come out.</v>

3124
02:25:47.110 --> 02:25:50.020
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of factors that affect,</v>

3125
02:25:50.770 --> 02:25:55.770
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the birthing process and I don't think </v>

3126
02:25:55.770 --> 02:26:00.271
<v Speaker 4>that there is as much evidence for space</v>
<v Speaker 4>being a factor as it is used as a casual</v>

3127
02:26:03.551 --> 02:26:08.551
<v Speaker 4>reason to like what I mean if you're at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the point where you've tried to labor </v>

3128
02:26:08.551 --> 02:26:12.750
<v Speaker 4>and it's not happening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you move to a Sicilian that's pretty </v>

3129
02:26:12.750 --> 02:26:12.750
<v Speaker 4>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3130
02:26:12.750 --> 02:26:16.890
<v Speaker 4>but the situation in which that Labor </v>
<v Speaker 4>has happened is usually in a city is in </v>

3131
02:26:16.910 --> 02:26:20.260
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is in a position where the forces aren't</v>

3132
02:26:20.261 --> 02:26:22.180
<v Speaker 4>necessarily in your favor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3133
02:26:22.181 --> 02:26:23.860
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're on your back the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>entire time,</v>

3134
02:26:23.861 --> 02:26:25.630
<v Speaker 4>it's like the baby's not moving down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3135
02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:28.570
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what could you do to help bring it down?</v>

3136
02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:30.040
<v Speaker 4>Like you could be more upright.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>

3137
02:26:30.041 --> 02:26:35.041
<v Speaker 4>there's so many things you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they don't necessarily happen well </v>

3138
02:26:35.041 --> 02:26:38.520
<v Speaker 4>in a hospital that have their own set of</v>
<v Speaker 4>rules and equipment in which they have </v>

3139
02:26:38.520 --> 02:26:42.481
<v Speaker 4>to be monitoring you with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of the tradeoff for constant </v>

3140
02:26:42.481 --> 02:26:46.830
<v Speaker 4>monitoring and emergency care is the OP.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The optimal process is sometimes </v>

3141
02:26:50.321 --> 02:26:52.420
<v Speaker 4>compromised,</v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

3142
02:26:52.421 --> 02:26:55.750
<v Speaker 4>Uncomfortable questions the placenta.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3143
02:26:56.160 --> 02:26:59.170
<v Speaker 4>What do you do with that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well with my son,</v>

3144
02:26:59.171 --> 02:27:02.890
<v Speaker 4>it went in the ocean with my daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It went into the woods when I was done.</v>

3145
02:27:02.891 --> 02:27:06.850
<v Speaker 4>It usually just goes into a bag in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>freezer bag in the freezer,</v>

3146
02:27:07.630 --> 02:27:09.280
<v Speaker 4>freeze it until it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>

3147
02:27:11.490 --> 02:27:16.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it becomes hard after you put it </v>

3148
02:27:16.490 --> 02:27:16.490
<v Speaker 4>in the freezer that why do you put in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the oil?</v>

3149
02:27:16.490 --> 02:27:19.930
<v Speaker 4>It's bloody and goopy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just.</v>

3150
02:27:20.290 --> 02:27:22.540
<v Speaker 4>You can't really throw it in the trash.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it has to,</v>

3151
02:27:22.590 --> 02:27:27.590
<v Speaker 4>has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Has to have some place where it can </v>

3152
02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:27.610
<v Speaker 4>safely breakdown away from people you </v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't.</v>

3153
02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:30.880
<v Speaker 4>I guess you could say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I mean it's,</v>

3154
02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:32.140
<v Speaker 4>it's biomass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3155
02:27:32.141 --> 02:27:37.141
<v Speaker 4>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But isn't that like food scraps and </v>

3156
02:27:37.141 --> 02:27:37.141
<v Speaker 4>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is just like a.</v>

3157
02:27:37.141 --> 02:27:38.980
<v Speaker 4>it's like a takeout bag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't eat it though.</v>

3158
02:27:39.340 --> 02:27:41.950
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uncomfortable question.</v>

3159
02:27:41.951 --> 02:27:43.090
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that what the question is now?</v>

3160
02:27:43.630 --> 02:27:44.830
<v Speaker 4>Some people do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people do.</v>

3161
02:27:44.831 --> 02:27:46.990
<v Speaker 4>That's a big thing because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what an animal,</v>

3162
02:27:46.991 --> 02:27:49.980
<v Speaker 4>a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm more of biomechanics,</v>

3163
02:27:49.990 --> 02:27:54.990
<v Speaker 4>so like movement in geometry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like as opposed to like eating my </v>

3164
02:27:54.990 --> 02:27:54.990
<v Speaker 4>placenta.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't do that.</v>

3165
02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.940
<v Speaker 4>Some people boil it down and make a tea </v>
<v Speaker 4>or dehydrated,</v>

3166
02:27:57.941 --> 02:28:00.400
<v Speaker 4>make a powder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>scramble it.</v>

3167
02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:03.580
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that the thought is right.</v>

3168
02:28:03.581 --> 02:28:05.380
<v Speaker 4>So most animal mothers eat it.</v>

3169
02:28:05.940 --> 02:28:10.940
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the reason is not devoid off </v>

3170
02:28:10.940 --> 02:28:11.130
<v Speaker 6>predators because the smell.</v>

3171
02:28:11.170 --> 02:28:12.910
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you've been told.</v>

3172
02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:16.030
<v Speaker 4>Well that's definitely what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>With certain animals like deer</v>

3173
02:28:17.570 --> 02:28:20.660
<v Speaker 6>biomap,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't eat animal protein other than</v>

3174
02:28:20.661 --> 02:28:20.960
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

3175
02:28:21.530 --> 02:28:21.890
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

3176
02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:24.500
<v Speaker 6>But because they've been doing it for a </v>
<v Speaker 6>long time,</v>

3177
02:28:24.501 --> 02:28:29.501
<v Speaker 6>there can be something that's consumed </v>
<v Speaker 6>in that movement of or that in that </v>

3178
02:28:29.501 --> 02:28:31.250
<v Speaker 6>choice of doing so that comes along with</v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

3179
02:28:31.251 --> 02:28:36.251
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In biology there's a lot of naturally </v>

3180
02:28:36.251 --> 02:28:39.881
<v Speaker 6>occurring byproduct just because of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>relationship of how something has been </v>

3181
02:28:39.881 --> 02:28:44.141
<v Speaker 6>done for a long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like I use bees pollinating as an </v>

3182
02:28:44.141 --> 02:28:44.360
<v Speaker 6>example.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like bees aren't.</v>

3183
02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:47.450
<v Speaker 6>They're not actively pollinating,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're just eating,</v>

3184
02:28:48.110 --> 02:28:53.110
<v Speaker 6>but their structure is is pollinating by</v>
<v Speaker 6>default just because it happened to be </v>

3185
02:28:53.571 --> 02:28:58.571
<v Speaker 6>the right structure that had some static</v>
<v Speaker 6>electricity because of the way that the </v>

3186
02:28:58.571 --> 02:29:02.381
<v Speaker 6>wings flew around and then it happened </v>
<v Speaker 6>and p Harry instead of smooth so that </v>

3187
02:29:02.451 --> 02:29:07.451
<v Speaker 6>the pollen could stick in there and then</v>
<v Speaker 6>it just brushes up against it and it </v>

3188
02:29:07.451 --> 02:29:10.301
<v Speaker 6>becomes this vessel,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's a byproduct of Polynesian is </v>

3189
02:29:10.301 --> 02:29:13.310
<v Speaker 6>just something that occurs because of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>structure.</v>

3190
02:29:13.310 --> 02:29:17.600
<v Speaker 6>So if you eat something to keep a </v>
<v Speaker 6>Predator from coming,</v>

3191
02:29:17.870 --> 02:29:19.730
<v Speaker 6>coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you've always done it.</v>

3192
02:29:19.731 --> 02:29:23.390
<v Speaker 6>Then there can be some sort of compound </v>
<v Speaker 6>that triggers milk production.</v>

3193
02:29:23.391 --> 02:29:25.700
<v Speaker 6>Like who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who knows what it's in.</v>

3194
02:29:25.701 --> 02:29:30.701
<v Speaker 6>So when you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you look at a population of people </v>

3195
02:29:30.701 --> 02:29:34.541
<v Speaker 6>who are having kids and it's like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a very large percentage of this </v>

3196
02:29:35.001 --> 02:29:38.240
<v Speaker 6>population that's struggling just after </v>
<v Speaker 6>having a baby.</v>

3197
02:29:38.330 --> 02:29:42.140
<v Speaker 6>Could we be missing some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>naturally occurring nutrient?</v>

3198
02:29:42.141 --> 02:29:47.141
<v Speaker 6>And I think that's why people take the </v>
<v Speaker 6>placenta is because they're just trying </v>

3199
02:29:47.141 --> 02:29:50.261
<v Speaker 6>to hedge their bets.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like maybe inside the placenta is </v>

3200
02:29:50.261 --> 02:29:51.350
<v Speaker 6>something that keeps me from feeling </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>

3201
02:29:51.351 --> 02:29:53.450
<v Speaker 6>whatever issue like there are diagnosed </v>
<v Speaker 6>with,</v>

3202
02:29:53.451 --> 02:29:58.451
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if it plays some sort of role in </v>

3203
02:29:58.451 --> 02:30:01.990
<v Speaker 6>hormonal regulation afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is it part of the input that changes how</v>

3204
02:30:02.811 --> 02:30:05.630
<v Speaker 6>your physiology starts going back to </v>
<v Speaker 6>what it was before.</v>

3205
02:30:05.630 --> 02:30:10.630
<v Speaker 6>There's so much that we don't know that </v>
<v Speaker 6>things are very easily dismissed as we </v>

3206
02:30:12.171 --> 02:30:17.171
<v Speaker 6>know the reason or that's no longer a </v>
<v Speaker 6>necessary structure just because it </v>

3207
02:30:17.171 --> 02:30:20.741
<v Speaker 6>doesn't fit into our tank and so you </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't really want to approach biology </v>

3208
02:30:20.741 --> 02:30:24.800
<v Speaker 6>and physiology and anatomy with that </v>
<v Speaker 6>heavy bias that the way humans are doing</v>

3209
02:30:24.801 --> 02:30:29.801
<v Speaker 6>it right now in La is really an </v>
<v Speaker 6>indication of what humans need to be </v>

3210
02:30:29.801 --> 02:30:31.150
<v Speaker 6>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3211
02:30:31.220 --> 02:30:34.100
<v Speaker 6>people have a natural instinct to suck </v>
<v Speaker 6>on wounds.</v>

3212
02:30:34.290 --> 02:30:39.290
<v Speaker 6>Hundred cut your finger.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You naturally do that and then people </v>

3213
02:30:39.290 --> 02:30:40.670
<v Speaker 6>would tell you not to do that for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>longest time,</v>

3214
02:30:40.671 --> 02:30:45.671
<v Speaker 6>but then they found out the notes alive </v>
<v Speaker 6>as actually very strong healing </v>

3215
02:30:45.671 --> 02:30:48.971
<v Speaker 6>properties like we have an instinct to </v>
<v Speaker 6>suck on wounds because it actually does </v>

3216
02:30:48.971 --> 02:30:48.971
<v Speaker 6>help.</v>

3217
02:30:48.971 --> 02:30:50.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like that.</v>

3218
02:30:50.711 --> 02:30:55.711
<v Speaker 4>It's just part of the part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reflexes that we come with that have </v>

3219
02:30:56.470 --> 02:30:58.450
<v Speaker 4>kept us alive for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uncomfortable.</v>

3220
02:30:58.451 --> 02:31:00.700
<v Speaker 4>Question number two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you guys have toilets?</v>

3221
02:31:00.880 --> 02:31:05.880
<v Speaker 4>We do regular old toilets platforms </v>
<v Speaker 4>around platforms around.</v>

3222
02:31:07.241 --> 02:31:08.920
<v Speaker 4>There were regular toilets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3223
02:31:08.980 --> 02:31:11.800
<v Speaker 4>And the squad platform.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you build that?</v>

3224
02:31:11.980 --> 02:31:12.670
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can build it,</v>

3225
02:31:12.960 --> 02:31:17.960
<v Speaker 4>buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and is bought a squatty potty and you </v>

3226
02:31:17.960 --> 02:31:17.960
<v Speaker 4>just throw it up and</v>

3227
02:31:17.960 --> 02:31:18.320
<v Speaker 6>you don't make loud noises when someone </v>
<v Speaker 6>drops.</v>

3228
02:31:18.810 --> 02:31:19.950
<v Speaker 4>No doesn't because the height,</v>

3229
02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:21.540
<v Speaker 1>you mean your butts at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>altitude.</v>

3230
02:31:22.490 --> 02:31:27.490
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can actually just still sit on the </v>

3231
02:31:27.490 --> 02:31:30.441
<v Speaker 1>toilet and just put your feet up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your hips and knees are just a </v>

3232
02:31:30.441 --> 02:31:33.831
<v Speaker 1>different angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have to work any muscles </v>

3233
02:31:33.831 --> 02:31:33.831
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't actually have a squatty potty.</v>

3234
02:31:33.831 --> 02:31:38.571
<v Speaker 1>Can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any person sit down and you put your </v>

3235
02:31:38.571 --> 02:31:41.481
<v Speaker 1>feet up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just take like if you have a stack of </v>

3236
02:31:41.481 --> 02:31:41.700
<v Speaker 1>books or if you have like a wastepaper </v>
<v Speaker 1>basket is flip it over and put your feet</v>

3237
02:31:41.701 --> 02:31:46.701
<v Speaker 1>up on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just get your hips and your knees to a </v>

3238
02:31:46.701 --> 02:31:47.270
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3239
02:31:47.790 --> 02:31:52.100
<v Speaker 1>joint angle because it turns out again </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the tubes of,</v>

3240
02:31:52.520 --> 02:31:56.100
<v Speaker 1>of elimination line up better when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do the other,</v>

3241
02:31:56.101 --> 02:32:00.000
<v Speaker 1>that it's part of the system and without</v>
<v Speaker 1>that then you have to start bearing down</v>

3242
02:32:00.001 --> 02:32:03.630
<v Speaker 1>and adding forces into the system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't so good for.</v>

3243
02:32:03.631 --> 02:32:06.180
<v Speaker 1>They're good to accomplish that task,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not good for maybe the whole</v>

3244
02:32:06.181 --> 02:32:11.181
<v Speaker 1>structure like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that intra abdominal pressure over </v>

3245
02:32:11.181 --> 02:32:14.451
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's how you're forcing it to get </v>

3246
02:32:14.451 --> 02:32:16.341
<v Speaker 1>out moves things and other ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you have to poop in the woods,</v>

3247
02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:22.040
<v Speaker 1>it comes out real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like if you're sitting down a </v>

3248
02:32:22.040 --> 02:32:25.580
<v Speaker 1>toilet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like sometimes you can read a book </v>

3249
02:32:25.580 --> 02:32:27.030
<v Speaker 1>or go answer a few tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes awhile because you have to work</v>

3250
02:32:27.031 --> 02:32:31.530
<v Speaker 1>against the technology of a toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

3251
02:32:33.790 --> 02:32:35.290
<v Speaker 4>How did we get into the toilets then?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

3252
02:32:35.291 --> 02:32:36.910
<v Speaker 4>Where did that come along?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Women from toilet.</v>

3253
02:32:36.911 --> 02:32:38.470
<v Speaker 4>That was just uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Question number two,</v>

3254
02:32:38.880 --> 02:32:41.590
<v Speaker 4>how did we as human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how did we get to this,</v>

3255
02:32:41.650 --> 02:32:46.650
<v Speaker 4>this throne that you sit down on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How come nobody figured out that a long </v>

3256
02:32:46.650 --> 02:32:46.690
<v Speaker 4>time ago?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3257
02:32:46.691 --> 02:32:51.691
<v Speaker 4>I think that with civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of another inherent component of </v>

3258
02:32:52.211 --> 02:32:56.320
<v Speaker 4>civilization that you have to be better </v>
<v Speaker 4>than someone else,</v>

3259
02:32:56.380 --> 02:32:58.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so a lot of the things that we do,</v>

3260
02:32:59.290 --> 02:33:00.690
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

3261
02:33:01.330 --> 02:33:06.330
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our ways of delineating ourselves from </v>

3262
02:33:06.330 --> 02:33:10.021
<v Speaker 4>sap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we would call savages are more </v>

3263
02:33:10.021 --> 02:33:12.250
<v Speaker 4>primitive people like your shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You didn't want your skin to be too dark</v>

3264
02:33:12.251 --> 02:33:13.500
<v Speaker 4>or Tan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3265
02:33:13.510 --> 02:33:16.870
<v Speaker 4>you wanted to show that you had more </v>
<v Speaker 4>affluence that you weren't as barbaric.</v>

3266
02:33:16.871 --> 02:33:19.410
<v Speaker 4>You didn't have to poop on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could just poop it and push it flush</v>

3267
02:33:19.411 --> 02:33:20.440
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it went away.</v>

3268
02:33:20.441 --> 02:33:22.780
<v Speaker 4>And like it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just comes soft hands,</v>

3269
02:33:23.700 --> 02:33:28.700
<v Speaker 4>cultured demeanor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were less animal if you were less </v>

3270
02:33:28.871 --> 02:33:29.530
<v Speaker 4>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>

3271
02:33:29.580 --> 02:33:31.520
<v Speaker 4>You're trying to be more animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3272
02:33:31.630 --> 02:33:33.760
<v Speaker 4>but the word is primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am a primate.</v>

3273
02:33:34.150 --> 02:33:34.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3274
02:33:36.370 --> 02:33:41.370
<v Speaker 4>What advancements the society make that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you think has society made that you </v>

3275
02:33:41.370 --> 02:33:43.200
<v Speaker 4>think are beneficial?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3276
02:33:43.201 --> 02:33:45.520
<v Speaker 4>gosh man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think medicine is benefit.</v>

3277
02:33:45.521 --> 02:33:47.410
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think everything is beneficial.</v>

3278
02:33:47.411 --> 02:33:51.790
<v Speaker 4>It's just that what I'm more concerned </v>
<v Speaker 4>about is what's,</v>

3279
02:33:52.660 --> 02:33:57.660
<v Speaker 4>what has been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is no longer needed that is still </v>

3280
02:33:57.660 --> 02:33:57.810
<v Speaker 4>essential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

3281
02:33:57.820 --> 02:33:58.390
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3282
02:33:58.450 --> 02:34:03.450
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have really an aversion against </v>

3283
02:34:03.450 --> 02:34:05.940
<v Speaker 4>civilization and technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just that vitamin C is still </v>

3284
02:34:06.611 --> 02:34:11.611
<v Speaker 4>necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we can't get around the fact that </v>

3285
02:34:11.611 --> 02:34:14.401
<v Speaker 4>vitamin C is still necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm just trying to figure out </v>

3286
02:34:14.401 --> 02:34:17.610
<v Speaker 4>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you're trying to figure out </v>

3287
02:34:17.610 --> 02:34:19.651
<v Speaker 4>diseases you have to kind of boil down </v>
<v Speaker 4>to could this be a rising because of </v>

3288
02:34:19.651 --> 02:34:23.431
<v Speaker 4>some not and input some essential input </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we're not getting.</v>

3289
02:34:23.531 --> 02:34:28.420
<v Speaker 4>And so as people get more and more </v>
<v Speaker 4>advanced than our,</v>

3290
02:34:28.630 --> 02:34:33.630
<v Speaker 4>our health again in the terms of </v>
<v Speaker 4>biological sense isn't getting better </v>

3291
02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:39.480
<v Speaker 4>with us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what happens to a species that </v>

3292
02:34:39.480 --> 02:34:42.220
<v Speaker 4>advances itself right out of being a </v>
<v Speaker 4>species,</v>

3293
02:34:42.330 --> 02:34:43.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

3294
02:34:43.820 --> 02:34:45.520
<v Speaker 4>That's more what I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm interested in.</v>

3295
02:34:45.521 --> 02:34:47.170
<v Speaker 4>So I like it all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like all technology.</v>

3296
02:34:47.171 --> 02:34:49.390
<v Speaker 4>Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Netflix might be my favorite technology.</v>

3297
02:34:51.600 --> 02:34:53.400
<v Speaker 5>It just seems to me that you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

3298
02:34:53.401 --> 02:34:58.401
<v Speaker 5>you're in this really weird state of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of sort of primitive re-engineering.</v>

3299
02:35:01.291 --> 02:35:02.080
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3300
02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:04.380
<v Speaker 5>our primate re-engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3301
02:35:04.381 --> 02:35:05.850
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that seems like what you're doing,</v>

3302
02:35:06.150 --> 02:35:11.150
<v Speaker 5>like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're looking at all the various </v>

3303
02:35:11.150 --> 02:35:14.370
<v Speaker 5>various components of society that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>feel like are non beneficial.</v>

3304
02:35:14.610 --> 02:35:19.610
<v Speaker 5>You're eliminating them and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're doing it from the jump with your </v>

3305
02:35:19.610 --> 02:35:20.070
<v Speaker 5>children.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I find that very fascinating.</v>

3306
02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:21.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3307
02:35:21.041 --> 02:35:25.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a bed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the things sound radical,</v>

3308
02:35:25.091 --> 02:35:30.091
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as far as humans on the planet right </v>

3309
02:35:30.091 --> 02:35:32.521
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're really not so they might be </v>

3310
02:35:32.521 --> 02:35:34.651
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they might be more radical because are </v>

3311
02:35:34.651 --> 02:35:38.430
<v Speaker 4>decidedly non American,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think I'm really going out </v>

3312
02:35:38.430 --> 02:35:42.151
<v Speaker 4>of my way that much to be more animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's just like I don't feel my life</v>

3313
02:35:42.671 --> 02:35:43.900
<v Speaker 4>is enhanced with a bed.</v>

3314
02:35:45.430 --> 02:35:50.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't think my life is enhanced with </v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm obviously letting go the things</v>

3315
02:35:50.141 --> 02:35:52.570
<v Speaker 4>that I can't live without.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are certain things that,</v>

3316
02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:58.440
<v Speaker 4>that I know I still have a car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I some weird thing that you said in your</v>

3317
02:35:58.751 --> 02:36:03.610
<v Speaker 4>car and you sit on a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to sit as little as possible</v>

3318
02:36:03.611 --> 02:36:08.611
<v Speaker 4>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try to walk as many places as I can </v>

3319
02:36:08.611 --> 02:36:10.500
<v Speaker 4>sit in a weird way or anything I'll sit </v>
<v Speaker 4>across.</v>

3320
02:36:10.501 --> 02:36:15.501
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll sit in as many different ways in </v>

3321
02:36:15.501 --> 02:36:15.760
<v Speaker 4>the car as long as I hit the gas and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>pedal with your left foot.</v>

3322
02:36:15.790 --> 02:36:16.750
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3323
02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:18.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't play around with that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

3324
02:36:18.900 --> 02:36:20.260
<v Speaker 4>Now that can be dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3325
02:36:20.620 --> 02:36:23.710
<v Speaker 4>That'd be weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like sensory input is huge.</v>

3326
02:36:24.100 --> 02:36:29.100
<v Speaker 4>You're driving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're using a lot of motor memory when </v>

3327
02:36:29.100 --> 02:36:31.441
<v Speaker 4>you're driving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I would start playing </v>

3328
02:36:31.441 --> 02:36:31.441
<v Speaker 4>around with that kind of stuff.</v>

3329
02:36:31.441 --> 02:36:34.820
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've used my left foot to break </v>

3330
02:36:34.820 --> 02:36:35.050
<v Speaker 5>sometimes and it's amazing how dumb my </v>
<v Speaker 5>left foot is like my right foot is.</v>

3331
02:36:35.230 --> 02:36:36.690
<v Speaker 5>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so like,</v>

3332
02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:40.120
<v Speaker 5>it's interesting that we figured out a </v>
<v Speaker 5>way to use the foot for input,</v>

3333
02:36:40.540 --> 02:36:42.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the other thing you find out is that</v>

3334
02:36:42.341 --> 02:36:45.700
<v Speaker 5>your left foot gets tired if you were to</v>
<v Speaker 5>try to drive the gas.</v>

3335
02:36:45.701 --> 02:36:47.410
<v Speaker 5>We left,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like I hurt my right knee once and I</v>

3336
02:36:47.411 --> 02:36:50.770
<v Speaker 5>was driving with my left foot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your left foot gets tired.</v>

3337
02:36:51.130 --> 02:36:53.380
<v Speaker 5>It gets tired.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just pressing down on the gas pedal.</v>

3338
02:36:53.650 --> 02:36:58.650
<v Speaker 5>It's makes you think like what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What muscles are being programmed by my </v>

3339
02:36:58.650 --> 02:37:00.190
<v Speaker 5>right foot that are not being programmed</v>
<v Speaker 5>by my left.</v>

3340
02:37:00.590 --> 02:37:03.040
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a lot of things that I do </v>
<v Speaker 5>really good with my right side.</v>

3341
02:37:03.041 --> 02:37:04.660
<v Speaker 5>I don't do so good with my left side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3342
02:37:04.960 --> 02:37:07.480
<v Speaker 5>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

3343
02:37:07.481 --> 02:37:08.470
<v Speaker 5>hold the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a big one.</v>

3344
02:37:08.830 --> 02:37:13.830
<v Speaker 5>Throw kicks is another one that certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>kicks I just don't do as well with my </v>

3345
02:37:13.830 --> 02:37:13.830
<v Speaker 5>left side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the.</v>

3346
02:37:13.830 --> 02:37:16.160
<v Speaker 5>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder now,</v>

3347
02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:21.160
<v Speaker 6>especially after talking to you like </v>
<v Speaker 6>what other chains of things are not </v>

3348
02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:24.410
<v Speaker 6>working as well because of that in </v>
<v Speaker 6>balance.</v>

3349
02:37:25.940 --> 02:37:30.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think for me that brings up that </v>

3350
02:37:30.940 --> 02:37:33.260
<v Speaker 2>notion of alignment is an alignment is </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're moving,</v>

3351
02:37:33.720 --> 02:37:34.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alignment in your,</v>

3352
02:37:35.030 --> 02:37:40.030
<v Speaker 2>in your car is like when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the relationship of all of the </v>

3353
02:37:40.030 --> 02:37:43.481
<v Speaker 2>parts are where they should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the way that you drive </v>

3354
02:37:43.481 --> 02:37:46.970
<v Speaker 2>optimizes the longevity of the structure</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the car as a whole.</v>

3355
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:48.240
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have anyone.</v>

3356
02:37:48.290 --> 02:37:53.290
<v Speaker 2>We'll getting its job done as a wheel is</v>
<v Speaker 2>wearing down the break on that side </v>

3357
02:37:53.290 --> 02:37:54.470
<v Speaker 2>where it's costing you something that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't.</v>

3358
02:37:54.471 --> 02:37:59.471
<v Speaker 2>So it's the same thing with the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to figure out your </v>

3359
02:37:59.471 --> 02:38:01.931
<v Speaker 2>alignment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is how can I be using my arm </v>

3360
02:38:01.931 --> 02:38:02.450
<v Speaker 2>without</v>

3361
02:38:04.140 --> 02:38:09.140
<v Speaker 2>wearing down my shoulder prematurely </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the muscles between the two are </v>

3362
02:38:09.140 --> 02:38:12.741
<v Speaker 2>tighter than they should be because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>always do the same thing with my left </v>

3363
02:38:12.741 --> 02:38:14.430
<v Speaker 2>arm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's less about.</v>

3364
02:38:15.030 --> 02:38:17.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean muscle balancing is one way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at it,</v>

3365
02:38:17.581 --> 02:38:21.960
<v Speaker 2>but also just look at what are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>movements you do in your life.</v>

3366
02:38:21.961 --> 02:38:26.100
<v Speaker 2>Like if you had to make a list of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top 10 moves you do in your life outside</v>

3367
02:38:26.101 --> 02:38:27.960
<v Speaker 2>of your exercise program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what are they?</v>

3368
02:38:28.360 --> 02:38:33.360
<v Speaker 2>It's sitting from like getting up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>down out of chairs is a thing that you </v>

3369
02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:37.251
<v Speaker 2>do most often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't do very much with our body </v>

3370
02:38:37.251 --> 02:38:37.650
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it's not exercising almost nothing.</v>

3371
02:38:37.950 --> 02:38:39.330
<v Speaker 2>What kind of exercise do you do?</v>

3372
02:38:43.270 --> 02:38:44.260
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none.</v>

3373
02:38:45.370 --> 02:38:50.370
<v Speaker 2>None really in that I have really </v>
<v Speaker 2>eliminated structured exercise time out </v>

3374
02:38:52.691 --> 02:38:57.580
<v Speaker 2>of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you plotted my body on a graph,</v>

3375
02:38:57.581 --> 02:39:02.581
<v Speaker 2>what you would see is probably five </v>
<v Speaker 2>miles of walking a day almost carrying </v>

3376
02:39:02.581 --> 02:39:05.830
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost always while doing that,</v>

3377
02:39:05.860 --> 02:39:08.530
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in different arms all of the time.</v>

3378
02:39:08.620 --> 02:39:11.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3379
02:39:11.231 --> 02:39:13.900
<v Speaker 2>working on the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My stillness is on the computer time,</v>

3380
02:39:13.901 --> 02:39:16.840
<v Speaker 2>but really it's just that getting up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>down off of the floor,</v>

3381
02:39:17.050 --> 02:39:18.630
<v Speaker 2>sitting on the floor in different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would,</v>

3382
02:39:18.670 --> 02:39:20.590
<v Speaker 2>which would look like stretching I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>say to most people.</v>

3383
02:39:20.591 --> 02:39:25.591
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm always working on some sort of </v>

3384
02:39:25.591 --> 02:39:28.321
<v Speaker 2>stretch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's really just to get something </v>

3385
02:39:28.321 --> 02:39:28.321
<v Speaker 2>accomplished.</v>

3386
02:39:28.860 --> 02:39:31.200
<v Speaker 6>So no lifting weights,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no squatting,</v>

3387
02:39:31.590 --> 02:39:31.920
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

3388
02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:35.260
<v Speaker 2>Well I circled lifts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>squat because I don't have furniture,</v>

3389
02:39:35.261 --> 02:39:40.261
<v Speaker 2>so I probably do 200 squats a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't do them repetitively.</v>

3390
02:39:41.831 --> 02:39:46.831
<v Speaker 2>They're distributed throughout the day </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're held sometimes for three or </v>

3391
02:39:47.861 --> 02:39:52.360
<v Speaker 2>four minutes while I'm doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would say that my moves,</v>

3392
02:39:52.361 --> 02:39:57.361
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you loaded up my moves and put them </v>

3393
02:39:57.361 --> 02:39:59.581
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't look that much different </v>

3394
02:39:59.581 --> 02:40:01.060
<v Speaker 2>than a workout probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would probably look most like,</v>

3395
02:40:02.200 --> 02:40:05.500
<v Speaker 2>like a cross,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a crossfit kind of workout,</v>

3396
02:40:05.501 --> 02:40:06.490
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3397
02:40:06.760 --> 02:40:11.760
<v Speaker 2>as far as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the variation of moves and my kids are </v>

3398
02:40:12.041 --> 02:40:17.041
<v Speaker 2>heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like you're them around and moving </v>

3399
02:40:17.041 --> 02:40:17.041
<v Speaker 2>them around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it would,</v>

3400
02:40:17.041 --> 02:40:18.750
<v Speaker 2>it would just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just looked like regular living,</v>

3401
02:40:19.070 --> 02:40:21.310
<v Speaker 6>never exhausted and never breathing </v>
<v Speaker 6>heavy.</v>

3402
02:40:21.311 --> 02:40:26.311
<v Speaker 6>You never had a rapid heart rate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So your cardiovascular improvement from </v>

3403
02:40:26.311 --> 02:40:27.130
<v Speaker 6>something like that is probably pretty </v>
<v Speaker 6>minimal,</v>

3404
02:40:27.131 --> 02:40:27.340
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3405
02:40:27.370 --> 02:40:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3406
02:40:28.060 --> 02:40:31.420
<v Speaker 2>but I also go out like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're actually going out and hiking.</v>

3407
02:40:31.421 --> 02:40:34.390
<v Speaker 2>So if you go out and hike a couple miles</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3408
02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:38.710
<v Speaker 2>carrying or hurting kids like it does </v>
<v Speaker 2>stay.</v>

3409
02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:41.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>

3410
02:40:41.201 --> 02:40:44.830
<v Speaker 2>Like your heart rate is elevated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still practice recovery.</v>

3411
02:40:44.831 --> 02:40:45.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3412
02:40:45.461 --> 02:40:49.840
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons you do cardio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do cardio because this idea that you</v>

3413
02:40:49.841 --> 02:40:54.841
<v Speaker 2>want to keep your heart strong enough to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do what it's supposed to be,</v>

3414
02:40:54.851 --> 02:40:59.851
<v Speaker 2>to distribute oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your cardiovascular system distributes </v>

3415
02:40:59.851 --> 02:41:01.480
<v Speaker 2>oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just because it's beating faster,</v>

3416
02:41:01.481 --> 02:41:05.320
<v Speaker 2>working harder is not accomplishing </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole body oxygen distribution.</v>

3417
02:41:05.321 --> 02:41:07.780
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pulling blood away from anything,</v>

3418
02:41:07.781 --> 02:41:11.320
<v Speaker 2>not doing that thing that you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the moment.</v>

3419
02:41:11.321 --> 02:41:16.321
<v Speaker 2>So even that idea of cardio comes from </v>
<v Speaker 2>being still all the time.</v>

3420
02:41:16.451 --> 02:41:21.451
<v Speaker 2>What can I consume in a short period of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time that keeps my heart muscles strong </v>

3421
02:41:21.451 --> 02:41:26.311
<v Speaker 2>instead of going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can I take the resistance away from </v>

3422
02:41:26.311 --> 02:41:26.440
<v Speaker 2>my heart and distribute my oxygen all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>

3423
02:41:26.441 --> 02:41:31.441
<v Speaker 2>like my cardiovascular system is working</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time because I'm moving all the </v>

3424
02:41:31.441 --> 02:41:31.441
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

3425
02:41:31.441 --> 02:41:33.330
<v Speaker 6>I think what we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>two different things.</v>

3426
02:41:33.420 --> 02:41:35.450
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking about like what you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to accomplish,</v>

3427
02:41:35.451 --> 02:41:38.240
<v Speaker 6>whether or not you're trying to push </v>
<v Speaker 6>your body to an optimum state,</v>

3428
02:41:38.630 --> 02:41:40.940
<v Speaker 6>have you look into optimize your body's </v>
<v Speaker 6>performance.</v>

3429
02:41:40.941 --> 02:41:43.390
<v Speaker 6>You really not going to get that just by</v>
<v Speaker 6>caring kids doing,</v>

3430
02:41:43.910 --> 02:41:46.680
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sitting down on the ground like your,</v>

3431
02:41:46.690 --> 02:41:51.020
<v Speaker 6>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the difference between exercise.</v>

3432
02:41:51.350 --> 02:41:55.220
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people are thinking of exercise</v>
<v Speaker 6>as being something where,</v>

3433
02:41:55.530 --> 02:42:00.530
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess you're just trying to lose a </v>

3434
02:42:00.530 --> 02:42:00.530
<v Speaker 6>little weight or stay active or sweat a </v>
<v Speaker 6>little bit.</v>

3435
02:42:00.530 --> 02:42:02.540
<v Speaker 6>What I'm talking about is optimizing </v>
<v Speaker 6>your physical body,</v>

3436
02:42:02.541 --> 02:42:07.541
<v Speaker 6>like strengthening your body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>strengthening your cardiovascular </v>

3437
02:42:07.541 --> 02:42:08.720
<v Speaker 6>system,</v>
<v Speaker 6>strengthening your physical structure.</v>

3438
02:42:09.110 --> 02:42:14.110
<v Speaker 6>Like A,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a big believer in especially </v>

3439
02:42:14.110 --> 02:42:16.360
<v Speaker 6>resistance exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that it's very important for </v>

3440
02:42:16.360 --> 02:42:18.761
<v Speaker 6>bone density.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's very important to resist the aging </v>

3441
02:42:18.761 --> 02:42:22.280
<v Speaker 6>process and muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Keeping muscle density,</v>

3442
02:42:22.281 --> 02:42:25.400
<v Speaker 6>keeping bone density like you're not </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing anything like that.</v>

3443
02:42:26.210 --> 02:42:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3444
02:42:26.751 --> 02:42:31.670
<v Speaker 2>I think it's about how you're using the </v>
<v Speaker 2>word optimization optimization.</v>

3445
02:42:31.671 --> 02:42:36.671
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're optimizing the fitness </v>

3446
02:42:36.671 --> 02:42:40.100
<v Speaker 2>performance tests like one rep Max or or</v>
<v Speaker 2>a strength goal,</v>

3447
02:42:40.101 --> 02:42:44.150
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a static or physics perform</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a physical performance,</v>

3448
02:42:44.151 --> 02:42:48.350
<v Speaker 2>like how much weight can I move with his</v>
<v Speaker 2>body part and can I get more and more?</v>

3449
02:42:49.430 --> 02:42:54.430
<v Speaker 2>That's fine as long as your body is also</v>
<v Speaker 2>being successful at getting biological </v>

3450
02:42:56.360 --> 02:43:01.360
<v Speaker 2>tasks done and I think that in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cases people can have very high levels </v>

3451
02:43:02.901 --> 02:43:07.901
<v Speaker 2>of this fitness optimization for </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance for athletic performance,</v>

3452
02:43:09.290 --> 02:43:12.730
<v Speaker 2>but not be performing hundred percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>biologically</v>

3453
02:43:12.730 --> 02:43:15.020
<v Speaker 4>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How so?</v>

3454
02:43:15.940 --> 02:43:16.900
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think of like.</v>

3455
02:43:17.900 --> 02:43:22.690
<v Speaker 4>I think if like I in the book I use </v>
<v Speaker 4>cycling as an example where you can have</v>

3456
02:43:22.691 --> 02:43:27.691
<v Speaker 4>people who have huge vo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two Max capacity because they're </v>

3457
02:43:27.761 --> 02:43:32.761
<v Speaker 4>training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're doing a ton of endurance </v>

3458
02:43:32.761 --> 02:43:34.441
<v Speaker 4>training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the bone density in their hips and </v>

3459
02:43:34.441 --> 02:43:36.190
<v Speaker 4>most competitive cyclists is lower than </v>
<v Speaker 4>what it should be like.</v>

3460
02:43:36.191 --> 02:43:41.191
<v Speaker 4>They actually have like the hips have of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a 70 year old woman with osteoporosis </v>

3461
02:43:43.840 --> 02:43:46.630
<v Speaker 4>because they're not carrying any weight </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they've.</v>

3462
02:43:46.690 --> 02:43:49.150
<v Speaker 4>They've isolated the variable that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're training for.</v>

3463
02:43:49.450 --> 02:43:54.450
<v Speaker 4>Bone density is not necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a waste actually have bone </v>

3464
02:43:54.450 --> 02:43:57.391
<v Speaker 4>density,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's a lot of health tradeoffs </v>

3465
02:43:57.391 --> 02:44:01.440
<v Speaker 4>that occur when we train for performance</v>
<v Speaker 4>without keeping our eye constantly on </v>

3466
02:44:02.170 --> 02:44:07.170
<v Speaker 4>biology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I would say that my bone and see the </v>

3467
02:44:07.170 --> 02:44:09.091
<v Speaker 4>bone density of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of hunter gatherer populations is way </v>

3468
02:44:09.091 --> 02:44:12.211
<v Speaker 4>higher than it is in even like heavy </v>
<v Speaker 4>lifters because bone density is a whole </v>

3469
02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:19.080
<v Speaker 4>head to toe phenomenon and and you know </v>
<v Speaker 4>like people who have warned sues their </v>

3470
02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:23.341
<v Speaker 4>entire time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the bone density and their feet is </v>

3471
02:44:23.341 --> 02:44:23.341
<v Speaker 4>pretty low.</v>

3472
02:44:23.341 --> 02:44:24.430
<v Speaker 4>Like the size and shape of your bones is</v>
<v Speaker 4>small already.</v>

3473
02:44:24.760 --> 02:44:26.950
<v Speaker 4>Even if you do a lot with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3474
02:44:27.370 --> 02:44:30.430
<v Speaker 4>that the size and the shape is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

3475
02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:34.270
<v Speaker 4>is limited by the fact that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>move all the time.</v>

3476
02:44:34.271 --> 02:44:39.271
<v Speaker 4>Even though you do a ton of work to </v>
<v Speaker 4>optimize your fitness level in that </v>

3477
02:44:39.271 --> 02:44:44.010
<v Speaker 4>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're sedentary 96 percent of the time </v>

3478
02:44:44.010 --> 02:44:46.630
<v Speaker 4>so that the physical cap optimization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just different.</v>

3479
02:44:46.631 --> 02:44:51.631
<v Speaker 4>It's just different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a different set of variables </v>

3480
02:44:51.631 --> 02:44:53.911
<v Speaker 4>by which to assess yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're not mutually exclusive or </v>

3481
02:44:53.911 --> 02:44:58.511
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone could be doing everything that </v>

3482
02:44:58.511 --> 02:44:58.511
<v Speaker 4>you're doing and also lift weights and </v>
<v Speaker 4>improve their guns,</v>

3483
02:44:59.170 --> 02:45:02.800
<v Speaker 4>but I think you can be too strong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I think that some of you can be too</v>

3484
02:45:03.520 --> 02:45:05.320
<v Speaker 4>tight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so get in the birthing community.</v>

3485
02:45:05.321 --> 02:45:07.000
<v Speaker 4>There's this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this thing of,</v>

3486
02:45:07.180 --> 02:45:12.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are women who I'm doing a lot of </v>

3487
02:45:12.180 --> 02:45:14.380
<v Speaker 4>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their muscles get to the point where the</v>

3488
02:45:14.381 --> 02:45:19.381
<v Speaker 4>tension,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the resting tension is higher than what </v>

3489
02:45:19.381 --> 02:45:23.281
<v Speaker 4>it should be like saying their pelvic </v>
<v Speaker 4>floor and then they're having to </v>

3490
02:45:23.281 --> 02:45:26.281
<v Speaker 4>generate way more force or their tissues</v>
<v Speaker 4>will tear or give because the tension is</v>

3491
02:45:26.891 --> 02:45:30.300
<v Speaker 4>greater than what is natural because you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can.</v>

3492
02:45:30.710 --> 02:45:32.470
<v Speaker 4>Because you can get stronger and </v>
<v Speaker 4>stronger and stronger.</v>

3493
02:45:32.471 --> 02:45:36.460
<v Speaker 4>But at what point is your attention </v>
<v Speaker 4>higher than natural?</v>

3494
02:45:36.461 --> 02:45:38.800
<v Speaker 4>Because of the context of doing nothing </v>
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>

3495
02:45:38.801 --> 02:45:41.470
<v Speaker 4>The rest of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I will carry our kids,</v>

3496
02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:46.800
<v Speaker 4>but then there's like huge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like very fit guy and he came up to us </v>

3497
02:45:46.800 --> 02:45:46.840
<v Speaker 4>like if I had to carry my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no way.</v>

3498
02:45:46.841 --> 02:45:51.841
<v Speaker 4>My back had tolerated it for more than </v>
<v Speaker 4>20 minutes and I've been following you </v>

3499
02:45:51.841 --> 02:45:51.841
<v Speaker 4>guys around all day and you've had these</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids for hours.</v>

3500
02:45:51.841 --> 02:45:52.000
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>

3501
02:45:52.270 --> 02:45:54.250
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't even do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So who's stronger?</v>

3502
02:45:58.770 --> 02:46:01.480
<v Speaker 4>No terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kids for 20 minutes.</v>

3503
02:46:01.481 --> 02:46:02.770
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was back.</v>

3504
02:46:02.771 --> 02:46:03.700
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>

3505
02:46:03.701 --> 02:46:08.701
<v Speaker 4>he worked out a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he obviously had some sort of weak </v>

3506
02:46:08.701 --> 02:46:10.100
<v Speaker 4>leak in a system like and of course you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can mitigate</v>

3507
02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:12.270
<v Speaker 2>that right by better training practices,</v>

3508
02:46:12.460 --> 02:46:17.460
<v Speaker 6>but the thing is a bad example because I</v>
<v Speaker 6>think anyone can overload their system </v>

3509
02:46:17.460 --> 02:46:20.150
<v Speaker 6>and an unnatural way and then that's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>huge issue with weightlifting,</v>

3510
02:46:20.170 --> 02:46:22.570
<v Speaker 6>especially with people do isolation </v>
<v Speaker 6>exercises.</v>

3511
02:46:22.810 --> 02:46:27.070
<v Speaker 6>I'm a big proponent of functional </v>
<v Speaker 6>strength exercises like full body weight</v>

3512
02:46:27.071 --> 02:46:32.071
<v Speaker 6>x or full body movements and things </v>
<v Speaker 6>along those lines and that's something </v>

3513
02:46:32.071 --> 02:46:35.821
<v Speaker 6>that for a long time people just weren't</v>
<v Speaker 6>even aware of this,</v>

3514
02:46:35.880 --> 02:46:40.880
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this sort of crossfit type Olympic body </v>

3515
02:46:40.880 --> 02:46:43.000
<v Speaker 6>lift body weight or Olympic lifting </v>
<v Speaker 6>style,</v>

3516
02:46:43.001 --> 02:46:48.001
<v Speaker 6>a full body exercise thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's like fairly recent as far as </v>

3517
02:46:48.001 --> 02:46:50.230
<v Speaker 6>trends.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For the longest time everybody was doing</v>

3518
02:46:50.231 --> 02:46:52.810
<v Speaker 6>like preacher curls,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which are just ridiculous,</v>

3519
02:46:53.650 --> 02:46:54.090
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

3520
02:46:54.460 --> 02:46:54.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

3521
02:46:55.120 --> 02:46:55.960
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3522
02:46:56.110 --> 02:47:00.910
<v Speaker 2>it has come in the last 10 years to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole different level of functional,</v>

3523
02:47:01.210 --> 02:47:04.240
<v Speaker 2>so I think I'm just calling for it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>become even more functional,</v>

3524
02:47:04.450 --> 02:47:07.420
<v Speaker 2>like real functional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like stuff that you would actually do in</v>

3525
02:47:07.421 --> 02:47:07.930
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

3526
02:47:08.350 --> 02:47:09.020
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I'm,</v>

3527
02:47:09.021 --> 02:47:11.800
<v Speaker 6>I'm fascinated by your approach,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I just wonder how Ab,</v>

3528
02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:14.970
<v Speaker 6>how practical it would be for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>average person.</v>

3529
02:47:15.030 --> 02:47:18.850
<v Speaker 6>You seem to have engineered your life in</v>
<v Speaker 6>order to do it this way and it's great.</v>

3530
02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:24.000
<v Speaker 6>It's wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I just wonder how many other people </v>

3531
02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.431
<v Speaker 6>could sort of apply that to their lives </v>
<v Speaker 6>unless they had some sort of a mean.</v>

3532
02:47:26.580 --> 02:47:29.350
<v Speaker 6>You have to have a lot of freedom to do </v>
<v Speaker 6>what you're doing,</v>

3533
02:47:29.410 --> 02:47:31.360
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what does your husband do?</v>

3534
02:47:32.820 --> 02:47:37.820
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a job that works with you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've just run our company from online,</v>

3535
02:47:39.341 --> 02:47:39.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3536
02:47:40.360 --> 02:47:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I have a podcast and the blog and write </v>
<v Speaker 2>books and stuff.</v>

3537
02:47:43.330 --> 02:47:45.880
<v Speaker 2>As your podcast Katie says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Katie says,</v>

3538
02:47:46.090 --> 02:47:49.920
<v Speaker 2>so just talks about this kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Breaking it down though and in,</v>

3539
02:47:50.070 --> 02:47:52.600
<v Speaker 2>in much smaller bites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

3540
02:47:52.601 --> 02:47:57.601
<v Speaker 2>we were very fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We worked hard to get to this point </v>

3541
02:47:57.601 --> 02:48:00.520
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were just managing me and and what I,</v>

3542
02:48:00.700 --> 02:48:02.950
<v Speaker 2>what I produce and speaking do lesbian.</v>

3543
02:48:03.620 --> 02:48:08.620
<v Speaker 6>So he's like sort of like a manager or a</v>
<v Speaker 6>coworker with you and sort of helps you </v>

3544
02:48:08.661 --> 02:48:09.890
<v Speaker 6>along with what you're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3545
02:48:10.050 --> 02:48:11.730
<v Speaker 2>we're both also raising the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3546
02:48:11.731 --> 02:48:13.830
<v Speaker 2>So we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're sharing so there's just like,</v>

3547
02:48:13.831 --> 02:48:16.140
<v Speaker 2>you're just constantly jumping in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tagging in,</v>

3548
02:48:16.141 --> 02:48:21.141
<v Speaker 2>tagging out and in taking turns working </v>
<v Speaker 2>at night and someone works at early in </v>

3549
02:48:21.141 --> 02:48:23.170
<v Speaker 2>the morning and just getting all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things done that need to.</v>

3550
02:48:23.230 --> 02:48:28.230
<v Speaker 2>He used to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used you guys became the grizzly </v>

3551
02:48:28.230 --> 02:48:28.290
<v Speaker 2>Adams family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was an editor,</v>

3552
02:48:28.530 --> 02:48:33.530
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a magazine article editor sees a </v>

3553
02:48:33.530 --> 02:48:35.940
<v Speaker 2>copy editor and a lot of just kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>jack of all trades just writing.</v>

3554
02:48:35.941 --> 02:48:37.600
<v Speaker 2>So it's helped me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Producing,</v>

3555
02:48:37.620 --> 02:48:37.930
<v Speaker 2>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

3556
02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:43.440
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I bet that sitting down writing all </v>

3557
02:48:43.440 --> 02:48:45.721
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's probably really aware of what </v>

3558
02:48:45.721 --> 02:48:46.800
<v Speaker 6>you're talking about and the issues that</v>
<v Speaker 6>people that do that kind of thing face I</v>

3559
02:48:46.810 --> 02:48:50.530
<v Speaker 6>was probably attractive to him to sort </v>
<v Speaker 6>of pursue what you're advocating.</v>

3560
02:48:50.570 --> 02:48:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

3561
02:48:51.150 --> 02:48:55.490
<v Speaker 2>and it's funny because he was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was total a barefoot guy,</v>

3562
02:48:55.690 --> 02:48:57.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3563
02:48:57.051 --> 02:49:00.470
<v Speaker 2>just now I didn't know this about him </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was in college here in La.</v>

3564
02:49:00.490 --> 02:49:02.510
<v Speaker 2>He's Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's Kinda like the big Lebowski.</v>

3565
02:49:02.930 --> 02:49:07.930
<v Speaker 2>My husband is very similar to if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know who the character of the big </v>

3566
02:49:07.930 --> 02:49:07.930
<v Speaker 2>Lebowski is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's Kinda like,</v>

3567
02:49:07.930 --> 02:49:11.670
<v Speaker 2>it's Kinda like that guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the dude is just kind of a cool </v>

3568
02:49:11.670 --> 02:49:11.670

02:49:11.700 --> 02:49:14.190
<v Speaker 2>and he was barefoot like in a bathrobe a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of the time.</v>

3570
02:49:14.191 --> 02:49:17.260
<v Speaker 2>So he was already had this barefoot </v>
<v Speaker 2>component and then he worked in New York</v>

3571
02:49:17.260 --> 02:49:17.510
<v Speaker 2>City,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3572
02:49:17.560 --> 02:49:22.560
<v Speaker 2>barefoot in a bathrobe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of the time getting an </v>

3573
02:49:22.560 --> 02:49:23.100
<v Speaker 2>ingredients for his white Russians.</v>

3574
02:49:25.750 --> 02:49:30.750
<v Speaker 6>Like the big Lebowski,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the dude from big Lebowski rights </v>

3575
02:49:30.750 --> 02:49:30.850
<v Speaker 6>is the dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's like the dude.</v>

3576
02:49:31.420 --> 02:49:32.790
<v Speaker 6>He's a stoner then.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3577
02:49:32.980 --> 02:49:37.980
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a good place for you to be the </v>

3578
02:49:37.980 --> 02:49:37.980
<v Speaker 6>Pacific northwest.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a good place for stoners.</v>

3579
02:49:37.980 --> 02:49:38.770
<v Speaker 6>It's right here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's everywhere up there.</v>

3580
02:49:38.771 --> 02:49:40.900
<v Speaker 6>It's grown wild Washington man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3581
02:49:40.901 --> 02:49:42.430
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Washington is one of the few states that</v>

3582
02:49:42.431 --> 02:49:47.431
<v Speaker 6>had the courage to make it legal sounds </v>
<v Speaker 6>Oregon now and some couple other places </v>

3583
02:49:47.441 --> 02:49:49.850
<v Speaker 6>is going to become legal too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3584
02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:52.630
<v Speaker 6>I think what you're doing is really </v>
<v Speaker 6>fascinating.</v>

3585
02:49:52.631 --> 02:49:53.620
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>

3586
02:49:53.621 --> 02:49:57.190
<v Speaker 6>I just wonder how many people could </v>
<v Speaker 6>actually apply it to their life,</v>

3587
02:49:57.191 --> 02:49:59.300
<v Speaker 6>but I think it's really cool that you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>doing it.</v>

3588
02:49:59.330 --> 02:50:03.280
<v Speaker 6>I think it's really cool that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 6>sort of documenting it and explain it.</v>

3589
02:50:03.520 --> 02:50:05.170
<v Speaker 6>And do you talk about this kind of stuff</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot?</v>

3590
02:50:05.171 --> 02:50:05.980
<v Speaker 6>And Katie says,</v>

3591
02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:07.150
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

3592
02:50:07.151 --> 02:50:08.920
<v Speaker 2>People have questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think their questions are like,</v>

3593
02:50:08.921 --> 02:50:11.290
<v Speaker 2>how do I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I do it?</v>

3594
02:50:11.291 --> 02:50:16.291
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people tweet me their pictures of </v>

3595
02:50:16.291 --> 02:50:18.210
<v Speaker 2>like here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's me sitting on the floor in front </v>

3596
02:50:18.210 --> 02:50:18.210
<v Speaker 2>of my couch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3597
02:50:18.210 --> 02:50:22.980
<v Speaker 2>the couch is still there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're just sitting on the floor </v>

3598
02:50:22.980 --> 02:50:22.980
<v Speaker 2>and fun of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or we have indoor monkey bars,</v>

3599
02:50:22.980 --> 02:50:25.330
<v Speaker 2>so they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that even if we're inside,</v>

3600
02:50:25.331 --> 02:50:27.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kids can still train,</v>

3601
02:50:27.071 --> 02:50:32.071
<v Speaker 2>we can all train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they just kind of go down the </v>

3602
02:50:32.071 --> 02:50:32.071
<v Speaker 2>kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3603
02:50:32.280 --> 02:50:34.890
<v Speaker 2>you guys are freaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

02:50:34.930 --> 02:50:36.760
<v Speaker 2>So are lots of other people now.</v>

3605

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3606
02:50:37.940 --> 02:50:39.740
<v Speaker 6>people come over my house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I'm a freak too.</v>

3607
02:50:39.741 --> 02:50:41.240
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're all freaks in our own little weird</v>

3608
02:50:41.241 --> 02:50:41.760
<v Speaker 6>way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

3609
02:50:41.940 --> 02:50:46.940
<v Speaker 6>But I think you were.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Freakiness is a very healthy and I'm </v>

3610
02:50:46.940 --> 02:50:47.450
<v Speaker 6>conscientious freakiness and they'd say </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's pretty.</v>

3611
02:50:47.451 --> 02:50:49.820
<v Speaker 6>Obviously you're thinking this is not </v>
<v Speaker 6>just something,</v>

3612
02:50:49.821 --> 02:50:54.821
<v Speaker 6>you're just jumping into this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You put a great deal of thought into </v>

3613
02:50:54.821 --> 02:50:54.821
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3614
02:50:54.821 --> 02:50:55.980

<v Speaker 6>what kind of criticisms do you get?</v>

3615
02:50:55.981 --> 02:50:58.030
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure you must get criticisms because</v>

3618
02:51:01.850 --> 02:51:04.730
<v Speaker 6>The fact that you have not yet </v>
<v Speaker 6>vaccinated your kids.</v>

3619
02:51:04.940 --> 02:51:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>publicly than I don't.</v>

3624
02:51:17.180 --> 02:51:18.320

<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

3626
02:51:19.220 --> 02:51:23.450
<v Speaker 2>there's just a timeline like I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I at what I didn't do as do early,</v>

3627
02:51:23.780 --> 02:51:24.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vaccines.</v>

3628
02:51:24.681 --> 02:51:28.400
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work with a lot of people in medicine,</v>

3629
02:51:28.520 --> 02:51:33.520
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I just have the way that I'm </v>

3630
02:51:33.520 --> 02:51:34.340
<v Speaker 2>doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

3631
02:51:35.180 --> 02:51:37.450
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it is a big,</v>

3632
02:51:37.510 --> 02:51:39.430
<v Speaker 6>that's a hot topic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is a hot topic.</v>

3633
02:51:39.720 --> 02:51:42.680
<v Speaker 6>It's a hot topic in terms of criticism </v>
<v Speaker 6>as well.</v>

3634
02:51:42.780 --> 02:51:47.780
<v Speaker 6>People love to jump on people that </v>
<v Speaker 6>aren't vaccinating their kids or jump </v>

3635
02:51:47.780 --> 02:51:51.570
<v Speaker 6>in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anyone who's trying to connect any </v>

3636
02:51:51.570 --> 02:51:51.790
<v Speaker 6>vaccinations towards any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>ailments and diseases.</v>

3637
02:51:51.791 --> 02:51:52.950
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

3638
02:51:53.170 --> 02:51:58.170
<v Speaker 6>I've talked to many doctors and that are</v>
<v Speaker 6>pro vaccine that think that the </v>

3639
02:51:59.171 --> 02:52:04.171
<v Speaker 6>protocols that we instill as far as like</v>
<v Speaker 6>everyone being subscribed to the same,</v>

3640
02:52:06.100 --> 02:52:09.880
<v Speaker 6>like this is probably not the best way </v>
<v Speaker 6>to deal with anything biological because</v>

3641
02:52:09.881 --> 02:52:14.881
<v Speaker 6>people have so much bio diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's so much difference between one </v>

3642
02:52:14.881 --> 02:52:19.831
<v Speaker 6>thing that will make someone terribly </v>
<v Speaker 6>ill and the same exact substance,</v>

3643
02:52:20.051 --> 02:52:25.051
<v Speaker 6>one effect someone at all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it's allergies or sensitivities </v>

3644
02:52:25.051 --> 02:52:29.101
<v Speaker 6>to certain medications.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's just you're going to run the </v>

3645
02:52:29.101 --> 02:52:29.101
<v Speaker 6>risk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially when you're,</v>

3646
02:52:29.101 --> 02:52:32.770
<v Speaker 6>you're introducing a lot of chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 6>into a very young immune system.</v>

3647
02:52:32.771 --> 02:52:33.820
<v Speaker 6>A very young child.</v>

3648
02:52:33.990 --> 02:52:34.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

3649
02:52:35.780 --> 02:52:37.320
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would agree there's a,</v>

3650
02:52:37.321 --> 02:52:42.321
<v Speaker 2>there's a timing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a timing issue for us in the </v>

3651
02:52:42.321 --> 02:52:43.540
<v Speaker 2>way that we wanted to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3652
02:52:43.630 --> 02:52:46.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really even a,</v>

3653
02:52:47.070 --> 02:52:52.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't really believe that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>vaccinations are tied to any ailment or </v>

3654
02:52:52.070 --> 02:52:52.170
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's not,</v>

3655
02:52:52.230 --> 02:52:56.220
<v Speaker 2>that's not my bag at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just more like there is like,</v>

3656
02:52:56.630 --> 02:53:01.630
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a load I think of just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>load to the body as a whole and watching</v>

3657
02:53:02.660 --> 02:53:07.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm wanting my children to process and </v>
<v Speaker 2>develop certain things first where you </v>

3658
02:53:10.861 --> 02:53:11.760
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the risk of,</v>

3659
02:53:12.360 --> 02:53:14.820
<v Speaker 2>of any overload or mismatch as you call </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3660
02:53:14.821 --> 02:53:19.821
<v Speaker 2>Like in terms of biology and medicine </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's just less of a less of a new </v>

3661
02:53:19.980 --> 02:53:20.880
<v Speaker 2>new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3662
02:53:20.881 --> 02:53:25.881
<v Speaker 2>the structure is a little bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more formed and more able to process </v>

3663
02:53:26.550 --> 02:53:27.570
<v Speaker 2>anything that you put into it.</v>

3664
02:53:27.820 --> 02:53:30.450
<v Speaker 6>It seems like there's an issue with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3665
02:53:30.490 --> 02:53:35.490
<v Speaker 6>some parents where some parents want to </v>
<v Speaker 6>criticize people that are raising their </v>

3666
02:53:35.490 --> 02:53:40.411
<v Speaker 6>kids in a different way and they do it </v>
<v Speaker 6>for either because they don't like the </v>

3667
02:53:40.411 --> 02:53:42.370
<v Speaker 6>way it makes them examined,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the way they're raising their kids.</v>

3668
02:53:42.371 --> 02:53:47.371
<v Speaker 6>So they get,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they do it defensively or they're </v>

3669
02:53:47.371 --> 02:53:49.591
<v Speaker 6>judgmental or you know that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 6>thinks they're doing it the right way </v>

3670
02:53:49.591 --> 02:53:49.591
<v Speaker 6>and then everybody else is doing it the </v>
<v Speaker 6>wrong way.</v>

3671
02:53:49.600 --> 02:53:54.600
<v Speaker 6>Do you face a lot of that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because this is a very unconventional </v>

3672
02:53:54.600 --> 02:53:54.600
<v Speaker 6>way of raising children?</v>

3673
02:53:54.600 --> 02:53:55.590
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's I think out of all the.</v>

3674
02:53:55.610 --> 02:54:00.610
<v Speaker 2>If I got any criticisms it would be for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that,</v>

3675
02:54:00.870 --> 02:54:05.280
<v Speaker 2>for the way that we want to raise our </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids and I,</v>

3676
02:54:06.090 --> 02:54:09.390
<v Speaker 2>and I don't have any problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way that anyone wants to raise her kids.</v>

3677
02:54:09.391 --> 02:54:14.391
<v Speaker 2>Like this is just what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just what we're doing and this </v>

3678
02:54:14.391 --> 02:54:16.751
<v Speaker 2>is what we're trying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just happened to be in a more public </v>

3679
02:54:16.751 --> 02:54:16.751
<v Speaker 2>format and I'm writing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm,</v>

3680
02:54:16.751 --> 02:54:21.741
<v Speaker 2>I'm making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's very conscious biomechanical </v>

3681
02:54:21.741 --> 02:54:23.220
<v Speaker 2>choices of why I'm doing what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I got to go,</v>

3682
02:54:23.221 --> 02:54:28.221
<v Speaker 2>here's the process of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanotransduction and here's the list </v>

3683
02:54:28.221 --> 02:54:30.090
<v Speaker 2>of diseases and here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the known environments.</v>

3684
02:54:30.091 --> 02:54:32.160
<v Speaker 2>And so here's the environments that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're changing.</v>

3685
02:54:32.161 --> 02:54:35.580
<v Speaker 2>So in that way it's kind of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an experiment in,</v>

3686
02:54:36.090 --> 02:54:37.410
<v Speaker 2>in current process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3687
02:54:37.411 --> 02:54:38.580
<v Speaker 2>That we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're doing.</v>

3688
02:54:38.581 --> 02:54:39.210
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3689
02:54:39.540 --> 02:54:42.630
<v Speaker 2>I think the worst thing I was ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>called by someone,</v>

3690
02:54:43.240 --> 02:54:45.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a comment section and I don't spend.</v>

3691
02:54:45.630 --> 02:54:49.230
<v Speaker 2>I spent almost zero time reading </v>
<v Speaker 2>comments or whatever.</v>

3692
02:54:49.231 --> 02:54:51.440
<v Speaker 2>It's not my sound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My thing is smart.</v>

3693
02:54:51.870 --> 02:54:52.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>

3694
02:54:52.891 --> 02:54:57.891
<v Speaker 2>I feel like the quality of interaction </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't someone who is really wanting to </v>

3695
02:54:57.891 --> 02:54:59.710
<v Speaker 2>have a thoughtful discussion with me to.</v>

3696
02:55:00.150 --> 02:55:01.540
<v Speaker 6>Unless you really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's,</v>

3697
02:55:01.640 --> 02:55:04.220
<v Speaker 6>it's hard to manage those things too if </v>
<v Speaker 6>you can.</v>

3698
02:55:05.220 --> 02:55:08.150
<v Speaker 6>No one wants censorship,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you've got to eliminate assholes.</v>

3699
02:55:08.210 --> 02:55:13.210
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not like censorship as far as the </v>

3700
02:55:13.210 --> 02:55:14.030
<v Speaker 6>way the ideas are expressed or the ideas</v>
<v Speaker 6>themselves.</v>

3701
02:55:14.180 --> 02:55:19.180
<v Speaker 6>It's the way they're expressed in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>insulting manner in which people can do </v>

3702
02:55:19.180 --> 02:55:21.380
<v Speaker 6>it anonymously.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If there was some reason to not.</v>

3703
02:55:21.630 --> 02:55:25.070
<v Speaker 6>If there's some way to not have it be </v>
<v Speaker 6>anonymous and that you would see,</v>

3704
02:55:26.170 --> 02:55:29.390
<v Speaker 6>then all of a sudden you're interacting </v>
<v Speaker 6>with some person and what's lacking is a</v>

3705
02:55:29.391 --> 02:55:34.391
<v Speaker 6>social cue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there's things that people will tell </v>

3706
02:55:34.391 --> 02:55:34.520
<v Speaker 6>you things in online that they would </v>
<v Speaker 6>never tell you,</v>

3707
02:55:35.270 --> 02:55:38.270
<v Speaker 6>just looking at you in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if they did,</v>

3708
02:55:38.271 --> 02:55:40.760
<v Speaker 6>they would be completely socially </v>
<v Speaker 6>retarded to do that.</v>

3709
02:55:40.970 --> 02:55:42.960
<v Speaker 6>But just it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no consequences.</v>

3710
02:55:42.970 --> 02:55:47.970
<v Speaker 6>Just typing something shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the one thing that you can glean </v>

3711
02:55:47.970 --> 02:55:50.870
<v Speaker 6>that you can get from that is that all </v>
<v Speaker 6>those people were socially retarded.</v>

3712
02:55:51.260 --> 02:55:52.850
<v Speaker 6>Anyone who does that like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

3713
02:55:52.851 --> 02:55:57.851
<v Speaker 6>you're input is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not valid because your input like </v>

3714
02:55:57.851 --> 02:55:58.550
<v Speaker 6>this insulting thing that you've </v>
<v Speaker 6>written,</v>

3715
02:55:58.610 --> 02:56:00.110
<v Speaker 6>you've written that because you're an </v>
<v Speaker 6>idiot.</v>

3716
02:56:00.280 --> 02:56:01.820
<v Speaker 6>Like that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the only reason why you do it.</v>

3717
02:56:01.821 --> 02:56:06.821
<v Speaker 6>If you're a sensitive person or if </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're a person that considers that </v>

3718
02:56:06.821 --> 02:56:06.821
<v Speaker 6>person,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the other analyst I person,</v>

3719
02:56:06.821 --> 02:56:09.380
<v Speaker 6>obviously he's doing something horribly </v>
<v Speaker 6>racist or sexist or whatever,</v>

3720
02:56:09.381 --> 02:56:09.860
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

3721
02:56:09.861 --> 02:56:11.600
<v Speaker 6>In some way that victimizes other </v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

3722
02:56:11.750 --> 02:56:16.750
<v Speaker 6>you're just talking about someone's </v>
<v Speaker 6>opinions and ideas and doing so in a </v>

3723
02:56:16.750 --> 02:56:19.451
<v Speaker 6>very insulting way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're doing so because you're an </v>

3724
02:56:19.451 --> 02:56:19.451
<v Speaker 6>emotionally stunted fuckhead.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

3725
02:56:19.451 --> 02:56:20.240
<v Speaker 6>that's what you are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so that's why you're.</v>

3726
02:56:20.500 --> 02:56:25.500
<v Speaker 6>That's why you're drawn to this </v>
<v Speaker 6>anonymous contribution in the first </v>

3727
02:56:25.500 --> 02:56:25.690
<v Speaker 6>place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whereas the ver,</v>

3728
02:56:25.910 --> 02:56:30.910
<v Speaker 6>the large majority of people and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>watch a youtube video will not leave a </v>

3729
02:56:30.910 --> 02:56:30.910
<v Speaker 6>comment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3730
02:56:30.910 --> 02:56:35.560
<v Speaker 6>The large majority and the people that </v>
<v Speaker 6>do the overwhelming number of negative </v>

3731
02:56:35.751 --> 02:56:40.751
<v Speaker 6>comments like it's represents way more </v>
<v Speaker 6>than I think the average population </v>

3732
02:56:41.271 --> 02:56:44.720
<v Speaker 6>because you're dealing with a sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>stunted group in the first place.</v>

3733
02:56:44.950 --> 02:56:48.440
<v Speaker 6>I think you're already.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's already a certain type of person</v>

3734
02:56:48.690 --> 02:56:50.750
<v Speaker 6>who will comment so you're not looking </v>
<v Speaker 6>at.</v>

3735
02:56:51.170 --> 02:56:53.780
<v Speaker 6>You're not looking at a good cross </v>
<v Speaker 6>section of humanity.</v>

3736
02:56:53.781 --> 02:56:58.781
<v Speaker 6>I don't think when you're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 6>youtube comments like I have a message </v>

3737
02:56:58.781 --> 02:56:59.480
<v Speaker 6>board and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's amazing that mean had,</v>

3738
02:56:59.690 --> 02:57:02.810
<v Speaker 6>I've had it since 1998 and that there's </v>
<v Speaker 6>always going to be assholes.</v>

3739
02:57:02.840 --> 02:57:07.840
<v Speaker 6>There's a certain amount of assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you just going to get a certain </v>

3740
02:57:07.840 --> 02:57:07.840
<v Speaker 6>amount.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People,</v>

3741
02:57:07.840 --> 02:57:08.360
<v Speaker 6>they just want attention so they just </v>
<v Speaker 6>want to be shitty and insulting.</v>

3742
02:57:08.750 --> 02:57:13.750
<v Speaker 6>But the intelligent discussions that the</v>
<v Speaker 6>large majority have intelligent </v>

3743
02:57:13.750 --> 02:57:16.070
<v Speaker 6>discussions and an interesting different</v>
<v Speaker 6>viewpoints.</v>

3744
02:57:16.071 --> 02:57:21.071
<v Speaker 6>And once people get away from this idea </v>
<v Speaker 6>of just a demanding attention by just </v>

3745
02:57:22.250 --> 02:57:27.250
<v Speaker 6>being just shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is what a lot of people do in </v>

3746
02:57:27.250 --> 02:57:29.780
<v Speaker 6>these social network forums,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it's twitter or facebook,</v>

3747
02:57:30.050 --> 02:57:32.030
<v Speaker 6>they get more attention by being shitty.</v>

3748
02:57:32.500 --> 02:57:33.980
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but once you get past that,</v>

3749
02:57:34.010 --> 02:57:37.100
<v Speaker 6>like you can find communities,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can cultivate communities,</v>

3750
02:57:37.220 --> 02:57:42.220
<v Speaker 6>but it's hard to do without some form of</v>
<v Speaker 6>regulation when you regulate your </v>

3751
02:57:42.220 --> 02:57:43.520
<v Speaker 6>sensor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so it becomes like,</v>

3752
02:57:43.680 --> 02:57:44.960
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's going on in France right now,</v>

3753
02:57:44.961 --> 02:57:45.830
<v Speaker 6>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right with the,</v>

3754
02:57:45.831 --> 02:57:46.880
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

3755
02:57:47.110 --> 02:57:48.380
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cartoonists,</v>

3756
02:57:48.460 --> 02:57:50.270
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these people that were killed,</v>

3757
02:57:50.480 --> 02:57:55.480
<v Speaker 6>well now Francis arrested like 60 people</v>
<v Speaker 6>for making facebook posts that they </v>

3758
02:57:56.061 --> 02:58:01.061
<v Speaker 6>thought were either in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in support of terrorism or criticizing </v>

3759
02:58:01.921 --> 02:58:06.030
<v Speaker 6>their government.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They re arrested a comedian recently for</v>

3760
02:58:06.060 --> 02:58:11.060
<v Speaker 6>some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some comment that he's made about the </v>

3761
02:58:11.060 --> 02:58:13.890
<v Speaker 6>relationship between terrorism and this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

3762
02:58:14.190 --> 02:58:16.020
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this horrible tragedy.</v>

3763
02:58:16.021 --> 02:58:17.670
<v Speaker 6>It's really kind of fucked up because </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

3764
02:58:17.671 --> 02:58:22.671
<v Speaker 6>it's Kinda counterintuitive to the whole</v>
<v Speaker 6>idea that you're supposed to be </v>

3765
02:58:22.671 --> 02:58:23.450
<v Speaker 6>supporting in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the,</v>

3766
02:58:23.820 --> 02:58:26.910
<v Speaker 6>the communities that we have online </v>
<v Speaker 6>right now,</v>

3767
02:58:26.911 --> 02:58:30.060
<v Speaker 6>I think a big part of it is they don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>feel the interaction.</v>

3768
02:58:30.090 --> 02:58:32.490
<v Speaker 6>They just send it out there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>almost like a message in the bottle.</v>

3769
02:58:32.491 --> 02:58:33.860
<v Speaker 6>And you were on the other hand </v>
<v Speaker 6>receiving.</v>

3770
02:58:34.090 --> 02:58:39.090
<v Speaker 6>Do you read all your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of your comments on your board </v>

3771
02:58:39.090 --> 02:58:41.241
<v Speaker 6>still?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I read a lot of the comments on the </v>

3772
02:58:41.241 --> 02:58:41.241
<v Speaker 6>board.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I read a lot of comments on twitter.</v>

3773
02:58:41.241 --> 02:58:42.290
<v Speaker 6>I still interact with people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's like I.</v>

3774
02:58:42.400 --> 02:58:47.400
<v Speaker 6>I believe it's like snake venom like you</v>
<v Speaker 6>get if you just get bitten by a snake </v>

3775
02:58:47.400 --> 02:58:48.390
<v Speaker 6>and never been bitten before,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you kind of fucked.</v>

3776
02:58:48.690 --> 02:58:51.090
<v Speaker 6>But if you get snake venom all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you go,</v>

3777
02:58:51.120 --> 02:58:51.930
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know what that is.</v>

3778
02:58:52.070 --> 02:58:54.450
<v Speaker 6>Some fucking Weirdo.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a good way to say it.</v>

3779
02:58:54.451 --> 02:58:59.451
<v Speaker 6>You could feel the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know I have a very kind kind of group </v>

3780
02:58:59.451 --> 02:59:01.040
<v Speaker 6>of people who read and follow him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Tweet at.</v>

3781
02:59:01.060 --> 02:59:03.100
<v Speaker 6>Very rarely do I get,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3782
02:59:03.120 --> 02:59:05.010
<v Speaker 6>the kind of person,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you occasionally get mean people.</v>

3783
02:59:05.430 --> 02:59:08.670
<v Speaker 6>I mean the biggest one was someone who </v>
<v Speaker 6>said that I was racist.</v>

3784
02:59:08.671 --> 02:59:13.671
<v Speaker 6>I was raising my children is </v>
<v Speaker 6>colonialists and because I didn't have </v>

<v Speaker 6>furniture,</v>
