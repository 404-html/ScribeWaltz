<v Speaker 1>back in the day.</v>

38
00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Terrible by today's standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but back in the day,</v>

<v Speaker 1>people love them.</v>

41
00:01:57.891 --> 00:02:02.891
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't even say that terrible </v>

<v Speaker 1>anorexia through.</v>

45
00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:18.281
<v Speaker 1>I think the woman got serious.</v>

46
00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:19.790
<v Speaker 1>seventies bands that I barely pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to,</v>

47
00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:22.490
<v Speaker 1>but you want to talk about the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have got some fucking stories.</v>

<v Speaker 1>americAn life right there.</v>

52
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.270
<v Speaker 1>You could imagine it was just a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>nother way of living,</v>

53
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.480
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

<v Speaker 1>communication amongst human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

119
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.650
<v Speaker 3>the days I complained,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realize I can't complain.</v>

120
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.530
<v Speaker 3>You definitely can't complain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

121
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean to be a professional entertainer </v>
<v Speaker 3>is probably the luckiest job of all </v>

122
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you made it.</v>

123
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.290
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really deeper than that.</v>

124
00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:25.710
<v Speaker 3>I think that just have a fan base,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

125
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.980
<v Speaker 3>that supportive is the real ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 3>blessing because you know,</v>

126
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.700
<v Speaker 3>guys get record deals all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

127
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.610
<v Speaker 3>some of their music and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

128
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 3>but then it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

129
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:38.770
<v Speaker 3>but then when you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

130
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:41.440
<v Speaker 3>you have a lot of artists that come and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

131
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.560
<v Speaker 3>ended up having like a grassroots </v>
<v Speaker 3>following and they have a fan base that </v>

132
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 3>rides with them then entire career.</v>

133
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.090
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's man,</v>

134
00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a blessing on top of a blessing.</v>

135
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.140
<v Speaker 3>You never know because today's audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

136
00:05:53.141 --> 00:05:54.910
<v Speaker 3>these kids like you one minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hate you the next,</v>

137
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 3>like you want me to hit your next and to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a fan base in that</v>

138
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 4>type of climate and it's awesome.</v>

139
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the thing that it used to be </v>

140
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.400
<v Speaker 1>like if you were a rapper or any kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainer,</v>

141
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.260
<v Speaker 1>you were only as good if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian,</v>

142
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.370
<v Speaker 1>you're only as good as the people got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see you out there.</v>

143
00:06:12.371 --> 00:06:17.371
<v Speaker 1>LIke it was really difficult to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to build a fan base if you weren't on </v>

144
00:06:17.371 --> 00:06:20.941
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you weren't on a television show of </v>

145
00:06:20.941 --> 00:06:20.941
<v Speaker 1>your warrant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:06:20.941 --> 00:06:22.450
<v Speaker 1>a weekly regular guests length the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight show or something like that.</v>

147
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.300
<v Speaker 1>It was really hard for someone like </v>
<v Speaker 1>build a fan base.</v>

148
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.450
<v Speaker 1>But today because of the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rappers,</v>

149
00:06:28.451 --> 00:06:29.470
<v Speaker 1>singers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>musicians,</v>

150
00:06:29.471 --> 00:06:30.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians,</v>

151
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.580
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can kind of keep tabs and just </v>

152
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.580
<v Speaker 1>communicate with people directly.</v>

153
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

154
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.360
<v Speaker 4>And I feel like I caught him was at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning,</v>

155
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:43.361
<v Speaker 4>the early stages of that wave of just </v>
<v Speaker 4>know another way for people to find </v>

156
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 4>music online,</v>
<v Speaker 4>new artists,</v>

157
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>music that you probably wouldn't hear on</v>

158
00:06:47.811 --> 00:06:50.480
<v Speaker 4>the radio stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's quality,</v>

159
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.470
<v Speaker 4>quality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

160
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 4>music and now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things are way more advanced.</v>

161
00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:56.720
<v Speaker 4>Even since when I started,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

162
00:06:56.721 --> 00:06:59.340
<v Speaker 4>when I dropped dead at night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was 2007.</v>

163
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.360
<v Speaker 4>I think the only platform at that time </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I had at my disposal to upload </v>

164
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.251
<v Speaker 4>music was my space and that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally how the world discovered my </v>

165
00:07:09.251 --> 00:07:09.890
<v Speaker 4>voice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

166
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.600
<v Speaker 4>through my space music page.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And how did my space dropped the ball so</v>

167
00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:19.601
<v Speaker 4>hard had the world by the balls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had everybody.</v>

168
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.950
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

169
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody I don't think,</v>

170
00:07:23.631 --> 00:07:25.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't even think they've fallen off </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

171
00:07:25.131 --> 00:07:28.940
<v Speaker 4>I just think that there's just so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just so much out there.</v>

172
00:07:28.941 --> 00:07:31.460
<v Speaker 4>There's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an over abundance of,</v>

173
00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:32.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

174
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.120
<v Speaker 4>like for every facebook there's five </v>
<v Speaker 4>more other facebook's.</v>

175
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.310
<v Speaker 4>Well there's always new ones coming out </v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

176
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.650
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be hard to figure out a new </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing though.</v>

177
00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:41.570
<v Speaker 4>Like what's the new things that involve </v>
<v Speaker 4>video?</v>

178
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.850
<v Speaker 4>What's going to be the new thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Memes and emojis.</v>

179
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.710
<v Speaker 4>I think it's just a combination of </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything just like,</v>

180
00:07:46.711 --> 00:07:51.711
<v Speaker 4>well you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a one stop shop to just anything </v>

181
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:52.280
<v Speaker 4>that you can dick around on the internet</v>
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

182
00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:53.780
<v Speaker 4>It's possible through this</v>

183
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:54.610
<v Speaker 1>app,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

184
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:55.960
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

185
00:07:55.961 --> 00:08:00.961
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you seen that new thing that a </v>

186
00:08:00.961 --> 00:08:03.130
<v Speaker 1>unbox therapy did a video on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

187
00:08:03.131 --> 00:08:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Louis from unbox therapy did this video </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this new iron man tech.</v>

188
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.360
<v Speaker 1>If you go to his page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to unbox therapy.</v>

189
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Iron man for real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called as a youtube video </v>

190
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:15.430
<v Speaker 1>that he put up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane to do.</v>

191
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.150
<v Speaker 1>You're putting on these gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are these goggles rather that cover your</v>

192
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:20.920
<v Speaker 1>cover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your eyes sort of oculus rift style.</v>

193
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.230
<v Speaker 1>but you see everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would see you clearly.</v>

194
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.490
<v Speaker 1>But in front of you there's like icons </v>
<v Speaker 1>and things that I can move around.</v>

195
00:08:27.491 --> 00:08:31.180
<v Speaker 1>I can open things and close them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you do it all with hand gestures.</v>

196
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.630
<v Speaker 1>So like as I'm looking at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I have these glock,</v>

197
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:38.670
<v Speaker 1>these goggles on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be looking at you and I'd see these </v>

198
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:40.861
<v Speaker 1>floating geometric objects like boxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>circles and you can open them up and </v>

199
00:08:40.931 --> 00:08:45.220
<v Speaker 1>close them and move them around and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay places like minority report style.</v>

200
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh she remembers doing that on a screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're going to be able to do it </v>

201
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.221
<v Speaker 1>like in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when tony stark put that helmet on </v>

202
00:08:53.221 --> 00:08:56.900
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be like reality and in </v>

203
00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:56.900
<v Speaker 1>his</v>

204
00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:57.390
<v Speaker 4>words and louis' words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

205
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.750
<v Speaker 4>this guy wants to make the world the </v>
<v Speaker 4>desktop.</v>

206
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.960
<v Speaker 4>The world is your screens while it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>takeaway screens and the screens are </v>

207
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.171
<v Speaker 4>going to be the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You put this thing on and you just see </v>

208
00:09:09.171 --> 00:09:09.171
<v Speaker 4>through it and there's no more screens </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

209
00:09:09.171 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 4>Everything you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do through this.</v>

210
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:15.870
<v Speaker 4>This is his ultimate goal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now there's the like the glasses look </v>

211
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.930
<v Speaker 4>all like fucking gnarly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like some super visor,</v>

212
00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:21.150
<v Speaker 4>virtual reality them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're right up there.</v>

213
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.670
<v Speaker 4>They're pretty big right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But so was the first phone.</v>

214
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.010
<v Speaker 4>Remember those home telephones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those giant boxes?</v>

215
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:34.250
<v Speaker 4>They used to have to crank call people </v>
<v Speaker 4>up and needs to fucking put cables into </v>

216
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.670
<v Speaker 4>holes and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You remember all that.</v>

225
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.530
<v Speaker 4>saves a world in some small way for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>few years.</v>

<v Speaker 4>in like a google glass form for sure.</v>

230
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.340
<v Speaker 4>Well the google glasses is like just a </v>
<v Speaker 4>smaller version of that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>image in real time.</v>

234
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.590
<v Speaker 4>Have you played with it at all?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

235
00:10:19.591 --> 00:10:20.590
<v Speaker 4>I got one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>

236
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.030
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

237
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:22.730
<v Speaker 4>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

238
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went out in the streets a couple times</v>

239
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.870
<v Speaker 4>and I really noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I actually tweeted about this,</v>

240
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.600
<v Speaker 4>tweeted about it because it was so funny</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me.</v>

241
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:33.510
<v Speaker 4>My experience going on public with </v>
<v Speaker 4>google glasses.</v>

242
00:10:33.511 --> 00:10:38.511
<v Speaker 4>People just really thought that I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>either taking a picture of them are </v>

243
00:10:38.511 --> 00:10:41.541
<v Speaker 4>filming them and that when people were </v>
<v Speaker 4>really concerned because there's no </v>

244
00:10:41.541 --> 00:10:41.541
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>recording lie and you could tell it,</v>

245
00:10:41.541 --> 00:10:42.840
<v Speaker 4>there's a lens there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

246
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.470
<v Speaker 4>and especially once you miss people ask </v>
<v Speaker 4>you what it is and you say google glass,</v>

247
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:47.520
<v Speaker 4>people have heard about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

248
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.980
<v Speaker 4>are you filming me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I thought it was interesting,</v>

249
00:10:49.981 --> 00:10:51.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because this is something that like,</v>

250
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might see a celebrity,</v>

251
00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:58.191
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>freak out beCause they're getting </v>

252
00:10:58.191 --> 00:10:58.191
<v Speaker 4>photographed or filmed trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you Know,</v>

253
00:10:58.191 --> 00:11:01.430
<v Speaker 4>live their lives and do something with </v>
<v Speaker 4>their families and try to have some </v>

254
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.881
<v Speaker 4>privacy and then the public really </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't understand why they might freak </v>

255
00:11:04.881 --> 00:11:06.390
<v Speaker 4>out and why that might be intrusive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

256
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:11.690
<v Speaker 4>it's a funny twist for me to walk in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>place and all of a sudden someone's </v>

257
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:11.690
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you filming me?</v>

258
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:11.700
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

259
00:11:11.701 --> 00:11:13.100
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing this?</v>

260
00:11:13.101 --> 00:11:13.650
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

261
00:11:13.651 --> 00:11:18.651
<v Speaker 4>I'm not filming a random person that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>intrusive because I understand that </v>

262
00:11:18.651 --> 00:11:22.311
<v Speaker 4>that's intrusive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it is a potential option for the </v>

263
00:11:22.311 --> 00:11:22.311
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's weird about it,</v>

264
00:11:22.311 --> 00:11:22.590
<v Speaker 4>but it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

265
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:26.880
<v Speaker 4>it was interesting to just see like that</v>
<v Speaker 4>was besides people being like,</v>

266
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:27.510
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's cool,</v>

267
00:11:27.511 --> 00:11:28.650
<v Speaker 4>can I try it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just like,</v>

268
00:11:28.651 --> 00:11:30.110
<v Speaker 4>are you filming me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

269
00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.180
<v Speaker 4>are you filming mary taking a picture at</v>
<v Speaker 4>home?</v>

270
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.630
<v Speaker 4>I supposed to know that you're telling </v>
<v Speaker 4>me the truth,</v>

271
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.730
<v Speaker 4>you kNow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you could just be lying and then</v>

272
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:42.170
<v Speaker 4>even if I take it off it cuts off so </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not like you could see what I'm </v>

273
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:42.170
<v Speaker 4>seeing when I'm doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

274
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.730
<v Speaker 4>They have little cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 4>members stand hope had that fox show way</v>

275
00:11:44.731 --> 00:11:48.790
<v Speaker 4>back then they had little cameras that </v>
<v Speaker 4>would go on glasses like in the eyes,</v>

276
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:54.030
<v Speaker 4>the eyebrow part of a glass and he put </v>
<v Speaker 4>his glasses on and he would walk into </v>

277
00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 4>some and do these pranks</v>

278
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:59.250
<v Speaker 1>and they would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The film was good enough to put on </v>

279
00:11:59.250 --> 00:11:59.250
<v Speaker 1>television and that was a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

280
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:04.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could film stuff and put it </v>
<v Speaker 1>up on your twitter through the google </v>

281
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:05.560
<v Speaker 1>glass and the photos are pretty quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that in a couple of times.</v>

282
00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get crazier than that </v>

283
00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:10.580
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna.</v>

284
00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Get to some point where you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to put contact lenses on or </v>

285
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:13.320
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

286
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.950
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

287
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:20.410
<v Speaker 1>that's wild shit with the contact lenses</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they all have their own.</v>

288
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.430
<v Speaker 1>they get charged with solar power </v>
<v Speaker 1>because your eyes are always open.</v>

289
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Constant solar energy.</v>

290
00:12:27.071 --> 00:12:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technology in my eye though,</v>

291
00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:29.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

292
00:12:29.681 --> 00:12:34.681
<v Speaker 1>I definitely don't want to right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if the problem is everybody has it </v>

293
00:12:37.031 --> 00:12:38.750
<v Speaker 1>and it's awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

294
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would have always been tied to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a phone just because it's so dope.</v>

295
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Like to have a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an incredible thing.</v>

296
00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.770
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather have a cyborg arm before I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a contact,</v>

297
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.350
<v Speaker 1>a cyborg arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

298
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.460
<v Speaker 1>But when you see the real thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sidebar ground,</v>

299
00:12:53.461 --> 00:12:55.690
<v Speaker 1>that really freaks me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is no bullshit.</v>

300
00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:57.430
<v Speaker 1>It really does kind of freak me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

301
00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.920
<v Speaker 1>we watched this video once of a dude </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Australia.</v>

302
00:12:59.921 --> 00:13:02.900
<v Speaker 1>They got his arm and his leg bid off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've seen that exact shit.</v>

303
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.910
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this guy had no army,</v>

304
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:10.930
<v Speaker 1>no leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he walked without a limp and his </v>

305
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:10.930
<v Speaker 1>hands moved around and didn't move as </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

306
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:11.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean it probably couldN't play piano </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that,</v>

307
00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:15.130
<v Speaker 1>but move pretty god damn good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot better than the old ones that came</v>

308
00:13:15.131 --> 00:13:20.131
<v Speaker 1>With the hook style old ones and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking like this guy is still a </v>

309
00:13:20.131 --> 00:13:21.580
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent human,</v>

310
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.760
<v Speaker 1>but he has an artificial arm and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial leg.</v>

311
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Like what if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if the shark bit everything but his</v>

312
00:13:28.811 --> 00:13:31.870
<v Speaker 1>head and they took his head and they put</v>
<v Speaker 1>it on an artificial body.</v>

313
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.570
<v Speaker 1>What would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>THat is that still a person.</v>

314
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.880
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's a person because you got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person's head,</v>

315
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:38.590
<v Speaker 1>but what if they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

316
00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:43.890
<v Speaker 1>this transfer of your head to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial body is not working that </v>

317
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:44.980
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body's rejecTing it.</v>

318
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:50.130
<v Speaker 1>You're head's rejecting the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the good news is we can completely </v>

319
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.060
<v Speaker 1>duplicate your brain and put it in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial head.</v>

320
00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:57.390
<v Speaker 1>So to be like your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except better because it's never going </v>

321
00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:57.490
<v Speaker 1>to get old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to rot away like,</v>

322
00:13:57.491 --> 00:13:58.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you a person then?</v>

323
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think your soul is gone.</v>

324
00:14:01.661 --> 00:14:04.120
<v Speaker 1>At that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to believe that too,</v>

325
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.440
<v Speaker 1>but imagine if that's how people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially created in the first place.</v>

326
00:14:08.441 --> 00:14:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Just what if they slow improvements,</v>

327
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.010
<v Speaker 5>what if they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

328
00:14:13.011 --> 00:14:18.011
<v Speaker 5>we're going to take a snapshot of your </v>
<v Speaker 5>brain right now because we're going to </v>

329
00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:19.550
<v Speaker 5>transfer it to this new body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so anything after this point,</v>

330
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:24.610
<v Speaker 5>you know you're not going to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then in for like 10 minutes before </v>

331
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.750
<v Speaker 5>they pulled the plug on this body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can just abuse the person that death</v>

332
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:31.810
<v Speaker 5>or even your body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not the existential angst</v>

333
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:37.460
<v Speaker 1>dying and having no soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking about playing with </v>

334
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:37.460
<v Speaker 1>someone ball</v>

335
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.150
<v Speaker 5>and you're 40.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Congratulations.</v>

336
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:40.840
<v Speaker 5>Speaking of cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 5>joe,</v>

337
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.830
<v Speaker 5>I just got one added to my car so it </v>
<v Speaker 5>records everything.</v>

338
00:14:43.831 --> 00:14:48.831
<v Speaker 5>Now that my car does and it does it on </v>
<v Speaker 5>gps and then when you watch it on your </v>

339
00:14:48.831 --> 00:14:49.890
<v Speaker 5>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it shows real time.</v>

340
00:14:49.891 --> 00:14:54.050
<v Speaker 5>Google maps and a three 60 view almost </v>
<v Speaker 5>of your car,</v>

341
00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.200
<v Speaker 5>your front.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's pretty interesting.</v>

342
00:14:57.201 --> 00:14:59.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's called roadhog hawk,</v>

343
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:04.160
<v Speaker 5>hawk road hockey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what it does is you just put a </v>

344
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:04.820
<v Speaker 5>memory card in there and it constantly </v>
<v Speaker 5>records.</v>

345
00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.120
<v Speaker 5>Where are the cameras?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The cameras like this little box,</v>

346
00:15:08.121 --> 00:15:12.470
<v Speaker 5>it looks like a baby radar detector that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just put a underneath your,</v>

347
00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.650
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>behind your rear view mirror.</v>

348
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:20.150
<v Speaker 5>So you just put on the windshield right </v>
<v Speaker 5>there and you have to run power.</v>

349
00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:25.151
<v Speaker 5>I just plug mine into my cigarette </v>
<v Speaker 5>lighter and it connects to gps and it </v>

350
00:15:25.151 --> 00:15:27.050
<v Speaker 5>records on a memory card.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where's the cameras?</v>

351
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:31.250
<v Speaker 5>The camera has a wide angle lens so it </v>
<v Speaker 5>gets everything in your car,</v>

352
00:15:31.251 --> 00:15:36.251
<v Speaker 5>the front of your car and it also gets </v>
<v Speaker 5>sound and it attracts everything because</v>

353
00:15:36.471 --> 00:15:38.510
<v Speaker 5>I was just tired of driving around </v>
<v Speaker 5>hollywood,</v>

354
00:15:38.511 --> 00:15:40.150
<v Speaker 5>like going to the comedy store every </v>
<v Speaker 5>night and then,</v>

355
00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.740
<v Speaker 5>and then like almost getting in car </v>
<v Speaker 5>accidents,</v>

356
00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:44.630
<v Speaker 5>crazy crack heads,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like jumping in the street,</v>

357
00:15:44.631 --> 00:15:46.310
<v Speaker 5>like all this shit happening all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

358
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.370
<v Speaker 5>like something's going to happen soon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

359
00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.920
<v Speaker 5>and I don't have this polluted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People have to see this when,</v>

360
00:15:50.921 --> 00:15:51.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in Russia,</v>

361
00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.750
<v Speaker 1>that's when they had those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

362
00:15:52.751 --> 00:15:54.610
<v Speaker 1>those mediators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they caught those.</v>

363
00:15:54.611 --> 00:15:59.611
<v Speaker 1>That's how they caught him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They caught him because those people </v>

364
00:15:59.611 --> 00:16:01.631
<v Speaker 1>have dash cams because apparently I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like fraud and like that kind of shit </v>

365
00:16:01.901 --> 00:16:04.510
<v Speaker 1>like accident of fraud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like super common in Russia.</v>

366
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Like they pull shady moves all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people have those little </v>

367
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:10.960
<v Speaker 1>cameras on the dash to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they could resolve disputes,</v>

368
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:16.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there was a thing that was going </v>

369
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:16.300
<v Speaker 1>around in California for a while where </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were suing people.</v>

370
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.670
<v Speaker 1>They would get an accent on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of people die from it.</v>

371
00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:23.850
<v Speaker 1>They'd get on the highway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get in front of you and slam on the </v>

372
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:24.790
<v Speaker 1>brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he slammed into him and this one dude</v>

373
00:16:24.791 --> 00:16:29.791
<v Speaker 1>who was an illegal alien,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was like all the republicans were </v>

374
00:16:29.791 --> 00:16:30.370
<v Speaker 1>up in arms when he's the only one </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>

375
00:16:30.371 --> 00:16:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Alien does something shady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody freaks the fuck out.</v>

376
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.820
<v Speaker 1>But this student done it a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

377
00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.220
<v Speaker 1>He'd done it a couple of times and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was his move.</v>

378
00:16:39.221 --> 00:16:41.560
<v Speaker 1>That's way it made a lot of money just </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting in front of people,</v>

379
00:16:41.561 --> 00:16:43.270
<v Speaker 1>slam on the crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

380
00:16:43.271 --> 00:16:47.620
<v Speaker 1>but that's a risky fucking shit where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you ain't got nothing to lose.</v>

381
00:16:47.621 --> 00:16:49.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

382
00:16:49.151 --> 00:16:53.880
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's just they're playing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lottery and the promise land just very,</v>

383
00:16:53.881 --> 00:16:55.370
<v Speaker 1>very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the item that</v>

384
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:58.160
<v Speaker 5>item c right there is where you put the </v>
<v Speaker 5>memory card in</v>

385
00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.360
<v Speaker 1>and it's not that big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

386
00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.350
<v Speaker 1>it is kinda like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell perspective wise,</v>

387
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:07.200
<v Speaker 5>it's like a cell phone size basically </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he just like,</v>

388
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.630
<v Speaker 5>I can't even barely even see my mindset </v>
<v Speaker 5>high hidden behind my mirror,</v>

389
00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.480
<v Speaker 1>like a disposable camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was probably the best way to describe</v>

390
00:17:13.481 --> 00:17:14.680
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a disposable camera.</v>

391
00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:16.740
<v Speaker 5>What's cool?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It does like a dvr loop,</v>

392
00:17:16.741 --> 00:17:21.741
<v Speaker 5>like would they like a security </v>
<v Speaker 5>companies do or where they have to film </v>

393
00:17:21.741 --> 00:17:21.741
<v Speaker 5>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a jewelry store or something.</v>

394
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:26.750
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when it gets to the end of the memory </v>

395
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.750
<v Speaker 5>card,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just goes back to the beginning.</v>

396
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.900
<v Speaker 5>Unless you pull it out and save the </v>
<v Speaker 5>files.</v>

397
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:30.280
<v Speaker 5>Records over records,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything over and over and over,</v>

398
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.100
<v Speaker 5>long before people start making porn </v>
<v Speaker 5>with those.</v>

399
00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.160
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know what it's also great.</v>

400
00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:41.420
<v Speaker 5>Automatically turns on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so if you give your car to the valet or </v>

401
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.031

402
00:17:44.031 --> 00:17:46.960
<v Speaker 5>turn it around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm getting at.</v>

00:17:47.941 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 5>That's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>SenD me link valet</v>

405
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Blowing each other in your car won't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>onto your car.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I killed tony with us a lot of times she</v>

434
00:19:09.921 --> 00:19:12.890
<v Speaker 5>was on tmz because her hitachi blew up </v>
<v Speaker 5>in her pussy.</v>

435
00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:13.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

436
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.560
<v Speaker 1>really blow up in airports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You blow it up in her pussy and make it </v>

437
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.390
<v Speaker 1>the equivalent to the mexican dudes </v>
<v Speaker 1>slammed on his brakes on the highway.</v>

438
00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.720
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it the vibrator equivalent?</v>

439
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.040
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it to the breaking crash.</v>

440
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:39.750
<v Speaker 5>What happened is it starts sparking in </v>
<v Speaker 5>flames and smoke starts coming.</v>

441
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Footage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did she start screaming?</v>

442
00:19:42.321 --> 00:19:43.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pussies that good.</v>

443
00:19:43.911 --> 00:19:46.200
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's sparking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

444
00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:51.480
<v Speaker 5>There's the hitachi though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what's weird is that this is not </v>

445
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:51.480
<v Speaker 5>new.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing new about this.</v>

446
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.280
<v Speaker 5>If you look online,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's tons of hitachi's blowing up and</v>

447
00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:56.080
<v Speaker 5>a porn stars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

448
00:19:56.081 --> 00:19:59.350
<v Speaker 5>because it's the only vibrator that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>plug into a wall,</v>

449
00:19:59.351 --> 00:20:04.351
<v Speaker 5>so it's like it's like the dumbest </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's really for your back </v>

450
00:20:04.351 --> 00:20:04.660
<v Speaker 5>because it's supposed to be high </v>
<v Speaker 5>powered,</v>

451
00:20:04.661 --> 00:20:09.661
<v Speaker 5>but like girls are getting so numbed </v>
<v Speaker 5>down there that they're using these </v>

452
00:20:09.661 --> 00:20:12.691
<v Speaker 5>hitachi's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these high powered ones that just shave </v>

453
00:20:12.691 --> 00:20:12.691
<v Speaker 5>off my.</v>

454
00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take things to the next level.</v>

455
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Just like when we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilders have like the 19 sixties in</v>

456
00:20:23.001 --> 00:20:28.001
<v Speaker 1>comparison to the bodybuilders it today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the same way with like the </v>

457
00:20:28.001 --> 00:20:30.260
<v Speaker 1>way girls beat on their pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely embedded in the old days.</v>

458
00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Just a little spit and defenders need </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that didn't need anything.</v>

459
00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:37.520
<v Speaker 1>Their vaginas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're super sensitive technology.</v>

460
00:20:37.521 --> 00:20:42.521
<v Speaker 1>Fuck things up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soda doesn't fuck things up for us </v>

461
00:20:42.521 --> 00:20:44.290
<v Speaker 1>apparently if you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have a for skin,</v>

579
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:09.390

<v Speaker 1>for the unforgiven that I think it's the</v>

580
00:27:09.391 --> 00:27:11.620
<v Speaker 1>greatest cowboy movie of all time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>so dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was such a good,</v>

<v Speaker 1>No movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like I'm not that guy.</v>

587
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.670

<v Speaker 1>And then they just dragged him in.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but he's like one of those dudes that </v>

590
00:27:36.201 --> 00:27:37.350
<v Speaker 1>becomes this old guy and then he becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>like super duper conservative.</v>

591
00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:42.660
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of those guys like </v>

592
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:42.660
<v Speaker 1>cosby's a guy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like super duper conservative now,</v>

593
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:44.400
<v Speaker 1>jon voight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

594
00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:47.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that movie though is one of,</v>

595
00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:52.090
<v Speaker 1>is one of my favorites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially morgan freeman to one of my </v>

596
00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:52.090
<v Speaker 1>favorite morgan freeman movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

597
00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was just a perfect movie.</v>

598
00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the way the women.</v>

599
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:04.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give away the ending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way it all goes down so much </v>

600
00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.311
<v Speaker 1>more likely than most of those stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot 'em up movies that was much more </v>

601
00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:11.310
<v Speaker 1>probably like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the way people would behave.</v>

602
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

603
00:28:12.271 --> 00:28:15.390
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it ended up getting messy in there,</v>

604
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:19.830
<v Speaker 1>but I like how I kind of just started </v>
<v Speaker 1>off like real chill and you kinda just,</v>

605
00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:21.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

606
00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.070
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here.</v>

607
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a fascinating look at the old </v>

608
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:29.000
<v Speaker 1>west.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

609
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.821
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like he did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he did all those westerns back in </v>

610
00:28:31.821 --> 00:28:31.821
<v Speaker 1>the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the good,</v>

611
00:28:31.821 --> 00:28:33.540
<v Speaker 1>the bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ugly and fun movies.</v>

612
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.530
<v Speaker 1>But they weren't super realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

613
00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.110
<v Speaker 1>and I think as he got older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm just speculating,</v>

614
00:28:40.111 --> 00:28:43.260
<v Speaker 1>but he wanted to do one more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That really got it right,</v>

615
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:48.500
<v Speaker 1>like the way they make movies today as </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to way they made movies back in </v>

616
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.400
<v Speaker 1>like high plains drifter days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see true grit?</v>

617
00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw both.</v>

618
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.310
<v Speaker 1>I saw the old one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new one.</v>

619
00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.020
<v Speaker 1>It was not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew what it was.</v>

620
00:28:55.021 --> 00:28:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was not a bad mood.</v>

621
00:28:56.291 --> 00:29:01.291
<v Speaker 1>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just whenever you have a movie </v>

622
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:01.680
<v Speaker 1>where you're redoing an old movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are harsh,</v>

623
00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.840
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

624
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:05.220
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

625
00:29:05.221 --> 00:29:07.380
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it kind of brought some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that realness that,</v>

626
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:08.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unforgiven hand.</v>

627
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it definitely did.</v>

628
00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was doubt.</v>

629
00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:14.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a good movie for sure.</v>

630
00:29:14.041 --> 00:29:15.840
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of fun shit going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie.</v>

631
00:29:15.841 --> 00:29:19.100
<v Speaker 1>But goddamn man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remaking a john wayne movies hard.</v>

632
00:29:19.101 --> 00:29:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh.</v>

633
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

634
00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:22.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hollywood,</v>

635
00:29:22.441 --> 00:29:23.850
<v Speaker 1>they do what they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

636
00:29:23.851 --> 00:29:24.810
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

637
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.540
<v Speaker 1>most of the shit that comes out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives me gurgitate.</v>

638
00:29:27.541 --> 00:29:29.820
<v Speaker 1>It just kind of be hard to make movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

639
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:31.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm blessed with that ability,</v>

642
00:29:35.551 --> 00:29:37.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of guys don't see.</v>

643
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just think of,</v>

644
00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:43.790
<v Speaker 1>think of that like how happy you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you write on your shit and imagine </v>

645
00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:44.560

<v Speaker 1>There's no one else there so they'd go </v>

648
00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.261
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to worry about the </v>

649
00:29:55.261 --> 00:29:57.990
<v Speaker 1>producer getting along with director,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get along with the actor.</v>

650
00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:01.780
<v Speaker 1>The network has notes of studIo rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>has notes about the script,</v>

651
00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:05.920
<v Speaker 1>the screenwriter or wants to change this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the actor wants to improv that.</v>

652
00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:12.410
<v Speaker 1>You're managing it out with the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>makeup lady who's fucking the </v>

<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

656
00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:20.670
<v Speaker 4>Making the movies go down that in music </v>
<v Speaker 4>though too,</v>

657
00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:25.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my career is just purely my vision and </v>

658
00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:25.820
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's a different,</v>

659
00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:29.070
<v Speaker 4>it's a little unorthodox.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know what most people do,</v>

660
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.850
<v Speaker 4>you know the average,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

661
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:32.730
<v Speaker 4>pop star,</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be about,</v>

662
00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:38.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six people involved just to get the </v>

663
00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:38.090
<v Speaker 4>album together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

664
00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:42.290

<v Speaker 4>If somebody to get the producers in the </v>

665
00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:42.420
<v Speaker 4>room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

666
00:30:42.421 --> 00:30:44.700
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then there could be chemistry's off,</v>

667
00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:49.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this person might not mess with this </v>

668
00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:51.591
<v Speaker 4>writer and this producer might not mess </v>
<v Speaker 4>with this artist and there's all this </v>

669
00:30:51.591 --> 00:30:51.810
<v Speaker 4>going on and I'm pretty sure it gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>messy,</v>

670
00:30:51.811 --> 00:30:56.811
<v Speaker 4>but that's this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've just been blessed not to deal with </v>

671
00:30:56.811 --> 00:30:56.811
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

672
00:30:56.811 --> 00:30:57.010
<v Speaker 4>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had an idea of,</v>

673
00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:02.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I wanted my career to be and I've </v>

674
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.090
<v Speaker 4>been sticking to that goal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

675
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.090
<v Speaker 4>that plan.</v>

676
00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:05.610
<v Speaker 4>What was the idea if you could give us </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a one line of it?</v>

677
00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:10.850
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really just truthfully wanted to tell </v>

678
00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:11.550
<v Speaker 4>my story and hopefully it inspired </v>
<v Speaker 4>others to not feel alone,</v>

679
00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:16.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and understand that they can persevere </v>

680
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:16.610
<v Speaker 4>through anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

681
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:20.211
<v Speaker 4>And at that time of writing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like to tell people I don't even know </v>

682
00:31:20.211 --> 00:31:20.910
<v Speaker 4>if I believed half of this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wrote,</v>

683
00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:21.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when I,</v>

684
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.600
<v Speaker 4>when I may pursue the happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was hopeful for happiness,</v>

685
00:31:24.601 --> 00:31:27.300
<v Speaker 4>but I was in such a dark place at that </v>
<v Speaker 4>song.</v>

686
00:31:27.301 --> 00:31:29.250
<v Speaker 4>For me it was more of a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More than,</v>

687
00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:31.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be a happy,</v>

688
00:31:31.921 --> 00:31:34.080
<v Speaker 4>uplifting song.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You in a dark place.</v>

689
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:35.610
<v Speaker 4>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

690
00:31:35.611 --> 00:31:40.500
<v Speaker 4>just like I think coming to terms with </v>
<v Speaker 4>just the fame factor,</v>

691
00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:41.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always,</v>

692
00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.400
<v Speaker 4>I always felt like I would get some type</v>
<v Speaker 4>of recognition,</v>

693
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:49.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know to what magnitude and you </v>

694
00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:49.460
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people say like,</v>

695
00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:49.460
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

696
00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you signed up for,</v>

697
00:31:50.641 --> 00:31:53.460
<v Speaker 4>but like really don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

698
00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.680
<v Speaker 4>And you kind of have an idea and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel like,</v>

699
00:31:55.681 --> 00:32:00.681
<v Speaker 4>oh that'd be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like I didn't and I still to this </v>

700
00:32:00.681 --> 00:32:02.280
<v Speaker 4>day I don't look in the mirror and see </v>
<v Speaker 4>myself how other people see me,</v>

701
00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.020
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I never,</v>

702
00:32:04.021 --> 00:32:09.021
<v Speaker 4>I never could prepare myself for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for what came and everything came so </v>

703
00:32:09.021 --> 00:32:09.021
<v Speaker 4>fast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

704
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.490
<v Speaker 4>I had so that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that brought on darkness.</v>

705
00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I just,</v>

706
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.620
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't comfortable and then I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

707
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.480
<v Speaker 4>I was in a place where all this </v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure,</v>

708
00:32:18.481 --> 00:32:23.481
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden a to be something and to</v>
<v Speaker 4>deliver a certain type of quality and </v>

709
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:29.640
<v Speaker 4>these are things that I've stepped up to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the plate and I was excited about doing,</v>

710
00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:34.560
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't know that it would stress </v>
<v Speaker 4>me out to that magnitude that it did,</v>

711
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:35.230
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

712
00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:39.530
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't know that many people will</v>
<v Speaker 4>be watching and paying attention or care</v>

713
00:32:39.531 --> 00:32:40.050
<v Speaker 4>that much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you</v>

714
00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.050
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the number one consequence?</v>

715
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:48.850
<v Speaker 1>I just think the end that I didn't see </v>
<v Speaker 1>it being too too big of a consequence </v>

716
00:32:50.511 --> 00:32:53.270
<v Speaker 1>that I couldn't deal with losing a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of my freedom.</v>

717
00:32:53.271 --> 00:32:55.190
<v Speaker 1>But then I have a daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

718
00:32:55.670 --> 00:33:00.670
<v Speaker 1>I just worry so more about her now and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>just want her to have a normal life and </v>

719
00:33:01.341 --> 00:33:02.910
<v Speaker 1>I want her to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

720
00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.860
<v Speaker 1>have that opportunity and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not I think about it more now than I did</v>

721
00:33:06.861 --> 00:33:07.950
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

722
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:10.250
<v Speaker 1>right before she was born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

723
00:33:10.251 --> 00:33:11.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

724
00:33:11.211 --> 00:33:12.440
<v Speaker 1>I have children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you,</v>

725
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:17.710
<v Speaker 1>when you have children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really becomes more about them than </v>

726
00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:21.551
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even about you and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways the way you live your life is now </v>

727
00:33:21.551 --> 00:33:23.540
<v Speaker 1>always going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the best way for them,</v>

728
00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.120
<v Speaker 1>and if it's not that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're goIng to feel sick,</v>

729
00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:26.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

730
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:28.220
<v Speaker 1>You're going to feel like you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong.</v>

731
00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird situation.</v>

732
00:33:30.801 --> 00:33:35.801
<v Speaker 1>When you bring people into this world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're responsible for little tiny </v>

733
00:33:35.801 --> 00:33:37.640
<v Speaker 1>people and you gotta you gotta teach </v>
<v Speaker 1>them shit and raise them and.</v>

734
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one.</v>

735
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:40.020
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

736
00:33:40.021 --> 00:33:45.021
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say no one because I think </v>

737
00:33:45.021 --> 00:33:45.021
<v Speaker 1>people are capable of intellectualizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

738
00:33:45.021 --> 00:33:47.420
<v Speaker 1>but most people have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just put it that way.</v>

739
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:50.300
<v Speaker 1>How intense the love a person has for </v>
<v Speaker 1>their kid is.</v>

740
00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty intense.</v>

741
00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:54.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

742
00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.910
<v Speaker 1>it's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

743
00:33:55.911 --> 00:33:59.030
<v Speaker 1>you have to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a child to experience,</v>

744
00:33:59.031 --> 00:34:00.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't explain it.</v>

745
00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:00.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

746
00:34:00.801 --> 00:34:02.690
<v Speaker 1>it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

747
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:05.300
<v Speaker 1>my is man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she everything.</v>

748
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:08.570
<v Speaker 1>It's also by like when you see kids that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are abused,</v>

749
00:34:08.571 --> 00:34:10.560
<v Speaker 1>it's so extra disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

750
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Because it's almost unimaginable who </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do that?</v>

751
00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Who would do that to anyone's kid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>who would do that to their own kid?</v>

752
00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.430
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

753
00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:21.920
<v Speaker 1>I've met people that have their parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>beat them and it's a fucking weird place</v>

754
00:34:21.921 --> 00:34:26.921
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk to someone who is the person </v>

755
00:34:26.921 --> 00:34:29.501
<v Speaker 1>they love more than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>beats the shit out of them when they do </v>

756
00:34:29.501 --> 00:34:29.810
<v Speaker 1>something wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

757
00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.070
<v Speaker 1>And there's a difference between a </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapon and beating.</v>

758
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this adrian,</v>

759
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:38.450
<v Speaker 1>this nfl thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who beat his kid with a stick,</v>

760
00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:44.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the excuses that I guess like when he </v>

761
00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:44.420
<v Speaker 1>was young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how they treated him.</v>

762
00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:46.320
<v Speaker 1>That's how he was raised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

763
00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the kid did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was so horrible.</v>

764
00:34:48.051 --> 00:34:49.190
<v Speaker 1>How old was this kid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

765
00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:51.610
<v Speaker 1>I man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even be reading into that really</v>

766
00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:52.100
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

767
00:34:52.101 --> 00:34:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Like nine or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

768
00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:56.830
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you know,</v>

769
00:34:56.831 --> 00:34:57.830
<v Speaker 1>when they talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

770
00:34:57.831 --> 00:35:00.140
<v Speaker 1>well this is the way he grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is true.</v>

771
00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:05.140
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be a way to end that </v>

772
00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.391
<v Speaker 1>cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be beaten in kids with sticks </v>

773
00:35:07.391 --> 00:35:07.391
<v Speaker 1>in 2014 and everybody should know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>by now.</v>

774
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.890
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's a cop out for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>to use that as an excuse.</v>

775
00:35:09.891 --> 00:35:13.130
<v Speaker 1>We like those hall was raised even like </v>
<v Speaker 1>just with anything,</v>

776
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:14.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's just a cop out.</v>

777
00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:17.960
<v Speaker 1>That's just somebody not wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change and grow with the times.</v>

778
00:35:17.961 --> 00:35:22.961
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we could find any way to be less </v>

779
00:35:22.961 --> 00:35:22.961
<v Speaker 1>violent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should try it.</v>

780
00:35:22.961 --> 00:35:22.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly.</v>

781
00:35:22.961 --> 00:35:26.981
<v Speaker 1>Anything with these victims involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if the victim is a little </v>

782
00:35:26.981 --> 00:35:27.130
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

783
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:32.290
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get kids used to the idea that </v>

784
00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:34.880
<v Speaker 1>the person they love the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their parents is a person who's going to</v>

785
00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:39.940
<v Speaker 1>beat them and hit them with things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are introducing violence into that </v>

786
00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.911
<v Speaker 1>kid's life at a very early age and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence becomes a natural part of the </v>

787
00:35:43.911 --> 00:35:45.300
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes something they expect.</v>

788
00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:50.660
<v Speaker 1>That's why they say that people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>around their parents beating each other </v>

789
00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:53.460
<v Speaker 1>up are more likely to be involved in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>abusive relationships.</v>

790
00:35:53.461 --> 00:35:56.270
<v Speaker 1>When they get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say that kids,</v>

791
00:35:56.490 --> 00:36:01.490
<v Speaker 1>people who are hit by their parents or </v>
<v Speaker 1>people watched their parents hate each </v>

792
00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:01.980
<v Speaker 1>other and were hit by their parents even</v>
<v Speaker 1>worse apparently.</v>

793
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.730
<v Speaker 1>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

794
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:05.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's to say?</v>

795
00:36:05.581 --> 00:36:07.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom spanked us,</v>

796
00:36:07.231 --> 00:36:12.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she had three boys to deal with by </v>

797
00:36:12.231 --> 00:36:12.420
<v Speaker 1>herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Majority of the time,</v>

798
00:36:12.421 --> 00:36:14.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like,</v>

799
00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:15.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

800
00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

801

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at my mom is a villain and you </v>

802
00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:21.380
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she didn't beat us.</v>

803
00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.770
<v Speaker 4>I can't say like I've been beaten by my </v>
<v Speaker 4>mom did some,</v>

804
00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.290
<v Speaker 4>some hoe ass shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

805

<v Speaker 4>You know what,</v>

806
00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:31.350
<v Speaker 4>you're doing some sucker shit as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

807
00:36:31.351 --> 00:36:33.470
<v Speaker 4>especially before you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

808
00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:36.060
<v Speaker 4>and you know that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a consequence that comes with that.</v>

809
00:36:36.061 --> 00:36:41.061
<v Speaker 4>But I've never experienced that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm pretty sure a lot of </v>

810
00:36:41.821 --> 00:36:45.000
<v Speaker 4>people are talking about right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just like thinking it's okay to beat</v>

811
00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:47.820
<v Speaker 4>up on your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like my daughter's four and a half,</v>

812
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:52.200
<v Speaker 4>I haven't had to reprimand her in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>way and I never will.</v>

813
00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:52.830
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

814
00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

815
00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:59.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a different situation too </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you've got a single mom dealing </v>

816
00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.690
<v Speaker 1>with young sons like shit can get really</v>
<v Speaker 1>unruly.</v>

817
00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:02.810
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like holy.</v>

818
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:05.380
<v Speaker 1>But even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even with that it,</v>

819
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:09.360
<v Speaker 1>they weren't beatings so it's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

820
00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:14.950
<v Speaker 1>That is a big difference and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that people don't like </v>

821
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.950
<v Speaker 1>to admit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

822
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:19.700
<v Speaker 1>It's never good to beat your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're a young woman who's </v>

823
00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:21.770
<v Speaker 1>raising young boys and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect you.</v>

824
00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:27.940
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a yard yardstick and my mom had a </v>

825
00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:29.310
<v Speaker 1>yard stick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you hit on my ass,</v>

826
00:37:29.311 --> 00:37:31.500
<v Speaker 1>but it never hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She would smack and I'm like,</v>

827
00:37:31.501 --> 00:37:32.100
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

828
00:37:32.101 --> 00:37:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I deserve that rating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not like stripped down naked.</v>

829
00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Now after you're out the shower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch you off guard,</v>

830
00:37:41.761 --> 00:37:43.250

<v Speaker 5>them and then make a news.</v>

876
00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:59.620

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:00.771
<v Speaker 5>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a photo of him later where </v>

<v Speaker 5>like bandaged up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking goofy videos?</v>

882
00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:11.730
<v Speaker 5>It's horrible in bullying now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Has taken it to the next level because </v>

883
00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:15.120
<v Speaker 5>kids are all filming them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bullying people and then putting it </v>

884
00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.120
<v Speaker 5>online.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So now it doesn't mean bowling.</v>

885
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:17.650
<v Speaker 5>Bowling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bullying,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're going bowling.</v>

889
00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:27.680
<v Speaker 7>They're going to go away.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I thought that was like a new thing </v>

890
00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:27.680
<v Speaker 7>where you like to roll in a fetal </v>
<v Speaker 7>position.</v>

891
00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:32.800
<v Speaker 7>Pins.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was really trying to figure out what </v>

892
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:32.800
<v Speaker 7>you were saying,</v>

893
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.840
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people are taking videos of them </v>

894
00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.821
<v Speaker 5>beating up other kids and then putting </v>
<v Speaker 5>it online and sharing it around the </v>

895
00:40:38.821 --> 00:40:42.331
<v Speaker 5>class and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So now you just see these videos of </v>

896
00:40:42.331 --> 00:40:42.331
<v Speaker 5>these poor kids.</v>

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:47.370
<v Speaker 1>the acts are already being done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:53.190
<v Speaker 1>we live in a weird times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weird times took where we were talking </v>

902
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:54.130
<v Speaker 1>about earlier about people worrying </v>
<v Speaker 1>about your google glasses,</v>

903
00:40:54.131 --> 00:40:59.131
<v Speaker 1>recording them because they're recording</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and kids are growing up with </v>

904
00:40:59.131 --> 00:41:03.061
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a part of a normal part of </v>

905
00:41:03.061 --> 00:41:03.061
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

906
00:41:03.061 --> 00:41:05.050
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you first got into the internet,</v>

907
00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:10.260
<v Speaker 1>would you say you were in your late high</v>
<v Speaker 1>school days when you really started </v>

908
00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:11.670
<v Speaker 1>getting into it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that was,</v>

909
00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:15.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're 30 now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No computer except at the schoolhouse.</v>

910
00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:20.460
<v Speaker 1>So that was the only time and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't really explore that much.</v>

911
00:41:21.051 --> 00:41:22.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't much out there because.</v>

912
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Well there was stuff out there but I </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean the teachers kept it restricted.</v>

913
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:31.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were some sites you can go to and </v>

914
00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:31.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

917
00:41:35.301 --> 00:41:37.340
<v Speaker 1>They can block stuff now in schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

918
00:41:37.341 --> 00:41:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Do they block stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to man.</v>

919
00:41:39.981 --> 00:41:43.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean the internet is just so much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>on there now than there was back then.</v>

920
00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.100
<v Speaker 1>But do they allow like porn sites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in dorms,</v>

<v Speaker 4>because of my job because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people around me because of the </v>

966
00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:58.080
<v Speaker 4>people I work with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

967
00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:01.380
<v Speaker 4>I always tell people I'm a human being </v>
<v Speaker 4>first before anything,</v>

968
00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:02.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're born naked,</v>

<v Speaker 4>and everything that happens in between,</v>

971
00:44:05.941 --> 00:44:08.370
<v Speaker 4>it's just madness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we figured it out along the way.</v>

972
00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:14.150
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really interesting how a lot of </v>

973
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.150
<v Speaker 4>people just kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>really caught up and I never want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never wanted to be that guy.</v>

977
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:25.950
<v Speaker 4>And the beauty of twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like first I was really against it </v>

978
00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:26.430
<v Speaker 4>because it's just so much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like literally I get a of competence </v>

981
00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:36.000
<v Speaker 4>just by looking at my feet and seeing </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe a couple of tweets that are like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>So like I wasn't really that big.</v>

<v Speaker 4>became famous.</v>

1009
00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.700
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm watching everybody around me,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I want kids to look at me and understand</v>

1012
00:45:54.031 --> 00:45:55.350
<v Speaker 4>what not to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1013
00:45:55.351 --> 00:45:58.140
<v Speaker 4>when I was dealing with my drug issues </v>
<v Speaker 4>back in 2010,</v>

1014
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:59.470
<v Speaker 4>2009,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1015
00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:04.630
<v Speaker 4>I was heavy into cocaine and it was like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a big thing for me to go and it was like</v>

1016
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:12.150
<v Speaker 4>a really big thing for me and it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that kept me level.</v>

1017
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:14.100
<v Speaker 4>It's something that I felt like I needed</v>
<v Speaker 4>self-medicating.</v>

1018
00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.810
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1019
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:17.520
<v Speaker 4>you felt like cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keppra level.</v>

1020
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:20.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I had this whole technique,</v>

1021
00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I even should get into </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1022
00:46:23.431 --> 00:46:26.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't even want to talk about this and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to go run around and talk</v>

1023
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:27.500
<v Speaker 4>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

1024
00:46:27.501 --> 00:46:32.501
<v Speaker 4>Let's just say I got into like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I would call like a </v>

1025
00:46:32.501 --> 00:46:33.180
<v Speaker 4>trifecta,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was,</v>

1026
00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:34.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will wake up in the morning,</v>

1027
00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:38.010
<v Speaker 4>I would know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do coke immediately,</v>

1028
00:46:38.011 --> 00:46:43.011
<v Speaker 4>even before I had cereal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>breakfast and then I would have a beer </v>

1029
00:46:43.011 --> 00:46:47.420
<v Speaker 4>and then I would smoke weed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like I never wanted people to know I </v>

1030
00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.800
<v Speaker 4>was doing cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the beer and the marijuana leveled me</v>

1031
00:46:49.801 --> 00:46:53.450
<v Speaker 4>out in a way where I was able to walk in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the streets and talk and,</v>

1032
00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:58.540
<v Speaker 4>and seem as though I was not anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>but deep inside I'm just like z with my </v>

1033
00:46:58.801 --> 00:47:00.130
<v Speaker 4>face and just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1034
00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:00.600
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

1035
00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:02.730
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what it did for me,</v>

1036
00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:07.980
<v Speaker 4>it completely numb to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't care about anything and I was a</v>

1037
00:47:07.981 --> 00:47:11.910
<v Speaker 4>robot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also with it being so numb,</v>

1038
00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:15.310
<v Speaker 4>it allowed me to go out and meet my fans</v>
<v Speaker 4>and beyond the street.</v>

1039
00:47:15.311 --> 00:47:20.311
<v Speaker 4>So when a twisted way it did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it did a positive thing for me and </v>

1040
00:47:20.311 --> 00:47:21.060
<v Speaker 4>that's why I didn't see it as an issue </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was like damn,</v>

1041
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:26.150
<v Speaker 4>today I went walking in soho with no </v>
<v Speaker 4>place to go and I was just high fiving </v>

1042
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:31.011
<v Speaker 4>fans and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it was just the most amazing </v>

1043
00:47:31.011 --> 00:47:36.001
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that I never get a chance to </v>

1044
00:47:36.001 --> 00:47:37.951
<v Speaker 4>feel because I'm just like such a </v>
<v Speaker 4>recluse and I'm just at that time was </v>

1045
00:47:37.951 --> 00:47:39.730
<v Speaker 4>just weirded out when people recognize </v>
<v Speaker 4>me and just didn't want to go anywhere,</v>

1046
00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:40.720
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1047
00:47:40.721 --> 00:47:44.260
<v Speaker 4>That's an issue with suBstances that can</v>
<v Speaker 4>help you in some ways,</v>

1048
00:47:44.261 --> 00:47:48.880
<v Speaker 4>but they're ultimately detrimental to </v>
<v Speaker 4>your health or wellbeing or your ability</v>

1049
00:47:48.881 --> 00:47:49.900
<v Speaker 4>to keep it together.</v>

1050
00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:51.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I abused it,</v>

1051
00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:57.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not like the guy who like goes out </v>

1052
00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:57.090
<v Speaker 4>with his buddies and spring break and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>says like,</v>

1053
00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:57.090
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's do a pump.</v>

1054
00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:57.640
<v Speaker 4>And it said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1055
00:47:57.641 --> 00:47:58.420
<v Speaker 4>cooL.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1056
00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:03.480
<v Speaker 4>those guys aren't real people in movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody else is just too broke to go.</v>

1057
00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:11.280
<v Speaker 4>They just don't have the amount of money</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it requires to be a fucking </v>

1058
00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.490
<v Speaker 4>fulltime head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was definitely expensive,</v>

1059
00:48:12.491 --> 00:48:13.990
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was definitely expensive.</v>

1060
00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:15.040
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I um,</v>

1061
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:17.200
<v Speaker 4>you find like why you're doing it every </v>
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

1062
00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:19.660
<v Speaker 4>Like was there a thing that made you </v>
<v Speaker 4>stop?</v>

1063
00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:24.900
<v Speaker 4>Because that's usually there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got caught and then people started </v>

1064
00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.200
<v Speaker 4>to know I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1065
00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:27.240
<v Speaker 4>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>damn,</v>

1066
00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:29.380
<v Speaker 4>now everybody knows I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not cool anymore.</v>

1067
00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:32.650
<v Speaker 4>Like it's only cool when no one knows is</v>
<v Speaker 4>a weird one,</v>

1068
00:48:32.651 --> 00:48:33.310
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1069
00:48:33.311 --> 00:48:38.200
<v Speaker 4>It's like I didn't really let you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't let the public made me feel bad</v>

1070
00:48:38.201 --> 00:48:38.700
<v Speaker 4>about it though.</v>

1071
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:39.810
<v Speaker 4>It was just kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck yes,</v>

1072
00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:43.270
<v Speaker 4>I can't do that no more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then also my daughter was born so it</v>

1073
00:48:43.271 --> 00:48:44.430
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1074
00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:48.190
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like to kind of life lessons back</v>

1075
00:48:48.191 --> 00:48:51.730
<v Speaker 4>to back that I experienced in 2010 and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1076
00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:56.970
<v Speaker 4>my daughter's birth and being arrested </v>
<v Speaker 4>were those two things because I think I </v>

1077
00:48:56.970 --> 00:49:00.190
<v Speaker 4>had already started toning down on my </v>
<v Speaker 4>cocaine use the beginning of that year.</v>

1078
00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:05.400
<v Speaker 4>But then I was the king of like </v>
<v Speaker 4>something tragic happened at or </v>

1079
00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.300
<v Speaker 4>something I felt was tragical stressful </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then spiraling back into it.</v>

1080
00:49:07.301 --> 00:49:12.301
<v Speaker 4>Just needing any excuse to be all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go do cocaine now because </v>

1081
00:49:12.301 --> 00:49:12.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm set and I'm dealing with something </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know how to deal.</v>

1082
00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.790
<v Speaker 4>Just like my way of copping out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>avoiding my issues.</v>

1083
00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:16.510
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>

1084
00:49:16.511 --> 00:49:18.970
<v Speaker 4>So it was like a block.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like maybe a couple months ago by</v>

1085
00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:20.950
<v Speaker 4>I'd be in Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1086
00:49:20.951 --> 00:49:25.951
<v Speaker 4>working on some stuff with kanye and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>never did cocaine or anything around </v>

1087
00:49:25.951 --> 00:49:25.951
<v Speaker 4>those guys.</v>

1088
00:49:25.951 --> 00:49:29.820
<v Speaker 4>I was like my time to detox when I will </v>
<v Speaker 4>be away because you're not if you do </v>

1089
00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:32.620
<v Speaker 4>coke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coke with other people or alone.</v>

1090
00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:37.650
<v Speaker 4>And I felt weird about traveling the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world and every place I was at asking </v>

1091
00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:39.640
<v Speaker 4>people where the drugs was at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like it was something that I did,</v>

1092
00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:41.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at home,</v>

1093
00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:42.930
<v Speaker 4>at a certain time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1094
00:49:42.931 --> 00:49:43.900
<v Speaker 4>and which was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1095
00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:49.080
<v Speaker 4>I was able to kind of keep it together </v>
<v Speaker 4>and go out and work on my music and be </v>

1096
00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.350
<v Speaker 4>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a system,</v>

1097
00:49:50.351 --> 00:49:53.260
<v Speaker 4>it was a weird six system I developed </v>
<v Speaker 4>for myself,</v>

1098
00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:53.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

1099
00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:56.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was able to be cool if I wasn't in New</v>

1100
00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:01.980
<v Speaker 4>York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then when I was back in New York it </v>

1101
00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:01.980
<v Speaker 4>was on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1102
00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:03.100
<v Speaker 4>because it was just like being at home </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the apartment alone for hours on end.</v>

1103
00:50:03.101 --> 00:50:05.200
<v Speaker 4>Just really just got me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1104
00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:08.170
<v Speaker 4>and doing it just kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh man,</v>

1105
00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:11.800
<v Speaker 4>I could just put on leaky lee and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>chill out for hours by myself.</v>

1106
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:16.800
<v Speaker 4>And it's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting that the arrest made </v>

1107
00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.320
<v Speaker 4>you want to stop because you really was </v>
<v Speaker 4>it because like the feeling like,</v>

1108
00:50:20.321 --> 00:50:22.360
<v Speaker 4>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have an event has taken place.</v>

1109
00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:26.530
<v Speaker 4>Like this is obviously a big sign that </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going down the wrong direction.</v>

1110
00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:31.650
<v Speaker 4>I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm dealing with the legal system now </v>

1111
00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:31.970
<v Speaker 4>we're getting arrested and I was.</v>

<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1116
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:53.070
<v Speaker 4>And I went and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just,</v>

1117
00:50:53.071 --> 00:50:55.340
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like how people were looking at</v>
<v Speaker 4>me at that moment in time.</v>

1118
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:57.110

<v Speaker 4>are you kidding me?</v>

1125
00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:16.420
<v Speaker 4>People love to be sanctimonious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1127
00:51:17.170 --> 00:51:19.000
<v Speaker 4>but that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When it happened,</v>

1128
00:51:19.001 --> 00:51:21.070
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1129
00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.540
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1130
00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:27.690
<v Speaker 4>the next complex interview I did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I have a statement that I use this </v>

1131
00:51:27.881 --> 00:51:32.881
<v Speaker 4>camera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really sOrry to all my fans for you </v>

1132
00:51:32.881 --> 00:51:33.970
<v Speaker 4>guys knowing how I do cocaine now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where I used to,</v>

1133
00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:35.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't do it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1134
00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:37.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry if I let anyone down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck that.</v>

1135
00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:40.690
<v Speaker 4>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really just like I'm dealing with</v>

1136
00:51:40.691 --> 00:51:42.970
<v Speaker 4>some shit if you don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't give a fuck.</v>

1137
00:51:42.971 --> 00:51:45.700
<v Speaker 4>This is how I was surviving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I didn't do it,</v>

1138
00:51:45.701 --> 00:51:47.200
<v Speaker 4>I would have blew my brains out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1139
00:51:47.201 --> 00:51:52.201
<v Speaker 4>I like how you describe it to because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're very honest about the positive </v>

1140
00:51:52.201 --> 00:51:53.110
<v Speaker 4>aspects of the effects and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's super important.</v>

1141
00:51:53.111 --> 00:51:56.350
<v Speaker 4>And this was my contract by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This release.</v>

1142
00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:58.690
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't worry about it.</v>

1143
00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:02.620
<v Speaker 4>everything's a proper method.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're very muffled.</v>

1144
00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:07.830
<v Speaker 4>You're very honest about the positive </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefits of it.</v>

1145
00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:12.860
<v Speaker 4>Like people have this idea like you </v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't talk about positive benefits </v>

1146
00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:17.361
<v Speaker 4>of any drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's harmless drugs like </v>

1147
00:52:17.361 --> 00:52:17.430
<v Speaker 4>marijuana or dangerous drugs like </v>
<v Speaker 4>cocaine.</v>

1148
00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:22.170
<v Speaker 4>He maybe even especially dangerous drugs</v>
<v Speaker 4>like cocaine because the reality of what</v>

1149
00:52:22.171 --> 00:52:25.650
<v Speaker 4>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your experience and the positive aspects</v>

1150
00:52:25.651 --> 00:52:30.651
<v Speaker 4>of your experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like he's promoting drugs when </v>

1151
00:52:30.651 --> 00:52:32.700
<v Speaker 4>clearly you're doing just the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about how you needed them</v>

1152
00:52:32.701 --> 00:52:37.701
<v Speaker 4>and use them and they helped you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the reality is it was because you </v>

1153
00:52:37.701 --> 00:52:40.260
<v Speaker 4>were dealing with an issue and it just </v>
<v Speaker 4>helps mask the issue,</v>

1154
00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:45.290
<v Speaker 4>but it did help him to lie and deny that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it clouds the issue for people dealing </v>

1155
00:52:45.931 --> 00:52:50.931
<v Speaker 4>with their own drug issues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with their current drug issues </v>

1156
00:52:50.931 --> 00:52:52.200
<v Speaker 4>or their past drug issues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People aren't honest about it,</v>

1157
00:52:52.201 --> 00:52:54.240
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It puts people in this weird place where</v>

1158
00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:54.780
<v Speaker 4>you don't mind.</v>

1159
00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:59.780
<v Speaker 4>If I wasn't for fucking meth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have never started this </v>

1160
00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:02.151
<v Speaker 4>business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason why I'm doing so well is </v>

1161
00:53:02.151 --> 00:53:02.151
<v Speaker 4>because I got on like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1162
00:53:02.151 --> 00:53:05.400
<v Speaker 4>there's some people that can say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably the only reason why I could sit</v>

1163
00:53:05.401 --> 00:53:09.840
<v Speaker 4>here and say that is because like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been four years clean man.</v>

1164
00:53:09.841 --> 00:53:14.841
<v Speaker 4>I'm not like running and I can speak </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it candidly and it's not something</v>

1165
00:53:15.271 --> 00:53:16.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm weird about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1166
00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:21.830
<v Speaker 4>I've just grown so much since then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I also know that the more I talk </v>

1167
00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:22.940
<v Speaker 4>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1168
00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:25.830
<v Speaker 4>the more it'll help somebody else who be</v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with it.</v>

1169
00:53:25.831 --> 00:53:26.760
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Definitely.</v>

1170
00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:28.980
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're in that,</v>

1171
00:53:28.981 --> 00:53:33.981
<v Speaker 4>it's probably just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems like you can't get out of it </v>

1172
00:53:33.981 --> 00:53:35.200
<v Speaker 4>because it is like a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean,</v>

1173
00:53:35.201 --> 00:53:37.680
<v Speaker 4>and cycle and you get caught up in it.</v>

1174
00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:39.360
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1175
00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:43.440
<v Speaker 4>I just know is with kids listening to me</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk now,</v>

1176
00:53:43.441 --> 00:53:45.150
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could be helping a lot of people.</v>

1177
00:53:45.151 --> 00:53:48.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm not like one of those people now </v>
<v Speaker 4>that used to do cocaine and I'm like,</v>

1178
00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:51.120
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're bad if you do cocaine or cocaine.</v>

1179
00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:56.170
<v Speaker 4>Spanish didn't do cocaine mean I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>promote any drug but I'm not judging </v>

1180
00:53:56.281 --> 00:53:59.550
<v Speaker 4>anybody if they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but know it's not like a big deal.</v>

1181
00:53:59.551 --> 00:54:04.551
<v Speaker 4>Like I did it and I just abused it in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>way and it didn't benefit me.</v>

1182
00:54:04.771 --> 00:54:07.890
<v Speaker 4>It didn't benefit scott.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't like the person I was becoming.</v>

1183
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:13.160
<v Speaker 4>There's some people that could do this </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit and they can live and do it in </v>

1184
00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:13.160
<v Speaker 4>moderation and it doesn't affect their </v>
<v Speaker 4>lives.</v>

1185
00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:14.820
<v Speaker 4>Like how it affected mine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More power to them.</v>

1186
00:54:14.821 --> 00:54:18.510
<v Speaker 4>They got super powers if you asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just have that,</v>

1187
00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:21.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a history of drugs in my family.</v>

1188
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:24.480
<v Speaker 4>It was like my blood was waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1189
00:54:24.481 --> 00:54:25.240
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:29.430
<v Speaker 4>let's go and I know that about myself </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I just had to make that choice.</v>

1191
00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:31.710
<v Speaker 4>I had to make a choice and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's with anything,</v>

1192
00:54:31.711 --> 00:54:34.080
<v Speaker 4>cigarettes and you know,</v>

1195
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:40.880
<v Speaker 4>And I made that choice for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for my own health,</v>

1196
00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:43.560
<v Speaker 4>my daughter for a future,</v>

1216
00:55:29.170 --> 00:55:29.170
<v Speaker 4>weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1218
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:34.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like one of those things you </v>

1219
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.630
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1220
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:38.241
<v Speaker 4>I just kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never really had a relationship with </v>

1221
00:55:38.241 --> 00:55:40.581
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the only memories I have was just </v>

1222
00:55:40.581 --> 00:55:40.581
<v Speaker 4>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1223
00:55:40.581 --> 00:55:42.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this guy was just so cool.</v>

1224
00:55:42.031 --> 00:55:47.031
<v Speaker 4>He had a cigarette and he had his beard </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was always awesome and he was </v>

1225
00:55:47.031 --> 00:55:47.670
<v Speaker 4>there for me as a man and up until you </v>
<v Speaker 4>left,</v>

1226
00:55:47.671 --> 00:55:48.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1227
00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:52.040
<v Speaker 4>and I think I kind of got caught up in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and that's something that like,</v>

1228
00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:57.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't say the image of my father </v>

1229
00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:57.500
<v Speaker 4>drinking and smoking is what made me </v>
<v Speaker 4>drink and smoke,</v>

1230
00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:57.660
<v Speaker 4>but I can't say it didn't.</v>

1231
00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:03.320
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think you took like comfort in </v>

1232
00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:03.320
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe like,</v>

1233
00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:03.320
<v Speaker 4>I think maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1234
00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:08.211
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think everybody takes comfort and </v>

1235
00:56:08.211 --> 00:56:08.211
<v Speaker 4>smoking cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like one of those things.</v>

1236
00:56:08.211 --> 00:56:12.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the grand trick that cigarettes </v>

1237
00:56:12.490 --> 00:56:15.591
<v Speaker 4>pull on you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did they give you comfort in that need </v>

1238
00:56:15.591 --> 00:56:18.801
<v Speaker 4>to replenish?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you give you a little stimulant </v>

1239
00:56:18.801 --> 00:56:21.770
<v Speaker 4>from the nicotine and all the chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are in the cigarette and then </v>

1240
00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:24.800
<v Speaker 4>you're so addicted to it that you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>this weird when you don't have it and </v>

1241
00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:29.551
<v Speaker 4>then when you smoke it relieves that </v>
<v Speaker 4>stress and you think that it's actually </v>

1242
00:56:29.551 --> 00:56:34.171
<v Speaker 4>calming you down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But all it's doing is feeding the </v>

1243
00:56:34.171 --> 00:56:34.171
<v Speaker 4>dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a drug.</v>

1244
00:56:34.171 --> 00:56:34.171
<v Speaker 4>it's anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1245
00:56:34.171 --> 00:56:38.760
<v Speaker 4>it's a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nicotine is one of the craziest drugs </v>

1246
00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:40.360
<v Speaker 4>all time because there's legalist book </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you could just get it anywhere.</v>

1247
00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:44.830
<v Speaker 4>Like they presented in such a way where </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all cool but you know,</v>

1248
00:56:44.831 --> 00:56:45.910
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's another thing too.</v>

1249
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:50.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't come to my aunties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Smokers either like friends come of my </v>

1250
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:51.280
<v Speaker 4>house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they smoke,</v>

1251
00:56:51.281 --> 00:56:56.281
<v Speaker 4>I don't shush them outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know like you can smoke in the </v>

1252
00:56:56.281 --> 00:56:56.281
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that really.</v>

1253
00:56:56.281 --> 00:56:57.400
<v Speaker 4>You don't mind people stinking up your </v>
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>

1254
00:56:57.401 --> 00:57:01.870
<v Speaker 4>There's on cigarettes bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I smoked for a long time and you know,</v>

1255
00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:04.420
<v Speaker 4>it's not like I got people chain smoking</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the house.</v>

1256
00:57:04.421 --> 00:57:07.530
<v Speaker 4>Somebody needs a cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one or two school.</v>

1257
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:10.390
<v Speaker 4>I have friends that used to smoke and if</v>
<v Speaker 4>they smell it,</v>

1258
00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:14.380
<v Speaker 4>they get sick and I'm cool with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm cool with it.</v>

1259
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:19.800
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's more just like for people that </v>

1260
00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:22.651
<v Speaker 4>can't stand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's people that might still </v>

1261
00:57:22.651 --> 00:57:23.170
<v Speaker 4>have an issue with the addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I smell it or anything like that,</v>

1262
00:57:23.171 --> 00:57:23.980
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1263
00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.050
<v Speaker 4>it's not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't really bother me.</v>

1264
00:57:26.070 --> 00:57:28.480
<v Speaker 4>You don't have a poll that doesn't pull </v>
<v Speaker 4>you towards it.</v>

1265
00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.760
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to smoke it again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I get,</v>

1266
00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:36.300
<v Speaker 4>I can't say like occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is something that just will </v>

1267
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:38.110
<v Speaker 4>forever happened because I was addicted </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the shit,</v>

1268
00:57:38.590 --> 00:57:41.200
<v Speaker 4>but like I can't say like after a meal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a really good meal,</v>

1269
00:57:41.201 --> 00:57:41.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh man,</v>

1270
00:57:41.951 --> 00:57:44.410
<v Speaker 4>a cigarette would be nice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't do that no more.</v>

1271
00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:45.730
<v Speaker 4>So that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I said,</v>

1272
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:47.170
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good for you.</v>

1273
00:57:47.171 --> 00:57:49.420
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I got hypnotized.</v>

1274
00:57:49.421 --> 00:57:52.360
<v Speaker 4>So hypnotists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1275
00:57:52.361 --> 00:57:57.361
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And do you remember them advertising </v>

1276
00:57:57.361 --> 00:57:57.361
<v Speaker 4>you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1277
00:57:57.361 --> 00:57:57.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember because you have to,</v>

1278
00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:59.650
<v Speaker 4>you have to receive the information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1279
00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:04.720
<v Speaker 4>that he's telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to really process what he's </v>

1280
00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:05.530
<v Speaker 4>saying because it's really a reeducation</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the dangers of,</v>

1281
00:58:06.030 --> 00:58:11.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kinda like what we learned in </v>

1282
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.030
<v Speaker 4>health class when we were in school as </v>
<v Speaker 4>kids,</v>

1283
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's no different except,</v>

1284
00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:14.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>over time the fear is not,</v>

1285
00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:20.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as heightened as it was when we were </v>

1286
00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:20.360
<v Speaker 4>fourth graders sitting in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But our teachers saying like,</v>

1287
00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:22.510
<v Speaker 4>oh it does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your lungs are nice and pink like this.</v>

1288
00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:27.540
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you smoke they're black like </v>

1289
00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:27.540
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1290
00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:32.290
<v Speaker 4>It's not over time we see pop culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we see the james deans,</v>

1291
00:58:32.291 --> 00:58:35.560
<v Speaker 4>we see everything going on and then it </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't seem as dangerous.</v>

1292
00:58:36.050 --> 00:58:41.050
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and basically this guy reminds you of </v>

1293
00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:41.380
<v Speaker 4>the dangerous and kind of reboot you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like psycho shit.</v>

1294
00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:46.640
<v Speaker 4>It is kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as an adult you take it a little </v>

1295
00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:48.661
<v Speaker 4>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really funny just how the cycle of </v>

1296
00:58:48.661 --> 00:58:48.661
<v Speaker 4>life goes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1297
00:58:48.661 --> 00:58:52.530
<v Speaker 4>at my age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess I was able to look at it in the </v>

1298
00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:52.530
<v Speaker 4>same way I saw it as a fourth grader,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1299
00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:53.620
<v Speaker 4>and just kind of realized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1300
00:58:53.621 --> 00:58:54.750
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is hurting me.</v>

1301
00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:59.860
<v Speaker 4>Talked me through it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They lie down on the couch and close </v>

1302
00:58:59.860 --> 00:58:59.860
<v Speaker 4>your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They turn the lights down.</v>

1303
00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:00.640
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had him come to my crib,</v>

1304
00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:05.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm wanting to feel comfortable </v>

1305
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.670
<v Speaker 4>and I had a knife there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you tried any funny moments,</v>

1306
00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:10.860
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just going to let you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>touching me,</v>

1307
00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:12.830
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know what was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had,</v>

1308
00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:16.890
<v Speaker 4>I had to shake my pillow in case there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a comedian that,</v>

1309
00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:19.420
<v Speaker 4>a comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no bullshit.</v>

1310
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 4>There was a comedian and used to go to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the comedy that used to hypnotize</v>

1311
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:25.880
<v Speaker 1>women is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His thing was that he was a comedian,</v>

1312
00:59:25.881 --> 00:59:30.881
<v Speaker 1>but he also did some hypnotist work and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like he would always hypnotized girls.</v>

1313
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:36.490
<v Speaker 1>And like I remember very clearly one </v>
<v Speaker 1>time I was walking to the back of the </v>

1314
00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:40.571
<v Speaker 1>comedy store and he was talking to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl and she just pulled her head away </v>

1315
00:59:40.571 --> 00:59:40.571
<v Speaker 1>and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1316
00:59:40.571 --> 00:59:40.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to hypnotize me.</v>

1317
00:59:42.490 --> 00:59:43.540
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1318
00:59:43.541 --> 00:59:46.120
<v Speaker 4>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is out there hypnotizing people.</v>

1319
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:48.100
<v Speaker 4>That's fucked up man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So cool.</v>

1320
00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:51.080
<v Speaker 4>When they do do it in your bed?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1321
00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:55.390
<v Speaker 4>we were in the living room on the couch </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you kinda just sits there and he</v>

1322
00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.620
<v Speaker 1>don't sleep on your back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1323
00:59:58.650 --> 01:00:00.940
<v Speaker 1>So you fully stretched out pillow behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>her head.</v>

1324
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:04.280
<v Speaker 1>Just relaxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when they count you down,</v>

1325
01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:05.270
<v Speaker 1>what does it feel like?</v>

1326
01:00:05.830 --> 01:00:10.830
<v Speaker 4>It feel like you're tired as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like slipping into like,</v>

1327
01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:17.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a dream system really relaxed.</v>

1328
01:00:17.741 --> 01:00:19.090
<v Speaker 4>You just really relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like.</v>

1329
01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.700
<v Speaker 4>Had you been touch before this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1330
01:00:21.010 --> 01:00:22.240
<v Speaker 4>First time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First time.</v>

1331
01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:25.210
<v Speaker 4>Only time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only wants us at three times.</v>

1332
01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:27.040
<v Speaker 4>Three times three and three separate </v>
<v Speaker 4>sessions.</v>

1333
01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:32.250
<v Speaker 4>Does their weeks apart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does it feel different each time you do </v>

1334
01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:32.250
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or does it feel the same?</v>

1335
01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:37.040
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after the first time it's like he does </v>

1336
01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.721
<v Speaker 4>his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like after the first one it's like </v>

1337
01:00:39.721 --> 01:00:39.721
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1338
01:00:39.721 --> 01:00:40.120
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can smoke between.</v>

1339
01:00:40.121 --> 01:00:42.490
<v Speaker 4>So it's like we did ours from tuesday to</v>
<v Speaker 4>tuesday,</v>

1340
01:00:42.491 --> 01:00:47.491
<v Speaker 4>so they came that tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that whole week I was allowed to smoke </v>

1341
01:00:47.491 --> 01:00:51.691
<v Speaker 4>right after the first session,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after the first therapy session and the </v>

1342
01:00:51.691 --> 01:00:55.681
<v Speaker 4>hipaa hypnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then after that second week you're done </v>

1343
01:00:55.681 --> 01:00:59.341
<v Speaker 4>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then after that third week it's like </v>

1344
01:00:59.341 --> 01:00:59.590
<v Speaker 4>kinda like reestablishing that.</v>

1345
01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:03.340
<v Speaker 4>It's done and that's the final one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But after that first one,</v>

1346
01:01:03.341 --> 01:01:04.390
<v Speaker 4>it's like the final week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1347
01:01:04.391 --> 01:01:08.200
<v Speaker 4>So to come out of that hypnosis instill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1348
01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:13.320
<v Speaker 4>him telling me like I can still smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still had this urge to like,</v>

1349
01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:17.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I want to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1350
01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:20.050
<v Speaker 4>like I was allowed to smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said it was cool.</v>

1351
01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:23.400
<v Speaker 4>I remember like my first cigarette after</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the hypnosis,</v>

1352
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.840
<v Speaker 4>I waited like a couple of hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I had the,</v>

1353
01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:30.930
<v Speaker 4>I had the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that urge but I wasn't so quick to jump </v>

1354
01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:32.080
<v Speaker 4>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why did he say he could smoke?</v>

1355
01:01:32.081 --> 01:01:33.500
<v Speaker 4>What's the logic behind it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You ask him?</v>

1356
01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:37.210
<v Speaker 4>Just kinda like took to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1357
01:01:37.211 --> 01:01:41.410
<v Speaker 4>to give it a minute to give you that </v>
<v Speaker 4>last week too,</v>

1358
01:01:41.411 --> 01:01:44.050
<v Speaker 4>just know that this going to be up after</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he tells you like,</v>

1359
01:01:44.051 --> 01:01:49.051
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so just this last week you could smoke </v>

1360
01:01:49.051 --> 01:01:49.051
<v Speaker 4>and then after that second session </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're done.</v>

1361
01:01:49.051 --> 01:01:53.530
<v Speaker 1>So when you're going under and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's telling you I'm going to count you </v>

1362
01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:54.230
<v Speaker 1>down and then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're under.</v>

1363
01:01:54.231 --> 01:01:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the first things he said</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you?</v>

1364
01:01:56.151 --> 01:01:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Like do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were you conscious of it?</v>

1365
01:01:58.800 --> 01:01:59.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1366
01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.950
<v Speaker 4>He's just basically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1367
01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:03.750
<v Speaker 4>just talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1368
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:09.230
<v Speaker 4>the dangers of cancer and what it could </v>
<v Speaker 4>do to you and how it's just nasty and </v>

1369
01:02:09.631 --> 01:02:14.631
<v Speaker 4>it's Poison and just everything you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could imagine that we'll kind of put it </v>

1370
01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:17.520
<v Speaker 4>in a way for a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Understand and get it like,</v>

1371
01:02:17.521 --> 01:02:19.470
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is dangerous because that's what it</v>

1372
01:02:19.471 --> 01:02:23.330
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the average person that smokes a</v>

1373
01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.330
<v Speaker 4>doesn't see the danger in it like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you might see,</v>

1374
01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:27.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1375
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:33.470
<v Speaker 4>the old lady that's 80,</v>
<v Speaker 4>90 years old that's been smoking on her </v>

1376
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.470
<v Speaker 4>days,</v>

1377
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.990
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he'd just be like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like a gamble every time.</v>

1381
01:02:41.671 --> 01:02:45.030
<v Speaker 4>and it's like literally I'm him just </v>
<v Speaker 4>kinda,</v>

1382
01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:46.650

1383
01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:49.130

<v Speaker 4>reallY talk about because he,</v>

<v Speaker 4>he sells this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like a thing,</v>

1387
01:02:56.371 --> 01:03:00.670

<v Speaker 4>like if you knew someone was uh,</v>

1388
01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:05.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were dating a girl and you knew </v>

1389
01:03:05.810 --> 01:03:05.810
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1390
01:03:05.810 --> 01:03:09.330
<v Speaker 4>she was known for poisoning her </v>
<v Speaker 4>boyfriend's putting poison,</v>

<v Speaker 4>But every guy she did it kind of got </v>

1393

<v Speaker 4>murdered.</v>

1399
01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.620
<v Speaker 4>if you knew for a fact that she was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>killer,</v>

1400
01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:33.800
<v Speaker 4>would you let her cook your food?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you let this person into your </v>

1401
01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:33.800
<v Speaker 4>house?</v>

1402
01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.620
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would say I'm not fucking with the </v>

1403
01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:36.620
<v Speaker 4>chicken.</v>

1404
01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:37.680
<v Speaker 4>if she calls too many times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>

1405
01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.230
<v Speaker 4>like it's just kind of the reality of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1406
01:03:40.231 --> 01:03:45.231
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well anytime you've seen any obsessive </v>

1407
01:03:45.231 --> 01:03:45.231
<v Speaker 4>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything dangerous people,</v>

1408
01:03:45.231 --> 01:03:47.010
<v Speaker 4>but it's kind of just that reality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's poison.</v>

1409
01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:50.010
<v Speaker 4>It's going out your way to buy poisoned </v>
<v Speaker 4>to put in your system.</v>

1410
01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:54.750
<v Speaker 4>So you felt much more in touch with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality of what it is.</v>

1411
01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:55.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1413
01:03:56.671 --> 01:04:01.671
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen there's been curious about </v>

1414
01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:01.671
<v Speaker 4>like what the state is like of being </v>
<v Speaker 4>hypnotized.</v>

1415
01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:03.540
<v Speaker 4>You don't feel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't feel disconnected?</v>

1416
01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:04.680
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt like I was,</v>

1417
01:04:04.681 --> 01:04:09.681
<v Speaker 4>I could have woke up at any minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt like if somebody or if you try </v>

1418
01:04:09.681 --> 01:04:09.830
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could have smacked the shit.</v>

1419
01:04:09.831 --> 01:04:14.831
<v Speaker 4>Ain'T really worried about him trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>y'all because just like you just like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>vulnerable and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1424
01:04:22.791 --> 01:04:27.201
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know what extent that would </v>

1425
01:04:27.201 --> 01:04:27.201
<v Speaker 4>feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1426
01:04:27.201 --> 01:04:27.540
<v Speaker 4>I didn't want to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know what you're saying.</v>

<v Speaker 4>comedy hypnotist shows?</v>

1429
01:04:32.790 --> 01:04:37.790
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should go and check bark like a dog </v>

1430
01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:38.310
<v Speaker 4>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1431
01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:43.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just one guy that does it </v>

1432
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:43.370
<v Speaker 4>particularly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1433
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:43.370
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's known for it.</v>

1434
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:47.240
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of people all over the </v>

1435
01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:47.240
<v Speaker 4>country to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1436
01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:47.240
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is like a thing.</v>

1437
01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:47.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1438
01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:47.910
<v Speaker 4>It's a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1439
01:04:47.911 --> 01:04:50.460
<v Speaker 4>I've seen her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I was starting out in boston,</v>

1440
01:04:50.461 --> 01:04:52.530
<v Speaker 4>there was this comedy club called </v>
<v Speaker 4>stitches and uh,</v>

1441
01:04:52.570 --> 01:04:57.570
<v Speaker 4>they had a guy named Frank Santos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She did it there all the time and I </v>

1442
01:04:57.570 --> 01:04:59.130
<v Speaker 4>thought it was bullshit at first and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then from being there all the time,</v>

1443
01:04:59.131 --> 01:05:00.840
<v Speaker 4>I got to see all these shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I realized like,</v>

1444
01:05:00.841 --> 01:05:01.320
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1445
01:05:01.321 --> 01:05:03.510
<v Speaker 4>you can just hypnotize some people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1446
01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:05.820
<v Speaker 4>And you get some dudes to come in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>own pants.</v>

1447
01:05:06.090 --> 01:05:09.660
<v Speaker 4>They would think they were having sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would take care of sex on stage and</v>

1448
01:05:09.661 --> 01:05:14.661
<v Speaker 4>they will be on the ground like humping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he would tell them when they were </v>

1449
01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:15.150
<v Speaker 4>gonna come and they would come and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd be embarrassed and then they'd go</v>

1450
01:05:15.151 --> 01:05:16.200
<v Speaker 4>and sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1451
01:05:16.270 --> 01:05:21.270
<v Speaker 4>I'd be embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like somebody with a ghost hand </v>

1452
01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:24.451
<v Speaker 4>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're jerking you off when you're not </v>

1453
01:05:24.451 --> 01:05:24.451
<v Speaker 4>noticing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so cool.</v>

1454
01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:27.430
<v Speaker 4>Some people apparently are super </v>
<v Speaker 4>susceptible to it,</v>

1455
01:05:27.730 --> 01:05:31.220
<v Speaker 4>but he knew he knew when people were </v>
<v Speaker 4>under and when they weren't under.</v>

1456
01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:33.850
<v Speaker 4>That's why I was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm always confused.</v>

1457
01:05:33.851 --> 01:05:35.380
<v Speaker 4>Like you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you,</v>

1458
01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:38.440
<v Speaker 4>you were coNscious but you were under.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1459
01:05:38.441 --> 01:05:41.920
<v Speaker 4>like he'll do things like um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once you say yes,</v>

1460
01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:43.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he'll,</v>

1461
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:46.150
<v Speaker 4>he'll know to check and make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're under or whatever.</v>

1462
01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:50.230
<v Speaker 4>There's certaIn things that he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'll do like and I'm paying for it.</v>

1463
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:51.040
<v Speaker 4>So it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1464
01:05:51.041 --> 01:05:53.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm my lying right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is under though.</v>

1465
01:05:53.921 --> 01:05:56.410
<v Speaker 4>That's what's confusing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is that state,</v>

1466
01:05:56.590 --> 01:06:01.590
<v Speaker 4>I guess between dreaming and awake?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm definitely like the </v>

1467
01:06:02.921 --> 01:06:05.200
<v Speaker 4>understate is more just like a relaxed </v>
<v Speaker 4>feeling.</v>

1468
01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:09.010
<v Speaker 4>Not like sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1469
01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:12.540
<v Speaker 4>But it can be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can be,</v>

1470
01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:17.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could feel I could sleep because </v>

1471
01:06:17.550 --> 01:06:18.520
<v Speaker 4>you're breathing slower and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep is like,</v>

1472
01:06:18.521 --> 01:06:19.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're relaxed.</v>

1473
01:06:19.781 --> 01:06:23.080
<v Speaker 4>And to us that's what sleep feels like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not that relaxed state,</v>

1474
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:26.140
<v Speaker 4>but your conscious conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hear him crystal clear.</v>

1475
01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:29.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm not in deep sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1476
01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:31.500
<v Speaker 4>it feels like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm,</v>

1477
01:06:31.501 --> 01:06:33.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm hearing everything clearly.</v>

1478
01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:37.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm understanding him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1479
01:06:37.421 --> 01:06:39.580
<v Speaker 4>a saw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not snoring here.</v>

1480
01:06:39.581 --> 01:06:42.790
<v Speaker 4>It's not like it's not weird you feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>president,</v>

1481
01:06:42.791 --> 01:06:45.100
<v Speaker 4>but then you just are really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really chill.</v>

1482
01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:47.350
<v Speaker 4>So it's just basically like some weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>middle state.</v>

1483
01:06:47.410 --> 01:06:52.410
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the in between of some shit that </v>

1484
01:06:52.410 --> 01:06:52.410
<v Speaker 4>happens that motherfuckers know how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

1485
01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:55.990
<v Speaker 4>like I've never experienced anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>like it.</v>

1486
01:06:56.110 --> 01:06:59.890
<v Speaker 4>What's the difference between one </v>
<v Speaker 4>session one and session two,</v>

1487
01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:05.160
<v Speaker 4>session three m,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't be the difference between </v>

1488
01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:11.130
<v Speaker 4>session one and session two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can say I can't really differentiate </v>

1489
01:07:11.130 --> 01:07:12.510
<v Speaker 4>between session two and tHree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you allowed to smoke out?</v>

1490
01:07:12.610 --> 01:07:14.710
<v Speaker 4>You're allowed to smoke after one or </v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll have a smoke after two,</v>

1491
01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:16.660
<v Speaker 4>after two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're done after two.</v>

1492
01:07:16.661 --> 01:07:19.800
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's when he actually like,</v>

1493
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:24.870
<v Speaker 4>I think too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the difference between the first stage </v>

1494
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.870
<v Speaker 4>and second stage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first stage,</v>

1495
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:28.661
<v Speaker 4>she doesn't really instill anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you wake up from this you're </v>

1496
01:07:28.661 --> 01:07:28.870
<v Speaker 4>not going to be smoking cigarettes </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

1497
01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:31.930
<v Speaker 4>Like he doesn't say anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just educate you.</v>

1498
01:07:31.931 --> 01:07:32.400
<v Speaker 4>And then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1499
01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:33.880
<v Speaker 4>you're going to come back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1500
01:07:33.881 --> 01:07:36.430
<v Speaker 4>and I'm gonna call you out from from 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the way up to one,</v>

1501
01:07:36.431 --> 01:07:37.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and count you up and cut you up.</v>

1502
01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:39.810
<v Speaker 4>But he doesn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he says like,</v>

1503
01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:41.970
<v Speaker 4>you can smoke this week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1504
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.870
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but after this you're going to be done.</v>

1505
01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:47.980
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>so like you come out of that first state</v>

1506
01:07:47.981 --> 01:07:48.880
<v Speaker 4>just kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1507
01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:50.950
<v Speaker 4>But like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was hesitant to smoke.</v>

1508
01:07:50.951 --> 01:07:54.380
<v Speaker 4>I really wanted to smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But would it be something that,</v>

1509
01:07:54.381 --> 01:07:58.570
<v Speaker 4>that was something that stuck still in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that first session that made me like,</v>

1510
01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:01.720
<v Speaker 4>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it is kind of gross,</v>

1511
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:03.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>success rate.</v>

1512
01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:07.090
<v Speaker 4>Did he say iT literally?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1513
01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:09.310
<v Speaker 4>he says everybody does it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know,</v>

1514
01:08:09.830 --> 01:08:14.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure a lot of people have a </v>

1515
01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:14.830
<v Speaker 4>hard time with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1516
01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:15.800
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just you really in,</v>

1517
01:08:15.801 --> 01:08:19.090
<v Speaker 4>this is what he says and anybody that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>know that it's done it too.</v>

1518
01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:21.920
<v Speaker 4>It's really just kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to be ready,</v>

1519
01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:23.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a weird way.</v>

1520
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:28.600
<v Speaker 4>You just got to be ready.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's with anything in </v>

1521
01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:32.511
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they tried to make it like this </v>

<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you've just got to be ready,</v>

1523
01:08:32.511 --> 01:08:32.511
<v Speaker 4>but like anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>marriage,</v>

<v Speaker 4>even just dating someone or whether it's</v>

<v Speaker 4>a job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just got to make that choice and </v>

<v Speaker 4>in and out.</v>

1528
01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:45.530

<v Speaker 4>It was the craziest situation.</v>

1576

<v Speaker 4>her a boy's name.</v>

01:11:54.541 --> 01:11:56.850
<v Speaker 4>I see how it'd be weird about dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's science.</v>

1605
01:11:56.851 --> 01:12:01.851
<v Speaker 4>It's not your fault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like do it science in your own </v>

1606
01:12:01.851 --> 01:12:02.710
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fucked up,</v>

1607
01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:03.220
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1608
01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:08.240
<v Speaker 4>that's the one thing when it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when everybody judges people and </v>

1609
01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.641
<v Speaker 4>everybody does love to judge people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reality is not everybody starts off </v>

1610
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:12.680
<v Speaker 4>in the same spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1611
01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:15.350
<v Speaker 4>some people get a shit spot in life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1612
01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:19.160
<v Speaker 4>and then some people I think a bad spot </v>
<v Speaker 4>or an an,</v>

1613
01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:22.290
<v Speaker 4>an imperfect spot a lot of times </v>
<v Speaker 4>motivates them.</v>

1614
01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:23.290
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

1615
01:12:23.450 --> 01:12:24.780
<v Speaker 4>like that happened with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1616
01:12:24.781 --> 01:12:25.950
<v Speaker 4>most definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1617
01:12:25.951 --> 01:12:29.780
<v Speaker 4>And I think about it like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's what a lot of my,</v>

1618
01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:31.810
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my issue came through you,</v>

1619
01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:37.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>early on in my career I had this moment </v>

1620
01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:41.181
<v Speaker 4>where literally I had like security and </v>
<v Speaker 4>a car service everywhere I went and I </v>

1621
01:12:43.231 --> 01:12:45.630
<v Speaker 4>just started to feel like richie fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>rich.</v>

1622
01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:47.030
<v Speaker 4>IT was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1623
01:12:47.031 --> 01:12:50.310
<v Speaker 4>I got to chaperone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like my mom has this person with me</v>

1624
01:12:50.311 --> 01:12:55.311
<v Speaker 4>every where I go to make sure I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>get in trouble and then like she feeds </v>

1625
01:12:55.311 --> 01:12:57.960
<v Speaker 4>my bank account as long as I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it just felt really weird,</v>

1626
01:12:58.500 --> 01:12:59.760
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1627
01:12:59.910 --> 01:13:04.910
<v Speaker 4>anyone coke he started to get on because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was because,</v>

1628
01:13:04.921 --> 01:13:07.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I came from a natural thing,</v>

1629
01:13:07.321 --> 01:13:08.580
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was kinda like,</v>

1630
01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:12.570
<v Speaker 4>it was hard for me to like the way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>life was just a different transition,</v>

1631
01:13:12.571 --> 01:13:13.290
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1632
01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:18.530
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine that's got to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a big leap to come from nothing </v>

1633
01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:22.400
<v Speaker 4>and then become a famous entertainers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wealthy is a very treacherous and </v>

1634
01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:23.370
<v Speaker 4>difficult path to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to manage,</v>

1635
01:13:23.371 --> 01:13:26.910
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think most people's motivation is to,</v>

1636
01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:31.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I can't say I didn't fall victim to </v>

1637
01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:31.940
<v Speaker 4>it was just kind of prove people wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a way.</v>

1638
01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:33.560
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was a,</v>

1639
01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:36.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't anger that fueled me though.</v>

1640
01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:37.530
<v Speaker 4>It was just more like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1641
01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:38.910
<v Speaker 4>I'll show you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1642
01:13:38.911 --> 01:13:41.760
<v Speaker 4>it's your own desire to determine </v>
<v Speaker 4>self-worth.</v>

1643
01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:42.660
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1644
01:13:42.661 --> 01:13:44.890
<v Speaker 4>So it didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't misguided.</v>

1645
01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:46.590
<v Speaker 4>It was always just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1646
01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:52.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm doubted the odds are against me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know what I'm feeling and this is </v>

1647
01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.010
<v Speaker 4>what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pink.</v>

1648
01:13:53.011 --> 01:13:55.140
<v Speaker 4>Sign your hand and then you turn it into</v>
<v Speaker 4>a tattoo.</v>

1649
01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:57.360
<v Speaker 4>Pink floyd.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1691
01:15:34.001 --> 01:15:36.640
<v Speaker 4>that thing is rare today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like people don't sit down and listen to</v>

1692
01:15:36.641 --> 01:15:40.180
<v Speaker 4>music together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I'll like if a friend is in a car,</v>

1693
01:15:40.210 --> 01:15:42.180
<v Speaker 4>I'll play him some shit.</v>

01:15:42.190 --> 01:15:44.770
<v Speaker 4>check this out or if we're here in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>studio,</v>

1695
01:15:44.771 --> 01:15:47.580
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'll hook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got this bluetooth speaker thing it,</v>

1696
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:52.590
<v Speaker 4>hook it up to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But most of the time you doN't sit down </v>

1697
01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:53.950
<v Speaker 4>with dudes and just listen to music.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I remember when I was a kid,</v>

1698
01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:55.720
<v Speaker 4>my stepfather,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his friends,</v>

1699
01:15:55.721 --> 01:16:00.721
<v Speaker 4>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would put on an album and they </v>

1700
01:16:00.721 --> 01:16:00.721
<v Speaker 4>would sit down and listen to an album.</v>

1701
01:16:00.721 --> 01:16:00.940
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1702
01:16:00.970 --> 01:16:05.970
<v Speaker 4>they would experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would get the new one or whatever </v>

1703
01:16:05.970 --> 01:16:05.970
<v Speaker 4>the hell it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>THey,</v>

1704
01:16:05.970 --> 01:16:07.540
<v Speaker 4>I remember they had the new billy joel </v>
<v Speaker 4>album.</v>

1705
01:16:07.541 --> 01:16:08.590
<v Speaker 4>I was a little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1706
01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:09.580
<v Speaker 4>That was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a,</v>

1707
01:16:09.581 --> 01:16:11.710
<v Speaker 4>the piano man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember when it was new,</v>

1708
01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:17.700
<v Speaker 4>they pulled that shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was probably like seven or something </v>

1709
01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:17.700
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1710
01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:20.530
<v Speaker 4>they put it on the record player and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone just sat around and listened to</v>

1711
01:16:20.531 --> 01:16:25.531
<v Speaker 4>this billy joel album.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what people did back when there </v>

1712
01:16:25.531 --> 01:16:25.531
<v Speaker 4>was two tv channels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I have,</v>

1713
01:16:25.531 --> 01:16:30.060
<v Speaker 4>I kind of imagined that's what my fans </v>
<v Speaker 4>do and that's kinda like how I create </v>

1714
01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:30.880
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of people might not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1715
01:16:31.450 --> 01:16:33.820
<v Speaker 4>that's why when I released a single,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1716
01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:36.640
<v Speaker 4>it might be some weird shit that people </v>
<v Speaker 4>are just like,</v>

1717
01:16:36.641 --> 01:16:39.790
<v Speaker 4>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in the context of the story,</v>

1718
01:16:39.791 --> 01:16:42.400
<v Speaker 4>when you consume the entire album,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes sense.</v>

1719
01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:47.940
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I don't really make records for </v>

1720
01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:47.940
<v Speaker 4>singles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1721
01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:48.640
<v Speaker 4>I make.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm making an entire album here.</v>

1722
01:16:48.641 --> 01:16:53.641
<v Speaker 4>This is a project.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What percentage of your music is </v>

1723
01:16:53.641 --> 01:16:54.780
<v Speaker 4>listened to by products?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something like 80.</v>

1724
01:16:55.020 --> 01:17:00.020
<v Speaker 4>I think more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think 100 percent talking about the </v>

1725
01:17:01.601 --> 01:17:03.500
<v Speaker 4>moon again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1726
01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:06.400
<v Speaker 4>The fuck in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right on,</v>

1727
01:17:06.401 --> 01:17:07.000
<v Speaker 4>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1728
01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:08.870
<v Speaker 4>That's funny man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

1729
01:17:08.890 --> 01:17:09.620
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1730
01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.510
<v Speaker 4>that's what's missing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mainstream music.</v>

1731
01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:13.970
<v Speaker 4>I think everything is always moment to </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment.</v>

1732
01:17:13.971 --> 01:17:18.971
<v Speaker 4>Single,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the single who's got who or what record </v>

1733
01:17:18.971 --> 01:17:20.900
<v Speaker 4>is not about like sitting down and </v>
<v Speaker 4>having an experience,</v>

1734
01:17:20.901 --> 01:17:24.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to always create with that</v>

1735
01:17:24.291 --> 01:17:26.810
<v Speaker 4>in mind and I think as long as I do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1736
01:17:26.811 --> 01:17:31.811
<v Speaker 4>I always have an audience because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people like us that want that </v>

1737
01:17:31.811 --> 01:17:32.660
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that want that feeling,</v>

1738
01:17:32.970 --> 01:17:35.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get the homies together.</v>

1739
01:17:35.601 --> 01:17:38.240
<v Speaker 4>AnD even if we've all heard the album a </v>
<v Speaker 4>trillion times,</v>

1740
01:17:38.241 --> 01:17:41.120
<v Speaker 4>just to put it on from the beginning and</v>
<v Speaker 4>let it play,</v>

1741
01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:42.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just dope,</v>

1742
01:17:42.650 --> 01:17:42.940
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1743
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:44.270
<v Speaker 4>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody really does that anymore.</v>

1744
01:17:44.271 --> 01:17:47.580
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's kind of like spotify this </v>
<v Speaker 4>here at pandora and just skipping around</v>

1745
01:17:47.581 --> 01:17:48.740
<v Speaker 4>and skipping around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>skipping around,</v>

1746
01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.930
<v Speaker 4>and that's because music is designed </v>
<v Speaker 4>that way,</v>

1747
01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:51.740
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1748

<v Speaker 4>you know what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the kids know.</v>

1750
01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:57.530
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's a thing.</v>

1753
01:18:02.531 --> 01:18:03.890
<v Speaker 4>It's like don't open it until I get </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1754
01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:10.300
<v Speaker 4>It's a very big deal and I love that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's that type of ritual going on </v>

1755
01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:11.420
<v Speaker 4>because like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do it too.</v>

1756
01:18:11.421 --> 01:18:16.421
<v Speaker 4>I go and I buy my own album when it </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes out and kids see me in best buy </v>

1757
01:18:16.421 --> 01:18:18.560
<v Speaker 4>arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like why is it in the front,</v>

1758
01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:22.490
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing this shit now.</v>

1759
01:18:22.491 --> 01:18:24.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't talk to anyone and it's not in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the front moving.</v>

1760
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:27.750
<v Speaker 4>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hell yeah.</v>

1763
01:18:33.230 --> 01:18:34.580

<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1764
01:18:34.581 --> 01:18:36.890
<v Speaker 4>if I'm not going out on a day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm buying my album.</v>

1765
01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:38.910
<v Speaker 4>You can't expect other people to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1766
01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:41.990
<v Speaker 4>If I got to support my own self too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and know that's hilarious.</v>

1767
01:18:41.991 --> 01:18:43.910
<v Speaker 4>You're supporting your own self.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't even work that way.</v>

1768
01:18:43.911 --> 01:18:46.370
<v Speaker 4>Just keep the money in your pocket and </v>
<v Speaker 4>steal your own album.</v>

1793
01:20:04.850 --> 01:20:08.261
<v Speaker 4>joking with my girlfriend that I was </v>

1795
01:20:08.261 --> 01:20:13.130
<v Speaker 7>up and she thought I warm the whole time</v>
<v Speaker 7>because I had an old pair of crocs and </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1835
01:21:47.690 --> 01:21:52.690
<v Speaker 7>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 7>have you ever wear a pair of jordans or </v>

1836
01:21:52.690 --> 01:21:52.690
<v Speaker 7>any of those kinds of shoes?</v>

1837
01:21:52.690 --> 01:21:55.110
<v Speaker 1>I haven't in a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I used to have a deal with nike,</v>

1838
01:21:55.320 --> 01:22:00.320
<v Speaker 1>I used to have one of those things where</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I was on newsradio that'll </v>

1839
01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:01.410
<v Speaker 1>give you free shoes and on fear factor </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

1840
01:22:01.411 --> 01:22:03.790
<v Speaker 1>They just send me boxes of free nike's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1841
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:06.110
<v Speaker 1>But I just stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really do tv anymore.</v>

1842
01:22:06.111 --> 01:22:08.970
<v Speaker 1>It'd be rude if I kept calling them the </v>
<v Speaker 1>yellow so you know,</v>

1843
01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:12.690
<v Speaker 1>I still need that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do with this?</v>

1844
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:18.310
<v Speaker 1>It's going to work out your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they had a thing where you could </v>

1845
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:18.310
<v Speaker 1>call them and they would give you free </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1846
01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

1847
01:22:19.710 --> 01:22:22.830
<v Speaker 1>so they would give me a bunch of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I wouldn't wear like white and red,</v>

1848
01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:25.940
<v Speaker 1>like basketball shoes and be like I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>wear these,</v>

1849
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:28.440
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of like cross trainers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

1850
01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:33.820
<v Speaker 1>they have comfortable shit but I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>into smaller sole things that have like </v>

1851
01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:36.810
<v Speaker 1>less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll feel the ground more like chuck's</v>

1852
01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:38.700
<v Speaker 1>like chuck taylors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked that better.</v>

1853
01:22:38.730 --> 01:22:41.940
<v Speaker 1>I can't perform in jordan's my discovery</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>

1854
01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In what way?</v>

1855
01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:48.140
<v Speaker 1>I just can't move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine that if you live on </v>

1856
01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:52.641
<v Speaker 1>stage combat boots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fuck with army boots with a cigar </v>

1857
01:22:54.811 --> 01:22:56.970
<v Speaker 1>hanging out of your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fucking sergeant fury.</v>

1858
01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:03.690
<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about timberland's?</v>

1859
01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people do it in all sorts of </v>

1860
01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:08.740
<v Speaker 1>sorts of footwear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for me,</v>

1861
01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:12.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm moving around a lot and it's hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me to move as quick and as nimble.</v>

1862
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Why is That?</v>
<v Speaker 1>With jordans I'm going to feel that were</v>

1863
01:23:14.861 --> 01:23:19.600
<v Speaker 1>athletic shoes while I'm not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well first off I'm not like I don't have</v>

1864
01:23:19.601 --> 01:23:21.160
<v Speaker 1>them laced up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1865
01:23:21.190 --> 01:23:23.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm about to go play full court,</v>

1866
01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:24.430
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's that,</v>

1867
01:23:24.431 --> 01:23:29.431
<v Speaker 1>there's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're slIpping around just the </v>

1868
01:23:29.431 --> 01:23:29.431
<v Speaker 1>whole like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1869
01:23:29.431 --> 01:23:32.431
<v Speaker 1>trying to be fresh thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're not like really being worn </v>

1870
01:23:32.431 --> 01:23:32.530
<v Speaker 1>how it's supposed to be worn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then like,</v>

1871
01:23:32.890 --> 01:23:37.890
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing like converse where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>feels like you're literally dancing </v>

1872
01:23:37.890 --> 01:23:40.891
<v Speaker 1>barefoot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like on your tippy toes from one end to </v>

1873
01:23:40.891 --> 01:23:41.200
<v Speaker 1>the stage to the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's literally,</v>

1874
01:23:41.201 --> 01:23:44.350
<v Speaker 1>I find like the best sneaker for me on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>

1875
01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Converse with the best for working out </v>

1876
01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:49.380
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you lifting with stuff,</v>

1877
01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:51.490
<v Speaker 1>you just feel the ground with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's very little padding but it makes</v>

1878
01:23:51.491 --> 01:23:55.720
<v Speaker 1>you think like just dudes like julius </v>
<v Speaker 1>erving and like back in the day where he</v>

1879
01:23:55.721 --> 01:23:58.900
<v Speaker 1>used to wear those and actually play </v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball games and um,</v>

1880
01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:01.450
<v Speaker 1>that's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they wore.</v>

1881
01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Chuck taylors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would play a basketball game with </v>

1882
01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:07.030
<v Speaker 1>no protection basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1883
01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:08.650
<v Speaker 1>ankles were getting broken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1884
01:24:08.651 --> 01:24:13.651
<v Speaker 1>they probably snapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then again they probably developed </v>

1885
01:24:13.651 --> 01:24:13.651
<v Speaker 1>tougher ankles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1886
01:24:13.651 --> 01:24:16.240
<v Speaker 1>like they grew up doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that make any sense?</v>

1887
01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie shakes his head.</v>

1891
01:24:23.711 --> 01:24:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Like if You used it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would get stronger.</v>

1892
01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:27.910

<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1893
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:30.160
<v Speaker 1>like if you put too much bracing around </v>

<v Speaker 4>if you develop some sort of a feud with </v>

1960
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:10.331
<v Speaker 4>them and you find out that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>willing to just go completely psycho on </v>

<v Speaker 4>the course of a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1970
01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:32.540
<v Speaker 4>I like to keep a stance where it's like,</v>

1972
01:27:33.151 --> 01:27:38.151
<v Speaker 4>I don't need anyone but deep down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like everybody wants somebody that's </v>

1973
01:27:38.151 --> 01:27:38.420
<v Speaker 4>like a companion.</v>

1974
01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:43.420
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's somebody that's a best friend </v>

1975
01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:43.420
<v Speaker 4>and a teammate and I,</v>

1976
01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:44.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will always want that,</v>

1977
01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:48.050

<v Speaker 4>searching for,</v>

1978
01:27:48.051 --> 01:27:49.950
<v Speaker 4>like I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it was for awhile.</v>

<v Speaker 4>get a certain happiness in my life,</v>

<v Speaker 4>realize that that's not the way.</v>

1982
01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:01.580
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I'll run into somebody but it is </v>

1984
01:28:06.610 --> 01:28:06.610
<v Speaker 4>tough,</v>

<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just for me,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's tough about being at the right </v>

1989
01:28:15.041 --> 01:28:15.050
<v Speaker 4>place and right time when,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Finding the right combination of you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and you might be terrible to other </v>

01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:57.291
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like other people might think like the </v>

<v Speaker 1>it's in venice and the guy who runs it </v>

2095
01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:41.830

<v Speaker 1>float tank technology.</v>

2097
01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:50.760
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy that really changed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire industry because they used to be </v>

2098
01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:54.571
<v Speaker 1>like kind of home models that were like </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of flimsy and you know,</v>

2099
01:32:54.641 --> 01:32:57.580
<v Speaker 1>they would have all sorts of issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fixed all the issues,</v>

2100
01:32:57.581 --> 01:33:00.370
<v Speaker 1>changed all the filtration system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made a much more durable,</v>

2101
01:33:00.371 --> 01:33:01.840
<v Speaker 1>much bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better insulation,</v>

2102
01:33:01.841 --> 01:33:03.610
<v Speaker 1>like he's turned them into these </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible,</v>

2103
01:33:03.790 --> 01:33:06.680
<v Speaker 1>like complete next level devices.</v>

<v Speaker 1>so the best places in California.</v>

2105
01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:14.820
<v Speaker 1>If there's another place that's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>austin that is probably right up there </v>

2106
01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:16.450
<v Speaker 1>and that place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

2107
01:33:16.451 --> 01:33:19.120
<v Speaker 1>I forget the name of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it on my instagram feed.</v>

2108
01:33:19.121 --> 01:33:21.160
<v Speaker 1>All this man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need all this information.</v>

2109
01:33:21.610 --> 01:33:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Do you live in California?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2110
01:33:23.561 --> 01:33:25.750
<v Speaker 1>well if you live in California then </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one place to go.</v>

2111
01:33:25.751 --> 01:33:26.980
<v Speaker 1>That's the float lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's.</v>

2112
01:33:27.010 --> 01:33:32.010
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the video and here's </v>
<v Speaker 1>joe's isolation tank he had at his </v>

2113
01:33:32.010 --> 01:33:32.010
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is his old one,</v>

2114
01:33:32.010 --> 01:33:35.260
<v Speaker 8>the amazon indians,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and he brought it back to them.</v>

2115
01:33:35.530 --> 01:33:38.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the movie altered </v>
<v Speaker 1>states,</v>

2116
01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:41.830
<v Speaker 1>which is where I found out about </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolation tank.</v>

2117
01:33:44.130 --> 01:33:49.130
<v Speaker 8>It was like 11 or 12 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 8>returns back into the box after double </v>

2118
01:33:49.951 --> 01:33:52.170
<v Speaker 8>filter.</v>
<v Speaker 8>On top of that,</v>

2119
01:33:52.290 --> 01:33:57.290
<v Speaker 8>I also have this right here,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is a an oxygen scrubber just like </v>

2120
01:33:57.290 --> 01:33:59.130
<v Speaker 8>they have at those oxygen bars.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

2121
01:33:59.131 --> 01:34:00.420
<v Speaker 8>this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this little machine right here,</v>

2122
01:34:00.421 --> 01:34:02.910
<v Speaker 8>pulls oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 8>pure oxygen out of the air,</v>

2123
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:08.030
<v Speaker 8>and it pumps it through this to where </v>
<v Speaker 8>this gets it all gets pumped into the </v>

2124
01:34:08.461 --> 01:34:11.780
<v Speaker 8>tank while I'm lying in it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I get pure oxygen,</v>

2125
01:34:11.910 --> 01:34:13.980
<v Speaker 8>oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which is amazing for your mind anyway.</v>

2126
01:34:13.981 --> 01:34:16.950
<v Speaker 8>It makes you feel very refreshed.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then on top of that,</v>

2127
01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:22.040
<v Speaker 8>I'm in this weightless body list </v>
<v Speaker 8>experience where you and your thoughts </v>

2128
01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:27.680
<v Speaker 8>usually my experience it takes 20 </v>
<v Speaker 8>minutes is always be thinking about my </v>

2129
01:34:28.051 --> 01:34:29.850
<v Speaker 8>life,</v>
<v Speaker 8>me thinking about my friendships,</v>

2130
01:34:29.851 --> 01:34:32.190
<v Speaker 8>my relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what the fuck</v>

2131
01:34:32.330 --> 01:34:37.330
<v Speaker 1>you underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just saId so much salt in the </v>

2132
01:34:37.330 --> 01:34:39.310
<v Speaker 1>water that when you lie in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just float,</v>

2133
01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:44.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're like half your body's above </v>

2134
01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:45.070
<v Speaker 1>the water like this much and everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind it is underwater.</v>

2135
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:49.090
<v Speaker 1>So like your ears are underwater so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can either wear earplugs if you want.</v>

2136
01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:50.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't usually wear earplugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just get in.</v>

2137
01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:54.530
<v Speaker 1>But some people like earplugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just rent your ears,</v>

2138
01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:59.210
<v Speaker 1>you float and you're in total silence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the total darkness?</v>

2139
01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Total darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it varies.</v>

2140
01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:03.590
<v Speaker 1>If you feel like you're flying through </v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

2141
01:35:03.591 --> 01:35:05.360
<v Speaker 1>Like I recently got graham hancock into </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2142
01:35:05.361 --> 01:35:10.361
<v Speaker 1>he just did a couple of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>THen that's his description of what he </v>

2143
01:35:10.361 --> 01:35:10.361
<v Speaker 1>said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like you're in space,</v>

2144
01:35:10.361 --> 01:35:13.400
<v Speaker 1>you're flying because you're weightless </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as you're lying there like floating.</v>

2145
01:35:13.401 --> 01:35:15.290
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That never happens in life.</v>

2146
01:35:15.291 --> 01:35:18.080
<v Speaker 1>We don't feel like there's anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding you down.</v>

2147
01:35:18.230 --> 01:35:23.230
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you're flying through </v>
<v Speaker 1>space and because the fact that you're </v>

2148
01:35:23.230 --> 01:35:24.980
<v Speaker 1>in this tank with no light coming in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>no sound,</v>

2149
01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:28.760
<v Speaker 1>you have no like your brain doesn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>any work to do.</v>

2150
01:35:28.810 --> 01:35:33.810
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have to worry about your </v>

2151
01:35:33.810 --> 01:35:34.631
<v Speaker 1>balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have to worry about moving you </v>

2152
01:35:34.631 --> 01:35:34.631
<v Speaker 1>around or dealing with your environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>in any way.</v>

2153
01:35:34.631 --> 01:35:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this tank was created bY this guy who</v>

2154
01:35:37.491 --> 01:35:42.491
<v Speaker 1>is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a pioneer in inter species </v>

2155
01:35:42.491 --> 01:35:45.370
<v Speaker 1>communications with dolphins is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really crazy guy called john lilly </v>

2156
01:35:45.370 --> 01:35:49.900
<v Speaker 1>and he did all these like really </v>
<v Speaker 1>important studies with dolphins,</v>

2157
01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:53.020
<v Speaker 1>like trying to teach dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human words,</v>

2158
01:35:53.070 --> 01:35:58.070
<v Speaker 1>trying to communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the noises are so much different </v>

2159
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.070
<v Speaker 1>than ours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he did a lot of it.</v>

2160
01:35:58.070 --> 01:36:00.980
<v Speaker 1>While he's on acid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to develop a bunch of ways</v>

2161
01:36:00.981 --> 01:36:02.810
<v Speaker 1>to get outside of the influence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

2162
01:36:02.811 --> 01:36:06.910
<v Speaker 1>like he was being very scientific about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and his ideas where he,</v>

2163
01:36:06.930 --> 01:36:08.600
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to have like a scuba tank.</v>

2164
01:36:08.630 --> 01:36:13.630
<v Speaker 1>There was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had a helmet on like one of those </v>

2165
01:36:13.630 --> 01:36:16.630
<v Speaker 1>25,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>leagues under the sea type helmet he </v>

2166
01:36:16.630 --> 01:36:19.660
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking like at first we were </v>

2167
01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:19.660
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2168
01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:19.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

2169
01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:22.570
<v Speaker 1>that's what he used to have and he used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have it where it was like hooked up </v>

2170
01:36:22.570 --> 01:36:25.010
<v Speaker 1>where it was on a harness and you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be sorta just dunked in the water.</v>

2171
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:27.200
<v Speaker 1>So we'll eventually you forget about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>helmet,</v>

2172
01:36:27.201 --> 01:36:32.201
<v Speaker 1>you forget about your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just chill out and relax and the </v>

2173
01:36:32.201 --> 01:36:34.751
<v Speaker 1>water was the same temperature as your </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin so it becomes indistinguishable </v>

2174
01:36:34.751 --> 01:36:35.600
<v Speaker 1>after awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once he's got it dialed in just right.</v>

2175
01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:37.520
<v Speaker 1>You don't want it too hot because then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can sweat.</v>

2176
01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:41.320
<v Speaker 1>We don't want it to pool your cold in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and start shivering is a,</v>

2177
01:36:41.370 --> 01:36:44.960
<v Speaker 1>goldie locks 93 and a half degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 93 and a half.</v>

2178
01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Some people's 94.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a,</v>

2179
01:36:47.331 --> 01:36:48.260
<v Speaker 1>you should do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2180
01:36:48.261 --> 01:36:48.710
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2181
01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:50.330
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you got to your crib.</v>

2182
01:36:50.690 --> 01:36:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have one.</v>

2183
01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Could I come over and try?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

2184
01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:53.650
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loved to.</v>

2185
01:36:53.651 --> 01:36:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

2186
01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:58.730
<v Speaker 1>But if you wanted to get one for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>house to crash definitely sells those.</v>

2187
01:36:59.550 --> 01:37:03.620
<v Speaker 1>So I fEel like something that should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>in every university,</v>

2188
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:07.280
<v Speaker 1>it's something that should be and just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people should,</v>

2189
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:12.310
<v Speaker 1>if they have the money or they have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time or a group of people get together </v>

2190
01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:13.820
<v Speaker 1>and invest in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so beneficial and it's a,</v>

2191
01:37:13.821 --> 01:37:18.821
<v Speaker 1>it's something that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not thought of as being an </v>

2192
01:37:18.821 --> 01:37:21.281
<v Speaker 1>important tool in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ability to tune the whole world </v>

2193
01:37:21.281 --> 01:37:22.820
<v Speaker 1>out and just float.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

2194
01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you trip your balls in and out of it </v>

2195
01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:27.880
<v Speaker 1>because if somebody has to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real easy.</v>

2196
01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:29.300
<v Speaker 1>It's real easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only 11 inches of water.</v>

2197
01:37:30.710 --> 01:37:35.710
<v Speaker 1>So as you're lying there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean you just stand up when you're </v>

2198
01:37:35.710 --> 01:37:35.810
<v Speaker 1>done and you just get out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>IT's nothing.</v>

2199
01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:37.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

2200
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:40.850
<v Speaker 1>you can't drown the waters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 inches and it's only six feet wide.</v>

2201
01:37:40.851 --> 01:37:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Just you touched the sides with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

2202
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:48.070
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You center yourself in the middle and </v>

2203
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:48.110
<v Speaker 1>relax and when you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get more and more comfortable.</v>

2204
01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Every time you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time you do it,</v>

2205
01:37:49.731 --> 01:37:51.620
<v Speaker 1>it'll be a little weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody's described.</v>

2206
01:37:51.621 --> 01:37:55.770
<v Speaker 1>It pretty much says what I always have </v>
<v Speaker 1>said like the first couple times,</v>

2207
01:37:55.771 --> 01:37:59.250
<v Speaker 1>it's just about getting to relax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how to relax.</v>

2208
01:37:59.330 --> 01:38:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Once you've done it like a few dozen </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

2209
01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:06.680
<v Speaker 1>then it just becomes that thing you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>just get in there and you just say that </v>

2210
01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:10.520
<v Speaker 1>for me is giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever there's any issues that I'm </v>

2211
01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:10.520
<v Speaker 1>dealing with and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2212
01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:12.060
<v Speaker 1>any problems that I have maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatively even,</v>

2213
01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:13.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to go in there,</v>

2214
01:38:13.291 --> 01:38:14.940
<v Speaker 1>I'll go in there with jujitsu problems.</v>

2215
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.300
<v Speaker 1>I'll go in there with a try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like try to analyze someone's movements.</v>

2216
01:38:18.301 --> 01:38:23.301
<v Speaker 1>Like if there's a guy who like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps catching me with a particular </v>

2217
01:38:23.301 --> 01:38:23.301
<v Speaker 1>submission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

2218
01:38:23.301 --> 01:38:27.500
<v Speaker 1>I would go in the tank and I would try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to work out like the defense for the </v>

2219
01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:28.230
<v Speaker 1>submission in the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2220
01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:33.280
<v Speaker 1>It would go with like a specific goal in</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind because it makes your brain like </v>

2221
01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:35.580
<v Speaker 1>supercharged because we don't like when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting here,</v>

2222
01:38:35.581 --> 01:38:40.581
<v Speaker 1>I got a super uncomfortable chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is this thing called a saddle </v>

2223
01:38:40.581 --> 01:38:42.230
<v Speaker 1>chair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sally's swinging something chair.</v>

2224
01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:45.810
<v Speaker 1>It's super uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really good for your back.</v>

2225
01:38:46.230 --> 01:38:48.900
<v Speaker 1>it makes you sit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you sit like an arrow,</v>

2226
01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:50.430
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2227
01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:52.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's stupid.</v>

2228
01:38:52.111 --> 01:38:53.760
<v Speaker 1>Uncomfortable men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was my point?</v>

2229
01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:56.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was saying that like,</v>

2230
01:38:56.580 --> 01:39:01.580
<v Speaker 1>I completely lost my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We picked up the soap to show the </v>

2231
01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:01.580
<v Speaker 1>fucking chair.</v>

2232
01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:05.660
<v Speaker 1>But was I saying just before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of you guys know I was listening to</v>

2233
01:39:05.690 --> 01:39:10.690
<v Speaker 1>three people in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a sure sign that saying it was </v>

2234
01:39:13.470 --> 01:39:16.500
<v Speaker 1>very ineffective because no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>remembers that at all.</v>

2235
01:39:16.900 --> 01:39:19.820
<v Speaker 1>I was falling short term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Memory's a motherfucker man.</v>

2236
01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:20.440
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2237
01:39:20.450 --> 01:39:21.970
<v Speaker 1>where are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2238
01:39:22.230 --> 01:39:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about a sensory </v>

2239
01:39:27.230 --> 01:39:27.540
<v Speaker 1>deprivation because this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gives me a lot of sensory input.</v>

2240
01:39:27.541 --> 01:39:29.520
<v Speaker 1>It's uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like pinching my dick.</v>

2241
01:39:29.670 --> 01:39:33.600
<v Speaker 1>You gotta squeeze your legs together to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit up and when you're sitting in it,</v>

2242
01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:38.620
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly kind of working out </v>

2243
01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:38.620
<v Speaker 1>your legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're pinching your legs together.</v>

2244
01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:42.240
<v Speaker 1>It's the only way you can sit up as if </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the key to it.</v>

2245
01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:45.420
<v Speaker 1>The key to it is it's uncomfortable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you do sit like that,</v>

2246
01:39:45.450 --> 01:39:50.450
<v Speaker 1>it activates your and it's actually good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your back and it makes my back feel </v>

2247
01:39:50.450 --> 01:39:50.450
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

2248
01:39:50.450 --> 01:39:52.020
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do a three hour podcasts.</v>

2249
01:39:52.021 --> 01:39:57.021
<v Speaker 1>My back doesn't fuck with me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if I sit in a regular chair </v>

2250
01:39:57.021 --> 01:39:57.240
<v Speaker 1>after like three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like tight.</v>

2251
01:39:57.410 --> 01:39:59.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like kinked up.</v>

2252
01:39:59.490 --> 01:40:02.970
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't do that at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of sensory input.</v>

2253
01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:08.240
<v Speaker 1>I think when you're dealing with like </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a keyboard in front of you or </v>

2254
01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:08.360
<v Speaker 1>did you see that light?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

2255
01:40:08.370 --> 01:40:09.900
<v Speaker 1>this clock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>YoU see all these different things.</v>

2256
01:40:09.901 --> 01:40:14.901
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're taking in your entire </v>

2257
01:40:14.901 --> 01:40:16.821
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're feeling the gravity of your body </v>

2258
01:40:16.821 --> 01:40:17.010
<v Speaker 1>pulling the chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all these things that your brain</v>

2259
01:40:17.011 --> 01:40:22.011
<v Speaker 1>is calculating and if there was some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people next to you there were screaming </v>

2260
01:40:22.011 --> 01:40:24.741
<v Speaker 1>and yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be really hard to pay attention to </v>

2261
01:40:24.741 --> 01:40:26.601
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes we do these podcasts and </v>

2262
01:40:26.601 --> 01:40:26.601
<v Speaker 1>they'll be unloading trucks and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear the trucks.</v>

2263
01:40:26.601 --> 01:40:26.680
<v Speaker 1>The background.</v>

2264
01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:29.640
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

2265
01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:34.640
<v Speaker 1>we're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hydraulics and the engines and shit </v>

2266
01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:37.250
<v Speaker 1>and it's distracting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you wish that it would go away </v>

2267
01:40:37.250 --> 01:40:40.250
<v Speaker 1>because then you'd be able to formulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts without any resistance </v>

2268
01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:40.250
<v Speaker 1>with less resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>RIght?</v>

2269
01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're in that tank,</v>

2270
01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:45.950
<v Speaker 1>that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's that state at its best </v>

2271
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:48.000
<v Speaker 1>because there's nothing coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing coming in.</v>

2272
01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:53.240
<v Speaker 1>It's just your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing coming in and when you </v>

2273
01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:53.240
<v Speaker 1>get to that place where there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in,</v>

2274
01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:55.030
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

2275
01:40:55.060 --> 01:40:56.950
<v Speaker 1>you get a real chance to like go over </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2276
01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Creative stuff or personal stuff or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2277
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:05.790
<v Speaker 1>problems like if you play a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's anything that you do where </v>

2278
01:41:05.790 --> 01:41:09.961
<v Speaker 1>you constantly working on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some guys play golf or some guys </v>

2279
01:41:09.961 --> 01:41:11.020
<v Speaker 1>you can get in that tank and just think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about all the various things.</v>

2280
01:41:11.021 --> 01:41:16.021
<v Speaker 1>Various aspects of anything you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to concentrate on and it offers </v>

2281
01:41:16.021 --> 01:41:18.100
<v Speaker 1>you this window of concentration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just uNavailable any other way.</v>

2282
01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:23.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean I definitely need to try it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've heard a lot about it,</v>

2283
01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:28.410
<v Speaker 1>but I never really knew what it was and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really know how you would go </v>

2284
01:41:28.410 --> 01:41:28.410
<v Speaker 1>about doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super easy.</v>

2285
01:41:28.410 --> 01:41:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Another thIng too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like who do you ask,</v>

2286
01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:35.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's with anything like right now </v>

2287
01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:37.981
<v Speaker 1>there's less of them than they should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There should be all over the place and </v>

2288
01:41:37.981 --> 01:41:40.460
<v Speaker 1>people are starting to open a business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be a place where you just go,</v>

2289
01:41:40.490 --> 01:41:41.920
<v Speaker 1>like they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2290
01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:43.660
<v Speaker 1>they have them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of them that are popping</v>

2291
01:41:43.661 --> 01:41:48.661
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple of them in California </v>

2292
01:41:48.661 --> 01:41:48.661
<v Speaker 1>but only a couple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I know that,</v>

2293
01:41:48.661 --> 01:41:52.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that the guys that run on the </v>

2294
01:41:52.930 --> 01:41:55.051
<v Speaker 1>map,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but thinking about starting one and I </v>

2295
01:41:55.051 --> 01:41:55.330
<v Speaker 1>know that crash is opening up a bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>one in westwood.</v>

2296
01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:58.780
<v Speaker 1>It's just very under as far as like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of demand.</v>

2297
01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:02.680
<v Speaker 1>It's very underutilized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That demand is under tapped into because</v>

2298
01:42:02.681 --> 01:42:05.440
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people would like it at</v>
<v Speaker 1>burbank.</v>

2299
01:42:05.441 --> 01:42:06.580
<v Speaker 1>One's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

2300
01:42:06.610 --> 01:42:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Soothing solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is in burbank,</v>

2301
01:42:08.381 --> 01:42:13.381
<v Speaker 1>which is where I first went in like 2002</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I got hooked immediately.</v>

2302
01:42:14.710 --> 01:42:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't.</v>

2303
01:42:16.030 --> 01:42:21.030
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't imagine that this was </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that so few people were </v>

2304
01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:21.030
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to try it,</v>

2305
01:42:21.190 --> 01:42:26.190
<v Speaker 1>try it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you were actually the first </v>

2306
01:42:26.190 --> 01:42:27.721
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might have heard about it in another </v>

2307
01:42:27.721 --> 01:42:30.061
<v Speaker 1>conversation too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you were the first person I heard </v>

2308
01:42:30.061 --> 01:42:30.580
<v Speaker 1>talk about it extensively in detail and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't this video.</v>

2309
01:42:30.581 --> 01:42:32.370
<v Speaker 1>I heard you talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of your podcasts.</v>

2310
01:42:32.371 --> 01:42:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't shut the fuck up about it.</v>

2311
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:36.070
<v Speaker 1>And people get mad when you have one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2312
01:42:36.071 --> 01:42:38.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

2313
01:42:38.411 --> 01:42:40.150
<v Speaker 1>if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't tried it,</v>

2314
01:42:40.151 --> 01:42:41.020
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>

2315
01:42:41.150 --> 01:42:44.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you for your own good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm beating a dead horse,</v>

2316
01:42:44.111 --> 01:42:46.980
<v Speaker 1>I apologize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just wanted to.</v>

2317
01:42:46.981 --> 01:42:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Lucky sons of bitches that has one in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his house.</v>

2318
01:42:49.890 --> 01:42:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Any luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that do.</v>

2319
01:42:51.790 --> 01:42:54.490
<v Speaker 1>They do renovations to their house and </v>
<v Speaker 1>do all these different things.</v>

2320
01:42:54.491 --> 01:42:56.390
<v Speaker 1>they spend a lot of money and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

2321
01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:59.740
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't even come into the realm of</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility.</v>

2322
01:42:59.741 --> 01:43:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Like we've got to get a hot tub that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2323
01:43:02.050 --> 01:43:04.990
<v Speaker 1>People love to get hot tub on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike and sue got a new hot tub.</v>

2324
01:43:04.991 --> 01:43:06.700
<v Speaker 1>What's just come on over and we'll go </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit in the jacuzzi.</v>

2325
01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>

2326
01:43:07.541 --> 01:43:11.500
<v Speaker 1>What is this rania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was about five grand more bob and they</v>

2327
01:43:11.501 --> 01:43:14.050
<v Speaker 1>have these fucking stupid conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if one of them said,</v>

2328
01:43:14.051 --> 01:43:19.051
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about getting an isolation </v>

2329
01:43:19.051 --> 01:43:19.051
<v Speaker 1>tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like you could get one for less</v>

2330
01:43:19.051 --> 01:43:19.051
<v Speaker 1>than now.</v>

2331
01:43:19.051 --> 01:43:23.850
<v Speaker 1>I think a company called zen float,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make one that's like really </v>

2332
01:43:23.850 --> 01:43:23.980
<v Speaker 1>inexpensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like 1700 bucks,</v>

2333
01:43:24.150 --> 01:43:26.590
<v Speaker 1>like the least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The least expensive one.</v>

2334
01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:29.560
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same as like crashes not </v>
<v Speaker 1>even close.</v>

2335
01:43:30.010 --> 01:43:32.230
<v Speaker 1>It's flimsy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it'll work.</v>

2336
01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:33.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

2337
01:43:33.370 --> 01:43:36.820
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno how it deadens the sound anyway,</v>

2338
01:43:36.821 --> 01:43:38.980
<v Speaker 1>but I guess being underwater deadens the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sound,</v>

2339
01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:40.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it works great.</v>

2340
01:43:40.661 --> 01:43:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at is definitely better than</v>

2341
01:43:43.451 --> 01:43:46.300
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kids are talking about us on twitter</v>

2342
01:43:46.301 --> 01:43:47.860
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't pay attention to that shit.</v>

2343
01:43:48.030 --> 01:43:48.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

2344
01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:53.940
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's being mean to you so you pay to </v>

2345
01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:53.940
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love it.</v>

2346
01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Of course they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love us.</v>

2347
01:43:54.740 --> 01:43:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Pistol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you up though.</v>

2348
01:43:55.671 --> 01:43:57.430
<v Speaker 1>You can't be doing that while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a podcast.</v>

2349
01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:01.970
<v Speaker 1>We never get to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll be doing no talking on here.</v>

2350
01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Kicking it.</v>

2351
01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:06.160
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what how you feel right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't worry about that shit,</v>

2352
01:44:06.210 --> 01:44:07.670
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't trust them.</v>

2353
01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Can't trust them with your thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dawn of the dead.</v>

2354
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:13.300
<v Speaker 1>You got a dog dead shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2355
01:44:13.310 --> 01:44:15.770
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a dope fucking horror movie.</v>

2356
01:44:15.771 --> 01:44:18.460
<v Speaker 1>That was scary as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2357
01:44:18.530 --> 01:44:23.530
<v Speaker 1>When that movie came out and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going through the mall when the zombies </v>

2358
01:44:23.530 --> 01:44:25.460
<v Speaker 1>were wandering through the mall to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't know all these people today</v>

2359
01:44:25.461 --> 01:44:30.461
<v Speaker 1>that are so spoiled because we've had </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a billion fucking zombie movies </v>

2360
01:44:30.461 --> 01:44:32.240
<v Speaker 1>back then with dawn of the dead was </v>
<v Speaker 1>around when that first movie,</v>

2361
01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:35.570
<v Speaker 1>that movie first came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a game changer that make people</v>

2362
01:44:35.571 --> 01:44:37.380
<v Speaker 1>shit their pants and I think that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2363
01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:42.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big walking dead fan and you're </v>

2364
01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:42.580
<v Speaker 1>walking just so like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2365
01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:42.580
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

2366
01:44:42.710 --> 01:44:45.170
<v Speaker 3>greg nicotero who's just like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2367
01:44:45.171 --> 01:44:46.580
<v Speaker 3>special effects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lagging,</v>

2368
01:44:46.581 --> 01:44:49.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did a lot of the earlier special effects</v>

2369
01:44:49.461 --> 01:44:50.810
<v Speaker 3>in these movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2370
01:44:50.811 --> 01:44:55.811
<v Speaker 3>and just to see walking dead and see </v>
<v Speaker 3>like just how they use real practical </v>

2371
01:44:55.811 --> 01:44:57.140
<v Speaker 3>effects and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The gore is just so real looking.</v>

2372
01:44:57.210 --> 01:44:58.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sick man.</v>

2373
01:44:58.730 --> 01:45:01.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm just a horror movie fanatic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2374
01:45:01.161 --> 01:45:06.161
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've just been obsessed with horses </v>

2375
01:45:06.161 --> 01:45:06.161
<v Speaker 3>since I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2376
01:45:06.161 --> 01:45:09.130
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that bugs me about the </v>

2377
01:45:09.130 --> 01:45:09.200
<v Speaker 1>walking dead is uniformity of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>slash or sounds.</v>

2378
01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:15.110
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean somebody up when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're killing people and stuff,</v>

2379
01:45:15.140 --> 01:45:16.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're hacking up zombies.</v>

2380
01:45:16.810 --> 01:45:20.210
<v Speaker 1>The sounds are all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2381
01:45:21.020 --> 01:45:24.470
<v Speaker 1>A lot of variety and the sounds they </v>
<v Speaker 1>make when they cut open their heads,</v>

2382
01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:25.970
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get gruesome.</v>

2383
01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:28.760
<v Speaker 1>It's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always the same coach.</v>

2384
01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:31.310
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the cat sound.</v>

2385
01:45:31.311 --> 01:45:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Every time somebody throws something out</v>
<v Speaker 1>the window,</v>

2386
01:45:32.931 --> 01:45:36.680
<v Speaker 1>it's always the exact same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like super exaggerated.</v>

2387
01:45:36.681 --> 01:45:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just like a little realism,</v>

2388
01:45:38.361 --> 01:45:40.670
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes when you hit someone in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the head with a bat,</v>

2389
01:45:40.671 --> 01:45:45.671
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make the best sound like </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you just graze them and it </v>

2390
01:45:45.671 --> 01:45:47.630
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that same every time.</v>

2391
01:45:47.631 --> 01:45:51.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's got a bat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bat specialists,</v>

2392
01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:52.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just know well,</v>

2393
01:45:52.671 --> 01:45:54.620
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a lot of zombie movies pro.</v>

2394
01:45:54.650 --> 01:45:58.360
<v Speaker 1>I know if done correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes it different.</v>

2395
01:45:58.370 --> 01:46:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like the best was 28 days later </v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion.</v>

2396
01:46:01.881 --> 01:46:04.380
<v Speaker 1>That's the best movie of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shannon,</v>

2397
01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:06.650
<v Speaker 1>did you see the second one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was fun.</v>

2398
01:46:06.890 --> 01:46:08.750
<v Speaker 1>That was really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was great.</v>

2399
01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:10.970
<v Speaker 1>Twenty eight weeks later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was great to look.</v>

2400
01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:11.870
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was.</v>

2401
01:46:12.110 --> 01:46:15.560
<v Speaker 1>There was a difference in the zombies </v>
<v Speaker 1>were scary as fuck.</v>

2402
01:46:15.561 --> 01:46:19.250
<v Speaker 1>they ran at you and they could bite you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it got in you,</v>

2403
01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:24.300
<v Speaker 1>you would instantly turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that there were some wild </v>

2404
01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:24.420
<v Speaker 1>scenes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That is dark.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's how those guys do is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is sick.</v>

2421
01:47:04.231 --> 01:47:07.230
<v Speaker 1>It takes a certain level of expertise </v>
<v Speaker 1>and taste and uh,</v>

2422
01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:08.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Anybody that can do a horror movie with </v>

<v Speaker 1>no cgi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean bravo and then still be funny and</v>

2425
01:47:15.151 --> 01:47:17.340
<v Speaker 1>believable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like or tv show or anything.</v>

2426
01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:18.570
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2427
01:47:18.630 --> 01:47:22.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how it's really hard.</v>

2428
01:47:22.980 --> 01:47:26.340
<v Speaker 1>These guys like pat mcgee is the guy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>did the werewolf out there.</v>

2429
01:47:26.670 --> 01:47:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Just the walked in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2430
01:47:29.101 --> 01:47:30.300
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2431
01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:33.260
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm in the right place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rick baker where,</v>

2432
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:38.270
<v Speaker 1>well from american werewolf in london </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the beautiful things about </v>

2433
01:47:38.270 --> 01:47:40.911
<v Speaker 1>that movie was that there was no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>cgi was all rick baker's creation and </v>

2434
01:47:40.911 --> 01:47:42.210
<v Speaker 1>they had to show it to you in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>little flashes.</v>

2435
01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:45.240
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't just show you so much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>It like they do today.</v>

2436
01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Like now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2437
01:47:46.951 --> 01:47:51.951
<v Speaker 1>the monster's look way better for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're showing you too much.</v>

2438
01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:55.890
<v Speaker 1>So in showing you too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually,</v>

2439
01:47:55.910 --> 01:48:00.910
<v Speaker 1>it actually looks shittier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of monster movies </v>

2440
01:48:00.910 --> 01:48:01.050
<v Speaker 1>where like one of the weird things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters,</v>

2441
01:48:01.051 --> 01:48:05.990
<v Speaker 1>like a real monster movie is you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>them so briefly before they kill you,</v>

2442
01:48:06.330 --> 01:48:06.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2443
01:48:06.871 --> 01:48:08.220
<v Speaker 1>oh jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you're dead.</v>

2444
01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:12.510
<v Speaker 1>I can sort of represented that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>american werewolf in london.</v>

2445
01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:16.210
<v Speaker 1>But you saw that thing for like a frame </v>
<v Speaker 1>to frame it.</v>

2446
01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:21.580
<v Speaker 1>You were shitting your pants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy was running to the subway and </v>

2447
01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:25.041
<v Speaker 1>there's a brief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like couple of frames where the </v>

2448
01:48:25.041 --> 01:48:26.700
<v Speaker 1>werewolf's at the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>escalator and it's down there and he's,</v>

2449
01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:29.400
<v Speaker 1>he's traveling up and he sees the </v>
<v Speaker 1>werewolf starting to make its way up the</v>

2450
01:48:29.401 --> 01:48:34.401
<v Speaker 1>escalator and shit in his pants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a couple seconds and it's gone and </v>

2451
01:48:34.401 --> 01:48:34.401
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god damn it.</v>

2452
01:48:34.401 --> 01:48:37.400
<v Speaker 1>It's so much better than showing people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a cgi,</v>

2453
01:48:37.410 --> 01:48:41.380
<v Speaker 1>like those movies that are kind of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Underworld,</v>

2454
01:48:41.410 --> 01:48:46.080
<v Speaker 1>that was kind of underworld movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were will hour of screentime.</v>

2455
01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:48.150
<v Speaker 1>There's A wearable if you get used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing it.</v>

2456
01:48:49.490 --> 01:48:51.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2457
01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:55.080
<v Speaker 1>if you can tease the audience and build </v>
<v Speaker 1>up that anticipation,</v>

2458
01:48:55.081 --> 01:48:55.680
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2459
01:48:56.350 --> 01:48:57.930
<v Speaker 1>because you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2460
01:48:57.931 --> 01:49:02.931
<v Speaker 1>do the cgi and make you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the monster look more present in the </v>

2461
01:49:03.181 --> 01:49:04.080
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2462
01:49:04.081 --> 01:49:07.010
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like the people aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about that.</v>

2463
01:49:07.010 --> 01:49:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Give it to them in doses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some movies have done it,</v>

2464
01:49:10.050 --> 01:49:10.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dope.</v>

2465
01:49:10.681 --> 01:49:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Like I liked cloverfield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was sick.</v>

2466
01:49:12.691 --> 01:49:15.870
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new godzilla I thought was dope.</v>

2467
01:49:16.050 --> 01:49:18.300
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't mad at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fun to watch,</v>

2468
01:49:19.150 --> 01:49:21.180
<v Speaker 1>kept surviving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bummed me out a little bit.</v>

2469
01:49:21.850 --> 01:49:24.120
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker has the worst luck.</v>

2470
01:49:24.121 --> 01:49:29.121
<v Speaker 1>yet the best luck ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He keeps getting these cataclysmic </v>

2471
01:49:29.121 --> 01:49:29.490
<v Speaker 1>situations that keeps getting out with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bandaid.</v>

2472
01:49:31.290 --> 01:49:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else is dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fucking dude rises from every </v>

2473
01:49:36.290 --> 01:49:36.700
<v Speaker 1>brushes himself off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to fight god's.</v>

2474
01:49:36.701 --> 01:49:41.701
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not freaking the fuck out that a </v>

2475
01:49:41.701 --> 01:49:41.701
<v Speaker 1>bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just missed it.</v>

2476
01:49:41.701 --> 01:49:41.701
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2477
01:49:41.701 --> 01:49:46.341
<v Speaker 1>we gotta get godzilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could've saved my family and get </v>

2478
01:49:46.341 --> 01:49:47.160
<v Speaker 1>godzilla stone seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

2479
01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Is it the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worth seeing just for the end </v>

2480
01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:54.181
<v Speaker 1>scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just for the fight scene between </v>

2481
01:49:54.181 --> 01:49:54.181
<v Speaker 1>godzilla and the other monster.</v>

2482
01:49:54.181 --> 01:49:55.360
<v Speaker 1>That's prettY dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't expecting that.</v>

2483
01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:00.600
<v Speaker 1>That was pretty dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it reminds you that like </v>

2484
01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:01.540
<v Speaker 1>godzilla is really about godzilla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Godzilla is a hero movie.</v>

2485
01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:05.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like godzilla is a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Godzilla is a hero.</v>

2486
01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:07.870
<v Speaker 1>So it's king kong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are here in movies like you can't,</v>

2487
01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:09.580
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not scary movies.</v>

2488
01:50:09.810 --> 01:50:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not like a monster movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like king kong.</v>

2489
01:50:11.531 --> 01:50:13.330
<v Speaker 1>You only see them in brief second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't work.</v>

2490
01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Like that's one of the main problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>with like special effects and a movie </v>

2491
01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:22.231
<v Speaker 1>like king kong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it always had to be special </v>

2492
01:50:22.231 --> 01:50:23.170
<v Speaker 1>effects from the 1930 movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you got to see him all the time.</v>

2493
01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:28.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not like this monster you briefly </v>
<v Speaker 1>see for a second and then it gets you </v>

2494
01:50:28.830 --> 01:50:30.720
<v Speaker 1>like the original alien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2495
01:50:30.730 --> 01:50:35.730
<v Speaker 1>but that's the shit that aliens is </v>
<v Speaker 1>always going to be a classic and </v>

2496
01:50:35.730 --> 01:50:37.530
<v Speaker 1>original one was the best because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>put all these sought.</v>

2497
01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:43.460
<v Speaker 1>I think they all were kind of like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>though because in the environments that </v>

2498
01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:46.921
<v Speaker 1>they were at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just so fucking shady like </v>

2499
01:50:46.921 --> 01:50:49.590
<v Speaker 1>spaceships and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the second one was pretty fuckIng </v>

2500
01:50:49.590 --> 01:50:51.250
<v Speaker 1>dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a James Cameron one aliens.</v>

2501
01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:56.400
<v Speaker 1>But it was different than the first one </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the first one you barely saw </v>

2502
01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:56.920
<v Speaker 1>that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barely saw it.</v>

2503
01:50:57.190 --> 01:51:02.190
<v Speaker 1>It was always sneaking by the time they </v>
<v Speaker 1>signed it would be on them and it would </v>

2504
01:51:02.190 --> 01:51:03.220
<v Speaker 1>kill them and that'll be it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the second one,</v>

2505
01:51:03.221 --> 01:51:04.900
<v Speaker 1>they're everywhere and they're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting them and killing them.</v>

2506
01:51:04.901 --> 01:51:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Like they kill them so much easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one,</v>

2507
01:51:07.451 --> 01:51:10.750
<v Speaker 1>it was like this super intelligent thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was sneaking up on you.</v>

2508
01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:16.200
<v Speaker 1>It was like some super genius alien and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second one it was like this trailer </v>

2509
01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:19.630
<v Speaker 1>park aliens and there was a million of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and theY were all idiots.</v>

2510
01:51:19.630 --> 01:51:22.600
<v Speaker 1>There were all idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the first alien was brilliant,</v>

2511
01:51:23.060 --> 01:51:28.060
<v Speaker 1>so clever and sneaky to go or a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people were going and it would be </v>

2512
01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:33.120
<v Speaker 1>ambushed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would hide and then the second movie </v>

2513
01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:34.250
<v Speaker 1>there were all dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were just jacking them.</v>

2514
01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:37.210
<v Speaker 1>They would just run into a room and kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>four or five of them.</v>

2515
01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:41.820
<v Speaker 1>The third one was my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really would rock the rock was.</v>

2516
01:51:43.150 --> 01:51:44.320
<v Speaker 1>He's a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2517
01:51:44.321 --> 01:51:49.321
<v Speaker 1>I met that dude once to show them like </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those a talk show type things </v>

2518
01:51:49.901 --> 01:51:52.570
<v Speaker 1>back when he was doing that show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was cool as fuck.</v>

2519
01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:53.530
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he seems cool,</v>

2520
01:51:53.590 --> 01:51:55.790
<v Speaker 1>very frIendly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was a bad ass in that movie.</v>

2521
01:51:55.791 --> 01:51:58.120
<v Speaker 1>He was the only person that ever seen in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole franchise.</v>

2522
01:51:58.121 --> 01:51:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Go toe to toe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2523
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:03.340
<v Speaker 1>Go toe to toe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't winona ryder in that one too?</v>

2524
01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Was she in the fourth one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of you?</v>

2525
01:52:06.750 --> 01:52:09.190
<v Speaker 1>I know that one was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in the third one,</v>

2526
01:52:09.191 --> 01:52:09.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I right?</v>

2527
01:52:10.270 --> 01:52:12.610
<v Speaker 1>I think so because that was the one she </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed herself.</v>

2528
01:52:13.190 --> 01:52:14.990
<v Speaker 1>She had the babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had the baby.</v>

2529
01:52:16.230 --> 01:52:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just wanting to kill the baby and </v>

2530
01:52:21.230 --> 01:52:22.100
<v Speaker 1>that was the one that was the one where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was down there.</v>

2531
01:52:22.101 --> 01:52:25.950
<v Speaker 1>But the score up with the dude because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he ran out of ammo was like,</v>

2532
01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:27.760
<v Speaker 1>is that all you got?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was like fighting them.</v>

2533
01:52:27.970 --> 01:52:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

2534
01:52:29.110 --> 01:52:31.480
<v Speaker 1>So fucking g.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2535
01:52:31.780 --> 01:52:34.440
<v Speaker 1>that didn't end well though for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2536
01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:35.170
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2537
01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:38.560
<v Speaker 1>we don't make movIes like that and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't make it.</v>

2538
01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:41.110
<v Speaker 1>But he is poppy like in a horror movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

2539
01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:45.290
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even call it a horror movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like more like a spy know throw.</v>

2540
01:52:45.291 --> 01:52:46.910
<v Speaker 1>The first one was a horror movie.</v>

2541
01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but did that,</v>

2542
01:52:47.671 --> 01:52:49.610
<v Speaker 1>that third by the third one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just more like a.</v>

2543
01:52:49.970 --> 01:52:52.520
<v Speaker 1>It didn't come off more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was more like action insight by.</v>

2544
01:52:52.530 --> 01:52:55.760
<v Speaker 1>But that was the only time I've ever </v>

01:53:34.011 --> 01:53:36.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is you to.</v>

2563
01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:41.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a slow degradation from like one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest horror movies of all time.</v>

2564
01:53:41.241 --> 01:53:45.500
<v Speaker 1>I really scott masterpiece to like this </v>

2567
01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:50.870
<v Speaker 1>I watched the alien versus one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them,</v>

2568
01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:56.080

2570
01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:00.830
<v Speaker 1>If I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me guess.</v>

2571
01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:04.310
<v Speaker 1>I want to say this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three or 4 million predators.</v>

2572
01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Don't believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember there was one.</v>

2573
01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:09.260
<v Speaker 1>There's only to get the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

2574
01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:12.410

<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was a tv show.</v>

2575
01:54:12.770 --> 01:54:13.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:45.750
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the original one piece.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The new ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's three.</v>

2591
01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2592
01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:51.830
<v Speaker 1>The one that just came out with mark </v>
<v Speaker 1>wahlberg.</v>

2593
01:54:52.010 --> 01:54:53.480
<v Speaker 1>That's the third one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many aliens?</v>

2594
01:54:53.481 --> 01:54:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Racist predators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it just too too?</v>

2595
01:54:56.540 --> 01:54:58.410
<v Speaker 1>It looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2596
01:54:59.330 --> 01:55:01.070
<v Speaker 1>I would have assumed there was more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2597
01:55:01.071 --> 01:55:01.970
<v Speaker 1>I ain't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2598
01:55:02.270 --> 01:55:07.270
<v Speaker 1>what was the alien resident?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the one that was for dna.</v>

2599
01:55:08.930 --> 01:55:13.930
<v Speaker 1>They somehow or another got her dna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cloned her and it was weird cause </v>

2600
01:55:15.090 --> 01:55:17.920
<v Speaker 1>it's happening back.</v>

2601
01:55:17.950 --> 01:55:20.870
<v Speaker 1>And then there was the atheist movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was weird as fuck too.</v>

2602
01:55:21.130 --> 01:55:22.430
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they're going to do another </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

2603
01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:23.750
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2604
01:55:24.330 --> 01:55:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Prometheans could have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

2605
01:55:26.690 --> 01:55:27.770
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we said,</v>

2606
01:55:27.771 --> 01:55:29.780
<v Speaker 1>like the idea of putting together a </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

2607
01:55:30.290 --> 01:55:32.280
<v Speaker 1>just the idea of getting all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people together.</v>

2608
01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:33.940
<v Speaker 1>I enjoY it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2609
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:37.110
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't the perfect saifai movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the original one,</v>

2610
01:55:37.111 --> 01:55:40.160
<v Speaker 1>but I enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was fun and I love the idea</v>

2611
01:55:40.161 --> 01:55:42.550
<v Speaker 1>behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of like,</v>

2612
01:55:42.590 --> 01:55:45.730
<v Speaker 1>that's he introduces his dna into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2613
01:55:45.731 --> 01:55:50.731
<v Speaker 1>the new virgin planet by taking some </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible poison that breaks them down </v>

2614
01:55:50.731 --> 01:55:53.820
<v Speaker 1>and he dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>falls into the water and then slowly but</v>

2615
01:55:53.821 --> 01:55:57.900
<v Speaker 1>surely a natural course of evolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>grows out of his dna.</v>

2616
01:55:57.901 --> 01:56:00.600
<v Speaker 1>And that's how people are created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating to me.</v>

2617
01:56:00.780 --> 01:56:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2618
01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:03.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ain't never seen no shit like that.</v>

2619
01:56:03.230 --> 01:56:04.830
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I entertained it,</v>

2620
01:56:04.831 --> 01:56:05.910
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2621
01:56:05.911 --> 01:56:10.911
<v Speaker 1>I think that ridley scott is brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think he's probably been thinking </v>

2622
01:56:10.911 --> 01:56:13.090
<v Speaker 1>about this for a long time before he </v>
<v Speaker 1>created this and I don't know who,</v>

2623
01:56:13.170 --> 01:56:18.170
<v Speaker 1>who wrote the screenplay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would imagine all of them have </v>

2624
01:56:18.170 --> 01:56:18.170
<v Speaker 1>been thinking about this for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2625
01:56:18.170 --> 01:56:22.851
<v Speaker 1>Like if you were goiNg to like the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to introduce life into another </v>

2626
01:56:22.851 --> 01:56:23.490
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like just get a planet,</v>

2627
01:56:23.530 --> 01:56:27.600
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have any life and you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>inject some something,</v>

2628
01:56:27.650 --> 01:56:32.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some d and if it's a body especially </v>

2629
01:56:32.650 --> 01:56:35.571
<v Speaker 1>that breaks down that bodies also got </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of bacteria and weird shit on </v>

2630
01:56:35.571 --> 01:56:39.771
<v Speaker 1>it and that's going to come out when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>dies and the bacteria starts eating his </v>

2631
01:56:39.771 --> 01:56:40.720
<v Speaker 1>flesh and will they be able to transmit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2632
01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:45.800
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and go to plants or other plant matter </v>

2633
01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:45.800
<v Speaker 1>that's on this planet.</v>

2634
01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Is there some primitive life that it can</v>
<v Speaker 1>cling to?</v>

2635
01:56:47.581 --> 01:56:50.070
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more with some sort of a virus.</v>

2636
01:56:50.330 --> 01:56:52.920
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like diseases change people,</v>

2637
01:56:53.190 --> 01:56:58.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases can probably change all sorts </v>

2638
01:56:58.190 --> 01:57:00.291
<v Speaker 1>of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Viruses and bacteria slowly mutate and </v>

2639
01:57:00.291 --> 01:57:02.120
<v Speaker 1>morph out of this one body that comes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean how much,</v>

2640
01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:07.220
<v Speaker 1>how far can a body go for body rotted if</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a planet and that planet had </v>

2641
01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:12.630
<v Speaker 1>no biological life and he brought a body</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he just threw it there.</v>

2642
01:57:13.770 --> 01:57:18.770
<v Speaker 1>All it has plant life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible that that could somehow </v>

2643
01:57:18.770 --> 01:57:22.461
<v Speaker 1>or another have enough fuel from eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>that body and figuring out how to </v>

2644
01:57:22.461 --> 01:57:26.570
<v Speaker 1>subside off plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would figure out some sort of </v>

2645
01:57:26.570 --> 01:57:29.721
<v Speaker 1>a way to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to become a viable life form on a </v>

2646
01:57:29.721 --> 01:57:32.941
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that outside of the realm of </v>

2647
01:57:32.941 --> 01:57:33.600
<v Speaker 1>possibility that stoner talk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it.</v>

2648
01:57:33.860 --> 01:57:34.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2649
01:57:34.830 --> 01:57:35.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2650
01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:38.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean how is the biggest too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's too crazy even.</v>

2651
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:45.000
<v Speaker 1>And then if some other dude landed on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that same planet and then got sick from </v>

2652
01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:48.780
<v Speaker 1>this bacteria that was created by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>body that was left behind before then he</v>

2653
01:57:48.781 --> 01:57:53.781
<v Speaker 1>takes it back to his plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gets fucked up and they all </v>

2654
01:57:53.781 --> 01:57:56.271
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the planet where the bacteria </v>

2655
01:57:56.271 --> 01:57:56.790
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bacteria is figured out how to form</v>

2656
01:57:56.791 --> 01:58:01.290
<v Speaker 1>a civilization and as wifi and they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>spread out and become.</v>

2657
01:58:01.291 --> 01:58:04.440
<v Speaker 1>People call themselves humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2658
01:58:04.441 --> 01:58:09.441
<v Speaker 1>If you get too high you can think some </v>
<v Speaker 1>really stupid shit and you can talk </v>

2659
01:58:09.441 --> 01:58:09.441
<v Speaker 1>about it on a podcast like I just did.</v>

2660
01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:14.460
<v Speaker 1>But everybody's fascinated by that </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject of aliens.</v>

2661
01:58:14.461 --> 01:58:19.461
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of aliens creating people like </v>

2662
01:58:19.461 --> 01:58:22.341
<v Speaker 1>a movie like prometheus's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I mean Like it's entertaining </v>

2663
01:58:22.501 --> 01:58:25.320
<v Speaker 1>that kind of play with that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2664
01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:27.090
<v Speaker 1>for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2665
01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:29.580
<v Speaker 1>It's entertaining to think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's gonna come visit to.</v>

2666
01:58:30.050 --> 01:58:32.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean everybody loves aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2667
01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:35.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean even given except predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you live in an.</v>

2668
01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:40.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't fuck With aliens at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you lived on an island somewhere and </v>

2669
01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:43.120
<v Speaker 1>you're by yourself just there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just you sitting around.</v>

2670
01:58:43.121 --> 01:58:45.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you've got a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sit on this island,</v>

2671
01:58:45.590 --> 01:58:47.190
<v Speaker 1>you got plenty of food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your board is fuck.</v>

2672
01:58:47.191 --> 01:58:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Just looking at waiting for someone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come.</v>

2673
01:58:49.660 --> 01:58:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone just let me see a light.</v>

2674
01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's kind of what's going on </v>

2675
01:58:57.360 --> 01:58:57.360
<v Speaker 1>with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2676
01:58:57.360 --> 01:58:58.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have each other,</v>

2677
01:58:58.810 --> 01:59:03.810
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is we're on some weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>round boat that's bobbing around in the </v>

2678
01:59:04.031 --> 01:59:06.340
<v Speaker 1>universe and we want someone to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>visit us.</v>

2679
01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:08.230
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like us are like,</v>

2680
01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:10.450
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of these people suck.</v>

2681
01:59:11.890 --> 01:59:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Can y'all come down here and fuck with </v>
<v Speaker 1>us?</v>

2682
01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Come take us where you teach us your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>

2683
01:59:19.220 --> 01:59:21.070
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people don't suck.</v>

2684
01:59:21.071 --> 01:59:26.071
<v Speaker 1>RIght?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the real thing is figuring out </v>

2685
01:59:26.071 --> 01:59:28.351
<v Speaker 1>how to make less people suck and </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how to way to accept to </v>

2686
01:59:29.831 --> 01:59:31.680
<v Speaker 1>accept people for things they've done </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong to.</v>

2687
01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:34.600
<v Speaker 1>I just think is love man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lot more love.</v>

2688
01:59:34.630 --> 01:59:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Do you need that in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it ways to do it without it being </v>

2689
01:59:39.630 --> 01:59:39.670
<v Speaker 1>signed and so silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2690
01:59:39.850 --> 01:59:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just something that people need to </v>

2691
01:59:44.850 --> 01:59:44.850
<v Speaker 1>do internally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2692
01:59:44.850 --> 01:59:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like an easy thing to say,</v>

2693
01:59:46.991 --> 01:59:48.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you need is love.</v>

2694
01:59:48.490 --> 01:59:52.780
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what it's like to be hopeful is</v>

2695
01:59:52.781 --> 01:59:53.640
<v Speaker 1>a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2696
01:59:54.660 --> 01:59:56.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a super valuable to everything.</v>

2697
01:59:56.950 --> 02:00:01.950
<v Speaker 1>If you're not hopeful you got nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't mean just your attitude </v>

2698
02:00:01.950 --> 02:00:04.990
<v Speaker 1>determines your success in a lot of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>endeavors in life,</v>

2699
02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:06.880
<v Speaker 1>your attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your approach that you take to it.</v>

2700
02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:09.160
<v Speaker 1>It's whether or not sam harris fucked me</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

2701
02:00:09.161 --> 02:00:09.970
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this dude,</v>

2702
02:00:09.971 --> 02:00:14.971
<v Speaker 1>sam harris on the podcast and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about determinism and it's the </v>

2703
02:00:14.971 --> 02:00:19.921
<v Speaker 1>idea that no one has free will and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically everything about your </v>

2704
02:00:19.921 --> 02:00:21.400
<v Speaker 1>personality been formed by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions with your life experiences,</v>

2705
02:00:21.401 --> 02:00:22.840
<v Speaker 1>your dna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your genetics,</v>

2706
02:00:22.841 --> 02:00:27.580
<v Speaker 1>your neighborhood that you grew up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that that's just no matter what,</v>

2707
02:00:27.581 --> 02:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an inescapable and that there is no free</v>

2708
02:00:30.631 --> 02:00:32.680
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like every decision you make is based on</v>

2709
02:00:32.681 --> 02:00:34.360
<v Speaker 1>all the shit that's happening to fate is</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fate.</v>

2710
02:00:34.980 --> 02:00:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even that you in your destiny.</v>

2711
02:00:36.461 --> 02:00:41.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's sort of been determined by </v>
<v Speaker 1>your past experiences and the chemical </v>

2712
02:00:41.501 --> 02:00:46.501
<v Speaker 1>interactions with those past experiences</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you're on a path and that path </v>

2713
02:00:46.501 --> 02:00:47.170
<v Speaker 1>is like almost undeniable.</v>

2714
02:00:47.490 --> 02:00:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Which is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird sort of a semantic argument</v>

2715
02:00:51.011 --> 02:00:56.011
<v Speaker 1>to its because man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on when you decide did not </v>

2716
02:00:56.011 --> 02:00:56.560
<v Speaker 1>do coke anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

2717
02:00:56.620 --> 02:00:57.760
<v Speaker 1>When you decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

2718
02:00:57.761 --> 02:00:59.560
<v Speaker 1>that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not smoking anymore,</v>

2719
02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:00.760
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is going on?</v>

2720
02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Because part of me wants to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2721
02:01:03.130 --> 02:01:08.130
<v Speaker 1>scott did some powerful shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stepped up and he uses willpower and </v>

2722
02:01:08.681 --> 02:01:13.681
<v Speaker 1>he uses intelligence to realize that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was on a bad path and that's an </v>

2723
02:01:13.681 --> 02:01:16.860
<v Speaker 1>admirable thing to talk about because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspires people who might be on a bad </v>

2724
02:01:16.860 --> 02:01:19.540
<v Speaker 1>path themselves to kind of like catch </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2725
02:01:19.570 --> 02:01:24.570
<v Speaker 1>your momentum and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and give them confidence and it gives </v>

2726
02:01:24.570 --> 02:01:26.050
<v Speaker 1>them confidence hearing you today with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your shit together.</v>

2727
02:01:26.051 --> 02:01:28.510
<v Speaker 1>All cool as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And think about you being,</v>

2728
02:01:28.530 --> 02:01:30.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy who was doing coke all the time</v>

2729
02:01:30.251 --> 02:01:32.280
<v Speaker 1>and didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's um,</v>

2730
02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:36.010
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's gotta be something </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that made you do that.</v>

2731
02:01:36.070 --> 02:01:38.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea of pure determinism is really.</v>

2732
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:42.170
<v Speaker 3>And I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally get it.</v>

2733
02:01:42.770 --> 02:01:47.770
<v Speaker 3>I just wonder how much of a personal </v>
<v Speaker 3>choice is just what it,</v>

2734
02:01:48.290 --> 02:01:52.610
<v Speaker 3>what is the force that makes a person </v>
<v Speaker 3>decide to do the right thing?</v>

2735
02:01:53.450 --> 02:01:58.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it goes back to what we were </v>

2736
02:01:58.450 --> 02:02:02.261
<v Speaker 3>talking about before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you kind of start from one place </v>

2737
02:02:02.261 --> 02:02:03.800
<v Speaker 3>where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta make your own way,</v>

2738
02:02:04.340 --> 02:02:06.250
<v Speaker 3>it just kind of makes it a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2739
02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:12.720
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you savor it a little bit more and it </v>

2740
02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:12.720
<v Speaker 3>means more when you get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2741
02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:14.570
<v Speaker 3>because you had to really work in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheap something,</v>

2742
02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:17.900
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my whole thing is when I was a kid,</v>

2743
02:02:19.250 --> 02:02:24.250
<v Speaker 3>I was immediately looked at as someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>who wasn't gonna amount to shit.</v>

2744
02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:27.610
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2745
02:02:29.110 --> 02:02:32.750
<v Speaker 3>they started talking about starting from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bottom.</v>

2746
02:02:32.751 --> 02:02:37.751
<v Speaker 3>That's the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When motherfuckers look at you as a </v>

2747
02:02:37.751 --> 02:02:37.751
<v Speaker 3>human being and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh he,</v>

2748
02:02:37.751 --> 02:02:37.751
<v Speaker 3>he's not going to amount to anything.</v>

2749
02:02:37.751 --> 02:02:38.540
<v Speaker 3>But they know that's what teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2750
02:02:38.541 --> 02:02:39.620
<v Speaker 3>that's what your peers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2751
02:02:39.621 --> 02:02:42.020
<v Speaker 3>that's what certain people in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood may think of you,</v>

2752
02:02:42.500 --> 02:02:43.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of whatever,</v>

2753
02:02:43.730 --> 02:02:45.170
<v Speaker 3>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2754
02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:49.670
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying off just you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just being in a certain environment,</v>

2755
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:53.270
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you already had that against you,</v>

2756
02:02:54.110 --> 02:02:55.010
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you,</v>

2757
02:02:55.610 --> 02:02:58.850
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to conform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be a statistic,</v>

2758
02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:04.600
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's kind of like what my thing </v>

2759
02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:04.600
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2760
02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:07.510
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't want to be another nigga </v>
<v Speaker 3>out here last and shit and do you know </v>

2761
02:03:07.510 --> 02:03:07.510
<v Speaker 3>what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2762
02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:08.420
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was,</v>

2763
02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:13.250
<v Speaker 3>that was what I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made that choice at that time,</v>

2764
02:03:13.490 --> 02:03:13.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2765
02:03:13.991 --> 02:03:18.991
<v Speaker 3>and I knew that me making that choice </v>
<v Speaker 3>will help other people see that they can</v>

2766
02:03:19.401 --> 02:03:21.890
<v Speaker 3>make the choice because I was also </v>
<v Speaker 3>inspired by,</v>

2767
02:03:21.950 --> 02:03:26.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people that were in my space that </v>

2768
02:03:26.950 --> 02:03:26.950
<v Speaker 3>weren't falling into other shit.</v>

2769
02:03:26.950 --> 02:03:28.040
<v Speaker 3>It might've been like one of my homies </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was like,</v>

2770
02:03:28.970 --> 02:03:31.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the sports and like,</v>

2771
02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:36.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get good grades and play sports and </v>

2772
02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:36.920
<v Speaker 3>wasn't caught up in some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2773
02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:37.430
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this dude got some goals here.</v>

2774
02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:43.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might not be in the sports but this </v>

2775
02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:44.450
<v Speaker 3>dude right here has some type of goal </v>
<v Speaker 3>cause he don't want to turn up like this</v>

2776
02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:46.780
<v Speaker 3>because we got that option too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2777
02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:47.840
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

2778
02:03:48.110 --> 02:03:49.530
<v Speaker 3>it was just a lot of things I was able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

2779
02:03:50.110 --> 02:03:52.220
<v Speaker 3>Then I was the youngest of four.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2780
02:03:52.221 --> 02:03:57.221
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was able to just kind of be young and </v>

2781
02:03:57.221 --> 02:03:59.861
<v Speaker 3>look at my older siblings and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>learn what not to do and that's kind of </v>

2782
02:04:00.351 --> 02:04:05.351
<v Speaker 3>why they use that whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm your big brother phrase in my </v>

2783
02:04:05.351 --> 02:04:05.780
<v Speaker 3>music because I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2784
02:04:05.781 --> 02:04:10.781
<v Speaker 3>even when mistakes I've made that big </v>
<v Speaker 3>brother is supposed to do like I'm </v>

2785
02:04:10.781 --> 02:04:12.380
<v Speaker 3>supposed to to make some mistakes so you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can learn,</v>

2786
02:04:12.470 --> 02:04:17.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then those kids will learn and then </v>

2787
02:04:17.470 --> 02:04:19.111
<v Speaker 3>they'll make their own mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there'll be a bunch of other kids </v>

2788
02:04:19.111 --> 02:04:19.111
<v Speaker 3>that are learn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2789
02:04:19.111 --> 02:04:19.510
<v Speaker 3>it's like a system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know it.</v>

2790
02:04:19.930 --> 02:04:21.890
<v Speaker 3>And I kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2791
02:04:21.891 --> 02:04:23.930
<v Speaker 3>I liked that I'm that person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2792
02:04:23.931 --> 02:04:26.720
<v Speaker 3>I like to take that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that whole big brother thing too,</v>

2793
02:04:26.721 --> 02:04:27.410
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2794
02:04:27.411 --> 02:04:32.411
<v Speaker 3>to the full extent into the music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I really believed that I had the </v>

2795
02:04:32.411 --> 02:04:36.731
<v Speaker 3>odds against me in such a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I also just felt like everybody </v>

2796
02:04:36.891 --> 02:04:38.220
<v Speaker 3>thought I was a loser from</v>

2797
02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:42.090
<v Speaker 4>day one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was tired of feeling like that.</v>

2798
02:04:42.091 --> 02:04:43.920
<v Speaker 4>I was tired of people looking at me in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that way.</v>

2799
02:04:43.921 --> 02:04:48.480
<v Speaker 4>And I want it to finally find whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>it was that was my own,</v>

2800
02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:50.520
<v Speaker 4>my calling to prove that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2801
02:04:50.550 --> 02:04:53.850
<v Speaker 4>because I tried everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that in some ways,</v>

2802
02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:58.880
<v Speaker 4>like coming from a troubled background </v>
<v Speaker 4>is like almost a gift because it gives </v>

2803
02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:01.620
<v Speaker 4>you that burning fire or do you think </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a double edge sword because it</v>

2804
02:05:01.621 --> 02:05:06.621
<v Speaker 4>gives you that gift,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it also gives you like this whole </v>

2805
02:05:06.621 --> 02:05:06.930
<v Speaker 4>that sometimes is difficult to keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>filled.</v>

2806
02:05:07.770 --> 02:05:09.270
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you know what I'm saying?</v>

2807
02:05:09.271 --> 02:05:10.470
<v Speaker 4>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're saying.</v>

2808
02:05:10.471 --> 02:05:13.350
<v Speaker 4>But it's hard to say because everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 4>circumstance is different.</v>

2809
02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:14.640
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2810
02:05:14.641 --> 02:05:18.260
<v Speaker 4>it could be somebody who came from money</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's still got the same like,</v>

2811
02:05:18.930 --> 02:05:23.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dna and teachings that my mom gave me </v>

2812
02:05:23.930 --> 02:05:24.300
<v Speaker 4>because they just have really good </v>
<v Speaker 4>parents except they came from money,</v>

2813
02:05:24.690 --> 02:05:25.860
<v Speaker 4>like it don't really matter.</v>

2814
02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:30.860
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it could still be drugs in the </v>

2815
02:05:30.860 --> 02:05:33.471
<v Speaker 4>suburbs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Niggas still be all these things that </v>

2816
02:05:33.471 --> 02:05:33.471
<v Speaker 4>one can get caught up in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the suburbs,</v>

2817
02:05:33.471 --> 02:05:34.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anywhere else.</v>

2818
02:05:34.650 --> 02:05:35.770
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2819
02:05:35.970 --> 02:05:37.140

<v Speaker 4>because know I was raised,</v>

2823
02:05:46.770 --> 02:05:51.770
<v Speaker 4>when I think of strength,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think of a woman I was raised by my </v>

2824
02:05:51.770 --> 02:05:51.770
<v Speaker 4>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2829
02:06:04.041 --> 02:06:08.060
<v Speaker 4>role model.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like somebody who like could have just </v>

<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it can,</v>

2852
02:06:53.130 --> 02:06:56.100
<v Speaker 4>it can help you in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can certainly help you,</v>

2853
02:06:56.370 --> 02:06:59.610
<v Speaker 4>but I think sometimes even like when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about the benefits,</v>

2854
02:06:59.611 --> 02:07:02.090
<v Speaker 4>you had a cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's benefits to it.</v>

2855
02:07:02.130 --> 02:07:07.130
<v Speaker 4>It's like you could say things and do </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that ordinarily wouldn't be able </v>

2856
02:07:07.130 --> 02:07:07.130
<v Speaker 4>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2857
02:07:07.130 --> 02:07:09.960
<v Speaker 4>this the motivation of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of like proving people wrong.</v>

2858
02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:11.640
<v Speaker 4>I'll show you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2859
02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:13.400
<v Speaker 4>you said I wasn't gonna be shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll show you.</v>

2860
02:07:13.700 --> 02:07:18.700
<v Speaker 4>Like you get to a certain point in time </v>
<v Speaker 4>that could kind of play against you to </v>

2861
02:07:18.700 --> 02:07:18.700
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2862
02:07:18.700 --> 02:07:21.240
<v Speaker 4>It could backfire because then it </v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes it for me,</v>

2863
02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:27.180
<v Speaker 4>it becomes like an.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I definitely did my last album.</v>

2864
02:07:27.181 --> 02:07:32.181
<v Speaker 4>I did my arm before last with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an angry I'll show you,</v>

2865
02:07:32.260 --> 02:07:35.250
<v Speaker 4>like full,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like villainous energy,</v>

2866
02:07:35.650 --> 02:07:38.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was able to make some really great</v>

2867
02:07:38.111 --> 02:07:40.790
<v Speaker 4>records,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was the most aggressive music I'd</v>

2868
02:07:40.810 --> 02:07:45.810
<v Speaker 4>ever made and some of it was the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>aggressive and a lot of levels,</v>

2869
02:07:45.911 --> 02:07:47.660
<v Speaker 4>not even in the meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just like,</v>

2870
02:07:47.690 --> 02:07:51.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the music itself and that benefited</v>

2871
02:07:51.670 --> 02:07:52.350
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2872
02:07:52.720 --> 02:07:54.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I set out to do,</v>

2873
02:07:55.690 --> 02:07:57.040
<v Speaker 4>it all benefited,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2874
02:07:57.040 --> 02:07:59.410
<v Speaker 4>BuT um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>

2875
02:07:59.470 --> 02:08:04.000
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't the normal way I went about </v>
<v Speaker 4>making an album so it was weird,</v>

2876
02:08:04.030 --> 02:08:04.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2877
02:08:04.651 --> 02:08:09.651
<v Speaker 4>and it was something that I took a step </v>
<v Speaker 4>back with afterwards and then drop the </v>

2878
02:08:09.651 --> 02:08:09.651
<v Speaker 4>second album was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

2879
02:08:09.651 --> 02:08:10.600
<v Speaker 4>this one's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So um,</v>

2880
02:08:10.750 --> 02:08:13.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't really feel like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like going,</v>

2881
02:08:13.990 --> 02:08:15.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>up against the masters,</v>

2882
02:08:15.330 --> 02:08:16.900
<v Speaker 4>like I really have something to prove </v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

2883
02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:22.090
<v Speaker 4>This is more just like about like just </v>
<v Speaker 4>being at some type of peace,</v>

2884
02:08:22.270 --> 02:08:27.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just having things sorted out once </v>

2885
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.270
<v Speaker 4>all the madness is all done and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>kinda dislike.</v>

2886
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:28.320
<v Speaker 4>Now it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2887
02:08:28.630 --> 02:08:29.460
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2888
02:08:29.470 --> 02:08:34.470
<v Speaker 4>and that's why I did indicat another </v>
<v Speaker 4>satellite flight because I feel like in </v>

2889
02:08:34.470 --> 02:08:36.070
<v Speaker 4>the cup was me just figuring out how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>produce,</v>

2890
02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:41.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and make records and then satellite </v>

2891
02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:43.351
<v Speaker 4>fight was me having it mastered and </v>
<v Speaker 4>finally putting together something that </v>

2892
02:08:43.351 --> 02:08:44.450
<v Speaker 4>was just like fine tuned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2893
02:08:44.890 --> 02:08:49.890
<v Speaker 4>but to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a different structure where I have </v>

2894
02:08:49.890 --> 02:08:49.890
<v Speaker 4>like some instrumentals and then you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2895
02:08:49.890 --> 02:08:54.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the kind of like interludes and then </v>

2896
02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:56.860
<v Speaker 4>records that just completely formatted </v>
<v Speaker 4>in different ways.</v>

2897
02:08:57.370 --> 02:09:00.640
<v Speaker 4>Maybe not the three verse two hook </v>
<v Speaker 4>formula,</v>

2898
02:09:00.690 --> 02:09:03.730
<v Speaker 4>maybe just one long verse in one outro </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

2899
02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:08.760
<v Speaker 4>maybe know who get all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe no drums for the first minute and </v>

2900
02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:08.760
<v Speaker 4>30 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's like wraps,</v>

2901
02:09:09.010 --> 02:09:11.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just experiment and then try and things,</v>

2902
02:09:11.471 --> 02:09:13.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not that I had that expertise.</v>

2903
02:09:13.511 --> 02:09:14.770
<v Speaker 4>We're creating a record,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2904
02:09:15.100 --> 02:09:16.180
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2905
02:09:16.210 --> 02:09:20.710
<v Speaker 4>listened to the brand new heavies?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know some records here,</v>

2906
02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:24.130
<v Speaker 4>the brand new heavies did this rap thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>where there,</v>

2907
02:09:24.230 --> 02:09:26.080
<v Speaker 4>god was trying to remember the name of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2908
02:09:26.620 --> 02:09:27.640
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

2909
02:09:27.970 --> 02:09:31.450
<v Speaker 4>but it was along those lines like very </v>
<v Speaker 4>experimental.</v>

2910
02:09:31.451 --> 02:09:33.550
<v Speaker 4>And this is like back in the early </v>
<v Speaker 4>nineties,</v>

2911
02:09:33.970 --> 02:09:38.970
<v Speaker 4>they did like kool g rap did one of them</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it did it like some like actual </v>

2912
02:09:40.481 --> 02:09:44.140
<v Speaker 4>music behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty interesting stuff.</v>

2913
02:09:44.410 --> 02:09:46.090
<v Speaker 4>But I remember that and I remember </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking like,</v>

2914
02:09:46.091 --> 02:09:49.510
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like why don't more people do weird shit</v>

2915
02:09:49.511 --> 02:09:50.110
<v Speaker 4>with music.</v>

2916
02:09:50.110 --> 02:09:52.600
<v Speaker 4>Like how many people are thinking the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way you're thinking?</v>

2917
02:09:52.601 --> 02:09:53.680
<v Speaker 4>Like saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2918
02:09:53.681 --> 02:09:58.681
<v Speaker 4>how about we just do no drums for like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the first minute and a half and then </v>

2919
02:09:58.681 --> 02:09:59.930
<v Speaker 4>just start rapping and then the drums </v>
<v Speaker 4>kick it.</v>

2920
02:09:59.940 --> 02:10:02.760
<v Speaker 4>Like these kinds of things where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just like coming up with a,</v>

2921
02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:06.010
<v Speaker 4>like just a different approach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Slightly different entry.</v>

2922
02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:11.160
<v Speaker 4>I think people are just a little scared </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they'll lose the audience's </v>

2923
02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:14.050
<v Speaker 4>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the very real fear.</v>

2924
02:10:14.051 --> 02:10:14.980
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it,</v>

2925
02:10:15.610 --> 02:10:18.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it also goes back to what I was saying,</v>

2926
02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:20.460
<v Speaker 4>I've just been blessed with a family </v>
<v Speaker 4>that like,</v>

2927
02:10:20.990 --> 02:10:23.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's into what I'm doing no matter what,</v>

2928
02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:24.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2929
02:10:24.940 --> 02:10:27.100
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just dope,</v>

2930
02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:28.390
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the average artist,</v>

2931
02:10:28.391 --> 02:10:29.950
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>theY can't just experiment.</v>

2932
02:10:29.951 --> 02:10:32.110
<v Speaker 4>And this fear where they might not sell </v>
<v Speaker 4>records.</v>

2933
02:10:32.111 --> 02:10:34.340
<v Speaker 4>And then that's bad for business and </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a business,</v>

2934
02:10:34.940 --> 02:10:35.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2935
02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:37.190
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2936
02:10:37.290 --> 02:10:38.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2937
02:10:38.990 --> 02:10:41.270
<v Speaker 3>it's understood why most guys don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really do it,</v>

2938
02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:43.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to see people do it.</v>

2939
02:10:43.071 --> 02:10:45.020
<v Speaker 3>I feel like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not an excuse.</v>

2940
02:10:45.021 --> 02:10:50.021
<v Speaker 3>I feel like there's a way where people </v>
<v Speaker 3>can be a little bit more creative and </v>

2941
02:10:50.021 --> 02:10:50.870
<v Speaker 3>push the envelope a lot more with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>music,</v>

2942
02:10:51.150 --> 02:10:52.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it fits in,</v>

2943
02:10:52.681 --> 02:10:53.430
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

2944
02:10:53.490 --> 02:10:56.360
<v Speaker 3>in a way that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's true to their,</v>

2945
02:10:56.400 --> 02:10:58.170
<v Speaker 3>their art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2946
02:10:58.700 --> 02:11:00.440
<v Speaker 3>in their formula.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>

2947
02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:05.480
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always a way to try something </v>

2948
02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:07.010
<v Speaker 3>new and be innovative and bring </v>
<v Speaker 3>something different to the table</v>

2949
02:11:07.060 --> 02:11:12.060
<v Speaker 1>if anybody wants to check out that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That brand new heavies that I was </v>

2950
02:11:12.060 --> 02:11:12.580
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called heavy rhyme experience.</v>

2951
02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was the brand new heavies.</v>

2952
02:11:15.041 --> 02:11:17.980
<v Speaker 1>It was 92 way back in the day when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

2953
02:11:18.070 --> 02:11:22.170
<v Speaker 1>I was living in New York and my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goddammit,</v>

2954
02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:23.980

<v Speaker 1>comedian told me about them.</v>

2956
02:11:25.391 --> 02:11:27.460
<v Speaker 1>you gotta listen to this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys are doing some weird stuff.</v>

2957
02:11:28.090 --> 02:11:31.860
<v Speaker 1>They did a duel with kool g rap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did a,</v>

2958
02:11:31.870 --> 02:11:36.490
<v Speaker 1>one of them with a gang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Starr was pretty bad ass that,</v>

2959
02:11:36.491 --> 02:11:40.570
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of different collaborations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like jazz singers was like,</v>

2960
02:11:40.571 --> 02:11:41.830
<v Speaker 1>rap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like serious,</v>

2961
02:11:42.100 --> 02:11:46.660
<v Speaker 1>like best of the class back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hardcore rappers rapping over their,</v>

2962
02:11:46.661 --> 02:11:48.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ride or their music.</v>

2963
02:11:48.221 --> 02:11:49.240
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My law.</v>

2964
02:11:49.970 --> 02:11:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your point about having the fan base</v>

2965
02:11:54.101 --> 02:11:57.190
<v Speaker 1>that allows you to fuck around and </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice and take chances.</v>

2966
02:11:57.430 --> 02:11:58.630
<v Speaker 1>That is huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

2967
02:11:58.631 --> 02:12:01.470
<v Speaker 1>Like this ability that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2968
02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:05.490
<v Speaker 1>they like you as a person as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>like your music so that.</v>

2969
02:12:05.491 --> 02:12:07.180
<v Speaker 1>And they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to see where you go with it.</v>

2970
02:12:07.540 --> 02:12:08.800
<v Speaker 1>You're always going to do your best.</v>

2971
02:12:09.250 --> 02:12:11.130
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes from a pure place to know.</v>

2972
02:12:11.150 --> 02:12:14.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know me as the top table,</v>

2973
02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:19.920
<v Speaker 3>say no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to make some cool shit </v>

2974
02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:21.661
<v Speaker 3>that they can connect with and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the extent every time it doesn't go </v>

2975
02:12:21.661 --> 02:12:23.310
<v Speaker 3>beyond that and the minute it tries to </v>
<v Speaker 3>just starts to get frustrating,</v>

2976
02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:26.440
<v Speaker 3>like start thinking about a radio record</v>
<v Speaker 3>to please somebody at the label.</v>

2977
02:12:26.441 --> 02:12:31.441
<v Speaker 3>Then it gets frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I started thinking about this and </v>

2978
02:12:31.441 --> 02:12:33.601
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this and it gets frustrating if I keep </v>

2979
02:12:33.601 --> 02:12:33.601
<v Speaker 3>it just based on like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amen,</v>

2980
02:12:33.601 --> 02:12:37.980
<v Speaker 3>this sounds gnarly and let's make sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>we not too trippy and it's make sure </v>

2981
02:12:37.991 --> 02:12:40.450
<v Speaker 3>it's not to this and not do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

2982
02:12:40.900 --> 02:12:43.900
<v Speaker 3>effortless combination of everything all</v>
<v Speaker 3>at once,</v>

2983
02:12:44.230 --> 02:12:44.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2984
02:12:44.900 --> 02:12:48.700
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's really what these past couple</v>

2985
02:12:48.700 --> 02:12:53.700
<v Speaker 3>of years for me have been like just </v>
<v Speaker 3>mastering that technique is a producer </v>

2986
02:12:54.460 --> 02:12:56.460
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2987
02:12:57.190 --> 02:13:01.120
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really just going all out creatively and</v>

2988
02:13:01.121 --> 02:13:06.121
<v Speaker 3>just trying new things because I also </v>
<v Speaker 3>internally don't feel like I have </v>

2989
02:13:06.121 --> 02:13:07.530
<v Speaker 3>anything else to prove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2990
02:13:07.870 --> 02:13:08.740
<v Speaker 3>as a musician.</v>

2991
02:13:08.890 --> 02:13:12.520
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have that itch,</v>

2992
02:13:12.700 --> 02:13:14.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I need to create.</v>

2993
02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:18.080
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that's like working out for </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2994
02:13:18.490 --> 02:13:22.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like doing reps and stand mentally </v>
<v Speaker 3>fit,</v>

2995
02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:23.930
<v Speaker 3>creatively fit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2996
02:13:23.931 --> 02:13:26.650
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when it comes time to do an album,</v>

2997
02:13:26.710 --> 02:13:29.860
<v Speaker 3>I got some new powers I've acquired in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the past year,</v>

2998
02:13:29.861 --> 02:13:30.580
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2999
02:13:30.581 --> 02:13:34.550
<v Speaker 3>from just dicking around in the studio </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a couple of months is going everyday</v>

3000
02:13:34.630 --> 02:13:37.080
<v Speaker 3>making beats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether I'm in the studio for five hours</v>

3001
02:13:37.081 --> 02:13:39.540
<v Speaker 3>or two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm making something I'm making at least</v>

3002
02:13:39.541 --> 02:13:44.400
<v Speaker 3>like on average I make about in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>studio,</v>

3003
02:13:44.401 --> 02:13:47.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm making at least two to four beat </v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

3004
02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:50.550
<v Speaker 3>And when I say beats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about completed,</v>

3005
02:13:51.370 --> 02:13:56.370
<v Speaker 3>sequenced instrumentals that I could </v>
<v Speaker 3>make records are so,</v>

3006
02:13:56.551 --> 02:14:01.551
<v Speaker 3>like not just some sit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started a little bit and then it's </v>

3007
02:14:01.551 --> 02:14:01.551
<v Speaker 3>kind of cool and I'll get back to it </v>
<v Speaker 3>later.</v>

3008
02:14:01.551 --> 02:14:03.870
<v Speaker 3>I have probably like a baker's dozen of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those in one session,</v>

3009
02:14:04.350 --> 02:14:06.600
<v Speaker 3>but I'll have like four that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>officially.</v>

3010
02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:10.020
<v Speaker 3>Like all these jams are dope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to sit and live with these and</v>

3011
02:14:10.021 --> 02:14:13.320
<v Speaker 3>see what comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you sit down to write music,</v>

3012
02:14:13.350 --> 02:14:18.350
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you sit down and do you have an idea </v>

3013
02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:18.350
<v Speaker 3>in your head or do you just let it come </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you while you're there?</v>

3014
02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:20.590
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you know how to start?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3015
02:14:21.670 --> 02:14:24.710
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it comes different every time.</v>

3016
02:14:24.770 --> 02:14:25.780
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3017
02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:31.520
<v Speaker 3>it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can be a baseline that I'm thinking </v>

3018
02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:34.641
<v Speaker 3>of that inspires me or it could be me </v>
<v Speaker 3>not have anything in my mind.</v>

3019
02:14:34.981 --> 02:14:39.240
<v Speaker 3>And just going through the sounds a or </v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be like,</v>

3020
02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:43.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a rhythm I heard or you know,</v>

3021
02:14:43.081 --> 02:14:45.180
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be a movie I'm watching,</v>

3022
02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:46.210
<v Speaker 3>I like to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3023
02:14:46.300 --> 02:14:48.630
<v Speaker 3>produce while I'm watching movies with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sound off,</v>

3024
02:14:49.310 --> 02:14:50.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

3025
02:14:50.641 --> 02:14:52.560
<v Speaker 3>that kind of helps me with scoring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3026
02:14:52.561 --> 02:14:54.220
<v Speaker 3>when I get into the scoring and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3027
02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:56.040
<v Speaker 3>doing that as my next step.</v>

3028
02:14:56.210 --> 02:14:59.910
<v Speaker 3>I want to get more into scoring movies </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sound design.</v>

3029
02:15:00.440 --> 02:15:02.550
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's all,</v>

3030
02:15:02.580 --> 02:15:07.580
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all just experimentation and just </v>

3031
02:15:07.580 --> 02:15:09.300
<v Speaker 3>seeing what happens and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not any pressure.</v>

3032
02:15:09.390 --> 02:15:14.390
<v Speaker 3>And when you hear a beat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you're making a beat and </v>

3033
02:15:14.390 --> 02:15:14.390
<v Speaker 3>you're creating it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hearing lyrics.</v>

3034
02:15:14.390 --> 02:15:15.740
<v Speaker 3>Are you hearing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3035
02:15:16.010 --> 02:15:19.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean here's,</v>

3036
02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:21.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>

3037
02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:24.690
<v Speaker 3>when I'm hearing something I hear a </v>
<v Speaker 3>completed right?</v>

3038
02:15:25.530 --> 02:15:30.530
<v Speaker 3>So when I'm starting to record and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like I got some of my or I saw </v>

3039
02:15:30.530 --> 02:15:33.490
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like in this back to what you </v>

3040
02:15:33.490 --> 02:15:33.490
<v Speaker 3>were talking about because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>

3041
02:15:33.490 --> 02:15:34.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>time doesn't really exist.</v>

3042
02:15:34.111 --> 02:15:37.650
<v Speaker 3>So an hour from now it's happening right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

3043
02:15:37.710 --> 02:15:40.470
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's songs that are created that I</v>

3044
02:15:40.471 --> 02:15:45.471
<v Speaker 3>haven't made yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when I'm in the studio I feel like I </v>

3045
02:15:45.471 --> 02:15:48.531
<v Speaker 3>have this small like peek into this </v>
<v Speaker 3>other world and this window that I can </v>

3046
02:15:48.661 --> 02:15:53.661
<v Speaker 3>hear the song,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's my job in the present to find </v>

3047
02:15:53.661 --> 02:15:55.120
<v Speaker 3>the pieces to make it so.</v>

3048
02:15:55.560 --> 02:16:00.560
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes it might come out exactly </v>
<v Speaker 3>like what I'm hearing and sometimes it </v>

3049
02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:00.720
<v Speaker 3>might not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's never,</v>

3050
02:16:00.890 --> 02:16:05.890
<v Speaker 3>it's never really spot on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not just here glimmers of what </v>

3051
02:16:05.890 --> 02:16:09.830
<v Speaker 3>the song completed sounds like until </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's completed and then it's just </v>

3052
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:12.711
<v Speaker 3>everything's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's how I can sit there and </v>

3053
02:16:12.711 --> 02:16:12.711
<v Speaker 3>listen to a mix and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something's off.</v>

3054
02:16:12.711 --> 02:16:13.970
<v Speaker 3>Because in my completed version,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3055
02:16:13.980 --> 02:16:17.460
<v Speaker 3>it's like a coloring book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every record starts off in one way,</v>

3056
02:16:17.461 --> 02:16:22.461
<v Speaker 3>just blank and I'm just filling in all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the colors and then there's one color </v>

3057
02:16:22.461 --> 02:16:22.461
<v Speaker 3>still missing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3058
02:16:22.461 --> 02:16:24.630
<v Speaker 3>that's what's happening in the final,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the ninth end.</v>

3059
02:16:24.631 --> 02:16:25.890
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we're mixing the album,</v>

3060
02:16:25.891 --> 02:16:28.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's still some colors that </v>
<v Speaker 3>just not in there yet.</v>

3061
02:16:29.230 --> 02:16:29.980
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm going through</v>

3062
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:34.980
<v Speaker 4>sounds and I find the colors and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything's full and I'm cool or I </v>

3063
02:16:34.980 --> 02:16:35.740
<v Speaker 4>might not find the exact color,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some close enough I'm fine.</v>

3064
02:16:36.110 --> 02:16:41.110
<v Speaker 4>And like that's literally where it's at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you have to make the executive </v>

3065
02:16:41.110 --> 02:16:41.110
<v Speaker 4>decision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3066
02:16:41.110 --> 02:16:45.361
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm done with this or I'll be sitting </v>

3067
02:16:45.361 --> 02:16:46.690
<v Speaker 4>for another two weeks trying to sit with</v>
<v Speaker 4>this mix because I'm really anal about </v>

3068
02:16:46.690 --> 02:16:47.410
<v Speaker 4>it and if I don't just back away and let</v>
<v Speaker 4>it be,</v>

3069
02:16:48.100 --> 02:16:49.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll never hear any news.</v>

3070
02:16:49.540 --> 02:16:52.210
<v Speaker 4>That's a fascinating insight into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>creation of music.</v>

3071
02:16:52.330 --> 02:16:53.440
<v Speaker 4>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3072
02:16:53.500 --> 02:16:56.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't know anYbody that does that </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3073
02:16:56.560 --> 02:17:01.560
<v Speaker 4>well where they could tell me about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>entire process from the beginning to </v>

3074
02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:01.560
<v Speaker 4>end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's interesting to get a window into</v>

3075
02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:03.970
<v Speaker 4>that world because I always wondered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always wondered,</v>

3076
02:17:03.971 --> 02:17:06.640
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know jj never writes his lyrics down.</v>

3077
02:17:06.730 --> 02:17:07.960
<v Speaker 4>It keeps them all in his head.</v>

3078
02:17:08.530 --> 02:17:10.510
<v Speaker 4>Do you do that or do you actually write </v>
<v Speaker 4>them down somewhere?</v>

3079
02:17:10.590 --> 02:17:13.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I'm sometimes.</v>

3080
02:17:14.070 --> 02:17:16.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of hooks are in my head,</v>

3081
02:17:17.050 --> 02:17:22.050
<v Speaker 4>but I need to write certain things down </v>
<v Speaker 4>to make sure I'm making sense.</v>

3082
02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:26.320
<v Speaker 4>I used to do a lot of my earlier stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>just off the dome,</v>

3083
02:17:26.321 --> 02:17:27.640
<v Speaker 4>just freestyle and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3084
02:17:27.641 --> 02:17:30.160
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes that works good with </v>
<v Speaker 4>melodies.</v>

3085
02:17:30.161 --> 02:17:35.161
<v Speaker 4>I do that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll go in there and just flows and try </v>

3086
02:17:35.161 --> 02:17:38.140
<v Speaker 4>different things like that and melodies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's really just a combination.</v>

3087
02:17:38.141 --> 02:17:39.810
<v Speaker 4>It's never the psych,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3088
02:17:40.930 --> 02:17:43.730
<v Speaker 4>always like writing off the dome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like some ballots out.</v>

3089
02:17:43.731 --> 02:17:45.130
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Completely off the dome.</v>

3090
02:17:45.190 --> 02:17:47.290
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need paper for a ballot,</v>

3091
02:17:47.291 --> 02:17:50.160
<v Speaker 4>but like turn off the dome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3092
02:17:50.170 --> 02:17:52.090
<v Speaker 4>that's a great term.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna use that from now on.</v>

3093
02:17:52.270 --> 02:17:57.270
<v Speaker 4>Whenever there's a joke that I have this</v>
<v Speaker 4>written down anywhere it's going to be </v>

3094
02:17:57.270 --> 02:17:57.270
<v Speaker 4>offered dome that that was the end.</v>

3095
02:17:57.270 --> 02:18:00.250
<v Speaker 4>I feel like that it kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3096
02:18:00.430 --> 02:18:02.080
<v Speaker 4>gets people to understand that this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

3097
02:18:02.580 --> 02:18:05.080
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this spontaneousness of it,</v>

3098
02:18:05.140 --> 02:18:10.140
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that some turn that rappers use all </v>

3099
02:18:10.140 --> 02:18:10.140
<v Speaker 4>the time or is that your term off the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dome?</v>

3100
02:18:10.140 --> 02:18:12.440
<v Speaker 4>Is that yours?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yours.</v>

3101
02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:17.800

<v Speaker 4>the dome.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3142
02:19:52.210 --> 02:19:56.350
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's money being spent and it's </v>

3143
02:19:56.350 --> 02:19:56.350
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Time is of the essence.</v>

3144
02:19:56.350 --> 02:19:56.870
<v Speaker 4>This is what we hustled and worked hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>for.</v>

3145
02:19:57.530 --> 02:19:58.610
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I have to,</v>

3146
02:19:58.670 --> 02:20:00.370
<v Speaker 4>I had to remind myself is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3147
02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:03.590
<v Speaker 4>this has turned into a fucking party.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we're here for work.</v>

3148
02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:07.070
<v Speaker 4>So I also have this like really gnarly </v>
<v Speaker 4>work ethic.</v>

3149
02:20:07.071 --> 02:20:09.080
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause I've been working since I was 15.</v>

3150
02:20:09.180 --> 02:20:12.830
<v Speaker 4>My first job was wendy's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember why I wanted to work.</v>

3151
02:20:12.831 --> 02:20:17.831
<v Speaker 4>It was because I wanted my own shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was tired of asking my mom for stuff </v>

3152
02:20:17.831 --> 02:20:21.370
<v Speaker 4>and also didn't think it was fair to ask</v>
<v Speaker 4>my mom for stuff because I know we </v>

3153
02:20:21.370 --> 02:20:21.410
<v Speaker 4>didn't have much.</v>

3154
02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:26.600
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just at work for me is always like one</v>

3155
02:20:26.601 --> 02:20:28.260
<v Speaker 4>of those things that's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3156
02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:31.490
<v Speaker 4>But like there was also some jobs that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't fucking take seriously,</v>

3157
02:20:31.491 --> 02:20:33.320
<v Speaker 4>like american apparel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3158
02:20:33.940 --> 02:20:36.320
<v Speaker 4>where I was coming in late and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>give a shit.</v>

3159
02:20:36.350 --> 02:20:41.350
<v Speaker 4>And then like when my boss fired me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he took me to this office and kind </v>

3160
02:20:41.350 --> 02:20:41.470
<v Speaker 4>of told me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3161
02:20:41.890 --> 02:20:43.430
<v Speaker 4>and when he said he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna have to let you go.</v>

3162
02:20:43.431 --> 02:20:43.850
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3163
02:20:44.330 --> 02:20:45.010
<v Speaker 4>I figured that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3164
02:20:45.920 --> 02:20:47.140
<v Speaker 4>because I didn't give a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3165
02:20:47.150 --> 02:20:48.950
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I can go to the studio.</v>

3166
02:20:49.140 --> 02:20:54.140
<v Speaker 4>Well it's probably work and like work on</v>
<v Speaker 4>my craft and then maybe find a better </v>

3167
02:20:54.140 --> 02:20:54.710
<v Speaker 4>paying job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3168
02:20:54.711 --> 02:20:57.440
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't have me in the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>basement of some buiLding,</v>

3169
02:20:57.441 --> 02:20:59.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sweating my ass off for clothes.</v>

3170
02:20:59.390 --> 02:21:01.610
<v Speaker 4>Everybody says you should always do your</v>
<v Speaker 4>best at every job you do.</v>

3171
02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:04.970
<v Speaker 4>A champion in life as a champion and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything they do.</v>

3172
02:21:04.971 --> 02:21:07.330
<v Speaker 4>So if you're going to mop floors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do your best to my peers,</v>

3173
02:21:07.390 --> 02:21:10.490
<v Speaker 4>my the fuck out of floors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's great on paper.</v>

3174
02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:12.590
<v Speaker 4>But the reality is when you're a young </v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3175
02:21:12.620 --> 02:21:14.720
<v Speaker 4>it's sometimes it's good to fuck off at </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

3176
02:21:14.721 --> 02:21:16.610
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't ever want to do that again.</v>

3177
02:21:16.611 --> 02:21:19.400
<v Speaker 4>They fire you and then you learn and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some,</v>

3178
02:21:19.430 --> 02:21:21.560
<v Speaker 4>there's some value in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's unfortunate,</v>

3179
02:21:21.561 --> 02:21:26.561
<v Speaker 4>but we don't all learn the best way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes we got to get fired from </v>

3180
02:21:26.561 --> 02:21:30.371
<v Speaker 4>american apparel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least I didn't get fired for like </v>

3181
02:21:30.371 --> 02:21:33.900
<v Speaker 4>stealing something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got fired for being a shitty </v>

3182
02:21:33.900 --> 02:21:36.251
<v Speaker 4>landscaper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>scalp and people's lawns that fuck </v>

3183
02:21:36.340 --> 02:21:41.340
<v Speaker 4>somebody's emotions and that would hurt </v>
<v Speaker 4>my feelings if somebody just was like </v>

3184
02:21:41.340 --> 02:21:41.660
<v Speaker 4>the word around town that I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3185
02:21:41.661 --> 02:21:43.610
<v Speaker 4>my main bread and butter I've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing,</v>

3186
02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:45.650
<v Speaker 4>investing my life in shitty yet.</v>

3187
02:21:47.380 --> 02:21:52.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't invested in being atlanta </v>

3188
02:21:52.380 --> 02:21:52.970
<v Speaker 4>mayor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not toddler boy landscaper.</v>

3189
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

3190
02:21:53.961 --> 02:21:54.800
<v Speaker 4>I know what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3191
02:21:54.950 --> 02:21:59.950
<v Speaker 4>It says there's a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing when you're creating your own </v>

3192
02:21:59.950 --> 02:22:01.190
<v Speaker 4>stuff when you're working for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's like a focus,</v>

3193
02:22:01.220 --> 02:22:04.130
<v Speaker 4>like an obsession almost type focused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the laser beam.</v>

3194
02:22:04.260 --> 02:22:06.230
<v Speaker 4>I love that term.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The lab too.</v>

3195
02:22:06.260 --> 02:22:08.240
<v Speaker 4>That's one of my favorite terms for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rap,</v>

3196
02:22:08.570 --> 02:22:10.970
<v Speaker 4>the rap world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They love talking about being the lab,</v>

3197
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:14.360
<v Speaker 4>creating material who are like an </v>
<v Speaker 4>inventor scientist,</v>

3198
02:22:14.610 --> 02:22:15.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

3199
02:22:15.980 --> 02:22:20.980
<v Speaker 4>it's kinda like I treated and every </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense of the word in every sense of </v>

3200
02:22:20.980 --> 02:22:21.230
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3201
02:22:21.290 --> 02:22:22.370
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3202
02:22:22.610 --> 02:22:23.650
<v Speaker 4>that term.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I asked him,</v>

3203
02:22:23.651 --> 02:22:26.430
<v Speaker 4>no lab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like where I'm working,</v>

3204
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:31.550
<v Speaker 4>it's working and almost don't like </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing around and in the studio like </v>

3205
02:22:31.550 --> 02:22:33.990
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like because it is a place for work,</v>

3206
02:22:33.991 --> 02:22:36.120
<v Speaker 4>it is an office,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're trying to write,</v>

3207
02:22:36.300 --> 02:22:38.340
<v Speaker 4>if you're trying to write things there </v>
<v Speaker 4>too as well.</v>

3208
02:22:38.340 --> 02:22:43.340
<v Speaker 4>He tried to write lyrics and dudes are </v>
<v Speaker 4>all jumping around and not even know </v>

3209
02:22:43.340 --> 02:22:45.030
<v Speaker 4>what if I'm not even just me sitting </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and I might not have an idea yet.</v>

3210
02:22:45.300 --> 02:22:47.430
<v Speaker 4>even if I might just eating silence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

3211
02:22:47.431 --> 02:22:47.970
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3212
02:22:48.030 --> 02:22:50.160
<v Speaker 4>I might just need fucking silence for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit.</v>

3213
02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:50.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3214
02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:55.080
<v Speaker 4>I've never been to any sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>recording studio where anybody was doing</v>

3215
02:22:55.081 --> 02:23:00.081
<v Speaker 4>anything like serious like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I would imagine it's very difficult </v>

3216
02:23:00.081 --> 02:23:00.570
<v Speaker 4>to avoid the party.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3217
02:23:00.571 --> 02:23:05.571
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're in studio and guys come to visit </v>

3218
02:23:05.571 --> 02:23:05.571
<v Speaker 4>you come on by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come to visit.</v>

3219
02:23:05.571 --> 02:23:09.021
<v Speaker 4>We did that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like I did that now I've been </v>

3220
02:23:09.031 --> 02:23:14.031
<v Speaker 4>doing that since like 22,</v>
<v Speaker 4>23 going to studios and having those </v>

3221
02:23:14.071 --> 02:23:19.071
<v Speaker 4>moments with the buttons because in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning it's like you want your boys </v>

3222
02:23:19.071 --> 02:23:22.251
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I kind of got that out of my system </v>

3223
02:23:22.251 --> 02:23:22.251
<v Speaker 4>and now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

3224
02:23:22.251 --> 02:23:23.730
<v Speaker 4>30 year old scott goes with studio by </v>
<v Speaker 4>himself.</v>

3225
02:23:23.730 --> 02:23:25.710

<v Speaker 4>he's in there for maybe five,</v>

3226
02:23:25.711 --> 02:23:28.200
<v Speaker 4>six hours and then he goes home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's smart.</v>

3227

<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then friday night,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3231
02:23:38.671 --> 02:23:39.320
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3232
02:23:39.330 --> 02:23:41.220
<v Speaker 4>No may man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how you get shit done.</v>

3233
02:23:41.280 --> 02:23:46.280
<v Speaker 4>That is how you get shit done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just cycle those music videos </v>

3234
02:23:46.280 --> 02:23:46.830
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When they show the recording studio,</v>

3235
02:23:46.831 --> 02:23:51.831
<v Speaker 4>it's always a giant table.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like all those little switches </v>

3236
02:23:51.831 --> 02:23:51.831
<v Speaker 4>that nobody understands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you mixing board.</v>

3237
02:23:51.831 --> 02:23:54.950
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's everybody standing in front </v>
<v Speaker 4>of all the switches and then everybody's</v>

3238
02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:56.580
<v Speaker 4>partying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's in the background,</v>

3239
02:23:56.581 --> 02:24:01.581
<v Speaker 4>having a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that could also be when the album's </v>

3240
02:24:01.581 --> 02:24:01.581
<v Speaker 4>done and they're celebrating it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what also happens.</v>

3241
02:24:01.581 --> 02:24:06.500
<v Speaker 4>like when I'm done with the say that's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>finished maybe eight songs and I feel </v>

3242
02:24:06.721 --> 02:24:10.110
<v Speaker 4>like I've got the album like and I just </v>
<v Speaker 4>need maybe a couple more jams.</v>

3243
02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:12.600
<v Speaker 4>You start inviting people to come here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you got,</v>

3244
02:24:13.570 --> 02:24:16.940
<v Speaker 4>so you have those moments too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you might see that happen and,</v>

3245
02:24:16.950 --> 02:24:21.950
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a year and a half of just </v>

3246
02:24:21.950 --> 02:24:22.620
<v Speaker 4>studio by myself before that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3247
02:24:22.621 --> 02:24:27.621
<v Speaker 4>like I don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And maybe a case that had one or two </v>

3248
02:24:27.621 --> 02:24:27.621
<v Speaker 4>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3249
02:24:27.621 --> 02:24:28.390
<v Speaker 4>maybe some one of my director friends </v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

3250
02:24:28.391 --> 02:24:29.910
<v Speaker 4>or um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my fellow actors.</v>

3251
02:24:29.911 --> 02:24:33.960
<v Speaker 4>So I just kinda want who have never </v>
<v Speaker 4>really got a chance to be in the studio,</v>

3252
02:24:34.380 --> 02:24:36.570
<v Speaker 4>come by and just see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get to experience,</v>

3253
02:24:36.571 --> 02:24:41.571
<v Speaker 4>but they're not in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're distracted me there just </v>

3254
02:24:41.571 --> 02:24:41.780
<v Speaker 4>watching and paying attention and want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to just be a fly on the wall,</v>

3255
02:24:41.820 --> 02:24:43.350
<v Speaker 4>see how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3256
02:24:43.380 --> 02:24:46.310
<v Speaker 4>Well a lot of people are really curious </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it because it's a,</v>

3257
02:24:46.311 --> 02:24:51.311
<v Speaker 4>it's almost a sort of a mysterious type </v>
<v Speaker 4>of creativity if people aren't involved </v>

3258
02:24:51.331 --> 02:24:53.220
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially the creating of music is such</v>

3259
02:24:53.221 --> 02:24:55.400
<v Speaker 4>a cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3260
02:24:55.440 --> 02:24:59.460
<v Speaker 4>it's such a cultural influence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So sort of powerful Influence like music</v>

3261
02:24:59.461 --> 02:25:01.430
<v Speaker 4>has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It inspires people.</v>

3262
02:25:01.431 --> 02:25:03.660
<v Speaker 4>Like when you listening to music at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>gym,</v>

3263
02:25:03.930 --> 02:25:08.930
<v Speaker 4>it can make you work out better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you put your headphones on and you </v>

3264
02:25:08.930 --> 02:25:13.101
<v Speaker 4>play some awesome songs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't give a fuck that you're on </v>

3265
02:25:13.101 --> 02:25:13.101
<v Speaker 4>some stupid stamp machine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a hamster.</v>

3266
02:25:13.101 --> 02:25:14.160
<v Speaker 4>He just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3267
02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:16.740
<v Speaker 4>And the music you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you liked the music so much.</v>

3268
02:25:16.741 --> 02:25:18.930
<v Speaker 4>you get into it and it's only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's in your head,</v>

3269
02:25:19.170 --> 02:25:24.170
<v Speaker 4>drowning out everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you don't realize how heavier </v>

3270
02:25:24.170 --> 02:25:24.170
<v Speaker 4>breathing until you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you</v>

3271
02:25:24.170 --> 02:25:25.390
<v Speaker 1>take the earplugs out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

3272
02:25:25.391 --> 02:25:27.040
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be getting it in.</v>

3273
02:25:27.140 --> 02:25:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Working here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because of nothing else like hits </v>

3274
02:25:32.140 --> 02:25:33.310
<v Speaker 1>you like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people's words.</v>

3275
02:25:33.311 --> 02:25:38.311
<v Speaker 1>They don't sustain that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't like read incredibly </v>

3276
02:25:38.311 --> 02:25:39.760
<v Speaker 1>passionate essay and it sustains you </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a workout like that.</v>

3277
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Like it needs to be just something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

3278
02:25:44.261 --> 02:25:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Nothing like music in that respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has,</v>

3279
02:25:46.450 --> 02:25:48.400
<v Speaker 1>it has an impact that very few things </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

3280
02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:53.790
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that process of creating it is always </v>

3281
02:25:53.790 --> 02:25:57.120
<v Speaker 1>fascinating and mysterious to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like me that don't have any musical </v>

3282
02:25:57.120 --> 02:25:57.120
<v Speaker 1>talent at all.</v>

3283
02:25:57.120 --> 02:25:57.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see it.</v>

3284
02:25:58.370 --> 02:26:00.210
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3285
02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:03.860
<v Speaker 3>I just approached it in a different way </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm just,</v>

3286
02:26:04.910 --> 02:26:07.660
<v Speaker 3>I do feel like I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time I'm in the studio it's like,</v>

3287
02:26:07.661 --> 02:26:09.050
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me just,</v>

3288
02:26:09.080 --> 02:26:14.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to create the uncreated and it's </v>

3289
02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:16.040
<v Speaker 3>a very private thing sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3290
02:26:16.490 --> 02:26:18.800
<v Speaker 3>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be able to,</v>

3291
02:26:18.920 --> 02:26:20.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have my privacy when I do that.</v>

3292
02:26:21.460 --> 02:26:21.960
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3293
02:26:22.100 --> 02:26:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3294
02:26:22.551 --> 02:26:23.450
<v Speaker 1>I totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do.</v>

3295
02:26:23.451 --> 02:26:28.451
<v Speaker 1>You do all your writing and everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the studio or do you sometimes sit </v>

3296
02:26:28.451 --> 02:26:28.451
<v Speaker 1>at home?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3308
02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:47.330
<v Speaker 3>I just kinda see if I'm recording </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

3309
02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:49.810
<v Speaker 3>some melody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking of something,</v>

3310
02:26:50.130 --> 02:26:55.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm not thinking of wraps like days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's less about that now and it's more </v>

3311
02:26:55.130 --> 02:26:59.801
<v Speaker 3>about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just melodies and coming up with </v>

3312
02:27:00.051 --> 02:27:05.051
<v Speaker 3>songs and structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to hear the sound and then the </v>

3313
02:27:05.051 --> 02:27:05.690
<v Speaker 3>lyrics come next Because the music is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just going to tell me what to say,</v>

3314
02:27:05.970 --> 02:27:07.370
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3315
02:27:07.430 --> 02:27:10.040
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so cool.</v>

3316
02:27:10.041 --> 02:27:14.780
<v Speaker 3>Now how much of your creation is done </v>
<v Speaker 3>under the influence of marijuana?</v>

3317
02:27:15.500 --> 02:27:19.250
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't smoke to create.</v>

3318
02:27:19.340 --> 02:27:22.280
<v Speaker 3>I've come up with a lot of shit sober </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes when I'm fresh.</v>

3319
02:27:22.310 --> 02:27:27.310
<v Speaker 3>Waking up in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sometimes the most ideas at like </v>

3320
02:27:27.310 --> 02:27:27.310
<v Speaker 3>8:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>AM.</v>

3321
02:27:27.310 --> 02:27:27.310
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes people say that</v>

3322
02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:30.820
<v Speaker 1>writers like Stephen King I believe does</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of his writing in the morning.</v>

3323
02:27:30.821 --> 02:27:32.770
<v Speaker 1>I think he doesn't like nine to noon </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

3324
02:27:32.820 --> 02:27:34.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like man,</v>

3325
02:27:34.351 --> 02:27:38.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm fresh in the morning with something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some melody and it usually comes,</v>

3326
02:27:38.321 --> 02:27:41.880
<v Speaker 3>is walking through the house making </v>
<v Speaker 3>breakfast and you know,</v>

3327
02:27:42.190 --> 02:27:44.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be whenever dropping a deuce,</v>

3328
02:27:44.580 --> 02:27:49.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I come up with just melodies here and </v>

3329
02:27:49.580 --> 02:27:53.151
<v Speaker 3>there and I record them all if something</v>
<v Speaker 3>really catches me because If I don't </v>

3330
02:27:53.151 --> 02:27:53.151
<v Speaker 3>record them immediately then I lose </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

3331
02:27:53.151 --> 02:27:53.820
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3332
02:27:54.180 --> 02:27:57.050
<v Speaker 3>I got to record them somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

3333
02:27:57.051 --> 02:27:58.220
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3334
02:27:58.430 --> 02:28:03.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always thinking about music as much </v>

3335
02:28:03.430 --> 02:28:05.990
<v Speaker 3>as like I like to deny it and go shoot a</v>
<v Speaker 3>movie and shit and,</v>

3336
02:28:06.060 --> 02:28:08.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always think about music.</v>

3337
02:28:08.611 --> 02:28:11.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm obsessed with the idea of just </v>
<v Speaker 3>making,</v>

3338
02:28:11.670 --> 02:28:15.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most beautiful songs that like,</v>

3339
02:28:15.590 --> 02:28:20.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really make people feel some type of </v>

3340
02:28:20.590 --> 02:28:21.150
<v Speaker 3>comfort or some type of understanding </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the world is so fucked.</v>

3341
02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:22.070
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

3342
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:23.750
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3343
02:28:24.050 --> 02:28:25.970
<v Speaker 4>I just really am obsessed with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea.</v>

3344
02:28:25.971 --> 02:28:27.800
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm always going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>anomalous,</v>

3345
02:28:27.910 --> 02:28:30.020
<v Speaker 4>just trying different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different ways of doing that.</v>

3346
02:28:30.021 --> 02:28:30.590
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3347
02:28:31.100 --> 02:28:33.350
<v Speaker 4>we did the rap shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we did the rock album.</v>

3348
02:28:33.680 --> 02:28:36.440
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm just trying to be disliked weird</v>
<v Speaker 4>instrumentalist,</v>

3349
02:28:37.460 --> 02:28:42.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't really know when that's </v>

3350
02:28:42.460 --> 02:28:42.460
<v Speaker 4>going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just really,</v>

3351
02:28:42.460 --> 02:28:43.940
<v Speaker 4>I guess in the process learned not to </v>
<v Speaker 4>produce better too,</v>

3352
02:28:43.941 --> 02:28:47.480
<v Speaker 4>which is something that I've been trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

3353
02:28:47.740 --> 02:28:52.740
<v Speaker 4>I always want to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's good to be learning and getting </v>

3354
02:28:52.740 --> 02:28:57.071
<v Speaker 4>better as I'm creating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you do any other things other than </v>

3355
02:28:57.071 --> 02:29:00.371
<v Speaker 4>music?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have any other hobbies or things </v>

<v Speaker 4>I like design and sometimes like a,</v>

3357
02:29:04.260 --> 02:29:06.650
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't look at myself as like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fashion designer,</v>

3358
02:29:06.651 --> 02:29:09.620
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if an opportunity comes around I'll do a</v>

<v Speaker 4>horror movies,</v>

3375
02:29:50.300 --> 02:29:55.300
<v Speaker 4>ideas I've had in my head for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just start jotting them down and </v>

3376
02:29:55.300 --> 02:29:56.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just everything right now.</v>

3377
02:29:56.481 --> 02:29:59.750
<v Speaker 4>It's just me expressing whatever comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>to mind,</v>

3378
02:29:59.770 --> 02:30:00.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3380
02:30:03.070 --> 02:30:03.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

3381
02:30:03.381 --> 02:30:08.381
<v Speaker 4>that's a dream job for people to be able</v>
<v Speaker 4>to just come up with things all the </v>

3382
02:30:08.381 --> 02:30:12.611
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's work on creating your entire day </v>

3383
02:30:12.611 --> 02:30:12.611
<v Speaker 4>is spent mostly just concentrating on </v>
<v Speaker 4>creating.</v>

3384
02:30:12.611 --> 02:30:14.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing anything with those things</v>
<v Speaker 4>yet,</v>

3385
02:30:14.111 --> 02:30:15.590
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's stimulating,</v>

3386
02:30:15.591 --> 02:30:18.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't mean that I'm gonna have some</v>

3387
02:30:18.021 --> 02:30:21.740
<v Speaker 4>tv show tomorrow or anything or it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>just for me,</v>

3388
02:30:21.741 --> 02:30:22.130
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

3389
02:30:22.940 --> 02:30:24.260
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's stimulating,</v>

3390
02:30:24.410 --> 02:30:25.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3391
02:30:25.021 --> 02:30:28.090
<v Speaker 4>and shit knowing me I'll fuck around and</v>
<v Speaker 4>my right,</v>

3392
02:30:28.160 --> 02:30:29.230
<v Speaker 4>the next shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3393
02:30:29.640 --> 02:30:34.640
<v Speaker 4>like something that yet or something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that could lead me to some showing who </v>

3394
02:30:36.501 --> 02:30:38.290
<v Speaker 4>knows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>

3395
02:30:38.530 --> 02:30:40.300
<v Speaker 4>and it probably also helps you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

3396
02:30:40.301 --> 02:30:42.230
<v Speaker 4>your creativity and the other areas as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

3397
02:30:42.231 --> 02:30:43.760
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then on top of that,</v>

3398
02:30:43.880 --> 02:30:46.340
<v Speaker 4>I was the king of being like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3399
02:30:46.341 --> 02:30:47.480
<v Speaker 4>I have this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but nah,</v>

3400
02:30:47.481 --> 02:30:48.590
<v Speaker 4>that's not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or no,</v>

3401
02:30:48.591 --> 02:30:49.310
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't do that.</v>

3402
02:30:49.490 --> 02:30:50.840
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>music is my thing.</v>

3403
02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:51.530
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't do that.</v>

3404
02:30:51.920 --> 02:30:56.920
<v Speaker 4>So now I'm past that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now there's nothing if it pops into my </v>

3405
02:30:56.920 --> 02:30:58.130
<v Speaker 4>mind and I can fucking do it because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought about it for a reason.</v>

3406
02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:04.000
<v Speaker 4>So now it's just about finding time for </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain projects and I'm not no rush.</v>

3407
02:31:04.251 --> 02:31:06.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I worried about being pigeon holed,</v>

3408
02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:11.320
<v Speaker 4>you're saying no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I think I've done enough strong </v>

3409
02:31:11.320 --> 02:31:14.561
<v Speaker 4>arm and let me get my space as an artist</v>
<v Speaker 4>where I can kind of do whatever I want </v>

3410
02:31:14.751 --> 02:31:17.960
<v Speaker 4>now at this point she reached out to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want us to be good though.</v>

3411
02:31:17.980 --> 02:31:18.960
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't get me wrong.</v>

3412
02:31:19.350 --> 02:31:23.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm always feeling like I'm vulnerable </v>
<v Speaker 4>to make some bullshit though.</v>

3413
02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:28.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel like I'm invincible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think a lot of artists do get to </v>

3414
02:31:28.760 --> 02:31:28.760
<v Speaker 4>that point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They feel invincible.</v>

3415
02:31:28.760 --> 02:31:30.540
<v Speaker 4>Like I am very capable of making some </v>
<v Speaker 4>weak shit.</v>

3416
02:31:31.350 --> 02:31:33.440
<v Speaker 4>Y'all motherfuckers don't hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3417
02:31:33.450 --> 02:31:38.450
<v Speaker 4>and he asked because I'm sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 4>and making sure that this is not weak </v>

3418
02:31:38.450 --> 02:31:38.550
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scrapping the ones that are and,</v>

<v Speaker 4>kinda compressing all those sounds to </v>
<v Speaker 4>one track to make that mp3.</v>

3472
02:33:44.751 --> 02:33:44.751
<v Speaker 4>just like right now I think this is all </v>

3475
02:33:49.561 --> 02:33:53.520
<v Speaker 4>if I bounce it down it's like dope and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of this shit can be for someone else</v>

3478
02:33:57.451 --> 02:34:02.451
<v Speaker 4>it seems like when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when there's a song that I really like </v>

3479
02:34:02.451 --> 02:34:03.750
<v Speaker 4>at any genre,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like I really like it.</v>

3480
02:34:03.870 --> 02:34:06.150
<v Speaker 4>I like it at first and then I started </v>
<v Speaker 4>really liking it.</v>

3481

<v Speaker 4>I hear it a bunch of times and as out </v>

3482
02:34:11.151 --> 02:34:11.151

3486
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:20.290
<v Speaker 3>of times.</v>

3555
02:37:09.790 --> 02:37:11.350
<v Speaker 3>to know that you're in the same building</v>
<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's more therapy.</v>

3561

<v Speaker 3>nothing of it.</v>

3588
02:38:32.151 --> 02:38:34.120
<v Speaker 3>But then I saw a lot of people responded</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this could be bad,</v>

3592
02:38:41.430 --> 02:38:43.250
<v Speaker 3>could be really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's like,</v>

02:38:43.251 --> 02:38:44.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the imu,</v>

3598
02:38:53.980 --> 02:38:56.330
<v Speaker 3>you want them to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody asked me,</v>

3599
02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:01.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's kinda how I looked at it and </v>

3600
02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:01.480
<v Speaker 3>it ended up being this thing.</v>

3601
02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:06.400
<v Speaker 3>But then I know that you talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics and you have specifically </v>

3602
02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:09.521
<v Speaker 3>talked about dmt because I answered the </v>
<v Speaker 3>question about dmt and that's why I was </v>

3603
02:39:09.521 --> 02:39:09.521
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3604
02:39:09.521 --> 02:39:10.870
<v Speaker 3>we should talk about this with joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3605
02:39:10.970 --> 02:39:14.390
<v Speaker 3>because I know that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I can't sit down with anybody and</v>

3606
02:39:14.391 --> 02:39:16.400
<v Speaker 3>talk about dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even some of my friends,</v>

3607
02:39:16.401 --> 02:39:21.401
<v Speaker 3>I've told them that I've done it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have like looked at me in a way </v>

3608
02:39:21.401 --> 02:39:21.500
<v Speaker 3>where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3609
02:39:21.501 --> 02:39:22.280
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

3610
02:39:22.790 --> 02:39:25.270
<v Speaker 3>you did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a game changer man.</v>

3611
02:39:25.870 --> 02:39:30.870
<v Speaker 3>But that lets me know that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that don't understand it and </v>

3612
02:39:30.870 --> 02:39:33.521
<v Speaker 3>they're not educated about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they just kind of hear these </v>

3613
02:39:33.521 --> 02:39:33.950
<v Speaker 3>stories and that's also why I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3614
02:39:33.951 --> 02:39:38.951
<v Speaker 3>it would be dope to if we just sat down </v>
<v Speaker 3>and talked about it and educate some </v>

3615
02:39:38.951 --> 02:39:39.860
<v Speaker 3>people because I just know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3616
02:39:39.861 --> 02:39:42.080
<v Speaker 3>even some people are scared of acid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a scary thing,</v>

3617
02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:47.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tell people I remember this is a true </v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it wasn't because of me was because </v>

3650
02:40:58.850 --> 02:41:01.530
<v Speaker 3>I let some other motherfucker come into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the situation that wasn't ready with his</v>

<v Speaker 3>nobody abandoned and I feel like that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the big thing with psychedelics is if </v>

3659
02:41:21.731 --> 02:41:23.220
<v Speaker 3>you're doing it with people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter if you know them well or not,</v>

3660
02:41:23.221 --> 02:41:25.980
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to really leave nobody </v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging,</v>

3662
02:41:28.150 --> 02:41:30.870
<v Speaker 3>You want to try to find that common </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground because everybody tripping,</v>

3665
02:41:38.140 --> 02:41:39.240
<v Speaker 3>tripping and it's scary because somebody</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets to be like one minute he was trying</v>

<v Speaker 1>Sit barrett.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Syd barrett was the one who went bond.</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3697
02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:49.950
<v Speaker 1>apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true,</v>

3698
02:42:50.090 --> 02:42:55.090
<v Speaker 1>the whole lsd thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but through the it says this is the </v>

3699
02:42:55.090 --> 02:42:56.870
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says throughout late 1960 for um,</v>

3700
02:42:57.270 --> 02:42:59.540
<v Speaker 1>for barrett,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for syd barrett throughout ninth,</v>

3701
02:42:59.580 --> 02:43:04.580
<v Speaker 1>late 1967 in the early 1968,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barrett's behavior became increasingly </v>

3702
02:43:04.580 --> 02:43:09.351
<v Speaker 1>erratic and unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly as a consequence of his reported </v>

3703
02:43:09.351 --> 02:43:11.380
<v Speaker 1>heavy use of psychedelic drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>most prominently lsd.</v>

3704
02:43:11.590 --> 02:43:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Many reports described him onstage </v>
<v Speaker 1>drumming one cord through the entire </v>

3705
02:43:16.590 --> 02:43:20.671
<v Speaker 1>concert or not playing at all.</v>

<v Speaker 1>interstellar overdrive.</v>

3707
02:43:22.841 --> 02:43:27.841
<v Speaker 1>Barrett slowly detuned his guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The audience seemed to enjoy such </v>

3708
02:43:27.841 --> 02:43:30.370
<v Speaker 1>antics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unaware of the rest of the bands.</v>

3715
02:43:49.320 --> 02:43:52.900
<v Speaker 1>He was my hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went out there for whatever reason.</v>

3716
02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:54.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't use my hero.</v>

3717
02:43:54.400 --> 02:43:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might've lost it.</v>

3718

<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

3722
02:44:06.071 --> 02:44:06.071
<v Speaker 1>floyd for acid.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He was still in that old relationship.</v>

3724
02:44:13.020 --> 02:44:14.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about cigarettes earlier</v>

3725
02:44:14.861 --> 02:44:19.861
<v Speaker 1>and in a world where cigarettes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal and they kill half a million </v>

3726
02:44:19.861 --> 02:44:22.950
<v Speaker 1>people in this country alone every year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's preposterous to think that we're </v>

3727
02:44:22.950 --> 02:44:25.840
<v Speaker 1>too much of a group of fucking babies to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with psychedelics.</v>

3728
02:44:26.380 --> 02:44:29.020
<v Speaker 1>We need like centers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need centers,</v>

3729
02:44:29.021 --> 02:44:34.021
<v Speaker 1>we have educated people with degrees and</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that the human body doctors </v>

3730
02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:41.040
<v Speaker 1>who could administrative people can take</v>
<v Speaker 1>care of people and have them in these </v>

3731
02:44:41.040 --> 02:44:42.860
<v Speaker 1>really comfortable environments where </v>
<v Speaker 1>people go and they they,</v>

3732
02:44:42.910 --> 02:44:47.910
<v Speaker 1>they have the possibility in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional setting of experiencing </v>

3733
02:44:47.910 --> 02:44:51.751
<v Speaker 1>these things and that should be a part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of normal human culture because you've </v>

3734
02:44:51.751 --> 02:44:52.900
<v Speaker 1>benefited from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've benefited from it.</v>

3735
02:44:53.140 --> 02:44:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Brian has kind of benefited from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Debatable as he holds up the cigarettes.</v>

<v Speaker 7>whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Overthink about ira.</v>

<v Speaker 7>not done.</v>

3761
02:45:57.831 --> 02:45:59.920
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've done my fair share of asset.</v>

3762
02:45:59.930 --> 02:46:01.900
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm big on psychedelics.</v>

3763
02:46:02.390 --> 02:46:04.210
<v Speaker 7>Dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some next level shit,</v>

3764
02:46:04.211 --> 02:46:09.211
<v Speaker 7>but I've had nothing like this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you try to explain</v>

3765
02:46:10.220 --> 02:46:13.910
<v Speaker 3>it and you can't because there's nothing</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could just know.</v>

3766
02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:17.690
<v Speaker 3>You can't find the words to explain </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes what you see,</v>

3767
02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:19.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3768
02:46:19.500 --> 02:46:21.500
<v Speaker 3>you a little bit more educated about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>than I am.</v>

3769
02:46:21.501 --> 02:46:23.060
<v Speaker 3>You could probAbly find the words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3770
02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:27.050
<v Speaker 3>like sometimes you fucking talk like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientist and she following like,</v>

3771
02:46:27.051 --> 02:46:28.110
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshitting.</v>

3772
02:46:28.590 --> 02:46:30.290
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the same time,</v>

3773
02:46:30.291 --> 02:46:35.291
<v Speaker 3>like for people that might not be </v>
<v Speaker 3>educated and still hard for me to,</v>

3774
02:46:35.800 --> 02:46:37.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put the words what I saw,</v>

3775
02:46:38.420 --> 02:46:40.760
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reality is,</v>

3776
02:46:40.761 --> 02:46:45.290
<v Speaker 3>is what you're seeing is everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally melt down and reconnect,</v>

3777
02:46:45.320 --> 02:46:50.000
<v Speaker 3>deconstruct and reconstruct around you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your eyes are wide open.</v>

3778
02:46:50.690 --> 02:46:52.580
<v Speaker 3>and it literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

3779
02:46:52.610 --> 02:46:54.170
<v Speaker 3>that was the only thing that freaked me </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

3780
02:46:54.171 --> 02:46:59.171
<v Speaker 3>The fact that my eyes weren't closed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my environment was completely </v>

3781
02:46:59.171 --> 02:47:03.971
<v Speaker 3>altered immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost before I could even exhale all </v>

3782
02:47:03.971 --> 02:47:05.780
<v Speaker 3>the smoke before I was even leaning back</v>
<v Speaker 3>on my couch.</v>

3783
02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:10.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean the room rearranged itself and </v>
<v Speaker 3>became something else in it.</v>

3784
02:47:12.770 --> 02:47:13.880
<v Speaker 3>I felt happy.</v>

3785
02:47:14.300 --> 02:47:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Graham hancock has a very fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of looking at it and what he thinks.</v>

3786
02:47:18.890 --> 02:47:23.890
<v Speaker 1>The way he described it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never heard anybody describe it this </v>

3787
02:47:23.890 --> 02:47:23.890
<v Speaker 1>way before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it made total sense.</v>

3788
02:47:23.890 --> 02:47:28.210
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone says you're taking drugs and </v>

3789
02:47:28.210 --> 02:47:28.220
<v Speaker 1>it's distorting your perception of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>

3790
02:47:28.221 --> 02:47:29.420
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

3791
02:47:29.750 --> 02:47:34.750
<v Speaker 1>that is a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another possibility is that like a </v>

3792
02:47:34.750 --> 02:47:37.880
<v Speaker 1>telescope needs to be tuned in to see a </v>
<v Speaker 1>far off star.</v>

3793
02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:42.200
<v Speaker 1>That what you're doing by taking this </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemical that your brain already makes,</v>

3794
02:47:43.100 --> 02:47:47.150
<v Speaker 1>you're tuning into something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinarily impossible for you to see and</v>

3795
02:47:47.151 --> 02:47:51.230
<v Speaker 1>that there is this dimension that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>around you all the time and it is filled</v>

3796
02:47:51.231 --> 02:47:56.231
<v Speaker 1>with intelligent entities and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we must consider that that is also a </v>

3797
02:47:56.481 --> 02:48:01.481
<v Speaker 1>possibility and that is a fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of looking at it because we really </v>

3798
02:48:02.421 --> 02:48:07.421
<v Speaker 1>don't know what's happening and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that aren't blown away by it or </v>

3799
02:48:07.421 --> 02:48:10.721
<v Speaker 1>just the people who haven't done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've done it and you're not blown </v>

3800
02:48:10.721 --> 02:48:10.721
<v Speaker 1>away by it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>

3801
02:48:10.721 --> 02:48:14.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe There's supposedly some people who</v>

3802
02:48:14.750 --> 02:48:19.750
<v Speaker 1>don't have a reaction to dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a small percentage of people </v>

3803
02:48:19.750 --> 02:48:20.990
<v Speaker 1>that try it where nothing happens.</v>

3804
02:48:22.720 --> 02:48:27.720
<v Speaker 3>Went two separate occasions where a </v>
<v Speaker 3>first time it didn't work for me and in </v>

3805
02:48:30.221 --> 02:48:35.221
<v Speaker 3>the second time it did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was the first time bad stuff or do you </v>

3806
02:48:35.221 --> 02:48:35.380
<v Speaker 3>just not think the first time we didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>administer it?</v>

3807
02:48:35.381 --> 02:48:40.381
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the second time it was </v>

3808
02:48:40.381 --> 02:48:42.180
<v Speaker 3>downright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The second time it was the second time </v>

3809
02:48:42.180 --> 02:48:45.300
<v Speaker 3>was also I hit it extra hard because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a mistake.</v>

3810
02:48:45.311 --> 02:48:50.311
<v Speaker 3>It's going to work this time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I had this really like I'm at man,</v>

3811
02:48:51.040 --> 02:48:52.420
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

3812
02:48:52.421 --> 02:48:53.080
<v Speaker 3>that shit was crazy</v>

3813
02:48:53.430 --> 02:48:56.160
<v Speaker 1>story is the same as yours almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3814
02:48:56.230 --> 02:48:59.260
<v Speaker 1>it's slightly different in that I did it</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time I did it.</v>

3815
02:48:59.380 --> 02:49:03.910
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty fucking profound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intensely profound and I thought I'd hit</v>

3816
02:49:03.911 --> 02:49:05.790
<v Speaker 1>the center of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I'd.</v>

3817
02:49:06.150 --> 02:49:08.010
<v Speaker 1>And then the second I did it,</v>

3818
02:49:08.010 --> 02:49:13.010
<v Speaker 4>I blew way past that spot to some </v>
<v Speaker 4>complete new place where there was no </v>

3819
02:49:13.081 --> 02:49:14.550
<v Speaker 4>avoiding it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no denying it.</v>

3820
02:49:14.551 --> 02:49:16.170
<v Speaker 4>And I went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh this is it.</v>

3821
02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:21.480
<v Speaker 4>And then that's the spot I've been kinda</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to pretty much every time since </v>

3822
02:49:21.480 --> 02:49:25.131
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the first time was unbelievably </v>

3823
02:49:25.131 --> 02:49:25.140
<v Speaker 4>profound.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Way more profound than anything else and</v>

3824
02:49:25.260 --> 02:49:27.370
<v Speaker 4>I didn't really even get all the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>through me.</v>

3825
02:49:27.371 --> 02:49:28.800
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't been through yet.</v>

3826
02:49:28.970 --> 02:49:30.420
<v Speaker 4>Like that world that you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

3827
02:49:31.020 --> 02:49:34.920
<v Speaker 4>Like I haven't went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I couldn't even get out of whatever</v>

3828
02:49:35.430 --> 02:49:38.790
<v Speaker 4>was happening in that room in my house </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it was.</v>

3829
02:49:39.270 --> 02:49:41.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I want to keep your eyes</v>
<v Speaker 4>open.</v>

3830
02:49:42.070 --> 02:49:43.290
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3831
02:49:43.380 --> 02:49:48.380
<v Speaker 4>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my eyes were wide open because I was so </v>

3832
02:49:48.380 --> 02:49:48.380
<v Speaker 4>intrigued that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3833
02:49:49.020 --> 02:49:50.830
<v Speaker 4>I've seen a bunch of shit around you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3834
02:49:50.831 --> 02:49:54.600
<v Speaker 4>But then when I closed my eyes and I got</v>
<v Speaker 4>over that,</v>

3835
02:49:55.130 --> 02:49:58.490
<v Speaker 4>then I was a whole nother experience and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was this tunnel like thing and then</v>

3836
02:49:58.500 --> 02:49:59.010
<v Speaker 4>it was dark.</v>

3837
02:49:59.040 --> 02:50:00.900
<v Speaker 4>It was more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some evil shit happen in there.</v>

3838
02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:03.210
<v Speaker 4>It didn't freak me out too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

3839
02:50:03.230 --> 02:50:06.810
<v Speaker 4>because I know like that's another thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>people like as long as you,</v>

3840
02:50:06.811 --> 02:50:08.350
<v Speaker 4>if you see some shit that might freak </v>
<v Speaker 4>you out,</v>

3841
02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:10.410
<v Speaker 4>this remember you are on drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3842
02:50:10.411 --> 02:50:15.411
<v Speaker 4>lIke some shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know or you're seeing demons for </v>

3843
02:50:15.411 --> 02:50:15.411
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3844
02:50:15.411 --> 02:50:16.360
<v Speaker 4>But they can't harm you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3845
02:50:16.380 --> 02:50:20.730
<v Speaker 4>just sit your ass still don't fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>move and you'll come back hopefully.</v>

3846
02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:22.500
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hopefully.</v>

3847
02:50:22.590 --> 02:50:27.300
<v Speaker 4>But this was more just like some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some weird shit happened and I didn't go</v>

3848
02:50:27.301 --> 02:50:32.301
<v Speaker 4>down that rabbit hole too far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just kind of opened my eyes back </v>

3849
02:50:32.301 --> 02:50:32.670
<v Speaker 4>open and just kinda still shit was </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>

3850
02:50:33.570 --> 02:50:38.570
<v Speaker 4>But I kid you not joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as soon as I was kinda like I'm all </v>

3851
02:50:38.821 --> 02:50:39.960
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm over this.</v>

3852
02:50:40.180 --> 02:50:43.800
<v Speaker 4>Then I came back and it was kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3853
02:50:43.950 --> 02:50:48.950
<v Speaker 4>I could describe as like an overlapping </v>
<v Speaker 4>a little bit of that world in reality.</v>

3854
02:50:50.130 --> 02:50:53.760
<v Speaker 4>Still a little haze of it where there </v>
<v Speaker 4>was shades of the other world.</v>

3855
02:50:54.210 --> 02:50:56.670
<v Speaker 4>It was almost like I saw a face in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>corner of my room,</v>

3856
02:50:56.671 --> 02:50:58.680
<v Speaker 4>just kind of dipped back off until the </v>
<v Speaker 4>walls.</v>

3857
02:50:59.160 --> 02:51:04.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw like these kinda like spidery </v>

3858
02:51:05.161 --> 02:51:08.310
<v Speaker 4>things kind of coming out and my grammy </v>
<v Speaker 4>and onto the ground.</v>

3859
02:51:09.830 --> 02:51:14.830
<v Speaker 4>But that's the thing though at this </v>
<v Speaker 4>point in my room was back to being it </v>

3860
02:51:14.830 --> 02:51:15.840
<v Speaker 4>being a room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>

3861
02:51:15.841 --> 02:51:19.680
<v Speaker 4>Like I was back to reality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was like this,</v>

3862
02:51:20.970 --> 02:51:21.720
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

3863
02:51:21.721 --> 02:51:22.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world was still.</v>

3864
02:51:22.831 --> 02:51:23.430
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3865
02:51:23.470 --> 02:51:26.820
<v Speaker 4>the echo from where I was at was still </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of in the room,</v>

3866
02:51:27.840 --> 02:51:29.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it hasn't worn off yet.</v>

3867
02:51:29.580 --> 02:51:31.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well next time you do it,</v>

3868
02:51:31.621 --> 02:51:33.720
<v Speaker 4>don't do it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do it.</v>

3869
02:51:33.810 --> 02:51:35.820
<v Speaker 4>Just keep your eyes closed and let it </v>
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>

3870
02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:37.260
<v Speaker 4>Don't keep my eyes open.</v>

3871
02:51:37.410 --> 02:51:38.460
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

3872
02:51:39.030 --> 02:51:41.270
<v Speaker 4>Keeping the eyes open part is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3873
02:51:41.680 --> 02:51:43.110
<v Speaker 4>probably fucking with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>

3874
02:51:43.111 --> 02:51:44.190
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3875
02:51:44.191 --> 02:51:46.470
<v Speaker 4>they say the best way to do it isn't a </v>
<v Speaker 4>really comfortable.</v>

3876
02:51:46.560 --> 02:51:47.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean I loved it though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

3877
02:51:47.700 --> 02:51:50.880
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't absolutely positive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't go to,</v>

3878
02:51:51.630 --> 02:51:56.630
<v Speaker 4>I didn't go to that world that you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you said you were going to because my </v>

3879
02:51:56.630 --> 02:51:56.970
<v Speaker 4>eyes were open.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really just,</v>

3880
02:51:57.180 --> 02:52:02.180
<v Speaker 4>I was just so intriguing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to spend crazy when I got done </v>

3881
02:52:02.180 --> 02:52:04.911
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to paint everything I saw </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I just had never seen that like </v>

3882
02:52:04.911 --> 02:52:05.890
<v Speaker 4>that and I never want to paint.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do</v>

3883
02:52:06.610 --> 02:52:08.260
<v Speaker 1>alex grey's paintings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3884
02:52:08.620 --> 02:52:13.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if it was my shit was </v>

3885
02:52:13.620 --> 02:52:13.620
<v Speaker 1>going to be like that because I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to that world.</v>

3886
02:52:13.620 --> 02:52:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3887
02:52:13.620 --> 02:52:14.630
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just whatever you went to,</v>

3888
02:52:14.640 --> 02:52:17.110
<v Speaker 1>it'd be different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

3889
02:52:17.111 --> 02:52:20.050
<v Speaker 1>you know how you were saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or some of those paintings are just like</v>

3890
02:52:20.051 --> 02:52:22.330
<v Speaker 1>some guy and it's like all this energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>around it and so on.</v>

3891
02:52:22.331 --> 02:52:23.440
<v Speaker 1>These colors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see that.</v>

3892
02:52:24.070 --> 02:52:25.390
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get to yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably.</v>

3893
02:52:25.391 --> 02:52:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well most people don't get enough,</v>

3894
02:52:28.180 --> 02:52:29.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just put it.</v>

3895
02:52:29.081 --> 02:52:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first experience,</v>

3896
02:52:30.581 --> 02:52:35.581
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was pretty fucking amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it still wasn't nothing like the </v>

3897
02:52:35.581 --> 02:52:35.581
<v Speaker 1>second one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second one,</v>

3898
02:52:35.581 --> 02:52:35.581
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3899
02:52:35.581 --> 02:52:37.690
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was rIdiculous.</v>

3900
02:52:37.691 --> 02:52:42.691
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was already there because </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'd seen was still so much </v>

3901
02:52:42.691 --> 02:52:43.000
<v Speaker 1>different than reality.</v>

3902
02:52:43.290 --> 02:52:44.110
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3903
02:52:44.111 --> 02:52:49.111
<v Speaker 1>this is the craziest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was not even close to the actual </v>

3904
02:52:49.111 --> 02:52:49.111
<v Speaker 1>craziest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you close your eyes every time.</v>

3905
02:52:49.111 --> 02:52:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3906
02:52:50.540 --> 02:52:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Never have opened my eyes before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happened?</v>

3907
02:52:53.720 --> 02:52:56.410
<v Speaker 1>She patterns everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's too much.</v>

3908
02:52:56.440 --> 02:52:58.840
<v Speaker 1>I think there's the conflict of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

3909
02:52:58.870 --> 02:53:01.450
<v Speaker 1>There's the information you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>from your eyeballs.</v>

3910
02:53:01.680 --> 02:53:03.100
<v Speaker 1>There's two different trips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3911
02:53:03.101 --> 02:53:05.370
<v Speaker 1>and then there's what's going on in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination or your mind,</v>

3912
02:53:05.430 --> 02:53:10.430
<v Speaker 1>whatever the imagination is not even to </v>
<v Speaker 1>imply that it's not real or it's not a </v>

3913
02:53:10.430 --> 02:53:15.031
<v Speaker 1>real experience that imagined the term </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination is a lot of negative </v>

3914
02:53:15.031 --> 02:53:16.060
<v Speaker 1>connotations to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever it's going on,</v>

3915
02:53:16.061 --> 02:53:17.530
<v Speaker 1>when you got your eyes closed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

3916
02:53:17.680 --> 02:53:19.540
<v Speaker 1>There's no physical objects in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

3917
02:53:19.541 --> 02:53:21.640
<v Speaker 1>You've seen all this stuff happening in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

3918
02:53:21.960 --> 02:53:24.100
<v Speaker 1>in your visual field with your eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>closed,</v>

3919
02:53:24.400 --> 02:53:25.540
<v Speaker 1>but you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3920
02:53:25.660 --> 02:53:27.370
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing you reach out and grab.</v>

3921
02:53:27.370 --> 02:53:32.370
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I'm saying imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever you're doing when you're </v>

3922
02:53:32.370 --> 02:53:34.990
<v Speaker 1>doing that is real and I don't know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that I don't know what the fuck is</v>

3923
02:53:34.991 --> 02:53:36.670
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's real.</v>

3924
02:53:37.130 --> 02:53:38.590
<v Speaker 1>Do we're out of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

3925
02:53:38.630 --> 02:53:40.650
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Really appreciate it.</v>

3927
02:53:42.671 --> 02:53:47.671

<v Speaker 1>get a unique insight into your creative </v>

3928
02:53:47.671 --> 02:53:51.121
<v Speaker 1>process and that was really powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the shit that you shared about your </v>

<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
