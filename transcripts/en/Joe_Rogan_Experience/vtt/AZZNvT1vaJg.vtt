<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

5
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:13.620

7
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:17.634
<v Speaker 1>Thanks Mr Lindsay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good to James or Jim depending upon </v>

8
00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:21.000
<v Speaker 1>preferences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

9
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Go with Jim a jet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all gentlemen.</v>

10
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:25.980
<v Speaker 1>And there was one other person that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>did this with.</v>

11
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>This whole project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Helen pluck rose from England.</v>

12
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.130
<v Speaker 1>A shout out to Helen from England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She back across the pond,</v>

13
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's across the pond.</v>

14
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Fish and chips and she's making tea and </v>
<v Speaker 1>managerial magazine.</v>

15
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.110
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excellent.</v>

16
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well shout out to her as well.</v>

17
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.533
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's explain what you guys did and </v>

18
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:49.521
<v Speaker 1>what's so significant about it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first read it,</v>

19
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.550
<v Speaker 1>my first inclination that I had two </v>
<v Speaker 1>reactions.</v>

20
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:54.384
<v Speaker 1>One was a huge laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I laughed really hard and then I said </v>

21
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:01.470
<v Speaker 1>thank God so many exposed this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

22
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.800
<v Speaker 1>So tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me what you guys do over.</v>

23
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Let's explain who you guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do.</v>

24
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.263
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

25
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my background is in mathematics.</v>

26
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.790
<v Speaker 2>I bailed out an academia in 2010 though </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I kind of see the writing on the</v>

27
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:17.904
<v Speaker 2>wall and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now I am a renegade gender scholar </v>

28
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 2>and I write nonsense about genitals.</v>

29
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.190
<v Speaker 1>That's primarily what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

30
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.400
<v Speaker 1>I manage a business at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I got to academia.</v>

31
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm uh,</v>

32
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.093
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I teach philosophy of Portland State </v>

33
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.200
<v Speaker 1>University and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>met Jim years ago,</v>

34
00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:37.034
<v Speaker 1>we collaborated and we've written a </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of things over the years and at </v>

35
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.240
<v Speaker 1>some point it just came to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had to do something about this.</v>

36
00:01:44.241 --> 00:01:48.140
<v Speaker 1>It was just too ridiculous and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>translating into the real world.</v>

37
00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:52.070
<v Speaker 1>And so we collaborated and here we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

38
00:01:52.071 --> 00:01:55.310
<v Speaker 1>let's explain what you did and what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

39
00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about,</v>

40
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.200
<v Speaker 1>what was ridiculous is there's many </v>
<v Speaker 1>fields of studies,</v>

41
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.113
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can get legitimate degrees in </v>

42
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.960
<v Speaker 1>that are absolutely preposterous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

43
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.170
<v Speaker 1>Literally filled with nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught by nonsense.</v>

44
00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:14.930
<v Speaker 1>People who live in these nonsense </v>
<v Speaker 1>bubbles,</v>

45
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.793
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they give these degrees and </v>

46
00:02:17.211 --> 00:02:21.350
<v Speaker 1>these people go out in the real world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they infect things.</v>

47
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.710
<v Speaker 1>They in their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ridiculousness infect certain,</v>

48
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.450
<v Speaker 1>particularly tech industry businesses </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you see it in King James.</v>

49
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's explained what you guys did.</v>

50
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we started about a year,</v>

51
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.560
<v Speaker 2>I guess a year and a half ago now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>last summer.</v>

52
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.663
<v Speaker 2>We started writing a bunch of academic </v>
<v Speaker 2>papers for the journals that represent </v>

53
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:42.834
<v Speaker 2>these fields and so everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>understands what an academic paper is </v>

54
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:45.864
<v Speaker 2>getting out of the gate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't like an op Ed that you dash </v>

55
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 2>off or like Washington Post or some </v>
<v Speaker 2>magazine or whatever.</v>

56
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.773
<v Speaker 2>This is a thing like academics work </v>
<v Speaker 2>their careers to write one or two of </v>

57
00:02:56.671 --> 00:02:59.200
<v Speaker 2>these a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're really hard to write.</v>

58
00:02:59.201 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 2>They're supposed to be hard to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>published.</v>

59
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.450
<v Speaker 2>So we were up 20 of them in 10 months </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

60
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 2>seven of those got accepted for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were actually published.</v>

61
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we got lost for more.</v>

62
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got busted and at least four more.</v>

63
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:16.594
<v Speaker 2>We're on track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe five or six more would've gotten </v>

64
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:19.054
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference between getting </v>

65
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:20.950
<v Speaker 2>accepted and getting published?</v>

66
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.783
<v Speaker 2>So the process with everything in </v>
<v Speaker 2>academia is really slow and a lot of </v>

67
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 2>people don't know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you send off this article,</v>

68
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.813
<v Speaker 2>the editor looks at it and the editor </v>
<v Speaker 2>either gives it the thumbs up or the </v>

69
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 2>thumbs down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they give it the thumbs up,</v>

70
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:32.884
<v Speaker 2>it goes off to peer reviewers and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>process takes months often as long as I </v>

71
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 2>mean would one paper that was eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>months under peer review.</v>

72
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.343
<v Speaker 2>So the reviewers look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they try to figure out if the arguments </v>

73
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:44.374
<v Speaker 2>are good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they try to figure out if the research </v>

74
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 2>is good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they evaluate that,</v>

75
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 2>they give extensive comments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they send it back to you,</v>

76
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 2>then you have to revise it according to </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they say.</v>

77
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 2>Make it better is what's supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

78
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 2>They made ours crazier and so then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

79
00:03:58.601 --> 00:03:59.434
<v Speaker 2>Every single time</v>

80
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 3>we took the feedback and made the papers</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the most extreme,</v>

81
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 2>most extreme things and so then you send</v>
<v Speaker 2>them back.</v>

82
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 2>So now you're probably three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four months in just the review process,</v>

83
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.200
<v Speaker 2>not to the writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which should also take months.</v>

84
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.513
<v Speaker 2>And then the editor will either send it </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to the reviewers to see if it was </v>

85
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:16.594
<v Speaker 2>good enough or they'll just evaluated </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves depending on where it stands </v>

86
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 2>and then they'll make a decision as to </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether or not to accept it or reject it</v>

87
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.440
<v Speaker 2>or ask for more revisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when they accept it,</v>

88
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.030
<v Speaker 2>that means the is ready to publish it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then the publishing process requires</v>

89
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:32.770
<v Speaker 2>all the typesetting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>proofing,</v>

90
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 2>all the stuff that goes into making it </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional for an academic journal.</v>

91
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.500
<v Speaker 2>And that can take months</v>

92
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

93
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 3>and publishing is the coin of the realm </v>
<v Speaker 3>like fats it.</v>

94
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.640
<v Speaker 3>So the ideal is one paper every year in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the humanities probably.</v>

95
00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:49.360
<v Speaker 3>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how you credential yourself.</v>

96
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 3>That's how you get tenure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a job for life.</v>

97
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 3>That's how you get to teach people these</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas who then,</v>

98
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 3>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go out into the workforce,</v>

99
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

100
00:04:57.161 --> 00:04:57.994
<v Speaker 3>six years later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in fact everybody with total </v>

101
00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:02.220
<v Speaker 3>silliness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

102
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.270
<v Speaker 3>it's the gold standard peer review.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we saw a tremendous problem.</v>

103
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 3>Can we tell people some of the titles of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these charter?</v>

104
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 3>Because right now they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell are these guys talking?</v>

105
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.263
<v Speaker 2>So we had a article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that got the most press was </v>

106
00:05:16.451 --> 00:05:18.310
<v Speaker 2>about dog humping and Portland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oregon.</v>

107
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.590
<v Speaker 2>It was called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did it go?</v>

108
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:25.210
<v Speaker 2>Was it called um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>queer performativity and uh,</v>

109
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.300
<v Speaker 2>was it rape culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rape culture?</v>

110
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.670
<v Speaker 2>We're performativity in dog parks in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Portland or.</v>

111
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.743
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we claim to have examined under a fake </v>

112
00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:35.640
<v Speaker 3>name is formativity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

113
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.230
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have their own lingo.</v>

114
00:05:37.231 --> 00:05:38.340
<v Speaker 3>Their own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

115
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.560
<v Speaker 3>But is that a word in the English </v>
<v Speaker 3>language before</v>

116
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.440
<v Speaker 2>activity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in the academic English language.</v>

117
00:05:43.441 --> 00:05:45.870
<v Speaker 2>Not In common parlance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's like the whole thing.</v>

118
00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:46.740
<v Speaker 2>This is huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

119
00:05:46.741 --> 00:05:49.040
<v Speaker 2>This goes back a long way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Judith Butler.</v>

120
00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:51.480
<v Speaker 2>His whole thing was that gender </v>
<v Speaker 2>different?</v>

121
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.383
<v Speaker 2>Butler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Judith Butler is probably the most </v>

122
00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:57.920
<v Speaker 2>influential feminist scholar there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gender scholar I should say,</v>

123
00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.340
<v Speaker 2>that that's been in maybe the last 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

124
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's big time.</v>

125
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.350
<v Speaker 2>And so she had this whole thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>gender is performative.</v>

126
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:07.184
<v Speaker 2>It's something you perform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not something that has anything to </v>

127
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:09.404
<v Speaker 2>do with your biology treated article.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reactions to rape culture in Queer </v>

128
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 2>performativity at urban dog parks in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Portland,</v>

129
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it retracted?</v>

130
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 2>Because it's because I realized bogus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're hosing them,</v>

131
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.890
<v Speaker 2>we reactions to rape culture and queer </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

132
00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:29.891
<v Speaker 2>We claim to have closely examined the </v>
<v Speaker 2>genitals of just under 10,000,</v>

133
00:06:29.921 --> 00:06:30.754
<v Speaker 2>210,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs and then interrogated their owners </v>

134
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:35.120
<v Speaker 2>as to their sexual orientation.</v>

135
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 2>So we checked out the dog's nuts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then said,</v>

136
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:38.660
<v Speaker 2>excuse me sir,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you gay?</v>

137
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.910
<v Speaker 2>And if they gendered their dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we made up these totally insane,</v>

138
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs humping incidents and how they,</v>

139
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.240
<v Speaker 2>they beat female dogs but they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>beat male dogs.</v>

140
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:54.770
<v Speaker 2>So that's one of the papers that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>made,</v>

141
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.990
<v Speaker 2>you know the other paper that will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will this one also,</v>

142
00:06:56.991 --> 00:07:00.800
<v Speaker 2>they had the whole thing like if a male </v>
<v Speaker 2>dog humps another male dog,</v>

143
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.960
<v Speaker 2>especially men would freak out and break</v>
<v Speaker 2>it up.</v>

144
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.780
<v Speaker 2>Stop that because that's the queer </v>
<v Speaker 2>performativity part.</v>

145
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.000
<v Speaker 2>But then if a male dog humped a female </v>
<v Speaker 2>dog,</v>

146
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:08.830
<v Speaker 2>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

147
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 2>get her girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get her,</v>

148
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:11.240
<v Speaker 2>get her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

149
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.073
<v Speaker 2>get on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're basically raging against Hetero </v>

150
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.330
<v Speaker 2>normativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly correct.</v>

151
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.193
<v Speaker 2>We told them exactly what they wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>hear and we gave them bogus statistics </v>

152
00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:23.480
<v Speaker 2>to fuel what they already wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe.</v>

153
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.383
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We started off with the idea that what </v>

154
00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:26.134
<v Speaker 2>we wanted to get to as a conclusion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then we made up all the crap in between </v>

155
00:07:28.671 --> 00:07:29.504
<v Speaker 2>to get to it and the conclusion was </v>
<v Speaker 2>feminism should train men the way we </v>

156
00:07:32.511 --> 00:07:34.490
<v Speaker 2>train dogs so that we can get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rape culture.</v>

157
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.900
<v Speaker 2>They'll put them on leashes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

158
00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:37.180
<v Speaker 2>it's right in the paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all there.</v>

159
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.200
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately we cannot put them in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Aleisha.</v>

160
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.540
<v Speaker 2>It's not politically feasible to put men</v>
<v Speaker 2>on leashes.</v>

161
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:42.583
<v Speaker 2>You guys wrote that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had told their leashes when they </v>

162
00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:47.960
<v Speaker 2>misbehave in this paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't just get published.</v>

163
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.830
<v Speaker 2>The Journal said that this was exemplary</v>
<v Speaker 2>scholarship and gave it an award.</v>

164
00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:01.850
<v Speaker 2>So it was one of the best pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This year is their 25th anniversary.</v>

165
00:08:02.001 --> 00:08:02.834
<v Speaker 2>So this journal's has been doing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>for 25 years and it's their 25th </v>

166
00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:07.670
<v Speaker 2>anniversary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're picking out the best papers.</v>

167
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.150
<v Speaker 2>So pull year and putting them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

168
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.023
<v Speaker 2>pride of place in some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some issue of the journal and ours was </v>

169
00:08:13.731 --> 00:08:16.820
<v Speaker 2>going to be in the seventh issue was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>number one is greater,</v>

170
00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:20.060
<v Speaker 2>it's not great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it either is greater,</v>

171
00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:24.380
<v Speaker 2>it's not great like why they retracting </v>
<v Speaker 2>it because they know we were bogus.</v>

172
00:08:24.381 --> 00:08:29.381
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a broken clock.</v>

173
00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.810
<v Speaker 2>The clock is broken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is actually 12:00.</v>

174
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:37.790
<v Speaker 2>So they would claim it's incorrectly </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we fabricated statistics but we,</v>

175
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.690
<v Speaker 2>we wrote other paper's called one was </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat bodybuilding,</v>

176
00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:42.524
<v Speaker 2>so that claim that there should be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>category introducing traditional body </v>

177
00:08:45.831 --> 00:08:46.664
<v Speaker 2>building called fat body bodybuilding </v>
<v Speaker 2>where people come and display their fat </v>

178
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:50.773
<v Speaker 2>before the audience and we didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing and statistics for that </v>

179
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:54.590
<v Speaker 2>and they love that.</v>

180
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:55.540
<v Speaker 2>They thought it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

181
00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.560
<v Speaker 2>one line in that paper was a fat body is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a built body of the reviewers.</v>

182
00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Like I wholeheartedly agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>

183
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:06.643
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we wrote other papers like to </v>

184
00:09:08.491 --> 00:09:10.770
<v Speaker 2>Hypatia we published a paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got accepted,</v>

185
00:09:10.771 --> 00:09:11.604
<v Speaker 2>not published,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that one we claim that it's </v>

186
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.630
<v Speaker 2>unacceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's honestly,</v>

187
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:19.590
<v Speaker 2>it's unethical to make fun of anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with social justice.</v>

188
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.380
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you want to make fun of things</v>

189
00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:23.940
<v Speaker 2>that don't have anything with social </v>
<v Speaker 2>justice,</v>

190
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:26.400
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we wanted to make fun of men,</v>

191
00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:28.230
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to make fun of white people,</v>

192
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:29.064
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to make fun of anything to </v>

193
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:32.670
<v Speaker 2>do with social justice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem.</v>

194
00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:33.504
<v Speaker 2>So we made was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We said that South Park is a huge </v>

195
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:37.620
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The simpsons is a huge problem.</v>

196
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:38.993
<v Speaker 2>We went into talking about how Stephen </v>
<v Speaker 2>Colbert and Jon Stewart have the right </v>

197
00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:44.400
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the journal was like,</v>

198
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.940
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're straight white male.</v>

199
00:09:45.941 --> 00:09:46.774
<v Speaker 2>So you have to nuance around that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it clear that their position is </v>

200
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.680
<v Speaker 2>white men even though they're on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>side of social justice,</v>

201
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.040
<v Speaker 2>it's not quite good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

202
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.280
<v Speaker 2>So they publish that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They published that,</v>

203
00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:59.410
<v Speaker 2>they published that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that.</v>

204
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.313
<v Speaker 2>What was that one called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one was called when the joke's on </v>

205
00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:06.210
<v Speaker 2>you and we made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wrote it.</v>

206
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.630
<v Speaker 2>They would think the joke is on us </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we cited our own work in there,</v>

207
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.390
<v Speaker 2>but the joke was actually on them for </v>
<v Speaker 2>publishing it.</v>

208
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

209
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.440
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

210
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:16.953
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny how racist you can be as </v>

211
00:10:19.851 --> 00:10:21.560
<v Speaker 1>long as you're racist against white </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

212
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:22.403
<v Speaker 2>That's what we saw is that as long as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are going up the river against </v>

213
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:26.874
<v Speaker 2>privileged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can really just get away with </v>

214
00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:29.034
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>

215
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.650
<v Speaker 1>And you could generalize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

216
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:36.420
<v Speaker 1>totally gross generalizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not treat people as individuals.</v>

217
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>

218
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.520
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange that this is the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

219
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I was a kid in San Francisco in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>

220
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lived in,</v>

221
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like was the hippie times and that's,</v>

222
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.043
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived there from age seven to 11 and </v>

223
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.160
<v Speaker 1>it kind of formed a lot of my opinions </v>
<v Speaker 1>about people like that who gives a shit.</v>

224
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.840
<v Speaker 1>Part of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

225
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:05.370
<v Speaker 1>my appreciation for any group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

226
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:10.050
<v Speaker 1>whether it's race or gender or sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>orientation and I just,</v>

227
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.393
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand it from either way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly don't understand it from a </v>

228
00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:14.634
<v Speaker 1>racist perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really don't understand it from </v>

229
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:21.870
<v Speaker 1>racism that's condoned because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>racism against white people.</v>

230
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.470
<v Speaker 1>This is the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the.</v>

231
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.343
<v Speaker 1>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the people that are preaching </v>

232
00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:27.894
<v Speaker 1>against hate and these are the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that used to be the people that were </v>

233
00:11:30.811 --> 00:11:31.644
<v Speaker 1>supposedly so open minded and so open to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas and now they're trying to stifle </v>

234
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.770
<v Speaker 1>creativity and stifled dissent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stifle,</v>

235
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:46.010
<v Speaker 1>stifle anything that doesn't fit inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>that very narrow paradigm they're trying</v>

236
00:11:46.471 --> 00:11:47.880
<v Speaker 1>to push.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>

237
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.240
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they co opted the civil rights movement.</v>

238
00:11:50.241 --> 00:11:51.074
<v Speaker 2>The good name of the civil rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement is kind of the brand they ride </v>

239
00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:53.891
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

240
00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:56.920
<v Speaker 2>they're fighting against racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fighting against sexism,</v>

241
00:11:56.921 --> 00:11:58.060
<v Speaker 2>misogyny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

242
00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.403
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that's not really what's going on </v>

243
00:12:00.971 --> 00:12:04.120
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've actually tapped into this to,</v>

244
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.013
<v Speaker 2>to throw around the term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this postmodern notion that everything </v>

245
00:12:07.631 --> 00:12:08.464
<v Speaker 2>in society has to do with power dynamics</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the power dynamics have to be </v>

246
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.913
<v Speaker 2>understood in terms of groups and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>those groups have traditionally held </v>

247
00:12:14.231 --> 00:12:15.064
<v Speaker 2>power and exercise power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so immediately it becomes stuck in </v>

248
00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:22.120
<v Speaker 2>this idea that it's all about this group</v>
<v Speaker 2>or that group and how they relate to one</v>

249
00:12:22.121 --> 00:12:23.320
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean like,</v>

250
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:24.530
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get along relate.</v>

251
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.373
<v Speaker 2>I mean like white people are imagined to</v>
<v Speaker 2>always be over black people and </v>

252
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.580
<v Speaker 2>therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

253
00:12:30.581 --> 00:12:32.770
<v Speaker 2>there's always as natural power dynamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

254
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of oppressor versus oppressed.</v>

255
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.003
<v Speaker 2>And this is stuff that came straight out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this weird postmodern philosophy </v>

256
00:12:38.261 --> 00:12:42.910
<v Speaker 2>where you said he's dissatisfied French </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophers in the sixties,</v>

257
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all one,</v>

258
00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:44.824
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff you were talking about </v>

259
00:12:45.401 --> 00:12:47.250
<v Speaker 2>was going down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

260
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.660
<v Speaker 2>they saw this stuff and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

261
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:50.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

262
00:12:50.891 --> 00:12:55.480
<v Speaker 2>power dynamics or the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I should go back a step.</v>

263
00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:56.323
<v Speaker 2>The postmodern philosophers like food co</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of this got all hooked up on </v>

264
00:12:58.571 --> 00:12:59.404
<v Speaker 2>power because they were too satisfied </v>
<v Speaker 2>with seeing what they called grand </v>

265
00:13:01.631 --> 00:13:03.070
<v Speaker 2>narratives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity,</v>

266
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.070
<v Speaker 2>capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marxism,</v>

267
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.930
<v Speaker 2>they saw all these huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

268
00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:10.720
<v Speaker 2>explanations for how the world works and</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

269
00:13:10.721 --> 00:13:11.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not working.</v>

270
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Look how bad communism failed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look how there's so much bullshit coming</v>

271
00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:19.120
<v Speaker 2>out of this or that from religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not working,</v>

272
00:13:19.121 --> 00:13:21.790
<v Speaker 2>we need to just get rid of all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to deconstruct this,</v>

273
00:13:21.791 --> 00:13:24.310
<v Speaker 2>we're going to break it down to its </v>
<v Speaker 2>power dynamics,</v>

274
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:25.383
<v Speaker 2>and then we're going to look at it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of who has master hood over over </v>

275
00:13:29.321 --> 00:13:30.640
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's oppressing what,</v>

276
00:13:30.641 --> 00:13:32.860
<v Speaker 2>whereas dominance and it's just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>grown.</v>

277
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.693
<v Speaker 2>It got picked up in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the academic culture in the 19 </v>

278
00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:37.900
<v Speaker 2>sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how old this stuff is,</v>

279
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.093
<v Speaker 2>and then it took this huge turn in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>19 nineties and get really vicious and </v>

280
00:13:42.251 --> 00:13:43.290
<v Speaker 2>that's where it really got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

281
00:13:43.291 --> 00:13:44.890
<v Speaker 2>that's when it turned intersectional </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

282
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.470
<v Speaker 2>That was during the political correct </v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

283
00:13:47.471 --> 00:13:48.304
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when the political correct thing </v>

284
00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:50.290
<v Speaker 2>kind of blew up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

285
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.900
<v Speaker 2>When all this stuff was coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that would have been late.</v>

286
00:13:52.901 --> 00:13:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen eighties is really when all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this political correctness stuff started</v>

287
00:13:57.401 --> 00:13:58.234
<v Speaker 2>coming out at the academy and then a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>years later you see it coming all over </v>

288
00:14:00.401 --> 00:14:02.460
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which typically what happens,</v>

289
00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.313
<v Speaker 2>it starts in the academy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A few years later it leaks into the </v>

290
00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:08.530
<v Speaker 2>culture and politics or media or detect </v>
<v Speaker 2>sector.</v>

291
00:14:08.531 --> 00:14:10.060
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it happens to be,</v>

292
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:14.350
<v Speaker 2>the stifling of creativity is the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>disturbing part about it like this,</v>

293
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:18.910
<v Speaker 2>the agreement that South Park and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>simpsons are a real problem.</v>

294
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.610
<v Speaker 2>It's so bizarre because here's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

295
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.040
<v Speaker 2>if they miss the mark and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>funny,</v>

296
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.730
<v Speaker 2>it won't work and then it'll be a bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>show and no one would like it,</v>

297
00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:28.683
<v Speaker 2>but if it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there has to be something about it that </v>

298
00:14:31.661 --> 00:14:34.330
<v Speaker 2>people find ironic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>satirical.</v>

299
00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.910
<v Speaker 2>There has to be something about it that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are enjoying.</v>

300
00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.073
<v Speaker 2>It has to point to some truth and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>denial of this and instead like to </v>

301
00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:42.191
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

302
00:14:42.191 --> 00:14:46.480
<v Speaker 2>it's white males that are causing this </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem and you shouldn't attack this or</v>

303
00:14:46.481 --> 00:14:47.314
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the subjects that are off limits and </v>

304
00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:52.090
<v Speaker 2>social justice should never be attacked </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the</v>

305
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.950
<v Speaker 1>to agree to that it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>

306
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.050
<v Speaker 1>It's so preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is life.</v>

307
00:14:57.051 --> 00:15:00.140
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is literally a nuance of life.</v>

308
00:15:00.141 --> 00:15:00.974
<v Speaker 1>All the various strange things in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectrum of human behavior and and all </v>

309
00:15:06.051 --> 00:15:06.884
<v Speaker 1>the things that you encounter in life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to segment and limit what is and is </v>

310
00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:15.800
<v Speaker 1>not what's off limits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not off limits based on race,</v>

311
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.520
<v Speaker 1>based on things that a person can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>control at all.</v>

312
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.040
<v Speaker 1>You're just born white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're born white,</v>

313
00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.670
<v Speaker 1>you're born and oppressor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're victimizer,</v>

314
00:15:25.671 --> 00:15:26.504
<v Speaker 1>and if you're a white male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking piece of shit and you </v>

315
00:15:28.701 --> 00:15:30.800
<v Speaker 1>can say that white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hetero male in particular.</v>

316
00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

317
00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:33.164
<v Speaker 1>I've seen so many tweets from people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that mean so many virtue signaling </v>

318
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:37.723
<v Speaker 1>tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of my favorite ones is this </v>

319
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.610
<v Speaker 1>feminist who said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all white,</v>

320
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:45.320
<v Speaker 1>a white straight men are trash unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>proven otherwise.</v>

321
00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:49.370
<v Speaker 1>The thing right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of us,</v>

322
00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:54.580
<v Speaker 1>all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 million of us have been give or take.</v>

323
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.400
<v Speaker 1>You know how many gay folks there are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trash,</v>

324
00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:59.720
<v Speaker 1>trash,</v>

325
00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:00.880
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Proven.</v>

326
00:16:00.881 --> 00:16:02.710
<v Speaker 2>It's proven otherwise improve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not right.</v>

327
00:16:02.711 --> 00:16:04.510
<v Speaker 2>How do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lie.</v>

328
00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.850
<v Speaker 2>You have to be an outlaw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know where they asked us to problematize</v>

329
00:16:06.851 --> 00:16:08.680
<v Speaker 2>allyship too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see there's power dynamics.</v>

330
00:16:08.681 --> 00:16:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Once you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

331
00:16:09.671 --> 00:16:12.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm an ally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you've made it so that you have like</v>

332
00:16:12.191 --> 00:16:13.024
<v Speaker 2>a shield where people can call you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>white supremacist anymore and you are </v>

333
00:16:16.751 --> 00:16:20.080
<v Speaker 2>acting on behalf of other people in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking for them,</v>

334
00:16:20.081 --> 00:16:23.770
<v Speaker 2>so you now have assumed power that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>reproducing the same power dynamics.</v>

335
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:28.780
<v Speaker 2>That was my mind comp per paper that </v>
<v Speaker 2>rewrote my income was about allyship and</v>

336
00:16:28.781 --> 00:16:29.130
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

337
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.070
<v Speaker 1>you didn't prevalent allyship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

338
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.940
<v Speaker 1>we had two of them that did mountain </v>
<v Speaker 1>comp.</v>

339
00:16:32.941 --> 00:16:33.774
<v Speaker 1>One of them we just more or less </v>
<v Speaker 1>replaced whites would replace Jews with </v>

340
00:16:37.381 --> 00:16:41.620
<v Speaker 1>white men and you literally took mine </v>
<v Speaker 1>comp.</v>

341
00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:42.563
<v Speaker 1>The actual words from mind calm and put </v>
<v Speaker 1>it in this paper and replaced the word </v>

342
00:16:46.711 --> 00:16:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Jews with the word white men and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>accepted it.</v>

343
00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:50.453
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had two papers that did mind </v>

344
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:52.413
<v Speaker 1>comprehend so that one did not get </v>
<v Speaker 1>accepted with the quotes that you guys </v>

345
00:16:56.251 --> 00:16:57.084
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

346
00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:58.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that one was.</v>

347
00:16:58.650 --> 00:16:59.483
<v Speaker 2>What we did was we took the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>document on online and we just searched </v>

348
00:17:03.561 --> 00:17:06.720
<v Speaker 2>the word Jew and we just started picking</v>
<v Speaker 2>sentences and paragraphs.</v>

349
00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:10.410
<v Speaker 2>So what was it that at the end it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>

350
00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:11.453
<v Speaker 2>if we don't combat whiteness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be the funeral wreath for </v>

351
00:17:13.621 --> 00:17:16.700
<v Speaker 2>mankind that's grayed out now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't.</v>

352
00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:18.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't.</v>

353
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.640
<v Speaker 2>They didn't accept that paper though </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that paper,</v>

354
00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:21.563
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turns out was written from the </v>

355
00:17:22.561 --> 00:17:25.620
<v Speaker 2>perspective of a white lesbian who hated</v>
<v Speaker 2>her own whiteness.</v>

356
00:17:25.621 --> 00:17:26.454
<v Speaker 2>And they said that it was positioning </v>
<v Speaker 2>her as a good white and because she's </v>

357
00:17:28.741 --> 00:17:29.574
<v Speaker 2>making herself out as a good way again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allyship isn't all it's cracked up to </v>

358
00:17:32.701 --> 00:17:34.950
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was making a problem.</v>

359
00:17:34.951 --> 00:17:39.030
<v Speaker 2>She should have really been forwarding </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ideas of the black scholars that she</v>

360
00:17:39.031 --> 00:17:41.790
<v Speaker 2>read way more and not talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>herself so much,</v>

361
00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.340
<v Speaker 2>even though it was a paper designed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be talking about yourself,</v>

362
00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:44.760
<v Speaker 2>which</v>

363
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.530
<v Speaker 1>what Hitler did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we had to do.</v>

364
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Now the other mind</v>

365
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.640
<v Speaker 2>comp paper was about feminism and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we did was he took the chapter,</v>

366
00:17:53.641 --> 00:17:55.860
<v Speaker 2>it's chapter 12.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We took the chapter where he says,</v>

367
00:17:55.861 --> 00:17:59.520
<v Speaker 2>this is why we should have the Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 2>party and what is expected of people who</v>

368
00:17:59.521 --> 00:18:02.460
<v Speaker 2>are going to be part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we took out our movement,</v>

369
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.333
<v Speaker 2>our party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't call it a Nazi party in the </v>

370
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:05.611
<v Speaker 2>chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everywhere.</v>

371
00:18:05.611 --> 00:18:07.440
<v Speaker 2>He's like our movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Took that out,</v>

372
00:18:07.441 --> 00:18:08.274
<v Speaker 2>put in intersectional feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then modified the words and added </v>

373
00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:15.390
<v Speaker 2>theory around it so that it would fly </v>
<v Speaker 2>and theory.</v>

374
00:18:15.391 --> 00:18:17.610
<v Speaker 2>That's what they call it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that word theory.</v>

375
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.640
<v Speaker 2>I love when feminist theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love when they throw that around,</v>

376
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:22.320
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you saying?</v>

377
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.790
<v Speaker 2>But you're saying things that like once </v>
<v Speaker 2>you say that you're,</v>

378
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.430
<v Speaker 2>you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you've said,</v>

379
00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.240
<v Speaker 2>you can say something ridiculous and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then say feminist theory.</v>

380
00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.231
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

381
00:18:31.231 --> 00:18:32.430
<v Speaker 2>it's in feminist theory.</v>

382
00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.361
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing,</v>

383
00:18:33.361 --> 00:18:34.194
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is so much of the stuff they come up </v>

384
00:18:34.741 --> 00:18:36.120
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me throw him an olive branch,</v>

385
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.280
<v Speaker 2>like so much of the stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come up with a creative idea.</v>

386
00:18:38.281 --> 00:18:39.960
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's something to some of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

387
00:18:39.961 --> 00:18:40.794
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what they're putting forward as </v>

388
00:18:41.851 --> 00:18:42.684
<v Speaker 2>hypotheses and then they're treating </v>
<v Speaker 2>them as conclusions so they're putting </v>

389
00:18:45.271 --> 00:18:47.370
<v Speaker 2>forward this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw one on twitter today.</v>

390
00:18:47.371 --> 00:18:49.320
<v Speaker 2>It was something like there's about </v>
<v Speaker 2>South Park,</v>

391
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:53.040
<v Speaker 2>how it's been laundering racism into </v>
<v Speaker 2>society and making everybody comfortable</v>

392
00:18:53.041 --> 00:18:53.874
<v Speaker 2>with racism and that's why everything is</v>
<v Speaker 2>so racist and people are shooting Jews </v>

393
00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:57.594
<v Speaker 2>is because south park made it normal </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're treating that as a </v>

394
00:19:00.901 --> 00:19:02.220
<v Speaker 2>conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a hypothesis,</v>

395
00:19:02.221 --> 00:19:03.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we could test that.</v>

396
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:04.913
<v Speaker 2>It's conceivable that you could actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to parse out what variables need to </v>

397
00:19:08.371 --> 00:19:09.930
<v Speaker 2>be controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

398
00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:10.813
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>South Park came out and started doing </v>

399
00:19:11.761 --> 00:19:12.390
<v Speaker 2>these themes.</v>

400
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.100
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does it track?</v>

401
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.650
<v Speaker 2>Statisticians can do kind of amazing </v>
<v Speaker 2>things with that stuff,</v>

402
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.280
<v Speaker 2>but they're not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not testing it and testing it.</v>

403
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.110
<v Speaker 2>They're concluding it and they're using </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory to do so and they're going,</v>

404
00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:24.691
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

405
00:19:24.691 --> 00:19:25.524
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's even bigger than that because why </v>

406
00:19:26.611 --> 00:19:27.421
<v Speaker 2>don't they test it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

407
00:19:27.421 --> 00:19:29.220
<v Speaker 2>if they tested it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is,</v>

408
00:19:29.221 --> 00:19:30.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making this shit up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't believe me,</v>

409
00:19:30.871 --> 00:19:31.704
<v Speaker 2>but this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they tested it in the test showed </v>

410
00:19:33.331 --> 00:19:36.810
<v Speaker 2>that their hypothesis was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would say that the test was racist,</v>

411
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:37.913
<v Speaker 2>but the test is condoning racism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why it didn't give them the </v>

412
00:19:39.691 --> 00:19:41.850
<v Speaker 2>desired result.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would you test something,</v>

413
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.700
<v Speaker 2>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a statistician,</v>

414
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.830
<v Speaker 2>I actually am a mathematician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not a statistician.</v>

415
00:19:46.831 --> 00:19:47.664
<v Speaker 2>They're two different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not exactly sure how you would </v>

416
00:19:49.501 --> 00:19:52.080
<v Speaker 2>test that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but conceivably you could gather data,</v>

417
00:19:52.081 --> 00:19:54.780
<v Speaker 2>survey data and see how attitudes have </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed.</v>

418
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you could track those kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>articles,</v>

419
00:19:57.031 --> 00:19:57.864
<v Speaker 2>kinds of events that are coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could kind of pair that up with </v>

420
00:20:00.751 --> 00:20:01.584
<v Speaker 2>what's been shown on south park who </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't self park and track that with </v>

421
00:20:04.111 --> 00:20:06.750
<v Speaker 2>attitudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no effort to do this.</v>

422
00:20:06.751 --> 00:20:07.381
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

423
00:20:07.381 --> 00:20:08.214
<v Speaker 2>South Park presents these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they then cherry pick because </v>

424
00:20:10.051 --> 00:20:13.200
<v Speaker 2>there's other ideas that they don't talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about their point the other direction.</v>

425
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.920
<v Speaker 2>These ideas are problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the big word.</v>

426
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.750
<v Speaker 2>Theoretically that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

427
00:20:18.751 --> 00:20:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not joking,</v>

428
00:20:19.921 --> 00:20:23.610
<v Speaker 2>they literally believed that use of </v>
<v Speaker 2>language creates the power dynamics that</v>

429
00:20:23.611 --> 00:20:24.444
<v Speaker 2>defined society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So South Park's using language and </v>

430
00:20:26.551 --> 00:20:30.720
<v Speaker 2>imagery that creates a power dynamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes people more comfortable being</v>

431
00:20:30.721 --> 00:20:32.520
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

432
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Theory done tests needed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No even attempt test.</v>

433
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:37.463
<v Speaker 2>Then if the test happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the test itself would be racist unless </v>

434
00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.530
<v Speaker 2>it confirmed the hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

435
00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:45.840
<v Speaker 2>so they start with an agenda and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned the word laundry,</v>

436
00:20:45.841 --> 00:20:47.770
<v Speaker 2>which could your former guests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heather,</v>

437
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.840
<v Speaker 2>talked about a ideal laundry.</v>

438
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:51.820
<v Speaker 2>I think that's important to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>listeners.</v>

439
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:54.880
<v Speaker 2>So what's really what's going on here </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

440
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're forwarding these hypotheses.</v>

441
00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.073
<v Speaker 2>They treat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't treat them as hypotheses and </v>

442
00:21:00.731 --> 00:21:04.750
<v Speaker 2>then they write up a paper paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we were saying is the absolute gold</v>

443
00:21:04.751 --> 00:21:07.990
<v Speaker 2>standard of academic work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They send the paper off.</v>

444
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:09.003
<v Speaker 2>The reviewers in our cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made our papers crazier every single </v>

445
00:21:11.531 --> 00:21:12.364
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they push it further into the </v>

446
00:21:13.211 --> 00:21:16.000
<v Speaker 2>ideology or the madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does the review or do something like</v>

447
00:21:16.001 --> 00:21:16.660
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

448
00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.730
<v Speaker 2>what input did they get to have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

449
00:21:18.731 --> 00:21:19.564
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we should problematize allyship if </v>

450
00:21:21.131 --> 00:21:22.450
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we want our paper published,</v>

451
00:21:22.451 --> 00:21:24.280
<v Speaker 2>we've got to problematize ally Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that word.</v>

452
00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:26.680
<v Speaker 2>Problematize everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

453
00:21:26.681 --> 00:21:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Problematize everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dog Parks problem.</v>

454
00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:32.800
<v Speaker 2>The problem with literally anything can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be problematized and looked at through a</v>

455
00:21:32.801 --> 00:21:35.380
<v Speaker 2>feminist lens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does everything.</v>

456
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.273
<v Speaker 2>Every tool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we called it grievance </v>

457
00:21:39.491 --> 00:21:39.850
<v Speaker 2>studies.</v>

458
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.910
<v Speaker 2>The grievance is they're massively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

459
00:21:42.911 --> 00:21:43.744
<v Speaker 2>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the do the Homo transphobia trans </v>

460
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.433
<v Speaker 2>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we wrote this paper saying that </v>

461
00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:50.673
<v Speaker 2>straight men are generally transphobic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning in particular the kind of niche </v>

462
00:21:55.571 --> 00:21:56.404
<v Speaker 2>weird definition that you see on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet and activist sometimes that </v>

463
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.960
<v Speaker 2>they aren't interested in having sex </v>
<v Speaker 2>with trans people who have penises,</v>

464
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.630
<v Speaker 2>trans women who have a penis in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular.</v>

465
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.270
<v Speaker 2>And so we said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's the kind of transphobia.</v>

466
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.193
<v Speaker 2>And clearly the reason that they might </v>
<v Speaker 2>be transphobic is because they don't </v>

467
00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:11.914
<v Speaker 2>practice putting things on their butts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they start putting stuff up their </v>

468
00:22:14.561 --> 00:22:16.990
<v Speaker 2>butts in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we call it the paper dildos.</v>

469
00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:17.883
<v Speaker 2>So you can imagine what we were saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>that she put up the paper was called </v>

470
00:22:20.111 --> 00:22:20.650
<v Speaker 2>Dildo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

471
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.060
<v Speaker 2>that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the nickname we gave it.</v>

472
00:22:22.061 --> 00:22:23.920
<v Speaker 2>The paper was called going into the back</v>
<v Speaker 2>door.</v>

473
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.150
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really go,</v>

474
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.033
<v Speaker 2>going in through the back door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of technical words that </v>

475
00:22:30.761 --> 00:22:34.990
<v Speaker 2>one get published published.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we argued that,</v>

476
00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:35.883
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if straight men just penetrated </v>

477
00:22:39.341 --> 00:22:42.820
<v Speaker 2>themselves and had their girlfriends </v>
<v Speaker 2>pegged them through exposure therapy,</v>

478
00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:43.654
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start small and then work your way </v>

479
00:22:44.501 --> 00:22:46.570
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can remediate transphobia.</v>

480
00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:47.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will make them less transphobic.</v>

481
00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:52.060
<v Speaker 2>So as a self penetrating or having your </v>
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend peg you,</v>

482
00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.940
<v Speaker 2>you can be less transphobic and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought this is great.</v>

483
00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:58.060
<v Speaker 2>So we base this off of off of eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>interviews.</v>

484
00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:02.080
<v Speaker 2>It really 13 interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with men and I say really a 13.</v>

485
00:23:02.081 --> 00:23:04.750
<v Speaker 2>There were 13 interviews documented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but five of them were gay people,</v>

486
00:23:04.751 --> 00:23:07.060
<v Speaker 2>not even straight people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they don't really apply.</v>

487
00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:09.550
<v Speaker 2>So then we have these eight interviews </v>
<v Speaker 2>with straight men.</v>

488
00:23:09.551 --> 00:23:10.384
<v Speaker 2>We made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them are conservative and he's </v>

489
00:23:11.831 --> 00:23:13.900
<v Speaker 2>just so we could just put in like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

490
00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:16.150
<v Speaker 2>crazy things that a conservative might </v>
<v Speaker 2>say about this.</v>

491
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.130
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't,</v>

492
00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:20.230
<v Speaker 2>why weren't there more conservatives </v>
<v Speaker 2>participating?</v>

493
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.220
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm going to run with this.</v>

494
00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:23.973
<v Speaker 2>I wrote this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We invited six conservatives to </v>

495
00:23:26.231 --> 00:23:27.064
<v Speaker 2>participate and only one accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to kind of summarize why in the </v>

496
00:23:31.481 --> 00:23:32.560
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is in the paper,</v>

497
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.830
<v Speaker 2>in the words of one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be a part of some stupid</v>

498
00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:37.930
<v Speaker 2>liberal study about shoving things up </v>
<v Speaker 2>your butt.</v>

499
00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:44.010
<v Speaker 2>And they published that in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

500
00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.200
<v Speaker 2>So we wrote this</v>

501
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:51.460
<v Speaker 1>retracted article going in through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back door right there.</v>

502
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now did they contact you after they were</v>

503
00:23:54.881 --> 00:23:56.240
<v Speaker 1>tracked your article and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

504
00:23:56.241 --> 00:23:59.210
<v Speaker 1>you guys are fucking assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're wasting our time.</v>

505
00:23:59.211 --> 00:24:00.044
<v Speaker 1>We spent hours reviewing your papers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got a couple of pretty bitter </v>

506
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.490
<v Speaker 1>responses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But mostly no.</v>

507
00:24:04.491 --> 00:24:05.324
<v Speaker 1>Mostly they've kind of put their head in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sand and kind of avoided talking to </v>

508
00:24:07.371 --> 00:24:08.204
<v Speaker 1>us that what I was saying before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show started that I read one article </v>

509
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:15.020
<v Speaker 1>that was really diminishing the impact </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what you guys have done.</v>

510
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Saying like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a big deal.</v>

511
00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.513
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to make it seem as if </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you guys had written was just a </v>

512
00:24:25.461 --> 00:24:27.500
<v Speaker 1>prank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what.</v>

513
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:28.980
<v Speaker 1>That's absolutely false.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

514
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.903
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of papers that seemed like</v>
<v Speaker 1>parody that make it through that you </v>

515
00:24:33.231 --> 00:24:34.280
<v Speaker 1>guys aren't writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

516
00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.550
<v Speaker 1>We could pull up one about how hot wings</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like there's a TV show,</v>

517
00:24:37.551 --> 00:24:39.530
<v Speaker 1>spicy ones or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About hot wings.</v>

518
00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:40.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

519
00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.830
<v Speaker 1>The Youtube show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

520
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:44.600
<v Speaker 1>So they had a whole one's hot one's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>

521
00:24:44.601 --> 00:24:45.640
<v Speaker 1>They had a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

522
00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:49.910
<v Speaker 1>there is a paper out there about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>show and it's all about how,</v>

523
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.943
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hot sauce has everything to do with </v>

524
00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:52.844
<v Speaker 1>masculinity and being manly and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have enough women on the show </v>

525
00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:58.070
<v Speaker 1>because it's sexist in the hot hot </v>
<v Speaker 1>sauce,</v>

526
00:24:58.071 --> 00:25:01.370
<v Speaker 1>I think was a sexist part and it has all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these bizarre concluded.</v>

527
00:25:01.371 --> 00:25:03.650
<v Speaker 1>We cited that in the paper we wrote </v>
<v Speaker 1>about hooters.</v>

528
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:04.843
<v Speaker 1>We're putting in the part that </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculinity contests of eating the hot </v>

529
00:25:07.341 --> 00:25:09.320
<v Speaker 1>wings who can eat more hot wings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they say,</v>

530
00:25:09.321 --> 00:25:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ate 20 hot wings.</v>

531
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Ask out the hooters girl and eating show</v>
<v Speaker 1>hot ones is problematic.</v>

532
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an ally,</v>

533
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.130
<v Speaker 1>but that's a real paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

534
00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.590
<v Speaker 1>So we cited that paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>

535
00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:27.220
<v Speaker 1>There are thousands of papers like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacular food,</v>

536
00:25:27.501 --> 00:25:31.400
<v Speaker 1>gender and celebrity on hot ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as a professor,</v>

537
00:25:31.401 --> 00:25:33.710
<v Speaker 1>he probably teaches this stuff to </v>
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>

538
00:25:33.711 --> 00:25:34.544
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now everything's problematized and </v>

539
00:25:36.321 --> 00:25:39.290
<v Speaker 1>this is what credentials him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get seven in general,</v>

540
00:25:39.291 --> 00:25:43.610
<v Speaker 1>you get the says it's a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Years ago she wrote it,</v>

541
00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:45.470
<v Speaker 1>but who's the other one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tisha,</v>

542
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.670
<v Speaker 1>at the end who wrote that introduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

543
00:25:49.671 --> 00:25:51.320
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two people there.</v>

544
00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:52.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a commentary.</v>

545
00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it an article about the article?</v>

546
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably what's going on.</v>

547
00:25:56.691 --> 00:26:00.020
<v Speaker 1>His commentary and criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

548
00:26:00.021 --> 00:26:01.010
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like.</v>

549
00:26:01.011 --> 00:26:02.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't read this specifically,</v>

550
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.520
<v Speaker 1>but wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to the first statement.</v>

551
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:05.773
<v Speaker 1>Food media have been recognized as </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural artifacts that referenced </v>

552
00:26:08.471 --> 00:26:11.540
<v Speaker 1>culturally and historically specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideals of gender,</v>

553
00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:12.883
<v Speaker 1>drawing on the simultaneously mundane </v>
<v Speaker 1>and omd food as a medium for </v>

554
00:26:19.761 --> 00:26:20.594
<v Speaker 1>interrogating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interrogating ideas about feminism and </v>

555
00:26:23.691 --> 00:26:24.590
<v Speaker 1>identity performance.</v>

556
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.320
<v Speaker 1>What I was telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck man.</v>

557
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:32.040
<v Speaker 1>This is like everything we talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is such unbelievable horseshit.</v>

558
00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:32.953
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person is teaching at Central </v>

559
00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Michigan University.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

560
00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is for real.</v>

561
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:41.480
<v Speaker 1>This is real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there is now a,</v>

562
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.240
<v Speaker 1>an ever expanding group of these folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They teach.</v>

563
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to read more of it as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't find this and criticism section,</v>

564
00:26:50.671 --> 00:26:51.504
<v Speaker 1>the author's introduced a diverse sample</v>
<v Speaker 1>of case studies that demonstrate the </v>

565
00:26:54.421 --> 00:26:59.070
<v Speaker 1>emergence of feminist ideas in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>through food media.</v>

566
00:26:59.071 --> 00:27:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

567
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Are you worried about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting a job,</v>

568
00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:08.070
<v Speaker 1>a real job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go out there and work,</v>

569
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:13.160
<v Speaker 1>do something that someone wants to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>for something of value,</v>

570
00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:18.120
<v Speaker 1>engagement with hot sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so crazy and this is what they're</v>

571
00:27:18.121 --> 00:27:18.954
<v Speaker 1>teaching our kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Racial assumptions inherent to post </v>

572
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.150
<v Speaker 1>feminist food culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

573
00:27:24.151 --> 00:27:27.000
<v Speaker 1>I was going to write a paper about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>cornbread is being gentrified and that's</v>

574
00:27:27.001 --> 00:27:27.834
<v Speaker 1>why I will never get over racism because</v>
<v Speaker 1>white people are making like pumpkin </v>

575
00:27:29.701 --> 00:27:30.534
<v Speaker 1>spice cornbread.</v>

576
00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:31.643
<v Speaker 1>Just something that I tweeted the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>day about some what Gad sad tweeted it </v>

577
00:27:36.601 --> 00:27:41.601
<v Speaker 1>and I retweeted it about some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some woman was taking back bone broth.</v>

578
00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:43.110
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

579
00:27:43.111 --> 00:27:45.330
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What in the fuck are you talking about?</v>

580
00:27:45.331 --> 00:27:49.950
<v Speaker 1>People cooking bone broth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands and thousands of years getting</v>

581
00:27:49.951 --> 00:27:53.130
<v Speaker 1>nutrients from the food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You problematized it.</v>

582
00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Queer woman of color wants to decolonize</v>

583
00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.220
<v Speaker 1>bone broth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop appropriating my culture.</v>

584
00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Gad said he's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is so fucking preposterous.</v>

585
00:28:07.591 --> 00:28:09.960
<v Speaker 1>A queer woman of color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm saying man,</v>

586
00:28:09.961 --> 00:28:12.410
<v Speaker 1>there's a thousand papers like this out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there for everyone.</v>

587
00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:15.420
<v Speaker 1>We wrote a thousand of them that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might as well written.</v>

588
00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't tell if we did or didn't.</v>

589
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.313
<v Speaker 1>That's part of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People can't differentiate what we've </v>

590
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.391
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

591
00:28:21.391 --> 00:28:22.224
<v Speaker 1>not only can they not differentiated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give us an award so they can't </v>

592
00:28:24.601 --> 00:28:25.434
<v Speaker 1>differentiate it from the stuff that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>already out there and there's stuff </v>

593
00:28:28.171 --> 00:28:30.060
<v Speaker 1>that's already out there as polluting </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's minds.</v>

594
00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:33.270
<v Speaker 1>You guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>

595
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.240
<v Speaker 1>at least you used to work in academia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you work in academia.</v>

596
00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:37.470
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

597
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.030
<v Speaker 1>how were your peers treating this?</v>

598
00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:42.460
<v Speaker 2>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

599
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:44.360
<v Speaker 2>Pete has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to have a lot to say about that</v>

600
00:28:44.361 --> 00:28:45.710
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for me,</v>

601
00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:48.590
<v Speaker 2>I've had two from academic people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had two kinds of responses,</v>

602
00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.020
<v Speaker 2>but the overwhelming uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some of those are like,</v>

603
00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.160
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys.</v>

604
00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:53.043
<v Speaker 2>And then the overwhelming of them are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing over and over and over </v>

605
00:28:55.131 --> 00:28:56.870
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean a lot of people.</v>

606
00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Thank you so much for doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't,</v>

607
00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:02.420
<v Speaker 2>don't tell anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to get a job.</v>

608
00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:04.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm up for tenure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't talk about.</v>

609
00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This needs to go and that's everywhere.</v>

610
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:08.143
<v Speaker 2>It's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't proceed through academia now </v>

611
00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.790
<v Speaker 2>unless you bow to this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ten years sounds like tyranny.</v>

612
00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:18.110
<v Speaker 2>It did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing sounds preposterous.</v>

613
00:29:18.111 --> 00:29:19.640
<v Speaker 2>That you can keep a job for life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

614
00:29:19.641 --> 00:29:20.474
<v Speaker 2>the idea was supposed to be that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>work your ass off for a few years and </v>

615
00:29:22.941 --> 00:29:24.860
<v Speaker 2>then you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was supposed to be to defend academic</v>

616
00:29:24.861 --> 00:29:25.694
<v Speaker 2>freedom so you get tenure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can go forth and put out some </v>

617
00:29:28.491 --> 00:29:31.550
<v Speaker 2>crazy ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really like dig into some stuff and they</v>

618
00:29:31.551 --> 00:29:32.384
<v Speaker 2>can't fire you for coming up with weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff and then people would argue about </v>

619
00:29:36.591 --> 00:29:37.424
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now it's kind of become the </v>

620
00:29:38.181 --> 00:29:40.970
<v Speaker 2>situation where people get into this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get in their job,</v>

621
00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:42.220
<v Speaker 2>then you can't get rid of them.</v>

622
00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:43.100
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

623
00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:46.460
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is there a way to fire people?</v>

624
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:47.633
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they do something like sexual </v>

625
00:29:48.381 --> 00:29:52.340
<v Speaker 3>harassment and usually you can find a </v>
<v Speaker 3>way around the tenure thing.</v>

626
00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:53.683
<v Speaker 3>So what is it like for you now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are actually super uncomfortable or </v>

627
00:29:58.041 --> 00:30:01.040
<v Speaker 3>people upset at you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say they were enraged.</v>

628
00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:04.283
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only,</v>

629
00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:05.443
<v Speaker 3>the only thing I can think of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like if you taught at a Christian </v>

630
00:30:07.431 --> 00:30:08.264
<v Speaker 3>school and then you went in and took </v>
<v Speaker 3>videos and posting them on youtube of </v>

631
00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.840
<v Speaker 3>suffocating the Bible and then just </v>
<v Speaker 3>walked into the school.</v>

632
00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.550
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's kind of similar in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

633
00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.690
<v Speaker 3>they have bought hook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>line and sinker into microaggressions,</v>

634
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:23.180
<v Speaker 3>trigger warning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>safe spaces,</v>

635
00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:25.700
<v Speaker 3>diversity and issues there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are no,</v>

636
00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.060
<v Speaker 3>there's no questioning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a.</v>

637
00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.013
<v Speaker 3>and it's something for me that makes me </v>
<v Speaker 3>deeply uncomfortable when my students </v>

638
00:30:32.631 --> 00:30:35.060
<v Speaker 3>can ask questions when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they,</v>

639
00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:36.523
<v Speaker 3>they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just uncomfortable to voice </v>

640
00:30:39.111 --> 00:30:44.111
<v Speaker 3>their opinions about things and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that peep to say the least.</v>

641
00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:48.740
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people are enraged at me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but exactly what Jim said.</v>

642
00:30:48.741 --> 00:30:49.880
<v Speaker 3>Some people will come in like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

643
00:30:49.881 --> 00:30:51.170
<v Speaker 3>thank you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I know,</v>

644
00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:52.123
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't be public about what is the </v>

645
00:30:53.511 --> 00:30:54.344
<v Speaker 3>ratio.</v>

646
00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:56.803
<v Speaker 2>I mean for me it's like 95 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are really happy it happened </v>

647
00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:03.710
<v Speaker 2>and can't let it be known,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not,</v>

648
00:31:03.711 --> 00:31:05.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>facing these people</v>

649
00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:07.450
<v Speaker 3>full everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

650
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:10.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the videos from evergreen state,</v>

651
00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:15.010
<v Speaker 3>you can see Bret Weinstein's </v>
<v Speaker 3>interactions with not just students,</v>

652
00:31:15.011 --> 00:31:16.700
<v Speaker 3>but also some of the professors that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were there,</v>

653
00:31:16.701 --> 00:31:20.860
<v Speaker 3>there were some of these preposterous </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that he had to work with that are</v>

654
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:21.903
<v Speaker 3>buying in Hook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>line and sinker to this stuff and they </v>

655
00:31:23.051 --> 00:31:26.290
<v Speaker 3>live in these insulated world and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

656
00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.393
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they create these people that also want </v>

657
00:31:30.761 --> 00:31:31.594
<v Speaker 3>to stay inside these insulated worlds </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it just sort of stew in these </v>

658
00:31:36.191 --> 00:31:40.180
<v Speaker 3>ideas and then again go out into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>real world and they think they're better</v>

659
00:31:40.181 --> 00:31:41.650
<v Speaker 3>people as a result.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

660
00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.830
<v Speaker 2>So that's a big trick to doing the good </v>
<v Speaker 2>work because to like question this,</v>

661
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:48.170
<v Speaker 2>maybe to look at it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

662
00:31:48.171 --> 00:31:49.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of looks like bullshit,</v>

663
00:31:49.851 --> 00:31:52.610
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these guys are left leaning.</v>

664
00:31:52.611 --> 00:31:53.444
<v Speaker 2>People are outright leftists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them want to do the right </v>

665
00:31:55.731 --> 00:31:56.564
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

666
00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:57.553
<v Speaker 2>They really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people really care about </v>

667
00:31:58.941 --> 00:32:01.330
<v Speaker 2>progressive agendas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

668
00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:04.550
<v Speaker 2>getting over any lingering </v>
<v Speaker 2>discrimination that's going on,</v>

669
00:32:04.551 --> 00:32:05.480
<v Speaker 2>racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexism,</v>

670
00:32:05.481 --> 00:32:07.130
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really want to do the right thing.</v>

671
00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:08.480
<v Speaker 2>Good for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

672
00:32:08.481 --> 00:32:09.314
<v Speaker 2>That's what we want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they actually have to question or </v>

673
00:32:12.231 --> 00:32:13.064
<v Speaker 2>like run county,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think of that like as a river of </v>

674
00:32:15.141 --> 00:32:15.974
<v Speaker 2>morality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>running through them to their mind they </v>

675
00:32:17.451 --> 00:32:20.510
<v Speaker 2>actually have to go upstream a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit and that's hard and it feels weird.</v>

676
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:21.710
<v Speaker 2>You have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

677
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:22.783
<v Speaker 2>maybe this scholarship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this stuff isn't the best way to </v>

678
00:32:26.571 --> 00:32:27.404
<v Speaker 2>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the first thought you have as </v>

679
00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:30.123
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys are these people in these </v>

680
00:32:31.161 --> 00:32:31.994
<v Speaker 2>disciplines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grievance studies are are fighting </v>

681
00:32:33.591 --> 00:32:34.424
<v Speaker 2>racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if I go against them then I'm going </v>

682
00:32:36.081 --> 00:32:36.914
<v Speaker 2>against the people fighting racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe I'm helping racism and what we </v>

683
00:32:39.351 --> 00:32:40.520
<v Speaker 2>keep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we get any criticism,</v>

684
00:32:40.521 --> 00:32:41.410
<v Speaker 2>that's what it always is.</v>

685
00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.840
<v Speaker 3>Being racists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a tool of the right,</v>

686
00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:44.850
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Etc.</v>

687
00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:45.723
<v Speaker 3>Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're racist or we are outright </v>

688
00:32:47.681 --> 00:32:50.950
<v Speaker 3>racists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Outright racist and accusEd of being.</v>

689
00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:53.770
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you disagree with any of this stuff,</v>

690
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:57.400
<v Speaker 3>I get accused of being outright all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

691
00:32:57.401 --> 00:33:01.240
<v Speaker 3>I lean so far left universal healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>universal,</v>

692
00:33:01.241 --> 00:33:04.120
<v Speaker 3>basic income,</v>
<v Speaker 3>free school,</v>

693
00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:06.130
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think education should be free.</v>

694
00:33:06.131 --> 00:33:09.310
<v Speaker 3>I think we should paY for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in a lot of socialist ideas.</v>

695
00:33:09.311 --> 00:33:12.640
<v Speaker 3>Totally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm right wing because I make fun of</v>

696
00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:15.430
<v Speaker 3>people that want to study problemization</v>
<v Speaker 3>of dogs.</v>

697
00:33:15.431 --> 00:33:19.090
<v Speaker 3>Fucking really worried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where it is.</v>

698
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:22.000
<v Speaker 3>If you look at like whether I support </v>
<v Speaker 3>gay rights,</v>

699
00:33:22.001 --> 00:33:22.960
<v Speaker 3>women's rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm all,</v>

700
00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:26.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on board with all that shit.</v>

701
00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:28.830
<v Speaker 3>Take more of my taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>

702
00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:29.773
<v Speaker 3>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can afford to pay more if I really </v>

703
00:33:31.661 --> 00:33:34.930
<v Speaker 3>believed that people are going to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>real healthcare and real education.</v>

704
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.560
<v Speaker 3>Fucking very happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very happy.</v>

705
00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:39.653
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I thought it was all being </v>

706
00:33:40.481 --> 00:33:42.970
<v Speaker 3>appropriated and used correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah.</v>

707
00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.650
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's make the world a better place.</v>

708
00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:45.530
<v Speaker 2>So that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

709
00:33:45.531 --> 00:33:48.350
<v Speaker 2>is if all this scholarship that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were doing on race and gender,</v>

710
00:33:48.351 --> 00:33:50.350
<v Speaker 2>although that's important stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

711
00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.630
<v Speaker 2>So if they're doing that right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't you want to be behind it?</v>

712
00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:55.640
<v Speaker 2>But they're not doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>HOw do I know?</v>

713
00:33:55.641 --> 00:33:56.474
<v Speaker 2>Because I made up papers about dog </v>
<v Speaker 2>humping and made up the conclusion </v>

714
00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:04.070
<v Speaker 2>before I wrote the paper and then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they publish it and given an award.</v>

715
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.940
<v Speaker 2>If I can start with the conclusion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then work backwards to that conclusion,</v>

716
00:34:07.941 --> 00:34:10.430
<v Speaker 2>then I'm not doing rigorous scholarship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm making shit up.</v>

717
00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:11.343
<v Speaker 3>Well also there's no room for dissent </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's absolutely zero and in </v>

718
00:34:15.841 --> 00:34:16.674
<v Speaker 3>academia you can't even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to teach whatever the moral </v>

719
00:34:18.871 --> 00:34:19.704
<v Speaker 3>orthodoxy is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just imagine this going into </v>

720
00:34:21.811 --> 00:34:24.870
<v Speaker 3>university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to your young mind,</v>

721
00:34:24.871 --> 00:34:28.690
<v Speaker 3>you're young kid and I'm deeply </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned about these kids are going and</v>

722
00:34:28.691 --> 00:34:31.620
<v Speaker 3>they never hear the other side of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue about immigration.</v>

723
00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:35.010
<v Speaker 3>They never hear the other day so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they become brittle over time.</v>

724
00:34:35.011 --> 00:34:36.360
<v Speaker 3>So when they hear it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>

725
00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:38.370
<v Speaker 3>they don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're shocked by it.</v>

726
00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.820
<v Speaker 3>Professors are terrified that they'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>get a complaint.</v>

727
00:34:41.821 --> 00:34:43.350
<v Speaker 3>They'll hAve to go to the diversity </v>
<v Speaker 3>board.</v>

728
00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:44.423
<v Speaker 3>I've been told that I'm not allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>render my opinion about protected </v>

729
00:34:46.591 --> 00:34:48.870
<v Speaker 3>classes when I had that ethics and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>teach ethics.</v>

730
00:34:48.910 --> 00:34:52.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't teach a class or two classes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've also.</v>

731
00:34:52.450 --> 00:34:54.600
<v Speaker 3>That's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you for asking me.</v>

732
00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:56.970
<v Speaker 3>I've asked for a definition of protected</v>
<v Speaker 3>classes,</v>

733
00:34:56.971 --> 00:34:59.730
<v Speaker 3>a list of protected classes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't receive any.</v>

734
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:02.460
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can be criticized for.</v>

735
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:04.620
<v Speaker 3>I cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cannot offer for it.</v>

736
00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:05.071
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

737
00:35:05.071 --> 00:35:07.420
<v Speaker 3>I cannot offer under.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>

738
00:35:07.421 --> 00:35:07.670
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

739
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:08.503
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

740
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:10.740
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was up on a title nine violation.</v>

741
00:35:10.741 --> 00:35:11.574
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm up for a violation of title nine </v>

742
00:35:13.201 --> 00:35:14.034
<v Speaker 3>violation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That title nine title nine violation is </v>

743
00:35:16.561 --> 00:35:17.850
<v Speaker 3>serious shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

744
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:19.710
<v Speaker 3>Federal discrimination law in </v>
<v Speaker 3>universities.</v>

745
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What'd you do?</v>

746
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.430
<v Speaker 3>I can't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>

747
00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.240
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but among the other things that came out</v>

748
00:35:27.241 --> 00:35:28.800
<v Speaker 3>in that meeting where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

749
00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:32.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm not allowed to render my opinion </v>
<v Speaker 3>about a protective class.</v>

750
00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:35.880
<v Speaker 3>And so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

751
00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:38.760
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I know are covered under a protective</v>

752
00:35:38.761 --> 00:35:39.594
<v Speaker 3>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't have an opinion on homosexual </v>

753
00:35:41.731 --> 00:35:43.200
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can have an opinion,</v>

754
00:35:43.201 --> 00:35:45.360
<v Speaker 3>but I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if it's a positive opinion?</v>

755
00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.433
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the example that was used in class </v>

756
00:35:48.511 --> 00:35:50.970
<v Speaker 3>was evident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Evidently I made a comment.</v>

757
00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.490
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's take a step back.</v>

758
00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:54.393
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is an ethics class and I was </v>

759
00:35:56.941 --> 00:36:01.941
<v Speaker 3>talking about how a sexual choice does </v>
<v Speaker 3>not fall into the realm of morality.</v>

760
00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:05.280
<v Speaker 3>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>If a guy's gay and he likes another guy,</v>

761
00:36:05.281 --> 00:36:06.114
<v Speaker 3>that's just not a moral thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just preference or just is what </v>

762
00:36:09.151 --> 00:36:12.150
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a matter of taste and some,</v>

763
00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:13.043
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but someone in someone in the class </v>

764
00:36:16.651 --> 00:36:17.101
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

765
00:36:17.101 --> 00:36:17.934
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't have tastes or something </v>

766
00:36:19.621 --> 00:36:20.454
<v Speaker 3>or you shouldn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I can't remember the exact frame </v>

767
00:36:23.041 --> 00:36:24.990
<v Speaker 3>because I'm getting this third hand from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

768
00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.970
<v Speaker 3>from my violation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

769
00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:31.440
<v Speaker 3>my time came to someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody said in class,</v>

770
00:36:31.441 --> 00:36:32.700
<v Speaker 3>well what about this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

771
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.950
<v Speaker 3>I made the comment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

772
00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.350
<v Speaker 3>everybody has something.</v>

773
00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:38.183
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has a preference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't say that no one had a </v>

774
00:36:40.501 --> 00:36:41.070
<v Speaker 3>preference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

775
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:43.680
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be as if it was,</v>

776
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:45.420
<v Speaker 3>it would be as if I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

777
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:46.343
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to date someone who's 400 </v>

778
00:36:47.521 --> 00:36:48.354
<v Speaker 3>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that comment then got turned into </v>

779
00:36:52.411 --> 00:36:53.244
<v Speaker 3>something when they called somebody else</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the office of diversity inclusion </v>

780
00:36:56.011 --> 00:36:56.844
<v Speaker 3>called someone else in and it was made </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I was rendering my opinion about </v>

781
00:36:59.881 --> 00:37:00.714
<v Speaker 3>people who were 400 pounds when my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I was doing is saying that </v>

782
00:37:04.621 --> 00:37:06.540
<v Speaker 3>homosexuality itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>

783
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:09.900
<v Speaker 3>there's no reason to give that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not a moral thing,</v>

784
00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:10.973
<v Speaker 3>but people lump it in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the main point of this whole thing </v>

785
00:37:13.501 --> 00:37:14.334
<v Speaker 3>is that we have situations in which </v>
<v Speaker 3>professors can't talk about protected </v>

786
00:37:17.851 --> 00:37:20.520
<v Speaker 3>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Students are afraid to ask questions.</v>

787
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:24.330
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's walking on egg shells and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the students aren't learning and phrases</v>

788
00:37:24.331 --> 00:37:25.240
<v Speaker 3>are taken out of context.</v>

789
00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.093
<v Speaker 3>Phrases are taking out of context now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now if you want a place to go to </v>

790
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:33.930
<v Speaker 3>celebrate whatever the raining,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more orthodoxy is in the university is a</v>

791
00:37:33.931 --> 00:37:37.200
<v Speaker 3>great place for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you explain what you meant by saying</v>

792
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:38.063
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You like saying you don't want to date </v>

793
00:37:39.931 --> 00:37:40.764
<v Speaker 3>people over 400 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you explain the context of the use </v>

794
00:37:43.501 --> 00:37:44.334
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She wasn't interested in the context of </v>

795
00:37:45.631 --> 00:37:46.464
<v Speaker 3>it and the trend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't even say he doesn't want to </v>

796
00:37:47.881 --> 00:37:48.714
<v Speaker 3>date people over 400 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said it as exactly as I phrase it as </v>

797
00:37:52.001 --> 00:37:53.380
<v Speaker 3>a hypothetical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

798
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:58.550
<v Speaker 3>so their entire thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you had said maybe I don't like,</v>

799
00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:01.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to date people over seven </v>
<v Speaker 3>feet tall.</v>

800
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.840
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you could have got away with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

801
00:38:03.841 --> 00:38:06.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people over seven feet </v>
<v Speaker 3>tall or protected class,</v>

802
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.553
<v Speaker 3>you could have got away with that even </v>
<v Speaker 3>though it's still basically the same </v>

803
00:38:09.481 --> 00:38:09.660
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

804
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:10.493
<v Speaker 3>It's a preference issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mentioned this to one of my </v>

805
00:38:12.121 --> 00:38:13.550
<v Speaker 3>colleagues and he said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh you,</v>

806
00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.940
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't say that.</v>

807
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:16.470
<v Speaker 3>You should never have said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

808
00:38:16.471 --> 00:38:17.010
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

809
00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:17.341
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

810
00:38:17.341 --> 00:38:18.330
<v Speaker 3>you should have said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

811
00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.393
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like dating blue or green </v>

812
00:38:20.251 --> 00:38:21.090
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

813
00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:23.100
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're they know that they,</v>

814
00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:24.123
<v Speaker 3>they don't even know blue green people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who is coming to around man and then </v>

815
00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.710
<v Speaker 3>they become a protected class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then someone goes back and looks at what</v>

816
00:38:31.711 --> 00:38:33.580
<v Speaker 3>you said 10 years ago about blue or </v>
<v Speaker 3>green.</v>

817
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 3>So that's how I get fired and that's how</v>
<v Speaker 3>that works.</v>

818
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:36.903
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at all this stuff then </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out about victimhood culture and </v>

819
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.000
<v Speaker 2>how it propagates and how it develops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's one of the things.</v>

820
00:38:43.001 --> 00:38:47.240
<v Speaker 2>It's called competitive victimhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could call it additive competitive.</v>

821
00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.360
<v Speaker 2>That's the formal term.</v>

822
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:53.390
<v Speaker 3>People who study this love that </v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderful people are fighting over who's</v>

823
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:55.463
<v Speaker 3>a bigger victim.</v>

824
00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:58.460
<v Speaker 2>Did you see it all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you see people in society,</v>

825
00:38:58.461 --> 00:38:59.031
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

826
00:38:59.031 --> 00:38:59.864
<v Speaker 2>the black lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People go nuts and then all of a sudden </v>

827
00:39:01.251 --> 00:39:03.020
<v Speaker 2>the white supremacists are out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

828
00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:04.730
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white people have it hard too.</v>

829
00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:06.740
<v Speaker 2>The second day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second somebody hears,</v>

830
00:39:06.741 --> 00:39:07.574
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black people have a hard somebodIes got </v>

831
00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:09.320
<v Speaker 2>to be like white people have it hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

832
00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:14.000
<v Speaker 2>That's competitive victimhood and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>then when you have like a moral economy,</v>

833
00:39:14.001 --> 00:39:16.280
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can kind of cash in,</v>

834
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:21.360
<v Speaker 2>gain status or gain access to to </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking or whatever it happens to be by</v>

835
00:39:21.501 --> 00:39:24.590
<v Speaker 2>holding a certain status of victim hood </v>
<v Speaker 2>or grievance.</v>

836
00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:26.053
<v Speaker 2>Then you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find people competing to find ways to </v>

837
00:39:27.771 --> 00:39:30.560
<v Speaker 2>get that for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's going to go.</v>

838
00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:31.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have the infrastructure </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

839
00:39:31.881 --> 00:39:35.030
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's goIng to go after trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>maximize their own utility within that,</v>

840
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:40.130
<v Speaker 2>so people over seven feet tall aren't a </v>
<v Speaker 2>protected class yet,</v>

841
00:39:40.131 --> 00:39:42.740
<v Speaker 2>but the second they realize that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be able to cash in on it.</v>

842
00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.110
<v Speaker 2>They might lobby for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edited victimhood,</v>

843
00:39:45.111 --> 00:39:46.600
<v Speaker 2>grievance jockeying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been also,</v>

844
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:47.543
<v Speaker 2>I've called it grievance jockeying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think gets out since you mentioned </v>

845
00:39:49.611 --> 00:39:50.960
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>called it the oppression olympics.</v>

846
00:39:50.961 --> 00:39:51.560
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yup.</v>

847
00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's wonderful times,</v>

848
00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:58.070
<v Speaker 3>but it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the root,</v>

849
00:39:58.071 --> 00:40:01.970
<v Speaker 3>so here's the thing that we thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>about extensively.</v>

850
00:40:01.971 --> 00:40:05.090
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the root,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where is this stuff coming from?</v>

851
00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:09.980
<v Speaker 3>All of this stuff is coming from these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the canons of knowledge,</v>

852
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.843
<v Speaker 3>their bodies of literature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're peer reviewed and that's the </v>

853
00:40:13.761 --> 00:40:14.920
<v Speaker 3>idea laundering thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

854
00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.140
<v Speaker 3>Which was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all of that stuff is coming from from</v>

855
00:40:18.141 --> 00:40:18.974
<v Speaker 3>this and if you want to make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to get back to constructive </v>

856
00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:22.873
<v Speaker 3>politics to get back to people having </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations and that's a thing like </v>

857
00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:26.473
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the reasons that your </v>

858
00:40:27.921 --> 00:40:28.754
<v Speaker 3>show has been so successful is it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a combination of authenticity with </v>

859
00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:37.940
<v Speaker 3>you can have your totally willing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have conversations with no holds barred,</v>

860
00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:39.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't have that in the academy,</v>

861
00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:45.040
<v Speaker 3>so people need to go to you to hear </v>
<v Speaker 3>these thoughts and to wrestle with ideas</v>

862
00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:46.160
<v Speaker 3>and to engage.</v>

863
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:47.023
<v Speaker 3>It's just if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't really do it anywhere else </v>

864
00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:54.860
<v Speaker 3>other than a podcast or you can't do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the academy,</v>

865
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:56.840
<v Speaker 3>but you can't even do it on the today </v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

866
00:40:56.870 --> 00:41:01.660
<v Speaker 3>They fired meghan carroll for asking why</v>
<v Speaker 3>is blackface racist,</v>

867
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:04.500
<v Speaker 3>which is a stupid fucking question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No doubt,</v>

868
00:41:04.501 --> 00:41:06.890
<v Speaker 3>and she's not a bright woman and in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>regard,</v>

869
00:41:06.891 --> 00:41:10.340
<v Speaker 3>socially very clumsy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clunky thing to say,</v>

870
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:11.383
<v Speaker 3>but they just fire a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>IT should have what they should have </v>

871
00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:14.804
<v Speaker 3>done was brought in black scholars and </v>
<v Speaker 3>black intellectuals for a week just to </v>

872
00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:22.300
<v Speaker 3>fucking griller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

873
00:41:22.301 --> 00:41:24.380
<v Speaker 3>and that would have been amazing </v>
<v Speaker 3>television,</v>

874
00:41:24.381 --> 00:41:27.590
<v Speaker 3>but that attItude that you have is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they have.</v>

875
00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:30.660
<v Speaker 3>So they want to punish the transgression</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

876
00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:31.670
<v Speaker 3>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

877
00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 3>I think they just want to stop and</v>

878
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.240
<v Speaker 1>I think they didn't like her anyway,</v>

879
00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:36.363
<v Speaker 2>that's the word is they really didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoy her and that she wasn't a nice </v>

880
00:41:39.491 --> 00:41:42.490
<v Speaker 2>person and she was immediate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a learning moment,</v>

881
00:41:42.491 --> 00:41:43.324
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a teaching moment that's lost </v>

882
00:41:44.111 --> 00:41:44.781
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

883
00:41:44.781 --> 00:41:45.614
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

884
00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:48.410
<v Speaker 2>but think about it in terms of what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were talking about earlier where the.</v>

885
00:41:48.411 --> 00:41:51.100
<v Speaker 2>The scholarships stretching back again </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the sixties,</v>

886
00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:52.173
<v Speaker 2>you have this idea that all of socIety </v>
<v Speaker 2>is constructed out of power dynamics </v>

887
00:41:56.261 --> 00:41:57.094
<v Speaker 2>that are mediated through language media</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagery and so she just now became </v>

888
00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:02.793
<v Speaker 2>problematic and she put out ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be dangerous and poisonous not to </v>

889
00:42:06.731 --> 00:42:10.270
<v Speaker 2>discuss the merits or demerits of not </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to work through.</v>

890
00:42:10.271 --> 00:42:13.810
<v Speaker 2>Not something as a teachable moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She put out an idea that's dangerous.</v>

891
00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:15.730
<v Speaker 2>She can't put out ideas anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

892
00:42:15.731 --> 00:42:16.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really interesting too.</v>

893
00:42:16.991 --> 00:42:17.824
<v Speaker 2>She tried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was so disingenuous and how she </v>

894
00:42:19.241 --> 00:42:21.070
<v Speaker 2>approached it is so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

895
00:42:21.071 --> 00:42:21.904
<v Speaker 2>what a black person is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it wrong for a black person </v>

896
00:42:24.581 --> 00:42:25.690
<v Speaker 2>dressed as a white person?</v>

897
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one ever said that.</v>

898
00:42:28.121 --> 00:42:28.954
<v Speaker 1>Why are you pretending you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>setting it up so that you could say a </v>

899
00:42:31.391 --> 00:42:31.770
<v Speaker 1>white</v>

900
00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:32.603
<v Speaker 2>pursing were black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>black face about the other cultural </v>

901
00:42:36.781 --> 00:42:38.580
<v Speaker 2>moment there too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like you said,</v>

902
00:42:38.581 --> 00:42:40.740
<v Speaker 2>they bring in black scholars and at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end of that she said,</v>

903
00:42:40.741 --> 00:42:41.574
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really listened to that and I didn't </v>

904
00:42:42.991 --> 00:42:45.480
<v Speaker 2>know that and I was wrong and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing my mind.</v>

905
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:47.790
<v Speaker 2>There was a woman on twitter that said </v>
<v Speaker 2>her video,</v>

906
00:42:47.791 --> 00:42:49.080
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I retweeted it,</v>

907
00:42:49.081 --> 00:42:49.914
<v Speaker 2>that it looked like a hostage video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything that was missing was her </v>

908
00:42:52.651 --> 00:42:54.440
<v Speaker 2>holding up a newspaper that showed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

909
00:42:54.441 --> 00:42:57.980
<v Speaker 2>saw that it was australian woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

910
00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:00.723
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing is so fucking funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is one of the worst ways to </v>

911
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:08.540
<v Speaker 1>really dissect the ideas because first </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all,</v>

912
00:43:08.541 --> 00:43:11.480
<v Speaker 1>there's the studio audience that fucks </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything up.</v>

913
00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:12.553
<v Speaker 1>Second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have these massive time constraints </v>

914
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:18.440
<v Speaker 1>and then you have advertisers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have a bunch of executives that</v>

915
00:43:18.441 --> 00:43:19.274
<v Speaker 1>are all cowards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all just ready to pull the </v>

916
00:43:20.541 --> 00:43:21.374
<v Speaker 1>trigger on anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anytime they can blame you for anything </v>

917
00:43:23.691 --> 00:43:26.120
<v Speaker 1>that went wrong and get rid of you or </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire you,</v>

918
00:43:26.121 --> 00:43:27.440
<v Speaker 1>fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire him,</v>

919
00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:28.880
<v Speaker 1>get rid of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of him,</v>

920
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:31.310
<v Speaker 1>bringing the next person you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they'll,</v>

921
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:35.780
<v Speaker 1>they'll most likely do is to to show </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've learned.</v>

922
00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.330
<v Speaker 1>They'll hire an all black crew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

923
00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:42.440
<v Speaker 1>For the diverse crew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all a matter of fact.</v>

924
00:43:42.441 --> 00:43:45.560
<v Speaker 1>I think I've read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they doing that?</v>

925
00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:46.790
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if they do that.</v>

926
00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:48.770
<v Speaker 1>They're replacing meghan kelly with a</v>

927
00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:54.080
<v Speaker 2>approve of color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make about where that works,</v>

928
00:43:54.771 --> 00:43:55.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It works.</v>

929
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:56.503
<v Speaker 2>You said they're cowards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're afraid they're going to damage </v>

930
00:43:58.161 --> 00:43:58.994
<v Speaker 2>their brand or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where does that work or who works on </v>

931
00:44:01.371 --> 00:44:02.121
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bullies,</v>

932
00:44:02.121 --> 00:44:03.470
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so these people,</v>

933
00:44:03.471 --> 00:44:05.660
<v Speaker 2>why are they so pervasive in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>academy?</v>

934
00:44:05.661 --> 00:44:07.370
<v Speaker 2>Why are they say pr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so pervasive and media.</v>

935
00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:08.413
<v Speaker 2>They know they can bully these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know that they can go lean on this </v>

936
00:44:10.521 --> 00:44:11.354
<v Speaker 2>stuff and somebody is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>cowardly and then they're going to be </v>

937
00:44:13.691 --> 00:44:17.150
<v Speaker 2>able to make something change in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction they want it to change.</v>

938
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:19.610
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even creeping into politics,</v>

939
00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:21.700
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they try to do it with policymakers.</v>

940
00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:23.810
<v Speaker 2>You see it a lot more and a lot of other</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>

941
00:44:23.811 --> 00:44:27.470
<v Speaker 2>Right now we're in this massive backlash</v>
<v Speaker 2>against it in american politics.</v>

942
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:32.680
<v Speaker 2>How's that going to the 2016?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your progressive agenda gang.</v>

943
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:33.833
<v Speaker 2>Holy crap.</v>

944
00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.090
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is a part of the problem with the.</v>

945
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.570
<v Speaker 4>What are they saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

946
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:40.430
<v Speaker 4>look at this today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As you know,</v>

947
00:44:40.431 --> 00:44:43.160
<v Speaker 4>we're starting a new chapter in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>third hour of our show.</v>

948
00:44:43.161 --> 00:44:45.170
<v Speaker 4>As it evolves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's evolving.</v>

949
00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.033
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking living being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want you to know the entire today </v>

950
00:44:48.591 --> 00:44:49.424
<v Speaker 4>family will continue to bring you in </v>
<v Speaker 4>formative and important stories just as </v>

951
00:44:52.911 --> 00:44:56.750
<v Speaker 4>we always have and look to black guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a brown chick</v>

952
00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:01.960
<v Speaker 2>that's 100 percent diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got rid of the princess.</v>

953
00:45:01.961 --> 00:45:03.730
<v Speaker 2>All diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

954
00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:07.420
<v Speaker 2>The way that diversity is defined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had a panel,</v>

955
00:45:07.421 --> 00:45:09.460
<v Speaker 2>it was just black guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be 100 percent diverse.</v>

956
00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:12.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they've redefined the word diversity.</v>

957
00:45:12.391 --> 00:45:14.580
<v Speaker 4>They need to find the word inclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

958
00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.020
<v Speaker 4>but to people outside the academy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

959
00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:17.970
<v Speaker 4>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

960
00:45:17.971 --> 00:45:19.290
<v Speaker 4>diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a great thing.</v>

961
00:45:19.291 --> 00:45:21.630
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's not what it means.</v>

962
00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:26.650
<v Speaker 4>It means kind of when everybody has the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same ideas about something and it's also</v>

963
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:27.503
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're enforcing diversity for what </v>

964
00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.480
<v Speaker 4>we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we would have to find out.</v>

965
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:36.600
<v Speaker 4>Like ultimately the goal is to find out </v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

966
00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:37.973
<v Speaker 4>what causes people to succeed and </v>
<v Speaker 4>especially succeeding in something as </v>

967
00:45:43.111 --> 00:45:45.180
<v Speaker 4>benign as talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

968
00:45:45.181 --> 00:45:46.860
<v Speaker 4>You're just talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all you're doing.</v>

969
00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:49.710
<v Speaker 4>So what causes someone to succeed and </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking.</v>

970
00:45:49.711 --> 00:45:50.544
<v Speaker 4>What makes their ideas valuable would </v>
<v Speaker 4>make some someone you'd enjoy listening </v>

971
00:45:53.041 --> 00:45:57.480
<v Speaker 4>to and then finding like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What impediments?</v>

972
00:45:57.481 --> 00:45:58.314
<v Speaker 4>There are two that in all the various </v>
<v Speaker 4>communities and fix it at the root </v>

973
00:46:01.471 --> 00:46:04.950
<v Speaker 4>level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What doesn't work is saying,</v>

974
00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:05.843
<v Speaker 4>we need one chinese lady,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we need one black guy and we need one </v>

975
00:46:09.691 --> 00:46:12.090
<v Speaker 4>white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if you do something like that,</v>

976
00:46:12.091 --> 00:46:14.460
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to get the best show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nope,</v>

977
00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:15.640
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to get the best.</v>

978
00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:16.753
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not even guaranteed to achieve </v>

979
00:46:17.391 --> 00:46:18.920
<v Speaker 2>the goal you're claiming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

980
00:46:18.921 --> 00:46:19.754
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to theory in theory and </v>

981
00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:22.753
<v Speaker 2>theory in terms of postmodern critical </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory that this stuff's all based on </v>

982
00:46:25.071 --> 00:46:25.904
<v Speaker 2>that we studied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea is that if you have a </v>

983
00:46:28.011 --> 00:46:28.844
<v Speaker 2>particular identity now you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular view of the world and people </v>

984
00:46:31.851 --> 00:46:32.684
<v Speaker 2>have other identities have different </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones and in fact there's this whole </v>

985
00:46:35.391 --> 00:46:36.224
<v Speaker 2>thing called standpoint epistemology </v>
<v Speaker 2>that says that if you have a </v>

986
00:46:38.361 --> 00:46:39.194
<v Speaker 2>marginalized identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know more about the world and other </v>

987
00:46:40.701 --> 00:46:43.160
<v Speaker 2>people because you live in two worlds at</v>
<v Speaker 2>once.</v>

988
00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:45.320
<v Speaker 2>So the the idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

989
00:46:45.321 --> 00:46:48.020
<v Speaker 2>if we get a black guy in here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's had a different life experience,</v>

990
00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:52.280
<v Speaker 2>therefore he can speak truly to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get a chinese lady in here,</v>

991
00:46:52.281 --> 00:46:53.930
<v Speaker 2>she can speak to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on and so Forth.</v>

992
00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:59.180
<v Speaker 2>So the guests is that by virtue merely </v>
<v Speaker 2>of bringing in people who look different</v>

993
00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:03.980
<v Speaker 2>with different races or genders or </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexist or sexualities,</v>

994
00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:08.660
<v Speaker 2>then you automatically get a diverse set</v>
<v Speaker 2>of opinions,</v>

995
00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:11.930
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not how that actually works.</v>

996
00:47:11.931 --> 00:47:12.764
<v Speaker 2>You could take people of every race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>educate them on the exact same social </v>

997
00:47:15.531 --> 00:47:17.930
<v Speaker 2>justice curriculum and they all think </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly the same thing,</v>

998
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:23.630
<v Speaker 4>but at least in something like hosting </v>
<v Speaker 4>the today show you are just talking once</v>

999
00:47:23.671 --> 00:47:26.790
<v Speaker 4>you put these sort of diversity </v>
<v Speaker 4>standards or something like mathematics.</v>

1000
00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:27.650
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1001
00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:29.190
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when things get super.</v>

1002
00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:30.040
<v Speaker 4>And so</v>

1003
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.530
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to do that a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>tweeted that thing.</v>

1004
00:47:32.531 --> 00:47:36.850
<v Speaker 2>I wroTe about the mathematics and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted people to sign an equity,</v>

1005
00:47:36.851 --> 00:47:39.200
<v Speaker 2>which is another word that they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooperated.</v>

1006
00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:42.640
<v Speaker 2>They wanted folks to sign an equity </v>
<v Speaker 2>statement and a diversity statement,</v>

1007
00:47:42.641 --> 00:47:43.570
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explain,</v>

1008
00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.310
<v Speaker 2>explain what they're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That you,</v>

1009
00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:47.930
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a commitment to diversity.</v>

1010
00:47:47.931 --> 00:47:48.764
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a commItment to diversity and </v>

1011
00:47:50.021 --> 00:47:50.854
<v Speaker 2>you have a commitment to equity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so equity does not mean treating </v>

1012
00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:55.504
<v Speaker 2>people equally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you have a commitment to </v>

1013
00:47:56.801 --> 00:47:58.940
<v Speaker 2>equality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what we should all have a short</v>

1014
00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.280
<v Speaker 2>material quality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1015
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:01.503
<v Speaker 2>it's equity is defined differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's to make up for past injustices are </v>

1016
00:48:07.631 --> 00:48:12.631
<v Speaker 2>to make up for some deficiency that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>occurred somewhere along the line.</v>

1017
00:48:14.531 --> 00:48:15.364
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>affirmative action is an equity </v>

1018
00:48:16.571 --> 00:48:17.404
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's to treat people differently in </v>

1019
00:48:19.031 --> 00:48:20.290
<v Speaker 2>order to level the playing field.</v>

1020
00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:22.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not treating people,</v>

1021
00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:24.970
<v Speaker 2>it's not treating people equally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the key thing.</v>

1022
00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.710
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

1023
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:30.430
<v Speaker 2>It's a word that they've smuggled in </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight out of the literature.</v>

1024
00:48:30.431 --> 00:48:31.121
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's again,</v>

1025
00:48:31.121 --> 00:48:32.980
<v Speaker 2>out of all the stuff comes back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>literature.</v>

1026
00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:35.740
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at the word equity in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dictionary,</v>

1027
00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.113
<v Speaker 2>you get one definition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at the word equIty as </v>

1028
00:48:39.671 --> 00:48:42.670
<v Speaker 2>they're applying it and sociological </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitions,</v>

1029
00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:43.563
<v Speaker 2>it's a very specific thing that means </v>
<v Speaker 2>something slightly different from what </v>

1030
00:48:46.541 --> 00:48:48.040
<v Speaker 2>people assume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the question.</v>

1031
00:48:48.041 --> 00:48:48.874
<v Speaker 2>You should ask somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anytime you hear someone use the word </v>

1032
00:48:50.771 --> 00:48:52.330
<v Speaker 2>equity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just ask.</v>

1033
00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:52.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

1034
00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why didn't you use the word equality?</v>

1035
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:56.380
<v Speaker 2>Can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you.</v>

1036
00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:57.213
<v Speaker 2>Can you think of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would the sentence be the same with the </v>

1037
00:48:59.651 --> 00:49:00.400
<v Speaker 2>meeting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be the same?</v>

1038
00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:01.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meaning is not the same.</v>

1039
00:49:01.541 --> 00:49:03.670
<v Speaker 2>That's why they used equity and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>equality.</v>

1040
00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Equity is a finance word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's weird.</v>

1041
00:49:06.251 --> 00:49:09.040
<v Speaker 2>He's also fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they don't make up new words,</v>

1042
00:49:09.041 --> 00:49:10.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

1043
00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:11.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call up,</v>

1044
00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:14.530
<v Speaker 2>they change and then they smuggled </v>
<v Speaker 2>diversity inclusion,</v>

1045
00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:18.310
<v Speaker 2>these academic papers and they come up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with these ideas.</v>

1046
00:49:18.311 --> 00:49:20.260
<v Speaker 2>They start with their conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they push it through,</v>

1047
00:49:20.261 --> 00:49:21.094
<v Speaker 2>it gets published and that's just like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the academic equivalent of </v>

1048
00:49:23.891 --> 00:49:27.130
<v Speaker 2>money laundering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Money laundering work.</v>

1049
00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.450
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take some money,</v>

1050
00:49:28.451 --> 00:49:29.460
<v Speaker 2>you got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1051
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:33.610
<v Speaker 2>ill gotten money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put it through this shell company or</v>

1052
00:49:33.611 --> 00:49:35.920
<v Speaker 2>this thing or the other thing and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes back to you.</v>

1053
00:49:35.921 --> 00:49:38.350
<v Speaker 2>And now it's had illegal trail that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes it legit.</v>

1054
00:49:38.351 --> 00:49:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well here you take some prejudice.</v>

1055
00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:43.270
<v Speaker 2>You write it down as an academic paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You published the thing,</v>

1056
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:45.550
<v Speaker 2>it gets the academic standard stamp on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1057
00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:48.280
<v Speaker 2>It's the gold standard of knowledge now </v>
<v Speaker 2>and now.</v>

1058
00:49:48.281 --> 00:49:51.280
<v Speaker 2>This is this prejudice you started with </v>
<v Speaker 2>now looks like legitimate knowledge that</v>

1059
00:49:51.281 --> 00:49:52.450
<v Speaker 2>can go straight in the classroom.</v>

1060
00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:55.360
<v Speaker 2>It can go straight to exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Activists or policymakers.</v>

1061
00:49:55.660 --> 00:49:56.920
<v Speaker 2>It's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1062
00:49:56.921 --> 00:49:57.754
<v Speaker 2>And then really funny though that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get it is that's bret weinstein said </v>

1063
00:50:04.561 --> 00:50:08.020
<v Speaker 2>that weinstein said that and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes out.</v>

1064
00:50:08.021 --> 00:50:08.854
<v Speaker 2>The other side is knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then they think they have knowledge </v>

1065
00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:13.003
<v Speaker 2>or paper about the dildos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy said this paper is an important </v>

1066
00:50:15.311 --> 00:50:19.390
<v Speaker 2>contribution to knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who is it that the reviewer one?</v>

1067
00:50:19.391 --> 00:50:20.770
<v Speaker 2>I think out of the viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1068
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:24.400
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck are you Important </v>
<v Speaker 2>contribution to knowledge.</v>

1069
00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 2>I would hope reviewer one was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>hitting a bong right</v>

1070
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:32.600
<v Speaker 1>before big data was laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing at the whole college.</v>

1071
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.273
<v Speaker 1>What kind of person gets attracted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole heartedly agreeing to these </v>

1072
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:41.480
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1073
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:44.180
<v Speaker 1>What are the people like to gray </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

1074
00:50:44.181 --> 00:50:45.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it's people who want to save the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1075
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:47.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1076
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:48.770
<v Speaker 1>I think we would all like to save the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1077
00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:50.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm much more cynical than they.</v>

1078
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:55.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got to know they've got,</v>

1079
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.823
<v Speaker 2>they've got this idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we talked a moment ago about </v>

1080
00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:04.640
<v Speaker 2>about privilege and we kind of brushed </v>
<v Speaker 2>real close to the idea that it fits kind</v>

1081
00:51:04.641 --> 00:51:05.474
<v Speaker 2>of like original sin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they see that the downside of </v>

1082
00:51:09.641 --> 00:51:10.710
<v Speaker 2>privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opposIte side,</v>

1083
00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.460
<v Speaker 2>discrimination or racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexism,</v>

1084
00:51:12.461 --> 00:51:14.230
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hate is the big word.</v>

1085
00:51:14.231 --> 00:51:16.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight hate or he's he,</v>

1086
00:51:16.401 --> 00:51:18.640
<v Speaker 2>he's using hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is hate speech.</v>

1087
00:51:18.641 --> 00:51:22.330
<v Speaker 2>That's where I think they got the term </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like the evil thing.</v>

1088
00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:24.640
<v Speaker 2>You're born with privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like original sin.</v>

1089
00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:25.990
<v Speaker 2>So what do they want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want,</v>

1090
00:51:26.590 --> 00:51:30.280
<v Speaker 2>they want to fIx the save the world by </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearing out the evil of privilege,</v>

1091
00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:33.280
<v Speaker 2>by clearing out hate from the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For them.</v>

1092
00:51:33.281 --> 00:51:34.114
<v Speaker 2>Utopia means nobody hates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by hate we mean something like </v>

1093
00:51:36.671 --> 00:51:37.650
<v Speaker 2>racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexism,</v>

1094
00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:38.583
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

1095
00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:39.453
<v Speaker 2>So it's a noble idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then when you start looking at it </v>

1096
00:51:42.461 --> 00:51:43.294
<v Speaker 2>and it's ridiculous way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're born with privilege and now </v>

1097
00:51:44.981 --> 00:51:46.660
<v Speaker 2>you're just stuck with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1098
00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:48.400
<v Speaker 2>What can you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's original sin.</v>

1099
00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:49.263
<v Speaker 2>You can be sorry for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can try to be an ally and work it </v>

1100
00:51:50.741 --> 00:51:52.240
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can check it.</v>

1101
00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:54.730
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the hell that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do a lot of things,</v>

1102
00:51:54.731 --> 00:51:57.580
<v Speaker 2>but you can't actually atone for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't get over it.</v>

1103
00:51:57.581 --> 00:51:58.414
<v Speaker 2>You can't get rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you get this situation where it's </v>

1104
00:52:01.361 --> 00:52:04.840
<v Speaker 2>like they really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really need to take desperate measures.</v>

1105
00:52:04.841 --> 00:52:06.130
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's lock it all down.</v>

1106
00:52:06.131 --> 00:52:06.964
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's tell these people that they're </v>

1107
00:52:08.021 --> 00:52:08.854
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's try to point out how white </v>

1108
00:52:09.971 --> 00:52:12.400
<v Speaker 2>supremacy is in them because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>white.</v>

1109
00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:16.300
<v Speaker 2>LeT's point out how masculinity is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology that needs to be destroyed.</v>

1110
00:52:16.301 --> 00:52:18.490
<v Speaker 2>That was Lisa Wade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wrote that last year.</v>

1111
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:22.870
<v Speaker 1>That is an ideology that needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyed.</v>

1112
00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It needs to be masculine because trump,</v>

1113
00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.040
<v Speaker 2>and this is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1114
00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:28.530
<v Speaker 2>I think in the past couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

1115
00:52:28.531 --> 00:52:29.690
<v Speaker 2>before trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't new.</v>

1116
00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:30.653
<v Speaker 2>They had other avatars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of anger and </v>

1117
00:52:32.341 --> 00:52:33.174
<v Speaker 2>frustration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>justifiably slow at trump and they see </v>

1118
00:52:35.311 --> 00:52:37.610
<v Speaker 2>this and so I read so many other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually op-eds,</v>

1119
00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:41.130
<v Speaker 2>not their academic pieces and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>men are like this,</v>

1120
00:52:41.131 --> 00:52:41.771
<v Speaker 2>men are blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1121
00:52:41.771 --> 00:52:42.604
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can tell they're just talking </v>

1122
00:52:42.721 --> 00:52:44.370
<v Speaker 2>about trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can't touch him.</v>

1123
00:52:44.371 --> 00:52:46.560
<v Speaker 2>So they're pissed off and they tried to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take it out on all men.</v>

1124
00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.590
<v Speaker 2>I think that's like a huge thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They see these problems,</v>

1125
00:52:49.591 --> 00:52:50.424
<v Speaker 2>they exaggerate the problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They practIce problematizing and that's </v>

1126
00:52:52.501 --> 00:52:53.334
<v Speaker 2>a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rIght?</v>

1127
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:55.710
<v Speaker 2>They practice this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to school,</v>

1128
00:52:55.711 --> 00:52:58.530
<v Speaker 2>it's in the general ed curriculum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they major in this stuff.</v>

1129
00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:02.820
<v Speaker 2>You get good at fInding problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just talking yesterday.</v>

1130
00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:04.500
<v Speaker 2>came over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never actually,</v>

1131
00:53:04.501 --> 00:53:05.880
<v Speaker 2>I got to los angeles a couple of times </v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

1132
00:53:05.881 --> 00:53:08.220
<v Speaker 2>but I've never been to the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never actually made it down,</v>

1133
00:53:08.221 --> 00:53:09.054
<v Speaker 2>so I went down to santa monica,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to one of these burger places right </v>

1134
00:53:11.821 --> 00:53:12.654
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the right by the pier and it says </v>

1135
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:15.623
<v Speaker 2>that this is the burger that made santa </v>
<v Speaker 2>monica famous and immediately you saw </v>

1136
00:53:18.961 --> 00:53:20.010
<v Speaker 2>the hot ones thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1137
00:53:20.011 --> 00:53:21.240
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a paper on this,</v>

1138
00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:22.533
<v Speaker 2>you see the problems here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have this manly double being </v>

1139
00:53:26.161 --> 00:53:28.410
<v Speaker 2>marketed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what made santa monica famous.</v>

1140
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:29.333
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maInly food culture is the kind of </v>

1141
00:53:30.931 --> 00:53:35.610
<v Speaker 2>like colonialism that goes and makes a </v>
<v Speaker 2>city become a city.</v>

1142
00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:37.890
<v Speaker 2>It makes a place into a place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could.</v>

1143
00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:39.750
<v Speaker 2>I could write a paper about that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>three days.</v>

1144
00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to have credentials to write</v>
<v Speaker 2>a paper,</v>

1145
00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:42.850
<v Speaker 2>a phd?</v>

1146
00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:44.010
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technically not.</v>

1147
00:53:44.011 --> 00:53:47.730
<v Speaker 2>And that's a sad thing because what </v>
<v Speaker 2>their response to this has been,</v>

1148
00:53:47.731 --> 00:53:48.564
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to screen better to see who </v>

1149
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:52.500
<v Speaker 2>is actually writing these papers so they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't trick us,</v>

1150
00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:54.780
<v Speaker 2>but that's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we trick you.</v>

1151
00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:55.763
<v Speaker 2>The point is that the scholarship is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it should stand on its merits of </v>

1152
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:58.783
<v Speaker 2>the arguments solid if the research is </v>
<v Speaker 2>good and they thought our research was </v>

1153
00:54:01.321 --> 00:54:04.140
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my point about the dog humping thing,</v>

1154
00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:05.453
<v Speaker 2>it should leave it the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're saying that this is such an </v>

1155
00:54:08.161 --> 00:54:09.450
<v Speaker 2>important piece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1156
00:54:09.451 --> 00:54:10.284
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would walk back on that one </v>

1157
00:54:10.891 --> 00:54:15.510
<v Speaker 2>because we did make up the data and </v>
<v Speaker 2>falsifying data is not cool.</v>

1158
00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:17.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what data would be incorrect?</v>

1159
00:54:17.741 --> 00:54:20.130
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't even go to the dog park.</v>

1160
00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:24.810
<v Speaker 2>We definitely didn't ask anybody about </v>
<v Speaker 2>their dogs or their genitals or anything</v>

1161
00:54:24.811 --> 00:54:27.240
<v Speaker 2>that you could have similar results.</v>

1162
00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:31.350
<v Speaker 2>We said that there's a dog crapping on </v>
<v Speaker 2>another dog's head in the paper and like</v>

1163
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:34.140
<v Speaker 2>that didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that didn't happen and maybe it</v>

1164
00:54:34.141 --> 00:54:36.900
<v Speaker 2>did happen though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is insane,</v>

1165
00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:38.580
<v Speaker 2>but we had other papers that didn't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1166
00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Fat bodybuilding didn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one that's the one that joke's on.</v>

1167
00:54:41.191 --> 00:54:42.024
<v Speaker 2>You didn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no made up data and most of </v>

1168
00:54:43.771 --> 00:54:47.190
<v Speaker 2>our papers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why shouldn't those stand?</v>

1169
00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:48.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why should they stand by those?</v>

1170
00:54:48.691 --> 00:54:49.524
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can get it because we can't </v>

1171
00:54:50.701 --> 00:54:51.534
<v Speaker 2>differentiate real scholarship from </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit because they're in this crazy </v>

1172
00:54:54.241 --> 00:54:55.074
<v Speaker 2>eco system in which their ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make discerning judgments about things </v>

1173
00:54:59.431 --> 00:55:02.190
<v Speaker 2>has been dulled because they put an </v>
<v Speaker 2>agenda before the truth.</v>

1174
00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:03.083
<v Speaker 2>I keep seeing all these academics coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they get their got you moment on </v>

1175
00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:05.580
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1176
00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:06.570
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read your paper.</v>

1177
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:07.740
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a real paper.</v>

1178
00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:08.431
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1179
00:55:08.431 --> 00:55:10.140
<v Speaker 2>How crazy is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1180
00:55:10.141 --> 00:55:11.450
<v Speaker 2>thanks For noticing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1181
00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:12.293
<v Speaker 2>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what we were trying to </v>

1182
00:55:13.621 --> 00:55:16.050
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We weren't writing just stupid pranks.</v>

1183
00:55:16.051 --> 00:55:16.884
<v Speaker 2>The dog park papers pretty funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we were actually trying to learn </v>

1184
00:55:19.111 --> 00:55:19.944
<v Speaker 2>what's going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for noticing somebody finally </v>

1185
00:55:21.811 --> 00:55:23.700
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that means of course they don't want</v>

1186
00:55:23.701 --> 00:55:24.534
<v Speaker 2>to admit that we actually learn this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff because then when we say it's </v>

1187
00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:27.323
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're stuck with somebody who knows </v>

1188
00:55:28.531 --> 00:55:31.320
<v Speaker 2>what they're talking about saying it </v>
<v Speaker 2>sucks and they don't want that either.</v>

1189
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:34.103
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you said these people that are </v>

1190
00:55:34.501 --> 00:55:36.720
<v Speaker 2>trying to save the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what?</v>

1191
00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:38.003
<v Speaker 2>What do you really mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there are the people who are </v>

1192
00:55:40.081 --> 00:55:42.330
<v Speaker 2>trying to build the kingdom of god on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet earth.</v>

1193
00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:44.090
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to draw a metaphor,</v>

1194
00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:44.933
<v Speaker 2>religious metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people who see an eVil and </v>

1195
00:55:46.621 --> 00:55:49.470
<v Speaker 2>they want to purge the world of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil by any means necessary,</v>

1196
00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:53.640
<v Speaker 2>and the evil being like privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 2>privilege,</v>

1197
00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:56.770
<v Speaker 2>privilege and white supremacy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new religions,</v>

1198
00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:58.380
<v Speaker 2>patriarch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity goes down.</v>

1199
00:55:58.381 --> 00:55:59.214
<v Speaker 2>It's just a game of thrones is the onlY </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason you need new gods are because </v>

1200
00:56:02.371 --> 00:56:03.204
<v Speaker 2>people don't believe in the old gods and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we have these religious modules or </v>

1201
00:56:06.271 --> 00:56:11.271
<v Speaker 2>what have you in our brain and the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion is intersectionality and we see</v>

1202
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:16.230
<v Speaker 2>really is what it is exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the parallels are wrIting about</v>

1203
00:56:16.231 --> 00:56:17.064
<v Speaker 2>that and talking about that for years </v>
<v Speaker 2>studyIng religion psychology for years </v>

1204
00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:23.710
<v Speaker 2>and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all over the listening is political</v>

1205
00:56:23.711 --> 00:56:24.460
<v Speaker 2>correctness</v>

1206
00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:26.080
<v Speaker 3>is paralleled with blast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>

1207
00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:29.020
<v Speaker 3>it's the same parallels of harrison the </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparels.</v>

1208
00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:31.280
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

1209
00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:32.643
<v Speaker 3>it's so stunning how easily people sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of slide into these preconditioned </v>

1210
00:56:37.001 --> 00:56:38.650
<v Speaker 3>slots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huge.</v>

1211
00:56:38.651 --> 00:56:42.280
<v Speaker 3>The one difference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is a key difference,</v>

1212
00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:47.080
<v Speaker 3>the reason that it's easier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mentioned this to pendulum when we</v>

1213
00:56:47.081 --> 00:56:48.760
<v Speaker 3>did a talk and he just couldn't believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1214
00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:53.080
<v Speaker 3>The reason that it's easier to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 3>christian for example,</v>

1215
00:56:53.081 --> 00:56:53.914
<v Speaker 3>about faith or about their religion is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because at the end of the day it comes </v>

1216
00:56:57.161 --> 00:57:00.460
<v Speaker 3>down to faith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people don't have any faith.</v>

1217
00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.380
<v Speaker 3>They have knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote.</v>

1218
00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:06.430
<v Speaker 3>They have their bodies of scholarly </v>
<v Speaker 3>literature which are ideal honored.</v>

1219
00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:07.683
<v Speaker 3>That's what they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they can point to these things and </v>

1220
00:57:09.551 --> 00:57:10.361
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1221
00:57:10.361 --> 00:57:11.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1222
00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:12.490
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you know?</v>

1223
00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:13.590
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>robin deangelo's,</v>

1224
00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.160
<v Speaker 3>white fragility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How'd you study?</v>

1225
00:57:15.161 --> 00:57:15.890
<v Speaker 3>There's a study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1226
00:57:15.890 --> 00:57:17.200
<v Speaker 3>there's a study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a study,</v>

1227
00:57:17.201 --> 00:57:18.760
<v Speaker 3>there's a study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know household stuff.</v>

1228
00:57:18.761 --> 00:57:19.594
<v Speaker 3>Some of those studies are written and </v>
<v Speaker 3>trust them and you shouldn't trust them </v>

1229
00:57:22.691 --> 00:57:24.210
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:28.270
<v Speaker 3>Well you see that even in nutrition when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see it in everything this,</v>

1231
00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:32.860
<v Speaker 3>this in in terms of like almost a </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious or religion,</v>

1232
00:57:32.861 --> 00:57:34.600
<v Speaker 3>like accepting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1233
00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:38.800
<v Speaker 3>Have specific ways of eating or specific</v>
<v Speaker 3>ways of communicating,</v>

1234
00:57:38.801 --> 00:57:39.634
<v Speaker 3>specific ways of being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so strange how people seem to </v>

1235
00:57:44.350 --> 00:57:49.350
<v Speaker 3>have this natural inclination to adopt </v>
<v Speaker 3>predetermined patterns of behavior.</v>

1236
00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:49.820
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1237
00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:50.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think actually there's pretty decent </v>

1238
00:57:52.041 --> 00:57:54.860
<v Speaker 2>understanding of that from from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective of moral psychology.</v>

1239
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:56.083
<v Speaker 2>You've got this idea that somebody has </v>
<v Speaker 2>has seen something as good so it </v>

1240
00:57:59.241 --> 00:58:00.440
<v Speaker 2>elevates them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes them better,</v>

1241
00:58:00.441 --> 00:58:02.750
<v Speaker 2>so clean eating might be good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1242
00:58:02.751 --> 00:58:04.670
<v Speaker 2>Whatever clean eating means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For some people it's vegan.</v>

1243
00:58:04.671 --> 00:58:07.370
<v Speaker 2>For some people it's like all you eat is</v>
<v Speaker 2>grass fed beef,</v>

1244
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:08.263
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you've got clean eating and you've </v>

1245
00:58:10.011 --> 00:58:10.844
<v Speaker 2>got dirty eating and he'd go into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>clean thing and so you've got this kind </v>

1246
00:58:12.851 --> 00:58:13.684
<v Speaker 2>of like purity thing and eventually you </v>
<v Speaker 2>take this so seriously that it becomes </v>

1247
00:58:16.550 --> 00:58:18.350
<v Speaker 2>kind of a sacred value to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1248
00:58:18.351 --> 00:58:19.740
<v Speaker 2>what's sacred mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1249
00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:21.530
<v Speaker 2>we have this kind oF vague sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1250
00:58:21.531 --> 00:58:23.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy this,</v>

1251
00:58:23.001 --> 00:58:23.834
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sacred and it's something really </v>

1252
00:58:25.341 --> 00:58:26.174
<v Speaker 2>important to somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or what it really means is that it's </v>

1253
00:58:27.531 --> 00:58:28.364
<v Speaker 2>taken on so much moral important to </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody that they no longer will allow </v>

1254
00:58:31.221 --> 00:58:33.140
<v Speaker 2>it to be questioned when something </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacred.</v>

1255
00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:35.690
<v Speaker 2>It's now been removed from the sphere of</v>
<v Speaker 2>being doubted,</v>

1256
00:58:35.691 --> 00:58:36.524
<v Speaker 2>questioned or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you have this idea of Like </v>

1257
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:40.130
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1258
00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:45.810
<v Speaker 2>let's say that that privilege is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause of,</v>

1259
00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:49.400
<v Speaker 2>of racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you've elevated that are the problem</v>

1260
00:58:49.401 --> 00:58:50.234
<v Speaker 2>with everything in society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even then you've elevated that to a </v>

1261
00:58:51.891 --> 00:58:52.724
<v Speaker 2>sacred value that can't be questioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't say maybe there's another </v>

1262
00:58:55.971 --> 00:58:56.804
<v Speaker 2>dimension to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when you start getting these </v>

1263
00:58:58.611 --> 00:59:00.530
<v Speaker 2>kinds of religious like behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start getting these,</v>

1264
00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:04.360
<v Speaker 2>these problems because you've got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>place where it can't be a question.</v>

1265
00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.233
<v Speaker 2>Be made fun of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we're talking about the comedy </v>

1266
00:59:06.621 --> 00:59:08.090
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is killing comedy,</v>

1267
00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:09.403
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely killing comedy because </v>

1268
00:59:10.251 --> 00:59:13.190
<v Speaker 2>you can't make a joke because if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>joke goes a little bit wrong,</v>

1269
00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:15.620
<v Speaker 2>now you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've committed a heresy,</v>

1270
00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:17.750
<v Speaker 2>you're a blasphemer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be yes,</v>

1271
00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:18.593
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because people love when you go against </v>

1272
00:59:21.531 --> 00:59:22.190
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

1273
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:25.070
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the weight of it is there,</v>

1274
00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:28.410
<v Speaker 1>but when you resist it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people scream and throw.</v>

1275
00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:28.911
<v Speaker 1>YeS,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1276
00:59:28.911 --> 00:59:30.860
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is really interesting because if</v>

1277
00:59:30.861 --> 00:59:33.470
<v Speaker 1>we take their theory about humor at face</v>
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>

1278
00:59:33.471 --> 00:59:34.304
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you can only go against a power </v>

1279
00:59:35.991 --> 00:59:36.591
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we say,</v>

1280
00:59:36.591 --> 00:59:37.310
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1281
00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:38.480
<v Speaker 1>We wrote a paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of our papers,</v>

1282
00:59:38.481 --> 00:59:40.970
<v Speaker 1>the joke's on you was about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the right.</v>

1283
00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Why do people love it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1284
00:59:42.921 --> 00:59:45.140
<v Speaker 1>it's because everybody knows these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys have power.</v>

1285
00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:47.270
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to pretend that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have power,</v>

1286
00:59:47.271 --> 00:59:49.130
<v Speaker 1>that they are the victims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the oppressed.</v>

1287
00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:50.353
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're bullying everybody and </v>

1288
00:59:51.150 --> 00:59:51.983
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're firing people for saying the </v>

1289
00:59:53.451 --> 00:59:54.900
<v Speaker 1>wrong thing in class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1290
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:55.783
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's only possible if they have power </v>

1291
00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:00.140
<v Speaker 1>in the joke when south park makes fun of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1292
01:00:00.141 --> 01:00:00.771
<v Speaker 1>what was it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pc,</v>

1293
01:00:00.771 --> 01:00:01.640
<v Speaker 1>principal or whatever.</v>

1294
01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:02.653
<v Speaker 1>When south park makes fun of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only reason people laugh if their </v>

1295
01:00:04.791 --> 01:00:06.980
<v Speaker 1>theory is right is because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>

1296
01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.280
<v Speaker 1>If their theory's wrong because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just funny.</v>

1297
01:00:10.281 --> 01:00:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Then we can talk about something </v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

1298
01:00:11.481 --> 01:00:14.390
<v Speaker 1>but if they're actually right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're actually making a point here,</v>

1299
01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:18.860
<v Speaker 1>they're not recognizing that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>admitting that they have seized a lot of</v>

1300
01:00:18.861 --> 01:00:19.694
<v Speaker 1>cultural power and that's why people </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrate when you go back against </v>

1301
01:00:23.121 --> 01:00:23.954
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why people have sent us some </v>

1302
01:00:24.531 --> 01:00:26.330
<v Speaker 1>emails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is the greatest thing ever.</v>

1303
01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:27.613
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all this shit like you guys are </v>

1304
01:00:29.571 --> 01:00:30.231
<v Speaker 1>heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1305
01:00:30.231 --> 01:00:31.160
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1306
01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Because they wanted to see you laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1307
01:00:33.081 --> 01:00:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Because it was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As hell as why and why?</v>

1308
01:00:35.541 --> 01:00:36.374
<v Speaker 1>Because these people are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're influencing the shit out of </v>

1309
01:00:38.841 --> 01:00:39.770
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1310
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:42.290
<v Speaker 1>and if they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they were just,</v>

1311
01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>victims who don't have a voice,</v>

1312
01:00:44.061 --> 01:00:47.000
<v Speaker 1>who can't make any impact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who aren't bullying people.</v>

1313
01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Every room you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you bullying those guys?</v>

1314
01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:50.960
<v Speaker 1>Why are you being a dick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1315
01:00:50.961 --> 01:00:54.980
<v Speaker 1>but everybody thinks it's funny and why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because because they have real impact.</v>

1316
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:56.660
<v Speaker 1>They haven't had a real impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1317
01:00:56.661 --> 01:00:57.494
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the things that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>really want to convey to people is that </v>

1318
01:01:00.231 --> 01:01:02.840
<v Speaker 1>this happens in the academy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does not stay in the academy.</v>

1319
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:03.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's spread.</v>

1320
01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.950
<v Speaker 1>It's spread throughout the world now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1321
01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:09.860
<v Speaker 1>I've read some articles about some </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we've said on this show that</v>

1322
01:01:09.861 --> 01:01:10.694
<v Speaker 1>are just fucking completely preposterous</v>
<v Speaker 1>and taken totally out of context and </v>

1323
01:01:14.121 --> 01:01:17.300
<v Speaker 1>presented as some evidence of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1324
01:01:17.301 --> 01:01:21.800
<v Speaker 1>whatever transgression that's impossible</v>
<v Speaker 1>to defend.</v>

1325
01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:25.490
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange time for,</v>

1326
01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:29.210
<v Speaker 1>for communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange time for ideas now,</v>

1327
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:30.133
<v Speaker 1>but I also think it's really exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exciting that all this nonsense is </v>

1328
01:01:32.991 --> 01:01:34.700
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that are really</v>

1329
01:01:34.701 --> 01:01:35.870
<v Speaker 1>loved about what you guys have done.</v>

1330
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:36.703
<v Speaker 1>It's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exciting that you guys have </v>

1331
01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:43.580
<v Speaker 1>infiltrated and had these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>dummies public.</v>

1332
01:01:43.581 --> 01:01:45.860
<v Speaker 1>Not just publish your shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but praise it.</v>

1333
01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say how amazing it is that you wrote</v>

1334
01:01:48.891 --> 01:01:49.724
<v Speaker 1>a bit about fat bodybuilding acceptance </v>
<v Speaker 1>is this one fat shaming and fat </v>

1335
01:01:58.011 --> 01:02:01.130
<v Speaker 1>acceptance too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Preposterous phrases.</v>

1336
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:02.690
<v Speaker 1>There really are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1337
01:02:02.691 --> 01:02:05.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean you shouldn't be mean to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it,</v>

1338
01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:08.600
<v Speaker 1>but fat shaming because someone's fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1339
01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:12.650
<v Speaker 1>you can't call me fat because I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fat doesn't work.</v>

1340
01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:15.260
<v Speaker 1>So that's real similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that body of literature.</v>

1341
01:02:15.261 --> 01:02:16.094
<v Speaker 1>Here's something that I learned when I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read this is they don't use the word </v>

1342
01:02:20.641 --> 01:02:24.660
<v Speaker 1>obesity because this is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting because obesity,</v>

1343
01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.450
<v Speaker 1>it gets back to what jim was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obesity is a narrative.</v>

1344
01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>It's just a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they use the word fat.</v>

1345
01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's not obesity,</v>

1346
01:02:32.551 --> 01:02:33.384
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's fat bodybuilding and there are </v>

1347
01:02:34.441 --> 01:02:35.274
<v Speaker 1>all these narratives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why would one want to buy into one </v>

1348
01:02:40.021 --> 01:02:41.940
<v Speaker 1>narrative rather than another narrative?</v>

1349
01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:42.803
<v Speaker 1>Why iS fat and obesity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because obesity is a medicalized </v>

1350
01:02:47.131 --> 01:02:49.650
<v Speaker 1>narrative where fat is just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>description.</v>

1351
01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>They're rejecting medicalized terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1352
01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:55.230
<v Speaker 1>they call it a health system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making that up.</v>

1353
01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:56.803
<v Speaker 1>Health is a narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a power structure were healthy and </v>

1354
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:01.133
<v Speaker 1>thin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are imposing their view of how </v>

1355
01:03:04.321 --> 01:03:07.790
<v Speaker 1>bodies should be on an unhealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been privileged,</v>

1356
01:03:07.791 --> 01:03:11.580
<v Speaker 1>like they'd look at you and you've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the [inaudible] your muscular too,</v>

1357
01:03:11.581 --> 01:03:13.800
<v Speaker 1>so you wouldn't just be straight white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heterosexual,</v>

1358
01:03:13.801 --> 01:03:14.960
<v Speaker 1>cis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

1359
01:03:14.970 --> 01:03:15.803
<v Speaker 1>I mean you've got health privilege and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got health privilege and </v>

1360
01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:21.490
<v Speaker 1>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably thin privilege also enable us.</v>

1361
01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:25.170
<v Speaker 1>You're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really stuck.</v>

1362
01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Falls into that.</v>

1363
01:03:27.001 --> 01:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>So I'm privileged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>

1364
01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:34.320
<v Speaker 1>That's a real one that they use and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>also claim to be a healthy at every size</v>

1365
01:03:34.321 --> 01:03:35.154
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be healthy at every size and </v>

1366
01:03:36.181 --> 01:03:38.460
<v Speaker 1>obesity is just a medicalized </v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives.</v>

1367
01:03:38.461 --> 01:03:39.294
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's really important though </v>

1368
01:03:39.601 --> 01:03:40.434
<v Speaker 1>because the point of that is to say if </v>
<v Speaker 1>your doctor tells you you're fat and </v>

1369
01:03:43.981 --> 01:03:46.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a health concern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have to listen.</v>

1370
01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the.</v>

1371
01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.753
<v Speaker 1>I've read that before and they're read </v>
<v Speaker 1>an article by this woman who was </v>

1372
01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:54.660
<v Speaker 1>morbidly obese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charlotte cooper.</v>

1373
01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:55.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't use the mail order,</v>

1374
01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:57.373
<v Speaker 4>but she was talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was also using really misusing some </v>

1375
01:04:00.711 --> 01:04:04.550
<v Speaker 4>studies on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was some there.</v>

1376
01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:05.393
<v Speaker 4>There.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There have been some studies on people </v>

1377
01:04:07.011 --> 01:04:07.844
<v Speaker 4>who are overweight and that there could </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly be some health benefits to </v>

1378
01:04:13.581 --> 01:04:17.300
<v Speaker 4>being overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These studies had been widely dismissed.</v>

1379
01:04:17.301 --> 01:04:18.134
<v Speaker 4>Now not only dismissed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they go in direct contrast to the </v>

1380
01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:22.424
<v Speaker 4>great volume of studies that show how </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible it is for your health to be </v>

1381
01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.850
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that fat and that heavy,</v>

1382
01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:32.630
<v Speaker 4>but this person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember who it was,</v>

1383
01:04:32.631 --> 01:04:37.340
<v Speaker 4>why she was doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she was clinging to these one or two</v>

1384
01:04:37.341 --> 01:04:42.140
<v Speaker 4>studies that have been dismissed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are biased epidemiological studies</v>

1385
01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:43.183
<v Speaker 4>that have been dismissed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she was put putting them in this </v>

1386
01:04:44.661 --> 01:04:45.494
<v Speaker 4>blog as if this is some sort of evidence</v>
<v Speaker 4>that not only is it not unhealthy to be </v>

1387
01:04:51.531 --> 01:04:52.364
<v Speaker 4>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it might be healthy to be fast and </v>

1388
01:04:54.121 --> 01:04:54.954
<v Speaker 4>I'll think about this person in an </v>
<v Speaker 4>academic position as a professor </v>

1389
01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:00.560
<v Speaker 4>teaching young people to protect </v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly young girls,</v>

1390
01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:03.360
<v Speaker 4>particularly young girls who have eating</v>
<v Speaker 4>disorders.</v>

1391
01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:05.810
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Health a white privilege.</v>

1392
01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this real?</v>

1393
01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:11.820
<v Speaker 1>This is a real paper is definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

1394
01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:13.263
<v Speaker 1>they think it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like when the doctor says </v>

1395
01:05:15.221 --> 01:05:16.990
<v Speaker 1>you're overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a concern for your health.</v>

1396
01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>See that as a form</v>

1397
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:21.250
<v Speaker 2>of fat shaming saying that they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>all right the way that they are.</v>

1398
01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:22.960
<v Speaker 2>They're not Being accepted the way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>

1399
01:05:23.110 --> 01:05:23.943
<v Speaker 2>There was a power dynamic that healthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are imposing upon overweight </v>

1400
01:05:26.351 --> 01:05:27.184
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have myriad issues that they come </v>

1401
01:05:28.901 --> 01:05:29.734
<v Speaker 2>up with and I mean insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of these complaints have got to be </v>

1402
01:05:32.111 --> 01:05:33.010
<v Speaker 2>somewhat real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1403
01:05:33.011 --> 01:05:36.490
<v Speaker 2>they don't make as many oversized </v>
<v Speaker 2>clothes plus sized clothes.</v>

1404
01:05:36.491 --> 01:05:39.820
<v Speaker 2>It's harder to get styles or there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>some legit stuff you know,</v>

1405
01:05:39.821 --> 01:05:41.110
<v Speaker 2>that they might want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1406
01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:44.710
<v Speaker 2>what can we do something about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on the other hand,</v>

1407
01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:48.190
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing that like saying that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>has nothing to do with health,</v>

1408
01:05:48.191 --> 01:05:50.920
<v Speaker 2>it has nothing to do with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>triglyceride levels.</v>

1409
01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:57.010
<v Speaker 2>It runs it's anti evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It runs in tHe face of every conceivable</v>

1410
01:05:57.011 --> 01:05:59.320
<v Speaker 2>piece of evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are teaching kids this,</v>

1411
01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:01.420
<v Speaker 2>they're in schools and there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>classes,</v>

1412
01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:03.900
<v Speaker 2>fat studies classes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was an actual,</v>

1413
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:04.210
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

1414
01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:04.750
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1415
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:09.280
<v Speaker 2>There's fat studies journal publIshed </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fed fat studies.</v>

1416
01:06:09.330 --> 01:06:10.210
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's going to bring it up.</v>

1417
01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:14.860
<v Speaker 2>I told you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you 30 million people are waiting</v>

1418
01:06:14.861 --> 01:06:19.861
<v Speaker 2>to find out real journal of body weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what jim was telling me.</v>

1419
01:06:21.011 --> 01:06:22.390
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when when we do this,</v>

1420
01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:25.260
<v Speaker 2>30 million people are going to now know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's something fat.</v>

1421
01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Now fat studies doesn't do what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think it does.</v>

1422
01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:29.110
<v Speaker 2>You probably think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1423
01:06:29.111 --> 01:06:30.070
<v Speaker 2>fat studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1424
01:06:30.071 --> 01:06:32.080
<v Speaker 2>A triglycerides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much should you exercise?</v>

1425
01:06:32.570 --> 01:06:34.840
<v Speaker 2>Good diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much sugar is too much sugar?</v>

1426
01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:37.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is aBsolutely not what this journal</v>

1427
01:06:37.391 --> 01:06:39.940
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frozen a fat tail of immigration.</v>

1428
01:06:39.941 --> 01:06:42.700
<v Speaker 2>What the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rafting weight stigma.</v>

1429
01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:43.593
<v Speaker 2>Hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crafting weight stigma in swimming </v>

1430
01:06:46.781 --> 01:06:49.360
<v Speaker 2>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A case study in Ireland,</v>

1431
01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:50.141
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm tellIng you,</v>

1432
01:06:50.141 --> 01:06:52.450
<v Speaker 2>you go to a swimming class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go lose weight.</v>

1433
01:06:52.451 --> 01:06:54.250
<v Speaker 2>You take a take a fitness class or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1434
01:06:54.251 --> 01:06:55.084
<v Speaker 2>Whatever slimming classes are fatness in</v>
<v Speaker 2>temporary use a stigma against being </v>

1435
01:06:58.331 --> 01:06:58.570
<v Speaker 2>fat.</v>

1436
01:06:58.570 --> 01:07:00.490
<v Speaker 2>They they basically say fats bad for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1437
01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:02.490
<v Speaker 2>This one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>theorizing,</v>

1438
01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:03.333
<v Speaker 2>fat oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intersectional approaches and </v>

1439
01:07:06.881 --> 01:07:10.300
<v Speaker 2>methodological innovations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just said a bunch of nonsense.</v>

1440
01:07:10.301 --> 01:07:11.134
<v Speaker 2>The oppression of fat people as built </v>
<v Speaker 2>into institutions pervades the cultural </v>

1441
01:07:13.691 --> 01:07:15.100
<v Speaker 2>landscape in effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

1442
01:07:15.101 --> 01:07:15.934
<v Speaker 2>we could have written this and affects </v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationship and perceptions of </v>

1443
01:07:17.921 --> 01:07:19.390
<v Speaker 2>people of size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people of size.</v>

1444
01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:22.530
<v Speaker 2>Is this introduction to the special </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue on flip size?</v>

1445
01:07:22.531 --> 01:07:23.364
<v Speaker 2>It's not the new people of color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More people of color is a problem now </v>

1446
01:07:28.451 --> 01:07:30.930
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes you can,</v>

1447
01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:33.940
<v Speaker 2>but you see there's people of color and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's bi poc,</v>

1448
01:07:33.970 --> 01:07:35.430
<v Speaker 2>which I don't know how you pronounce it </v>
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>

1449
01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.700
<v Speaker 2>it's bipap or what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

1450
01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:38.553
<v Speaker 2>that would be black and indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 2>people of color because they have even </v>

1451
01:07:40.871 --> 01:07:42.430
<v Speaker 2>more oppression than the other people of</v>
<v Speaker 2>color.</v>

1452
01:07:42.431 --> 01:07:45.140
<v Speaker 2>And they got a fight and yellow people </v>
<v Speaker 2>of color.</v>

1453
01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:46.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

1454
01:07:46.091 --> 01:07:47.670
<v Speaker 2>or probably brown.</v>

1455
01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:50.590
<v Speaker 2>Harvard can discriminate against asians </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are trying to get in,</v>

1456
01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:52.570
<v Speaker 2>let's tap our noses and just move on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1457
01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.570
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1458
01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:56.413
<v Speaker 2>but then that's even a problem because </v>
<v Speaker 2>indigenous has recent recently been </v>

1459
01:07:58.870 --> 01:08:01.540
<v Speaker 2>branded a racist term because you're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually honoring.</v>

1460
01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:02.403
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not hitting the actual tribal </v>

1461
01:08:03.671 --> 01:08:06.040
<v Speaker 2>identity if you get right on the cutting</v>
<v Speaker 2>edge of this stuff.</v>

1462
01:08:06.041 --> 01:08:10.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like really going into meltdown </v>
<v Speaker 2>closeness is because it's too random.</v>

1463
01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:11.231
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1464
01:08:11.231 --> 01:08:12.040
<v Speaker 2>you're just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not.</v>

1465
01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.500
<v Speaker 2>You're generalizing your chair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What exactly?</v>

1466
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.000
<v Speaker 2>Nez perce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1467
01:08:17.001 --> 01:08:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can see again,</v>

1468
01:08:18.921 --> 01:08:23.050
<v Speaker 2>the competitive victimhood going on who </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets to claim more of the victimhood pie</v>

1469
01:08:23.150 --> 01:08:25.520
<v Speaker 2>and oh now we've got this thing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>people of color.</v>

1470
01:08:25.521 --> 01:08:26.670
<v Speaker 2>so they get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1471
01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:29.360
<v Speaker 2>victimhood status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why?</v>

1472
01:08:29.361 --> 01:08:31.280
<v Speaker 2>If that goes to all people of color </v>
<v Speaker 2>equally,</v>

1473
01:08:31.281 --> 01:08:32.114
<v Speaker 2>that's not fair because these people of </v>
<v Speaker 2>color even more dIscriminating it so </v>

1474
01:08:34.251 --> 01:08:35.120
<v Speaker 2>they should get more of it.</v>

1475
01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:36.253
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fighting over a piece of a pie </v>

1476
01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:39.533
<v Speaker 2>of victim hood nus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the canadian term first nations </v>

1477
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:45.340
<v Speaker 2>first nation people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1478
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:46.243
<v Speaker 2>it's a better term because really </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking every single human being that </v>

1479
01:08:50.661 --> 01:08:53.360
<v Speaker 2>came to north America came from </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere else.</v>

1480
01:08:54.010 --> 01:08:56.400
<v Speaker 2>So it's just being a witch in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the fap,</v>

1481
01:08:56.410 --> 01:08:58.400
<v Speaker 2>since we're talking about in the fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodybuilding paper.</v>

1482
01:08:58.430 --> 01:08:59.263
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put in a star trek reference at the </v>

1483
01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.393
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love star trek.</v>

1484
01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:05.630
<v Speaker 2>I put in something like fat bodybuilding</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the final frontier for fat activism.</v>

1485
01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:06.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't like to go.</v>

1486
01:09:06.830 --> 01:09:07.663
<v Speaker 2>They didn't like that they said it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that we couldn't use the word </v>

1487
01:09:09.861 --> 01:09:14.861
<v Speaker 2>frontier because it evokes imagery of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the genocides America,</v>

1488
01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:18.020
<v Speaker 2>the american native americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to choose a different word.</v>

1489
01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:19.503
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1490
01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:22.220
<v Speaker 2>You're holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about frontier airlines,</v>

1491
01:09:22.221 --> 01:09:23.180
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's up with them?</v>

1492
01:09:23.181 --> 01:09:23.970
<v Speaker 2>They're in trouble.</v>

1493
01:09:23.970 --> 01:09:28.520
<v Speaker 2>Their whole worldview is so utterly </v>
<v Speaker 2>distorted and twisted and the things you</v>

1494
01:09:28.521 --> 01:09:30.590
<v Speaker 2>believe are totally untethered to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality,</v>

1495
01:09:30.710 --> 01:09:31.543
<v Speaker 2>but yet you believe there's knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You believe it's knowledge because it's </v>

1496
01:09:33.591 --> 01:09:36.080
<v Speaker 2>published and think about what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The students had picked this stuff up.</v>

1497
01:09:36.081 --> 01:09:37.490
<v Speaker 2>You go to college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you picked us up,</v>

1498
01:09:37.491 --> 01:09:40.160
<v Speaker 2>you start majoring in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could be majoring in something where</v>

1499
01:09:40.161 --> 01:09:42.020
<v Speaker 2>you actually learn to do critical </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

1500
01:09:42.021 --> 01:09:45.210
<v Speaker 2>to engage with ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your dIstrict,</v>

1501
01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:46.173
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're disadvantaged going into </v>

1502
01:09:47.421 --> 01:09:48.254
<v Speaker 2>college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's your best chance to get out of </v>

1503
01:09:49.431 --> 01:09:52.520
<v Speaker 2>that situation is to grapple with great </v>
<v Speaker 2>critical thinking.</v>

1504
01:09:52.850 --> 01:09:54.800
<v Speaker 2>Learn some great skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether that's,</v>

1505
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>engineering and the sciences,</v>

1506
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:57.703
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's even if it's you want to </v>

1507
01:09:58.881 --> 01:10:01.700
<v Speaker 2>get into like studying race in </v>
<v Speaker 2>sociology,</v>

1508
01:10:01.701 --> 01:10:02.534
<v Speaker 2>soft sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you want to get into just literature </v>

1509
01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:06.530
<v Speaker 2>do it honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to get somewhere,</v>

1510
01:10:06.531 --> 01:10:07.364
<v Speaker 2>but you get into this stuff where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can literally just make up your </v>

1511
01:10:08.901 --> 01:10:09.734
<v Speaker 2>conclusions.</v>

1512
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:10.663
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're teaching these people how to </v>

1513
01:10:11.451 --> 01:10:12.284
<v Speaker 2>think about problems or seeing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>burger and the santa monica pier is a </v>

1514
01:10:14.781 --> 01:10:17.450
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I see it everywhere I go after I did</v>

1515
01:10:17.451 --> 01:10:18.284
<v Speaker 2>this for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get the people in the habit of </v>

1516
01:10:20.511 --> 01:10:22.670
<v Speaker 2>seeing problems everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you helping them?</v>

1517
01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:25.640
<v Speaker 2>Are you getting them at a book about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this or anything?</v>

1518
01:10:25.730 --> 01:10:27.920
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might one day that's a great idea for</v>

1519
01:10:27.921 --> 01:10:28.754
<v Speaker 2>a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hard part is we could actually </v>

1520
01:10:30.021 --> 01:10:34.040
<v Speaker 2>probably write 10 books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so condensing it down to a book,</v>

1521
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:36.290
<v Speaker 2>usually you got an idea and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>blow it up to a book.</v>

1522
01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:40.880
<v Speaker 2>We have to condense this down to a book </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're talking about the problem,</v>

1523
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:44.490
<v Speaker 2>like just explaining what you've already</v>
<v Speaker 2>explained on this podcast and,</v>

1524
01:10:44.491 --> 01:10:45.324
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and actually having those studies that </v>

1525
01:10:47.481 --> 01:10:48.314
<v Speaker 2>you did publish and the whole thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>process behind creating them will be a </v>

1526
01:10:52.221 --> 01:10:52.990
<v Speaker 2>great book.</v>

1527
01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:57.920
<v Speaker 2>We got a documentary happening about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike nina is a documented tarian from,</v>

1528
01:10:57.921 --> 01:11:01.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Australia that got hooked up with a</v>

1529
01:11:01.570 --> 01:11:02.403
<v Speaker 2>z,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a white male.</v>

1530
01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.980
<v Speaker 2>He's not around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's half black,</v>

1531
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:07.250
<v Speaker 2>half black watch album.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How we met mike.</v>

1532
01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:08.151
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1533
01:11:08.151 --> 01:11:08.984
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because we were </v>

1534
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:11.383
<v Speaker 2>starting out this project and then we up</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking and we couldn't talk to anybody </v>

1535
01:11:15.571 --> 01:11:16.404
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard to keep a fucking secret </v>

1536
01:11:17.521 --> 01:11:18.241
<v Speaker 2>this big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1537
01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:20.730
<v Speaker 2>You just want to tell people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you aren't gonna believe what I'm doing.</v>

1538
01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:21.953
<v Speaker 2>Can't tell anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we fInd a few trusted friends were </v>

1539
01:11:24.211 --> 01:11:26.400
<v Speaker 2>telling us one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a buddy of ours,</v>

1540
01:11:26.401 --> 01:11:27.450
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

1541
01:11:27.451 --> 01:11:30.120
<v Speaker 2>I know a documentary ian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's making,</v>

1542
01:11:30.150 --> 01:11:33.450
<v Speaker 2>who's investigating all this shit going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on in the universities already.</v>

1543
01:11:33.451 --> 01:11:34.284
<v Speaker 2>He's already interested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you guys be interested in this </v>

1544
01:11:35.671 --> 01:11:36.504
<v Speaker 2>will be a compelling documentary?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you guys be interested in talking </v>

1545
01:11:38.611 --> 01:11:39.090
<v Speaker 2>to them?</v>

1546
01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:41.850
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get in touch with him and he's like,</v>

1547
01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:44.610
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1548
01:11:44.611 --> 01:11:45.840
<v Speaker 2>I'll shoot this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a,</v>

1549
01:11:45.841 --> 01:11:46.674
<v Speaker 2>there's a film here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're going to ruin your </v>

1550
01:11:47.701 --> 01:11:48.880
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's what I'm going to film.</v>

1551
01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:51.420
<v Speaker 2>But in any case I'll film this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the deal.</v>

1552
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:55.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm only going to shoot it if you commit</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent transparency.</v>

1553
01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.300
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell the full story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>

1554
01:11:57.301 --> 01:11:58.920
<v Speaker 2>what's really happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1555
01:11:58.921 --> 01:12:02.040
<v Speaker 2>we don't get to sugar coat anything and </v>
<v Speaker 2>make you guys look good.</v>

1556
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:04.200
<v Speaker 2>And of course he thought we were just </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna crash and burn.</v>

1557
01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:05.293
<v Speaker 2>That's the only reason I agreed to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sure that you guys got a torpedo </v>

1558
01:12:09.301 --> 01:12:10.710
<v Speaker 2>your careers like positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1559
01:12:10.711 --> 01:12:11.544
<v Speaker 2>And so he thought It was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and you'd have to convince us to </v>

1560
01:12:15.661 --> 01:12:18.120
<v Speaker 2>let him show it because we wouldn't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1561
01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:20.760
<v Speaker 2>But does he know that you don't work in </v>
<v Speaker 2>academia anymore?</v>

1562
01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:21.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1563
01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:22.800
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we were doing the project,</v>

1564
01:12:22.801 --> 01:12:24.750
<v Speaker 2>so we reached out to him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1565
01:12:24.810 --> 01:12:26.970
<v Speaker 2>through the mutual friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would it ruin your career?</v>

1566
01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:30.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I maybe would never get another job if I</v>

1567
01:12:30.361 --> 01:12:32.280
<v Speaker 2>wanted to go back into academia for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

1568
01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:34.560
<v Speaker 2>or I mean I still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't happened yet,</v>

1569
01:12:34.561 --> 01:12:35.394
<v Speaker 2>but you see people who do academic </v>
<v Speaker 2>misconduct get banned from ever </v>

1570
01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:42.180
<v Speaker 2>publishing academic papers again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could still come down for me.</v>

1571
01:12:42.181 --> 01:12:44.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it probably won't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it might.</v>

1572
01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:45.600
<v Speaker 2>And if it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you knoW,</v>

1573
01:12:45.601 --> 01:12:46.434
<v Speaker 2>then if I tried to get a job working for</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a think tank or university or </v>

1574
01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:52.110
<v Speaker 2>anything that depends on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm locked out of that now.</v>

1575
01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:54.440
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1576
01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:57.120
<v Speaker 2>especially it's going to ruin pizza </v>
<v Speaker 2>career too.</v>

1577
01:12:57.121 --> 01:12:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He works in,</v>

1578
01:12:58.350 --> 01:13:00.960
<v Speaker 2>he works in not just the university of </v>
<v Speaker 2>portland state,</v>

1579
01:13:00.961 --> 01:13:02.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like ground zero for you.</v>

1580
01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:05.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1581
01:13:05.101 --> 01:13:07.590
<v Speaker 2>It's going to happen when it's over for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1582
01:13:07.591 --> 01:13:11.430
<v Speaker 2>They're always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what's going to happen.</v>

1583
01:13:11.770 --> 01:13:12.603
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's best not to prognosticate too much </v>

1584
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:15.783
<v Speaker 2>with this stuff you see now we talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about bret weinstein and heather a </v>

1585
01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:23.610
<v Speaker 2>hiring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got firebombed right there.</v>

1586
01:13:23.611 --> 01:13:25.200
<v Speaker 2>Thing just blew up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blew the hell up.</v>

1587
01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:26.790
<v Speaker 2>And then they got pushed out of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs.</v>

1588
01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:28.073
<v Speaker 2>But in a sense it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I was talking to them </v>

1589
01:13:29.821 --> 01:13:30.654
<v Speaker 2>when we were in portland and it feels </v>
<v Speaker 2>like they kind of took the fall and </v>

1590
01:13:32.970 --> 01:13:33.870
<v Speaker 2>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

1591
01:13:33.871 --> 01:13:36.180
<v Speaker 2>that's too far and I don't know if </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the case or not,</v>

1592
01:13:36.181 --> 01:13:40.500
<v Speaker 2>but if so maybe that's too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>like pushing people out of their jobs,</v>

1593
01:13:40.501 --> 01:13:42.780
<v Speaker 2>like students patrolling the campus with</v>
<v Speaker 2>bats,</v>

1594
01:13:42.781 --> 01:13:44.460
<v Speaker 2>trying to find brett to pull them out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>his car.</v>

1595
01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:47.010
<v Speaker 2>If he showed up like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care who you are.</v>

1596
01:13:47.011 --> 01:13:49.490
<v Speaker 2>That's too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's not even civil society who</v>

1597
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:52.410
<v Speaker 2>thought that was too far though the </v>
<v Speaker 2>students is not there,</v>

1598
01:13:52.411 --> 01:13:54.630
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people saw this.</v>

1599
01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:56.850
<v Speaker 2>The role men is like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you think it was too far?</v>

1600
01:13:56.851 --> 01:13:58.630
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was insane.</v>

1601
01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.780
<v Speaker 2>I think the government should have come </v>
<v Speaker 2>in and shut down the school.</v>

1602
01:14:00.810 --> 01:14:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tons of people.</v>

1603
01:14:02.130 --> 01:14:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Tons of people around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like everyday people who saw this</v>

1604
01:14:04.981 --> 01:14:06.210
<v Speaker 2>story think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa shit,</v>

1605
01:14:06.211 --> 01:14:07.044
<v Speaker 2>this stuff's gone too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that they're allowing that guy </v>

1606
01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:10.400
<v Speaker 2>to remain as president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1607
01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:12.280
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely</v>

1608
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:14.350
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When there's that scene in the car,</v>

1609
01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:16.780
<v Speaker 1>wherever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conference room or wherever it was,</v>

1610
01:14:16.781 --> 01:14:17.614
<v Speaker 1>when the kids were telling him to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>his hands down because he's being </v>

1611
01:14:19.841 --> 01:14:20.674
<v Speaker 1>aggressive with his hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he puts his hands down and they start </v>

1612
01:14:22.901 --> 01:14:24.220
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1613
01:14:24.221 --> 01:14:28.180
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a system set up to where you can't</v>

1614
01:14:28.181 --> 01:14:29.680
<v Speaker 1>win is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deliberate,</v>

1615
01:14:29.681 --> 01:14:32.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's hilarious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were laughing at him.</v>

1616
01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.540
<v Speaker 1>He put his hands down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1617
01:14:34.541 --> 01:14:36.820
<v Speaker 1>stop making hand gestures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're being aggressive.</v>

1618
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:38.800
<v Speaker 1>He puts his hands down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started last.</v>

1619
01:14:38.810 --> 01:14:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Sorry last night and I didn't find it </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>

1620
01:14:40.491 --> 01:14:41.690
<v Speaker 1>I found it terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

1621
01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:44.350
<v Speaker 1>I find it terrifying for what it means </v>
<v Speaker 1>for all of us.</v>

1622
01:14:44.370 --> 01:14:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that.</v>

1623
01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:45.873
<v Speaker 1>If that can happen at a college campus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's where ideas are supposed </v>

1624
01:14:48.431 --> 01:14:50.230
<v Speaker 1>to be shared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust explored,</v>

1625
01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.420
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that can happen at a college campus,</v>

1626
01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:54.370
<v Speaker 1>everything's up for grabs at some point.</v>

1627
01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Was that college campuses really </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange?</v>

1628
01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:57.753
<v Speaker 1>It's really strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're struggling now and have radically </v>

1629
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:02.260
<v Speaker 1>radically down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1630
01:15:02.261 --> 01:15:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean they could literally go under </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of this.</v>

1631
01:15:05.711 --> 01:15:07.000
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it might happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1632
01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:09.940
<v Speaker 1>It's too bad because when it was doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1633
01:15:09.941 --> 01:15:10.774
<v Speaker 1>as brett was explaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a wonderful place to teach </v>

1634
01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:16.180
<v Speaker 1>because he could do whatever he really </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool stuff.</v>

1635
01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:19.170
<v Speaker 1>He could take them to the park and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do a class in the park.</v>

1636
01:15:19.230 --> 01:15:20.220
<v Speaker 1>They could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

1637
01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:22.150
<v Speaker 1>He could have a class where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1638
01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:23.980
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regardless of what he's teaching,</v>

1639
01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:27.250
<v Speaker 1>he could teach you about something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy field trips somewhere,</v>

1640
01:15:27.251 --> 01:15:28.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff,</v>

1641
01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:29.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adventures with the students,</v>

1642
01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:32.510
<v Speaker 1>the creator of the simpsons go there to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking simpsons.</v>

1643
01:15:32.770 --> 01:15:33.603
<v Speaker 1>I think he was an alum from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a shame because they're just </v>

1644
01:15:36.371 --> 01:15:40.610
<v Speaker 1>such decent people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just such great.</v>

1645
01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:43.150
<v Speaker 1>They're both great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're smart too,</v>

1646
01:15:43.151 --> 01:15:47.620
<v Speaker 1>so really legitimately smart and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiercely progressive,</v>

1647
01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:50.080
<v Speaker 1>progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decent humans.</v>

1648
01:15:50.230 --> 01:15:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Of course that means they're outright </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjacent.</v>

1649
01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Fucking hilarious man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people.</v>

1650
01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange time for ideas,</v>

1651
01:15:59.590 --> 01:16:02.040
<v Speaker 1>but I think this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also subs.</v>

1652
01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:03.183
<v Speaker 1>It's some sort of a symptom of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture that we live in where everyone </v>

1653
01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:13.030
<v Speaker 1>gets to voice their opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>EverYone feels entitled divorced because</v>

1654
01:16:13.031 --> 01:16:16.810
<v Speaker 1>of social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of this instantaneous ability to</v>

1655
01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:17.793
<v Speaker 1>post whatever you feel about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's a comment on youtube or a </v>

1656
01:16:21.311 --> 01:16:26.170
<v Speaker 1>tweet or a facebook post,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this nature of everyone putting in input</v>

1657
01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:29.290
<v Speaker 1>instead of earning your right to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard,</v>

1658
01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:30.493
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through merit and through your work and </v>

1659
01:16:32.771 --> 01:16:34.300
<v Speaker 1>through people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1660
01:16:34.301 --> 01:16:37.180
<v Speaker 1>this guy is smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this girl has great ideas,</v>

1661
01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:40.700
<v Speaker 1>this person really has some good points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's tom.</v>

1662
01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:41.583
<v Speaker 1>Tom nichols ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before we used to criticize people from </v>

1663
01:16:44.531 --> 01:16:45.364
<v Speaker 1>a point of expertise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now people who have absolutely no </v>

1664
01:16:47.531 --> 01:16:51.550
<v Speaker 1>expertise feel that they're entitled to </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only criticized,</v>

1665
01:16:51.551 --> 01:16:53.650
<v Speaker 1>but have everybody else listened to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticisms.</v>

1666
01:16:53.890 --> 01:16:56.050
<v Speaker 1>I think you're onto something with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social media,</v>

1667
01:16:56.051 --> 01:16:56.884
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you post something and it gets </v>

1668
01:16:57.761 --> 01:17:00.230
<v Speaker 1>like four interactions and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1669
01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:02.790
<v Speaker 1>How come joe rogan's thing got like </v>
<v Speaker 1>4,000?</v>

1670
01:17:02.830 --> 01:17:04.330
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1671
01:17:04.331 --> 01:17:08.140
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this like kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive jealousy kind of thing going</v>

1672
01:17:08.141 --> 01:17:10.100
<v Speaker 1>on and I think we've seen that a lot.</v>

1673
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:11.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these kind of,</v>

1674
01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:11.973
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who don't have a lot to bring to </v>

1675
01:17:12.921 --> 01:17:15.370
<v Speaker 2>the table and they want to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1676
01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:16.213
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's a spot on a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they want to get on a conference </v>

1677
01:17:19.671 --> 01:17:20.930
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speaker in a conference,</v>

1678
01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:23.060
<v Speaker 2>and we've seen this for years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens is,</v>

1679
01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:24.193
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you got some big name that's </v>

1680
01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:25.761
<v Speaker 2>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1681
01:17:25.761 --> 01:17:28.790
<v Speaker 2>let's just can him and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1682
01:17:28.791 --> 01:17:30.710
<v Speaker 2>he's a sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said this terrible thing.</v>

1683
01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:32.900
<v Speaker 2>Now he can't be at the conference or </v>
<v Speaker 2>will protest.</v>

1684
01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:34.153
<v Speaker 2>Get him out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put one of our guys in or when they </v>

1685
01:17:36.501 --> 01:17:37.610
<v Speaker 2>start to get more power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1686
01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:38.444
<v Speaker 2>let's make sure half of our people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>there or else we're going to make sure </v>

1687
01:17:40.701 --> 01:17:44.420
<v Speaker 2>that we sell your conferences racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then that becomeS like just a hot mess.</v>

1688
01:17:44.421 --> 01:17:47.150
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to go to the conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be financially soluble</v>

1689
01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:50.180
<v Speaker 2>so it falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this stuff has been going on.</v>

1690
01:17:50.181 --> 01:17:51.014
<v Speaker 2>This seems to be what's going on and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think you're touching something where </v>

1691
01:17:52.881 --> 01:17:53.714
<v Speaker 2>social media and tom nichols talks about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to generating a kind of narcissism </v>

1692
01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:00.530
<v Speaker 2>where people feel entitled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I have a voice.</v>

1693
01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:01.723
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's listening to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they should listen to me because </v>

1694
01:18:03.231 --> 01:18:05.030
<v Speaker 2>they of course think that their ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>are great</v>

1695
01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:08.710
<v Speaker 4>and the rise of social media coincides </v>
<v Speaker 4>with shutting down.</v>

1696
01:18:08.711 --> 01:18:13.030
<v Speaker 4>Speakers absolutely occurs on campus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't use to happen that way,</v>

1697
01:18:13.031 --> 01:18:13.864
<v Speaker 4>used to be even if people protested it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the speech went on and people debated </v>

1698
01:18:17.711 --> 01:18:18.544
<v Speaker 4>that person or the people got a chance </v>
<v Speaker 4>during the q and a section to challenge </v>

1699
01:18:21.611 --> 01:18:23.200
<v Speaker 4>these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it's all about.</v>

1700
01:18:23.260 --> 01:18:24.790
<v Speaker 4>What it's supposed to be all about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1701
01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:29.660
<v Speaker 4>If you have a problematic person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a person that you feel is at.</v>

1702
01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:30.573
<v Speaker 4>They have ideas that are questionable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You bring in a person whose ideas you </v>

1703
01:18:34.631 --> 01:18:35.464
<v Speaker 4>feel our counter and you let the </v>
<v Speaker 4>audience see how these individuals </v>

1704
01:18:41.111 --> 01:18:43.170
<v Speaker 4>discussed these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I was in highschool,</v>

1705
01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:48.270
<v Speaker 4>barney frank debated some guy from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a very conservative person.</v>

1706
01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:50.613
<v Speaker 4>I forget what the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a ridiculous conservative </v>

1707
01:18:54.071 --> 01:18:56.920
<v Speaker 4>group that had some really funny name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1708
01:18:56.921 --> 01:18:59.160
<v Speaker 4>I forgot what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was like,</v>

1709
01:18:59.170 --> 01:19:00.820
<v Speaker 4>this really can.</v>

1710
01:19:00.850 --> 01:19:04.420
<v Speaker 4>Ronald reagan style conservative and </v>
<v Speaker 4>barney frank was.</v>

1711
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:06.520
<v Speaker 4>I think he was still in the closet back </v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

1712
01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:07.593
<v Speaker 4>but he was this like very articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful left wing guy and they did it </v>

1713
01:19:13.991 --> 01:19:18.991
<v Speaker 4>inside this a community center in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>high school,</v>

1714
01:19:19.091 --> 01:19:20.020
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1715
01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:25.090
<v Speaker 4>some auditorium.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I got a chance to watch this one guy</v>

1716
01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.950
<v Speaker 4>talk about all these different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you know,</v>

1717
01:19:27.970 --> 01:19:30.490
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gay marriage or whatever is conservative</v>

1718
01:19:30.491 --> 01:19:31.324
<v Speaker 4>ideas and values and a marriage should </v>
<v Speaker 4>be between a man and a woman and all </v>

1719
01:19:34.661 --> 01:19:39.160
<v Speaker 4>these different things that would today </v>
<v Speaker 4>at a lot of college campuses,</v>

1720
01:19:39.161 --> 01:19:42.550
<v Speaker 4>you'd want those shutdowns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want someone propagating these</v>

1721
01:19:42.551 --> 01:19:43.384
<v Speaker 4>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but barney frank came on after him and </v>

1722
01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:46.773
<v Speaker 4>eloquently dissected what was stupid </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it and what the constitution is </v>

1723
01:19:50.951 --> 01:19:51.784
<v Speaker 4>all about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What makes America great is our freedom </v>

1724
01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:56.920
<v Speaker 4>and our ability to express ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by doing so,</v>

1725
01:19:56.921 --> 01:20:01.921
<v Speaker 4>me as a 16 year old kid and the audience</v>
<v Speaker 4>got to see ideas,</v>

1726
01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:07.680
<v Speaker 4>dissected and ideas debated and see two </v>
<v Speaker 4>people from polar opposite perspectives.</v>

1727
01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:14.370
<v Speaker 4>just battle it out and let the best idea</v>
<v Speaker 4>win.</v>

1728
01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:15.353
<v Speaker 4>And I'm sure there was probably some </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that were in that audience that </v>

1729
01:20:18.061 --> 01:20:19.890
<v Speaker 4>came out of it with a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective.</v>

1730
01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:20.963
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1731
01:20:20.970 --> 01:20:23.310
<v Speaker 4>gay people shouldn't get married and </v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1732
01:20:23.311 --> 01:20:25.470
<v Speaker 4>marriage is supposed to be between a man</v>
<v Speaker 4>and woman.</v>

1733
01:20:25.471 --> 01:20:27.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure of it.</v>

1734
01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:29.580
<v Speaker 4>And that's what happens in a democracy.</v>

1735
01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:32.210
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about the very foundation</v>

1736
01:20:32.211 --> 01:20:33.044
<v Speaker 2>of liberal society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about John Stuart mill </v>

1737
01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:35.690
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1738
01:20:35.690 --> 01:20:39.890
<v Speaker 2>did you talking about John Adams?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about the foundation of a</v>

1739
01:20:39.891 --> 01:20:43.140
<v Speaker 2>liberal society here and that's what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>scholarship runs that were.</v>

1740
01:20:43.190 --> 01:20:44.990
<v Speaker 2>We looked at runs directly counter to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1741
01:20:44.991 --> 01:20:48.320
<v Speaker 2>Remember the idea is that if people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting out language,</v>

1742
01:20:48.530 --> 01:20:52.850
<v Speaker 2>the idea that some people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come away with a heteronormative idea or</v>

1743
01:20:52.851 --> 01:20:55.940
<v Speaker 2>a homophobic idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's already a catastrophe.</v>

1744
01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:57.050
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show.</v>

1745
01:20:57.051 --> 01:20:57.884
<v Speaker 2>We can't allow it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to pull the speaker wires like </v>

1746
01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:01.460
<v Speaker 2>demora event we've got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't let that go on.</v>

1747
01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:02.353
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's my point is like what happened </v>

1748
01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:05.673
<v Speaker 4>where know these kind of interactions </v>
<v Speaker 4>between contrary ideas is so it's so </v>

1749
01:21:13.971 --> 01:21:18.440
<v Speaker 4>dangerous that one or two people could </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibly be shifted.</v>

1750
01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:20.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean even if it's thirtY percent of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the audience,</v>

1751
01:21:20.391 --> 01:21:21.224
<v Speaker 4>I mean who the fuck knows what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's gonna happen when people are </v>

1752
01:21:22.791 --> 01:21:26.030
<v Speaker 4>sitting there listening and who's to say</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're right or you're wrong,</v>

1753
01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:30.320
<v Speaker 4>that the way to challenge ideas is not </v>
<v Speaker 4>pulling the plug on the speakers.</v>

1754
01:21:30.530 --> 01:21:31.750
<v Speaker 4>It's a better ideas.</v>

1755
01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:32.653
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you fundamentally subscribed to the </v>

1756
01:21:34.341 --> 01:21:35.174
<v Speaker 2>idea that heteronormativity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's use it as the example of </v>

1757
01:21:38.331 --> 01:21:39.164
<v Speaker 2>heteronormativity is the power structure</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's holding down gay people and </v>

1758
01:21:41.751 --> 01:21:43.790
<v Speaker 2>preventing them from having equal </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities.</v>

1759
01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:47.960
<v Speaker 2>If you fundamentally believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody else getting convinced,</v>

1760
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.823
<v Speaker 2>anybody being reinforcement of the idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>of heteronormativity isn't just a few </v>

1761
01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:54.890
<v Speaker 2>like 70 percent changed their mind and </v>
<v Speaker 2>30 percent stuck with it.</v>

1762
01:21:55.190 --> 01:22:00.190
<v Speaker 2>That's just bolstering the already </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagined to be completely dominant view.</v>

1763
01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.300
<v Speaker 2>It's really kind of anti progress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1764
01:22:02.301 --> 01:22:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Because it views the idea that power </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures can't change.</v>

1765
01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:08.660
<v Speaker 2>They're always rooted in some identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoever has,</v>

1766
01:22:08.661 --> 01:22:10.880
<v Speaker 2>you know there's more straight people </v>
<v Speaker 2>than gay people are.</v>

1767
01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:13.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so therefore straight people always have</v>

1768
01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:14.803
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Therefore anything that reinforces </v>

1769
01:22:16.941 --> 01:22:18.740
<v Speaker 2>heteronormativity is going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe.</v>

1770
01:22:18.741 --> 01:22:19.574
<v Speaker 2>That reinforces the next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are going to be beating gays in </v>

1771
01:22:21.441 --> 01:22:22.274
<v Speaker 2>the snow or something</v>

1772
01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:23.213
<v Speaker 4>that it's also the complete infant </v>
<v Speaker 4>stylization of young adults because </v>

1773
01:22:28.090 --> 01:22:28.923
<v Speaker 4>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're telling me these young adults </v>

1774
01:22:30.661 --> 01:22:33.920
<v Speaker 4>aren't smart enough to dIfferentiate </v>
<v Speaker 4>between good ideas and bad ideas.</v>

1775
01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:34.853
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're learning all this grievance </v>

1776
01:22:35.611 --> 01:22:36.444
<v Speaker 2>study stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just said their critical thinking is </v>

1777
01:22:37.921 --> 01:22:38.754
<v Speaker 2>getting hobbled,</v>

1778
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:42.660
<v Speaker 4>but if you're a person who's a young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>progressive,</v>

1779
01:22:42.661 --> 01:22:43.494
<v Speaker 4>well read person who's got some rock </v>
<v Speaker 4>solid ideas about people being able to </v>

1780
01:22:49.141 --> 01:22:49.974
<v Speaker 4>live their lives without discrimination </v>
<v Speaker 4>and all the things that I'm sure we all </v>

1781
01:22:53.431 --> 01:22:54.264
<v Speaker 4>agree on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you sat and listened to some right </v>

1782
01:22:57.331 --> 01:23:00.810
<v Speaker 4>wing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alright asshole spewing hate.</v>

1783
01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:03.000
<v Speaker 4>Is it going to change you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna affect you.</v>

1784
01:23:03.090 --> 01:23:05.950
<v Speaker 4>Of course it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So who is it going to affect?</v>

1785
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:09.490
<v Speaker 3>Like who?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are these ideas going to reach?</v>

1786
01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:14.610
<v Speaker 3>Why do we assume that people are so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>more easily influenced than we are?</v>

1787
01:23:15.820 --> 01:23:17.350
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is that about?</v>

1788
01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:21.460
<v Speaker 3>this isn't this infant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Teleportation is young adults.</v>

1789
01:23:22.610 --> 01:23:25.090
<v Speaker 3>Kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking nerve in the world.</v>

1790
01:23:25.091 --> 01:23:28.740
<v Speaker 3>And sharp corners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got to put a fucking cane off and hide.</v>

1791
01:23:28.741 --> 01:23:30.190
<v Speaker 3>Just published that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A book,</v>

1792
01:23:30.191 --> 01:23:33.480
<v Speaker 3>the coddling of the american mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1793
01:23:33.740 --> 01:23:35.120
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1794
01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:36.243
<v Speaker 3>I think if you look at [inaudible] work </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the heterodox academy and he's </v>

1795
01:23:39.191 --> 01:23:42.700
<v Speaker 3>fighting for this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have infant infantilize people,</v>

1796
01:23:42.730 --> 01:23:46.000
<v Speaker 3>we've have infantilized students and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

1797
01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:48.370
<v Speaker 3>I hope that the tide changing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1798
01:23:48.371 --> 01:23:49.204
<v Speaker 3>one of the things we wanted to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this project is give people the </v>

1799
01:23:51.881 --> 01:23:53.980
<v Speaker 3>opportunity to speak out and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1800
01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:55.053
<v Speaker 3>they don't speak for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to hear what someone has to say </v>

1801
01:23:57.071 --> 01:23:58.800
<v Speaker 3>about immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other side,</v>

1802
01:23:58.810 --> 01:23:59.643
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote I want to hear which I </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to hear the best arguments because </v>

1803
01:24:02.501 --> 01:24:05.280
<v Speaker 3>then I want to engage them myself and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1804
01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:07.990
<v Speaker 3>I also think that we should have people </v>
<v Speaker 3>of all.</v>

1805
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:13.270
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a problem that people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>go into teaching.</v>

1806
01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:17.080
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember what the study I read </v>
<v Speaker 3>the overwhelming percentage of people,</v>

1807
01:24:17.081 --> 01:24:19.060
<v Speaker 3>college educators are on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on the left.</v>

1808
01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:22.600
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that they need diverse voices.</v>

1809
01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:24.073
<v Speaker 3>diversity also has to be ideological </v>
<v Speaker 3>diversity and if you want people to be </v>

1810
01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:31.630
<v Speaker 3>less brittle and if you want people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be less infantilized,</v>

1811
01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:34.090
<v Speaker 3>they have to hear the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have to hear.</v>

1812
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:35.223
<v Speaker 3>This is also a mills' idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to hear it from people who </v>

1813
01:24:37.451 --> 01:24:38.284
<v Speaker 3>believe it.</v>

1814
01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:43.160
<v Speaker 2>That's in John Stuart mill's book on </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberty is it's not enough to have heard</v>

1815
01:24:43.161 --> 01:24:44.020
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other side.</v>

1816
01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.193
<v Speaker 2>The argument from the other side exists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to hear the best case put </v>

1817
01:24:47.631 --> 01:24:48.464
<v Speaker 2>forward by people who really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really subscribed to it and then work </v>

1818
01:24:50.631 --> 01:24:53.990
<v Speaker 2>against that if you can defeat that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than it deserves to be defeated.</v>

1819
01:24:53.991 --> 01:24:54.760
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1820
01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:57.710
<v Speaker 2>and this is the thing I think in </v>
<v Speaker 2>general,</v>

1821
01:24:57.711 --> 01:24:58.544
<v Speaker 2>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all put forth our best ideas and </v>

1822
01:24:59.811 --> 01:25:01.310
<v Speaker 2>we're all wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>MosT of the time we're all.</v>

1823
01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:03.290
<v Speaker 2>We can be a smart guy or a smart woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1824
01:25:03.291 --> 01:25:06.020
<v Speaker 2>We're all pretty stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We put forth a lot of ideas.</v>

1825
01:25:06.650 --> 01:25:08.630
<v Speaker 2>Most of them are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true for everybody,</v>

1826
01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:09.471
<v Speaker 2>true for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

1827
01:25:09.471 --> 01:25:13.250
<v Speaker 2>everybody and what we should really be </v>
<v Speaker 2>relying on his.</v>

1828
01:25:13.251 --> 01:25:14.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put it on an idea and you're like,</v>

1829
01:25:14.541 --> 01:25:15.440
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>

1830
01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:19.100
<v Speaker 2>And so we start cutting away the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit that I tuck tucked into my idea</v>

1831
01:25:19.101 --> 01:25:20.180
<v Speaker 2>of the stuff I didn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1832
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:23.990
<v Speaker 2>We do that and now the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>survives that process is better,</v>

1833
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:25.730
<v Speaker 2>and then somebody else comes along and </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

1834
01:25:25.731 --> 01:25:26.121
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1835
01:25:26.121 --> 01:25:26.954
<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That part's probably a little bit </v>

1836
01:25:27.381 --> 01:25:28.214
<v Speaker 2>bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this you could add to it and then </v>

1837
01:25:29.231 --> 01:25:30.064
<v Speaker 2>make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then some of that's wrong and this </v>

1838
01:25:31.401 --> 01:25:35.150
<v Speaker 2>is the process of how we really produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge and it's a co two.</v>

1839
01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:36.253
<v Speaker 2>That's what gives us a vibrant culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>to write it as opposed to what we see </v>

1840
01:25:39.111 --> 01:25:40.760
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I can we,</v>

1841
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:42.230
<v Speaker 2>the three of us can make up a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion,</v>

1842
01:25:42.231 --> 01:25:45.410
<v Speaker 2>write a paper to support it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then if you criticize it,</v>

1843
01:25:45.770 --> 01:25:46.603
<v Speaker 2>you had to have criticized it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were sexist or because you were </v>

1844
01:25:48.981 --> 01:25:49.814
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do a scientific test that shows </v>

1845
01:25:51.681 --> 01:25:52.514
<v Speaker 2>that it's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the science must have been sexist or </v>

1846
01:25:54.711 --> 01:25:57.710
<v Speaker 2>racist or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you're doing that,</v>

1847
01:25:57.711 --> 01:26:00.080
<v Speaker 2>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really in the weeds,</v>

1848
01:26:00.110 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 2>you're not helping anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we need to study areas,</v>

1849
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:05.620
<v Speaker 1>gender and race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we need to do it.</v>

1850
01:26:05.621 --> 01:26:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1851
01:26:06.561 --> 01:26:10.640
<v Speaker 1>And we need to do it freely where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could just talk and you don't,</v>

1852
01:26:10.641 --> 01:26:11.474
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get accused of all sorts of </v>

1853
01:26:12.891 --> 01:26:14.930
<v Speaker 1>horrible transgressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1854
01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:17.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the culture that I,</v>

1855
01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.970
<v Speaker 1>that we want to see in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the culture we have.</v>

1856
01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:21.090
<v Speaker 1>Well I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1857
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:23.890
<v Speaker 1>everyone is railing against identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

1858
01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:26.960
<v Speaker 1>I think we can all agree identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics are a huge problem,</v>

1859
01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:28.033
<v Speaker 1>but another problem that goes along with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hand in hand is identifying </v>

1860
01:26:31.821 --> 01:26:36.821
<v Speaker 1>personally with ideas where these ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>are connected to your ego identity.</v>

1861
01:26:37.810 --> 01:26:38.643
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1862
01:26:39.770 --> 01:26:40.603
<v Speaker 1>Did you call everybody'S wrong about god</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it sounds like I'm just going to go </v>

1863
01:26:44.451 --> 01:26:45.284
<v Speaker 1>after religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually the culmination of my </v>

1864
01:26:46.791 --> 01:26:51.791
<v Speaker 1>study of religious psychology and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>really what it was was targeting pr.</v>

1865
01:26:53.281 --> 01:26:54.114
<v Speaker 1>I mean it talks about what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>with religion and why people believe </v>

1866
01:26:56.181 --> 01:26:57.014
<v Speaker 1>religion and what god actually stands </v>
<v Speaker 1>for in terms of psychology as it might </v>

1867
01:27:00.591 --> 01:27:03.350
<v Speaker 1>see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then what was really targeting was I</v>

1868
01:27:03.351 --> 01:27:05.220
<v Speaker 1>saw all these people who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1869
01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:06.073
<v Speaker 1>loud mouth atheists and they were like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and that and the other thing and </v>

1870
01:27:08.441 --> 01:27:09.760
<v Speaker 1>they have this whole community and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw,</v>

1871
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:11.360
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing the same thing.</v>

1872
01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:12.373
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing the same thing and what </v>

1873
01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:15.920
<v Speaker 1>are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're identifying as an atheist,</v>

1874
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:18.380
<v Speaker 1>I am an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

1875
01:27:18.381 --> 01:27:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a good atheist.</v>

1876
01:27:19.730 --> 01:27:22.060
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck do you be a good atheist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

1877
01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:26.000
<v Speaker 1>You remember atheism plus atheism plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>was exactly what I was looking at.</v>

1878
01:27:26.570 --> 01:27:27.403
<v Speaker 1>Favorite was live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watched a whole speech like smoking a </v>

1879
01:27:31.911 --> 01:27:32.744
<v Speaker 1>joint and laughing my fucking ass off at</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dork who is speaking in front of </v>

1880
01:27:36.561 --> 01:27:41.561
<v Speaker 1>some other group of dorks that we're all</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the atheism plus movement and he</v>

1881
01:27:41.571 --> 01:27:42.404
<v Speaker 1>just kept just ranting about sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>harassment and diversity and all these </v>

1882
01:27:48.681 --> 01:27:51.230
<v Speaker 1>different things and attaching them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist.</v>

1883
01:27:51.231 --> 01:27:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motherfucker.</v>

1884
01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:54.370
<v Speaker 1>You're making your own religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1885
01:27:55.420 --> 01:27:56.780
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

1886
01:27:56.781 --> 01:27:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe rogan saw straight through.</v>

1887
01:27:58.671 --> 01:28:03.671
<v Speaker 1>It was so fun because the guy was such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtue signaling little weasel.</v>

1888
01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

1889
01:28:05.751 --> 01:28:08.520
<v Speaker 1>It was sneaky fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1890
01:28:08.521 --> 01:28:10.800
<v Speaker 1>a little sneaky fucker that was trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get girls to like him.</v>

1891
01:28:10.810 --> 01:28:12.290
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

1892
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:15.020
<v Speaker 1>you see what it is though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to be a good atheist.</v>

1893
01:28:15.021 --> 01:28:15.711
<v Speaker 1>How do I do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1894
01:28:15.711 --> 01:28:18.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because atheist means don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe stuff of a certain kind,</v>

1895
01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:23.860
<v Speaker 1>so they have to start plus plus what </v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice.</v>

1896
01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:25.700
<v Speaker 1>How did that died off because it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

1897
01:28:25.730 --> 01:28:27.710
<v Speaker 1>but those people are still grumbling </v>
<v Speaker 1>around or whatever.</v>

1898
01:28:27.711 --> 01:28:29.180
<v Speaker 1>BuT what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1899
01:28:29.181 --> 01:28:31.550
<v Speaker 1>they got a whole blog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They play about her project.</v>

1900
01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said,</v>

1901
01:28:33.930 --> 01:28:35.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're straight white men.</v>

1902
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:36.223
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're a straight white man were </v>

1903
01:28:36.850 --> 01:28:40.040
<v Speaker 1>therefore we have bad motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motivations.</v>

1904
01:28:40.041 --> 01:28:44.120
<v Speaker 1>That's we get all time because we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight white men because bad bad white</v>

1905
01:28:44.121 --> 01:28:44.954
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight white men are basically like a </v>

1906
01:28:46.101 --> 01:28:46.934
<v Speaker 1>little arrow running around looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>vaginas and anything you say is </v>

1907
01:28:51.141 --> 01:28:55.070
<v Speaker 1>basically just a little sneaky way for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to get inside of a vagina and all of</v>

1908
01:28:55.071 --> 01:28:56.030
<v Speaker 1>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

1909
01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:59.780
<v Speaker 1>you just try making your way through </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

1910
01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:01.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a little ironic when you Put it </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>

1911
01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:03.750
<v Speaker 2>just what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1912
01:29:03.751 --> 01:29:05.900
<v Speaker 2>But the truth is though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if they think that the.</v>

1913
01:29:06.050 --> 01:29:06.883
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is the article of faith </v>
<v Speaker 2>years that privilege exists and always </v>

1914
01:29:09.061 --> 01:29:11.190
<v Speaker 2>preserves itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're straight white men.</v>

1915
01:29:11.191 --> 01:29:15.150
<v Speaker 2>We criticized what supposed to be but </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't social justice work?</v>

1916
01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:16.710
<v Speaker 2>It's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Social justice work,</v>

1917
01:29:16.711 --> 01:29:19.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>capital social justice screwed up.</v>

1918
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:21.960
<v Speaker 2>So we criticize that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Therefore why we must be,</v>

1919
01:29:21.961 --> 01:29:25.190
<v Speaker 2>because we're white man trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation or standard.</v>

1920
01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:26.940
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys are a problem.</v>

1921
01:29:26.970 --> 01:29:30.210
<v Speaker 2>that was the depth of their analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given that they're,</v>

1922
01:29:30.211 --> 01:29:31.044
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some of them are professors and </v>

1923
01:29:32.071 --> 01:29:33.490
<v Speaker 2>stuff that's the best they could come up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1924
01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:35.310
<v Speaker 2>been better to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

1925
01:29:36.230 --> 01:29:37.063
<v Speaker 2>there's a problem here and we want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>study this stuff and we need to clean </v>

1926
01:29:40.111 --> 01:29:42.660
<v Speaker 2>house and thank you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we appreciate it,</v>

1927
01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:43.673
<v Speaker 2>but you would have to step so far out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your belief system and be so objective </v>

1928
01:29:48.301 --> 01:29:49.134
<v Speaker 2>and so self aware that you're realizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in some sort of a preposterous </v>

1929
01:29:52.531 --> 01:29:57.210
<v Speaker 2>group and very few people are willing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>admit that most of their life's work has</v>

1930
01:29:57.211 --> 01:29:58.044
<v Speaker 2>been nonsense.</v>

1931
01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:58.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you geT rewarded for </v>

1932
01:30:00.421 --> 01:30:01.890
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get promoted for that.</v>

1933
01:30:01.891 --> 01:30:04.830
<v Speaker 2>you get accolades from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You carry status and privilege.</v>

1934
01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:05.873
<v Speaker 2>Look at me when people join some fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>wacky caught like they don't join it </v>

1935
01:30:09.751 --> 01:30:10.290
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1936
01:30:10.290 --> 01:30:11.760
<v Speaker 2>this is bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it'll be fun.</v>

1937
01:30:12.090 --> 01:30:12.923
<v Speaker 2>They didn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They buy into it and this is no </v>

1938
01:30:16.351 --> 01:30:18.570
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what we're talking about,</v>

1939
01:30:18.571 --> 01:30:19.404
<v Speaker 2>about ideologies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how people they lock into these </v>

1940
01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:22.374
<v Speaker 2>predetermined patterns of thinking and </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior and this is what's happening </v>

1941
01:30:25.021 --> 01:30:25.854
<v Speaker 2>here and it's very much like a call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very much like any other group </v>

1942
01:30:29.701 --> 01:30:30.534
<v Speaker 2>think sort of environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like scientology grew up in the </v>

1943
01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:34.494
<v Speaker 2>university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so everything they put out about </v>

1944
01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:37.343
<v Speaker 2>threatens and volcanoes or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got all of a sudden that's not </v>

1945
01:30:39.601 --> 01:30:41.280
<v Speaker 2>like just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1946
01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.680
<v Speaker 2>l ron hubbard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it dianetics or whatever.</v>

1947
01:30:44.010 --> 01:30:47.550
<v Speaker 2>That's gold standard knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Academic press,</v>

1948
01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:48.713
<v Speaker 2>oxford.</v>

1949
01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:50.310
<v Speaker 2>So you get a degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1950
01:30:50.311 --> 01:30:52.530
<v Speaker 2>And then you get to teach it and as </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>

1951
01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:54.900
<v Speaker 2>Somebody wrote an article criticizing us</v>
<v Speaker 2>history and they're like,</v>

1952
01:30:54.930 --> 01:30:56.070
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't understand.</v>

1953
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:57.143
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they thInk we just talked to each other </v>

1954
01:30:57.781 --> 01:30:59.820
<v Speaker 2>in a bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talk to policymakers,</v>

1955
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.460
<v Speaker 2>we talked to media and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no shit.</v>

1956
01:31:02.461 --> 01:31:03.680
<v Speaker 2>That's why we did this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1957
01:31:03.690 --> 01:31:04.523
<v Speaker 2>when you talk to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do talk to other people you are </v>

1958
01:31:07.021 --> 01:31:08.650
<v Speaker 2>running into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1959
01:31:08.770 --> 01:31:09.603
<v Speaker 2>per sorry hr departments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're telling them how to do the </v>

1960
01:31:11.971 --> 01:31:16.170
<v Speaker 2>diversity officers and all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>institutional and talk to policymakers.</v>

1961
01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:17.033
<v Speaker 2>I get emails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you saw a year before </v>

1962
01:31:18.811 --> 01:31:20.400
<v Speaker 2>all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did this really,</v>

1963
01:31:20.401 --> 01:31:21.234
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad attempt at it called conceptual </v>

1964
01:31:22.231 --> 01:31:23.064
<v Speaker 2>penis as a social construct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we said that penIses are social </v>

1965
01:31:26.281 --> 01:31:30.330
<v Speaker 2>constructs and they cause climate change</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this got a little bit of attention.</v>

1966
01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:31.493
<v Speaker 2>I've been getting emails ever since then</v>
<v Speaker 2>from some member of eu parliament and </v>

1967
01:31:34.951 --> 01:31:35.784
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have another gender initiative that </v>

1968
01:31:37.261 --> 01:31:38.094
<v Speaker 2>we're going to try to basically foist </v>
<v Speaker 2>upon you and then it's going to like </v>

1969
01:31:41.190 --> 01:31:45.420
<v Speaker 2>dictate how europe now works with africa</v>
<v Speaker 2>going forward about climate.</v>

1970
01:31:45.630 --> 01:31:46.463
<v Speaker 2>And so because I wrote this conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 2>penis and climate change thing and it's </v>

1971
01:31:48.481 --> 01:31:49.231
<v Speaker 2>all based on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1972
01:31:49.231 --> 01:31:51.690
<v Speaker 2>making fun of gender studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was at the time anyway,</v>

1973
01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:53.580
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1974
01:31:53.581 --> 01:31:55.490
<v Speaker 2>you're an expert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now that you use colomy,</v>

1975
01:31:55.530 --> 01:31:56.363
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we do about this gender </v>

1976
01:31:57.091 --> 01:31:58.440
<v Speaker 2>initiative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's real,</v>

1977
01:31:58.441 --> 01:31:58.851
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1978
01:31:58.851 --> 01:32:02.280

1979
01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:03.420
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1980
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:07.150
<v Speaker 2>it's not like a meeting of some dorks at</v>
<v Speaker 2>a conference that's real.</v>

1981
01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:10.860
<v Speaker 2>They're coming up with policy to dictate</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they want to interact with,</v>

1982
01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:13.720
<v Speaker 2>with africa for the next 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years.</v>

1983
01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:15.303
<v Speaker 2>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these people are emailing me saying </v>

1984
01:32:17.051 --> 01:32:20.440
<v Speaker 2>this scholarship that you guys are </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticizing is really,</v>

1985
01:32:20.441 --> 01:32:23.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on the agenda of the eu parliament.</v>

1986
01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:25.840
<v Speaker 2>So help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

1987
01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:26.973
<v Speaker 2>well it seems like what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we have here is sort of a wave of </v>

1988
01:32:30.101 --> 01:32:31.180
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1989
01:32:31.330 --> 01:32:35.140
<v Speaker 2>It goes in and it goes out and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going back and forth and you,</v>

1990
01:32:35.170 --> 01:32:36.003
<v Speaker 2>you need this sort of balancing act and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are great things need to go so </v>

1991
01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:42.873
<v Speaker 2>haywire that people step in and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm pulling my fucking kids at </v>

1992
01:32:47.050 --> 01:32:48.330
<v Speaker 2>evergreen state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1993
01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:49.950
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>

1994
01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:53.710
<v Speaker 2>That's a great example of a place that </v>
<v Speaker 2>went too far.</v>

1995
01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:56.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what we don't want to have happen is</v>

1996
01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:57.393
<v Speaker 2>we don't want people to pull their kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the universities know because </v>

1997
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:01.510
<v Speaker 2>there are some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the university,</v>

1998
01:33:01.511 --> 01:33:04.090
<v Speaker 2>but these departments don't major in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1999
01:33:04.090 --> 01:33:05.400
<v Speaker 2>Don't major in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's which,</v>

2000
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:07.450
<v Speaker 2>which department?</v>
<v Speaker 2>specific gender studies.</v>

2001
01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:09.070
<v Speaker 2>Critical race studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural studies,</v>

2002
01:33:09.071 --> 01:33:11.410
<v Speaker 2>queer theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat studies.</v>

2003
01:33:11.411 --> 01:33:15.760
<v Speaker 2>If it happens to have one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read a biography of guy who teaches</v>

2004
01:33:15.761 --> 01:33:17.680
<v Speaker 2>critical whiteness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2005
01:33:17.681 --> 01:33:22.120
<v Speaker 2>CrItical whiteness is a thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually there was a journal and then it</v>

2006
01:33:22.121 --> 01:33:22.954
<v Speaker 2>got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It got so out there that it got </v>

2007
01:33:24.071 --> 01:33:27.040
<v Speaker 2>criticized out of existence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a big thing.</v>

2008
01:33:27.190 --> 01:33:30.970
<v Speaker 2>There's some big paper I was reading </v>
<v Speaker 2>just before we went public with all this</v>

2009
01:33:31.150 --> 01:33:31.983
<v Speaker 2>and I got asked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luckily I read it because we did the </v>

2010
01:33:33.851 --> 01:33:36.070
<v Speaker 2>mind calm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course Israel is like,</v>

2011
01:33:36.071 --> 01:33:37.720
<v Speaker 2>you got mine comp published.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god,</v>

2012
01:33:37.721 --> 01:33:40.060
<v Speaker 2>we need to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel tv.</v>

2013
01:33:41.250 --> 01:33:43.630
<v Speaker 2>I was on israeli tv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the hell?</v>

2014
01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:44.613
<v Speaker 2>And so all these israeli journalist or </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling me talking to me about it and </v>

2015
01:33:48.250 --> 01:33:50.200
<v Speaker 2>over the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>confident I read this one paper.</v>

2016
01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:50.801
<v Speaker 2>They're lIke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2017
01:33:50.801 --> 01:33:52.810
<v Speaker 2>do you think that jewish studies is like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

2018
01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:55.300
<v Speaker 2>And I found this paper just before this </v>
<v Speaker 2>all came out.</v>

2019
01:33:55.301 --> 01:33:56.134
<v Speaker 2>There was jewish studies criticizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>critical whiteness studies because </v>

2020
01:33:59.381 --> 01:34:00.214
<v Speaker 2>there's this whole thing about how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>critical whiteness people who accused </v>

2021
01:34:02.441 --> 01:34:04.360
<v Speaker 2>the jews of being white and then there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this,</v>

2022
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:05.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>

2023
01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:07.910
<v Speaker 2>where does the oppression like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>

2024
01:34:08.260 --> 01:34:12.520
<v Speaker 2>the jews have had it pretty rough over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last 2000 years or thereabouts,</v>

2025
01:34:13.570 --> 01:34:15.790
<v Speaker 2>but then you've got the critical </v>
<v Speaker 2>whiteness people being like,</v>

2026
01:34:15.791 --> 01:34:17.080
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're white,</v>

2027
01:34:17.420 --> 01:34:18.640
<v Speaker 2>it's a white privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

2028
01:34:18.650 --> 01:34:19.483
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the jewish studies people are </v>

2029
01:34:21.011 --> 01:34:22.300
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold up,</v>

2030
01:34:22.330 --> 01:34:23.163
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't put us up here and say that we're </v>

2031
01:34:25.361 --> 01:34:27.100
<v Speaker 2>all white supremacists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2032
01:34:27.101 --> 01:34:29.070
<v Speaker 2>we were gassed by the white </v>
<v Speaker 2>supremacists.</v>

2033
01:34:29.110 --> 01:34:31.360
<v Speaker 2>You chill out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's this huge,</v>

2034
01:34:31.361 --> 01:34:32.194
<v Speaker 2>like critical studies fight between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>jewish studies people and the critical </v>

2035
01:34:35.981 --> 01:34:36.814
<v Speaker 2>whiteness people over whether jews count</v>
<v Speaker 2>as white people are not and have white </v>

2036
01:34:39.491 --> 01:34:40.480
<v Speaker 2>supremacy built in.</v>

2037
01:34:41.110 --> 01:34:43.330
<v Speaker 2>And they asked me about thIs israeli </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalist said.</v>

2038
01:34:43.331 --> 01:34:43.781
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2039
01:34:43.781 --> 01:34:47.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to sympathize with what their,</v>

2040
01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:47.973
<v Speaker 2>their argument is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're still using the same broken </v>

2041
01:34:49.271 --> 01:34:50.104
<v Speaker 2>methods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you still want to see better </v>

2042
01:34:50.921 --> 01:34:52.150
<v Speaker 2>methods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2043
01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:54.130
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the jewish people have a point,</v>

2044
01:34:54.131 --> 01:34:54.964
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been pretty heavily oppressed for </v>

2045
01:34:56.740 --> 01:34:58.520
<v Speaker 2>2000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sTarted with like,</v>

2046
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:59.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the romans decimating them and then the </v>

2047
01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:05.150
<v Speaker 2>diaspora and then to holocaust and every</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just not good.</v>

2048
01:35:05.570 --> 01:35:08.570
<v Speaker 2>So I think they have a point that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2049
01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:10.160
<v Speaker 2>don't just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2050
01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:13.220
<v Speaker 2>we have crazy white privilege and are </v>
<v Speaker 2>there for white supremacists,</v>

2051
01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:15.110
<v Speaker 2>but if you want to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2052
01:35:15.111 --> 01:35:17.420
<v Speaker 2>maybe this methodology of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2053
01:35:17.450 --> 01:35:19.730
<v Speaker 2>of complaining about it's not the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to go.</v>

2054
01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:21.313
<v Speaker 2>It's complicated stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least they're against the </v>

2055
01:35:23.781 --> 01:35:24.614
<v Speaker 2>critical whiteness stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This critical whiteness thing you were </v>

2056
01:35:27.321 --> 01:35:29.660
<v Speaker 2>saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is they have a journal.</v>

2057
01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:34.450
<v Speaker 2>They did the journal of whiteness </v>
<v Speaker 2>studies or something like that.</v>

2058
01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:35.333
<v Speaker 2>Critical whiteness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It lasted for about three years and I </v>

2059
01:35:37.521 --> 01:35:38.354
<v Speaker 2>don't know exactly why it fell apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it fell apart because I was really </v>

2060
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:44.090
<v Speaker 2>upset because I wanted to send a paper </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it and it doesn't exist anymore.</v>

2061
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:46.423
<v Speaker 2>What were you gonna say to the paper on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rewrite of mind for the woman that </v>

2062
01:35:49.101 --> 01:35:51.380
<v Speaker 2>lesbian woman excoriates around </v>
<v Speaker 2>whiteness.</v>

2063
01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:54.590
<v Speaker 2>It was going to send it to that journal </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it doesn't exist anymore.</v>

2064
01:35:54.591 --> 01:35:56.630
<v Speaker 2>So I had to send it to a critical race </v>
<v Speaker 2>journal who then said,</v>

2065
01:35:57.020 --> 01:35:58.610
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good idea,</v>

2066
01:35:58.611 --> 01:36:02.360
<v Speaker 2>but you're positioning yourself as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good white and that's a problem.</v>

2067
01:36:02.361 --> 01:36:03.620
<v Speaker 2>So we can publish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

2068
01:36:03.621 --> 01:36:04.760
<v Speaker 2>we would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all in line.</v>

2069
01:36:04.761 --> 01:36:07.010
<v Speaker 2>We were completely transparent and </v>
<v Speaker 2>honest with everybody.</v>

2070
01:36:07.011 --> 01:36:10.550
<v Speaker 2>You can just google drive or google </v>
<v Speaker 2>drive with every paper comments,</v>

2071
01:36:10.900 --> 01:36:14.150
<v Speaker 2>comments to everything that mike made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his videos.</v>

2072
01:36:14.210 --> 01:36:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Everything is up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2073
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:18.600
<v Speaker 2>It's totally free for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2074
01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:22.330
<v Speaker 2>We get accused of being grifters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have a how.</v>

2075
01:36:22.450 --> 01:36:23.283
<v Speaker 2>How are we grifting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in a google drive that anybody can </v>

2076
01:36:26.271 --> 01:36:29.480
<v Speaker 2>just go download all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't recall getting money for that.</v>

2077
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:31.550
<v Speaker 2>We want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We really do think that that.</v>

2078
01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:32.553
<v Speaker 2>And I'm.</v>

<v Speaker 1>one of sweden's most merited in claim </v>

2082
01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:47.520
<v Speaker 1>political scientists and longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>critics of identity politics.</v>

2083
01:36:47.730 --> 01:36:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Bow rothstein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rothstein has argued that identity based</v>

2084
01:36:52.021 --> 01:36:52.854
<v Speaker 1>disciplines like grievance studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which deals with the concept of </v>

2085
01:36:55.321 --> 01:36:57.720
<v Speaker 1>collective guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have no place in academia.</v>

2086
01:36:57.840 --> 01:36:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grievance studies is.</v>

<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2090
01:37:02.610 --> 01:37:03.443
<v Speaker 1>we came up with greed and study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so delighted to see that that's caught </v>

2091
01:37:06.361 --> 01:37:07.194
<v Speaker 1>on to start a podcast immediately and a </v>

2094
01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:16.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it is in Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but that guy's probably screwed.</v>

2096
01:37:18.691 --> 01:37:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck they did with Jordan </v>

<v Speaker 1>He's selling out 5,000</v>

2106
01:37:46.171 --> 01:37:48.010
<v Speaker 1>seat theaters.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking rock star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an intellectual rockstar.</v>

2108
01:37:50.630 --> 01:37:51.810
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good for him.</v>

2109
01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:52.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2110
01:37:52.621 --> 01:37:53.454
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of other guys are doing it to sam </v>

2111
01:37:54.271 --> 01:37:55.620
<v Speaker 1>harris is doing that as well.</v>

2112
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:57.840
<v Speaker 3>They're doing these gigantic huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>speeches.</v>

2113
01:37:57.841 --> 01:38:01.740
<v Speaker 3>It's like good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What will absolutely good for him,</v>

2114
01:38:01.741 --> 01:38:02.574
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm excited about is how many </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are interested in the debate of </v>

2115
01:38:09.361 --> 01:38:13.140
<v Speaker 3>ideas and that this is not happening on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the college campuses,</v>

2116
01:38:13.141 --> 01:38:17.310
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of these people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>graduated have graduated from college or</v>

2117
01:38:17.311 --> 01:38:19.440
<v Speaker 3>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the working world.</v>

2118
01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:21.750
<v Speaker 3>They're very fascinated by this.</v>

2119
01:38:22.010 --> 01:38:23.310
<v Speaker 2>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what you were saying.</v>

2120
01:38:23.311 --> 01:38:25.110
<v Speaker 2>It's been suppressed for long enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

2121
01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:27.120
<v Speaker 2>Jordan peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was his thing?</v>

2122
01:38:27.121 --> 01:38:27.954
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to tell me the words I </v>

2123
01:38:28.741 --> 01:38:32.700
<v Speaker 2>can use when they're 78 different words </v>
<v Speaker 2>for genders.</v>

2124
01:38:33.090 --> 01:38:33.923
<v Speaker 2>I can safely say you're fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like this desperation to try to </v>

2125
01:38:38.941 --> 01:38:39.774
<v Speaker 2>find a unique identity that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider it to be super special or </v>

2126
01:38:42.241 --> 01:38:43.320
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally,</v>

2127
01:38:43.670 --> 01:38:44.503
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you want to see even crazier as you </v>

2128
01:38:45.511 --> 01:38:47.250
<v Speaker 2>go into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you go on these blogs.</v>

2129
01:38:47.290 --> 01:38:49.980
<v Speaker 2>I Think they're mostly on tumblr or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that violates my rule.</v>

2130
01:38:49.981 --> 01:38:50.814
<v Speaker 2>never use tumbler where they talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the different sexual sexuality </v>

2131
01:38:54.451 --> 01:38:56.280
<v Speaker 2>identities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like different kinds of,</v>

2132
01:38:56.540 --> 01:38:57.373
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in this kind of personal </v>

2133
01:38:59.101 --> 01:38:59.934
<v Speaker 2>but not this kind of person under these </v>
<v Speaker 2>circumstances but not under those that </v>

2134
01:39:02.011 --> 01:39:02.844
<v Speaker 2>has like some 18 syllable academic word </v>
<v Speaker 2>for it now and there's people whose </v>

2135
01:39:06.811 --> 01:39:08.550
<v Speaker 2>whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think their academics.</v>

2136
01:39:08.551 --> 01:39:10.550
<v Speaker 2>I think there are activists geeks on </v>
<v Speaker 2>tumbler,</v>

2137
01:39:10.551 --> 01:39:11.384
<v Speaker 2>but they come up with these crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>descriptions and there's like hundreds </v>

2138
01:39:14.191 --> 01:39:15.690
<v Speaker 2>of sexual orientations.</v>

2139
01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:18.013
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just people wanting to be </v>

2140
01:39:18.531 --> 01:39:19.364
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it'd be special and they're not </v>

2141
01:39:20.571 --> 01:39:21.404
<v Speaker 3>good at anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's I think something that was the </v>

2142
01:39:23.481 --> 01:39:24.314
<v Speaker 3>other part of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess one of the things that jim said </v>

2143
01:39:26.181 --> 01:39:29.510
<v Speaker 3>when I said I was more cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the in general,</v>

2144
01:39:29.511 --> 01:39:34.511
<v Speaker 3>the critics tend to be angry and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that their anger is legitimate or</v>

2145
01:39:35.631 --> 01:39:37.340
<v Speaker 3>illegitimate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they send to be angry.</v>

2146
01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:40.040
<v Speaker 3>They seem to be almost universally under</v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplished,</v>

2147
01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:42.740
<v Speaker 3>so they're upset at you because you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2148
01:39:42.741 --> 01:39:45.640
<v Speaker 3>a big show or lot of fault or they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2149
01:39:45.650 --> 01:39:48.520
<v Speaker 3>They're upset about big platform </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience there.</v>

2150
01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:49.553
<v Speaker 3>They're just generally disagreeable </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and they found these communities </v>

2151
01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:57.260
<v Speaker 3>of other people who are enraged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are also under accomplished,</v>

2152
01:39:57.500 --> 01:40:00.770
<v Speaker 3>who they can laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can lash out at people together,</v>

2153
01:40:00.771 --> 01:40:01.604
<v Speaker 3>and then virtue signal you get rewarded </v>
<v Speaker 3>for all know rogan that bat whatever </v>

2154
01:40:05.811 --> 01:40:09.720
<v Speaker 3>they want to call you or whatever they </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to call us or whoever else,</v>

2155
01:40:09.721 --> 01:40:12.730
<v Speaker 3>some kind of an oppressor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some pressure,</v>

2156
01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:14.010
<v Speaker 3>and that there's something that.</v>

2157
01:40:14.050 --> 01:40:19.040
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know how we can deal with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2158
01:40:19.041 --> 01:40:19.874
<v Speaker 3>I mean was our attempt to do this was to</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to de legitimize where they get </v>

2159
01:40:24.321 --> 01:40:26.600
<v Speaker 3>their knowledge from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what they call knowledge,</v>

2160
01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:27.473
<v Speaker 3>what they could point to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We tried to say it's not knowledge and </v>

2161
01:40:29.541 --> 01:40:30.374
<v Speaker 3>de-legitimizing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we really do need to get back to </v>

2162
01:40:32.751 --> 01:40:33.584
<v Speaker 3>some kind of productive discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>productive politics where the far right </v>

2163
01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:39.613
<v Speaker 3>disown they're lunatics and we disown </v>
<v Speaker 3>are lunatics and we get back to work </v>

2164
01:40:43.221 --> 01:40:46.280
<v Speaker 3>about whatever the oceans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>plastic,</v>

2165
01:40:46.281 --> 01:40:47.114
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is that we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because right now the discourse is </v>

2166
01:40:49.851 --> 01:40:50.684
<v Speaker 3>corrupted it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not doing what we need to do in </v>

2167
01:40:52.911 --> 01:40:54.280
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people</v>

2168
01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:56.890
<v Speaker 2>are continuing to pump out this </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense.</v>

2169
01:40:56.891 --> 01:40:59.920
<v Speaker 2>that's totally untethered reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge problem.</v>

2170
01:40:59.950 --> 01:41:01.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm sick of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're sick of it.</v>

2171
01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:03.940
<v Speaker 2>We're all sick and we're sick of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sick of it.</v>

2172
01:41:03.941 --> 01:41:05.710
<v Speaker 2>I've had it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had it with these folks.</v>

2173
01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:09.760
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't seem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like it's sustainable.</v>

2174
01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:11.573
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like some weird thing that's </v>

2175
01:41:13.631 --> 01:41:14.464
<v Speaker 2>going to run out of energy towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating itself constantly eats itself </v>

2176
01:41:17.471 --> 01:41:18.304
<v Speaker 2>like we did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing about the the people of color </v>

2177
01:41:19.961 --> 01:41:22.810
<v Speaker 2>and the black indigenous people of color</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they fragmented.</v>

2178
01:41:23.050 --> 01:41:25.510
<v Speaker 2>You see when you get into the critical </v>
<v Speaker 2>race literature that it's like,</v>

2179
01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:27.550
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're brown or black,</v>

2180
01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:28.533
<v Speaker 2>but you have slightly lighter skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly darker skin is slightly darker </v>

2181
01:41:30.401 --> 01:41:31.234
<v Speaker 2>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really dark.</v>

2182
01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:34.210
<v Speaker 2>They have different levels of privilege </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just cutting things apart.</v>

2183
01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:38.190
<v Speaker 2>The idea though that this is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>create some kind of a coalition that can</v>

2184
01:41:38.191 --> 01:41:42.520
<v Speaker 2>then defeat the plurality or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that is ridiculous.</v>

2185
01:41:42.730 --> 01:41:45.670
<v Speaker 2>So what do you see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see this stuff starting to blow up.</v>

2186
01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:49.990
<v Speaker 2>You see the democrats bleed seats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've lost lIke a thousand legislative</v>

2187
01:41:49.991 --> 01:41:52.740
<v Speaker 2>seats across the u.</v>
<v Speaker 2>S since obama got elected in [inaudible]</v>

2188
01:41:52.741 --> 01:41:53.574
<v Speaker 2>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to get your agenda if </v>

2189
01:41:55.631 --> 01:41:58.180
<v Speaker 2>you don't have any legislators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have anybody elected,</v>

2190
01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:01.390
<v Speaker 2>and so then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand 16.</v>

2191
01:42:01.730 --> 01:42:02.563
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't say that the reason that trump </v>

2192
01:42:03.761 --> 01:42:06.220
<v Speaker 2>got elected because there's lots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons it had something to do.</v>

2193
01:42:06.510 --> 01:42:07.343
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will say I had something to do with </v>

2194
01:42:08.351 --> 01:42:09.184
<v Speaker 2>this because every conservative person I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that's not just a reactionary is </v>

2195
01:42:12.521 --> 01:42:14.550
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I live in the soUtheast man.</v>

2196
01:42:14.551 --> 01:42:15.650
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know some conservatives,</v>

2197
01:42:16.210 --> 01:42:17.470
<v Speaker 2>most of my friends who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives,</v>

2198
01:42:17.471 --> 01:42:20.260
<v Speaker 2>because I don't have a choice if I want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have friends that they're going to be</v>

2199
01:42:20.261 --> 01:42:24.040
<v Speaker 2>conservatives who lives there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I talked to them and they're like,</v>

2200
01:42:24.610 --> 01:42:26.710
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're tearing down this statue.</v>

2201
01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tough.</v>

2202
01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:28.753
<v Speaker 2>And it's not like they're tearing down </v>
<v Speaker 2>confederate statues are turning on </v>

2203
01:42:30.311 --> 01:42:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Thomas Jefferson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2204
01:42:31.791 --> 01:42:34.150
<v Speaker 2>it's like there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Washington,</v>

2205
01:42:34.180 --> 01:42:38.080
<v Speaker 2>George Washington halloween's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I didn't know.</v>

2206
01:42:38.110 --> 01:42:40.300
<v Speaker 2>You didn't know how it means a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you going as for halloween?</v>

2207
01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:42.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm a shark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a sharp.</v>

2208
01:42:42.511 --> 01:42:44.710
<v Speaker 2>My kids are mermaids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Problematic.</v>

2209
01:42:44.750 --> 01:42:46.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're mermaids and you're a shark,</v>

2210
01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:49.750
<v Speaker 2>you're definitely taking like a dominant</v>
<v Speaker 2>power position.</v>

2211
01:42:50.020 --> 01:42:51.150
<v Speaker 2>Power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>

2212
01:42:52.170 --> 01:42:55.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't pick my off that I have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tell me what I am.</v>

2213
01:42:57.290 --> 01:42:58.510
<v Speaker 2>Not an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

2214
01:42:58.511 --> 01:43:02.460
<v Speaker 2>I'll try to figure out a paper for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Halloween.</v>

2215
01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:03.620
<v Speaker 2>Halloween?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2216
01:43:03.820 --> 01:43:05.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cultural appropriation.</v>

2217
01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:10.580
<v Speaker 2>Why apologizes for tropic thunder?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simple jack costume.</v>

2218
01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:13.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He dressed up as a black person.</v>

2219
01:43:13.121 --> 01:43:13.931
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simple.</v>

2220
01:43:13.931 --> 01:43:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Jack is the mentally handicapped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2221
01:43:16.871 --> 01:43:17.390
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all right.</v>

2222
01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:19.980
<v Speaker 2>It's junior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might be the last guy ever to wear black</v>

2223
01:43:19.981 --> 01:43:20.830
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2224
01:43:20.831 --> 01:43:21.880
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull it off.</v>

2225
01:43:22.210 --> 01:43:22.680
<v Speaker 2>What are they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gonna.</v>

2226
01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:23.860
<v Speaker 2>Pull that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That show.</v>

2227
01:43:24.490 --> 01:43:26.550
<v Speaker 2>What are they goIng to pull?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tropic thunder is problematic.</v>

2228
01:43:26.570 --> 01:43:29.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's probably a tropic thunder.</v>

2229
01:43:31.970 --> 01:43:34.120
<v Speaker 2>It's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll love it and it's.</v>

2230
01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:37.180
<v Speaker 2>It's special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Highly politically incorrect.</v>

2231
01:43:37.630 --> 01:43:40.380
<v Speaker 2>It's politically and writing it down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tropic thunder is.</v>

2232
01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:45.040
<v Speaker 2>It is a fucking great move is a gem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great movie.</v>

2233
01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:47.870
<v Speaker 2>Now we're going to be racists and </v>
<v Speaker 2>abelist for saying that.</v>

2234
01:43:47.871 --> 01:43:49.450
<v Speaker 2>It's funny for short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got real issues.</v>

2235
01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:52.760
<v Speaker 2>We do halloween again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Halloween is mostly,</v>

2236
01:43:52.761 --> 01:43:53.594
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of cultural appropriation </v>

2237
01:43:54.471 --> 01:43:56.450
<v Speaker 2>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so somebody might dress up like a put on</v>

2238
01:43:56.451 --> 01:43:58.520
<v Speaker 2>a sombrero and a poncho.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an issue,</v>

2239
01:44:00.650 --> 01:44:03.410
<v Speaker 2>especially on tuesdays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have tacos today.</v>

2240
01:44:03.411 --> 01:44:05.810
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't be a native american,</v>

2241
01:44:05.811 --> 01:44:06.644
<v Speaker 2>you can't be a native american.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's that big stink just now about </v>

2242
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:11.900
<v Speaker 2>the victoria's secret fashion show where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had like their indigenous,</v>

2243
01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:12.753
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>colors and the feathers they were </v>

2244
01:44:14.271 --> 01:44:16.970
<v Speaker 2>wearing and walking around half naked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>

2245
01:44:17.090 --> 01:44:21.290
<v Speaker 2>So the idea mostly that people are going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take costumes that are insensitive to</v>

2246
01:44:21.291 --> 01:44:23.930
<v Speaker 2>other people's cultural appropriation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural appropriation.</v>

2247
01:44:23.931 --> 01:44:27.170
<v Speaker 2>So it's not dress up as Bruce Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man.</v>

2248
01:44:27.171 --> 01:44:31.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>MaYbe for awhile for a harvard,</v>

2249
01:44:31.131 --> 01:44:32.990
<v Speaker 2>maybe because he's asian and then it </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets complicated,</v>

2250
01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:35.930
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this all blew up at yale a few years ago</v>

2251
01:44:35.931 --> 01:44:36.790

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

01:44:45.390 --> 01:44:46.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2258
01:44:46.341 --> 01:44:47.174
<v Speaker 2>That was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was kids screaming at screaming at </v>

2259
01:44:49.761 --> 01:44:51.340
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Safe place.</v>

2260
01:44:51.810 --> 01:44:54.320

2261
01:44:54.670 --> 01:44:55.503
<v Speaker 1>put out a email saying maybe it's okay </v>
<v Speaker 1>to believe politically incorrect on </v>

2262
01:45:00.221 --> 01:45:00.960
<v Speaker 1>halloween.</v>

2263
01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:01.630
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2264
01:45:01.630 --> 01:45:02.463
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2265
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:04.490
<v Speaker 2>choose your costume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you're going to choose it.</v>

2266
01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:05.413
<v Speaker 2>We're all adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably bad to be deliberately </v>

2267
01:45:07.581 --> 01:45:12.581
<v Speaker 2>offensive and yet it's also bad to </v>
<v Speaker 2>overreact to incidental stuff.</v>

2268
01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:15.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all this stuff.</v>

2269
01:45:15.961 --> 01:45:17.720
<v Speaker 2>You kNow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like little girls if are white can dress</v>

2271
01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:19.850
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

2272
01:45:19.851 --> 01:45:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Behind us or about pocahontas is a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

<v Speaker 1>pocahontas problem.</v>

2274
01:45:23.570 --> 01:45:26.000
<v Speaker 1>But I think Bruce Lee is still on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>menu.</v>

2275
01:45:26.090 --> 01:45:28.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody's getting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble for being Bruce Lee.</v>

2276
01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:32.180
<v Speaker 1>You could wear it like the track suit </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I get the treks didn't.</v>

2277
01:45:32.290 --> 01:45:36.170

<v Speaker 1>right footprint.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We our cream of kicked in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people go with the.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like the cutS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

2280
01:45:41.751 --> 01:45:42.581
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2281
01:45:42.581 --> 01:45:44.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have enough apps for that.</v>

2282
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:47.420
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be a bad costume for </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it is.</v>

2283
01:45:47.421 --> 01:45:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could buy a Bruce Lee costume.</v>

2284
01:45:49.420 --> 01:45:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Look for now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for now,</v>

2285
01:45:51.710 --> 01:45:52.940
<v Speaker 1>for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

2286
01:45:52.941 --> 01:45:57.941
<v Speaker 1>it comes with a weight to dope for now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a baby costume.</v>

2287
01:45:58.431 --> 01:45:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

2288
01:45:59.690 --> 01:46:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Obviously chinese babies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chinese.</v>

2289
01:46:01.701 --> 01:46:02.990
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2290
01:46:02.991 --> 01:46:06.340
<v Speaker 1>That guy's fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2291
01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:07.400
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not allowed.</v>

2292
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Can't be a ninja.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No way to cultural appropriation.</v>

2293
01:46:10.890 --> 01:46:15.140
<v Speaker 1>a boy this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this mess that we're in.</v>

2294
01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Is there a light at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tunnel?</v>

2295
01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:18.373
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2296
01:46:18.450 --> 01:46:19.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2297
01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:20.290
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2298
01:46:20.291 --> 01:46:22.720
<v Speaker 2>the response that we've got so far has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been really positive,</v>

2299
01:46:22.750 --> 01:46:26.470
<v Speaker 2>but it's all like the secret positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the feeling I get is academia.</v>

2300
01:46:26.650 --> 01:46:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Well from academics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2301
01:46:28.450 --> 01:46:30.850
<v Speaker 2>the general public has been way more </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive than that.</v>

2302
01:46:31.290 --> 01:46:34.960
<v Speaker 2>PosItive for positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the wind is changing,</v>

2303
01:46:34.961 --> 01:46:36.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we're getting that much,</v>

2304
01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:38.770
<v Speaker 2>we've got no real blow back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got,</v>

2305
01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:40.630
<v Speaker 2>we got lots of posItivity from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>public.</v>

2306
01:46:40.810 --> 01:46:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Even academics are reaching out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>like secret positive with them.</v>

2307
01:46:44.261 --> 01:46:45.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like one more thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2308
01:46:45.611 --> 01:46:48.400
<v Speaker 2>We need a critical mass because what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are is they're all lined up.</v>

2309
01:46:48.610 --> 01:46:49.443
<v Speaker 2>They know the first one to step out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>line and challenged the stuff's getting </v>

2310
01:46:51.301 --> 01:46:53.520
<v Speaker 2>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like the communist situation,</v>

2311
01:46:53.580 --> 01:46:56.040
<v Speaker 2>after communism fell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody really believed it anymore.</v>

2312
01:46:56.041 --> 01:46:58.140
<v Speaker 2>But they had to go along with the party </v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to get shot,</v>

2313
01:46:58.410 --> 01:46:59.970
<v Speaker 2>but if a whole bunch of people come </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward at once,</v>

2314
01:46:59.971 --> 01:47:00.900
<v Speaker 2>they can shoot everybody.</v>

2315
01:47:01.290 --> 01:47:04.680
<v Speaker 2>So if feels like we're in that powder </v>
<v Speaker 2>keg situation now,</v>

2316
01:47:04.681 --> 01:47:08.610
<v Speaker 2>right where all it's going to take is we</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoped it was going to be this,</v>

2317
01:47:08.730 --> 01:47:09.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

2318
01:47:09.321 --> 01:47:10.154
<v Speaker 2>our thing was going to be the trigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>that like 30 percent of academics come </v>

2319
01:47:12.301 --> 01:47:12.961
<v Speaker 2>forward and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2320
01:47:12.961 --> 01:47:15.300
<v Speaker 2>it's bullshit and if enough people start</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying it,</v>

2321
01:47:15.330 --> 01:47:16.163
<v Speaker 2>other people start feeling safe to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and we wish them where people feel </v>

2322
01:47:18.391 --> 01:47:18.901
<v Speaker 2>safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2323
01:47:18.901 --> 01:47:21.510
<v Speaker 2>we took a risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been fine for us and we'll see what</v>

2324
01:47:21.511 --> 01:47:22.344
<v Speaker 2>happens to pete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if more people will take that risk </v>

2325
01:47:24.841 --> 01:47:26.760
<v Speaker 2>and start speaking out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's change coming.</v>

2326
01:47:27.150 --> 01:47:27.930
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were,</v>

2327
01:47:27.930 --> 01:47:31.380
<v Speaker 2>you were a mathematician and that's your</v>
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>

2328
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:36.430
<v Speaker 2>And in academia that would appear at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least to be something that is beyond all</v>

2329
01:47:37.561 --> 01:47:39.600
<v Speaker 2>this stuff because it's just dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with numbers.</v>

2330
01:47:39.630 --> 01:47:40.463
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Math itself mostly has not been touched </v>

2331
01:47:43.201 --> 01:47:44.034
<v Speaker 2>by this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's this whole branch in there </v>

2332
01:47:44.881 --> 01:47:47.010
<v Speaker 2>that's called the studies of science and</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>

2333
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:50.220
<v Speaker 2>And mostly what they go after is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2334
01:47:50.221 --> 01:47:52.830
<v Speaker 2>the sciences or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially they go after,</v>

2335
01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:53.673
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>biology and psychology and they feel </v>

2336
01:47:56.281 --> 01:47:57.930
<v Speaker 2>like they've got a lot of inroads into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2337
01:47:57.931 --> 01:48:01.410
<v Speaker 2>We wroTe the astronomy paper to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>push that all the way to a hard science.</v>

2338
01:48:01.411 --> 01:48:02.244
<v Speaker 2>We've said that astronomy is sexist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>can only be fixed by putting in queer </v>

2339
01:48:05.011 --> 01:48:08.880
<v Speaker 2>horoscopes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>they thought that was a good project.</v>

2340
01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:11.600
<v Speaker 2>They keep asking them to rewrite it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2341
01:48:11.610 --> 01:48:14.640
<v Speaker 2>They keep asking me to submit that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got an email yesterday asking for that</v>

2342
01:48:14.641 --> 01:48:16.980
<v Speaker 2>one again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even though we've come public.</v>

2343
01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:21.840
<v Speaker 2>So with math mostly where you see this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff hitting though,</v>

2344
01:48:21.841 --> 01:48:22.674
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean some people are saying that math </v>

2345
01:48:23.731 --> 01:48:24.564
<v Speaker 2>is inherently got sexism and racism </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I guess apparently women and </v>

2346
01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:30.330
<v Speaker 2>minorities are going to be naturally bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>at numbers is what they're assuming.</v>

2347
01:48:30.330 --> 01:48:31.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what they're assuming does </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2348
01:48:31.380 --> 01:48:34.530
<v Speaker 2>that's ludicrous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they mostly go after educatIon.</v>

2349
01:48:34.710 --> 01:48:35.760
<v Speaker 2>So they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>

2350
01:48:35.850 --> 01:48:39.090
<v Speaker 2>the scores on the sat math scores or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever For,</v>

2351
01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:41.350
<v Speaker 2>for men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white men are higher than for,</v>

2352
01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:44.460
<v Speaker 2>for black men or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why could that be?</v>

2353
01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:45.031
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2354
01:48:45.031 --> 01:48:46.650
<v Speaker 2>maybe there are a lot of factors that go</v>
<v Speaker 2>into that,</v>

2355
01:48:46.651 --> 01:48:48.150
<v Speaker 2>but they Don't give a shit about a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of factors.</v>

2356
01:48:48.151 --> 01:48:48.984
<v Speaker 2>it's racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so therefore math education must be </v>

2357
01:48:51.001 --> 01:48:51.834
<v Speaker 2>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Therefore we need social justice </v>

2358
01:48:53.131 --> 01:48:56.220
<v Speaker 2>initiatives in math education and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactLy what they do.</v>

2359
01:48:56.221 --> 01:48:59.100
<v Speaker 2>And so then you have diversity math and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know even know what that is,</v>

2360
01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:03.000
<v Speaker 2>but it's not something that you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>see like at mathematics research level,</v>

2361
01:49:03.001 --> 01:49:05.190
<v Speaker 2>it's something that you see at junior </v>
<v Speaker 2>high school,</v>

2362
01:49:05.250 --> 01:49:07.230
<v Speaker 2>elementary school that they're teaching </v>
<v Speaker 2>your kids,</v>

2363
01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:09.030
<v Speaker 2>which is why it's scary as hell.</v>

2364
01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:14.970
<v Speaker 2>So is there a light at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tunnel and what do you still think?</v>

2365
01:49:14.971 --> 01:49:16.470
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people hate this stuff.</v>

2366
01:49:16.471 --> 01:49:18.820
<v Speaker 2>I think people are getting sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate it.</v>

2367
01:49:18.980 --> 01:49:20.910
<v Speaker 2>Hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hate it too though.</v>

2368
01:49:20.911 --> 01:49:22.110
<v Speaker 2>But they're afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2369
01:49:22.111 --> 01:49:24.990
<v Speaker 2>I had this guy come up to me repeatedly </v>
<v Speaker 2>last week.</v>

2370
01:49:24.991 --> 01:49:26.330
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got two phd,</v>

2371
01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:27.870
<v Speaker 2>brilliant guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He comes up to me repeatedly.</v>

2372
01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:29.540
<v Speaker 2>What you did is so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so necessary.</v>

2373
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:30.720
<v Speaker 2>I can't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

2374
01:49:30.721 --> 01:49:32.070
<v Speaker 2>I can't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could talk about it,</v>

2375
01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:36.330
<v Speaker 2>but I talked to a lot of academics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's saying the same thing.</v>

2376
01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:39.930
<v Speaker 2>They know you got them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only a matter of time now.</v>

2377
01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:42.840
<v Speaker 2>One more event and theY shake off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fear.</v>

2378
01:49:43.590 --> 01:49:46.710
<v Speaker 2>I think it's close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't knoW what the next event is.</v>

2379
01:49:46.711 --> 01:49:50.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's more bogus papers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's probably somebody's getting</v>

2380
01:49:50.801 --> 01:49:52.900
<v Speaker 2>fired that didn't deserve it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2381
01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:57.250
<v Speaker 2>One more thing and people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be ready to shake this off it.</v>

2382
01:49:57.700 --> 01:49:59.980
<v Speaker 4>Why does this ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in fact,</v>

2383
01:49:59.981 --> 01:50:04.981
<v Speaker 4>tech companies and it seems to get them </v>
<v Speaker 4>more than it gets anyone else.</v>

2384
01:50:06.650 --> 01:50:08.260
<v Speaker 4>We should ask them more that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>

2385
01:50:08.730 --> 01:50:10.030
<v Speaker 4>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's fucked.</v>

2386
01:50:10.220 --> 01:50:12.730
<v Speaker 4>If I can't get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just gone.</v>

2387
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:14.980
<v Speaker 4>I just to him the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just gone,</v>

2388
01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:16.350
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't say where he's working.</v>

2389
01:50:16.351 --> 01:50:17.170
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>

2390
01:50:17.170 --> 01:50:18.500
<v Speaker 4>They'll go after him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2391
01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:19.411
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

2392
01:50:19.411 --> 01:50:20.244
<v Speaker 2>It's in tech so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there's some kind of silicon </v>

2393
01:50:21.991 --> 01:50:26.310
<v Speaker 2>valley connection there or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you know silicon valley is in,</v>

2394
01:50:26.430 --> 01:50:28.770
<v Speaker 2>you know the kind of bay area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

2395
01:50:28.771 --> 01:50:29.604
<v Speaker 2>You've got a lot of the liberal hippie </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that started out as you were </v>

2396
01:50:31.411 --> 01:50:32.940
<v Speaker 2>talking about in the sixties and </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>

2397
01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:35.850
<v Speaker 2>so it's kind of in the water there in </v>
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>

2398
01:50:35.851 --> 01:50:37.710
<v Speaker 2>I would say that what you're seeing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this stuff,</v>

2399
01:50:38.220 --> 01:50:42.750
<v Speaker 2>as they've got the big turn to making </v>
<v Speaker 2>this applied was in the nineties.</v>

2400
01:50:43.110 --> 01:50:43.943
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they've had an entire generation of </v>

2401
01:50:45.391 --> 01:50:46.224
<v Speaker 2>students that have just been really </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting this stuff crammed down their </v>

2402
01:50:48.421 --> 01:50:49.254
<v Speaker 2>throat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really have taken over the </v>

2403
01:50:50.371 --> 01:50:51.204
<v Speaker 2>education in the last 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just starting when I left </v>

2404
01:50:53.041 --> 01:50:56.090
<v Speaker 2>academia in 2010 that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2405
01:50:56.120 --> 01:50:56.641
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2406
01:50:56.641 --> 01:50:58.830
<v Speaker 2>we're going to focus on diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in a diversity committee,</v>

2407
01:50:58.890 --> 01:50:59.723
<v Speaker 2>commitments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going to get into general </v>

2408
01:51:00.481 --> 01:51:01.314
<v Speaker 2>curriculum.</v>

2409
01:51:01.770 --> 01:51:04.710
<v Speaker 2>So you're getting more and more students</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are getting educated in this,</v>

2410
01:51:04.711 --> 01:51:06.210
<v Speaker 2>that is now going out into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>workplace.</v>

2411
01:51:06.630 --> 01:51:08.970
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if half your workforce in tech,</v>

2412
01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:09.833
<v Speaker 2>Because tech moves so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just guessing why this might be a </v>

2413
01:51:12.031 --> 01:51:13.560
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tech was really fast,</v>

2414
01:51:13.561 --> 01:51:16.560
<v Speaker 2>so you've got to have some fresh </v>
<v Speaker 2>training go in there.</v>

2415
01:51:16.710 --> 01:51:17.543
<v Speaker 2>If they've been educated with diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff's crammed down their throat the </v>

2416
01:51:19.831 --> 01:51:23.070
<v Speaker 2>whole time and there's huge initiatives </v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to,</v>

2417
01:51:23.071 --> 01:51:23.904
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increase representation of women in </v>

2418
01:51:24.931 --> 01:51:29.070
<v Speaker 2>particular in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in tech and these are seen as,</v>

2419
01:51:29.071 --> 01:51:31.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>automatically good initiatives.</v>

2420
01:51:31.921 --> 01:51:33.840
<v Speaker 2>If there has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the culture that they're,</v>

2421
01:51:33.841 --> 01:51:34.674
<v Speaker 2>that they're being educated in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they take that culture to the </v>

2422
01:51:37.681 --> 01:51:39.930
<v Speaker 2>workplace and think this is what tech is</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

2423
01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:42.690
<v Speaker 2>and then they're surrounded by </v>
<v Speaker 2>likeminded people who encourage it.</v>

2424
01:51:43.050 --> 01:51:43.883
<v Speaker 2>It's totally plausible that which you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to sort of a tech echo chamber </v>

2425
01:51:46.291 --> 01:51:49.020
<v Speaker 2>that's bouncing these things around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping it,</v>

2426
01:51:49.140 --> 01:51:49.973
<v Speaker 2>keeping it there.</v>

2427
01:51:51.610 --> 01:51:54.880
<v Speaker 4>Here's another question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is it that,</v>

2428
01:51:55.140 --> 01:51:56.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's,</v>

2429
01:51:56.410 --> 01:51:57.700
<v Speaker 4>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the scenario,</v>

2430
01:51:57.701 --> 01:51:58.534
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The scenario is universities are almost </v>

2431
01:52:00.521 --> 01:52:03.760
<v Speaker 4>predominantly taught by people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the left.</v>

2432
01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:06.600
<v Speaker 4>It's massive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in the 90 percent range,</v>

2433
01:52:06.601 --> 01:52:07.434
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you have this sort of environment </v>

2434
01:52:12.791 --> 01:52:17.791
<v Speaker 4>of these nonsense ideas that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>accepted as fact and taught and put into</v>

2435
01:52:19.210 --> 01:52:23.920
<v Speaker 4>published papers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you have a situation where the left</v>

2436
01:52:23.921 --> 01:52:24.754
<v Speaker 4>routinely attacks itself and and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and devours Itself for not being left </v>

2437
01:52:30.131 --> 01:52:30.964
<v Speaker 4>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're always having people that are </v>

2438
01:52:32.561 --> 01:52:34.630
<v Speaker 4>upset that someone's not progressive </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough,</v>

2439
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:37.000
<v Speaker 4>leftwing people attacking leftwing </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2440
01:52:37.570 --> 01:52:39.040
<v Speaker 4>You do not see that on the right.</v>

2441
01:52:39.150 --> 01:52:39.781
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did.</v>

2442
01:52:39.781 --> 01:52:41.820
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of what the whole tea party </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement was.</v>

2443
01:52:42.330 --> 01:52:43.163
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't do it in the academic </v>

2444
01:52:44.221 --> 01:52:46.760
<v Speaker 2>field because they didn't power there </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they weren't academics.</v>

2445
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:47.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2446
01:52:47.210 --> 01:52:48.043
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shift started in the sixties and </v>

2447
01:52:49.161 --> 01:52:49.994
<v Speaker 2>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They started bringing in these field </v>

2448
01:52:51.231 --> 01:52:53.780
<v Speaker 2>when that was during the obama </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration,</v>

2449
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:54.663
<v Speaker 2>so that's when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the biggest fear for every </v>

2450
01:52:56.181 --> 01:52:57.014
<v Speaker 2>republican congressman then was that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get primaried from the </v>

2451
01:52:58.731 --> 01:52:59.564
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they were going to have some </v>

2452
01:53:00.830 --> 01:53:03.320
<v Speaker 2>populist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yahoo goes screaming about whatever they</v>

2453
01:53:03.321 --> 01:53:05.540
<v Speaker 2>scream about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was going to be more to the right,</v>

2454
01:53:05.570 --> 01:53:07.730
<v Speaker 2>harder conservatism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative movement,</v>

2455
01:53:07.731 --> 01:53:10.220
<v Speaker 2>capital c,</v>
<v Speaker 2>capital m kind of thing,</v>

2456
01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:11.870
<v Speaker 2>and they're going to just drill into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2457
01:53:11.871 --> 01:53:13.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason that,</v>

2458
01:53:13.330 --> 01:53:14.163
<v Speaker 2>that the conservative politics aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>succeeding is because we're not </v>

2459
01:53:16.641 --> 01:53:18.460
<v Speaker 2>conservative enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that's the,</v>

2460
01:53:18.590 --> 01:53:21.380
<v Speaker 2>the prevailing view where I live in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>southeast.</v>

2461
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:23.960
<v Speaker 2>so same thing as you see in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities,</v>

2462
01:53:23.961 --> 01:53:26.300
<v Speaker 2>but reversed in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of polarization.</v>

2463
01:53:27.190 --> 01:53:28.023
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but isn't thAt just an excuse for the </v>

2464
01:53:29.331 --> 01:53:31.670
<v Speaker 2>lack of success?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

2465
01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:32.553
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

2466
01:53:32.710 --> 01:53:37.710
<v Speaker 2>it's within excuse combined with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>commitment to the ideology,</v>

2467
01:53:37.821 --> 01:53:39.650
<v Speaker 2>whether it's conservative movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology,</v>

2468
01:53:39.651 --> 01:53:42.230
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a social justice </v>
<v Speaker 2>scholarship,</v>

2469
01:53:42.231 --> 01:53:44.420
<v Speaker 2>whatever it happens to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2470
01:53:44.421 --> 01:53:49.280
<v Speaker 2>But you see far more of these left on </v>
<v Speaker 2>left attacks they need do write on right</v>

2471
01:53:49.281 --> 01:53:50.780
<v Speaker 2>attacks you do right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2472
01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:53.780
<v Speaker 2>certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Except of course for election time,</v>

2473
01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:57.440
<v Speaker 2>certain people were trying to beat their</v>
<v Speaker 2>opponents.</v>

2474
01:53:57.800 --> 01:53:58.371
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

2475
01:53:58.371 --> 01:53:59.510
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

2476
01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:02.480
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be that there's somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 2>another related.</v>

2477
01:54:02.570 --> 01:54:03.403
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would like to look at how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people on the left will attack others </v>

2478
01:54:09.410 --> 01:54:13.100
<v Speaker 2>for not being progressive enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not being left enough.</v>

2479
01:54:13.130 --> 01:54:15.050
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's a panic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rIght?</v>

2480
01:54:15.051 --> 01:54:16.940
<v Speaker 2>You see this is the kind of behavior you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see in a panic,</v>

2481
01:54:16.941 --> 01:54:18.380
<v Speaker 2>a moral panic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

2482
01:54:18.710 --> 01:54:19.543
<v Speaker 2>And so helen and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the third person who worked on the </v>

2483
01:54:22.641 --> 01:54:23.474
<v Speaker 2>project with us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>helen and I wrote an essay about a year </v>

2484
01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:26.773
<v Speaker 2>and a half ago and talking about how the</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremism on both sides is really the </v>

2485
01:54:29.721 --> 01:54:32.420
<v Speaker 2>problem and most people reject it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>should fight it.</v>

2486
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Most of us are sensible people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle who hate this.</v>

2487
01:54:34.851 --> 01:54:35.684
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>data just came out showing that it's 80 </v>

2488
01:54:37.161 --> 01:54:40.070
<v Speaker 2>percent of the population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fringes,</v>

2489
01:54:40.250 --> 01:54:41.083
<v Speaker 2>both sIdes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So n only eight percent are on the left </v>

2490
01:54:43.221 --> 01:54:45.140
<v Speaker 2>and 12 percent are on the right of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fringe.</v>

2491
01:54:45.170 --> 01:54:49.030
<v Speaker 2>However that works out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we wrote this thing and we said,</v>

2492
01:54:49.090 --> 01:54:49.923
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually we called it existential </v>

2493
01:54:51.921 --> 01:54:52.754
<v Speaker 2>polarization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have this idea that everything's </v>

2494
01:54:56.871 --> 01:54:59.600
<v Speaker 2>an existential crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the the far right,</v>

2495
01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:02.450
<v Speaker 2>we'll start with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sees that if the democrats get power,</v>

2496
01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:03.680
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's open borders.</v>

2497
01:55:03.681 --> 01:55:05.030
<v Speaker 2>The terrorists are coming in.</v>

2498
01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Our entire way of life is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroyed.</v>

2499
01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:08.690
<v Speaker 2>Catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe,</v>

2500
01:55:08.691 --> 01:55:09.710
<v Speaker 2>ono,</v>
<v Speaker 2>judith butler's,</v>

2501
01:55:09.711 --> 01:55:14.600
<v Speaker 2>you mean 95 genders?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quick stop the democrats no matter what.</v>

2502
01:55:14.780 --> 01:55:16.790
<v Speaker 2>And then you have the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god,</v>

2503
01:55:16.791 --> 01:55:18.980
<v Speaker 2>if they get power that everything's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be racist,</v>

2504
01:55:18.981 --> 01:55:20.720
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be beating gays in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>snow.</v>

2505
01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:24.080
<v Speaker 2>It's going to just be the worst thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually kind of a joke,</v>

2506
01:55:24.081 --> 01:55:25.620
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

2507
01:55:25.650 --> 01:55:26.483
<v Speaker 2>it's for real though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they think that the world is going </v>

2508
01:55:27.901 --> 01:55:28.734
<v Speaker 2>to fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the other side it gets power and so </v>

2509
01:55:30.081 --> 01:55:30.914
<v Speaker 2>when you have that kind of a situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a panic and you see the </v>

2510
01:55:33.231 --> 01:55:34.064
<v Speaker 2>slightest bit of advantage happening on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other side is just something to </v>

2511
01:55:36.321 --> 01:55:38.900
<v Speaker 2>completely freak out about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what do you do?</v>

2512
01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:40.033
<v Speaker 2>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well the only possible recipe to </v>

2513
01:55:41.601 --> 01:55:43.800
<v Speaker 2>balance the scales to turn further our </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

2514
01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:46.350
<v Speaker 2>If we go toward the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that puts the balance.</v>

2515
01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:49.860
<v Speaker 2>SaY if the right goes really far right </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we on the left,</v>

2516
01:55:49.861 --> 01:55:52.110
<v Speaker 2>moved toward the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the whole balance has moved,</v>

2517
01:55:52.111 --> 01:55:52.944
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the only way to keep the balance </v>

2518
01:55:54.211 --> 01:55:56.280
<v Speaker 2>close to the middle is if they go right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we go left,</v>

2519
01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:58.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2520
01:55:58.171 --> 01:55:59.280
<v Speaker 2>So then that's going to keep the </v>
<v Speaker 2>balance.</v>

2521
01:55:59.281 --> 01:56:01.950
<v Speaker 2>But what that actually does is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is going to get nerdy.</v>

2522
01:56:02.070 --> 01:56:02.903
<v Speaker 2>Hang on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That actually puts all of the weight on </v>

2523
01:56:05.191 --> 01:56:07.350
<v Speaker 2>the outsides and you think about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>spinning thing,</v>

2524
01:56:07.351 --> 01:56:09.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got centrifugal forces happening.</v>

2525
01:56:10.020 --> 01:56:11.970
<v Speaker 2>What's that trying to do is going to rip</v>
<v Speaker 2>the spinning thing apart?</v>

2526
01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:13.013
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have all the weight crammed in </v>

2527
01:56:13.621 --> 01:56:15.000
<v Speaker 2>the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like wheel,</v>

2528
01:56:15.001 --> 01:56:15.834
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't come apart right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if you had like two billiard </v>

2529
01:56:18.691 --> 01:56:19.524
<v Speaker 2>balls and you have like this big long </v>
<v Speaker 2>stick and there's two holes for the </v>

2530
01:56:22.891 --> 01:56:23.370
<v Speaker 2>builder bars.</v>

2531
01:56:23.370 --> 01:56:24.840
<v Speaker 2>They don't go in it like locked in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2532
01:56:24.841 --> 01:56:26.250
<v Speaker 2>just sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You spend that.</v>

2533
01:56:26.251 --> 01:56:27.600
<v Speaker 2>What's going to happen there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fly right off,</v>

2534
01:56:27.601 --> 01:56:28.434
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have all the weight on the </v>

2535
01:56:29.251 --> 01:56:30.084
<v Speaker 2>outside and you start spinning a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's like the political </v>

2536
01:56:31.711 --> 01:56:32.544
<v Speaker 2>conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That dynamic is going to rip the thing </v>

2537
01:56:33.901 --> 01:56:35.550
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more weight gets to the outside.</v>

2538
01:56:35.790 --> 01:56:36.623
<v Speaker 2>So one side go into the fringe doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean the other side should go to the </v>

2539
01:56:40.051 --> 01:56:41.910
<v Speaker 2>fringe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you tear a nation apart.</v>

2540
01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:43.493
<v Speaker 2>That actually makes a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can conceptualize it like an </v>

2541
01:56:45.481 --> 01:56:47.910
<v Speaker 2>object.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's really a damn good youtube video</v>

2542
01:56:47.911 --> 01:56:50.490
<v Speaker 2>floating around out there where somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>takes a jet of water in,</v>

2543
01:56:50.491 --> 01:56:51.324
<v Speaker 2>spins a skateboard wheel until the </v>
<v Speaker 2>centrifical force gets so high from it </v>

2544
01:56:54.511 --> 01:56:56.040
<v Speaker 2>spending so fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it rips it apart.</v>

2545
01:56:56.340 --> 01:56:57.173
<v Speaker 2>It's it's worth looking up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the hell you'd search </v>

2546
01:56:58.781 --> 01:56:59.614
<v Speaker 2>to find it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a powerful visual and you can </v>

2547
01:57:02.341 --> 01:57:04.500
<v Speaker 2>see it as stuff moves to the outside.</v>

2548
01:57:04.530 --> 01:57:05.363
<v Speaker 2>The centrifical force goes up and up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>up until finally the thing that the </v>

2549
01:57:08.461 --> 01:57:11.130
<v Speaker 2>structural integrity of the thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>spinning can't hold itself together.</v>

2550
01:57:11.150 --> 01:57:12.660
<v Speaker 2>Anyone it rips apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2551
01:57:12.750 --> 01:57:16.020
<v Speaker 2>listen gentlemen and a shout out to your</v>

<v Speaker 2>Where can they read them?</v>

2563
01:57:35.730 --> 01:57:39.390
<v Speaker 2>The best place to go is going to be to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go to our film makers youtube page,</v>

2564
01:57:39.391 --> 01:57:44.391
<v Speaker 2>mike naina on the youtube that just a n </v>
<v Speaker 2>a n a y and a and a y and so on.</v>

<v Speaker 2>some videos.</v>

2566
01:57:47.611 --> 01:57:48.444
<v Speaker 2>He's kind of playing with the footage </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's collecting for the </v>

2567
01:57:49.681 --> 01:57:50.514
<v Speaker 2>documentary.</v>

2568
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:51.383
<v Speaker 2>On top of that though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to the video we originally </v>

2569
01:57:53.251 --> 01:57:54.390
<v Speaker 2>released,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is on the page,</v>

2570
01:57:54.391 --> 01:57:55.224
<v Speaker 2>you can find it easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the link to the google drive is </v>

2571
01:57:57.331 --> 01:57:59.960
<v Speaker 2>linked to all of the documents we put </v>
<v Speaker 2>out winters.</v>

2572
01:58:00.150 --> 01:58:03.360
<v Speaker 2>We explained what every paper does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why we wrote it,</v>

2573
01:58:03.390 --> 01:58:05.520
<v Speaker 2>what we were trying to show with writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the papers,</v>

2574
01:58:05.521 --> 01:58:10.380
<v Speaker 2>what the problem is that we need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>address and what you know,</v>

2575
01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:13.740
<v Speaker 2>what we think that this shows and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can do.</v>

2576
01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:16.260
<v Speaker 2>It's all accessible through his youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel.</v>

2577
01:58:16.270 --> 01:58:17.103
<v Speaker 2>We're kind of making that a central hub </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so people can go there and explore </v>

2578
01:58:19.981 --> 01:58:21.990
<v Speaker 2>and watch some more videos of us and </v>
