<v Speaker 1>to you by blue apron.</v>

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Blue Apron is a really interesting new </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast sponsor at that I really enjoy </v>

3
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.220
<v Speaker 1>because I like cooking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've always been pretty cave man.</v>

4
00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Like in my cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really use recipes.</v>

5
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:17.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy cookbooks.</v>

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've read some recipes online for</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain things.</v>

7
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:23.460
<v Speaker 1>I got smoked ham before and things along</v>
<v Speaker 1>those lines.</v>

8
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:28.461
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never really set out and cooked </v>

9
00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:33.291
<v Speaker 1>meals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm under very specific or rigid </v>

10
00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:34.200
<v Speaker 1>instructions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:39.201
<v Speaker 1>buying certain amount of recipe </v>
<v Speaker 1>ingredients and measuring it out and </v>

12
00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:44.481
<v Speaker 1>I've never done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blue Apron and blue apron is a really </v>

13
00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:49.041
<v Speaker 1>unique program where they send you the </v>
<v Speaker 1>food every week with detailed </v>

14
00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>photographic directions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They send you the recipe.</v>

15
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>It's really easy to follow and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>delicious food.</v>

16
00:00:57.121 --> 00:01:01.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's like eating out at an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting restaurant and you get to do</v>

17
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 1>it yourself so you get this cool sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>of satisfaction after it's done.</v>

18
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Here's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For $9,</v>

19
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.660
<v Speaker 1>99 per meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll send you the right ingredients </v>

20
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.511
<v Speaker 1>in the exact right proportions with </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple recipe instructions right to your</v>

21
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:19.881
<v Speaker 1>door.</v>

22
00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:23.991
<v Speaker 1>per serving a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although you really wouldn't guess it </v>

23
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 1>because they're very delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

24
00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:29.301
<v Speaker 1>you would think that you're cheating.</v>

<v Speaker 1>com.</v>

93
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 1>That is o n n I t,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have not heard on it,</v>

94
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:32.020
<v Speaker 1>has the latest and greatest in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>kettlebell series.</v>

95
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.940
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

96
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.140
<v Speaker 1>the new ones are called the legend </v>
<v Speaker 1>kettle bells.</v>

97
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

98
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.410
<v Speaker 1>we're at a Zombie kettlebells for now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting them in,</v>

99
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.450
<v Speaker 1>but we now have the Werewolf and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Werewolf is a pretty dope delicious.</v>

100
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.210
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is 62 pounds.</v>

101
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.750
<v Speaker 1>All of the kettlebells that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the artistic kettlebells,</v>

102
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.950
<v Speaker 1>they are all three d balanced.</v>

103
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.970
<v Speaker 1>And what that means by 3d balances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look cool,</v>

104
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.510
<v Speaker 1>but they're also balanced correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

105
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 1>you don't want anything to be weighted </v>
<v Speaker 1>too heavily on one side.</v>

106
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 1>And that way it sort of defeats the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole purpose of making a Kettlebell.</v>

107
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 1>They also have extra large handles for </v>
<v Speaker 1>enhanced grip strength.</v>

108
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.210
<v Speaker 1>I can't say it enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a huge fan of working out with </v>

109
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.691
<v Speaker 1>kettlebells is the main method that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>use for strength and conditioning </v>

110
00:06:19.691 --> 00:06:19.691
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

111
00:06:19.691 --> 00:06:21.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's benefited true me tremendously.</v>

112
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they are is they're essentially </v>

113
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.570
<v Speaker 1>these giant balls of iron with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge metal handles,</v>

114
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 1>these iron handles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you swing them around and uh,</v>

115
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:38.140

<v Speaker 3>Rupert,</v>

174
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:38.850
<v Speaker 3>Rupert Sheldrake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

175
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.440
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

176
00:09:40.441 --> 00:09:40.850
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

177
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.390
<v Speaker 3>I came to know of you through the trial </v>
<v Speaker 3>logs that you did with Terence Mckenna,</v>

178
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:47.580
<v Speaker 3>who I'm a huge fan of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Ralph Abraham,</v>

179
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
<v Speaker 3>and I thought they were some really </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating conversations and you know,</v>

180
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.040
<v Speaker 3>all terrence's mp3s are very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very thought inspiring and made you </v>

181
00:09:58.591 --> 00:10:03.591
<v Speaker 3>really like look at things from a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>different in peculiar angle that he had </v>

182
00:10:03.591 --> 00:10:08.571
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a very unique way of looking at </v>

183
00:10:08.571 --> 00:10:10.221
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I came to know of you from that and </v>

184
00:10:10.221 --> 00:10:12.600
<v Speaker 3>I came to know of your ideas of morphic </v>
<v Speaker 3>resonance,</v>

185
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:17.900
<v Speaker 3>which I found to be really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't mind just explain to </v>

186
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:22.230
<v Speaker 3>folks at home listening what the concept</v>
<v Speaker 3>of morphic resonance is.</v>

187
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:27.910
<v Speaker 3>It's the idea of memory in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that the whole universe has a </v>

188
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.350
<v Speaker 3>kind of memory to so called laws of </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature are more like habits.</v>

189
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.640
<v Speaker 3>Each individual in this species draws on</v>
<v Speaker 3>a collective memory and contributes to </v>

190
00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:41.520
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It works on the base of similarity.</v>

191
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.760
<v Speaker 3>Any pattern of activity similar to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>later pattern of activity in a self </v>

192
00:10:46.831 --> 00:10:50.670
<v Speaker 3>organizing system influences it across </v>
<v Speaker 3>space and time.</v>

193
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:56.540
<v Speaker 3>So what it means in effect is that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you train rats to learn a new trick in </v>

194
00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:01.101
<v Speaker 3>Los Angeles and rats in New York and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Sydney and London will learn the same </v>

195
00:11:01.101 --> 00:11:05.601
<v Speaker 3>thing quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>straight away at the sanctuary evidence </v>

196
00:11:05.601 --> 00:11:10.161
<v Speaker 3>that this surprising effect happens if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you crystallize a new chemical that's </v>

197
00:11:10.161 --> 00:11:14.571
<v Speaker 3>never existed before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then after you've made him one </v>

198
00:11:14.571 --> 00:11:19.401
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should get easier to Christianize or </v>

199
00:11:19.401 --> 00:11:22.250
<v Speaker 3>all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's really a theory of habit and </v>

200
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:26.451
<v Speaker 3>memory and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it enables new patterns of learning to </v>

201
00:11:26.451 --> 00:11:27.990
<v Speaker 3>spread quicker than they might otherwise</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

202
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:33.470
<v Speaker 3>And it means that it should get easier </v>
<v Speaker 3>to learn things that other people have </v>

203
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:33.470
<v Speaker 3>already learned.</v>

204
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:34.810
<v Speaker 3>So this has been proven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

205
00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:39.840
<v Speaker 3>this concept of rats being able to learn</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing in New York a quicker because </v>

206
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.130
<v Speaker 3>they learned it already in San </v>
<v Speaker 3>Francisco.</v>

207
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:46.580
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it wasn't done to test morphic </v>

208
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:46.580
<v Speaker 3>resonance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is still very controversial.</v>

209
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:49.510
<v Speaker 3>It was done to test something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was done in,</v>

210
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.170
<v Speaker 3>in years ago before the Second World </v>
<v Speaker 3>War.</v>

211
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:57.620
<v Speaker 3>A professor at Harvard called William </v>
<v Speaker 3>McDougall wanted to find out if rats </v>

212
00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.620
<v Speaker 3>could learn quicker what their parents </v>
<v Speaker 3>had learned.</v>

213
00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:02.860
<v Speaker 3>So he trained these rats to escape from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the water maze.</v>

214
00:12:02.861 --> 00:12:05.800
<v Speaker 3>They had to swim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they went out the wrong exit,</v>

215
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.830
<v Speaker 3>they got an electric shock and if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't at the right exit,</v>

216
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.890
<v Speaker 3>which was the wrong one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was lit up with a light.</v>

217
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.040
<v Speaker 3>The other one was dim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they went out the right exit,</v>

218
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:20.150
<v Speaker 3>they just escaped from the maze and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>tested them to see how many trials </v>

219
00:12:20.411 --> 00:12:23.890
<v Speaker 3>they've made before they learned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always go out of the DMX.</v>

220
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:28.890
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the first generation took about 250 </v>

221
00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.460
<v Speaker 3>trials before they cottoned onto what </v>
<v Speaker 3>was happening.</v>

222
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.120
<v Speaker 3>The next generation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was about 180 trials.</v>

223
00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:36.160
<v Speaker 3>The next generation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about 150,</v>

224
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.620
<v Speaker 3>they got better and better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

225
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:44.340
<v Speaker 3>and he thought at first this was because</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was something being passed on to </v>

226
00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:48.790
<v Speaker 3>the children may be through modifying </v>
<v Speaker 3>the jeans or something like that,</v>

227
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.430
<v Speaker 3>an inheritance for client characters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a kind of taboo in 20th century</v>

228
00:12:54.431 --> 00:12:55.530
<v Speaker 3>science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

229
00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:01.350
<v Speaker 3>and so people questioned his work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because he was at Harvard and </v>

230
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.100
<v Speaker 3>because he was a famous professor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

231
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.520
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't just dismiss it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he showed a huge effect.</v>

232
00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:11.860
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people tried repeating his work in </v>

233
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.030
<v Speaker 3>the University of Edinburgh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scotland and Melbourne,</v>

234
00:13:13.031 --> 00:13:18.031
<v Speaker 3>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they found that there at started </v>

235
00:13:18.031 --> 00:13:21.991
<v Speaker 3>more or less where the Harvard rats had </v>
<v Speaker 3>left off and in Melbourne they did an </v>

236
00:13:22.031 --> 00:13:24.460
<v Speaker 3>experiment that was particularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

237
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.760
<v Speaker 3>They went on getting better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones that were descended from the </v>

238
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.180
<v Speaker 3>train parents in each generation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they found that all rats of that </v>

239
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:37.831
<v Speaker 3>breed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if their parents had never been </v>

240
00:13:37.831 --> 00:13:37.831
<v Speaker 3>trained,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're getting better too.</v>

241
00:13:37.831 --> 00:13:40.540
<v Speaker 3>So whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't something to do with modifying</v>

242
00:13:40.541 --> 00:13:43.780
<v Speaker 3>the genes or what people would now call </v>
<v Speaker 3>epigenetics.</v>

243
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:49.200
<v Speaker 3>There was something else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more mysterious going on and since </v>

244
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:49.220
<v Speaker 3>no one knew what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

245
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.490
<v Speaker 3>it was just ignored and forgotten.</v>

246
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:57.100
<v Speaker 1>That is really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would kind of make sense that </v>

247
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:03.170
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if somehow or another the jeans or </v>

248
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:07.691
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is in the rat is able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with other of the same </v>

249
00:14:07.941 --> 00:14:12.941
<v Speaker 1>species over the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a similar genetics of whatever it </v>

250
00:14:12.941 --> 00:14:16.121
<v Speaker 1>is that they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever undefined thing that they're </v>

251
00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:18.761
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connecting with them even across </v>

252
00:14:18.761 --> 00:14:19.610
<v Speaker 1>continents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the other side of the planet.</v>

253
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

254
00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.580
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the same mood.</v>

255
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:27.770
<v Speaker 3>I think the same happens in evolution </v>
<v Speaker 3>naturally in nature.</v>

256
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:33.780
<v Speaker 3>There was a famous case with um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>birds called blue tits and England and </v>

257
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:34.640
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you call them chickadees,</v>

258
00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:40.660
<v Speaker 3>put that in the 19 twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started rating milk bottles in Britain </v>

259
00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.660
<v Speaker 3>we had then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we still have a system where you get</v>

260
00:14:44.661 --> 00:14:49.661
<v Speaker 3>fresh milk delivered to your doorstep </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday in a bottle and then they wash </v>

261
00:14:49.661 --> 00:14:50.660
<v Speaker 3>the bottles and use them as a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

262
00:14:50.661 --> 00:14:53.870
<v Speaker 3>We have right now in London.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

263
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.150
<v Speaker 3>so in the 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 years they had caught,</v>

264
00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.830
<v Speaker 3>bought tops on these bottles and someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>gnosis in Southampton,</v>

265
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.850
<v Speaker 3>the cream at the top of their bottle had</v>
<v Speaker 3>disappeared.</v>

266
00:15:04.851 --> 00:15:07.090
<v Speaker 3>The top had been tornado and the cream </v>
<v Speaker 3>of disappeared.</v>

267
00:15:07.091 --> 00:15:12.091
<v Speaker 3>And when they watched,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sold that every morning these </v>

268
00:15:12.091 --> 00:15:14.680
<v Speaker 3>pollutants in Southampton had figured </v>
<v Speaker 3>out they could tear off this cardboard </v>

269
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.010
<v Speaker 3>strip and get free cream every morning.</v>

270
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:20.600
<v Speaker 3>And then everyone sort of interested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

271
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.720
<v Speaker 3>Then it turned up many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many miles away in another part of </v>

272
00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.290
<v Speaker 3>Britain and it turned up somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bluetooth's don't fly very far.</v>

273
00:15:27.291 --> 00:15:31.070
<v Speaker 3>Their home loving birds and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>migrate.</v>

274
00:15:31.071 --> 00:15:32.330
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

275
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:37.690
<v Speaker 3>scientists got interested and they set </v>
<v Speaker 3>up a network all over Britain of people </v>

276
00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.500
<v Speaker 3>to observe this habit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they got reports.</v>

277
00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:44.120
<v Speaker 3>It was coordinated from Cambridge </v>
<v Speaker 3>University and they mapped the spread of</v>

278
00:15:44.121 --> 00:15:49.121
<v Speaker 3>the habit and it became clear that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was spreading faster and faster and it </v>

279
00:15:49.121 --> 00:15:52.610
<v Speaker 3>was being independently invest in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>invented in other parts of Britain.</v>

280
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.300
<v Speaker 3>So much so that the professor of biology</v>
<v Speaker 3>at Oxford surrenders to hardy,</v>

281
00:15:57.301 --> 00:16:02.301
<v Speaker 3>suggested it must be happening by </v>
<v Speaker 3>telepathy and that it was spreading too </v>

282
00:16:02.301 --> 00:16:06.881
<v Speaker 3>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the most interesting records from </v>

283
00:16:06.881 --> 00:16:08.360
<v Speaker 3>Holland because this started happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Holland as well.</v>

284
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:13.930
<v Speaker 3>And during the war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holland was occupied by the Germans and </v>

285
00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:14.300
<v Speaker 3>milk deliveries stopped.</v>

286
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.050
<v Speaker 3>They didn't start again until about </v>
<v Speaker 3>1948,</v>

287
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:23.710
<v Speaker 3>but seven or eight years after they </v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped Bluetooth's only live three or </v>

288
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:27.251
<v Speaker 3>four years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there would've been no bluetooth's </v>

289
00:16:27.251 --> 00:16:28.310
<v Speaker 3>after the war that remembered the golden</v>
<v Speaker 3>age of free cream.</v>

290
00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:29.780
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

291
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they milk deliveries began again in</v>

292
00:16:32.931 --> 00:16:37.931
<v Speaker 3>Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they started drinking the cream almost </v>

293
00:16:37.931 --> 00:16:38.270
<v Speaker 3>straightaway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all over Holland.</v>

294
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:42.920
<v Speaker 3>So I would say this is a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>collective memory that spread by morphic</v>

295
00:16:42.921 --> 00:16:45.530
<v Speaker 3>resonance and was remembered by morphic </v>
<v Speaker 3>resonance.</v>

296
00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's another example of this going</v>

297
00:16:49.161 --> 00:16:51.950
<v Speaker 3>on in the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Incidentally,</v>

298
00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've now stopped doing it.</v>

299
00:16:54.081 --> 00:16:59.081
<v Speaker 3>They used to steal our cream in London </v>
<v Speaker 3>until about 10 years ago when we </v>

300
00:16:59.081 --> 00:17:02.930
<v Speaker 3>switched to semi skimmed milk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There isn't any cream on bottles of semi</v>

301
00:17:02.931 --> 00:17:07.931
<v Speaker 3>skimmed milk and Bluetooth's have more </v>
<v Speaker 3>or less given up in Britain because 70 </v>

302
00:17:07.931 --> 00:17:08.450
<v Speaker 3>people have switched to semi skimmed </v>
<v Speaker 3>milk.</v>

303
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.940
<v Speaker 3>They don't get any cream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not worth the effort.</v>

304
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:13.700
<v Speaker 3>So I'm at the habits died out.</v>

305
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:19.320
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that human beings start off as </v>

306
00:17:20.861 --> 00:17:25.861
<v Speaker 1>a blank slate has really been questioned</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a bit over the last generation and</v>

307
00:17:28.211 --> 00:17:33.211
<v Speaker 1>a genetics in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're starting to understand that </v>

308
00:17:33.211 --> 00:17:36.601
<v Speaker 1>there's certain particular traits and </v>
<v Speaker 1>memories that you can actually learn </v>

309
00:17:36.601 --> 00:17:40.591
<v Speaker 1>from your parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was one study they did with </v>

310
00:17:40.591 --> 00:17:42.571
<v Speaker 1>mice where they had taken mice and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had given them an electric shock and </v>

311
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.680
<v Speaker 1>coincided that electric shock with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>smell of citrus hill.</v>

312
00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.940
<v Speaker 1>There was electric shock and their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you aware of this test?</v>

313
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.680
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am.</v>

314
00:17:49.681 --> 00:17:53.460
<v Speaker 3>It was published in nature with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>provocative title,</v>

315
00:17:53.461 --> 00:17:56.940
<v Speaker 3>inheriting the fears of fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very,</v>

316
00:17:56.941 --> 00:17:59.850
<v Speaker 3>very fascinating study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing staff.</v>

317
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean that I think could be partly due </v>
<v Speaker 3>to morphic resonance,</v>

318
00:18:03.431 --> 00:18:05.900
<v Speaker 3>so have you explained it to people </v>
<v Speaker 3>before?</v>

319
00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.070
<v Speaker 3>I might have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but please do.</v>

320
00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:13.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they did was they used a chemical </v>

321
00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.350
<v Speaker 3>synthetic chemical called acetone for </v>
<v Speaker 3>known that smells sort of vaguely </v>

322
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.030
<v Speaker 3>fruity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's something that mice would never</v>

323
00:18:18.031 --> 00:18:23.031
<v Speaker 3>have encountered in nature because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a synthetic chemical and they took male </v>

324
00:18:23.031 --> 00:18:27.831
<v Speaker 3>mice and expose them to smell of acetone</v>
<v Speaker 3>who known and they gave them a mild </v>

325
00:18:28.021 --> 00:18:31.860
<v Speaker 3>electric shock on their poor when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>smelled this stuff.</v>

326
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:37.500
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the result is classical Pavlovian </v>

327
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:37.500
<v Speaker 3>conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

328
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:41.340
<v Speaker 3>a few times of that happening as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 3>they smelled acetone now.</v>

329
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.360
<v Speaker 3>And they were terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm perfectly standard stuff in science.</v>

330
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.200
<v Speaker 3>What wasn't standard was the then bread </v>
<v Speaker 3>from these mice and they did some of the</v>

331
00:18:52.201 --> 00:18:57.201
<v Speaker 3>experiments using artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>insemination so that the mothers never </v>

332
00:18:57.201 --> 00:18:59.010
<v Speaker 3>even met the fathers of the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>generation.</v>

333
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:04.700
<v Speaker 3>And then they tested their children and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their grandchildren and whenever they </v>

334
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.420
<v Speaker 3>smelt acetone for known,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were just paralyzed with fear.</v>

335
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:11.670
<v Speaker 3>So the inherited the fear of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical in a single generation,</v>

336
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:17.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way that regular science simply </v>

337
00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:17.330
<v Speaker 3>can't explain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

338
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:21.510
<v Speaker 3>and this went far beyond anything anyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have expected.</v>

339
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:27.740
<v Speaker 3>There's evidence from the details of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiments that involved some changes </v>

340
00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:31.731
<v Speaker 3>in the sperm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some change in the genes or the </v>

341
00:19:31.731 --> 00:19:33.090
<v Speaker 3>epigenetics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the packaging if the genes,</v>

342
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:39.380
<v Speaker 3>but no one can conceive how a mouse </v>
<v Speaker 3>learning to avoid this smell and being </v>

343
00:19:40.861 --> 00:19:45.861
<v Speaker 3>frightened by it all that they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knows how all that information could be </v>

344
00:19:45.861 --> 00:19:46.920
<v Speaker 3>transferred into genes and the sperm.</v>

345
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:51.450
<v Speaker 3>So I think at least part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>explanation of this is morphic resonance</v>

346
00:19:51.451 --> 00:19:56.451
<v Speaker 3>that if you make some animals adverse to</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

347
00:19:56.761 --> 00:19:58.680
<v Speaker 3>then they're deciding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

348
00:19:58.681 --> 00:20:02.340
<v Speaker 3>other animals have the same kind will be</v>
<v Speaker 3>frightened of it.</v>

349
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:08.240
<v Speaker 3>I did a very similar experiments </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually years ago with a skeptical </v>

350
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.980
<v Speaker 3>scientist in Britain called Steven rose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

351
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.610
<v Speaker 3>we had a controversy in the Guardian </v>
<v Speaker 3>newspaper.</v>

352
00:20:14.611 --> 00:20:17.340
<v Speaker 3>I wrote her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to write a column in the Guardian</v>

353
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.840
<v Speaker 3>and I wrote a thing about the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 3>memory and how morphic resonance helps </v>

354
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.380
<v Speaker 3>to explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can discuss that later if you'd like,</v>

355
00:20:25.381 --> 00:20:30.381
<v Speaker 3>but that rose was outraged by this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd spent his whole career working on </v>

356
00:20:30.381 --> 00:20:35.301
<v Speaker 3>memory saying must be inside the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he worked with day old chicks and in</v>

357
00:20:37.051 --> 00:20:42.051
<v Speaker 3>the Guardian he wrote a response to my </v>
<v Speaker 3>article and challenged me to do an </v>

358
00:20:42.051 --> 00:20:46.491
<v Speaker 3>experiment in his laboratory under his </v>
<v Speaker 3>supervision to test what he called this </v>

359
00:20:46.491 --> 00:20:48.220
<v Speaker 3>seemingly absurd hypothesis.</v>

360
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:50.650
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

361
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:52.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the,</v>

362
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:57.600
<v Speaker 3>the experiment we did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had dale chicks and Dale chicks peck </v>

363
00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:03.080
<v Speaker 3>at anything bright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we had them packet silvery bead work.</v>

364
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:09.090
<v Speaker 3>And after the silverbeet they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>injected with saline solution is just a </v>

365
00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:09.090
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

366
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:12.730
<v Speaker 3>they didn't feel early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything was fine.</v>

367
00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:18.210
<v Speaker 3>We also had them pack at a yellow light </v>
<v Speaker 3>emitting diode and after they'd packed </v>

368
00:21:19.541 --> 00:21:21.580
<v Speaker 3>at that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the checks that had packed at the yellow</v>

369
00:21:21.581 --> 00:21:25.990
<v Speaker 3>light emitting diode were injected with </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that made them feel sick.</v>

370
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.330
<v Speaker 3>Lithium chloride,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was,</v>

371
00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.740
<v Speaker 3>it made them feel sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't kill me,</v>

372
00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.190
<v Speaker 3>it just made them feel ill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

373
00:21:33.191 --> 00:21:35.960
<v Speaker 3>if you ever eat anything and you feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>sick after it,</v>

374
00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.990
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never want to eat that thing again.</v>

375
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.040
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

376
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.930
<v Speaker 3>it's called conditioned to Vashon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so these checks,</v>

377
00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.730
<v Speaker 3>when you tested them a day or two later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would avoid yellow lights,</v>

378
00:21:48.731 --> 00:21:52.450
<v Speaker 3>but they'd pack at the chrome bead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the silverbeet,</v>

379
00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:56.770
<v Speaker 3>which hadn't made them sick and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>straightforward.</v>

380
00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:00.170
<v Speaker 3>They learned to avoid it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I predicted was that in,</v>

381
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:05.230
<v Speaker 3>so we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we did the experiment over and over </v>

382
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.471
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every day we get a new batch of fresh </v>

383
00:22:07.471 --> 00:22:10.081
<v Speaker 3>chicks and test them with the yellow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a light emitting diode and the chrome </v>

384
00:22:10.181 --> 00:22:11.270
<v Speaker 3>bead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

385
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:16.210
<v Speaker 3>I predicted that they'd start avoiding </v>
<v Speaker 3>the yellow light emitting diode.</v>

386
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not the chrome bead,</v>

387
00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:22.960
<v Speaker 3>because of the influence by morphic </v>
<v Speaker 3>resonance from previous checks.</v>

388
00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:28.140
<v Speaker 3>They'd start avoiding it even before </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd been made of us to it for the </v>

389
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:28.870
<v Speaker 3>first time they were exposed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

390
00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.480
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't go for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd,</v>

391
00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:35.470
<v Speaker 3>they'd be more wary of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's exactly what happened in this</v>

392
00:22:35.471 --> 00:22:36.780
<v Speaker 3>experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

393
00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:42.780
<v Speaker 3>so this is actually something that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>well known in the rat poison industry.</v>

394
00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:48.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people haven't spent much time </v>

395
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.450
<v Speaker 3>looking into the rat poison industry and</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it works.</v>

396
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:54.450
<v Speaker 3>But one thing that happens to people who</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to poison rats for a living is that </v>

397
00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:59.560
<v Speaker 3>if you try some new kind of bait with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular flavor,</v>

398
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:04.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm rats eat it and they get sick and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they die.</v>

399
00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:07.180
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it works for awhile.</v>

400
00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.610
<v Speaker 3>But after awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rat start avoiding it.</v>

401
00:23:09.611 --> 00:23:12.220
<v Speaker 3>They become what's called in the trade </v>
<v Speaker 3>bait shy,</v>

402
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:14.830
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not just in one place,</v>

403
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:17.400
<v Speaker 3>but the bait stops working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

404
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.640
<v Speaker 3>miles and miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have to keep inventing new bates.</v>

405
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:27.630
<v Speaker 3>That's why most rat poison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no is based on warfare in which causes </v>

406
00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.800
<v Speaker 3>bleeding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

407
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:34.830
<v Speaker 3>thins the blood and causes bleeding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it doesn't usually affect the rats </v>

408
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:38.701
<v Speaker 3>for days after they've eaten it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't associate it with any </v>

409
00:23:38.701 --> 00:23:40.930
<v Speaker 3>particular flavor because it's slow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slow acting.</v>

410
00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:46.320
<v Speaker 3>That's why people have had to switch to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Warfarin as the main rat poison because </v>

411
00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:51.100
<v Speaker 3>this aversion to things that poison </v>
<v Speaker 3>became so strong and to something that </v>

412
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.730
<v Speaker 3>actually some people who are listening </v>
<v Speaker 3>to us might know about,</v>

413
00:23:55.731 --> 00:24:00.731
<v Speaker 3>which I heard from a guy in America who </v>
<v Speaker 3>fishes for Bass and he was telling me </v>

414
00:24:02.181 --> 00:24:06.860
<v Speaker 3>there's a constant development of new </v>
<v Speaker 3>lawyers for bass fishing.</v>

415
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:07.740
<v Speaker 3>I do do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

416
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.830
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do fish quite a bit.</v>

417
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:14.890
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well apparently people are always </v>

418
00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.660
<v Speaker 3>inventing new lawyers that worked very </v>
<v Speaker 3>well for awhile and apparently then they</v>

419
00:24:17.661 --> 00:24:22.010
<v Speaker 3>stopped working and not just in one </v>
<v Speaker 3>place but elsewhere.</v>

420
00:24:22.011 --> 00:24:24.320
<v Speaker 3>So it was a constant development of new </v>
<v Speaker 3>lawyers.</v>

421
00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.140
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that could be documented,</v>

422
00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:32.420
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that might be another very interesting </v>

423
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.691
<v Speaker 3>case of morphic resonance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If Bass keep getting caught and they're </v>

424
00:24:34.691 --> 00:24:37.160
<v Speaker 3>in pain when they're caught by being </v>
<v Speaker 3>finished with a particular kind of Leer,</v>

425
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:42.230
<v Speaker 3>then other bass later evening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different rivers or lakes,</v>

426
00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:44.070
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

427
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.150
<v Speaker 3>when they see that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

428
00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.290
<v Speaker 3>it would be more averse to biting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it stops working.</v>

429
00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:51.740
<v Speaker 3>So I think there could be many examples </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this.</v>

430
00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm out there in the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did you come up with this concept?</v>

431
00:24:55.521 --> 00:24:57.710
<v Speaker 3>Is this your concept,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the concept of morphic resonance?</v>

432
00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:58.790
<v Speaker 3>Resonance?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

433
00:24:58.790 --> 00:24:59.360
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

434
00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:03.260
<v Speaker 3>I came up with this in 1973,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time ago.</v>

435
00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.220
<v Speaker 3>I was doing research at Cambridge </v>
<v Speaker 3>University on plant development,</v>

436
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:12.850
<v Speaker 3>how plants grow and I became convinced </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a variety of reasons that,</v>

437
00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:19.290
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the attempt to explain the whole thing </v>

438
00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:21.620
<v Speaker 3>just in terms of genes and molecules and</v>
<v Speaker 3>proteins wouldn't work.</v>

439
00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at the very leading edge of this.</v>

440
00:25:25.371 --> 00:25:30.371
<v Speaker 3>I mean the main plant hormone is called </v>
<v Speaker 3>Oxen Aux Ian and I figured out how it's </v>

441
00:25:31.581 --> 00:25:34.070
<v Speaker 3>made and then I figured out how it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>transplanted,</v>

442
00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:39.220
<v Speaker 3>transported around the plant and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a massive advance and this is kind </v>

443
00:25:40.551 --> 00:25:42.410
<v Speaker 3>of textbook stuff now in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

444
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:45.380
<v Speaker 3>in school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in University of textbooks,</v>

445
00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:50.780
<v Speaker 3>the mechanism of polar oxygen transport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So having figured all that out,</v>

446
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:57.520
<v Speaker 3>I then realized this wasn't enough to </v>
<v Speaker 3>explain plants because all plants have </v>

447
00:25:58.071 --> 00:26:03.071
<v Speaker 3>the same hormone and it's moved in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same way in every plant and it's moved </v>

448
00:26:03.071 --> 00:26:04.850
<v Speaker 3>to the same way and petals and leaves </v>
<v Speaker 3>and stems and roots.</v>

449
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:08.990
<v Speaker 3>And it's moved to the same way in palms </v>
<v Speaker 3>and cabbages and roses,</v>

450
00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:14.290
<v Speaker 3>and yet they're all different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I got interested in something in </v>

451
00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:19.000
<v Speaker 3>biology called morphogenetic fields,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of invisible fields,</v>

452
00:26:19.001 --> 00:26:24.001
<v Speaker 3>the shape living organisms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's like an invisible mold as a </v>

453
00:26:24.001 --> 00:26:28.901
<v Speaker 3>flower grows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of invisible mold that shapes </v>

454
00:26:28.901 --> 00:26:32.180
<v Speaker 3>the way the petals develop and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>flower develops or as a leaf grows,</v>

455
00:26:32.181 --> 00:26:35.840
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of invisible mold for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>leaf called the morphogenetic field,</v>

456
00:26:35.841 --> 00:26:40.340
<v Speaker 3>like a kind of an invisible plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This idea was not invented by me,</v>

457
00:26:40.341 --> 00:26:43.440
<v Speaker 3>it had been around in biology since the </v>
<v Speaker 3>19 years,</v>

458
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Speaker 3>but the key thing was to understand how </v>
<v Speaker 3>these fields could be inherited.</v>

459
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.040
<v Speaker 3>And I was sure it wouldn't go through </v>
<v Speaker 3>the jeans,</v>

460
00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:51.930
<v Speaker 3>the jeans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just code for proteins.</v>

461
00:26:51.931 --> 00:26:54.270
<v Speaker 3>So they had to be some other kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>inheritance.</v>

462
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:59.630
<v Speaker 3>How could it work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was wrestling with this idea in </v>

463
00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:01.590
<v Speaker 3>Cambridge and then the idea of morphic </v>
<v Speaker 3>resonance came to me.</v>

464
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.770
<v Speaker 3>If you have a resonance across time </v>
<v Speaker 3>between similar things,</v>

465
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:10.100
<v Speaker 3>you could explain this inheritance of </v>
<v Speaker 3>form and have instincts in animals in a </v>

466
00:27:10.531 --> 00:27:14.040
<v Speaker 3>non-genetic way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which would give a completely new way of</v>

467
00:27:14.041 --> 00:27:18.870
<v Speaker 3>understanding biology and inheritance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I then realized that this would apply to</v>

468
00:27:18.871 --> 00:27:22.500
<v Speaker 3>learning and memory and many aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 3>human behavior.</v>

469
00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.620
<v Speaker 3>So I wrote this up in a book called a </v>
<v Speaker 3>new science of life,</v>

470
00:27:25.621 --> 00:27:30.390
<v Speaker 3>which was published in 1981.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took me years to think this through.</v>

471
00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:32.580
<v Speaker 3>I realized that it would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>controversial.</v>

472
00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:37.960
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I had to be very sure of myself </v>

473
00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.881
<v Speaker 3>before I could write about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I wrote another book called the </v>

474
00:27:40.881 --> 00:27:44.271
<v Speaker 3>presence of the past which puts the </v>
<v Speaker 3>theory forward in its fullest form.</v>

475
00:27:45.631 --> 00:27:50.631
<v Speaker 3>And that's my main theoretical book and </v>
<v Speaker 3>since then I've really been trying to </v>

476
00:27:50.631 --> 00:27:52.170
<v Speaker 3>develop these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>test them,</v>

477
00:27:52.171 --> 00:27:53.880
<v Speaker 3>do experiments and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

478
00:27:53.881 --> 00:27:58.881
<v Speaker 3>it was my idea in the first place and </v>
<v Speaker 3>since then it's become widely discussed </v>

479
00:27:58.881 --> 00:27:59.790
<v Speaker 3>in many areas.</v>

480
00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.680
<v Speaker 3>And when you say that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

481
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:07.160
<v Speaker 3>had to be sure of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did you do that made you sure of </v>

482
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:07.160
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

483
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:07.590
<v Speaker 3>what is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

484
00:28:07.591 --> 00:28:12.591
<v Speaker 3>what kind of testing have you done to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of hammer out this concept of </v>

485
00:28:13.411 --> 00:28:15.630
<v Speaker 3>morphic residence?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

486
00:28:15.631 --> 00:28:17.790
<v Speaker 3>there were two aspects to being sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

487
00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:23.210
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the main objection that I got from my </v>

488
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:24.480
<v Speaker 3>colleagues and in the scientific world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in biology,</v>

489
00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.990
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was not that they not.</v>

490
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:29.730
<v Speaker 3>What's the evidence?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't say,</v>

491
00:28:29.731 --> 00:28:34.731
<v Speaker 3>what's the evidence they just said this </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea is unnecessary because we're going </v>

492
00:28:34.731 --> 00:28:37.020
<v Speaker 3>to figure everything out in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>genes and molecular biology.</v>

493
00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:42.520
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so one line of research I had to do was </v>

494
00:28:43.261 --> 00:28:47.760
<v Speaker 3>to see whether the conventional approach</v>
<v Speaker 3>in biology was likely to work or not.</v>

495
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:53.310
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I had to think really deep about </v>

496
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:53.440
<v Speaker 3>standard science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

497
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.100
<v Speaker 3>is this going to work it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just said,</v>

498
00:28:56.101 --> 00:28:56.760
<v Speaker 3>give us time.</v>

499
00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.130
<v Speaker 3>We'll figure it all that we don't need </v>
<v Speaker 3>new ideas.</v>

500
00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:02.070
<v Speaker 3>We basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's fine the way it is.</v>

501
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:07.760
<v Speaker 3>And that's what led in the 19 eighties </v>
<v Speaker 3>to people formulating the human genome </v>

502
00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.201
<v Speaker 3>project and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which culminated in the year 2000 with </v>

503
00:29:12.201 --> 00:29:17.151
<v Speaker 3>the publication of the human genome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they thought that that was adequate </v>

504
00:29:17.151 --> 00:29:18.540
<v Speaker 3>to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once they got into the human genome,</v>

505
00:29:18.541 --> 00:29:19.800
<v Speaker 3>once they mapped it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was going to,</v>

506
00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:22.230
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be able explain pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>much everything about human being.</v>

507
00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.090
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They actually thought that.</v>

508
00:29:24.091 --> 00:29:26.250
<v Speaker 3>And that's why there was a huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>investment.</v>

509
00:29:26.251 --> 00:29:31.251
<v Speaker 3>Hundreds of billions of dollars were </v>
<v Speaker 3>invested in genomics and biotechnology </v>

510
00:29:31.251 --> 00:29:33.060
<v Speaker 3>on the grounds that gene's explain </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

511
00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:38.390
<v Speaker 3>One Gene,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one characteristic does a gene for </v>

512
00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:41.421
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can figure out the genes and </v>

513
00:29:41.421 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 3>manipulate the genes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically you can control life.</v>

514
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:45.190
<v Speaker 3>And if you can own the genes or own </v>
<v Speaker 3>patients on the jeans,</v>

515
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.780
<v Speaker 3>you can make billions of dollars.</v>

516
00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:50.170
<v Speaker 3>That was the thinking and that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost everybody was into that.</v>

517
00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:53.680
<v Speaker 3>But I was convinced that genes were </v>
<v Speaker 3>grossly overrated,</v>

518
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:57.040
<v Speaker 3>that they couldn't do most of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that people thought they could.</v>

519
00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:02.500
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because what genes do is code for the </v>

520
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.731
<v Speaker 3>sequence of amino acids in proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>protein molecules which make up our </v>

521
00:30:05.731 --> 00:30:09.700
<v Speaker 3>muscles and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the blood cells and they're the enzymes.</v>

522
00:30:09.701 --> 00:30:11.440
<v Speaker 3>And so on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a major part of life.</v>

523
00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:15.880
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a coded for by genes,</v>

524
00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:21.450
<v Speaker 3>but there's a huge difference between </v>
<v Speaker 3>making the right proteins and the shape </v>

525
00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:21.760
<v Speaker 3>of your nose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

526
00:30:21.761 --> 00:30:24.100
<v Speaker 3>or the instincts of a spider to spin a </v>
<v Speaker 3>web.</v>

527
00:30:24.101 --> 00:30:25.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

528
00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:29.950
<v Speaker 3>it's like saying you could explain the </v>
<v Speaker 3>structure of the building by knowing the</v>

529
00:30:29.951 --> 00:30:34.951
<v Speaker 3>chemistry of the bricks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you have to have breaks and you </v>

530
00:30:34.951 --> 00:30:35.650
<v Speaker 3>have to have cement and timber and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make a building.</v>

531
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you have defective bricks,</v>

532
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:43.410
<v Speaker 3>you get a defective building,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't explain the plan of the </v>

533
00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:43.410
<v Speaker 3>building,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shape of the building.</v>

534
00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:48.720
<v Speaker 3>So I was convinced that these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>would never be explained by genes that </v>

535
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:53.491
<v Speaker 3>we needed something like morphogenetic </v>
<v Speaker 3>fields and morphic resonance to explain </v>

536
00:30:53.491 --> 00:30:58.381
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So part of thinking about this was </v>

537
00:30:58.381 --> 00:31:01.570
<v Speaker 3>thinking hard about what regular science</v>
<v Speaker 3>coach and could not achieve.</v>

538
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.380
<v Speaker 3>And incidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll come to the evidence in a minute,</v>

539
00:31:05.381 --> 00:31:06.350
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

540
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:12.610
<v Speaker 3>one of my predictions that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>biotechnology thing would be a disaster.</v>

541
00:31:12.611 --> 00:31:15.940
<v Speaker 3>It would mean people lose huge amounts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of money.</v>

542
00:31:15.941 --> 00:31:18.460
<v Speaker 3>I advised my friends if they are </v>
<v Speaker 3>investors,</v>

543
00:31:18.461 --> 00:31:20.720
<v Speaker 3>just don't bother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

544
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:25.800
<v Speaker 3>the only way you make money in this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>by getting in on the bubble and selling </v>

545
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.311
<v Speaker 3>art in time because it's not really </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to lead to that many useful </v>

546
00:31:29.311 --> 00:31:29.311
<v Speaker 3>product.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you so convinced?</v>

547
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:33.910
<v Speaker 3>Because I thought that the role of genes</v>
<v Speaker 3>was totally overrated and um,</v>

548
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:39.480
<v Speaker 3>this is in fact what's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were you alone in this or were there </v>

549
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:39.480
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few people.</v>

550
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.500
<v Speaker 3>There are a few people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most people went along with this,</v>

551
00:31:41.501 --> 00:31:43.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>

552
00:31:43.931 --> 00:31:47.890
<v Speaker 3>You see that the human genome project,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they expected they'd have about 100,000</v>

553
00:31:47.891 --> 00:31:52.891
<v Speaker 3>genes that turned out when they finally </v>
<v Speaker 3>announced that there were only about </v>

554
00:31:52.891 --> 00:31:53.500
<v Speaker 3>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>genes,</v>

555
00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:59.350
<v Speaker 3>we have less genes in the Seattle region</v>
<v Speaker 3>and about half as many as a rice plant.</v>

556
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:05.370
<v Speaker 3>That was a huge surprise to people and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it soon became clear that it wasn't </v>

557
00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.870
<v Speaker 3>going to deliver on most of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>promises.</v>

558
00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:13.000
<v Speaker 3>Craig venter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who had the private genome project,</v>

559
00:32:13.001 --> 00:32:15.400
<v Speaker 3>which was a rival of the publicly funded</v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

560
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.240
<v Speaker 3>He's in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very competitive guy.</v>

561
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.900
<v Speaker 3>Got He got there first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

562
00:32:22.901 --> 00:32:25.630
<v Speaker 3>he saw it as a race and he was going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>win and he did.</v>

563
00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

564
00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:34.200
<v Speaker 3>even though he was technically very </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful and the publicly funded </v>

565
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.740
<v Speaker 3>genome project was technically </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful,</v>

566
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:41.190
<v Speaker 3>once they'd done it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it became immediately apparent this </v>

567
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:42.860
<v Speaker 3>information was almost useless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Craig venter's,</v>

568
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:49.060
<v Speaker 3>his company is Celera genomics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shares collapsed in a few days from </v>

569
00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.920
<v Speaker 3>about $60 a share to about twelve cents </v>
<v Speaker 3>a share.</v>

570
00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.880
<v Speaker 3>And when he was interviewed after that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said he's got a great sense of humor.</v>

571
00:32:55.881 --> 00:32:56.960
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

572
00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:02.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm a guy who's made a million the hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>way by working my way down from a </v>

573
00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:02.140
<v Speaker 3>billion.</v>

574
00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:07.920
<v Speaker 3>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't work.</v>

575
00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:11.850
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in around four or five years ago,</v>

576
00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:16.910
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a development in science that </v>

577
00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:16.910
<v Speaker 3>most people haven't heard of yet outside</v>
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>

578
00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:21.771
<v Speaker 3>but it's really big within the </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific journals called the missing </v>

579
00:33:21.771 --> 00:33:25.611
<v Speaker 3>heritability problem at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they did is they took the genomes </v>

580
00:33:25.611 --> 00:33:30.111
<v Speaker 3>of 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>different people because it's quite </v>

581
00:33:30.111 --> 00:33:32.211
<v Speaker 3>cheap now to sequence genomes sequenced </v>
<v Speaker 3>about 30,000</v>

582
00:33:32.341 --> 00:33:36.570
<v Speaker 3>genomes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to figure out what genes do what you</v>

583
00:33:36.571 --> 00:33:39.810
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they looked at the people,</v>

584
00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:44.840
<v Speaker 3>30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that they knew everything about </v>

585
00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:44.840
<v Speaker 3>their height,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their diseases history and so forth.</v>

586
00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.580
<v Speaker 3>They started with height [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 3>heights,</v>

587
00:33:47.581 --> 00:33:52.581
<v Speaker 3>easy to measure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just need a tape measure and it's </v>

588
00:33:52.581 --> 00:33:53.580
<v Speaker 3>already known that tall parents tend to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have taught children in short,</v>

589
00:33:53.581 --> 00:33:58.581
<v Speaker 3>parents tend to have short children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can predict the height of children </v>

590
00:33:58.581 --> 00:34:02.451
<v Speaker 3>when they're grown on the basis of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>parent's height with an accuracy of </v>

591
00:34:02.451 --> 00:34:02.451
<v Speaker 3>about 80 percent.</v>

592
00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:07.910
<v Speaker 3>And in the technical language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say height is 80 percent heritable.</v>

593
00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:14.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd figured out that the genes </v>

594
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.900
<v Speaker 3>complete genome of 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>different people.</v>

595
00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:21.260
<v Speaker 3>They knew their height,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they then ran all these correlations </v>

596
00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.190
<v Speaker 3>and statistics to figure out which genes</v>
<v Speaker 3>are involved in height.</v>

597
00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:27.090
<v Speaker 3>And they found about 50 genes are </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in controlling height.</v>

598
00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.810
<v Speaker 3>Then they say they found some are more </v>
<v Speaker 3>important than others.</v>

599
00:34:30.811 --> 00:34:35.811
<v Speaker 3>So they made their best models waiting </v>
<v Speaker 3>some more than others and coming out </v>

600
00:34:35.811 --> 00:34:38.520
<v Speaker 3>with predictions and then they picked </v>
<v Speaker 3>some people at random.</v>

601
00:34:38.521 --> 00:34:41.030
<v Speaker 3>The genomes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd did all their sums.</v>

602
00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.100
<v Speaker 3>They'd identified the genes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they ran the computer simulations,</v>

603
00:34:44.101 --> 00:34:47.040
<v Speaker 3>and they predicted these people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>heights on the base of their genome,</v>

604
00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:51.090
<v Speaker 3>and then they looked up the height to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see how good this method was.</v>

605
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:55.230
<v Speaker 3>It turned out they could predict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hiked with an accuracy of five percent.</v>

606
00:34:55.770 --> 00:35:00.060
<v Speaker 3>Now you can do it with an actress of 80 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent just by using tape measures in a</v>

607
00:35:00.061 --> 00:35:01.890
<v Speaker 3>way that it's billions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheaper.</v>

608
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

609
00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:04.880
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

610
00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:05.780
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

611
00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.490
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gap between the five percent and the</v>

612
00:35:08.491 --> 00:35:13.491
<v Speaker 3>80 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 75 percent is not explained by the </v>

613
00:35:13.491 --> 00:35:17.001
<v Speaker 3>genes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is called the missing heritability </v>

614
00:35:17.001 --> 00:35:19.050
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it turned out that the same was true</v>

615
00:35:19.051 --> 00:35:22.410
<v Speaker 3>of most diseases for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a few diseases where a defective</v>

616
00:35:22.411 --> 00:35:26.330
<v Speaker 3>gene gives a defective protein and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get a clear predictive values.</v>

617
00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:29.520
<v Speaker 3>Cystic fibrosis is one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sickle cell anemia is another.</v>

618
00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:34.760
<v Speaker 3>So there's a few rare genetic diseases </v>
<v Speaker 3>where this method works very well,</v>

619
00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.690
<v Speaker 3>but for most diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>breast,</v>

620
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:42.410
<v Speaker 3>cardiac problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the predictive value of the GE name </v>

621
00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:43.290
<v Speaker 3>turned out to be only five to 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>

622
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:49.040
<v Speaker 3>And all these companies sprang up that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would offer to sequence people's </v>

623
00:35:49.681 --> 00:35:54.681
<v Speaker 3>genomes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And predict their diseases and the last </v>

624
00:35:54.681 --> 00:35:54.681
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>23 and me,</v>

625
00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:57.430
<v Speaker 3>it was put out of business by the FDA,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

626
00:35:57.590 --> 00:36:02.070
<v Speaker 3>just a few months ago because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>advertising was misleading.</v>

627
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:06.150
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they cannot predict with more than about</v>

628
00:36:06.151 --> 00:36:11.151
<v Speaker 3>10 percent accuracy the likelihood that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll get a particular gi disease on </v>

629
00:36:12.361 --> 00:36:15.420
<v Speaker 3>the base of the genome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except for these rare genetic disorders.</v>

630
00:36:15.421 --> 00:36:20.421
<v Speaker 3>So this company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their entire business model was </v>

631
00:36:20.421 --> 00:36:21.420
<v Speaker 3>predicting people's vulnerability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain diseases.</v>

632
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:23.520
<v Speaker 3>I think that was their main business </v>
<v Speaker 3>model.</v>

633
00:36:23.521 --> 00:36:28.521
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are certain things where </v>
<v Speaker 3>genome sequencing is still valuable and </v>

634
00:36:28.521 --> 00:36:28.521
<v Speaker 3>used,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

635
00:36:28.521 --> 00:36:31.380
<v Speaker 3>if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find out what your racial background is,</v>

636
00:36:31.381 --> 00:36:33.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where did your ancestors come from?</v>

637
00:36:33.151 --> 00:36:36.120
<v Speaker 3>It's really good for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it has very useful information.</v>

638
00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying this is useless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying it's,</v>

639
00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:44.090
<v Speaker 3>it has limited uses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nothing like the bonanza of profits </v>

640
00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:48.741
<v Speaker 3>that people were expecting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a report by the Harvard </v>

641
00:36:48.741 --> 00:36:52.260
<v Speaker 3>Business School on this a few years ago </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the biotech business and they said no</v>

642
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:57.270
<v Speaker 3>one had ever invented such a massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>money losing scheme in the history of </v>

643
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.420
<v Speaker 3>humanity.</v>

644
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:03.500
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's because it was based </v>
<v Speaker 3>on a false assumption of what genes do </v>

645
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.290
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating.</v>

646
00:37:04.291 --> 00:37:09.291
<v Speaker 3>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when when people hear about the </v>

647
00:37:09.291 --> 00:37:09.291
<v Speaker 3>experiment with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

648
00:37:09.291 --> 00:37:09.870
<v Speaker 3>the mice and the smell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the smell?</v>

649
00:37:09.871 --> 00:37:12.940
<v Speaker 3>Call again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The acetone,</v>

650
00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:18.380
<v Speaker 3>acetone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the conventional explanation for </v>

651
00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:18.380
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

652
00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.940
<v Speaker 3>this memory being passed down into these</v>
<v Speaker 3>animals that have never experienced that</v>

653
00:37:20.941 --> 00:37:22.090
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>

654
00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.550
<v Speaker 3>through breeding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

655
00:37:23.551 --> 00:37:25.520
<v Speaker 3>there isn't really one you see because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

656
00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:30.590
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something that Peter has rightly </v>

657
00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:33.220
<v Speaker 3>surprised about because the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could actually do that,</v>

658
00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:38.960
<v Speaker 3>you could give off the brain or of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nose or could actually give off </v>

659
00:37:39.181 --> 00:37:44.181
<v Speaker 3>influences that travel through the blood</v>
<v Speaker 3>and selectively modify sperm changing </v>

660
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:50.300
<v Speaker 3>genes or the packaging of jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing like that had been contemplated </v>

661
00:37:50.461 --> 00:37:55.461
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this suggests something going is </v>

662
00:37:55.461 --> 00:37:56.580
<v Speaker 3>going on that regular science doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know about.</v>

663
00:37:56.581 --> 00:37:58.500
<v Speaker 3>And that's fine from the point of view </v>
<v Speaker 3>of science.</v>

664
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:03.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you discover something new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you have to try and figure out how </v>

665
00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:03.570
<v Speaker 3>it works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one really knows.</v>

666
00:38:03.571 --> 00:38:07.890
<v Speaker 3>And this sort of pushes molecular </v>
<v Speaker 3>biology beyond its limits really.</v>

667
00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:13.200
<v Speaker 3>And people are working on this now and </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out how it could </v>

668
00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.190
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are the conventional theories is,</v>

669
00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:15.090
<v Speaker 3>are there any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

670
00:38:15.091 --> 00:38:20.091
<v Speaker 3>there aren't really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean no one knows how I'm smelling </v>

671
00:38:20.091 --> 00:38:23.721
<v Speaker 3>something could affect genes or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>packaging of jeans.</v>

672
00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:27.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even if they could even,</v>

673
00:38:27.541 --> 00:38:32.541
<v Speaker 3>if you could say there'd be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>modification of the sperm to make </v>

674
00:38:32.541 --> 00:38:32.940
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the offspring,</v>

675
00:38:32.941 --> 00:38:37.390
<v Speaker 3>the mice that descend from those sperm </v>
<v Speaker 3>more sensitive to Acetate for noon.</v>

676
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:40.390
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't necessarily explain why </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd be afraid of it.</v>

677
00:38:40.391 --> 00:38:42.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they trained me in a different way,</v>

678
00:38:42.521 --> 00:38:45.970
<v Speaker 3>acetone for known could have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could lick their lips and thought,</v>

679
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.110
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this means food.</v>

680
00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:53.160
<v Speaker 3>So you've got quite a lot of explaining </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do and how these genes or the </v>

681
00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:57.781
<v Speaker 3>packaging of them could influence the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain is way beyond anything we can </v>

682
00:38:57.781 --> 00:39:01.600
<v Speaker 3>understand at present.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think most people would say we just</v>

683
00:39:01.601 --> 00:39:03.040
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't figured it out yet.</v>

684
00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:06.340
<v Speaker 3>And this is a fairly recent experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two months ago,</v>

685
00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.480
<v Speaker 3>a few months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>realized it was published a few months </v>

686
00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.520
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long did they work on this for </v>

687
00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:14.520
<v Speaker 3>though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

688
00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.041
<v Speaker 3>I suppose they must have been working on</v>
<v Speaker 3>it for several years before they </v>

689
00:39:17.041 --> 00:39:17.200
<v Speaker 3>published it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

690
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:22.230
<v Speaker 3>what's exciting in biology at the moment</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the standard off the shelf </v>

691
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:25.180
<v Speaker 3>explanations that people used to have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all genetically programmed and that</v>

692
00:39:25.181 --> 00:39:30.181
<v Speaker 3>kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is falling apart until the year </v>

693
00:39:30.181 --> 00:39:34.111
<v Speaker 3>2000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a huge taboo in biology </v>

694
00:39:34.111 --> 00:39:34.870
<v Speaker 3>against the inheritance of acquired </v>
<v Speaker 3>characteristics,</v>

695
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:39.900
<v Speaker 3>which means say a father builds up his </v>
<v Speaker 3>muscles and become stronger and our </v>

696
00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:42.760
<v Speaker 3>learns particular skills.</v>

697
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.140
<v Speaker 3>The idea that the children could inherit</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was considered impossible.</v>

698
00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:50.560
<v Speaker 3>It they said no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all inheritances.</v>

699
00:39:50.561 --> 00:39:55.561
<v Speaker 3>Just genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course you get environmental </v>

700
00:39:55.561 --> 00:39:55.561
<v Speaker 3>influences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

701
00:39:55.561 --> 00:39:58.240
<v Speaker 3>if a dad takes his boys to weight </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifting classes and stuff,</v>

702
00:39:58.241 --> 00:40:00.100
<v Speaker 3>then obviously they'll become more </v>
<v Speaker 3>muscular.</v>

703
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:05.520
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that it could be anything </v>

704
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.391
<v Speaker 3>could be passed through the genes that </v>
<v Speaker 3>had been learned or acquired was </v>

705
00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:14.490
<v Speaker 3>absolutely to Bu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a heresy in 20th century biology </v>

706
00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:14.950
<v Speaker 3>in the West.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interestingly,</v>

707
00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.200
<v Speaker 3>in the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they went the other way,</v>

708
00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:22.180
<v Speaker 3>started in like the idea that if people </v>
<v Speaker 3>got better at things that our kids would</v>

709
00:40:22.181 --> 00:40:27.181
<v Speaker 3>be better at them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>automatically they'd inherited and </v>

710
00:40:27.181 --> 00:40:30.240
<v Speaker 3>geneticists in the Soviet Union were </v>
<v Speaker 3>persecuted and people who did research </v>

711
00:40:30.251 --> 00:40:32.290
<v Speaker 3>on the inheritance of acquired </v>
<v Speaker 3>characteristics.</v>

712
00:40:32.291 --> 00:40:36.400
<v Speaker 3>We're well funded and prestigious and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this polarized things even more.</v>

713
00:40:36.401 --> 00:40:39.850
<v Speaker 3>There was a kind of cold war in biology </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well as in everything else.</v>

714
00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:46.650
<v Speaker 3>But around the year 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it became clear that the really is an </v>

715
00:40:47.351 --> 00:40:52.351
<v Speaker 3>inheritance of acquired characteristics </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's been rebranded epigenetic </v>

716
00:40:52.351 --> 00:40:52.970
<v Speaker 3>inheritance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

717
00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.660
<v Speaker 3>and it's now a really hot topic in </v>
<v Speaker 3>biology.</v>

718
00:40:55.661 --> 00:40:59.470
<v Speaker 3>And these mice inheriting the fear of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their fathers experiments,</v>

719
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.770
<v Speaker 3>a part of this new wave of research on </v>
<v Speaker 3>epigenetics.</v>

720
00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:09.480
<v Speaker 3>And it turns out that a lot of things </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Soviet biologists were claiming are </v>

721
00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.360
<v Speaker 3>actually true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

722
00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:15.780
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I think ought to </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen is that somebody who knows </v>

723
00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:20.521
<v Speaker 3>Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>preferably someone who's in Russia goes </v>

724
00:41:20.521 --> 00:41:22.300
<v Speaker 3>back through these archives of Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 3>biology from the 19 twenties,</v>

725
00:41:22.301 --> 00:41:23.200
<v Speaker 3>thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forties,</v>

726
00:41:23.201 --> 00:41:28.201
<v Speaker 3>and fifties when tens of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>biologists and the Soviet Union were </v>

727
00:41:28.201 --> 00:41:31.600
<v Speaker 3>working on what we now call epigenetic </v>
<v Speaker 3>inheritance and,</v>

728
00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:35.330
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a mine of information that could be</v>

729
00:41:35.331 --> 00:41:38.630
<v Speaker 3>dusted off and could be really helpful </v>
<v Speaker 3>to science,</v>

730
00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:43.070
<v Speaker 3>but nobody's done that yet because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>usually assumed the whole of that's been</v>

731
00:41:43.071 --> 00:41:44.130
<v Speaker 3>discredited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

732
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:47.270
<v Speaker 3>and even Russians don't want to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

733
00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:49.460
<v Speaker 1>That's so fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so fascinating that,</v>

734
00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:53.830
<v Speaker 1>that scientists are just now piecing </v>
<v Speaker 1>together this new information.</v>

735
00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Just start putting it together and pure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's purely anecdotal evidence.</v>

736
00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:01.000
<v Speaker 1>I have young daughters and they wrestle </v>
<v Speaker 1>around together and you know,</v>

737
00:42:01.001 --> 00:42:06.001
<v Speaker 1>they play in the bed and laugh and joke </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've been doing Jujitsu since the 19</v>

738
00:42:06.701 --> 00:42:10.300
<v Speaker 1>nineties and my daughter's assumed </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu positions.</v>

739
00:42:10.301 --> 00:42:12.820
<v Speaker 1>I see them do it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've taught them now,</v>

740
00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:15.610
<v Speaker 1>but when they were little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like three and four years old,</v>

741
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:16.630
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

742
00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:21.660
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my youngest would do what's called an </v>

743
00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:24.361
<v Speaker 1>over under control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She would grab her back and grip like a </v>

744
00:42:24.361 --> 00:42:26.770
<v Speaker 1>certain way that you teach people to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then she would throw her legs over.</v>

745
00:42:26.771 --> 00:42:28.400
<v Speaker 1>It's called taking the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

746
00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:31.030
<v Speaker 1>it's a position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a standard position in Jujitsu,</v>

747
00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:33.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a normal position for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

748
00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:37.600
<v Speaker 1>but she would automatically go to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull my older daughter on top of her and</v>

749
00:42:37.601 --> 00:42:42.601
<v Speaker 1>take her back and it was the craziest </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to watch as a martial arts </v>

750
00:42:42.601 --> 00:42:43.180
<v Speaker 1>commentator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who understands,</v>

751
00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:44.980
<v Speaker 1>you know the correct way to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions.</v>

752
00:42:44.981 --> 00:42:46.090
<v Speaker 1>I would watch her do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

753
00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:51.210
<v Speaker 1>she knows what she's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she knows why she knows </v>

754
00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:54.451
<v Speaker 1>what she's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she assumed a position that I've </v>

755
00:42:54.451 --> 00:42:55.720
<v Speaker 1>done countless times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of times in my life.</v>

756
00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:57.310
<v Speaker 1>It automatically came to her and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

757
00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:01.300
<v Speaker 1>that has to be somehow or another in her</v>
<v Speaker 1>code.</v>

758
00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gone from my body.</v>

759
00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:06.710
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's a really,</v>

760
00:43:06.711 --> 00:43:10.520
<v Speaker 3>really interesting case and you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would call that morphic resonance that</v>

761
00:43:10.521 --> 00:43:13.090
<v Speaker 3>she's resonating with us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's got your jeans,</v>

762
00:43:13.091 --> 00:43:16.190
<v Speaker 3>he's caught your proteins and those of </v>
<v Speaker 3>her mother as well,</v>

763
00:43:16.191 --> 00:43:17.110
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

764
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:22.520
<v Speaker 3>but this similarity to you means she'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>be in a particular strong resonance with</v>

765
00:43:22.521 --> 00:43:24.770
<v Speaker 3>you and would pick up things that you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>acquired.</v>

766
00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.300
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's interesting you see in </v>
<v Speaker 3>many traditional societies,</v>

767
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:32.150
<v Speaker 3>children would follow in the footsteps </v>
<v Speaker 3>of their parents,</v>

768
00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:33.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blacksmiths,</v>

769
00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:36.320
<v Speaker 3>sons had become blacksmiths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in India,</v>

770
00:43:36.321 --> 00:43:37.460
<v Speaker 3>the caste system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

771
00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:42.520
<v Speaker 3>if someone's a potter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're kids that become potters and if </v>

772
00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:42.520
<v Speaker 3>they're a weaver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're kids that become weavers.</v>

773
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:48.190
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is partly because people </v>

774
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:51.230
<v Speaker 3>would have a special aptitude for doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>things their parents had done for skills</v>

775
00:43:51.231 --> 00:43:56.231
<v Speaker 3>their parents had acquired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not through the genes but by a kind of </v>

776
00:43:56.231 --> 00:43:59.741
<v Speaker 3>resonance obviously training and growing</v>
<v Speaker 3>up in a household where people know </v>

777
00:43:59.741 --> 00:44:04.691
<v Speaker 3>these things plays an important part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even before the regular training </v>

778
00:44:04.691 --> 00:44:09.011
<v Speaker 3>begins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd expect them to show these </v>

779
00:44:09.011 --> 00:44:09.080
<v Speaker 3>tendencies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's a particularly interesting</v>

780
00:44:09.081 --> 00:44:14.081
<v Speaker 3>example because you're able to observe </v>
<v Speaker 3>these positions most people wouldn't </v>

781
00:44:14.081 --> 00:44:14.540
<v Speaker 3>notice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

782
00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:18.530
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the kind of thing that I think is</v>

783
00:44:18.531 --> 00:44:20.780
<v Speaker 3>likely to be going on all the time.</v>

784
00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been several of those positions </v>

785
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.910
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

786
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:26.820
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's just play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I see them just rolling around,</v>

787
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000
<v Speaker 1>but then there's these clear patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of them is a knee to belly to </v>

788
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 1>the mount.</v>

789
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.880
<v Speaker 3>There's this position that you do when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in what's called side control.</v>

790
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:38.700
<v Speaker 3>You put your knee on someone's stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you slide it across,</v>

791
00:44:38.701 --> 00:44:43.701
<v Speaker 3>and you get on top of the mounting them </v>
<v Speaker 3>with your hips above their hips and she </v>

792
00:44:43.701 --> 00:44:43.701
<v Speaker 3>does it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It instinctively.</v>

793
00:44:43.701 --> 00:44:46.200
<v Speaker 3>And it's not an instinctive move for </v>
<v Speaker 3>most kids.</v>

794
00:44:46.201 --> 00:44:49.470
<v Speaker 3>And I try to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to be objective when I watch it.</v>

795
00:44:49.471 --> 00:44:54.471
<v Speaker 3>Like how much of this is just natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>human movement and how much of this is </v>

796
00:44:54.471 --> 00:44:58.341
<v Speaker 3>like her actually having some </v>
<v Speaker 3>information and there's clear blips </v>

797
00:44:58.341 --> 00:45:02.340
<v Speaker 3>where I go look at that data that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal like in Jujitsu class,</v>

798
00:45:02.341 --> 00:45:04.330
<v Speaker 3>but it's not normal for kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>

799
00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:09.440
<v Speaker 3>there are things that they've learned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's also like when I've </v>

800
00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.350
<v Speaker 3>taught them stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pick things up.</v>

801
00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:13.890
<v Speaker 3>Like they already knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I used to teach martial arts.</v>

802
00:45:13.891 --> 00:45:18.891
<v Speaker 3>So I've taught quite a few people and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know children are a little easier to </v>

803
00:45:18.891 --> 00:45:22.131
<v Speaker 3>teach than than other folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's children of people who are </v>

804
00:45:22.131 --> 00:45:26.061
<v Speaker 3>martial artists and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>children of people who have never </v>

805
00:45:26.061 --> 00:45:29.271
<v Speaker 3>studied martial arts and the children of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are martial artists were </v>

806
00:45:29.271 --> 00:45:29.910
<v Speaker 3>almost universally easier to teach.</v>

807
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:33.750
<v Speaker 3>And it sort of backs up that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

808
00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:36.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one could even do experiments on this,</v>

809
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:42.430
<v Speaker 3>actually quantify it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm my own approach to science is that </v>

810
00:45:43.291 --> 00:45:45.120
<v Speaker 3>you have to start from what people have </v>
<v Speaker 3>noticed,</v>

811
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:48.990
<v Speaker 3>like your observations with kids of </v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts people including your own.</v>

812
00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:54.650
<v Speaker 3>And then if you want to take it further,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could do more rigorous observations </v>

813
00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:55.890
<v Speaker 3>and just standard explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People say,</v>

814
00:45:55.891 --> 00:46:00.891
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well they've seen their parents do to </v>

815
00:46:00.891 --> 00:46:00.891
<v Speaker 3>alucien videos or pictures of it around </v>
<v Speaker 3>the house and that sort of thing.</v>

816
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.000
<v Speaker 3>That might play some part in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

817
00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:08.320
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's likely to be much more </v>

818
00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.080
<v Speaker 3>than that to this and when we'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously have to do special experiments</v>

819
00:46:10.081 --> 00:46:11.950
<v Speaker 3>too chunky out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

820
00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.750
<v Speaker 3>I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in many areas,</v>

821
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:21.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should be easier to teach kids whose </v>

822
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:22.320
<v Speaker 3>parents have done something like my own </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids.</v>

823
00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:26.380
<v Speaker 3>My two sons are extremely musical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant,</v>

824
00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:28.920
<v Speaker 3>new musical ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a professional musician.</v>

825
00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:32.050
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I play the piano.</v>

826
00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:36.960
<v Speaker 3>My grandfather was a church organist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My uncle was a church organist.</v>

827
00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:39.390
<v Speaker 3>My father was very musical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My mother was,</v>

828
00:46:39.391 --> 00:46:43.920
<v Speaker 3>played the piano and was very musical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wife's family were musical.</v>

829
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:47.730
<v Speaker 3>Her mother was a concert pianist who </v>
<v Speaker 3>found it was a pianist and a singer,</v>

830
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:53.300
<v Speaker 3>and right from the age of four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to play the piano.</v>

831
00:46:53.881 --> 00:46:57.810
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to learn music and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>shared a tremendous amount of ability to</v>

832
00:46:57.811 --> 00:47:02.811
<v Speaker 3>assimilate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are sometimes people who are very </v>

833
00:47:02.811 --> 00:47:02.811
<v Speaker 3>musical who come from non musical </v>
<v Speaker 3>families,</v>

834
00:47:02.811 --> 00:47:07.791
<v Speaker 3>but some of the greatest musical </v>
<v Speaker 3>geniuses come out of musical dentist is </v>

835
00:47:07.791 --> 00:47:08.290
<v Speaker 3>like buck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

836
00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:12.450
<v Speaker 3>he came from a dentistry of musicians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think that these,</v>

837
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:17.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things are probably easier to </v>

838
00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:18.510
<v Speaker 3>learn if parents have learned them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so fascinating.</v>

839
00:47:18.511 --> 00:47:23.511
<v Speaker 3>Just the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the concept of learning things and </v>

840
00:47:23.511 --> 00:47:26.301
<v Speaker 3>learning things from some really an </v>
<v Speaker 3>known source.</v>

841
00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that you brought up in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the trial logs</v>

842
00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:35.080
<v Speaker 1>I thought was particularly interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and really resonated with me was you </v>

843
00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:38.221
<v Speaker 1>were talking about how children in New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York City are afraid of monsters,</v>

844
00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:44.640
<v Speaker 1>that it's a natural inclination for </v>
<v Speaker 1>children to be afraid of things in the </v>

845
00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:46.570
<v Speaker 1>dark with large teeth that are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat you.</v>

846
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:51.750
<v Speaker 1>And that this goes back to the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we were regularly.</v>

847
00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Predators took babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like big cats are monsters as it </v>

848
00:47:58.751 --> 00:48:01.300
<v Speaker 1>were in the night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would steal people,</v>

849
00:48:01.301 --> 00:48:02.520
<v Speaker 1>would eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People prayed,</v>

850
00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:07.540
<v Speaker 1>preyed on human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it makes sense that these children </v>

851
00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:10.390
<v Speaker 1>have this intuitive instinct built into </v>
<v Speaker 1>their genetics or whatever it is.</v>

852
00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:11.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

853
00:48:11.331 --> 00:48:12.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

854
00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:13.990
<v Speaker 3>the standard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So to true,</v>

855
00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:17.310
<v Speaker 3>the human prehistoric past his man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hunter,</v>

856
00:48:17.311 --> 00:48:20.780
<v Speaker 3>striding out onto the savannas of Africa</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff.</v>

857
00:48:20.781 --> 00:48:21.770
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

858
00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.240
<v Speaker 3>it was much more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the case man,</v>

859
00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:25.550
<v Speaker 3>the hunted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

860
00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:30.580
<v Speaker 3>humans are particularly defenseless </v>
<v Speaker 3>against big predators and until recent </v>

861
00:48:31.671 --> 00:48:36.410
<v Speaker 3>times were very vulnerable to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Tigers in India,</v>

862
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:38.390
<v Speaker 3>during the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>under the British rule,</v>

863
00:48:38.391 --> 00:48:41.070
<v Speaker 3>even as late as 19 forties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

864
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:47.030
<v Speaker 3>there were thousands of people a year </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed by managing tigers and they </v>

865
00:48:47.631 --> 00:48:49.970
<v Speaker 3>usually go for the most vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

866
00:48:49.971 --> 00:48:54.971
<v Speaker 3>when predators are working in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when lions are attacking herds of </v>

867
00:48:54.971 --> 00:48:57.260
<v Speaker 3>antelope or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go for the old and the sick or they</v>

868
00:48:57.261 --> 00:49:00.290
<v Speaker 3>go for the young because they are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ones that are the most vulnerable.</v>

869
00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:04.070
<v Speaker 3>So probably over huge amounts of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

870
00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:09.550
<v Speaker 3>young children had indeed been eaten by </v>
<v Speaker 3>predators and um,</v>

871
00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:13.960
<v Speaker 3>and still wear.</v>

872
00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:18.970
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and probably today in some parts were </v>

873
00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:21.100
<v Speaker 3>maybe still are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These were the most realistic fears for </v>

874
00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:24.701
<v Speaker 3>huge periods of human history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think it's fascinating that I'm</v>

875
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:30.190
<v Speaker 3>young children have these nightmares.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The study in New York looked at the </v>

876
00:49:31.221 --> 00:49:36.221
<v Speaker 3>nightmares of young children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nearly all of them were about being </v>

877
00:49:36.221 --> 00:49:38.090
<v Speaker 3>chased by monsters or scary animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

878
00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:42.570
<v Speaker 3>and of course we feed this imagination </v>
<v Speaker 3>in children's through fairytales.</v>

879
00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:44.220
<v Speaker 3>Think of grimms fairy tales,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

880
00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:47.780
<v Speaker 3>like Little Red Riding Hood where </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the big bad wolf,</v>

881
00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:53.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is going to eat up little red </v>

882
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.270
<v Speaker 3>riding hood and the 70 stories in </v>
<v Speaker 3>fairytales.</v>

883
00:49:55.460 --> 00:50:00.460
<v Speaker 3>Have wolves that could eat children and </v>
<v Speaker 3>although nowadays the image of wolves </v>

884
00:50:01.701 --> 00:50:06.500
<v Speaker 3>has been sanitized and we're told that </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically a furry loving creatures,</v>

885
00:50:06.501 --> 00:50:11.501
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are predators and if they get the </v>

886
00:50:11.501 --> 00:50:13.120
<v Speaker 3>chance in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they did each children's in the</v>

887
00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.890
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the present,</v>

888
00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:19.920
<v Speaker 1>if they have the right numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know we've talked about this in the </v>

889
00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:20.290
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was an instance in the 14,</v>

890
00:50:20.291 --> 00:50:24.310
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and France were wolves killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>40 people in France.</v>

891
00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:27.320
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of them reaching the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right numbers.</v>

892
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:32.950
<v Speaker 1>World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an instance where the Germans </v>

893
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:36.461
<v Speaker 1>and the Russians had a ceasefire because</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many of their troops were getting </v>

894
00:50:36.461 --> 00:50:41.021
<v Speaker 1>killed by wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They united together take out a giant </v>

895
00:50:41.021 --> 00:50:42.200
<v Speaker 1>super pack of wolves in Russia because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

896
00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.960
<v Speaker 1>there was hundreds of wolves that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>just slaughtering soldiers.</v>

897
00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.340
<v Speaker 1>What was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're dangerous.</v>

898
00:50:46.341 --> 00:50:48.050
<v Speaker 1>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very tricky animals.</v>

899
00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:53.100
<v Speaker 1>Just we eradicated them to very low </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers and then when the numbers start </v>

900
00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:57.221
<v Speaker 1>to build up again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start getting more and more </v>

901
00:50:57.221 --> 00:50:57.221
<v Speaker 1>dangerous again.</v>

902
00:50:57.221 --> 00:50:59.500
<v Speaker 3>But I've seen this myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We spend a summers on a remote island in</v>

903
00:50:59.501 --> 00:51:01.810
<v Speaker 3>British Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cortez Island BC,</v>

904
00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:05.910
<v Speaker 3>and about 10 years ago the wolves came </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

905
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
<v Speaker 3>They swam from other islands and at </v>
<v Speaker 3>first most people are social liberal </v>

906
00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:14.290
<v Speaker 3>kind of people and so it was great </v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife returns,</v>

907
00:51:14.291 --> 00:51:15.710
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

908
00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:21.320
<v Speaker 3>but these rules became increasingly bold</v>
<v Speaker 3>and our family and some land up there.</v>

909
00:51:22.751 --> 00:51:24.310
<v Speaker 3>We have a forest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't have a house,</v>

910
00:51:24.311 --> 00:51:28.090
<v Speaker 3>we just have forest land and my sons </v>
<v Speaker 3>without on our land,</v>

911
00:51:28.091 --> 00:51:33.091
<v Speaker 3>they'd been sleeping out when a big wolf</v>
<v Speaker 3>suddenly appeared and looked very,</v>

912
00:51:33.281 --> 00:51:37.240
<v Speaker 3>very threatening and they'd been told,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't run if you see a wolf.</v>

913
00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:42.630
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they stood there and they faced it and </v>

914
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:43.210
<v Speaker 3>then it's will sort of puffed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fair in charged them and it stopped</v>

915
00:51:43.211 --> 00:51:47.130
<v Speaker 3>a few yards away and they backed off </v>
<v Speaker 3>slowly.</v>

916
00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:49.000
<v Speaker 3>They ran when they got around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>corner.</v>

917
00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.910
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this was clearly threatening,</v>

918
00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:53.380
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very scary.</v>

919
00:51:53.770 --> 00:51:56.410
<v Speaker 3>Then they started eating people's dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

920
00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:01.920
<v Speaker 3>and there's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen a faster transition </v>

921
00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:01.920
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

922
00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.940
<v Speaker 3>someone who is a kind of wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loving liberal,</v>

923
00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:05.310
<v Speaker 3>won't say dark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause heat,</v>

924
00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:10.340
<v Speaker 3>Heaton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted the guys with guns to come </v>

925
00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:11.200
<v Speaker 3>out and teach these wolves that lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

926
00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:16.260
<v Speaker 3>And they did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them were shot and know they're </v>

927
00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:16.660
<v Speaker 3>much more frightened of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They keep their distance.</v>

928
00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:18.190
<v Speaker 3>They're still there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

929
00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:19.360
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they,</v>

930
00:52:19.361 --> 00:52:22.480
<v Speaker 3>if there hadn't been a pushback from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people on the island,</v>

931
00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:24.640
<v Speaker 3>they would have got increasingly bold.</v>

932
00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an issue that's going on right </v>

933
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:31.461
<v Speaker 1>now where people are resisting the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>of hunting walls because they've </v>

934
00:52:31.461 --> 00:52:32.160
<v Speaker 1>reintroduced wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the western United States.</v>

935
00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:33.490
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

936
00:52:33.491 --> 00:52:36.330
<v Speaker 1>in some places they've reached very </v>
<v Speaker 1>large numbers,</v>

937
00:52:36.331 --> 00:52:41.331
<v Speaker 1>thousands of walls and Idaho and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of these areas where they've </v>

938
00:52:41.331 --> 00:52:44.151
<v Speaker 1>decimated elk and moose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moose populations or elk and deer </v>

939
00:52:44.151 --> 00:52:45.430
<v Speaker 1>populations rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

940
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:50.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that are animal </v>

941
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.510
<v Speaker 1>rights folks that aren't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not there.</v>

942
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:55.220
<v Speaker 1>And they resist it very strongly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea of killing wolves as </v>

943
00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:56.040
<v Speaker 1>barbaric and evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to the folks that lived there,</v>

944
00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:56.640
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

945
00:52:56.641 --> 00:52:59.310
<v Speaker 1>we love animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to deal with this.</v>

946
00:52:59.311 --> 00:53:03.030
<v Speaker 1>You've got a real problem here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when they formed large packs,</v>

947
00:53:03.031 --> 00:53:08.031
<v Speaker 1>they get very dangerous in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had these super packs of wolves in </v>

948
00:53:08.281 --> 00:53:13.281
<v Speaker 1>Siberia that we're taking out horses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were showing up 100 wolfs at a </v>

949
00:53:13.281 --> 00:53:14.370
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were showing up these horse stables</v>

950
00:53:14.371 --> 00:53:16.570
<v Speaker 1>and slaughtering a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

951
00:53:16.590 --> 00:53:18.720
<v Speaker 1>there's not much you can do about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred walls.</v>

952
00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:20.650
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

953
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:25.800
<v Speaker 3>given all this background,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's so fascinating for young </v>

954
00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:26.250
<v Speaker 3>children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially urban,</v>

955
00:53:26.251 --> 00:53:28.470
<v Speaker 3>young children who've actually never </v>
<v Speaker 3>seen.</v>

956
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.560
<v Speaker 3>They would never see a wolf your life or</v>
<v Speaker 3>any other scary animal.</v>

957
00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:34.470
<v Speaker 3>These are the things that hold their </v>
<v Speaker 3>nightmares.</v>

958
00:53:34.471 --> 00:53:36.900
<v Speaker 3>And I think this is part of a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>collective memory.</v>

959
00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:42.180
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the more realistic dangerous for </v>

960
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:42.180
<v Speaker 3>young children being run over by cars,</v>

961
00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.210
<v Speaker 1>a sexual Predator or sexual predators </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

962
00:53:45.211 --> 00:53:50.211
<v Speaker 1>But that's not what their dreams are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may be what their parents nightmares </v>

963
00:53:50.211 --> 00:53:51.090
<v Speaker 1>are about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not the children themselves.</v>

964
00:53:51.091 --> 00:53:56.091
<v Speaker 1>So there was a television show in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America that are hosted called fear </v>

965
00:53:56.091 --> 00:53:57.020
<v Speaker 1>factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a game show.</v>

966
00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:02.080
<v Speaker 1>They had to do these stunts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>different stents had different things </v>

967
00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:05.481
<v Speaker 1>they have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I found </v>

968
00:54:05.481 --> 00:54:07.220
<v Speaker 1>incredibly fascinating with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people have irrational fears about </v>

969
00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:08.880
<v Speaker 1>certain animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's spiders,</v>

970
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.520
<v Speaker 1>snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Arachnophobia phobia,</v>

971
00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:16.700
<v Speaker 1>and those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those fears were undeniable and they </v>

972
00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:17.010
<v Speaker 1>weren't just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are nervous of heights,</v>

973
00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:22.040
<v Speaker 1>like I'm nervous of heights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look over the side of a building or </v>

974
00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:22.040
<v Speaker 1>woo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not an irrational fear.</v>

975
00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:26.541
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a normal natural fear of I don't </v>

976
00:54:26.541 --> 00:54:27.180
<v Speaker 1>want to fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are some people you would show</v>

977
00:54:27.181 --> 00:54:28.770
<v Speaker 1>them a snake and they would.</v>

978
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:31.650
<v Speaker 1>They would black out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't stay conscious.</v>

979
00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:34.170
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would hyperventilate and they would</v>

980
00:54:34.171 --> 00:54:39.171
<v Speaker 1>faint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I couldn't believe they were normal </v>

981
00:54:39.171 --> 00:54:39.171
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I would talk to them,</v>

982
00:54:39.171 --> 00:54:44.150
<v Speaker 1>there would be nothing that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicate in any way that they were </v>

983
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:47.070
<v Speaker 1>psychologically deranged or there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>something missing in their,</v>

984
00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:52.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever developmental period that </v>

985
00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:55.510
<v Speaker 1>they'd gone through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something got screwed up and they're </v>

986
00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:55.980
<v Speaker 1>just missing a giant chunk of what makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person a normal person.</v>

987
00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:57.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem completely normal.</v>

988
00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:58.890
<v Speaker 1>But you show them a spider and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

989
00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:05.530
<v Speaker 1>and I always wondered like what is is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe some someone down the line in</v>

990
00:55:06.001 --> 00:55:11.001
<v Speaker 1>their history was bitten by a spider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone down the line was poisoned by a </v>

991
00:55:11.001 --> 00:55:12.870
<v Speaker 1>snake and survived or they saw someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>poisoned by a snake.</v>

992
00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:14.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

993
00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:19.400
<v Speaker 1>it's real and it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are real psychological issues that</v>

994
00:55:19.981 --> 00:55:23.200
<v Speaker 1>people have to deal with Arachnephobia </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a video phobia in,</v>

995
00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:24.690
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in particular,</v>

996
00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:25.680
<v Speaker 1>they're very strong.</v>

997
00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:27.400
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

998
00:55:27.401 --> 00:55:32.401
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think these could easily be inherited </v>

999
00:55:32.401 --> 00:55:34.951
<v Speaker 3>fairview's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's well known in animals that </v>

1000
00:55:34.951 --> 00:55:36.340
<v Speaker 3>you can have instinctive fear and of </v>
<v Speaker 3>course it makes sense for animals.</v>

1001
00:55:36.850 --> 00:55:40.660
<v Speaker 3>You probably know those experiments they</v>
<v Speaker 3>do with day old chicks or with ducklings</v>

1002
00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:45.990
<v Speaker 3>and you have the mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an enclosure doors and then they do </v>

1003
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:48.460
<v Speaker 3>these experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have cardboard cutouts and with the</v>

1004
00:55:48.461 --> 00:55:53.461
<v Speaker 3>silhouettes of birds and you pull them </v>
<v Speaker 3>across on wires and if you pull across </v>

1005
00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:56.740
<v Speaker 3>things with the silhouette of a hawk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

1006
00:55:57.130 --> 00:55:59.650
<v Speaker 3>these ducklings just freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1007
00:55:59.651 --> 00:56:03.730
<v Speaker 3>the fear response is to just freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They freeze it.</v>

1008
00:56:03.731 --> 00:56:08.731
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if you pull across something </v>
<v Speaker 3>looks like silhouette of a pigeon or a </v>

1009
00:56:08.731 --> 00:56:10.090
<v Speaker 3>red wing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black work bad or something,</v>

1010
00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:11.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>

1011
00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:16.420
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they have an inherited fear of things</v>

1012
00:56:16.421 --> 00:56:21.421
<v Speaker 3>that could in fact be dangerous and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly in terms of evolution.</v>

1013
00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:24.400
<v Speaker 3>Makes perfect sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See why that would work.</v>

1014
00:56:24.401 --> 00:56:29.401
<v Speaker 3>These baby ducklings don't have time to </v>
<v Speaker 3>learn which birds are harmful and which </v>

1015
00:56:29.401 --> 00:56:34.171
<v Speaker 3>are not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But an instinctive response of fear to </v>

1016
00:56:34.171 --> 00:56:37.201
<v Speaker 3>something that is actually scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It may sometimes lead them to respond </v>

1017
00:56:37.201 --> 00:56:38.770
<v Speaker 3>something that isn't like a cardboard </v>
<v Speaker 3>cutout,</v>

1018
00:56:38.830 --> 00:56:39.880
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1019
00:56:40.350 --> 00:56:42.520
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think these things make complete sense</v>

1020
00:56:42.521 --> 00:56:43.270
<v Speaker 3>biologically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Logically.</v>

1021
00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does make sense if you stop and think</v>

1022
00:56:45.311 --> 00:56:50.311
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really take into consideration </v>

1023
00:56:50.311 --> 00:56:53.620
<v Speaker 1>all the things you have to learn to </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive as any animal,</v>

1024
00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:58.790
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just this idea that these mice would </v>

1025
00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:02.520
<v Speaker 1>learn somehow or another through their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their parents to avoid that,</v>

1026
00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:07.550
<v Speaker 1>that certain smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that smell was associated with </v>

1027
00:57:07.550 --> 00:57:09.901
<v Speaker 1>electrical shock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It only makes sense that somehow or </v>

1028
00:57:09.901 --> 00:57:12.160
<v Speaker 1>another biological life would transmit </v>
<v Speaker 1>information in as many ways as possible.</v>

1029
00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Your idea is so fascinating because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not even talking about biological</v>

1030
00:57:18.011 --> 00:57:20.530
<v Speaker 1>life transferring information through </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetics.</v>

1031
00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:25.800
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about it through some </v>
<v Speaker 1>unseen force that has yet to be defined </v>

1032
00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:29.410
<v Speaker 1>and that's when things get really </v>
<v Speaker 1>squirrely and is that when you.</v>

1033
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:34.450
<v Speaker 1>That's must be when you experience the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most resistance to these ideas because </v>

1034
00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:39.860
<v Speaker 1>the resistance of these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure before they proposed this idea </v>

1035
00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:43.801
<v Speaker 1>that genetics or that these mice with </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another to inherit the fear </v>

1036
00:57:43.801 --> 00:57:48.721
<v Speaker 1>of this smell from their parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was probably not very well received</v>

1037
00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:54.540
<v Speaker 1>before it was proven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it was proven so now it's sort </v>

1038
00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:55.810
<v Speaker 1>of has to be accepted and has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken into consideration,</v>

1039
00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:59.770
<v Speaker 1>but your idea is still very fringe.</v>

1040
00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:01.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

1041
00:58:01.290 --> 00:58:04.920
<v Speaker 3>It's the interesting thing is you see </v>
<v Speaker 3>the response.</v>

1042
00:58:04.921 --> 00:58:09.921
<v Speaker 3>I get this from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from some scientists who is actually </v>

1043
00:58:09.921 --> 00:58:13.200
<v Speaker 3>extremely emotional and irrational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When my first book,</v>

1044
00:58:13.201 --> 00:58:18.201
<v Speaker 3>a new science of life came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a very famous editorial in </v>

1045
00:58:18.201 --> 00:58:22.401
<v Speaker 3>nature of the leading science magazine a</v>
<v Speaker 3>few months after the book appeared to </v>

1046
00:58:23.071 --> 00:58:25.530
<v Speaker 3>start with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nature ignored it,</v>

1047
00:58:25.830 --> 00:58:30.830
<v Speaker 3>but then a lot of people got interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was doing programs on the radio in </v>

1048
00:58:30.830 --> 00:58:34.611
<v Speaker 3>Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was an article editorial in the </v>

1049
00:58:34.611 --> 00:58:35.580
<v Speaker 3>Guardian saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's an interesting idea?</v>

1050
00:58:35.581 --> 00:58:37.890
<v Speaker 3>And so a lot of serious discussion going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1051
00:58:37.891 --> 00:58:42.891
<v Speaker 3>New Scientist magazine launched a </v>
<v Speaker 3>competition for the best ideas for </v>

1052
00:58:42.891 --> 00:58:44.700
<v Speaker 3>experiments to test morphic resonance </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1053
00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:50.210
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was beginning to be widely </v>

1054
00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:50.210
<v Speaker 3>discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the editor of nature,</v>

1055
00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:53.220
<v Speaker 3>who was a reaction refigure in silence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1056
00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:56.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>old style materialist mechanistic,</v>

1057
00:58:56.710 --> 00:59:01.710
<v Speaker 3>a hardcore scientist wrote a famous </v>
<v Speaker 3>editorial called a book for burning on </v>

1058
00:59:03.211 --> 00:59:08.211
<v Speaker 3>the front page of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm comparing my book unfavorably with </v>

1059
00:59:08.211 --> 00:59:12.441
<v Speaker 3>Mine Kampf Hitler's book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that this was a profoundly </v>

1060
00:59:12.441 --> 00:59:16.101
<v Speaker 3>dangerous book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said this is the best candidate </v>

1061
00:59:16.101 --> 00:59:17.250
<v Speaker 3>for burning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There has been for many years and it was</v>

1062
00:59:17.251 --> 00:59:21.740
<v Speaker 3>completely irrational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This attack on my book it emotional,</v>

1063
00:59:21.741 --> 00:59:23.090
<v Speaker 3>irrational polemical.</v>

1064
00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:27.380
<v Speaker 3>He didn't do it as a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1065
00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:32.920
<v Speaker 3>and this of course produced a backlash </v>
<v Speaker 3>because quite a few scientists thought </v>

1066
00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:36.020
<v Speaker 3>this was the wrong way to respond to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific hypothesis.</v>

1067
00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:39.260
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so a lot of letters in nature for months</v>

1068
00:59:39.261 --> 00:59:42.050
<v Speaker 3>afterwards were backing me up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

1069
00:59:42.051 --> 00:59:47.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is something that should be </v>

1070
00:59:47.051 --> 00:59:47.051
<v Speaker 3>seriously discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not simply denounced.</v>

1071
00:59:47.051 --> 00:59:50.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fact is that this started a kind</v>

1072
00:59:50.271 --> 00:59:53.360
<v Speaker 3>of controversy which has been going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever since.</v>

1073
00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:57.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but until the year 2000,</v>

1074
00:59:57.950 --> 01:00:00.200
<v Speaker 3>most biologists thought genes did </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1075
01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:06.210
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the epigenetic thing has taken over </v>

1076
01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:10.331
<v Speaker 3>in the missing heritability problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's much more openness than the was </v>

1077
01:00:10.331 --> 01:00:12.320
<v Speaker 3>because it's clear we haven't figured it</v>
<v Speaker 3>all out.</v>

1078
01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:16.100
<v Speaker 3>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charles Darwin,</v>

1079
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:21.510
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was not a neo Darwinian Neo Darwinian </v>

1080
01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:24.500
<v Speaker 3>evolution theory says it's all done by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the genes.</v>

1081
01:00:24.501 --> 01:00:29.501
<v Speaker 3>Evolution is just about random mutation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and natural selection of gene </v>

1082
01:00:29.501 --> 01:00:29.501
<v Speaker 3>frequencies.</v>

1083
01:00:29.501 --> 01:00:31.450
<v Speaker 3>This is the basis of Richard Dawkins </v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

1084
01:00:31.451 --> 01:00:32.720
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his book,</v>

1085
01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:35.510
<v Speaker 3>the selfish gene,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is based on that model.</v>

1086
01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.560
<v Speaker 3>Darwin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually believed in the inheritance</v>

1087
01:00:39.561 --> 01:00:44.561
<v Speaker 3>of acquired characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thought that animals could inherit </v>

1088
01:00:44.561 --> 01:00:48.520
<v Speaker 3>the fears of their fathers and that most</v>
<v Speaker 3>of adaptation could actually be passed </v>

1089
01:00:49.821 --> 01:00:53.600
<v Speaker 3>on to animals and plants to send it from</v>
<v Speaker 3>parents.</v>

1090
01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.150
<v Speaker 3>He thought that was how evolution </v>
<v Speaker 3>worked.</v>

1091
01:00:56.270 --> 01:01:01.270
<v Speaker 3>He even proposed that when something had</v>
<v Speaker 3>been learned that could be movement at </v>

1092
01:01:01.611 --> 01:01:04.940
<v Speaker 3>something through the bloodstream that </v>
<v Speaker 3>could affect the sperm and the eggs,</v>

1093
01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:10.570
<v Speaker 3>exactly the kinds of things that's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>being considered in this fear of the </v>

1094
01:01:10.570 --> 01:01:13.580
<v Speaker 3>father's case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so movement through the bloodstream.</v>

1095
01:01:13.581 --> 01:01:16.220
<v Speaker 3>So if you learn something like say if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you touch something,</v>

1096
01:01:16.221 --> 01:01:20.690
<v Speaker 3>it's electric fence and it shocks you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's movement through the bloodstream</v>

1097
01:01:20.691 --> 01:01:24.590
<v Speaker 3>that teaches your sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was what Darwin thought we put.</v>

1098
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:29.750
<v Speaker 3>He wrote a book called the variation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals and plants under domestication </v>

1099
01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:31.940
<v Speaker 3>is less well known than his most famous </v>
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>

1100
01:01:31.941 --> 01:01:33.290
<v Speaker 3>the origin of species.</v>

1101
01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:38.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the variation of animals and </v>

1102
01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:42.611
<v Speaker 3>plants under domestication,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was so convinced that plants and </v>

1103
01:01:42.611 --> 01:01:44.330
<v Speaker 3>animals could inherit what their parents</v>
<v Speaker 3>had learned.</v>

1104
01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:49.660
<v Speaker 3>He tried to figure out how it might work</v>
<v Speaker 3>and his last chapter is called the </v>

1105
01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:53.741
<v Speaker 3>hypothesis of pathogenesis is the name </v>
<v Speaker 3>he gave to his theory that somehow </v>

1106
01:01:53.741 --> 01:01:58.601
<v Speaker 3>little bits were detached from the brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>and went through the blood and affected </v>

1107
01:01:58.601 --> 01:01:58.670
<v Speaker 3>the sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1108
01:01:58.910 --> 01:02:00.800
<v Speaker 3>that's more or less what people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

1109
01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:04.160
<v Speaker 3>trying to explain the mice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inheriting the fear of their fathers.</v>

1110
01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:09.590
<v Speaker 3>That aspect of Darwin's work has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>airbrushed out of scientific history,</v>

1111
01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:13.210
<v Speaker 3>and Darwin also wrote a paper in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1112
01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:17.210
<v Speaker 3>about a dog that he came across that </v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever this dog,</v>

1113
01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:22.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten there to a butcher's shop that </v>

1114
01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:25.260
<v Speaker 3>the dog was completely terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Butchers and Darwin figured out that </v>

1115
01:02:25.471 --> 01:02:30.471
<v Speaker 3>it's parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of his parents had been kicked or </v>

1116
01:02:30.471 --> 01:02:33.501
<v Speaker 3>badly mistreated by a butcher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this dog had inherited a phobia of </v>

1117
01:02:33.501 --> 01:02:33.501
<v Speaker 3>butchers.</v>

1118
01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:38.840
<v Speaker 3>Now Darwin published that in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shows you how very different </v>

1119
01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:42.720
<v Speaker 3>Darwin's ideas on evolution were from </v>
<v Speaker 3>his 20th century successors.</v>

1120
01:02:42.721 --> 01:02:47.721
<v Speaker 3>And the reason that modern evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>theory is called near Darwinism is to </v>

1121
01:02:47.941 --> 01:02:52.941
<v Speaker 3>distinguish it from Darwinism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which included the inheritance of </v>

1122
01:02:52.941 --> 01:02:55.320
<v Speaker 3>habits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm very similar to what I'm saying.</v>

1123
01:02:55.530 --> 01:03:00.530
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>inheritance of habits through morphic </v>

1124
01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:02.010
<v Speaker 3>resonance is actually really close to </v>
<v Speaker 3>what Darwin himself said.</v>

1125
01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:07.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not what neo Darwinians say </v>

1126
01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:09.510
<v Speaker 3>because they've tried to say all </v>
<v Speaker 3>inheritances in jeans and you can't have</v>

1127
01:03:09.511 --> 01:03:11.160
<v Speaker 3>these other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>

1128
01:03:11.161 --> 01:03:15.120
<v Speaker 3>they'll have to change their tune.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because as I say in the last few years,</v>

1129
01:03:15.330 --> 01:03:20.330
<v Speaker 3>epigenetic inheritance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the inheritance of acquired </v>

1130
01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:20.330
<v Speaker 3>characteristics is back in fashion.</v>

1131
01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's many people that haven't studied</v>

1132
01:03:22.570 --> 01:03:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Darwin's ideas at all that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar with the amount of resistance </v>

1133
01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>that Darwin received when he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposing these ideas,</v>

1134
01:03:29.651 --> 01:03:31.780
<v Speaker 1>like these weren't accepted ideas at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1135
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:37.030
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the majority of scientists at the time </v>

1136
01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:37.030
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1137
01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:38.650
<v Speaker 1>they were more of a Christian faith </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't thing.</v>

1138
01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:40.510
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

1139
01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:42.850
<v Speaker 3>the response to Darwin was particularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

1140
01:03:42.851 --> 01:03:44.410
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because many,</v>

1141
01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:49.350
<v Speaker 3>many Christians in England,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1142
01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:54.900
<v Speaker 3>after being surprised by his ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually said,</v>

1143
01:03:55.391 --> 01:03:59.260
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine if God's the creator of life</v>

1144
01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:00.370
<v Speaker 3>and why not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't God,</v>

1145
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:05.120
<v Speaker 3>we're a from evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>create life that can evolve by Andrea.</v>

1146
01:04:05.121 --> 01:04:10.121
<v Speaker 3>It's own steam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And his ideas were quite rapidly </v>

1147
01:04:10.121 --> 01:04:13.651
<v Speaker 3>accepted by the Roman Catholic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Anglican Episcopal churches and the </v>

1148
01:04:13.651 --> 01:04:14.890
<v Speaker 3>methodist and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1149
01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:20.260
<v Speaker 3>this fundamentalist creationist thing is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a peculiar American phenomenon.</v>

1150
01:04:20.261 --> 01:04:25.261
<v Speaker 3>It didn't originate until the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 3>century and it was started in America </v>

1151
01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:27.370
<v Speaker 3>and it's virtually unknown in Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1152
01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:32.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually a practicing Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an Anglican and I never meet </v>

1153
01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:36.781
<v Speaker 3>creationists in England.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard anyone with what </v>

1154
01:04:36.781 --> 01:04:38.860
<v Speaker 3>exactly is an Anglican Church of </v>
<v Speaker 3>England.</v>

1155
01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:44.220
<v Speaker 3>The Church of England is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of halfway between Protestant </v>

1156
01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:48.481
<v Speaker 3>and Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened in England under King </v>

1157
01:04:48.481 --> 01:04:52.081
<v Speaker 3>Henry the eighth and the 16th century </v>
<v Speaker 3>was that he nationalized the church and </v>

1158
01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:53.680
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1159
01:04:53.681 --> 01:04:55.570
<v Speaker 3>the pope's not head of the church </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

1160
01:04:55.570 --> 01:05:00.570
<v Speaker 3>I am and I'm the priest can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mary will have services in English and </v>

1161
01:05:01.691 --> 01:05:03.880
<v Speaker 3>bishops can be married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1162
01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:07.030
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the services remain much the same.</v>

1163
01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:10.650
<v Speaker 3>And the Church of England,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go to Anglican services,</v>

1164
01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:14.950
<v Speaker 3>very like a Roman Catholic service,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except that we have married priests,</v>

1165
01:05:14.951 --> 01:05:17.800
<v Speaker 3>we have women bishops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>

1166
01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:18.580
<v Speaker 3>women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>priests,</v>

1167
01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:23.640
<v Speaker 3>outrageous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>outrageous from a Catholic point of </v>

1168
01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:23.640
<v Speaker 3>view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1169
01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:23.960
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1170
01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:26.530
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Church of England is so,</v>

1171
01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:27.640
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1172
01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:32.820
<v Speaker 3>it's never had the sort of extreme </v>
<v Speaker 3>protestant doctrines like southern </v>

1173
01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:33.820
<v Speaker 3>baptists and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1174
01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:34.780
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1175
01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.150
<v Speaker 3>it's very similar to the Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 3>church.</v>

1176
01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:39.550
<v Speaker 3>It's now one of the most liberal </v>
<v Speaker 3>churches.</v>

1177
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Anglicans on the whole had no </v>

1178
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:45.000
<v Speaker 3>problem with evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They still don't.</v>

1179
01:05:46.330 --> 01:05:51.330
<v Speaker 3>I've just been doing a workshop last </v>
<v Speaker 3>weekend at the Allen Institute in big </v>

1180
01:05:51.671 --> 01:05:56.671
<v Speaker 3>Sur,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I was co leading with the Bishop </v>

1181
01:05:56.671 --> 01:06:00.420
<v Speaker 3>of California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's Cathedral is Grace Cathedral in </v>

1182
01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:00.940
<v Speaker 3>San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very beautiful cathedral on Nob Hill.</v>

1183
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:05.050
<v Speaker 3>We were discussing the kinds of things </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I are discussing.</v>

1184
01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:10.230
<v Speaker 3>He was completely open to all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was absolutely no problem </v>

1185
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:14.140
<v Speaker 3>discussing this with an Anglican </v>
<v Speaker 3>Episcopalian bishop.</v>

1186
01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:19.990
<v Speaker 3>It's a very far cry from what many </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's image of Christians as opposing</v>

1187
01:06:19.991 --> 01:06:24.991
<v Speaker 3>evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the general view that many Christians </v>

1188
01:06:24.991 --> 01:06:24.991
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An I'm one,</v>

1189
01:06:24.991 --> 01:06:28.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the evolution of nature of,</v>

1190
01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:33.151
<v Speaker 3>if there's a creative part in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it may be God given in the first place,</v>

1191
01:06:33.161 --> 01:06:35.410
<v Speaker 3>but what God did was to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1192
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:40.470
<v Speaker 3>in nature with a part create new forms </v>
<v Speaker 3>of life that there's a kind of </v>

1193
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:44.131
<v Speaker 3>intelligent creativity in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to have a kind of </v>

1194
01:06:44.131 --> 01:06:48.900
<v Speaker 3>intelligent designing engineer outside </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature tinkering with the machinery and </v>

1195
01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:52.510
<v Speaker 3>manipulating genes as the intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 3>design people think.</v>

1196
01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:55.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1197
01:06:55.120 --> 01:07:00.040
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to deny evolution all </v>
<v Speaker 3>together to say God's involved in nature</v>

1198
01:07:00.041 --> 01:07:00.730
<v Speaker 3>in some way.</v>

1199
01:07:01.090 --> 01:07:06.090
<v Speaker 3>It's perfectly possible to have a view </v>
<v Speaker 3>where God is in nature and work through </v>

1200
01:07:06.090 --> 01:07:07.360
<v Speaker 3>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a creativity in nature which</v>

1201
01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:12.100
<v Speaker 3>doesn't require the universe to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been created in 6,000,</v>

1202
01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:13.540
<v Speaker 3>6,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

1203
01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:18.570
<v Speaker 3>that completely accept the evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>history of the universe and cosmology </v>

1204
01:07:19.331 --> 01:07:21.160
<v Speaker 3>and an evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1205
01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:22.600
<v Speaker 3>and just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1206
01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:28.320
<v Speaker 3>if there's a god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's the way that God works </v>

1207
01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.410
<v Speaker 3>through this evolutionary process and </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the creativity of evolution.</v>

1208
01:07:29.830 --> 01:07:30.460
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1209
01:07:30.461 --> 01:07:33.710
<v Speaker 3>the fundamentalist Christians and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>new Earth Christians at that,</v>

1210
01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:35.760
<v Speaker 3>that's a uniquely American thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1211
01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:37.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do have followers,</v>

1212
01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:42.420
<v Speaker 3>a few followers in Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but day they take their lead entirely </v>

1213
01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:45.900
<v Speaker 3>from America and they've got a new batch</v>
<v Speaker 3>of converts their point of view in the </v>

1214
01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:49.921
<v Speaker 3>Islamic world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Creationism inspired by American </v>

1215
01:07:49.921 --> 01:07:53.170
<v Speaker 3>creationist is big in Turkey in many </v>
<v Speaker 3>other Arab countries and stuff.</v>

1216
01:07:53.530 --> 01:07:58.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a peculiarly American </v>

1217
01:07:58.530 --> 01:07:58.530
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon.</v>

1218
01:07:58.530 --> 01:07:58.630
<v Speaker 3>We know how it all came about in </v>
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>

1219
01:07:58.631 --> 01:07:59.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where,</v>

1220
01:07:59.161 --> 01:08:00.680
<v Speaker 3>where it really took off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1221
01:08:00.730 --> 01:08:02.110
<v Speaker 3>it became a part of the political </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

1222
01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:07.120
<v Speaker 3>The Reagan administration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they started recruiting the radical </v>

1223
01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:10.270
<v Speaker 3>Christians and that became a part of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>electoral base.</v>

1224
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:12.340
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very,</v>

1225
01:08:12.341 --> 01:08:14.470
<v Speaker 3>very interesting history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had always been,</v>

1226
01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:19.500
<v Speaker 3>for most foreigners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>American politics is completely </v>

1227
01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:20.810
<v Speaker 3>impossible to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible to understand how people</v>

1228
01:08:20.811 --> 01:08:24.650
<v Speaker 3>can be so polarized and so extreme in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their views.</v>

1229
01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:28.880
<v Speaker 3>And I read a book recently which made it</v>
<v Speaker 3>much clearer to me.</v>

1230
01:08:28.881 --> 01:08:33.881
<v Speaker 3>It's called the sword of the Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's written by a guy called Andrew </v>

1231
01:08:33.881 --> 01:08:38.171
<v Speaker 3>himes who was raised southern baptist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seven of his cousins are southern </v>

1232
01:08:38.171 --> 01:08:39.020
<v Speaker 3>Baptist ministers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His father,</v>

1233
01:08:39.021 --> 01:08:41.630
<v Speaker 3>his grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his grandfather who was called rice,</v>

1234
01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:47.020
<v Speaker 3>was one of the inventors of American </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalism and it's a fascinating </v>

1235
01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:50.450
<v Speaker 3>historical study of this phenomenon and </v>
<v Speaker 3>why they were like that.</v>

1236
01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:53.720
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it made a lot more sense to me.</v>

1237
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:59.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still a very bizarre and very </v>

1238
01:08:59.080 --> 01:08:59.080
<v Speaker 3>American.</v>

1239
01:08:59.080 --> 01:08:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1240
01:08:59.080 --> 01:08:59.880
<v Speaker 1>we're very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were hard to understand.</v>

1241
01:08:59.881 --> 01:09:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Even for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1242
01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:06.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's constantly trying to refocus </v>

1243
01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:07.980
<v Speaker 1>our political system or sort of re </v>
<v Speaker 1>redefine it,</v>

1244
01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:09.560
<v Speaker 1>calm it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reach more.</v>

1245
01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's looking for a more moderate </v>

1246
01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.110
<v Speaker 1>conservative or someone who is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative,</v>

1247
01:09:16.111 --> 01:09:16.750
<v Speaker 1>moderate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1248
01:09:16.770 --> 01:09:19.470
<v Speaker 1>we're always looking for someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>meets the bridge,</v>

1249
01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:24.500
<v Speaker 1>someone to join the two sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we don't have these radical </v>

1250
01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:27.150
<v Speaker 1>polarizing op opposing forces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left and the right,</v>

1251
01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:28.950
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems so childish.</v>

1252
01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:32.240
<v Speaker 3>But what this book made and what was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

1253
01:09:32.270 --> 01:09:37.040
<v Speaker 3>a huge revelation was that how all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is rooted in the American civil war</v>

1254
01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:39.440
<v Speaker 3>and there's a sense in which in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's minds,</v>

1255
01:09:39.441 --> 01:09:44.441
<v Speaker 3>the civil war's still going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that the sides of switched in </v>

1256
01:09:44.441 --> 01:09:44.990
<v Speaker 3>the civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the south was Democrat,</v>

1257
01:09:45.150 --> 01:09:50.150
<v Speaker 3>you're the slave owning silence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have political party after the </v>

1258
01:09:50.150 --> 01:09:51.890
<v Speaker 3>civil war was the Democrats and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Republicans,</v>

1259
01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:54.140
<v Speaker 3>the liberals who wanted to free the </v>
<v Speaker 3>slaves.</v>

1260
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:57.900
<v Speaker 3>And one of the most interesting switches</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's happened is,</v>

1261
01:09:57.901 --> 01:10:00.920
<v Speaker 3>is this switch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now it's gone the other way around.</v>

1262
01:10:00.921 --> 01:10:03.110
<v Speaker 3>The Democrats and other liberals and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1263
01:10:03.111 --> 01:10:05.960
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Republicans have become the more</v>

1264
01:10:05.961 --> 01:10:10.580
<v Speaker 3>right wing forces and powerful in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>south,</v>

1265
01:10:10.581 --> 01:10:12.980
<v Speaker 3>which was exactly the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very bizarre.</v>

1266
01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:17.300
<v Speaker 3>So what this book does is trace the </v>
<v Speaker 3>history of this fascinating movement.</v>

1267
01:10:17.301 --> 01:10:19.730
<v Speaker 3>But what's so interesting is it in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>civil war,</v>

1268
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:25.460
<v Speaker 3>both sides were using biblical texts to </v>
<v Speaker 3>justify their position.</v>

1269
01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:27.020
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1270
01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:32.040
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the southern Baptists and the religious </v>

1271
01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:35.291
<v Speaker 3>people in the south actually had a much </v>
<v Speaker 3>stronger biblical basis for slavery </v>

1272
01:10:35.291 --> 01:10:38.450
<v Speaker 3>because the Bible's full of slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Old Testament's full of slaves,</v>

1273
01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:43.010
<v Speaker 3>the Israelites were slaves themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They owned slaves in the New Testament.</v>

1274
01:10:43.011 --> 01:10:45.080
<v Speaker 3>Everyone owned slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was taken for granted.</v>

1275
01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.540
<v Speaker 3>There were no abolitionists in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bible.</v>

1276
01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:52.670
<v Speaker 3>So if you base your faith on the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can make a much stronger case for,</v>

1277
01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:55.940
<v Speaker 3>for slavery than you can for </v>
<v Speaker 3>abolitionism and so,</v>

1278
01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.450
<v Speaker 3>but you have to take the Bible is </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally true.</v>

1279
01:10:59.830 --> 01:11:04.830
<v Speaker 3>And that gave a strong incentive for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in the south to make the Bible </v>

1280
01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:08.261
<v Speaker 3>literally true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you could justify slavery much </v>

1281
01:11:08.261 --> 01:11:08.500
<v Speaker 3>better than if you interpret it in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal way saying,</v>

1282
01:11:08.501 --> 01:11:12.590
<v Speaker 3>well actually the spirit of Jesus was to</v>
<v Speaker 3>liberate people from bondage.</v>

1283
01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:13.260
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1284
01:11:13.261 --> 01:11:14.280
<v Speaker 3>as well as the text.</v>

1285
01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:17.160
<v Speaker 3>Jesus doesn't say anything about </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberating slaves.</v>

1286
01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:23.110
<v Speaker 3>So fundamentalism gave a kind of impetus</v>
<v Speaker 3>to this and,</v>

1287
01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.930
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was very,</v>

1288
01:11:24.931 --> 01:11:29.931
<v Speaker 3>very fascinating to see how that played </v>
<v Speaker 3>out because on both sides in the civil </v>

1289
01:11:29.931 --> 01:11:34.371
<v Speaker 3>war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were both invoking the Bible that </v>

1290
01:11:34.371 --> 01:11:34.371
<v Speaker 3>both sides were Protestant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both sites were,</v>

1291
01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:38.190
<v Speaker 3>had ministers preaching to inspire the </v>
<v Speaker 3>troops and get them to fight.</v>

1292
01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:41.280
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the civil war,</v>

1293
01:11:42.210 --> 01:11:46.740
<v Speaker 3>the way in which this tradition of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalism that had developed in the</v>

1294
01:11:46.741 --> 01:11:51.741
<v Speaker 3>American south justify slavery and gave </v>
<v Speaker 3>a kind of ready made way to use biblical</v>

1295
01:11:52.771 --> 01:11:57.771
<v Speaker 3>texts to argue against all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>other things including evolutionary </v>

1296
01:11:57.771 --> 01:12:00.120
<v Speaker 3>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas in Europe,</v>

1297
01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:02.300
<v Speaker 3>in the traditional Catholic and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1298
01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:07.340
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in the more liberal Protestant </v>

1299
01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:07.340
<v Speaker 3>churches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people hadn't taken the view.</v>

1300
01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:11.670
<v Speaker 3>The Bible is the literal truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They taken the view that the Bible is a </v>

1301
01:12:11.670 --> 01:12:11.670
<v Speaker 3>guide to what might happen.</v>

1302
01:12:11.670 --> 01:12:13.920
<v Speaker 3>That a lot of its meaning is allegorical</v>
<v Speaker 3>or symbolic,</v>

1303
01:12:13.921 --> 01:12:18.300
<v Speaker 3>but the kinds of so called liberal </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpretation of the Bible goes back to</v>

1304
01:12:18.810 --> 01:12:21.300
<v Speaker 3>the second century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A D or something.</v>

1305
01:12:21.301 --> 01:12:21.800
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1306
01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:24.540
<v Speaker 3>it's been the mainstream view for a long</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1307
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:27.840
<v Speaker 3>Your scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1308
01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:31.680
<v Speaker 3>what leads you to be a practicing </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian as a scientist?</v>

1309
01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.860
<v Speaker 3>But I spent years as an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1310
01:12:34.861 --> 01:12:38.310
<v Speaker 3>when I was educated as a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the package deal is acs.</v>

1311
01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:43.820
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up with all the standard time is </v>

1312
01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:45.450
<v Speaker 3>14.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at a religious boarding school,</v>

1313
01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:50.900
<v Speaker 3>a Christian boarding school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was the only boy in my year who </v>

1314
01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:52.710
<v Speaker 3>refused to get confirmed because even at</v>
<v Speaker 3>14 identified as an atheist.</v>

1315
01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:58.180
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I thought science means science and </v>

1316
01:12:58.951 --> 01:13:01.730
<v Speaker 3>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion and superstition of things that</v>

1317
01:13:01.731 --> 01:13:05.580
<v Speaker 3>the past two scientists at the vanguard </v>
<v Speaker 3>of human progress,</v>

1318
01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:06.660
<v Speaker 3>all that kind of thing.</v>

1319
01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:11.660
<v Speaker 3>I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what made me begin to doubt it was I</v>

1320
01:13:11.971 --> 01:13:15.000
<v Speaker 3>began to doubt that this was the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>way forward in science.</v>

1321
01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I began to think that this mechanistic </v>

1322
01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:23.070
<v Speaker 3>molecular approach to treating animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>and plants as just machines,</v>

1323
01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:26.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was an inadequate view of life.</v>

1324
01:13:26.071 --> 01:13:29.910
<v Speaker 3>I'd gone into biology because I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinated by animals and plants.</v>

1325
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.390
<v Speaker 3>I kept lots of pets as a child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My father was a herbalist.</v>

1326
01:13:33.391 --> 01:13:36.330
<v Speaker 3>I collected plants and he taught me </v>
<v Speaker 3>about plants.</v>

1327
01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:41.510
<v Speaker 3>He had a microscope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>love oratory and cyber source of really </v>

1328
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:43.040
<v Speaker 3>got into science as a child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1329
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:48.950
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I started studying science at </v>

1330
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:52.730
<v Speaker 3>school and university,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing we did with living </v>

1331
01:13:52.730 --> 01:13:55.611
<v Speaker 3>organisms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>organisms was to kill them and grind </v>

1332
01:13:55.611 --> 01:13:56.340
<v Speaker 3>them up and then look at the enzymes in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the liver or whatever.</v>

1333
01:13:56.730 --> 01:13:58.260
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it became clear to me,</v>

1334
01:13:58.261 --> 01:13:59.790
<v Speaker 3>we've not really studying life.</v>

1335
01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:01.920
<v Speaker 3>We were studying death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1336
01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:07.170
<v Speaker 3>and when I was a child I kept homing </v>
<v Speaker 3>pigeons and I was fascinated with how do</v>

1337
01:14:07.171 --> 01:14:09.420
<v Speaker 3>they find their home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked everybody I knew,</v>

1338
01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:11.410
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who kept homing pigeons.</v>

1339
01:14:11.411 --> 01:14:13.810
<v Speaker 3>It was a popular sport in Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It still is.</v>

1340
01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:18.070
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had some myself and I used to put them</v>

1341
01:14:18.071 --> 01:14:23.071
<v Speaker 3>in a box and cyclist fun as I could on </v>
<v Speaker 3>my bicycle and released them and then </v>

1342
01:14:23.071 --> 01:14:26.240
<v Speaker 3>cycle home and they always got home </v>
<v Speaker 3>before I did a.</v>

1343
01:14:26.290 --> 01:14:31.290
<v Speaker 3>However far I took them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this completely intrigued me and I </v>

1344
01:14:31.331 --> 01:14:36.331
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're never going to understand this by </v>

1345
01:14:36.331 --> 01:14:36.331
<v Speaker 3>just grinding up their livers or looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>at their genes.</v>

1346
01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:40.250
<v Speaker 3>So I began to doubt the mechanistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>world view.</v>

1347
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:42.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

1348
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:48.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I encountered psychedelics and that was </v>

1349
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.051
<v Speaker 3>a huge change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean nothing in my scientific </v>

1350
01:14:52.051 --> 01:14:55.321
<v Speaker 3>education and prepared me for the kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of mind opening effects of LSD and this </v>

1351
01:14:55.721 --> 01:14:57.700
<v Speaker 3>was in the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early seventies.</v>

1352
01:14:58.210 --> 01:15:01.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

1353
01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:06.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd studied nerve impulses and hormones </v>

1354
01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.050
<v Speaker 3>and that kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what we got in a science course</v>

1355
01:15:08.051 --> 01:15:11.180
<v Speaker 3>at Cambridge about the brain and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1356
01:15:11.181 --> 01:15:13.750
<v Speaker 3>I knew about the international youth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the brain and nerve impulses,</v>

1357
01:15:13.751 --> 01:15:18.751
<v Speaker 3>but these visionary experiences that </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics opened up showed me there </v>

1358
01:15:18.751 --> 01:15:22.600
<v Speaker 3>was far more to the mind and indeed far </v>
<v Speaker 3>more to reality than there's very,</v>

1359
01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:27.601
<v Speaker 3>very limited model.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I got interested in meditation </v>

1360
01:15:27.601 --> 01:15:27.601
<v Speaker 3>because I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1361
01:15:27.601 --> 01:15:30.310
<v Speaker 3>it'd be good to be able to explore the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind without drugs.</v>

1362
01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:35.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not anti psychedelic tour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it'd be good to have different </v>

1363
01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:35.710
<v Speaker 3>methods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just drugs.</v>

1364
01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:41.440
<v Speaker 3>And then I took up transcendental </v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation and Yoga and then I got a job</v>

1365
01:15:44.621 --> 01:15:49.621
<v Speaker 3>in India.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lived in India for seven years and </v>

1366
01:15:49.621 --> 01:15:50.990
<v Speaker 3>when I was in India I was really into </v>
<v Speaker 3>yoga and meditation.</v>

1367
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.770
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and at first I thought,</v>

1368
01:15:53.771 --> 01:15:56.140
<v Speaker 3>this is just changing my brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>physiology,</v>

1369
01:15:56.141 --> 01:16:01.141
<v Speaker 3>you don't need to believe there's a god </v>
<v Speaker 3>out there or any thing mysterious out </v>

1370
01:16:01.141 --> 01:16:01.810
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just inside the body,</v>

1371
01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:07.140
<v Speaker 3>the chemicals of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the yoga and meditation affect blood </v>

1372
01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:07.140
<v Speaker 3>flow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

1373
01:16:07.450 --> 01:16:12.450
<v Speaker 3>So I saw it in rather materialistic way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I got more and more interest in</v>

1374
01:16:13.631 --> 01:16:15.850
<v Speaker 3>Hindu philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Hindu ideas,</v>

1375
01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:20.890
<v Speaker 3>the idea that there's a greater </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness within which our </v>

1376
01:16:20.890 --> 01:16:22.000
<v Speaker 3>consciousness is embedded through </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1377
01:16:22.001 --> 01:16:24.290
<v Speaker 3>through some psychedelic experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We Ca,</v>

1378
01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:29.410
<v Speaker 3>we contact other realms of consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 3>that aren't just inside our brains </v>

1379
01:16:29.410 --> 01:16:33.930
<v Speaker 3>through meditation and through prayer </v>
<v Speaker 3>that one can actually contact other </v>

1380
01:16:33.930 --> 01:16:35.730
<v Speaker 3>forms of consciousness bigger than our </v>
<v Speaker 3>own.</v>

1381
01:16:36.670 --> 01:16:39.040
<v Speaker 3>I did all that within a kind of Hindu </v>
<v Speaker 3>context.</v>

1382
01:16:39.041 --> 01:16:41.710
<v Speaker 3>And then I had a Sufi teacher in India </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well,</v>

1383
01:16:41.770 --> 01:16:44.710
<v Speaker 3>so I did sort of Islamic mysticism for </v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile.</v>

1384
01:16:45.790 --> 01:16:50.790
<v Speaker 3>But after doing this for several years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found that actually some of it didn't </v>

1385
01:16:51.371 --> 01:16:53.110
<v Speaker 3>make sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The part that doesn't,</v>

1386
01:16:53.210 --> 01:16:55.060
<v Speaker 3>didn't make sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1387
01:16:55.090 --> 01:17:00.090
<v Speaker 3>the Islamic part to be a Sufi in India,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically you had to be a Muslim and I </v>

1388
01:17:00.401 --> 01:17:05.401
<v Speaker 3>didn't really want to get into being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslim and sort of fasting in Ramadan </v>

1389
01:17:05.651 --> 01:17:10.651
<v Speaker 3>and all that to be and Hindus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're basic worldview walls and for </v>

1390
01:17:13.641 --> 01:17:18.641
<v Speaker 3>most of them still is the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just trapped in a world where </v>

1391
01:17:19.221 --> 01:17:23.600
<v Speaker 3>things go on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rebirth and cycles of life and death and</v>

1392
01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:29.620
<v Speaker 3>we're trapped in this world of suffering</v>
<v Speaker 3>and delusion and the way out is through </v>

1393
01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:34.421
<v Speaker 3>a kind of spiritual vertical takeoff </v>
<v Speaker 3>which you do individually through </v>

1394
01:17:34.421 --> 01:17:38.920
<v Speaker 3>meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can liberate yourself from </v>

1395
01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:41.141
<v Speaker 3>reincarnation and delusion and so forth </v>
<v Speaker 3>into absorption in the one and the </v>

1396
01:17:41.141 --> 01:17:44.090
<v Speaker 3>absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's an individual vertical takeoff.</v>

1397
01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:47.480
<v Speaker 3>And I was working in an agricultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>institute,</v>

1398
01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:52.570
<v Speaker 3>the main International Institute in </v>
<v Speaker 3>India for trying to improve crops for </v>

1399
01:17:53.181 --> 01:17:57.290
<v Speaker 3>poor farmers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes my Indian colleagues would</v>

1400
01:17:57.291 --> 01:17:59.650
<v Speaker 3>say to me after work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we always say,</v>

1401
01:17:59.651 --> 01:18:01.040
<v Speaker 3>why do you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'd say,</v>

1402
01:18:01.041 --> 01:18:04.390
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to help these poor people and you</v>

1403
01:18:04.391 --> 01:18:06.120
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they haven't got enough to eat it.</v>

1404
01:18:06.150 --> 01:18:08.480
<v Speaker 3>Be Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they had better farming methods.</v>

1405
01:18:08.481 --> 01:18:11.660
<v Speaker 3>And improve for artists and science can </v>
<v Speaker 3>help,</v>

1406
01:18:11.661 --> 01:18:14.670
<v Speaker 3>and I believe in trying to apply my </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge to help these people.</v>

1407
01:18:14.671 --> 01:18:16.850
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is none of your business.</v>

1408
01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:17.930
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are poor.</v>

1409
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:19.910
<v Speaker 3>If they are suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is that cardamom.</v>

1410
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:22.190
<v Speaker 3>It is not your business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is their problem,</v>

1411
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:27.310
<v Speaker 3>not your problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your problem is to liberate yourself </v>

1412
01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:31.001
<v Speaker 3>from this world of illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then I realized actually they have a </v>

1413
01:18:31.001 --> 01:18:35.771
<v Speaker 3>completely different view that it's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>poor suffering because in a sense they </v>

1414
01:18:35.781 --> 01:18:39.170
<v Speaker 3>deserve to suffer because of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've done in past lives.</v>

1415
01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:43.310
<v Speaker 3>Nothing I can do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I realized actually I do care about</v>

1416
01:18:43.311 --> 01:18:48.311
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think that a spiritual life is not </v>

1417
01:18:48.311 --> 01:18:50.870
<v Speaker 3>just about individual liberation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's to do with collective things,</v>

1418
01:18:50.871 --> 01:18:54.920
<v Speaker 3>is to do it affects community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how can other people be helped?</v>

1419
01:18:56.090 --> 01:19:01.090
<v Speaker 3>Unless I argued with my Hindu friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized the reason I was saying this </v>

1420
01:19:01.090 --> 01:19:02.630
<v Speaker 3>is because I'm so deeply embedded in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian tradition.</v>

1421
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:08.050
<v Speaker 3>Even secular humanism is a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>secularized Christianity because it's </v>

1422
01:19:08.050 --> 01:19:09.310
<v Speaker 3>about helping others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1423
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:10.910
<v Speaker 3>that actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1424
01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:14.210
<v Speaker 3>I was much more Christian than I </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually had ever admitted.</v>

1425
01:19:14.211 --> 01:19:19.211
<v Speaker 3>So I was confirmed in the Church of </v>
<v Speaker 3>south India and I then found a fantastic</v>

1426
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:23.480
<v Speaker 3>ashram where I lived for two years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>father bede griffiths,</v>

1427
01:19:23.481 --> 01:19:26.930
<v Speaker 3>who is an English Benedictine now to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian Ashram in south India,</v>

1428
01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:31.670
<v Speaker 3>which was exactly to my taste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very simple.</v>

1429
01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:34.040
<v Speaker 3>We did yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did meditation.</v>

1430
01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:36.050
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1431
01:19:36.051 --> 01:19:41.051
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had Christian services and we sang </v>

1432
01:19:41.051 --> 01:19:44.651
<v Speaker 3>Indian chants and curtains and things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't try and deny any of this.</v>

1433
01:19:45.710 --> 01:19:50.710
<v Speaker 3>And when I first went there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we started the mass with the gaietry </v>

1434
01:19:50.710 --> 01:19:51.470
<v Speaker 3>mantra,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a Hindu mantra,</v>

1435
01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:56.800
<v Speaker 3>asking the sun to bless our meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the divine splendor of the sun to </v>

1436
01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:01.331
<v Speaker 3>illuminate our meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I said to father bede when I first </v>

1437
01:20:01.331 --> 01:20:05.561
<v Speaker 3>went there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now how can you have the gaietry mantra </v>

1438
01:20:05.561 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 3>at the beginning of a Catholic service?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

1439
01:20:08.011 --> 01:20:11.850
<v Speaker 3>precisely because it's Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said Catholic means universal.</v>

1440
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.600
<v Speaker 3>If it excludes anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a path to God,</v>

1441
01:20:15.630 --> 01:20:19.980
<v Speaker 3>then it's just sectarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The word Catholic means universal.</v>

1442
01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:21.280
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he's fascinating.</v>

1443
01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:22.860
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1444
01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:24.450
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1445
01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:29.570
<v Speaker 3>so I found a way of being Christian </v>
<v Speaker 3>which didn't Deny Yoga,</v>

1446
01:20:31.531 --> 01:20:33.180
<v Speaker 3>meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Buddhism,</v>

1447
01:20:33.181 --> 01:20:36.270
<v Speaker 3>my wife has a practicing Tibetan </v>
<v Speaker 3>Buddhist,</v>

1448
01:20:36.271 --> 01:20:39.930
<v Speaker 3>she follows us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll Chen tradition in Tibetan Buddhism.</v>

1449
01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:46.880
<v Speaker 3>So I found a way of reconnecting with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Christian tradition which didn't </v>

1450
01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:51.741
<v Speaker 3>violate my sense of reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't conflict with the kind of </v>

1451
01:20:51.741 --> 01:20:54.720
<v Speaker 3>science that I'm interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I found it liberating to reconnect.</v>

1452
01:20:54.721 --> 01:20:57.240
<v Speaker 3>And so when I went back to England from </v>
<v Speaker 3>India,</v>

1453
01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:02.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was able to go to those great </v>

1454
01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:05.930
<v Speaker 3>cathedrals that we have in England.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Belt in the middle ages is fantastic </v>

1455
01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:06.690
<v Speaker 3>buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stained glass,</v>

1456
01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:09.720
<v Speaker 3>wonderful music organs playing amazing </v>
<v Speaker 3>choirs,</v>

1457
01:21:09.721 --> 01:21:14.670
<v Speaker 3>singing the most beautiful music and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and feel that this is not just beautiful</v>

1458
01:21:14.671 --> 01:21:19.671
<v Speaker 3>but meaningful and as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a path to God which had not seen </v>

1459
01:21:19.671 --> 01:21:19.671
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

1460
01:21:19.671 --> 01:21:23.200
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in India,</v>

1461
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:28.350
<v Speaker 1>the concept of Karma being that someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>has done something in their past life </v>

1462
01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:29.500
<v Speaker 1>that's led them to where they are right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

1463
01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:34.880
<v Speaker 1>that boy that seems real convenient for </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone passing by homeless people or </v>

1464
01:21:37.061 --> 01:21:42.061
<v Speaker 1>someone who's poor or suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like the numbers of people </v>

1465
01:21:42.971 --> 01:21:45.610
<v Speaker 1>that they have in India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the numbers are so great,</v>

1466
01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:50.680
<v Speaker 1>a billion people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much bigger is India than in North </v>

1467
01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:50.680
<v Speaker 1>America?</v>

1468
01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:51.620
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the size of the land.</v>

1469
01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:56.050
<v Speaker 3>As much smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The population is almost a billion.</v>

1470
01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:57.880
<v Speaker 3>How much smaller is the size of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>land?</v>

1471
01:21:57.910 --> 01:22:00.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's crazy.</v>

1472
01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:07.200
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that came about as just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of mitigating the pressure of </v>

1473
01:22:08.171 --> 01:22:10.900
<v Speaker 1>helping people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just the idea of Karma.</v>

1474
01:22:11.170 --> 01:22:13.090
<v Speaker 1>You can't help that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his problem.</v>

1475
01:22:13.091 --> 01:22:15.850
<v Speaker 1>You gotta do it yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the sheer numbers.</v>

1476
01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:21.040
<v Speaker 3>Like what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean at the time the British were </v>

1477
01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:23.681
<v Speaker 3>ruling India.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are only about 200 million and </v>

1478
01:22:23.681 --> 01:22:25.320
<v Speaker 3>when I was born the robot to 50 million </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were born.</v>

1479
01:22:25.570 --> 01:22:29.060
<v Speaker 3>I was born in 1942.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did a lot of huge,</v>

1480
01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:33.590
<v Speaker 3>huge increase increase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1481
01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:36.650
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is about the convenience.</v>

1482
01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:39.680
<v Speaker 3>The Karma thing in India uses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is convenient.</v>

1483
01:22:39.681 --> 01:22:42.680
<v Speaker 3>For for centuries India's had a caste </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

1484
01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:48.420
<v Speaker 3>The untouchables are treated like dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're considered to be </v>

1485
01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:52.211
<v Speaker 3>polluting and dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if the shadow of an untouchable </v>

1486
01:22:52.211 --> 01:22:56.051
<v Speaker 3>fell on the brahmins house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this person could be punished very </v>

1487
01:22:56.051 --> 01:22:59.831
<v Speaker 3>various severity and there was no move </v>
<v Speaker 3>within India until the 19th century to </v>

1488
01:23:01.731 --> 01:23:06.731
<v Speaker 3>reform that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened with Christian </v>

1489
01:23:06.731 --> 01:23:08.531
<v Speaker 3>missionaries went there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were nice to untouchables and to </v>

1490
01:23:08.531 --> 01:23:10.150
<v Speaker 3>lower costs and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it gave them food,</v>

1491
01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:11.740
<v Speaker 3>education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthcare,</v>

1492
01:23:11.741 --> 01:23:13.690
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some of them became Christians.</v>

1493
01:23:14.290 --> 01:23:15.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why not?</v>

1494
01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:20.490
<v Speaker 3>If you're at the bottom of the pile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've not got anything to lose and </v>

1495
01:23:20.490 --> 01:23:20.950
<v Speaker 3>you've got a lot to gain by becoming a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian.</v>

1496
01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:26.460
<v Speaker 3>So Hindu reformers felt that they had </v>
<v Speaker 3>contractors and so things like the </v>

1497
01:23:26.831 --> 01:23:31.831
<v Speaker 3>Ramakrishna mission and Sri Aurobindo </v>
<v Speaker 3>and various Hindu philosophers and Gandy</v>

1498
01:23:32.321 --> 01:23:33.670
<v Speaker 3>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1499
01:23:33.671 --> 01:23:38.671
<v Speaker 3>who was a big influence in India,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assimilated many of these ideas from </v>

1500
01:23:38.671 --> 01:23:38.671
<v Speaker 3>Christianity and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1501
01:23:38.671 --> 01:23:43.621
<v Speaker 3>we've got to reform hinduism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they created a new kind of Hindu </v>

1502
01:23:43.621 --> 01:23:45.430
<v Speaker 3>attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much influenced by Christianity.</v>

1503
01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:50.640
<v Speaker 3>And so there are no Indian movements to </v>
<v Speaker 3>try and help the poor and no provide </v>

1504
01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:52.150
<v Speaker 3>health care for the sick and that kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of thing.</v>

1505
01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:56.140
<v Speaker 3>But that's not been part of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditional way of doing things.</v>

1506
01:23:56.141 --> 01:23:58.150
<v Speaker 3>And it came about under Western </v>
<v Speaker 3>influence.</v>

1507
01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:03.400
<v Speaker 1>That's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your desire to sort of help help </v>

1508
01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:07.661
<v Speaker 1>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>help them grow more food and help help </v>

1509
01:24:07.661 --> 01:24:09.950
<v Speaker 1>them live better lives is what led you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to become a Christian.</v>

1510
01:24:09.951 --> 01:24:12.260
<v Speaker 1>You realize that these are Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas?</v>

1511
01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:14.310
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That they are Christian.</v>

1512
01:24:14.311 --> 01:24:17.900
<v Speaker 3>They're deeply embedded in our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even for secular humanists,</v>

1513
01:24:17.901 --> 01:24:22.901
<v Speaker 3>you see St Louis humanness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so usually atheists who believe in a </v>

1514
01:24:23.401 --> 01:24:28.401
<v Speaker 3>philosophy of equal rights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>equal opportunities in helping the poor </v>

1515
01:24:28.401 --> 01:24:30.910
<v Speaker 3>and the sick education for those who </v>
<v Speaker 3>need know for,</v>

1516
01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:32.080
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for everyone.</v>

1517
01:24:32.081 --> 01:24:34.860
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uplifting people who are suffering,</v>

1518
01:24:34.861 --> 01:24:39.861
<v Speaker 3>helping third world countries have </v>
<v Speaker 3>running water and all that kind of </v>

1519
01:24:39.861 --> 01:24:39.861
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1520
01:24:39.861 --> 01:24:41.580
<v Speaker 3>these are the things that Christian </v>
<v Speaker 3>missionaries have done as well,</v>

1521
01:24:41.581 --> 01:24:44.310
<v Speaker 3>but you don't have to be a Christian to </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe in those things,</v>

1522
01:24:44.311 --> 01:24:47.190
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that they are so deeply </v>
<v Speaker 3>embedded in our culture,</v>

1523
01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:50.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our secular culture is because of the</v>

1524
01:24:50.941 --> 01:24:53.490
<v Speaker 3>influence historically influence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Christianity.</v>

1525
01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:57.570
<v Speaker 3>So secular humanists are basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who still have Christian ethics,</v>

1526
01:24:57.990 --> 01:25:02.990
<v Speaker 3>but without a belief in God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that ethical system doesn't just </v>

1527
01:25:03.811 --> 01:25:08.310
<v Speaker 3>come about automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A much more default mode is to say,</v>

1528
01:25:08.311 --> 01:25:09.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the strong miters,</v>

1529
01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:10.440
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1530
01:25:10.590 --> 01:25:13.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the strongest guy gets the girls and,</v>

1531
01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:18.080
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>runs a kind of theme and then conquer </v>

1532
01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:20.640
<v Speaker 3>people and have slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how humanities worked for much of</v>

1533
01:25:20.641 --> 01:25:21.480
<v Speaker 3>human history.</v>

1534
01:25:21.610 --> 01:25:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1535
01:25:22.410 --> 01:25:23.230
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most certainly has.</v>

1536
01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:28.470
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like you found a very cool </v>

1537
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:30.130
<v Speaker 1>sect of Christianity while you were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>India.</v>

1538
01:25:30.131 --> 01:25:35.131
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds very unique that you were </v>

1539
01:25:35.131 --> 01:25:37.831
<v Speaker 1>doing yoga and meditation and then these</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indian chants all along with this </v>

1540
01:25:39.521 --> 01:25:44.521
<v Speaker 1>concept of Christianity being like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the generosity and the helping your </v>

1541
01:25:45.041 --> 01:25:48.830
<v Speaker 1>brothers and sisters along with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be like that.</v>

1542
01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:52.870
<v Speaker 1>That must have been very convenient to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find that sect of Christianity while you</v>

1543
01:25:52.871 --> 01:25:54.910
<v Speaker 1>were sort of exploring these ideas.</v>

1544
01:25:55.080 --> 01:26:00.080
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't even the sect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Griffis was a benedictine monk and he </v>

1545
01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:03.521
<v Speaker 3>was a Roman Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's true that some people in the </v>

1546
01:26:03.521 --> 01:26:04.820
<v Speaker 3>Catholic Church didn't approve of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was doing,</v>

1547
01:26:04.821 --> 01:26:06.180
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1548
01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:07.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was really just him.</v>

1549
01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:10.040
<v Speaker 3>It was well here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amanda Group of other people.</v>

1550
01:26:10.041 --> 01:26:11.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a whole movement in,</v>

1551
01:26:11.770 --> 01:26:15.980
<v Speaker 3>in India of Catholics too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was called inculturation.</v>

1552
01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:20.030
<v Speaker 3>It was the second Vatican council in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>19 sixties,</v>

1553
01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:25.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said that what people should do in the </v>

1554
01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:27.470
<v Speaker 3>Catholic church is put the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 3>faith into the terms of that culture.</v>

1555
01:26:27.471 --> 01:26:32.471
<v Speaker 3>So in India,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Catholics who have been converted by </v>

1556
01:26:32.471 --> 01:26:33.710
<v Speaker 3>Catholic missionaries from Ireland and </v>
<v Speaker 3>places,</v>

1557
01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:36.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bought pairs of shoes so he can put them</v>

1558
01:26:36.981 --> 01:26:41.981
<v Speaker 3>on to go to church on Sundays because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mission is dressed in western </v>

1559
01:26:41.981 --> 01:26:44.570
<v Speaker 3>clothes and wore shoes in church.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These Indians would never wear shoes and</v>

1560
01:26:44.571 --> 01:26:46.730
<v Speaker 3>a temple or a mosque or even in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>house,</v>

1561
01:26:46.970 --> 01:26:51.970
<v Speaker 3>but they will choose in church because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what the Catholic missionaries </v>

1562
01:26:51.970 --> 01:26:53.270
<v Speaker 3>wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing is ridiculous.</v>

1563
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:57.020
<v Speaker 3>And so the simplest level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the incarceration movement,</v>

1564
01:26:57.021 --> 01:26:57.560
<v Speaker 3>we say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1565
01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:03.040
<v Speaker 3>it's the tradition of injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take your shoes off in homes and in </v>

1566
01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:03.040
<v Speaker 3>temples,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in marks.</v>

1567
01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:07.130
<v Speaker 3>So you take them off in churches tune.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was the tradition of Holy Men and</v>

1568
01:27:08.151 --> 01:27:12.890
<v Speaker 3>women in Nto to be vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas Catholics and Protestants,</v>

1569
01:27:12.891 --> 01:27:17.891
<v Speaker 3>they're all eating lots of beef and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff because that's what American and </v>

1570
01:27:17.891 --> 01:27:18.300
<v Speaker 3>British missionaries at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1571
01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:19.550
<v Speaker 3>and so they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1572
01:27:19.551 --> 01:27:22.820
<v Speaker 3>it's much more natural to be vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to be,</v>

1573
01:27:22.821 --> 01:27:27.821
<v Speaker 3>but it's more natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this idea of yoga is a way of </v>

1574
01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:31.280
<v Speaker 3>learning how to breathe and to challenge</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to be more healthy.</v>

1575
01:27:31.670 --> 01:27:34.490
<v Speaker 3>Why shouldn't Indian Christians do yoga?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1576
01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:39.580
<v Speaker 3>So this is part of a movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Father Bede was part of a wider </v>

1577
01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:42.521
<v Speaker 3>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last two popes had been rather </v>

1578
01:27:42.521 --> 01:27:43.010
<v Speaker 3>reactionary and you've tried to roll </v>
<v Speaker 3>back that movement,</v>

1579
01:27:43.011 --> 01:27:48.011
<v Speaker 3>but there are still people in India,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in South America and so on who are </v>

1580
01:27:48.011 --> 01:27:50.930
<v Speaker 3>following this Vatican second Vatican </v>
<v Speaker 3>Council reform movement,</v>

1581
01:27:51.170 --> 01:27:52.610
<v Speaker 3>or the new pope is fairly unique.</v>

1582
01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:57.610
<v Speaker 3>His name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he seems to be a or a much less </v>

1583
01:27:57.610 --> 01:28:00.800
<v Speaker 3>polarizing figure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He seems to be much more generous,</v>

1584
01:28:00.801 --> 01:28:05.801
<v Speaker 3>much more open minded to the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>homosexuality to a lot of the things </v>

1585
01:28:05.801 --> 01:28:10.801
<v Speaker 3>that have been criticized in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he also like he's showing the ideas </v>

1586
01:28:10.881 --> 01:28:15.881
<v Speaker 3>of monetary wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have that crazy thrown </v>

1587
01:28:15.881 --> 01:28:15.890
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a reasonable chair.</v>

1588
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:17.810
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a unique guy.</v>

1589
01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:20.870
<v Speaker 3>I think it's partly because he comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>from South America,</v>

1590
01:28:20.871 --> 01:28:24.020
<v Speaker 3>you see and do this kind of radical </v>
<v Speaker 3>Catholic movement.</v>

1591
01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:27.590
<v Speaker 3>The Second Vatican Council Liberation </v>
<v Speaker 3>Theology,</v>

1592
01:28:27.591 --> 01:28:32.591
<v Speaker 3>which was about the church should be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not serve the rich but to help </v>

1593
01:28:32.591 --> 01:28:34.490
<v Speaker 3>the poor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this became a huge movement in South</v>

1594
01:28:34.490 --> 01:28:35.140
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1595
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:37.230
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1596
01:28:37.570 --> 01:28:40.610
<v Speaker 3>the previous Pope John Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the second was against it because he,</v>

1597
01:28:40.710 --> 01:28:45.710
<v Speaker 3>they were teaming up with communists and</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are also trying to help the </v>

1598
01:28:45.710 --> 01:28:47.510
<v Speaker 3>poor for secular reasons and political </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons,</v>

1599
01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:52.840
<v Speaker 3>not for Christian reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he said this is wrong because it </v>

1600
01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:54.320
<v Speaker 3>communistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually that movement,</v>

1601
01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:58.400
<v Speaker 3>there's this radical Catholic movements </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a huge influence in South America.</v>

1602
01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 3>And I think the present pope is somebody</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's come out</v>

1603
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:05.070
<v Speaker 1>of that world who's been very much </v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by it.</v>

1604
01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:09.270
<v Speaker 1>It's so problematic though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The suppressing his sexuality like that.</v>

1605
01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:14.300
<v Speaker 1>The number one thing that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>associate Catholicism width is sexual </v>

1606
01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:18.921
<v Speaker 1>assault is sexually molesting children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like a huge aspect.</v>

1607
01:29:19.051 --> 01:29:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I grew up a Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was only in,</v>

1608
01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:26.130
<v Speaker 1>I was a practicing Catholic when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>very young.</v>

1609
01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:31.400
<v Speaker 1>I went to a Catholic school in New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jersey for first grade and it was a very</v>

1610
01:29:31.741 --> 01:29:34.880
<v Speaker 1>bad schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really dark and suppressing,</v>

1611
01:29:35.250 --> 01:29:40.250
<v Speaker 1>just very nasty and mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the nuns were just horrific people </v>

1612
01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:44.850
<v Speaker 1>and essentially shied me away from all </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion at a very young age before </v>

1613
01:29:44.850 --> 01:29:45.870
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1614
01:29:45.890 --> 01:29:47.190
<v Speaker 1>it was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was terrible.</v>

1615
01:29:47.370 --> 01:29:52.370
<v Speaker 1>But I have other friends that were also </v>
<v Speaker 1>raised Catholic that literally had to </v>

1616
01:29:52.370 --> 01:29:56.840
<v Speaker 1>fight off the priests sexual attempts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that this is like a standard thing.</v>

1617
01:29:57.121 --> 01:30:00.270
<v Speaker 1>If it's a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an on running joke in America about</v>

1618
01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:02.940
<v Speaker 1>priests being sexual predators.</v>

1619
01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:05.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a constant thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1620
01:30:06.130 --> 01:30:11.130
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to me like one of the number </v>

1621
01:30:11.130 --> 01:30:11.520
<v Speaker 1>one issues with that particular brand of</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

1622
01:30:11.730 --> 01:30:16.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like this idea that you're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>take what is essentially just a natural </v>

1623
01:30:16.730 --> 01:30:20.811
<v Speaker 1>part of being a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not doing anything with the </v>

1624
01:30:20.811 --> 01:30:21.690
<v Speaker 1>reproductive cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just telling them to ignore it.</v>

1625
01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:26.400
<v Speaker 1>You have this consistent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constant bodily function.</v>

1626
01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:31.320
<v Speaker 1>There's your body's reproducing fluids </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a regular basis and you living backed</v>

1627
01:30:31.321 --> 01:30:36.321
<v Speaker 1>up all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also you're not experiencing any </v>

1628
01:30:36.321 --> 01:30:38.070
<v Speaker 1>romantic interaction with human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1629
01:30:38.370 --> 01:30:41.510
<v Speaker 1>No affection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no sexual affection,</v>

1630
01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:42.330
<v Speaker 1>no nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1631
01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:46.740
<v Speaker 1>you're missing out on a huge part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is to be a person.</v>

1632
01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:52.040
<v Speaker 1>And these people grow up and they live </v>
<v Speaker 1>cradle to the grave in this sort of </v>

1633
01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:56.370
<v Speaker 1>weird non developed state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1634
01:30:56.371 --> 01:31:00.060
<v Speaker 1>they're not like the rest of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can barely even understand.</v>

1635
01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I had a friend that went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage counseling with a Catholic </v>

1636
01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:06.340
<v Speaker 1>priest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm my.</v>

1637
01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:10.150
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like going to Hitler and,</v>

1638
01:31:10.151 --> 01:31:12.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking how to have world peace and maybe</v>

1639
01:31:12.110 --> 01:31:13.260
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1640
01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:18.280
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to a guy who not only </v>

1641
01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:21.110
<v Speaker 1>does not have any sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has never had a relationship but is </v>

1642
01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:25.281
<v Speaker 1>drunk all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had gin blossoms all over his face </v>

1643
01:31:25.281 --> 01:31:28.280
<v Speaker 1>and kids run away from them because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid it's going to touch them </v>

1644
01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:29.190
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to go to that guy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to give you marriage advice.</v>

1645
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a terrible thing and I mean</v>

1646
01:31:33.541 --> 01:31:35.850
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of good priests who </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do this.</v>

1647
01:31:36.210 --> 01:31:41.210
<v Speaker 1>And I met quite a few windows in India </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have reverend Catholic priests </v>

1648
01:31:41.210 --> 01:31:43.280
<v Speaker 1>whose friends and so I think it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>minority.</v>

1649
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:46.920
<v Speaker 1>It may have been quite a big minority in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ireland and in some countries,</v>

1650
01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:52.460
<v Speaker 1>but I think it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people are called to a celibate </v>

1651
01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:55.821
<v Speaker 1>life and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's fine for people to </v>

1652
01:31:55.821 --> 01:31:55.821
<v Speaker 1>get become monks or nuns if that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're called to.</v>

1653
01:31:55.821 --> 01:31:59.010
<v Speaker 1>But for regular priests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a serious mistake.</v>

1654
01:31:59.050 --> 01:32:00.360
<v Speaker 1>And I'm</v>

1655
01:32:01.630 --> 01:32:06.630
<v Speaker 3>in the Church of England ever since 15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 or something and in the process and </v>

1656
01:32:06.630 --> 01:32:11.581
<v Speaker 3>churches in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>priests have been able to marry and </v>

1657
01:32:11.581 --> 01:32:12.400
<v Speaker 3>rabbis Mary in Judaism and I think is </v>
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>

1658
01:32:12.401 --> 01:32:15.910
<v Speaker 3>much healthier to have priests as </v>
<v Speaker 3>regular guys.</v>

1659
01:32:15.911 --> 01:32:20.911
<v Speaker 3>We love lives and kids and things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that side of Catholicism is a</v>

1660
01:32:21.551 --> 01:32:23.670
<v Speaker 3>serious mistake and I think they should </v>
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>

1661
01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:28.800
<v Speaker 3>Sooner or later it'll have to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>reformed because repression of sexuality</v>

1662
01:32:29.050 --> 01:32:33.370
<v Speaker 3>leads to all these extremely unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A negative consequences.</v>

1663
01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:35.230
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you about it.</v>

1664
01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:41.400
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are reform movements within </v>

1665
01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:41.980
<v Speaker 3>Catholicism and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're in America.</v>

1666
01:32:41.981 --> 01:32:46.390
<v Speaker 3>They're a breakaway Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Churches with women priests for example,</v>

1667
01:32:46.391 --> 01:32:49.720
<v Speaker 3>there's one in Santa Barbara and of </v>
<v Speaker 3>course it's in Santa Barbara,</v>

1668
01:32:50.130 --> 01:32:52.510
<v Speaker 3>freaks up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're loaded.</v>

1669
01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:54.370
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1670
01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:55.940
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1671
01:32:56.110 --> 01:32:57.430
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

1672
01:32:57.431 --> 01:32:59.920
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a very negative thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you see,</v>

1673
01:32:59.921 --> 01:33:03.370
<v Speaker 3>I think that to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to reject the entire,</v>

1674
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:08.430
<v Speaker 3>some people reject the entire world of </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion because of personal bad </v>

1675
01:33:08.430 --> 01:33:09.790
<v Speaker 3>experiences with one particular brand.</v>

1676
01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:12.510
<v Speaker 3>I think it's rather like throwing out </v>
<v Speaker 3>the baby with the bath water.</v>

1677
01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:17.720
<v Speaker 3>It would be like saying I'm against </v>
<v Speaker 3>science because it gave us gas that </v>

1678
01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:21.160
<v Speaker 3>kittle used to kill people and it gave </v>
<v Speaker 3>us the atomic bomb that killed people in</v>

1679
01:33:21.161 --> 01:33:22.930
<v Speaker 3>Hiroshima.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm against science.</v>

1680
01:33:23.290 --> 01:33:25.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

1681
01:33:25.001 --> 01:33:25.790
<v Speaker 3>human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1682
01:33:25.970 --> 01:33:30.970
<v Speaker 3>there are really bad things that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been done by humans in the name of </v>

1683
01:33:30.970 --> 01:33:32.460
<v Speaker 3>almost anything you care to mention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nationalism,</v>

1684
01:33:32.461 --> 01:33:34.120
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>

1685
01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:36.340
<v Speaker 3>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology.</v>

1686
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:41.790
<v Speaker 3>So when you decided to join this </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular group of Christians and </v>

1687
01:33:43.361 --> 01:33:46.870
<v Speaker 3>become a Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>officially identify,</v>

1688
01:33:47.170 --> 01:33:49.390
<v Speaker 3>was there resistance from your </v>
<v Speaker 3>colleagues?</v>

1689
01:33:49.391 --> 01:33:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Reserve resistance from other </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists?</v>

1690
01:33:51.191 --> 01:33:53.140
<v Speaker 3>Like how old were you at the time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1691
01:33:53.141 --> 01:33:58.030
<v Speaker 3>I was 33,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1692
01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:00.040
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1693
01:34:00.041 --> 01:34:02.170
<v Speaker 3>not among.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was working in India at the time.</v>

1694
01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:05.500
<v Speaker 3>There's hardly any acs in India.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a few,</v>

1695
01:34:05.501 --> 01:34:09.460
<v Speaker 3>but among my scientific colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was working with Indian scientists.</v>

1696
01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:13.540
<v Speaker 3>Almost all Indians are Hindu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hindu or Muslim,</v>

1697
01:34:13.541 --> 01:34:15.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they went home from work,</v>

1698
01:34:15.011 --> 01:34:17.520
<v Speaker 3>they'd be regular Hindus and Muslims </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1699
01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:22.510
<v Speaker 3>Very few of them were atheists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm among my Indian colleagues.</v>

1700
01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:28.020
<v Speaker 3>Being a practicing Christian when I came</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a Christian family in a Christian </v>

1701
01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:31.681
<v Speaker 3>country seemed totally normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one thought that was at all weird or </v>

1702
01:34:31.681 --> 01:34:35.491
<v Speaker 3>strange when I got back to England.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm among many of my scientific friends.</v>

1703
01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:41.430
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they thought this was completely weird </v>

1704
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:45.000
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just couldn't understand it because </v>

1705
01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:46.720
<v Speaker 3>they assume that any Christian believes </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world's made in 6,000</v>

1706
01:34:46.721 --> 01:34:51.721
<v Speaker 3>years ago and God intervenes through </v>
<v Speaker 3>suspending the laws of nature in </v>

1707
01:34:51.721 --> 01:34:56.461
<v Speaker 3>miracles that are totally incredible and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't believe in the kind of God I </v>

1708
01:34:56.461 --> 01:34:57.420
<v Speaker 3>don't believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1709
01:34:57.990 --> 01:35:02.420
<v Speaker 3>but they never actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very few ever asked what do you actually</v>

1710
01:35:02.421 --> 01:35:07.421
<v Speaker 3>think or believe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just sort of treated it as best as </v>

1711
01:35:07.421 --> 01:35:10.490
<v Speaker 3>some kind of personal eccentricity or </v>
<v Speaker 3>mental feebleness or something.</v>

1712
01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and while retaining,</v>

1713
01:35:13.931 --> 01:35:16.280
<v Speaker 3>rather than narrow dogmatically atheist </v>
<v Speaker 3>view,</v>

1714
01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:19.610
<v Speaker 3>I lot of my friends are atheists or </v>
<v Speaker 3>agnostics,</v>

1715
01:35:19.611 --> 01:35:24.611
<v Speaker 3>but the problem I have with atheists and</v>
<v Speaker 3>materialists is that most of them are </v>

1716
01:35:24.611 --> 01:35:28.220
<v Speaker 3>much more dogmatic than the people I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know within the religious world.</v>

1717
01:35:28.690 --> 01:35:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a problem with anybody that's </v>

1718
01:35:33.690 --> 01:35:33.690
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do I.</v>

1719
01:35:33.690 --> 01:35:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1720
01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:36.070
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I speak to some atheists,</v>

1721
01:35:36.071 --> 01:35:38.800
<v Speaker 1>I have this issue where they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressively atheist,</v>

1722
01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:40.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you know,</v>

1723
01:35:40.930 --> 01:35:41.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1724
01:35:41.541 --> 01:35:45.460
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to people who the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not just atheist,</v>

1725
01:35:45.490 --> 01:35:50.490
<v Speaker 1>but they get upset at anyone who's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my question to them is always like,</v>

1726
01:35:51.671 --> 01:35:53.380
<v Speaker 1>have you ever had a psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience?</v>

1727
01:35:53.590 --> 01:35:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I speak with someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressively atheists,</v>

1728
01:35:56.950 --> 01:36:00.290
<v Speaker 1>and if they say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1729
01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:01.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you waiting for?</v>

1730
01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Because if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really want to question your,</v>

1731
01:36:04.770 --> 01:36:09.770
<v Speaker 1>your whole idea of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no better method than a </v>

1732
01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:14.191
<v Speaker 1>breakthrough psychedelic experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a breakthrough psychedelic </v>

1733
01:36:14.191 --> 01:36:14.590
<v Speaker 1>experience and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was nothing,</v>

1734
01:36:15.070 --> 01:36:20.070
<v Speaker 1>well then you're a unique person because</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody I've ever met that has a </v>

1735
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:21.610
<v Speaker 1>breakthrough psychedelic experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a dmt trip.</v>

1736
01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:23.800
<v Speaker 1>They have to step back and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1737
01:36:23.801 --> 01:36:25.300
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know that was possible.</v>

1738
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:28.750
<v Speaker 1>I've lived my whole life with this one </v>
<v Speaker 1>worldview that,</v>

1739
01:36:28.810 --> 01:36:33.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see these people that are religious </v>

1740
01:36:33.810 --> 01:36:36.060
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to me that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>following this ridiculous ideology is </v>

1741
01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:38.860
<v Speaker 1>based on some ancient information that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people wrote down on animal skins.</v>

1742
01:36:38.861 --> 01:36:43.861
<v Speaker 1>It's all preposterous and what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is they're just a bunch of scared </v>

1743
01:36:43.861 --> 01:36:46.981
<v Speaker 1>children that are afraid of the light </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what I'm doing is basing my life on </v>

1744
01:36:46.981 --> 01:36:50.311
<v Speaker 1>science and rational thinking and logic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you have a psychedelic trip and</v>

1745
01:36:50.501 --> 01:36:52.690
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing rational about that.</v>

1746
01:36:52.750 --> 01:36:55.660
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing logical about that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how's that so close?</v>

1747
01:36:55.870 --> 01:36:59.530
<v Speaker 1>It's so nearby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like someone telling you a dmt trip</v>

1748
01:36:59.531 --> 01:37:00.820
<v Speaker 1>is like someone telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1749
01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I want to show you something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go into this room real quick,</v>

1750
01:37:05.170 --> 01:37:07.660
<v Speaker 1>and you opened that door and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>new universe.</v>

1751
01:37:07.661 --> 01:37:10.870
<v Speaker 1>They're a completely different universe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's filled with life.</v>

1752
01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:15.760
<v Speaker 1>It's fractal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never ending and it occupies a very</v>

1753
01:37:15.761 --> 01:37:20.761
<v Speaker 1>small space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet it's infinite and it's filled </v>

1754
01:37:20.761 --> 01:37:21.210
<v Speaker 1>with conscious beings that can see </v>
<v Speaker 1>through you.</v>

1755
01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Recognize all your bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Recognize all your insecurities and all </v>

1756
01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:30.661
<v Speaker 1>your incorrect thinking and ego and and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they try to and then you shut the </v>

1757
01:37:30.661 --> 01:37:31.810
<v Speaker 1>door and you go back to regular life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1758
01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:34.270
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that room?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That room?</v>

1759
01:37:34.271 --> 01:37:35.890
<v Speaker 1>That's the God room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right there.</v>

1760
01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Like if you don't go into that </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience like your whole,</v>

1761
01:37:40.150 --> 01:37:45.150
<v Speaker 1>like I think we live our lives based on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We sort of calculate our worldview based</v>

1762
01:37:47.801 --> 01:37:50.020
<v Speaker 1>on the experiences that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulated,</v>

1763
01:37:50.021 --> 01:37:55.021
<v Speaker 1>what we've learned from these </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences and what we've learned from </v>

1764
01:37:55.021 --> 01:37:55.330
<v Speaker 1>other people's experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we've read,</v>

1765
01:37:55.530 --> 01:37:57.900
<v Speaker 1>what we've seen in documentaries and </v>
<v Speaker 1>films,</v>

1766
01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:02.790
<v Speaker 1>but when you have a really intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experience particularly,</v>

1767
01:38:03.330 --> 01:38:05.760
<v Speaker 1>and then for some people yoga and </v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation,</v>

1768
01:38:05.761 --> 01:38:08.130
<v Speaker 1>some people are able to achieve some </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty deep states,</v>

1769
01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:11.670
<v Speaker 1>but the psychedelic experience in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular is.</v>

1770
01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:14.580
<v Speaker 1>It's shocking because it's so easy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to.</v>

1771
01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:19.910
<v Speaker 1>It's just right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four hits of the DMT and boom blast off </v>

1772
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:24.830
<v Speaker 1>and then 15 minutes later you're left </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this new experience that you have </v>

1773
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:28.740
<v Speaker 1>to assimilate and figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make sense of it.</v>

1774
01:38:29.190 --> 01:38:31.890
<v Speaker 1>The atheist and I talked to that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like super aggressive.</v>

1775
01:38:31.891 --> 01:38:36.891
<v Speaker 1>They're just like religious people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and a lot of ways it's kind of </v>

1776
01:38:36.891 --> 01:38:41.121
<v Speaker 1>scientific fundamentalism and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also morphing now know if you're </v>

1777
01:38:41.121 --> 01:38:42.450
<v Speaker 1>aware of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In America it's morphing,</v>

1778
01:38:42.630 --> 01:38:47.630
<v Speaker 1>there's atheism and then there's an even</v>
<v Speaker 1>more aggressive group called atheism </v>

1779
01:38:47.630 --> 01:38:48.140
<v Speaker 1>plus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1780
01:38:48.190 --> 01:38:49.590
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1781
01:38:49.650 --> 01:38:54.650
<v Speaker 1>and what they're doing is they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>attaching a bunch of moral and ethical </v>

1782
01:38:54.650 --> 01:38:58.731
<v Speaker 1>values to religion essentially creating </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like another religion and I think</v>

1783
01:38:58.981 --> 01:39:03.981
<v Speaker 1>with good intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of his good intentions a </v>

1784
01:39:03.981 --> 01:39:03.981
<v Speaker 1>lot of is based on.</v>

1785
01:39:03.981 --> 01:39:08.000
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it is based on feminism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of is based on the idea of </v>

1786
01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:12.450
<v Speaker 1>avoiding harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoiding sexual harassment,</v>

1787
01:39:12.451 --> 01:39:17.451
<v Speaker 1>avoiding like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They their ethics are to completely </v>

1788
01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:21.870
<v Speaker 1>define what's acceptable behavior like </v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1789
01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:24.630
<v Speaker 1>no racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no sexual harassment,</v>

1790
01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:29.370
<v Speaker 1>no undeniable acceptance of women's </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>

1791
01:39:29.371 --> 01:39:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Undeniable acceptance of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting,</v>

1792
01:39:32.700 --> 01:39:37.700
<v Speaker 1>but then of course once you define that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have a aggressive members of </v>

1793
01:39:38.401 --> 01:39:43.401
<v Speaker 1>that group that are attacking people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that disagree with any of their </v>

1794
01:39:43.401 --> 01:39:45.990
<v Speaker 1>propositions or anyone that supports </v>
<v Speaker 1>men's rights.</v>

1795
01:39:45.991 --> 01:39:50.991
<v Speaker 1>Of course now he hates women and you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of weirdness in that area because </v>

1796
01:39:50.991 --> 01:39:53.370
<v Speaker 1>they can only be feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can't be men's rights as well,</v>

1797
01:39:53.670 --> 01:39:56.490
<v Speaker 1>men's rights or toxic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas women's rights,</v>

1798
01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:01.640
<v Speaker 1>once there is a cheat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once they have achieved a totally </v>

1799
01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:04.911
<v Speaker 1>quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's no need for men's rights </v>

1800
01:40:04.911 --> 01:40:05.040
<v Speaker 1>because once feminism has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>established,</v>

1801
01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:10.160
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty illogical assumption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you consider like </v>

1802
01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:10.160
<v Speaker 1>divorce laws.</v>

1803
01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:11.480
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

1804
01:40:12.380 --> 01:40:14.650
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't agree more about DMT and,</v>

1805
01:40:14.670 --> 01:40:16.910
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the opening that it can give.</v>

1806
01:40:16.911 --> 01:40:21.911
<v Speaker 3>I mean I had the great advantage of </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking it for the first time with </v>

1807
01:40:21.911 --> 01:40:25.280
<v Speaker 3>Terence Mckenna and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

1808
01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:28.060
<v Speaker 3>do you want to check this out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1809
01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:31.460
<v Speaker 3>And that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the resume,</v>

1810
01:40:31.461 --> 01:40:33.170
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first time you did DMT,</v>

1811
01:40:33.590 --> 01:40:35.010
<v Speaker 3>Terence Mckenna?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1812
01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:40.900
<v Speaker 3>I won't say where or when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it could be put down on some </v>

1813
01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:40.900
<v Speaker 3>record somewhere that's probably already</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1814
01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:43.750
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1815
01:40:44.780 --> 01:40:49.280
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me it corresponded in many ways with</v>

1816
01:40:49.281 --> 01:40:54.281
<v Speaker 3>what people talk about near death </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences because I went out through </v>

1817
01:40:54.281 --> 01:40:57.070
<v Speaker 3>light into a realm of great bliss and </v>
<v Speaker 3>beauty.</v>

1818
01:40:57.071 --> 01:41:02.071
<v Speaker 3>And then I came back and it was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming back from a million miles away </v>

1819
01:41:02.071 --> 01:41:05.560
<v Speaker 3>and just coming back into my body and as</v>
<v Speaker 3>it were being born again.</v>

1820
01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:08.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was,</v>

1821
01:41:08.441 --> 01:41:11.590
<v Speaker 3>it was very much like a death and </v>
<v Speaker 3>rebirth experience for me.</v>

1822
01:41:11.610 --> 01:41:13.720
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was very,</v>

1823
01:41:13.721 --> 01:41:16.030
<v Speaker 3>very transformative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1824
01:41:16.630 --> 01:41:18.370
<v Speaker 3>incidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1825
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:23.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been trying to understand this </v>

1826
01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:23.430
<v Speaker 3>American phenomena with southern </v>
<v Speaker 3>baptists.</v>

1827
01:41:23.530 --> 01:41:28.530
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the key to this is that I think when </v>

1828
01:41:28.530 --> 01:41:31.540
<v Speaker 3>they talk about being born again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>originally baptism was just that.</v>

1829
01:41:31.730 --> 01:41:35.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean now you can get this through dmt </v>
<v Speaker 3>in five minutes,</v>

1830
01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:38.530
<v Speaker 3>but at the time of John The baptist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get it in five minutes through being</v>

1831
01:41:38.531 --> 01:41:41.290
<v Speaker 3>drowned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were lining up on the bank of the</v>

1832
01:41:41.291 --> 01:41:42.580
<v Speaker 3>Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go in,</v>

1833
01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:45.700
<v Speaker 3>he holds them under.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he held him under just long enough,</v>

1834
01:41:45.970 --> 01:41:48.700
<v Speaker 3>you could actually induce a near death </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

1835
01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:53.740
<v Speaker 3>New Life Review at the drowning man sees</v>
<v Speaker 3>his life pass before him hold the amount</v>

1836
01:41:53.921 --> 01:41:58.921
<v Speaker 3>of just long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they'd have a near death experience </v>

1837
01:41:58.921 --> 01:41:59.050
<v Speaker 3>almost guaranteed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1838
01:41:59.051 --> 01:42:01.180
<v Speaker 3>occasionally they might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he might have done it too long,</v>

1839
01:42:01.181 --> 01:42:03.360
<v Speaker 3>but that was before litigation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1840
01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:04.320
<v Speaker 3>you might've lost.</v>

1841
01:42:07.490 --> 01:42:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good theory actually.</v>

1842
01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:12.630
<v Speaker 3>Then you see they come back and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1843
01:42:12.730 --> 01:42:14.530
<v Speaker 3>I've died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen the light.</v>

1844
01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:17.800
<v Speaker 3>I've been born again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm no longer afraid of death.</v>

1845
01:42:18.010 --> 01:42:22.930
<v Speaker 3>My life has been transformed in five </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes and the baptists were the people</v>

1846
01:42:22.931 --> 01:42:27.931
<v Speaker 3>who revived baptism by total immersion </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the 16th century and probably no in </v>

1847
01:42:29.070 --> 01:42:34.070
<v Speaker 3>in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't hold them under that long </v>

1848
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.930
<v Speaker 3>because this is post litigation now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know when,</v>

1849
01:42:34.931 --> 01:42:39.931
<v Speaker 3>when the Baptist first got going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea of holding people aren't long </v>

1850
01:42:39.931 --> 01:42:44.071
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All their language is the language that </v>

1851
01:42:44.071 --> 01:42:47.281
<v Speaker 3>relates to near death experiences and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think that to start with baptism </v>

1852
01:42:47.281 --> 01:42:50.260
<v Speaker 3>by total immersion was just symbolic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was drowning.</v>

1853
01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is quite fascinating and it makes </v>

1854
01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:58.281
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about ordeal poisoning or </v>

1855
01:42:58.281 --> 01:43:01.171
<v Speaker 1>deal poisoning being the substitute for </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics in certain cultures where </v>

1856
01:43:01.171 --> 01:43:01.440
<v Speaker 1>they don't have access to psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 1>plants,</v>

1857
01:43:01.650 --> 01:43:04.680
<v Speaker 1>they would take essentially a poison </v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't kill you.</v>

1858
01:43:04.830 --> 01:43:08.670
<v Speaker 1>It got you right to the door where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wish you were dead almost.</v>

1859
01:43:08.671 --> 01:43:13.671
<v Speaker 1>You were in horrible pain and even in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some cultures they use ant venom like </v>

1860
01:43:13.671 --> 01:43:14.470
<v Speaker 1>those bullet ants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

1861
01:43:14.550 --> 01:43:19.500
<v Speaker 1>They use that for these ritualistic a </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming of age rituals,</v>

1862
01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:24.740
<v Speaker 1>these coming of age rituals where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>take people through these intensely </v>

1863
01:43:24.740 --> 01:43:28.500
<v Speaker 1>painful moments where they almost want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be dead just to end the suffering and</v>

1864
01:43:28.501 --> 01:43:30.000
<v Speaker 1>then when they come through and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other side,</v>

1865
01:43:30.001 --> 01:43:32.910
<v Speaker 1>there are a better person because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're more reflective.</v>

1866
01:43:32.911 --> 01:43:35.820
<v Speaker 1>They're sort of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They appreciate that.</v>

1867
01:43:35.821 --> 01:43:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Just the very breath that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to take.</v>

1868
01:43:38.161 --> 01:43:42.120
<v Speaker 1>They appreciate the sky seems bluer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The grass seems greener.</v>

1869
01:43:42.121 --> 01:43:46.200
<v Speaker 1>The life has more vibrancy to it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've gone through this ordeal.</v>

1870
01:43:46.201 --> 01:43:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Poison or these toxic venom or what have</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1871
01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a right of passage.</v>

1872
01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Almost all rites</v>

1873
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:53.880
<v Speaker 3>of passage for adolescents in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1874
01:43:53.930 --> 01:43:58.930
<v Speaker 3>in traditional cultures involved </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like a death and rebirth </v>

1875
01:43:58.930 --> 01:44:02.291
<v Speaker 3>experience and I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what's going on and </v>

1876
01:44:02.291 --> 01:44:06.281
<v Speaker 3>actually I think that the why the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Baptist became so powerful and why for </v>

1877
01:44:06.281 --> 01:44:10.241
<v Speaker 3>them the conversion experience was so </v>
<v Speaker 3>real and why they talk about it so much </v>

1878
01:44:10.241 --> 01:44:11.630
<v Speaker 3>is that because for many of them it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

1879
01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:16.930
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just a symbolic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't signing up to some set of </v>

1880
01:44:16.930 --> 01:44:21.191
<v Speaker 3>beliefs and I think this is the core of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all religions is this direct experience </v>

1881
01:44:21.191 --> 01:44:24.380
<v Speaker 3>of the divine and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what they all come from.</v>

1882
01:44:24.381 --> 01:44:26.390
<v Speaker 3>They come from experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not theories.</v>

1883
01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:27.310
<v Speaker 3>What's quite</v>

1884
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:32.430
<v Speaker 1>shocking to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerusalem scholars like may like </v>

1885
01:44:32.430 --> 01:44:36.120
<v Speaker 1>mainstream scholars now or considering </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Moses was probably under the </v>

1886
01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:39.190
<v Speaker 1>influence of DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They believed that the burning Bush,</v>

1887
01:44:39.220 --> 01:44:40.020
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1888
01:44:40.250 --> 01:44:42.160
<v Speaker 1>guys are not like psychedelically based </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all,</v>

1889
01:44:42.430 --> 01:44:47.430
<v Speaker 1>was quite probably the Acacia Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a very rich in dmt plant and </v>

1890
01:44:48.510 --> 01:44:50.260
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole idea of the burning </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush.</v>

1891
01:44:50.410 --> 01:44:52.360
<v Speaker 1>He sees God through a burning Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1892
01:44:52.510 --> 01:44:56.490
<v Speaker 1>how much clear does it have to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's acacia trees all over that.</v>

1893
01:44:56.520 --> 01:45:01.520
<v Speaker 1>That part of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says very rich plant as far as the </v>

1894
01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:04.330
<v Speaker 1>content of DMT in it and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience that,</v>

1895
01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:06.160
<v Speaker 1>it's very much like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1896
01:45:06.161 --> 01:45:11.161
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're experiencing God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like it seems very divine </v>

1897
01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:14.230
<v Speaker 1>when you have a dmt trip.</v>

1898
01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:15.720
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1899
01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:19.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean why not be experiencing God?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1900
01:45:19.531 --> 01:45:24.531
<v Speaker 3>it seems unlike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems non economical theory to say </v>

1901
01:45:24.531 --> 01:45:25.860
<v Speaker 3>that this divine bliss as experienced by</v>
<v Speaker 3>mystics,</v>

1902
01:45:25.861 --> 01:45:28.260
<v Speaker 3>that part of the nature of mind is </v>
<v Speaker 3>bliss.</v>

1903
01:45:28.261 --> 01:45:33.261
<v Speaker 3>I mean the Hindu name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the names sachit and ended up </v>

1904
01:45:33.261 --> 01:45:35.910
<v Speaker 3>being knowledge place as in the nature </v>
<v Speaker 3>of God.</v>

1905
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:39.540
<v Speaker 3>If God's consciousness is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>blessed consciousness,</v>

1906
01:45:40.050 --> 01:45:43.830
<v Speaker 3>then if you have this experience that </v>
<v Speaker 3>seems like garden is blissful,</v>

1907
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:50.270
<v Speaker 3>why have a hypothesis that that some </v>
<v Speaker 3>other bliss consciousness that isn't </v>

1908
01:45:50.270 --> 01:45:51.330
<v Speaker 3>divine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that some kind of duplicate,</v>

1909
01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:53.310
<v Speaker 3>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be the real thing.</v>

1910
01:45:53.311 --> 01:45:55.440
<v Speaker 3>I think it makes so much more sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1911
01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:56.760
<v Speaker 3>totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it,</v>

1912
01:45:57.060 --> 01:46:01.410
<v Speaker 1>it makes as much sense as anything else </v>
<v Speaker 1>and these plants are real.</v>

1913
01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I've always wondered if that and many </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people speculator as well,</v>

1914
01:46:05.610 --> 01:46:10.610
<v Speaker 1>if that's the reason why Hindus don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>participate in eating cows too because </v>

1915
01:46:10.610 --> 01:46:14.961
<v Speaker 1>of the psilocybin mushrooms growing on </v>
<v Speaker 1>cows on a regular basis and that being </v>

1916
01:46:15.170 --> 01:46:16.770
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of people believe that basis</v>

1917
01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:19.260
<v Speaker 3>Soma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1918
01:46:19.261 --> 01:46:20.070
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1919
01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:25.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm don't terrence's theory about Strip </v>
<v Speaker 3>area and these mushrooms growing on car </v>

1920
01:46:25.530 --> 01:46:29.010
<v Speaker 3>dung is okay as far as it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in England,</v>

1921
01:46:29.011 --> 01:46:29.930
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1922
01:46:29.931 --> 01:46:34.931
<v Speaker 3>the magic mushroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the liberty cap doesn't grow on car </v>

1923
01:46:34.931 --> 01:46:38.660
<v Speaker 3>dying at grows in sort of meadows and </v>
<v Speaker 3>usually no carson if anything,</v>

1924
01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:41.460
<v Speaker 3>the sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen them.</v>

1925
01:46:41.490 --> 01:46:46.490
<v Speaker 3>They grow wild in Wales and I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>encountered them on location and there's</v>

1926
01:46:47.340 --> 01:46:52.340
<v Speaker 3>nothing to do with piles of Dung.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's many different </v>

1927
01:46:52.340 --> 01:46:53.100
<v Speaker 3>environments in which psychoactive </v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms grow.</v>

1928
01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:57.870
<v Speaker 3>Some kinds rely on the car done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think he rather over emphasize the</v>

1929
01:46:57.871 --> 01:46:58.530
<v Speaker 3>car dunk.</v>

1930
01:46:58.650 --> 01:47:03.650
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think was the source of </v>

1931
01:47:03.650 --> 01:47:06.380
<v Speaker 1>cattle worship like Chuck Tall Oak and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these ancient civilizations that </v>

1932
01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:09.470
<v Speaker 1>worship cattle and this connection that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mckenna made with,</v>

1933
01:47:09.471 --> 01:47:10.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

1934
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:15.310
<v Speaker 1>those people worshiping the capital </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the cattle didn't just provide </v>

1935
01:47:15.310 --> 01:47:16.260
<v Speaker 1>life and food because they had milk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat,</v>

1936
01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:20.580
<v Speaker 1>but also that there was this connection </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a psychedelic mushrooms.</v>

1937
01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:24.430
<v Speaker 3>I take now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find that a bit far fetched personally</v>

1938
01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:26.830
<v Speaker 3>in some countries like in England and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1939
01:47:26.950 --> 01:47:31.950
<v Speaker 3>there was a whole sweatshop in the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a whole sweatshop sacred </v>

1940
01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:33.230
<v Speaker 3>horses too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1941
01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:36.520
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are many different kinds of sacred</v>

1942
01:47:36.521 --> 01:47:40.390
<v Speaker 3>animal even in India is not just caused </v>
<v Speaker 3>the to sacred elephants are sacred.</v>

1943
01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:41.790
<v Speaker 3>Ganesh shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1944
01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:43.840
<v Speaker 3>the elephant God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But elephants are sacred.</v>

1945
01:47:43.870 --> 01:47:47.950
<v Speaker 3>Even rats are sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in India and monkeys,</v>

1946
01:47:48.370 --> 01:47:50.560
<v Speaker 3>so lots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of sacred animals.</v>

1947
01:47:50.980 --> 01:47:53.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that probably come,</v>

1948
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:58.750
<v Speaker 3>I think with the ones that are wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically wild like elephants and rats </v>

1949
01:47:58.931 --> 01:48:03.931
<v Speaker 3>and monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's probably comes out to shamanic </v>

1950
01:48:03.931 --> 01:48:07.201
<v Speaker 3>roots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think when people started </v>

1951
01:48:07.201 --> 01:48:09.540
<v Speaker 3>domesticating animals then know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you relate to domesticated </v>

1952
01:48:10.241 --> 01:48:15.241
<v Speaker 3>animals?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they like slaves or are they the cow</v>

1953
01:48:16.031 --> 01:48:18.280
<v Speaker 3>is seen by most induces the divine </v>
<v Speaker 3>mother,</v>

1954
01:48:18.281 --> 01:48:19.490
<v Speaker 3>the provider of milk.</v>

1955
01:48:19.490 --> 01:48:24.490
<v Speaker 3>And do you regard them as sacred or do </v>
<v Speaker 3>you just regard them as cogs in a </v>

1956
01:48:24.490 --> 01:48:24.640
<v Speaker 3>factory farming machine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1957
01:48:24.670 --> 01:48:27.490
<v Speaker 3>that's the way they are regarded now in </v>
<v Speaker 3>feed lots and so on,</v>

1958
01:48:27.491 --> 01:48:30.500
<v Speaker 3>in the United States and in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1959
01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:35.140
<v Speaker 3>but I think in a religious culture when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you domesticate animals,</v>

1960
01:48:35.141 --> 01:48:38.140
<v Speaker 3>there's a sense in which they take on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious significance.</v>

1961
01:48:38.710 --> 01:48:39.470
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1962
01:48:40.250 --> 01:48:41.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1963
01:48:42.010 --> 01:48:47.010
<v Speaker 3>for the Jewish people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then goats and sheep were the main ones </v>

1964
01:48:47.010 --> 01:48:48.230
<v Speaker 3>that took on the religious significance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1965
01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:51.730
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Lamb of God that takes away the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sins of the world.</v>

1966
01:48:51.731 --> 01:48:53.360
<v Speaker 3>The Agnes de,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1967
01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:57.520
<v Speaker 3>this is a sacrificial lamb which is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of sacred lamb.</v>

1968
01:48:57.850 --> 01:49:01.180
<v Speaker 3>And so there's a synchronization of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sheep in the Judaic Christian,</v>

1969
01:49:01.181 --> 01:49:02.500
<v Speaker 3>in the Islamic tradition.</v>

1970
01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:08.520
<v Speaker 1>It completely makes sense that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>would worship cows and even horses </v>

1971
01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:10.350
<v Speaker 1>because they need the horses for </v>
<v Speaker 1>transportation.</v>

1972
01:49:10.580 --> 01:49:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1973
01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:15.720
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of cultures they even used </v>
<v Speaker 1>horses to stay alive.</v>

1974
01:49:15.721 --> 01:49:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Like they drank the blood of the horses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a big thing with the Mongols.</v>

1975
01:49:19.921 --> 01:49:22.800
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They brought like you know each.</v>

1976
01:49:23.010 --> 01:49:28.010
<v Speaker 1>Each man had many horses that they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>carry with them and they would mix it </v>

1977
01:49:28.010 --> 01:49:28.680
<v Speaker 1>with milk and it would be a way to stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

1978
01:49:28.710 --> 01:49:32.550
<v Speaker 1>May or may would take the blood of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain horses,</v>

1979
01:49:32.551 --> 01:49:35.760
<v Speaker 1>the milk of other ones and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>

1980
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:39.570
<v Speaker 1>What I've always wondered those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did they,</v>

1981
01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:44.100
<v Speaker 1>how did they lose the meaning of Soma?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how do,</v>

1982
01:49:44.130 --> 01:49:46.500
<v Speaker 1>how is that such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an open thing?</v>

1983
01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Open interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what?</v>

1984
01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:51.250
<v Speaker 1>What happened to if it was such an </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing thing.</v>

1985
01:49:51.550 --> 01:49:53.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean you read the descriptions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Salma,</v>

1986
01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:57.840
<v Speaker 1>how fantastic it is and how huge a part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

1987
01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:01.180
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't their culture and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection to the divine.</v>

1988
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:03.400
<v Speaker 1>How did they lose what it means,</v>

1989
01:50:03.970 --> 01:50:06.760
<v Speaker 3>but I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a mystery and it's seminary</v>

1990
01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:11.830
<v Speaker 3>increased the Eleusinian mysteries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This cave where they went in these </v>

1991
01:50:11.830 --> 01:50:14.310
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic rites of passage that Plato </v>
<v Speaker 3>and people here.</v>

1992
01:50:14.311 --> 01:50:16.350
<v Speaker 3>There was a big part of life in ancient </v>
<v Speaker 3>Greece.</v>

1993
01:50:16.890 --> 01:50:19.370
<v Speaker 3>What was that and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1994
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:22.770
<v Speaker 3>the most commentaries ones where people </v>
<v Speaker 3>see it as Amnesia,</v>

1995
01:50:22.780 --> 01:50:23.850
<v Speaker 3>Mascara,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the flyer,</v>

1996
01:50:23.851 --> 01:50:28.851
<v Speaker 3>garrick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never found those particularly </v>

1997
01:50:28.851 --> 01:50:29.520
<v Speaker 3>plausible because whenever I've taken </v>
<v Speaker 3>flyer garrick where he wants so twice,</v>

1998
01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:32.200
<v Speaker 3>all it did was give me a headache and </v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1999
01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:35.010
<v Speaker 3>it's maybe they had different varieties </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it,</v>

2000
01:50:35.011 --> 01:50:38.760
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know anyone who's had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>totally amazing flyer,</v>

2001
01:50:38.761 --> 01:50:39.360
<v Speaker 3>garrick trip.</v>

2002
01:50:39.530 --> 01:50:41.330
<v Speaker 1>I've only spoken to people online that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

2003
01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:46.390
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only had it once and I felt the </v>

2004
01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:46.390
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't do anything for me.</v>

2005
01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:47.870
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it enhanced,</v>

2006
01:50:47.871 --> 01:50:52.871
<v Speaker 1>but I did it and then we did it for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple hours and it didn't seem to have </v>

2007
01:50:52.871 --> 01:50:56.741
<v Speaker 1>any effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we took psilocybin after that </v>

2008
01:50:56.741 --> 01:50:58.880
<v Speaker 1>and it had a huge effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just a monster trip.</v>

2009
01:50:59.210 --> 01:51:03.350
<v Speaker 1>And I wonder if it was some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>common atory experience.</v>

2010
01:51:03.620 --> 01:51:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was another thing that Mckenna </v>

2011
01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:11.311
<v Speaker 1>speculated about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it was variable genetically </v>

2012
01:51:11.311 --> 01:51:12.020
<v Speaker 1>variable seasonably variable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as geographically,</v>

2013
01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:17.460
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And whether it's transformed like </v>

2014
01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:20.820
<v Speaker 3>reindeer and transformed by the rain and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then where they drink the urine of </v>

2015
01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:23.110
<v Speaker 3>reindeer after the reindeer of eastern </v>
<v Speaker 3>yet and stuff.</v>

2016
01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:25.300
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the laps and people.</v>

2017
01:51:25.580 --> 01:51:26.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also the,</v>

2018
01:51:26.541 --> 01:51:31.541
<v Speaker 1>all the different connections to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Siberian shamans and that the whole </v>

2019
01:51:31.941 --> 01:51:36.941
<v Speaker 1>Christmas thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole connection to Christmas and </v>

2020
01:51:36.941 --> 01:51:37.400
<v Speaker 1>the Amanita miscarrying mushroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

2021
01:51:37.401 --> 01:51:42.401
<v Speaker 1>very bizarre that elves are connected </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this particular mushroom which is </v>

2022
01:51:42.681 --> 01:51:46.000
<v Speaker 1>connected with Christmas and gifts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

2023
01:51:46.070 --> 01:51:48.350
<v Speaker 1>symbiotic relationship to carnivorous </v>
<v Speaker 1>trees.</v>

2024
01:51:48.351 --> 01:51:49.960
<v Speaker 1>Like the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

2025
01:51:49.961 --> 01:51:50.720
<v Speaker 1>it's mysterious.</v>

2026
01:51:50.740 --> 01:51:55.740
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never found that area of </v>

2027
01:51:55.740 --> 01:51:55.740
<v Speaker 3>speculation particularly satisfying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if,</v>

2028
01:51:55.850 --> 01:52:00.850
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the evidence pointed towards Strip </v>

2029
01:52:00.850 --> 01:52:03.110
<v Speaker 3>area cubensis or psilocybe semi </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lanceolata United Liberty Cap or our </v>

2030
01:52:03.490 --> 01:52:08.490
<v Speaker 3>native psychedelic mushroom in England,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it might be more convincing.</v>

2031
01:52:09.770 --> 01:52:10.510
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2032
01:52:10.511 --> 01:52:14.650
<v Speaker 3>the fact is we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's really a matter of speculation.</v>

2033
01:52:14.690 --> 01:52:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it's like,</v>

2034
01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:17.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like heirloom tomatoes,</v>

2035
01:52:17.570 --> 01:52:19.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you eat an heirloom tomato,</v>

2036
01:52:19.341 --> 01:52:21.500
<v Speaker 1>they're so delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fantastic,</v>

2037
01:52:21.501 --> 01:52:22.410
<v Speaker 1>they're sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2038
01:52:22.450 --> 01:52:22.930
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2039
01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:28.300
<v Speaker 1>they're so rich and dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you can get one of these creepy </v>

2040
01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:29.120
<v Speaker 1>tomatoes that they grow that live like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last,</v>

2041
01:52:29.121 --> 01:52:34.121
<v Speaker 1>like a month on a shelf and they're pale</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're hard and they just taste </v>

2042
01:52:34.121 --> 01:52:34.121
<v Speaker 1>like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2043
01:52:34.121 --> 01:52:36.950
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing to them like they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look different,</v>

2044
01:52:36.951 --> 01:52:41.951
<v Speaker 1>they taste different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that somehow or another </v>

2045
01:52:41.951 --> 01:52:43.430
<v Speaker 1>happened to the am anita where it lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's psychedelic properties.</v>

2046
01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Unlikely because never been cultivated</v>

2047
01:52:46.380 --> 01:52:48.170
<v Speaker 3>and grows in the wild</v>

2048
01:52:48.510 --> 01:52:51.670
<v Speaker 1>would be maybe just the temperature </v>
<v Speaker 1>variations like that.</v>

2049
01:52:51.671 --> 01:52:56.671
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you have to have it in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly cold environment of Siberia </v>

2050
01:52:56.671 --> 01:52:58.270
<v Speaker 1>for it to be that it's geographically </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetically variable.</v>

2051
01:52:58.470 --> 01:53:01.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you said makes the most sense to me</v>

2052
01:53:01.181 --> 01:53:04.040
<v Speaker 3>that it was mixed with something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like Oscar,</v>

2053
01:53:04.150 --> 01:53:06.420
<v Speaker 3>if you just took one of the components </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the brew,</v>

2054
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.030
<v Speaker 3>if the historical data pointed worlds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this being there,</v>

2055
01:53:10.031 --> 01:53:10.660
<v Speaker 3>you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2056
01:53:10.661 --> 01:53:15.661
<v Speaker 3>this is what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually neither of the components </v>

2057
01:53:15.661 --> 01:53:18.901
<v Speaker 3>would work on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it may well have been that it was </v>

2058
01:53:18.901 --> 01:53:18.901
<v Speaker 3>part of a mixture</v>

2059
01:53:18.901 --> 01:53:20.440
<v Speaker 1>that does kind of make sense for Salma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2060
01:53:20.441 --> 01:53:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Because wasn't so much actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was described as some sort of</v>

2061
01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:26.860
<v Speaker 3>next year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so it was the Eleusinian mysteries.</v>

2062
01:53:27.220 --> 01:53:29.310
<v Speaker 1>You just don't know what the Eleusinian </v>
<v Speaker 1>mysteries are.</v>

2063
01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>

2064
01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Is there any speculation?</v>

2065
01:53:31.490 --> 01:53:36.490
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Graham Hancock have speculations of </v>

2066
01:53:36.490 --> 01:53:36.490
<v Speaker 3>course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>

2067
01:53:36.490 --> 01:53:41.210
<v Speaker 3>The ones I've seen would include opium </v>
<v Speaker 3>in cannabis as part of the mix.</v>

2068
01:53:41.970 --> 01:53:44.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cannabis was widely known in the ancient</v>

2069
01:53:44.051 --> 01:53:48.160
<v Speaker 3>world and actual hemp ropes were used </v>
<v Speaker 3>for thousands of years.</v>

2070
01:53:48.161 --> 01:53:49.420
<v Speaker 3>People were growing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hemp.</v>

2071
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:52.870
<v Speaker 3>Opium has been known for an awfully long</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2072
01:53:53.550 --> 01:53:58.120
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what else might have been in there?</v>

2073
01:53:58.121 --> 01:53:58.840
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>

2074
01:53:59.510 --> 01:54:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the other thing too.</v>

2075
01:54:00.791 --> 01:54:02.510
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consumption,</v>

2076
01:54:02.511 --> 01:54:05.270
<v Speaker 1>the eating of cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2077
01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:09.710
<v Speaker 1>eating of Hash has produced incredible </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experiences for people.</v>

2078
01:54:09.711 --> 01:54:13.520
<v Speaker 1>They've eaten large enough quantities </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's been very mushroom,</v>

2079
01:54:13.521 --> 01:54:13.940
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

2080
01:54:14.470 --> 01:54:19.470
<v Speaker 3>much more psychogenic when Easton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's traditional to take it by mouth</v>

2081
01:54:20.381 --> 01:54:23.020
<v Speaker 3>in India as well as to smoke it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2082
01:54:23.021 --> 01:54:28.021
<v Speaker 3>it's a normal thing that the festival of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy h o n I a major Hindu festival when</v>

2083
01:54:29.471 --> 01:54:34.471
<v Speaker 3>I was living in India,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was renting a wing of a crumbling </v>

2084
01:54:34.471 --> 01:54:36.910
<v Speaker 3>palace and hydropower from a family of </v>
<v Speaker 3>impoverished rogers.</v>

2085
01:54:38.710 --> 01:54:43.710
<v Speaker 3>And they were very respectable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they're impoverished and and on holy.</v>

2086
01:54:43.970 --> 01:54:47.290
<v Speaker 3>This festival day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Roger's wife,</v>

2087
01:54:47.291 --> 01:54:50.590
<v Speaker 3>the Ronnie came to me and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr Saab,</v>

2088
01:54:50.770 --> 01:54:52.720
<v Speaker 3>you must take our special drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>

2089
01:54:52.721 --> 01:54:54.760
<v Speaker 3>this is our special drink for holy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2090
01:54:54.860 --> 01:54:55.880
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>

2091
01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:56.500
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2092
01:54:56.501 --> 01:54:58.920
<v Speaker 3>I will tell you later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She says,</v>

2093
01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:02.040
<v Speaker 3>she's like the Joey Diaz of India,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those two up.</v>

2094
01:55:02.740 --> 01:55:04.690
<v Speaker 3>So I just drank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is bang.</v>

2095
01:55:04.691 --> 01:55:06.510
<v Speaker 3>Then she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have some more and say,</v>

2096
01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:11.500
<v Speaker 3>and various stoned with his bang this </v>
<v Speaker 3>drink cannabis containing drink.</v>

2097
01:55:11.890 --> 01:55:16.890
<v Speaker 3>And then everyone's sort of rushing </v>
<v Speaker 3>around throwing colored water at each </v>

2098
01:55:16.890 --> 01:55:20.580
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean this was a highly </v>

2099
01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:20.580
<v Speaker 3>respectable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative,</v>

2100
01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:24.350
<v Speaker 3>Brahmin family and this was just part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>their traditional way of life and,</v>

2101
01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:26.010
<v Speaker 3>and in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2102
01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:28.120
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the drunk form.</v>

2103
01:55:28.570 --> 01:55:30.490
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the liquid,</v>

2104
01:55:30.690 --> 01:55:32.110
<v Speaker 1>the edible form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2105
01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:34.260
<v Speaker 1>that's quite amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2106
01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:39.280
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often wonder how much different our </v>

2107
01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:41.781
<v Speaker 1>worldview would be if we had those sorts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of traditions here in America because </v>

2108
01:55:41.781 --> 01:55:46.161
<v Speaker 1>that's traditions and just sort of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural norms that we accept.</v>

2109
01:55:47.790 --> 01:55:52.790
<v Speaker 1>They shaped so much of our behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They shaped so much of how we view the </v>

2110
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:55.350
<v Speaker 1>world and so much of it is just based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>momentum.</v>

2111
01:55:55.351 --> 01:55:57.690
<v Speaker 1>It's just based on what did your </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandparents do,</v>

2112
01:55:57.691 --> 01:56:01.590
<v Speaker 1>what did they teach your parents and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what did your parents teach you and what</v>

2113
01:56:01.591 --> 01:56:04.380
<v Speaker 1>is the collective culture of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood?</v>

2114
01:56:04.381 --> 01:56:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Your community?</v>

2115
01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:06.630
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2116
01:56:08.170 --> 01:56:10.070
<v Speaker 3>One thing that's just occurred to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2117
01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:12.230
<v Speaker 3>there's two things I'd like to ask you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2118
01:56:12.231 --> 01:56:13.770
<v Speaker 3>one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me ask you something,</v>

2119
01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:18.920
<v Speaker 3>please does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know I've done a lot of research on </v>

2120
01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:21.351
<v Speaker 3>the sense of being stared at and I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this feeling that almost everyone's</v>

2121
01:56:21.361 --> 01:56:26.361
<v Speaker 3>experienced feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're being looked at your turn around </v>

2122
01:56:26.361 --> 01:56:29.660
<v Speaker 3>someone's staring at you or you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>stare at someone and make them turn </v>

2123
01:56:29.660 --> 01:56:33.411
<v Speaker 3>around and this is something which is </v>
<v Speaker 3>very widespread in the population.</v>

2124
01:56:35.010 --> 01:56:40.010
<v Speaker 3>There's been a kind of scientific to bu </v>
<v Speaker 3>for years about it because it ought not </v>

2125
01:56:40.010 --> 01:56:43.881
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If your mind is nothing but your brain </v>

2126
01:56:43.881 --> 01:56:45.830
<v Speaker 3>looking at someone shouldn't effect them</v>
<v Speaker 3>because everything is all inside your </v>

2127
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:46.860
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if when you look at somebody,</v>

2128
01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:50.220
<v Speaker 3>the image that you're seeing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>projected out as I suggested,</v>

2129
01:56:50.221 --> 01:56:55.221
<v Speaker 3>is that when I look at you now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you're my imagery view in </v>

2130
01:56:55.221 --> 01:56:57.930
<v Speaker 3>three dimensions and full color is </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside my head.</v>

2131
01:56:57.930 --> 01:57:02.930
<v Speaker 3>I think it's where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm projecting out my image </v>

2132
01:57:02.930 --> 01:57:06.731
<v Speaker 3>review.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything I'm seeing in this room is </v>

2133
01:57:06.731 --> 01:57:09.021
<v Speaker 3>where it seems to be projected out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Mind's extended beyond my brain </v>

2134
01:57:09.021 --> 01:57:11.370
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is how we experience it.</v>

2135
01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:13.860
<v Speaker 3>The official theories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all inside the head.</v>

2136
01:57:14.340 --> 01:57:19.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and because the official theory says </v>

2137
01:57:19.340 --> 01:57:22.551
<v Speaker 3>this is just a superstition and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't really tell them they're being </v>

2138
01:57:22.551 --> 01:57:25.611
<v Speaker 3>looked at the been almost no scientific </v>
<v Speaker 3>investigation till I took it up in the </v>

2139
01:57:25.611 --> 01:57:30.111
<v Speaker 3>19 eighties and now quite a number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people have done this research on the </v>

2140
01:57:30.111 --> 01:57:34.131
<v Speaker 3>sense of being stared at to find out if </v>
<v Speaker 3>people really can tell when they're </v>

2141
01:57:34.131 --> 01:57:34.970
<v Speaker 3>being stared out from behind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2142
01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:37.530
<v Speaker 3>I've done lots of experiments in </v>
<v Speaker 3>schools.</v>

2143
01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:40.950
<v Speaker 3>Kids are particularly sensitive to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>more so than grownups.</v>

2144
01:57:41.190 --> 01:57:42.210
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2145
01:57:42.450 --> 01:57:44.550
<v Speaker 3>And I then to find out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I thought,</v>

2146
01:57:44.551 --> 01:57:46.080
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done the experiments,</v>

2147
01:57:46.081 --> 01:57:47.520
<v Speaker 3>but who are the professionals?</v>

2148
01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:52.520
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my research assistant interviewed </v>

2149
01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:55.490
<v Speaker 3>security guards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>store detectives to drug squad at </v>

2150
01:57:55.490 --> 01:57:55.490
<v Speaker 3>Heathrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2151
01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:56.880
<v Speaker 3>police,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2152
01:57:56.881 --> 01:57:58.950
<v Speaker 3>and private detectives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2153
01:57:59.910 --> 01:58:04.910
<v Speaker 3>have you ever had this experience?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do people know when they're being </v>

2154
01:58:04.910 --> 01:58:07.761
<v Speaker 3>watched?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost everyone who watches others for </v>

2155
01:58:07.761 --> 01:58:07.761
<v Speaker 3>living such,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course they do.</v>

2156
01:58:07.761 --> 01:58:11.900
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're being trained to be a private </v>

2157
01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:11.900
<v Speaker 3>detective trained how to follow </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody,</v>

2158
01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:16.550
<v Speaker 3>you don't stare at their back because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're likely to turn around and catch </v>

2159
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:17.310
<v Speaker 3>your eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>

2160
01:58:17.311 --> 01:58:22.311
<v Speaker 3>I wrote about this in my book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sense of being stared at about this </v>

2161
01:58:22.311 --> 01:58:23.850
<v Speaker 3>research and about its implications for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the nature of our minds.</v>

2162
01:58:24.510 --> 01:58:29.510
<v Speaker 3>But I had recently somebody came to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a British defense research </v>

2163
01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:34.760
<v Speaker 3>laboratory and he said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got very interested in this,</v>

2164
01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:40.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the army because there's some </v>

2165
01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:40.200
<v Speaker 3>generals that worried that British </v>
<v Speaker 3>troops in Afghanistan.</v>

2166
01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:43.150
<v Speaker 3>And I was so laden down with kit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2167
01:58:43.270 --> 01:58:44.770
<v Speaker 3>gps systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2168
01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:47.560
<v Speaker 3>that whole body is covered with </v>
<v Speaker 3>electronic kit.</v>

2169
01:58:47.890 --> 01:58:51.310
<v Speaker 3>And they found that when they're so top </v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy carrying all this kit,</v>

2170
01:58:51.370 --> 01:58:55.060
<v Speaker 3>they have to look down at the ground all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time to avoid stumbling because it's</v>

2171
01:58:55.090 --> 01:59:00.090
<v Speaker 3>harder to walk with all this stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can easily be picked off by </v>

2172
01:59:00.090 --> 01:59:01.960
<v Speaker 3>guerrilla fighters behind rocks with </v>
<v Speaker 3>rifles.</v>

2173
01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:07.500
<v Speaker 3>And so what they said is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think we could train people in </v>

2174
01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:11.050
<v Speaker 3>threat awareness so they could actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>become more sensitive now in the martial</v>

2175
01:59:11.051 --> 01:59:16.051
<v Speaker 3>arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know some martial arts do have threat </v>

2176
01:59:16.051 --> 01:59:16.780
<v Speaker 3>awareness training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people went blindfolded,</v>

2177
01:59:16.810 --> 01:59:21.810
<v Speaker 3>have to become more aware of when </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody is looking at and we're going </v>

2178
01:59:21.810 --> 01:59:24.660
<v Speaker 3>to attack them from behind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my question to you,</v>

2179
01:59:24.661 --> 01:59:26.620
<v Speaker 3>since this is your world not mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2180
01:59:26.680 --> 01:59:31.680
<v Speaker 3>is how easy do you think it would be to </v>
<v Speaker 3>train people in threat awareness to </v>

2181
01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:33.340
<v Speaker 3>become more sensitive to knowing when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're being looked at?</v>

2182
01:59:34.090 --> 01:59:35.710
<v Speaker 1>That's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2183
01:59:36.050 --> 01:59:41.050
<v Speaker 1>I have never been a part of any martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>art that teaches people threat </v>

2184
01:59:41.050 --> 01:59:45.481
<v Speaker 1>awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the martial arts that I've been </v>

2185
01:59:45.481 --> 01:59:47.581
<v Speaker 1>involved in have all been about </v>
<v Speaker 1>acquiring very specific skills for hand </v>

2186
01:59:47.771 --> 01:59:51.610
<v Speaker 1>to hand combat against other trained </v>
<v Speaker 1>adversaries.</v>

2187
01:59:52.450 --> 01:59:57.450
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts that emphasize what you </v>

2188
01:59:57.450 --> 02:00:00.781
<v Speaker 1>call self defense type martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My issue with those guys and the </v>

2189
02:00:01.961 --> 02:00:05.050
<v Speaker 1>practices of self defense type martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts,</v>

2190
02:00:05.051 --> 02:00:10.051
<v Speaker 1>is that almost everything that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching would only work against a </v>

2191
02:00:10.051 --> 02:00:11.490
<v Speaker 1>non-trained opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2192
02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:13.210
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have all these ideas.</v>

2193
02:00:13.211 --> 02:00:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Like if a guy comes at you and throws a </v>
<v Speaker 1>punch,</v>

2194
02:00:15.131 --> 02:00:16.690
<v Speaker 1>you grab his wrist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he do this,</v>

2195
02:00:16.691 --> 02:00:19.510
<v Speaker 1>you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff only works on someone who</v>

2196
02:00:19.511 --> 02:00:24.511
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my thinking is always learn what </v>

2197
02:00:24.511 --> 02:00:28.540
<v Speaker 1>works on trained killers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weren't learn things that are undeniable</v>

2198
02:00:28.541 --> 02:00:30.250
<v Speaker 1>against the most skilled martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists.</v>

2199
02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Those are the things you want to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And through this practice of very,</v>

2200
02:00:34.900 --> 02:00:39.490
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to pull off techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult training,</v>

2201
02:00:39.730 --> 02:00:43.360
<v Speaker 1>pushing yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expanding the boundaries of your,</v>

2202
02:00:43.630 --> 02:00:44.200
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2203
02:00:44.201 --> 02:00:46.630
<v Speaker 1>your willingness to push your body and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind.</v>

2204
02:00:46.810 --> 02:00:49.000
<v Speaker 1>That's how you truly learn about </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

2205
02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:54.420
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and Milton Musashi had this </v>

2206
02:00:54.420 --> 02:00:57.691
<v Speaker 1>expression that he wrote in the book of </v>
<v Speaker 1>five rings that once you understand the </v>

2207
02:00:57.691 --> 02:01:02.641
<v Speaker 1>way broadly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will see it in all things in that </v>

2208
02:01:02.641 --> 02:01:05.820
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being in his world was the way of sword </v>

2209
02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:08.581
<v Speaker 1>fighting and that you would understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and this most incredible and </v>

2210
02:01:08.581 --> 02:01:12.621
<v Speaker 1>intense way and you would see the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of path of of the the True Path in </v>

2211
02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:18.840
<v Speaker 1>calligraphy and carpentry and all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of expressive art forms and that this is</v>

2212
02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:27.300
<v Speaker 1>my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the great benefit of martial </v>

2213
02:01:27.300 --> 02:01:30.631
<v Speaker 1>arts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the developing of your human </v>

2214
02:01:30.631 --> 02:01:32.380
<v Speaker 1>potential through this incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult endeavor and I've always found</v>

2215
02:01:32.381 --> 02:01:35.200
<v Speaker 1>that these guys who like blindfold and </v>
<v Speaker 1>look out for.</v>

2216
02:01:35.210 --> 02:01:40.210
<v Speaker 1>It's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a tremendous amount of bullshit </v>

2217
02:01:40.210 --> 02:01:40.210
<v Speaker 1>in martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of worst.</v>

2218
02:01:40.210 --> 02:01:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it?</v>

2219
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Much less so now because of the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement from 1993 on has been the </v>

2220
02:01:47.871 --> 02:01:52.871
<v Speaker 1>movement of mixed martial arts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because of these things called </v>

2221
02:01:52.871 --> 02:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate fighting championship and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mixed martial arts competitions and what</v>

2222
02:01:56.481 --> 02:02:01.481
<v Speaker 1>mixed martial arts competitions have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done is there was always these ideas at </v>

2223
02:02:01.481 --> 02:02:03.080
<v Speaker 1>different people at death touches and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sky could just.</v>

2224
02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:06.800
<v Speaker 1>He could hit you in a certain place and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uses ci and knock you back.</v>

2225
02:02:07.490 --> 02:02:10.490
<v Speaker 1>All those guys failed miserably in </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

2226
02:02:10.491 --> 02:02:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Not a single one was successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not One,</v>

2227
02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:17.180
<v Speaker 1>every single one was beaten down and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just showed there's no mysticism when it</v>

2228
02:02:17.181 --> 02:02:22.181
<v Speaker 1>comes to martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The true mysticism is the conquering of </v>

2229
02:02:22.181 --> 02:02:25.690
<v Speaker 1>your fears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to understand how to remain </v>

2230
02:02:25.690 --> 02:02:28.781
<v Speaker 1>calm during these incredibly stressful </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments of competition and through </v>

2231
02:02:29.150 --> 02:02:33.500
<v Speaker 1>repetition and intelligent development </v>
<v Speaker 1>of technique.</v>

2232
02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:38.800
<v Speaker 1>That's what real martial arts training </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaches people and that any divine </v>

2233
02:02:39.981 --> 02:02:43.760
<v Speaker 1>feeling you get from a true master,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would get from a pianist as well.</v>

2234
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:46.640
<v Speaker 1>You would get from a true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a brilliant painter.</v>

2235
02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:47.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

2236
02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:48.790
<v Speaker 1>you've met Alex Grey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2237
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant painter,</v>

2238
02:02:50.421 --> 02:02:52.700
<v Speaker 1>but you know how that feeling you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're around him,</v>

2239
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:54.560
<v Speaker 1>he's a master.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have any.</v>

2240
02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has this sense of this like very </v>

2241
02:02:59.600 --> 02:02:59.600
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2242
02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:01.430
<v Speaker 1>you're in the presence of a very unique </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

2243
02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:06.850
<v Speaker 1>And I have experienced that same feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I've been around martial artists </v>

2244
02:03:06.850 --> 02:03:07.700
<v Speaker 1>and that same feeling when I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

2245
02:03:07.701 --> 02:03:08.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just great minds,</v>

2246
02:03:08.841 --> 02:03:13.841
<v Speaker 1>great thinkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's what you do is you recognize </v>

2247
02:03:13.841 --> 02:03:15.590
<v Speaker 1>you're recognizing greatness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're recognizing what Musashi said.</v>

2248
02:03:15.650 --> 02:03:18.080
<v Speaker 1>You're recognizing someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>understands the way broadly.</v>

2249
02:03:18.770 --> 02:03:19.450
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2250
02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:25.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in a lot of these ideas </v>

2251
02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:26.030
<v Speaker 1>of self defense training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2252
02:03:26.031 --> 02:03:31.031
<v Speaker 1>I think there's certain techniques that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are very effective for soldiers like </v>

2253
02:03:31.611 --> 02:03:34.430
<v Speaker 1>disarmament techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how to take someone's pistol away,</v>

2254
02:03:34.670 --> 02:03:35.510
<v Speaker 1>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2255
02:03:35.540 --> 02:03:40.100
<v Speaker 1>how to defend against a knife attack </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's very technique oriented.</v>

2256
02:03:40.230 --> 02:03:45.230
<v Speaker 1>A Krav Maga incorporates a lot of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an Israeli martial art that </v>

2257
02:03:45.230 --> 02:03:46.790
<v Speaker 1>takes a lot of the best aspects of many </v>
<v Speaker 1>different martial arts.</v>

2258
02:03:46.791 --> 02:03:47.510
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2259
02:03:47.511 --> 02:03:49.190
<v Speaker 1>they train that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2260
02:03:49.250 --> 02:03:54.250
<v Speaker 1>there are definitely real techniques </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved that have been taught to </v>

2261
02:03:54.250 --> 02:03:56.660
<v Speaker 1>soldiers and by soldiers when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to disarmament,</v>

2262
02:03:56.840 --> 02:04:00.860
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to how to deal with a hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hand combat in certain situations.</v>

2263
02:04:01.070 --> 02:04:06.070
<v Speaker 1>But I think overall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the quote unquote selfdefence </v>

2264
02:04:06.070 --> 02:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>styles are bullshit and a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2265
02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:09.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna blindfold.</v>

2266
02:04:09.951 --> 02:04:12.180
<v Speaker 1>You and people are going to kick you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I blindfold you,</v>

2267
02:04:12.210 --> 02:04:13.730
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

2268
02:04:13.731 --> 02:04:15.900
<v Speaker 1>If I blindfold you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a person alive is gonna.</v>

2269
02:04:15.930 --> 02:04:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Stop me from putting him in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I blindfold them,</v>

2270
02:04:18.210 --> 02:04:22.010
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to know what's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that you could help is if</v>

2271
02:04:22.011 --> 02:04:24.800
<v Speaker 1>you have control of a body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're blindfolded,</v>

2272
02:04:24.801 --> 02:04:27.040
<v Speaker 1>you can grapple very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I could.</v>

2273
02:04:27.230 --> 02:04:29.360
<v Speaker 1>I've grappled with my eyes closed </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

2274
02:04:29.630 --> 02:04:34.190
<v Speaker 1>but the reason being is that if I am </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding onto your waist,</v>

2275
02:04:34.191 --> 02:04:38.100
<v Speaker 1>if I have a hold of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know where everything else is just</v>

2276
02:04:38.110 --> 02:04:39.960
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pattern thing.</v>

2277
02:04:39.961 --> 02:04:42.630
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a pattern recognition.</v>

2278
02:04:42.650 --> 02:04:44.760
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been in that position so many times</v>

2279
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.400
<v Speaker 3>that I could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know where your neck is going to be.</v>

2280
02:04:47.401 --> 02:04:49.920
<v Speaker 3>I know where your arm's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I isolate your shoulder,</v>

2281
02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:55.100
<v Speaker 3>I know where your wrist is going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know how to isolate those joints </v>

2282
02:04:55.100 --> 02:04:55.950
<v Speaker 3>without having to look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in that sense,</v>

2283
02:04:56.130 --> 02:04:59.960
<v Speaker 3>you could do some things blindfolded but</v>
<v Speaker 3>not striking distance.</v>

2284
02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:05.460
<v Speaker 3>I think the threat awareness stuff was </v>
<v Speaker 3>not so much that you could fight </v>

2285
02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:09.171
<v Speaker 3>blindfolded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but training people to feel from which </v>

2286
02:05:09.171 --> 02:05:12.891
<v Speaker 3>direction someone was looking at behind </v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to be plausible.</v>

2287
02:05:12.970 --> 02:05:14.900
<v Speaker 3>You could train that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2288
02:05:15.200 --> 02:05:16.950
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not my world.</v>

2289
02:05:16.951 --> 02:05:21.520
<v Speaker 3>And so really the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is an issue that if,</v>

2290
02:05:21.570 --> 02:05:24.270
<v Speaker 3>if they ask my advice on experimental </v>
<v Speaker 3>design,</v>

2291
02:05:24.271 --> 02:05:29.271
<v Speaker 3>but I do for threat awareness is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have say take a five story building </v>

2292
02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:33.120
<v Speaker 3>on one of the five stories selected at </v>
<v Speaker 3>random,</v>

2293
02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:35.220
<v Speaker 3>you'd have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do it at night,</v>

2294
02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:40.400
<v Speaker 3>have guys hidden behind in officers that</v>
<v Speaker 3>can look at people walking along </v>

2295
02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:40.400
<v Speaker 3>corridors.</v>

2296
02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:44.370
<v Speaker 3>You'd have CCTV cameras and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching them on that floor,</v>

2297
02:05:45.330 --> 02:05:50.330
<v Speaker 3>but on the other four floors you'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>switch off the TV cameras and been able </v>

2298
02:05:50.330 --> 02:05:53.781
<v Speaker 3>to do that and you'd have somebody walk </v>
<v Speaker 3>through each floor of this building and </v>

2299
02:05:53.781 --> 02:05:57.861
<v Speaker 3>then they'd have to say which one they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were being watched in and one out of </v>

2300
02:05:57.861 --> 02:05:59.180
<v Speaker 3>five if they got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2301
02:05:59.220 --> 02:06:04.220
<v Speaker 3>lots of times there's a one in five </v>
<v Speaker 3>chance of getting it right just by </v>

2302
02:06:04.220 --> 02:06:07.641
<v Speaker 3>guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you find results above score </v>

2303
02:06:07.641 --> 02:06:07.641
<v Speaker 3>above chance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could then say,</v>

2304
02:06:07.641 --> 02:06:12.561
<v Speaker 3>well these people are actually detecting</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the potential threats and you might</v>

2305
02:06:12.841 --> 02:06:16.710
<v Speaker 3>be able to train people to get better at</v>
<v Speaker 3>it than what you did.</v>

2306
02:06:17.100 --> 02:06:18.630
<v Speaker 3>Your study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

2307
02:06:18.870 --> 02:06:22.710
<v Speaker 3>you had people sit down and then they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would.</v>

2308
02:06:22.711 --> 02:06:25.620
<v Speaker 3>They hit a button when they felt someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at them.</v>

2309
02:06:26.420 --> 02:06:26.710
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2310
02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:28.170
<v Speaker 3>What happened was this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2311
02:06:28.171 --> 02:06:29.580
<v Speaker 3>there's two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's two methods.</v>

2312
02:06:29.581 --> 02:06:34.581
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one method I've mainly used is the </v>

2313
02:06:34.581 --> 02:06:37.191
<v Speaker 3>simplest one that you can do with kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>in schools and one person's blind folded</v>

2314
02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:40.390
<v Speaker 3>with an airline star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blindfold,</v>

2315
02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:41.910
<v Speaker 3>cut up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>peripheral vision.</v>

2316
02:06:42.210 --> 02:06:46.380
<v Speaker 3>The other person sits behind them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then in random series of trials,</v>

2317
02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:51.810
<v Speaker 3>the simplest message is tossing a coin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have random sheets of instructions</v>

2318
02:06:51.811 --> 02:06:53.940
<v Speaker 3>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd look or you don't look,</v>

2319
02:06:53.941 --> 02:06:58.941
<v Speaker 3>so if it's a look looking trial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the person behind stairs at the back of </v>

2320
02:06:58.941 --> 02:07:00.030
<v Speaker 3>their neck and thinks about them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's not,</v>

2321
02:07:00.060 --> 02:07:05.060
<v Speaker 3>and then after 10 seconds it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>click and so they hear a click or a </v>

2322
02:07:05.060 --> 02:07:08.070
<v Speaker 3>beep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know the trials began and within 10</v>

2323
02:07:08.071 --> 02:07:10.110
<v Speaker 3>seconds they have to say looking or not </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking,</v>

2324
02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:12.930
<v Speaker 3>are you being looked at or not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes or no.</v>

2325
02:07:12.980 --> 02:07:17.980
<v Speaker 3>It's right or wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the next trial at random would </v>

2326
02:07:17.980 --> 02:07:18.510
<v Speaker 3>be looking or not looking and if it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not looking,</v>

2327
02:07:18.511 --> 02:07:19.140
<v Speaker 3>they look away.</v>

2328
02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:22.320
<v Speaker 3>And think of something else and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to guess.</v>

2329
02:07:22.590 --> 02:07:25.320
<v Speaker 3>We usually do 20 of these or any 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>seconds each,</v>

2330
02:07:25.321 --> 02:07:30.321
<v Speaker 3>so it doesn't take long and this gives </v>
<v Speaker 3>results where most people score above </v>

2331
02:07:30.321 --> 02:07:31.500
<v Speaker 3>chance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 percent chance,</v>

2332
02:07:31.501 --> 02:07:34.590
<v Speaker 3>but many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you take an average,</v>

2333
02:07:34.591 --> 02:07:38.440
<v Speaker 3>it comes to around 55 to 60 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's not a big effect,</v>

2334
02:07:38.441 --> 02:07:43.441
<v Speaker 3>but over hundreds of thousands of trials</v>
<v Speaker 3>that showed something's going on </v>

2335
02:07:43.441 --> 02:07:47.010
<v Speaker 3>statistically significant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very significant and if you do it </v>

2336
02:07:47.010 --> 02:07:50.281
<v Speaker 3>through windows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were to eliminate smell or sound or one </v>

2337
02:07:50.281 --> 02:07:51.520
<v Speaker 3>way mirrors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It still works.</v>

2338
02:07:52.030 --> 02:07:57.030
<v Speaker 3>And in Amsterdam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this has been running in the Science </v>

2339
02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:59.020
<v Speaker 3>Museum for 20 years and it's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>biggest experiments ever conducted.</v>

2340
02:07:59.470 --> 02:08:04.470
<v Speaker 3>And the interesting hinders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The overall results were extremely </v>

2341
02:08:04.470 --> 02:08:05.140
<v Speaker 3>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>highly significant statistically,</v>

2342
02:08:05.590 --> 02:08:08.620
<v Speaker 3>but what they've shown is what I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>already found in my own experience.</v>

2343
02:08:08.621 --> 02:08:11.950
<v Speaker 3>The most sensitive subjects are children</v>
<v Speaker 3>under the age of nine.</v>

2344
02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.340
<v Speaker 3>And I think most of versus when we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>older,</v>

2345
02:08:15.341 --> 02:08:17.620
<v Speaker 3>we go out into the world is crowded </v>
<v Speaker 3>streets.</v>

2346
02:08:17.621 --> 02:08:20.260
<v Speaker 3>Lots of people look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we desensitize ourselves,</v>

2347
02:08:20.261 --> 02:08:23.530
<v Speaker 3>but children are much more sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that case,</v>

2348
02:08:24.010 --> 02:08:29.010
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if really attractive woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be the worst at it because really </v>

2349
02:08:29.010 --> 02:08:33.181
<v Speaker 3>attractive women are used to putting on </v>
<v Speaker 3>blindfolds and walking past people </v>

2350
02:08:33.181 --> 02:08:33.400
<v Speaker 3>staring at them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2351
02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:38.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a slight difference in those </v>

2352
02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:40.171
<v Speaker 3>who've experienced this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More women than men have experienced </v>

2353
02:08:40.171 --> 02:08:42.961
<v Speaker 3>being stared at and do service and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>men than women have experienced turning </v>

2354
02:08:42.961 --> 02:08:44.900
<v Speaker 3>it others and looking at others,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making them turnaround manner.</v>

2355
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:46.240
<v Speaker 3>Liras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2356
02:08:46.450 --> 02:08:48.730
<v Speaker 3>So attractive women do have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you say,</v>

2357
02:08:48.731 --> 02:08:50.100
<v Speaker 3>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2358
02:08:50.710 --> 02:08:53.620
<v Speaker 3>they have to learn to avoid meeting </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's gaze.</v>

2359
02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:58.030
<v Speaker 3>Photograph American girl in Italy from </v>
<v Speaker 3>1951.</v>

2360
02:08:58.180 --> 02:09:01.120
<v Speaker 3>It's a fascinating photograph.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a famous photograph.</v>

2361
02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:05.410
<v Speaker 3>This American woman is walking down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>street next to these animals,</v>

2362
02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:09.700
<v Speaker 3>these men that are grabbing their crotch</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're there stare and she has this</v>

2363
02:09:09.701 --> 02:09:14.701
<v Speaker 3>look on her face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's not looking at anyone in </v>

2364
02:09:14.701 --> 02:09:14.701
<v Speaker 3>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's just going straight forward.</v>

2365
02:09:14.701 --> 02:09:18.750
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that woman would be like a perfect </v>

2366
02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:22.441
<v Speaker 3>candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone who's like to blocking off all </v>

2367
02:09:22.441 --> 02:09:24.400
<v Speaker 3>these leering yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freaks.</v>

2368
02:09:25.150 --> 02:09:26.920
<v Speaker 3>They're staring at her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you,</v>

2369
02:09:26.921 --> 02:09:31.921
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was there anyone that you'd ever done </v>

2370
02:09:31.921 --> 02:09:31.921
<v Speaker 3>that study on that was like really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>at it?</v>

2371
02:09:31.921 --> 02:09:33.250
<v Speaker 3>Like 75 percent?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eighty percent.</v>

2372
02:09:33.430 --> 02:09:34.450
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>

2373
02:09:34.451 --> 02:09:35.440
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent.</v>

2374
02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:37.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone got 100 percent.</v>

2375
02:09:37.151 --> 02:09:38.980
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was my oldest son,</v>

2376
02:09:38.990 --> 02:09:40.570
<v Speaker 3>Merlin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Merlin.</v>

2377
02:09:40.700 --> 02:09:42.460
<v Speaker 3>The wizard when Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Merlin?</v>

2378
02:09:42.550 --> 02:09:43.360
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ridiculous.</v>

2379
02:09:44.650 --> 02:09:47.920
<v Speaker 3>He's a scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a phd at the moment.</v>

2380
02:09:47.921 --> 02:09:50.440
<v Speaker 3>And in tropical Dr Merlin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2381
02:09:50.680 --> 02:09:53.680
<v Speaker 3>In the younger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my youngest son who's 24 is a musician.</v>

2382
02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:55.570
<v Speaker 3>It's 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2383
02:09:55.571 --> 02:09:58.930
<v Speaker 3>When melon was four years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did this experiment with him,</v>

2384
02:09:59.230 --> 02:10:00.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blindfolds.</v>

2385
02:10:00.610 --> 02:10:01.660
<v Speaker 3>Him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's sitting there.</v>

2386
02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:02.320
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2387
02:10:02.350 --> 02:10:03.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to look at you some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2388
02:10:04.150 --> 02:10:05.530
<v Speaker 3>The rest of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>

2389
02:10:05.620 --> 02:10:10.620
<v Speaker 3>And each time you hear this click,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to say if you think you're </v>

2390
02:10:10.620 --> 02:10:11.560
<v Speaker 3>being looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got it right 100 percent of the time.</v>

2391
02:10:11.670 --> 02:10:13.780
<v Speaker 3>So I couldn't believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't cheating.</v>

2392
02:10:13.781 --> 02:10:15.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean he didn't know about cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was four.</v>

2393
02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:17.350
<v Speaker 3>Four.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2394
02:10:17.380 --> 02:10:20.030
<v Speaker 3>And so I did it again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his brilliance,</v>

2395
02:10:20.031 --> 02:10:20.830
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Daddy,</v>

2396
02:10:21.130 --> 02:10:23.170
<v Speaker 3>you've done to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we do it the other way round?</v>

2397
02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:27.310
<v Speaker 3>Can you tell when I'm looking at you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>

2398
02:10:27.311 --> 02:10:28.390
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll try that.</v>

2399
02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:33.600
<v Speaker 3>And we did it the other way around and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of 20 trials I got sorta 11 out of </v>

2400
02:10:34.521 --> 02:10:35.900
<v Speaker 3>20.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was above chance,</v>

2401
02:10:35.901 --> 02:10:39.380
<v Speaker 3>but I was wrong quite lots of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he got the idea,</v>

2402
02:10:39.980 --> 02:10:44.980
<v Speaker 3>well you can be wrong and I was wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sort of changed his mind and after </v>

2403
02:10:45.171 --> 02:10:47.240
<v Speaker 3>that when they test him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was still fairly high,</v>

2404
02:10:47.241 --> 02:10:49.820
<v Speaker 3>75 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he never got 100 percent again.</v>

2405
02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:53.510
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what were the numbers like?</v>

2406
02:10:53.511 --> 02:10:58.511
<v Speaker 3>How many times did you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the first two times were 20 times </v>

2407
02:10:58.511 --> 02:11:02.200
<v Speaker 3>20.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So normally I do these trials with 20 </v>

2408
02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:05.021
<v Speaker 3>trials and most people would get say 11 </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of 20 and he was getting $20 </v>

2409
02:11:05.170 --> 02:11:09.560
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is hugely significant to course.</v>

2410
02:11:09.790 --> 02:11:11.120
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

2411
02:11:11.300 --> 02:11:12.950
<v Speaker 3>the thing is that young children are </v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

2412
02:11:12.951 --> 02:11:16.700
<v Speaker 3>very sensitive to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I hold yours forensics,</v>

2413
02:11:16.900 --> 02:11:18.650
<v Speaker 3>the younger ones you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check it out.</v>

2414
02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:25.000
<v Speaker 3>I've already got my plans for tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go on the way home and pick</v>

2415
02:11:25.010 --> 02:11:26.600
<v Speaker 3>up some blindfolds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2416
02:11:26.601 --> 02:11:27.190
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2417
02:11:27.290 --> 02:11:29.660
<v Speaker 3>that's brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really interesting.</v>

2418
02:11:29.661 --> 02:11:34.661
<v Speaker 3>The idea that you introduced the </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility of failure and then he was </v>

2419
02:11:34.661 --> 02:11:34.700
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2420
02:11:34.701 --> 02:11:37.400
<v Speaker 3>and then he doubt crept in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

2421
02:11:37.401 --> 02:11:39.660
<v Speaker 3>and the problem with the kinds of tests </v>
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>

2422
02:11:39.690 --> 02:11:42.260
<v Speaker 3>I do tests on the sense of being stared </v>
<v Speaker 3>at telepathy.</v>

2423
02:11:42.260 --> 02:11:44.360
<v Speaker 3>I've joked doing a lot on telephone </v>
<v Speaker 3>telepathy.</v>

2424
02:11:44.510 --> 02:11:49.510
<v Speaker 3>Can you tell who's calling?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the problem with these kinds of </v>

2425
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:53.861
<v Speaker 3>experiments is that you have to set them</v>
<v Speaker 3>up so that people could be right or </v>

2426
02:11:53.861 --> 02:11:57.590
<v Speaker 3>wrong and Pete know very few people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>right all the time,</v>

2427
02:11:57.620 --> 02:12:01.070
<v Speaker 3>but as soon as doubt creeps in the mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>and fierce people think,</v>

2428
02:12:01.550 --> 02:12:06.550
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I guess one way last time it's </v>

2429
02:12:06.550 --> 02:12:07.340
<v Speaker 3>statistically I shouldn't be the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>way this time.</v>

2430
02:12:07.341 --> 02:12:08.570
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they start,</v>

2431
02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:11.510
<v Speaker 3>as soon as that kind of thing goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people lose it.</v>

2432
02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:13.700
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is life in a nutshell,</v>

2433
02:12:13.701 --> 02:12:15.830
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like as soon as you have doubt,</v>

2434
02:12:16.010 --> 02:12:21.010
<v Speaker 3>your whole world is just a mess and </v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately these experiments that I </v>

2435
02:12:21.010 --> 02:12:25.721
<v Speaker 3>do introduce doubt into the vet because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to do statistical experiments </v>

2436
02:12:25.941 --> 02:12:30.941
<v Speaker 3>that have incredible to skeptics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a kind of skepticism built </v>

2437
02:12:30.941 --> 02:12:33.670
<v Speaker 3>into the experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't yet found a way of doing this.</v>

2438
02:12:33.730 --> 02:12:38.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The holy grail would be to find ways of </v>

2439
02:12:38.730 --> 02:12:41.501
<v Speaker 3>doing these tests where people don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>realize that they're being tested and </v>

2440
02:12:41.501 --> 02:12:42.740
<v Speaker 3>that could be doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could that be done though?</v>

2441
02:12:44.900 --> 02:12:49.900
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking of one kind of test that </v>

2442
02:12:49.900 --> 02:12:52.271
<v Speaker 3>will be incorporated in a video game </v>
<v Speaker 3>where say you have to choose between </v>

2443
02:12:52.851 --> 02:12:55.910
<v Speaker 3>going through one door,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another door and one door.</v>

2444
02:12:55.911 --> 02:12:57.470
<v Speaker 3>You go through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely awful.</v>

2445
02:12:57.471 --> 02:13:01.190
<v Speaker 3>In the other door you escape and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>onto sort of next stage.</v>

2446
02:13:02.690 --> 02:13:07.690
<v Speaker 3>You could have it where when people </v>
<v Speaker 3>choose it hasn't been decided.</v>

2447
02:13:08.430 --> 02:13:13.430
<v Speaker 3>You'd have a random event thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>would determine which door you go </v>

2448
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:14.540
<v Speaker 3>through after you've made the choice to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go through it.</v>

2449
02:13:15.290 --> 02:13:17.870
<v Speaker 3>This is then called presettlement or pre</v>
<v Speaker 3>cognition.</v>

2450
02:13:17.871 --> 02:13:22.871
<v Speaker 3>It's like knowing the future and so if </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were right more often than they </v>

2451
02:13:22.871 --> 02:13:27.791
<v Speaker 3>were wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd know because it purely chance it </v>

2452
02:13:27.791 --> 02:13:29.600
<v Speaker 3>should be 50 slash 50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If some people were coming out 60,</v>

2453
02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:32.490
<v Speaker 3>40,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't say this is a psychological</v>

2454
02:13:32.491 --> 02:13:33.930
<v Speaker 3>test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would say,</v>

2455
02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:38.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how lucky are you and can you be </v>

2456
02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:39.870
<v Speaker 3>consistently lucky in this?</v>

2457
02:13:40.060 --> 02:13:43.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it would be more like luck.</v>

2458
02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:45.990
<v Speaker 3>It would still involve now them to duck </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you might start thinking,</v>

2459
02:13:45.991 --> 02:13:47.310
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not very lucky today.</v>

2460
02:13:47.690 --> 02:13:49.710
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would be,</v>

2461
02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:51.840
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be framed as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>

2462
02:13:52.060 --> 02:13:53.730
<v Speaker 3>a scientific experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will.</v>

2463
02:13:53.731 --> 02:13:57.090
<v Speaker 3>We've framed as a way of training your </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to be lucky.</v>

2464
02:13:57.640 --> 02:13:59.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>

2465
02:13:59.670 --> 02:14:02.130
<v Speaker 3>Training your ability to be lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2466
02:14:02.190 --> 02:14:07.190
<v Speaker 3>Intuition is a very strange thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>some people believe in it and some </v>

2467
02:14:07.190 --> 02:14:10.611
<v Speaker 3>people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people believe that you make good </v>

2468
02:14:10.611 --> 02:14:10.611
<v Speaker 3>choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

2469
02:14:10.611 --> 02:14:13.911
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll hear people that are successful </v>

2470
02:14:13.911 --> 02:14:13.911
<v Speaker 3>that are confident and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2471
02:14:13.911 --> 02:14:13.911
<v Speaker 3>I've always been lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got great instincts,</v>

2472
02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:17.100
<v Speaker 3>but that there is something to </v>
<v Speaker 3>instincts.</v>

2473
02:14:17.101 --> 02:14:22.101
<v Speaker 3>There's something to trusting certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>folks and not trusting certain folks </v>

2474
02:14:22.101 --> 02:14:24.570
<v Speaker 3>based on just an immediately the feeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get when you meet them.</v>

2475
02:14:25.020 --> 02:14:26.520
<v Speaker 3>Some things just don't seem bright.</v>

2476
02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:29.010
<v Speaker 3>And I think a lot of it is probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>pattern recognition.</v>

2477
02:14:29.310 --> 02:14:30.210
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2478
02:14:30.211 --> 02:14:32.670
<v Speaker 3>I've been around guys like this before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what they're about.</v>

2479
02:14:32.671 --> 02:14:34.560
<v Speaker 3>This guy's just got a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit and um,</v>

2480
02:14:34.561 --> 02:14:36.330
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get Outta here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2481
02:14:36.830 --> 02:14:41.830
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the intuition just means direct </v>

2482
02:14:41.830 --> 02:14:42.030
<v Speaker 3>knowing and some of it can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>telepathic.</v>

2483
02:14:42.031 --> 02:14:44.400
<v Speaker 3>Some of it can be unconscious pattern </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognition.</v>

2484
02:14:44.401 --> 02:14:47.610
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of components,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some of them,</v>

2485
02:14:47.611 --> 02:14:50.370
<v Speaker 3>I think what you could call Paris </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological,</v>

2486
02:14:50.371 --> 02:14:55.371
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling the future or picking up things </v>

2487
02:14:55.371 --> 02:14:56.200
<v Speaker 3>telepathically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2488
02:14:57.150 --> 02:15:01.290
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these recent experiments of daryl bem at</v>

2489
02:15:01.291 --> 02:15:06.291
<v Speaker 3>cornell on feeding the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've looked into </v>

2490
02:15:06.291 --> 02:15:07.860
<v Speaker 3>those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me just keep an eye on the time.</v>

2491
02:15:08.030 --> 02:15:09.810
<v Speaker 3>It's 1:00.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2492
02:15:09.811 --> 02:15:14.010
<v Speaker 3>Well you have a pocket watch old school </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at you with a chain on it.</v>

2493
02:15:14.070 --> 02:15:15.420
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2494
02:15:15.450 --> 02:15:17.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't like wearing wristwatches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me take that out.</v>

2495
02:15:17.800 --> 02:15:19.860
<v Speaker 3>How do you have connected to your belt </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something?</v>

2496
02:15:19.861 --> 02:15:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2497
02:15:21.260 --> 02:15:23.880
<v Speaker 3>Savor the trousers is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2498
02:15:23.940 --> 02:15:27.240
<v Speaker 3>Pretty Slick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So where's the park at watch?</v>

2499
02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:28.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2500
02:15:28.651 --> 02:15:31.530
<v Speaker 3>you need to know the time sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watches.</v>

2501
02:15:31.970 --> 02:15:35.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't like being manacled to time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm cold.</v>

2502
02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:38.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You carry a cell phone?</v>

2503
02:15:38.410 --> 02:15:39.380
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2504
02:15:39.390 --> 02:15:40.590
<v Speaker 3>you're one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2505
02:15:40.950 --> 02:15:44.340
<v Speaker 3>How come?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate being interrupted.</v>

2506
02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:47.310
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the phone at home.</v>

2507
02:15:47.311 --> 02:15:49.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't use phones much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might use email.</v>

2508
02:15:49.801 --> 02:15:52.290
<v Speaker 3>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can always just shut your phone off.</v>

2509
02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:54.270
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'd rather not have it.</v>

2510
02:15:54.300 --> 02:15:59.300
<v Speaker 3>I do have one because I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing experiments on cell phones on </v>

2511
02:15:59.300 --> 02:16:01.230
<v Speaker 3>telephone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Telepathy is my friend Steve was talking</v>

2512
02:16:01.231 --> 02:16:02.560
<v Speaker 3>about from London.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing.</v>

2513
02:16:02.580 --> 02:16:04.230
<v Speaker 3>Hates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hates having a phone drive.</v>

2514
02:16:04.231 --> 02:16:05.700
<v Speaker 3>His wife crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2515
02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:08.700
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a good reason for not having</v>
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>

2516
02:16:08.700 --> 02:16:13.700
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be interrupted all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and if I go for a walk or if I'm </v>

2517
02:16:13.981 --> 02:16:18.981
<v Speaker 3>working or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I find it really annoying if the </v>

2518
02:16:18.981 --> 02:16:18.981
<v Speaker 3>phone rings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean anyway,</v>

2519
02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:24.200
<v Speaker 3>the pocket watch means I can know the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and I need to know I'm going to </v>

2520
02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:24.330
<v Speaker 3>have to go fairly soon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not quite yet.</v>

2521
02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:29.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where were we to let potential efficacy </v>

2522
02:16:31.631 --> 02:16:32.760
<v Speaker 3>tests?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2523
02:16:33.130 --> 02:16:38.130
<v Speaker 3>and intuition sometimes it's Interior </v>
<v Speaker 3>Daryl bams experiments.</v>

2524
02:16:39.070 --> 02:16:44.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm a very simple and it's called </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling the future and does this </v>

2525
02:16:45.131 --> 02:16:50.131
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon that dean raging at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Institute of noetic sciences has done a </v>

2526
02:16:50.131 --> 02:16:53.881
<v Speaker 3>lot of research on where it turns out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we can respond a few seconds before</v>

2527
02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:59.160
<v Speaker 3>an emotionally arousing event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our body starts preparing for it before </v>

2528
02:16:59.160 --> 02:17:03.151
<v Speaker 3>it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This would be very relevant to fast </v>

2529
02:17:03.151 --> 02:17:03.151
<v Speaker 3>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ping Pong,</v>

2530
02:17:03.151 --> 02:17:03.151
<v Speaker 3>tennis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cricket,</v>

2531
02:17:03.340 --> 02:17:06.430
<v Speaker 3>downhill skiing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and probably martial arts as well.</v>

2532
02:17:06.750 --> 02:17:11.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this research seems to me pretty </v>

2533
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:11.750
<v Speaker 3>convincing.</v>

2534
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:16.170
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been a subject in some of these </v>

2535
02:17:16.170 --> 02:17:17.881
<v Speaker 3>experiments myself and the dean raging </v>
<v Speaker 3>rational.</v>

2536
02:17:17.981 --> 02:17:22.981
<v Speaker 3>It is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sit there in front of a computer </v>

2537
02:17:22.981 --> 02:17:26.731
<v Speaker 3>screen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're wearing electrodes that measure </v>

2538
02:17:26.731 --> 02:17:26.731
<v Speaker 3>emotional arousal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2539
02:17:26.731 --> 02:17:30.280
<v Speaker 3>adrenaline causes sweating and emotional</v>
<v Speaker 3>arousal like a lie detector.</v>

2540
02:17:30.700 --> 02:17:34.570
<v Speaker 3>So it's a standard way of measuring </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotional arousal when you read,</v>

2541
02:17:34.571 --> 02:17:38.530
<v Speaker 3>you press a button and 10 seconds later </v>
<v Speaker 3>a picture appears on the screen.</v>

2542
02:17:38.770 --> 02:17:40.830
<v Speaker 3>Most of the pictures are neutral,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2543
02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:42.160
<v Speaker 3>landscapes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2544
02:17:42.161 --> 02:17:46.150
<v Speaker 3>bold of flyers or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm vaguely pleasant.</v>

2545
02:17:46.390 --> 02:17:51.390
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are scenes that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotionally arousing hardcore </v>

2546
02:17:51.390 --> 02:17:52.840
<v Speaker 3>pornography or scenes of extreme </v>
<v Speaker 3>violence.</v>

2547
02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:55.150
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost everybody,</v>

2548
02:17:55.151 --> 02:18:00.151
<v Speaker 3>when they see hardcore pornography or </v>
<v Speaker 3>scenes that fondness who's emotionally </v>

2549
02:18:00.151 --> 02:18:00.220
<v Speaker 3>aroused,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if they don't want to be,</v>

2550
02:18:00.221 --> 02:18:01.360
<v Speaker 3>they they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are,</v>

2551
02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:05.680
<v Speaker 3>and the lie detector thing shows a huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotional arousal.</v>

2552
02:18:06.150 --> 02:18:11.150
<v Speaker 3>But the interesting thing in these </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiments is the emotional arousal </v>

2553
02:18:11.150 --> 02:18:13.360
<v Speaker 3>begins about five seconds before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>picture appears on the screen,</v>

2554
02:18:13.390 --> 02:18:16.390
<v Speaker 3>five seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time for,</v>

2555
02:18:16.391 --> 02:18:17.890
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for people ready,</v>

2556
02:18:17.891 --> 02:18:19.330
<v Speaker 3>here's five seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go</v>

2557
02:18:23.960 --> 02:18:26.660
<v Speaker 3>five seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a long time.</v>

2558
02:18:27.140 --> 02:18:30.920
<v Speaker 3>And so the body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the heart starts beating faster.</v>

2559
02:18:30.921 --> 02:18:33.170
<v Speaker 3>The fight or flight response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

2560
02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:35.090
<v Speaker 3>the adrenaline kind of response kicks </v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

2561
02:18:35.300 --> 02:18:37.940
<v Speaker 3>So when the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the stimulus occurs,</v>

2562
02:18:37.970 --> 02:18:41.300
<v Speaker 3>the body's already sort of revved up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with this emotional response.</v>

2563
02:18:41.900 --> 02:18:44.660
<v Speaker 3>Now this is what that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2564
02:18:44.661 --> 02:18:46.070
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dean regions done.</v>

2565
02:18:46.071 --> 02:18:49.100
<v Speaker 3>He's repeated it and it's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>replicated elsewhere,</v>

2566
02:18:49.101 --> 02:18:52.300
<v Speaker 3>is called pre sentiment feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the feeling and then trans,</v>

2567
02:18:52.960 --> 02:18:57.960
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a decision as to which picture </v>

2568
02:18:57.960 --> 02:19:00.851
<v Speaker 3>appears on the screen is made by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer a millisecond before it </v>

2569
02:19:00.851 --> 02:19:04.481
<v Speaker 3>actually appears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no one in the world knows what </v>

2570
02:19:04.481 --> 02:19:05.150
<v Speaker 3>picture is going to appear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this is really interesting,</v>

2571
02:19:05.151 --> 02:19:07.760
<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it shows those a kind of feeding</v>

2572
02:19:07.761 --> 02:19:10.020
<v Speaker 3>back of emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2573
02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:15.040
<v Speaker 3>Daryl Bem at Cornell who's a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>respected professor of psychology and </v>

2574
02:19:15.800 --> 02:19:19.100
<v Speaker 3>has been doing a different kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiment which doesn't involve the lie</v>

2575
02:19:19.101 --> 02:19:20.470
<v Speaker 3>detector,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2576
02:19:20.720 --> 02:19:25.720
<v Speaker 3>his experiments and you sit in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a computer screen and there's two </v>

2577
02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:25.720
<v Speaker 3>curtains.</v>

2578
02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:28.460
<v Speaker 3>They're behind one of those curtains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a blank wall,</v>

2579
02:19:29.440 --> 02:19:31.970
<v Speaker 3>an image of a blank wall behind the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other one.</v>

2580
02:19:32.210 --> 02:19:34.370
<v Speaker 3>Those upon a graphic image.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2581
02:19:34.371 --> 02:19:39.371
<v Speaker 3>most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if they don't normally watch </v>

2582
02:19:39.371 --> 02:19:40.730
<v Speaker 3>pornography and more interested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing a pornographic image than a blank</v>

2583
02:19:40.731 --> 02:19:42.650
<v Speaker 3>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And before you do the test,</v>

2584
02:19:42.890 --> 02:19:45.740
<v Speaker 3>you do as a simple questionnaire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gay,</v>

2585
02:19:45.741 --> 02:19:46.730
<v Speaker 3>straight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

2586
02:19:46.910 --> 02:19:48.430
<v Speaker 3>So people who are gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gay,</v>

2587
02:19:48.530 --> 02:19:50.090
<v Speaker 3>gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pornographic images.</v>

2588
02:19:51.620 --> 02:19:54.860
<v Speaker 3>So those are emotionally arousing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say what happens?</v>

2589
02:19:54.861 --> 02:19:59.240
<v Speaker 3>You sit down at the computer and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>click on one of those two cartons,</v>

2590
02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:02.300
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which one you want to click on,</v>

2591
02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:07.560
<v Speaker 3>choose which of the two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's random whether you'll get the wall </v>

2592
02:20:07.560 --> 02:20:11.621
<v Speaker 3>or the pornographic image.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you click on one and most people </v>

2593
02:20:11.621 --> 02:20:13.190
<v Speaker 3>would hope that they're going to see the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pornographic image,</v>

2594
02:20:13.191 --> 02:20:16.510
<v Speaker 3>a different one each time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2595
02:20:17.800 --> 02:20:22.400
<v Speaker 3>and the computer makes the decision </v>
<v Speaker 3>which one to roll back which cotton roll</v>

2596
02:20:22.410 --> 02:20:23.570
<v Speaker 3>back after you've made.</v>

2597
02:20:23.570 --> 02:20:28.570
<v Speaker 3>The people don't know that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>decisions only made by the computer </v>

2598
02:20:28.570 --> 02:20:29.930
<v Speaker 3>after they've decided they think it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>already there.</v>

2599
02:20:30.150 --> 02:20:35.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so most people don't know that they're </v>

2600
02:20:35.150 --> 02:20:35.720
<v Speaker 3>doing a pre sentiment test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2601
02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:41.560
<v Speaker 3>so what happens is in these experiments </v>
<v Speaker 3>about 53 or 54 percent of the time,</v>

2602
02:20:42.170 --> 02:20:47.170
<v Speaker 3>people get the pornographic image,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas by pure chance they would be 50 </v>

2603
02:20:47.781 --> 02:20:52.781
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if instead of a pornographic image </v>

2604
02:20:52.781 --> 02:20:55.511
<v Speaker 3>you have a sort of mildly pleasant </v>
<v Speaker 3>landscape or something that's not </v>

2605
02:20:55.511 --> 02:20:56.480
<v Speaker 3>emotionally arousing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's down to 50 percent.</v>

2606
02:20:56.990 --> 02:21:01.990
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is telling us that something </v>

2607
02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:03.350
<v Speaker 3>about emotional arousal can work back in</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2608
02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:07.820
<v Speaker 3>And when you think about fast sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine you know,</v>

2609
02:21:07.821 --> 02:21:10.670
<v Speaker 3>tennis people are saving at 90 miles an </v>
<v Speaker 3>hour.</v>

2610
02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:16.000
<v Speaker 3>There's not time for the eye to take in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the angle of the ball to process it in </v>

2611
02:21:16.401 --> 02:21:18.800
<v Speaker 3>the brain through clunky brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>processing,</v>

2612
02:21:18.801 --> 02:21:23.801
<v Speaker 3>to send messages along the nerves to </v>
<v Speaker 3>muscles to get the whole body ready or </v>

2613
02:21:23.801 --> 02:21:24.110
<v Speaker 3>in a penalty shoot out.</v>

2614
02:21:24.380 --> 02:21:28.000
<v Speaker 3>The goalie haS to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a football soccer match the,</v>

2615
02:21:28.020 --> 02:21:31.500
<v Speaker 3>they have to react very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in,</v>

2616
02:21:31.510 --> 02:21:33.290
<v Speaker 3>in ping pong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to react quickly.</v>

2617
02:21:33.291 --> 02:21:38.291
<v Speaker 3>And cricket people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>australian fast bowlers bowling 100 </v>

2618
02:21:38.291 --> 02:21:39.140
<v Speaker 3>miles an hour in cricket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2619
02:21:39.470 --> 02:21:41.990
<v Speaker 3>does not long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in downhill skiing,</v>

2620
02:21:41.991 --> 02:21:43.990
<v Speaker 3>you come around a corner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2621
02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:45.680
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too fast.</v>

2622
02:21:46.190 --> 02:21:47.070
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2623
02:21:47.270 --> 02:21:49.750
<v Speaker 3>I think that part of our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way we're reacting,</v>

2624
02:21:49.760 --> 02:21:53.200
<v Speaker 3>and I think this comes up most in sports</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>

2625
02:21:53.240 --> 02:21:58.240
<v Speaker 3>and it would also come out driving a car</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you got the five second and advance </v>

2626
02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:01.850
<v Speaker 3>warning some accidents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but hatton you could concentrate and </v>

2627
02:22:01.850 --> 02:22:04.961
<v Speaker 3>perhaps avoid it and better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is a fascinating field of </v>

2628
02:22:04.961 --> 02:22:06.410
<v Speaker 3>research which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2629
02:22:06.890 --> 02:22:11.890
<v Speaker 3>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not yet been picked up by a sports </v>

2630
02:22:11.890 --> 02:22:13.680
<v Speaker 3>psychologists or by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've told Several people in the military</v>

2631
02:22:13.681 --> 02:22:17.210
<v Speaker 3>about it because I think it Would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>really interesting.</v>

2632
02:22:17.570 --> 02:22:20.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's going to do any harm </v>
<v Speaker 3>if they know know this,</v>

2633
02:22:20.451 --> 02:22:24.470
<v Speaker 3>but say for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had your physiology being monitored,</v>

2634
02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:29.800
<v Speaker 3>you're in a flight simulator or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>driving simulator and say you had it so </v>

2635
02:22:29.941 --> 02:22:33.540
<v Speaker 3>that when you've got an otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 3>inexplicably emotional arousal going on,</v>

2636
02:22:33.610 --> 02:22:36.150
<v Speaker 3>will you be unconscious of it to start </v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

2637
02:22:36.570 --> 02:22:41.570
<v Speaker 3>say it was wild outside red light went </v>
<v Speaker 3>on in the cockpit of the drive flight </v>

2638
02:22:41.570 --> 02:22:44.400
<v Speaker 3>simulator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might sometimes be a false alarm,</v>

2639
02:22:44.401 --> 02:22:48.590
<v Speaker 3>but every time that light went on you </v>
<v Speaker 3>the message we concentrate harder,</v>

2640
02:22:48.600 --> 02:22:53.600
<v Speaker 3>something bad might happen and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>could be useful technological candidate.</v>

2641
02:22:54.540 --> 02:22:58.050
<v Speaker 3>And so I think this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2642
02:22:58.051 --> 02:23:03.051
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of potential in this kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of research which is only just being </v>

2643
02:23:03.051 --> 02:23:04.840
<v Speaker 3>began to be explored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2644
02:23:05.460 --> 02:23:10.460
<v Speaker 3>and the reason I've encouraged people in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the british defense research </v>

2645
02:23:10.460 --> 02:23:14.210
<v Speaker 3>establishment to do this is because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're more likely to take it up than </v>

2646
02:23:14.210 --> 02:23:14.880
<v Speaker 3>people in universities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because in universities,</v>

2647
02:23:15.360 --> 02:23:17.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this kind of dogmatic skepticism</v>

2648
02:23:17.731 --> 02:23:19.740
<v Speaker 3>that means people are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's rubbish,</v>

2649
02:23:19.741 --> 02:23:20.340
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whew,</v>

2650
02:23:20.341 --> 02:23:22.620
<v Speaker 3>it's pseudo science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

2651
02:23:22.621 --> 02:23:26.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean stupid reactions really at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2652
02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:27.960
<v Speaker 3>the most interesting in actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2653
02:23:27.961 --> 02:23:32.961
<v Speaker 3>this is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we find out more and can we apply </v>

2654
02:23:32.961 --> 02:23:32.961
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

2655
02:23:32.961 --> 02:23:34.780
<v Speaker 1>That's incrediblY fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that these things like this</v>

2656
02:23:34.990 --> 02:23:39.990
<v Speaker 1>is pre pre cognition ability or this uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instincts or these,</v>

2657
02:23:41.180 --> 02:23:46.180
<v Speaker 1>the ability to recognize these patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think this is possibly some </v>

2658
02:23:46.180 --> 02:23:47.650
<v Speaker 1>emerging thing in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in human beings?</v>

2659
02:23:47.651 --> 02:23:52.651
<v Speaker 1>Emerging aspect of the development of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans mean obviously if you believe in </v>

2660
02:23:52.721 --> 02:23:56.230
<v Speaker 1>evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were one thing now we are this,</v>

2661
02:23:56.380 --> 02:24:01.380
<v Speaker 1>we are what we are now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is radically different from the </v>

2662
02:24:01.380 --> 02:24:03.880
<v Speaker 1>pre human hominids have 2 million plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago were very,</v>

2663
02:24:03.881 --> 02:24:08.881
<v Speaker 1>very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just extrapolate a million years </v>

2664
02:24:08.881 --> 02:24:13.651
<v Speaker 1>from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be very different from </v>

2665
02:24:13.651 --> 02:24:14.821
<v Speaker 1>what we are now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that this aspect of human </v>

2666
02:24:14.821 --> 02:24:17.140
<v Speaker 1>beings of human life is as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a developing thing,</v>

2667
02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:22.200
<v Speaker 1>this pre cognition ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ability to communicate with each </v>

2668
02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:25.171
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think maybe that's what's </v>

2669
02:24:25.171 --> 02:24:25.171
<v Speaker 1>manifesting itself when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think about someone and also on</v>

2670
02:24:25.171 --> 02:24:27.340
<v Speaker 1>the phone rings and it's them like </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously?</v>

2671
02:24:28.510 --> 02:24:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that is</v>

2672
02:24:29.900 --> 02:24:34.900
<v Speaker 3>being in traditional societies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's actually a better development in </v>

2673
02:24:34.900 --> 02:24:35.810
<v Speaker 3>modern ones where there's people don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about it on the whole,</v>

2674
02:24:35.811 --> 02:24:39.020
<v Speaker 3>there's no training for it and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In traditional societies,</v>

2675
02:24:39.021 --> 02:24:41.570
<v Speaker 3>people take these things for granted and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they rely on them.</v>

2676
02:24:42.290 --> 02:24:46.550
<v Speaker 3>Now the phone is an interesting case </v>
<v Speaker 3>because this is a modern technology,</v>

2677
02:24:47.450 --> 02:24:52.450
<v Speaker 3>but I think that telepathy as a means of</v>
<v Speaker 3>communication between people who know </v>

2678
02:24:52.450 --> 02:24:55.820
<v Speaker 3>each other well is actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always been going on.</v>

2679
02:24:55.821 --> 02:25:00.821
<v Speaker 3>Animals have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing research on telepathy </v>

2680
02:25:00.821 --> 02:25:03.250
<v Speaker 3>and dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote a book called dogs that know </v>

2681
02:25:03.250 --> 02:25:05.351
<v Speaker 3>when they're coming home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did lots of experiments on our dogs </v>

2682
02:25:05.351 --> 02:25:07.070
<v Speaker 3>picking it up just by routine or cars </v>
<v Speaker 3>hands.</v>

2683
02:25:07.250 --> 02:25:08.750
<v Speaker 3>The answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We filmed them.</v>

2684
02:25:08.751 --> 02:25:11.810
<v Speaker 3>We have people come at random times in </v>
<v Speaker 3>unfamiliar vehicles.</v>

2685
02:25:11.940 --> 02:25:16.940
<v Speaker 1>the dog still on there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why have people have such a hard </v>

2686
02:25:16.940 --> 02:25:18.410
<v Speaker 1>time replicating those dog?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One's been application.</v>

2687
02:25:18.430 --> 02:25:22.510
<v Speaker 3>It was replicated by a skeptic who then </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretended he hadn't replicated it.</v>

2688
02:25:22.980 --> 02:25:27.980
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's now generally agreed that his </v>

2689
02:25:27.980 --> 02:25:30.490
<v Speaker 3>results agreed perfectly with my end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And millions of people have dogs that do</v>

2690
02:25:30.491 --> 02:25:32.800
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't think it's hard to replicate,</v>

2691
02:25:33.130 --> 02:25:35.350
<v Speaker 3>it's just that if you do this in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>university,</v>

2692
02:25:35.351 --> 02:25:37.810
<v Speaker 3>it's likely to end your career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2693
02:25:37.811 --> 02:25:39.040
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it is?</v>

2694
02:25:39.041 --> 02:25:44.041
<v Speaker 3>Because I've read online people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have disagreed with you saying that no </v>

2695
02:25:44.041 --> 02:25:44.140
<v Speaker 3>one has ever replicated your your </v>
<v Speaker 3>results.</v>

2696
02:25:44.170 --> 02:25:45.480
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's.</v>

2697
02:25:45.490 --> 02:25:50.490
<v Speaker 3>That's the skeptics disinformation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been replicated by one of the </v>

2698
02:25:50.891 --> 02:25:55.690
<v Speaker 3>leading skeptics in britain who then </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretended falsely that he hadn't.</v>

2699
02:25:55.770 --> 02:26:00.400
<v Speaker 3>And who was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard wiseman and online on my website</v>

2700
02:26:00.401 --> 02:26:05.401
<v Speaker 3>you can see his data plotted on graphs </v>
<v Speaker 3>showing exactly the same effect as I </v>

2701
02:26:05.401 --> 02:26:07.870
<v Speaker 3>found.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it statistically significant or is it</v>

2702
02:26:07.871 --> 02:26:12.010
<v Speaker 3>100 percent is statistically significant</v>
<v Speaker 3>data and mine.</v>

2703
02:26:12.110 --> 02:26:13.530
<v Speaker 3>What is your data like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How,</v>

2704
02:26:13.570 --> 02:26:18.570
<v Speaker 3>how?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How often do they know and how often </v>

2705
02:26:18.570 --> 02:26:18.570
<v Speaker 3>were they unaware?</v>
<v Speaker 3>About 80 percent of the time.</v>

2706
02:26:18.570 --> 02:26:23.371
<v Speaker 3>We did a series of 100 trials with one </v>
<v Speaker 3>dog and on those occasions the dog </v>

2707
02:26:23.890 --> 02:26:28.890
<v Speaker 3>started waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the person was about to come home,</v>

2708
02:26:29.260 --> 02:26:31.990
<v Speaker 3>it was actually before she got in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>car to come home,</v>

2709
02:26:31.991 --> 02:26:36.991
<v Speaker 3>all the taxi picked up her intention and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was at random times on 20 occasions</v>

2710
02:26:37.631 --> 02:26:40.540
<v Speaker 3>out of 100.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't on three or four of those,</v>

2711
02:26:40.541 --> 02:26:45.541
<v Speaker 3>the dog was sick and on the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>occasions it was when it was a bit john </v>

2712
02:26:45.541 --> 02:26:48.550
<v Speaker 3>heat and the next apartment could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>distracted,</v>

2713
02:26:48.910 --> 02:26:53.910
<v Speaker 3>but even if you include all hundred </v>
<v Speaker 3>events including the ones where the dog </v>

2714
02:26:53.910 --> 02:26:55.840
<v Speaker 3>was to do the statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still massively significant.</v>

2715
02:26:56.680 --> 02:27:01.680
<v Speaker 3>That's fascInating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you think that much like what you </v>

2716
02:27:01.680 --> 02:27:04.711
<v Speaker 3>were talking about with your son who is </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to recognize 100 percent of the </v>

2717
02:27:04.711 --> 02:27:06.730
<v Speaker 3>time when someone was staring at him </v>
<v Speaker 3>that dogs,</v>

2718
02:27:06.731 --> 02:27:08.680
<v Speaker 3>because they don't have like a cultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>context,</v>

2719
02:27:08.681 --> 02:27:13.681
<v Speaker 3>they don't have all this doubt in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>head that they do it and they have an </v>

2720
02:27:13.681 --> 02:27:13.840
<v Speaker 3>emotional investment too.</v>

2721
02:27:14.150 --> 02:27:19.150
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a boring paris psychology </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiment in it for a dog is immensely </v>

2722
02:27:19.150 --> 02:27:23.941
<v Speaker 3>emotionally exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the owner comes home is an </v>

2723
02:27:23.941 --> 02:27:24.940
<v Speaker 3>emotional charge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do it over and over again.</v>

2724
02:27:24.941 --> 02:27:27.040
<v Speaker 3>They never get bored of their own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is coming home,</v>

2725
02:27:27.790 --> 02:27:32.790
<v Speaker 3>so this is the telephone phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I can briefly summarize is one I </v>

2726
02:27:34.721 --> 02:27:39.721
<v Speaker 3>do in my tests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who say this happens to them in </v>

2727
02:27:39.721 --> 02:27:44.401
<v Speaker 3>real life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me the names and numbers of four </v>

2728
02:27:44.401 --> 02:27:45.820
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might happen with a we pick,</v>

2729
02:27:45.821 --> 02:27:50.020
<v Speaker 3>they sit at home being filmed so we know</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not getting other phone calls or</v>

2730
02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:55.320
<v Speaker 3>text messages or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they are a landline on the landline </v>

2731
02:27:55.320 --> 02:27:59.790
<v Speaker 3>phone with no caller id display.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We picked one of the four corners at </v>

2732
02:27:59.790 --> 02:28:03.451
<v Speaker 3>random and I'm called them out and say </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were doing it was say please ring</v>

2733
02:28:03.701 --> 02:28:04.390
<v Speaker 3>joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2734
02:28:05.020 --> 02:28:07.750
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think about you,</v>

2735
02:28:08.080 --> 02:28:13.080
<v Speaker 3>they bring you your phone rings and </v>
<v Speaker 3>before you pick it up you have to say </v>

2736
02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:13.080
<v Speaker 3>who you think it is.</v>

2737
02:28:13.620 --> 02:28:15.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's john and you pick it up.</v>

2738
02:28:15.761 --> 02:28:17.800
<v Speaker 3>Say hi john,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right or you're wrong.</v>

2739
02:28:18.430 --> 02:28:22.330
<v Speaker 3>You can't know from the normal patterns </v>
<v Speaker 3>of life because the,</v>

2740
02:28:22.350 --> 02:28:24.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a randomly chosen.</v>

2741
02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:27.950
<v Speaker 3>And so by chance you'd be right one time</v>
<v Speaker 3>in four,</v>

2742
02:28:27.980 --> 02:28:32.960
<v Speaker 3>25 percent in these experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Average score in our film test is 45</v>

2743
02:28:32.961 --> 02:28:35.840
<v Speaker 3>percent and massively significant </v>
<v Speaker 3>statistically,</v>

2744
02:28:36.650 --> 02:28:39.650
<v Speaker 3>and this has not been replicated in </v>
<v Speaker 3>other universities.</v>

2745
02:28:39.651 --> 02:28:43.640
<v Speaker 3>Even one of britain's leading skeptics </v>
<v Speaker 3>checked us out and he's getting positive</v>

2746
02:28:43.641 --> 02:28:48.641
<v Speaker 3>results much to his dismay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this is a.</v>

2747
02:28:49.400 --> 02:28:52.990
<v Speaker 3>I've now got an automated test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm about to launch it in the us,</v>

2748
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:58.030
<v Speaker 3>but it's already launched in britain </v>
<v Speaker 3>where people can do this on cell phones </v>

2749
02:28:58.030 --> 02:28:59.330
<v Speaker 3>with their friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to be in a lab.</v>

2750
02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:04.960
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think telephone telepathy is real and </v>

2751
02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:05.570
<v Speaker 3>I think what's happening is that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to call someone,</v>

2752
02:29:05.571 --> 02:29:08.870
<v Speaker 3>if I wanted to call you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd formed the intention to call you.</v>

2753
02:29:08.870 --> 02:29:13.870
<v Speaker 3>I've got a motive to call you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd be thinking about joe and then </v>

2754
02:29:13.870 --> 02:29:18.491
<v Speaker 3>I'd get my phone out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dial a number or press your memory </v>

2755
02:29:18.491 --> 02:29:21.710
<v Speaker 3>thing for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I formed the intention to call you.</v>

2756
02:29:21.711 --> 02:29:24.890
<v Speaker 3>I think you could in some cases pickup </v>
<v Speaker 3>that intention.</v>

2757
02:29:24.891 --> 02:29:27.620
<v Speaker 3>You might start thinking about me for no</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparent reason.</v>

2758
02:29:28.100 --> 02:29:30.680
<v Speaker 3>And then the call comes through and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

2759
02:29:30.681 --> 02:29:32.570
<v Speaker 3>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just thinking about you.</v>

2760
02:29:33.170 --> 02:29:37.280
<v Speaker 3>So I think this is a genuinely </v>
<v Speaker 3>telepathic phenomenon in many cases.</v>

2761
02:29:37.281 --> 02:29:42.281
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it can be coincidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but on average it seems to be a real </v>

2762
02:29:42.281 --> 02:29:44.250
<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2763
02:29:44.720 --> 02:29:49.720
<v Speaker 3>I think this is an example of where </v>
<v Speaker 3>telepathy really is evolving along with </v>

2764
02:29:49.720 --> 02:29:51.830
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It happens with emails and text messages</v>

2765
02:29:51.831 --> 02:29:53.630
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Until recently,</v>

2766
02:29:54.050 --> 02:29:58.310
<v Speaker 3>the only way you could get in touch with</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone at a distance was telepathically</v>

2767
02:29:58.311 --> 02:29:59.900
<v Speaker 3>if you wanted a quick response.</v>

2768
02:30:00.230 --> 02:30:05.230
<v Speaker 3>Now you can do it by phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've also done research on what I </v>

2769
02:30:05.230 --> 02:30:08.630
<v Speaker 3>think is one of the basic biological </v>
<v Speaker 3>forms of this which mothers and babies,</v>

2770
02:30:09.840 --> 02:30:14.840
<v Speaker 3>many nursing mothers find that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're away from their baby for no </v>

2771
02:30:16.371 --> 02:30:18.620
<v Speaker 3>apparent reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their milk that's done,</v>

2772
02:30:18.621 --> 02:30:21.350
<v Speaker 3>their breasts start squeezing out milk </v>
<v Speaker 3>normally.</v>

2773
02:30:21.351 --> 02:30:25.490
<v Speaker 3>That happens when the baby cries and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they feel their breast tinkle.</v>

2774
02:30:25.940 --> 02:30:30.940
<v Speaker 3>Say there was a nursing mother here now </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was no baby crying here and </v>

2775
02:30:30.940 --> 02:30:34.220
<v Speaker 3>she felt her milk that done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most nursing mothers think my baby needs</v>

2776
02:30:34.221 --> 02:30:39.221
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And until recently they just went home </v>

2777
02:30:39.221 --> 02:30:39.590
<v Speaker 3>to the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they call home on a cell phone.</v>

2778
02:30:39.980 --> 02:30:42.770
<v Speaker 3>But I've done studies on nursing mothers</v>
<v Speaker 3>in london,</v>

2779
02:30:42.920 --> 02:30:47.150
<v Speaker 3>20 of them over two month period each,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we found that there was.</v>

2780
02:30:47.151 --> 02:30:49.140
<v Speaker 3>it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very highly significant.</v>

2781
02:30:49.141 --> 02:30:54.141
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't just synchronized rhythms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were responding when they baby </v>

2782
02:30:54.141 --> 02:30:55.670
<v Speaker 3>needed them and before telephones were </v>
<v Speaker 3>invented,</v>

2783
02:30:56.390 --> 02:31:01.390
<v Speaker 3>any mother that could pick up when her </v>
<v Speaker 3>baby needed her and went to the baby </v>

2784
02:31:01.390 --> 02:31:05.831
<v Speaker 3>would have a mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a baby that survived better than a </v>

2785
02:31:05.831 --> 02:31:05.831
<v Speaker 3>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't pick it up.</v>

2786
02:31:05.831 --> 02:31:09.320
<v Speaker 3>So I think telephones in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gives us a technological way of doing</v>

2787
02:31:09.321 --> 02:31:13.220
<v Speaker 3>something that in the past happened more</v>
<v Speaker 3>unreliably by telepathy.</v>

2788
02:31:13.460 --> 02:31:18.460
<v Speaker 3>So do you think that these telephones </v>
<v Speaker 3>connecting to telepathy is somehow or </v>

2789
02:31:18.460 --> 02:31:22.931
<v Speaker 3>another related to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this morphic field that it's seemingly </v>

2790
02:31:22.931 --> 02:31:24.240
<v Speaker 3>undefined?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't.</v>

2791
02:31:24.270 --> 02:31:29.270
<v Speaker 3>We know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or rather you believe that this is a </v>

2792
02:31:29.270 --> 02:31:29.270
<v Speaker 3>real phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it exists,</v>

2793
02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:31.410
<v Speaker 3>but we don't know exactly what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanism is.</v>

2794
02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:34.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what happens with social groups,</v>

2795
02:31:34.650 --> 02:31:36.810
<v Speaker 3>any social group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the field as a whole,</v>

2796
02:31:36.870 --> 02:31:38.220
<v Speaker 3>as a group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a whole,</v>

2797
02:31:38.221 --> 02:31:43.221
<v Speaker 3>has a field,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a magnetic field will arrange on </v>

2798
02:31:43.221 --> 02:31:44.760
<v Speaker 3>filings which are within its field of </v>
<v Speaker 3>influence.</v>

2799
02:31:45.030 --> 02:31:48.360
<v Speaker 3>If you have a flock of birds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>starlings that are flying together,</v>

2800
02:31:48.810 --> 02:31:53.810
<v Speaker 3>there's a kind of field that coordinates</v>
<v Speaker 3>their movement so they can change </v>

2801
02:31:53.810 --> 02:31:54.700
<v Speaker 3>direction rapidly without bumping into </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

2802
02:31:55.230 --> 02:31:57.960
<v Speaker 3>If you hAve a school of fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got the same kind of thing.</v>

2803
02:31:58.530 --> 02:32:01.890
<v Speaker 3>If you have a pack of wolves and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>leave the young,</v>

2804
02:32:01.891 --> 02:32:06.690
<v Speaker 3>the cubs are left behind in the den with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a babysitter while the adults go hunting</v>

2805
02:32:06.870 --> 02:32:10.560
<v Speaker 3>to bring food back for the young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The field that links them isn't broken.</v>

2806
02:32:10.561 --> 02:32:13.080
<v Speaker 3>It stretches like an invisible elastic </v>
<v Speaker 3>band.</v>

2807
02:32:13.530 --> 02:32:18.530
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the basis of telepathy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's to do with social bonds </v>

2808
02:32:18.530 --> 02:32:22.161
<v Speaker 3>through social fields.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a mother and the baby are very </v>

2809
02:32:22.161 --> 02:32:25.821
<v Speaker 3>closely linked and it's as if there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>this invisible elastic band between </v>

2810
02:32:25.821 --> 02:32:29.751
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when you look at telephone </v>

2811
02:32:29.751 --> 02:32:33.171
<v Speaker 3>telepathy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it typically only happens with people </v>

2812
02:32:33.171 --> 02:32:33.171
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2813
02:32:33.171 --> 02:32:35.520
<v Speaker 3>it happens between mothers and children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Husbands and wives,</v>

2814
02:32:35.940 --> 02:32:37.890
<v Speaker 3>lovers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>partners,</v>

2815
02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.320
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>therapists and clients.</v>

2816
02:32:40.321 --> 02:32:43.200
<v Speaker 3>If there's a kind of emotional charge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>best friends,</v>

2817
02:32:43.410 --> 02:32:45.990
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't happen with insurance </v>
<v Speaker 3>salesman and,</v>

2818
02:32:46.240 --> 02:32:49.500
<v Speaker 3>and people to whom you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotionally connected.</v>

2819
02:32:49.890 --> 02:32:51.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

2820
02:32:51.900 --> 02:32:53.760
<v Speaker 3>it depends on social bonds.</v>

2821
02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:59.000
<v Speaker 3>And so I think morphic fields of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>social group is something that applies </v>

2822
02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:03.621
<v Speaker 3>to any social group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A family as a kind of has a morphic </v>

2823
02:33:03.621 --> 02:33:06.240
<v Speaker 3>field,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a football team has won a Michael Murphy</v>

2824
02:33:06.270 --> 02:33:11.270
<v Speaker 3>who founded the esalen institute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did a fascinating book called the </v>

2825
02:33:11.270 --> 02:33:12.990
<v Speaker 3>psychic side of sports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2826
02:33:13.680 --> 02:33:18.420
<v Speaker 3>he describes these interviews with </v>
<v Speaker 3>football players and many of them turned</v>

2827
02:33:18.421 --> 02:33:20.910
<v Speaker 3>quite mystical when they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>interviewed in private.</v>

2828
02:33:20.911 --> 02:33:25.911
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't talk about it in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>locker room for fear of being thought </v>

2829
02:33:25.911 --> 02:33:25.911
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2830
02:33:25.911 --> 02:33:27.720
<v Speaker 3>but many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like soccer players,</v>

2831
02:33:28.140 --> 02:33:29.730
<v Speaker 3>they said when the game's going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2832
02:33:29.731 --> 02:33:32.880
<v Speaker 3>it's as if they can just feel where </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people are on the field.</v>

2833
02:33:32.881 --> 02:33:34.830
<v Speaker 3>It was like an instinct even they </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't,</v>

2834
02:33:34.890 --> 02:33:39.890
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow they were working like a single </v>

2835
02:33:39.890 --> 02:33:42.081
<v Speaker 3>organism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's an example of a </v>

2836
02:33:42.081 --> 02:33:43.290
<v Speaker 3>morphic field of a social group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's why team sports,</v>

2837
02:33:43.580 --> 02:33:44.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2838
02:33:44.590 --> 02:33:48.660
<v Speaker 3>so interesting to watch because it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>just about guys being brilliant,</v>

2839
02:33:48.900 --> 02:33:53.900
<v Speaker 3>it's about guys working together and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a way that's highly coordinated and more</v>

2840
02:33:53.911 --> 02:33:57.450
<v Speaker 3>effectively the team works together.</v>
