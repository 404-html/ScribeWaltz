1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.620
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.970
<v Speaker 1>And the one thing that I noticed,</v>

3
00:00:02.971 --> 00:00:04.320
<v Speaker 1>and I've said it before is like,</v>

4
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.800
<v Speaker 1>and I feel like other people have noticed this it cause I've gotten a lot of</v>

5
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:08.730
<v Speaker 1>fights when I was young,</v>

6
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:10.080
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think I ever won one.</v>

7
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.240
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like I must exude this kind of waft of something that like I just am</v>

8
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:16.320
<v Speaker 1>not a fighter,</v>

9
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 1>but every time I've gotten in a fight it's been more that someone has,</v>

10
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.120
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's taking,</v>

11
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>trying to take advantage of me or has been picking on me for a long period of</v>

12
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:24.661
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

13
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:27.240
<v Speaker 1>And it's the only way that this is going to stop or have been or have been</v>

14
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>picking on someone that I cared about.</v>

15
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.743
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

16
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.840
<v Speaker 1>and I always got the sense afterwards that the person who beat me up basically a</v>

17
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.751
<v Speaker 1>new what?</v>

18
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:36.931
<v Speaker 1>New?</v>

19
00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>That they're like they,</v>

20
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.710
<v Speaker 1>I can draw Davidson into a fight and I'll,</v>

21
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.080
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

22
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.560
<v Speaker 1>and he'll,</v>

23
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.650
<v Speaker 1>he'll only go in,</v>

24
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>he'll go into the bear trap and then I'll just be able to beat him up.</v>

25
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.620
<v Speaker 1>And the only good thing about it ultimately is that they,</v>

26
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.630
<v Speaker 1>the picking on stuff stopped,</v>

27
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.381
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

28
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>But I had to take a beating in order to sort of affect that,</v>

29
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.963
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

30
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

31
00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:03.021
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird psychological sort of a relationship between the bully and the</v>

32
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.770
<v Speaker 1>person who gets picked on.</v>

33
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like,</v>

36
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.020
<v Speaker 1>and I feel like the real true fighters wouldn't even do something like that.</v>

37
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:10.854
<v Speaker 1>They would recognize,</v>

38
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.710
<v Speaker 1>this guy or I'm not going to bother with this guy.</v>

40
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:14.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean the I am mother.</v>

41
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:15.751
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

43
00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:16.000
<v Speaker 1>May,</v>

44
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.231
<v Speaker 1>may,</v>

45
00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:16.741
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

46
00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:17.011
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

47
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 1>maybe there are some fighters who liked to beat the shit out of people or you</v>

48
00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:20.071
<v Speaker 1>sit,</v>

49
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

50
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.031
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

51
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:21.271
<v Speaker 1>You've,</v>

52
00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:22.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm even noticing fight.</v>

53
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I feel like that guy looks like he probably might have,</v>

54
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.960
<v Speaker 1>would be happy to be beating up someone with far less skill.</v>

55
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.150
<v Speaker 1>He'd be taking as much delight in it as he is.</v>

56
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Usually they've been abused.</v>

57
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Is that so,</v>

58
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

59
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 1>I believe that's a big part of,</v>

60
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:35.811
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:36.900
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what,</v>

62
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.720
<v Speaker 1>what constitutes a bully is physical abuse.</v>

63
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.650
<v Speaker 1>You know that they've been abused either at home or they've been abused by other</v>

64
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 1>kids and they're trying to lash out and get theirs.</v>

65
00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Now they've sort of taken on the role of the bully because they've been bullied</v>

66
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:51.451
<v Speaker 1>so much.</v>

67
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>That happens a lot.</v>

68
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.401
<v Speaker 1>I could see that.</v>

69
00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:54.234
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>

70
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>here's the,</v>

71
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.910
<v Speaker 1>here's the sort of a story of my,</v>

72
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.390
<v Speaker 1>one of my,</v>

73
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>my worst beatings.</v>

74
00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.041
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

75
00:01:59.041 --> 00:01:59.910
<v Speaker 1>I was at the YMC,</v>

76
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

77
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.310
<v Speaker 1>me and my brother were playing basketball.</v>

78
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 1>That was probably like I 16,</v>

79
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:04.381
<v Speaker 1>17,</v>

80
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 1>eight towns might in my last year of high school probably.</v>

81
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

82
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.130
<v Speaker 1>these two guys come and say,</v>

83
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:08.580
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

84
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Speaker 1>let's play two on two.</v>

85
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.021
<v Speaker 1>So we did,</v>

86
00:02:10.021 --> 00:02:12.270
<v Speaker 1>and back then I probably weighed like two 40.</v>

87
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.810
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

88
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>I was a big fat dude.</v>

89
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.361
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

90
00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:16.200
<v Speaker 1>I just see it.</v>

91
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:17.070
<v Speaker 1>40 in high school.</v>

92
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

93
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

94
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:18.131
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

95
00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:18.490
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

96
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.930
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

97
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.741
<v Speaker 1>maybe two 30.</v>

98
00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Like I was enormous,</v>

99
00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:22.350
<v Speaker 1>but it was not a,</v>

100
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:23.490
<v Speaker 1>it was not a healthy weight.</v>

101
00:02:23.491 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that's what you weigh now.</v>

102
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.530
<v Speaker 1>One 75 one that,</v>

103
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.030
<v Speaker 1>that's partly the whole boxing stuff.</v>

104
00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>And we do tree planting a lot up in Canada.</v>

105
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:33.570
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of like what you do at university.</v>

106
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:35.350
<v Speaker 1>You just go up to the woods and plant trees and that.</v>

107
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>I shed a lot of weight that way,</v>

108
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

109
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.891
<v Speaker 1>during,</v>

110
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:38.730
<v Speaker 1>during university,</v>

111
00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:39.420
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

112
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.530
<v Speaker 1>so I was a big beast,</v>

113
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:41.210
<v Speaker 1>when I started,</v>

115
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.730
<v Speaker 1>knew how to use my body and the guy that I was playing against was maybe one,</v>

116
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:45.564
<v Speaker 1>one 60.</v>

117
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

118
00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.910
<v Speaker 1>so we're getting close to beat them.</v>

119
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.770
<v Speaker 1>And I turned around and I see the ball,</v>

120
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:51.270
<v Speaker 1>it's a whipping right at my face.</v>

121
00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:54.780
<v Speaker 1>He'd thrown it at me and I turned my head and it sort of goes by the side of my</v>

122
00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:55.410
<v Speaker 1>head and just,</v>

123
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.243
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>gives me a scalp burn basically.</v>

125
00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>And then he's,</v>

126
00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>then he's charging right at me,</v>

127
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 1>like to get no fight.</v>

128
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

129
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.040
<v Speaker 1>and there was no pro prior provocation.</v>

130
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.891
<v Speaker 1>None at all.</v>

131
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:06.491
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

132
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:06.761
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

133
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 1>this guy just to basketball,</v>

134
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>just a basketball game and,</v>

135
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:10.984
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

136
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.291
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

137
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:11.501
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

138
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:12.071
<v Speaker 1>It's in the why.</v>

139
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:12.521
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>

140
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:12.761
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

141
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 1>well we're not going to have a fight right in the middle of the why.</v>

142
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to be okay.</v>

143
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:16.320
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

144
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

145
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:17.860
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really want to get into a fight,</v>

146
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:18.221
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

147
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 1>this guy throwing a basketball,</v>

177
00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Speaker 1>he's massaging my shoulders cause I guess he thinks that's what he should be</v>

178
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:03.551
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

183
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:03.760
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

184
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.301
<v Speaker 1>my brother was like,</v>

00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:04.421
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

186
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I guess I've seen this in rocky.</v>

187
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:06.544
<v Speaker 1>I should keep him,</v>

188
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 1>keep him limber and you know,</v>

189
00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:09.001

190
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:09.250

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:10.510
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be fine.</v>

193
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:10.961
<v Speaker 1>And if I,</v>

194
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 1>but I had a chance to look in his eyes,</v>

195
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:12.761
<v Speaker 1>he'd be like,</v>

196
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>

197
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>

198
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.523
<v Speaker 1>you are fucked.</v>

199
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.071
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

200
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:16.420
<v Speaker 1>And I think I knew that too.</v>

201
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 1>So I ended up outside,</v>

202
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:20.120
<v Speaker 1>it's winter in Canada and uh,</v>

203
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 1>there's ice on the,</v>

204
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:22.150
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

205
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.490
<v Speaker 1>on the sidewalk and you know,</v>

206
00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

207
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.180
<v Speaker 1>I face up and what I assume is somewhat somewhat of a fighting posture.</v>

208
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.040
<v Speaker 1>And he kicks me in the head.</v>

209
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a first thing he does just like kicks me right in the head.</v>

210
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.380
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not even sure what that will happen.</v>

211
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm still standing,</v>

212
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

213
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.440
<v Speaker 1>and they need does it again.</v>

214
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.490
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm like,</v>

215
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.001
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

216
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 1>this is not,</v>

217
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.650
<v Speaker 1>this is not good.</v>

218
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.090
<v Speaker 1>So he had martial arts training.</v>

219
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.691

222
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.431

00:04:51.971 --> 00:04:52.804
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

295
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.340
<v Speaker 1>and they caught him just walking down the street with the knife in his hand.</v>

296
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.791
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

297
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:17.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

298
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.691
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

299
00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:18.620
<v Speaker 1>later on the interview,</v>

300
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Speaker 1>his mom and his mom was like,</v>

301
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.451
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

302
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:21.284
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

303
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.363
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

304
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

305
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:25.640
<v Speaker 1>he basically would sit out on the porch saying that George Bush was going to</v>

306
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:27.310
<v Speaker 1>come in air force one anytime,</v>

307
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.840
<v Speaker 1>pick them up for some top secret missions.</v>

308
00:06:28.841 --> 00:06:29.840
<v Speaker 1>So we clearly had some,</v>

309
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.130
<v Speaker 1>some mental instabilities that didn't present themselves at the age at which at</v>

310
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:35.480
<v Speaker 1>least they were maybe emerging,</v>

311
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.020
<v Speaker 1>but later use them.</v>

312
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:38.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

313
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 1>that part had never been been into,</v>

314
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:41.031
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

315
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:42.590
<v Speaker 1>I can't really comment on that,</v>

316
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:43.490
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

317
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

318
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

319
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.280
<v Speaker 1>but I think I feel like he stabbed the man 44 times.</v>

320
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.720
<v Speaker 1>It would have to be a really heated argument.</v>

321
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 1>And if they had no prior sort of history with one another,</v>

322
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:55.011
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

323
00:06:55.011 --> 00:06:55.731
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know.</v>

324
00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:59.510
<v Speaker 1>But first of all that he stabbed him and then he stabbed him that many times.</v>

325
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

326
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

327
00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:01.920
<v Speaker 1>And I sort of thought later,</v>

328
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:02.871
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

329
00:07:02.871 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 1>as bad as I got it,</v>

330
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:04.761
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

331
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:06.410
<v Speaker 1>I could've gotten a lot worse.</v>

332
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:07.131
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

333
00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:07.880
<v Speaker 1>At least he like,</v>

334
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.110
<v Speaker 1>let me off at the end.</v>

335
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:09.501
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

336
00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:09.990
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

337
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.231
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

338
00:07:10.231 --> 00:07:13.500
<v Speaker 1>I always try to explain that someone who gives people the finger and a car,</v>

339
00:07:13.501 --> 00:07:15.270
<v Speaker 1>like you never know who you're giving the finger to.</v>

340
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.891
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

341
00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:16.190
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

342
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.990
<v Speaker 1>my wife has a bad habit of honking the horn.</v>

343
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.833
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

344
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.351
<v Speaker 1>baby,</v>

345
00:07:19.351 --> 00:07:19.741
<v Speaker 1>I love you,</v>

346
00:07:19.741 --> 00:07:20.510
<v Speaker 1>but don't,</v>

347
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.080
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>

348
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.751
<v Speaker 1>Don't do it.</v>

349
00:07:21.751 --> 00:07:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Don't you don't know who the hell is stepping out of that freaking car.</v>

350
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:24.730
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

351
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:25.261
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

352
00:07:25.261 --> 00:07:27.840
<v Speaker 1>you never know what state they're in.</v>

353
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.610
<v Speaker 1>They can be in the worst state of mind ever at the moment you lay on that horn,</v>

354
00:07:32.611 --> 00:07:34.560
<v Speaker 1>you could have caught them at the breaking point.</v>

355
00:07:34.561 --> 00:07:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

356
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.740
<v Speaker 1>and that's what puts them picked fucking people.</v>

357
00:07:37.741 --> 00:07:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Especially in this day and age when you're dealing with cities and traffic and</v>

358
00:07:41.701 --> 00:07:46.701
<v Speaker 1>the unnatural stress of slamming 200 fucking million people together like this.</v>

359
00:07:47.521 --> 00:07:47.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

360
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Very nice.</v>

361
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:48.900
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

362
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.591
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

363
00:07:49.591 --> 00:07:49.921
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

364
00:07:49.921 --> 00:07:51.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm up against a different breed of humanity,</v>

365
00:07:51.751 --> 00:07:54.270
<v Speaker 1>right guys kicking me in the head and nowhere and you know,</v>

366
00:07:54.271 --> 00:07:57.390
<v Speaker 1>you're just trying to play basketball and your brother's rubbing your shoulders.</v>

367
00:07:57.391 --> 00:07:58.051
<v Speaker 1>Neither want to be know.</v>

368
00:07:58.051 --> 00:07:58.881
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck are you doing?</v>

369
00:07:58.881 --> 00:07:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

370
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.420
<v Speaker 1>we're totally neo fights and,</v>

371
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:00.960
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

372
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.681
<v Speaker 1>and there was something,</v>

373
00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:01.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

374
00:08:01.921 --> 00:08:04.410
<v Speaker 1>this is probably way too like writerly,</v>

375
00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.350
<v Speaker 1>but there is something about the eyes of a guy like that,</v>

376
00:08:07.351 --> 00:08:08.010
<v Speaker 1>that you're just like,</v>

00:08:09.931 --> 00:08:11.760
<v Speaker 1>you're done before you're done.</v>

382
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.520
<v Speaker 1>You're done before one thirds of those dudes.</v>

383
00:08:14.521 --> 00:08:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

384
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.750
<v Speaker 1>There's just something clock working around it.</v>

385
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.633
<v Speaker 1>Their eyes,</v>

386
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.180
<v Speaker 1>and you're just like,</v>

387
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:18.931
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

00:08:19.471 --> 00:08:19.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

391
00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm not built to this standard.</v>

392
00:08:21.361 --> 00:08:23.130
<v Speaker 1>This is not going to work out too well for me.</v>

393
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
