<v Speaker 1>a with Adam,</v>

<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hold that.</v>

17
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:47.784
<v Speaker 1>Came to be man as um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I was going through this book for </v>

18
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 1>last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would go through change stuff.</v>

19
00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:54.040
<v Speaker 1>I have so many stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

20
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>We went through interviews with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many stories.</v>

21
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.593
<v Speaker 1>He would come back and read it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all my changes and when he read it I'm </v>

22
00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:01.171
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

23
00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:04.380
<v Speaker 1>this guy has a great reading voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love his reading voice.</v>

24
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.590
<v Speaker 1>And I started getting these different </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas about doing it,</v>

25
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:07.831
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:07.831 --> 00:01:08.664
<v Speaker 1>what maybe he can read and I can do my </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast thing on the side and he can </v>

27
00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>like after each chapter in between </v>
<v Speaker 1>chapters,</v>

28
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.640
<v Speaker 1>make it real interactive type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of how it came to be,</v>

29
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the beginning I got to be honest,</v>

30
00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:20.664
<v Speaker 1>the beginning I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is this motherfucker talk and for </v>

31
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:24.170
<v Speaker 1>David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave like,</v>

32
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.580
<v Speaker 1>take you redo this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you do it?</v>

33
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Why are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

34
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.640
<v Speaker 1>but it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really does work.</v>

35
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Like as as it goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I got also,</v>

36
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.060
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you and him are good friends.</v>

37
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.013
<v Speaker 1>So when you guys are talking then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't mind him reading for you as much </v>

38
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:40.890
<v Speaker 1>for some strange reason.</v>

39
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.420
<v Speaker 1>I know it doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

40
00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say we're good friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just joking,</v>

41
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can hear it right now.</v>

42
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 1>He became a pain in my fucking ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>during this process,</v>

43
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

44
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 1>he's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a real anal guy.</v>

45
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.783
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

46
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.410
<v Speaker 1>he helped out a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

47
00:01:55.411 --> 00:01:57.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a real raw,</v>

48
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.640
<v Speaker 1>sadistic type of mindset and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.280
<v Speaker 1>he helped me put that on paper man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I give him a lot of credit for that.</v>

50
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

51
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.210
<v Speaker 1>it comes across the book is outstanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

52
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.120
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

53
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.953
<v Speaker 1>it's more than just sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting across from you and you telling </v>

54
00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:13.524
<v Speaker 1>your story is one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this long detailed history of how </v>

55
00:02:18.031 --> 00:02:23.031
<v Speaker 1>you became to be the person you became.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very educational for people</v>

56
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.070
<v Speaker 1>because they can realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

57
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:27.630
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't always this guy.</v>

58
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>This is what's fucked up about people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you see a guy who's like you,</v>

59
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>who runs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

60
00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 1>how many ultra marathons did you run in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a row?</v>

61
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.953
<v Speaker 1>You've got some saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ran 808 weekends in a row to stop and </v>

62
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:40.950
<v Speaker 1>think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

63
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Eight hundreds means eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred mile races,</v>

64
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.243
<v Speaker 1>eight weekends in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred mile race will put you out </v>

65
00:02:49.171 --> 00:02:51.160
<v Speaker 1>for fucking six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

66
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>when you ran eight of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight weekends or it's a fuck.</v>

67
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.070
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking insane accomplishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was nuts.</v>

68
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.963
<v Speaker 1>You think about a person like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think of them as a static fully </v>

69
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>formed</v>

70
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.290
<v Speaker 2>version,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

71
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.313
<v Speaker 2>You don't usually get to see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially someone like you who you </v>

72
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 2>went into so much depth about your rise </v>
<v Speaker 2>and fall and rise and fall.</v>

73
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:10.444
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like a straight linear process</v>
<v Speaker 2>between you getting inspired and then </v>

74
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 2>you becoming this bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

75

<v Speaker 2>that black guy who kind of makes it in,</v>

78
00:03:24.141 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the financial world,</v>

79
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.060

<v Speaker 2>I never saw that.</v>

80

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great movie.</v>

81
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like pursuit of happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

82
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:31.474

83
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Speaker 2>over it and he makes it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fell on my ass.</v>

84

<v Speaker 2>my life was in.</v>

93
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.063
<v Speaker 2>It was so in depth to go back through </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life with a fine tooth comb that I </v>

94
00:03:57.731 --> 00:03:59.920
<v Speaker 2>almost got embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even put it out there to people.</v>

<v Speaker 2>five people.</v>

101
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.510
<v Speaker 2>So I walk off the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's still me.</v>

102
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 2>So everyday I'm fighting that dude.</v>

107
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.410
<v Speaker 2>So my mind isn't veer off saying let's </v>
<v Speaker 2>run out the damn door because people are</v>

<v Speaker 2>watching me on the fucking podcast on </v>
<v Speaker 2>open the damn door and get out of here </v>

109
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:41.920
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the real me.</v>

110
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.800
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not sadistic man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm focused on.</v>

111
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:47.020
<v Speaker 2>We have to do to stay locked into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>game of life.</v>

112
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.090
<v Speaker 2>And that's where.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I tell people,</v>

113

<v Speaker 2>I go there.</v>

115
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.173
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the reasons why this book </v>
<v Speaker 2>is so good is because you're so honest </v>

116
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:57.040
<v Speaker 2>about your vulnerabilities and how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>overcome them.</v>

117
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.460
<v Speaker 2>And for people that see someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>obese,</v>

118
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.403
<v Speaker 2>who's done great things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just assume that they're are </v>

119
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:03.964
<v Speaker 2>different than you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you hear about your </v>

120
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:09.400
<v Speaker 2>insecurities and your pitfalls and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that went wrong with you.</v>

121
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.413
<v Speaker 2>And you realize what God dammit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those the same things to go wrong with </v>

122
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

123
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe I have that inside of me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've just never summoned it.</v>

124
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll tell you this.</v>

125
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 2>I started really realizing that when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>started overcoming myself,</v>

126
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 2>I started getting around these real </v>
<v Speaker 2>alpha males,</v>

127
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.540
<v Speaker 2>these hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard men.</v>

128
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 2>And I always put people way above me </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was growing up like my God,</v>

129
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 2>they had to have a lot more than me to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get to where they're at.</v>

130
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.573
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of them did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But once you get around the best of the </v>

131
00:05:38.141 --> 00:05:41.650
<v Speaker 2>best of the best people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can kind of start breaking them down</v>

132
00:05:41.651 --> 00:05:42.540
<v Speaker 2>and realize that man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

133
00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:44.920
<v Speaker 2>you're just as fucked up as me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we all have.</v>

134
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.710
<v Speaker 2>But all you did was you hit it better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>

135
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your upbringing,</v>

136
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 2>your mom and dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your society,</v>

137
00:05:51.641 --> 00:05:55.090
<v Speaker 2>the way you were raised,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hit it better than that mind.</v>

138
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.230
<v Speaker 2>You weren't the only black kid or there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like five in</v>

139
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.330
<v Speaker 3>a school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

140
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 3>I can't hide going through buds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was the only black you can't hide.</v>

141
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:04.783
<v Speaker 3>But I started realizing just because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked different than you allow you my </v>

142
00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:08.234
<v Speaker 3>first can hard either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it started giving me courage to </v>

143
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:11.990
<v Speaker 3>watching people that were all have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

144
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:14.210
<v Speaker 3>We all have a jacked up life in one way </v>
<v Speaker 3>or another.</v>

145
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.490
<v Speaker 3>Some of us don't have the guts to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it though.</v>

146
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 3>And that's where I found the guts to </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about mine.</v>

147
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:19.783
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some this purity in physical </v>

148
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 3>pursuits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

149
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:24.650
<v Speaker 3>Because it doesn't matter what your </v>
<v Speaker 3>social status is.</v>

150
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:27.110
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter how people perceive </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

151
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.680
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

152
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 3>when it comes down to how long can you </v>
<v Speaker 3>stay in that pool,</v>

153
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:32.480
<v Speaker 3>when it comes down to how far can you </v>
<v Speaker 3>run,</v>

154
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.443
<v Speaker 3>when it comes down to how much can you </v>
<v Speaker 3>push yourself past the part where you </v>

155
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 3>want to quit or how far can you keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>going?</v>

156
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 3>There's a purity in that that it did </v>
<v Speaker 3>dissolve social order,</v>

157
00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:46.100
<v Speaker 3>all that bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the what people think about you goes</v>

158
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:47.050
<v Speaker 3>out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what?</v>

159
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.240
<v Speaker 3>Who are you right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right for you right now?</v>

160
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.470
<v Speaker 3>That's a true statement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

161
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.363
<v Speaker 3>and I look at it as psychological </v>
<v Speaker 3>warfare and that's where I started </v>

162
00:06:56.391 --> 00:06:57.224
<v Speaker 3>learning that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That life is one big psychological </v>

163
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:01.910
<v Speaker 3>warfare that you play on yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You play on yourself,</v>

164
00:07:01.911 --> 00:07:04.490
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The most important conversation ever had</v>

165
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.750
<v Speaker 3>is with myself and that Shit I'll tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>him myself was so fucked up.</v>

166
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.613
<v Speaker 3>It was so wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so misguided and other people </v>

167
00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Speaker 3>start to write that dialogue for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

168
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.090
<v Speaker 3>it starts to be what you say to yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>every single day,</v>

169
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 3>and I started creating a whole nother </v>
<v Speaker 3>warfare.</v>

170
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.220
<v Speaker 3>A whole nother battle started becoming </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

171
00:07:22.221 --> 00:07:22.941
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hang on a second.</v>

172
00:07:22.941 --> 00:07:25.580
<v Speaker 3>Goggins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have these tools,</v>

173
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.870
<v Speaker 3>do you have these tools?</v>

174
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:27.703
<v Speaker 3>Your life was basically the perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the perfect grounds for training for </v>

175
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:34.640
<v Speaker 3>where you need to go in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the beatings,</v>

176
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:36.980
<v Speaker 3>all the other bullying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that you know,</v>

177
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:39.800
<v Speaker 3>you going through a learning disability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the struggles.</v>

178
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.903
<v Speaker 3>It was an absolute perfect training </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground for you to go to where you need </v>

179
00:07:43.401 --> 00:07:44.234
<v Speaker 3>to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's how I started looking at my </v>

180
00:07:45.411 --> 00:07:47.900
<v Speaker 3>life versus woe is me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Poopy pants.</v>

181
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.090
<v Speaker 3>Kick a rock down the street mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

182
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God just hooked you right the fuck up.</v>

183
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.790
<v Speaker 3>He hooked you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Write up man with the perfect place.</v>

184
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.310
<v Speaker 3>You were training for the first 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>

185
00:07:58.311 --> 00:07:59.990
<v Speaker 3>20.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you were training for this stuff.</v>

186
00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:02.120
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the advantage of everybody else</v>

187
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.360
<v Speaker 3>versus my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're so above me.</v>

188
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.080
<v Speaker 3>They came from a great family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mom and dad love them.</v>

189
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.910
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have learned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they started.</v>

190
00:08:10.911 --> 00:08:11.744
<v Speaker 3>They didn't struggle.</v>

191
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.801
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

192
00:08:12.801 --> 00:08:15.410
<v Speaker 3>you're struggle is what made you who you</v>
<v Speaker 3>are now.</v>

193
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.110
<v Speaker 3>So I started flipping this into a whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

194
00:08:18.111 --> 00:08:20.900
<v Speaker 3>I started being a master of what I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>scared of.</v>

195
00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:21.734
<v Speaker 3>I was scared of my mind and I became a </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally a master of that mind and </v>

196
00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:29.210
<v Speaker 3>that's what now from now on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sets me apart from most people.</v>

197
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.340
<v Speaker 3>I started diving into that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

198
00:08:31.341 --> 00:08:32.174
<v Speaker 3>that is a big part of the stories when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go over your childhood and you know </v>

199
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.213
<v Speaker 3>your abusive father and then having this</v>
<v Speaker 3>great guy that was going to become your </v>

200
00:08:40.551 --> 00:08:44.270
<v Speaker 3>step dad and then he gets murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like right when you're about to get</v>

201
00:08:44.271 --> 00:08:46.100
<v Speaker 3>out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything looks good.</v>

202
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.930
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he gets murdered.</v>

203
00:08:47.931 --> 00:08:48.764
<v Speaker 3>It's like these things really did sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of set you up to start from scratch </v>

204
00:08:52.191 --> 00:08:53.540
<v Speaker 3>again and just go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

205
00:08:53.541 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 3>Roger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we start from scratch and now</v>

206
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:56.843
<v Speaker 1>you have that attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You developed it through all of these </v>

207
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.970
<v Speaker 1>horrible personal experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the trials and tribulations,</v>

208
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:03.804
<v Speaker 1>all the evil shit that people try to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you that sort of set you up to be </v>

209
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:10.260
<v Speaker 1>able to deal in a way that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can't.</v>

210
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

211
00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.283
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to look at my life from a </v>

212
00:09:13.031 --> 00:09:17.470
<v Speaker 3>different vantage point and when you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're in all the muck and you just</v>

213
00:09:17.471 --> 00:09:20.080
<v Speaker 3>walk in and muck and walk in and muck </v>
<v Speaker 3>and walk in and Muck,</v>

214
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.083
<v Speaker 3>you don't see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look off to the fucking left of </v>

215
00:09:24.341 --> 00:09:25.570
<v Speaker 3>the muck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a sidewalk,</v>

216
00:09:25.571 --> 00:09:27.220
<v Speaker 3>brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get off,</v>

217
00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.140
<v Speaker 3>get off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have your head down.</v>

218
00:09:29.141 --> 00:09:31.680
<v Speaker 3>Looking at this book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once I saw the sidewalk,</v>

219
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.510
<v Speaker 3>the sidewalk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a little break and I got different</v>

220
00:09:34.511 --> 00:09:37.480
<v Speaker 3>vantage point and then from the sidewalk</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found a cliff.</v>

221
00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.343
<v Speaker 3>Then I found a mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got way up high on top of my life and </v>

222
00:09:39.851 --> 00:09:41.170
<v Speaker 3>look back down on it and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

223
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.680
<v Speaker 3>I gotta figure this out man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going anywhere.</v>

224
00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:46.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm starting.</v>

225
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.990
<v Speaker 3>So when you have a messed up foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started lying about everything.</v>

226
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.823
<v Speaker 3>I wanted people to like me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to be accepted in some society </v>

227
00:09:53.711 --> 00:09:55.600
<v Speaker 3>of life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some social society,</v>

228
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.070
<v Speaker 3>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

229
00:09:57.071 --> 00:09:58.940
<v Speaker 3>this isn't the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I messed up here.</v>

230
00:09:58.941 --> 00:10:00.370
<v Speaker 3>I messed up here and messed up </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

231
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.430
<v Speaker 3>And so I realized the worst thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened to me,</v>

232
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.353
<v Speaker 3>I lost myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never had myself and ever found </v>

233
00:10:05.921 --> 00:10:07.720
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no self esteem,</v>

234
00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:12.010
<v Speaker 3>so I knew through working out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>through learning God,</v>

235
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.510
<v Speaker 3>it took a lot for me to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

236
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:14.733
<v Speaker 3>I started finding self esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once I found that that's when doors </v>

237
00:10:17.411 --> 00:10:18.370
<v Speaker 3>started opening up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started.</v>

238
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:22.300
<v Speaker 3>I stopped caring about people that what </v>
<v Speaker 3>they thought being judged.</v>

239
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.350
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I say this,</v>

240
00:10:23.351 --> 00:10:25.420
<v Speaker 3>if I started right now or you can make </v>
<v Speaker 3>fun of me,</v>

241
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:28.990
<v Speaker 3>I stopped caring about that and that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>my life started really changing for me.</v>

242
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:29.893
<v Speaker 1>Slowly but surely that that's such an </v>
<v Speaker 1>important point where you're talking </v>

243
00:10:33.081 --> 00:10:33.914
<v Speaker 1>about the working out because a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people when they think about working </v>

244
00:10:35.931 --> 00:10:36.764
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're thinking of it as being a </v>

245
00:10:36.921 --> 00:10:38.010
<v Speaker 1>physical thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

246
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

247
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.660
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did it for mental.</v>

248
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are saying my God like,</v>

249
00:10:42.341 --> 00:10:43.450
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

250
00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.700
<v Speaker 3>don't look at it like I didn't care </v>
<v Speaker 3>about losing weight.</v>

251
00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:47.470
<v Speaker 3>I didn't care about being the fastest </v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

252
00:10:47.471 --> 00:10:49.060
<v Speaker 3>I came out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't making the Olympics.</v>

253
00:10:49.061 --> 00:10:51.550
<v Speaker 3>I won't go into pros.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could barely read and write.</v>

254
00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:54.550
<v Speaker 3>When I was a junior in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't going anywhere.</v>

255
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.990
<v Speaker 3>I saw working out as a way for me to </v>
<v Speaker 3>build calluses on my mind.</v>

256
00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.840
<v Speaker 3>I had a callous over the victim's </v>
<v Speaker 3>mentality,</v>

257
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.350
<v Speaker 3>so I watched these movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

258
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.213
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked about rocky last time I was </v>

259
00:11:05.711 --> 00:11:06.544
<v Speaker 3>down here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always equated training to mental </v>

260
00:11:10.721 --> 00:11:13.360
<v Speaker 3>toughening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it was a brutal.</v>

261
00:11:13.361 --> 00:11:15.460
<v Speaker 3>People waking up early and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All these things,</v>

262
00:11:15.461 --> 00:11:16.600
<v Speaker 3>they look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looked horrible.</v>

263
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.471
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow man,</v>

264
00:11:17.471 --> 00:11:19.570
<v Speaker 3>I got started doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not to get better,</v>

265
00:11:19.571 --> 00:11:22.270
<v Speaker 3>bigger and stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that is what's going to build me.</v>

266
00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:25.990
<v Speaker 3>That looks uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that looks brutal and getting up early.</v>

267
00:11:25.991 --> 00:11:26.824
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So maybe this long list of things I </v>

268
00:11:29.031 --> 00:11:32.410
<v Speaker 3>don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And through that I found myself,</v>

269
00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.150
<v Speaker 3>I started like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

270
00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.010
<v Speaker 3>you guys aren't doing this shit in high </v>
<v Speaker 3>school,</v>

271
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.980
<v Speaker 3>you guys are getting up at 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning running over here in this</v>

272
00:11:38.981 --> 00:11:39.814
<v Speaker 3>golf course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I started seeing myself very </v>

273
00:11:41.681 --> 00:11:43.630
<v Speaker 3>differently than the average human </v>
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>

274
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:44.740
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold on a second.</v>

275
00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:46.323
<v Speaker 3>I have some they don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's when I started to develop </v>

276
00:11:48.671 --> 00:11:53.671
<v Speaker 3>these things through working out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was this great never ending ethic and</v>

277
00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:56.620
<v Speaker 3>through work ethic are developed self </v>
<v Speaker 3>esteem.</v>

278
00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:57.390
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

279
00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:58.223
<v Speaker 1>is this something that you learned?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this something you learn yourself </v>

280
00:12:00.961 --> 00:12:01.794
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from exercise yourself or is it </v>

281
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:07.260
<v Speaker 1>something you read or heard about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what made you equate this,</v>

282
00:12:07.261 --> 00:12:10.590
<v Speaker 1>doing this and doing these difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>things physically to mental toughness to</v>

283
00:12:10.591 --> 00:12:11.424
<v Speaker 1>being this is the discipline that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need in order to get your life out of </v>

284
00:12:13.891 --> 00:12:14.760
<v Speaker 1>the situation you're in.</v>

285
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:16.230
<v Speaker 3>So I never read anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

286
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.440
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could barely read,</v>

287
00:12:17.441 --> 00:12:19.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I wasn't reading back then.</v>

288
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.003
<v Speaker 3>I just saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched a lot of movies and I was </v>

289
00:12:23.231 --> 00:12:24.064
<v Speaker 3>really big individualization and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>always equated working out to struggle </v>

290
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.040
<v Speaker 3>and I struggled my whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I ran from it.</v>

291
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:34.780
<v Speaker 3>So I started realizing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

292
00:12:34.781 --> 00:12:35.614
<v Speaker 3>I got to start facing the struggle and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to be mentally strong for the </v>

293
00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:38.614
<v Speaker 3>struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I started coming up with </v>

294
00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:43.480
<v Speaker 3>like I'm training for life mentally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm training for life.</v>

295
00:12:43.481 --> 00:12:44.314
<v Speaker 3>I'm not training for like to lift 400 </v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds and I found out on my own pretty </v>

296
00:12:48.431 --> 00:12:51.100
<v Speaker 3>much is that through this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through through discipline,</v>

297
00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:54.760
<v Speaker 3>through self discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through repetition to tons of repetition</v>

298
00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:56.800
<v Speaker 3>of the same thing that you don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>

299
00:12:56.801 --> 00:12:57.790
<v Speaker 3>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the key thing.</v>

300
00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.490
<v Speaker 3>Through repetition of things you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to do.</v>

301
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:01.683
<v Speaker 3>You develop mental,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like like an armor for your mind starts </v>

302
00:13:05.491 --> 00:13:06.730
<v Speaker 3>to armor your mind cut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

303
00:13:06.731 --> 00:13:08.170
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we suffer.</v>

304
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.950
<v Speaker 3>We suffer every day for what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do stuff that sucks every day.</v>

305
00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:12.784
<v Speaker 3>So then when the suck stuff comes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're ready for it and that's how it </v>

306
00:13:16.081 --> 00:13:16.914
<v Speaker 3>started coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just started being very uncomfortable </v>

307
00:13:18.261 --> 00:13:19.900
<v Speaker 3>and now I'm a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a way of life.</v>

308
00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.690
<v Speaker 3>It's a crazy thing to figure out though.</v>

309
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:23.583
<v Speaker 1>It's like the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You figured it out and you didn't just </v>

310
00:13:24.701 --> 00:13:26.110
<v Speaker 1>figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You embraced it.</v>

311
00:13:26.111 --> 00:13:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Like when you were talking about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>senior year of high school,</v>

312
00:13:28.481 --> 00:13:31.000
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about your mere </v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

313
00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:34.060
<v Speaker 1>your accountability mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you had a radical shift,</v>

314
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:39.280
<v Speaker 1>like you just decided to not be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking loser and to start tightening up</v>

315
00:13:39.281 --> 00:13:41.210
<v Speaker 1>and start holding yourself accountable </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

316
00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.030
<v Speaker 1>and get ready for things.</v>

317
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.510
<v Speaker 3>So I had this my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if people believe in God or</v>

318
00:13:47.511 --> 00:13:48.890
<v Speaker 3>what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what you believe in.</v>

319
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.140
<v Speaker 3>There's been this unrelenting voice in </v>
<v Speaker 3>my head.</v>

320
00:13:51.141 --> 00:13:51.974
<v Speaker 3>We all have this voice is the right or </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong voice and a lot of times that </v>

321
00:13:55.941 --> 00:14:00.770
<v Speaker 3>voice guides us into comfort and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>voice got it mean to comfort a lot.</v>

322
00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.950
<v Speaker 3>But I had this other voice I heard my </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole life saying,</v>

323
00:14:03.951 --> 00:14:05.210
<v Speaker 3>hey motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

324
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.730
<v Speaker 3>No Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we gotta go over here.</v>

325
00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:09.023
<v Speaker 3>We have go over here to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to that rockpile over in the fucking </v>

326
00:14:11.091 --> 00:14:14.630
<v Speaker 3>corner where nobody's at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where victories at.</v>

327
00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:16.003
<v Speaker 3>We're over in that corner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this voice was giving me all these </v>

328
00:14:18.501 --> 00:14:20.930
<v Speaker 3>answers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not I wasn't real smart kid growing up,</v>

329
00:14:20.931 --> 00:14:21.764
<v Speaker 3>but I had this crazy voice in my head </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying over there is where the fucking </v>

330
00:14:25.611 --> 00:14:26.444
<v Speaker 3>answers are and I will listen to it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because over there was pain over there </v>

331
00:14:29.601 --> 00:14:30.434
<v Speaker 3>with me looking in the mirror over there</v>
<v Speaker 3>was me being accountable for all these </v>

332
00:14:32.571 --> 00:14:33.404
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went through my life even though </v>

333
00:14:34.131 --> 00:14:34.964
<v Speaker 3>people put 'em on me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not mine to own and I didn't want </v>

334
00:14:37.191 --> 00:14:38.024
<v Speaker 3>to go over there by myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I had to in his voice was guiding </v>

335
00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:42.200
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is God,</v>

336
00:14:42.201 --> 00:14:44.390
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what.</v>

337
00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.380
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was in me.</v>

338
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:49.510
<v Speaker 1>It does just what you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you separate yourself from your ego</v>

339
00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:52.370
<v Speaker 1>and what you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your insecurities and all you like.</v>

340
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.383
<v Speaker 1>If you were giving yourself advice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would say that's what the thing is </v>

341
00:14:56.391 --> 00:14:57.224
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you think that's what it was like </v>

342
00:14:58.221 --> 00:14:59.770
<v Speaker 1>your subconscious or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

343
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.110
<v Speaker 1>you stripped away from all the bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he couldn't lie to yourself because</v>

344
00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:04.220
<v Speaker 1>it's a voice in your head.</v>

345
00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:07.150
<v Speaker 3>Exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly it because it knew.</v>

346
00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:08.043
<v Speaker 3>It knew I was a character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to find myself through her </v>

347
00:15:10.961 --> 00:15:11.794
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was making different hairstyles and </v>

348
00:15:13.031 --> 00:15:16.660
<v Speaker 3>sagging my pants and I was off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was off,</v>

349
00:15:16.661 --> 00:15:17.494
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

350
00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.890
<v Speaker 3>I was a clown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a clown and I was like,</v>

351
00:15:20.891 --> 00:15:21.724
<v Speaker 3>this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not what you're supposed to be </v>

352
00:15:23.201 --> 00:15:24.034
<v Speaker 3>in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

353
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.943
<v Speaker 3>And it's ugly when you look in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>dirty mirror and you're trying to do a </v>

354
00:15:27.431 --> 00:15:29.470
<v Speaker 3>new hairstyle to go to school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

355
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.710
<v Speaker 3>I had the hairstyle one time where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>shaved the top of my head.</v>

356
00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.570
<v Speaker 3>Not old men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had the hair,</v>

357
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.320
<v Speaker 3>like leaving their.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

358
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.473
<v Speaker 3>So I went to school with hair on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>side of my head and in my back and I </v>

359
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.360
<v Speaker 3>shaved the whole top of my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

360
00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.910
<v Speaker 3>I went to school like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

361
00:15:45.911 --> 00:15:49.160
<v Speaker 3>and then I'd had like with what did the </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids say I want that.</v>

362
00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what it said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was just a funny dude,</v>

363
00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:53.530
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was my thing.</v>

364
00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:54.813
<v Speaker 3>I was the funny dude that came into </v>
<v Speaker 3>school like criss cross came out and I </v>

365
00:15:57.791 --> 00:15:59.800
<v Speaker 3>was in high school so my pants are </v>
<v Speaker 3>backwards.</v>

366
00:15:59.801 --> 00:16:02.920
<v Speaker 3>That's my pants backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sag down past my ass,</v>

367
00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:03.754
<v Speaker 3>crack short term backwards with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>toothbrush in my mouth with the reverse </v>

368
00:16:07.541 --> 00:16:08.374
<v Speaker 3>part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reverse part is your head is shaved and </v>

369
00:16:10.121 --> 00:16:10.954
<v Speaker 3>you have some hair on top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a little piece of hair versus like </v>

370
00:16:13.991 --> 00:16:17.470
<v Speaker 3>a like a part two here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The part was on a bald head,</v>

371
00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.020
<v Speaker 3>so it was just I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

372
00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:20.973
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was sitting at home instead of </v>

373
00:16:21.911 --> 00:16:22.744
<v Speaker 3>studying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would think about what can I do to </v>

374
00:16:24.701 --> 00:16:29.701
<v Speaker 3>impress the motherfucker at school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why that became my life and that is,</v>

375
00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:30.753
<v Speaker 3>is a long road to hoe to get to the guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>who says now you never smile on any </v>

376
00:16:34.571 --> 00:16:35.110
<v Speaker 3>podcasts.</v>

377
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.060
<v Speaker 3>Look so serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at that shit.</v>

378
00:16:37.061 --> 00:16:37.894
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mother fuckers have no idea who I </v>

379
00:16:40.331 --> 00:16:40.780
<v Speaker 3>am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who,</v>

380
00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.480
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I've come from to get here today.</v>

381
00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:44.523
<v Speaker 3>You could have probably been an </v>
<v Speaker 3>entertainer like you probably because </v>

382
00:16:46.931 --> 00:16:48.730
<v Speaker 3>you were doing all that kind of share </v>
<v Speaker 3>some jokes.</v>

383
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.340
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do.</v>

384
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.310
<v Speaker 3>So what people read in this book can </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt me.</v>

385
00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.260
<v Speaker 3>It's a sad story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a horrible story.</v>

386
00:16:56.261 --> 00:16:58.540
<v Speaker 3>It's a tragic story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a story that made me who I am day,</v>

387
00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.930
<v Speaker 3>but you have to learn to laugh at </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself too once you,</v>

388
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:06.110
<v Speaker 3>once you go through that shit I now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of parts in there was a</v>

389
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:08.350
<v Speaker 3>of media gets a lot of white people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

390
00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:12.850
<v Speaker 3>and I have a routine that I won't do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people who hire me to speak,</v>

391
00:17:12.851 --> 00:17:14.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to do the routine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I often do it.</v>

392
00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.580
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was at 36 black guy to go through seal</v>

393
00:17:18.581 --> 00:17:19.750
<v Speaker 3>training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

394
00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:20.973
<v Speaker 3>Out of how many people out of probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at probably 1112 to make it </v>

395
00:17:25.901 --> 00:17:28.330
<v Speaker 3>through probably 13,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>seals.</v>

396
00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.050
<v Speaker 3>I'll probably the 36,</v>
<v Speaker 3>36 black.</v>

397
00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:32.830
<v Speaker 3>I'd make it through and over since like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

398
00:17:32.831 --> 00:17:33.970
<v Speaker 3>like the 19 forties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

399
00:17:33.971 --> 00:17:35.920
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at almost 70 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:36.611
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

401
00:17:36.611 --> 00:17:37.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

402
00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.220
<v Speaker 3>do the math on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's not a lot of black guys.</v>

403
00:17:39.221 --> 00:17:42.670
<v Speaker 3>And so I take that and then make a nice </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy skit out of that Shit.</v>

404
00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:43.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

405
00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:44.753
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the first time they tied me up and </v>

406
00:17:45.791 --> 00:17:47.050
<v Speaker 3>threw me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called drown proofing.</v>

407

416
00:18:03.961 --> 00:18:06.960
<v Speaker 3>with fucking brick on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was just losing my fucking mind.</v>

417
00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.780
<v Speaker 3>So if somebody had to get over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and I found humor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found humor in my suffering.</v>

420
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:14.550
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker,</v>

<v Speaker 3>what are you doing out here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Goggins like this is crazy.</v>

422
00:18:17.311 --> 00:18:18.144
<v Speaker 3>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're literally trying to reinvent the </v>

423
00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:22.500
<v Speaker 3>wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was trying to reinvent my mind.</v>

424
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:24.083
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to reinvent my mind and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>used every single tactic possible to do </v>

425
00:18:27.781 --> 00:18:29.370
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to live,</v>

426
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.353
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>live in this world where I was a fake </v>

427
00:18:31.591 --> 00:18:34.860
<v Speaker 3>human being anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was tired of blaming everybody for</v>

428
00:18:34.861 --> 00:18:36.750
<v Speaker 3>where I was at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad beat me.</v>

429
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:37.411
<v Speaker 3>This happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

430
00:18:37.411 --> 00:18:38.900
<v Speaker 3>my dad ran prostitutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

431
00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.610
<v Speaker 3>My Dad literally snatched the soul out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of my mom,</v>

432
00:18:41.611 --> 00:18:42.444
<v Speaker 3>like my mom is still battling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like after my mom left my dad and this </v>

433
00:18:45.661 --> 00:18:46.494
<v Speaker 3>one I'll talk about in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she got married three times for a total </v>

434
00:18:49.411 --> 00:18:51.410
<v Speaker 3>of six months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

435
00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't go there and I'm going to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the guy she married.</v>

436
00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.430
<v Speaker 3>So this woman was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's beautiful.</v>

437
00:18:56.431 --> 00:18:57.720
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's so smart.</v>

438
00:18:57.721 --> 00:18:58.554
<v Speaker 3>All this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

439
00:18:58.770 --> 00:18:59.603
<v Speaker 3>This guy literally stripped her soul </v>
<v Speaker 3>away as a young kid watching it and I </v>

440
00:19:04.201 --> 00:19:06.900
<v Speaker 3>had no soul to begin with in my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my brother,</v>

441
00:19:06.901 --> 00:19:08.850
<v Speaker 3>he has a story that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he could write eight books,</v>

442
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:10.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

443
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:12.300
<v Speaker 3>my dad just came through in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>washed this all clean,</v>

444
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.430
<v Speaker 3>so to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

445
00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.160
<v Speaker 3>to come around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He died about four years ago.</v>

446
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.630
<v Speaker 3>Four or five years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not for sure.</v>

447
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.370
<v Speaker 3>I didn't go to the funeral,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I forgave him.</v>

448
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.400
<v Speaker 3>So I saw my dad through an eight year </v>
<v Speaker 3>old's eyes.</v>

449
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.253
<v Speaker 3>So we left when I was eight and then at </v>
<v Speaker 3>22 I went back to see him through a </v>

450
00:19:27.931 --> 00:19:30.120
<v Speaker 3>grown man's eyes and he was the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>person I remembered,</v>

451
00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.100
<v Speaker 3>but I had to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't live with hate,</v>

452
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.310
<v Speaker 3>you cannot move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As much as that guy tried to ruin all of</v>

453
00:19:37.311 --> 00:19:39.780
<v Speaker 3>our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where I came from.</v>

454
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.330
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have figured out the origin of where</v>

455
00:19:42.331 --> 00:19:45.060
<v Speaker 3>I started from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I was going back through my life</v>

456
00:19:45.061 --> 00:19:47.160
<v Speaker 3>trying to fix who I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucked up person,</v>

457
00:19:47.161 --> 00:19:47.994
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your knee hurts is usually not your </v>

458
00:19:50.851 --> 00:19:53.400
<v Speaker 3>fucking knee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hurting is something else man.</v>

459
00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:56.250
<v Speaker 3>Like it could be a tight quad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be the right leg,</v>

460
00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.213
<v Speaker 3>the left leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got found out the origin of where </v>

461
00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:01.440
<v Speaker 3>all this shit began and it was him.</v>

462
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:04.180
<v Speaker 3>So I had to go back to where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

463
00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.043
<v Speaker 3>my roots in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the origin of all this happened in </v>

464
00:20:06.241 --> 00:20:08.010
<v Speaker 3>his heart to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you make peace with them?</v>

465
00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.053
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big piece with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we didn't have a peaceful </v>

466
00:20:11.041 --> 00:20:11.940
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

467
00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:12.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

468
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.030
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we left very granual.</v>

469
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:14.880
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

470
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.910
<v Speaker 3>he's a vicious man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't vicious man.</v>

471
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.833
<v Speaker 3>I mean mid evil motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had become a medieval motherfucker </v>

472
00:20:23.161 --> 00:20:23.994
<v Speaker 3>that time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was 22 when I was a big boy and so I </v>

473
00:20:26.281 --> 00:20:28.710
<v Speaker 3>was no longer the guy who was afraid it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was now like,</v>

474
00:20:28.711 --> 00:20:30.720
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to kill you type of shit.</v>

475
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:31.973
<v Speaker 3>And we were sitting at Denny's after an </v>
<v Speaker 3>all night skate or whatever the hell he </v>

476
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:40.240
<v Speaker 3>owned bars and skating rinks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we were sitting down and we kinda</v>

477
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.093
<v Speaker 3>got into it and I was kind of left and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I had to make peace with it in </v>

478
00:20:44.161 --> 00:20:45.520
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

479
00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.500
<v Speaker 3>I could not hold onto that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hake is,</v>

480
00:20:47.501 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 3>hold on to that.</v>

481
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.813
<v Speaker 2>Hate was half the reason why I kept </v>
<v Speaker 2>falling into the same pattern of </v>

482
00:20:51.371 --> 00:20:52.204
<v Speaker 2>failing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to get out and start dumping off </v>

483
00:20:54.341 --> 00:20:58.030
<v Speaker 2>some baggage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had to start figuring out me through him</v>

484
00:20:58.031 --> 00:21:02.170
<v Speaker 2>and that's all he was there for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the origin of figure him out,</v>

485
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:03.143
<v Speaker 2>figure out why he was so evil to my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me and my brother and I to start </v>

486
00:21:06.401 --> 00:21:07.234
<v Speaker 2>studying him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of people have situations </v>

487
00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:12.460
<v Speaker 2>where someone does something and we all </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack that person,</v>

488
00:21:12.461 --> 00:21:13.540
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like on the media,</v>

489
00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.510
<v Speaker 2>if someone does something wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody now is fucking perfect.</v>

490
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.480
<v Speaker 2>And we now judged this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't judge them,</v>

491
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't judge anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I do is I started studying them.</v>

492
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.440
<v Speaker 2>Why did they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not in a judging way.</v>

493
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.690
<v Speaker 2>I want to learn from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what'd you get out of your dad?</v>

494
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:29.350
<v Speaker 2>I got to.</v>

495
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:30.700
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he grew up rough.</v>

496
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.860
<v Speaker 2>He had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was very insecure,</v>

497
00:21:32.861 --> 00:21:37.861
<v Speaker 2>had a lot of kids and his insecurities </v>
<v Speaker 2>just trickled over on to us.</v>

498
00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:42.790
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he jacked us up real good.</v>

499
00:21:42.791 --> 00:21:46.060
<v Speaker 2>But he never fixed himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you never fix yourself,</v>

500
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:50.260
<v Speaker 2>the next person in line is going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wrap and we're next in line,</v>

501
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

502
00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:55.070
<v Speaker 2>his first wife killed herself or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever happened and you know,</v>

503
00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:55.923
<v Speaker 2>got burned up in a house with some </v>
<v Speaker 2>craziness and his last stuff that goes </v>

504
00:21:58.151 --> 00:21:58.984
<v Speaker 2>on there that I didn't put in the book </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't feel like going to </v>

505
00:22:00.731 --> 00:22:01.840
<v Speaker 2>court,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

506
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:02.710
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

507
00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:03.380
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

508
00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.350
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was last have,</v>

509
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.513
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the great parts about this book </v>

510
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:09.003
<v Speaker 2>is that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you detail exactly what was going </v>

511
00:22:12.311 --> 00:22:13.144
<v Speaker 2>through your mind in terms of like your </v>
<v Speaker 2>weaknesses and how you had failed and </v>

512
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.423
<v Speaker 2>then you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just one time like you do the </v>

513
00:22:22.181 --> 00:22:23.014
<v Speaker 2>thing in high school where you get your </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit together and then you joined the </v>

514
00:22:26.621 --> 00:22:29.740
<v Speaker 2>military and then you wind up getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat again.</v>

515
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.903
<v Speaker 2>And then when you go you and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>lose what does 106 pounds in three </v>

516
00:22:33.941 --> 00:22:37.320
<v Speaker 2>months to two to qualify for seal </v>
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>

517
00:22:37.321 --> 00:22:38.154
<v Speaker 2>Seal training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

518
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.060
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

519
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.770
<v Speaker 2>Because we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized at that time,</v>

520
00:22:41.771 --> 00:22:42.604
<v Speaker 2>once again I failed again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought so when you're talking about </v>

521
00:22:45.041 --> 00:22:46.620
<v Speaker 2>is I took this as baptists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

522
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:48.370
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how to read and write </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much in high school.</v>

523
00:22:48.371 --> 00:22:49.204
<v Speaker 2>I was like a fourth grade reading level </v>
<v Speaker 2>after that test a few times and I </v>

524
00:22:52.841 --> 00:22:57.340
<v Speaker 2>finally passed it and when I passed it </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually drove my car to the,</v>

525
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.960
<v Speaker 2>to the Dag gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

526
00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:02.410
<v Speaker 2>airport and watch planes take off </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was like,</v>

527
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be on one of those planes </v>
<v Speaker 2>one day going to air force bootcamp.</v>

528
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.000
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>

529
00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:09.250
<v Speaker 2>I always fixed the things on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>surface.</v>

530
00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.150
<v Speaker 2>So if I couldn't read and write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn to read and write,</v>

531
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:13.303
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would always fix these things on a </v>

532
00:23:14.771 --> 00:23:15.604
<v Speaker 2>surface level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so whenever something hard was like </v>

533
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:19.763
<v Speaker 2>raised ugly head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have any kind of tools to </v>

534
00:23:22.451 --> 00:23:23.284
<v Speaker 2>handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I thought I fixed this already </v>

535
00:23:24.701 --> 00:23:25.990
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

536
00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.930
<v Speaker 2>I didn't go deep into the dungeon of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>soul to say,</v>

537
00:23:28.931 --> 00:23:30.940
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is making you a quitter?</v>

538
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.810
<v Speaker 2>What is making you a weak man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just making you afraid.</v>

539
00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.513
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why I kept on quitting and</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to start or not knowing how </v>

540
00:23:40.631 --> 00:23:41.464
<v Speaker 2>to get through hard times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I was telling people I'm </v>

541
00:23:43.691 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 2>not a theorist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just studied</v>

542
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.610
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

543
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:47.443
<v Speaker 3>I didn't study a fucking book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I literally put myself in a fire </v>

544
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.710
<v Speaker 3>repeatedly like a sword.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You put a sword in a fire repeatedly,</v>

545
00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.180
<v Speaker 3>repeatedly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you keep on doing that,</v>

546
00:23:56.181 --> 00:23:58.640
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get an ice sword and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep on beating it.</v>

547
00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.250
<v Speaker 3>You've got to beat the shit out of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what I am.</v>

548
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.010
<v Speaker 3>I became that much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

549
00:24:04.011 --> 00:24:05.480
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't quit.</v>

550
00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.300
<v Speaker 3>We got to figure out why you are this </v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy.</v>

551
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.540
<v Speaker 3>Why are you this pussy man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is wrong with you?</v>

552
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:12.374
<v Speaker 3>What's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I kept on putting a sore back in the </v>

553
00:24:14.211 --> 00:24:15.044
<v Speaker 3>deck on fire and I just beat it harder </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I beat it harder before I knew I </v>

554
00:24:19.101 --> 00:24:22.520
<v Speaker 3>started realizing hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alright ma'am.</v>

555
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.880
<v Speaker 3>The brain is starting to get hard to </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain is starting to get hard.</v>

556
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm no longer a theorist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm now a practitioner.</v>

557
00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:32.773
<v Speaker 3>I put it in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll add a second while I was sitting </v>

558
00:24:34.611 --> 00:24:37.760
<v Speaker 3>here because you can't dissect anything </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a normal environment.</v>

559
00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.310
<v Speaker 3>You can't dissect anything is 72 degree </v>
<v Speaker 3>weather.</v>

560
00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:44.060
<v Speaker 3>You must put it in the fucking freezer </v>
<v Speaker 3>and freeze the fuck out of it,</v>

561
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:46.090
<v Speaker 3>and then you dissect it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sector,</v>

562
00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.380
<v Speaker 3>when it's miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dissect the brain.</v>

563
00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.900
<v Speaker 3>We're all thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to get outta here,</v>

564
00:24:50.901 --> 00:24:51.734
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to get out of the fucking </v>

565
00:24:52.761 --> 00:24:55.280
<v Speaker 3>freezer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Opened the door and he said,</v>

566
00:24:55.281 --> 00:24:57.020
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five more seconds,</v>

567
00:24:57.021 --> 00:24:57.854
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five more seconds in the freezer and </v>

568
00:24:59.551 --> 00:25:00.384
<v Speaker 3>nationally you start to pick that brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>apart and that's where all this stuff </v>

569
00:25:02.871 --> 00:25:03.704
<v Speaker 3>did to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kept on putting myself back into the </v>

570
00:25:05.901 --> 00:25:06.734
<v Speaker 3>freezer or the fire in beaten the shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of myself mentally and physically </v>

571
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.990
<v Speaker 3>before I knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what happened.</v>

572
00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:16.453
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

573
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.830
<v Speaker 1>You said it's an interesting way to self</v>
<v Speaker 1>teach.</v>

574
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like most people that you know,</v>

575
00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:25.120
<v Speaker 1>you talk to that a discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

576

<v Speaker 3>We are so the house.</v>

594
00:26:12.611 --> 00:26:14.980
<v Speaker 3>I lived in Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York that got my ass beat every day.</v>

595
00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:16.083
<v Speaker 3>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We lived on Paradise Road and it was </v>

<v Speaker 3>anything but fucking paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I want you to go there with me.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You want to learn from me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me take your ass home.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So that's the whole thing about it,</v>

599
00:26:28.421 --> 00:26:32.290
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were scared to dive into our lives.</v>

600
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:35.260
<v Speaker 3>What made us who we are to beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

601
00:26:35.261 --> 00:26:37.990
<v Speaker 3>that we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all jacked up and so many ways.</v>

602
00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:41.320
<v Speaker 3>That's the beauty of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the beauty of me.</v>

603
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:44.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm jacked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I figured</v>

604
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.680
<v Speaker 1>out my own little process and how to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>on jacked up and how to.</v>

605
00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:48.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

606
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna get the same way you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get there.</v>

607
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:51.630
<v Speaker 1>You may get there by going point a to </v>
<v Speaker 1>point B.</v>

608
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:55.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get to point c to d to eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

609
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:57.690
<v Speaker 1>but I want to be there the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are just a little harder.</v>

610
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:00.630
<v Speaker 1>That's how I trained my brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was just different.</v>

611
00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.070
<v Speaker 1>It was different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different thinker.</v>

612
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:03.743
<v Speaker 1>When you stop and think about all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different times that you did have to </v>

613
00:27:07.411 --> 00:27:12.411
<v Speaker 1>reboot and how you found like new goals </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you found new inspiration,</v>

614
00:27:12.751 --> 00:27:13.584
<v Speaker 1>you fired up a new discipline and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>became stronger and harder and you've </v>

615
00:27:16.551 --> 00:27:21.090
<v Speaker 1>got one of the things that people always</v>
<v Speaker 1>look for in life.</v>

616
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.160
<v Speaker 1>They look for a point where they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest.</v>

617
00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:27.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to retire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People love.</v>

618
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.430
<v Speaker 1>They love that expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Golden.</v>

619
00:27:29.431 --> 00:27:33.230
<v Speaker 1>I love that expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love the.</v>

620
00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:36.270
<v Speaker 1>They love the idea of a struggle as long</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it ends,</v>

621
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:37.163
<v Speaker 1>and then when it ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a nice comfortable </v>

622
00:27:38.551 --> 00:27:39.450
<v Speaker 1>spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must.</v>

623
00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:42.930
<v Speaker 1>It must end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relax,</v>

624
00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.190
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've done so much.</v>

625
00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.710
<v Speaker 1>You've really done so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this.</v>

626
00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:50.820
<v Speaker 1>The idea of reaching this golden year </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

627
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.630
<v Speaker 1>is it's a very flawed idea because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>an idea that you're gonna,</v>

628
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:55.583
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you're going to reach the </v>

629
00:27:57.121 --> 00:27:57.954
<v Speaker 1>finish line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no finish line doesn't </v>

630
00:27:59.461 --> 00:28:01.890
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the scary thing about life,</v>

<v Speaker 1>my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a scary thing,</v>

632
00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:05.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what fatigues me.</v>

633
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:06.331
<v Speaker 1>People go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's no fucking in my friend.</v>

635
00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.190
<v Speaker 1>There's no end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no end.</v>

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.670
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal is evil man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

692
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:32.410
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started getting tightness in that when</v>

693
00:30:32.411 --> 00:30:33.244
<v Speaker 2>I was running a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'd never gotten tightness in that </v>

694
00:30:35.201 --> 00:30:37.570
<v Speaker 2>area before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like that's a running thing,</v>

695
00:30:37.571 --> 00:30:38.404
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a running thing and also a very </v>

696
00:30:39.341 --> 00:30:40.630
<v Speaker 2>stressed thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

697
00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:43.200
<v Speaker 2>if you're a real stressed out man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for me,</v>

698
00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:45.570
<v Speaker 2>I can talk about the origin were worth </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

699
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:47.590
<v Speaker 2>Start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My body was so wrapped tight,</v>

700
00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:51.970
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know where to start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I started with the PSOAS muscle,</v>

701
00:30:51.971 --> 00:30:52.804
<v Speaker 2>so that's a real good spot with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with these races is the problem </v>

702
00:30:56.081 --> 00:30:58.620
<v Speaker 2>with people like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem with these races,</v>

703
00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:00.950
<v Speaker 2>like if you get you and another you </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

704
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:02.200
<v Speaker 2>And they're in there together.</v>

705
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Like you motherfuckers are going to kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other so long day.</v>

706
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.920
<v Speaker 2>It's a long day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as long as this a lot.</v>

707
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:11.320
<v Speaker 2>Because if they're doing a last man </v>
<v Speaker 2>standing type of deal,</v>

708
00:31:11.321 --> 00:31:12.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

709
00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Like the first person to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

710
00:31:13.981 --> 00:31:15.940
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a real long day man.</v>

711
00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:18.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've been up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a couple of weeks under my belt,</v>

<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers don't know how to self </v>

715
00:31:24.141 --> 00:31:24.974
<v Speaker 2>motivate man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we'd like to put the headphones on </v>

<v Speaker 3>I talked about the one second decision a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot about what I went through my life,</v>

826
00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.210
<v Speaker 3>It's not the book itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which what's in the book?</v>

827
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.963
<v Speaker 3>It's what like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck if that sells one </v>

<v Speaker 3>your life in a journey you put yourself </v>

832
00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:37.563
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing more than that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all I want people to do is </v>

833
00:36:40.021 --> 00:36:44.550
<v Speaker 3>realize that you have to struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to struggle.</v>

834
00:36:44.551 --> 00:36:46.770
<v Speaker 3>The bigger the struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bigger the piece,</v>

835
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:49.230
<v Speaker 3>the bigger the suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more peace.</v>

836
00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:50.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not just saying this because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That biography is a very valuable.</v>

839
00:36:58.351 --> 00:36:59.184
<v Speaker 1>When you get to see the mindset of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who's done things that you </v>

840
00:37:01.651 --> 00:37:03.960
<v Speaker 1>haven't done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to understand like that.</v>

841
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:08.610
<v Speaker 1>They're overcoming sort of the same sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of situations in their mind that you are</v>

842
00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:11.790
<v Speaker 1>same insecurities and pitfalls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody's going through it.</v>

843

<v Speaker 3>everybody that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing I say.</v>

845
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:17.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm blessed that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that my story.</v>

846
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:19.373
<v Speaker 3>There's no color involved in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a human story about struggle and I </v>

847
00:37:23.401 --> 00:37:25.830
<v Speaker 3>happened to be in so many different </v>
<v Speaker 3>situations.</v>

848
00:37:25.831 --> 00:37:30.660
<v Speaker 3>There's so many people can relate to </v>
<v Speaker 3>about struggle that I guarantee you mark</v>

849
00:37:30.661 --> 00:37:31.860
<v Speaker 3>my word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you read that book.</v>

850
00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:36.450
<v Speaker 3>There will be a section of that book </v>
<v Speaker 3>that resonates with is hardcore.</v>

851
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:37.343
<v Speaker 3>It will make you think if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're not ready to think about your </v>

852
00:37:39.721 --> 00:37:40.554
<v Speaker 3>life and think about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know where you can be and think </v>

853
00:37:43.291 --> 00:37:45.660
<v Speaker 3>about what you haven't done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the book's not for you.</v>

854
00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:46.973
<v Speaker 3>If you're already ready to really self </v>
<v Speaker 3>reflect and hold yourself accountable </v>

855
00:37:49.381 --> 00:37:50.490
<v Speaker 3>for where you're at and where you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

856
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:52.340
<v Speaker 3>the book is not for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's real.</v>

857
00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:53.283
<v Speaker 1>I've read a lot of self help books and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've listened to a lot of self help </v>

858
00:37:56.201 --> 00:37:58.240
<v Speaker 1>books on tape too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of.</v>

859
00:37:58.330 --> 00:37:59.163
<v Speaker 1>There's some of them that I have to shut</v>
<v Speaker 1>off after to shut off a quarter way and </v>

860
00:38:02.081 --> 00:38:03.760
<v Speaker 1>I feel like someone's lying to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>

861
00:38:03.761 --> 00:38:05.920
<v Speaker 1>you're bullshitting me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just saying things.</v>

862
00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:08.850
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't resonate with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

863
00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.990
<v Speaker 1>it's not working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll give it a chance,</v>

864
00:38:10.991 --> 00:38:12.610
<v Speaker 1>I'll give it a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I'm,</v>

865
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:13.503
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half hour in two hours and it's still </v>

866
00:38:15.131 --> 00:38:17.170
<v Speaker 1>the same nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel anything.</v>

867
00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting itchy listening to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

868
00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.810
<v Speaker 1>I just want to pull the headphones off </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll just kill it.</v>

869
00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:25.300
<v Speaker 1>I'll stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the total opposite.</v>

870
00:38:25.301 --> 00:38:26.410
<v Speaker 1>This one man I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

871
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:30.900
<v Speaker 1>I was running extra mile so I could stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the headphones on and the.</v>

872
00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:31.923
<v Speaker 1>The thing that I think is gonna Happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this book is people going to get </v>

873
00:38:34.691 --> 00:38:35.020
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

874
00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:36.640
<v Speaker 1>They're going to get a hold of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's an audio book,</v>

875
00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:39.940
<v Speaker 1>the or the book book and they're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna recommend it and then it's</v>

876
00:38:39.941 --> 00:38:42.490
<v Speaker 1>going to spread like wildfire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a powerful book.</v>

877
00:38:42.491 --> 00:38:45.130
<v Speaker 1>This is a real self help book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

878
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:46.023
<v Speaker 1>this is a real one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's not like someone orchestrates </v>

879
00:38:50.111 --> 00:38:52.960
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing like what I'm gonna do </v>
<v Speaker 1>is I'm going to become a motivator.</v>

880
00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:54.423
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be a personal influencer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be that guy that goes out </v>

881
00:38:56.471 --> 00:38:57.304
<v Speaker 1>there and tells people you can optimize </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life and there's so many of those </v>

<v Speaker 3>most unauthentic motherfucker on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>

910
00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:15.680
<v Speaker 3>literally man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was 24 years old and a couch,</v>

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.480
<v Speaker 3>fat spraying for cockroaches eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>donuts and drinking milkshakes.</v>

912
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.333
<v Speaker 3>I did not plan on doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All I wanted to do with chance to </v>

913
00:40:23.051 --> 00:40:26.310
<v Speaker 3>fucking reflection in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to mirror this is all this</v>

914
00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:26.940
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

915
00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:28.530
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a byproduct of,</v>

916
00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:29.860
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

917
00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.110
<v Speaker 3>that's the funny thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's why it works though.</v>

921
00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:39.293
<v Speaker 1>It works because you really did do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really did do all those things and </v>

922
00:40:42.351 --> 00:40:47.210
<v Speaker 1>you show how you did it and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>using any bullshit theatrical jargon.</v>

923
00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:51.290
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not saying a bunch of buzz words.</v>

924
00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:54.170
<v Speaker 1>Can you live the life of an actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>person?</v>

925
00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:56.840
<v Speaker 1>I can show you how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you look into this guy talk and he's</v>

926
00:40:56.841 --> 00:41:01.580
<v Speaker 1>got a neck like a pencil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his body's just frail like you don't</v>

927
00:41:01.581 --> 00:41:03.740
<v Speaker 1>even understand adversity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand.</v>

928
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:04.783
<v Speaker 1>Overcoming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not the secret is involved in </v>

929
00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:10.380
<v Speaker 1>the law of fucking attraction attraction</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

930
00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.110
<v Speaker 1>This ain't no attraction here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

931
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:19.010
<v Speaker 1>This love nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is no nonsense,</v>

932
00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:21.350
<v Speaker 1>no nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a real self help book,</v>

933
00:41:21.351 --> 00:41:22.610
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the real deal.</v>

934
00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.593
<v Speaker 1>That's how you self help you self-help </v>
<v Speaker 1>by people who've done it and you learn </v>

935
00:41:26.031 --> 00:41:28.130
<v Speaker 1>what they did and you realize there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>shortcuts,</v>

936
00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:32.690
<v Speaker 1>and then you learn to embrace that no </v>
<v Speaker 1>shortcut mentality and enjoy.</v>

937
00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:36.980
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy the suffering and the grind of n </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we talked about earlier.</v>

938
00:41:36.981 --> 00:41:39.410
<v Speaker 1>There's no fucking finish line doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>

939
00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.410
<v Speaker 3>You know what's funny about that is I </v>
<v Speaker 3>have people now,</v>

940
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:44.390
<v Speaker 3>so when I was in the worst part of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

941
00:41:45.350 --> 00:41:46.183
<v Speaker 3>those people want to bring you back in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those people's like you can see who you </v>

942
00:41:49.311 --> 00:41:50.144
<v Speaker 3>hang out with like when you and your </v>
<v Speaker 3>worst and when you try to get better </v>

943
00:41:52.671 --> 00:41:53.504
<v Speaker 3>with what makes it hard to get better is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you are hanging around people who </v>

944
00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.190
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say you're an alcoholic,</v>

945
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:59.503
<v Speaker 3>you hanging around people who drink and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I say you want to stop drinking those </v>

946
00:42:02.901 --> 00:42:05.540
<v Speaker 3>people and to bring you back in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I used to be this guy,</v>

947
00:42:05.541 --> 00:42:06.570
<v Speaker 3>this guy who was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who you know,</v>

948
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:10.270
<v Speaker 3>who wasn't worth anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now those people who are still there,</v>

949
00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.200
<v Speaker 3>they're 16,</v>
<v Speaker 3>17,</v>

950
00:42:12.201 --> 00:42:13.100
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 years ago.</v>

951
00:42:13.101 --> 00:42:14.930
<v Speaker 3>They try and get you back there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the hardest part,</v>

952
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:16.220
<v Speaker 3>you got to see who you're hanging out </v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

953
00:42:16.221 --> 00:42:17.054
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

954
00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.750
<v Speaker 3>You gotta hang out with the people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to be like the most people will</v>

955
00:42:20.751 --> 00:42:21.720
<v Speaker 3>definitely dragged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

956
00:42:21.721 --> 00:42:22.554
<v Speaker 3>Jackie down and especially if you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>around someone that makes a lot of </v>

957
00:42:24.531 --> 00:42:26.900
<v Speaker 3>excuses and they're always failing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

958
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:27.783
<v Speaker 3>those is like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the opposite of inspiration </v>

959
00:42:30.231 --> 00:42:32.350
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a vacuum to suck in it,</v>

960
00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:33.920
<v Speaker 3>out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you doing today,</v>

961
00:42:33.921 --> 00:42:36.020
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you getting up against so early?</v>

962
00:42:36.021 --> 00:42:37.700
<v Speaker 3>Why are you doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you doing this?</v>

963
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:39.250
<v Speaker 3>The people you're hanging around with </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

964
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:42.170
<v Speaker 3>it will suck the fucking life out of you</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>

965
00:42:42.171 --> 00:42:43.970
<v Speaker 3>Just got to be alone with man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get your shit in,</v>

966
00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:44.923
<v Speaker 3>and then there's also people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>you going to be around that are always </v>

967
00:42:46.671 --> 00:42:50.180
<v Speaker 3>failing and always fucking up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they're always coming to you to</v>

968
00:42:50.181 --> 00:42:53.180
<v Speaker 3>try to get you to help them become a </v>
<v Speaker 3>giant burden.</v>

969
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.103
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never look in the mirror and get their </v>

970
00:42:55.311 --> 00:42:58.040
<v Speaker 3>own shit together and they're always </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking for external help.</v>

971
00:42:58.090 --> 00:42:59.900
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Always looking for a store.</v>

972
00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:03.020
<v Speaker 3>People don't want to go in deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Met All the answer inside of you.</v>

973
00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.680
<v Speaker 3>It's a very primitive way how I call </v>
<v Speaker 3>this book is written.</v>

974
00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:08.060
<v Speaker 3>It's primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

975
00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.980
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very barbarian.</v>

976
00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:10.853
<v Speaker 3>It's how we all think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's how it's how a man once walked the </v>

977
00:43:14.031 --> 00:43:17.410
<v Speaker 3>earth and then we'd get all soft and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these computers and shit.</v>

978
00:43:17.411 --> 00:43:18.244
<v Speaker 3>When we start going away from the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful thing we have is our fucking </v>

979
00:43:21.321 --> 00:43:24.190
<v Speaker 3>brain is our mind and we don't use </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

980
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:27.590
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like everything has to be so quick.</v>

981
00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:28.813
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You use your mind when it comes to </v>

982
00:43:29.661 --> 00:43:30.800
<v Speaker 1>certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

983
00:43:30.801 --> 00:43:33.620
<v Speaker 1>But what you're saying is you don't use </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind when it comes to.</v>

984
00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.010
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is it.</v>

985
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:38.080
<v Speaker 3>You can't google that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

986
00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:40.240
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me google how to suffer.</v>

987
00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:43.410
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that ain't gonna be in there.</v>

988
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.770
<v Speaker 3>They ain't gonna be in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be in there.</v>

989
00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.030
<v Speaker 3>It's not in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't exist.</v>

990
00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:52.600
<v Speaker 3>Find some water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll code.</v>

991
00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:53.533
<v Speaker 1>And what's interesting is that that is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind thing and people think of mine </v>

992
00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:00.690
<v Speaker 1>things they think of calculating </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics literature.</v>

993
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:01.311
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

994
00:44:01.311 --> 00:44:01.571
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

995
00:44:01.571 --> 00:44:01.851
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

996
00:44:01.851 --> 00:44:02.151
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

997
00:44:02.151 --> 00:44:03.160
<v Speaker 1>There's many aspects.</v>

998
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:04.900
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't overthink it.</v>

999
00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:07.480
<v Speaker 3>Don't overthink it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put your shoes on.</v>

1000
00:44:07.481 --> 00:44:08.314
<v Speaker 3>Lace them up.</v>

1001
00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:13.940
<v Speaker 1>So you got to do my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't overthink the process,</v>

1002
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:15.103
<v Speaker 1>but see what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you've overcome because you've </v>

1003
00:44:16.581 --> 00:44:17.414
<v Speaker 1>accomplished so much now that even when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk about that moment of like </v>

1004
00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:22.553
<v Speaker 1>embracing that suck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you see the biggest smile on your </v>

1005
00:44:25.881 --> 00:44:26.714
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you've got a total different </v>

1006
00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:30.890
<v Speaker 1>approach to it than the average person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The average.</v>

1007
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:32.063
<v Speaker 1>You talk to them</v>

1008
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:35.130
<v Speaker 3>about doing chin ups for 24 hours or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything fucking crazy.</v>

1009
00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:39.820
<v Speaker 3>They don't look like there's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A negative of doom feelings.</v>

1010
00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:40.680
<v Speaker 3>The thing about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1011
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:41.543
<v Speaker 3>I talk about my book openmindedness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What separates me from a lot of people </v>

1012
00:44:44.761 --> 00:44:49.500
<v Speaker 3>is they go into a daunting task in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>task is overwhelming.</v>

1013
00:44:49.501 --> 00:44:51.840
<v Speaker 3>Like when I heard the pull up records,</v>
<v Speaker 3>4,020</v>

1014
00:44:51.841 --> 00:44:53.880
<v Speaker 3>pull ups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not talking about breaking this record.</v>

1015
00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.370
<v Speaker 3>People are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

1016
00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:59.130
<v Speaker 3>I went right to a pen and paper like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

1017
00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:02.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing the math man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We talking about.</v>

1018
00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:03.173
<v Speaker 3>I'm open minded to the fact that okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I do five pull ups on the minute for </v>

1019
00:45:05.371 --> 00:45:08.190
<v Speaker 3>so many hours I can get 20 pull ups in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much time do you have to rest?</v>

1020
00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.233
<v Speaker 3>I was breaking the math down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be open minded to the </v>

1021
00:45:11.491 --> 00:45:13.140
<v Speaker 3>possibilities that I can do this.</v>

1022
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:14.273
<v Speaker 3>Once you shut your mind down to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility that it can be achieved is </v>

1023
00:45:16.441 --> 00:45:18.090
<v Speaker 3>no way can happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's my,</v>

1024
00:45:18.091 --> 00:45:18.924
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my eyes and my body light up about </v>

1025
00:45:20.161 --> 00:45:22.740
<v Speaker 3>things because I know that if you're in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a fight,</v>

1026
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:27.390
<v Speaker 3>you have to attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to keep attacking.</v>

1027
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:31.170
<v Speaker 3>The enemy has to know he is not going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>give up.</v>

1028
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.540
<v Speaker 3>You must break the soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the fuck is in front of you.</v>

1029
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:35.063
<v Speaker 3>That's what I realized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was never breaking the soul anything </v>

1030
00:45:37.021 --> 00:45:39.390
<v Speaker 3>in front of me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's why I came with a thing called</v>

1031
00:45:39.391 --> 00:45:40.650
<v Speaker 3>taking solos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In my book,</v>

1032
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:46.170
<v Speaker 3>I started to devise ways to break a soul</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a human being of a,</v>

1033
00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:47.110
<v Speaker 3>of an object,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1034
00:45:47.111 --> 00:45:49.950
<v Speaker 3>of whatever's in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If he keep on attacking something,</v>

1035
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:54.180
<v Speaker 3>nothing wants to stand in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that is relentless.</v>

1036
00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:55.943
<v Speaker 3>Nothing to taking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sole part of the book is really </v>

1037
00:45:58.591 --> 00:45:59.424
<v Speaker 3>interesting because you talked about </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the the mind shift that you had </v>

1038
00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:04.720
<v Speaker 3>when you were in bud's.</v>

1039
00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.000
<v Speaker 3>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>

1040
00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:08.670
<v Speaker 3>that's an intense part of the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it is a,</v>

1041
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:11.340
<v Speaker 3>that's when a lot of stuff started </v>
<v Speaker 3>clicking man.</v>

1042
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:14.190
<v Speaker 3>I started watching those instructors on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the side because you know,</v>

1043
00:46:14.191 --> 00:46:16.020
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's three shifts.</v>

1044
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.180
<v Speaker 3>There's eight instructors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three shifts because you know,</v>

1045
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.010
<v Speaker 3>the guy's going through through hell </v>
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>

1046
00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:22.830
<v Speaker 3>They're up all day and all night for her</v>
<v Speaker 3>and 30 hours.</v>

1047
00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:26.640
<v Speaker 3>This is the promise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Land of mental hardening for me.</v>

1048
00:46:26.641 --> 00:46:29.880
<v Speaker 3>I love this place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you have the instructors who,</v>

1049
00:46:29.881 --> 00:46:30.714
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>done that.</v>

1051
00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:35.010
<v Speaker 3>Now they're instructing you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they do the eight hour shift they had</v>

<v Speaker 3>beating the crap out of us.</v>

1054
00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.900
<v Speaker 3>And when I started realizing I started </v>
<v Speaker 3>playing mind games and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Take these motherfuckers souls.</v>

1081
00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:48.980
<v Speaker 3>So when they had us doing a simple thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that God's.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and it looked like someone had just </v>

1086
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:04.450
<v Speaker 3>fucked with their soul and I looked at </v>

<v Speaker 3>We were tagging.</v>

1096
00:48:24.461 --> 00:48:25.810
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you keep on doing that,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1100
00:48:33.491 --> 00:48:34.690
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can.</v>

1101
00:48:34.691 --> 00:48:37.090
<v Speaker 3>We just kept charging and we start </v>
<v Speaker 3>fueling off of that.</v>

1102
00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:39.070
<v Speaker 3>We started a few,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the fact that man,</v>

1103
00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:42.730
<v Speaker 3>it takes one second of energy to still </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's.</v>

1104
00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.680
<v Speaker 3>And then you have all the energy you </v>
<v Speaker 3>need.</v>

1105
00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:47.560
<v Speaker 3>So you need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to look at someone's eyes.</v>

1106
00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:48.633
<v Speaker 3>You know how it is when you fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody and you broke that </v>

1107
00:48:49.571 --> 00:48:50.830
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1108
00:48:50.831 --> 00:48:51.491
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1109
00:48:51.491 --> 00:48:54.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to go back to the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>round and you feel like my gut,</v>

1110
00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:55.143
<v Speaker 3>I can fight all day.</v>

1111
00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:59.410
<v Speaker 3>I can fight all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what taking Solos is,</v>

1112
00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:00.843
<v Speaker 3>but you have to have the will to heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>the courage to go that distance when </v>

1113
00:49:05.891 --> 00:49:06.724
<v Speaker 3>you're exactly jacked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have nothing left to give and give </v>

1114
00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:11.163
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is an interesting thing about the </v>

1115
00:49:12.971 --> 00:49:16.810
<v Speaker 3>mind is that you can find inspiration </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you find inspiration,</v>

1116
00:49:16.811 --> 00:49:19.240
<v Speaker 3>when you get charged up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the sudden you have energy.</v>

1117
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:20.440
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's right.</v>

1118
00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:23.200
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked about in the book also is about</v>

1119
00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:24.513
<v Speaker 3>I learned how to control my adrenals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you know how you know how you get </v>

1120
00:49:29.261 --> 00:49:33.170
<v Speaker 3>that fight or flight response when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>get to move real quick and you know,</v>

1121
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:35.320
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started learning the mind a lot.</v>

1122
00:49:35.321 --> 00:49:36.154
<v Speaker 3>How to get myself jacked extremely fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in a horrible environment where </v>

1123
00:49:40.871 --> 00:49:44.380
<v Speaker 3>everybody's miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've learned how to really find strength</v>

1124
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:47.110
<v Speaker 3>in the misery when everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffering.</v>

1125
00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:50.800
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's all poopy pants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their mentalities down and everything.</v>

1126
00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.890
<v Speaker 3>I started just like my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is where I shine,</v>

1127
00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:55.333
<v Speaker 3>and I started using all that misery for </v>
<v Speaker 3>tons and tons of tons of drive and </v>

1128
00:50:00.071 --> 00:50:00.904
<v Speaker 3>motivation to to to then lead people </v>
<v Speaker 3>further because you can get a lot of </v>

1129
00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:08.020
<v Speaker 3>power through misery and once people see</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1130
00:50:08.021 --> 00:50:10.930
<v Speaker 3>my God goggins is fucking going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then everybody says,</v>

1131
00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:11.823
<v Speaker 3>Roger that let me get my shit and go to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I started realizing that if you can </v>

1132
00:50:16.871 --> 00:50:19.060
<v Speaker 3>just find strength just a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>longer,</v>

1133
00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:20.253
<v Speaker 3>you'll have a crew of people following </v>
<v Speaker 3>you along the way and that is another </v>

1134
00:50:23.441 --> 00:50:26.710
<v Speaker 3>thing that no one can ever teach you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's you.</v>

1135
00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have to learn that on </v>
<v Speaker 3>your</v>

1136
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:28.873
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to figure out how </v>

1137
00:50:29.811 --> 00:50:32.870
<v Speaker 2>to pull that energy out of your mind on </v>
<v Speaker 2>your own.</v>

1138
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:35.420
<v Speaker 2>There's not this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no book.</v>

1139
00:50:35.421 --> 00:50:37.100
<v Speaker 2>You can read the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden I have it.</v>

1140
00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.960
<v Speaker 2>I've got the technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I know how to do it.</v>

1141
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:44.000
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a grind that you have to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>and finish on your own.</v>

1142
00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:45.013
<v Speaker 2>You have to take great pleasure in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that no one wants to be with the </v>

1143
00:50:47.891 --> 00:50:50.420
<v Speaker 2>fuck you're at right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great pleasure in.</v>

1144
00:50:50.421 --> 00:50:53.040
<v Speaker 2>That almost makes it has to bring a </v>
<v Speaker 2>passion.</v>

1145
00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:57.770
<v Speaker 2>Nadia has to bring something very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very weird audio man like you know,</v>

1146
00:50:57.771 --> 00:50:59.330
<v Speaker 2>people don't really understand what that</v>

1147

1159
00:51:23.011 --> 00:51:28.011
<v Speaker 2>talked about it a little bit in the book</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and I have sickle cell trait and a</v>

1160
00:51:28.251 --> 00:51:29.084
<v Speaker 2>young kid just died from Rhabdo from </v>
<v Speaker 2>sickle cell is not a good thing </v>

1161
00:51:32.751 --> 00:51:34.100
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1162
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:36.680
<v Speaker 2>and you grabbed those a bad thing for </v>
<v Speaker 2>having sickle cell.</v>

1163
00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:39.380
<v Speaker 2>You have sickle cell trait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have the disease will have</v>

1164
00:51:39.381 --> 00:51:40.214
<v Speaker 2>the disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A buddy of mine died from it when I was </v>

1165
00:51:41.541 --> 00:51:42.374
<v Speaker 2>a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1166
00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:43.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

1167
00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.470
<v Speaker 2>I used to fight with Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>train with.</v>

1168
00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was always sick.</v>

1169
00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:49.420
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to get sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is horrible.</v>

1170
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:50.263
<v Speaker 2>Be Gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be out of the gym for months and </v>

1171
00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:55.140
<v Speaker 2>come back and he'd just be trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>his body back in shape again.</v>

1172
00:51:56.110 --> 00:52:00.770
<v Speaker 2>Anyone up dying is a talented guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you got it,</v>

1173
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:03.890
<v Speaker 2>what did you have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they put me in hospital for awhile.</v>

1174
00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:05.323
<v Speaker 2>That's when my hand got real messed up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and my fluids were extremely low and I </v>

1175
00:52:09.291 --> 00:52:13.510
<v Speaker 2>had done like 300 pull ups and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1176
00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.080
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body is wrapped up.</v>

1177
00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:16.970
<v Speaker 2>We just not drinking water while you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>

1178
00:52:16.971 --> 00:52:21.320
<v Speaker 2>I was drinking water but not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was sipping this carbohydrate drink</v>

1179
00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:25.130
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my calories are extremely low.</v>

1180
00:52:25.131 --> 00:52:26.630
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how much I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>burn through.</v>

1181
00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:28.850
<v Speaker 2>And you burn through an awful lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>calories,</v>

1182
00:52:28.851 --> 00:52:29.331
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doing that.</v>

1183
00:52:29.331 --> 00:52:32.330
<v Speaker 2>When you pull up to that many hours and </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the repetition,</v>

1184
00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:35.420
<v Speaker 2>with using a single points of just my </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands and my biceps,</v>

1185
00:52:35.421 --> 00:52:38.000
<v Speaker 2>my back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my body was swollen,</v>

1186
00:52:38.001 --> 00:52:38.834
<v Speaker 2>like the Pillsbury doughboy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it looked horrible and I'm so </v>

1187
00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:45.260
<v Speaker 2>they kept me in there for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how long?</v>

1188
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:46.363
<v Speaker 2>Probably about a eight hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was about eight hours and ivs and </v>

1189
00:52:49.761 --> 00:52:52.220
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they just is basically three.</v>

1190
00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:56.420
<v Speaker 2>She had Florida event tons of fluid and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they sent me home though.</v>

1191
00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:58.003
<v Speaker 2>So I went home that night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how long did you wait before you </v>

1192
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:02.083
<v Speaker 2>jumped back at it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was back in the pool bar </v>

1193
00:53:04.131 --> 00:53:05.270
<v Speaker 2>about a week and a half later.</v>

1194
00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:10.940
<v Speaker 2>And then I broke the record of 66 weeks </v>
<v Speaker 2>later when I broke the record.</v>

1195
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:14.030
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you,</v>

1196
00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:15.860
<v Speaker 2>when you did get back on the pull up </v>
<v Speaker 2>bar,</v>

1197
00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:20.300
<v Speaker 2>that was how fucked up your body from it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was bad.</v>

1198
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:23.470
<v Speaker 2>But what I do is like I've done through </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything it,</v>

1199
00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:24.920
<v Speaker 2>which isn't real smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

1200
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:25.973
<v Speaker 2>It works for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not saying do this is I've </v>

1201
00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:31.470
<v Speaker 2>trained through a lot of my injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started developing.</v>

1202
00:53:31.471 --> 00:53:32.304
<v Speaker 2>I started doing that in butts and still </v>
<v Speaker 2>training because I'm still training </v>

1203
00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:35.253
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know you got start from day one or </v>

1204
00:53:36.901 --> 00:53:37.734
<v Speaker 2>day is kick you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I started from day one enough so my </v>

1205
00:53:39.661 --> 00:53:43.350
<v Speaker 2>third time going through I was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>jacked up when you had pneumonia,</v>

1206
00:53:43.450 --> 00:53:45.870
<v Speaker 2>he had pneumonia and I had really bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress fractures,</v>

1207
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:48.390
<v Speaker 2>so my stress fractures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was literally,</v>

1208
00:53:48.391 --> 00:53:49.224
<v Speaker 2>I would put a sock on and then duct tape</v>
<v Speaker 2>my foot all the way up to the top or to </v>

1209
00:53:53.551 --> 00:53:56.370
<v Speaker 2>the minimum ink or tending my calf it </v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

1210
00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:59.820
<v Speaker 2>My stress fracture were so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like the pivot point between my ankle</v>

1211
00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:05.090
<v Speaker 2>and my Shin as cast that all the way up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I went through for several months</v>

1212
00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:06.443
<v Speaker 2>for a few months with stress fractures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was crazy about that is they </v>

1213
00:54:09.481 --> 00:54:12.330
<v Speaker 2>healed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the time I got the third phase,</v>

1214
00:54:12.331 --> 00:54:14.400
<v Speaker 2>my stress fractures are healed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1215
00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:17.010
<v Speaker 2>And I don't even know how rhyme or </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason behind it.</v>

1216
00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:19.230
<v Speaker 2>I ran on him a few months later they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were here.</v>

1217
00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know what that means.</v>

1218
00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:22.733
<v Speaker 2>Push through the agony and eventually </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body just said this crazy fuck is </v>

1219
00:54:26.101 --> 00:54:28.080
<v Speaker 2>not gonna stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true statement.</v>

1220
00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:29.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

1221
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.050
<v Speaker 2>A lot of my injuries I've just pushed </v>
<v Speaker 2>through and they've uh,</v>

1222
00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:33.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>duct tape it up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Have you ever had to have surgery on an </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we talked about that too,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they took me off and studied me for </v>

1233
00:54:52.081 --> 00:54:56.340
<v Speaker 2>awhile so they realized that my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't even be in the military.</v>

1234
00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:58.260
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't even qualified to be in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>military,</v>

1238
00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:04.523
<v Speaker 2>How did they seal that up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they went in with a helix patch and </v>

1239
00:55:08.161 --> 00:55:08.941
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was terrified.</v>

1267
00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:07.450
<v Speaker 2>Mri machine for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of.</v>

1270
00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.540
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot behind that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1271
00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:13.800
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been checked out a lot.</v>

1272
00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:15.750
<v Speaker 2>I've had a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I said,</v>

1273
00:56:15.751 --> 00:56:18.150
<v Speaker 2>like six years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started stressing out like I thought I</v>

1274
00:56:18.151 --> 00:56:20.010
<v Speaker 2>was dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even get a bed.</v>

1275
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:24.830
<v Speaker 2>So all that stretching out was from </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much all these injuries I had.</v>

1276
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:28.600
<v Speaker 2>I had never really fixed in my body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get knotted up in more.</v>

1277
00:56:28.601 --> 00:56:29.434
<v Speaker 2>Not Up and up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean it's going to heal one way or </v>

1278
00:56:31.751 --> 00:56:33.070
<v Speaker 2>another?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to heal and when it heals,</v>

1279
00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:33.913
<v Speaker 2>not gonna heal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1280
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:36.340
<v Speaker 2>So he'll all jacked up and crooked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1281
00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:38.500
<v Speaker 2>So I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a cricket jacked up dude man,</v>

1282
00:56:38.501 --> 00:56:39.430
<v Speaker 2>but I still get it to.</v>

1283
00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.710
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that you haven't had like </v>
<v Speaker 2>knee surgeries or anything like that and</v>

1284
00:56:44.711 --> 00:56:46.150
<v Speaker 2>consider all the running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moved on.</v>

1285
00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:49.180
<v Speaker 2>My left knee right now is in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no joke.</v>

1286
00:56:49.181 --> 00:56:50.620
<v Speaker 2>So like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>origin of pain.</v>

1287
00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:54.310
<v Speaker 2>My right foot is messed up because my </v>
<v Speaker 2>left knee.</v>

1288
00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:56.000
<v Speaker 2>So right now I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

00:56:56.010 --> 00:56:58.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking care of my left knee is </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting a lot better now,</v>

1290
00:56:58.001 --> 00:57:00.100
<v Speaker 2>but don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cameron Hanes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>rather merry Christmas.</v>

1295
00:57:11.471 --> 00:57:14.220
<v Speaker 2>I'll say you don't know what's wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the knee.</v>

1296
00:57:14.490 --> 00:57:16.480
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's from stretching.</v>

1297
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:18.280
<v Speaker 2>So basically stretching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1298
00:57:18.281 --> 00:57:19.114
<v Speaker 2>So my whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because my body was in such bad </v>

1299
00:57:21.551 --> 00:57:22.384
<v Speaker 2>alignment from just what I did to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that now I'm in this huge dress routine </v>

1300
00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:30.040
<v Speaker 2>in my body's getting back into </v>
<v Speaker 2>alignment.</v>

1301
00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:33.070
<v Speaker 2>So your muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was a power lifter man,</v>

1302
00:57:33.071 --> 00:57:35.140
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew these huge muscles.</v>

1303
00:57:35.141 --> 00:57:35.974
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm the small guy and I just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And from the stress in my body going </v>

1304
00:57:38.861 --> 00:57:39.694
<v Speaker 2>through hell weeks and also my bias got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>became one not so as things start to </v>

1305
00:57:43.181 --> 00:57:45.550
<v Speaker 2>open up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joints start to hurt,</v>

1306
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:47.440
<v Speaker 2>things start to hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like God.</v>

1307
00:57:47.441 --> 00:57:48.274
<v Speaker 2>So it's been this big long process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm fashion in better shape than </v>

1308
00:57:50.651 --> 00:57:52.750
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My organs work better.</v>

1309
00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:56.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm healthier than ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have these little tweaks here,</v>

1310
00:57:56.410 --> 00:57:59.260
<v Speaker 2>little tweaks there from the fact that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>am now.</v>

1311
00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:03.430
<v Speaker 2>My bio is locked in position from these </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscles being so tight now.</v>

1312
00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:07.690
<v Speaker 2>What do you weight now about one 82 83 </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you were like 300 plus pounds.</v>

1313
00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:08.563
<v Speaker 2>You at your father's store?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fattest when I weighed in it for the </v>

1314
00:58:10.151 --> 00:58:11.830
<v Speaker 2>military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know when my fattest was,</v>

1315
00:58:11.831 --> 00:58:14.970
<v Speaker 2>but when I weighed in on that scale and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Steven's sounds,</v>

1316
00:58:14.971 --> 00:58:16.240
<v Speaker 2>you'll hit that scale on me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1317
00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:19.570
<v Speaker 2>It was two 97 and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brother,</v>

1318
00:58:19.571 --> 00:58:21.670
<v Speaker 2>you got to lose 106 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1319
00:58:21.671 --> 00:58:22.504
<v Speaker 2>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell if we're talking about </v>

1320
00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:27.070
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How's that possible?</v>

1321
00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:29.390
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just not a lot of time.</v>

1322
00:58:29.391 --> 00:58:30.224
<v Speaker 2>That's the crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't give you three months to </v>

1323
00:58:31.691 --> 00:58:32.524
<v Speaker 2>lose that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thirty three pounds a month is a lot of </v>

1324
00:58:34.931 --> 00:58:36.580
<v Speaker 2>fucking weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus a few.</v>

1325
00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Almost impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I thought.</v>

1326
00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:41.290
<v Speaker 2>That's what I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But see you see the person I am now.</v>

1327
00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:43.930
<v Speaker 2>It was 175 pounds in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was.</v>

1328
00:58:43.931 --> 00:58:47.590
<v Speaker 2>I was a skinny guy in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I made myself big.</v>

1329
00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:50.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm a small bone person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it didn't.</v>

1330
00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:51.670
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust me.</v>

1331
00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:52.533
<v Speaker 2>It was hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was hardest thing I've ever done in </v>

1332
00:58:55.121 --> 00:58:55.954
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what did people think around you </v>

1333
00:58:58.031 --> 00:58:59.230
<v Speaker 2>when they saw you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three months later,</v>

1334
00:58:59.231 --> 00:59:00.350
<v Speaker 2>you're 100 pounds lighter.</v>

1335
00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:01.213
<v Speaker 2>My mom couldn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a mom so I was living in </v>

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:47.180
<v Speaker 2>The reason why I speak the way I speak </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I believe in.</v>

1374
01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:52.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying if I ever shut it down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the end of me and whatever my 100</v>

1375
01:00:54.321 --> 01:00:55.154
<v Speaker 2>percent will be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's gonna Happen to me </v>

1376
01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:57.523
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everywhere.</v>

1377
01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:01.670
<v Speaker 2>If you can't run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will figure what the fuck I can do and</v>

1378
01:01:01.671 --> 01:01:04.130
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That will be my new hundred percent.</v>

1379
01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:07.040
<v Speaker 2>You must continue to find your new 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>

1380
01:01:07.041 --> 01:01:07.874
<v Speaker 2>Whatever life throws at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You must find what you can do now and </v>

1381
01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:14.540
<v Speaker 2>maybe come to the best you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists of all time.</v>

1382
01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:15.680
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch out.</v>

1383
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:16.543
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1384
01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.590
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>An approach like this,</v>

1385
01:01:21.591 --> 01:01:23.240
<v Speaker 2>this approach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this mental approach.</v>

1386
01:01:23.241 --> 01:01:28.241
<v Speaker 2>You can use that for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you get past the quitting mechanism</v>

1387
01:01:28.641 --> 01:01:29.474
<v Speaker 2>of your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you get past that thing that this </v>

1388
01:01:31.611 --> 01:01:33.110
<v Speaker 2>is applicable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>

1389
01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:34.153
<v Speaker 2>You can take these lessons that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned from these grueling runs as </v>

1390
01:01:37.790 --> 01:01:41.780
<v Speaker 2>losing 106 pounds in three months for </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different things of struggle.</v>

1391
01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:46.070
<v Speaker 2>You can take these lessons of struggle </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can apply them to anything.</v>

1392
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:46.963
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talk about it in my book here about </v>

1393
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:53.540
<v Speaker 2>that race I did that made sill training </v>
<v Speaker 2>look like child's play in ranger school.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That that first 100 miler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did write shit on myself and all kinds</v>

1395
01:01:56.961 --> 01:01:57.794
<v Speaker 2>of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That 19 hours it took me with no </v>

1396
01:01:59.811 --> 01:02:02.870
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sum it up like this.</v>

<v Speaker 2>death struggle in that 19 hours.</v>

1399

<v Speaker 2>I lived five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five years of struggle of happiness,</v>

1400

<v Speaker 2>of of depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>success,</v>

<v Speaker 2>failure in 19 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's great about some of these </v>

<v Speaker 2>you have to manage within this suck fest</v>
<v Speaker 2>of 19 hours and that's what I get from </v>

1408
01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:39.480
<v Speaker 2>lot of these different things that human</v>
<v Speaker 2>growth,</v>

1409
01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:43.380
<v Speaker 2>no growth of the mind without friction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no growth without friction.</v>

1410
01:02:43.381 --> 01:02:44.214
<v Speaker 2>There's no growth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no growth and there's no </v>

1411
01:02:47.191 --> 01:02:48.024
<v Speaker 2>satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] like there's no real like </v>

1412
01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.113
<v Speaker 2>people want to sit around and rest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't really appreciate </v>

1413
01:02:53.251 --> 01:02:54.420
<v Speaker 2>restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You earned it.</v>

1414
01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:55.470
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people,</v>

1415
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:58.830
<v Speaker 2>they think I'm their craziest person on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet.</v>

1416
01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:03.060
<v Speaker 2>You are so far removed from that day was</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even funny.</v>

1417
01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:08.360
<v Speaker 2>I was 290 pounds twice in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not like to do the things I do,</v>

1418
01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:12.720
<v Speaker 2>but there's humongous satisfaction for </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>

1419
01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.073
<v Speaker 2>The Schumacher satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lace on your shoes up saying I don't </v>

1420
01:03:16.321 --> 01:03:17.154
<v Speaker 2>really want to go for a run today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then running and then getting back </v>

1421
01:03:20.851 --> 01:03:21.660
<v Speaker 2>and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1422
01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:22.710
<v Speaker 2>I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it.</v>

1423
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.233
<v Speaker 2>And that's what it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about these small steps to doing </v>

1424
01:03:25.921 --> 01:03:27.630
<v Speaker 2>things you don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know Jocko,</v>

1425
01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:28.680
<v Speaker 2>Jocko willink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know him.</v>

1426
01:03:28.681 --> 01:03:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Giagos not all great,</v>

1427
01:03:31.261 --> 01:03:33.120
<v Speaker 2>but I know him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know him pretty well.</v>

1428
01:03:33.121 --> 01:03:33.960
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's awesome.</v>

1429
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:36.900
<v Speaker 2>But every morning you look at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker's instagram,</v>

1430
01:03:36.901 --> 01:03:41.310
<v Speaker 2>he's got a picture of his watch at 4:30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets up at 4:30</v>

1431
01:03:41.311 --> 01:03:42.144
<v Speaker 2>every morning and he earns a sunrise </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of like a motherfucker and </v>

1432
01:03:45.361 --> 01:03:46.500
<v Speaker 2>then earns a sunrise.</v>

1433
01:03:46.530 --> 01:03:47.363
<v Speaker 2>That's good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's that thing like there's no end </v>

1434
01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.630
<v Speaker 2>now as an n.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's scary.</v>

1435
01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:53.580
<v Speaker 2>That is scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The scary.</v>

1436
01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:57.870
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants that holding hands while</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sun sets of retirement.</v>

1437
01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.450
<v Speaker 2>You walk it off into the sunset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The biggest question I get is,</v>

1438
01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:05.130
<v Speaker 2>so when do you rest?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did you recover?</v>

1439
01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't want to scare people,</v>

1440
01:04:09.090 --> 01:04:14.090
<v Speaker 2>but the truth answer is I don't take any</v>
<v Speaker 2>days off.</v>

1441
01:04:15.210 --> 01:04:16.380
<v Speaker 2>No days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no days,</v>

1442
01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:17.940
<v Speaker 2>seven days a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven days a week.</v>

1443
01:04:18.050 --> 01:04:20.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does a normal day?</v>

1444
01:04:20.310 --> 01:04:22.650
<v Speaker 2>Normal day for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a normal day.</v>

1445
01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:24.690
<v Speaker 2>So let's say a Light Day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Light Day,</v>

1446
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:29.750
<v Speaker 2>light day is at least a seven mile run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will every,</v>

1447
01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:32.850
<v Speaker 2>every for every other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so about four days a week.</v>

1448
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:35.280
<v Speaker 2>Calisthenics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus gym workout.</v>

1449
01:04:35.281 --> 01:04:39.090
<v Speaker 2>So I don't do any gym workout without </v>
<v Speaker 2>hitting pullups pushups.</v>

1450
01:04:39.091 --> 01:04:39.924
<v Speaker 2>I called nickels and dimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like five pool of 10 pushups or I'll </v>

1451
01:04:43.231 --> 01:04:44.064
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1452
01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:46.040
<v Speaker 2>quarters and whatever.</v>

1453
01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:48.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like 25 pull ups or in like 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushups.</v>

1454
01:04:48.731 --> 01:04:49.564
<v Speaker 2>So I have all these different things I </v>
<v Speaker 2>messed up so I will do weights with </v>

1455
01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:57.700
<v Speaker 2>calisthenics in every single night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stretch for at least every night.</v>

1456
01:04:58.831 --> 01:05:02.610
<v Speaker 2>I stretched for these two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two hours every night.</v>

1457
01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:06.240
<v Speaker 2>Every night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you stretch after you're done working</v>

1458
01:05:06.241 --> 01:05:06.751
<v Speaker 2>out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1459
01:05:06.751 --> 01:05:07.584
<v Speaker 2>So at nighttime usually I'll be either </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a quiet room or I'll be watching tv </v>

1460
01:05:11.341 --> 01:05:12.174
<v Speaker 2>or I love sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We watching the game and I'm on the </v>

1461
01:05:14.371 --> 01:05:16.140
<v Speaker 2>floor man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I do.</v>

1462
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:18.320
<v Speaker 2>So you just stretch while you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that's stress.</v>

1463
01:05:18.321 --> 01:05:19.960
<v Speaker 2>While I do stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two hours,</v>

1464
01:05:19.961 --> 01:05:20.794
<v Speaker 2>a long ass time to stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this just because you try to correct </v>

1465
01:05:23.550 --> 01:05:27.010
<v Speaker 2>or correct years of not doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No years.</v>

1466
01:05:27.011 --> 01:05:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever fuck with yoga a lot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1467
01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.000
<v Speaker 2>Yoga is this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

1468
01:05:31.001 --> 01:05:32.530

<v Speaker 2>I have my own yoga,</v>

1469
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:35.950

<v Speaker 2>for what my body needs.</v>

01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:46.150
<v Speaker 2>and hold them for a long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's where I stretching that.</v>

1473

01:06:12.610 --> 01:06:13.443
<v Speaker 2>So here you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start hunching over before you know </v>

1486
01:06:15.971 --> 01:06:17.150
<v Speaker 2>what your joints are out of whack.</v>

1487
01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:18.333
<v Speaker 2>You need to get for range of motion </v>
<v Speaker 2>before you know how fucked up you truly </v>

1488
01:06:20.321 --> 01:06:21.850
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm.</v>

1489
01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:24.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm always working on a full range of </v>
<v Speaker 2>motion like a kid.</v>

1490
01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:27.760
<v Speaker 2>They run so effortlessly there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always going for range of motion.</v>

1491
01:06:28.330 --> 01:06:31.270
<v Speaker 2>As you get older and tireder and sit in </v>
<v Speaker 2>more stressed,</v>

1492
01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.730
<v Speaker 2>your body starts to get more and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>tight.</v>

1493
01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your shoulders start to get a balance.</v>

1494
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Not a not a joint out of socket there </v>
<v Speaker 2>free.</v>

1495
01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:39.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's popping.</v>

1496
01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:42.640
<v Speaker 2>Popping because you're fucking tight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Open it up.</v>

1497
01:06:42.641 --> 01:06:43.474
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>
<v Speaker 2>open it up.</v>

1498
01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.313
<v Speaker 2>Can you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you touch your hands behind each </v>

1499
01:06:45.671 --> 01:06:47.910
<v Speaker 2>other and raise them up behind you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1500
01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:48.753
<v Speaker 2>it's all these different ranges of </v>
<v Speaker 2>motion that I get real smart on from a </v>

1501
01:06:51.311 --> 01:06:54.400
<v Speaker 2>guy and I took it to another level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So are you.</v>

1502
01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Do you work with a trainer or do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>always work out by yourself?</v>

1503
01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:57.573
<v Speaker 2>Everything I'd do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never had training in my entire </v>

1504
01:06:58.601 --> 01:06:59.440
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1505
01:06:59.530 --> 01:07:00.363
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not one time did he read about </v>

1506
01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:05.980
<v Speaker 2>physiology or exercise science or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like that?</v>

1507

<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

1508
01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:08.403

<v Speaker 2>stability or new exercises?</v>

<v Speaker 2>This body is what it is now is from </v>

1518
01:07:45.461 --> 01:07:47.980
<v Speaker 2>repetition is not from studying.</v>

<v Speaker 2>very thin guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you were talking about the </v>

<v Speaker 2>plex.</v>

1603

01:12:20.101 --> 01:12:20.934
<v Speaker 2>Chris Cosmin let him know I did 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>miles so I can get in the badwater it </v>

1618
01:12:24.721 --> 01:12:25.710
<v Speaker 2>didn't go as like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1619
01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:28.440

<v Speaker 2>badwater after another race,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like how later.</v>

1621
01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:36.920
<v Speaker 2>So basically I had never run a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did the hundred mile race first,</v>

1622
01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:37.973
<v Speaker 2>no training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had signed up for the marathon </v>

1623
01:12:40.111 --> 01:12:40.944
<v Speaker 2>because it was a first last vegas </v>
<v Speaker 2>marathon running down the strip of Las </v>

1624
01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.370
<v Speaker 2>Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Las Vegas had a marathon.</v>

1625
01:12:47.370 --> 01:12:49.050
<v Speaker 2>But it's the first time it's gonna go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the Strip.</v>

1626
01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:49.980
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1627
01:12:49.981 --> 01:12:50.430
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>

1628
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:53.160
<v Speaker 2>Sign up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went onto an Iraq.</v>

1629
01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:56.340
<v Speaker 2>Did you know did the appointment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I come back I'll be training for it</v>

1630
01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:59.570
<v Speaker 2>and I go do this race with my family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me and my ex wife.</v>

1631
01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.890
<v Speaker 2>My mom signed up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in Iraq,</v>

1632
01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:06.900
<v Speaker 2>me and my boy sledge in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just working out.</v>

1633
01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:07.793
<v Speaker 2>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing crazy workouts in my cardio </v>

1634
01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:14.670
<v Speaker 2>was 20 minutes every Sunday on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>elliptical trainer.</v>

1635
01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:16.013
<v Speaker 2>That's the only cardio idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'll call myself training for a </v>

1636
01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:20.243
<v Speaker 2>marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1637
01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.170
<v Speaker 2>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1638
01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.200
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my boys got killed in,</v>

1639
01:13:24.201 --> 01:13:26.220

<v Speaker 2>the whole operation red wings.</v>

1641
01:13:28.710 --> 01:13:29.543

<v Speaker 2>mile race after the 100 mile race in </v>

1642
01:13:32.791 --> 01:13:33.624

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:34.733
<v Speaker 2>It was like two or three weeks later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that marathon that we all signed up for </v>

1644
01:13:37.501 --> 01:13:38.334

<v Speaker 2>I didn't train for 100 mile race and </v>

01:16:33.281 --> 01:16:34.620
<v Speaker 3>that as a bystander.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1713
01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:35.950
<v Speaker 3>you can't watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1714
01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:37.840
<v Speaker 3>You gotta get out there and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1715
01:16:37.841 --> 01:16:40.210
<v Speaker 3>this hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This hurts real fucking bad.</v>

1716
01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:44.470
<v Speaker 3>I don't think this is smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then guess what happens?</v>

1717
01:16:45.010 --> 01:16:49.510
<v Speaker 3>The body will just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will adjust if it goes well.</v>

1718
01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:51.340
<v Speaker 3>Then the next question again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1719
01:16:51.341 --> 01:16:54.100
<v Speaker 3>you're a time when it doesn't adjust.</v>

1720
01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:59.530
<v Speaker 3>I guess some of the stupidest shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like don't,</v>

1721
01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.990
<v Speaker 3>don't take it with a grain of salt </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1722
01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:03.790
<v Speaker 3>Those questions that people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanting to quit.</v>

1723
01:17:03.791 --> 01:17:04.624
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1724
01:17:04.690 --> 01:17:06.010
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When should I quit?</v>

1725
01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:07.730
<v Speaker 3>Like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever like,</v>

1726
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:09.230
<v Speaker 3>feel like no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shut the fuck up.</v>

1727
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:11.450
<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop.</v>

1728
01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:14.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to like there's always that</v>
<v Speaker 3>next question.</v>

1729
01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:16.490
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't take it.</v>

1730
01:17:16.491 --> 01:17:19.250
<v Speaker 3>Like go out there and run through a </v>
<v Speaker 3>brick wall as many times as you can.</v>

1731
01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:21.290
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying be me.</v>

1732
01:17:21.291 --> 01:17:23.120
<v Speaker 3>Don't run towards it and five miles at </v>
<v Speaker 3>one time.</v>

1733
01:17:23.121 --> 01:17:26.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying start to learn.</v>

1734
01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:29.930
<v Speaker 3>The mind is powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's powerful.</v>

1735
01:17:29.931 --> 01:17:31.550
<v Speaker 3>Man is unbelievable.</v>

1736
01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:32.773
<v Speaker 1>But if people need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need a thing to get them going or </v>

1737
01:17:36.031 --> 01:17:37.280
<v Speaker 1>they need a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1738
01:17:37.281 --> 01:17:39.310
<v Speaker 1>I need a goal they need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need A.</v>

1739
01:17:39.330 --> 01:17:40.163
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sometimes the first step is the </v>

1740
01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:45.470
<v Speaker 1>hardest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's hard to take that 1 million,</v>

1741
01:17:45.471 --> 01:17:46.304
<v Speaker 1>step two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes the first step is the </v>

1742
01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:51.130
<v Speaker 1>something about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I do about it?</v>

1743
01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:54.800
<v Speaker 1>They start going over the phone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>start calling people.</v>

1744
01:17:54.801 --> 01:17:59.801
<v Speaker 1>They don't get out of the house and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about procrastination.</v>

1745
01:18:01.641 --> 01:18:02.331
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1746
01:18:02.331 --> 01:18:04.910
<v Speaker 1>it's painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you should be doing things,</v>

1747
01:18:04.911 --> 01:18:07.190
<v Speaker 1>but you just keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You keep itching.</v>

1748
01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:12.040
<v Speaker 3>I procrastinate like a motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1749
01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:17.060
<v Speaker 3>Every day I want to do this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's so funny,</v>

1750
01:18:17.501 --> 01:18:18.334
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People looking like on some damn </v>

1751
01:18:18.761 --> 01:18:21.850
<v Speaker 3>superhero that came down from the Gods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the heavens on earth.</v>

1752
01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:24.760
<v Speaker 3>No Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do this shit.</v>

1753
01:18:27.010 --> 01:18:31.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at my shoes for 30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they can fuck man.</v>

1754
01:18:31.871 --> 01:18:32.704
<v Speaker 3>People.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People look up to your Goggins fucked </v>

1755
01:18:34.631 --> 01:18:39.550
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I going to do this shit man.</v>

1756
01:18:39.551 --> 01:18:40.990
<v Speaker 3>But guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do it.</v>

1757
01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:44.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do it as long as you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I know about math.</v>

1758
01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:45.681
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Man,</v>

1759
01:18:45.681 --> 01:18:47.780
<v Speaker 2>you got to fucking sit here and you look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at your shoes for 30,</v>

1760
01:18:47.781 --> 01:18:48.614
<v Speaker 2>40 minutes you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to think about all day long you </v>

1761
01:18:51.561 --> 01:18:53.780
<v Speaker 2>go do it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes you don't have the time to</v>

1762
01:18:53.781 --> 01:18:55.790
<v Speaker 2>look at issues with 30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the,</v>

1763
01:18:55.850 --> 01:18:57.450
<v Speaker 2>those are the beautiful days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1764
01:18:57.451 --> 01:18:57.981
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd know,</v>

1765
01:18:57.981 --> 01:18:59.390
<v Speaker 2>you just have to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1766
01:18:59.391 --> 01:19:01.610
<v Speaker 2>And so like there's no room for </v>
<v Speaker 2>procrastination.</v>

1767
01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:03.110
<v Speaker 2>And that's when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was in the military,</v>

1768
01:19:03.111 --> 01:19:06.140
<v Speaker 2>I love my schedule because I knew it'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>be at work at 7:00.</v>

1769
01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:08.840
<v Speaker 2>So you better get your ass up at 4:00,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1770
01:19:08.841 --> 01:19:12.080
<v Speaker 2>He had get your shit and brother because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to get my shit and before I got my</v>

1771
01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:13.440
<v Speaker 2>shit in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1772
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:15.650
<v Speaker 2>So that was my mentality back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1773
01:19:15.651 --> 01:19:16.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

1774
01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:19.790
<v Speaker 2>I had to get the miles and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything in man and,</v>

1775
01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:21.050
<v Speaker 2>and get to work.</v>

1776
01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:23.450
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a competing with the Alpha males.</v>

1777
01:19:23.770 --> 01:19:24.603
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how much does that piss other Alpha </v>

1778
01:19:26.091 --> 01:19:30.170
<v Speaker 2>males off that you were imposing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A very high bar.</v>

1779
01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.153
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very misunderstood human being </v>

1780
01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:38.480
<v Speaker 2>housed in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The air force guys liked me a lot.</v>

1781
01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:41.810
<v Speaker 2>The Rangers liked me a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much.</v>

1782
01:19:41.811 --> 01:19:46.070
<v Speaker 2>Not to seals because they were with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't like me so much,</v>

1783
01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:47.210
<v Speaker 2>which is fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1784
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:49.480
<v Speaker 2>I respect them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of respect.</v>

1785
01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:49.770
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1786
01:19:49.770 --> 01:19:52.050
<v Speaker 2>I've a lot of friends in the seal teams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to like,</v>

1787
01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:55.310
<v Speaker 2>like minded mentality as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as me and wants to get me.</v>

1788
01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:58.010
<v Speaker 2>I grew up and I got over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys still have,</v>

1789
01:19:58.011 --> 01:19:58.844
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people can't get over the fact </v>

1790
01:20:00.171 --> 01:20:02.270
<v Speaker 2>that whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not became a civil recruiter.</v>

1791
01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:05.630
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys thought I wasn't deploying</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of reasons and whatnot.</v>

1792
01:20:05.630 --> 01:20:07.710
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard a lot.</v>

1793
01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:11.220
<v Speaker 2>I was that guy who grinded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grind it hard.</v>

1794
01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:13.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grounded hard.</v>

1795
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:18.090
<v Speaker 2>I was that guy who was up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if we went on op or we had a,</v>

1796
01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:20.450
<v Speaker 2>a workup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say we had a workup.</v>

1797
01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:22.410
<v Speaker 2>We're in Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were out there shooting guns and,</v>

1798
01:20:22.411 --> 01:20:25.530
<v Speaker 2>and dual land warfare and we did it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like 1:00</v>

1799
01:20:25.531 --> 01:20:28.710
<v Speaker 2>in the fucking morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most everybody go to sleep,</v>

1800
01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:32.880
<v Speaker 2>go to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the gym,</v>

1801
01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:37.530
<v Speaker 2>I worked out or our goal sleep that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be up at 5:00.</v>

1802
01:20:37.531 --> 01:20:39.090
<v Speaker 2>I was up at 4:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>and got my hour in.</v>

1803
01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:40.853
<v Speaker 2>I made sure to always do that and I did </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to a point to where I think at </v>

1804
01:20:44.911 --> 01:20:48.000
<v Speaker 2>pissing people off because I want a </v>
<v Speaker 2>quiet person about it.</v>

1805
01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:49.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1806
01:20:49.611 --> 01:20:50.444
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1807
01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:52.830
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't the most humble person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always,</v>

1808
01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:53.670
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1809
01:20:53.670 --> 01:20:56.660
<v Speaker 2>So when you're running alpha males,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1810
01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:58.980
<v Speaker 2>you're sometimes picking a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1811
01:20:59.010 --> 01:21:00.960
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I looked different,</v>

1812
01:21:01.010 --> 01:21:02.400
<v Speaker 2>acted different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was different.</v>

1813
01:21:02.401 --> 01:21:04.080
<v Speaker 2>I am different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take a lot of pride in that.</v>

1814
01:21:04.710 --> 01:21:05.520
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1815
01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:07.050
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you didn't get after it,</v>

1816
01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:10.140
<v Speaker 2>I didn't respect you because I believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1817
01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:12.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'm at,</v>

1818
01:21:13.050 --> 01:21:15.390
<v Speaker 2>I know that human potential is what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

1819
01:21:15.450 --> 01:21:19.110
<v Speaker 2>So all we have is what we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world sees us a certain way.</v>

1820
01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.500
<v Speaker 2>And when I saw that people weren't doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1821
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:27.240
<v Speaker 2>I had a funky ass fucking attitude and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>own it in my book.</v>

1822
01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:29.940
<v Speaker 2>I come back from ranger school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big time leader.</v>

1823
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.700
<v Speaker 2>I was a big time fucking leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get honor man out there.</v>

1824
01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:33.983
<v Speaker 2>I lead by example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I realized a lot of times when </v>

1847
01:22:30.690 --> 01:22:31.523
<v Speaker 2>He's a great friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the horseman first before my heart </v>

1848
01:22:34.261 --> 01:22:35.220
<v Speaker 2>surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my second heart surgery,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm going to 10 mile ruck run for my </v>
<v Speaker 2>second highest rate.</v>

1852
01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:42.090
<v Speaker 2>I saw that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1853
01:22:42.091 --> 01:22:44.160
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you doing out here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get a heart surgeon.</v>

1854

<v Speaker 2>It's Roger that brother I'm getting in </v>
<v Speaker 2>before I'm be out for about six months </v>

1855
01:22:47.971 --> 01:22:48.804
<v Speaker 2>after the heart surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was my mentality because I started </v>

1856
01:22:50.911 --> 01:22:51.744
<v Speaker 2>realizing that a young age we'd always </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaving on the table and once I found </v>

1857
01:22:55.411 --> 01:22:59.400
<v Speaker 2>out what a human beings capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how to control that.</v>

1858
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:01.103
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a fucking talking about fucking </v>

1859
01:23:02.731 --> 01:23:04.520
<v Speaker 2>savage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was.</v>

1860
01:23:04.521 --> 01:23:06.490
<v Speaker 2>I was a fucking straight up people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about savage.</v>

1861
01:23:06.491 --> 01:23:11.410
<v Speaker 2>Very likely I was fucking from the back </v>
<v Speaker 2>woods motherfucking savage dude,</v>

1862
01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:13.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just,</v>

1863
01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:14.440

1864
01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:18.970

<v Speaker 2>I ate chips on my shoulder,</v>

1865
01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:23.410
<v Speaker 2>I m and a lot of times that wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

1866
01:23:23.650 --> 01:23:26.260
<v Speaker 2>So is it a situation where like with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>seals were,</v>

1867
01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:29.490
<v Speaker 2>once you've gotten through buds and once</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've gotten through all the,</v>

1868
01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:34.540
<v Speaker 2>the physically grueling parts of getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be accepted once you're in,</v>

1869
01:23:35.770 --> 01:23:39.670
<v Speaker 2>then you were imposing standards that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't want to,</v>

1870
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:41.290
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to keep up with.</v>

1871
01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:43.170
<v Speaker 2>I will say some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1872
01:23:43.171 --> 01:23:44.170
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had uh,</v>

1873
01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:46.030
<v Speaker 2>I had one platoon that had a problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1874

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

1875
01:23:47.550 --> 01:23:48.271
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1876
01:23:48.271 --> 01:23:49.104
<v Speaker 2>I graduated ranger school and I got in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this platoon and I didn't see how the </v>

1877
01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:54.700
<v Speaker 2>hockey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't charged with pt program and you</v>

1878
01:23:54.701 --> 01:23:57.100
<v Speaker 2>put me in charge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the PT program is fucking your ass.</v>

1879
01:23:57.970 --> 01:23:59.890
<v Speaker 2>And the thing about is I didn't like it </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

1880
01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.960
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to do this shit either </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1881
01:24:01.961 --> 01:24:03.630
<v Speaker 2>But what were you making them do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1882
01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:04.331
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

1883
01:24:04.331 --> 01:24:05.710
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was some navy,</v>

1884
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:07.240
<v Speaker 2>it was some bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1885
01:24:07.241 --> 01:24:08.470
<v Speaker 2>we went back to buzz like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the berms and shit.</v>

1887
01:24:11.171 --> 01:24:14.890
<v Speaker 2>And like I'd had us do like pull ups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rope climbs,</v>

1888
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:18.910
<v Speaker 2>pull up like flat out fucking hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine him doing rope climb,</v>

1889
01:24:18.911 --> 01:24:20.980
<v Speaker 2>then go and do like 10 to 15 pull ups </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming back.</v>

1890
01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:24.740
<v Speaker 2>And we would do like these if they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>very hard workout.</v>

1891
01:24:24.770 --> 01:24:26.890

1892
01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:27.933
<v Speaker 2>lifting some weights type of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was imposing my own mentality on </v>

1893
01:24:33.161 --> 01:24:35.290
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are grown ass fucking man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to make them to be.</v>

1896
01:24:38.770 --> 01:24:41.440
<v Speaker 2>And when they called me off like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1906
01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:07.090
<v Speaker 2>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when I started looking at people,</v>

1907
01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:09.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just people very differently man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>all those stories.</v>

1911

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1912
01:25:17.921 --> 01:25:19.900
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put people on a pedestal.</v>

1913
01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:24.490
<v Speaker 2>I put people like I can never be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could never be that guy,</v>

1914
01:25:24.491 --> 01:25:26.260
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never put anybody on a pedestal.</v>

1915
01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:28.150
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put them on a pass.</v>

1916
01:25:28.151 --> 01:25:31.030
<v Speaker 2>Then once I got out there with them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw him and he wants to get.</v>

1939
01:26:28.210 --> 01:26:32.480
<v Speaker 2>It's just I'm different and definitely I</v>
<v Speaker 2>figured out I'm different from everybody</v>

1940
01:26:32.481 --> 01:26:35.870
<v Speaker 2>in the fucking world and I had to own </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and say,</v>

1941
01:26:35.871 --> 01:26:38.120
<v Speaker 2>you know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You made a lot of fucking mistakes being</v>

1942
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:42.110
<v Speaker 2>a being who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I should've been more of a leader at</v>

1943
01:26:42.111 --> 01:26:42.944
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of times a lot of people </v>

1944
01:26:44.031 --> 01:26:45.170
<v Speaker 2>should have been a little bit harder to.</v>

1945
01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:46.553
<v Speaker 1>So was it that some of those guys just </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to work as hard or was it </v>

1946
01:26:49.291 --> 01:26:50.124
<v Speaker 1>just that they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't appreciating how </v>

1947
01:26:51.361 --> 01:26:54.090
<v Speaker 1>competitive you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were always against them.</v>

1948
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:55.103
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it was that he did it </v>
<v Speaker 1>foster the sense of brotherhood because </v>

1949
01:26:58.111 --> 01:26:59.550
<v Speaker 1>you are more like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on pussy.</v>

1950
01:27:00.430 --> 01:27:03.980
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really call them pussies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can look on my face and I looked</v>

1951
01:27:03.981 --> 01:27:05.550
<v Speaker 2>at you and in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1952
01:27:05.570 --> 01:27:06.830
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can kind of say this,</v>

1953
01:27:06.860 --> 01:27:08.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what happens?</v>

1954
01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:08.903
<v Speaker 2>I started developing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the separation in our thing about </v>

1955
01:27:12.261 --> 01:27:13.850
<v Speaker 2>me to mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't go out,</v>

1956
01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:17.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't hang out with the guys.</v>

1957
01:27:17.391 --> 01:27:18.081
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1958
01:27:18.081 --> 01:27:21.680
<v Speaker 2>So I was always forming this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>separation.</v>

1959
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big time introvert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1960
01:27:24.530 --> 01:27:27.740
<v Speaker 2>I do my job and I don't want to see your</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking ass again.</v>

1961
01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:30.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna go home refreshed and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>see you again.</v>

1962
01:27:30.621 --> 01:27:30.881
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1963
01:27:30.881 --> 01:27:33.320
<v Speaker 2>you're in a platoon with these guys for </v>
<v Speaker 2>two years,</v>

1964
01:27:33.321 --> 01:27:35.840
<v Speaker 2>sometimes a year and a half and I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1965
01:27:35.841 --> 01:27:38.090
<v Speaker 2>we work up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do our shit and I just,</v>

1966
01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:41.480
<v Speaker 2>I was just a different fucking cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a different cat man.</v>

1967
01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:42.313
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1968
01:27:43.130 --> 01:27:44.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1969
01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:47.300
<v Speaker 2>I think differently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe differently.</v>

1970
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:50.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I believe strongly in what I believe</v>

1971
01:27:50.841 --> 01:27:51.674
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when some people must appreciate the </v>

1972
01:27:52.791 --> 01:27:56.060
<v Speaker 2>fact that you self motivated and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you were pushing the envelope,</v>

1973
01:27:56.090 --> 01:27:58.730
<v Speaker 2>that you were pushing the pace you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>setting a high bar.</v>

1974
01:27:58.760 --> 01:27:59.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of guys right now within </v>

1975
01:28:00.741 --> 01:28:02.140
<v Speaker 2>the community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of,</v>

1976
01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:03.380
<v Speaker 2>a lot of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once again,</v>

1977
01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:07.220
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a big soap opera sometimes,</v>

1978
01:28:07.221 --> 01:28:07.660
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1979
01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:08.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we,</v>

1980
01:28:09.010 --> 01:28:11.540
<v Speaker 2>when unit fraternity like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where it's like,</v>

1981
01:28:11.541 --> 01:28:14.480
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had to get different vantage point,</v>

1982
01:28:14.630 --> 01:28:15.740
<v Speaker 2>look at it and see that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1983
01:28:15.741 --> 01:28:18.830
<v Speaker 2>a lot of guys did respect who I was and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I did.</v>

1984
01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:20.250
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1985
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:23.330
<v Speaker 2>I brought it fucking hard a lot in </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday,</v>

1986
01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:27.740
<v Speaker 2>but I also rubbed people the wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1987
01:28:27.741 --> 01:28:31.820
<v Speaker 2>that shit you talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like that if you want to scratch the</v>

1988

<v Speaker 2>fuck out my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:35.750
<v Speaker 2>fuck this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1990
01:28:37.370 --> 01:28:40.240
<v Speaker 2>I love what you talked about when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>ran the marathon.</v>

1991
01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:43.940
<v Speaker 2>You realized how much you were leaving </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the table because that is um,</v>

1992
01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>

1993
01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:50.090
<v Speaker 2>the unfulfilled potentials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the story of most people's lives.</v>

1994
01:28:50.610 --> 01:28:51.980
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1995
01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:53.093
<v Speaker 2>It could have been the story of mine and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell a lot of people who can people </v>

1996
01:28:55.641 --> 01:28:57.170

<v Speaker 2>say this.</v>

1998
01:29:03.011 --> 01:29:03.844
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you believe in God or </v>

1999
01:29:04.891 --> 01:29:05.550
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

2000
01:29:05.550 --> 01:29:07.230

<v Speaker 2>fucking long line of people.</v>

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:36.510
<v Speaker 2>So right now I'm way up here now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was way down here,</v>

2053
01:31:37.290 --> 01:31:41.010
<v Speaker 2>but what makes you way up here is being </v>
<v Speaker 2>from way down here.</v>

2054
01:31:41.190 --> 01:31:43.430
<v Speaker 2>So I love going back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I call it.</v>

2055
01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:45.570
<v Speaker 2>So when I was growing up like three </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

2056
01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:48.330
<v Speaker 2>so from the time I was eight to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>them I was like 12.</v>

2057
01:31:48.810 --> 01:31:52.410
<v Speaker 2>We lived in a $7 a month place in what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>call it is.</v>

2058
01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:57.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm always paying rent in that $7 a </v>
<v Speaker 2>month home everyday of my life.</v>

2059
01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:02.710
<v Speaker 2>I go back and revisit that place because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that place made me this garanimals.</v>

2060
01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:04.053
<v Speaker 2>That place made me this hard man in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there from that place or that place is </v>

2061
01:32:07.571 --> 01:32:08.404
<v Speaker 2>hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I places going back to the fundamentals </v>

2062
01:32:11.021 --> 01:32:12.670
<v Speaker 2>of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fundamentals.</v>

2063
01:32:12.671 --> 01:32:13.504
<v Speaker 2>What made David Goggins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>David Goggins going back in and you're </v>

2064
01:32:15.230 --> 01:32:16.063
<v Speaker 2>going back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to the library of David </v>

2065
01:32:18.610 --> 01:32:20.620
<v Speaker 2>Goggins studying even more than we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2066
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:21.783
<v Speaker 2>Taking that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going back to where I'm at now and then </v>

2067
01:32:23.681 --> 01:32:24.514
<v Speaker 2>moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I believe in always taking steps </v>

2068
01:32:26.651 --> 01:32:28.360
<v Speaker 2>backwards to your roots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

2069
01:32:28.450 --> 01:32:29.283
<v Speaker 2>we cannot forget the roots and what made</v>
<v Speaker 2>us the grandmother we can ever become </v>

2070
01:32:32.930 --> 01:32:33.763
<v Speaker 2>civilized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't a grandmother like little kids </v>

2071
01:32:35.081 --> 01:32:36.330
<v Speaker 2>clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this little kids clothes.</v>

2072
01:32:36.331 --> 01:32:39.670
<v Speaker 2>But I love the word I love is closer </v>
<v Speaker 2>drinks.</v>

2073
01:32:42.210 --> 01:32:44.350
<v Speaker 2>It was closer drinks members,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2074
01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:46.660
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

2075
01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:47.913
<v Speaker 2>when you live in like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what kind of goals are you setting </v>

2076
01:32:50.951 --> 01:32:51.850
<v Speaker 2>and how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you,</v>

2077
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:54.370
<v Speaker 2>how are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you feeding that beast inside of</v>

2078
01:32:54.371 --> 01:32:56.320
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How you calming all that down.</v>

2079
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:58.960
<v Speaker 2>Stretching helped a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2080
01:32:58.961 --> 01:33:01.630
<v Speaker 2>so when you wire yourself up so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>yoga,</v>

2081
01:33:02.290 --> 01:33:04.630
<v Speaker 2>yoga and stretching has really helped me</v>
<v Speaker 2>to like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>what you want to go.</v>

2083
01:33:08.411 --> 01:33:12.460
<v Speaker 2>Because noise is the ultimate Kryptonite</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

2084
01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:13.353
<v Speaker 2>Too much noise in your mind.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like long cardio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the best thing ever for harmon.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's like it's.</v>

2127
01:34:51.670 --> 01:34:56.050
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about people's brains that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the way people's minds work</v>

2128
01:34:56.051 --> 01:34:58.090
<v Speaker 2>that you were like a battery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like</v>

2129
01:34:58.370 --> 01:34:59.203
<v Speaker 1>leaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like since we don't use it because we </v>

2130
01:35:01.641 --> 01:35:02.474
<v Speaker 1>have all this potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't use it like oozes off the top </v>

2131
01:35:05.751 --> 01:35:07.510
<v Speaker 1>of the battery and it gets messy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2132
01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:10.070
<v Speaker 1>It's going down the size of the battery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all fucked up,</v>

2133
01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:15.110
<v Speaker 1>but when you just drain that bitch like </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature intended,</v>

2134
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:18.920
<v Speaker 1>like give you the potential to run away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from predators,</v>

2135
01:35:18.921 --> 01:35:19.754
<v Speaker 1>avoid invading tribes and to fight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to gather and hunt and all the physical </v>

2136
01:35:26.151 --> 01:35:30.800
<v Speaker 1>potential that your body is capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you do drain it with like a 10 mile</v>

2137
01:35:30.801 --> 01:35:33.950
<v Speaker 1>run or long cardio session,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long workout session,</v>

2138
01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:35.810
<v Speaker 1>then you can just be you.</v>

2139
01:35:35.970 --> 01:35:38.070
<v Speaker 2>It's the great purge man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The purge,</v>

2140
01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:39.480
<v Speaker 2>the purge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you prayers,</v>

2141
01:35:39.481 --> 01:35:41.120
<v Speaker 2>all that fucking demon shit out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2142
01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:44.430
<v Speaker 2>All the evil evil can't stand a 10 mile </v>
<v Speaker 2>run,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2146
01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:53.890
<v Speaker 1>but you can see things more clearly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is only available through effort.</v>

2147
01:35:53.891 --> 01:35:55.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's available through meditation.</v>

2148
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.823
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like there's a different </v>

2149
01:35:58.211 --> 01:35:59.044
<v Speaker 1>thing that's available through effort </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's also a satisfaction of </v>

2150
01:36:01.031 --> 01:36:01.864
<v Speaker 1>accomplishment.</v>

01:41:42.731 --> 01:41:43.720
<v Speaker 2>that's what keeps me.</v>

2280
01:41:44.050 --> 01:41:45.410
<v Speaker 2>Those are the sparks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2281
01:41:45.411 --> 01:41:47.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll look at motivation is just a spark.</v>

2282
01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:48.990
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like killing.</v>

2283
01:41:49.490 --> 01:41:52.270
<v Speaker 2>You know how a big fire starts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It starts with a little smoke.</v>

2284
01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:55.490
<v Speaker 2>It starts with a little cigarette being </v>
<v Speaker 2>thrown in the woods nicely.</v>

2285
01:41:55.610 --> 01:41:56.443
<v Speaker 2>All California's fucking burn up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I've been doing my whole </v>

2286
01:42:00.221 --> 01:42:04.210
<v Speaker 2>life is I find these little sparks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>once that little thing takes off,</v>

2287
01:42:04.211 --> 01:42:05.830
<v Speaker 2>that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a one hour of fuel,</v>

2288
01:42:06.090 --> 01:42:09.640
<v Speaker 2>10 you got 10 our fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can move that thing to what?</v>

2289
01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:11.650
<v Speaker 2>10,000?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our fuel,</v>

2290
01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:13.113
<v Speaker 2>these big logs and big trees that burned</v>
<v Speaker 2>for days and that's where you want to </v>

2291
01:42:15.851 --> 01:42:17.520
<v Speaker 2>bring that motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

2292
01:42:17.530 --> 01:42:20.550
<v Speaker 2>You want to bring that drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have no kingdom,</v>

2293
01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:23.050
<v Speaker 2>the killing is me going out with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>young guys saying,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it has now become that 10 hour fuel and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now that 10,000</v>

2298
01:42:34.571 --> 01:42:36.880
<v Speaker 2>hour fuels I used throughout my whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

2299
01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:39.070
<v Speaker 2>I use that term or whole life man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2301
01:42:41.950 --> 01:42:44.230
<v Speaker 2>So you know you're not giving up yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not done yet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Not Today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not done today.</v>

2303

<v Speaker 2>The wildland firefighters a very </v>

2304
01:42:49.721 --> 01:42:51.100
<v Speaker 2>interesting choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

2305
01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:54.040
<v Speaker 2>it is a nasty job man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because again,</v>

2306
01:42:54.041 --> 01:42:54.874
<v Speaker 2>that's the proof of concept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're really just doing it just </v>

2307
01:42:59.801 --> 01:43:00.970
<v Speaker 2>for the struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2308
01:43:01.310 --> 01:43:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Is there other things you considered </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that?</v>

2309
01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:05.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I will,</v>

2310
01:43:05.860 --> 01:43:09.970
<v Speaker 2>I apply for smoke jumping this year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll be a smoke jumper this year,</v>

2311
01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:11.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God willing.</v>

2312
01:43:12.110 --> 01:43:14.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where it's at now.</v>

2313
01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:18.460
<v Speaker 2>Now's my next military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the next military.</v>

2314
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:22.960
<v Speaker 2>And it's always about human growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not about money,</v>

2315
01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:25.330
<v Speaker 2>not about money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Human growth.</v>

2316
01:43:25.420 --> 01:43:26.620
<v Speaker 2>That's the biggest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

2317
01:43:26.621 --> 01:43:29.140
<v Speaker 2>my biggest trophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I turned down $300,000.</v>

2318
01:43:30.010 --> 01:43:31.660
<v Speaker 2>The biggest trophy in life is what I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned.</v>

2319
01:43:31.661 --> 01:43:32.494
<v Speaker 2>Like this brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I could put this brand in somebodies </v>

2320
01:43:33.970 --> 01:43:34.721
<v Speaker 2>head and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here you go,</v>

2321
01:43:34.721 --> 01:43:37.090
<v Speaker 2>merry Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd be a happy person.</v>

2322
01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:42.520
<v Speaker 2>When I found out is that with no crowds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one cheering for,</v>

2323
01:43:42.521 --> 01:43:43.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>

2324
01:43:43.991 --> 01:43:46.720
<v Speaker 2>no finish line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing,</v>

2325
01:43:46.810 --> 01:43:50.710
<v Speaker 2>amazing thing I've learned in my mind by</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one cheering you on.</v>

2326
01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:54.020
<v Speaker 2>Like what that is is every morning I do </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I do.</v>

2327
01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:57.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a trainer waking me up </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2328
01:43:57.680 --> 01:43:58.670
<v Speaker 2>No one saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>David,</v>

2329
01:43:58.671 --> 01:44:02.270
<v Speaker 2>you have to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to do anything anymore.</v>

2330
01:44:02.630 --> 01:44:05.540
<v Speaker 2>I've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the beauty of all of this.</v>

2331
01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:06.853
<v Speaker 2>Knowing that everything I talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one even knows what the fuck I'm </v>

2332
01:44:09.411 --> 01:44:14.270
<v Speaker 2>doing every day and I know that I am </v>
<v Speaker 2>grinding like a motherfucker.</v>

2333
01:44:14.630 --> 01:44:17.870
<v Speaker 2>They see a woman that video of me </v>
<v Speaker 2>running or some bullshit.</v>

2334
01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully it motivates you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Merry Christmas.</v>

<v Speaker 1>flawed and saying that you're very </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

2485
01:50:48.991 --> 01:50:49.824

<v Speaker 1>someone who bullshits and pretends </v>

2486
01:50:52.590 --> 01:50:57.590
<v Speaker 1>someone who puts up some fake ass </v>

<v Speaker 1>honesty and those people are a real </v>

2488
01:51:02.761 --> 01:51:03.594
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

2496
01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:18.193
<v Speaker 1>to view of constantly grinding and </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly putting in that work is what </v>

2497
01:51:20.731 --> 01:51:22.770
<v Speaker 1>leads you to be able to express </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

2498
01:51:22.771 --> 01:51:24.360
<v Speaker 1>So honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>doing it for fucking decades,</v>

2586
01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:49.790
<v Speaker 2>like the hands on me and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Goggins you coming home,</v>

2588
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:56.600
<v Speaker 2>but it's also a good thing to have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of cardio and endurance you have to</v>

2589
01:54:57.710 --> 01:54:58.370
<v Speaker 2>get people.</v>

2590
01:54:58.370 --> 01:54:59.220
<v Speaker 2>So I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2591
01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:01.670
<v Speaker 2>I've rolled with a lot of guys who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>skills,</v>

2592
01:55:02.330 --> 01:55:05.120
<v Speaker 2>but the thing that I really have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not gonna Brag on it,</v>

2593
01:55:05.121 --> 01:55:07.550
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got fucked up cardio base,</v>

2594
01:55:07.551 --> 01:55:08.384
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got fucked up cardio basement and my </v>

2595
01:55:11.271 --> 01:55:15.560
<v Speaker 2>mentality is kind of fucked up too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I realized that we're fighting.</v>

2596
01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:16.813
<v Speaker 2>If you get a big cardio base and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mindset is fucked up to cardio's almost </v>

2597
01:55:21.321 --> 01:55:22.950
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what skills,</v>

2598
01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:26.870
<v Speaker 2>skills are everything because a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys with skills also have some cardio.</v>

2599
01:55:26.871 --> 01:55:27.704
<v Speaker 2>They have enough to fuck you up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to have tremendous cardio with big </v>

2600
01:55:31.611 --> 01:55:34.880
<v Speaker 2>skills is everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see him a man dying.</v>

2601
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because so many guys started 100 </v>

2602
01:55:36.891 --> 01:55:39.050
<v Speaker 2>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but three minutes into the fight they're</v>

2603
01:55:39.051 --> 01:55:39.980
<v Speaker 2>at 80,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2604
01:55:40.010 --> 01:55:42.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five minutes into the fight there at 60.</v>

2605
01:55:42.410 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they for a minute</v>

2606
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:46.020
<v Speaker 1>they come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're,</v>

2607
01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:47.033
<v Speaker 1>if you're in like a rolling session,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you roll your role for nine </v>

2608
01:55:49.771 --> 01:55:54.000
<v Speaker 1>minutes straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you and this guy and most of the time</v>

2609
01:55:54.001 --> 01:55:56.790
<v Speaker 1>there's multiple taps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll tap him and he'll tap.</v>

2610
01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:59.490
<v Speaker 1>You tap each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But nine minutes man,</v>

2611
01:55:59.491 --> 01:56:02.340
<v Speaker 1>it is exhausting when that bell goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

2612
01:56:02.341 --> 01:56:03.174
<v Speaker 1>the last you know the bell for 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds and you got 30 seconds left in </v>

2613
01:56:07.231 --> 01:56:11.310
<v Speaker 1>nine minutes and then banging it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's done.</v>

2614
01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:12.173
<v Speaker 1>And then do you take a minute off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you find a new partner that's good shit </v>

2615
01:56:14.641 --> 01:56:16.230
<v Speaker 1>back in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd love it.</v>

2616
01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:18.840
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a good grind grind right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2617
01:56:18.841 --> 01:56:19.700
<v Speaker 1>You love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2618
01:56:19.740 --> 01:56:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Getting your black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2619
01:56:21.590 --> 01:56:24.030
<v Speaker 1>some of that take about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I went like this hard at it.</v>

2620
01:56:25.590 --> 01:56:26.423
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say because it depends </v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely upon how much emphasis you put </v>

2621
01:56:30.571 --> 01:56:33.090
<v Speaker 1>on learning new techniques and broiling </v>
<v Speaker 1>and drilling.</v>

2622
01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Drilling is gigantic and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that people don't like to do.</v>

2623
01:56:36.230 --> 01:56:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Cause Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fun.</v>

2624
01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:41.550
<v Speaker 1>People like to just roll because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sparring is where it's at.</v>

2625
01:56:41.551 --> 01:56:41.971
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2626
01:56:41.971 --> 01:56:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do those practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to choke people.</v>

2627
01:56:44.630 --> 01:56:46.440
<v Speaker 1>Like I knew a few things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do that.</v>

2628
01:56:46.441 --> 01:56:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do this.</v>

2629
01:56:47.830 --> 01:56:48.663
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me get in there and you want a lot </v>

2630
01:56:51.181 --> 01:56:52.014
<v Speaker 1>of Jujitsu schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll start out with like one or two </v>

2631
01:56:54.391 --> 01:56:57.300
<v Speaker 1>techniques and then you roll most of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>classes just sparring,</v>

2632
01:56:57.810 --> 01:57:01.890
<v Speaker 1>but the right way to do it really is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>drill way more than you spar.</v>

2633
01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:05.110
<v Speaker 1>She'd be drilling all the time and live </v>
<v Speaker 1>drilling too,</v>

2634
01:57:05.250 --> 01:57:08.430
<v Speaker 1>like you start out where God has your </v>
<v Speaker 1>back ready go,</v>

2635
01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:09.413
<v Speaker 1>and then from there you got to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>escape and do it the right thing to try </v>

2636
01:57:12.211 --> 01:57:13.044
<v Speaker 1>to use the right technique to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that position or you'll start out with </v>

2637
01:57:17.401 --> 01:57:18.234
<v Speaker 1>an arm bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's defending and you've got to </v>

2638
01:57:19.411 --> 01:57:23.040
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to extend it in those </v>
<v Speaker 1>live drills,</v>

2639
01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:24.990
<v Speaker 1>straight drills like technique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drills,</v>

2640
01:57:24.991 --> 01:57:25.824
<v Speaker 1>and then live drills are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think even more important in the </v>

2641
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:30.410
<v Speaker 1>beginning to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2642
01:57:30.410 --> 01:57:31.243
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your personal development and growth </v>

2643
01:57:32.251 --> 01:57:34.620
<v Speaker 1>as a Jujitsu player than even sparring.</v>

2644
01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:39.480
<v Speaker 1>But a guy like you who's smart and tough</v>
<v Speaker 1>and will go crazy shit.</v>

2645
01:57:40.140 --> 01:57:42.450
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't take that long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes people.</v>

2646
01:57:42.451 --> 01:57:43.284
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how much you dedicate </v>

2647
01:57:43.771 --> 01:57:44.604
<v Speaker 1>yourself to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bj Penn got his black belt in three </v>

2648
01:57:46.321 --> 01:57:47.154
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

2679
01:58:46.971 --> 01:58:47.804
<v Speaker 1>earlier too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the the mind has these </v>

2680
01:58:49.551 --> 01:58:51.980
<v Speaker 1>reserves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can trick it and pull them out.</v>

2681
01:58:52.110 --> 01:58:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inspirational reserves like you did when</v>

2682
01:58:55.251 --> 01:58:56.870
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>we just found that trigger and then all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of sudden you throw in that boat in the </v>

2684
01:59:00.471 --> 01:59:01.304
<v Speaker 1>air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mind always has the tactical </v>

2685
01:59:03.171 --> 01:59:06.580
<v Speaker 1>advantage over you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it it knows your fear</v>

2686
01:59:07.010 --> 01:59:10.320
<v Speaker 3>and nausea securities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It knows where their height can't hide.</v>

2687
01:59:10.350 --> 01:59:12.090
<v Speaker 3>You can't hide that motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2688
01:59:13.060 --> 01:59:15.360

<v Speaker 3>son.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get you man.</v>

2690
01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:18.773

<v Speaker 1>Your mind knows everything.</v>

2693
01:59:23.381 --> 01:59:25.250

<v Speaker 1>So don't ever try.</v>

2694
01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:28.310
<v Speaker 1>Don't try and beat that motherfucker up </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta.</v>

2695
01:59:28.330 --> 01:59:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Keep going at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also what you did in this book.</v>

2696
01:59:30.341 --> 01:59:31.174
<v Speaker 1>You didn't try to like paint yourself in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a glamorous or flattering way at any </v>

2697
01:59:35.771 --> 01:59:36.604
<v Speaker 1>point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were honest at every step of the </v>

2698
01:59:38.501 --> 01:59:39.334
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is just gigantic for </v>

2699
01:59:40.781 --> 01:59:45.280
<v Speaker 1>people too because you can tell when </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's stroking themselves,</v>

2700
01:59:45.490 --> 01:59:48.550
<v Speaker 1>bullshitting themselves is the message </v>
<v Speaker 1>just won't come through.</v>

2701
01:59:48.910 --> 01:59:51.490
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your you come through in this book,</v>

2703
01:59:54.221 --> 01:59:58.270
<v Speaker 1>how you became who you are and who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be and why you were with the way</v>

2704
01:59:58.271 --> 01:59:59.830
<v Speaker 1>you used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that comes through.</v>

2705
01:59:59.831 --> 02:00:02.380
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's no filter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just your,</v>

2706
02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:03.333
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you remember about your life and </v>

2707

<v Speaker 1>what you think about right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just all comes out onto the pages </v>

2708

02:00:10.881 --> 02:00:13.390
<v Speaker 1>I've done my entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2711
02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:18.100

<v Speaker 1>Then I walk up to people.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but they're all doing that to </v>

2726
02:00:52.291 --> 02:00:53.880
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't even understand.</v>

2727
02:00:53.881 --> 02:00:55.860
<v Speaker 3>When you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing it to yourself.</v>

2728
02:00:56.180 --> 02:00:58.380
<v Speaker 3>If you are attacking someone </v>

02:00:58.381 --> 02:00:59.214
<v Speaker 3>you know that they have a weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're pretending you don't have </v>

2730
02:01:01.081 --> 02:01:03.510
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are attacking yourself.</v>

2731
02:01:03.550 --> 02:01:06.790
<v Speaker 3>You are chipping away at your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal sovereignty,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's my biggest fear of man,</v>

2777
02:03:00.630 --> 02:03:04.680
<v Speaker 3>is that I know I can slip every goes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Heart rate's real low.</v>

2802
02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:06.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm really big into the heart rate </v>
<v Speaker 3>training,</v>

<v Speaker 3>So it makes you a machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes you a machine man.</v>

2805
02:04:12.031 --> 02:04:12.864
<v Speaker 3>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It trains your heart in a way that the </v>

2806
02:04:16.561 --> 02:04:17.394
<v Speaker 3>way I was able to run these hundred my </v>
<v Speaker 3>race like I was able to do it was awful </v>

2807
02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:20.273
<v Speaker 3>heart rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you go at 80 percent for me for </v>

2808
02:04:23.491 --> 02:04:25.800
<v Speaker 3>the longest time it was like 100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 1:47</v>

2809
02:04:25.801 --> 02:04:29.400
<v Speaker 3>heart rate within 48 to 1:52</v>
<v Speaker 3>right around in there.</v>

2810
02:04:29.850 --> 02:04:30.683
<v Speaker 3>If I maintain that man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in that I'm burning that nice fat </v>

2811
02:04:34.561 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 3>storage and that body wants utilize </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2812
02:04:38.380 --> 02:04:39.213
<v Speaker 2>It wants to burn that nice and slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're never getting that heart rate up </v>

<v Speaker 2>pro hockey and get your heart rate up or</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it takes a lot to recover from that </v>

2814
02:04:45.060 --> 02:04:47.730
<v Speaker 2>and hire ghost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The longer it takes for it to come down.</v>

2815
02:04:48.210 --> 02:04:50.260
<v Speaker 2>We're not staying at 1:45,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1:46</v>

2816
02:04:50.261 --> 02:04:53.400
<v Speaker 2>point 47 heart rate for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I get done running,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it will go back under 100 within two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three minutes.</v>

2818
02:04:56.630 --> 02:04:58.890

<v Speaker 2>You want that quick recovery.</v>

2819

<v Speaker 2>is right on point.</v>

2820
02:05:01.891 --> 02:05:02.724

<v Speaker 2>So I train everyday because why?</v>

2826
02:05:16.770 --> 02:05:17.603
<v Speaker 2>As far as my mind and as a human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're supposed to move everyday is </v>

2827
02:05:21.481 --> 02:05:24.750
<v Speaker 2>supposed to move and I'm not saying get </v>

2832
02:05:35.220 --> 02:05:38.940
<v Speaker 2>rehydrate your body as you're active </v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's the best way to rehydrate</v>

2833
02:05:38.941 --> 02:05:41.850
<v Speaker 2>your body and like taking a carbohydrate</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink.</v>

2834
02:05:43.230 --> 02:05:46.110

<v Speaker 2>You start to glycogen,</v>

2835
02:05:46.111 --> 02:05:46.944

<v Speaker 2>blood's flowing nice active blood flow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blood at the blood flow helps the </v>

2837
02:05:54.751 --> 02:05:58.260
<v Speaker 2>recovery process along with drinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

02:05:58.290 --> 02:05:59.123
<v Speaker 2>some like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>endurance drink or some carbohydrate </v>

2839
02:06:01.321 --> 02:06:02.154
<v Speaker 2>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets all that glycogen through the </v>

2840
02:06:03.751 --> 02:06:04.584
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to the muscles loads and back up </v>

<v Speaker 2>chest strap?</v>

2845
02:06:18.450 --> 02:06:19.283
<v Speaker 2>It's a nice cheap little gesture app.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now I'm at a point now where I know </v>

2846
02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:24.600
<v Speaker 2>I only do my heart rate in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2847
02:06:25.020 --> 02:06:26.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wherever not run anymore,</v>

2848
02:06:26.820 --> 02:06:27.653
<v Speaker 2>do check it with a strap in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 2>or you check the checkers just so you </v>

2849
02:06:30.811 --> 02:06:32.890
<v Speaker 2>wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just put the strap on before you got</v>

2850
02:06:32.891 --> 02:06:34.200
<v Speaker 2>to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put the strap on your body.</v>

2851
02:06:34.930 --> 02:06:36.330
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing you do,</v>

2852
02:06:36.890 --> 02:06:40.740
<v Speaker 2>put A strap on or do your finger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever one you can do,</v>

2853
02:06:40.741 --> 02:06:43.860
<v Speaker 2>even have a strap to your finger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know what your average heart rate is,</v>

2854
02:06:43.930 --> 02:06:45.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your resting heart rate.</v>

2855
02:06:45.420 --> 02:06:46.810
<v Speaker 2>And then from there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a little bit higher,</v>

2856
02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:48.270
<v Speaker 2>a little elevated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2857
02:06:48.271 --> 02:06:51.570
<v Speaker 2>you can't go off into that zone three </v>
<v Speaker 2>zone four training day.</v>

2858
02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:53.520
<v Speaker 2>You got to keep it at zillow and tours </v>
<v Speaker 2>on one.</v>

2859
02:06:54.090 --> 02:06:56.700
<v Speaker 2>So it's all about the heart rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the resting heart rate.</v>

2860
02:06:56.940 --> 02:06:58.460
<v Speaker 2>So when you use it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2861
02:06:58.490 --> 02:06:59.323
<v Speaker 2>the chest strap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it register on an application on a </v>

2862
02:07:01.531 --> 02:07:02.400
<v Speaker 2>phone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how do,</v>

2863
02:07:02.430 --> 02:07:04.290
<v Speaker 2>how do you read it on the watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a watch?</v>

2864
02:07:04.620 --> 02:07:07.170
<v Speaker 2>Is it a smartwatch or as a polar was to </v>
<v Speaker 2>polar watch.</v>

2865
02:07:07.171 --> 02:07:10.380
<v Speaker 2>So it's a wash that shows you the heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>rate that's reading off his trap.</v>

2866
02:07:10.440 --> 02:07:12.120
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So does.</v>

2867
02:07:12.330 --> 02:07:13.950
<v Speaker 2>And so wHen you say zone ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2868
02:07:14.100 --> 02:07:17.130
<v Speaker 2>these things that you've created,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zone ones onto the normal,</v>

2869
02:07:17.150 --> 02:07:19.650
<v Speaker 2>these are like zones that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's no,</v>

2870
02:07:19.651 --> 02:07:20.770
<v Speaker 2>whoever created this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2871
02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:21.713
<v Speaker 2>like the heart rate zone training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically what I did in help me out </v>

2872
02:07:26.071 --> 02:07:30.420
<v Speaker 2>so much as my zone two training runs </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to be an 8:30.</v>

2873
02:07:31.110 --> 02:07:34.460
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was my pace at like a 1:45</v>

2874
02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:35.313
<v Speaker 2>mile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 mile through stretching and give my </v>

2875
02:07:39.110 --> 02:07:39.943
<v Speaker 2>body opened up.</v>

2876
02:07:41.350 --> 02:07:44.710
<v Speaker 2>My zone to run now is about a seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>slasH 21,</v>

2877
02:07:44.980 --> 02:07:45.880
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18,</v>

2878
02:07:45.890 --> 02:07:46.723
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

2879
02:07:46.760 --> 02:07:47.593
<v Speaker 2>kind of minute off just by opening up </v>
<v Speaker 2>your range of motion up my range of </v>

2880
02:07:50.201 --> 02:07:51.370
<v Speaker 2>motion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2881
02:07:51.450 --> 02:07:52.283
<v Speaker 2>Unbelieve at the same exact heart rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my stride and people look at videos </v>

2882
02:07:55.931 --> 02:07:58.750
<v Speaker 2>and be like years ago when I was first </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing my first badwater look,</v>

2883
02:07:58.751 --> 02:08:00.400
<v Speaker 2>I was scooting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

2884
02:08:00.670 --> 02:08:03.700
<v Speaker 2>it was so tight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked at was this very rigid runner.</v>

2885
02:08:04.180 --> 02:08:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Now actually run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2886
02:08:06.580 --> 02:08:07.413
<v Speaker 2>everything was so tight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything was contact forming it as I </v>

2887
02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:10.233
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like my knees and my joints is </v>

2888
02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:15.880
<v Speaker 2>going inward now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>EverytHing's where it needs to be at and</v>

2889
02:08:15.881 --> 02:08:18.050
<v Speaker 2>I have a nice long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice,</v>

2890
02:08:18.051 --> 02:08:19.720
<v Speaker 2>dried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you run on the street?</v>

2891
02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:22.420
<v Speaker 2>I run most part and for the most part </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always traveling.</v>

2892
02:08:22.750 --> 02:08:24.460
<v Speaker 2>So the best thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get your runnIng shoes.</v>

2893
02:08:24.460 --> 02:08:26.020
<v Speaker 2>You'd get your shit and you just go out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and run.</v>

2894
02:08:26.380 --> 02:08:27.213
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to hit the trails some dirt as </v>

2895
02:08:28.691 --> 02:08:31.060
<v Speaker 2>much as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is really good for you.</v>

2896
02:08:31.070 --> 02:08:34.720
<v Speaker 2>But now my body is like fucking tech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking iron.</v>

2897
02:08:35.350 --> 02:08:38.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can take some beatings now when you,</v>

2898
02:08:38.921 --> 02:08:39.754
<v Speaker 2>when you run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ever fuck with those barefoot </v>

2899
02:08:41.321 --> 02:08:42.930
<v Speaker 2>running shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>

2900
02:08:43.040 --> 02:08:44.530
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2901
02:08:44.730 --> 02:08:45.330
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2902
02:08:45.330 --> 02:08:46.060
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2903
02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:47.560
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>

2904
02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:52.150
<v Speaker 2>I Don't know many people who have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in it.</v>

2905
02:08:52.540 --> 02:08:54.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe I've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was born with shoes,</v>

2906
02:08:54.820 --> 02:08:56.470
<v Speaker 2>wearing shoes my whole fucking life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

2907
02:08:56.890 --> 02:09:01.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm black but I'm not from africa so I,</v>

2908
02:09:01.690 --> 02:09:04.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm not down man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not dear it.</v>

2909
02:09:04.550 --> 02:09:08.490
<v Speaker 2>Read the science behind the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>using all the muscles in your feet.</v>

2910
02:09:09.310 --> 02:09:10.830
<v Speaker 2>I read the science behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also read,</v>

2911
02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:15.290
<v Speaker 2>sounds like motherfuckers have broken </v>
<v Speaker 2>feet and heard that too,</v>

2912
02:09:15.550 --> 02:09:18.410
<v Speaker 2>but minimal issues on trails aren't bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No they're not.</v>

2913
02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:21.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing it now and no man will </v>
<v Speaker 2>break.</v>

2914
02:09:21.370 --> 02:09:22.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2915
02:09:22.860 --> 02:09:24.520
<v Speaker 2>One of those things all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2916
02:09:24.521 --> 02:09:25.760
<v Speaker 2>Associates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you liked them?</v>

2917
02:09:26.010 --> 02:09:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would kill me,</v>

2918
02:09:27.821 --> 02:09:28.690
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what.</v>

2919
02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Ran in fat tires yesterday under armour </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat tire,</v>

2920
02:09:32.121 --> 02:09:33.830
<v Speaker 1>which is like a cushiony ass shoe.</v>

2921
02:09:33.900 --> 02:09:35.940
<v Speaker 2>You like it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so easy.</v>

2922
02:09:36.020 --> 02:09:38.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's like whatever.</v>

2923
02:09:38.490 --> 02:09:43.490
<v Speaker 1>I know under armour has these fat tires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically like a bmx tire track.</v>

2924
02:09:44.851 --> 02:09:47.640
<v Speaker 1>I think it's even made by a tire </v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

2925
02:09:47.641 --> 02:09:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Makes the tread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

2926
02:09:49.771 --> 02:09:53.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's got a mesh to it and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>run in these things,</v>

2927
02:09:53.101 --> 02:09:53.934
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could run over.</v>

2928
02:09:54.090 --> 02:09:56.640
<v Speaker 1>See the thing about those five finger </v>
<v Speaker 1>barefoot shoes.</v>

2929
02:09:57.510 --> 02:09:58.343
<v Speaker 1>I like running those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to look where you're </v>

2930
02:09:59.101 --> 02:10:02.340
<v Speaker 1>stepping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't step on any hard rocks game.</v>

2931
02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:03.753
<v Speaker 1>You will fuck up your foot quick cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's gonna go right into your </v>

2932
02:10:06.601 --> 02:10:08.070
<v Speaker 1>foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tiny little thin.</v>

2933
02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:11.730
<v Speaker 1>So I went from those to vivo in vivo </v>
<v Speaker 1>barefoot shoes.</v>

2934
02:10:11.850 --> 02:10:15.000
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you run on those bitches,</v>

2935
02:10:15.030 --> 02:10:20.030
<v Speaker 1>that is a cushiony glorious padding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you,</v>

2936
02:10:20.250 --> 02:10:22.170
<v Speaker 1>when you hit the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like smushy,</v>

2937
02:10:22.171 --> 02:10:24.480
<v Speaker 1>smushy smush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the other ones,</v>

2938
02:10:24.481 --> 02:10:25.860
<v Speaker 1>jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones with the boa.</v>

2939
02:10:25.890 --> 02:10:26.723
<v Speaker 1>It's cause it's just like got that </v>
<v Speaker 1>little click one that you just pulled </v>

2940
02:10:29.210 --> 02:10:29.670
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>YeaH,</v>

2941
02:10:29.670 --> 02:10:32.280
<v Speaker 1>like those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you twisted with that.</v>

2942
02:10:32.281 --> 02:10:34.080
<v Speaker 1>That's how you tighten it with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>little boa,</v>

2943
02:10:34.081 --> 02:10:34.914
<v Speaker 1>a adjuster thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a got a thread through it so </v>

2944
02:10:37.071 --> 02:10:38.390
<v Speaker 1>you have to lace it or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2945
02:10:38.391 --> 02:10:40.880
<v Speaker 1>It just slip them on and pop that sucker</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

2946
02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.190
<v Speaker 1>I like to feel the ground a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I run.</v>

2947
02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he barely feeling shit with those.</v>

2948
02:10:46.850 --> 02:10:47.683
<v Speaker 1>But I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My joints didn't bother me at all </v>

2949
02:10:50.511 --> 02:10:51.570
<v Speaker 1>yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy.</v>

2950
02:10:51.571 --> 02:10:52.404
<v Speaker 1>Like after a good solid run because most</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm running is hills pretty steep </v>

2951
02:10:57.020 --> 02:10:57.853
<v Speaker 1>and it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My ass and legs never been waiting away </v>

2952
02:10:59.510 --> 02:11:00.650
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>200.</v>

2954
02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

2955
02:11:03.621 --> 02:11:05.870
<v Speaker 1>the pounding of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2956
02:11:05.871 --> 02:11:06.704
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the constant pounding the feet to the </v>

2957
02:11:08.421 --> 02:11:10.130
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a,</v>

2958

<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's rough on the ankles.</v>

2959
02:11:11.781 --> 02:11:12.614
<v Speaker 1>It's rough on the joints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't feel it at all with those </v>

2960
02:11:15.351 --> 02:11:17.090
<v Speaker 1>fat tires.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I felt like I cheated.</v>

2962
02:11:20.180 --> 02:11:22.800
<v Speaker 1>I felt like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so much eAsier.</v>

<v Speaker 1>because he runs so many fuckIng miles.</v>

2968
02:11:33.351 --> 02:11:36.680
<v Speaker 1>He was running a marathon a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pretty much every day.</v>

2969
02:11:36.740 --> 02:11:38.510
<v Speaker 1>I did that for awhile back.</v>

2970
02:11:39.370 --> 02:11:44.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got wired in doing that shit man.</v>

2971
02:11:44.860 --> 02:11:46.950
<v Speaker 3>What is this right here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is,</v>

2972
02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:52.420
<v Speaker 3>this is when I ran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran a hundred and 50 mile trail race.</v>

2973
02:11:53.110 --> 02:11:57.250
<v Speaker 3>So the year before I did the same race.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 150 mile trail race.</v>

2974
02:11:57.251 --> 02:12:02.251
<v Speaker 3>I did it in I think around a 40 hours </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had to walk the last 60 miles.</v>

2975
02:12:02.590 --> 02:12:04.450
<v Speaker 3>got I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had pneumonia.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2977
02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:08.860

<v Speaker 3>I'm coming back here next year,</v>

2979
02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:15.160
<v Speaker 3>now I'm breaking the course record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went back and did like 32 hours.</v>

2980
02:12:16.420 --> 02:12:17.253
<v Speaker 3>Same race.</v>

2983
02:12:22.111 --> 02:12:24.600
<v Speaker 3>When you were Thirty three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you run in,</v>

2984
02:12:24.660 --> 02:12:25.493
<v Speaker 3>what shoes do you use?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now I'm wearing brooks and also </v>

2985
02:12:28.531 --> 02:12:31.050
<v Speaker 3>we're a six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it just depends on,</v>

2986
02:12:31.070 --> 02:12:32.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of train I'm in,</v>

2987
02:12:33.100 --> 02:12:34.200
<v Speaker 3>where I'm at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>

2988
02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:36.630
<v Speaker 3>For trails where you were running for </v>
<v Speaker 3>trails.</v>

2989
02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:37.553
<v Speaker 3>I actually,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

3007
02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:14.190
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3008
02:13:14.190 --> 02:13:15.600
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

3009
02:13:15.690 --> 02:13:16.523
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love their shoe bonus check or where </v>

3010
02:13:17.230 --> 02:13:18.680
<v Speaker 3>was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brooks addiction can.</v>

3011
02:13:18.700 --> 02:13:20.760
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my biomechanics was so messed up.</v>

3012
02:13:20.761 --> 02:13:21.594
<v Speaker 3>I tried so many different shoes and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was a so I can now wear a </v>

3013
02:13:24.871 --> 02:13:28.800
<v Speaker 3>neutral shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how I used to run and very few people</v>

3014
02:13:28.801 --> 02:13:33.360
<v Speaker 3>know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to have heel inserts,</v>

3015
02:13:33.420 --> 02:13:34.253
<v Speaker 3>heel wedges and get compression tape </v>
<v Speaker 3>because my body was pushed so far in </v>

3016
02:13:39.391 --> 02:13:42.240
<v Speaker 3>from being so tight in my hip flexors </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3017
02:13:42.241 --> 02:13:46.650
<v Speaker 3>So how I guess that's best dressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>fractures was my bottom mccastle there's</v>

3018
02:13:46.651 --> 02:13:48.150
<v Speaker 3>a picture of my toe in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can my,</v>

3019
02:13:48.510 --> 02:13:50.720
<v Speaker 3>my toes is Jan in front of my shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>

3020
02:13:50.730 --> 02:13:51.563
<v Speaker 3>My whole body has got this like bent in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you say in benton for people </v>

3021
02:13:55.930 --> 02:13:59.490
<v Speaker 3>just listening your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If your hands are flat on a table,</v>

3022
02:13:59.491 --> 02:14:04.491
<v Speaker 3>you're turning the outside of your hands</v>
<v Speaker 3>in so that your thumbs are going down.</v>

3023
02:14:04.650 --> 02:14:05.451
<v Speaker 3>Those are my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

3024
02:14:05.451 --> 02:14:07.350
<v Speaker 3>So those are my two big toes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3025
02:14:07.351 --> 02:14:10.620
<v Speaker 3>Going down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going down into the shoe and the outside</v>

3026
02:14:10.621 --> 02:14:12.390
<v Speaker 3>of your foot was up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was above it.</v>

3027
02:14:12.450 --> 02:14:14.040
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what I had to do to run,</v>

3028
02:14:14.041 --> 02:14:15.030
<v Speaker 3>because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>god,</v>

3029
02:14:15.031 --> 02:14:18.570
<v Speaker 3>I got stress fractures all time and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>feet were so fucked up.</v>

3030
02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:20.220
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you see that with peopLe's </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoes,</v>

3031
02:14:20.221 --> 02:14:21.780
<v Speaker 3>like how they're worn out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>worn out,</v>

3032
02:14:21.781 --> 02:14:24.930
<v Speaker 3>worn out on a sideways example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a wedge,</v>

3033
02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:26.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we look at it from behind the crazy?</v>

3034
02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was my shoe.</v>

3035
02:14:28.081 --> 02:14:32.120
<v Speaker 3>So I had to get a heel wedge to keep my </v>
<v Speaker 3>heel from going down.</v>

3036
02:14:32.150 --> 02:14:32.983
<v Speaker 3>Guys sit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Severe tendinitis in the back of my </v>

3037
02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:35.580
<v Speaker 3>ankle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's actually,</v>

3038
02:14:35.581 --> 02:14:40.260
<v Speaker 3>you had to make it thicker on one side </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the inside flat.</v>

3039
02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:41.260
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the insight,</v>

3040
02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:43.440
<v Speaker 3>I had a pushup and had to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>compression tape.</v>

3041
02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:47.370
<v Speaker 3>So it was compression tape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heel wedges and an insert.</v>

3042
02:14:48.060 --> 02:14:48.893
<v Speaker 3>And that's how I ran every fucking day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then did you go to a running coach </v>

3043
02:14:51.871 --> 02:14:53.070
<v Speaker 3>or anything digital?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3044
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:59.310
<v Speaker 3>but did you want to know what you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing wrong?</v>

3045
02:14:59.311 --> 02:15:00.001
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3046
02:15:00.001 --> 02:15:01.770
<v Speaker 3>that was part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Granted more mindset,</v>

3047
02:15:01.771 --> 02:15:02.521
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it,</v>

3048
02:15:02.521 --> 02:15:03.480
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm supposEd to be broken.</v>

3049
02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:04.753
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I got smarter as time went and </v>

3050
02:15:07.630 --> 02:15:12.120
<v Speaker 3>him and this is painful shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Running 100 mile races with this kind of</v>

3051
02:15:12.121 --> 02:15:15.120
<v Speaker 3>tendonitis and my feet being fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so painful.</v>

3052
02:15:15.870 --> 02:15:16.660
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no way.</v>

3053
02:15:16.660 --> 02:15:18.960
<v Speaker 3>So then that's what started stretching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3054
02:15:18.961 --> 02:15:21.120
<v Speaker 3>my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this was from having a tie.</v>

3055
02:15:21.180 --> 02:15:22.560
<v Speaker 3>I got so mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god,</v>

3056
02:15:22.561 --> 02:15:23.394
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't all these different </v>

3057
02:15:24.031 --> 02:15:27.120
<v Speaker 3>contraptions and now I just wear a </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of running shoe.</v>

3058
02:15:27.780 --> 02:15:28.770
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3059
02:15:28.830 --> 02:15:31.350
<v Speaker 3>So I went from being contraption up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3060
02:15:31.890 --> 02:15:32.723
<v Speaker 3>like literally contraption up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's all just the stretching that </v>

3061
02:15:35.551 --> 02:15:36.384
<v Speaker 3>opened up the range of motion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now when people talk about range of </v>

3062
02:15:39.811 --> 02:15:43.080
<v Speaker 3>motion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't understand how tight I was,</v>

3063
02:15:43.110 --> 02:15:43.943
<v Speaker 3>like no one understands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you repeatedly do what I was </v>

3064
02:15:47.611 --> 02:15:52.080
<v Speaker 3>doing to myself and you were born with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the stress I was born under,</v>

3065
02:15:52.620 --> 02:15:54.930
<v Speaker 3>like I hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't paint a clear.</v>

3066
02:15:55.440 --> 02:15:57.900
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty clear in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3067
02:15:58.290 --> 02:16:01.180
<v Speaker 3>My life was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stress I adored on daily.</v>

3068
02:16:01.340 --> 02:16:02.173
<v Speaker 3>I had two people and my body was proof </v>
<v Speaker 3>of literally what my life was doing to </v>

3069
02:16:07.591 --> 02:16:08.424
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It literally was not at all my muscles </v>

3070
02:16:10.591 --> 02:16:12.780
<v Speaker 3>up because I was always under this fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>or flight,</v>

3071
02:16:13.170 --> 02:16:13.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

3072
02:16:13.660 --> 02:16:16.470
<v Speaker 3>my dad had made me so fucking scared as </v>
