1
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.510
Two one you're going to give me a two.
One of the ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.160
and this is how it begins.

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.670
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you today.

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.550
We have a new sponsor today,
Brian,
who we just for today's show,

5
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:18.630
it's audible.com and if you,
uh,
if you're,

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.730
if you're interested,
if you like travel,
if you do anything where you're,

7
00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:25.200
you're in your car and you're commuting.
Audio books are the shit.

8
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.660
I'm a fucking huge fan of audio books.

9
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.680
<v 1>The Steve Martin one is the most highly recommended audible book you can</v>

10
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.400
possibly get.
Steve Martin fucking doing it.
And it's like,

11
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.020
it's like listening to a movie because he's talking about his life.
I,

12
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.850
it's brilliant.
It's,
he's one of those dudes and I would love to talk to,

13
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:45.240
but I would never talk to him.
I'd be terrified.
Oh,
that's my dream.

14
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.680
I think Braille is kind of tough on audible,
but yeah,
than that.

15
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.950
They don't have Braille and audibly,
you silly goose look good.

16
00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:54.050
They make Braille from the Internet.

17
00:00:54.051 --> 00:00:58.080
It's probably just a triangle sound like Ding,
Ding,
Ding,
Ding.
Like Morse code.

18
00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.910
Wow.
Yeah.

19
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.280
<v 0>What the fuck is that possible?
I guess it is,
right?
All right,</v>

20
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.180
well if you look at like Sumerian texts,
all the old,
old,

21
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.890
the most ancient languages was a symbol,
a bunch of series of the same symbols,

22
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.130
like ones and twos and threes.
Like they didn't really vary that much.

23
00:01:15.131 --> 00:01:16.480
They all pretty much look the same.

24
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.860
It's fucking crazy when you start thinking about that.
Like you,
you,

25
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.670
you could make Braille,
Braille works,
you know,
it's just little dots.

26
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.720
But that works too.

27
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.350
You know that you could literally express your language through that whole
thing.

28
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.620
Yeah.

29
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.030
The whole fucking thing that has nothing to do with audible.com though we got

30
00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:36.970
sidetracked son and he a way,

31
00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:41.650
audible.com is a great resource for any audio books.
And uh,

32
00:01:41.651 --> 00:01:45.400
there's some that you can get from our friends that had been on the podcast for

33
00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:48.880
like Bobcat Goldthwait.
He's got a great audio book called,

34
00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:50.050
I don't mean to insult you,

35
00:01:50.051 --> 00:01:54.730
but you look like bobcat cult weight and it's narrated by him.

36
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.820
So it's gotta be awesome.
And,
uh,

37
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.830
you can get that on audible.com and if you are interested in go to audible,

38
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.950
I can't even read anymore.
Ladies and gentleman.
Oh

39
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.340
<v 1>Joe,
you need to start wearing glasses.
Oh,
podcasts.
Yeah,</v>

40
00:02:09.341 --> 00:02:13.210
no audible podcast.com.
Forward Slash Joe Rogan.
I do.

41
00:02:13.211 --> 00:02:15.580
I need some reading glasses.
You know what you need to do?

42
00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:19.960
You need to do it already does.
He goes and finds the coolest pair of sunglasses,

43
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.230
you know?
Well then he just by stops the frames and puts it in.
Well,

44
00:02:23.231 --> 00:02:23.711
you know what it is?

45
00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:27.760
This alien ware Laptop has looked at super high resolution and in my defense the

46
00:02:27.761 --> 00:02:32.050
print is like tiny,
teensy weensy.
It's really hard.
Yeah,
totally.
Yes.
I fucked up.

47
00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:34.270
I don't know how to fix it though.
And it's display more operators.

48
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.730
I'm a MAC person.
I don't know how to uh,
how to use this nonsense.
Isn't it?

49
00:02:37.731 --> 00:02:40.570
Control panel,
display properties or something like that.
Where's that Mac?

50
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.260
I can't,
whatever.
I'll just deal with it.

51
00:02:44.261 --> 00:02:47.380
Remember how the control panel and windows turned into like more of like a weird

52
00:02:47.381 --> 00:02:49.700
list and it's like,
wait,
no,
I need icons.

53
00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:51.600
And then you had to go back to classic view.

54
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.160
Now I can't find classic view and windows seven.
Can you,
I haven't even tried.

55
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.920
I know.
Um,
anyway,
go to audible.
Com

56
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.400
<v 2>out of a podcast,
uh,

but no audible podcast,</v>

57
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.190
[inaudible] dot com

58
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.200
<v 0>Ford Slash Joe Rogan and,
uh,</v>

59
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.380
go check out some of the cool books at book that I recommend.
Uh,

60
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.950
one of my favorite books is the war of art,
uh,
winning the inner creative battle.

61
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.810
It's by Steven Pressfield and it's a narrated by a dude named George.

62
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.060
I don't want to say his name wrong.
Gui Doll,
G.
U.
I.
D.
A.
L.
L we'd all,

63
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.550
um,
but it's a,

64
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.180
that's one of my favorite most inspirational books as far as creativity goes.

65
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.180
And uh,
it'd be even better if someone could say it for you.

66
00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:37.040
You don't even have to use your eyeballs.

67
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.343
<v 2>Oh,</v>

68
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.550
I just downloaded sex at dawn yesterday from Christopher Ryan off.
Yeah,

69
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.140
that guy was just on my friend Dunkin's podcast.

70
00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:49.410
And I'm going to try to get them on mine too.
He sounds like a fascinating guy.

71
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.320
Yeah,
but your book,
uh,

72
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.950
this is Robb wolf we're talking to here is not available on audio yet.

73
00:03:54.951 --> 00:03:57.010
Soon audible we'll get on it.

74
00:03:57.011 --> 00:04:00.600
Son were also vods to buy a on it.com that's o and n

75
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.680
<v 0>tea makers of Alpha brain new mood and shroom tech sport shroom tech sport is</v>

76
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:08.010
and stuff that we were talking about that as the quarter steps mushrooms in it

77
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.430
totally legit is legit.
It's not cheap folks is not cheap to get.

78
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:16.090
It's expensive stuff but it really does work.
It's great for energy.

79
00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:20.440
Like if you're a person who's like in a crossfit or you're in the Jujitsu or

80
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:24.640
something like really intense,
I really recommend shroom tech sport.

81
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:27.610
You will feel a difference and it's not like an edgy difference,

82
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:31.660
like a caffeine difference.
It's like a prolonged ability to work difference.

83
00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:33.220
It's really interesting.
It was,

84
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.820
it wasn't a discovered by a cattle people or something like that.

85
00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:39.910
They noticed that their,
their cows were eating them and being more active,

86
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.910
<v 2>a quarter sepsis,
an old traditional Chinese medicine Gig,</v>

87
00:04:43.911 --> 00:04:47.960
like it's grown out of uh,
uh,
this fungus that grows on a caterpillar.

88
00:04:47.961 --> 00:04:50.380
It's totally crazy.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

89
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.550
So there's all kinds of weird stuff going on with it,

90
00:04:52.551 --> 00:04:56.660
but it's been in Chinese medicine for ages and then a limpic athletes using it.

91
00:04:56.661 --> 00:05:00.680
It does some cool stuff.
That's it.
It's a fascinating way.
I mean,

92
00:05:00.681 --> 00:05:01.730
how do you find that out?

93
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.760
How do you find out how many fuckers die eating weird things growing on

94
00:05:07.101 --> 00:05:09.530
caterpillars and stuff and they're like,
dude,
okay,

95
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.660
this guy now is jacked and you know,
like can run up the hill,

96
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.950
the fuck a weird mushroom that grows on a caterpillar that's so ridiculous kind

97
00:05:19.791 --> 00:05:22.460
of PowerPoint.
It's caterpillar,
like mock boob.

98
00:05:22.461 --> 00:05:26.090
You became enlightened by spoken month.
That's right,
isn't it?
I mean,

99
00:05:26.091 --> 00:05:27.440
what the fuck is wrong with people?

100
00:05:27.441 --> 00:05:30.410
How does anyone ever find that out with all the time and the earth?

101
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.730
I think you're really hungry that day.
Like you're really hungry.

102
00:05:34.731 --> 00:05:37.850
And they just noticed that when they eat this certain caterpillar that give,

103
00:05:37.851 --> 00:05:41.300
that has this funky smell to it.
Maybe that's the quarter subs.

104
00:05:41.301 --> 00:05:42.980
Mushrooms on the Caterpillar.
Yeah,

105
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.710
but how'd they figure out that it's the mushroom that does it.

106
00:05:45.711 --> 00:05:47.810
Not the caterpillar.
I don't know.

107
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.350
Imagine if they fucked that up for a while and we were all just eating.

108
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.780
Caterpillar is hoping to get yoked.
No,
no,
no.
It's the other piece.

109
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.190
The way the wrong Pete and Shitty bugs.
Most bugs not taste that bad.

110
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.700
<v 0>Contrary to popular belief,
when we ate bugs on fear factor,</v>

111
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:05.160
I had quite a few bugs.
They really don't taste bad.
It's still the law,

112
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.440
the psychologic mouthfeel,
the crunchiness and the,

113
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.050
but they're really bland.
They don't,
they don't taste path.

114
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:15.050
There's a lot of stuff to taste a lot worse than bugs.
Anyway,

115
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.710
[inaudible] dot com go get yourself some shrimp tech sport son,

116
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.720
get your workout on.
We also have kettle bells and battle ropes in which I just,

117
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:27.500
I just started using battle ropes.
I have never done that before,
but man,
that's,

118
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:31.630
that's an awesome workout and awkward,
weird workout too.
You know the bus.
Yep.

119
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.650
Yeah.
Especially when it closed.
Yeah,
no man,
I'm fucking,
I do a caveman style.

120
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:41.010
I think it's important that everything you do,
you should be able to do naked.
Um,

121
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.230
but uh,
with battle ropes are,
it's like 40 foot ropes.
They're big,
thick,

122
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.530
like the kind you'd use like on a giant ship or some shit and you,

123
00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:54.710
uh,
you throw your arms around,
he'd do all these crazy exercises with them.
Uh,

124
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.140
and it's amazing for endurance,
mad at something.
I mean,

125
00:06:57.141 --> 00:07:01.760
he really blows you out so fast and it's really grappling specific to your,

126
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.490
you're pushing and pulling your,
stabilizing the midline line.
So yeah,

127
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:08.080
they're good.
It seems like it would completely translate.
And uh,

128
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.620
between that Kettlebells,
Chin ups and body weight squats,

129
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.010
that's pretty much all I do.
I,
everything I do is with kettle bells.

130
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.630
It's either kettle bells or battle ropes and battle ropes is a new thing,

131
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.280
but it's like I don't want to do anything else.

132
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:25.460
I have no time for just not enough time in the world.

133
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.240
I want to be able to get strength and conditioning done like quickly.

134
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:34.370
So for me doing the whole body like as one big motion like that,
you know,

135
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:38.390
like kettle bell type stuff or clean and jerks,
you know,
that to me is like,

136
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.920
feels like this stuff that's translates the most to real world's strength and it

137
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:45.860
shouldn't take you that long to,
and you see a lot of people spent,

138
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.040
particularly in the fighting team,

139
00:07:47.041 --> 00:07:50.420
spending too much time in the gym and not enough time just refining skills.
Yeah,

140
00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:51.021
absolutely.

141
00:07:51.021 --> 00:07:54.140
They get to a point where they think that conditioning is the end all be all

142
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.130
until you fight a guy who's got great skill and conditioning and then you

143
00:07:58.131 --> 00:08:01.220
realize,
well no,
I fucked myself cause I spent too many,

144
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:05.360
too many days running up hills and not enough days working on my head movement.

145
00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:10.850
Right.
That has nothing to do with kettlebells and or a battle ropes,

146
00:08:10.851 --> 00:08:15.020
which are for sale at audit does it?
Smart conditioning.
Yeah.
It is.
Um,

147
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.300
all this stuff,
when it comes to supplements,

148
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.380
nootropics are very controversial subject.
And because of that,

149
00:08:21.381 --> 00:08:24.830
we want to make sure that nobody ever feels ripped off.
You Buy Alpha brain,

150
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.320
the first 30 pills,
he's a hundred percent money back guarantee.

151
00:08:27.321 --> 00:08:28.071
If you don't like it,

152
00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:30.680
you don't even have to send the pills back to say this shit doesn't work.

153
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.930
It does.
That's why we were willing to do that.
And that's why I use it.

154
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.540
I wouldn't use it.
I wouldn't tell you to use it if I didn't even believe in it.

155
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:43.340
I think there's a lot of essential nutrients that that can benefit people.

156
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:48.340
And uh,
most people aren't taking them official oils and you know,
and,

157
00:08:48.341 --> 00:08:51.880
and eating a healthy diet and,
but there are certain nutrients that,

158
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.960
that have been proven and shown in task to have a positive effect on your mental

159
00:08:57.181 --> 00:09:00.690
clarity,
your ability to solve problems,
your ability to see things.

160
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:03.120
And like the recent ingredient in Alpha brain f,

161
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.060
I don't even remember the name of this shit.
I should look it up,

162
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.910
especially with you here because you're super smart.
What's in it?
Ah,
it's,
it's,

163
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.340
it's,
it's all like,
it's nootropics.
It's all,
um,

164
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.650
vitamins for mental function.

165
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.990
If you can read all the ingredients in this dark room who pay like an eagle eye

166
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:21.960
mother fucker.

167
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.240
<v 3>But yeah,
it's a bunch of a bunch of stuff that stimulates dopamine release.</v>

168
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.880
<v 0>Yeah.
It's all legit.
Yeah.
It's all stimulating your neurotransmitters.</v>

169
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.090
And for me what it does is it helps,
I don't know,
it sounds ridiculous,

170
00:09:35.091 --> 00:09:38.630
but it helps things feel smoother,
helps my thoughts flow better and smoother.

171
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:43.580
And we have a shitload of positive responses from people that have used it.

172
00:09:43.581 --> 00:09:46.220
So if you're interested,
check it out.
Use a code name.
Rogan,

173
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.820
you could save 10% off.
All right.
You freaks.
Robb Wolf is here.

174
00:09:49.821 --> 00:09:53.070
We're ready to get this party started.
We've got to learn.

175
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:55.583
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

176
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.720
<v 0>cause we should experience.</v>

177
00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.680
<v 4>Let's try it by day.
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day,</v>

178
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.510
dude.
Hey

179
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.830
<v 0>the fuck did you do Brian?
Hey man,
thanks for doing this.
I appreciate it.</v>

180
00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:17.960
I appreciate you coming on.
My pleasure,
man.
I'm,
I'm wanting to,
I w you,

181
00:10:17.961 --> 00:10:22.340
you've sorta like this whole thing is Paleo solution.
Your book has like a,

182
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:28.110
I think started like I like a new level of people thinking about,
uh,

183
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:32.630
about health and about like what the body's naturally supposed to be breaking

184
00:10:32.631 --> 00:10:35.570
down,
you know?
And uh,
yeah.
How did you do that?

185
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.620
How'd you like figure out what,
you know so many before,

186
00:10:39.621 --> 00:10:41.270
hadn't you?
Will you know it,

187
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.710
<v 3>I've got to give a bunch of credit to my professor Loren Cordain cause he's the</v>

188
00:10:44.711 --> 00:10:48.010
guy that did a ton of the research really early on.

189
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.760
So almost 15 years ago,
maybe further back than that,

190
00:10:51.761 --> 00:10:55.780
I was a California state power lifting champion.
I was into kickboxing,

191
00:10:55.781 --> 00:10:59.860
I was totally into athletics and all that and always trying to figure out what's

192
00:10:59.861 --> 00:11:02.710
the best way to fuel my body,
like looking for better performance.

193
00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:04.330
And I tried a high carb,

194
00:11:04.331 --> 00:11:09.331
low fat Vegan Diet and I went from 185 pounds able to back squat almost 600

195
00:11:09.521 --> 00:11:14.350
pounds down to 135 pounds.
And like sick,

196
00:11:14.351 --> 00:11:17.800
I had all kinds of gut problems,
all sort of colitis,
irritable bowel,

197
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.600
like all kinds of poop related stuff.

198
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:23.110
And this idea of the Paleo Diet just,

199
00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:27.820
it was kind of weird how it got on my radar,
but I was kinda thinking,
okay,
these,

200
00:11:27.821 --> 00:11:29.740
uh,
these neolithic foods,
grains,

201
00:11:29.741 --> 00:11:33.490
legumes and dairy seemed to have some problems for us with regards to health.

202
00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:37.210
And so I started eating that way and then I was a research biochemist at the

203
00:11:37.211 --> 00:11:41.470
time doing lipid metabolism research related to cancer and auto immune disease.

204
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:46.690
So I was able to experiment on myself and then also do some research and that's

205
00:11:46.691 --> 00:11:47.441
how I,
you know,

206
00:11:47.441 --> 00:11:52.441
this whole kind of evolutionary biology thing got on my radar and opened a gym,

207
00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.130
started,
you know,
using

208
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.120
<v 2>this with our clients.</v>

209
00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:59.800
Our Jim made a men's health top 30 gyms in America within a couple of years.

210
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.270
And then the book has been on the bestseller list for like two years.
And like,

211
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.410
there's been no marketing budget.
Nothing other than just like word of mouth.

212
00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:10.930
People buy the book,
they get benefit and then they,
you know,

213
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:14.440
they just go from there.
That's pretty incredible,
man.
That's,
that's a,

214
00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:18.820
a like a diet revolution.
And,
uh,
you know,
I've talked to a lot of fighters that,

215
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:21.810
uh,
take it.
Uh,
I know Frank Mir is not a paleo.
Yeah,

216
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.440
I'm sure a lot of other ones are as well.
There's a ton of people,
you know,
and,

217
00:12:26.441 --> 00:12:29.290
and I just encourage people to tinker with something.

218
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:31.750
Like there's a lot of guys doing vegan diets right now and they see a

219
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:34.210
performance groups.
That's totally cool.
Like I,
I,

220
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.220
I think that people should get in,

221
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.600
maybe get some blood work before they start a change track biomarkers of health

222
00:12:40.601 --> 00:12:44.500
and disease.
Do it for 30 days,
see how they look,
feel and perform.
Check it again.

223
00:12:44.501 --> 00:12:46.690
Like it should be really empirical.

224
00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:48.580
Like there's some theory behind all this stuff,

225
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:52.090
but you should really get in and it should be your personal experience that

226
00:12:52.091 --> 00:12:54.970
dictates this.
And if it's not making you perform better,

227
00:12:54.971 --> 00:12:58.870
if you don't sleep better,
if your body comp isn't better than,
do something else.

228
00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.990
You know,
is a paleo diet good for everybody?

229
00:13:01.991 --> 00:13:06.490
Or there's some different body types that would enjoy a different diet?

230
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.550
Or do you think that that's like the optimum digest for human beings?

231
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.700
I think it's good for everybody,
but within that,
you know,

232
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.100
some guys are gonna do pretty well on low carb.

233
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.330
Other people are going to bonk and they're going to do terribly.
So just for the,

234
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.920
for the total layman,
when it comes down to nutrition,

235
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.960
explain to people exactly what it means.
The Paleo Diet,

236
00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.870
it means what people ate essentially during the Paleolithic people.
Yeah.
Yeah.

237
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.680
And this is a period of time when we really changed from the previous ancestors.

238
00:13:32.681 --> 00:13:36.340
When you look into the anthropological record and when you look at our genetics,

239
00:13:36.341 --> 00:13:39.190
it's pretty darn similar to what,
you know,
the,

240
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:41.890
the people were living during the Paleolithic time.

241
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.440
And we can kind of verify that with different,

242
00:13:44.441 --> 00:13:48.100
like there's just a place to Max Planck Institute of evolutionary genetics in

243
00:13:48.101 --> 00:13:49.120
Leipzig,
Germany,
you know,

244
00:13:49.121 --> 00:13:53.860
and they do all the kind of scientific validation of this stuff,
but it,

245
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.310
you know,

246
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.610
it brass tax really it's talking about eating lots of fruits and vegetables,

247
00:13:57.611 --> 00:14:02.260
roots and tubers,
lean meats and kind of steering away from grains,

248
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:03.071
legumes and dairy,

249
00:14:03.071 --> 00:14:06.850
these newer foods that for a lot of people cause a lot of problems.

250
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.700
That's a fascinating thing when you think about it,

251
00:14:09.701 --> 00:14:14.701
how our technology and our ability to process food and grow food and store food

252
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:19.870
has evolved much faster than the body's capable of,
of,
of doing on its own.

253
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.980
Right.
It seems like that it's,

254
00:14:21.981 --> 00:14:26.170
it's kind of a fascinating thing with human beings is that we essentially have

255
00:14:26.171 --> 00:14:28.810
the same bodies that cavemen did,

256
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.640
but we have all this new stuff that we've sort of added to the mix and haven't,

257
00:14:33.641 --> 00:14:36.730
we haven't really figured out what the longterm effects of this are.
Yeah.

258
00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:41.380
And you know,
everything from sleep,
like if you start doing some googling around,

259
00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:43.750
unlike sleep and health,
sleep and diabetes,
you know,

260
00:14:43.751 --> 00:14:45.760
we don't sleep the way that we used to use do.

261
00:14:45.761 --> 00:14:48.490
The Sun went down and we went down.
You know,
the sun comes up,

262
00:14:48.491 --> 00:14:50.860
we get up now we have this extended photo,

263
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:55.640
we have light on us all the time and it messes with our circadian rhythm.

264
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:59.540
The way that we released Melatonin,
the way that we heal.
So,
you know,

265
00:14:59.541 --> 00:15:03.740
the whole lifestyle package,
exercise and nutrition lifestyle,

266
00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:07.270
the way that we don't really interact with a social group,
the way that,
you know,

267
00:15:07.271 --> 00:15:10.460
it was kind of wired in.
I think that that's why things like crossfit,

268
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:11.420
different gyms,

269
00:15:11.421 --> 00:15:15.270
different social networks are really valuable for people because we live in a,

270
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:19.370
you know,
we're tribal in our DNA.
Like we seek that out and if you don't have it,

271
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.580
it fucks with you,
like at damages you.
Wow,
that's interesting.
So what,

272
00:15:23.581 --> 00:15:26.750
what's fun about crossfit is that you become a part of a team and you're all

273
00:15:26.751 --> 00:15:31.060
work together and you're like fellow crossfitters and you.
Yeah.
Well,

274
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.900
I see that for sure in Jujitsu.

275
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.260
I see that in martial arts it's always been the case in martial arts.

276
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.080
You know that your,
your gym becomes like your family.
Yeah,
yeah.
The,

277
00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.100
the exercise becomes almost secondary.
It's like that,
you know,

278
00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:47.600
making sure that you CPS.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's true.
That's definitely true.

279
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:52.250
It is fascinating.
How are our needs are essentially the same but wow.

280
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:56.660
Have we done a crazy job of changing our environment in such a short period of

281
00:15:56.661 --> 00:16:00.530
time?
It's almost like we just really can't keep up with that.

282
00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:04.400
What we've been able to do.
Our body just can't keep up with it and you know,

283
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.020
travel and shit like that.
And if you look at some native populations,

284
00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:14.021
like they are crushed by type two diabetes and auto immune diseases and they

285
00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:18.260
were eating basically a paleo type diet maybe only a couple of hundred years
ago.

286
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.610
So you know,
the,

287
00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:24.470
depending on your genetic ancestry you might be able to deal with,

288
00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.453
you know,

289
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.460
high fructose corn syrup or something a little bit better than somebody else.

290
00:16:28.461 --> 00:16:33.461
It's maybe like native American or African American because their ancestry is

291
00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:34.400
just,

292
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.210
just young enough with regards to being exposed to this modern environment that

293
00:16:38.211 --> 00:16:42.820
they don't cope with it.
Like it's that much more damaging to them.
Wow.

294
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.900
So,
um,
what about processed foods?

295
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.000
What about like ingredients or processed foods?

296
00:16:50.001 --> 00:16:53.120
What are the long term negative effects of,
you know,

297
00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.850
you hear the processed foods are bad for people.

298
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.330
What are the longterm effects of eating something that has so much preservatives

299
00:16:59.331 --> 00:17:02.880
in it that it couldn't just sit around,
you know,
it,

300
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:08.150
you just look around and you look at like the diabetes epidemic and,
and uh,

301
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:13.040
you know,
autism spectrum,
it accelerating.
It's just everything from cancer,

302
00:17:13.041 --> 00:17:15.560
diabetes,
heart disease,
Parkinson's,
Alzheimer's,

303
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.650
all of this is related to this process called inflammation.

304
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.890
And inflammation is kind of an over activity of the immune response.

305
00:17:21.891 --> 00:17:23.870
And interesting with the courthouse steps product,

306
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:26.060
it actually modulates the immune response.

307
00:17:26.061 --> 00:17:28.430
It makes the immune system do what it's supposed to do,

308
00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.070
whether you're under stress or exercising or whatever.

309
00:17:31.071 --> 00:17:32.810
And that's kind of the benefit of that stuff.

310
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:36.170
And the negative part of the way that we're living.
We don't get enough sleep.

311
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.380
We eat the wrong types of foods,
we don't really exercise enough.

312
00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:43.460
And all of that kind of sends a weird signal to our immune system and it tends

313
00:17:43.461 --> 00:17:46.730
to make you diabetic or it can make you autoimmune or it can accelerate things

314
00:17:46.731 --> 00:17:51.390
like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.
So know we're,
we were facing,

315
00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:55.740
there's some projections and this is from like,
you know,
governmental agencies.

316
00:17:55.741 --> 00:18:00.240
There is Orthodox as it gets.
We're looking at by like 2030 that,
you know,

317
00:18:00.241 --> 00:18:03.930
we're going to have a 300% of GDP being allocated to our debt.

318
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:09.380
And then most of that being allocated to health care and it's nuts.

319
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:10.621
You know,

320
00:18:10.621 --> 00:18:14.940
we know more about disease and cancer and everything that we've ever known,

321
00:18:14.941 --> 00:18:18.960
but yet people are getting sicker faster than they ever have.
It's crazy.

322
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:24.860
And it's just a lack of lack of nutrition and the lack of supplying the body

323
00:18:25.711 --> 00:18:30.660
with what it's always had,
the essentials,
the vegetables,

324
00:18:30.661 --> 00:18:33.120
the fresh vegetables and fresh meats.

325
00:18:33.121 --> 00:18:37.950
And it's why does stuffed it's processed taste so fucking good.

326
00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.950
You know,
that's Twinkies.
So delicious.
You know,

327
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:44.340
there's a bunch of food chemist that put all their kids through school by

328
00:18:44.341 --> 00:18:48.180
figuring out there's this thing called palatability and if you can make

329
00:18:48.181 --> 00:18:51.690
something hyper palatable,
like it tastes so good,

330
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:55.590
then you actually override the mechanisms in the brain that normally tell you

331
00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:56.453
I'm full.

332
00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:00.540
Like if you sit down and eat some chicken and some fruit and like some yams

333
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.530
you'll eat until you're full and you're done and you're not going to get up and

334
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.270
you know,
dust another plate of that.

335
00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.510
But when you tinker with these foods and you make them really crunchy,

336
00:19:09.511 --> 00:19:12.060
he adds salt,
yet some high fructose corn syrup,

337
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.660
these things become hyper palatable and it turns off the part of the brain that

338
00:19:15.661 --> 00:19:18.260
tells you I'm full.
And it would be like,
you know,

339
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.690
you're filling up your gas at the gas station and if you turn off the mechanism

340
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:25.020
to know when the gas tank is full,
it's kind of the same analogy.

341
00:19:25.021 --> 00:19:28.110
Like you just keep pumping stuff in there and you have a disaster.
Berlin,

342
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.950
how does someone get to be like 700 pounds?

343
00:19:31.951 --> 00:19:34.050
And you see these people that have to get cut out of their houses.

344
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.970
Is that even possible without processed foods?
I don't think so.
I don't think so.

345
00:19:38.971 --> 00:19:42.750
And it's usually liquid exist before.
Right.
Just super rare.
You know,

346
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:47.190
hospitals are retooling everything.
Hospitals,
fire departments,

347
00:19:47.191 --> 00:19:50.820
police departments are being forced to retool everything that they have,

348
00:19:50.821 --> 00:19:53.520
their beds,
their,
their gurneys.
Even the,
you know,

349
00:19:53.521 --> 00:19:57.960
the openings under doorways because people are getting so big and it never

350
00:19:57.961 --> 00:19:58.830
happened in the past,
you know,

351
00:19:58.831 --> 00:20:03.000
1950s it never really happened like that and we ate a little more fat.

352
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.150
We didn't have as much processed food.
We didn't have high fructose corn syrup.

353
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.940
People tend to sleep a little more.
Like the sleep is big.

354
00:20:08.941 --> 00:20:12.970
Even on like the Food Guy,
I'm always talking about sleep cause it,

355
00:20:12.971 --> 00:20:15.300
it just messes you up.
And when you don't get enough,

356
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:17.130
when you look at those turn of the century people,

357
00:20:17.131 --> 00:20:20.730
they were all like little wired dudes.
Like they could just work all day.

358
00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:24.040
You got wire read hood were called and they did.
Yeah.
It's weird how,

359
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:25.830
how much people have changed.

360
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.850
Like the average size for a man was like 125 pounds.
You know,

361
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.750
like we don't realize how fucking big we've got.
Right.

362
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:37.730
And not in a good relative and not quickly.
You're not good big at all.
Yeah.

363
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:42.150
It's weird.
It's weird that it can happen so quickly.
There's a photograph from,

364
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:46.200
I believe it's like the turn of the century and there was a guy who was a side

365
00:20:46.201 --> 00:20:48.670
show and those guy played the fat man in the side shot.

366
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.310
If the image came out like kind of recently,

367
00:20:51.311 --> 00:20:55.030
cause it's ridiculous because the guy's not even that fat by today's standards.

368
00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:58.840
Like there's no way you would pay to see him.
But back then it was like Whoa,

369
00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:01.430
what freak.
Yeah,

370
00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:06.310
I guess you would have to eat insane amounts of like regular good healthy food

371
00:21:06.311 --> 00:21:10.480
to get that big and and you know it's that thing again where like you just,

372
00:21:10.481 --> 00:21:13.930
you get full from real food so it's really hard to overeat it.

373
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.860
But if you have something that turns off literally the mechanism in your brain

374
00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:20.440
that says,
I'm full,
like if that never kicks in,

375
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.720
then you can just keep going and going.
It's so creepy,

376
00:21:22.721 --> 00:21:26.610
but yet so delicious in the air and lands the problem.
So delicious.

377
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:30.280
You allow yourself cheat days.
Will you eat shitty foods?
You know,

378
00:21:30.281 --> 00:21:33.670
I do some Mexican food and I do like some corn tortillas and stuff like that.

379
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.780
I'm super allergic to wheat,
so it's just really,
that stuff's just a no go.
Like,

380
00:21:37.781 --> 00:21:41.950
it can't have no weight at all.
None.
Oh,
your whole life.
Uh,
you know,

381
00:21:41.951 --> 00:21:46.951
I was sick as a kid a lot and it was probably all like wheat and oats and stuff

382
00:21:47.261 --> 00:21:49.540
like that.
Holy Shit.
So I'll kick my heels up,

383
00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:52.870
but I tend to like to burn my carbs more from booze.

384
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:57.790
So versus I'm good moves for you actually.
You actually count your carbs,
just go,

385
00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:59.710
hmm.
I don't really count it,
but if I'm going to,

386
00:21:59.711 --> 00:22:01.540
if I'm going to shit the bed on something,

387
00:22:01.541 --> 00:22:05.950
I'd rather it be alcohol then like pastas or something.
Yeah,
right.
Yeah.
Yeah.

388
00:22:05.951 --> 00:22:10.630
Twinkies.
It's just a horrible feeling when it's over.
It's like,
what did I do?

389
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.320
It's just so different.
So much disappointment.
You know,

390
00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:15.730
like eat like a ring ding or something like that.
Right?

391
00:22:15.731 --> 00:22:19.350
Like as soon as you're cleaning your fingers,
I'm like,
what the fuck dude,
real.

392
00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.240
Then you want another one.
So yeah,

393
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.730
I usually don't usually have discussed it with myself after one.

394
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:28.440
<v 1>And it's really hard to get a good night's sleep if you shit your bed.
Also,</v>

395
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:31.840
I would imagine you need a lot of beds around.
Yeah,

396
00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.770
you need some options with Twinkies.
Is that what you're saying?

397
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:36.480
Twinkies make you shit yourself?
No,

398
00:22:36.481 --> 00:22:39.000
he said that if he's going to waste any of that stuff,

399
00:22:39.001 --> 00:22:40.740
he's got to shit the bed and hit.

400
00:22:40.741 --> 00:22:44.130
And then earlier you said that he needs a lot of sleep,
which I agree.
I,

401
00:22:44.131 --> 00:22:49.131
I spend a lot of money on mattresses and because I need a deep sleep and so I,

402
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.670
I,
I spent as much money as I can on just the bed.

403
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.250
Like I think that's Mo.
So,

404
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:59.490
but so many people spend like $30,000 on a car and they're in it for like 10

405
00:22:59.491 --> 00:23:01.080
minutes to go to work back and forth,

406
00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:05.460
but you're in your bed half of your life and like people buy like an $800

407
00:23:05.461 --> 00:23:08.160
mattress,
like with springs going up your ass and stuff like that.

408
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:13.520
She'd have sleep numbers sponsoring shouldn't really cost more than 800 bucks

409
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.220
should.
Yeah,
exactly.
It shows Tempur-Pedic's.

410
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.470
It seems like they just sliced those bitches out of a box.
They the,

411
00:23:20.471 --> 00:23:23.010
the tempurpedic is aren't that comfortable.
I just got,

412
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:26.790
I just got a new mattress because I couldn't take the cat pee smell in my bed

413
00:23:26.791 --> 00:23:27.840
anymore.
Details.

414
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:33.900
Pat's was with the pissing and so I now I have this whole lockdown system with

415
00:23:34.501 --> 00:23:37.310
cats in my house so they can't go into certain rooms anymore.

416
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:38.790
Now they're going to hate you even more.
Yeah.

417
00:23:38.791 --> 00:23:41.010
I know one of them slapped me the other night,

418
00:23:41.011 --> 00:23:44.520
but this came up to me for no reason.
It's like smack and then ran away.

419
00:23:44.521 --> 00:23:46.120
I was like,
what the wow.
That's

420
00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:49.030
<v 2>how your political ways spot where he was pissing mad too.</v>

421
00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:51.020
So he was trying to piss in that bed son.

422
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:54.610
<v 1>But these new beds have like tempurpedic and then the one I've got has like a</v>

423
00:23:54.611 --> 00:23:56.050
gel on top of it.

424
00:23:56.051 --> 00:23:59.560
So it's like just weird gel that you're in and so it's like a little baby water

425
00:23:59.561 --> 00:24:01.720
bed.
Wow.
You liked it?
Yeah,
it's pretty bad ass.

426
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.660
<v 2>Do you uh,
recommend waterbeds is it good to be in that womb?
Like environment?</v>

427
00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:11.160
You know,
I like to sleep number actually.
Would you like that thing?
Yeah,

428
00:24:11.161 --> 00:24:13.980
I liked that thing and I actually have mine like concrete,

429
00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.760
like [inaudible] fired.
It's like 95,
I think is kind of individual,

430
00:24:17.761 --> 00:24:18.750
but it is cool.

431
00:24:18.751 --> 00:24:22.320
You can dial the thing up or down and make it fit for what you need.
I had one,

432
00:24:22.321 --> 00:24:25.650
I didn't like it.
He didn't like it?
No,
no.
What do you roll with it?

433
00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:29.430
Be better if a tent like affirm tempurpedic.

434
00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:33.740
I just didn't like that one.
No.
Yeah,
yeah,
I've heard that you,

435
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:38.990
you can avoid like more kinks and neck things if you sleep in a harder mattress.

436
00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:44.580
Right.
The harder the better.
Is that the case against,
you know,

437
00:24:44.581 --> 00:24:48.170
it's kind of funny.
My,
my pal is a total sleep expert and he,

438
00:24:48.171 --> 00:24:51.540
he would have grilled him on this stuff and he's like,
you know,

439
00:24:51.541 --> 00:24:53.130
just kind of depends on how you're wired up.

440
00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:57.510
I think that again is trying to get in and do some personal experimentation and

441
00:24:57.511 --> 00:25:00.120
you should have a really good night's sleep.
You should wake up refreshed.

442
00:25:00.121 --> 00:25:03.350
If you wake up and you're feeling like dog shit,
then it was a bad,
bad,

443
00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.710
you need something else.
But our house,
we have like four spare bedrooms.

444
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:12.330
Each spare bedroom has like a $3,000 mattress in it from us trying these other

445
00:25:12.331 --> 00:25:15.750
beds and it's like,
ah,
that didn't work.
That didn't work.
And it's always,

446
00:25:15.751 --> 00:25:19.380
the trial period is like try it for 60 days but you don't start feeling like

447
00:25:19.381 --> 00:25:21.830
shit until like 61 days.
So yeah.

448
00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:26.050
<v 1>And if your bed has that like sink hole black hole thing that's in the middle</v>

449
00:25:26.051 --> 00:25:28.630
because it's so old.
Got To get rid of that.
Yeah,

450
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.910
because I found mine on my last bed,

451
00:25:30.911 --> 00:25:33.530
it had a mild version of that so it was always constantly like,

452
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.580
like having to adjust my body a little just to get like,

453
00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.940
like a more comfortable sleep.
So I slept on my stomach.

454
00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:44.620
I always had neck pains from on one side of my body from just adjusting.

455
00:25:44.621 --> 00:25:47.570
And Alex p tends to Cathy Guide you.
Ew.

456
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.550
<v 2>That's a fucked up thing when you go to sleep and you hurt yourself while you're</v>

457
00:25:50.551 --> 00:25:53.460
sleeping.
Yeah.
You know,
he just feels so stupid.

458
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.890
You wake up with a cake leg like come on.
Really?

459
00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.410
I get Charlie horses all the time from dehydration.
From what about comics?

460
00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:02.460
It wouldn't that be the way to go.
Hey Mike,
Mike be cool.

461
00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:05.190
You could check out a hammock and they might be sweet.
I'm,

462
00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.490
it seems like the way to go like a nice leather heel,

463
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.250
making your bed now sleep in a hammock man.

464
00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:14.010
It seems like would support you like really kinda evenly.

465
00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:17.860
You get pockets on the side of this one.
In high school.
Yeah.
I just asleep.

466
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:22.320
They held it up to the wall.
Yeah.
Yeah.
How much sleep does a human being need?

467
00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:27.070
Eight to 10.
Eight to 10 pitch black room.
Yeah.
Period.

468
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:31.200
Yeah.
And that's like a no,
you can't debate that.
Right.
You know,

469
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:35.460
it's funny you people will say,
I only need like five or six hours of sleep.

470
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.730
And then inevitably if they put up some blackout curtains,

471
00:26:38.731 --> 00:26:42.270
if they turn off all the lights and they actually like getting an environment

472
00:26:42.271 --> 00:26:46.320
that's good for,
then they're like,
you know Ninja Blow Dart,

473
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.870
they're out for like 14 hours the first time you do it.

474
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.240
And then they start getting caught up on their sleep.

475
00:26:51.241 --> 00:26:54.810
And these people that usually think they can get by on like five or six they

476
00:26:54.811 --> 00:26:56.010
discovered,
they're like,
okay,
yeah,

477
00:26:56.011 --> 00:27:00.000
I feel way better on eight to 10 and I mean it's a lot of time.

478
00:27:00.001 --> 00:27:02.080
There was a lot of other shit you could be doing.
Right.

479
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.370
But you just don't do it as well when you don't sleep.
Yeah,
I agree.

480
00:27:05.371 --> 00:27:09.430
I am a big fan of sleep and the fight don't,
I've,
I've really felt,

481
00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:13.140
especially as I got older,
when I was younger,
I could pull it off more.
Right.

482
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.250
But now as I get older,

483
00:27:14.251 --> 00:27:17.310
like if I don't have like a real legit solid eight hours sleep,

484
00:27:17.311 --> 00:27:22.080
I just don't feel like all cylinders firing.
Yeah.
It's hard.

485
00:27:22.081 --> 00:27:26.170
Even with a cup of coffee or whatever or an exercise,
you know,
you know,

486
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.720
it's still never really quite feels right.
It feels like he's just,

487
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.120
it's a weird thing that we just shut off,
you know?
Well,

488
00:27:33.121 --> 00:27:35.700
and that's why travel sucks too,
because your circadian,

489
00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:39.480
that inner clock gets thrown off when you go east particularly.

490
00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:44.490
So like he'd go to the east coast
going East is worse than going west.

491
00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:44.790
You know?

492
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:48.360
That's what they always said about Japanese fighters at the problem they had in

493
00:27:48.361 --> 00:27:50.760
America.
Like Phil Baroni actually told me this,

494
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:54.750
he said the problem they have in America is that when they would come here,

495
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:58.920
like coming to America completely fucks her system.
Right.
How is that possible?

496
00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.130
You're,
you're just,
you,
you're completely flipped around.

497
00:28:02.131 --> 00:28:06.600
It's like you're fighting then when you would normally be asleep and it takes

498
00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:10.920
weeks for all that to kind of get shifted around.
And once you,
you,
you know,

499
00:28:10.921 --> 00:28:14.970
you do that travel.
So you go from Japan to here,
you go from here to Europe,

500
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.910
your testosterone levels drop,
your inflammation goes up,

501
00:28:17.911 --> 00:28:21.300
your immune system goes down and it's gonna stay that way for a while because

502
00:28:21.301 --> 00:28:25.280
it's a stress.
It's like,
it's the same way that working out or,

503
00:28:25.281 --> 00:28:27.300
or working too much as a stress on your system,

504
00:28:27.301 --> 00:28:29.760
it's going to drop all of your recovery capacity for one.

505
00:28:29.761 --> 00:28:32.900
This is just because the interruption in sleep or,
yeah,
it's a,

506
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:37.560
it's that internal clock that Kinda gets tied into the sunlight and all that

507
00:28:37.561 --> 00:28:40.440
stuff.
Yeah.
But it just drives everything.

508
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:44.190
All your hormones and road transmitters,
the way your gut functions,

509
00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.920
everything is tied into these internal clocks.

510
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:51.180
So if a fighter wanted to acclimate,
but when he came to a somewhere,

511
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:52.023
who's going to fight?

512
00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:54.970
Should he go there at the beginning of his training camp and never leave void?

513
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:58.500
Yeah,
absolutely.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Yeah.

514
00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:01.770
And I wouldn't have it in your control.

515
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:05.670
I wouldn't travel more than three hours.
If you add control,

516
00:29:05.671 --> 00:29:07.470
like if you have a well established fighter,

517
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:12.600
if they need to travel more than three hours and you know what a three time zone

518
00:29:12.601 --> 00:29:16.830
changes,
then I would really recommend,
you know,

519
00:29:16.831 --> 00:29:20.310
the camp at least a couple of weeks beforehand gets moved.

520
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:24.570
But possibly from the beginning so that you've got the continuity.
Yeah.
Yeah.

521
00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.420
That's uh,
an element that,
you know,

522
00:29:27.421 --> 00:29:31.020
the rest element is one that really doesn't get quite enough credit.

523
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.360
It doesn't get quite enough importance.

524
00:29:33.361 --> 00:29:35.760
Everyone's always looking for something that you can eat,

525
00:29:35.761 --> 00:29:36.990
that can give you energy,

526
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:40.020
something that you can eat that will clean you out and get you straight.

527
00:29:40.021 --> 00:29:44.470
But really one of the most important things is just shutting the fuck down and

528
00:29:44.471 --> 00:29:46.930
just sleep in.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you sleep well,

529
00:29:46.931 --> 00:29:48.850
it's hard to kill you if you're not sleeping well.

530
00:29:48.851 --> 00:29:52.180
It's almost impossible to keep you alive.
Like it,
it,
it's huge.

531
00:29:52.181 --> 00:29:55.660
And you sound like a nutcase recommending this,
but you know,

532
00:29:55.661 --> 00:29:59.620
it's Kinda like my greasy used car salesman pitch is like,
dude,
sleep more,

533
00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:00.190
you know,

534
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:03.160
whether it's clients trying to lean out or like somebody trying to get better

535
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:07.570
performance for fighting or like we had a girl that missed a Olympic trials for

536
00:30:07.571 --> 00:30:11.350
the 2000 meter row by uh,
a hundredth of a second.
You know,

537
00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:16.240
and you were when you were at that level where she didn't go to the Olympics by,

538
00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.170
uh,
one,
100th of a second Polish.
You need all your,
you know,

539
00:30:20.171 --> 00:30:23.740
your i's dotted and t's crossed.
And so like,
she sleeps well,
she eats Paleo,

540
00:30:23.741 --> 00:30:27.580
she does all this stuff,
but she's still got edged out,
you know.
Wow.
Yeah.

541
00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:32.770
Wow.
But if you want to do when you're thinking,
but just to stop,

542
00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:37.120
think about your life being about performing to one,

543
00:30:37.121 --> 00:30:38.890
100th of a second,
right,

544
00:30:38.891 --> 00:30:43.891
better then everything you do has to be like dead on you.

545
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.230
You'd be a paranoid freak.
You could be crazy.

546
00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:50.260
She's been kind of crazy at times.
Yeah.

547
00:30:50.261 --> 00:30:54.110
Like my monitoring that I honestly don't like.
Um,

548
00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:59.170
monitoring super high level athletes because it is so fucking stressful.

549
00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:03.580
If I shit the bed on something or there's the whole part of me doing something

550
00:31:03.581 --> 00:31:06.610
wrong and then feeling guilty for it and then wanting to kill me.

551
00:31:06.611 --> 00:31:10.000
And then there's the other side where you're investing hugely in this person and

552
00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:12.940
if they don't comply with what I want them to do,
I want to kill him,
you know?

553
00:31:12.941 --> 00:31:16.410
Because I know how important this stuff is.
And if they're like,
oh,

554
00:31:16.411 --> 00:31:19.810
I'm going to go out and drink anyway.
Or you know,
on some other project,

555
00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:21.780
that is a thing that drives,

556
00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:26.530
there's a guy named Mike Dolce who works with a lot of fighters and he,
you know,

557
00:31:26.531 --> 00:31:28.900
he,
you think guys don't listen to him.
He's like,
well,

558
00:31:28.901 --> 00:31:31.450
I don't even know why they fucking brought me here.
Right.
You know,

559
00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:34.930
it's just been pointless.
Like some people don't want to hear it,
right.

560
00:31:34.931 --> 00:31:37.750
They still want to do what they want to do,
especially fighters.

561
00:31:37.751 --> 00:31:40.900
Fighters have this mindset of,
if you like getting hit,

562
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:43.990
I mean there's a whole other wiring that goes,
you know what I mean?

563
00:31:43.991 --> 00:31:44.621
They're not even that.

564
00:31:44.621 --> 00:31:48.490
It's like they have a crazy sort of a confidence that nothing will ever go
wrong.

565
00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.820
Right,
right.
Lots of some degree.
You need that,
you know,

566
00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:55.540
and I think the people that are able to take that confidence,

567
00:31:55.541 --> 00:31:59.650
but then also understand what a good coach can bring to the table and to some

568
00:31:59.651 --> 00:32:03.520
degree,
step back and give up some of that responsibility.
It's like,
okay,

569
00:32:03.521 --> 00:32:06.140
you're my coach.
I'm going to,
I'm going to listen to you.
Yeah.

570
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:12.100
I feel like fighters who herself coached only reaches a certain level.
I think,

571
00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:15.670
you know,
you've had some problems.
If you're self coached,

572
00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:18.880
it's really hard to objectively stand back and look at your game when it's not

573
00:32:18.881 --> 00:32:21.970
going right.
You know,
a real true professional,

574
00:32:21.971 --> 00:32:25.930
a guy who's worked guys through many levels of,
of uh,

575
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:28.930
advancement and growth.
He could see like issues.

576
00:32:28.931 --> 00:32:33.280
He can find things that you're doing wrong.
And it just,
the,
I think for,
uh,

577
00:32:33.281 --> 00:32:38.020
an athlete,
I think it's important to relent to a mentor as well.
I think you,

578
00:32:38.021 --> 00:32:40.010
you have to have someone else who will,
you

579
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.650
<v 0>also have faith in what they have to say as well,</v>

580
00:32:42.651 --> 00:32:46.160
so you're not in it by yourself.
It takes away some of the psychological burden,

581
00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:50.300
especially for combat sports.
I think it's very important for,
for guys,

582
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.830
some guys don't like to do it though.

583
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:53.600
Why did they want to do everything themselves?

584
00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.650
<v 3>Yeah,
but you know the Jack of all trades,
you don't go anywhere.</v>

585
00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:00.000
Like if you're supposed to fight,
then you fight and you eat sleeping,

586
00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:03.400
you know shit that and then somebody else monitors your food.

587
00:33:03.401 --> 00:33:05.430
Somebody keeps an eye on your sleep.
You know you,

588
00:33:05.431 --> 00:33:09.250
you've got somebody ideally taking care of the financial side of your life and

589
00:33:09.251 --> 00:33:12.370
everything so that you can just focus on that one thing and you've got to put

590
00:33:12.371 --> 00:33:14.140
all of those pieces in play.

591
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.890
<v 0>Yeah.
Especially when you,</v>

592
00:33:15.891 --> 00:33:18.870
you're thinking about fighting where the consequences are so much greater than

593
00:33:18.871 --> 00:33:23.210
the one 100th of a second and rowing.
Right,
right.
The one,
100% you lose that.

594
00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.380
You're like,
Oh shit,
what could I have done differently?

595
00:33:25.381 --> 00:33:29.520
I should have used fluoride less tooth place,
they start thinking crazy shit.

596
00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:34.350
But when someone that one 100th of a second and someone connecting or you know,

597
00:33:34.351 --> 00:33:36.450
spotting your,
your,
your punch,

598
00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.750
getting out of the way just in time encountering you and you get knocked out,

599
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:44.700
then it becomes even more crazy,
more obsessive.
Have you worked with finders?

600
00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:47.420
<v 3>You Know Glenn Cordoza right?
Sure.
Glen.</v>

601
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:52.430
So we worked with Glenn and then just more kind of Internet coaching,

602
00:33:52.531 --> 00:33:56.480
you know,
trying to folks who've come to me when,
uh,

603
00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:57.630
people weren't recovering,

604
00:33:57.631 --> 00:34:01.020
they were starting to get a ton of soft tissue injuries.
Um,

605
00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.240
bad sleep started popping up,
you know,

606
00:34:03.241 --> 00:34:06.150
like they started getting some depression during training camp and everything.

607
00:34:06.151 --> 00:34:07.860
And so looking at the Diet,

608
00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:12.090
looking at lifestyle factors and I mean it all boils down to the same thing

609
00:34:12.091 --> 00:34:13.170
though.
Like a clean diet.

610
00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:16.530
I obviously I'm going to gear towards more towards like Paleo Gig,

611
00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:20.880
protecting the sleep area like it at gunpoint.

612
00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.760
Like the people sleep eight to 10 hours,
you know,

613
00:34:23.761 --> 00:34:28.440
by if you have to kill somebody and then just kind of a mellow lifestyle outside

614
00:34:28.441 --> 00:34:31.800
the rest of that to the best of your ability to,
to construct that.
But that will,

615
00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:35.040
I mean it's 50% of your recovery probably is,

616
00:34:35.041 --> 00:34:39.450
is having that sleep so you can go in and train really hard and then go home and

617
00:34:39.451 --> 00:34:42.660
not sleep and you don't get really any of the benefit from the training session.

618
00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.700
Even if you're working skill,
say you're,
you know,

619
00:34:44.701 --> 00:34:46.890
you're working a bunch of head movement and stuff like that.

620
00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:50.730
That is all a skill that needs to go from one part of your brain to another.

621
00:34:50.731 --> 00:34:54.000
It goes from short term memory to long term memory and starts getting,
you know,

622
00:34:54.001 --> 00:34:58.710
woven into like your brainstem.
It's a,
it's a learned pattern.
If you don't sleep,

623
00:34:58.711 --> 00:35:02.970
you don't access that,
that transition.
So it's like that training session,

624
00:35:02.971 --> 00:35:06.480
then it's just gone.
It's as if you didn't even do,
it's crazy.
So it's like,

625
00:35:06.481 --> 00:35:07.770
if you're going to spend the time to do it,

626
00:35:07.771 --> 00:35:11.120
there's a great book and it another good dude you should have on that wrote the,

627
00:35:11.121 --> 00:35:11.250
uh,

628
00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:16.250
the talent code and talking about like needing really good repetitions and like

629
00:35:16.471 --> 00:35:20.510
10,000 repetitions and something like playing violin or learning,
you know,
uh,
uh,

630
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.590
uh,
quickdraw shooting and stuff like that.

631
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:26.310
You want to do it perfect and then you need a good environment for that stuff to

632
00:35:26.311 --> 00:35:29.340
kind of cook in the brain and actually become a part of your person,

633
00:35:29.341 --> 00:35:30.390
part of the motor memory.

634
00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.350
So it's a huge part of the game that people are just kind of,
again,

635
00:35:34.351 --> 00:35:38.010
shitting the bed on and,
and not get,
you know,
you see

636
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.320
<v 2>so many people work so hard,</v>

637
00:35:40.321 --> 00:35:43.260
but they almost work too hard and then they don't give enough credence to the

638
00:35:43.261 --> 00:35:45.510
rest because it's like,
God,
that's being lazy.

639
00:35:45.511 --> 00:35:48.390
I knew his work ethic and he could go all damn game on.
Yeah.

640
00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:50.460
Just to push to your break,

641
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:55.560
there's a lot of wrestlers I think that is the most overtrained and

642
00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:58.860
undernourished sport when it comes to amateurs.
Tough.

643
00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.970
They're used to being tough.

644
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.700
It's why they're so dangerous when they become an a may fighters is because

645
00:36:02.701 --> 00:36:06.330
their,
their level of mental toughness is I believe above and above,

646
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:09.450
beyond any other sport.
I think at the highest levels of wrestling,

647
00:36:09.451 --> 00:36:12.750
I think that the most mentally tough guys in the world,
they're fucking animals.

648
00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:17.610
Those guys,
they don't eat for days and then they go and wrestle savages.

649
00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.950
You know,
it just the weight cutting alone,

650
00:36:19.951 --> 00:36:24.150
the fact that they have to be miserable and malnourished and dehydrated and

651
00:36:24.151 --> 00:36:28.740
training,
it's really hard.
But,
but that's not the way to do it.
Right.

652
00:36:28.741 --> 00:36:31.920
If you want like optimum performance and it's great that it makes him so tough.

653
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.440
But I mean,
if you really want to take care of the body,

654
00:36:34.441 --> 00:36:37.590
that is so not the way to do it.
Yeah.
I mean,
staying within,

655
00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:42.600
staying in close to contest shape,
year round,
kicking your heels up a little bit.

656
00:36:42.601 --> 00:36:43.890
But you know,
the,
the thing is,

657
00:36:43.891 --> 00:36:48.360
is that when people go so extreme then when their off season to gain 30 pounds

658
00:36:48.361 --> 00:36:51.080
of weight and it's all hookers and cocaine is,
you know,
it's,

659
00:36:51.081 --> 00:36:55.530
it's like bad bad scene there.
But what about the overtraining?
I mean there is a,

660
00:36:55.590 --> 00:37:00.240
there's a certain,
there's a certain point of no return,
right?
Where you're,

661
00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:04.530
you're actually doing damage to your conditioning.
Right.
And you know,

662
00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:09.120
really common too.
It's super common.
Uh,
the people who manage it well,

663
00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:11.570
those are the folks that succeed I think more.

664
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:15.030
And the people who manage it well or certainly the ones who protect their

665
00:37:15.031 --> 00:37:18.380
conditioning year round,
they don't ever let themselves get out of condition.

666
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:22.020
And it's a very difficult and discipline thing to maintain,

667
00:37:22.021 --> 00:37:24.330
like to maintain like a real high level of conditioning.

668
00:37:24.331 --> 00:37:28.230
But if you don't have a high level,
you can't push to a higher level.
Right,
right.

669
00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.690
And for a lot of people,
it's like when you have a,

670
00:37:30.691 --> 00:37:34.950
you attain a certain level and then you drop off drastically and then it's all

671
00:37:34.951 --> 00:37:37.230
about getting your,
your body back in shape.

672
00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:41.790
Like guys who get really big in between fights,
like you know,

673
00:37:41.791 --> 00:37:46.380
that those guys like that's not the same level of commitment as say an Anderson

674
00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.760
Silva or George Saint Pierre.
The,

675
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:49.620
you're never going to see those guys fat whenever.

676
00:37:49.621 --> 00:37:51.960
Never going to go see those guys in,
in between fights,

677
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:55.110
just drinking and fucking around.
There's none of that going on,
right?

678
00:37:55.111 --> 00:37:56.580
They're protecting their vehicle.

679
00:37:56.581 --> 00:38:00.150
And so even though there's still obviously moving a lot of scale weight to make

680
00:38:00.151 --> 00:38:04.770
weigh ins,
it's not as dramatic a shift.
And just like when we travel,

681
00:38:04.771 --> 00:38:07.330
whenever you change these internal,
uh,

682
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:11.460
kind of kind of signaling the biological signaling and you wait,
when you fly,

683
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:16.050
you know,
from a six time zones or eight times zones that messes with your sleep.

684
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:20.130
If you are taking your body and forcing it to shed a bunch of weight very,

685
00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:22.590
very rapidly because you got out of shape,

686
00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:26.610
then it's more of a stress and it drops testosterone and it impacts your immune

687
00:38:26.611 --> 00:38:29.070
system.
So staying as close as you can,
you know,

688
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:33.270
obviously like you want to be as big and strong and muscular as you can at any

689
00:38:33.271 --> 00:38:36.170
given body weight and if,
but

690
00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:37.240
<v 0>within striking distance,</v>

691
00:38:37.241 --> 00:38:39.520
being able to go down and make weight when you need to make it.

692
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:44.260
When you see guys,
uh,
I don't know how aware you are of a,

693
00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:46.570
there's some crazy wait cutters out there.

694
00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.660
The most recent one that I heard of is Travis view,
right?

695
00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:53.320
Fought in Bellator at 245 pounds in the cage.

696
00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:58.360
Two Oh five is what he weighed in at.
Right.
That's fucking crazy.
I mean,

697
00:38:58.361 --> 00:39:01.750
that is fucking crazy.
Yeah.

698
00:39:01.751 --> 00:39:04.840
And I mean there's some science to it.
You need somebody there with your,

699
00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:09.270
you know,
your ivs and,
and all the rest of it.
But Holy Shit,
what a nutty idea.

700
00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:14.250
The fact that you're almost dead 24 hours before you have a cage fight.
You know,

701
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:18.600
I would,
I think it'd be cool to just see almost like chits where you,

702
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:22.810
you show up and you step on the scale and you weigh what you weigh and then it,

703
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.290
it just goes,
yeah,
I would like to see that too.

704
00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:30.700
But you can't do that if you have contracts,
you know,
because dude's,

705
00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:33.820
if they don't have any consequences for not being at a certain weight,

706
00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:35.680
dudes are just going to get huge.
Right.

707
00:39:35.681 --> 00:39:38.310
I mean there's a benefit to just putting on muscle mass,
you know,

708
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:43.000
the 147 weight class,
you show up at 160 pounds.
Swole as fuck.

709
00:39:43.001 --> 00:39:44.260
Like what the hell is going on.

710
00:39:44.261 --> 00:39:47.710
But I mean they would sit then those guys would have to fight like one 55.

711
00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:51.460
You couldn't,
you know,
couldn't do that in the world of championship finding.

712
00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:54.730
Cause you know,
you obviously have to schedule it long in advance.

713
00:39:54.731 --> 00:39:57.820
You have to put it on paper view.
Uh,
so the,
you got to have weight classes,

714
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:01.210
but there's no way to stop people from cutting weight if that's going to be the

715
00:40:01.211 --> 00:40:02.031
case.
The,

716
00:40:02.031 --> 00:40:05.290
the good thing that they've done is at least give them 24 hours to rehydrate.

717
00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.200
Right.
Which they didn't used to do the old days of boxing.

718
00:40:08.201 --> 00:40:11.170
He used to weigh in on the day of the fight and guys would dehydrate,

719
00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:12.580
make weight and then,
you know,

720
00:40:12.581 --> 00:40:17.581
drink milk and eat cheese and meat or something stupid and be all fucked up.

721
00:40:18.161 --> 00:40:21.190
By the time I got into the and still dehydrated.
Yeah,
completely.

722
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:24.670
Does the Ivy Dehydrate,
uh,
when,
when they rehydrate with Ivs,

723
00:40:24.671 --> 00:40:28.690
does it replenish the brain as well?
What replenishes everything?
But I mean,

724
00:40:28.691 --> 00:40:32.380
the is in a pretty rough state by that point.
So I mean,

725
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.980
it's a 24 hours,
you can bounce back pretty good.
And particularly,
you know,

726
00:40:35.981 --> 00:40:37.150
like you said with wrestlers,

727
00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.610
they've been used to pulling their body up and down like that.

728
00:40:39.611 --> 00:40:43.730
So they're a little bit more,
uh,
climatized to it,
but it's rough.
How,

729
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:47.740
how much of a percentage do you think it takes away from them?
I mean,
is it,

730
00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:51.340
it's gotta be a damn.
I mean,
if you're not supposed to get drunk.
Okay.

731
00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:54.790
And while you're in training camp and you eat clean and everything like that and

732
00:40:54.791 --> 00:40:57.520
then you do something way worse than getting drunk,

733
00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:01.480
you get crazy dehydrated.
You mean you've starved?

734
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:06.190
I've seen guys shuffling to the scale because they can't pick their feet up.

735
00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:07.690
Right.
I've seen that.

736
00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.140
And then we're going to find a world championship the next day.
Yeah.

737
00:41:11.141 --> 00:41:13.980
I don't know when that,
that's where,
you know,
we're,
we're the,

738
00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:18.280
are they its lien as they could be,
you know,
just day in and day out and uh,

739
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:24.150
I don't know because it takes something off and then you just have to wonder,

740
00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:28.750
is it taking an equal amount out of both parties?
Because that's crazy.
I mean,

741
00:41:28.751 --> 00:41:33.530
there's gotta be a way to find people that are really the same size and just

742
00:41:33.531 --> 00:41:37.220
make some sort of an honorable agreement to never get over a certain weight and

743
00:41:37.221 --> 00:41:40.850
just do it at the weight you actually are at.
Right.
Yeah.
And you know,

744
00:41:40.851 --> 00:41:45.020
in some ways I think it would be more exciting fighting because a lot of the

745
00:41:45.021 --> 00:41:46.880
fatigue that I see Seddon and folks,

746
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:50.930
it's probably the weight cut you saw like Chris Weidman and Damien Maia.

747
00:41:50.931 --> 00:41:53.300
I don't know if you saw that,
but it was on Fox.
Both guys were,

748
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:56.690
well Damien Maia really just couldn't do anything with Weidman and Weidman was

749
00:41:56.691 --> 00:41:59.900
way too tired from the weight cut cause he had took the fight on really short

750
00:41:59.901 --> 00:42:03.300
notice.
So the guy had a cut like some insane amount of weight the day before.

751
00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:04.520
And that's what they kept saying to him.

752
00:42:04.521 --> 00:42:07.970
I saw what you did yesterday when you made weight,
you know,
you can do anything,

753
00:42:07.971 --> 00:42:09.250
you can do anything like,
so it was like,
God,

754
00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:12.080
the wakeup must've been definitely Mike.
Yeah.

755
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:16.760
And then here he is fighting on Fox,
you know,
the next day,
24 hours later.

756
00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:20.660
So we're really a weird practice.
I wish we could avoid it,

757
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:25.130
but I don't know how,
because there's,
when you,
you have to have a way classes,

758
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:26.030
right?
You have to,

759
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:30.290
there's no way a guy like Joe Benevidez should be fighting Brock Lesnar,
right?

760
00:42:30.291 --> 00:42:33.000
So we got our weight classes.
This isn't 1993.
Right?

761
00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:38.030
So if you're going to have weight classes,
it's like what?
How do you set them up?

762
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:42.440
You know what if you would just set them up every ideally every 10 pounds,

763
00:42:42.441 --> 00:42:46.640
every five pounds,
how do you set them up to keep people from cutting the Wayne?

764
00:42:46.641 --> 00:42:49.340
I don't think you can write,
well,
I mean,
again,

765
00:42:49.341 --> 00:42:52.340
you would do it more like a Jujitsu tournament where you weighed the weight,

766
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:54.530
but how could you do that with a championship fight?

767
00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:58.610
Because if the guy didn't make the weight and everybody flew in from Australia

768
00:42:58.611 --> 00:42:59.660
to see the fight,
you know what I mean?

769
00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:03.670
It's like probably like curbside execution then.
I don't know.

770
00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:07.640
Why would you get killed if you don't make weight?
I don't know.
I don't know.

771
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:11.750
And even then,
they would try to be as big as possible.
Right.
People,
I mean,

772
00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:14.390
people,
there's an advantage to being big,
you know,
look at,
uh,

773
00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:18.320
what it's done to Alistair Overeem.
Right?
You know,
there's Alistair Overeem one,

774
00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.630
you know,
where it was a really good fighter,
very skilled,

775
00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:25.720
and there's over him to where he's just fucking behemoth that smashing people.

776
00:43:26.151 --> 00:43:30.170
And when the k one Grand Prix and the only difference between those is a lot of

777
00:43:30.171 --> 00:43:33.870
fucking muscle,
a lot of experience and a lot of muscle,
you know,
it's,

778
00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:38.030
it's amazing how much it does for a really technical guy when they get strong.

779
00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:42.290
Right.
You know,
that's,
that shit's so how are you going to have a weight class?

780
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:43.940
I don't know.
I don't know.

781
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.430
I think to have a way in the same day due to get it up.
Sorry,

782
00:43:46.431 --> 00:43:49.250
I'm 20 pounds overweight.
Not much I can do about it now.
I mean,

783
00:43:49.251 --> 00:43:52.070
we wouldn't want me to dehydrate and risk dying.

784
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:57.110
And what the fuck do you get them to do?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Other than again,

785
00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:00.680
the,
a curbside execution,
you know,
part of your contract,
you're like,

786
00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:04.070
you're going to make weight or be some sort of Samurai type thing.

787
00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:08.990
Told to be an honorable who out there.
No,
I'm not even that.
I'm saying like the,

788
00:44:08.991 --> 00:44:12.140
the uh,
the contract to fight it should be like they should know.

789
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:14.930
No one should ever miss.
Wait.
It should always be like really,

790
00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:18.770
really clean and easy and everyone's just,
this is what you weigh.

791
00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:21.170
And then he'd go and fight.
That would be the ideal thing to do.

792
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.460
The danger is apparently,
um,
with dehydration,
um,

793
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:26.810
that's when,
uh,

794
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:31.480
most of the boxing brain damage fights where guys have died.
Yeah.

795
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.310
<v 2>Gerald Mcclellan who was a famous wait cutter.
He's a really big guy.</v>

796
00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:39.150
A lot of those guys in the heavyweight division and really never had the same

797
00:44:39.151 --> 00:44:42.840
problems that guys in the lighter weight divisions too.
Right.
That's a,

798
00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:46.380
it's a very unfortunate aspect of,
of fighting men.
Yeah.

799
00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:50.700
I mean you're already taking something that's pretty scary and dangerous and

800
00:44:50.701 --> 00:44:52.550
then making it way more.
Yeah.

801
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:55.680
What did the physical effects of dehydration on the brain,

802
00:44:55.681 --> 00:44:57.540
because that's where it gets really weird,
right?

803
00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:02.160
You could have electrolyte imbalances where things are just literally not firing

804
00:45:02.161 --> 00:45:03.810
and your heart may not fire properly.

805
00:45:03.811 --> 00:45:08.811
But I think a lot of it is just that that fluid around the brain is the shock

806
00:45:08.911 --> 00:45:12.750
absorber,
right?
So if you pull some of that away,
then the brain is literally,

807
00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:16.500
you've almost got like,
it's kind of like a walnut that fills the whole shell.

808
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:18.000
You shake it and nothing happens.

809
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.670
Whereas if you've got more room in there and then you get hit,

810
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:24.840
then you're driving the skull into the brain at a very high velocity,

811
00:45:24.841 --> 00:45:29.550
which sounds bad.
I don't literally have less fluid up there.
Yeah.

812
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:33.750
Yeah.
And then what about with the Ivs?
Does that replace it?
It does,

813
00:45:33.751 --> 00:45:38.751
but I mean you 24 hours is a pretty good period and I'm not super up on this,

814
00:45:40.231 --> 00:45:43.200
but you can take somebody who's extremely dehydrated 24 hours later.

815
00:45:43.201 --> 00:45:45.830
They're pretty good,
but they're still after effects.
You know,

816
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:49.920
I think you could probably find things in blood work that a week later.
You know,

817
00:45:49.921 --> 00:45:53.310
like if you just shrink wrap a guy down,
like you do the usual,

818
00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:56.160
you know like 20 pound weight cut that you see in a lot of these,

819
00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:59.000
these fighters for like a 200 pound guy or something more,

820
00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:00.570
10% or more body weight.

821
00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:03.570
I bet we could see things in their blood work a week later.

822
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:06.800
Like they don't fight,
they just wait,
cut.
And then we see what,

823
00:46:06.801 --> 00:46:07.980
what changes in their blood work.

824
00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.800
I bet we could see bad stuff in their blood work a week later.

825
00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:15.870
Like it leaves an impact on how do you stop people from doing it then?

826
00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:20.930
I mean education led fighters think about their career holistically because the

827
00:46:21.061 --> 00:46:25.110
reality is competitively there is an advantage to away.
Totally.

828
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:27.960
And I think you get as big as you can,

829
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:31.800
as lean as you can and then kind of see where that,

830
00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:35.530
but then you know,
doing some field testing where you practice it,

831
00:46:35.531 --> 00:46:40.170
say like you've got some sort of a,
a a,
a metabolic workout,
you know,

832
00:46:40.171 --> 00:46:43.290
like whether it's pads and bags or whether it's crossfit looking thing or

833
00:46:43.291 --> 00:46:45.960
something.
But you've got a standard and so you wait,

834
00:46:45.961 --> 00:46:50.950
cut at a certain starting weight,
go down,
rehydrate,
do your whole,
you know,

835
00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.070
your whole rehydration process,

836
00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:57.540
see how you do on this kind of standardized workout and then maybe you gain a

837
00:46:57.541 --> 00:46:58.570
little bit more weight,

838
00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:02.990
a little bit more muscle if is it that much more difficult to go down and does

839
00:47:02.991 --> 00:47:04.920
it actually then tank your performance?

840
00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.110
So I think you've got to get in and do some field testing,

841
00:47:07.111 --> 00:47:08.760
but it's hard to do that.
You know,

842
00:47:08.761 --> 00:47:13.280
you're already trying to get ready for fight camps and do nothing else.
So yeah,

843
00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:15.610
I think that's one of the things that you brought up earlier.

844
00:47:15.611 --> 00:47:19.560
It's such a good point that too many fighters concentrate on conditioning

845
00:47:19.561 --> 00:47:22.830
instead of concentrating on skill work at skill work.

846
00:47:22.831 --> 00:47:26.660
For someone who's doing something as crazy as a combat sport,

847
00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:30.130
it is the most important thing is to,
if you look at the best

848
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:33.010
<v 0>guys,
they're not necessarily like Anderson Silva,
in my opinion,</v>

849
00:47:33.011 --> 00:47:35.170
is the greatest fighter that's ever lived.

850
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.710
And he's not the strongest guy in the world.
And he's obviously a strong guy,

851
00:47:38.711 --> 00:47:40.570
but he's insanely technical,

852
00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:43.950
so technical and so is it.

853
00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:48.020
Everything moves fluidly.
Like he ain't never had stamina problem.
Right.

854
00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:52.000
He fights deep into the fifth round and is always fun because he's a super

855
00:47:52.001 --> 00:47:53.500
efficient,
super efficient.

856
00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:58.330
And George St Pierre is another one and it's a fascinating thing that George

857
00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:01.930
Saint Pierre does not do any strength and conditioning during his fight camps.

858
00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:04.000
Right?
He says he doesn't,
doesn't believe in it.

859
00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.460
He says he might lift the little weights,
he goes up.

860
00:48:06.461 --> 00:48:10.080
But to do that to forward my look to you know,
look good,
but he's,

861
00:48:10.081 --> 00:48:14.770
he's being serious.
Like everything he does is his wrestling,
kickboxing,
Jujitsu.

862
00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:18.790
And when you look at the demands of that,
how much more can you do?
You know,

863
00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:21.760
if you're smart and like just a little bit of,
you know,

864
00:48:21.761 --> 00:48:24.400
strength or power training,
a little bit of mobility work.

865
00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:29.170
But let's say you want to do some cardio,
you know,
are you as a fighter,

866
00:48:29.171 --> 00:48:30.790
are you better off getting out and running?

867
00:48:30.791 --> 00:48:33.280
Are you better off having somebody hold pads for you?

868
00:48:33.281 --> 00:48:37.780
And you go at like 50% and you just,
you get your heart rate up a little bit,

869
00:48:37.781 --> 00:48:41.590
you know,
it's like,
you know,
70,
75% of your vo two Max or whatever,

870
00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:42.970
but you do a little bit of that.

871
00:48:42.971 --> 00:48:45.590
You do a little bit of position positional sparring on the ground.

872
00:48:45.591 --> 00:48:48.790
Do you do a little bit of clench work,
but it's all at a very controlled pace.

873
00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:52.600
You need and get more out of that or out of putting on your sneakers and going

874
00:48:52.601 --> 00:48:56.950
for a run.
The only thing you get good out of going for a run is,
uh,

875
00:48:56.990 --> 00:49:01.720
I find running to be like a form of moving meditation.
I know,

876
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:03.400
and I think that I go over,

877
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:08.210
I go over things when I do just straight cardio work where it's forcing me in

878
00:49:08.211 --> 00:49:11.330
through the monotony of evenness sitting on an elliptical machine.
Right.

879
00:49:11.331 --> 00:49:14.080
You know,
it just forces me to think about stuff,
right?

880
00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:16.900
Cause it's not like I'm not doing anything other than this for 30 minutes and

881
00:49:16.901 --> 00:49:19.600
then see what the fuck's going on in my head.
And then,
uh,
yeah,

882
00:49:19.601 --> 00:49:23.620
I think that might be a benefit to athletes because I think a lot of athletes

883
00:49:23.621 --> 00:49:25.360
don't spend enough time visualizing,

884
00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:28.810
spend enough time thinking about the techniques and going over things in their

885
00:49:28.811 --> 00:49:29.500
head and they've,

886
00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:32.770
they've shown a direct correlation between visualization and improvement in

887
00:49:32.771 --> 00:49:35.470
technique that's on par with practice actually doing it.

888
00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:39.310
But very few people will actually go over a whole routine in their head.

889
00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:43.990
Like say if you were a wrestler and you had a series of takedowns and you put

890
00:49:43.991 --> 00:49:47.170
yourself into a state of concentration where you're only thinking about your

891
00:49:47.171 --> 00:49:52.171
wrestling and then all you do is concentrate on this power double over and over

892
00:49:52.481 --> 00:49:56.410
again.
See yourself penetrating,
see yourself sliding off that knee,

893
00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.670
getting your hands class together if you like really spent the time like a whole

894
00:50:00.671 --> 00:50:05.500
full hour and a half of nothing but that just like you would do if you were

895
00:50:05.501 --> 00:50:06.820
training nothing but that.

896
00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:12.540
I think that that is a fascinating exercise to see how much it would improve a

897
00:50:12.731 --> 00:50:16.750
guy maybe who's not doing that,
who's like already very good.
Right.
You know,

898
00:50:16.751 --> 00:50:20.290
someone who has a hard time seeing a next plateau,
you know,

899
00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:24.910
but it's a good point too.
You know,
the,
uh,
you've always got risk of injury,

900
00:50:24.911 --> 00:50:28.460
even holding pads,
you know,
doing positional.
So it's actually

901
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:29.151
<v 3>a good point.</v>

902
00:50:29.151 --> 00:50:32.810
Like you could sit down on the elliptical and then do some low level cardio,

903
00:50:32.811 --> 00:50:36.200
but like you're not just,
you know,
you're not watching TV during that thing.

904
00:50:36.201 --> 00:50:38.780
Like you're thinking through your fight strategy,

905
00:50:38.781 --> 00:50:42.350
like whatever it is that's in your B game that you're trying to bring up and

906
00:50:42.351 --> 00:50:45.740
you're really visualizing that and like,
you've got to think about like the feel,

907
00:50:45.741 --> 00:50:47.120
the smell,
the,
the,
you know,

908
00:50:47.121 --> 00:50:50.840
you've got to visualize it as detailed as you can to get the most benefit.

909
00:50:50.841 --> 00:50:54.710
But you,
you're totally spot on.
There's good stuff always dudes.

910
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:59.680
<v 0>The either annoy you that you can think of when you're doing it or dudes who</v>

911
00:50:59.681 --> 00:51:01.780
you're scared of rolling with.
Like,

912
00:51:01.781 --> 00:51:04.210
there's a certain dudes I know that I fucking hate rolling with.

913
00:51:04.211 --> 00:51:07.080
These motherfuckers don't get tired.
Right.
You know,
they tried to kill you,

914
00:51:07.081 --> 00:51:10.270
you're going to war for the next nine minutes or whatever it is,
you know.

915
00:51:10.271 --> 00:51:13.090
So I always think of those motherfuckers trying to choke me lecture,

916
00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:15.400
you know,

917
00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:18.610
there's something that you can get out of just a straight cardio exercise.

918
00:51:18.611 --> 00:51:22.840
I think mentally and physically.
Yeah,
I love doing it.
Hotel rooms.

919
00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:26.140
I don't like doing this at home because it's kind of boring compared to other

920
00:51:26.141 --> 00:51:28.660
shit I can do.
But I do this crazy elliptical workout.

921
00:51:28.661 --> 00:51:32.320
We're all sprint for 30 seconds and then I'll relax for 30 seconds,

922
00:51:32.321 --> 00:51:36.160
then I'll sprint for that and I just do as many rounds of that as I can and it's

923
00:51:36.161 --> 00:51:40.150
fucking horrendous.
I don't like doing it like it's,
it's so hard to do that.

924
00:51:40.151 --> 00:51:43.000
When I see one of these things at a hotel gym,
I'm like,
all right,

925
00:51:43.001 --> 00:51:46.990
you mother fucker.
You know,
I get like,
I was hoping I would walk in and it just,

926
00:51:46.991 --> 00:51:50.350
who'd be like a universal machine,
but if there's an elliptical machine,

927
00:51:50.351 --> 00:51:52.210
we got to go to war.
I gotta do my thing.

928
00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:55.420
That's what I do at every hotel that has this elliptical machine.

929
00:51:55.421 --> 00:51:59.140
So it's become like this,
this battle of man versus machine,
but it's a fucking,

930
00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:03.490
it's a brutal workout of just a silly little elliptical machine.
But

931
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:05.820
<v 3>I mean,
you put that,
that all out effort.
Yeah.</v>

932
00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:10.330
<v 0>Yeah.
Intervals.
What it is just crank.
You got to crank the power up,</v>

933
00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:14.980
the resistance up super high,
and you go to war for 30 seconds.

934
00:52:15.050 --> 00:52:17.310
You just got to go crazy for 30 seconds and then,

935
00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:20.660
and then crank that bitch back down to like eight or nine or seven or something

936
00:52:20.661 --> 00:52:21.251
and relaxed.

937
00:52:21.251 --> 00:52:24.570
And He'd do that for the next 30 seconds and then right back up again.
Right.

938
00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:27.580
Just keep doing it.
It's terrible.
Yeah.

939
00:52:27.581 --> 00:52:31.240
I think I would like doing curls on the universal machine better.
Yeah.

940
00:52:31.241 --> 00:52:32.410
That sounds like a lot more fun.

941
00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:36.850
[inaudible] university where she was so unrealistic.
Right.
It's so nonsensical.

942
00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:40.750
And the bench press where it kind of turns up like that.
Right.

943
00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:43.500
I remember we had those in high school and the high school wrestling around

944
00:52:43.501 --> 00:52:47.420
those,
uh,
those like a fitness area,
right?
Big Universal machine.
Yeah.

945
00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:51.400
This dude named frank piece could do the stack frank piece,
calendar thing.

946
00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:55.240
You could do the whole stack.
It's really fucking strong kid.
Or it was like,

947
00:52:55.241 --> 00:52:59.200
oh shit,
how much can you bench every day?
That was like the big question.
Right.

948
00:52:59.230 --> 00:53:01.360
And they would use like universal numbers,

949
00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:05.530
you know it's like 600 pounds universal or 200 pounds real.
Yeah.

950
00:53:05.650 --> 00:53:07.270
It's isn't that funny.
The the,
the,

951
00:53:07.271 --> 00:53:10.720
the that it's easier to push things as long as they don't have to balance them.

952
00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:13.660
When you have to balance them,
end push things,
that's when shit gets slippery.

953
00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:16.073
It's hard to,

954
00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:19.210
hard to wrap your head around why a universal machine really wouldn't work,

955
00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:22.580
but it's okay to do something on,
right.
I mean the hotel,
nothing.

956
00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:26.400
<v 3>Yeah,
totally.
In like you're on the road a lot just like I,
so you get,</v>

957
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:28.320
you get done what you can get done.
Yeah.

958
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:32.310
Do you have like a hotel workout that you do?
It depends on where the place is.

959
00:53:32.311 --> 00:53:34.950
Like if it's totally just nothing going on,

960
00:53:34.951 --> 00:53:37.650
then I'll just do some sprints like in the stairwell and stuff like that.

961
00:53:37.651 --> 00:53:39.270
And then I do some handstand pushups,

962
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:43.320
maybe some else's press to handstand and chairs doing some gymnastics stuff.

963
00:53:43.321 --> 00:53:45.360
But it really depends.
There's more,

964
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:49.470
I've been hitting like double trees now because they usually have a half decent

965
00:53:49.471 --> 00:53:51.030
gym and then like you can,

966
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:54.690
you can swing some dumbbells like you do with kettlebells and just get some

967
00:53:54.691 --> 00:53:58.080
basic strength training in and then do some intervals on like a stair master or

968
00:53:58.081 --> 00:53:58.914
an elliptical.

969
00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:03.140
<v 0>Yeah,
yeah.
If I don't work out when I'm on the road,
I feel twice as bad.
Right.</v>

970
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:06.130
There's,
there's definitely something that goes on with,
uh,

971
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:11.780
when your body goes to a new place where if you do get a good workout in,

972
00:54:11.781 --> 00:54:14.690
it's sort of makes everything feel okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.

973
00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.400
It was sort of like a little bit of a reset.
Like if I,

974
00:54:16.401 --> 00:54:20.120
if I fly into Dallas or something,
I'm like a little foggy from the trip.

975
00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:25.430
If I hit the gym hard,
it just whoop,
sorta pulls you back.
Sort of levels it off.

976
00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:26.790
What is,
what is going on when,

977
00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:30.170
when that happens isn't just an endorphin rush from the training,

978
00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:33.020
<v 3>you know,
heating up your body,
it just,
Eh,
you,</v>

979
00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:36.760
you crank up all the metabolic processes going on.
So it definitely,
you know,

980
00:54:36.761 --> 00:54:39.370
the endorphin rush is nice because you just feel better from that.

981
00:54:39.371 --> 00:54:41.680
But whenever you heat your body up,

982
00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:44.920
you are kind of accelerating all the processes in the body.

983
00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.020
And so you're going to acclimate a little better.

984
00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:51.430
They're taking some Melatonin when you travel,
you know,
that helps reset things.

985
00:54:51.431 --> 00:54:54.990
But exercise has been known for a long time to help you.

986
00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:59.020
If you didn't exercise and you did like,
uh,
uh,
USA to Europe travel,

987
00:54:59.021 --> 00:55:03.100
it's going to take longer to get acclimated versus if you exercised every day.

988
00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:06.700
<v 0>Now,
when you,
um,
if you,</v>

989
00:55:06.701 --> 00:55:11.480
if you go to a place and you,
you know,
you,
you settle in and you,
uh,

990
00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:14.770
you,
you do exercise and you do take Melatonin to sleep,

991
00:55:14.771 --> 00:55:18.790
what is like best case scenario for you settling into a new time zone?
Like,

992
00:55:18.791 --> 00:55:21.100
if someone goes from California to New York,

993
00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:24.990
<v 3>you know,
three times zones isn't too bad.
It'd probably be a couple of days.</v>

994
00:55:24.991 --> 00:55:27.930
If you go off,
you know,
six to nine times zones,

995
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:31.410
it's going to take a week at least.
And you're probably gonna feel pretty rough.

996
00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:34.980
And if you're younger it's not going to be as bad if you're older.

997
00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:38.650
<v 0>I had friends that went to Australia when they came back,
they were fucked.
Yeah,</v>

998
00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:40.670
there were fuck for awhile.
They're like,

999
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:43.890
it's just like I haven't been the same and two weeks.
Man.
That's crazy.

1000
00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:46.470
<v 3>Yeah.
And you,
you get out and exercise.</v>

1001
00:55:46.471 --> 00:55:50.340
Ideally you get outside during the evening when the sun is setting that the

1002
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:54.450
communication of the light into the brain kind of reset some stuff there is

1003
00:55:54.451 --> 00:55:55.980
really important for normal sleep.

1004
00:55:56.690 --> 00:56:01.670
So you should actually watch the sun turned into dark.
Ideally be outside.
Yeah.

1005
00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:04.990
Yeah.
That's what that is.
Suddenly amps are good.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1006
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:09.070
What are the Sun Lamps?
They're like these lamps that uh,
you,

1007
00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:12.870
you get to that,
that simulate the sun.

1008
00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:16.560
Like they glow really bright like you haven't,
that you could like wake up to it.

1009
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.770
Like it's an alarm clock on those and it really,

1010
00:56:18.771 --> 00:56:21.540
and they start getting brighter and brighter and brighter and you wake up with

1011
00:56:21.541 --> 00:56:24.520
this huge glowing light and in your bedroom

1012
00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:27.880
<v 1>and it,
it just kind of makes you feel like a tricks your body.</v>

1013
00:56:27.881 --> 00:56:30.790
Like people in Alaska have these lights all the time because of

1014
00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:35.790
<v 0>the,
the,
the periods of time when it's,
you know,
that,</v>

1015
00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:41.570
or always daylight too.
Those are that reverse there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think it's both.

1016
00:56:41.571 --> 00:56:44.720
Right.
Nutty,
motherfucking place to live.

1017
00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:48.980
Have you ever seen the show mountain men?
Yeah.
It's a great fucking,
it's crazy.

1018
00:56:48.981 --> 00:56:52.040
It's my new favorite show.
That Guy Marty who lives in Alaska.

1019
00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:53.810
They haven't seen the show folks.

1020
00:56:53.811 --> 00:56:57.400
It's about three different dudes who live a one South Carolina,
once Montana,

1021
00:56:57.410 --> 00:57:01.520
ones,
Alaska.
The Alaska Dude flies everywhere in a plane.

1022
00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:05.240
If it goes for hours to be away from his family or excuse me,

1023
00:57:05.241 --> 00:57:09.000
months rather to be away from his family and just traps animals.
Right.

1024
00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:13.580
He's 24 miles on a fucking one of those.
Uh,
what are the,

1025
00:57:13.581 --> 00:57:18.380
what are the snowmobile,
snowmobile things?
It's craziness.
Like,

1026
00:57:18.381 --> 00:57:19.700
you know,
you think you got it hard.

1027
00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:23.990
This guy makes a living killing little animals and selling their skins three

1028
00:57:23.991 --> 00:57:28.610
hours by plane from his house all to escape his family probably,
right?

1029
00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.940
Yeah.
It's probably a bullshit,
right?
Yeah.
Well I've got to do what I gotta do.

1030
00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:34.760
Meanwhile,
he could be trapping like right next to his fucking house.

1031
00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:37.190
Thinking about how many goddamn animals there are in Alaska.

1032
00:57:37.191 --> 00:57:39.560
Why didn't have to go to the middle of nowhere and your plane?
Yeah,

1033
00:57:39.561 --> 00:57:43.490
he's probably up there beating off trapping squatch and it just comes over
there.

1034
00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:48.080
Just stack a porn.
Why?
Why is the plane so heavy this time?
I don't know.

1035
00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.920
Couldn't find anything different.
Magazines on one side and gasoline.

1036
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:56.910
It's just all DVDs,
all porno DVDs,
all Asian to,
you know,

1037
00:57:56.911 --> 00:58:01.440
find an Asian chicks up in Alaska do very rare.
Unless they're,
unless they're,

1038
00:58:01.441 --> 00:58:06.040
they literally walked there from Asia on the Bering Strait,
the Inuits.

1039
00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:09.140
<v 1>What if they have like the best Asian and we didn't even know this whole time,</v>

1040
00:58:09.141 --> 00:58:11.420
new type of Asian.
It's like,
it's like their secret.

1041
00:58:11.550 --> 00:58:14.320
I see what you're trying to sell.
Last occasion,
Alaska.
It is weird though.

1042
00:58:14.321 --> 00:58:16.610
It Alaska is not attached.
That's hilarious.

1043
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:20.660
Like how can you claim something that's attached to another fucking country?

1044
00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:25.560
You know?
Nobody wanted it.
It's kind of like us.
Some Baja not one it.
Yeah.

1045
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:27.900
Why would nobody wanted,
they didn't want to get eaten.

1046
00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:31.010
They bought it for cheap back in the day though.
So yeah.

1047
00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:34.450
<v 0>This dude who lives up there,
man,
this guy's a locator.</v>

1048
00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:39.740
That's a crazy life.
And he does it every year.
Same thing.
Every year it was,

1049
00:58:39.741 --> 00:58:41.570
he was outside.
It was like 50 below zero

1050
00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:45.810
<v 1>like you could piss and it's going to be frozen before it hits the ground.
Yeah.</v>

1051
00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:49.330
That's amazing.
Maybe you could not make it grow.
My pisses a lot.

1052
00:58:49.770 --> 00:58:53.280
It's a piss with fight it off.
You drink your own.

1053
00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:55.260
Do you ever drink your own piss?
I do not.

1054
00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:02.040
That would be a quote at the bottom of the message boards.

1055
00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:04.760
It would be someone's signature I bright red bed.

1056
00:59:04.761 --> 00:59:07.090
Do you drink piss drinks is on.

1057
00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:11.460
I have my own purse.
I don't do it on a regular basis.

1058
00:59:11.850 --> 00:59:15.520
I am part of the lunatic fringe,
but I haven't gone down that route.
So yeah,
they

1059
00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:17.730
<v 0>taste that bad.
It's like bugs.
It's on your head.</v>

1060
00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:20.611
Doesn't taste bad at all.

1061
00:59:20.611 --> 00:59:25.340
But I'd read some shit like a new Liotta Machita drinks his own piss does it

1062
00:59:25.341 --> 00:59:29.130
every morning while I'm in his father.
What's the fucking one?
Well,

1063
00:59:29.131 --> 00:59:32.690
mark has his famous for tricking his own past the boxer.
Yeah.
There's a,

1064
00:59:32.790 --> 00:59:37.790
this idea of urine therapy's supposed to like there's vitamins and nutrients

1065
00:59:37.911 --> 00:59:41.870
that,
that go through your body that uh,
don't get used by your body,

1066
00:59:41.871 --> 00:59:44.600
but they're in their past.
But they will get used if you drink your pes.

1067
00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:46.430
Does that sound retarded

1068
00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:51.850
<v 3>possibility there?
Like if you,
uh,
if your wife has,
her girlfriend is pregnant,</v>

1069
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:56.870
then a hcg human chorionic gonadotropin is a hormone that stimulates like

1070
00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:59.520
testosterone release also.

1071
00:59:59.790 --> 01:00:02.910
So like he could collect their urine because the HCG is really high in the

1072
01:00:02.911 --> 01:00:07.020
pregnant chicks and then concentrate it down and get jacked from that.
Wow.

1073
01:00:07.021 --> 01:00:07.854
You get Jack

1074
01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:11.840
<v 0>Why's pis?
Who would've thought,
fuck me.
That's where it all started from.</v>

1075
01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:15.670
Dudes are smart.
They knew what the fuck was up.
Jimmy Norton Zonda some,

1076
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.500
he's going to be all buff any day in a huge,
that's why his neck so vague.

1077
01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.940
I wonder if,
uh,

1078
01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:23.630
how the fuck anybody ever figured that out that you know there's any sort of

1079
01:00:23.631 --> 01:00:26.450
vitamins and nutrients to be had and drinking your own urine?

1080
01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:31.390
<v 3>I don't know.
I don't use it.
It's like the core to saps.
Like why did this guy,</v>

1081
01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.110
you know,
Caterpillar with the fungus on it.

1082
01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.870
I just think people had lower standards in the past.

1083
01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:40.970
Like if you don't know about hygiene and bacteria and stuff like that,
fuck yeah.

1084
01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:41.873
It's like why not?

1085
01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.360
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1086
01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:47.840
I know for when people that take mushrooms,

1087
01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:52.700
that's supposed to be the end all experience is you recycle your urine while

1088
01:00:52.701 --> 01:00:53.534
you're tripping.
Right.

1089
01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:57.830
And apparently there's more silicon or psilocybin or whatever the fuck the

1090
01:00:57.831 --> 01:01:02.150
psychoactive ingredients is in the urine.
So as you drink it,
it's your,

1091
01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:06.600
it gets reabsorbed and it shoots you to the center of the universe.
Usually the,

1092
01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:11.020
I'm crazy,
my mushrooms,
the last thing I could do is drink or eat or it,

1093
01:01:11.021 --> 01:01:14.380
especially my training in your own piss.
Yeah.
I talked to a dude who did it.

1094
01:01:14.410 --> 01:01:16.760
He said,
you know,
everybody was telling you you've got to drink your urine.

1095
01:01:16.761 --> 01:01:20.000
You got it.
He was like,
I'm not tracking my fucking pissed.
I'm already high.

1096
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:22.580
He goes,
I'm thinking,
I'm already tripping balls.
And he said,

1097
01:01:22.581 --> 01:01:26.720
so they talked me into drinking my past.
I drank it and just,
he goes,
I can't.

1098
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:31.750
It was like I was pulled back in like a slingshot and when to let go to the

1099
01:01:32.541 --> 01:01:33.760
center of the universe.
Right.

1100
01:01:34.110 --> 01:01:39.110
<v 3>I think just like stacking psilocybin plus Mescalin plus Lsd is probably a more</v>

1101
01:01:40.051 --> 01:01:43.390
direct route to that.
Instead of light drinking.
Well,

1102
01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.960
it's supposed to be just an accelerated

1103
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:46.040
<v 0>version of the mushroom trip.</v>

1104
01:01:46.041 --> 01:01:48.070
It's not like a confusing blend of different tricks.

1105
01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:53.290
The idea is just when you drink your own urine,
apparently the uh,
the,

1106
01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:57.470
the,
the real experience kicks in.
It's like that takes it to the next level.

1107
01:01:57.471 --> 01:02:00.050
It's so trippy that it takes it to the next level.

1108
01:02:00.051 --> 01:02:04.030
I think I would try math first.
I'm going gonna just blow that nomadic.

1109
01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:06.620
The dude who did it,
the dude who did it,
I swear to God,

1110
01:02:06.621 --> 01:02:08.850
there's some people that come back from some,

1111
01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:11.630
I mean a real or imagined experience like that.

1112
01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:15.320
So humbled that they really are a different person and that's how this guy was.

1113
01:02:15.321 --> 01:02:17.170
I was like,
what happened to you?
Like,
what's going on with the like,
Yo,

1114
01:02:17.171 --> 01:02:21.810
you like it was the dude seemed like almost pious.

1115
01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:26.550
It was weird.
It was like he like was noticeably softer and tone,

1116
01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:30.750
noticeably more humbles.
It was,
it was weird.
I go,
what happened?

1117
01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:34.290
And then he tells me this whole story.
I'm like,
Holy Shit.
How long ago was that?

1118
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:38.460
Like to a year later he was back to himself.
When you have the full reality peel,

1119
01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:41.640
like when you have that complete reality peel,

1120
01:02:41.641 --> 01:02:44.780
it should change you a little bit.
It should.
Yeah.

1121
01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:48.690
It should knock your fucking socks off.
It should let you know like,
Whoa,

1122
01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:53.460
you might,
you might be wrong.
So,
and this might not be normal at all.
Right?

1123
01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:55.500
This world might be full of crazy,

1124
01:02:55.501 --> 01:02:58.170
magical things that can happen at any moment in time.

1125
01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.900
That's how I feel about food poisoning sometimes.
Also,

1126
01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:05.960
I learned a lot from food poisoning.
Yeah,
well,
you know,
Taco way ever again.

1127
01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:11.010
You say that,
but Sunday Sushi,
that cultures that didn't have psychedelics,

1128
01:03:11.011 --> 01:03:16.011
they had a rituals and rites of passages through different substances that

1129
01:03:16.111 --> 01:03:20.210
would,
would,
there would be poisoned.
They'd basically like,
uh,
like a,

1130
01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:23.700
I think there's the name for these substances.

1131
01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:27.990
It's,
it's,
they're,
they're essentially toxins that don't kill you,

1132
01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:32.430
but you go through this ordeal poisoning,
that's what it's called.

1133
01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:36.390
They're called ordeal poisons.
And you go through this horrible,
horrible,

1134
01:03:36.391 --> 01:03:39.060
horrible experience.
And,
and when it's over,
when it passes,

1135
01:03:39.061 --> 01:03:44.010
you're so happy to be alive that you like,
you become nicer to people.

1136
01:03:44.011 --> 01:03:46.860
You become,
you.
You learned something from it.
I agree.

1137
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:51.630
And so instead of having that come through the amazing and enlightening

1138
01:03:51.631 --> 01:03:55.500
experience of the silicide and experience,
so the mushroom trip,
instead of that,

1139
01:03:55.650 --> 01:03:58.140
you just almost die.
Just almost,

1140
01:03:58.141 --> 01:04:01.840
just the whole fucking thing falls apart on you.
Ah,

1141
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:03.660
don't tell my wife about this.

1142
01:04:03.661 --> 01:04:07.710
She could possibly try to improve me if I recommended it.
Yeah.

1143
01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:10.860
You go that route.
What would she improve?
If she can improve?

1144
01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:14.280
You seem like a great guy.
Maybe I would cook more

1145
01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:19.800
homey,
like super strict with the Paleo is everybody has to follow that.

1146
01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:22.920
You know what I mean?
I actually do all the cooking,
so I mean,
it's like,
oh,

1147
01:04:22.921 --> 01:04:25.260
really.
Dot.
I do all the cooking.
And so,
I mean,

1148
01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:30.120
I just folks pretty much eat what I throw out there and a good gay wife.
I would,

1149
01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:35.130
I would
so you,
um,
uh,

1150
01:04:35.131 --> 01:04:38.910
always organic,
always grass fed.
You know,

1151
01:04:38.911 --> 01:04:42.480
we do the grass fed gig because we have a friend that owns a dairy and so we can

1152
01:04:42.481 --> 01:04:47.340
get grass fed me super easy and we have a big freezer from the guy who's
killing.

1153
01:04:47.370 --> 01:04:49.520
Aw,
that's amazing.
What a hookup.

1154
01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:52.260
And we get all the giblets and everything with it and stuff like that.

1155
01:04:52.261 --> 01:04:55.820
But if people don't respect all those giblets people don't respect Turkey,
heart,

1156
01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:58.770
chicken hearts and turning the hearts,
they're delicious then.
Yeah.

1157
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:02.910
And the chicken hearts are fucking delicious,
man.
That's what I love about,
uh,

1158
01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:07.270
in Brazil,
when you go to Fogo to Shawl in Brazil that you Hoss Korea,
right?
Hey,

1159
01:05:07.271 --> 01:05:10.380
bring out scores of chicken hearts and everybody was like,
Hey,

1160
01:05:10.381 --> 01:05:14.200
I'm might give him here,
bitch.
Give me fucking pussies.
Scared of.

1161
01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:18.130
They're delicious.
It's like a weird taste to it.

1162
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:22.810
<v 2>It's like chewy but not too chewy.
It's tender.
Super nutritious.</v>

1163
01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:28.120
Creepy.
It's creepy.
I like that little little chicken heart.

1164
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.370
There's a place I,
you know that place at lax,

1165
01:05:30.371 --> 01:05:32.960
somebody told me the restaurant that looks like at unite,

1166
01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:36.360
this weird futuristic forward.
Somebody told me that,

1167
01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:38.290
that they serve crazy food.

1168
01:05:38.291 --> 01:05:42.610
They're like ants and bugs and like creepy shit now.
Really?
Yeah.

1169
01:05:42.611 --> 01:05:44.040
Like it's just like a fear factor.

1170
01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:49.240
So like an international oddity sort of a ride.
I've never heard of that.
Yeah.

1171
01:05:49.241 --> 01:05:50.340
Somebody just told me that I don't,

1172
01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:54.040
I don't want you to Google that shit if find out if it's true that bad health

1173
01:05:54.041 --> 01:05:58.960
department scenario,
none of them have that roach.

1174
01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.230
That's a part of our festivities here where we have a,

1175
01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:05.560
there's a lot of countries where they do eat bugs cause I have to write.

1176
01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:09.910
So it's a high source of protein,
really nutritious.
But it's,

1177
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:15.150
I just had a guy that sent me a cricket protein bar from Thailand.

1178
01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:18.880
Yo,
cricket protein.
Yeah.
So to grow these crickets,

1179
01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:23.440
you ate this.
It wasn't bad.
It wasn't bad.
You're a bold man.

1180
01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:27.730
I would not think that anybody working in a fucking cricket protein bar in

1181
01:06:27.731 --> 01:06:31.150
Thailand would be clean and tidy.

1182
01:06:31.151 --> 01:06:35.590
And there was no hell shit into the batch.
Every now and again they could have,

1183
01:06:35.591 --> 01:06:37.330
but there was no like Hep a apparently,

1184
01:06:37.331 --> 01:06:41.450
like I didn't get doubled over from anything,
so nothing went wrong.
No,
not,
yeah,

1185
01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:45.010
it's crickets.
Why not?
You know,
it's funny,
we were,
were so weird.
We,

1186
01:06:45.011 --> 01:06:48.400
lobsters and lobsters have a lot of the same.

1187
01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:53.800
They're just a water cricket.
It's a water roach.
Giant Roche.
Yeah,
it's,

1188
01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:58.810
it actually,
if you eat roaches,
it's the,
if you are allergic to shellfish,

1189
01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:01.180
you'll eat roaches,
you'll get fucked up.

1190
01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:02.770
We learned that on fear factor the hard way.

1191
01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:08.180
The dude had a shellfish allergy and he had eight roaches and,
uh,
MP pen.
Yeah.

1192
01:07:08.181 --> 01:07:11.380
Yeah.
He had a,
he had to get jacked with,
what is it?
Adrenaline.

1193
01:07:11.381 --> 01:07:13.240
They shoot you with epinephrine or adrenaline.

1194
01:07:14.110 --> 01:07:17.680
Here's this thing called throat was closing in.
Here's the thing they caught,

1195
01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:21.940
it's called typhoon,
I guess.
Uh,
Taiwan.
It's crickets,
crickets,
amphibian,

1196
01:07:21.941 --> 01:07:26.380
Scorpions,
larvae.
But they also have empanadas frog legs,

1197
01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:29.780
Filipino.
Some variety.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1198
01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:32.500
It seems like they're just trying to go like super international look,

1199
01:07:32.501 --> 01:07:37.330
New Zealand,
New Zealand food,
Filipino food.

1200
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:41.370
It looks like it looks Yummy,
man.
That makes me a Jay,
do you,

1201
01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:46.690
do you have a hard time with your,
your diet going to restaurants?
Not really.

1202
01:07:46.691 --> 01:07:50.380
I mean like,
like the,
uh,
Brazilian barbecue is a perfect example.

1203
01:07:50.381 --> 01:07:54.490
They've always got tons of meat,
fruit,
veggies.
I mean,
it's usually pretty easy.

1204
01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:57.210
We have those places are so healthy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1205
01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:01.510
We spent two weeks in Florence,
Italy,
and it wasn't hard to eat this way.
I mean,

1206
01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:03.970
there's always a chunk of meat.
There's always like some veggies,

1207
01:08:03.971 --> 01:08:07.930
so it's not that bad.
It's pretty easy.
You a totally avoid pastas.

1208
01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:13.180
Grains yet,
like I'll have a little bit of corn,
like some corn Tortillas,
but uh,

1209
01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:16.100
yeah,
like any wheat containing item.
Like if I had some wheat

1210
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:20.900
<v 3>in your bathroom out there would be blue commission.
Like a,
a Zq Pasta.</v>

1211
01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:22.070
No,
no.

1212
01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:26.870
Like it's still like the sprouted grains reduce the problematic proteins that

1213
01:08:26.871 --> 01:08:30.800
cause the inflammation in the gut,
but they're not totally gone.
So like,
you know,

1214
01:08:30.801 --> 01:08:34.160
someone like you,
you might be a little more resistant to it and you,
you know,

1215
01:08:34.161 --> 01:08:38.090
like if you had say like whole wheat pasta,
we might see some problems.

1216
01:08:38.091 --> 01:08:41.720
You have the as eeky old type Pasta,
it,
you don't really see the problems.

1217
01:08:41.721 --> 01:08:43.820
Whereas for me,
I would still have some problems with it.

1218
01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:46.340
So I'm kind of like the canary in the coal mine with it.

1219
01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:51.450
<v 0>Yeah.
I like [inaudible] Ezekiel Pasta if you've never had it folks.
It's a,
um,</v>

1220
01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:55.990
it's a sprouted grain.
They make bread Ezekiel bread and it's a really,

1221
01:08:55.991 --> 01:08:59.110
it's based on how it says to make bread in the Bible apparently,

1222
01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:03.440
<v 3>or just kind of trip it,
you know,
the super healthy grains and legumes,</v>

1223
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:08.210
if you eat them without sprouting,
like they literally can make you sick.

1224
01:09:08.270 --> 01:09:12.490
Like if you just took them uncooked and Aidan.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It would make you,

1225
01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:14.850
and nobody ever like just eats wheat.
Right.
And,

1226
01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:17.290
and that's why like it literally would make you sick.

1227
01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:21.020
Did they ever figure out how to eat it?
How long were you desperate?
Where people,

1228
01:09:21.570 --> 01:09:24.370
I don't know,
but I mean,
you know,
how do you figure out to,

1229
01:09:24.371 --> 01:09:26.180
to like stick it in a bucket of water,

1230
01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:30.050
let it sprout and start smelling a little bit fermented and then start eating
it.

1231
01:09:30.051 --> 01:09:33.770
Like,
I don't know.
How do you ever eat a coconut?
Have you ever eaten a lobster?

1232
01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:39.110
Well,
lobsters,
I could see giving it a shot man and some bugs.

1233
01:09:39.111 --> 01:09:42.380
Anything with a face.
It's kind of like,
just don't eat the business end of it.

1234
01:09:42.381 --> 01:09:47.330
And you're pretty good.
Yeah.
Whichever in that may be.

1235
01:09:47.331 --> 01:09:50.450
So it depends on which business you're talking about it.
Yes.
So think about

1236
01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:54.580
<v 0>by an actual Vegan Diet like the China study and you know,</v>

1237
01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:58.920
things along those lines where people have been advocating a completely

1238
01:09:58.921 --> 01:10:02.210
vegetable based diet.
Is that,
is that

1239
01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:05.720
<v 3>[inaudible]?
I think it's an improvement off the standard American diet.</v>

1240
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:07.760
Like typically people are eating more fruit,

1241
01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:10.490
more veggies are more conscious about the stuff that they're reading.

1242
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:14.840
I just don't see people thriving on that long term.
And what is the problem?

1243
01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:18.020
They don't get enough protein.
They don't get enough B vitamins.

1244
01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:24.450
<v 0>Excuse me.
Crazy Vegan people.
I love you.
Well,
you get a little crazy,</v>

1245
01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:29.550
but they do have a point in that there are some plants that have a full amino

1246
01:10:29.551 --> 01:10:33.270
acid spectrum,
right?
They have,
they have all the amino acids is

1247
01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:37.750
<v 3>full protein.
You can,
you can stay alive.
You just don't one of those,
yeah,</v>

1248
01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:41.760
I call them third world proteins.
Like you'll survive,
but you won't thrive.

1249
01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:44.760
Like what is the difference between them and what you get from meat?

1250
01:10:44.850 --> 01:10:49.590
You just get such a concentrated source of proteins from me.

1251
01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:51.300
And on a hormonal level,

1252
01:10:51.301 --> 01:10:55.230
you're releasing insulin and Glucagon when you eat protein and that that is

1253
01:10:55.231 --> 01:10:58.740
really beneficial for energy levels,
for muscle mass.
I mean when you,

1254
01:10:58.741 --> 01:11:01.140
when you look at most of the Vegan athletes,

1255
01:11:01.141 --> 01:11:03.270
particularly in the kind of body building and strength seen,

1256
01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:06.180
they're always using like some sort of protein concentrate,

1257
01:11:06.181 --> 01:11:10.050
like a rice protein concentrate or something.
They're not just eating beans,

1258
01:11:10.051 --> 01:11:12.570
rice keen.
While they're not really eating whole foods,

1259
01:11:12.571 --> 01:11:16.020
they're still a concentrated proteins or they,

1260
01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.740
I mean they just fail miserably when they do that.

1261
01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:23.060
When they do eat the concentrate of protein source,
is that sufficient?
I,

1262
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:25.860
it'll,
it'll work.
But you,
you know,

1263
01:11:25.861 --> 01:11:30.180
it's like to eat the concentrated protein from a cow or from brown rice and hemp

1264
01:11:30.181 --> 01:11:33.930
protein and,
and for me it's like I just do the cow because it works better.

1265
01:11:33.931 --> 01:11:37.540
It tastes better.
It works better.
Yeah.
It just works better.
And this is

1266
01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.920
<v 0>when you say,
I'm sorry to as,</v>

1267
01:11:39.930 --> 01:11:42.480
because my vegan friends would go crazy if I didn't.

1268
01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:44.460
When you say it works better,

1269
01:11:44.461 --> 01:11:48.870
have there been studies where they have shown a decrease in physical performance

1270
01:11:48.871 --> 01:11:50.340
because of following a Vegan diet

1271
01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:56.610
as opposed to an or or an increase in,
in a meeting diet?
I mean,

1272
01:11:56.611 --> 01:11:58.140
has there ever been any study done

1273
01:11:58.690 --> 01:12:03.690
<v 3>studies comparing vegetarian diets to mixed diets and typically the performance</v>

1274
01:12:03.821 --> 01:12:06.520
and not as good.
So I mean there is some,

1275
01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:10.640
<v 0>the only way they would really tell right is to like get an athlete,</v>

1276
01:12:10.641 --> 01:12:13.790
put them on it,
see what their performance is,
get that same athlete,

1277
01:12:13.791 --> 01:12:17.450
put them on this other diets and then isn't that sort of bio specific to that

1278
01:12:17.451 --> 01:12:18.284
one individual?

1279
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:22.980
<v 3>Yeah.
And you know,
like a Carl Lewis is,
is kind of carried around is,</v>

1280
01:12:22.981 --> 01:12:25.850
is a Vegan success.
He had one year of uh,

1281
01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:29.550
of good performance and then his performance tanked after that.

1282
01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:33.000
And it was during a time that you would reasonably assume that he,
you know,

1283
01:12:33.001 --> 01:12:37.140
kind of like,
Ooh,
St Bolt,
that he should continue to improve.
Right.
And so that,

1284
01:12:37.141 --> 01:12:41.310
that's where like you take somebody eating a standard American diet that's super

1285
01:12:41.311 --> 01:12:44.310
proinflammatory.
It's tons of refined foods and everything.

1286
01:12:44.311 --> 01:12:46.650
You put him on a Vegan Diet,
I think they're probably going to look,

1287
01:12:46.651 --> 01:12:50.130
feel and perform better.
Like there's no doubt about that down the road.

1288
01:12:50.131 --> 01:12:52.920
I just don't see people doing as well.
And,
and you know,

1289
01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:58.050
it's not like you need to eat,
uh,
uh,
boatloads of meat to round out,
you know,

1290
01:12:58.051 --> 01:13:02.710
like say you take this Vegan Diet that I would still put like Paleo carbs in it

1291
01:13:02.711 --> 01:13:07.620
instead of,
uh,
beans,
rice keen won stuff.
I would have yams,
sweet potatoes,

1292
01:13:07.621 --> 01:13:09.840
fruits,
veggies,
which still have more vitamins,

1293
01:13:09.841 --> 01:13:13.230
minerals and antioxidants per calorie.
So you're still good there.

1294
01:13:13.231 --> 01:13:16.410
And then if you throw in a little bit of eggs,
a little bit of finish,

1295
01:13:16.411 --> 01:13:19.890
a little bit of meat,
like you're getting a ton of nutrition from that,

1296
01:13:19.891 --> 01:13:22.080
you're going to build muscle,
you're going to recover well.

1297
01:13:22.410 --> 01:13:25.140
And it doesn't need to be like the whole part of the Diet.

1298
01:13:25.170 --> 01:13:28.290
That's where like the individual,
you know,
specifics,
you know,

1299
01:13:28.291 --> 01:13:31.160
dialing this stuff in could really work.
But

1300
01:13:31.410 --> 01:13:33.890
<v 0>in eggs for folks who don't know,</v>

1301
01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:37.580
cause I didn't even know this until I was in my thirties which is very sad.

1302
01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:40.190
But eggs,
you don't kill anything to get an egg.

1303
01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:41.540
The chicken lays an egg every night.

1304
01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:45.700
It's not like if you have like a moral sort of a quandary.
Yeah.

1305
01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:50.090
Quandary about eating animals and killing animals,
that's okay.
But chicken,
eggs,

1306
01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:53.030
like you don't have to be,
you don't have to fertilize those eggs.

1307
01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:57.040
They pop out every day.
Everybody's fine.
Eat the egg.
No one dies,
you

1308
01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.540
<v 3>know,
on,
on the moral side.</v>

1309
01:13:58.541 --> 01:14:02.440
And I will probably have the vegans come and kill me if anybody ever comes and

1310
01:14:02.441 --> 01:14:03.040
kills me.

1311
01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:07.600
It's either going to be militant Vegan or a religious fanatic.

1312
01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:10.600
And those people will track me down at my house and kill me and probably

1313
01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:13.980
decorate their house with my intestines or something.
But yeah,
that's,

1314
01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:18.040
you just gave them a pretty picture is you're taking their pants off right now.

1315
01:14:20.210 --> 01:14:21.580
Oh,
make it so,

1316
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:26.750
but there was this professor that did an economic analysis of meeting versus not

1317
01:14:26.951 --> 01:14:31.720
mediating and this whole kind of moralistic stance.

1318
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:33.490
And they call it the least harm principle.

1319
01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:37.240
Like what could you do with regards to the food supply that's going to kill the

1320
01:14:37.241 --> 01:14:42.130
fewest animals and the vegans kind of paint this picture that if I eat beans and

1321
01:14:42.131 --> 01:14:45.000
rice and and chemo on stuff,
that is somehow a bloodless affair,

1322
01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:49.000
but tons of animals are killed in the process of farming.
You know,

1323
01:14:49.001 --> 01:14:52.780
and and so you mean like small animals?
All animals?
Yeah.
Yes.

1324
01:14:52.781 --> 01:14:54.100
Snakes and birds.

1325
01:14:54.170 --> 01:14:57.790
And just the fact that the way that we do mega farming,

1326
01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:00.850
you destroy whole ecosystems to do that.

1327
01:15:00.851 --> 01:15:04.660
Where it's like there's this Guy Joel Salitan who has the Polyface farms and

1328
01:15:04.661 --> 01:15:08.710
they do biodynamic farming where you've got pigs and chickens and it's outside

1329
01:15:08.711 --> 01:15:12.730
and they use solar power that that farm produces more food,
more,

1330
01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:17.470
more nutrition per acre than any of farm on the planet.
Where is this,

1331
01:15:17.471 --> 01:15:21.280
where they did a New Hampshire,
I think Polyface farms.
Joel Salitan.
Cool Dude.

1332
01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:23.110
Cool Dude.
And what has you have it set up?

1333
01:15:23.111 --> 01:15:27.340
He has it set up so the cattle will go through and graze on grass,

1334
01:15:27.341 --> 01:15:29.130
which is what they're designed to do to eat.

1335
01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:32.140
They're not designed to eat grains and you don't have to put any oil into

1336
01:15:32.141 --> 01:15:34.450
producing grass like you need to produce grains,
you know?

1337
01:15:34.450 --> 01:15:38.360
So there's that whole thing.
Then after the cattle go through and they put up a,

1338
01:15:38.361 --> 01:15:41.470
a solar powered electric fences to move these critters around.
Sorry,

1339
01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:44.890
what do you eat oil to produce grains.
What?
Yeah,
what do you mean?

1340
01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:49.320
Like all of the farm machinery and all the infrastructure too,
right?
Yeah.

1341
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:53.890
I mean it's a hugely intensive versus,
yeah.
Yeah.

1342
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:56.710
Or,
or even say like fruit and nut trees.

1343
01:15:56.711 --> 01:16:00.170
Like they're relatively start feeding them grains.
Uh,

1344
01:16:00.670 --> 01:16:02.020
early 1970s,

1345
01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:06.280
there were some fluctuations in food prices and there was a desire on the part

1346
01:16:06.281 --> 01:16:10.630
of the US government,
I think it was right at the end of Nixon's scene,

1347
01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:15.340
they started dumping a bunch of subsidy money into intensifying farm production

1348
01:16:15.341 --> 01:16:17.770
of basically like corn and soybeans and stuff like that.

1349
01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.800
And they wanted to create an export commodity out of that.

1350
01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:24.660
And when we started producing all of this,
this,
uh,

1351
01:16:25.090 --> 01:16:28.570
grain like high carbohydrate stuff,
we needed to do something with it,

1352
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:31.030
which is where we then started,
you know,

1353
01:16:31.031 --> 01:16:34.840
recommending it via things like the food pyramid that you need to eat,
you know,

1354
01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:38.410
12 servings of whole grain today and stuff like that.
So it was a,

1355
01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:43.210
a government sponsored move,
which I'm just totally a nutcase libertarian,

1356
01:16:43.211 --> 01:16:46.140
like I guess can't fucking stand the government coming in and,

1357
01:16:46.141 --> 01:16:50.680
and subsidizing any industry because you end up destroying the market forces

1358
01:16:50.681 --> 01:16:51.850
that would normally control it.

1359
01:16:51.851 --> 01:16:55.510
So now we have a twinkie that costs less than an apple,

1360
01:16:55.690 --> 01:16:58.360
but it really doesn't cost less because we're paying for the subsidized

1361
01:16:58.361 --> 01:17:02.680
production of that food via taxes and via going and acquiring oil and all these

1362
01:17:02.681 --> 01:17:05.230
other indirect methods.
So if you,

1363
01:17:05.231 --> 01:17:09.890
you had kind of decentralized farming and you have something that looks like the

1364
01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:12.980
Polyface farms where they grow cattle and horses and pigs,

1365
01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:15.940
and it's all kind of a self contained nutrient cycles.

1366
01:17:15.941 --> 01:17:19.280
So the cattle go through and then the chickens go through and move the,
you know,

1367
01:17:19.281 --> 01:17:20.190
the cow poop around.

1368
01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.300
<v 0>And then you've got all these talks and live like that.</v>

1369
01:17:22.301 --> 01:17:25.150
I've always thought that that would be such a cool fucking thing to be able to

1370
01:17:25.151 --> 01:17:28.960
buy a farm somewhere and actually have it set up like that where you'd get all

1371
01:17:28.961 --> 01:17:32.500
your food from the ground.
That would be fucking amazing.

1372
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:37.210
So it sounds like a pain in the Dick though.
That's your life.

1373
01:17:37.211 --> 01:17:39.850
Be Labor intensive.
That's your life.
That's your life.
Your Life.

1374
01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:43.390
Forget about Jujitsu class.
I forget about playing pool.

1375
01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:46.210
You gotta milk some counts.
Get your kids involved.

1376
01:17:46.211 --> 01:17:48.410
The kids going to have to start working right out far.

1377
01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:52.540
I want my kids to work on a farm.
Right.
Throwing Hay and shit.

1378
01:17:52.890 --> 01:17:54.370
Then a tornado comes,

1379
01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:57.610
carries a little joeys Brian Farms on are always where tornadoes are.

1380
01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:59.140
You could have a farm in California,

1381
01:17:59.170 --> 01:18:00.940
but I guess they do have tornadoes in California.

1382
01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:04.400
They spotted a little one recently up around Chico.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1383
01:18:04.410 --> 01:18:07.870
I'm shit shit could go down anywhere.
Those whole thing is a big fat,

1384
01:18:07.871 --> 01:18:11.290
crazy mess that could all fall apart.
The,
um,

1385
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:14.680
the idea of this Paleo Diet is a,
to me the most,

1386
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:19.000
it like instantly when I heard about it,
I was like,
oh yeah,

1387
01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:22.360
that makes sense.
You know,
I,
you know,
I,
I follow it.

1388
01:18:22.361 --> 01:18:25.060
I tried the Atkins for a little while and I swear to God,
it was like,

1389
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:29.980
it was one of the worst I've ever felt.
Right.
You know,
I don't know.

1390
01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.440
I think eaten too much gas.
Horrible man.

1391
01:18:32.530 --> 01:18:36.970
My ex girlfriend used to do that and it really kind of pissed me off because it,

1392
01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:39.610
it,
it was not healthy at all.

1393
01:18:39.611 --> 01:18:44.170
Just watching her sit there only eating cheese everyday and bacon fat.

1394
01:18:44.370 --> 01:18:47.140
I'm just like,
come on.
I,
I'm more of a weight watchers person,
but,

1395
01:18:47.150 --> 01:18:50.140
so to me it's like you just need to have a little bit of everything.

1396
01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:54.730
But a good part of the Atkins died to me was that you could eat meat and you can

1397
01:18:54.731 --> 01:18:58.330
eat as much vegetables as you want it to.
Right.
There really is.

1398
01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:01.060
<v 3>Yeah.
And if you have somebody who's like type two diabetic,</v>

1399
01:19:01.090 --> 01:19:04.390
they would benefit a lot from something that looks like an Atkins Diet.

1400
01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:09.160
Like type two diabetes is 100% it's reversible in that you can take somebody

1401
01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:12.670
who's not managing their blood glucose and the Rondo host of drugs and they're

1402
01:19:12.671 --> 01:19:17.080
very likely to die from like a heart attack,
stroke,

1403
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:21.970
cancer,
and if you feed them a ketogenic,
like a moderate protein,
high fat diet,

1404
01:19:22.210 --> 01:19:26.160
you can shift their body's metabolism to run on ketones and they're going to

1405
01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:29.110
live amazingly well and they're not going to,
they're not going to bankrupt,

1406
01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:30.010
you know,

1407
01:19:30.010 --> 01:19:33.100
society because we're spending a bunch of money trying to manage this stuff.

1408
01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:36.670
But for an athlete,
for somebody who's not metabolically broken,

1409
01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:40.900
I just like to steer people more towards like,
you know,
fruits,
veggies,
yams,

1410
01:19:40.901 --> 01:19:41.770
sweet potatoes,
stuff,

1411
01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:44.060
<v 0>dad for the carbs.
When you carb load though,</v>

1412
01:19:44.061 --> 01:19:47.330
do you get the same carb load from fruits and veggies that you would if you were

1413
01:19:47.331 --> 01:19:49.370
eating a giant plate of Pasta,
that's where you use

1414
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:52.440
<v 3>Yammer or a sweet potato or something like that and it's very,
you know,</v>

1415
01:19:52.441 --> 01:19:53.870
it's like a one for wine kind of.
Yeah,

1416
01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:57.860
<v 0>same thing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The Am's are fucking delicious too.
Wow.</v>

1417
01:19:57.890 --> 01:20:00.140
If I were to go for a yam or a plate of Spaghetti,

1418
01:20:00.141 --> 01:20:01.760
I'm going to take that spaghetti.
Yeah.

1419
01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:04.910
Cause its Yummier and I feel like I'm getting away with something when I eat it.

1420
01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:08.070
You know the uh,
the has

1421
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:10.230
<v 2>some opiate like chemicals in it that,</v>

1422
01:20:10.290 --> 01:20:14.460
that stimulate the addiction centers in the brain.
Better does Lasagna.

1423
01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:19.170
That's like heroin.
It's very similar.
Lasagna when you're eating you're like,

1424
01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:23.310
aw shit.
It's like some real low level heroin.

1425
01:20:23.370 --> 01:20:24.540
God Damn.

1426
01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:27.970
I've become addicted to trying to find the best Mac and cheese I've ever,

1427
01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:30.720
every time I go to our restaurant and I'm like damn it,
they have one here.

1428
01:20:30.721 --> 01:20:31.820
I have to get it,
you know,

1429
01:20:31.821 --> 01:20:35.230
have to sterilize this mother fucker's the worst diet of all time.

1430
01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:39.570
I don't have a bad diet.
I just eat macaroni and cheese.
How could that go wrong?

1431
01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:44.520
Eating once a day.
Yeah.
I just eat once a day.
At least two hours in his car.

1432
01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:50.850
How could any of that go wrong?
Not going to go right.
It's not going to go right.

1433
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:54.600
Yeah.
Um,
have you ever thought about like,
uh,

1434
01:20:54.630 --> 01:20:58.740
like working with a big name MMA guys and getting,

1435
01:20:58.770 --> 01:21:00.160
getting together with some,
uh,

1436
01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:03.930
high level fighters and organizing their food and their camps?
Would love to,

1437
01:21:03.931 --> 01:21:07.230
like I've done some consulting for like frank and for forest and stuff like
that.

1438
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:08.700
Frank went from a Vegan Diet,

1439
01:21:08.701 --> 01:21:12.240
I should explain to your diet and had much better results.
He said,

1440
01:21:12.241 --> 01:21:16.290
he said he just really felt listless when he was on a Vegan diet and he said,

1441
01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:18.420
I think it was really nice.
He was joking around about it.

1442
01:21:18.421 --> 01:21:20.260
He was probably doing it wrong because a,

1443
01:21:20.290 --> 01:21:23.820
it was eating so much carbs that is like blood sugar just jacked through the

1444
01:21:23.821 --> 01:21:26.880
roof.
And he was a having an insulin issues,

1445
01:21:27.960 --> 01:21:32.670
eating pasta all the time.
And,
and you see that a lot with folks.
And so I think,

1446
01:21:32.671 --> 01:21:35.520
you know,
if you have a,
somebody eating Vegan and they're doing more like yams,

1447
01:21:35.521 --> 01:21:39.000
sweet potatoes,
fruits for their carbs and they're probably gonna do better.

1448
01:21:39.001 --> 01:21:42.390
But I just don't see people thrive on it.
But yeah,
that would Danzig fights.

1449
01:21:42.391 --> 01:21:45.240
He's a Vegan and he does well.
Does it very well.

1450
01:21:45.241 --> 01:21:49.410
It was a very skilled guy and he's been a vegan forever.
He does a rice protein.

1451
01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:53.120
That's his,
uh,
what he did at least last time I discussed it with him.
But yeah,

1452
01:21:53.130 --> 01:21:56.040
he's a very strict Vegan.
Yeah.
And it,
you know,

1453
01:21:56.070 --> 01:22:00.720
there's also a piece to like the elite athletes seen that there's sometimes not

1454
01:22:00.721 --> 01:22:03.960
the best people to look to for what everybody should be doing.
Beans.
I mean,

1455
01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:09.240
there are guys out there that can eat anything and still succeed.
So it's uh,

1456
01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:12.590
you know,
it's just something to tinker with,
you know,
uh,

1457
01:22:12.690 --> 01:22:16.020
get in and try Vegan for a month.
See how you do,
try Paleo for months.
Yeah.

1458
01:22:16.021 --> 01:22:19.320
You do.
And see which one works for you.
Let me tell you about my retarded theory.

1459
01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:24.120
I think that things that are hard to catch or better for you and that's why I

1460
01:22:24.121 --> 01:22:26.790
think dear is so good for you and elk.

1461
01:22:26.820 --> 01:22:29.490
There's a reason why they're running so fast.
Try to get the fuck away.

1462
01:22:29.491 --> 01:22:32.550
It's because they is set it up so they're hard to get.
Exactly.

1463
01:22:32.551 --> 01:22:37.020
Fish nature set up so they're really hard to catch.
Whereas like cow,

1464
01:22:37.021 --> 01:22:38.240
she could walk right up to account,

1465
01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:40.650
shoot it in the fucking head and the other cows in here,

1466
01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:43.110
the other car was near it.
We were like,
what happened?

1467
01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:46.410
And they'll just keep beating the grass.
Charlie's gone.
Yeah,
they're stupid.

1468
01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:47.910
But even though the delicious,

1469
01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:51.870
it's not as good for you as say elk is like elk is hard to get.

1470
01:22:51.871 --> 01:22:54.090
It's hard to get an elk.
Right.
You know they're out there running around.

1471
01:22:54.091 --> 01:22:54.291
That's a,

1472
01:22:54.291 --> 01:22:58.980
that's a real motherfucker out there living in the wild and you got to go jack

1473
01:22:58.981 --> 01:23:02.760
him almost Vigo fully cave man.
If you've got like a hand thrown sphere,

1474
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:05.950
then you might end up on the business end of,
yeah.

1475
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:08.920
Well do you know that people are actually doing that now?

1476
01:23:08.921 --> 01:23:12.200
That is the latest wave and hunting is spear hunting.
Yeah,

1477
01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:15.970
he booked trying to spear deers and shit.
Good fucking luck.

1478
01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:18.040
You lucky that's recreational motherfucker.

1479
01:23:18.041 --> 01:23:19.580
You're going to starve to death there.

1480
01:23:19.810 --> 01:23:24.610
There's some youtube video of me killing a 650 pound elk with a hand thrown

1481
01:23:24.611 --> 01:23:28.870
spirit.
Holy Shit.
We,
we did a [inaudible] this video,
we'll,
that shit.

1482
01:23:28.930 --> 01:23:32.110
There was a discovery channel show called [inaudible] cave man.
Wow.

1483
01:23:32.111 --> 01:23:36.190
You got trained as caveman and,
and did the shit for,
for like 10 days.

1484
01:23:36.191 --> 01:23:40.990
And where is the show if discovery channel?
A curiosity series.

1485
01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:44.870
What is it on still?
It's still on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's silly.

1486
01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:49.120
There's a new show or is it,
it was last year.
Oh,
so it was like a one off one,

1487
01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:52.810
one episode.
That should be a damn series discovery channel.

1488
01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:56.650
That would be fucking awesome.
It was like they had another one,

1489
01:23:56.680 --> 01:24:00.490
like a Morgan Spurlock hosted the one that we were on and Robin Williams did a

1490
01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:06.070
show on drug use and so they would get people whacked on just a variety of drugs

1491
01:24:06.071 --> 01:24:09.960
and do like a pet scans on their brain to see what was firing and everything.

1492
01:24:09.970 --> 01:24:11.590
Yeah.
And funny enough,

1493
01:24:11.591 --> 01:24:14.500
the Dude Robert who was on the show with me for I cave man,

1494
01:24:14.501 --> 01:24:18.670
he ended up getting picked for the,
uh,
the,
the drug show.
He has a sorted past.

1495
01:24:18.671 --> 01:24:19.870
So it was pretty cool.

1496
01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:23.080
I would think that a show where people would be forced to actually live like a

1497
01:24:23.081 --> 01:24:27.100
caveman would be fascinating to make your own spears and try to make it your own

1498
01:24:27.101 --> 01:24:31.450
bows and arrows and you know,
do you,
you got nothing man.
You're just naked,
right?

1499
01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:32.950
And then when you want to tap out,

1500
01:24:32.951 --> 01:24:35.220
you let us know and you can tap out and you can come back to civilization.

1501
01:24:35.221 --> 01:24:38.020
They gave us clothes,
but we had to learn how to make our own fire,

1502
01:24:38.050 --> 01:24:38.980
make our own tools.

1503
01:24:38.981 --> 01:24:43.120
And there was this guy Billy who was a primitive skills expert and he could
take,

1504
01:24:43.121 --> 01:24:44.140
uh,
uh,
you know,

1505
01:24:44.141 --> 01:24:48.730
big rock start whacking it and then have like a stone knife and like five

1506
01:24:48.731 --> 01:24:49.780
minutes.
He was amazing.

1507
01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:53.770
W I wonder if we could have a show like that where there's a big prize and it's

1508
01:24:53.771 --> 01:24:54.604
like they,

1509
01:24:54.770 --> 01:24:59.440
they have to see like who can live the longest as a caveman?

1510
01:24:59.710 --> 01:25:03.820
And if you could do it,
you get like something crazy,
like 5 million bucks.

1511
01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:07.780
I've had this idea of like the,
you know,
the weight loss show,
but it,

1512
01:25:08.830 --> 01:25:11.950
so you've got people that are living this kind of caveman esque lifestyle.

1513
01:25:11.951 --> 01:25:13.940
They work out and the Paleo and you know,

1514
01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.430
they get put through challenges and stuff,

1515
01:25:15.790 --> 01:25:20.790
but instead of like the punishment would actually be giving them westernized

1516
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:23.260
refined food,
not letting them sleep,

1517
01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:25.420
making them stay up late and play video games.

1518
01:25:25.421 --> 01:25:29.590
So basically the punishment would be living the westernized lifestyle because it

1519
01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:32.620
ultimately say like you have like $1 million prize or something and it's all

1520
01:25:32.621 --> 01:25:35.560
based on like body composition change or weight loss or something.

1521
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:39.730
But if you give them the only food to eat shitty food and you keep them awake

1522
01:25:39.731 --> 01:25:42.040
and you don't let them exercise and they're not going to lose body weight,

1523
01:25:42.370 --> 01:25:43.210
that's a great idea.

1524
01:25:43.211 --> 01:25:46.750
So the punishment is actually living modern life and the only way that you could

1525
01:25:46.751 --> 01:25:48.310
win,
like the people who do it best,

1526
01:25:48.311 --> 01:25:53.060
the way that they win is by actually avoiding the modern scenario.
So if,

1527
01:25:53.061 --> 01:25:54.760
if you can figure out some way to get that thing,

1528
01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:59.740
we'll have people who work out hard and then they get to a certain,
is that it?

1529
01:25:59.770 --> 01:26:02.680
That's it.
They show you killing it.
Yeah.
If you back up a little bit,

1530
01:26:02.681 --> 01:26:04.040
you can see me hugging the,
it's

1531
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:08.660
<v 3>called an Atlatl a little bit more because I think so.</v>

1532
01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:14.030
It depends on,
yeah,
I know.
I guess more bring it all to the beginning.

1533
01:26:14.350 --> 01:26:18.110
This is a,
this is like a teaser.
I think.
Maybe it's not in that one in.

1534
01:26:18.170 --> 01:26:21.770
And if you do this one where somebody recorded the TV.

1535
01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:26.450
<v 2>Yeah.
This will actually show the throw dude.</v>

1536
01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:33.180
Holy Shit.
So that's me with the helmet cam in the outlaws.
Wow.

1537
01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:38.760
We finally right.
Good locations.
So this is on day eight.

1538
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:43.650
We've had no food at all for eight days.
I lost 18 pounds.

1539
01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:48.280
Oh my God.
So you already did this.
You already live later cave man.

1540
01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:53.290
This is crazy.
Yeah,
it was.
It was.
It was something else.
And Bill,

1541
01:26:53.291 --> 01:26:56.750
he's in perfect position.
So this is the guy that's a primitive skills experts.

1542
01:26:56.751 --> 01:27:01.720
Super Cool Dude.
But unfortunately he ministers to bring home some meat.

1543
01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:07.670
<v 4>Rob Is our last chance.</v>

1544
01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.420
The rest of us are just too far away and these elk can spook at any mall.

1545
01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:17.660
It's getting ready to throw in that little dark and I was waiting for the cell

1546
01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:20.510
to turn it so that I have the flank in the neck,

1547
01:27:20.511 --> 01:27:25.040
although men to be ready time just was stopped if felt like the beginning of the

1548
01:27:25.041 --> 01:27:27.800
world and the end of the world and everything's all woven together.

1549
01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:32.780
Got once you got one,
we got one,

1550
01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:37.010
I got into gym and I could just see it rifle and get DLC in the neck.

1551
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:39.160
The tail end of the dark whipped around and that,

1552
01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:41.780
<v 2>oh shit,
sorry.
Kill Shot.</v>

1553
01:27:43.450 --> 01:27:44.380
<v 4>Wow.</v>

1554
01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:49.800
<v 2>The Hertz.
So I'm a total coward.
Jordan.</v>

1555
01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:53.250
<v 3>I knew what we were going to be getting into doing this gig and so I started,</v>

1556
01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:57.300
I made my own that level at home like a month early and I'd spend like explain

1557
01:27:57.301 --> 01:28:01.440
that.
What is it called?
It's a spear throwing device.
It's got a base.

1558
01:28:01.441 --> 01:28:04.320
If you've ever seen highligh where you,
you know,
you throw the ball,

1559
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:05.251
so you've got this,

1560
01:28:05.251 --> 01:28:09.200
this base that gives you some leverage and then you've got a long flexible dark

1561
01:28:09.210 --> 01:28:11.520
that looks like a really flexible uh,
arrow,

1562
01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:16.530
but it's six feet long stone tip on the front and the things,

1563
01:28:17.070 --> 01:28:20.490
what's the show where they,
the warrior versus warrior or whatever,

1564
01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:24.820
like ultimate ultimate.
I was the one that knows the ultimate warrior,
is it?
No,

1565
01:28:24.821 --> 01:28:28.900
it's the one that wasn't it the one?
No,
no,
no.
That was the human weapon.

1566
01:28:29.530 --> 01:28:30.420
But,
but they,

1567
01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:35.280
they checked out an Atlatl on that show and it has as much power as a to 73

1568
01:28:35.490 --> 01:28:39.570
round because of the weight and the velocity you're able to leverage from

1569
01:28:39.571 --> 01:28:43.320
swinging that thing.
How accurate is it?
Not very accurate.
So you can just,

1570
01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:47.970
I practiced or did you actually aimed for that one?

1571
01:28:47.971 --> 01:28:50.820
I ain't for a shoulder and then it went a little high and actually it was a

1572
01:28:50.821 --> 01:28:54.480
better shot than what I was aiming for.
You must have been stoked.

1573
01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:56.640
It was pretty amazing because I hadn't eaten anything.

1574
01:28:56.641 --> 01:29:00.210
And eight days the fuck did you survive after not eating anything for eight
days?

1575
01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:04.800
Dude,
you uh,
I lost 18 pounds.
One thing.

1576
01:29:04.801 --> 01:29:08.960
So you run off your body fat,
have the strike to throw that thing?
Uh,

1577
01:29:09.930 --> 01:29:11.640
yeah.
I mean when we had to,

1578
01:29:11.641 --> 01:29:15.990
we had three more days to go to wrap up the experiment and I like,

1579
01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:19.200
I did not want to quit and,
but I,
it was miserable.

1580
01:29:19.201 --> 01:29:22.830
It was cold that was outside of steamboat springs in Colorado and the nighttime

1581
01:29:22.831 --> 01:29:25.220
temperature was like 28 degrees and you're sleeping more,

1582
01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:26.490
sleeping outside on the ground.

1583
01:29:26.491 --> 01:29:28.950
But we had like a hut that we had built and stuff like that.

1584
01:29:28.951 --> 01:29:32.190
But it was fucking cold starting any fires.
Yeah.
We made a fire.

1585
01:29:32.250 --> 01:29:35.000
Like we had to make a fire with a,
you know,
a hand drill and all

1586
01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:36.560
<v 0>Jesus Christ.
So what,</v>

1587
01:29:36.561 --> 01:29:38.880
how come you guys couldn't find anything to eat for eight days?

1588
01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:42.130
<v 3>Well,
they stuck us up in the mountains because it was beautiful and there was no</v>

1589
01:29:42.131 --> 01:29:46.540
food.
Like all of the anthropologists were on the show were like,
yeah,

1590
01:29:46.541 --> 01:29:50.050
all the native Americans in this area would be 5,000 feet further down the

1591
01:29:50.170 --> 01:29:53.230
mountain.
We were at almost 9,000 feet up the mountain up there.

1592
01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:57.040
There's nothing there.
And it was shot in June.
Yeah.

1593
01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:02.300
<v 0>In June.
At 9,000 feet.
It gets 28 degrees at night.
Yeah.
Mother fucker.</v>

1594
01:30:02.350 --> 01:30:06.610
<v 3>Yeah.
It snowed on us the first night that we were there.
Oh God.</v>

1595
01:30:06.670 --> 01:30:11.290
And June.
Yeah.
Wow,
dude.
It's not la

1596
01:30:11.410 --> 01:30:14.710
<v 0>killed a fucking elk with a spear.
Odd waddle or whatever the hell it is.</v>

1597
01:30:14.711 --> 01:30:18.860
This model,
the model.
That's amazing,
man.
It was pretty cool.
That is pretty cool.

1598
01:30:18.861 --> 01:30:23.060
Elkert incredible animals,
man.
Yeah.
When I went to evergreen,

1599
01:30:23.061 --> 01:30:26.510
there's this crazy photo of a,
the town of immigrant is beautiful.

1600
01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:30.200
You ever been there?
Yeah.
Yeah.
The full town up in the mountains above Denver,

1601
01:30:30.350 --> 01:30:34.910
and there's,
um,
there's this photo and the town's website,
whether it's like,

1602
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:39.530
I don't know,
a hundred elk walking right down the middle of their mainstream,

1603
01:30:39.770 --> 01:30:43.160
completely blocking traffic.
It's like,
Holy Shit.

1604
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:48.550
Like what a cool little piece of nature that these delicious animals wander

1605
01:30:49.761 --> 01:30:52.610
through your whole town and by the hundreds,
you know,

1606
01:30:52.611 --> 01:30:54.410
and then make their way through the forest.

1607
01:30:54.411 --> 01:30:57.170
There's something fucking magical about that,
man.
I mean,

1608
01:30:57.171 --> 01:30:59.480
it sucks a big fat dick when it snows up there.

1609
01:30:59.890 --> 01:31:02.480
Your car is sliding around on the mountain roads and all that.

1610
01:31:02.481 --> 01:31:04.220
That's all terrible.
But man,

1611
01:31:04.221 --> 01:31:08.000
that just the majestic beauty of being in front of a herd of elk and watch them

1612
01:31:08.001 --> 01:31:09.650
walk across the street,
it's like,
wow.

1613
01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:13.740
<v 3>Yeah,
those animals were amazing.
Like they were totally amazing to behold night.</v>

1614
01:31:13.770 --> 01:31:16.890
Like when we were out there,
they would spook and then run away from us,

1615
01:31:16.891 --> 01:31:20.040
but some of the bowls would turn around and it was kind of like,

1616
01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:24.290
that guy is smaller than I.
Yeah.
Like I said,
are you serious?

1617
01:31:24.810 --> 01:31:27.540
<v 0>Apparently we're not used to hunter's.
Otherwise they would have run.
Yep.</v>

1618
01:31:27.670 --> 01:31:29.530
<v 3>Well,
you know where that spot was.</v>

1619
01:31:29.531 --> 01:31:33.040
We were coming up a hill and the sun was coming up behind us and the wind was

1620
01:31:33.041 --> 01:31:36.010
blowing over the elk,
so they couldn't see us yet.
Really?

1621
01:31:36.011 --> 01:31:37.780
Like the sun literally was in their eyes.

1622
01:31:37.781 --> 01:31:40.630
So that was part of the reason why we succeeded that day.

1623
01:31:40.631 --> 01:31:44.350
And then also because it was day eight and we had failed all the other days.

1624
01:31:44.590 --> 01:31:48.370
We only had two camera crew and they were set up like 400 yards away,

1625
01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:52.120
kind of triangulated in on where we were to get a decent shot.

1626
01:31:52.121 --> 01:31:54.460
So the only local camera we had was on my head.

1627
01:31:54.850 --> 01:31:57.970
And that's part of the reason why we succeeded to usually we had like six camera

1628
01:31:57.971 --> 01:31:59.960
guys stomping through block

1629
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.990
<v 2>in the fleet.
Yeah,</v>

1630
01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:04.990
<v 0>yeah.
Ridiculous.
That's not going to work.</v>

1631
01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:08.740
So how many different times did you actually throw that thing and an elk?

1632
01:32:09.310 --> 01:32:12.190
<v 2>I only got two shots off.
So the first one went high,</v>

1633
01:32:12.191 --> 01:32:15.640
which they didn't show in that.
And then my second one hit it same day.
Yeah.

1634
01:32:15.670 --> 01:32:20.080
So there was no time during the other eight days.
We got a shot,
not me,
not me.

1635
01:32:20.530 --> 01:32:22.780
Other people went out and had shots,
but I never,

1636
01:32:22.810 --> 01:32:26.290
I never gotten a position where I,
so no one found any food for the eight days.

1637
01:32:26.291 --> 01:32:29.250
Are Some folks like dandelions?
Um,
we,

1638
01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:34.090
we had lake for trout one day divided up around among 10 people.

1639
01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:38.090
Uh,
so I mean not,
she's not a lot.
Yeah.
There was a mouse.

1640
01:32:38.110 --> 01:32:42.250
You eat the eight a mouse.
Oh,
what the fuck man?

1641
01:32:42.270 --> 01:32:44.520
I cooked it really well just in case.

1642
01:32:44.521 --> 01:32:48.670
It was like dangit fever in it or something.
Yeah.
Fucking mouse.
What is a mouse?

1643
01:32:48.671 --> 01:32:53.170
Tastes like,
uh,
will.
Yeah.
It didn't taste good.

1644
01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:56.380
I don't know.
An analogous tasted,
it just wasn't good.

1645
01:32:56.381 --> 01:32:59.770
I mean it was burnt and you're eating the intestines and you know,

1646
01:32:59.771 --> 01:33:03.190
you're crunching through the skull.
It's too small to gut,

1647
01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:06.660
so you just cook it really well and you just start on the front end and finished

1648
01:33:06.661 --> 01:33:09.880
with a tail end.
Shit.
Yeah.
You just shoot it down.
Bones and all

1649
01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:14.680
mice are pretty fast.
I guess that kills that.

1650
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:17.160
<v 0>Oh my God.
Have you,
uh,</v>

1651
01:33:17.161 --> 01:33:22.161
what is that crazy dish that it's a famous dish where they take little birds and

1652
01:33:23.581 --> 01:33:27.990
they drown them and brandy or the lawn,
what is it called?

1653
01:33:27.991 --> 01:33:31.050
I've never heard of.
I have the,
yeah.
Yeah,
of course.

1654
01:33:31.110 --> 01:33:33.330
My crazy friend Duncan turned me on to this.

1655
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:37.950
He claims that I turned in the him onto it,
but I think he's crazy.
Um,

1656
01:33:38.010 --> 01:33:41.330
but the idea is that they would,
uh,

1657
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:44.520
take these birds and it was like some weird,

1658
01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:50.030
ridiculous delicacy where they would eat it or it,

1659
01:33:50.031 --> 01:33:51.060
alon,
this is what it is.

1660
01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:56.280
A rite of passage for French Gore maize has been eating of the order on these

1661
01:33:56.281 --> 01:34:01.281
tiny birds captured alive force fed and then drowned in our mug.

1662
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:06.210
Armagnac I guess it's the type of cognac or something like that were roasted

1663
01:34:06.211 --> 01:34:07.680
hole and eaten that way.

1664
01:34:07.681 --> 01:34:12.510
Bones and all while the diner draped his head with a linen Napkin to preserve

1665
01:34:12.511 --> 01:34:16.320
the precious aromas and some believe to hide from God.

1666
01:34:17.850 --> 01:34:22.560
Whoa.
Sorry.
Barbaric.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What the fuck?

1667
01:34:23.010 --> 01:34:25.230
That's a weird way to eat an animal.
I mean,

1668
01:34:25.231 --> 01:34:29.460
how did they figure out how to make a delicious over feed it and then drown it

1669
01:34:29.461 --> 01:34:33.570
in,
in the burbs and booze?
What a weird animal.

1670
01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:36.130
It sounds like a mafia hit.
Well,

1671
01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:40.020
the idea is you wear a hood over your head while you eat it to get the aromas.

1672
01:34:40.590 --> 01:34:44.820
Like,
Whoa,
that's fucked.
That's just fucking weird.
Leave it.
Is that the French?

1673
01:34:44.850 --> 01:34:45.670
Of course.
Yeah.

1674
01:34:45.670 --> 01:34:49.800
Naturally the creepy one of those crazy ideas about drowning birds,

1675
01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:56.010
don't they make Flog Raul?
So which is force feeding.
Delicious.
Yeah.
More.

1676
01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:58.070
Yeah.
More.
But that shit's

1677
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:00.280
<v 2>really good,
right?
Yeah.</v>

1678
01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:03.330
It's illegal now in California,
right?

1679
01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:06.740
You can bring your own flog raw to the restaurant and they'll cook it for you.

1680
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:10.400
Oh really?
They can't buy it.
Yeah.
That's so silly.
So now you've,

1681
01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:12.470
which is another one,
these market deals.

1682
01:35:12.710 --> 01:35:15.740
So you took something that was regulated,
people kept track of it.

1683
01:35:15.741 --> 01:35:17.570
There was some standards and some hygiene.

1684
01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:21.950
And so now you've driven it into a black market deal where black market,

1685
01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:25.220
and by the way,
it's not like they're running out of goose.

1686
01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:28.520
We're trying to protect the goose.
You can kill the fucking shit out of goose.

1687
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:31.160
Right?
He's,
you can kill them all day long and nobody cares.

1688
01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:34.250
You just can't inflame their livers.
Right where he killed them.

1689
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:35.840
You have to be nice to them.
Meanwhile,

1690
01:35:35.841 --> 01:35:38.120
if you ever see like one of those feeding tubes where they force feed them,

1691
01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:41.630
they hang out near that.
They want to get force fed.

1692
01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:43.490
Like if they don't have Gagic instincts,

1693
01:35:43.491 --> 01:35:46.070
they just know when that thing goes in their mouth and their full right.

1694
01:35:46.130 --> 01:35:50.510
You know,
we're just,
we're so,
so weird with our,
what we allow,
what we don't like.

1695
01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:51.920
You still allow veal,

1696
01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:55.580
like veal seems to me way crueler than a couple of seconds getting forced fed

1697
01:35:55.581 --> 01:36:00.580
with some grain.
No,
veal is a tricky thing or just jersey shore.
So,
yeah,

1698
01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:05.470
I mean that seems inhumane to so what do you do if you do eat veal?
I,

1699
01:36:05.950 --> 01:36:08.090
I,
if it's there,
I do.
But I mean it's not,

1700
01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:10.910
it's not something you ever think about how creepy it is.
It's pretty creepy.

1701
01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:13.730
It's pretty creepy.
Just like,
I mean it's like Coby beef,
you know,

1702
01:36:13.731 --> 01:36:16.850
it's all rubbed and massage and you know,
uh,
uh,

1703
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:20.120
milk fed and everything and Colby fit.
Kobe beef is like,

1704
01:36:20.121 --> 01:36:24.200
don't they feed it alcohol at this Joe Penis?

1705
01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:27.560
Oh,
well that's,
that's so crazy.

1706
01:36:27.561 --> 01:36:31.760
What they're like connecting human beings to animals,
like force feeding it.

1707
01:36:31.761 --> 01:36:35.240
And it's always quite high sexual kind of thing going on.
I look,
she's got like,

1708
01:36:35.241 --> 01:36:39.620
her lipstick is running and they're so silly.
They're like all extremists,

1709
01:36:39.621 --> 01:36:43.820
they're silly.
It's,
you know.
Yup.
And one of them will probably kill me some day.

1710
01:36:43.821 --> 01:36:46.210
So because you killed that elk with,
uh,
with,
uh,

1711
01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:50.630
even more so now get hate mail after you did that.
Not Hate Mail,

1712
01:36:50.631 --> 01:36:54.530
but there was some hate tweeting and a,
yeah.
And there was a set of,
you know,

1713
01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:57.500
yeah.
And there was a woman who was at that,
people are upset.
I mean,

1714
01:36:57.501 --> 01:36:59.810
while they're probably meat eaters,
you know,

1715
01:36:59.811 --> 01:37:03.290
the funny thing is there was a woman who was a cartoonist who is a mediator,

1716
01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:07.670
but thought that it was appalling that I hunted in animal.
And I was Kinda like,

1717
01:37:07.671 --> 01:37:11.870
okay.
So it's not like I was sitting,
you know,

1718
01:37:11.871 --> 01:37:15.950
a quarter mile away with a sniper scope.
Like I was out on my feet.

1719
01:37:15.951 --> 01:37:20.390
This animal could have stomped me into a bloody mess too.

1720
01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:24.890
So it's about as equal an exchange as you're going to get doubts,
some real shit.

1721
01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:29.930
You went to war with an animal with some shit you made,
right?
Right.
Yeah.

1722
01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:33.200
No,
I think you win.
I think that lady can shut her fucking hole.

1723
01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:37.630
Shut your hole lady silly next Tuesday.
It's so dumb.

1724
01:37:38.440 --> 01:37:41.300
It's so dumb.
If you eat meat,
if you actually eat me,

1725
01:37:41.310 --> 01:37:45.920
would you prefer the or pig to be stuffed into some fucking crazy container and

1726
01:37:45.921 --> 01:37:49.700
live its life and its own shit until it finally gets slaughtered?
You know?

1727
01:37:49.701 --> 01:37:53.630
Is that,
is that somehow or another better play?
Some role and yeah,

1728
01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:56.610
it's so weird the,
we're the strangest

1729
01:37:56.610 --> 01:37:59.770
<v 0>animal with this anti hunting,
but pro meet thing,
right?</v>

1730
01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:02.070
It's like you not going to stop people from eating me.

1731
01:38:02.071 --> 01:38:04.170
You could go crazy pita all you want.

1732
01:38:04.210 --> 01:38:08.670
You go crazy Vegan all you want for a lot of people that's blah,
blah,
blah.

1733
01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:09.840
In and out as delicious.

1734
01:38:09.870 --> 01:38:14.040
You know like barbecue is too fucking good taste too.

1735
01:38:14.041 --> 01:38:16.890
God damn good.
A real good ribeye.

1736
01:38:17.010 --> 01:38:19.740
Medium rare over mesquite calls.

1737
01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:23.910
Shut your fucking mouth with your keen Wa.
It's not as good.
I'm sorry.

1738
01:38:23.911 --> 01:38:26.520
It's just not,
it's not and that's why they're,

1739
01:38:26.521 --> 01:38:29.760
the vegans are always trying to make fake meat.
Yeah,
they're silly.

1740
01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:34.620
So fake chicken and Chili that the Tofurky.
The thing about it is like,

1741
01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:38.070
yeah,
it seems like we should evolve past that.

1742
01:38:38.250 --> 01:38:41.790
It seems like we shouldn't be about cruelty and we seems like we shouldn't be,

1743
01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:44.810
but what is,
what is the least cruel thing?

1744
01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:48.540
Lee's cruel thing is to have an animal live its whole life completely wild and

1745
01:38:48.541 --> 01:38:51.360
free.
They'd take it out with a bullet,
right,
and then no,

1746
01:38:51.361 --> 01:38:54.030
it doesn't know what the fuck is going on.
It just hears a,

1747
01:38:54.031 --> 01:38:58.800
a branch snap and Stein one through the heart and that's a wrap son.

1748
01:38:58.801 --> 01:39:00.240
I mean that's a,
that's a quick death.

1749
01:39:00.270 --> 01:39:02.820
That is a lot better than a cow living on a farm.

1750
01:39:02.910 --> 01:39:05.940
Yet people have a problem with people hunting and they don't have a problem

1751
01:39:05.950 --> 01:39:09.030
eating at Burger King.
Right.
That's,
that is strange.

1752
01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:12.390
People were strange.
We get really weird one.

1753
01:39:12.391 --> 01:39:16.980
Once we got agriculture and we've got the ability to have a surplus and we got

1754
01:39:16.981 --> 01:39:18.180
the ability to store things.

1755
01:39:19.130 --> 01:39:23.090
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean it starts,
I think when you were still running farms,</v>

1756
01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:26.000
you were still tied into food because you had to go out and kill your food.

1757
01:39:26.001 --> 01:39:30.710
And like you,
you know,
there was a little more tied to it.
But,
um,
you know,

1758
01:39:30.711 --> 01:39:34.400
when you walk into a grocery store and kids really don't understand that plants

1759
01:39:34.401 --> 01:39:38.510
grow in the dirt,
you know,
that,
you know,
that corner,
you know,

1760
01:39:38.511 --> 01:39:40.700
an apple or whatever grew from a plant that's in the dirt.

1761
01:39:40.701 --> 01:39:42.080
They don't even realize that.

1762
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:45.410
And then when you go to the meet deal and you understand what's involved with

1763
01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:50.030
killing and processing an animal,
like it's pretty gruesome shit.
You know,

1764
01:39:50.031 --> 01:39:53.270
it's no joke.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
It's no joke.

1765
01:39:53.570 --> 01:39:57.320
<v 0>Do we have to be concerned with the lack of minerals in the top soil?
You know,</v>

1766
01:39:57.321 --> 01:40:00.890
I've,
I've read,
uh,
people have,
uh,

1767
01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:04.460
discussed whether or not it's healthy to be trying to replenish them with

1768
01:40:04.461 --> 01:40:08.120
chemicals and whether or not they're supposed to be like a natural cycle of like

1769
01:40:08.150 --> 01:40:12.290
leaving certain areas alone for awhile and then planting them in the future.

1770
01:40:12.610 --> 01:40:17.270
Could I answer that after taking a leak?
Yeah.
I saw you turning.
I,

1771
01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:21.140
I saw him go through that door and uh,

1772
01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:25.940
the last door on the left notice ladies and gentlemen,

1773
01:40:25.941 --> 01:40:27.680
how strong my bladder is.

1774
01:40:28.220 --> 01:40:30.950
<v 1>Yeah.
It's not good for you to have a strong bottle.</v>

1775
01:40:31.220 --> 01:40:32.330
I used to hold it all the time.

1776
01:40:32.331 --> 01:40:35.840
Now I tried to go and needs the second I feel like,
oh,
I might have to pee.

1777
01:40:35.841 --> 01:40:40.590
I tried to go because I used to hold it for long periods of time,
but my bladder,

1778
01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:43.220
it doesn't hurt me now,
but it doesn't bother me if he could,

1779
01:40:43.221 --> 01:40:44.510
if he do that over time,

1780
01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:48.500
you're going to have hard time holding your pen when you get older.
Yeah.

1781
01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:51.650
<v 0>Dude,
when I have a hard time holding my pee and quick here,</v>

1782
01:40:52.770 --> 01:40:53.710
I'm not down with that.

1783
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:57.360
<v 1>But I don't,
I don't agree with that.
I think,
you know,
it's silly.
No,
I see.</v>

1784
01:40:57.380 --> 01:41:00.820
Never heard that before.
No.
If it bothered me a lot,
I would go pee.
Yeah.

1785
01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:04.840
But it's not really,
I can just hold it longer.
I drink a lot of water too.

1786
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:08.320
Maybe it's,
I'm used to it.
Maybe have a more stretched out bladder.
No,

1787
01:41:08.321 --> 01:41:11.310
I mean I could totally just could never pee all day.

1788
01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:14.350
I could be once a day if I wanted to.
I think only once a day.

1789
01:41:14.380 --> 01:41:18.340
I used to hold my pee a lot cause I had jobs that I worked at Louis C K at a

1790
01:41:18.341 --> 01:41:22.270
funny bit.
You Ever Hold Your pee because you're just so bored.

1791
01:41:23.650 --> 01:41:27.970
He wants to concentrate on something.
I forget the actual joke,
but it's so true.

1792
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:32.710
So bored to just wholly and your P
pan.

1793
01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:37.610
Tomorrow's a podcast with uh,
Maynard is going to be ridiculous to me.

1794
01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:39.850
I wonder if he's going to bring some of those wine.
I want to try it.

1795
01:41:40.450 --> 01:41:43.840
I find that amazing.
I think that is just one of the most

1796
01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:48.850
original things that are our rock stars ever done.
You know,

1797
01:41:48.851 --> 01:41:52.390
call him a rock star musician.
Artist just decides to become a winemaker.

1798
01:41:52.510 --> 01:41:55.880
I think that's amazing.
I'm really,
I love the idea behind it.
Just hides it,

1799
01:41:55.881 --> 01:41:59.290
you know,
but growing it on his own farm,
it's a small operation.

1800
01:41:59.650 --> 01:42:01.840
They grow the grapes,
the whole thing,
the whole process.

1801
01:42:01.841 --> 01:42:04.620
I think that's amazing man.
I'm really,
really interested with,

1802
01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:05.980
I don't know if I talked about this,

1803
01:42:05.981 --> 01:42:10.981
about a Francis Ford Coppola's daughter Sophie Sophie's Copa.

1804
01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:16.750
Her wine company is pretty cool what she's doing with it.

1805
01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:21.880
She's doing something that,
uh,
that I think is pretty unique and I,
I'm actually,

1806
01:42:22.190 --> 01:42:24.440
um,
I'm on board 100%.
He,
uh,

1807
01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:28.420
she's sewing little portable wine in cans,

1808
01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:30.460
like cake pop cans and they're like,

1809
01:42:30.461 --> 01:42:33.370
like the small cokes if you're by the smoke coke cans,

1810
01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:36.430
they're like a Gnat or that she has this other one where it's like this little

1811
01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:41.460
little wine glass that just has a peel off a thing and it has like a resealable

1812
01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:46.930
lid for it and it's just like completely like the opposite of what you're

1813
01:42:46.931 --> 01:42:49.780
supposed to drink wine and he's supposed to be and get the high end like wine.

1814
01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:54.610
It's like a new version of portable box wines and her father Francis Ford

1815
01:42:54.610 --> 01:42:57.010
Coppola,
doesn't he have a vineyard?
It's like a very famous vineyard.

1816
01:42:57.490 --> 01:42:59.590
That's where she,
she's doing her own thing.

1817
01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:02.980
I don't know if it's at the same vineyard or not,
but that's kind of,

1818
01:43:03.070 --> 01:43:06.980
that's kind of smart.
But she does everything.
Her Dad.
Yeah,
that

1819
01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:08.390
<v 2>does.
That's a good mood.</v>

1820
01:43:08.391 --> 01:43:11.450
And Your Dad's Francis Ford motherfucking Coppola and you can do whatever you

1821
01:43:11.451 --> 01:43:15.260
want.
Yeah.
I want to make some portable wine bitch.
Yeah.

1822
01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:17.790
When you look at the economy and everything,

1823
01:43:17.810 --> 01:43:22.460
I mean instead of driving towards the top end,
then you make some cheap,
you know,

1824
01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:26.090
box wine style stuff,
but then a different delivery deal.
Yeah,
totally.
Yeah.

1825
01:43:26.091 --> 01:43:28.940
For a lot of people there's not that much difference between the $30 bottle of

1826
01:43:28.941 --> 01:43:32.120
wine,
a $5 bottle of wine.
Right.
You know,
especially after the first bottle.

1827
01:43:32.121 --> 01:43:34.340
So yeah,
especially at the first few sips.

1828
01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:36.200
If you're a Somalia and you're hammered,

1829
01:43:36.201 --> 01:43:38.360
you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Let's be honest.

1830
01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:41.270
How bad his alcohol for you?
Uh,

1831
01:43:41.930 --> 01:43:45.620
I mean it poisons all into the dose.
So I mean,

1832
01:43:45.621 --> 01:43:49.100
I have a couple of drinks a day and,
and you know,

1833
01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:53.330
not too bad and I stick more with like nor Margarita is just like Tequila.

1834
01:43:53.570 --> 01:43:58.280
Couple drinks every day.
Yeah.
You really,
you're an animal.
You don't give a fuck.

1835
01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:00.710
It's wild.
It's crazy.
Health and nutrition.

1836
01:44:00.711 --> 01:44:05.270
He drinking a two drinks a day probably.
Yeah.
Yeah,
one to two.
Yeah.

1837
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:08.660
But it's no big deal.
I don't think that that's all that big a deal.

1838
01:44:08.661 --> 01:44:11.660
If I was in training camp for something,
then I would ditch it.
Obviously,

1839
01:44:11.661 --> 01:44:16.580
you know,
you need to tighten stuff up,
but if you're doing,
you know,
six,

1840
01:44:16.581 --> 01:44:19.610
eight drinks a night or you know,
multiple times a week,

1841
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:23.600
obviously that's a problem.
So I mean it's just kind of a dose response curve,

1842
01:44:23.630 --> 01:44:26.240
you know,
if you're on that,
if you're a a dude,

1843
01:44:26.241 --> 01:44:28.480
then you can probably get away with a drink or two a day and it's,

1844
01:44:28.490 --> 01:44:32.840
it probably helpful in the long run.
But um,
for,
for a female,

1845
01:44:32.841 --> 01:44:34.910
a little bit less than that,
but how is it helpful?

1846
01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:39.770
Is it helpful because you're relax gives you have the drink.
I said helpful.

1847
01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:43.180
Is there anything in,
I think it's that stuff,
you know,
you relax.

1848
01:44:43.181 --> 01:44:46.140
There's usually some socialization that goes on.
Uh,

1849
01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:48.320
there's some stuff in the alcohol.

1850
01:44:48.530 --> 01:44:51.320
It's interesting like just being exposed to a stress.

1851
01:44:51.321 --> 01:44:54.950
There's this process called hormesis where like when you exercise,

1852
01:44:54.951 --> 01:44:59.780
you get some damage to the muscles or to the cardiovascular system and your body

1853
01:44:59.781 --> 01:45:00.800
needs to adapt to that.

1854
01:45:00.801 --> 01:45:04.850
And it's actually the process of adapting that's good for you and alcohol causes

1855
01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:08.420
some damage to the body that then it needs to respond to and there's some kind

1856
01:45:08.421 --> 01:45:12.560
of beneficial elements to that.
I had a crazy idea when I was younger.

1857
01:45:12.561 --> 01:45:15.290
It's a stupid idea,
but it was like if you smoke cigarettes,

1858
01:45:15.291 --> 01:45:17.150
maybe they make your lung stronger.

1859
01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:20.440
Who they have to fight off the cigarette smoke.
I really did this,

1860
01:45:20.441 --> 01:45:23.210
I to quit when you're about 40.
When I was wrestling,

1861
01:45:23.211 --> 01:45:26.180
one of the best kids on our wrestling team was a smoker and I always worried

1862
01:45:26.181 --> 01:45:30.100
about that.
That's Sophia's little one kind of selling it,
you know,

1863
01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:34.610
like a can of beer,
like a hand job.
All you're saying is her hand in the water.

1864
01:45:34.611 --> 01:45:39.110
You're thinking slippery.
Why are we outside?
You're jerking me off.

1865
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:43.970
Stop.
You shouldn't do this is your dad's house.

1866
01:45:45.110 --> 01:45:47.140
She can't afford Francis Ford Coppola's house.
No less.

1867
01:45:47.141 --> 01:45:51.140
So he says Christ people are watching.
It must be cameras.
Yeah.
Um,

1868
01:45:51.141 --> 01:45:53.850
so one or two drinks a day.
No problem.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1869
01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:58.880
And I would steer low right now
because no one ever hears that.

1870
01:45:58.881 --> 01:46:03.190
Everyone here is alcohol is terrible for you and it's not,
I mean they,
you know,

1871
01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:05.120
they tried to demonize a lot of stuff,

1872
01:46:05.121 --> 01:46:08.240
whether it's red meat or booze or whatever,
like because um,
you know,

1873
01:46:08.241 --> 01:46:13.100
like the gluten free deal and I love beer,
but beer is loaded with gluten,

1874
01:46:13.101 --> 01:46:18.050
so like can you do that?
So I don't drink beer.
Margarita Margarita is,

1875
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:21.800
and I've been doing site or like after we spent some time in northern Europe,

1876
01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:25.130
like they do some amazing siders.
So I do some of that stuff.

1877
01:46:25.131 --> 01:46:26.150
So I'm wondering if it's,

1878
01:46:26.570 --> 01:46:30.590
I get a real weird heavy feeling from beer that I don't get from other things

1879
01:46:30.591 --> 01:46:34.640
when I want to have a,
a couple of glasses of whiskey,
I get it little,

1880
01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:38.150
I get drunk but I don't get deli.
The bloat.
Yeah.

1881
01:46:38.151 --> 01:46:42.500
You never drink light beers though.
You always drink like the Heineken Sam Adams.

1882
01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:45.500
Well yeah.
I mean dark beer is really the only way to go,

1883
01:46:45.501 --> 01:46:50.170
but it's got the most kind of gnarly stuff in it too.
Guinness.
Yeah.

1884
01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:53.250
God,
I love that stuff.
A lot of bad shit in there though.
And half.

1885
01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:58.110
Not good for you.
Oh,
hey,
you guys want some half and half?
So I go get one.

1886
01:46:58.590 --> 01:47:02.010
You to get one right now.
Yeah.
All right.
Go get some drugs.
We'll do it.
Fuck it.

1887
01:47:02.610 --> 01:47:04.100
Like,
uh,
some,

1888
01:47:04.110 --> 01:47:07.230
something with clear booze or something like this on it gets on with clear

1889
01:47:07.231 --> 01:47:11.280
Buddhists.
Okay.
Is the bar open?
I don't know what time is five 15?

1890
01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:13.020
Maybe the fuck are you doing?

1891
01:47:13.021 --> 01:47:17.580
You promising shit you can't deliver if I can get so,
um,
so what about coffee?

1892
01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:22.620
Dig Coffee.
Yeah.
And uh,
when you look at the epidemiology,

1893
01:47:22.621 --> 01:47:26.190
probably the more you drink,
the better.
Some people or you drink.
Yeah,

1894
01:47:26.191 --> 01:47:28.680
I mean it's like three,
four cups a day.

1895
01:47:28.860 --> 01:47:32.880
Now the problem is that usually people don't drink espresso or straight coffee.

1896
01:47:32.881 --> 01:47:35.840
They usually dumping a bunch of sugar in it.
So that's kind of the,

1897
01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:38.320
the caveat with it.
But uh,

1898
01:47:38.650 --> 01:47:43.560
it decreases diabetes rates there.
Yo,
you just drank your diabetes away.
Yeah,

1899
01:47:43.710 --> 01:47:45.450
yeah.
Really elucidate what,

1900
01:47:45.451 --> 01:47:49.200
say that again about diabetes decreases diabetes rate decreases cardiovascular

1901
01:47:49.201 --> 01:47:52.910
disease rates.
Like it's good.
It's good stuff.
Wow.
Yeah.

1902
01:47:53.070 --> 01:47:54.840
But now let's take that,

1903
01:47:54.841 --> 01:47:58.860
let's say you're a police or firefighter and you're working night shift and

1904
01:47:58.861 --> 01:48:03.390
you're working out like crazy and you're using caffeine to like drive a

1905
01:48:03.391 --> 01:48:07.110
lifestyle that is totally over the top.
Then it's not necessarily good.

1906
01:48:07.111 --> 01:48:10.650
It's going to,
it's going to get into some adrenal fatigue.
Your adrenals are the,

1907
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:12.070
you know the hormones.

1908
01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:16.200
It released cortisol and it deals with stress and you can completely bombed that

1909
01:48:16.201 --> 01:48:20.550
whole system out and then you can drop testosterone levels and drop your immune

1910
01:48:20.551 --> 01:48:22.350
function.
When that friend of mine,

1911
01:48:22.351 --> 01:48:26.580
he quit coffee for that very reason is adrenal started failing.
Right?
Right.

1912
01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:28.650
So you can overdo it in that regard,

1913
01:48:28.651 --> 01:48:33.630
but it's kind of like lifestyle plus bad lifestyle plus too much coffee is bad,

1914
01:48:33.631 --> 01:48:37.680
but if you have a lifestyle that's a little bit more sedate,

1915
01:48:37.681 --> 01:48:39.480
like when we go on vacation,

1916
01:48:39.481 --> 01:48:42.930
I can drink coffee all day long and it doesn't phase me when I'm working and

1917
01:48:42.931 --> 01:48:45.720
I've got deadlines and stuff and they've got that base level of stress,

1918
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:47.250
then I can't do much coffee.

1919
01:48:47.670 --> 01:48:50.700
That's interim steps a day because that's when a lot of people would think that

1920
01:48:50.701 --> 01:48:53.550
you would need it.
You're stressed out,
you need do you need some energy,

1921
01:48:53.551 --> 01:48:57.510
then you take the coffee.
But yeah,
I,
that's when you could overdo it.

1922
01:48:57.540 --> 01:48:59.610
Interesting thing like if you,
uh,
uh,

1923
01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:04.640
for more cognitive type stuff like writing or trying to do creative work doing

1924
01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:10.770
nicotine gum.
Yeah.
I've heard of that.
Yeah.
That's crazy.
It's amazing.

1925
01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:13.950
That's one of the things that a Steven King said he missed about smoking.

1926
01:49:13.951 --> 01:49:17.190
He said the synaptic responses when he was writing it would be like much

1927
01:49:17.191 --> 01:49:21.300
improved with,
with cigarettes.
Yeah.
And the Nikki,
the big,

1928
01:49:21.301 --> 01:49:22.900
that's the right way to say it's an haptic response.

1929
01:49:22.901 --> 01:49:27.540
Is that what's going on when you writing and making connections and ideas,

1930
01:49:27.810 --> 01:49:31.590
creativity and nicotine gum can make you creative.
Yeah.
And,

1931
01:49:31.610 --> 01:49:36.150
and like there's good studies showing that a nicotine is preventative against

1932
01:49:36.151 --> 01:49:39.630
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's is be good for your heart too,
right?
Yeah.

1933
01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:42.300
That's ridiculous.
But you've got to remove the delivery system,

1934
01:49:42.301 --> 01:49:43.380
which is tobacco well,

1935
01:49:43.381 --> 01:49:48.090
which is 590 different chemicals jammed in addition to that stuff.
Yeah,

1936
01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:52.900
<v 0>yeah.
I did a thing once.
Uh,
it's me and my friend Adam Ferrara,
he,</v>

1937
01:49:52.901 --> 01:49:55.300
he used to smoke cigarettes.
I don't know if he still does.

1938
01:49:55.630 --> 01:50:00.490
He's a comedian and that a TV show,
um,
a top gear.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1939
01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:04.990
We did a thing together a long time ago was this play thing and I had to play

1940
01:50:04.991 --> 01:50:06.900
this a poet who was like,

1941
01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:11.350
like completely full of himself and smoked all day and smoked like a Frenchman

1942
01:50:11.570 --> 01:50:12.403
smoke backwards.

1943
01:50:12.670 --> 01:50:16.450
And I only smoked like four or five cigarettes while we were rehearsing this day

1944
01:50:16.630 --> 01:50:19.780
and I had to quit.
I said,
I can't do this part.
I can't do it,
man.

1945
01:50:19.810 --> 01:50:22.780
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
Right?
Like I can't smoke a cigarette.

1946
01:50:22.781 --> 01:50:25.090
Like the whole thing was I'm supposed to be smoking the whole time.
Like,

1947
01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:27.700
how the fuck do you guys do this?
Like this is nuts.

1948
01:50:27.970 --> 01:50:30.720
Like you're poisoning the shit.
Like I felt like I was becoming a vampire,

1949
01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:34.420
like felt that taking over me.
I'm like,
no,
no,
no,
no.
You got to take these back.

1950
01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:37.300
What a,
what a madness,
you know?

1951
01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:40.740
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean,
when you look at tobacco,
like when,</v>

1952
01:50:40.770 --> 01:50:44.700
when ever it hit somewhere it spreads fast and it sticks pretty hard.

1953
01:50:44.750 --> 01:50:47.690
<v 0>Well,
the real,
the real man,
this is how many people fucking die from it.</v>

1954
01:50:47.691 --> 01:50:49.460
And yet it's still so prevalent.

1955
01:50:49.461 --> 01:50:53.690
And even amongst young people in 2012 the Internet out there,

1956
01:50:53.691 --> 01:50:54.381
for whatever reason,

1957
01:50:54.381 --> 01:50:59.120
there's this weird romantic pull towards self destruction through use of

1958
01:50:59.121 --> 01:51:01.520
tobacco.
It's really fucking strange too.

1959
01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:07.430
<v 2>You have a read a Malcolm Gladwell's books was his,</v>

1960
01:51:07.431 --> 01:51:10.010
the tipping point.
I think it was the tipping point,
but he,

1961
01:51:10.250 --> 01:51:15.200
he talked about the fact that if you tried to demonize something and make it not

1962
01:51:15.201 --> 01:51:19.700
cool,
that kids are going to gravitate towards it even course.
Course.

1963
01:51:19.970 --> 01:51:23.390
Course.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,
anything their parents don't want him to do,

1964
01:51:23.420 --> 01:51:24.350
get the fuck away

1965
01:51:24.430 --> 01:51:27.630
<v 0>for me.
They just want to like stop telling me what to do.
You Cock sucker.
Right.</v>

1966
01:51:27.750 --> 01:51:31.750
Give me that cigarette.
Oh my dad's an asshole.
Yeah.
That's what it is.
Yeah.

1967
01:51:31.810 --> 01:51:33.490
But that hopefully can be avoided.

1968
01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:37.590
<v 2>Sorry,
the bar was closed so I couldn't get any clear drinks.
No problem.</v>

1969
01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:41.460
No problem.
But I have vodka on ice if you want that.
Yeah,
I get do.

1970
01:51:41.461 --> 01:51:45.510
Otherwise it's only us drinking.
I'm going to drink this Guinness with pride now.

1971
01:51:45.511 --> 01:51:50.070
No one.
It's actually good for me.
Sort of.
Kind of,
but not the wheat.
Yeah.

1972
01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:54.530
If we could figure out some way to make it without wheat or barley,
it's just,

1973
01:51:54.610 --> 01:51:55.380
just shitty for your

1974
01:51:55.380 --> 01:51:58.860
<v 0>Rodney.
What is the best alcohol?
Is there a better alcoholic drink?</v>

1975
01:51:58.910 --> 01:52:03.670
<v 2>Just anything clear like by clear Tequila,
whiskey,
whiskey.
Whiskey is clear.
Yeah.</v>

1976
01:52:03.740 --> 01:52:08.720
I mean it just,
you know,
I mean,
uh,
it doesn't have sugar.
It doesn't have gluten.

1977
01:52:08.721 --> 01:52:12.620
So holy cat.
Wow.
What does that in there?

1978
01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:17.630
That's a whole lot of vodka.
Vodka trying to get them fucked up,
man.

1979
01:52:19.150 --> 01:52:23.360
Um,
does marijuana have any adverse effects on performance?
Yeah.

1980
01:52:23.361 --> 01:52:25.820
I mean it's going to impact lung function to some degree.

1981
01:52:26.210 --> 01:52:28.550
If you really go to town on marijuana,

1982
01:52:28.610 --> 01:52:32.930
it's got enough of a phyto estrogenic effect that you can suppress testosterone.

1983
01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:38.030
Like that old wives' tale about dudes growing tits because they smoke too much

1984
01:52:38.031 --> 01:52:42.520
weed.
Is that like their diet?
It's became dry hits Kenya,
you can't grow tits.

1985
01:52:42.970 --> 01:52:46.310
You can,
you can suppress testosterone.
How much do you have to be smoking

1986
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:50.830
<v 3>and do that smoke a lot.
I mean,
yeah,
you've got to go soon.
Yeah.</v>

1987
01:52:51.090 --> 01:52:53.330
But you know,
it pots and other,

1988
01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:56.600
it's interesting winning contrasted with say like tobacco,

1989
01:52:56.601 --> 01:53:00.380
you don't see the same type of uh,
uh,
emphysema.

1990
01:53:00.381 --> 01:53:03.890
You don't see the same type of like carcinogenic effects even though you've got

1991
01:53:03.891 --> 01:53:07.170
all,
I mean you're creating a ton of different chemicals.
Um,

1992
01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:10.760
when you burn something,
you make these things polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,

1993
01:53:10.761 --> 01:53:14.810
these particles that get in between DNA and can cause problems.

1994
01:53:15.170 --> 01:53:18.560
When you look at the research on marijuana and you should just don't see the

1995
01:53:18.561 --> 01:53:23.120
same types of things pop popping up now for a,
a hard charging athlete,

1996
01:53:23.150 --> 01:53:27.050
I think that you would probably be better off if you want to have a relaxing

1997
01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:29.150
evening,
like making some brownies or something like that.

1998
01:53:29.151 --> 01:53:33.410
Like the delivery system is going to change the effects a lot for sure.
Well,

1999
01:53:33.411 --> 01:53:37.880
the delivery delivery system changes the effects but is also vaporizing,

2000
01:53:38.090 --> 01:53:41.600
which is the same sort of delivery system,
very similar delivery system,

2001
01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:45.990
but you're just getting like the THC vapor and you're not getting all the other

2002
01:53:46.010 --> 01:53:48.470
goodies.
Yeah.
All the Birch Shit,
right.

2003
01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:52.130
They say that marijuana smoke is actually an expectorant and it's good for

2004
01:53:52.131 --> 01:53:54.380
cleaning out lungs.
Like if you've got some shit and your lungs,

2005
01:53:54.381 --> 01:53:57.320
he smoked some weed,
but that could just be pot talk.
Um,

2006
01:53:57.470 --> 01:54:01.200
there's some stuff like Mullen also,
which is used for that.
Hey,

2007
01:54:01.210 --> 01:54:04.850
I could see that to some degree,
but what is Mullen?
It,
it's uh,

2008
01:54:06.540 --> 01:54:09.170
it's uh,
actually a North American herb,

2009
01:54:09.171 --> 01:54:12.950
like traditional native American kind of medicine and stuff like that.

2010
01:54:13.250 --> 01:54:17.960
We'd have some other benefits,
but yeah,

2011
01:54:17.961 --> 01:54:22.100
it's,
it's,
uh,
in folklore it's used as an expectorant as well.

2012
01:54:22.670 --> 01:54:27.670
Now what about like Advil and Ibuprofen and nonsteroidal antiinflammatories or

2013
01:54:27.981 --> 01:54:31.970
those dangerous for your bond?
They're super dangerous.
Real,
Eh,
each year,

2014
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.520
thousands of people,
I don't know,
like,
uh,
uh,

2015
01:54:35.090 --> 01:54:37.880
it'd be easy to do a doctor Google on that,
but to see,
you know,

2016
01:54:37.881 --> 01:54:41.390
how many deaths there are each year due to a insights,

2017
01:54:41.391 --> 01:54:43.910
nonsteroidal anti inflammatory overdoses.

2018
01:54:43.950 --> 01:54:48.620
And there's some really fucked up stuff like,
uh,
with um,
Vicodin.

2019
01:54:49.170 --> 01:54:54.170
They pair Vikatin with Acetaminophen Tylenol with the express purpose so that

2020
01:54:54.981 --> 01:54:59.540
people don't take more of it to get like a narcotic effect because it will cause

2021
01:54:59.541 --> 01:55:03.980
liver damage.
And there are thousands of people that ended up dying,
but you know,

2022
01:55:04.010 --> 01:55:06.740
inadvertently because they may have a drink and then they take some Vicodin,

2023
01:55:06.741 --> 01:55:08.060
which are not really supposed to do,

2024
01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:11.620
but the Acetaminophen makes the whole thing so much more toxic.
Like they're,

2025
01:55:11.621 --> 01:55:16.340
they're literally killing people and to know better effect versus taking let you

2026
01:55:16.341 --> 01:55:18.560
know,
if somebody has some legitimate pain,

2027
01:55:18.590 --> 01:55:21.380
just taking some opiates is going to be really powerful on that.

2028
01:55:21.710 --> 01:55:24.500
May Not want to stay on that forever because this stuff's super addictive and

2029
01:55:24.501 --> 01:55:29.480
has all kinds of other side effects.
But a lot of our,
our kind of drugs policy,

2030
01:55:29.481 --> 01:55:30.920
even on the Orthodox,

2031
01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:35.450
you know over the counter side is really goofy and the stuff is,
is dangerous.

2032
01:55:35.451 --> 01:55:38.060
Like there are a lot of people who will work out,
get sore,

2033
01:55:38.061 --> 01:55:41.880
take ensades to go work out again,
it ends aids,

2034
01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:46.800
nonsteroidal inflammatories and it's,
it's bad on a lot of levels.
One of them,

2035
01:55:46.830 --> 01:55:50.430
you know,
I mentioned the horn nieces before,
like the adaptation to exercise.

2036
01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:53.790
If you take insides in conjunction with exercise,

2037
01:55:53.791 --> 01:55:56.550
you're blocking some of the adaptation.
So it's that same thing.

2038
01:55:56.551 --> 01:55:59.130
It's kind of like,
you know,
exercising and in missing sleep,

2039
01:55:59.131 --> 01:56:03.900
like you're not going to adapt to the exercise the way that you want to have a

2040
01:56:03.901 --> 01:56:07.540
backache and you take Ibuprofen,
you're actually fucking yourself.
[inaudible]

2041
01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:11.670
you're fucking yourself out of some potential healing.
Yeah.
It,
you know,

2042
01:56:11.671 --> 01:56:14.370
but it's tough to say.
Like I,
I tweaked my back a number of years ago.

2043
01:56:14.371 --> 01:56:18.060
I used to compete in powerlifting and one time I did something wrong,

2044
01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:21.870
my SEI joint got tweaked and like I couldn't stand up.
Like I was totally,

2045
01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:24.150
you know,
bent over sideways,
twist it up.

2046
01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:27.780
And so taking some Ibuprofen then can relax the muscles a little bit.

2047
01:56:27.781 --> 01:56:31.950
It brings the inflammation down,
but use it in acute fashion.
You use it for like,

2048
01:56:32.130 --> 01:56:36.690
you know,
a day or two for a specific problem instead of what folks do,

2049
01:56:36.691 --> 01:56:39.810
which is basically staying on it continuously so that

2050
01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:43.290
<v 0>those people are fucking themselves.
They're,
yeah.
You're poisoning yourself.
Yeah.</v>

2051
01:56:43.590 --> 01:56:47.640
What about for athletes?
Is there a negative effect of it that is shown in camps?

2052
01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:53.320
<v 3>There's problems with not huge increase tendon ruptures because the tendons</v>

2053
01:56:54.141 --> 01:56:57.050
don't heal,
decreases cardiac output.

2054
01:56:57.051 --> 01:57:00.110
So there's a lot of reasons for not using it and for just,
you know,

2055
01:57:00.111 --> 01:57:01.250
like taking some fish oil,

2056
01:57:01.251 --> 01:57:04.370
getting your vitamin D levels up by either being out in the sun or supplementing

2057
01:57:04.371 --> 01:57:08.840
with vitamin D smart training.
Periodizing your training a little bit,
you know,

2058
01:57:08.841 --> 01:57:10.220
stuff like that.
Yeah.

2059
01:57:11.030 --> 01:57:14.450
<v 0>I've never heard that Ibuprofen was so bad.
That's so important.</v>

2060
01:57:14.510 --> 01:57:18.740
It's such a important information.
I had always felt like it can't be good,

2061
01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:21.650
but I didn't,
I had no idea it was that bad.
It's really,
yeah,

2062
01:57:22.250 --> 01:57:25.900
<v 3>it's,
you know,
it's very powerful for like an acute injury.</v>

2063
01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:26.980
So you tweak your back,

2064
01:57:26.981 --> 01:57:29.980
your roll an ankle or something and it really suppresses inflammation very

2065
01:57:29.981 --> 01:57:33.910
powerfully.
So use it then and use it then only,
yeah.
Yeah.
Use It,
you know,

2066
01:57:33.911 --> 01:57:35.470
like one dose to try to knock him.

2067
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:38.650
<v 0>So when people,
you know,
and people say,
oh,
I have a headache,</v>

2068
01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:41.890
give me those things.
They just pop them all the time.
Horrible idea.
Okay.
Yeah.

2069
01:57:42.010 --> 01:57:44.870
Very important.
I have a lot of friends who could benefit from that information.

2070
01:57:44.890 --> 01:57:49.330
Yeah.
Um,
what should you take when you have inflammation?
Is there any sort of a,

2071
01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:54.340
a dietary remedy or is there anything that you could replace Ibuprofen with

2072
01:57:55.011 --> 01:57:58.670
that's a good anti inflammatory that's actually beneficial or healthy fish oil

2073
01:57:58.671 --> 01:58:00.530
and vitamin D,
just keeping those levels,

2074
01:58:00.531 --> 01:58:04.760
those two fish oil really does work for folks who don't know if you've ever had

2075
01:58:04.761 --> 01:58:08.360
joint pain and Jujitsu,
a lot of guys get elbow pain.

2076
01:58:08.361 --> 01:58:11.780
You're always like fighting off armbars and Camorra's and stuff and your,

2077
01:58:11.781 --> 01:58:13.040
your joint can tweak the law.

2078
01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:16.820
And that cranks fish oil makes a fucking tremendous difference.

2079
01:58:16.821 --> 01:58:20.810
A real difference between me walking around and no pain or me walking around

2080
01:58:20.811 --> 01:58:23.990
like,
Eh,
what's that?
You know,
it really feel a difference.
I mean,

2081
01:58:23.991 --> 01:58:26.390
it sounds crazy that you're actually like lubing your joints,

2082
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:28.430
but that really is what's going on.

2083
01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:32.490
<v 3>Yeah.
And you get a lot of mileage out of fish oil.
Vitamin D is really,</v>

2084
01:58:32.491 --> 01:58:34.320
really important.
And how much official,

2085
01:58:34.321 --> 01:58:37.440
I should just take it day two to four grams,
which isn't a ton,

2086
01:58:37.590 --> 01:58:38.920
but you know Graham,

2087
01:58:38.930 --> 01:58:43.540
<v 0>so when you have a milligram,
you should take 10 of those were 100 milligrams.</v>

2088
01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:48.490
1,000 milligrams has a gram.
Right?
So 10 that's what I take.
I take 10 a day,

2089
01:58:48.491 --> 01:58:53.250
10 of the 100 milligrams.
Oh really?
Okay.
So they must be really smart.

2090
01:58:53.251 --> 01:58:56.980
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So that's gonna be like one gram.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2091
01:58:57.190 --> 01:59:00.420
You take two grams.
Yeah.
Wow.
You're an animal.
But

2092
01:59:02.660 --> 01:59:07.360
I had cancer,
a thousand milligrams.
I bet they're one brand.
So if they are,

2093
01:59:07.361 --> 01:59:11.470
then it's how many for two to four the land planning each,

2094
01:59:11.740 --> 01:59:15.580
but for a thousand milligrams.
How many?
One gram.
Oh it is one grand.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2095
01:59:15.670 --> 01:59:18.220
Well I'm going off dude,
cause I'm,
I'm taking 10 of those.

2096
01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:21.030
You travel a lot and stuff.
You're probably,
it's probably good.
Yeah.

2097
01:59:21.070 --> 01:59:23.650
Makes a difference man.
When I don't do it,
it sounds ridiculous.

2098
01:59:23.651 --> 01:59:25.990
I take five in the morning and five at night,
but when I don't do it,

2099
01:59:25.991 --> 01:59:29.260
I feel a difference.
Take it with food though,
right?
Always.
Yeah.
Cool.
Um,

2100
01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:32.710
something that I do that I just incorporate it because someone told me that you

2101
01:59:32.711 --> 01:59:35.110
said this,
I don't even know if you really said this,
but I,

2102
01:59:35.111 --> 01:59:38.500
I have a Kale shake every morning and I start incorporating some fat into it.

2103
01:59:38.650 --> 01:59:42.200
Oh yeah.
To uh,
to absorb the vitamins better.
Is that what it is?
Yeah,

2104
01:59:42.460 --> 01:59:44.770
I use coconut oil.
Is that good?
That's great.
Yeah,

2105
01:59:44.771 --> 01:59:48.700
because I'm still not a fan of shakes usually,
but yeah,
it tastes like dog shit.

2106
01:59:48.701 --> 01:59:51.250
But I eat a man,
some bacon and eggs.
Nope.

2107
01:59:53.570 --> 01:59:56.230
Big Nights.
It's just as good.
And you like Kale shake?
I do.

2108
01:59:56.380 --> 02:00:00.490
I liked the way it makes me feel.
Man.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
It's one thing when I,

2109
02:00:00.520 --> 02:00:05.520
when I blend like a Kale and cucumber and I use a big chunk of 'em,

2110
02:00:05.690 --> 02:00:08.740
uh,
ginger and four or five cloves of garlic.

2111
02:00:08.741 --> 02:00:11.740
I've been going with five lately and then pineapples,

2112
02:00:11.741 --> 02:00:15.490
but the new fruit I used to use pairs and then the coconut oil and I'm telling

2113
02:00:15.491 --> 02:00:18.790
you,
man,
it's so rich.
It's feels so ridiculously nutritious.

2114
02:00:18.940 --> 02:00:20.830
Like right when I eat it,
my body's like,
whoa.

2115
02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:24.910
First of all the garlic and the ginger alone just makes your whole body whoa.

2116
02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:29.130
It's like sends a message like,
Holy Shit,
we were delivering some legs.

2117
02:00:29.140 --> 02:00:31.240
It's open book.
I tried to make it Joe.

2118
02:00:31.250 --> 02:00:35.410
I couldn't do a keynote as good a man when it comes to know terrible,

2119
02:00:35.411 --> 02:00:36.244
disgusting Shit.

2120
02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:41.680
I ginger and it was just too fiqh and duty your poop though.
Oh my God.

2121
02:00:41.681 --> 02:00:44.860
I've never been,
I've never enjoyed pooping more in my life.

2122
02:00:44.890 --> 02:00:47.150
It's like it becomes a,
it would be epic.

2123
02:00:47.230 --> 02:00:50.650
You would be like a goose yourself at that point comes in an event.
Yeah,

2124
02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:53.560
because I eat normally at night,
but that's how I start off every day.

2125
02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:57.640
I started doing this because of,
uh,
Kevin James,

2126
02:00:57.850 --> 02:01:00.400
Kevin James did this movie called,
uh,
here comes the boom.

2127
02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:02.560
We plays an MMA fighter,
comes out in October,

2128
02:01:02.561 --> 02:01:06.010
and he lost 80 pounds for this movie.
And the way he lost it was by,

2129
02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:10.270
he went on a totally Vegan Diet.
Um,
and he,
the first thing he did every day,

2130
02:01:10.271 --> 02:01:14.830
but he had a chef prepare him food all day long while he was in training for

2131
02:01:14.831 --> 02:01:17.790
this movie.
So he didn't have to make any choice in it.

2132
02:01:17.791 --> 02:01:21.130
It was all in front of them.
This is what you need for dinner.
Here's your snack.

2133
02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:24.160
Everything is so food was just falling off them.

2134
02:01:24.161 --> 02:01:26.920
But the beginning of every day is a Kale shake.
And he's like,

2135
02:01:26.921 --> 02:01:30.610
you got to just choke it down.
The benefits of it that are spectacular.
You don't,

2136
02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:31.510
you don't agree with that.

2137
02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:35.200
I would go more for like bacon and eggs and a double espresso.

2138
02:01:35.550 --> 02:01:39.980
It sounds awesome.
I love this guy is changing every,
I'm going back.
You know

2139
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:44.180
<v 2>that Waca protein just releases a bunch of dopamine in the brain.
You're happy,</v>

2140
02:01:44.181 --> 02:01:46.790
you're centered,
you're focus.
The,
the,
uh,

2141
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:52.040
the caffeine releases dopamine.
So like Bacon and coffee,
when you feel alone,

2142
02:01:52.041 --> 02:01:55.850
eggs and coffee is good.
When you feel love,
like you look,
tell you,
Joe,

2143
02:01:55.851 --> 02:01:56.870
I've been doing a little bit longer.

2144
02:01:56.930 --> 02:01:59.660
Look into your wife's size and you feel loved.
You're feeling dopamine.

2145
02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:04.430
And so like Bacon and coffee release dopamine,
so bacon and coffee or love.

2146
02:02:04.610 --> 02:02:08.150
So that's incredible.
Bacon and coffee are love.

2147
02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:10.370
It totally makes sense why they're so delicious.

2148
02:02:10.490 --> 02:02:13.640
Like there's an emotional connection to them as with chocolate.
Right,
right,

2149
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:16.310
right.
There's an emotional connection to the foods as well.

2150
02:02:16.610 --> 02:02:21.170
Bacon and coffee or lunch it,
try one month of Bacon,

2151
02:02:21.171 --> 02:02:25.460
eggs and coffee and then try one month of Kale shake and let me know.

2152
02:02:25.490 --> 02:02:29.120
But doesn't the Kale shake or isn't like the nutrients?
Like really important?

2153
02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:31.610
Like the,
the,
the nutrients you get from cal shakes.

2154
02:02:32.030 --> 02:02:35.160
I mean they make me feel great.
I fucking love it.
I mean,

2155
02:02:36.030 --> 02:02:38.840
I'm going to keep eating it for the pooky alone.
Give it a whirl.
Give,

2156
02:02:38.841 --> 02:02:41.120
give it a chip.
It,
try it out for one month.
But I mean,

2157
02:02:41.121 --> 02:02:43.250
you don't need all those vitamins.
And the Kale,

2158
02:02:43.251 --> 02:02:46.400
you don't need all those vitamins and the salary and the cucumber and the
garlic.

2159
02:02:46.670 --> 02:02:50.440
All Great.
But I mean,
you could,
you could get that with a salad later and,

2160
02:02:50.441 --> 02:02:54.220
and you know,
it's like if you got some good,
yeah,
really?
Yeah.

2161
02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:56.840
So it's sort of some salad,
olive oil,

2162
02:02:57.100 --> 02:03:01.850
giant bundle of vegetables ground down to like a liquid,
right?

2163
02:03:02.450 --> 02:03:06.890
I'm not like benefiting myself and having all those extra nutrients you are,

2164
02:03:06.891 --> 02:03:10.340
but it's so the fact that you put coconut oil in there as good because a lot of

2165
02:03:10.341 --> 02:03:14.120
people make all that stuff low fat and a lot of the fido chemicals,

2166
02:03:14.121 --> 02:03:17.840
a lot of the antioxidants only dissolve in fat.
So when you put that,

2167
02:03:17.860 --> 02:03:21.170
it's kind of like doing an exome,
but just a regular salad is not good enough.

2168
02:03:21.171 --> 02:03:24.770
You have to have some like a good like ranch dressing or something or olive oil

2169
02:03:24.771 --> 02:03:28.460
or something.
Yeah.
You'd have to blue cheese dressing out with wings

2170
02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:32.790
that absorbs more nutrients out of the wings.
Um,

2171
02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:36.860
so you really do need some fat with you in your dressing if you want to absorb

2172
02:03:36.861 --> 02:03:40.220
all the nutrients of your salad.
That's amazing.
Yeah.
Because people will say,

2173
02:03:40.221 --> 02:03:44.060
I want the low fat,
low fat and low fat that they're not getting nutrition.

2174
02:03:44.061 --> 02:03:45.950
All the nutrients are just shooshing in and out.

2175
02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:47.390
And like before I had to take a leak,

2176
02:03:47.391 --> 02:03:50.590
you asked me about like minerals and stuff like that.
It's uh,

2177
02:03:51.010 --> 02:03:55.430
a bunch of the things that you would normally be able to get out of food is it,

2178
02:03:55.490 --> 02:03:58.790
you know,
it's enhanced the way you absorb it if you have some fat with it,

2179
02:03:59.390 --> 02:04:02.510
that's amazing.
So when people just eat a regular salad,

2180
02:04:02.511 --> 02:04:05.780
just straight lettuce and greens,
you're really fucking yourself.

2181
02:04:05.781 --> 02:04:07.940
You really should have something,
you should have something with it.

2182
02:04:07.941 --> 02:04:12.830
Either eats chicken,
something,
something fatty,
she needs something fat.

2183
02:04:13.070 --> 02:04:15.350
So if you're Vegan,
then you would throw some almond butter in it.

2184
02:04:15.351 --> 02:04:17.750
You'd have some coconut oil in it or something like that.

2185
02:04:17.751 --> 02:04:20.510
And if you just eat vitamins on their own,
it's useless.

2186
02:04:20.511 --> 02:04:23.420
Like just raw vitamins on an empty stomach doesn't really work.

2187
02:04:23.450 --> 02:04:26.630
You don't absorb them as well and like what percentage you think you would

2188
02:04:26.631 --> 02:04:27.920
absorb?
Gosh,

2189
02:04:28.390 --> 02:04:33.390
is there still turns fluorescent so I mean you're still absorbing it with that

2190
02:04:33.981 --> 02:04:34.371
regard,

2191
02:04:34.371 --> 02:04:37.830
but the vitamins definitely works synergistically with a lot of the products and

2192
02:04:37.831 --> 02:04:42.470
food.
So I think it's Saturday is taken so you'll get some sort of an effect.

2193
02:04:42.471 --> 02:04:45.460
Have you taken on an empty stomach but a very mineralized yeah,

2194
02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:49.230
and you know much less effect stomach upset.
Yeah,
it'd be one that's a big known.

2195
02:04:49.290 --> 02:04:50.880
Yeah.
I will not hard pills.

2196
02:04:50.881 --> 02:04:54.370
Especially like compact and multivitamins or something like that.
A little weird.

2197
02:04:54.380 --> 02:04:55.420
Yeah.
You might be facing a,

2198
02:04:56.030 --> 02:05:00.600
wouldn't Knutsen salad be better than say ranch dressing full on rat ranch

2199
02:05:00.601 --> 02:05:04.810
dressing?
You know nursing is delicious specially with Beijing.
Yeah.

2200
02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:06.510
Well this mother fucker is trying to lose weight though.

2201
02:05:07.050 --> 02:05:11.610
He doesn't want that ranch dressing
that's high in fat.

2202
02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:17.790
Raw nuts especially,
right?
Yeah,
because you tend not to overeat them.

2203
02:05:17.850 --> 02:05:20.670
It's that palatability thing again.
So if you roast them and salt them,

2204
02:05:20.671 --> 02:05:24.150
they taste better and you can eat right.
You go off.
Yeah,
that's true.

2205
02:05:24.151 --> 02:05:27.900
I don't eat raw almonds nearly.
It's like as much as those loves ones,

2206
02:05:27.901 --> 02:05:30.590
when they're smokey Joe,
smokey,
Ahmond's,
whatever.

2207
02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:33.610
I don't know what that smokey shit is.
It's,
it's yum.

2208
02:05:34.150 --> 02:05:36.240
Smokey y'all good for you man.

2209
02:05:37.140 --> 02:05:40.530
So there's no need for cal shakes.
Is this what you're telling me?

2210
02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:45.120
Cause I've been,
I've been living off this.
It's you like it definitely go for it.

2211
02:05:45.121 --> 02:05:50.010
But you know,
I,
I think some of the mixed green,
um,
you know,

2212
02:05:50.011 --> 02:05:54.000
foods can be kind of cool,
but it said,
dude just walked in.

2213
02:05:54.720 --> 02:05:57.360
Why don't you lock the door son?
Shit's ridiculous.

2214
02:05:59.370 --> 02:06:04.140
Somebody just walked in.
We have a non-secure studio.
Oops.
Normally,

2215
02:06:04.141 --> 02:06:08.580
always secure.
Um,
so,
so you don't need all those nutrients.

2216
02:06:08.581 --> 02:06:12.060
And how much vegetable nutrients do you need in a day if you are,

2217
02:06:12.061 --> 02:06:15.090
if you're going to eat like bacon and eggs for breakfast,
now here's the deal,

2218
02:06:15.091 --> 02:06:18.350
like bacon and eggs for breakfast because people usually wine about,
you know,

2219
02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:22.300
I don't have time.
I,
you know,
I need to get stuff done quickly.
So I,

2220
02:06:22.430 --> 02:06:26.310
I call it like the meat and nuts breakfast where it's basically like some eggs

2221
02:06:26.311 --> 02:06:30.390
and bacon.
So you know like some Turkey with some almonds or something like that.

2222
02:06:30.690 --> 02:06:34.960
So it's quick,
it's easy.
You get a dose of dopamine,
you get,
you know,

2223
02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:37.500
your hormones kind of balance going right out of the gate.

2224
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:39.180
If someone is a hard charging athlete,

2225
02:06:39.181 --> 02:06:41.010
they're probably going to need throw some carbs in it.

2226
02:06:41.010 --> 02:06:44.490
I'm just saying like general.
So if you're going to work out later in the day,

2227
02:06:44.580 --> 02:06:48.210
you might want to start with like some fruit or like some yams or sweet potatoes

2228
02:06:48.211 --> 02:06:51.090
or or something like that with this.
But that first meal,

2229
02:06:51.091 --> 02:06:55.780
if you make it mainly protein and fat,
you have good rock,
solid energy level.
Um,

2230
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:59.190
I usually train it noon.
Like if I'm able to get into Jira to at noon,

2231
02:06:59.191 --> 02:07:02.400
then I eat it either one or two.
And so I'll eat lunch then.

2232
02:07:02.430 --> 02:07:05.100
So I usually do like that.
So what do you do for breakfast?

2233
02:07:05.250 --> 02:07:09.960
Breakfast is usually bacon and eggs over when you go train a couple hours later,

2234
02:07:09.961 --> 02:07:13.890
four hours later I train with carbs.
And they can and post workout.

2235
02:07:13.950 --> 02:07:16.440
I eat like a giant sweet potato,

2236
02:07:16.441 --> 02:07:20.520
like mega sweet potato with some protein and I've got some veggies.

2237
02:07:20.760 --> 02:07:25.760
And then my dinner is a little bit of protein with like a metric ton of veggies

2238
02:07:26.191 --> 02:07:27.024
and then some fat.

2239
02:07:27.240 --> 02:07:31.680
So like I'm doing like a boatload of like cooked veggies or like a salad or

2240
02:07:31.681 --> 02:07:32.370
something.

2241
02:07:32.370 --> 02:07:35.890
So I'm getting all the veggies kind of at the end of the day with a bunch of
fat.

2242
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:37.810
<v 3>I'm streamlining my,
my breakfast,</v>

2243
02:07:37.811 --> 02:07:40.950
but I'm getting enough protein in the morning so that my energy level is good,

2244
02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:42.640
my blood sugar is good and all that stuff.

2245
02:07:42.970 --> 02:07:46.510
And then I'm recovering from training by doing some post workout carbs and say

2246
02:07:46.511 --> 02:07:48.250
like if I'm doing,
when I start doing jets,

2247
02:07:48.251 --> 02:07:51.040
cause I'm old now and just beat down and everything,

2248
02:07:51.370 --> 02:07:52.690
I'm not really doing much else.

2249
02:07:52.691 --> 02:07:55.000
I might lift weights a little bit or do a little gymnastics,

2250
02:07:55.240 --> 02:07:58.930
but I'm not really needing a lot of glycogen repletion between workouts.

2251
02:07:59.170 --> 02:08:01.720
But if he had somebody that was doing multiple sessions a day,

2252
02:08:01.930 --> 02:08:05.710
then you just start doing more carb repletion feet.
So you know,

2253
02:08:05.711 --> 02:08:09.730
breakfast would be protein and yams and sweet potatoes and fruit.

2254
02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:13.870
So you throw down the carbs based on what your kind of,

2255
02:08:13.871 --> 02:08:15.210
what glycogen you're burning and your

2256
02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:16.073
<v 0>workouts.</v>

2257
02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:20.220
I've never heard anybody advocate bacon and eggs for breakfast with with coffee.

2258
02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:24.320
Sounds like a heaven.
It seems too good to be true man.
What about potato?

2259
02:08:24.321 --> 02:08:27.080
So there are the good,
bad,
great post workout,

2260
02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:29.990
post workout because you're the carbon sugar.

2261
02:08:30.490 --> 02:08:35.430
Yeah but but not good just as a meal.
Not Good.

2262
02:08:35.431 --> 02:08:39.120
Like you eating dinner with steak and potatoes,
the potatoes not right.

2263
02:08:39.630 --> 02:08:43.660
What is it?
What is wrong with potato as opposed to like sweet potato,
you know,

2264
02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:47.190
any hyber less nutrients.
But you know

2265
02:08:47.580 --> 02:08:49.950
<v 3>again it's a little bit specific to the person.</v>

2266
02:08:49.951 --> 02:08:53.070
Somebody like you that's lean and athletic and doing a lot of activity.

2267
02:08:53.340 --> 02:08:57.570
Then for dinner,
a piece of meat with a baked potato or a sweet potato,

2268
02:08:57.571 --> 02:09:00.610
that's fine because you,
you've got the activity level where you need that,

2269
02:09:00.611 --> 02:09:03.790
that level of carbon.
Take somebody that's trying to lose some weight and they,

2270
02:09:03.791 --> 02:09:07.420
maybe I have some insulin dysregulation,
like their blood sugars go high and low.

2271
02:09:07.421 --> 02:09:08.730
Their insulin goes high and low.

2272
02:09:09.180 --> 02:09:11.460
They would probably be better off not having that.

2273
02:09:11.490 --> 02:09:16.290
So it's a folks want to paint like a kind of a one size fits all picture,

2274
02:09:16.291 --> 02:09:18.030
but it's very specific.
You know,
it's like,

2275
02:09:18.031 --> 02:09:20.850
are we talking about a metabolically broken type two diabetic?

2276
02:09:20.870 --> 02:09:24.260
Are we talking about an athlete?
Are we talking about just kind of,
uh,
uh,

2277
02:09:24.270 --> 02:09:27.540
recreationally active stay at home mom?
You know,

2278
02:09:27.541 --> 02:09:31.890
so it's really important to consider who we talking about.
What are their goals,

2279
02:09:31.891 --> 02:09:33.000
what are they working towards?

2280
02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:36.120
And that will steer the boat both with regards to their training and also their

2281
02:09:36.121 --> 02:09:36.954
nutrition.

2282
02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:39.190
<v 0>Yeah.
I've also,
I've always felt that with,</v>

2283
02:09:39.220 --> 02:09:43.770
with athletics that there's a reason why when you have a heavy weightlifting

2284
02:09:43.780 --> 02:09:47.440
workout,
you crave meat.
I mean,
it's,
it's a very distinct craving.

2285
02:09:47.441 --> 02:09:48.580
If you are a meat eater,
if you're,

2286
02:09:48.581 --> 02:09:52.420
the type of person eats meat when you work out right away,

2287
02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:55.960
like right when it's over,
you want to fucking steak,
I want a burger.

2288
02:09:55.961 --> 02:09:59.590
You want some,
your body's saying give me some meat bitch.
Right,
right.

2289
02:09:59.740 --> 02:10:02.980
It's probably an instinct that,
I mean your,
your,
your,

2290
02:10:02.981 --> 02:10:05.900
your muscles in your body are probably sending a message,
right?

2291
02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:11.020
<v 3>Yeah.
It's a great way to stabilize your blood sugar,
eat some protein.</v>

2292
02:10:11.140 --> 02:10:15.580
And that is going to be a slow release glucose into your system because your

2293
02:10:15.581 --> 02:10:18.190
body can convert the amino acids into glucose.

2294
02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:21.130
Like kind of the ideal thing is like a pretty good whack of protein with a

2295
02:10:21.131 --> 02:10:23.740
little bit of carbs.
Should you just keep things nights.

2296
02:10:23.910 --> 02:10:25.750
<v 0>Did you not drink water while you eat?</v>

2297
02:10:27.090 --> 02:10:31.310
<v 3>It's not a bad idea and it's a little bit lunatic fringe but uh,</v>

2298
02:10:31.370 --> 02:10:35.240
you dilute the digestive a little bit and I think that you probably have better

2299
02:10:35.241 --> 02:10:38.870
digestion without,
you know,
liquids during the meal.

2300
02:10:38.900 --> 02:10:43.400
So like in part of it too,
you notice when people drink liquid with their meal,

2301
02:10:43.610 --> 02:10:46.460
they just kind of gum there food once or twice and then they take some water and

2302
02:10:46.461 --> 02:10:50.910
like shoot it down and the eyes bulge because it's like a python swallowing like

2303
02:10:50.940 --> 02:10:54.860
a swamp rat or something is true.
People chew less.
We're so lazy,

2304
02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:59.060
we'd rather drink water with it to shut down.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2305
02:10:59.540 --> 02:11:01.250
People are so fucking stupid.

2306
02:11:03.020 --> 02:11:07.460
So it's better to not have water with it and to chew your food up really well.

2307
02:11:07.490 --> 02:11:09.110
Totally.
When you wake up.
No.

2308
02:11:09.111 --> 02:11:11.870
A Mike Dolce says you wake up and she'd have like eight ounces of water before

2309
02:11:11.871 --> 02:11:16.220
you do anything.
Just look at smart.
Yeah.
I mean more and more than that.

2310
02:11:16.250 --> 02:11:18.700
And I'm what to do during a day.
You know,

2311
02:11:18.940 --> 02:11:23.280
when I get up I usually do almost a quarter of water.
I actually,
yeah,

2312
02:11:23.900 --> 02:11:28.610
I do maybe half of it,
you know,
in a pretty good shot.
Uh,
yeah cause it,
it,

2313
02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:33.500
that stimulates the digestive stuff.
So I'll do that.
I'll get hot.

2314
02:11:33.890 --> 02:11:37.040
Not Super Hot.
I mean it just,
just one.
So it's not like,
you know,

2315
02:11:37.041 --> 02:11:40.040
frozen cold because I'm getting it out of the filter out of the fridge.

2316
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:42.950
I'll pop it in the microwave and heat it up just a little bit,
you know,

2317
02:11:42.951 --> 02:11:46.370
so it's like room temperature or something.
So I'll do half of that.

2318
02:11:46.630 --> 02:11:49.790
Like immediately I'll go sit down on the computers,
start checking email.

2319
02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:53.780
I've got a stove top espresso maker where I've got coffee that starts brewing.

2320
02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:55.790
I've got a timer for that.
That's six minutes.

2321
02:11:55.791 --> 02:11:58.280
Usually I finish the water within like six to 10 minutes.

2322
02:11:58.610 --> 02:12:00.470
And then I throw my bacon on my grill,

2323
02:12:00.471 --> 02:12:05.150
which I grill it really low temperature long time,
like 200 degrees.
Slow,

2324
02:12:05.151 --> 02:12:09.320
slow grilled Navajo Grill Bacon.
Yeah.
Why do you do that?
Amazing.

2325
02:12:09.740 --> 02:12:12.260
It is amazing.
He Bacon everyday.

2326
02:12:13.070 --> 02:12:15.260
Not Everyday but I mean a lot of days but you know,

2327
02:12:15.261 --> 02:12:19.310
all go through a terror where I have bacon a lot and then I won't have it for

2328
02:12:19.311 --> 02:12:22.640
two months,
three months.
Like I'll,
I'll just be like,
oh,
I'm over it and I'm done.

2329
02:12:23.090 --> 02:12:28.070
Yeah.
So just slow grilling over Ligo,
irregular grill liquid.
It's electric grill,

2330
02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:30.230
you know,
like nonstick deal and,
and uh,

2331
02:12:30.290 --> 02:12:34.340
I just put it on 200 and it's slow grills for like two hours and it just makes

2332
02:12:34.341 --> 02:12:38.280
it so amazing to our bacon.
Yeah,
that's like a fetish type.

2333
02:12:39.230 --> 02:12:43.190
Sounds like heaven.
The how?
It's like burning incense.
It's

2334
02:12:44.850 --> 02:12:47.360
on my mind in so many ways on this show.

2335
02:12:48.170 --> 02:12:52.010
I just had blood work done for life insurance.
I'm 40 years old,

2336
02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:55.940
New York life did like the full deal,
like crawled up my who hot,
you know,

2337
02:12:55.941 --> 02:13:00.590
all the blood work and everything and I be,
I have the blood work parameters,

2338
02:13:00.591 --> 02:13:04.010
the bio parameters of somebody who's 28 years old.
So like,

2339
02:13:04.011 --> 02:13:07.810
and they gave me a perfect,
you know,
health score,
they,

2340
02:13:07.811 --> 02:13:11.210
they've never had a 40 year old male with as good a biomarkers is.

2341
02:13:11.211 --> 02:13:12.510
That's incredible.
Yeah.

2342
02:13:12.550 --> 02:13:16.070
And I was talking to their underwriter about the whole Paleo thing and I'm like,

2343
02:13:16.730 --> 02:13:21.080
yeah,
because the,
the one thing they dinged me on,
I'm five,
975 pounds.

2344
02:13:21.081 --> 02:13:23.850
And so according to their charts,
I was overweight and I was like,
well,

2345
02:13:23.851 --> 02:13:26.570
I'd lift weights and I'm reasonably lane and I shot him pictures and everything

2346
02:13:26.571 --> 02:13:29.480
and the guy's like,
okay,
that's cool.
That's hilarious that,
that,

2347
02:13:29.481 --> 02:13:32.450
that's such a stupid way of out if someone's at the way.

2348
02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:36.790
<v 2>Yeah.
So stupid.
Yeah.
It's like,
it's just saying,
Nah,</v>

2349
02:13:36.791 --> 02:13:40.020
there's no variables.
Right.
It's right.
It's ridiculous.

2350
02:13:40.021 --> 02:13:43.440
And it being 180 pounds and five nine is equal.

2351
02:13:43.441 --> 02:13:47.890
Whether you lift weights or where you are overweight.
I'm eat Twinkies.
It's so,

2352
02:13:47.930 --> 02:13:49.560
it's such a silly thing.

2353
02:13:49.980 --> 02:13:53.310
People look at that and like you need to go and get your body fat tested.

2354
02:13:53.311 --> 02:13:56.900
You need to get your,
your body mass indicator needs to be done.

2355
02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:00.420
[inaudible] soaking or the electrical when we stand on it,

2356
02:14:00.421 --> 02:14:02.630
what's the best one to fit the,
the uh,

2357
02:14:02.670 --> 02:14:06.340
the immersion tank is really the only way to go.
That's the best way to go.
Yeah.

2358
02:14:06.341 --> 02:14:09.950
Their stuff is so highly variable.
Yeah.

2359
02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:12.450
And most of it is geared towards overweight people.

2360
02:14:12.690 --> 02:14:16.500
So if you have an athletic population using it,
it's not even on the same planet.

2361
02:14:16.501 --> 02:14:19.470
It's not even close.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I've heard that.
The um,

2362
02:14:19.500 --> 02:14:21.510
the one that tests you,

2363
02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:25.800
you stand on it and if it gets your body fat,
if you're dehydrated,

2364
02:14:25.801 --> 02:14:30.110
it registers that as more fat because it's more resistance for the electricity

2365
02:14:30.190 --> 02:14:33.570
pass through your system.
Fascinated.
I probably run like eight,

2366
02:14:34.020 --> 02:14:36.450
eight to 10% body fat,
reasonably lean,
not like,

2367
02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:38.550
not like ridiculously lean but reasonably lane.

2368
02:14:38.940 --> 02:14:41.550
And there was some sort of a health fair going on and I jumped on one of these

2369
02:14:41.551 --> 02:14:44.970
scales and it put me at 32% body fat.
Whoa.
And you,

2370
02:14:44.971 --> 02:14:46.920
you could imagine that maybe it's like,
okay,

2371
02:14:46.921 --> 02:14:51.120
maybe it's 12 or maybe even 15 which would be almost 50% off,
but it was like,

2372
02:14:51.630 --> 02:14:54.990
okay,
yeah,
there's something serious like broken.
What is your normal body fat?

2373
02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:58.140
I think like seven to seven to ten eight to 10 something like that.

2374
02:14:58.141 --> 02:15:01.530
I like to stay at that reasonably lane.
Yeah.
If you get leaner than that,

2375
02:15:01.531 --> 02:15:03.300
then I noticed my performance tanks.

2376
02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:07.740
So like you would like to be like kind of Brag,
Pitt,
fight club lean,

2377
02:15:07.750 --> 02:15:10.760
but then like you can't actually fight.
You can't,
that's not funny.

2378
02:15:10.990 --> 02:15:12.600
Well dudes that are really super lean,

2379
02:15:12.601 --> 02:15:15.560
when you see them competing in MMA that have cut an incredible amount of weight

2380
02:15:15.561 --> 02:15:17.100
and how much of an impact does that have?

2381
02:15:17.101 --> 02:15:20.610
Just the fact that even when they rehydrate,
they have to fight so lean.

2382
02:15:20.970 --> 02:15:22.900
I don't know it.
You know that on the individual,

2383
02:15:22.901 --> 02:15:26.310
some people run lean and still have some good performance,

2384
02:15:26.311 --> 02:15:28.530
but you know it wired into our brain,

2385
02:15:28.531 --> 02:15:32.910
wired into our genetics is a really tightly controlled mechanism to know how

2386
02:15:32.911 --> 02:15:34.770
much body fat we have and the,

2387
02:15:34.870 --> 02:15:38.790
usually we want some not too much because you start getting unhealthy with too

2388
02:15:38.791 --> 02:15:41.520
much,
but if you start getting really,
really lean,

2389
02:15:41.521 --> 02:15:45.360
your body registers that as a stress because you don't have much survival

2390
02:15:45.361 --> 02:15:48.030
reserve.
Like if there was a starvation scenario,

2391
02:15:48.031 --> 02:15:51.500
then you know your body starts getting anxious about that in a little vague

2392
02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:53.030
cortisol,
it will suppress your,

2393
02:15:53.050 --> 02:15:56.280
your work output because it doesn't want you to be two lane.

2394
02:15:56.600 --> 02:16:00.600
You're making people so happy today.
Do understand what you're doing here.

2395
02:16:00.750 --> 02:16:03.480
You're saying bacon and eggs in the morning is good.

2396
02:16:03.630 --> 02:16:07.280
You're saying coffee is good.
Look what I just bought off with facing.

2397
02:16:07.290 --> 02:16:09.130
You need some fat in it.

2398
02:16:09.131 --> 02:16:13.100
You say it a couple of drinks or tactical Cancun.

2399
02:16:14.580 --> 02:16:19.340
It lasts for 10 years.
It has 18 servings that can't be good,
Brian,
whatever.

2400
02:16:19.341 --> 02:16:22.320
And then you get a real bacon.
Samuel,
listen to what he said about preservatives.

2401
02:16:22.321 --> 02:16:25.770
Real bad.
Some shit of you're dying.
You're in a fucking bunker now.

2402
02:16:25.771 --> 02:16:29.160
If you're camping and you need to use their base,
you run out of the bay camping,

2403
02:16:29.290 --> 02:16:30.070
not tactical.

2404
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:34.570
<v 0>There's a fucking AK 47 on the trunk,
shows you what that is.</v>

2405
02:16:34.571 --> 02:16:37.860
That box is designed for when the end of the world comes,
you need bacon.

2406
02:16:37.870 --> 02:16:41.020
The doomsday bunker don't eat the shit that's only going to be here at the end

2407
02:16:41.021 --> 02:16:44.620
of the world.
Okay.
I would say get some real bacon.
He's silly pitch.

2408
02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:48.760
So what I need to do is start my own farm and cook my own Bacon.

2409
02:16:48.761 --> 02:16:51.910
Slow for two hours.
That's yeah,
that's started.

2410
02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:54.410
<v 3>Yeah,
dude,
that's the route to like a happy life.</v>

2411
02:16:54.740 --> 02:16:57.410
How do you start when you started the bacon?
I get up,

2412
02:16:57.940 --> 02:17:02.060
we have a three month old kid now,
daughter,

2413
02:17:02.420 --> 02:17:04.550
and so I take the early morning shifts,

2414
02:17:04.551 --> 02:17:08.870
so I grab her from my wife about five 30 or six play with her,

2415
02:17:08.871 --> 02:17:12.440
get the bacon going,
do all that stuff.
So I'm,
I'm up.
Then.
Yeah,

2416
02:17:12.770 --> 02:17:16.500
it's a fetish thing to our bake.
It's a bit fetish.
You know,
I'm,

2417
02:17:16.501 --> 02:17:20.060
I'm cooking it ahead of time cause my wife gets up around eight and so I'm

2418
02:17:20.061 --> 02:17:23.150
cooking it.
And then about the time she starts getting up,
then it gets,

2419
02:17:23.151 --> 02:17:25.700
makes going.
My coffee's already been done.

2420
02:17:25.701 --> 02:17:27.740
I make her some coffee and then we get the whole,

2421
02:17:27.741 --> 02:17:31.880
how did you know that this is a good move to have it slow cook for two hours.

2422
02:17:31.881 --> 02:17:36.830
So my buddy Matt [inaudible] who's a Harvard phd chemist and just,

2423
02:17:37.010 --> 02:17:40.790
we call them the cracking.
It's like unleashed the cracking,
you know?
And he's,

2424
02:17:40.791 --> 02:17:42.740
he's just wickedly smart dude.

2425
02:17:42.741 --> 02:17:46.670
But he did all this research and he's like slow cooking meat is the only way

2426
02:17:46.671 --> 02:17:50.770
that you should do it.
You're a moron if you do anything else.
Really.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2427
02:17:50.810 --> 02:17:54.980
That's crazy.
Cause I cook steaks quick.
Yeah,
it's so good.

2428
02:17:55.110 --> 02:17:57.880
They're super good.
And I mean the grilling deal is,
you know,

2429
02:17:57.890 --> 02:18:02.060
there's a big argument for senior,
how do you get like that outer crispy Brown?

2430
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:05.180
You don't,
but you think about someone like the pit barbecue and stuff,

2431
02:18:05.181 --> 02:18:08.690
which is a slow cooked.
It's amazing.
So,
so I mean there,
there's,

2432
02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:09.673
there's some tradeoffs

2433
02:18:09.850 --> 02:18:14.470
<v 0>that too,
but I also liked the medium rare steak is done correctly.</v>

2434
02:18:14.770 --> 02:18:19.240
I guess the Argentinian method of cooking steaks is a low and slow cooking

2435
02:18:19.241 --> 02:18:23.230
method,
right?
Yeah.
They have their,
they have a love of steak as well.
Right.

2436
02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:26.480
And really good meat.
Grass Fed.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2437
02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:29.080
Well that's how most of the fucking world is.
I love that.

2438
02:18:29.081 --> 02:18:32.620
Brazil just want a big lawsuit over Monsanto.
Do you know this?

2439
02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:35.660
<v 3>No,
I didn't hear about this.
I know that Monsanto was trying to push into a</v>

2440
02:18:35.820 --> 02:18:39.220
<v 0>Mexico.
Yeah.
They,
I'm sure they're going to push everywhere eventually.</v>

2441
02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:42.180
But the Brazil,
once a multibillion dollar lawsuit,

2442
02:18:42.181 --> 02:18:45.030
a bunch of farmers from Brazil won against Monsanto.

2443
02:18:45.330 --> 02:18:50.330
It's just we got to figure out a way to let people grow grass and have the

2444
02:18:51.181 --> 02:18:54.990
animals eat grass.
Cause that's the healthiest way.
I mean it really,
it's people.

2445
02:18:55.770 --> 02:19:00.240
It should be,
someone should be able to say,
hey listen,
this is,
you guys are,

2446
02:19:00.330 --> 02:19:01.740
we're being silly here.

2447
02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:04.960
Let's do this the way these animals are supposed to be eating.
Like,
we're,
we're,

2448
02:19:05.090 --> 02:19:07.790
we,
we see what happens when we make them eat animals,
right?

2449
02:19:07.800 --> 02:19:08.970
We're making them eat themselves,

2450
02:19:08.971 --> 02:19:11.940
which is the most insane thing about farming ever,
right?
You know,

2451
02:19:11.941 --> 02:19:13.800
the mad cow disease,
ladies and gentlemen,

2452
02:19:13.810 --> 02:19:17.490
you don't know it was started because they made cows eat other fucking cows.

2453
02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:22.980
<v 3>They just had another,
uh,
equal,
I break out in the way that this equal light is,</v>

2454
02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:26.370
it becomes problematic when you feed cattle grains.

2455
02:19:26.430 --> 02:19:30.260
It increases stomach acid content in the cattle.
It gives some gerd,

2456
02:19:30.500 --> 02:19:34.040
gastroesophageal reflux disease type type deal because of the yellow elevated

2457
02:19:34.041 --> 02:19:38.570
acid in this,
uh,
e coli that is normally killed by stomach acid.

2458
02:19:38.810 --> 02:19:41.810
You selectively breed it to survive high acid environment.

2459
02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:46.700
So the stuff that normally our own stomach acid would kill because we feed the

2460
02:19:46.701 --> 02:19:48.500
cattle grains instead of grass.

2461
02:19:48.501 --> 02:19:52.700
We actually produce like a superbug that then if it gets some other genetic

2462
02:19:52.701 --> 02:19:53.421
modifications,

2463
02:19:53.421 --> 02:19:57.830
it makes it deadly and it can survive going through the digestive process where

2464
02:19:57.831 --> 02:20:00.260
normally we would kill it so that,
you know,
the,

2465
02:20:00.261 --> 02:20:04.820
the grain feeding of cattle is just like,
it's super expensive.
It's dirty.
It's,

2466
02:20:04.860 --> 02:20:08.500
it's a,
yeah.
Yeah.

2467
02:20:08.940 --> 02:20:11.330
But there is a benefit of packing on more fat on the animal,

2468
02:20:11.331 --> 02:20:14.870
which makes it a little bit more juicy when you cook it.
Yeah,
I mean,

2469
02:20:14.930 --> 02:20:17.590
but you know,
it's,
it's interesting though,
like if you,

2470
02:20:17.591 --> 02:20:20.160
you find folks like what we'd spent a bunch of time in,

2471
02:20:20.161 --> 02:20:23.270
in Nicaragua and stuff and the folks from there,

2472
02:20:23.540 --> 02:20:27.350
you get used to eating the meat that's grass fed and it's definitely leaner,

2473
02:20:27.620 --> 02:20:29.870
but it's very,
very flavorful and it's different.

2474
02:20:29.900 --> 02:20:33.310
I think that more than Amy almost,
it's almost a little more gaining.
Yeah.

2475
02:20:33.590 --> 02:20:36.220
By my mortgage people have that association.
Gaming like gave me like,

2476
02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:40.070
he I think like vibrant.
Right.
That's what I,
when I,
when I say gaming,

2477
02:20:40.420 --> 02:20:44.060
I mean like funky grass fed meat tastes more like butter.
Yeah.
You know,

2478
02:20:44.140 --> 02:20:46.370
it's got kind of like a buttery consistency to it.

2479
02:20:46.660 --> 02:20:51.380
Grass fed beef is really delicious.
Yeah.
Grain Fed beef is a little bit more,

2480
02:20:51.410 --> 02:20:54.680
well,
there's sick.
I mean,
that's really what it is.
You're eating a sick animal.

2481
02:20:54.850 --> 02:20:58.910
That's why I don't like King Coburn.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Scary stuff.
Yeah.

2482
02:20:59.090 --> 02:21:03.050
The one in Food Inc when they had the hole in the animal side because it was
like

2483
02:21:04.670 --> 02:21:08.510
fucking stomach acids were rotting.
Yeah,
it's a race against,

2484
02:21:08.540 --> 02:21:10.250
when you feed cattle grains,

2485
02:21:10.251 --> 02:21:13.490
it's a race against time to get them fast enough to take them to market before

2486
02:21:13.491 --> 02:21:16.880
they die from all the gastrointestinal problems.
And here's a,

2487
02:21:16.890 --> 02:21:20.140
here's an interesting thing.
There's a guy,
a Dr. Michael leads who's kind of a,

2488
02:21:20.190 --> 02:21:22.370
a long time,
a low carb guy,

2489
02:21:22.371 --> 02:21:26.450
but he's kind of a Paleo guy to really interesting tude but he was doing some

2490
02:21:26.451 --> 02:21:31.280
research on um,
just like diets and different things.
And he went to,

2491
02:21:31.380 --> 02:21:35.480
he's from Arkansas,
so he went to a feed lot of feed store and he asked the guy,

2492
02:21:35.481 --> 02:21:38.540
hey,
what do you,
what do you feed animals to get them fat?
You know,

2493
02:21:38.541 --> 02:21:41.810
like horses and cattle and pigs and all that.
And I'm like,
well,

2494
02:21:41.811 --> 02:21:45.620
the guy upstairs has this manual and it was like feeding manual for weight gain

2495
02:21:45.621 --> 02:21:47.570
and animals or something.
And he opens it up.

2496
02:21:47.870 --> 02:21:51.080
And when you looked at the ratios of protein,
carbohydrate to fat,

2497
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:55.580
it was like identical to the food pyramid.
I mean fucking spot on.

2498
02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:58.700
Whereas used to we we,
you know,
like the four food groups even,

2499
02:21:58.701 --> 02:22:02.770
which like when you and I were kids was still more the,
the Gig.
Um,

2500
02:22:03.140 --> 02:22:04.850
you typically ate more fat,

2501
02:22:04.910 --> 02:22:08.270
more protein and less carbs just in general.

2502
02:22:08.271 --> 02:22:10.520
So it was really interesting like the formula,

2503
02:22:10.521 --> 02:22:15.521
the standardized formula in this huge tome of a book too to get animals fat for,

2504
02:22:16.641 --> 02:22:19.800
for sale was identical to like the,

2505
02:22:19.801 --> 02:22:23.060
the food ratio is recommended by the Ada.
Wow.

2506
02:22:23.120 --> 02:22:26.520
It's a fattening diet because of the carbohydrate content,

2507
02:22:26.820 --> 02:22:29.670
because of the allowance for,
for refined sugars and stuff like that.

2508
02:22:29.670 --> 02:22:33.930
And you said this all started being implemented in the 1970s the recommendation

2509
02:22:33.931 --> 02:22:38.340
for grains?
Yeah.
You know,
prior to like the late sixties,
early seventies,

2510
02:22:38.341 --> 02:22:41.940
whenever you went to a doctor and you were overweight,
you were recommended,

2511
02:22:41.941 --> 02:22:46.710
you were prescribed a low carb diet for like a hundred years.
That was the norm.

2512
02:22:46.711 --> 02:22:50.100
And it,
this is a Gary Tobbs wrote a really interesting book,
good calories,

2513
02:22:50.101 --> 02:22:53.430
bad calories to huge.
Like you can only read it like a page at a time.

2514
02:22:53.431 --> 02:22:56.100
It's like reading biblical text.
It's super thick,

2515
02:22:56.101 --> 02:23:01.101
but for a hundred years it was just understood that if you were overweight you

2516
02:23:01.771 --> 02:23:05.640
cut out like beer,
potatoes,
pasta,
rice.

2517
02:23:05.780 --> 02:23:10.500
I eat protein and fat and green vegetables and you lost weight.

2518
02:23:10.890 --> 02:23:15.060
And it was,
it was just woven into,
you know,
all of medicine.

2519
02:23:15.061 --> 02:23:18.750
And then around the 1950s we had this idea that uh,

2520
02:23:18.780 --> 02:23:22.320
heart heart disease was caused by fat consumption,

2521
02:23:22.650 --> 02:23:25.560
which had never been born out by the,
the science.

2522
02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:30.560
It was interestingly a vegetarian on a political committee that kind of put this

2523
02:23:31.381 --> 02:23:34.650
thing forward and ended up in acting a bunch of the laws that push this stuff

2524
02:23:34.651 --> 02:23:34.981
forward.

2525
02:23:34.981 --> 02:23:38.580
And we've spent billions of dollars trying to prove that saturated fat causes

2526
02:23:38.581 --> 02:23:41.550
cardiovascular disease.
They had the Framingham heart study,

2527
02:23:41.551 --> 02:23:45.690
which was 30,000 nurses or something like that,
tracked over like 30 years.

2528
02:23:46.020 --> 02:23:49.170
And the nurses that ate the most fat,
the most saturated fat,

2529
02:23:49.230 --> 02:23:51.750
eight the most calories were the leanest,

2530
02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:55.230
had the highest energy levels and tended to be the longest lived.

2531
02:23:56.010 --> 02:23:59.280
And so every,
I mean it's totally the emperor's new clothes type thing,

2532
02:23:59.281 --> 02:24:02.450
like everything we've been told it's just fucking wrong.
Like,

2533
02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:05.430
and not petite mall.
The wrong like grand wrong.
It's horrible.

2534
02:24:05.460 --> 02:24:07.590
What about salt causing problems?

2535
02:24:08.250 --> 02:24:11.670
A lot of things in biology have what's called a u shaped curve.

2536
02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:15.570
So like if you have too low of intake,
you have a high rate of disease.

2537
02:24:15.810 --> 02:24:17.160
As the intake increases,

2538
02:24:17.161 --> 02:24:22.161
disease drops to a low point and then above a certain point disease starts going

2539
02:24:22.231 --> 02:24:26.130
up and there's so many nutrients and biological processes.

2540
02:24:26.340 --> 02:24:28.680
Exercise is a good one.
You don't have any exercise.

2541
02:24:28.681 --> 02:24:32.130
You're likely to die from a host of problems.
You have a good amount of exercise.

2542
02:24:32.131 --> 02:24:36.390
Your likelihood of being healthy and dying decreases to much exercise in your

2543
02:24:36.391 --> 02:24:39.190
life to die.
The dies during an ultra marathon.

2544
02:24:39.210 --> 02:24:41.610
So salt is exactly the same.

2545
02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:44.460
Like we should have some salt and it's actually,

2546
02:24:44.500 --> 02:24:49.140
it's like three to five grams a day.
It's a reasonably high level that hits that,

2547
02:24:49.141 --> 02:24:53.970
that really low edge of of a decreasing.
Yeah,
of being beneficial.

2548
02:24:54.120 --> 02:24:58.050
There are some people that respond very negatively to chloride,

2549
02:24:58.051 --> 02:25:01.650
which salt is sodium chloride and they respond very negatively to it.

2550
02:25:01.651 --> 02:25:04.110
They retain water at Jacks up their blood pressure there.

2551
02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:06.990
So there are some people that they need to be pretty low salt,

2552
02:25:07.080 --> 02:25:08.950
otherwise they're going to have cardiovascular problems.

2553
02:25:08.951 --> 02:25:12.840
So it does it cause hypertension and people if they overdose in it or is that a

2554
02:25:12.841 --> 02:25:16.320
misnomer?
It,
it can but it interestingly,

2555
02:25:16.321 --> 02:25:19.620
when you consume carbohydrates and your insulin levels go up,

2556
02:25:19.860 --> 02:25:21.030
when insulin goes up,

2557
02:25:21.031 --> 02:25:24.250
another hormone called aldosterone goes up and aldosterone causes

2558
02:25:24.250 --> 02:25:28.030
<v 0>your body to retain salt.
And when you retain salt you retain water.</v>

2559
02:25:28.330 --> 02:25:32.830
So it's actually an indirect way that sodium elevates blood pressure.

2560
02:25:33.100 --> 02:25:36.100
But if your insulin levels are high,
say you're eating a high carb diet,

2561
02:25:36.101 --> 02:25:37.210
you know like grain based,

2562
02:25:37.211 --> 02:25:40.480
you know Ada recommended diet and you cut your salt back,

2563
02:25:40.481 --> 02:25:43.750
you may still have very high blood pressure because of insulin problem,

2564
02:25:43.751 --> 02:25:47.500
not necessarily the salt problem.
Where's you're eating a little lower carb,

2565
02:25:47.890 --> 02:25:50.590
you can eat some salt and it's not going to be problematic at all.

2566
02:25:50.620 --> 02:25:53.170
So most people don't have sodium issues.

2567
02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:57.760
I would say it's less an issue of sodium and more an issue of carbohydrate and

2568
02:25:57.761 --> 02:25:58.594
also sleep.

2569
02:25:58.600 --> 02:26:03.310
Circling back around like sleep is only one or two nights of Miss Sleep.

2570
02:26:03.311 --> 02:26:07.270
Like poor sleep can make you as insulin resistant as a type two diabetic.

2571
02:26:07.630 --> 02:26:12.400
So I mean it,
it's a no joke deal at to ranges,
insulin function like immediately.

2572
02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:15.730
Have you ever fucked around with an isolation tank?
You know,
I haven't,

2573
02:26:15.850 --> 02:26:20.440
I have not.
I've done it.
I've done a bunch of uh,
meditation,

2574
02:26:20.441 --> 02:26:22.060
all kinds of psychedelics.
I,

2575
02:26:22.061 --> 02:26:26.630
I've done all kinds of other stuff while you're into recovery so much.
Yeah,

2576
02:26:26.750 --> 02:26:29.680
I have,
I've never had the opportunity to mess with it.

2577
02:26:30.140 --> 02:26:32.850
I've got to get you involved with it somehow or another and,

2578
02:26:32.860 --> 02:26:37.180
and see what your results are because I know you're so conscious of your,

2579
02:26:37.181 --> 02:26:41.950
your rest and one of the most relaxing feelings ever is like doing like a couple

2580
02:26:41.950 --> 02:26:45.590
hours in a tank,
right?
The high céline deal.
And you just drift off.
Yes.

2581
02:26:45.790 --> 02:26:49.780
800 pounds of Epson salts in there,
right?
93 and a half degree temperature.

2582
02:26:49.900 --> 02:26:52.230
Same as your skin.
You float into it.
I mean you,

2583
02:26:52.231 --> 02:26:54.130
you feel nothing after the first 20 minutes.

2584
02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:57.660
Once you get over the fact that your long and water,
you've flying through space,

2585
02:26:57.661 --> 02:27:00.820
you're completely weightless and everything's sort of lengthens out.
It feels,

2586
02:27:00.821 --> 02:27:05.110
it's so relaxing,
right?
So if you'll hear things go pop like your,

2587
02:27:05.111 --> 02:27:07.900
like your muscles will like stretch out on why?

2588
02:27:08.050 --> 02:27:10.660
Because it's literally a feeling of complete weightlessness.

2589
02:27:10.661 --> 02:27:13.240
You're floating in the water.
Right?
It's amazing feeling.

2590
02:27:13.270 --> 02:27:16.330
Somebody told me about it but I've just never had a chance.
That's incredible.

2591
02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:21.360
I am still to this day amazed at how little coverage and how little exposure the

2592
02:27:21.581 --> 02:27:26.170
isolation tank has.
It to me is one of the most amazing tools for first of all,

2593
02:27:26.171 --> 02:27:29.800
just for thinking.
Cause it's like meditation is one thing.
I think we,
you know,

2594
02:27:29.810 --> 02:27:31.840
we've covered visualization and meditation.

2595
02:27:31.860 --> 02:27:36.160
Super important for anybody trying to achieve something,
but there is no alone.

2596
02:27:36.161 --> 02:27:40.700
Like that tank,
that tangle loan is you alone from your body.
Right.
I mean you,

2597
02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:41.830
you dissipate your,

2598
02:27:41.860 --> 02:27:45.940
it's your mind literally untethered from your physical form.

2599
02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:48.940
It's just thanking you,
don't see anything.
You don't hear anything.

2600
02:27:48.941 --> 02:27:52.450
You don't feel anything.
You just can stay put and not move.

2601
02:27:52.451 --> 02:27:55.110
You won't feel the fucking water.
You won't feel your body at all.

2602
02:27:55.130 --> 02:27:58.750
You feel like you're flying through the darkness and you're completely alone

2603
02:27:58.751 --> 02:27:59.584
with your thoughts,

2604
02:27:59.590 --> 02:28:03.640
but it's not disassociative because you don't lose your yourself.
Exactly.

2605
02:28:04.690 --> 02:28:06.310
Yourself as,

2606
02:28:07.030 --> 02:28:11.530
as introspective as you ever get.
You can't escape your insecurities.

2607
02:28:11.531 --> 02:28:13.450
You can't escape your,
your,
your troubles.

2608
02:28:13.451 --> 02:28:16.300
You can't escape the things he and you not liking about your do your laziness,

2609
02:28:16.301 --> 02:28:20.020
your lack of discipline.
You,
you know,
you can't escape any of it.
It's,

2610
02:28:20.021 --> 02:28:24.920
it's you untethered from any distractions,
physical distractions,

2611
02:28:24.921 --> 02:28:28.850
and he's spatial,
recognizing colors,
hearing sounds,
all that's gone,

2612
02:28:29.060 --> 02:28:31.550
this dark blackness,
no sound,
no nothing.

2613
02:28:31.970 --> 02:28:35.450
So amazing environment and it's great for relaxation.
Man.

2614
02:28:35.451 --> 02:28:37.520
When I come out of there,
I feel recharged.

2615
02:28:37.700 --> 02:28:40.610
I can do two hours in the tank and I felt like I just got up for an from an

2616
02:28:40.611 --> 02:28:44.470
awesome like eight hour arresting sleep.
Interesting.
Yeah.

2617
02:28:44.550 --> 02:28:46.550
Do do people come and stitch sometimes,

2618
02:28:46.551 --> 02:28:48.330
like they get a little little weirded out.

2619
02:28:48.350 --> 02:28:50.720
We get weirded out and quit and then you just get out of the tank that can't

2620
02:28:50.721 --> 02:28:55.680
handle the aloneness,
the solitude,
the silence.
They can't handle the,
the,
the,

2621
02:28:55.730 --> 02:28:59.840
what happens to the mind because in the absence of any sort of sensory input,

2622
02:28:59.841 --> 02:29:02.150
the mind can develop a psychedelic state.
Right.

2623
02:29:02.151 --> 02:29:04.910
And so you can start hallucinating and having,
you know,
some really,

2624
02:29:05.090 --> 02:29:06.690
really crazy and uh,

2625
02:29:07.120 --> 02:29:11.420
the almost like lucid dream type situations.
Some people don't like that.

2626
02:29:11.421 --> 02:29:14.000
Some people love it and some people,
that's what they're looking forward to.

2627
02:29:14.001 --> 02:29:16.310
But just the introspective nature of it and the,
the,

2628
02:29:16.520 --> 02:29:19.280
the relaxation that you can achieve inside of there.

2629
02:29:19.281 --> 02:29:23.750
I'll be really curious to see what,
how that you would be affected by that.

2630
02:29:23.780 --> 02:29:25.770
I can't believe you haven't tried it.
I would love to try it.

2631
02:29:25.771 --> 02:29:28.430
You're going to fucking love it.
I'm going to hook.
How long are you in town for?

2632
02:29:28.580 --> 02:29:31.430
A Sunday until Sunday.
If I'm,

2633
02:29:31.431 --> 02:29:34.790
I set you up at the float lab in Venice.
Can you make a trip down there?

2634
02:29:34.791 --> 02:29:37.880
Could you do that?
Uh,
tomorrow I potentially do it.
Okay.

2635
02:29:37.881 --> 02:29:40.280
I'll call crash personally and set it up.
Okay.

2636
02:29:40.281 --> 02:29:44.440
It makes the best tanks in the country,
in the world.
Really.
His tanks are there.

2637
02:29:44.690 --> 02:29:46.850
They're incredible.
They're,
they look like meat lockers.

2638
02:29:47.030 --> 02:29:51.470
They're these giant things and they're really wide and deep and he uses like the

2639
02:29:51.471 --> 02:29:55.820
best possible,
uh,
cleaning equipment.
It's all,
all the water's pass through.

2640
02:29:55.821 --> 02:29:58.730
Ozone was like,
no,
no worries.

2641
02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:01.730
Ever have anything like being in the water and nothing negative.

2642
02:30:02.120 --> 02:30:06.200
And he always has a temperature perfect.
And he just,
he's a master at this shit.

2643
02:30:06.700 --> 02:30:10.730
This guy is the best in the world and he's in Venice and he will totally hook
it.

2644
02:30:10.731 --> 02:30:13.790
I was the flow lab and if enemies interested to go to the float lab.com you

2645
02:30:13.791 --> 02:30:16.940
could see the photos of it.
They look like crazy fucking time portals,

2646
02:30:16.941 --> 02:30:20.930
these things.
And they really are.
I mean it would,
it really is.
It's like,

2647
02:30:20.931 --> 02:30:24.860
if you could take a pill that would put you in that state where you're,

2648
02:30:25.610 --> 02:30:28.730
you're in this crazy darkness flying through space,

2649
02:30:28.910 --> 02:30:31.850
relieved from all the input from your body,

2650
02:30:31.970 --> 02:30:34.780
that would be a crazy fucking drug.
You know,

2651
02:30:34.850 --> 02:30:38.150
you're achieving a very strange state without a crazy drug.

2652
02:30:38.460 --> 02:30:42.590
Not really wanting to do it,
man.
We got to hook it up.
Oh,
I'm there.
We'll set up.

2653
02:30:42.591 --> 02:30:46.390
We'll set it up for sure.
Um,
if people want to follow you,
uh,

2654
02:30:46.430 --> 02:30:49.370
the book is called the Paleo Solution.
It is available,
I'm sure.

2655
02:30:49.371 --> 02:30:52.720
I'm Amazon except audible.com soon.

2656
02:30:52.721 --> 02:30:56.450
You sons of bitches on the beach and you're working on a deal.

2657
02:30:56.451 --> 02:30:58.400
Is that what it is?
Yeah,
we're,
we're uh,

2658
02:30:58.430 --> 02:31:02.960
just finished getting ready to basically bring a mobile recording deal to my

2659
02:31:02.961 --> 02:31:06.050
house and then I'll sit down and like bang the thing out and then we'll be good.

2660
02:31:06.051 --> 02:31:08.930
So yeah,
if you go to doug.com Brian makes money,

2661
02:31:08.990 --> 02:31:13.880
so he's got one of those weird deals with Amazon,
so go there and support.

2662
02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.940
So the Paleo Solution Diet.
Um,
if anybody else,

2663
02:31:16.941 --> 02:31:19.990
if they want to get any more information about this,
what's best way to grow

2664
02:31:20.020 --> 02:31:20.890
<v 3>on it.com.</v>

2665
02:31:22.170 --> 02:31:25.950
Everything that anybody would ever need to do this for free on the website.

2666
02:31:26.010 --> 02:31:29.400
So like whether you want to lose weight,
if you've got an auto immune disease,

2667
02:31:29.401 --> 02:31:32.970
if you're a high level athlete,
you don't have to buy the book,
go to the website,

2668
02:31:33.210 --> 02:31:37.530
everything's laid out there for free.
Do it.
And then typically when people do it,

2669
02:31:37.531 --> 02:31:40.200
they get great results and then they end up buying the book.
So yeah.

2670
02:31:40.201 --> 02:31:44.760
And then I've got a podcast to Paleo solution that's once a week Paleo solution

2671
02:31:44.761 --> 02:31:46.380
that's available on iTunes.
Itunes,
yeah.

2672
02:31:46.381 --> 02:31:49.830
We're typically between number one and number four in the health category.

2673
02:31:49.831 --> 02:31:52.650
Like Oh,
beautiful.
We'll Duke it out with a Jillian Michaels.

2674
02:31:53.020 --> 02:31:54.340
<v 0>I'm doing pretty good on.
Good.</v>

2675
02:31:55.620 --> 02:31:58.890
I heard some crazy like someone stole Julian Michael's car and crashed into a

2676
02:31:58.891 --> 02:32:02.040
tree.
They broke into her house,
stole her badly.

2677
02:32:02.220 --> 02:32:04.200
She would probably kick their ass if she got a whole look.

2678
02:32:04.500 --> 02:32:09.500
I think so she's had sex.
How did you like that?
I think she's gay dude.
Yeah.

2679
02:32:10.440 --> 02:32:13.740
Yeah.
I don't think,
yeah,
we think she's gay for real though.
She's so hot.

2680
02:32:13.741 --> 02:32:16.200
It makes me,
it was hard to believe it's,
you just need some good Dick.

2681
02:32:16.260 --> 02:32:19.920
She just needs you Brian,
to be consensus.
Joe,
did you see in persuading?

2682
02:32:20.370 --> 02:32:22.320
I've met a lot of guys.
I don't understand.
I mean,

2683
02:32:22.321 --> 02:32:25.500
I don't understand how any girl doesn't go gay.
I think they should all go keg.

2684
02:32:25.540 --> 02:32:26.850
Most guys are fucking losers,

2685
02:32:27.090 --> 02:32:29.820
but I think a lot of these poor girls are not really gay.

2686
02:32:29.821 --> 02:32:33.300
They just need some good Dick.
Yup,
sure.
Did you see the pictures?
I put it on.

2687
02:32:33.301 --> 02:32:34.950
I don't mean this folks.
Okay.

2688
02:32:34.951 --> 02:32:38.760
If you're some crazy fucking like really super leftist person,

2689
02:32:38.761 --> 02:32:42.440
you want to label me sexist?
I'm just talking shit.
Okay.
It's fun.

2690
02:32:42.480 --> 02:32:45.510
It's just talking shit.
I don't really think you can fuck someone straight.
Okay.

2691
02:32:45.540 --> 02:32:48.450
You feel better now.
Take all the joy out of comedy.

2692
02:32:48.480 --> 02:32:51.580
Don't you love the exculpatory clause you need on everything.
It's still like,

2693
02:32:51.690 --> 02:32:54.120
okay,
this is a plastic bag.
Don't put it over your head.

2694
02:32:54.200 --> 02:32:57.360
I keep talking to my other,
I'm sorry Brian,
we'll get right back to you.

2695
02:32:57.361 --> 02:33:00.210
But I keep talking about teen people.
You know,

2696
02:33:00.211 --> 02:33:02.660
let's say all sharks can suck my dick.
We should kill them all.

2697
02:33:02.661 --> 02:33:03.630
She's killing anything that kills you.

2698
02:33:03.780 --> 02:33:05.640
I don't really mean that you fucking dummies.

2699
02:33:05.880 --> 02:33:07.590
I don't really think you should go out and kill all the sharks,

2700
02:33:07.591 --> 02:33:10.140
but that is the reason why I don't surf.

2701
02:33:10.170 --> 02:33:11.970
It's cause I don't want to get eaten by a fucking shark.

2702
02:33:11.971 --> 02:33:14.490
I know they're out there,
but I don't really think you should kill them all.

2703
02:33:14.491 --> 02:33:19.260
You fucking idiots.
I'm going t people fuck the sharks.
They can suck my dick.

2704
02:33:19.380 --> 02:33:21.630
You really think a shark can suck my dick and he really thinks that's what I'm

2705
02:33:21.631 --> 02:33:22.010
saying.

2706
02:33:22.010 --> 02:33:26.840
<v 3>Some people lack the irony gene that just they don't have a signal for irony.</v>

2707
02:33:26.930 --> 02:33:27.681
<v 0>Well,
not only that,</v>

2708
02:33:27.681 --> 02:33:31.620
some people have diarrhea of the mouth and they can't help just saying any

2709
02:33:31.650 --> 02:33:33.140
stupid thing that comes into their mind.

2710
02:33:33.350 --> 02:33:36.660
And so they put it on Twitter pretty much be us without it.

2711
02:33:36.710 --> 02:33:39.790
We just did a three hour podcasts.
I'm talking about mouth,
diarrhea.

2712
02:33:40.040 --> 02:33:43.160
I told people that I got a sex change on Twitter the other day and they posted a

2713
02:33:43.161 --> 02:33:45.890
photo of my sister because she can look kind of like me

2714
02:33:47.670 --> 02:33:49.760
and people really thought I,

2715
02:33:49.761 --> 02:33:54.350
I was like dressed in drag or something like that.
That is awesome.

2716
02:33:54.500 --> 02:33:57.710
There's a lot of fucking morons out there,
man.

2717
02:33:57.920 --> 02:34:00.600
Do you think the dad is an environmental thing?
I mean it's,

2718
02:34:00.660 --> 02:34:03.780
it's definitely a way of your extra area of expertise.
We've created them.

2719
02:34:03.781 --> 02:34:04.490
An environment

2720
02:34:04.490 --> 02:34:09.290
<v 3>in which a complete moron can not only survive but thrive and they don't have to</v>

2721
02:34:09.291 --> 02:34:13.810
be able to get along with other people,
be productive in their own life.
Um,

2722
02:34:13.970 --> 02:34:18.100
there's some safety net that will allow them to reproduce it.
I mean,

2723
02:34:18.101 --> 02:34:23.020
a idiocracy like the first 10 minutes of the accuracy is it,
we fixed this,

2724
02:34:24.190 --> 02:34:24.521
you know,

2725
02:34:24.521 --> 02:34:29.521
at some point the sun's going to expand out to the orbit of Mars and it's not

2726
02:34:29.561 --> 02:34:32.230
going to matter.
So is that really what it is?

2727
02:34:32.231 --> 02:34:36.210
We just let this fucking thing fall apart is fucking write it out.
I mean it,

2728
02:34:36.310 --> 02:34:37.600
I don't know,
man.
It's,

2729
02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:41.370
<v 0>it seems like we're here though.
Okay.
If you're 40,
I'm 44,</v>

2730
02:34:41.371 --> 02:34:44.310
we're here for a certain amount of years.
We only have a certain amount of time.

2731
02:34:44.690 --> 02:34:48.480
Um,
there's gotta be a way to make this a more pleasurable and sustainable

2732
02:34:48.481 --> 02:34:52.020
experience for all the people involved in it and all the future generations

2733
02:34:52.021 --> 02:34:53.550
before the Sun Burns out.

2734
02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:57.720
<v 3>Yeah,
it's gotta be a way to make it more comfortable.</v>

2735
02:34:57.750 --> 02:35:02.550
I just lean towards this whole market based libertarian kind of self

2736
02:35:02.551 --> 02:35:05.910
determination and freedom and you know like we have all this fucked up stuff

2737
02:35:05.911 --> 02:35:09.540
where we have people that want to marry each other and we won't let him marry

2738
02:35:09.541 --> 02:35:13.290
each other and we don't chick filet exactly fill out

2739
02:35:13.390 --> 02:35:16.920
<v 0>cotton chick filet in Boston.
They were going off another,</v>

2740
02:35:16.930 --> 02:35:19.510
another part of the country is saying they don't want Chick-Filet.

2741
02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:20.830
It's hilarious.

2742
02:35:20.830 --> 02:35:24.460
<v 3>So we get to keep,
the only thing,
it was all spun up over stuff like that.</v>

2743
02:35:24.461 --> 02:35:28.600
We dumped a bunch of money into a prohibition,
you know,
tactic on,

2744
02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:31.360
on the drug scene that we know just doesn't fucking work.

2745
02:35:31.390 --> 02:35:35.980
All it does is eat up resources.
It creates a black market.
Well.
It also

2746
02:35:36.070 --> 02:35:37.450
<v 0>creates jobs though.
The real,</v>

2747
02:35:37.451 --> 02:35:41.500
the real problem with keeping drugs illegal is that there's a whole bunch of

2748
02:35:41.501 --> 02:35:44.830
people that make their living busing.
People were on drugs.
There's a reason why,

2749
02:35:44.831 --> 02:35:49.290
by the way,
these fucking DEA agents keep rating medical marijuana dispensaries.

2750
02:35:49.300 --> 02:35:51.340
You don't hear a damn peep about them.

2751
02:35:51.341 --> 02:35:56.341
Busting heroin dealers are busting oxycontin factories or busting illegal shit

2752
02:35:56.651 --> 02:35:58.870
like meth labs.
They're not doing that.
You don't hear that.

2753
02:35:58.871 --> 02:36:01.660
It's very rare because that's dangerous as shit,
you know,

2754
02:36:01.661 --> 02:36:04.690
and they know they can go into these pot factories or these pot dispensary or

2755
02:36:04.691 --> 02:36:08.040
like a cow.
They're easy to get any scholar.
It's an easy collar and it's,

2756
02:36:08.250 --> 02:36:12.370
it's disgusting because there's a business involved in giving these people jobs.

2757
02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:15.670
These people that are DEA agents,
they have to fucking do work.
Okay,

2758
02:36:15.671 --> 02:36:18.580
so they're taking the easiest road possible to do that work.

2759
02:36:18.730 --> 02:36:22.030
They're going after some shit that's illegal.
That doesn't hurt anybody.

2760
02:36:22.031 --> 02:36:26.800
I mean it's,
it's one of the worst abuses of the law that we have clinically or,

2761
02:36:26.910 --> 02:36:31.870
or rather a classically on record.
Like this is like one of the war.
The worst,

2762
02:36:31.900 --> 02:36:33.670
most obvious abuses of the law.

2763
02:36:33.910 --> 02:36:37.930
How are you serving or protecting by closing a dispensary,
right?
You're not,

2764
02:36:37.931 --> 02:36:41.470
you know you're not,
and yet,
you know,
there,
there's like real problems out there.

2765
02:36:41.471 --> 02:36:43.960
You know there's meth labs.
How do these people are on meth?

2766
02:36:44.080 --> 02:36:47.050
You go to fucking drive to Riverside drive,
drive around,

2767
02:36:47.051 --> 02:36:49.420
drive around to these areas that have meth issues,

2768
02:36:49.421 --> 02:36:51.820
where methods in their community.
Where's that math coming from?

2769
02:36:51.821 --> 02:36:54.730
It's coming from somewhere.
You fuck.
You need to go find that Matthew assholes.

2770
02:36:54.810 --> 02:36:56.410
If you want to find something that's bad,

2771
02:36:56.411 --> 02:36:58.480
find something that actually does damage.

2772
02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:02.590
They're taking the cheap and easy way out.
Like shitty government employees.

2773
02:37:02.740 --> 02:37:07.090
That's the real problem with drugs being illegal is that it gives idiots a job

2774
02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:07.970
and keeping things

2775
02:37:08.260 --> 02:37:11.120
<v 3>well and you know,
we're expanding the idiots.
You know,</v>

2776
02:37:11.121 --> 02:37:14.690
you have this kind of wacky healthcare thing that you know they want.

2777
02:37:14.750 --> 02:37:16.290
<v 0>And if not the foot soldiers,</v>

2778
02:37:16.291 --> 02:37:18.400
it's whoever the fuck tells them they have to go and bust.

2779
02:37:18.401 --> 02:37:21.030
It made me maybe the soldiers or the,
the actual officers,

2780
02:37:21.031 --> 02:37:22.860
the ones who tried to make a difference.
I mean,
who knows?

2781
02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:25.530
Who's the dummy that's telling them they need to close down the medical

2782
02:37:25.531 --> 02:37:26.490
marijuana dispensaries.

2783
02:37:26.491 --> 02:37:30.510
But that is the only way you can keep all those people employed.

2784
02:37:30.511 --> 02:37:33.210
They have to be busting somebody's,
you know,
you,

2785
02:37:33.211 --> 02:37:36.480
if you have a million DEA agents or whatever the fuck it is,

2786
02:37:36.481 --> 02:37:40.440
and you all of a sudden make marijuana legal,
what the fuck do they do?
You know,

2787
02:37:40.441 --> 02:37:43.530
what are the prisons do when they have all these people that are in jail for

2788
02:37:43.531 --> 02:37:47.460
something retroactively should be released.
I mean it just because it's a,
they,

2789
02:37:47.461 --> 02:37:49.890
they violated a ridiculous law 10 years ago.

2790
02:37:49.891 --> 02:37:51.900
They shouldn't be still locked in a fucking cage.

2791
02:37:51.901 --> 02:37:55.020
And we've determined that lot is make any sense.
So then what happens?

2792
02:37:55.050 --> 02:37:56.640
We let everybody out of the prisons,

2793
02:37:56.820 --> 02:38:01.050
the prisons don't make money anymore that the privatized prison stocks go down.

2794
02:38:01.051 --> 02:38:01.790
The what are the,

2795
02:38:01.790 --> 02:38:04.440
you've got to fire some of the jail guys of the world than they are.

2796
02:38:04.441 --> 02:38:05.880
They're going to go crazy with their union.
Yeah.

2797
02:38:05.980 --> 02:38:07.730
<v 3>Industries come and go all the time.</v>

2798
02:38:07.731 --> 02:38:11.110
And that's probably one that could stand going.
Yeah,

2799
02:38:11.290 --> 02:38:13.900
<v 0>it could,
but it's not,
it doesn't seem like that's happening in our life.</v>

2800
02:38:13.901 --> 02:38:18.400
We need to figure out a way to force feed that like a fog walk doc and just

2801
02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:20.590
listen cock suckers.
This is the future.

2802
02:38:20.591 --> 02:38:22.990
It's not right to lock people up for marijuana.

2803
02:38:23.070 --> 02:38:24.720
<v 3>You know,
it's,
it's interesting the,</v>

2804
02:38:24.730 --> 02:38:29.430
there was a Ron Paul rally and in Nevada that it went to in Reno and it was
huge.

2805
02:38:29.460 --> 02:38:30.990
And uh,
uh,

2806
02:38:31.050 --> 02:38:35.760
it was all young people and it was like black people and white people and Asian

2807
02:38:35.761 --> 02:38:38.490
people.
And I mean Nevada doesn't have that much racial diversity.

2808
02:38:38.491 --> 02:38:40.970
And so the fact that there,
there was,
you know,

2809
02:38:40.980 --> 02:38:42.720
this mix there and that they were young,

2810
02:38:42.721 --> 02:38:45.570
if they were passionate about this kind of libertarian idea,

2811
02:38:45.990 --> 02:38:49.380
it was pretty interesting in this Paleo scene.

2812
02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:54.800
It's a really interesting overlap with like almost everybody in this Paleocene

2813
02:38:54.960 --> 02:38:58.110
as like kind of libertarian politics.
Like they want gay marriage,

2814
02:38:58.111 --> 02:38:59.840
they want free drugs.
They,
why is that?

2815
02:39:00.750 --> 02:39:03.900
I think it's because they're fucking smart,
you know?
It's like they've kind of,

2816
02:39:04.170 --> 02:39:06.480
they've rattled all this stuff around,
you know,
like the,
the,

2817
02:39:06.481 --> 02:39:09.120
the vegetarians and I know people are going to hate me but you know,

2818
02:39:09.121 --> 02:39:13.470
there's a sense about what we're going to nice our way into a stable world.

2819
02:39:13.470 --> 02:39:17.490
But the reality is that the way that nature works is that you have carnivores

2820
02:39:17.491 --> 02:39:18.390
and de you know,

2821
02:39:18.391 --> 02:39:21.840
herbivores and like there's a biodynamic kind of system there and I think that

2822
02:39:22.170 --> 02:39:25.950
people in the Paleo scene more embraced that and they embrace decentralized

2823
02:39:25.951 --> 02:39:28.560
farming and pull permit culture and things like that.

2824
02:39:28.561 --> 02:39:33.561
But there's a really powerful kind of libertarian element to this Paleo scene

2825
02:39:33.991 --> 02:39:38.670
and it's,
it's grown like crazy,
like every 12 months on Google.
It's doubling and,

2826
02:39:38.690 --> 02:39:43.320
and as it stands right now,
like it is just growing exponentially.
And so you,

2827
02:39:43.350 --> 02:39:47.940
you've got kind of a food oriented kind of exercise oriented scene,

2828
02:39:47.941 --> 02:39:49.470
which is a little culty but you know,

2829
02:39:49.471 --> 02:39:54.471
it's also got this interesting kind of market based libertarian kind of politics

2830
02:39:54.961 --> 02:39:56.310
that that seemed to be woven through.

2831
02:39:56.500 --> 02:40:00.560
<v 0>When you say culty though,
I think it speaks to people's ideas.
It's like,</v>

2832
02:40:01.330 --> 02:40:03.220
you know when,
when it comes along,

2833
02:40:03.460 --> 02:40:07.870
when something comes along that speaks to what people had sort of surmised on

2834
02:40:07.871 --> 02:40:09.790
their own or what,
they didn't have a level four,

2835
02:40:09.791 --> 02:40:12.910
it didn't have a direction to put all the facts in and you know,

2836
02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:17.310
it's especially when it comes to libertarian ideology and just leaving people

2837
02:40:17.311 --> 02:40:19.860
alone,
let them do what the fuck they want to do for so many people.

2838
02:40:19.861 --> 02:40:24.150
That's just a big yes.
Like finally like what the fuck is going on?

2839
02:40:24.340 --> 02:40:27.690
Is it just this weird ass fucking society?
We're dumb.

2840
02:40:27.691 --> 02:40:32.190
People are allowed to thrive and that promotes these ridiculous solutions like a

2841
02:40:32.191 --> 02:40:34.070
10,000 year old earth and you know,

2842
02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:38.070
supporting ridiculous old texts that were written back when people thought the

2843
02:40:38.071 --> 02:40:42.280
world was flat and the sun was 17 miles away.
I mean it almost is like that.

2844
02:40:42.290 --> 02:40:44.100
That's suppressing the growth.

2845
02:40:45.220 --> 02:40:47.280
<v 3>The US is wacky and that we,</v>

2846
02:40:47.281 --> 02:40:52.281
we have a remarkably unsophisticated scientific understanding of the way the

2847
02:40:53.711 --> 02:40:57.850
world works.
Yet we make all the coolest science shit.
It's really weird.

2848
02:40:58.240 --> 02:41:03.240
It's really weird,
you know,
as a preset for like cern,
right?
10,000 sites,

2849
02:41:03.250 --> 02:41:07.960
which is super cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But you know,
it,
it's a weird gig.
And you know,

2850
02:41:07.961 --> 02:41:11.350
I think a lot of you don't like the problematic things that pop up.

2851
02:41:11.351 --> 02:41:14.390
Like when you see people who were homeless,
when you see,
uh,

2852
02:41:14.440 --> 02:41:17.680
families with kids who don't have a job and they don't have a home,

2853
02:41:17.681 --> 02:41:19.090
then you want to do something to help them.

2854
02:41:19.091 --> 02:41:23.650
And I think having support networks and safety nets are smart,

2855
02:41:23.830 --> 02:41:27.850
but when you create them in such a way that you're incentivized to stay in

2856
02:41:27.851 --> 02:41:29.020
versus get out,

2857
02:41:29.320 --> 02:41:33.850
then you create an indentured class and essentially a slave class because they

2858
02:41:33.851 --> 02:41:37.960
can't get,
if you don't incentivize people to have self direction,

2859
02:41:38.260 --> 02:41:40.120
then it's easier for them to stay there.

2860
02:41:40.120 --> 02:41:45.120
But the easiest way to destroy a person's soul is to provide them their means in

2861
02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:49.450
a lottery,
cause them to suffer and to find their own way through life.

2862
02:41:49.910 --> 02:41:54.400
They will have no personal development character.
Right.
And the welfare state.

2863
02:41:54.520 --> 02:41:59.200
Right.
And I think that there's lots of good intentions that that crew,
you know,

2864
02:41:59.201 --> 02:42:03.280
the path to hell is paved on good intentions.
So there's a lot of desire to,

2865
02:42:03.670 --> 02:42:05.470
to help people.
And you know,
there's uh,

2866
02:42:05.950 --> 02:42:10.300
doing these more market based approaches like having,
um,
you know,

2867
02:42:10.301 --> 02:42:13.510
social support networks being driven more at the local level instead of the

2868
02:42:13.511 --> 02:42:16.080
federal level and stuff like that.
So,
you know,
there,

2869
02:42:16.081 --> 02:42:20.170
there's a been this thing floating around like the Cato Institute for ages where

2870
02:42:20.470 --> 02:42:24.310
instead of paying like 50% of my taxes to the federal government like I'm doing

2871
02:42:24.311 --> 02:42:27.010
now,
if I pay to a local five oh one,

2872
02:42:27.011 --> 02:42:31.470
three c a local nonprofit than it's dollar for dollar reduces my,

2873
02:42:31.480 --> 02:42:35.170
my tax burden at the federal level.
And then how,
you know,

2874
02:42:35.171 --> 02:42:39.220
a local nonprofit is going to be transparent,
it's going to be efficient.

2875
02:42:39.460 --> 02:42:40.750
If they shit the bed on something,

2876
02:42:40.751 --> 02:42:43.990
you can shut them down and pull your money and put it someplace else.

2877
02:42:44.380 --> 02:42:45.790
And you know,
there's,

2878
02:42:45.820 --> 02:42:50.770
there's a lot of other ways besides just expanding government it to get things

2879
02:42:50.771 --> 02:42:52.030
done and to take care of people.

2880
02:42:52.031 --> 02:42:56.890
And people look at this kind of libertarian idea as being cruel and,

2881
02:42:56.891 --> 02:42:59.200
and uh,
Makaveli and you know that some,

2882
02:42:59.470 --> 02:43:01.540
some people are going to be winners and losers losers.

2883
02:43:01.780 --> 02:43:02.980
That will always be the case.

2884
02:43:02.981 --> 02:43:07.981
But if we create a vibrant society with freedom and we respect each other's

2885
02:43:08.830 --> 02:43:10.450
rights and even if we don't agree,

2886
02:43:10.451 --> 02:43:13.450
we don't fucking each other over the differences and stuff like that,

2887
02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:16.840
you've got a really amazing thing that could happen from that.
And I'm,

2888
02:43:16.841 --> 02:43:21.100
I'm optimistic even while we've got drones flying overhead even.

2889
02:43:21.101 --> 02:43:24.310
Well we've got another move by our supposedly,
you know,

2890
02:43:24.311 --> 02:43:27.490
hope and change oriented president that wants you,
you know,

2891
02:43:27.491 --> 02:43:31.780
that is oriented towards more Internet suppression and more Internet monitoring.

2892
02:43:31.781 --> 02:43:34.950
Like it is really scary shit.
And um,

2893
02:43:35.010 --> 02:43:38.530
it's just wacky to me whether you're on the more liberal side or on the more

2894
02:43:38.531 --> 02:43:39.910
right wing conservative side,

2895
02:43:40.210 --> 02:43:43.960
the stuff that people will rally behind but not see the cracks and the

2896
02:43:43.990 --> 02:43:46.870
methodology.
It,
it's crazy to me.
I don't understand it

2897
02:43:47.310 --> 02:43:47.461
<v 0>well.</v>

2898
02:43:47.461 --> 02:43:51.270
I think people just don't look into it that deeply and they're usually really

2899
02:43:51.271 --> 02:43:52.110
fucking busy.

2900
02:43:52.111 --> 02:43:55.560
So what they do is subscribe to an ideology that makes them feel good.

2901
02:43:55.770 --> 02:43:57.510
Whether it's a Christian God love,

2902
02:43:57.511 --> 02:44:01.050
and I'm a second amendment believer and you know how many of them ever,

2903
02:44:01.080 --> 02:44:04.790
ever even looked into it.
They just give me my God,
that's my gun.
I mean,

2904
02:44:04.791 --> 02:44:08.310
are you really looking at it?
Realistically?
I support the second amendment,

2905
02:44:08.311 --> 02:44:10.410
but I mean,
how many people really should have guns?

2906
02:44:10.560 --> 02:44:14.220
How many people are fucking morons?
Right?
How many people shouldn't have cars?

2907
02:44:14.460 --> 02:44:14.850
I mean,

2908
02:44:14.850 --> 02:44:18.690
it's like we've made it so easy for someone to have the ability to use something

2909
02:44:18.691 --> 02:44:23.190
as crazy as a car.
And I was joking around about,
um,
I love American cars.

2910
02:44:23.191 --> 02:44:26.820
I love like American muscle cars.
I love that.
I mean,
it's ridiculous,

2911
02:44:26.821 --> 02:44:28.590
but I love that.
Like Shelby,

2912
02:44:28.830 --> 02:44:33.780
they're making a new Shelby gt 500 with 660 horsepower.

2913
02:44:34.110 --> 02:44:35.310
That's insane.

2914
02:44:35.460 --> 02:44:39.510
The idea that someone would need 660 fucking horsepower in a street car.

2915
02:44:39.750 --> 02:44:42.060
But I love the fact that you can get it right.

2916
02:44:42.061 --> 02:44:45.630
I love the fact that you can be a fucking idiot with 10 speeding tickets,

2917
02:44:45.631 --> 02:44:49.950
15 fucking crack,
as long as your insured and you have whatever it,

2918
02:44:49.951 --> 02:44:53.130
it costs 80 grand or where the fucking as you can go to a Ford dealership and

2919
02:44:53.131 --> 02:44:58.131
get by yourself a goddamn 2013 Shelby gt 500 and just drive like a maniac until

2920
02:44:58.891 --> 02:45:00.390
they pull you over and arrest you.
Right?

2921
02:45:00.420 --> 02:45:02.970
I mean it's something designed to break the law.

2922
02:45:03.210 --> 02:45:06.480
It's bright red and white stripes on it.

2923
02:45:06.481 --> 02:45:11.130
It sounds like war and it's got 660 fucking horsepower.

2924
02:45:11.400 --> 02:45:14.640
I love that you can just do that,
but really you shouldn't be able to,

2925
02:45:15.120 --> 02:45:15.840
you know really.

2926
02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:19.950
It is kind of fucking crazy that we allow some asshole could be texting to have

2927
02:45:19.951 --> 02:45:23.100
a 660 horsepower just Burt.
We trust them.

2928
02:45:23.101 --> 02:45:24.540
We trust them to have their shit together.

2929
02:45:25.290 --> 02:45:30.290
We have to figure out a way to make it so that you have to overcome something to

2930
02:45:30.841 --> 02:45:33.000
achieve success.
In order to feed yourself,

2931
02:45:33.001 --> 02:45:35.700
you've got to do some work in order to,
you know,

2932
02:45:35.730 --> 02:45:38.610
improve your environment and your surroundings.

2933
02:45:38.611 --> 02:45:42.210
You have to put forth some effort and when we make it so that people just get

2934
02:45:42.211 --> 02:45:43.110
checks for nothing,

2935
02:45:43.140 --> 02:45:47.820
that is like the complete opposite of the natural behavioral response,

2936
02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:51.780
Natural Award system that's set up for human means and it makes us fat cunts.

2937
02:45:52.410 --> 02:45:54.570
Yeah.
I mean it steals our soul.
Yeah.

2938
02:45:54.630 --> 02:45:57.540
And so you're really not helping people in that situation,

2939
02:45:57.660 --> 02:46:02.100
but how do you fix that though?
Once it's in place,
do you force grandma to work,

2940
02:46:02.101 --> 02:46:04.320
pitch,
get up,
you're going to starve to death.

2941
02:46:04.600 --> 02:46:08.770
<v 3>You know,
like there's a lot of things like,
like instead of uh,
uh,
you know,</v>

2942
02:46:08.771 --> 02:46:10.820
your going into a government pool,

2943
02:46:10.821 --> 02:46:15.170
maybe you manage your own health savings account and 401k and some people may

2944
02:46:15.171 --> 02:46:19.850
shit the bed and then you may,
you may,
you may be reliant on the,
the uh,

2945
02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:25.010
you know,
church is five oh one three c stuff like that.
You know,
I mean,
it,

2946
02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:28.850
not everybody,
it's impossible to ensure that everybody is not,

2947
02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:33.260
is going to be 100% taken care of it.
I think that that's a gut check for people.

2948
02:46:33.780 --> 02:46:35.960
They don't understand it.
You know,
like my,

2949
02:46:35.980 --> 02:46:40.130
my parents are unfortunately a good example.
Like my father was very smart,

2950
02:46:40.131 --> 02:46:43.040
but he chose not to do the things that he should have done.

2951
02:46:43.070 --> 02:46:45.680
And he could have had an engineering degree,

2952
02:46:45.710 --> 02:46:48.890
could have done drafting and stuff like that instead of just kind of fucked off.

2953
02:46:49.130 --> 02:46:53.210
And you really didn't have much in his later life.
And it's because,
you know,

2954
02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:56.480
inner child stuff,
you know,
whatever.
His father was a horrible person.

2955
02:46:56.481 --> 02:46:59.470
Like I get that.
Like I had a way better childhood than my dad did.
He,

2956
02:46:59.471 --> 02:47:01.550
he had it way more difficult than I did,

2957
02:47:01.610 --> 02:47:04.220
but he had choices that he could've made,

2958
02:47:04.221 --> 02:47:06.830
that would have provided for his family,
would have provided for himself.

2959
02:47:07.070 --> 02:47:10.010
And he chose not to do it.
And he had a really rough,
you know,

2960
02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:12.920
end of his life the last 15 years of his life sucked.

2961
02:47:12.980 --> 02:47:16.730
But he steered the boat that way,
you know?
And I just don't want to do that.

2962
02:47:17.210 --> 02:47:19.730
So it,
and I think that that's a gut check for people that

2963
02:47:20.730 --> 02:47:22.680
<v 0>they want a safety net.
They want a safety net.</v>

2964
02:47:22.710 --> 02:47:25.770
We want to be able to save everybody and they think that's what the government

2965
02:47:25.771 --> 02:47:26.460
is for.

2966
02:47:26.460 --> 02:47:29.250
The government is for a big pillow to make sure that you're going to be okay,

2967
02:47:29.430 --> 02:47:30.660
but when you tell people they're going to be okay,

2968
02:47:30.661 --> 02:47:32.850
they don't work as hard as when they don't know if they're going to be okay,

2969
02:47:33.790 --> 02:47:35.850
and that's what they need to do.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2970
02:47:35.880 --> 02:47:40.440
They need a little fear to motivate them.
Fuck yeah,
man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think,

2971
02:47:40.860 --> 02:47:43.020
I think we need that with everything.
You know?

2972
02:47:43.021 --> 02:47:46.590
I think everything in life is uncertain and you have to always embrace the idea

2973
02:47:46.591 --> 02:47:47.760
that you're a temporary being.

2974
02:47:47.761 --> 02:47:51.060
It's gonna sh the lights are shutting off no matter it's when fucking son

2975
02:47:51.061 --> 02:47:54.960
overcomes the earth is expansion.
The lights are shutting off.

2976
02:47:54.961 --> 02:47:58.830
You wasted in that bitch.
Right.
Get it together.
You mother fuckers,

2977
02:47:59.490 --> 02:48:01.190
Robb Wolf,
you're a bad motherfucker,
dude.

2978
02:48:01.191 --> 02:48:04.380
He dropped some serious knowledge on his podcast.
I really,
really appreciate it,

2979
02:48:04.381 --> 02:48:05.011
man.
Thank you man.

2980
02:48:05.011 --> 02:48:09.090
So informative and interesting and I bet we could probably do 10 of these,
right?

2981
02:48:09.480 --> 02:48:11.370
Tell me when you want me back and I'll do it again.

2982
02:48:11.580 --> 02:48:14.360
I'll bring the mixed drinks next time I'm bringing,
I'm,

2983
02:48:14.361 --> 02:48:16.950
I'm reading your book as of today and I'm going to get that shit.

2984
02:48:17.130 --> 02:48:20.670
I can't get it from audible.com you son of a bitch.
I'll get right on it.

2985
02:48:20.700 --> 02:48:25.650
So I'll send it to you before I send it to them.
I promise.
Get it from Amazon.

2986
02:48:25.651 --> 02:48:27.860
I'll get it from him.
I know.
I'll get it from Doug.
That's right,
right.

2987
02:48:27.930 --> 02:48:29.140
Get it from Doug G,

2988
02:48:29.170 --> 02:48:33.030
g e d but we want to thank audible.com for being our sponsor today.

2989
02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:37.200
We also want to thank Alienware supplying us with these dope ass laptops and if

2990
02:48:37.201 --> 02:48:39.150
you're really,
that would be the only,
only our sponsor,

2991
02:48:39.151 --> 02:48:42.540
but they hooked us up and if you are interested in gaming laptops,

2992
02:48:42.541 --> 02:48:44.160
you can't do any better than these Alienware things.

2993
02:48:44.160 --> 02:48:45.810
They're fucking giant bricks.

2994
02:48:45.811 --> 02:48:50.811
But the graphics power is fucking staggering already game.

2995
02:48:50.910 --> 02:48:52.320
The three d gaming is really cool.

2996
02:48:52.321 --> 02:48:55.080
I've been doing a lot of other shit and they support fighters and that's why we

2997
02:48:55.081 --> 02:48:58.140
support them.
Alien ware,
MMA on Twitter.
Go follow them.

2998
02:48:58.290 --> 02:49:00.450
Follow Robb Wolf on Twitter with two B's.

2999
02:49:00.451 --> 02:49:04.850
That's Robb Wolf on Twitter and thank you to audible.com and a,

3000
02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:09.570
if you go to audible podcast dot forward slash Joe Rogan,
you can,
uh,

3001
02:49:09.571 --> 02:49:14.460
I don't know.
I fucking,
something happens like,
guess shit happens.
Yeah,
I dunno.

3002
02:49:14.490 --> 02:49:18.600
I Dunno.
I think they get a free trial.
Something happens.
They give you something,

3003
02:49:18.630 --> 02:49:19.590
they'll give you some cool shit,

3004
02:49:19.710 --> 02:49:23.970
but it's a great service and I'm a huge fan of audible books,
audio books.

3005
02:49:24.450 --> 02:49:27.450
They're great to listen to in the car.
They literally make traffic dissolve.

3006
02:49:27.480 --> 02:49:29.660
All you think about is what you're hearing and the story.
It's,

3007
02:49:29.880 --> 02:49:33.960
it's a chance for you to instead listen some stupid gossip news or some

3008
02:49:33.961 --> 02:49:35.310
depressing shit about the world.

3009
02:49:35.430 --> 02:49:39.150
You can get lost in some cool fiction or some informative stuff.
Or you know,

3010
02:49:39.151 --> 02:49:43.080
you could,
uh,
listen to our friend Bobcat Goldthwait in his book.

3011
02:49:43.230 --> 02:49:46.040
I don't mean to insult you,
but you look like bobcat.
Both.
Wait,

3012
02:49:46.060 --> 02:49:49.350
that's my recommendation and one that has helped me tremendously,

3013
02:49:49.351 --> 02:49:53.640
the war of art by Steven Pressfield winning the inner creative battle.

3014
02:49:53.641 --> 02:49:57.600
It's a really amazing and inspirational book that I really enjoy and you can get

3015
02:49:57.601 --> 02:49:59.880
that from audible.com.
Thank you.

3016
02:49:59.881 --> 02:50:04.410
Also to [inaudible] dot com go to o n and it and use the code named rogue and

3017
02:50:04.411 --> 02:50:07.890
you will save 10% of all your supplements like Alpha brain,
new mood,

3018
02:50:08.010 --> 02:50:13.010
shroom tech sport with the quadriceps mushroom that we discussed earlier and a

3019
02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:17.910
shroom tech,
immune shroom tech,
whatever.
We need shrimp deck Dick hard.

3020
02:50:18.650 --> 02:50:21.820
And that's um,
that's the Combo.
You should do that,
man.
They're,

3021
02:50:22.030 --> 02:50:24.060
they're working on some shit from that spider.

3022
02:50:24.061 --> 02:50:26.250
That wandering spider that makes your Dick hard kills you.

3023
02:50:26.280 --> 02:50:29.220
They're working on some of that.
You know about that Chilean wandering spider.

3024
02:50:29.640 --> 02:50:33.990
The Brazilian wondering spider gives you,
uh,
when it stings you,

3025
02:50:33.991 --> 02:50:35.820
it kills more people than any spider in the world.

3026
02:50:36.060 --> 02:50:39.360
But it kills you by making your Dick hard.
It makes you,

3027
02:50:39.570 --> 02:50:42.540
it makes your whole body like stiff and rigid.

3028
02:50:42.541 --> 02:50:46.740
It says something to your nitric oxide and it gives you a hard on that if you

3029
02:50:46.741 --> 02:50:50.090
survive the bite,
which most people don't,
your Dick is broken forever.

3030
02:50:50.460 --> 02:50:54.180
It really blows up like a sausage on a grill.
It pops the casing.

3031
02:50:54.660 --> 02:50:56.550
This just sounds like all upside,

3032
02:50:57.840 --> 02:51:00.330
but they've got some pharmaceutical dude's trying to figure out how to use this.

3033
02:51:00.331 --> 02:51:01.980
Spiders properties.

3034
02:51:02.160 --> 02:51:05.370
It's probably be the next Spiderman movie in the Spiderman movie.

3035
02:51:05.371 --> 02:51:07.440
Everybody has a hundred on directions running,

3036
02:51:07.441 --> 02:51:11.490
screaming hard ons that explode a on at.com.

3037
02:51:11.520 --> 02:51:13.890
Oh and and it get yourself some kettle bells son.

3038
02:51:13.891 --> 02:51:18.690
Get all fucking manly like Robb wolf and get some battle ropes and all that good

3039
02:51:18.691 --> 02:51:21.000
shit.
Um,
uh,
but with the supplements,

3040
02:51:21.001 --> 02:51:23.820
you use the code name rogue and save yourself 10% off the kettle bells.

3041
02:51:23.821 --> 02:51:27.480
We are selling them as cheap as we humanly possibly can.
It is a crazy business.

3042
02:51:27.600 --> 02:51:29.640
I'm so sorry for all those ups drivers out there.

3043
02:51:29.641 --> 02:51:33.290
We're sending fucking cannon balls with handles through the mail.
Uh,

3044
02:51:33.300 --> 02:51:37.680
the battle ropes are the cheapest you can get on the Internet and that is a
fact.

3045
02:51:37.800 --> 02:51:41.280
They are the cheapest and the best at [inaudible] dot com go get some you dirty
