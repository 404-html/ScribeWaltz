<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.280
<v Speaker 1>I know you're going to be out there at the lake or the beach,</v>

9
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.510
<v Speaker 1>taking your clothes off,</v>

10
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.620
<v Speaker 1>trying to look sexy and your swimsuit and it's probably a disaster.</v>

14
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>N.</v>

15
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>N.</v>

16
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

17
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.431
<v Speaker 1>T.</v>

18
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>I've always been a big proponent of kettlebells because it's one of the first</v>

19
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 1>weightlifting things that I've ever done that allows me to kind of get like the</v>

20
00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:37.920
<v Speaker 1>whole workout in like a lot of times when I used to lift weights regular,</v>

21
00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:39.960
<v Speaker 1>I'd lift weights and then another day I do cardio.</v>

22
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.010
<v Speaker 1>I do one day weights,</v>

23
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.150
<v Speaker 1>one day cardio,</v>

24
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>but with a really good kettle bell workout,</v>

25
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>I get a brutal cardio workout and it allows me to get it all done in one shot.</v>

26
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan of them.</v>

27
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.390
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

28
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.550
<v Speaker 1>it's fun to do and it's a,</v>

29
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:58.551
<v Speaker 1>it makes you feel like some Russian savage living in Siberia back in the 1930s</v>

30
00:00:58.831 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>or whatever the fuck they invented.</v>

31
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:00.684
<v Speaker 1>These things,</v>

32
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.810
<v Speaker 1>what they are is it's like a cannon ball with a big metal handle on it and you</v>

33
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:04.800
<v Speaker 1>swing them around.</v>

34
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.661
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

35
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:05.950
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

36
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>in doing so and all these various exercises,</v>

37
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>you develop what they call functional strength,</v>

38
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.020
<v Speaker 1>meaning strength for your entire body,</v>

39
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>not isolated individual movements,</v>

40
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>but your entire body.</v>

41
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.173
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

42
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>did they have no chimp?</v>

43
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>Where's the Chin and say something's missing?</v>

44
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 1>The motherfuckers ran out of chimps ran away.</v>

45
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Now we must have run out.</v>

46
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Those fucking things sell like crazy.</v>

47
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.470
<v Speaker 1>That's the primal bells.</v>

48
00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:30.540
<v Speaker 1>The primal bells are these new kettle bells that we had.</v>

49
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>This is the most important thing.</v>

50
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.570
<v Speaker 1>They look cool as shit.</v>

51
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

52
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.590
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>

53
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>We have chimpanzees and then we also have zombies.</v>

54
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.730
<v Speaker 1>We have a apes rather.</v>

55
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.720
<v Speaker 1>We also have zombies.</v>

56
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:40.621
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

57
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:41.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

58
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>the most important things that they don't just look good,</v>

59
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>but that they're three d mapped.</v>

60
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.850
<v Speaker 1>What we have them is we made sure that all of the,</v>

61
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:49.690
<v Speaker 1>a kettle bells that you're getting there,</v>

62
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.240
<v Speaker 1>they're not imbalanced.</v>

63
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.800
<v Speaker 1>You can make a cool face,</v>

64
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.960
<v Speaker 1>but if the cool face wasn't balanced,</v>

65
00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:56.930
<v Speaker 1>it would kind of defeat the purpose of the kettle bell.</v>

66
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.440
<v Speaker 1>The whole idea about a kettle bells,</v>

67
00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:00.990
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be balanced when you move it so it looks bad ass,</v>

68
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:01.621
<v Speaker 1>but you get a,</v>

69
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:02.670
<v Speaker 1>like I use the uh,</v>

70
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 1>the gorilla and you get a really good workout with it.</v>

71
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.430
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't feel at all like a gimmick even when it slams into your arm with</v>

72
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.460
<v Speaker 1>gorilla face first.</v>

73
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:12.294
<v Speaker 1>If you're an idiot,</v>

74
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.800
<v Speaker 1>if you're not paying attention to how you swinging kettlebells,</v>

75
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.590
<v Speaker 1>one thing that I can,</v>

76
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

77
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>really not stress enough when it comes to this stuff.</v>

78
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.100
<v Speaker 1>If you're thinking about doing any kind of physical activity,</v>

79
00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:24.480
<v Speaker 1>if you've never worked out before,</v>

80
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.550
<v Speaker 1>you've got to do two things.</v>

81
00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>If you can,</v>

82
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.940
<v Speaker 1>the one thing,</v>

83
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.121
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

84
00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:30.620
<v Speaker 1>if you can part is hire a personal trainer.</v>

85
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Show you how to do the movements correctly.</v>

86
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.520
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

87
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 1>find out there's someone will do it for you.</v>

89
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.240
<v Speaker 1>Probably let you iPhone video it and let,</v>

90
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.390
<v Speaker 1>let someone you know,</v>

91
00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 1>show you how to do like a clean and press,</v>

92
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.430
<v Speaker 1>how to do a windmill.</v>

93
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:46.740
<v Speaker 1>How to do these things correctly and then videotape it.</v>

94
00:02:46.741 --> 00:02:49.110
<v Speaker 1>And then you could do it on your own and you could literally never have to go to</v>

95
00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:51.840
<v Speaker 1>a gym again with a chin up bar and a couple of kettle bells.</v>

96
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Like you can get ferocious workouts and on a daily basis,</v>

97
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>but start slow.</v>

98
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>It's if you're a meathead like me and in you're</v>

99
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 2>a dummy and you,</v>

100
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 2>if you know someone says,</v>

101
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

102
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 2>take three vitamins you like hope said,</v>

103
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:04.731
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>

104
00:03:04.731 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 2>farm and see what's up,</v>

105
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 2>you could hurt yourself with these things start slow.</v>

106
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 2>We have 35 pounders.</v>

107
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 2>We have 18 pounders,</v>

108
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 2>the howler monkeys,</v>

109
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 2>18 pounds.</v>

110
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

111
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 2>we go all the way up to 70 pounds with the primal bells.</v>

112
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 2>But if you're a real savage,</v>

113
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:22.210
<v Speaker 2>one of those bonafide fitness freaks,</v>

114
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:23.300
<v Speaker 2>like perhaps one of those cow,</v>

115
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 2>those crossfit dudes who,</v>

116
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

117
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 2>enter into those championships,</v>

118
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 2>that bitch ass 70 pounds probably not going to be enough for you.</v>

119
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.151
<v Speaker 2>If that's the case,</v>

120
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 2>we sell him even heavier.</v>

121
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 2>The heaviest ones we sell,</v>

122
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they do them.</v>

123
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 2>And kilograms,</v>

124
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.250
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's out of respect to mother Russia or some shit.</v>

125
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.910
<v Speaker 2>They all say kilogram foods anymore.</v>

126
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:44.420
<v Speaker 2>Whatever that means.</v>

127
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.621
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

128
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:45.580
<v Speaker 2>we got rid of food,</v>

129
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Speaker 2>but it's now it's still in kilogram.</v>

130
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.441
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

131
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:49.000
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is 40 kilograms?</v>

132
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:49.631
<v Speaker 2>Let's find out.</v>

133
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:50.464
<v Speaker 2>Let's tell people,</v>

134
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 2>I think it's 88 pounds.</v>

135
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 2>Let's see here that they would do that.</v>

136
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

137
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 2>it seems odd for Americans.</v>

138
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.600
<v Speaker 2>What is 40 kilograms and power?</v>

139
00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.981
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

140
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:01.180
<v Speaker 2>it's 88 pounds.</v>

141
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.650
<v Speaker 2>So that's the heaviest one we have.</v>

142
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:04.910
<v Speaker 2>If you could throw around in 88 pound Kettlebell,</v>

143
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.450
<v Speaker 2>you are some kind of man,</v>

144
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.920
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

145
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.580
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else starts slow,</v>

146
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 2>be healthy.</v>

147
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.051
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>

148
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 2>it's my favorite all time method of just physical exercise.</v>

149
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

150
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

151
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.860
<v Speaker 2>without martial arts being the obvious number one,</v>

152
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 2>but just for regular exercise,</v>

153
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.720
<v Speaker 2>kettlebells are the shit and it feels good.</v>

154
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 2>It feels good when you do them.</v>

155
00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:24.071
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

156
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:24.904
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>

157
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:25.340
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

158
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

159
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.010
<v Speaker 2>you're stretching out a lot and a lot of the moment.</v>

160
00:04:28.011 --> 00:04:30.820
<v Speaker 2>So it's got almost like a yoga sort of a vibe to it.</v>

161
00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 2>Like windmills,</v>

162
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.591
<v Speaker 2>windmills,</v>

163
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 2>or some of my favorite things to do with super good for your core and your back</v>

164
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

165
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

166
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:37.840
<v Speaker 2>do them slow.</v>

167
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.590
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

168
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.921
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

169
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:40.130
<v Speaker 2>if you're interested in any of the audits,</v>

170
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.661
<v Speaker 2>supplements,</v>

171
00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:44.800
<v Speaker 2>use the Codeword Rogan and you will save 10% off any and all supplements.</v>

172
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.131
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

173
00:04:45.131 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 2>Crash from the float lab is here,</v>

174
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:47.404
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

175
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.010
<v Speaker 2>So without any further ado and no more fuckery of foot,</v>

176
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:52.743
<v Speaker 2>let's get rolling.</v>

177
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

178
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:56.900
<v Speaker 2>good experience.</v>

179
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.060
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

180
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.100
<v Speaker 2>hey ladies and gentlemen,</v>

181
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:09.550
<v Speaker 2>for many of you who've heard this podcast before,</v>

182
00:05:09.551 --> 00:05:13.510
<v Speaker 2>you're aware of a thing that I'm really into called the sensory deprivation</v>

183
00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:14.344
<v Speaker 2>tank.</v>

184
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.120
<v Speaker 2>And the Sempra sensory deprivation tank was invented by a guy named John Lilly</v>

185
00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:21.310
<v Speaker 2>who was a scientist and a real freak,</v>

186
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.021
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

187
00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:23.950
<v Speaker 2>a guy who is just really out there,</v>

188
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.570
<v Speaker 2>really fascinating guy.</v>

189
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.130
<v Speaker 2>And he wrote a book that,</v>

190
00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:27.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

191
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.960
<v Speaker 2>I picked it up on,</v>

192
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.650
<v Speaker 2>I think like amazon.com like the used books that they'll sell young,</v>

193
00:05:33.651 --> 00:05:34.091
<v Speaker 2>like people,</v>

194
00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:34.601
<v Speaker 2>sellers,</v>

195
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:36.980
<v Speaker 2>individual sellers are selling and it's a,</v>

196
00:05:36.981 --> 00:05:37.900
<v Speaker 2>the deep self.</v>

197
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.650
<v Speaker 2>And in it he talks about the benefits of the tank,</v>

198
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.310
<v Speaker 2>it detailed construction on how to make your own tank.</v>

199
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:48.580
<v Speaker 2>He's got like diagrams in it and just really,</v>

200
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:49.870
<v Speaker 2>really fascinating guy.</v>

201
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.910
<v Speaker 2>And he was into all sorts of weird altered states of consciousness.</v>

202
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.610
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that he wanted to figure out was how to separate</v>

203
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 1>the body from the senses.</v>

204
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 1>And he came up with a bunch of different designs.</v>

205
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 1>There's a movie altered states that's kind of very loosely based on,</v>

206
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

207
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.580
<v Speaker 1>the idea of a guy like him going completely haywire and becoming like a monkey.</v>

208
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Just that's how I got into sensory deprivation tanks.</v>

209
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I saw altered states and they,</v>

210
00:06:19.261 --> 00:06:19.471
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

211
00:06:19.471 --> 00:06:22.580
<v Speaker 1>they were historically fairly accurate in the design of the tanks.</v>

212
00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 1>The initial one that you saw in altered states showed what lily at first came up</v>

213
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:26.721
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

214
00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:31.721
<v Speaker 1>which was like a glass scuba helmet that sort of suspended them in regular water</v>

215
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.630
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

216
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 1>he would actually Poop and pee into it.</v>

217
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.400
<v Speaker 1>He had like some crazy filtration system so he could stay in there and not have</v>

218
00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:41.690
<v Speaker 1>to defecate or urinate.</v>

219
00:06:41.691 --> 00:06:43.730
<v Speaker 1>So it would go through some system that he had created.</v>

220
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:44.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

221
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.433
<v Speaker 1>this dude was gone.</v>

222
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.000
<v Speaker 1>He was off the deep end.</v>

223
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's about as off the deep as,</v>

224
00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.671
<v Speaker 1>as ever.</v>

225
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:50.690
<v Speaker 1>But his,</v>

226
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.720
<v Speaker 1>his big thing was to try to figure out how you can get the mind free of the</v>

227
00:06:56.151 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 1>influence of the body.</v>

228
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.420
<v Speaker 1>And the best method he came up to was this idea of the tank.</v>

229
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:07.190
<v Speaker 1>And he figured out eventually to put salt water in it and that if you put enough</v>

230
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:07.911
<v Speaker 1>absence salts,</v>

231
00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 1>your body would float and then he could maintain the,</v>

232
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.120
<v Speaker 1>the heating temperature to essentially what's the same temperature is just</v>

233
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.040
<v Speaker 1>surface your skin and you wouldn't be able to recognize where the water was and</v>

234
00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:23.240
<v Speaker 1>it would give you the sensation of complete sensory deprivation.</v>

235
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.660
<v Speaker 1>And he figured this out.</v>

236
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.710
<v Speaker 1>And from that point on til like,</v>

237
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.191
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

238
00:07:31.191 --> 00:07:32.024
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean</v>

239
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.660
<v Speaker 1>I met you in,</v>

240
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.420
<v Speaker 1>what was it like how many years ago?</v>

241
00:07:37.421 --> 00:07:39.470
<v Speaker 1>Is it a five or six?</v>

242
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Probably five or six years ago.</v>

243
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:41.151
<v Speaker 1>Before that,</v>

244
00:07:41.151 --> 00:07:42.950
<v Speaker 1>I had that other gentlemen who,</v>

245
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:43.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

246
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.300
<v Speaker 1>used to repair tanks for somebody who's a great guy and he,</v>

247
00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:49.160
<v Speaker 1>he told me about you and,</v>

248
00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:49.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

249
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.730
<v Speaker 1>the guy was fixing my Samadi tank and my somebody tank,</v>

250
00:07:51.731 --> 00:07:53.180
<v Speaker 1>it fucked up something,</v>

251
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:53.781
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

252
00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:55.610
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the tank to fucked up was the heater,</v>

253
00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:57.320
<v Speaker 1>like it burnt through the,</v>

254
00:07:57.321 --> 00:07:57.471
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

255
00:07:57.471 --> 00:08:01.590
<v Speaker 1>the lining of the waterbed and it's shorted out the whole thing.</v>

256
00:08:01.591 --> 00:08:02.450
<v Speaker 1>It was a disaster.</v>

257
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes those heating yell messages,</v>

258
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.273
<v Speaker 1>they'll pop,</v>

259
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:05.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

260
00:08:05.901 --> 00:08:09.500
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason there's the cook and it just melted a hole through the</v>

261
00:08:09.501 --> 00:08:09.711
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

262
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:10.550
<v Speaker 1>So he had to repair it,</v>

263
00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:13.250
<v Speaker 1>he to repair the lining and while he's repairing the lining,</v>

264
00:08:13.251 --> 00:08:13.581
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

265
00:08:13.581 --> 00:08:13.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

266
00:08:13.821 --> 00:08:18.821
<v Speaker 1>there's this guy in Venice that makes these like really high tech tanks and he</v>

267
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:20.061
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

268
00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:21.290
<v Speaker 1>you should contact him.</v>

269
00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:22.160
<v Speaker 1>His name is crash.</v>

270
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.600
<v Speaker 1>She's kind of an interesting guy.</v>

271
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:24.861
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

272
00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:25.694
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

273
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.220
<v Speaker 1>I s I asked him about it and uh,</v>

274
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:32.390
<v Speaker 1>he went into depth about all the crazy shit that you had done to these tanks and</v>

275
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:33.061
<v Speaker 1>what they looked like.</v>

276
00:08:33.061 --> 00:08:34.740
<v Speaker 1>And he sent me to your website and I saw the train.</v>

277
00:08:34.741 --> 00:08:36.740
<v Speaker 1>And this is pre the standup tanks.</v>

278
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.250
<v Speaker 1>They were still like smaller like um,</v>

279
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.480
<v Speaker 1>ones like Samadhi.</v>

280
00:08:41.481 --> 00:08:44.510
<v Speaker 1>But way better constructed you,</v>

281
00:08:44.511 --> 00:08:47.330
<v Speaker 1>you had figured out how to do it where it was just like this,</v>

282
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.100
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a meat locker.</v>

283
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's so solid and well built and all your crazy filtration system and</v>

284
00:08:53.901 --> 00:08:54.171
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

285
00:08:54.171 --> 00:08:59.171
<v Speaker 1>And I realized that you were this one lone dude out there who's innovating and</v>

286
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:02.580
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of forgotten business.</v>

287
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.550
<v Speaker 1>This sort of forgotten aspect of uh,</v>

288
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.863
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

289
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:07.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

290
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.870
<v Speaker 1>of modern day understanding of the mind.</v>

291
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.011
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really,</v>

292
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:12.930
<v Speaker 1>it was ignored somehow or another.</v>

293
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened.</v>

294
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how all these scientists and geniuses missed out on the sensory</v>

295
00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:20.160
<v Speaker 1>deprivation tank promotion.</v>

296
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.800
<v Speaker 1>They should have been talking about it everywhere.</v>

297
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:27.830
<v Speaker 1>It is a mind blowing evolution in,</v>

298
00:09:27.981 --> 00:09:29.040
<v Speaker 1>in meditation.</v>

299
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:33.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a mind blowing next step in meditation where you instantaneously go.</v>

300
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.030
<v Speaker 1>If you get good enough at it and you do it long enough,</v>

301
00:09:36.031 --> 00:09:38.520
<v Speaker 1>you instantaneously can go to psychedelic states,</v>

302
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.040
<v Speaker 1>intense introspective,</v>

303
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:41.791
<v Speaker 1>objective,</v>

304
00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:43.470
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic states that are there.</v>

305
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:43.791
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

306
00:09:43.791 --> 00:09:44.160
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

307
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.510
<v Speaker 1>they change your life.</v>

308
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.150
<v Speaker 1>They fundamentally changed the way you think about life.</v>

309
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that these people aren't promoting this because it's not a drug,</v>

310
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:52.260
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

311
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.730
<v Speaker 1>it's totally safe.</v>

312
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.560
<v Speaker 1>It's totally easy to acquire.</v>

313
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:56.221
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

314
00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:57.120
<v Speaker 1>it's totally,</v>

315
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

316
00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:57.600
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

317
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:57.800
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

318
00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.531
<v Speaker 1>it ends.</v>

319
00:09:58.531 --> 00:09:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Anytime you want,</v>

320
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.470
<v Speaker 1>you open the door to get out and it's over.</v>

321
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.240
<v Speaker 1>There's no repercussions.</v>

322
00:10:03.241 --> 00:10:04.320
<v Speaker 1>There's no weirdness to it.</v>

323
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:08.700
<v Speaker 1>You instantaneously drift back into normal consciousness that no one's talking</v>

324
00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:09.240
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

325
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:09.980
<v Speaker 1>No one was doing.</v>

326
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:10.321
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

327
00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:15.030
<v Speaker 1>and I found you and Brian created this a video.</v>

328
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Brian was the guy who made that video where we went down to the basement and</v>

329
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:20.720
<v Speaker 1>videotape the,</v>

330
00:10:20.721 --> 00:10:20.871
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

331
00:10:20.871 --> 00:10:21.704
<v Speaker 1>the tank.</v>

332
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:22.291
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

333
00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:22.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

334
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:23.070
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

335
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.360
<v Speaker 1>from that video on,</v>

336
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.910
<v Speaker 1>we started hearing more and more people opening up the centers.</v>

337
00:10:29.911 --> 00:10:30.900
<v Speaker 1>They started going crazy.</v>

338
00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:34.020
<v Speaker 1>They started opening up all over the place and you continue to innovate.</v>

339
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.430
<v Speaker 1>And you haven't said a word yet,</v>

340
00:10:35.431 --> 00:10:35.841
<v Speaker 1>by the way of,</v>

341
00:10:35.841 --> 00:10:36.430

00:10:36.821 --> 00:10:37.060
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

345
00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:37.920
<v Speaker 4>even after I'm here,</v>

346
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:38.740
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

347
00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm just nodding my head.</v>

348
00:10:40.031 --> 00:10:40.420
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

349
00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.100
<v Speaker 4>you're doing such a good job at the,</v>

350
00:10:42.101 --> 00:10:42.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

351
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.320
<v Speaker 4>at your appraisal of the situation that,</v>

352
00:10:44.321 --> 00:10:45.154
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

353
00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:45.461
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

354
00:10:45.461 --> 00:10:46.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to dilute it.</v>

355
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.220
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

356
00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:47.440
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

357
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.750
<v Speaker 4>I just feel like I'm not at all,</v>

358
00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:50.290
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

359
00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm really enjoying this because you are the guy that six years ago,</v>

360
00:10:53.711 --> 00:10:56.140
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was that first understood that too.</v>

361
00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.090
<v Speaker 4>Not only was I out there,</v>

362
00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:58.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

363
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.010
<v Speaker 4>kinda standing around by myself,</v>

364
00:11:00.011 --> 00:11:01.480
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

365
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:02.741
<v Speaker 4>when I,</v>

366
00:11:02.741 --> 00:11:03.700
<v Speaker 4>when I found you,</v>

367
00:11:03.701 --> 00:11:07.600
<v Speaker 4>then that really escalated the exposure in general,</v>

368
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:12.040
<v Speaker 4>not just isn't for me or it has to do with the industry overall.</v>

369
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 4>Once that,</v>

370
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:13.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

371
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:14.363
<v Speaker 4>you became,</v>

372
00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.011
<v Speaker 4>because you're,</v>

373
00:11:15.011 --> 00:11:17.260
<v Speaker 4>you're an honest guy and your opinion,</v>

374
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:18.730
<v Speaker 4>people trust it.</v>

375
00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:19.531
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

376
00:11:19.531 --> 00:11:21.250
<v Speaker 4>and when you say something then that,</v>

377
00:11:21.251 --> 00:11:22.084
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

378
00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:23.950
<v Speaker 4>it has a value.</v>

379
00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:24.870
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

380
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.010
<v Speaker 4>there's other been people say,</v>

381

00:11:26.471 --> 00:11:27.304
<v Speaker 4>that whatever,</v>

384
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:28.780
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't have that,</v>

385
00:11:28.781 --> 00:11:30.040
<v Speaker 4>that sincerity.</v>

386
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:30.873
<v Speaker 4>The uh,</v>

387
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.631
<v Speaker 4>the true,</v>

388
00:11:31.631 --> 00:11:32.464
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

389
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:32.921
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

390
00:11:32.921 --> 00:11:33.250
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

391
00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:33.630
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

392
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:33.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

393
00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.290
<v Speaker 4>what you believe type thing.</v>

394
00:11:35.291 --> 00:11:37.630
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of times influenced by this or that.</v>

395
00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:39.140
<v Speaker 4>But once you,</v>

396
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

397
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:39.770
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

398
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:40.391
<v Speaker 4>and you've been,</v>

399
00:11:40.391 --> 00:11:40.781
<v Speaker 4>like I say,</v>

400
00:11:40.781 --> 00:11:44.620
<v Speaker 4>even with the device thing was a big thing with this in the Hamilton Morris.</v>

401
00:11:44.621 --> 00:11:45.220
<v Speaker 4>It was great.</v>

402
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:45.881
<v Speaker 4>He's credible.</v>

403
00:11:45.881 --> 00:11:46.571
<v Speaker 4>And without you,</v>

404
00:11:46.571 --> 00:11:47.560
<v Speaker 4>that wouldn't have happened.</v>

405
00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.130
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

406
00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:52.060
<v Speaker 4>it's just a in that these things help out everybody right now because the</v>

407
00:11:52.061 --> 00:11:53.940
<v Speaker 4>industry deserves a,</v>

408
00:11:53.941 --> 00:11:55.750
<v Speaker 4>a opportunity to,</v>

409
00:11:55.751 --> 00:11:56.260
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

410
00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:01.260
<v Speaker 4>to expand and become available to people in general because it is an important</v>

411
00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:06.700
<v Speaker 4>thing to a person that's in the process of considering what it is that they're</v>

412
00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:07.750
<v Speaker 4>doing with themselves,</v>

413
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:08.050
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

414
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.630
<v Speaker 4>which I think is very important for people to,</v>

415
00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:11.464
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

416
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.050
<v Speaker 4>take responsibility for their actions and what,</v>

417
00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:14.311
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

418
00:12:14.311 --> 00:12:14.680
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

419
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.180
<v Speaker 4>what they do and what they say.</v>

420
00:12:16.181 --> 00:12:16.701
<v Speaker 4>Cause you know,</v>

421
00:12:16.701 --> 00:12:17.200
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

422
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:17.771
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

423
00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:18.370
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

424
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.390
<v Speaker 4>you're free to do that.</v>

425
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:19.541
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

426
00:12:19.541 --> 00:12:19.781
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

427
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:21.220
<v Speaker 4>you're allowed to be different.</v>

428
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.720
<v Speaker 4>You're allowed to go ahead and say,</v>

429
00:12:22.721 --> 00:12:23.554
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

430
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:26.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't think this is quite the way that I,</v>

431
00:12:26.291 --> 00:12:26.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

432
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.530
<v Speaker 4>in the vista becoming actually more popular now.</v>

433
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.650
<v Speaker 4>This is like freaky people that are able to go out say,</v>

434
00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:33.101
<v Speaker 4>oh well hey,</v>

436
00:12:33.551 --> 00:12:33.911
<v Speaker 4>and they're going,</v>

437
00:12:33.911 --> 00:12:34.600
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

438
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.710
<v Speaker 4>they're doing all kinds of weird stuff.</v>

439
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what a Palati is.</v>

440
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:40.120
<v Speaker 4>It's catching on,</v>

441
00:12:40.121 --> 00:12:40.301
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

442
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:40.450
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

443
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:40.860
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

444
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:41.200
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

445
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:41.740
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

446
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's just our neighborhood or,</v>

447
00:12:43.231 --> 00:12:43.341
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

448
00:12:43.341 --> 00:12:44.380
<v Speaker 4>It is a labor there.</v>

449
00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:49.330
<v Speaker 4>The different yogas spinning all these different activities that,</v>

450
00:12:49.331 --> 00:12:49.661
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

451
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:50.230
<v Speaker 4>that are,</v>

452
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:55.230
<v Speaker 4>that people do in a lot of the crossover to currently it's based on these</v>

453
00:12:55.421 --> 00:12:56.840
<v Speaker 4>athletes that,</v>

454
00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.550
<v Speaker 4>that you have contact with or that respect your perspective or whatever.</v>

455
00:13:00.551 --> 00:13:01.384
<v Speaker 4>And they show up.</v>

456
00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.300
<v Speaker 4>That Guy Jeremy Stevens was here the other day again.</v>

457
00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:04.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

458
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.450
<v Speaker 4>And then I watched him on a clip.</v>

459
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:08.531
<v Speaker 4>I don't know when that is.</v>

460
00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:09.100
<v Speaker 4>What was fun?</v>

461
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.700
<v Speaker 4>It was this past week that when he got that guy down fight,</v>

462
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:12.900
<v Speaker 4>he kicked him and then no,</v>

463
00:13:12.901 --> 00:13:12.981
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

464
00:13:12.981 --> 00:13:13.121
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

465
00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:15.260
<v Speaker 4>That was a knock out that he had in the previous fight.</v>

466
00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:16.000
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

467
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.380
<v Speaker 4>I just saw that the other day.</v>

468
00:13:17.381 --> 00:13:17.950
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

469
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:18.520
<v Speaker 4>he uh,</v>

470
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.260
<v Speaker 4>he uh,</v>

471
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.560
<v Speaker 4>did you guys that was in Brazil.</v>

472
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

473
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:22.053
<v Speaker 4>Incredible.</v>

474
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:23.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

475
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Great Guy.</v>

476
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.940
<v Speaker 1>All those guys smart too.</v>

477
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

478
00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:27.380
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

479
00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.070
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those guys who were surprisingly nice and surprising.</v>

480
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Smart.</v>

481
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:34.340
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people have this idea about people that are involved in combat</v>

482
00:13:34.341 --> 00:13:36.350
<v Speaker 1>sports that they're mean or they're assholes.</v>

483
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.620
<v Speaker 4>Quite the contrary,</v>

484
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.980
<v Speaker 4>I find you'd be some of the most level,</v>

485
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:41.903
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

486
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.100
<v Speaker 4>well adjusted people that come in contact with.</v>

487
00:13:44.101 --> 00:13:47.130
<v Speaker 4>They're not trying to prove anything because they're already secure with who</v>

488
00:13:47.131 --> 00:13:47.964
<v Speaker 4>they are.</v>

489
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:48.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

490
00:13:48.341 --> 00:13:49.390
<v Speaker 1>they're more level.</v>

491
00:13:49.391 --> 00:13:51.010
<v Speaker 1>That's the best way of of putting it.</v>

492
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Like cause you're forced to get your ego checked on a super regular basis and</v>

493
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.050
<v Speaker 1>when that happens you kind of,</v>

494
00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.110
<v Speaker 1>you just have a better view of things,</v>

495
00:13:59.111 --> 00:13:59.944
<v Speaker 1>you know you don't,</v>

496
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.580
<v Speaker 1>people were constantly afraid of losing and when you're a fighter,</v>

497
00:14:03.581 --> 00:14:07.600
<v Speaker 1>you lose in the gym all the time and you kind of mellow that out.</v>

498
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.670
<v Speaker 1>You get an understanding of who you are and you,</v>

499
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.910
<v Speaker 1>and also the blowing off of the energy in the gym.</v>

500
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:13.471
<v Speaker 1>You just see,</v>

501
00:14:13.471 --> 00:14:14.350
<v Speaker 1>feel so much better.</v>

502
00:14:14.351 --> 00:14:15.250
<v Speaker 1>You're more chill,</v>

503
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:16.630
<v Speaker 1>more relaxed about stuff.</v>

504
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:17.920
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of people,</v>

505
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:20.820
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what their stress is is that their bodies,</v>

506
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:21.663
<v Speaker 1>a battery,</v>

507
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.670
<v Speaker 1>their bodies building up all this energy and it never gets exerted until you're</v>

508
00:14:24.671 --> 00:14:25.900
<v Speaker 1>taken in all this food.</v>

509
00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:26.500
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

510
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.210
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting in a cubicle,</v>

511
00:14:28.211 --> 00:14:29.710
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting in your car,</v>

512
00:14:29.711 --> 00:14:31.090
<v Speaker 1>you're sitting at the movies,</v>

513
00:14:31.091 --> 00:14:34.540
<v Speaker 1>you are constantly sitting and not doing anything and he just irritable.</v>

514
00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.940
<v Speaker 1>You're body's just trying to fuck dude,</v>

515
00:14:36.941 --> 00:14:38.140
<v Speaker 1>you fucking move.</v>

516
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Get something going.</v>

517
00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:40.144
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

518
00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.730
<v Speaker 1>we've got all this shit pent up and then someone would get in front of your</v>

519
00:14:42.731 --> 00:14:43.564
<v Speaker 1>traffic.</v>

520
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:44.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

521
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.660
<v Speaker 1>when people wonder where that's coming from,</v>

522
00:14:46.661 --> 00:14:47.670
<v Speaker 1>well that's coming from your,</v>

523
00:14:47.671 --> 00:14:49.120
<v Speaker 1>your all backed up.</v>

524
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:49.961
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

525
00:14:49.961 --> 00:14:50.221
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

526
00:14:50.221 --> 00:14:51.054
<v Speaker 1>you are backed.</v>

527
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.470
<v Speaker 1>I know there's nothing scientific whatsoever to what a trigger is short on.</v>

528
00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:55.041
<v Speaker 1>Some of us,</v>

529
00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:55.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

530
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.360
<v Speaker 1>pretty uh,</v>

531
00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:56.961
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>

532
00:14:56.961 --> 00:14:57.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

533
00:14:57.231 --> 00:14:59.870
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting your endorphins and kind of calm you down.</v>

534
00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:05.080
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the tank represents a level of that in some way that I think</v>

535
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:06.330
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>

536
00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:10.850
<v Speaker 1>it's a thing that should not just be something that people,</v>

537
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.770
<v Speaker 1>it becomes popular but po something that it becomes popular in,</v>

538
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:18.650
<v Speaker 1>in a way where people get a chance to,</v>

539
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.770
<v Speaker 1>to do a new thing that they could get excited about.</v>

540
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Which is one of the things that people like with like pilates or yoga,</v>

541
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:28.340
<v Speaker 1>a new thing that they could be excited about that could benefit them mentally,</v>

542
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:31.940
<v Speaker 1>which is where I think we were missing out on a lot of this stuff.</v>

543
00:15:31.941 --> 00:15:33.920
<v Speaker 1>I think yoga does benefit you mentally.</v>

544
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I think it calms you down and it's very good for you physically.</v>

545
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.690
<v Speaker 1>But the physical aspect of the mental aspect coincide with the tank.</v>

546
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:42.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a hundred percent mental,</v>

547
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:44.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird,</v>

548
00:15:44.001 --> 00:15:45.080
<v Speaker 1>weird experience.</v>

549
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Plus it's available for it for a human being to actually participate in this</v>

550
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.850
<v Speaker 1>meditation where you sit in a room with your legs crossed and you're supposed to</v>

551
00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:53.840
<v Speaker 1>check out somehow.</v>

552
00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:54.560
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

553
00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.700
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that,</v>

554
00:15:55.701 --> 00:15:59.510
<v Speaker 1>but I go sit in that box for a couple of few hours and go all kinds of different</v>

555
00:15:59.511 --> 00:15:59.830
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

556
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

557
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.570
<v Speaker 1>you know the beditation is possible.</v>

558
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.010
<v Speaker 1>I know that there's people that do that,</v>

559
00:16:04.011 --> 00:16:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Kundalini Yoga and they have these intense psychedelic visions and I believe</v>

560
00:16:07.911 --> 00:16:09.980
<v Speaker 1>that 100% because you,</v>

561
00:16:09.981 --> 00:16:10.400
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

562
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.020
<v Speaker 1>you do have indogenous chemicals that the brain produces that can give you</v>

563
00:16:15.021 --> 00:16:18.750
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experiences like we know about diamond field trip to me and,</v>

564
00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.120
<v Speaker 1>and we know about five minute thoughts.</v>

565
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.850
<v Speaker 1>He'd die muscle the trip to me being produced by the human body.</v>

566
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:24.740
<v Speaker 1>So if those are being produced by the body,</v>

567
00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:29.870
<v Speaker 1>this could easily be some ancient method of stimulating that production of</v>

568
00:16:29.871 --> 00:16:32.750
<v Speaker 1>releasing some sort of a burst of that production.</v>

569
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:35.540
<v Speaker 1>And so these super coon Delaney masters,</v>

570
00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.850
<v Speaker 1>which seems like it would be something you would want to do,</v>

571
00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:38.840
<v Speaker 1>but for whatever reason,</v>

572
00:16:38.841 --> 00:16:39.674
<v Speaker 1>I'm not compelled.</v>

573
00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:40.830
<v Speaker 1>She Shit,</v>

574
00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:42.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm not compelled enough to learn it,</v>

575
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:46.610
<v Speaker 1>but they can experience natural DMT trips at the highest levels of their art</v>

576
00:16:46.611 --> 00:16:47.444
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>

577
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:48.283
<v Speaker 1>which I believe,</v>

578
00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.360
<v Speaker 1>I think you just got to get really good at sitting there.</v>

579
00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Then you just get a really good at yoga positions.</v>

580
00:16:52.971 --> 00:16:54.800
<v Speaker 1>You got to get really good at meditating.</v>

581
00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:59.330
<v Speaker 1>They got to get really good at just getting good enough at yoga physically that</v>

582
00:16:59.331 --> 00:17:01.520
<v Speaker 1>you could just sort of fallen into these forms.</v>

583
00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.150
<v Speaker 1>And then when you're falling into these forms and supporting yourself in some</v>

584
00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:06.020
<v Speaker 1>way by,</v>

585
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.570
<v Speaker 1>by making your body work like that,</v>

586
00:17:08.571 --> 00:17:13.571
<v Speaker 1>you like heightened your expression to whatever it is that yoga is trying to tap</v>

587
00:17:13.731 --> 00:17:14.091
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>

588
00:17:14.091 --> 00:17:17.240
<v Speaker 1>And it's very psychedelic but still not the tank.</v>

589
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:21.020
<v Speaker 1>And it's difficult for me because I'm too,</v>

590
00:17:21.021 --> 00:17:21.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

591
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:22.320
<v Speaker 1>too wound up to,</v>

592
00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.200
<v Speaker 1>I can't sit somewhere and just sit there.</v>

593
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.371
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

594
00:17:24.371 --> 00:17:25.340
<v Speaker 1>but if you tried,</v>

595
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.170
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could force yourself.</v>

596
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:27.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

597
00:17:27.321 --> 00:17:28.400
<v Speaker 1>it would have to force me,</v>

598
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:28.711
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

599
00:17:28.711 --> 00:17:29.544
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose,</v>

600
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.390
<v Speaker 1>do you think that would be good for you to force yourself to that?</v>

601
00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.501
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the,</v>

602
00:17:33.501 --> 00:17:33.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

603
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.400
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

604
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.240
<v Speaker 1>it's just not in my,</v>

605
00:17:35.241 --> 00:17:35.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

606
00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:35.991
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

607
00:17:35.991 --> 00:17:38.210
<v Speaker 1>another way that I operate,</v>

608
00:17:38.211 --> 00:17:38.631
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

609
00:17:38.631 --> 00:17:39.350
<v Speaker 1>I have a operating,</v>

610
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.100
<v Speaker 1>when I'm awake,</v>

611
00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:41.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at like,</v>

612
00:17:41.001 --> 00:17:43.700
<v Speaker 1>even when I'm out snowboarding or they're riding my,</v>

613
00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:44.420
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

614
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.253
<v Speaker 1>I don't wear the,</v>

615
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.420
<v Speaker 1>your earphones or whatever,</v>

616
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:48.110
<v Speaker 1>if I'm right,</v>

617
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.680
<v Speaker 1>I need to listen to what's happening.</v>

618
00:17:49.681 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Man's</v>

619
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:50.910
<v Speaker 5>all like all the time.</v>

620
00:17:50.911 --> 00:17:53.190
<v Speaker 5>So it's so distractive,</v>

621
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.053
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

622
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:54.810
<v Speaker 5>in general,</v>

623
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:59.190
<v Speaker 5>but in their cuts everything off and I go straight into my head and there's</v>

624
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:00.870
<v Speaker 5>nothing else there except for that.</v>

625
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:01.670
<v Speaker 5>I see what you're saying.</v>

626
00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Two about the physical.</v>

627
00:18:02.631 --> 00:18:06.530
<v Speaker 1>For some folks they just did not interested in doing anything that's really</v>

628
00:18:06.531 --> 00:18:08.120
<v Speaker 1>physically strenuous.</v>

629
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:09.380
<v Speaker 1>I totally understand that.</v>

630
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.230
<v Speaker 1>And that energy winds up being,</v>

631
00:18:12.231 --> 00:18:13.910
<v Speaker 1>they distribute that energy to their work.</v>

632
00:18:13.911 --> 00:18:14.481
<v Speaker 1>Like you do.</v>

633
00:18:14.481 --> 00:18:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Like you're kind of a,</v>

634
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:20.660
<v Speaker 1>just a mad fiend with your work and your constant improvements and innovations</v>

635
00:18:20.661 --> 00:18:21.321
<v Speaker 1>to all this stuff.</v>

636
00:18:21.321 --> 00:18:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

637
00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:22.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

638
00:18:22.281 --> 00:18:26.330
<v Speaker 1>your energy goes where your energy is probably best suited.</v>

639
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:27.051
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

640
00:18:27.051 --> 00:18:27.201
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

641
00:18:27.201 --> 00:18:28.400
<v Speaker 1>it's not the same for everybody.</v>

642
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:29.260
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm trying to say,</v>

643
00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.780
<v Speaker 5>some people have extra time or they're,</v>

644
00:18:30.781 --> 00:18:34.730
<v Speaker 5>they're in the process or a pursuit and that's a viable,</v>

645
00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.190
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

646
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.650
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

647
00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:36.700
<v Speaker 5>method of expression.</v>

648
00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.560
<v Speaker 5>That's a good way to meet chicks with nice legs.</v>

649
00:18:38.561 --> 00:18:42.640
<v Speaker 5>That's what I think [inaudible] probably the most advantageous.</v>

650
00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:44.760
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise,</v>

651
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.610
<v Speaker 5>why are they going,</v>

652
00:18:45.611 --> 00:18:47.940
<v Speaker 5>where's a beaker of yoga where it's all sweaty there and there,</v>

653
00:18:47.941 --> 00:18:49.150
<v Speaker 5>there's a 400 degrees and you go,</v>

654
00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:49.511
<v Speaker 5>Oh wow,</v>

655
00:18:49.511 --> 00:18:50.410
<v Speaker 5>this is a lot of fun.</v>

656
00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.900
<v Speaker 5>Having sex with a room full of people,</v>

657
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.370
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

658
00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:54.880
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

659
00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.320
<v Speaker 5>it's the strangest thing ever.</v>

660
00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.890
<v Speaker 5>And I see with all these things in mind that the chamber doesn't sound so bad.</v>

661
00:18:59.891 --> 00:19:00.724
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

662
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:01.530
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

663
00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:04.570
<v Speaker 5>just go in this thing and lay down there and all of a sudden you'll have the</v>

664
00:19:04.571 --> 00:19:06.670
<v Speaker 5>ability to tap into yourself.</v>

665
00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.421
<v Speaker 5>I liked both,</v>

666
00:19:07.421 --> 00:19:07.680
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

667
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.280
<v Speaker 5>I really do like doing yoga.</v>

668
00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.810
<v Speaker 5>We let you go a pump up.</v>

669
00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to get me one of those.</v>

670
00:19:12.041 --> 00:19:12.940
<v Speaker 5>A gorilla,</v>

671
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.631
<v Speaker 5>a couple of those.</v>

672
00:19:13.631 --> 00:19:14.450
<v Speaker 5>A catalog.</v>

673
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:14.950
<v Speaker 5>I was it.</v>

674
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:15.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

675
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.910
<v Speaker 5>I like all what you just had to say about that starts small though.</v>

676
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:19.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

677
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.570
<v Speaker 5>I can get a baby gorilla or something to do any exercises.</v>

678
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:23.463
<v Speaker 5>No nothing.</v>

679
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.130
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>

680
00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:25.360
<v Speaker 5>I go up and down the stairs.</v>

681
00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:26.253
<v Speaker 5>That works.</v>

682
00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.130
<v Speaker 5>That's something.</v>

683
00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:27.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

684
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.150
<v Speaker 5>And I walk and that is a decision that</v>

685
00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.360
<v Speaker 1>people don't realize.</v>

686
00:19:31.361 --> 00:19:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Like if you get to the airport and every time there's a stairway,</v>

687
00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:35.230
<v Speaker 1>he forced herself to take the stairway.</v>

688
00:19:35.231 --> 00:19:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Every time there's,</v>

689
00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

690
00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:40.240
<v Speaker 1>escalator or you avoid that and get the stares that just,</v>

691
00:19:40.241 --> 00:19:42.910
<v Speaker 1>that alone will make your trip just slightly better.</v>

692
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:43.411
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

693
00:19:43.411 --> 00:19:44.980
<v Speaker 5>Just get a little blood flow in your body.</v>

694
00:19:44.981 --> 00:19:46.320
<v Speaker 5>I that triple sonic too.</v>

695
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.081
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever get on here?</v>

696
00:19:47.081 --> 00:19:47.341
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

697
00:19:47.341 --> 00:19:47.551
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

698
00:19:47.551 --> 00:19:48.210
<v Speaker 5>I got that.</v>

699
00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:48.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

700
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.120
<v Speaker 5>I got it from you.</v>

701
00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:49.953
<v Speaker 5>That's fine.</v>

702
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.770
<v Speaker 5>I got on that once in a while cause I don't like that.</v>

703
00:19:51.771 --> 00:19:52.900
<v Speaker 5>That donut top was there.</v>

704
00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:53.611
<v Speaker 5>The muffin,</v>

705
00:19:53.611 --> 00:19:54.900
<v Speaker 5>a muffin top.</v>

706
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:58.290
<v Speaker 5>I don't like to have that thing so I gotta make helps you lose weight.</v>

707
00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.190
<v Speaker 5>It'll get,</v>

708
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.851
<v Speaker 5>I don't do it,</v>

709
00:19:59.851 --> 00:20:03.960
<v Speaker 5>you know too much for my stomach sit ups or something like this to try to get</v>

710
00:20:03.961 --> 00:20:05.550
<v Speaker 5>that from a collecting down there.</v>

711
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.200
<v Speaker 5>But standing on that thing,</v>

712
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.400
<v Speaker 5>it kind of helps,</v>

713
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.450
<v Speaker 5>I think at least psychologically believe it's something undoing for exercise.</v>

714
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:16.350
<v Speaker 5>Wasn't that thing invented for Russian cosmonauts to keep them in orbit?</v>

715
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:16.981
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

716
00:20:16.981 --> 00:20:18.190
<v Speaker 5>I think that they were uh,</v>

717
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:23.300
<v Speaker 5>having issues with a muscle deterioration and the atrophy or whatever.</v>

718
00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:25.201
<v Speaker 5>So they,</v>

719
00:20:25.201 --> 00:20:25.530
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

720
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:29.310
<v Speaker 5>I guess incorporated this a system of vibration into the,</v>

721
00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:32.610
<v Speaker 5>a strengthening of their muscles apparently,</v>

722
00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:33.960
<v Speaker 5>but I don't really know.</v>

723
00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.100
<v Speaker 5>It seems like,</v>

724
00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:36.060
<v Speaker 5>well where did they take it?</v>

725
00:20:36.061 --> 00:20:39.390
<v Speaker 5>Did they take it up in the ship with 'em or whether it's a good question,</v>

726
00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.830
<v Speaker 5>stop off somewhere at the,</v>

727
00:20:40.831 --> 00:20:41.431
<v Speaker 5>at the place,</v>

728
00:20:41.431 --> 00:20:41.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

729
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.890
<v Speaker 5>in check because you'd have to have gravity to use it.</v>

730
00:20:43.891 --> 00:20:44.724
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

731
00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:45.631
<v Speaker 5>Where's it at?</v>

732
00:20:45.631 --> 00:20:46.000
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

733
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.510
<v Speaker 5>sort of electricity seems like a bulky piece to bring up with you if you're</v>

734
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.950
<v Speaker 5>limited amount of space,</v>

735
00:20:50.951 --> 00:20:51.251
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

736
00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:51.710
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

737
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.730
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't it all also seemed that you um,</v>

738
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.380
<v Speaker 5>if you did use it up in space,</v>

739
00:20:56.381 --> 00:20:57.214
<v Speaker 5>if it wouldn't work.</v>

740
00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:57.461
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

741
00:20:57.461 --> 00:20:58.630
<v Speaker 5>Cause it shoots you right up.</v>

742
00:20:58.631 --> 00:21:00.430
<v Speaker 5>Maybe who knows who don't have any resistance.</v>

743
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:00.601
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

744
00:21:00.601 --> 00:21:01.490
<v Speaker 5>You have the gravity.</v>

745
00:21:01.491 --> 00:21:02.380
<v Speaker 5>It's like half the thing.</v>

746
00:21:02.381 --> 00:21:02.830
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

747
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.570
<v Speaker 5>I think that's the principle that it's working with</v>

748
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.600
<v Speaker 5>parish then would work fine.</v>

749
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.830
<v Speaker 5>It took a chamber up there to space.</v>

750
00:21:08.831 --> 00:21:10.570
<v Speaker 5>You won't have to use as much salt there or something.</v>

751
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.620
<v Speaker 5>I think it feels good.</v>

752
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.920
<v Speaker 5>That's why I like it by the vibrating on it and I don't know.</v>

753
00:21:14.921 --> 00:21:16.090
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's to do with anything.</v>

754
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:20.110
<v Speaker 5>I think I feel it's like a little body massage when I get on there.</v>

755
00:21:20.111 --> 00:21:21.430
<v Speaker 5>And for folks who don't know what it is,</v>

756
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:25.600
<v Speaker 5>it's like some sort of a giant speaker but it doesn't make sound,</v>

757
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:26.710
<v Speaker 5>it just sends its a,</v>

758
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.310
<v Speaker 5>its such,</v>

759
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:29.920
<v Speaker 5>so we're describe it sends like sonic waves,</v>

760
00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:30.580
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

761
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:30.851
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

762
00:21:30.851 --> 00:21:32.800
<v Speaker 5>It moves you up down and it's the voice coil,</v>

763
00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:33.930
<v Speaker 5>which like us,</v>

764
00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.850
<v Speaker 5>it's like a speaker as a voice call and there's a cone on it.</v>

765
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:38.770
<v Speaker 5>Then the voice called moves the cone up and down.</v>

766
00:21:38.771 --> 00:21:39.760
<v Speaker 5>That creates a sound wave.</v>

767
00:21:39.761 --> 00:21:39.941
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

768
00:21:39.941 --> 00:21:40.390
<v Speaker 5>those happened,</v>

769
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:41.560
<v Speaker 5>cone has platform.</v>

770
00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.170
<v Speaker 5>So it moves you up and down if variety of frequency.</v>

771
00:21:44.171 --> 00:21:47.140
<v Speaker 5>So it kind of runs you through a pattern and yeah.</v>

772
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:48.550
<v Speaker 5>Then you could dial it up and say,</v>

773
00:21:48.551 --> 00:21:50.410
<v Speaker 5>oh I wanted this is supposed to do this or that.</v>

774
00:21:50.411 --> 00:21:51.040
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

775
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.810
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was gonna be big a hit be a big hit.</v>

776
00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:53.051
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

777
00:21:53.051 --> 00:21:53.740
<v Speaker 5>cause it,</v>

778
00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.900
<v Speaker 5>I think it has something to do with that fat ass syndrome.</v>

779
00:21:55.901 --> 00:21:56.141
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

780
00:21:56.141 --> 00:21:58.240
<v Speaker 5>are there people that get that going on from too much?</v>

781
00:21:58.241 --> 00:21:59.890
<v Speaker 5>Is it stopping off at the wrong places?</v>

782
00:21:59.891 --> 00:22:00.161
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

783
00:22:00.161 --> 00:22:01.840
<v Speaker 5>and I don't know if the turtle sign,</v>

784
00:22:01.841 --> 00:22:02.674
<v Speaker 5>I can fix that.</v>

785
00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.340
<v Speaker 5>That's a good start to it.</v>

786
00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.320
<v Speaker 5>So I think they should,</v>

787
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.810
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

788
00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:06.180
<v Speaker 5>eat,</v>

789
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:09.160
<v Speaker 5>eat less of that shit and work out a little bit.</v>

790
00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:12.010
<v Speaker 5>But what I do know about it is whatever it does,</v>

791
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:12.970
<v Speaker 5>it feels good.</v>

792
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:13.751
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

793
00:22:13.751 --> 00:22:14.584
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

794
00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:16.000
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why it feels good.</v>

795
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:16.953
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure,</v>

796
00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.040
<v Speaker 5>but it feels like a little,</v>

797
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.210
<v Speaker 5>and you're getting vibrated.</v>

798
00:22:19.211 --> 00:22:20.410
<v Speaker 5>It feels like a little massage.</v>

799
00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:20.650
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

800
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:21.400
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

801
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:21.521
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

802
00:22:21.521 --> 00:22:23.020
<v Speaker 5>you can believe something's happening.</v>

803
00:22:23.021 --> 00:22:23.231
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

804
00:22:23.231 --> 00:22:24.520
<v Speaker 5>I don't know exactly what's going on,</v>

805
00:22:24.521 --> 00:22:27.490
<v Speaker 5>but it seems to be something that was already the variations too.</v>

806
00:22:27.491 --> 00:22:28.121
<v Speaker 5>It's really cool.</v>

807
00:22:28.121 --> 00:22:32.200
<v Speaker 5>It's just a cycle where it'll go really fast and really slow and then so it</v>

808
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.820
<v Speaker 5>keeps you kind of interested in it.</v>

809
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:34.691
<v Speaker 5>And it's supposed to,</v>

810
00:22:34.691 --> 00:22:35.530
<v Speaker 5>by doing that,</v>

811
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:40.450
<v Speaker 5>it's supposed to be stimulating individual Glam and get your flow going.</v>

812
00:22:40.451 --> 00:22:40.811
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

813
00:22:40.811 --> 00:22:41.350
<v Speaker 5>you're uh,</v>

814
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:42.580
<v Speaker 5>like you were saying about that,</v>

815
00:22:42.581 --> 00:22:46.000
<v Speaker 5>working up like that and you've got to get your body in motion.</v>

816
00:22:46.001 --> 00:22:46.301
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

817
00:22:46.301 --> 00:22:47.111
<v Speaker 5>I think people,</v>

818
00:22:47.111 --> 00:22:50.170
<v Speaker 5>they sit too long in a chair all day long without moving around.</v>

819
00:22:50.171 --> 00:22:51.340
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it was probably not that good.</v>

820
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:51.581
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

821
00:22:51.581 --> 00:22:53.050
<v Speaker 5>we've talked about it a million times.</v>

822
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.550
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing is just</v>

823
00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:59.650
<v Speaker 5>sitting in an office as a fucking terrible way to live your life.</v>

824
00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.210
<v Speaker 5>It's supposed to be super bad for you.</v>

825
00:23:01.211 --> 00:23:02.290
<v Speaker 5>As I sit in an office,</v>

826
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.101
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

827
00:23:03.101 --> 00:23:03.371
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

828
00:23:03.371 --> 00:23:03.721
<v Speaker 5>it's a wheel.</v>

829
00:23:03.721 --> 00:23:05.380
<v Speaker 5>They do it at like three hours at a pop.</v>

830
00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.000
<v Speaker 5>And even then I get up and I'm like,</v>

831
00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:09.251
<v Speaker 5>I have an office.</v>

832
00:23:09.251 --> 00:23:10.360
<v Speaker 5>I sit in my office every day,</v>

833
00:23:10.361 --> 00:23:12.250
<v Speaker 5>all day long and going to get out of it and go back to it.</v>

834
00:23:12.251 --> 00:23:12.770
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

835
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:14.050
<v Speaker 5>in our office is how you set it up.</v>

836
00:23:14.051 --> 00:23:14.291
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

837
00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:15.700
<v Speaker 5>See this is okay to sit around here.</v>

838
00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:16.920
<v Speaker 5>This is a fine office.</v>

839
00:23:16.921 --> 00:23:17.200
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

840
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:17.490
<v Speaker 5>Nice.</v>

841
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:19.480
<v Speaker 5>Is it that they get that they're horrible.</v>

842
00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:20.111
<v Speaker 5>Lied.</v>

843
00:23:20.111 --> 00:23:20.801
<v Speaker 5>And then there's this,</v>

844
00:23:20.801 --> 00:23:21.400
<v Speaker 5>there's the,</v>

845
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.320
<v Speaker 5>there's the rules and you've got a suit on.</v>

846
00:23:23.321 --> 00:23:23.980
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

847
00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:24.910
<v Speaker 5>they're sitting in the office.</v>

848
00:23:24.911 --> 00:23:26.440
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing represents a bummer.</v>

849
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.690
<v Speaker 5>Do you think you have to do that to people to get them to work?</v>

850
00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.090
<v Speaker 5>Do you have to make them wear a suit to get them to work?</v>

851
00:23:31.091 --> 00:23:31.581
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you,</v>

852
00:23:31.581 --> 00:23:34.270
<v Speaker 5>if you let people wear t shirts and jeans and shit,</v>

853
00:23:34.271 --> 00:23:36.760
<v Speaker 5>would they take insurance as seriously as they do?</v>

854
00:23:36.761 --> 00:23:37.241
<v Speaker 5>If they're aware,</v>

855
00:23:37.241 --> 00:23:38.590
<v Speaker 5>that goofy monkey suit,</v>

856
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:39.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

857
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.550
<v Speaker 5>would they stick to the company line when they're on the phone giving those,</v>

858
00:23:42.551 --> 00:23:42.970
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

859
00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:44.170
<v Speaker 5>those pep speaks.</v>

860
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.400
<v Speaker 5>You wonder what image they're trying to project.</v>

861
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:47.480
<v Speaker 4>What is it you're trying to,</v>

862
00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:48.483
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

863
00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.140
<v Speaker 2>sends Guy Mr. Crash.</v>

864
00:23:50.141 --> 00:23:50.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

865
00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

866
00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I look at my tie and I never swear why when I'm at the office,</v>

867
00:23:54.411 --> 00:23:55.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm completely approved</v>

868
00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:59.230

00:24:51.691 --> 00:24:53.490
<v Speaker 4>maybe not lifestyle that you know.</v>

902
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:54.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

903
00:24:54.311 --> 00:24:58.480
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of those weird guys that are like motivational speakers and they</v>

904
00:24:58.481 --> 00:25:01.960
<v Speaker 2>motivate you to come to their seminars and they make a fuck load of money from</v>

905
00:25:01.961 --> 00:25:02.794
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

906
00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:04.091
<v Speaker 2>from your mind.</v>

907
00:25:04.091 --> 00:25:04.331
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

908
00:25:04.331 --> 00:25:06.580
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute that you had a boat fishing.</v>

909
00:25:06.581 --> 00:25:07.351
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>

910
00:25:07.351 --> 00:25:09.610
<v Speaker 2>And it seems like you were still hanging out here at this place.</v>

911
00:25:09.611 --> 00:25:10.630
<v Speaker 2>This is a bummer in here.</v>

912
00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.070
<v Speaker 2>I can hardly wait to leave.</v>

913
00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.300
<v Speaker 2>This is your day,</v>

914
00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:14.200
<v Speaker 2>you know you're getting,</v>

915
00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:16.293
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

916
00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:19.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not the best way to live life for me.</v>

917
00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:19.661
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

918
00:25:19.661 --> 00:25:20.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad someone's doing it.</v>

919
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.380
<v Speaker 2>Always doing it.</v>

920
00:25:22.381 --> 00:25:24.370
<v Speaker 2>We would not have apple computers.</v>

921
00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:26.710
<v Speaker 2>You would not have Samsung phones.</v>

922
00:25:26.711 --> 00:25:28.660
<v Speaker 2>You would not have Audi cars.</v>

923
00:25:28.661 --> 00:25:30.010
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't have these things.</v>

924
00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:33.040
<v Speaker 2>If somebody wasn't out there busting their ass every day in an office,</v>

925
00:25:33.041 --> 00:25:33.850
<v Speaker 2>people like it.</v>

926
00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Some people are suited for that type of a,</v>

927
00:25:36.671 --> 00:25:37.061
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>

928
00:25:37.061 --> 00:25:37.711
<v Speaker 2>of a lifestyle.</v>

929
00:25:37.711 --> 00:25:40.870
<v Speaker 2>So maybe if we reach too many people with this message of get your shit</v>

930
00:25:40.871 --> 00:25:41.261
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

931
00:25:41.261 --> 00:25:43.360
<v Speaker 2>it'd be terrible for civilization as a whole.</v>

932
00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:43.830
<v Speaker 2>Overall,</v>

933
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:47.620
<v Speaker 2>this one would weaken us and like the Chinese would take over all this could be</v>

934
00:25:47.621 --> 00:25:48.080
<v Speaker 2>low.</v>

935
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:48.913
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a</v>

936
00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:51.100
<v Speaker 2>factor for that.</v>

937
00:25:51.101 --> 00:25:51.311
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

938
00:25:51.311 --> 00:25:52.061
<v Speaker 2>we're fucking it up.</v>

939
00:25:52.061 --> 00:25:54.790
<v Speaker 2>We're fucking it up with these goddamn isolation tanks and these medical</v>

940
00:25:54.791 --> 00:25:55.950
<v Speaker 2>marijuana dispensaries,</v>

941
00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:56.171
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

942
00:25:56.171 --> 00:25:59.100
<v Speaker 2>those are wonderful to reach the next day.</v>

943
00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:02.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to live are unnatural life.</v>

944
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.530
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to continue to build these buildings and launch these missiles</v>

945
00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:08.440
<v Speaker 2>if we don't continue to live on unnatural life?</v>

946
00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:10.660
<v Speaker 2>The more we tune in to the natural life,</v>

947
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:13.900
<v Speaker 2>the more we see how ridiculous it is when we wake up.</v>

948
00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:15.640
<v Speaker 2>It's coming our way.</v>

949
00:26:15.641 --> 00:26:18.130
<v Speaker 2>I think that people are coming around right now.</v>

950
00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.281
<v Speaker 4>It's happening.</v>

951
00:26:19.281 --> 00:26:20.120
<v Speaker 4>I think it is.</v>

952
00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.053
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right.</v>

953
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:24.110
<v Speaker 4>If you look at it like America is important,</v>

954
00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:24.381
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

955
00:26:24.381 --> 00:26:25.090
<v Speaker 4>even though I,</v>

956
00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:26.810
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a flag or nothing like that,</v>

957
00:26:26.811 --> 00:26:27.070
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

958
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:27.770
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>

959
00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:30.800
<v Speaker 4>it's where we live and it's kind of like where we're from and it's sort of like</v>

960
00:26:30.801 --> 00:26:31.700
<v Speaker 4>what we're supposed to be,</v>

961
00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:32.511
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

962
00:26:32.511 --> 00:26:32.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

963
00:26:32.781 --> 00:26:34.340
<v Speaker 4>proud about and you're supposed to say,</v>

964
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:35.203
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

965
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.103
<v Speaker 4>I'm from here.</v>

966
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:40.910
<v Speaker 4>And I'm really glad about that because where it is and the way they operate,</v>

967
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:42.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm Po,</v>

968
00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:43.620
<v Speaker 4>I go along with that.</v>

969
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.620
<v Speaker 4>But it's gotten too far now in my opinion,</v>

970
00:26:46.621 --> 00:26:46.951
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

971
00:26:46.951 --> 00:26:47.191
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

972
00:26:47.191 --> 00:26:48.024
<v Speaker 4>everybody's gone.</v>

973
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:51.750
<v Speaker 4>It needs to get to where the people actually get an overview again,</v>

974
00:26:51.751 --> 00:26:55.710
<v Speaker 4>where they start to evaluate situations and then make correct decisions based on</v>

975
00:26:55.711 --> 00:26:59.010
<v Speaker 4>now instead of like these prehistoric,</v>

976
00:26:59.030 --> 00:26:59.480
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

977
00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.970
<v Speaker 4>versions of what's got us to here need to be,</v>

978
00:27:02.971 --> 00:27:03.330
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

979
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:03.541
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

980
00:27:03.541 --> 00:27:08.290
<v Speaker 4>hopefully at some point let go with and get a new evaluation that's,</v>

981
00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:08.680
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

982
00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:08.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

983
00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:10.950
<v Speaker 4>pertains to where we're at now in the world.</v>

984
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.410
<v Speaker 4>What can we do now to get along with people?</v>

985
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.390
<v Speaker 4>How can we work together this,</v>

986
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.070
<v Speaker 4>even if these military see what the,</v>

987
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:20.220
<v Speaker 4>I think that we sell a lot of guns in this country and,</v>

988
00:27:20.221 --> 00:27:20.540
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

989
00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:21.440
<v Speaker 4>in pharmaceuticals.</v>

990
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:22.100
<v Speaker 4>So he said,</v>

991
00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:22.201
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

992
00:27:22.201 --> 00:27:24.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we're going to get out of the bomb business because it's our</v>

993
00:27:24.601 --> 00:27:25.081
<v Speaker 4>business,</v>

994
00:27:25.081 --> 00:27:25.261
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

995
00:27:25.261 --> 00:27:27.510
<v Speaker 4>so we have to figure out how to get these guys working,</v>

996
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:28.770
<v Speaker 4>doing something good,</v>

997
00:27:28.771 --> 00:27:28.951
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

998
00:27:28.951 --> 00:27:29.581
<v Speaker 4>so we don't like say,</v>

999
00:27:29.581 --> 00:27:29.791
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1000
00:27:29.791 --> 00:27:31.020
<v Speaker 4>all your jobs are gone now.</v>

1001
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.410
<v Speaker 4>Figure out how we could go in and do stuff together.</v>

1002
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:39.360
<v Speaker 4>Use our money and our resources to create situations that are beneficial for</v>

1003
00:27:39.361 --> 00:27:39.721
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1004
00:27:39.721 --> 00:27:40.554
<v Speaker 4>They're not gonna,</v>

1005
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.350
<v Speaker 4>we're not gonna make friends by shooting at people.</v>

1006
00:27:43.351 --> 00:27:43.991
<v Speaker 4>We all know that.</v>

1007
00:27:43.991 --> 00:27:44.311
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

1008
00:27:44.311 --> 00:27:45.030
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

1009
00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:45.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1010
00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.310
<v Speaker 4>this is some kind of a fictitious,</v>

1011
00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1012
00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.840
<v Speaker 4>a concept that we can go over and make people happy by,</v>

1013
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:51.511
<v Speaker 4>by killing them.</v>

1014
00:27:51.511 --> 00:27:52.340
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1015
00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:52.461
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1016
00:27:52.461 --> 00:27:56.960
<v Speaker 1>the concept of war being for financial benefit is still pretty alien to a lot of</v>

1017
00:27:56.961 --> 00:27:57.261
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>

1018
00:27:57.261 --> 00:27:58.094
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe it.</v>

1019
00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:01.000
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe that that's why wars are started.</v>

1020
00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1021
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1022
00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:07.730
<v Speaker 1>what all you'd have to consider is how much benefit there could have been done</v>

1023
00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:08.870
<v Speaker 1>to America.</v>

1024
00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.111
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1025
00:28:09.111 --> 00:28:13.340
<v Speaker 1>if you're really a pro America person and you really are a patriot,</v>

1026
00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:14.293
<v Speaker 1>think about what a,</v>

1027
00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:19.330
<v Speaker 1>what a benefit it would have been to America to take a lot of that money that</v>

1028
00:28:19.371 --> 00:28:22.700
<v Speaker 1>went to this crazy war that no one believes in anymore.</v>

1029
00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.830
<v Speaker 1>And try to clean up inner cities,</v>

1030
00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:26.120
<v Speaker 1>try to fix Chicago,</v>

1031
00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:26.983
<v Speaker 1>try to fix,</v>

1032
00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.820
<v Speaker 1>fix the border towns,</v>

1033
00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.140
<v Speaker 1>try to help Mexico.</v>

1034
00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:31.190
<v Speaker 1>How dangerous.</v>

1035
00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.850
<v Speaker 1>We have a dangerous situation like a hundred miles from us.</v>

1036
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1037
00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:36.110
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1038
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:37.040
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that?</v>

1039
00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.051
<v Speaker 1>You go to what it would it?</v>

1040
00:28:38.051 --> 00:28:38.600
<v Speaker 1>How long?</v>

1041
00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.830
<v Speaker 1>How far is it to San Diego?</v>

1042
00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:41.173
<v Speaker 1>It's two hours.</v>

1043
00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:42.980
<v Speaker 1>So what does that 120 miles,</v>

1044
00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:46.140
<v Speaker 1>something like that to 40 I think it's and are nearby.</v>

1045
00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:47.053
<v Speaker 1>How fast you going,</v>

1046
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:47.903
<v Speaker 1>bitch?</v>

1047
00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:53.020
<v Speaker 1>You're not going 130 miles an hour and you fucking retard when 41 4,140 miles.</v>

1048
00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:54.351
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1049
00:28:54.351 --> 00:28:56.300
<v Speaker 1>so 70 miles an hour for two hours.</v>

1050
00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:57.530
<v Speaker 1>That's Mexico.</v>

1051
00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.490
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1052
00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:01.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a two hour drive to third world country that's in turmoil.</v>

1053
00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.540
<v Speaker 1>And we don't do a God damn thing about it and we're sending people to someplace</v>

1054
00:29:05.541 --> 00:29:09.620
<v Speaker 1>that's so far removed from us that just coincidentally happens to have oil.</v>

1055
00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:10.550
<v Speaker 1>That's not why we're here.</v>

1056
00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.020
<v Speaker 1>That is not why we're here,</v>

1057
00:29:12.021 --> 00:29:12.854
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Crash,</v>

1058
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:14.910
<v Speaker 1>we're here to fix things like oil.</v>

1059
00:29:14.911 --> 00:29:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Fig is a funny one.</v>

1060
00:29:15.801 --> 00:29:16.970
<v Speaker 1>I got a mess over here.</v>

1061
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:21.950
<v Speaker 1>We have all these people that killed people in New York City from Saudi Arabia,</v>

1062
00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.440
<v Speaker 1>but we need to get over here and over here.</v>

1063
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:25.711
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what?</v>

1064
00:29:25.711 --> 00:29:28.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe that oil is fossil fuel.</v>

1065
00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:29.121
<v Speaker 4>They say,</v>

1066
00:29:29.121 --> 00:29:29.640
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1067
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.570
<v Speaker 4>it's from a fossil.</v>

1068
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:30.931
<v Speaker 4>You Think,</v>

1069
00:29:30.931 --> 00:29:31.051
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1070
00:29:31.051 --> 00:29:31.801
<v Speaker 4>I got fossils.</v>

1071
00:29:31.801 --> 00:29:32.634
<v Speaker 4>They're rocks.</v>

1072
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:33.301
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1073
00:29:33.301 --> 00:29:34.870
<v Speaker 4>It's pressure under the ground said,</v>

1074
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:35.010
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1075
00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:35.521
<v Speaker 4>so in other words,</v>

1076
00:29:35.521 --> 00:29:37.530
<v Speaker 4>he used to be the same dinosaurs out in the middle of the ocean.</v>

1077
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:37.801
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1078
00:29:37.801 --> 00:29:38.041
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

1079
00:29:38.041 --> 00:29:39.300
<v Speaker 1>do you think his last class anymore?</v>

1080
00:29:39.301 --> 00:29:40.920
<v Speaker 1>I think they think it's rotten plankton.</v>

1081
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1082
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 1>If at the top</v>

1083
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.120
<v Speaker 5>of the frozen Alps and the bottom of the ocean and over here in the desert and</v>

1084
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:47.021
<v Speaker 5>everywhere,</v>

1085
00:29:47.021 --> 00:29:48.600
<v Speaker 5>at one time there was plankton all over it,</v>

1086
00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:52.210
<v Speaker 5>an hour or whatever to make these gigantic puddles of this stuff that we're</v>

1087
00:29:52.211 --> 00:29:53.440
<v Speaker 5>pumping out for some reason.</v>

1088
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:54.640
<v Speaker 5>And then you say,</v>

1089
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.030
<v Speaker 5>oh look,</v>

1090
00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:55.863
<v Speaker 5>step back and say,</v>

1091
00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.300
<v Speaker 5>but from an alien,</v>

1092
00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:58.780
<v Speaker 5>what are those guys doing down there?</v>

1093
00:29:58.810 --> 00:29:59.051
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1094
00:29:59.051 --> 00:29:59.321
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1095
00:29:59.321 --> 00:29:59.571
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

1096
00:29:59.571 --> 00:29:59.781
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

1097
00:29:59.781 --> 00:30:01.120
<v Speaker 5>they're pumping this stuff out of there,</v>

1098
00:30:01.121 --> 00:30:02.160
<v Speaker 5>the oil they call it,</v>

1099
00:30:02.161 --> 00:30:03.700
<v Speaker 5>and then they turn it into a,</v>

1100
00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:05.230
<v Speaker 5>a plastic material that,</v>

1101
00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.400
<v Speaker 5>that litters the planet.</v>

1102
00:30:06.401 --> 00:30:09.460
<v Speaker 5>They can't get rid of it or they take it and then they burned it into the</v>

1103
00:30:09.461 --> 00:30:11.560
<v Speaker 5>atmosphere and poisoned themselves.</v>

1104
00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:12.280
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

1105
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.270
<v Speaker 5>and then what they do,</v>

1106
00:30:13.271 --> 00:30:17.230
<v Speaker 5>they spend all their money to fight amongst each other to see who gets control</v>

1107
00:30:17.231 --> 00:30:17.590
<v Speaker 5>of it.</v>

1108
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:20.230
<v Speaker 5>And you're thinking this whole stuff isn't really that necessary.</v>

1109
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:22.330
<v Speaker 5>It could be done without back to the hemp again,</v>

1110
00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.041
<v Speaker 5>look at that hemp,</v>

1111
00:30:23.041 --> 00:30:25.020
<v Speaker 5>but what it has to offer computer speaking.</v>

1112
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:25.721
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1113
00:30:25.721 --> 00:30:26.400
<v Speaker 5>it's just too hard,</v>

1114
00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.610
<v Speaker 5>too difficult to control.</v>

1115
00:30:27.611 --> 00:30:27.791
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1116
00:30:27.791 --> 00:30:29.710
<v Speaker 5>there was a book on the process of,</v>

1117
00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:30.580
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

1118
00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:35.320
<v Speaker 5>of oil being developed that they were trying to speculate somehow or another</v>

1119
00:30:35.321 --> 00:30:35.831
<v Speaker 5>that it was,</v>

1120
00:30:35.831 --> 00:30:36.664
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1121
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.220
<v Speaker 5>that it was developed through a natural process and the earth.</v>

1122
00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.880
<v Speaker 5>And they were saying that our ideas of it were incorrect,</v>

1123
00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:44.560
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think it was well received.</v>

1124
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:45.670
<v Speaker 5>I have the books,</v>

1125
00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:46.570
<v Speaker 5>I never read it.</v>

1126
00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:47.470
<v Speaker 5>I bought it and I was like,</v>

1127
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.440
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to read that one day and it just sat there and never fucking read it.</v>

1128
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:51.820
<v Speaker 5>I just couldn't get behind it.</v>

1129
00:30:51.821 --> 00:30:52.654
<v Speaker 5>It's just seemed,</v>

1130
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:56.950
<v Speaker 5>it seemed kind of goofy that anybody wouldn't have figured that out by now.</v>

1131
00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:58.870
<v Speaker 5>Exactly where you're going.</v>

1132
00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:00.003
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1133
00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.580
<v Speaker 5>That thing about the planets to how they're supposed to be circumcised and the</v>

1134
00:31:03.581 --> 00:31:03.880
<v Speaker 5>earth.</v>

1135
00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.713
<v Speaker 5>What the sun,</v>

1136
00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.830
<v Speaker 5>let's say the sun's moving,</v>

1137
00:31:05.831 --> 00:31:06.390
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1138
00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:07.240
<v Speaker 5>This is going this way.</v>

1139
00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:10.060
<v Speaker 5>So now they have a believer though that planets are circling the sun.</v>

1140
00:31:10.061 --> 00:31:10.480
<v Speaker 5>Is it?</v>

1141
00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.520
<v Speaker 5>I think that this makes more sense to me.</v>

1142
00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.601
<v Speaker 5>And there's other,</v>

1143
00:31:13.601 --> 00:31:13.871
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1144
00:31:13.871 --> 00:31:14.770
<v Speaker 5>this isn't my thought,</v>

1145
00:31:14.771 --> 00:31:15.604
<v Speaker 5>but somebody showed,</v>

1146
00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:16.421
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>

1147
00:31:16.421 --> 00:31:18.610
<v Speaker 5>that makes me say this sun is going this way.</v>

1148
00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:19.081
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1149
00:31:19.081 --> 00:31:22.810
<v Speaker 5>what makes us think we're not in rotation in a vortex being pulled by the sun</v>

1150
00:31:22.811 --> 00:31:23.644
<v Speaker 5>going somewhere.</v>

1151
00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:24.601
<v Speaker 5>I think we're,</v>

1152
00:31:24.601 --> 00:31:25.421
<v Speaker 5>we're on a trip,</v>

1153
00:31:25.421 --> 00:31:25.691
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1154
00:31:25.691 --> 00:31:26.051
<v Speaker 5>We're going.</v>

1155
00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:27.370
<v Speaker 5>So we started off where,</v>

1156
00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:30.220
<v Speaker 5>where was the sun a hundred years ago and where's it at now?</v>

1157
00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:31.620
<v Speaker 5>And then where are we going to be later on?</v>

1158
00:31:31.621 --> 00:31:34.670
<v Speaker 5>I believe the sun is pulling us through space and were in,</v>

1159
00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.340
<v Speaker 5>well that's not a belief.</v>

1160
00:31:36.341 --> 00:31:37.170
<v Speaker 5>That's a fact.</v>

1161
00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:39.070
<v Speaker 5>That's that's absolutely what's happening.</v>

1162
00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.660
<v Speaker 5>The whole galaxies moving.</v>

1163
00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:41.141
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1164
00:31:41.141 --> 00:31:41.351
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1165
00:31:41.351 --> 00:31:42.370
<v Speaker 5>this is something that,</v>

1166
00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:43.330
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1167
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:45.680
<v Speaker 5>astrophysicists have figured out a while ago.</v>

1168
00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:49.480
<v Speaker 5>So at the whole universe is kind of moving that just have expansion thing.</v>

1169
00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:50.170
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1170
00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:52.180
<v Speaker 5>I think we're going galaxies moving.</v>

1171
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:54.400
<v Speaker 5>I think we're going in a direction somewhere.</v>

1172
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:58.330
<v Speaker 5>I think that if we figured out where's The sun and where is it off too.</v>

1173
00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.070
<v Speaker 5>I think we're behind it.</v>

1174
00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:03.220
<v Speaker 5>I think that we're following it and this is the way the rotation,</v>

1175
00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.140
<v Speaker 5>I don't know which way is up or down in here.</v>

1176
00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.580
<v Speaker 5>Where's the north south?</v>

1177
00:32:06.581 --> 00:32:09.190
<v Speaker 5>That is exactly how it's supposed to be described.</v>

1178
00:32:09.191 --> 00:32:10.780
<v Speaker 5>I think as it goes,</v>

1179
00:32:10.781 --> 00:32:10.991
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1180
00:32:10.991 --> 00:32:12.190
<v Speaker 5>we're circling around it.</v>

1181
00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:13.810
<v Speaker 5>I think we're going to run it this way.</v>

1182
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:14.733
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1183
00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm too fucking stupid.</v>

1184
00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:16.871
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1185
00:32:16.871 --> 00:32:18.220
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand it at all.</v>

1186
00:32:18.221 --> 00:32:22.210
<v Speaker 5>I mean when I watched those scientific documentaries on space,</v>

1187
00:32:22.211 --> 00:32:26.170
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the most fascinating things ever and most fascinating so that it's</v>

1188
00:32:26.171 --> 00:32:28.480
<v Speaker 5>so rarely brought up in regular conversation.</v>

1189
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:32.200
<v Speaker 5>That's where some of this money should go into like expansion of the,</v>

1190
00:32:32.201 --> 00:32:33.910
<v Speaker 5>of the reality situation.</v>

1191
00:32:33.911 --> 00:32:34.331
<v Speaker 5>We're in here.</v>

1192
00:32:34.331 --> 00:32:34.570
<v Speaker 5>They said,</v>

1193
00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:35.060
<v Speaker 5>oh look,</v>

1194
00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.610
<v Speaker 5>we have this and that we can think about now,</v>

1195
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.320
<v Speaker 5>get these scientists challenge to put the phone down.</v>

1196
00:32:39.321 --> 00:32:39.890
<v Speaker 5>First off,</v>

1197
00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 5>put</v>

1198
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:44.190
<v Speaker 2>this on down enough on the phone is Jaeger counter designer.</v>

1199
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:47.000
<v Speaker 2>It tells you the name of the tune it's on.</v>

1200
00:32:47.001 --> 00:32:47.834
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1201
00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:48.921
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1202
00:32:48.921 --> 00:32:49.311
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1203
00:32:49.311 --> 00:32:52.070
<v Speaker 2>it's a fun and nobody answers it,</v>

1204
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:54.110
<v Speaker 2>which is what really freaks me out,</v>

1205
00:32:54.111 --> 00:32:54.321
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1206
00:32:54.321 --> 00:32:55.190
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

1207
00:32:55.191 --> 00:32:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Cause I've got to call everybody at night.</v>

1208
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.401
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>

1209
00:32:56.401 --> 00:32:56.571
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1210
00:32:56.571 --> 00:32:58.070
<v Speaker 2>don't forget to come down tomorrow.</v>

1211
00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.450
<v Speaker 2>I know I made an appointment,</v>

1212
00:32:59.451 --> 00:33:02.420
<v Speaker 2>but I'm convinced that you're not going to be able to remember it.</v>

1213
00:33:02.421 --> 00:33:03.770
<v Speaker 2>So I'm calling you now to say,</v>

1214
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:04.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh hey,</v>

1215
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:07.820
<v Speaker 2>don't forget I get 20% people answered the phone said,</v>

1216
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:08.301
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1217
00:33:08.301 --> 00:33:08.751
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>

1218
00:33:08.751 --> 00:33:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>

1219
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:13.220
<v Speaker 2>The other 80% is a me leaving a message,</v>

1220
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:13.641
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1221
00:33:13.641 --> 00:33:15.830
<v Speaker 2>which I can't stand leaving a message,</v>

1222
00:33:15.831 --> 00:33:18.050
<v Speaker 2>but I'm thinking they got it in their hand.</v>

1223
00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:19.820
<v Speaker 2>They had it right here.</v>

1224
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:20.360
<v Speaker 2>They got,</v>

1225
00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.980
<v Speaker 2>how aren't they answering the phone?</v>

1226
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.820
<v Speaker 2>It's a phone.</v>

1227
00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:23.653
<v Speaker 2>Hello?</v>

1228
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:24.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1229
00:33:24.021 --> 00:33:27.680
<v Speaker 2>but don't you think it's good that there's all these capabilities of these</v>

1230
00:33:27.681 --> 00:33:29.060
<v Speaker 2>things have smart phones?</v>

1231
00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.080
<v Speaker 2>I think it's good to ever people,</v>

1232
00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.180
<v Speaker 2>other people have them bitcoin on it.</v>

1233
00:33:32.181 --> 00:33:33.014
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

1234
00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:36.260
<v Speaker 2>you can check out an email link that somebody sends you.</v>

1235
00:33:36.261 --> 00:33:37.190
<v Speaker 2>You don't think that's good.</v>

1236
00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:38.360
<v Speaker 2>I think it's good for,</v>

1237
00:33:38.361 --> 00:33:39.194
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1238
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:41.210
<v Speaker 2>you know people that want to do that.</v>

1239
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:41.601
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1240
00:33:41.601 --> 00:33:42.440
<v Speaker 2>I think it's good.</v>

1241
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:43.161
<v Speaker 2>I think it's good.</v>

1242
00:33:43.161 --> 00:33:44.900
<v Speaker 2>I just think the problem is overused.</v>

1243
00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.580
<v Speaker 2>The problem is over use of anything though.</v>

1244
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:48.430
<v Speaker 2>It's overuse of softball.</v>

1245
00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.890
<v Speaker 2>If you just became a fucking softball junkie and you're out there on the field</v>

1246
00:33:51.891 --> 00:33:52.700
<v Speaker 2>every day,</v>

1247
00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:53.780
<v Speaker 2>throwing that ball in the air,</v>

1248
00:33:53.781 --> 00:33:55.790
<v Speaker 2>hitting them by herself into a tree and people like,</v>

1249
00:33:55.791 --> 00:33:56.624
<v Speaker 2>what is Tom Doing?</v>

1250
00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:58.390
<v Speaker 2>Can't wait for that fucking game on Sunday.</v>

1251
00:33:58.910 --> 00:33:59.571
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

1252
00:33:59.571 --> 00:33:59.771
<v Speaker 2>Tom,</v>

1253
00:33:59.771 --> 00:34:01.150
<v Speaker 2>you got a family and he had a wife at home.</v>

1254
00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:02.020
<v Speaker 2>Get home.</v>

1255
00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:02.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1256
00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.080
<v Speaker 2>you're obsessing,</v>

1257
00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:04.250
<v Speaker 2>you're freaking people out,</v>

1258
00:34:04.251 --> 00:34:04.850
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1259
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:05.930
<v Speaker 2>I think that's bad too.</v>

1260
00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:09.560
<v Speaker 2>But I think the phone in moderation is a a beautiful thing.</v>

1261
00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.720
<v Speaker 2>And basing how much scientifical uh,</v>

1262
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:14.480
<v Speaker 2>advancements they've done on the phone in the past,</v>

1263
00:34:14.481 --> 00:34:15.314
<v Speaker 2>how many years,</v>

1264
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:18.140
<v Speaker 2>if they quit that kind of brain power into anything.</v>

1265
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.850
<v Speaker 2>We're driving the same car almost.</v>

1266
00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:21.110
<v Speaker 2>I could assemble this.</v>

1267
00:34:21.111 --> 00:34:22.400
<v Speaker 2>Got a pretty new thing,</v>

1268
00:34:22.401 --> 00:34:23.720
<v Speaker 2>some kind of motorized or,</v>

1269
00:34:23.721 --> 00:34:25.970
<v Speaker 2>but it's pretty similar to the cars that we had.</v>

1270
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:31.030
<v Speaker 2>I was just talking with a friend last night about how like the cars of 10 years</v>

1271
00:34:31.461 --> 00:34:32.990
<v Speaker 2>ago when I was a kid,</v>

1272
00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:34.070
<v Speaker 2>when I was in high school,</v>

1273
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:35.120
<v Speaker 2>I was in high school.</v>

1274
00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:37.940
<v Speaker 2>I was 14 in 1984.</v>

1275
00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:41.150
<v Speaker 2>That's when I was at nine or 1981 when I was in high school.</v>

1276
00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:42.470
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1277
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:44.160
<v Speaker 2>there was a uh,</v>

1278
00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:44.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1279
00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:48.680
<v Speaker 2>1970 Chevelle that this kid had that was in my school.</v>

1280
00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:49.723
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1281
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:51.770
<v Speaker 2>I guess he was like maybe two years older than me,</v>

1282
00:34:51.771 --> 00:34:55.220
<v Speaker 2>so he might've been like 16 but you have this 1970 Chevelle and everybody was</v>

1283
00:34:55.221 --> 00:34:55.371
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1284
00:34:55.371 --> 00:34:56.780
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

1285
00:34:56.781 --> 00:34:57.080
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

1286
00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.100
<v Speaker 2>It was a classic.</v>

1287
00:34:58.340 --> 00:34:59.480
<v Speaker 2>So 70 Chevelle,</v>

1288
00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.353
<v Speaker 2>SS,</v>

1289
00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:03.110
<v Speaker 2>three 50 years old.</v>

1290
00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.030
<v Speaker 2>It's only 11 years old.</v>

1291
00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Like how was the car?</v>

1292
00:35:06.171 --> 00:35:07.100
<v Speaker 2>11 years old.</v>

1293
00:35:07.101 --> 00:35:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Like a classic back then,</v>

1294
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:10.730
<v Speaker 2>but an 11 year old car today,</v>

1295
00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.140
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1296
00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:12.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1297
00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:14.090
<v Speaker 2>it's not that big of a deal.</v>

1298
00:35:14.091 --> 00:35:14.301
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1299
00:35:14.301 --> 00:35:15.380
<v Speaker 2>if you got a hold of a,</v>

1300
00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:17.540
<v Speaker 2>would that be a 2003,</v>

1301
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:19.250
<v Speaker 2>2003 car?</v>

1302
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:20.480
<v Speaker 2>And that's like,</v>

1303
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:21.620
<v Speaker 2>it's a modern car.</v>

1304
00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:22.791
<v Speaker 2>Like what happened?</v>

1305
00:35:22.791 --> 00:35:23.210
<v Speaker 2>How'd that,</v>

1306
00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:24.770
<v Speaker 2>how'd that have dropped the ball?</v>

1307
00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Something happened.</v>

1308
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:29.090
<v Speaker 2>They might've hit like some sort of technological,</v>

1309
00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:31.520
<v Speaker 2>they're constantly pushing the boundaries as far as like this,</v>

1310
00:35:31.521 --> 00:35:35.450
<v Speaker 2>this speed that cars can go and the g forces that they can handle and like to</v>

1311
00:35:35.451 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 2>get like the track times get a little bit better every year</v>

1312
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:38.940
<v Speaker 5>with their sports cars.</v>

1313
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.190
<v Speaker 5>But for the average regular car,</v>

1314
00:35:41.191 --> 00:35:42.720
<v Speaker 5>like at a certain point in time,</v>

1315
00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:43.920
<v Speaker 5>what else can you improve?</v>

1316
00:35:43.921 --> 00:35:46.230
<v Speaker 5>You going to add some electronic blocks that were up there.</v>

1317
00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.940
<v Speaker 5>Those people that got that a road,</v>

1318
00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:50.010
<v Speaker 5>they made those tiles that light up.</v>

1319
00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:50.551
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

1320
00:35:50.551 --> 00:35:50.731
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1321
00:35:50.731 --> 00:35:52.350
<v Speaker 5>The solar or road panels.</v>

1322
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.540
<v Speaker 5>Incredible.</v>

1323
00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:54.380
<v Speaker 5>Incredible,</v>

1324
00:35:54.381 --> 00:35:54.960
<v Speaker 5>incredible.</v>

1325
00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.310
<v Speaker 5>Lights the city up like tron and stuff and they're collecting energy in the car</v>

1326
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.121
<v Speaker 5>and they could,</v>

1327
00:36:00.121 --> 00:36:03.480
<v Speaker 5>that could totally be implemented to apparently that's completely realistic.</v>

1328
00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:05.573
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

1329
00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:06.900
<v Speaker 5>Were there already,</v>

1330
00:36:06.901 --> 00:36:07.830
<v Speaker 5>we just have to get,</v>

1331
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:08.220
<v Speaker 5>get,</v>

1332
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.180
<v Speaker 5>get somebody to say,</v>

1333
00:36:09.181 --> 00:36:09.541
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1334
00:36:09.541 --> 00:36:10.170
<v Speaker 5>a hike.</v>

1335
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:12.810
<v Speaker 5>Do you know how weird do you know weird city streets look?</v>

1336
00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:17.610
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine if you lived in the time before electricity and then someone</v>

1337
00:36:17.611 --> 00:36:22.260
<v Speaker 5>brought you to New York City Times Square Saturday night and you're walking</v>

1338
00:36:22.261 --> 00:36:26.430
<v Speaker 5>through and you see all these lights and all this craziness and the cars with</v>

1339
00:36:26.431 --> 00:36:27.270
<v Speaker 5>the lights and you're like,</v>

1340
00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:28.560
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit,</v>

1341
00:36:28.561 --> 00:36:29.970
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe this.</v>

1342
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:35.550
<v Speaker 5>That would be like a really intense sort of a change.</v>

1343
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:39.900
<v Speaker 5>But I wonder if it would be as intense as all the roads being lit,</v>

1344
00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:44.130
<v Speaker 5>all the roads being lent to us right now.</v>

1345
00:36:44.131 --> 00:36:46.140
<v Speaker 5>That might be like we might not be able to,</v>

1346
00:36:46.141 --> 00:36:48.720
<v Speaker 5>we might have to address the fact that we live in the future.</v>

1347
00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.580
<v Speaker 5>Like if all of our fucking row,</v>

1348
00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:52.920
<v Speaker 5>I mean we might have all collectively just go,</v>

1349
00:36:52.921 --> 00:36:54.840
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck are we doing?</v>

1350
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:55.561
<v Speaker 5>Look what we're doing.</v>

1351
00:36:55.561 --> 00:36:58.110
<v Speaker 5>We have solar powered roads.</v>

1352
00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:59.730
<v Speaker 5>That's progress.</v>

1353
00:36:59.731 --> 00:36:59.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1354
00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:00.700
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1355
00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:03.540
<v Speaker 5>And not breaking down or they have alternative purposes.</v>

1356
00:37:03.541 --> 00:37:04.530
<v Speaker 5>They're not only to drive on,</v>

1357
00:37:04.531 --> 00:37:05.820
<v Speaker 5>but they have other information.</v>

1358
00:37:05.821 --> 00:37:07.740
<v Speaker 5>They change would be so strange though.</v>

1359
00:37:07.741 --> 00:37:09.600
<v Speaker 5>The way it would alter our our world,</v>

1360
00:37:09.601 --> 00:37:14.400
<v Speaker 5>like our vision of the world would look totally different if Hong Kong was lit</v>

1361
00:37:14.401 --> 00:37:15.540
<v Speaker 5>up with those kinds of,</v>

1362
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:19.200
<v Speaker 5>I wonder what the effect would be w I feel like it would make people more</v>

1363
00:37:19.201 --> 00:37:20.034
<v Speaker 5>festive.</v>

1364
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.960
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>

1365
00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:21.361
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1366
00:37:21.361 --> 00:37:22.350
<v Speaker 5>I feel where,</v>

1367
00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean you're driving on this road already.</v>

1368
00:37:24.301 --> 00:37:27.000
<v Speaker 5>If these cars are just trying to tune yourself out because of the,</v>

1369
00:37:27.001 --> 00:37:32.001
<v Speaker 5>it's such a tedious process to get from point a to point B in a car is gray and</v>

1370
00:37:32.611 --> 00:37:35.670
<v Speaker 5>there's other people jammed up in there and the speed's not what you like or</v>

1371
00:37:35.671 --> 00:37:36.031
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

1372
00:37:36.031 --> 00:37:36.271
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

1373
00:37:36.271 --> 00:37:37.104
<v Speaker 5>So it's kind of a,</v>

1374
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.340
<v Speaker 5>the transportation,</v>

1375
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.010
<v Speaker 5>I think they got some room to improve on that for us.</v>

1376
00:37:41.011 --> 00:37:41.221
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1377
00:37:41.221 --> 00:37:42.030
<v Speaker 5>if they,</v>

1378
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:43.050
<v Speaker 5>if they put the phone down,</v>

1379
00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:44.161
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1380
00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:45.110
<v Speaker 5>If they put the phone down,</v>

1381
00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.940
<v Speaker 5>I get to concentrate and it's helping them communicate though.</v>

1382
00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:49.880
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they can use the phone to make the cars.</v>

1383
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:50.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1384
00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:51.050
<v Speaker 5>This is the roadways.</v>

1385
00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.440
<v Speaker 5>These are sole roadways.</v>

1386
00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:53.610
<v Speaker 5>Is that guys Zach,</v>

1387
00:37:53.611 --> 00:37:54.990
<v Speaker 5>he was over the other day something we said.</v>

1388
00:37:54.991 --> 00:37:56.100
<v Speaker 5>We looked him up to see what he says.</v>

1389
00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:58.980
<v Speaker 5>He's on the silicone valley show or something,</v>

1390
00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.020
<v Speaker 5>so we'd want to see what you say.</v>

1391
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.781
<v Speaker 5>He's a funny guy,</v>

1392
00:38:00.781 --> 00:38:01.614
<v Speaker 5>but anyway,</v>

1393
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:02.701
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to see,</v>

1394
00:38:02.701 --> 00:38:03.241
<v Speaker 5>what is this show?</v>

1395
00:38:03.241 --> 00:38:03.901
<v Speaker 5>Silicone Valley.</v>

1396
00:38:03.901 --> 00:38:04.710
<v Speaker 5>I never seen the show.</v>

1397
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:05.371
<v Speaker 5>Funny show.</v>

1398
00:38:05.371 --> 00:38:06.240
<v Speaker 5>It's on HBO.</v>

1399
00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:06.781
<v Speaker 5>I've only,</v>

1400
00:38:06.781 --> 00:38:07.920
<v Speaker 5>I only watched one episode.</v>

1401
00:38:07.921 --> 00:38:08.754
<v Speaker 5>It was really funny.</v>

1402
00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:12.510
<v Speaker 5>We brought it up and there he was and he's getting the car came to pick him up.</v>

1403
00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:15.120
<v Speaker 5>If he looks in there and there's like,</v>

1404
00:38:15.121 --> 00:38:15.540
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

1405
00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:15.751
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1406
00:38:15.751 --> 00:38:16.290
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

1407
00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:17.180
<v Speaker 5>you got it in the card,</v>

1408
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.971
<v Speaker 5>it's nobody in there.</v>

1409
00:38:17.971 --> 00:38:18.301
<v Speaker 5>And he says,</v>

1410
00:38:18.301 --> 00:38:18.691
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

1411
00:38:18.691 --> 00:38:20.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to wherever it was.</v>

1412
00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:24.000
<v Speaker 5>And then the car took off all by itself driving it,</v>

1413
00:38:24.001 --> 00:38:24.380
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1414
00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:24.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1415
00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:25.500
<v Speaker 5>Well they're going to have that.</v>

1416
00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:26.001
<v Speaker 5>I mean they've,</v>

1417
00:38:26.001 --> 00:38:27.540
<v Speaker 5>they essentially have that now,</v>

1418
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:30.060
<v Speaker 5>the Google cars where they're experimenting with it and they,</v>

1419
00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:31.650
<v Speaker 5>they haven't had any accidents.</v>

1420
00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:35.380
<v Speaker 5>None of the accidents that they've been involved with have been the Google cars</v>

1421
00:38:35.381 --> 00:38:36.190
<v Speaker 5>fault.</v>

1422
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:39.820
<v Speaker 2>I think a few people bumped into him jump out in front of them or no,</v>

1423
00:38:39.821 --> 00:38:40.061
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1424
00:38:40.061 --> 00:38:40.301
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1425
00:38:40.301 --> 00:38:41.500
<v Speaker 2>that they haven't hit anything,</v>

1426
00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:43.900
<v Speaker 2>but they apparently have radar.</v>

1427
00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:45.670
<v Speaker 2>They can sense when things are in front of you.</v>

1428
00:38:45.671 --> 00:38:46.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1429
00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.110
<v Speaker 2>you've seen that in cars.</v>

1430
00:38:47.111 --> 00:38:48.400
<v Speaker 2>When you get close to the car in front of you,</v>

1431
00:38:48.401 --> 00:38:50.110
<v Speaker 2>it'll make like a BPPP.</v>

1432
00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.790
<v Speaker 2>I rented a car this weekend that does it.</v>

1433
00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:53.260
<v Speaker 2>They park themselves now.</v>

1434
00:38:53.261 --> 00:38:54.040
<v Speaker 2>Some cars,</v>

1435
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:54.371
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1436
00:38:54.371 --> 00:38:55.990
<v Speaker 2>they can parallel park themselves,</v>

1437
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:56.950
<v Speaker 2>park itself,</v>

1438
00:38:56.951 --> 00:38:58.930
<v Speaker 2>which is ridiculous.</v>

1439
00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:03.160
<v Speaker 2>They just decided you motherfuckers are too stupid to do this.</v>

1440
00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:04.420
<v Speaker 2>We have to help you.</v>

1441
00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:06.243
<v Speaker 2>Excellent.</v>

1442
00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:10.390
<v Speaker 2>This is where I want the money for my car that I'm going to buy to be invested</v>

1443
00:39:10.391 --> 00:39:13.060
<v Speaker 2>in the ability of it to then park itself.</v>

1444
00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:13.331
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1445
00:39:13.331 --> 00:39:13.751
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1446
00:39:13.751 --> 00:39:16.630
<v Speaker 2>There's the thing that's going on right now where people are trying to go retro</v>

1447
00:39:16.631 --> 00:39:21.631
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of Shit because like there's a lot of people that like old cars now.</v>

1448
00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:23.650
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that like,</v>

1449
00:39:23.651 --> 00:39:27.010
<v Speaker 2>like refurbished things because they don't want any of that.</v>

1450
00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:29.890
<v Speaker 2>They don't want all of that interference.</v>

1451
00:39:29.891 --> 00:39:33.970
<v Speaker 2>They don't want all of that disconnect between them and an actual machine.</v>

1452
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.140
<v Speaker 2>We just kept work on it.</v>

1453
00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:35.600
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

1454
00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:36.670
<v Speaker 2>you're a car guy.</v>

1455
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.710
<v Speaker 2>You look under a car lid now you're looking at it.</v>

1456
00:39:38.711 --> 00:39:39.160
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

1457
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.230
<v Speaker 2>What is under here now?</v>

1458
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:43.180
<v Speaker 2>This shit with trunk or is the motor in here?</v>

1459
00:39:43.181 --> 00:39:44.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know which,</v>

1460
00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:44.810
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

1461
00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:45.720
<v Speaker 2>which on this thing yet.</v>

1462
00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:48.790
<v Speaker 2>You know if you can pop the hood of a 1970 Chevelle,</v>

1463
00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.200
<v Speaker 2>you get in that man.</v>

1464
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:52.060
<v Speaker 2>You got a wrench out attributor cap.</v>

1465
00:39:52.061 --> 00:39:52.841
<v Speaker 2>It's right there.</v>

1466
00:39:52.841 --> 00:39:54.040
<v Speaker 2>You can grab it with your hand.</v>

1467
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:55.210
<v Speaker 2>There's your oil filter.</v>

1468
00:39:55.211 --> 00:39:57.450
<v Speaker 2>You could hold onto it cause the dipstick,</v>

1469
00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.680
<v Speaker 2>you could see how much oil is in there with us.</v>

1470
00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.810
<v Speaker 2>You've got computers,</v>

1471
00:40:01.811 --> 00:40:02.644
<v Speaker 2>you have to run it.</v>

1472
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.680
<v Speaker 2>Shut it off.</v>

1473
00:40:03.681 --> 00:40:04.391
<v Speaker 2>Cancers guy.</v>

1474
00:40:04.391 --> 00:40:05.380
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a guy.</v>

1475
00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:05.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1476
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:06.640
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a gun.</v>

1477
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.100
<v Speaker 2>The think a computer can go wacky on you too.</v>

1478
00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:10.240
<v Speaker 2>That also can happen.</v>

1479
00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.530
<v Speaker 2>That happens occasionally.</v>

1480
00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:14.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously this is mechanical breakdown too,</v>

1481
00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:15.490
<v Speaker 2>but computers can go,</v>

1482
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:15.890
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1483
00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:17.050
<v Speaker 2>you're a guy's guy.</v>

1484
00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:19.960
<v Speaker 2>After you get a guy then he has to have a guy said,</v>

1485
00:40:19.961 --> 00:40:20.141
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1486
00:40:20.141 --> 00:40:21.130
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1487
00:40:21.131 --> 00:40:22.650
<v Speaker 2>my stuff isn't correctly.</v>

1488
00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:26.950
<v Speaker 2>But on the flip side you have navigation screens,</v>

1489
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:28.930
<v Speaker 2>you have backup cameras,</v>

1490
00:40:28.931 --> 00:40:31.630
<v Speaker 2>you have all this cool shit that electronics provide to.</v>

1491
00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:32.141
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1492
00:40:32.141 --> 00:40:33.340
<v Speaker 2>I see both sides of it.</v>

1493
00:40:33.341 --> 00:40:38.200
<v Speaker 2>But like I do see like the appeal of like driving an old VW bug,</v>

1494
00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.750
<v Speaker 2>like a VW bug from like 1970,</v>

1495
00:40:40.751 --> 00:40:42.130
<v Speaker 2>not much horsepower or anything,</v>

1496
00:40:42.131 --> 00:40:42.821
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>

1497
00:40:42.821 --> 00:40:43.330
<v Speaker 2>what a,</v>

1498
00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:46.030
<v Speaker 2>what a connection you have to the road with that piece of shit.</v>

1499
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:47.103
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1500
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:48.640
<v Speaker 2>it's not good at handling,</v>

1501
00:40:48.641 --> 00:40:49.690
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have good brakes,</v>

1502
00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:50.860
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1503
00:40:50.861 --> 00:40:51.611
<v Speaker 2>when you see one,</v>

1504
00:40:51.611 --> 00:40:53.420
<v Speaker 2>this is like a little bit and driving it.</v>

1505
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:53.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1506
00:40:53.771 --> 00:40:56.240
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could drive one of the greater good of the project.</v>

1507
00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:58.330
<v Speaker 2>My friend Jimmy had when we were in high school,</v>

1508
00:40:58.570 --> 00:40:59.410
<v Speaker 2>I was an idiot.</v>

1509
00:40:59.411 --> 00:41:03.760
<v Speaker 2>I always had muscle cars and my friend Jimmy had this VW bug and it was like,</v>

1510
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:04.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1511
00:41:04.121 --> 00:41:04.361
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1512
00:41:04.361 --> 00:41:04.901
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1513
00:41:04.901 --> 00:41:06.490
<v Speaker 2>this is right out of high school.</v>

1514
00:41:06.491 --> 00:41:06.780
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1515
00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:09.490
<v Speaker 2>I graduated in 85 and Jimmy was ahead of me.</v>

1516
00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:13.240
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that it was probably like 1986 or something along those lines.</v>

1517
00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:14.350
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1518
00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:19.120
<v Speaker 2>he had this 1960 something bug or 69 bug,</v>

1519
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:21.970
<v Speaker 2>ugly light blue,</v>

1520
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:22.661
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1521
00:41:22.661 --> 00:41:23.590
<v Speaker 2>But it was great.</v>

1522
00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:25.110
<v Speaker 2>It was something cool about it.</v>

1523
00:41:25.111 --> 00:41:28.870
<v Speaker 2>It was like we had a big smile on our face when we're driving around in it.</v>

1524
00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:30.280
<v Speaker 2>You know there was something about,</v>

1525
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:31.503
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1526
00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.650
<v Speaker 2>first of all he's like,</v>

1527
00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.250
<v Speaker 2>you know macho guy</v>

1528
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.350
<v Speaker 1>and a is a construction worker.</v>

1529
00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.880
<v Speaker 1>He's just really smart dude too though.</v>

1530
00:41:37.881 --> 00:41:41.840
<v Speaker 1>So he got himself a fucking VW bug and he's like,</v>

1531
00:41:41.841 --> 00:41:45.260
<v Speaker 1>it gets great gas mileage but like the wind would blow and the car would move.</v>

1532
00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Like you could feel the car moving if a good breeze hit it.</v>

1533
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:50.960
<v Speaker 1>Like she'll fucking cars moving from the wind man.</v>

1534
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Like what do we do and we're going to go cart.</v>

1535
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:53.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1536
00:41:53.691 --> 00:41:54.800
<v Speaker 1>they do handle better now.</v>

1537
00:41:54.801 --> 00:41:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Cars.</v>

1538
00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh one time.</v>

1539
00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:57.243
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1540
00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.790
<v Speaker 1>that's the understatement of the year.</v>

1541
00:41:58.810 --> 00:41:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Snowboard,</v>

1542
00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:00.143
<v Speaker 1>right go.</v>

1543
00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Amazing prize by break.</v>

1544
00:42:02.241 --> 00:42:07.220
<v Speaker 1>I had to stop from like 65 to zero like like on the freeway the other day and it</v>

1545
00:42:07.221 --> 00:42:08.220
<v Speaker 1>just was like,</v>

1546
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:09.891
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1547
00:42:09.891 --> 00:42:10.880
<v Speaker 1>you have the tweet,</v>

1548
00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:13.770
<v Speaker 1>that sweet new Volkswagen that's like,</v>

1549
00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:14.630
<v Speaker 1>or it's perfect.</v>

1550
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:17.210
<v Speaker 1>I forgot you had that perfect contrast to the Volkswagen.</v>

1551
00:42:17.211 --> 00:42:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Then we were talking to him about it because my friend Jimmy's Volkswagen was</v>

1552
00:42:20.091 --> 00:42:21.770
<v Speaker 1>like super old school.</v>

1553
00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Like that lawn mower engine.</v>

1554
00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.060
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a lawnmower or sewing machine.</v>

1555
00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1556
00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:27.621
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1557
00:42:27.621 --> 00:42:28.431
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to pump the brakes,</v>

1558
00:42:28.431 --> 00:42:30.530
<v Speaker 1>but it was like a really light tiny car.</v>

1559
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Where's the new one?</v>

1560
00:42:31.611 --> 00:42:33.960
<v Speaker 1>Like we're saying it looks like a like a fat Porsche.</v>

1561
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:37.790
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a like some sort of a space shit like an Audi or something like</v>

1562
00:42:37.791 --> 00:42:38.390
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1563
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:40.700
<v Speaker 1>The new VW bug is pretty dope looking.</v>

1564
00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:41.310
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1565
00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:44.480
<v Speaker 1>they pretty much redesign it for guys and they got rid of all the girls shit in</v>

1566
00:42:44.481 --> 00:42:44.900
<v Speaker 1>it like that.</v>

1567
00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:46.850
<v Speaker 1>The flower ponds and shit like that.</v>

1568
00:42:46.851 --> 00:42:48.140
<v Speaker 1>That used to be in the old ones,</v>

1569
00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:52.760
<v Speaker 1>like more ones that look like bubbles and it's a perfect example of a car that</v>

1570
00:42:52.761 --> 00:42:55.470
<v Speaker 1>like shows the improvement of today's cars because the,</v>

1571
00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:00.520
<v Speaker 1>the performance and handling of a VW bug is better than like a 1970 Portia.</v>

1572
00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:06.740
<v Speaker 1>If you got a Porsche from 1970 those bitches had like skinny ass steering wheels</v>

1573
00:43:06.741 --> 00:43:10.790
<v Speaker 1>that were big like Hula hoops and get shitty ass skinny tires.</v>

1574
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>

1575
00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:12.710
<v Speaker 1>they didn't handle that well.</v>

1576
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:16.820
<v Speaker 1>They just weren't that good in comparison to like what your car could do if you</v>

1577
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:19.010
<v Speaker 1>brought your car back in time.</v>

1578
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:22.310
<v Speaker 1>Like when they had the 1969 Porsche and you showed them your car,</v>

1579
00:43:22.311 --> 00:43:24.560
<v Speaker 1>they'd be fucking blowing you.</v>

1580
00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:27.050
<v Speaker 1>It was gonna be like you're a wizard from the future.</v>

1581
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:27.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1582
00:43:27.561 --> 00:43:29.330
<v Speaker 1>This is the 2014 turbo.</v>

1583
00:43:29.331 --> 00:43:30.081
<v Speaker 1>I have this car,</v>

1584
00:43:30.081 --> 00:43:32.830
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't it have like 250 horsepower or something like that?</v>

1585
00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:33.770
<v Speaker 1>They just put a new engine in it.</v>

1586
00:43:33.771 --> 00:43:34.960
<v Speaker 1>I forget what exactly it is.</v>

1587
00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.113
<v Speaker 1>Fuck fat.</v>

1588
00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Like that was a big deal.</v>

1589
00:43:37.711 --> 00:43:38.121
<v Speaker 1>Like to have,</v>

1590
00:43:38.121 --> 00:43:42.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean that would be a little bit heavier than an old Porsche for sure,</v>

1591
00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:46.850
<v Speaker 1>but if you could get that kind of horsepower in an old car,</v>

1592
00:43:46.851 --> 00:43:47.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's ridiculous.</v>

1593
00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Like they have these new mustangs,</v>

1594
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:50.960
<v Speaker 1>the Mustang Gt,</v>

1595
00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:55.961
<v Speaker 1>the new one that's out just straight Mustang gt has like 450 fucking horsepower</v>

1596
00:43:58.401 --> 00:43:59.570
<v Speaker 1>or something crazy like that.</v>

1597
00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:00.830
<v Speaker 1>There's songs out to people on.</v>

1598
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:01.161
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1599
00:44:01.161 --> 00:44:02.800
<v Speaker 1>but that's like their basic car.</v>

1600
00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Then they have a Shelby that comes out later that's going to have more than 600</v>

1601
00:44:06.591 --> 00:44:11.480
<v Speaker 1>horsepower like that wasn't accessible back in 1970 second place to go drive</v>

1602
00:44:11.481 --> 00:44:12.051
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

1603
00:44:12.051 --> 00:44:12.201
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

1604
00:44:12.201 --> 00:44:12.770
<v Speaker 1>hey look,</v>

1605
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:16.640
<v Speaker 1>we got a place you can go drive it to get something even remotely as fast in</v>

1606
00:44:16.641 --> 00:44:19.130
<v Speaker 1>like 1970 you had a special order shit.</v>

1607
00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.360
<v Speaker 1>You had to go to a mechanic,</v>

1608
00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:23.630
<v Speaker 1>you got to find some dude who knows how to put in nitrous on a car,</v>

1609
00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:25.160
<v Speaker 1>but now you get his buy it.</v>

1610
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:27.680
<v Speaker 1>They allow people to have something like that.</v>

1611
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.941
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1612
00:44:27.941 --> 00:44:32.090
<v Speaker 1>it's just a faction of what we're doing at faction.</v>

1613
00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:35.580
<v Speaker 1>This can can continual improvement.</v>

1614
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:35.941
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1615
00:44:35.941 --> 00:44:39.600
<v Speaker 1>it's a a a process and it's a product of those things.</v>

1616
00:44:39.601 --> 00:44:43.860
<v Speaker 1>It's a product of this continual improvement and it's a product of our constant</v>

1617
00:44:43.861 --> 00:44:45.300
<v Speaker 1>desire for new shit.</v>

1618
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:50.720
<v Speaker 1>We want the car that does zero to 60 in 3.4 because the car does zero to 60 in</v>

1619
00:44:51.091 --> 00:44:54.360
<v Speaker 1>3.6 is outdated and you look at the specs,</v>

1620
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:54.841
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1621
00:44:54.841 --> 00:44:59.340
<v Speaker 1>this car went around the Nurburgring and seven minutes and 25 seconds.</v>

1622
00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:00.780
<v Speaker 1>People Freak out.</v>

1623
00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:01.111
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

1624
00:45:01.111 --> 00:45:03.820
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that my car does it in seven 40 my car</v>

1625
00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:04.803
<v Speaker 5>piece of shit.</v>

1626
00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:06.821
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

1627
00:45:06.821 --> 00:45:07.271
<v Speaker 5>asshole,</v>

1628
00:45:07.271 --> 00:45:10.390
<v Speaker 5>you're not going around the Nurburgring like what are you doing man?</v>

1629
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:13.210
<v Speaker 5>Like if you drove my friend Jimmy's Vw bug,</v>

1630
00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:18.480
<v Speaker 1>that might make you feel better than driving some ridiculous car that goes zero</v>

1631
00:45:18.641 --> 00:45:22.240
<v Speaker 1>to 60 in two seconds and corners at two g's.</v>

1632
00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:24.870
<v Speaker 1>You know it well,</v>

1633
00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:25.571
<v Speaker 1>it's a certain,</v>

1634
00:45:25.571 --> 00:45:26.590
<v Speaker 1>a certain part of that.</v>

1635
00:45:26.591 --> 00:45:28.030
<v Speaker 1>You'll lose the fun.</v>

1636
00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.470
<v Speaker 1>There's like a fun and driving.</v>

1637
00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.680
<v Speaker 1>You know there's a guy named Dario,</v>

1638
00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:32.681
<v Speaker 1>Fran Cheaty,</v>

1639
00:45:32.681 --> 00:45:33.700
<v Speaker 1>I think you say his name.</v>

1640
00:45:33.701 --> 00:45:37.870
<v Speaker 1>He's a race car driver and he drives a,</v>

1641
00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:38.201
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

1642
00:45:38.201 --> 00:45:38.650
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

1643
00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:40.900
<v Speaker 1>his cardio is fun car to drive.</v>

1644
00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:45.910
<v Speaker 1>He's like a 1973 Porsche with like a big engine in it.</v>

1645
00:45:45.911 --> 00:45:48.690
<v Speaker 1>He put like a more modern engine in 1973 boards.</v>

1646
00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Like he could get like a vague Iran or any of these like super complicated cars</v>

1647
00:45:53.171 --> 00:45:54.070
<v Speaker 1>they're making today.</v>

1648
00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:58.420
<v Speaker 1>But a guy who's an actual race car driver decided to go for like the gritty feel</v>

1649
00:45:58.421 --> 00:46:01.220
<v Speaker 1>of an old car combined with modern technology.</v>

1650
00:46:01.221 --> 00:46:02.320
<v Speaker 1>He's a very smart guy,</v>

1651
00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:02.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1652
00:46:02.801 --> 00:46:05.170
<v Speaker 1>he's like all these zero to 60 times she goes is yes,</v>

1653
00:46:05.171 --> 00:46:08.590
<v Speaker 1>it's important where your race car driving but not for the pleasure of driving.</v>

1654
00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:10.350
<v Speaker 1>So that's the guy listened to.</v>

1655
00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:11.591
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the guy,</v>

1656
00:46:11.591 --> 00:46:13.000
<v Speaker 1>he does it for a living.</v>

1657
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:17.800
<v Speaker 1>So if he chooses to drive like an old car that like really,</v>

1658
00:46:17.801 --> 00:46:19.120
<v Speaker 1>you really feel everything,</v>

1659
00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:20.730
<v Speaker 1>that's probably the most pleasure.</v>

1660
00:46:20.731 --> 00:46:21.490
<v Speaker 1>A lot of merit.</v>

1661
00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:21.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1662
00:46:21.731 --> 00:46:26.680
<v Speaker 1>We like pass the pleasurable point and went to some weird numb point with cars</v>

1663
00:46:26.681 --> 00:46:29.770
<v Speaker 1>where the stealings like this and you don't feel any of the bumps,</v>

1664
00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:30.131
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1665
00:46:30.131 --> 00:46:31.210
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

1666
00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:31.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1667
00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:33.350
<v Speaker 5>It's not organic.</v>

1668
00:46:33.351 --> 00:46:33.910
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1669
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:35.170
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of not organic.</v>

1670
00:46:35.171 --> 00:46:36.700
<v Speaker 5>It's not very Mumford and sons.</v>

1671
00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:37.733
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1672
00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:39.851
<v Speaker 5>It's not very,</v>

1673
00:46:39.851 --> 00:46:40.250
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1674
00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:40.470
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1675
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:41.690
<v Speaker 1>That's the trend today.</v>

1676
00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:44.570
<v Speaker 1>The trend today is to go with like a handmade clock,</v>

1677
00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:45.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1678
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.441
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1679
00:46:45.441 --> 00:46:46.280
<v Speaker 1>oh see that clock.</v>

1680
00:46:46.281 --> 00:46:46.971
<v Speaker 1>It was handmade.</v>

1681
00:46:46.971 --> 00:46:47.450
<v Speaker 1>And people like,</v>

1682
00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

1683
00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:48.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1684
00:46:48.231 --> 00:46:52.790
<v Speaker 1>there's something cool about that as opposed to like if you lived in 1970 and</v>

1685
00:46:52.791 --> 00:46:53.900
<v Speaker 1>you've got a digital clock,</v>

1688
00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:57.260
<v Speaker 5>digital clock in his house,</v>

<v Speaker 5>He would like this motherfucker's got a digital alarm clock and it was to raise</v>

1691
00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:06.630
<v Speaker 5>a microwave oven.</v>

1692
00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:08.760
<v Speaker 5>Ellie.</v>

1693
00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:09.593

<v Speaker 5>Yeah man.</v>

1695
00:47:10.381 --> 00:47:12.480

1696
00:47:12.481 --> 00:47:12.930
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

1697
00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:14.730
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't believe I was looking at it.</v>

1698
00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:15.653
<v Speaker 5>I was looking at,</v>

1699
00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.280
<v Speaker 5>then he came in to watch.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1701
00:47:17.891 --> 00:47:20.520
<v Speaker 5>At first I got the clock in your house and put it on your hand.</v>

1702
00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:21.871

1710
00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:35.320
<v Speaker 2>you had to press it to find the time and then you'd let it go and fuck your time</v>

1711
00:47:35.321 --> 00:47:37.660
<v Speaker 2>would go by president.</v>

1712
00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:40.600
<v Speaker 2>It didn't just stay on because it was,</v>

1713
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:43.180
<v Speaker 2>the batteries were dog shit back then.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1715
00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:45.140
<v Speaker 2>if it was going to stay on it,</v>

1716
00:47:45.141 --> 00:47:47.020
<v Speaker 2>we had to be like a a foot thick.</v>

1717
00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.550
<v Speaker 2>The battery for that back then.</v>

1718
00:47:48.551 --> 00:47:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1719
00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:51.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's batteries were just dog shit,</v>

1720
00:47:51.131 --> 00:47:52.120
<v Speaker 2>but I never thought about that.</v>

1721
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:53.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean those were,</v>

1722
00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:58.720
<v Speaker 2>it's remember the calculator watch for some reason that one never took off.</v>

1723
00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:01.360
<v Speaker 2>He took off and it got to a certain point and people are like,</v>

1724
00:48:01.361 --> 00:48:01.541
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1725
00:48:01.541 --> 00:48:01.721
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1726
00:48:01.721 --> 00:48:01.871
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1727
00:48:01.871 --> 00:48:02.041
<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>

1728
00:48:02.041 --> 00:48:02.590
<v Speaker 2>What the,</v>

1729
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:04.150
<v Speaker 2>how often am I counting shit.</v>

1730
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:07.330
<v Speaker 2>They've got the calculator phone.</v>

1731
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Your phone is kind of a computer.</v>

1732
00:48:09.281 --> 00:48:11.290
<v Speaker 2>That's a one device choice.</v>

1733
00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.060
<v Speaker 2>You better off with a compass.</v>

1734
00:48:13.061 --> 00:48:13.751
<v Speaker 2>What if you get lost?</v>

1735
00:48:13.751 --> 00:48:14.740
<v Speaker 2>All you got is a fucking tie.</v>

1736
00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:16.180
<v Speaker 2>Calculate a bitch.</v>

1737
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.450
<v Speaker 2>Calculators not going to help you if you're lost in the woods.</v>

1738
00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:18.941
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

1739
00:48:18.941 --> 00:48:19.774
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1740
00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:21.490
<v Speaker 2>you have something to make some fire.</v>

1741
00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1742
00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:23.620
<v Speaker 2>Why do you got to fucking calculator?</v>

1743
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Not that as our first development here and it's also the calculator watch was</v>

1744
00:48:28.661 --> 00:48:31.600
<v Speaker 2>invented with calculators were only like that big like,</v>

1745
00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:32.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1746
00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:33.490
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

1747
00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.750
<v Speaker 2>How often is that coming up?</v>

1748
00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:38.140
<v Speaker 2>Except this is the one thing that I know people were probably yelling at me</v>

1749
00:48:38.141 --> 00:48:40.570
<v Speaker 2>right now except people cheating in school.</v>

1750
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:42.130
<v Speaker 2>I bet there was a window.</v>

1751
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:47.040
<v Speaker 2>I bet there was a small window where teachers are still fucking old people who</v>

1752
00:48:47.041 --> 00:48:47.540
<v Speaker 2>are there.</v>

1753
00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:50.530
<v Speaker 2>They're out of touch with modern technology and a lot of ways.</v>

1754
00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:53.560
<v Speaker 2>So there's probably a window with these young little rascals went in there with</v>

1755
00:48:53.561 --> 00:48:57.850
<v Speaker 2>their technological wizard phones with calculators on and they probably,</v>

1756
00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.390
<v Speaker 2>I remember doing that totally.</v>

1757
00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:02.170
<v Speaker 2>How long was it before they were made illegal?</v>

1758
00:49:02.171 --> 00:49:03.004
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that</v>

1759
00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:04.030
<v Speaker 6>he ever really wear,</v>

1760
00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:06.690
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they ever actually caught on because you were always allowed to</v>

1761
00:49:06.691 --> 00:49:09.090
<v Speaker 6>use like calculators to cheat in school.</v>

1762
00:49:09.091 --> 00:49:12.660
<v Speaker 6>There was this big Tia 81 Texas instrument ones that you had to buy.</v>

1763
00:49:12.661 --> 00:49:15.120
<v Speaker 6>Remember this huge calculators and you used to be,</v>

1764
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:18.390
<v Speaker 6>there was a note field kind of where you can just sit there and write all these</v>

1765
00:49:18.391 --> 00:49:21.900
<v Speaker 6>like pro like answers to questions in the calculator.</v>

1766
00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:24.000
<v Speaker 6>And the teachers never caught on for us on that.</v>

1767
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:24.863
<v Speaker 6>We just opened up all,</v>

1768
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:27.210
<v Speaker 6>everyone would open up their calculators and look at our notes on there.</v>

1769
00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:28.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>

1770
00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:29.940
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>

1771
00:49:29.941 --> 00:49:30.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1772
00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:30.871
<v Speaker 2>so it was like,</v>

1773
00:49:30.871 --> 00:49:33.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a a note function on a smartphone.</v>

1774
00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:33.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1775
00:49:33.541 --> 00:49:34.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1776
00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:34.980
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

1777
00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:35.431
<v Speaker 6>It was.</v>

1778
00:49:35.431 --> 00:49:36.420
<v Speaker 6>It was like the beginning of that.</v>

1779
00:49:36.421 --> 00:49:40.110
<v Speaker 6>But I remember calculator watches like we had them and I don't ever remember</v>

1780
00:49:40.111 --> 00:49:41.430
<v Speaker 6>being told not to wear it.</v>

1781
00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:42.360
<v Speaker 6>Like I don't think the,</v>

1782
00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:44.250
<v Speaker 6>even the math teachers even figured it out.</v>

1783
00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Well let's,</v>

1784
00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:46.370
<v Speaker 2>let's Google that to find out.</v>

1785
00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:50.030
<v Speaker 2>Cause I would think that the only way to get good at math if you're going to</v>

1786
00:49:50.031 --> 00:49:53.030
<v Speaker 2>really get good at math is you have to actually do it right?</v>

1787
00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:53.691
<v Speaker 2>I mean yeah,</v>

1788
00:49:53.691 --> 00:49:55.190
<v Speaker 2>math is something that's fun to do.</v>

1789
00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:56.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think when the question is terrible,</v>

1790
00:49:56.841 --> 00:49:58.100
<v Speaker 2>he just lost all credibility.</v>

1791
00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:01.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who you are and what you just said.</v>

1792
00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.520
<v Speaker 2>I like it because it's like always the same way.</v>

1793
00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:07.020
<v Speaker 2>Watch this spelling.</v>

1794
00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:09.140
<v Speaker 2>But then you start getting into triangles and shit.</v>

1795
00:50:09.141 --> 00:50:09.950
<v Speaker 2>He needs that.</v>

1796
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:12.010
<v Speaker 2>Well that's specialized mathematical,</v>

1797
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:13.890
<v Speaker 2>just like addition man.</v>

1798
00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:16.340
<v Speaker 2>It's like Harry Potter Science,</v>

1799
00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.391
<v Speaker 2>like those guys,</v>

1800
00:50:17.391 --> 00:50:18.224
<v Speaker 2>the quantum,</v>

1801
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:22.280
<v Speaker 2>the quantum deep into the quantum consciousness as I liked those guys that say</v>

1802
00:50:22.281 --> 00:50:23.930
<v Speaker 2>shit that I can't understand it all.</v>

1803
00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:25.520
<v Speaker 2>I love when they're talking to that kind of math,</v>

1804
00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:29.360
<v Speaker 2>when they show me those mathematical and you just go,</v>

1805
00:50:29.361 --> 00:50:30.500
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

1806
00:50:30.501 --> 00:50:31.490
<v Speaker 2>An alien language.</v>

1807
00:50:31.491 --> 00:50:31.641
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1808
00:50:31.641 --> 00:50:32.121
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

1809
00:50:32.121 --> 00:50:33.170
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what that is.</v>

1810
00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:34.640
<v Speaker 2>Those guys fascinated me in the movie.</v>

1811
00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:35.793
<v Speaker 2>They see that the,</v>

1812
00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:38.160
<v Speaker 2>there's a cartoon where they're all looking at that,</v>

1813
00:50:38.310 --> 00:50:41.330
<v Speaker 2>the big formula on the chalkboard or over there and they're going,</v>

1814
00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:42.173
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>

1815
00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:44.120
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's a humor.</v>

1816
00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:45.800
<v Speaker 2>Some are in the normal,</v>

1817
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:49.970
<v Speaker 2>there was the joke in the a formula that a irregular persons knocking.</v>

1818
00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:51.411
<v Speaker 2>It's not funny.</v>

1819
00:50:51.411 --> 00:50:52.244
<v Speaker 2>You know</v>

1820
00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:52.450
<v Speaker 6>Joe,</v>

1821
00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:53.300
<v Speaker 6>do you remember glacier?</v>

1822
00:50:53.301 --> 00:50:54.830
<v Speaker 6>I think they're called glacier glasses.</v>

1823
00:50:54.831 --> 00:50:55.190
<v Speaker 6>They can't,</v>

1824
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:56.600
<v Speaker 6>there were out around the same time.</v>

1825
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:57.350
<v Speaker 6>There were like,</v>

1826
00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:58.970
<v Speaker 6>like circle glasses,</v>

1827
00:50:58.971 --> 00:51:01.910
<v Speaker 6>but then they had this little leather piece that went on the side and then like</v>

1828
00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:02.100
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1829
00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:06.230
<v Speaker 6>the arms were like may not a rubber and they were really popular for like two</v>

1830
00:51:06.231 --> 00:51:08.300
<v Speaker 6>years in the early eighties and they were like,</v>

1831
00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:09.603
<v Speaker 2>I missed the,</v>

1832
00:51:09.610 --> 00:51:11.050
<v Speaker 2>I didn't hang out with any of those people.</v>

1833
00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Look at Google calculator,</v>

1834
00:51:14.201 --> 00:51:14.860
<v Speaker 2>watch Matt.</v>

1835
00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.180
<v Speaker 2>It's actually pretty trippy.</v>

1836
00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:19.510
<v Speaker 2>They came out with one in 1975 man,</v>

1837
00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:21.243
<v Speaker 2>none nuts.</v>

1838
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:25.690
<v Speaker 2>I had one in one of the one really eighties calculator watch were first.</v>

1839
00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:30.740
<v Speaker 2>It were first introduced in the 1970s and despite enjoying a heyday during the</v>

1840
00:51:30.821 --> 00:51:33.010
<v Speaker 2>1980s continued to be produced.</v>

1841
00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:36.490
<v Speaker 2>The most notable brand is Casio databank series.</v>

1842
00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:39.280
<v Speaker 2>The watches were buy Timex.</v>

1843
00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:40.270
<v Speaker 2>We're also popular.</v>

1844
00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:42.100
<v Speaker 2>There's a Wikipedia,</v>

1845
00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:45.140
<v Speaker 2>but Brian has a Wikipedia where you could see all the old ones there.</v>

1846
00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:46.240
<v Speaker 2>It's a trip,</v>

1847
00:51:46.241 --> 00:51:47.074
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1848
00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:49.240
<v Speaker 2>It's really fascinating.</v>

1849
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:52.000
<v Speaker 2>Like I forgot how silly these things where,</v>

1850
00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:53.603
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1851
00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:54.161
<v Speaker 2>look at those.</v>

1852
00:51:54.161 --> 00:51:56.320
<v Speaker 2>We'll look at the one down looking at the one even further down.</v>

1853
00:51:56.350 --> 00:51:57.183
<v Speaker 2>Look at that thing.</v>

1854
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:59.040
<v Speaker 2>How do you get your finger on one of those?</v>

1855
00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:00.850
<v Speaker 2>But that's all you got to get a little.</v>

1856
00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:01.631
<v Speaker 2>Remember that at all.</v>

1857
00:52:01.631 --> 00:52:03.730
<v Speaker 2>But with that is the future of ad.</v>

1858
00:52:03.731 --> 00:52:04.960
<v Speaker 2>If you had one of those,</v>

1859
00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:06.970
<v Speaker 2>you could totally get star wars.</v>

1860
00:52:06.971 --> 00:52:07.804
<v Speaker 2>Chicks.</v>

1861
00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:09.700
<v Speaker 2>Chicks are like really into star wars.</v>

1862
00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:11.260
<v Speaker 2>They would think you were so cool.</v>

1863
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:16.000
<v Speaker 2>He's got a fucking calculator on his rest.</v>

1864
00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:18.490
<v Speaker 2>It's so future.</v>

1865
00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:19.960
<v Speaker 2>It's so space.</v>

1866
00:52:20.890 --> 00:52:21.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1867
00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:22.210
<v Speaker 2>That didn't work out.</v>

1868
00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.260
<v Speaker 2>We didn't give a fuck anymore.</v>

1869
00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Now people went back to dials.</v>

1870
00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:27.430
<v Speaker 2>You know like if your car is fancy,</v>

1871
00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:29.740
<v Speaker 2>your car has an old school clock on it.</v>

1872
00:52:29.741 --> 00:52:31.780
<v Speaker 2>Like if you buy a Lexus or something like that,</v>

1873
00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:33.790
<v Speaker 2>they'll have like a nice clock in it.</v>

1874
00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:35.830
<v Speaker 2>Like an actual tick tick tock.</v>

1875
00:52:35.831 --> 00:52:36.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1876
00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:37.031
<v Speaker 2>and it's to show you,</v>

1877
00:52:37.031 --> 00:52:38.740
<v Speaker 2>this is a luxury item sir.</v>

1878
00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:40.660
<v Speaker 2>There's no digital clocks in here,</v>

1879
00:52:40.661 --> 00:52:40.901
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>

1880
00:52:40.901 --> 00:52:42.370
<v Speaker 2>This is a luxury item</v>

1881
00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:45.423
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1882
00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:48.160
<v Speaker 2>Is it is just a thing that tells the time like what the fuck is going on here?</v>

1883
00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Something's going on here.</v>

1884
00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:51.040
<v Speaker 2>If you have a tick tock,</v>

1885
00:52:51.041 --> 00:52:51.431
<v Speaker 2>tick tock,</v>

1886
00:52:51.431 --> 00:52:51.791
<v Speaker 2>tick tock,</v>

1887
00:52:51.791 --> 00:52:52.624
<v Speaker 2>it's fancy.</v>

1888
00:52:52.690 --> 00:52:53.523
<v Speaker 2>See this?</v>

1889
00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:55.240
<v Speaker 2>This is fancy.</v>

1890
00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:57.990
<v Speaker 2>This is fancy and can't hear.</v>

1891
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000
<v Speaker 2>This is how I know what time where I look at my computer go away or the computer</v>

1892
00:53:03.921 --> 00:53:05.350
<v Speaker 2>or was he a digital numbers?</v>

1893
00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:06.430
<v Speaker 2>Your exact numbers.</v>

1894
00:53:06.431 --> 00:53:07.300
<v Speaker 2>I like looking at it.</v>

1895
00:53:07.301 --> 00:53:08.790
<v Speaker 2>We the court Sansi too,</v>

1896
00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:09.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1897
00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:10.121
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's in there.</v>

1898
00:53:10.121 --> 00:53:11.320
<v Speaker 2>I got that shit at target.</v>

1899
00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:13.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is.</v>

1900
00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:14.110
<v Speaker 2>It's just a clock,</v>

1901
00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.600
<v Speaker 2>but I like looking at a clock for whatever reason.</v>

1902
00:53:16.601 --> 00:53:20.560
<v Speaker 2>It gives me a better sense of what time is that when I look at a number,</v>

1903
00:53:20.770 --> 00:53:23.710
<v Speaker 2>when I look at numbers and it's totally illogical,</v>

1904
00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.000
<v Speaker 2>but I look at this number,</v>

1905
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:25.861
<v Speaker 2>my computer,</v>

1906
00:53:25.861 --> 00:53:28.290
<v Speaker 2>the upper left hand or upper right hand corner of my computer,</v>

1907
00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:29.131
<v Speaker 2>and then I look at that,</v>

1908
00:53:29.131 --> 00:53:31.170
<v Speaker 2>that's more pleasurable to me for whatever reason.</v>

1909
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:33.490
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting uh,</v>

1910
00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:34.493
<v Speaker 2>evaluation.</v>

1911
00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:38.370
<v Speaker 2>I think I have a more natural sense of analog thing.</v>

1912
00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:38.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1913
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:38.841
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1914
00:53:38.841 --> 00:53:42.360
<v Speaker 2>the way analog is better than tape to you listening to recordings and so forth</v>

1915
00:53:42.361 --> 00:53:42.751
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1916
00:53:42.751 --> 00:53:43.584
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times,</v>

1917
00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:44.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1918
00:53:44.401 --> 00:53:45.610
<v Speaker 2>it used to record and uh,</v>

1919
00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:45.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1920
00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:47.670
<v Speaker 2>analog and then they went to digital,</v>

1921
00:53:47.671 --> 00:53:49.140
<v Speaker 2>came out Kinda then.</v>

1922
00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Then what they would do is they'll go digital,</v>

1923
00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:51.301
<v Speaker 2>analog,</v>

1924
00:53:51.301 --> 00:53:53.250
<v Speaker 2>digital and then back to analog.</v>

1925
00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1926
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:55.980
<v Speaker 2>Try to mix this stuff up to where it sounds.</v>

1927
00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:56.520
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1928
00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:57.480
<v Speaker 2>and I fully understand that.</v>

1929
00:53:57.481 --> 00:53:58.890
<v Speaker 2>For some folks it's the opposite.</v>

1930
00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:00.420
<v Speaker 2>Some folks they don't like that,</v>

1931
00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:01.590
<v Speaker 2>that's not pleasing to them,</v>

1932
00:54:01.591 --> 00:54:02.580
<v Speaker 2>but they love the numbers.</v>

1933
00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:03.070
<v Speaker 2>Some,</v>

1934
00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:04.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's all different.</v>

1935
00:54:04.021 --> 00:54:05.070
<v Speaker 2>It's just me personally.</v>

1936
00:54:05.071 --> 00:54:07.230
<v Speaker 2>That's how I always feel when I,</v>

1937
00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:09.270
<v Speaker 2>I would way rather look at like a,</v>

1938
00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.220
<v Speaker 2>I think clocks are kind of cool.</v>

1939
00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:12.780
<v Speaker 2>Whenever I look at a watch,</v>

1940
00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:14.273
<v Speaker 2>pardon me goes,</v>

1941
00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:14.920
<v Speaker 2>oh that's cool.</v>

1942
00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:18.150
<v Speaker 2>Can Watch the other part of me instantaneously goes,</v>

1943
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:19.840
<v Speaker 2>it is so God damn fascinating.</v>

1944
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:21.570
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of moving parts in there.</v>

1945
00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:22.110
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

1946
00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:23.790
<v Speaker 2>That's spin and took like,</v>

1947
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:26.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fan of expensive watches,</v>

1948
00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:26.731
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

1949
00:54:26.731 --> 00:54:28.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think some of them look really cool,</v>

1950
00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:31.890
<v Speaker 2>but it's not something that I'm really into because they seem to me like peacock</v>

1951
00:54:31.891 --> 00:54:32.880
<v Speaker 2>feathers a little bit.</v>

1952
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:37.050
<v Speaker 2>But what I am a fan of is the engineering behind those watches.</v>

1953
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fan of like my watch has done,</v>

1954
00:54:39.011 --> 00:54:39.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1955
00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:39.541
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1956
00:54:39.541 --> 00:54:40.050
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1957
00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:42.180
<v Speaker 2>it's just not an expensive watch at all,</v>

1958
00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:42.670
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

1959
00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:44.790
<v Speaker 2>it kind of like at nighttime it kind of glows.</v>

1960
00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:46.400
<v Speaker 2>Like I could see that the,</v>

1961
00:54:46.401 --> 00:54:47.220
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

1962
00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:48.750
<v Speaker 2>the hand very clearly at nighttime,</v>

1963
00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:50.610
<v Speaker 2>it's a fantastic feature.</v>

1964
00:54:50.611 --> 00:54:54.120
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't require a battery to do that either or it doesn't run on any extra,</v>

1965
00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:54.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1966
00:54:54.601 --> 00:54:55.261
<v Speaker 2>sounded like your thing,</v>

1967
00:54:55.261 --> 00:54:56.820
<v Speaker 2>you have to do press a button or anything.</v>

1968
00:54:56.820 --> 00:54:57.653
<v Speaker 2>You can always see it.</v>

1969
00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:00.330
<v Speaker 2>But I'm fascinated by that.</v>

1970
00:55:00.331 --> 00:55:02.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm fascinated by the engineering involved in it.</v>

1971
00:55:02.581 --> 00:55:04.200
<v Speaker 2>But I think for a lot of guys they were,</v>

1972
00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:05.730
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not criticizing,</v>

1973
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:07.110
<v Speaker 2>they look cool as fuck,</v>

1974
00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:09.090
<v Speaker 2>but it seems very kind of peacocky,</v>

1975
00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:09.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1976
00:55:09.631 --> 00:55:12.030
<v Speaker 2>when dudes have like diamonds all over their watch and you know,</v>

1977
00:55:12.031 --> 00:55:13.050
<v Speaker 2>diamonds and they thing,</v>

1978
00:55:13.051 --> 00:55:14.400
<v Speaker 2>and my buddy Alex watch this,</v>

1979
00:55:14.401 --> 00:55:14.701
<v Speaker 2>he's just,</v>

1980
00:55:14.701 --> 00:55:17.440
<v Speaker 2>he's showing me a watch $36,000 for,</v>

1981
00:55:17.441 --> 00:55:18.061
<v Speaker 2>it's a watch.</v>

1982
00:55:18.061 --> 00:55:18.840
<v Speaker 2>I was looking at it going,</v>

1983
00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:19.321
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

1984
00:55:19.321 --> 00:55:19.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1985
00:55:19.561 --> 00:55:21.540
<v Speaker 2>and I met a guy that had one in Toronto,</v>

1986
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:23.940
<v Speaker 2>I think it was like more than a hundred thousand.</v>

1987
00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:25.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to remember what he will own.</v>

1988
00:55:25.981 --> 00:55:27.510
<v Speaker 2>Like a company that imports them.</v>

1989
00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:28.351
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

1990
00:55:28.351 --> 00:55:29.184
<v Speaker 2>very nice guy.</v>

1991
00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:30.300
<v Speaker 2>He loves watches.</v>

1992
00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:30.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1993
00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:33.570
<v Speaker 2>There's people that are into collecting watches,</v>

1994
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:34.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1995
00:55:34.141 --> 00:55:35.010
<v Speaker 2>and they're very,</v>

1996
00:55:35.011 --> 00:55:37.530
<v Speaker 2>a matter of fact about their watches,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that lasts.</v>

2013
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:55.380
<v Speaker 2>It's not a piece of junk that's disposable.</v>

2014
00:55:55.410 --> 00:55:56.940
<v Speaker 2>You get a piece of quality,</v>

2015

2023
00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:17.370

<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2057
00:56:56.110 --> 00:56:57.550
<v Speaker 5>we should really reevaluate,</v>

2058
00:56:58.030 --> 00:57:00.930
<v Speaker 5>reevaluate the whole throwing out plastic shit.</v>

2059
00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:05.020
<v Speaker 5>You see all the plastic that's in the ocean and all these photographs of these</v>

2060
00:57:05.021 --> 00:57:08.760
<v Speaker 5>birds that had been feeding plastics to their babies and their babies die and</v>

2061
00:57:08.761 --> 00:57:10.900
<v Speaker 5>you see that their bellies are filled with plastics.</v>

2062
00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:11.311
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2066
00:57:16.871 --> 00:57:18.010
<v Speaker 6>little plastic beads,</v>

2067
00:57:18.011 --> 00:57:19.720
<v Speaker 6>I guess they're fucking up the water and air</v>

2068
00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:20.940
<v Speaker 5>biodegradable.</v>

2069
00:57:20.941 --> 00:57:21.451
<v Speaker 5>Those things.</v>

2070

2071
00:57:22.621 --> 00:57:23.880
<v Speaker 5>They don't need to use those scrubs.</v>

2072
00:57:23.881 --> 00:57:24.870
<v Speaker 5>You can use seeds.</v>

2073
00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:27.420
<v Speaker 5>There's seeds that you can get like um,</v>

2074
00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:28.321
<v Speaker 5>apricots,</v>

2075
00:57:28.321 --> 00:57:28.951
<v Speaker 5>facial scrub,</v>

2076
00:57:28.951 --> 00:57:32.640
<v Speaker 5>like it's an apricot seed and it's just as good and it's biodegradable,</v>

2077
00:57:32.830 --> 00:57:36.780

2082
00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:40.010
<v Speaker 6>Glasses do not.</v>

2083
00:57:40.011 --> 00:57:42.610
<v Speaker 6>I remember having my calculator watch and these glasses were really popular.</v>

2084
00:57:42.611 --> 00:57:42.911
<v Speaker 6>They're called,</v>

2085
00:57:42.911 --> 00:57:44.800
<v Speaker 6>they were called something awesome like douchebag,</v>

2086
00:57:44.830 --> 00:57:45.640
<v Speaker 6>Google glasses,</v>

2087
00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:47.030
<v Speaker 6>but it was a guy wore them</v>

2088
00:57:47.310 --> 00:57:47.840
<v Speaker 5>start,</v>

2089
00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:48.321
<v Speaker 5>start,</v>

2090
00:57:48.321 --> 00:57:48.780
<v Speaker 5>start,</v>

2091
00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:49.680
<v Speaker 5>start date or something.</v>

2092
00:57:51.270 --> 00:57:52.103
<v Speaker 5>Maybe</v>

2093
00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:53.313
<v Speaker 6>they had,</v>

2094
00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.330
<v Speaker 6>they had leather on the glasses.</v>

2095
00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:58.460
<v Speaker 6>It's like your car's had brawls on them.</v>

2096
00:57:58.461 --> 00:57:58.821
<v Speaker 6>It's just like,</v>

2097
00:57:58.821 --> 00:58:00.260
<v Speaker 6>we had this weird leathers.</v>

2098
00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:00.981
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

2099
00:58:00.981 --> 00:58:02.780
<v Speaker 6>you remember the Bronx who we should bring that back.</v>

2100
00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:04.580
<v Speaker 6>I think some people still do it,</v>

2101
00:58:04.581 --> 00:58:04.731
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2102
00:58:04.731 --> 00:58:06.110
<v Speaker 6>I saw a guy with a corvette</v>

2103
00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:07.660
<v Speaker 5>day at a bra and a corvette.</v>

2104
00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:08.861
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2105
00:58:08.861 --> 00:58:09.191
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

2106
00:58:09.191 --> 00:58:10.570
<v Speaker 5>you're rocking a brand new corvette.</v>

2107
00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:11.950
<v Speaker 5>Part was an old corvette.</v>

2108
00:58:11.951 --> 00:58:12.850
<v Speaker 5>Wasn't real leather though.</v>

2109
00:58:12.851 --> 00:58:13.684
<v Speaker 5>It was it.</v>

2110
00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:14.111
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2111
00:58:14.111 --> 00:58:14.944
<v Speaker 5>I didn't ask you.</v>

2112
00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:17.411
<v Speaker 5>That's a can of worms.</v>

2113
00:58:17.411 --> 00:58:18.430
<v Speaker 5>You don't really want to open up.</v>

2114
00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:19.853
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2115
00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:21.821
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

2116
00:58:21.821 --> 00:58:25.330
<v Speaker 5>Supra brought on my super course not that was the shit.</v>

2117
00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:25.661
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2118
00:58:25.661 --> 00:58:27.190
<v Speaker 5>I think I had a bra once,</v>

2119
00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:29.260
<v Speaker 5>but I think I got rid of it pretty quickly.</v>

2120
00:58:29.261 --> 00:58:29.621
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2121
00:58:29.621 --> 00:58:30.940
<v Speaker 5>what is this stupid fucking thing?</v>

2122
00:58:30.941 --> 00:58:31.774
<v Speaker 5>What am I doing here?</v>

2123
00:58:31.850 --> 00:58:32.421
<v Speaker 6>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2124
00:58:32.421 --> 00:58:35.450
<v Speaker 6>There was a weird time in the 80s that the leather,</v>

2125
00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:37.610
<v Speaker 6>like there was no reason to have leather on you.</v>

2126
00:58:37.611 --> 00:58:39.860
<v Speaker 6>Like look the big chunks of leather on your glasses.</v>

2127
00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:41.360
<v Speaker 6>I guess the idea is</v>

2128
00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:43.300
<v Speaker 5>you want something soft that does.</v>

2129
00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:45.460
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't take light in from the sides,</v>

2130
00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:47.410
<v Speaker 5>but that also fuck up your peripheral.</v>

2131
00:58:47.411 --> 00:58:49.030
<v Speaker 5>May you very susceptible to hooks.</v>

2132
00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:50.333
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2133
00:58:50.530 --> 00:58:54.140
<v Speaker 5>They should bring back the plastic covering for the couches now.</v>

2134
00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:55.313
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2135
00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:58.440
<v Speaker 5>that was a dream.</v>

2136
00:58:58.441 --> 00:58:58.891
<v Speaker 5>When people,</v>

2137
00:58:58.891 --> 00:59:01.500
<v Speaker 5>you go over their house and it was covered with clear plastic.</v>

2138
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.461
<v Speaker 5>Sit down.</v>

2139
00:59:02.461 --> 00:59:03.480
<v Speaker 5>It's at grandma's house.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She was wonderful.</v>

2196
01:00:11.181 --> 01:00:12.860
<v Speaker 2>What a crazy fucking show.</v>

2197
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:16.370
<v Speaker 2>You imagined that there was a show that they made and it's called leave it to</v>

2198
01:00:16.371 --> 01:00:17.204
<v Speaker 2>beaver.</v>

2199
01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:18.980
<v Speaker 2>And it was an actual show.</v>

2200
01:00:18.981 --> 01:00:20.300
<v Speaker 2>And the kid's name was beaver.</v>

2201
01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:23.660
<v Speaker 2>And at what point in Tom did they realize that that means pussy?</v>

2202
01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:27.470
<v Speaker 2>Was it like it started in the 1950s right.</v>

2203
01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:29.270
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

2204
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:30.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2205
01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.790
<v Speaker 2>first appearance was a,</v>

2206
01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:36.530
<v Speaker 2>it was a pilot that they made in 1957 so when did beaver become,</v>

2207
01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:38.180
<v Speaker 2>when did it become a vagina?</v>

2208
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:39.680
<v Speaker 2>Was that the 70s you think?</v>

2209
01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:41.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2210
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.590
<v Speaker 2>Maybe because everyone thought beaver was just like a pussy and so they just put</v>

2211
01:00:45.591 --> 01:00:47.960
<v Speaker 2>it together cause he had played it like a pussy character,</v>

2212
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2213
01:00:48.210 --> 01:00:49.043
<v Speaker 2>be where was,</v>

2214
01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:50.011
<v Speaker 2>well he wasn't,</v>

2215
01:00:50.011 --> 01:00:50.750
<v Speaker 2>he's getting beat up.</v>

2216
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:51.860
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a savage.</v>

2217
01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:52.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2218
01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.360
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was because of his teeth or something.</v>

2219
01:00:54.361 --> 01:00:55.710
<v Speaker 5>I thought he had like a beaver,</v>

2220
01:00:55.711 --> 01:00:56.700
<v Speaker 5>a facial,</v>

2221
01:00:56.701 --> 01:00:57.600
<v Speaker 5>a look or something.</v>

2222
01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:58.290
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

2223
01:00:58.290 --> 01:00:58.651
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>

2224
01:00:58.651 --> 01:00:59.131
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2225
01:00:59.131 --> 01:00:59.800
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

2226
01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:00.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2227
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:01.200
<v Speaker 5>This thing they did,</v>

2228
01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:04.170
<v Speaker 5>I really can't get named it after their teeth or something.</v>

2229
01:01:04.171 --> 01:01:04.650
<v Speaker 5>It'd be her,</v>

2230
01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:05.280
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2231
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.210
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

2232
01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:07.313
<v Speaker 5>The beaver,</v>

2233
01:01:07.870 --> 01:01:08.703
<v Speaker 5>the beef,</v>

2234
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.080
<v Speaker 5>where did that come from?</v>

2235
01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.030
<v Speaker 5>I think that was just his nickname.</v>

2236
01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:14.490
<v Speaker 5>How did he get it?</v>

2237
01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:15.181
<v Speaker 5>What did they say?</v>

2238
01:01:15.181 --> 01:01:15.810
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

2239
01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:16.880
<v Speaker 5>you smell bad or what?</v>

2240
01:01:16.881 --> 01:01:17.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

2241
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:18.800
<v Speaker 5>They looked at the time before the Internet.</v>

2242
01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:22.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like second was a slang term from the 1910 England.</v>

2243
01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:23.720
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever tried to watch that?</v>

2244
01:01:24.050 --> 01:01:25.580
<v Speaker 2>You ever tried to watch leave it to beaver?</v>

2245
01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:26.414
<v Speaker 2>I grew up on it.</v>

2246
01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:30.020
<v Speaker 2>We can get back to isolation tank talking a couple minutes.</v>

2247
01:01:30.021 --> 01:01:31.640
<v Speaker 2>We have plenty of time release and gentlemen.</v>

2248
01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:33.530
<v Speaker 2>But seeing as how we're in the flow of this,</v>

2249
01:01:33.531 --> 01:01:37.610
<v Speaker 2>I would like to watch a little quick leave it to beaver episode just to see how</v>

2250
01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:42.050
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous the world was in 1957 real quick.</v>

2251
01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:45.190
<v Speaker 5>Even the opening when they have their house and it's all nice.</v>

2252
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:46.720
<v Speaker 5>We probably Dennis the menace.</v>

2253
01:01:46.721 --> 01:01:47.830
<v Speaker 5>Remember Mr. Wilson,</v>

2254
01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:49.480
<v Speaker 5>he was over there and he was like,</v>

2255
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:50.050
<v Speaker 5>oh John,</v>

2256
01:01:50.050 --> 01:01:51.660
<v Speaker 5>you manis or whatever you say.</v>

2257
01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:53.030
<v Speaker 2>She and Mr. Wilson,</v>

2258
01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:55.490
<v Speaker 2>they used to talk to each other.</v>

2259
01:01:55.491 --> 01:01:56.840
<v Speaker 2>It was so alien.</v>

2260
01:01:57.530 --> 01:01:59.750
<v Speaker 2>People hadn't figured out television yet.</v>

2261
01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.001
<v Speaker 2>That's would,</v>

2262
01:02:01.001 --> 01:02:03.200
<v Speaker 2>they hadn't figured out how other people are gonna perceive them.</v>

2263
01:02:03.201 --> 01:02:07.250
<v Speaker 2>There was like a slow change where people recognize bullshit and they were</v>

2264
01:02:07.251 --> 01:02:08.930
<v Speaker 2>allowed to do less and less of it.</v>

2265
01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:11.180
<v Speaker 2>And if you go back and you watch father knows best,</v>

2266
01:02:11.181 --> 01:02:11.780
<v Speaker 2>here it is.</v>

<v Speaker 7>When did you decide to tell us about it?</v>

2284
01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:47.670
<v Speaker 7>When I was walking the bike home from Larry's,</v>

2285
01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.370
<v Speaker 7>it's too big for him to ride.</v>

2286
01:02:53.530 --> 01:02:55.380
<v Speaker 7>Glad you decided to tell us the truth.</v>

2287
01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:58.390
<v Speaker 2>Of course you realize you can't keep a bicycle.</v>

2288
01:02:58.391 --> 01:03:00.100
<v Speaker 2>You one why'd you were being disobedient.</v>

2289
01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:02.440
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have to find something to do with the bike.</v>

2290
01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:04.283
<v Speaker 2>Dad's,</v>

2291
01:03:04.570 --> 01:03:06.210
<v Speaker 2>that's a kid came clean.</v>

2292
01:03:06.211 --> 01:03:07.430
<v Speaker 2>Let him keep the bike dad,</v>

2293
01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.100
<v Speaker 2>the bike kind of fucking lessons.</v>

2294
01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:10.360
<v Speaker 2>You teach it some bullshit.</v>

2295
01:03:10.570 --> 01:03:11.650
<v Speaker 2>He didn't do anything illegal.</v>

2296
01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:12.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2297
01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:14.650
<v Speaker 2>I came forward and told him what the story was.</v>

2298
01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.510
<v Speaker 2>That's the kind of stuff that the kids,</v>

2299
01:03:16.511 --> 01:03:16.810
<v Speaker 2>now it's,</v>

2300
01:03:16.810 --> 01:03:17.111
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2301
01:03:17.111 --> 01:03:19.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid to go tell pop because you've got to take my bike away.</v>

2302
01:03:19.570 --> 01:03:24.570
<v Speaker 2>That some 1957 type of psychology in 2014 I think they would say the best way to</v>

2303
01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:29.260
<v Speaker 2>make this go away or to make it never happen again is a reward him with the bike</v>

2304
01:03:29.650 --> 01:03:30.580
<v Speaker 2>to reward him and say,</v>

2305
01:03:30.581 --> 01:03:31.151
<v Speaker 2>look you,</v>

2306
01:03:31.151 --> 01:03:34.630
<v Speaker 2>you did a good job by telling me in the future you would benefit much more from</v>

2307
01:03:34.631 --> 01:03:36.430
<v Speaker 2>just doing what I tell you in the beginning.</v>

2308
01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:37.121
<v Speaker 2>Don't be lying,</v>

2309
01:03:37.121 --> 01:03:37.954
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

2310
01:03:38.290 --> 01:03:39.010
<v Speaker 2>Go ride your bike.</v>

2311
01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:40.840
<v Speaker 2>And then he thinks Dad's cool,</v>

2312
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:41.661
<v Speaker 2>not dad.</v>

2313
01:03:41.661 --> 01:03:44.770
<v Speaker 2>Some Dick is going to take my fucking lawfully one bike.</v>

2314
01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:46.000
<v Speaker 2>He won the bike.</v>

2315
01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:46.601
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

2316
01:03:46.601 --> 01:03:47.980
<v Speaker 2>that was a bad example.</v>

2317
01:03:47.981 --> 01:03:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Dad thought this was going to be good stuff.</v>

2318
01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:50.171
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2319
01:03:50.171 --> 01:03:50.981
<v Speaker 2>Well that was good.</v>

2320
01:03:50.981 --> 01:03:52.030
<v Speaker 2>That was a bummer man.</v>

2321
01:03:52.031 --> 01:03:53.790
<v Speaker 2>I love her.</v>

2322
01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:54.633
<v Speaker 2>I love the word.</v>

2323
01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:56.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2324
01:03:56.831 --> 01:03:57.664
<v Speaker 2>it is a bummer.</v>

2325
01:03:58.620 --> 01:03:59.051
<v Speaker 2>Well it's,</v>

2326
01:03:59.051 --> 01:03:59.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2327
01:03:59.351 --> 01:04:00.850
<v Speaker 2>it's 1957 logic.</v>

2328
01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.500
<v Speaker 2>They just weren't that good at TV yet.</v>

2329
01:04:02.530 --> 01:04:03.640
<v Speaker 2>They didn't understand.</v>

2330
01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:06.280
<v Speaker 2>They didn't understand how it was coming off to other people.</v>

2331
01:04:06.281 --> 01:04:06.431
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2332
01:04:06.431 --> 01:04:08.380
<v Speaker 2>we just watched that and it looks so ridiculous,</v>

2333
01:04:08.381 --> 01:04:08.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2334
01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:08.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2335
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:12.140
<v Speaker 2>it real ad you've got that horse</v>

2336
01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:18.430
<v Speaker 2>which go back to isolation tanks if Ricky time in television,</v>

2337
01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:19.000
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

2338
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.110
<v Speaker 2>it's indicative of this thing that I think we're experiencing this thing that</v>

2339
01:04:23.111 --> 01:04:26.050
<v Speaker 2>everything is constantly improving and one of the best ways to see that</v>

2340
01:04:26.051 --> 01:04:26.531
<v Speaker 2>improvement.</v>

2341
01:04:26.531 --> 01:04:27.364
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't,</v>

2342
01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.560
<v Speaker 2>if you want it to determine the age of a tree,</v>

2343
01:04:29.561 --> 01:04:31.660
<v Speaker 2>you would chop the tree down and he'd look at the rings of the tree.</v>

2344
01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:37.270
<v Speaker 2>I think if you wanted to determine the progress of our culture in terms of like</v>

2345
01:04:37.271 --> 01:04:38.081
<v Speaker 2>the rings on a tree,</v>

2346
01:04:38.081 --> 01:04:39.490
<v Speaker 2>like in that sort of a way,</v>

2347
01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:40.660
<v Speaker 2>there's no better way to do it.</v>

2348
01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Then they go back and look at the sections of our media,</v>

2349
01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:46.390
<v Speaker 2>go back and look at like the $6 million man.</v>

2350
01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:46.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2351
01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:49.390
<v Speaker 2>go back and look at the fall guy.</v>

2352
01:04:49.391 --> 01:04:52.330
<v Speaker 2>Go back and look at the incredible hulk.</v>

2353
01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Go back and look at,</v>

2354
01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:54.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2355
01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:55.630
<v Speaker 2>the evolution of TV.</v>

2356
01:04:55.631 --> 01:04:56.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2357
01:04:56.050 --> 01:04:56.860
<v Speaker 2>Dallas,</v>

2358
01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:57.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2359
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:58.780
<v Speaker 2>watch old television.</v>

2360
01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:03.760
<v Speaker 2>Watch the Dukes of Hazard Watch old television shows and then go back to leave</v>

2361
01:05:03.761 --> 01:05:04.511
<v Speaker 2>it to beaver,</v>

2362
01:05:04.511 --> 01:05:05.800
<v Speaker 2>go back to this shit,</v>

2363
01:05:05.830 --> 01:05:08.770
<v Speaker 2>get back to this craziness that we're watching and then realize like,</v>

2364
01:05:08.771 --> 01:05:09.041
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

2365
01:05:09.041 --> 01:05:13.960
<v Speaker 2>there was like this weird steady progression up to x files and then you know,</v>

2366
01:05:13.961 --> 01:05:14.741
<v Speaker 2>game of Thrones,</v>

2367
01:05:14.741 --> 01:05:17.230
<v Speaker 2>like the media has improved.</v>

2368
01:05:17.290 --> 01:05:19.810
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a totally different organism.</v>

2369
01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:23.950
<v Speaker 2>The type of shows you see if you watch a modern day episode of game of Thrones,</v>

2370
01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:29.170
<v Speaker 2>and there's not a film that was made in the 1960s that could compare to that.</v>

2371
01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:30.843
<v Speaker 2>I don't get,</v>

2372
01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:33.130
<v Speaker 2>I think Stanley Kubrick was a genius.</v>

2373
01:05:33.131 --> 01:05:38.080
<v Speaker 2>I think 2000 West Bass Odyssey was a marvel of of cinema for the time,</v>

2374
01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:41.470
<v Speaker 2>but it can't fuck with what they have now on TV.</v>

2375
01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.350
<v Speaker 2>Hbo,</v>

2376
01:05:42.350 --> 01:05:46.600
<v Speaker 2>game of Thrones is one of the best movies of all time and it's like 10 hours</v>

2377
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:47.530
<v Speaker 2>every season.</v>

2378
01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:48.910
<v Speaker 2>It's madness.</v>

2379
01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:49.691
<v Speaker 2>It's 7 billion.</v>

2380
01:05:49.691 --> 01:05:50.560
<v Speaker 2>It was it 4 million.</v>

2381
01:05:50.561 --> 01:05:51.550
<v Speaker 2>What's the cost on that?</v>

2382
01:05:51.551 --> 01:05:52.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2383
01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:55.000
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be expensive as fuck her episode.</v>

2384
01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:56.140
<v Speaker 2>It's perfect.</v>

2385
01:05:56.170 --> 01:05:56.920
<v Speaker 2>It's a fuck.</v>

2386
01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.330
<v Speaker 2>It's a perfect show.</v>

2387
01:05:58.720 --> 01:05:59.890
<v Speaker 2>And my point being,</v>

2388
01:05:59.891 --> 01:06:02.620
<v Speaker 2>if you try to compare game of Thrones to father knows best,</v>

2389
01:06:02.621 --> 01:06:03.580
<v Speaker 2>it's insane.</v>

2390
01:06:03.850 --> 01:06:04.870
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to believe it.</v>

2391
01:06:04.871 --> 01:06:09.250
<v Speaker 2>These are made for the same organism and you got it occupied the same amount of</v>

2392
01:06:09.251 --> 01:06:10.630
<v Speaker 2>time of a person's interest.</v>

2393
01:06:10.690 --> 01:06:11.523
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2394
01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:12.341
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>

2395
01:06:12.341 --> 01:06:15.190
<v Speaker 2>It's gotten to hold somebody's interest and I think it's that.</v>

2396
01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:20.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a continual improvement in the understanding of human beings</v>

2397
01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:24.280
<v Speaker 2>and I think it takes something really intense to rattle us.</v>

2398
01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.680
<v Speaker 2>Now it takes like a true detective.</v>

2399
01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.870
<v Speaker 2>It takes like it's,</v>

2400
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:31.690
<v Speaker 2>you can't just have a normal relationship like bridges of Madison County.</v>

2401
01:06:31.691 --> 01:06:32.590
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Get out of here.</v>

2415
01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile you watch game of Thrones.</v>

2416

2417

2419
01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:52.500
<v Speaker 2>People were sword fighting in the middle of the night of was white walkers.</v>

2420
01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:52.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>How about the giants are great.</v>

2423
01:06:57.610 --> 01:06:58.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a madness show.</v>

2424
01:06:58.661 --> 01:07:00.770
<v Speaker 2>I love the crazy shit is happening and crazy stuff.</v>

2425
01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:05.790
<v Speaker 2>What the humans do to each other is so shocking and if you tried to watch,</v>

2426
01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:08.160
<v Speaker 2>if you tried to watch um,</v>

2427
01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.150
<v Speaker 2>a magnum Pi after that,</v>

2428
01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:10.511
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>

2429
01:07:10.511 --> 01:07:11.344
<v Speaker 2>come on man,</v>

2430
01:07:11.730 --> 01:07:13.630
<v Speaker 2>it's the world's changed.</v>

2431
01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:17.980
<v Speaker 2>We've gotten a much deeper understanding of what really freaks people out and we</v>

2432
01:07:17.981 --> 01:07:21.460
<v Speaker 2>require that to get freaked out or today's trolls.</v>

2433
01:07:21.461 --> 01:07:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Today's Youtube trolls could start wars in the 1940s if he could send those guys</v>

2434
01:07:26.201 --> 01:07:26.861
<v Speaker 2>back at time,</v>

2435
01:07:26.861 --> 01:07:28.600
<v Speaker 2>like the really sophisticated trolls,</v>

2436
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:29.681
<v Speaker 2>the ones we read,</v>

2437
01:07:29.681 --> 01:07:33.070
<v Speaker 2>their Twitter account and you can barely even tell if they're trolling.</v>

2438
01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:34.061
<v Speaker 2>They're just so,</v>

2439
01:07:34.061 --> 01:07:36.880
<v Speaker 2>and then you watch like some of the arguments that get into the skies and</v>

2440
01:07:36.881 --> 01:07:37.360
<v Speaker 2>artists.</v>

2441
01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:38.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that is.</v>

2442
01:07:38.290 --> 01:07:40.350
<v Speaker 2>Trolling is save.</v>

2443
01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:41.500
<v Speaker 2>Somebody wanted to reach out to,</v>

2444
01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:43.210
<v Speaker 2>I should probably not tell you the trolls get mad.</v>

2445
01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:43.901
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck?</v>

2446
01:07:43.901 --> 01:07:44.734
<v Speaker 2>We got a fresh one.</v>

2447
01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:46.380
<v Speaker 2>We've got to lie on the bed.</v>

2448
01:07:46.490 --> 01:07:47.630
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to call me out.</v>

2449
01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:49.480
<v Speaker 2>It's not a call you out thing.</v>

2450
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:52.210
<v Speaker 2>They would contact you in some sort of a way.</v>

2451
01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Either insulting you and try and get you to respond to them or mockingly in love</v>

2452
01:07:57.911 --> 01:08:01.090
<v Speaker 2>with you to try to get you to respond to them and then turn on you.</v>

2453
01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:02.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2454
01:08:02.050 --> 01:08:07.050
<v Speaker 2>they would try to pretend that they were outraged about certain specific issues</v>

2455
01:08:07.331 --> 01:08:08.620
<v Speaker 2>just to get a rise out of you.</v>

2456
01:08:09.070 --> 01:08:12.280
<v Speaker 2>Try to engage you in just an as a game.</v>

2457
01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:13.750
<v Speaker 2>There's people now that have,</v>

2458
01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:14.830
<v Speaker 2>there's a group of folks,</v>

2459
01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 2>that kind of stuff.</v>

2460
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:16.963
<v Speaker 5>It's a sport.</v>

2461
01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:17.803
<v Speaker 5>It's a sport.</v>

2462
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:19.070
<v Speaker 5>It is kind of a sport,</v>

2463
01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:19.491
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2464
01:08:19.491 --> 01:08:21.800
<v Speaker 5>if you can get a good one on the line.</v>

2465
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:22.723
<v Speaker 5>Yeah know,</v>

2466
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:24.150
<v Speaker 5>oh my,</v>

2467
01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:25.790
<v Speaker 5>I haven't gotten on the line before.</v>

2468
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:26.923
<v Speaker 5>It's hilarious.</v>

2469
01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:27.650
<v Speaker 5>Got You.</v>

2470
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:28.101
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2471
01:08:28.101 --> 01:08:30.950
<v Speaker 5>I get rid of it and gotten in arguments with people before and you realize like,</v>

2472
01:08:30.951 --> 01:08:31.430
<v Speaker 5>what am I,</v>

2473
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:33.230
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know you and you.</v>

2474
01:08:33.290 --> 01:08:37.550
<v Speaker 5>It takes a lot of time to realize that because the Internet is a new thing in</v>

2475
01:08:37.551 --> 01:08:41.840
<v Speaker 5>the interacting with people on the Internet is what's been around 10 years.</v>

2476
01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:44.630
<v Speaker 5>If I study your buttons to say something like that,</v>

2477
01:08:44.631 --> 01:08:48.500
<v Speaker 5>you see what he does when you say that the longest people were interacting on</v>

2478
01:08:48.501 --> 01:08:49.460
<v Speaker 5>the Internet like this,</v>

2479
01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:51.470
<v Speaker 5>like in this sort of like instantaneous,</v>

2480
01:08:51.471 --> 01:08:53.570
<v Speaker 5>like Twitter type comments or youtube type comments.</v>

2481
01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:54.681
<v Speaker 5>That's never,</v>

2482
01:08:54.681 --> 01:08:56.570
<v Speaker 5>it hasn't been more than a decade.</v>

2483
01:08:56.690 --> 01:08:57.710
<v Speaker 5>This is a new thing.</v>

2484
01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.120
<v Speaker 5>It was a new thing for people.</v>

2485
01:08:59.121 --> 01:09:00.530
<v Speaker 5>So people who were,</v>

2486
01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.010
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2487
01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:02.690
<v Speaker 5>who liked to get a rise out of people.</v>

2488
01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:03.770
<v Speaker 5>If you can't do it at work,</v>

2489
01:09:03.771 --> 01:09:08.210
<v Speaker 5>especially if you're stuck at a job that sucks and you have no means of</v>

2490
01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:10.390
<v Speaker 5>expression of the evil inside you.</v>

2491
01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:15.260
<v Speaker 5>That's why I wonder why does it people watch these videos and then say that like</v>

2492
01:09:15.261 --> 01:09:16.094
<v Speaker 5>with Hamilton,</v>

2493
01:09:16.190 --> 01:09:18.470
<v Speaker 5>they watched the video there and then their comics.</v>

2494
01:09:18.471 --> 01:09:19.470
<v Speaker 5>I don't Hamilton Morris,</v>

2495
01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:21.201
<v Speaker 5>Hamilton Morris.</v>

2496
01:09:21.201 --> 01:09:22.370
<v Speaker 5>We owe him an apology.</v>

2497
01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:25.520
<v Speaker 5>I mean when that podcast was made,</v>

2498
01:09:25.521 --> 01:09:27.410
<v Speaker 5>we both got way too.</v>

2499
01:09:27.411 --> 01:09:30.230
<v Speaker 5>Hi Brian and I got him.</v>

2500
01:09:30.231 --> 01:09:33.310
<v Speaker 5>We took him to the center of the earth this morning.</v>

2501
01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:35.150
<v Speaker 5>We took him to more door.</v>

2502
01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:40.460
<v Speaker 5>We have this weed that was grown on Pluto and came over here in a time capsule.</v>

2503
01:09:40.670 --> 01:09:42.650
<v Speaker 5>I don't know where we got that shit from.</v>

2504
01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:43.610
<v Speaker 5>Who?</v>

2505
01:09:43.610 --> 01:09:44.450
<v Speaker 5>Who's was that?</v>

2506
01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.290
<v Speaker 5>I didn't remember.</v>

2507
01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:45.830
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even,</v>

2508
01:09:45.830 --> 01:09:46.790
<v Speaker 5>well you didn't have to twist.</v>

2509
01:09:46.810 --> 01:09:51.590
<v Speaker 5>This is where there with Hamilton Morris who is the psychedelic.</v>

2510
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:52.670
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

2511
01:09:52.670 --> 01:09:57.260
<v Speaker 5>So we went to the bottom of the swimming pool and fucking set up a picnic table.</v>

2512
01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:59.060
<v Speaker 5>I mean we went deep.</v>

2513
01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:00.320
<v Speaker 5>It was rough man.</v>

2514
01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:02.030
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what the fuck we're talking about.</v>

2515
01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:03.980
<v Speaker 5>Half the time we were in a conversation,</v>

2516
01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:05.060
<v Speaker 5>we were like seven,</v>

2517
01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:09.140
<v Speaker 5>eight hits and have some insane sativa and there was no way we should have been</v>

2518
01:10:09.141 --> 01:10:11.180
<v Speaker 5>having a conversation in a podcast.</v>

2519
01:10:11.210 --> 01:10:12.043
<v Speaker 5>No Way.</v>

2520
01:10:12.230 --> 01:10:12.770
<v Speaker 5>We were just,</v>

2521
01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:13.441
<v Speaker 5>we were wage.</v>

2522
01:10:13.441 --> 01:10:14.300
<v Speaker 5>You barbecued.</v>

2523
01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:15.100
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2524
01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:16.100
<v Speaker 5>I turned out okay.</v>

2525
01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:16.963
<v Speaker 5>It was not bad.</v>

2526
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:19.850
<v Speaker 5>We interact with him in the tank was better,</v>

2527
01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:21.051
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing,</v>

2528
01:10:21.051 --> 01:10:21.884
<v Speaker 5>you know that.</v>

2529
01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.300
<v Speaker 5>But the comments were evil.</v>

2530
01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:23.631
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2531
01:10:23.631 --> 01:10:24.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2532
01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:26.150
<v Speaker 5>even on some of these other ones you read and they say,</v>

2533
01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:26.421
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2534
01:10:26.421 --> 01:10:26.751
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2535
01:10:26.751 --> 01:10:28.250
<v Speaker 5>this or that or this guy,</v>

2536
01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.870
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to make an assumption,</v>

2537
01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:30.130
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2538
01:10:30.130 --> 01:10:32.690
<v Speaker 5>an evaluation about somebody they don't know anything about.</v>

2539
01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:37.580
<v Speaker 5>And the fact that you just spent your time over viewing what it is they just did</v>

2540
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:40.310
<v Speaker 5>and now you're going to be a mean spirited about it.</v>

2541
01:10:40.330 --> 01:10:40.820
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2542
01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:41.870
<v Speaker 5>Why don't you just don't do it.</v>

2543
01:10:41.871 --> 01:10:42.704
<v Speaker 5>Just don't look just,</v>

2544
01:10:43.150 --> 01:10:43.461
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2545
01:10:43.461 --> 01:10:45.110
<v Speaker 5>but you find that I didn't know,</v>

2546
01:10:45.111 --> 01:10:47.360
<v Speaker 5>these are these kinds of cats that that's what they're up to,</v>

2547
01:10:47.361 --> 01:10:51.300
<v Speaker 5>these trolls that they enjoy and make an uh,</v>

2548
01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:52.130
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2549
01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:53.600
<v Speaker 5>getting a rise out of people,</v>

2550
01:10:53.601 --> 01:10:56.750
<v Speaker 5>which is a bummer when you don't have a lot of time to get her because you're</v>

2551
01:10:56.751 --> 01:10:59.210
<v Speaker 5>trying to get through life without as little as these,</v>

2552
01:10:59.290 --> 01:11:00.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2553
01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:03.950
<v Speaker 5>infractions as possible so you could keep your mind in a positive,</v>

2554
01:11:04.290 --> 01:11:04.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2555
01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:08.450
<v Speaker 5>format and then somebody saying something mean or ugly about you and you're</v>

2556
01:11:08.451 --> 01:11:09.284
<v Speaker 5>reading it and you're going,</v>

2557
01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.041
<v Speaker 5>Oh shit man,</v>

2558
01:11:10.041 --> 01:11:11.750
<v Speaker 5>I wish that that didn't get said about me.</v>

2559
01:11:11.751 --> 01:11:12.584
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2560
01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.250
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a benefit</v>

2561
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:15.083
<v Speaker 1>to it though.</v>

2562
01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:18.120
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a benefit to interacting with negative people is that you</v>

2563
01:11:18.121 --> 01:11:20.250
<v Speaker 1>understand that there are negative people out there.</v>

2564
01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:20.761
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you,</v>

2565
01:11:20.761 --> 01:11:22.680
<v Speaker 1>if you don't interact with them on a regular basis,</v>

2566
01:11:22.681 --> 01:11:25.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you'll appreciate the positive people as much.</v>

2567
01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:28.770
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's just the weird aspect of human beings.</v>

2568
01:11:28.771 --> 01:11:30.570
<v Speaker 1>We get accustomed to whatever,</v>

2569
01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:31.651
<v Speaker 1>we get accustomed to,</v>

2570
01:11:31.651 --> 01:11:32.431
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of things.</v>

2571
01:11:32.431 --> 01:11:33.630
<v Speaker 1>It seems unacceptable.</v>

2572
01:11:33.810 --> 01:11:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at the things and customs that people,</v>

2573
01:11:36.261 --> 01:11:36.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2574
01:11:36.510 --> 01:11:37.800
<v Speaker 1>carry on in other countries,</v>

2575
01:11:37.801 --> 01:11:41.790
<v Speaker 1>there's certain rites of passage for manhood that if you tried to implement</v>

2576
01:11:41.791 --> 01:11:42.780
<v Speaker 1>today in the United States,</v>

2577
01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:46.680
<v Speaker 1>like the weird shit that they do in Africa where it circumcising each other with</v>

2578
01:11:46.681 --> 01:11:51.681
<v Speaker 1>sharp sticks and they have to go crawl through thorn bushes naked,</v>

2579
01:11:51.871 --> 01:11:55.260
<v Speaker 1>like a bunch of crazy shit they make these guys do.</v>

2580
01:11:55.530 --> 01:11:57.960
<v Speaker 1>And if you try to implement that stuff in America today,</v>

2581
01:11:57.961 --> 01:11:58.710
<v Speaker 1>we would laugh at you.</v>

2582
01:11:58.710 --> 01:12:00.960
<v Speaker 1>But to them like this is how they've done it.</v>

2583
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:02.700
<v Speaker 1>This is how they've done it for a long time.</v>

2584
01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.160
<v Speaker 1>And people get used to all sorts of weird shit.</v>

2585
01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:06.300
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

2586
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:09.990
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people have gotten used to something that just raw,</v>

2587
01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:14.460
<v Speaker 1>it rages against their sensibilities and it rages against their body,</v>

2588
01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:17.610
<v Speaker 1>rages against their sensibilities because they've somehow or another committed</v>

2589
01:12:17.611 --> 01:12:22.020
<v Speaker 1>themselves to a safe job that is not inspiring.</v>

2590
01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:25.950
<v Speaker 1>And they think that maybe if they just waited a little while or thought about it</v>

2591
01:12:25.951 --> 01:12:26.191
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

2592
01:12:26.191 --> 01:12:29.100
<v Speaker 1>they could have eventually figured out how to do what they actually want to do.</v>

2593
01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:31.400
<v Speaker 1>And when you're wanting to someone who,</v>

2594
01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:32.580
<v Speaker 1>who has done that,</v>

2595
01:12:32.581 --> 01:12:35.880
<v Speaker 1>then you see the benefit of it and it fucks with people's heads,</v>

2596
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:36.211
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2597
01:12:36.211 --> 01:12:39.360
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's a lot of people that live a life of regret and bitter.</v>

2598
01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Super unfortunate.</v>

2599
01:12:41.010 --> 01:12:41.520
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2600
01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.353
<v Speaker 1>And I think</v>

2601
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:46.080
<v Speaker 1>the way our society is structured currently,</v>

2602
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:46.943
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2603
01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:49.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that changing anytime soon.</v>

2604
01:12:50.490 --> 01:12:55.170
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like so many people are rushing out to enter into the workforce</v>

2605
01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.600
<v Speaker 1>because the economy is not so good.</v>

2606
01:12:57.601 --> 01:13:01.350
<v Speaker 1>So everybody's scrapping for jobs and they're willing to take jobs they might</v>

2607
01:13:01.351 --> 01:13:06.030
<v Speaker 1>not have ordinary ordinarily taken because they want the security of it.</v>

2608
01:13:06.210 --> 01:13:08.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a very trying time for a lot of people,</v>

2609
01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:12.000
<v Speaker 1>but if you could figure out a way to separate on your own,</v>

2610
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:13.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2611
01:13:13.111 --> 01:13:16.950
<v Speaker 1>selling coffee mugs are fucking figuring something out,</v>

2612
01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:17.541
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

2613
01:13:17.541 --> 01:13:18.750
<v Speaker 1>you'll be so much better off.</v>

2614
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:23.720
<v Speaker 4>Well it allows you to be more independent and your ability to provide for</v>

2615
01:13:23.721 --> 01:13:24.350
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

2616
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:26.120
<v Speaker 4>If you could figure out something you can do.</v>

2617
01:13:26.450 --> 01:13:29.750
<v Speaker 4>What I find to be a little bit discouraging is the uh,</v>

2618
01:13:30.050 --> 01:13:33.950
<v Speaker 4>the lack of a interest in manufacturing products.</v>

2619
01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:34.530
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

2620
01:13:34.530 --> 01:13:35.363
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2621
01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:36.240
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>

2622
01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:37.550
<v Speaker 4>like this country used to be,</v>

2623
01:13:37.551 --> 01:13:37.880
<v Speaker 4>like I say,</v>

2624
01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:41.390
<v Speaker 4>really have a lot of pride and craftsmanship.</v>

2625
01:13:41.391 --> 01:13:41.511
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2626
01:13:41.511 --> 01:13:43.400
<v Speaker 4>we still have a talent pool here.</v>

2627
01:13:43.730 --> 01:13:45.290
<v Speaker 4>We have a lot of creative people.</v>

2628
01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:46.850
<v Speaker 4>We have a lot of uh,</v>

2629
01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:47.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2630
01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:52.280
<v Speaker 4>intelligent people and we need to pull these people together and get back into</v>

2631
01:13:52.281 --> 01:13:54.020
<v Speaker 4>manufacturing our own products here.</v>

2632
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:55.423
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2633
01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:58.580
<v Speaker 4>that's what I believe would be a good thing to get kids.</v>

2634
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.470
<v Speaker 4>They took auto shop out of the school,</v>

2635
01:14:00.471 --> 01:14:00.951
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

2636
01:14:00.951 --> 01:14:03.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that they do the welding anymore in school wood shop.</v>

2637
01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:05.210
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what they do in school.</v>

2638
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:06.600
<v Speaker 4>A lot of schools don't a lot school</v>

2639
01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:07.520
<v Speaker 1>have that anymore.</v>

2640
01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:08.960
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of liability issues.</v>

2641
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Those things to people.</v>

2642
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:12.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's very common.</v>

2643
01:14:12.930 --> 01:14:16.470
<v Speaker 4>It's not something they teach kids how to use a hammer.</v>

2644
01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:17.220
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2645
01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:18.090
<v Speaker 4>you go to school,</v>

2646
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:20.430
<v Speaker 4>you should teach a kid how to work a hammer or a saw.</v>

2647
01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:20.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2648
01:14:20.601 --> 01:14:21.270
<v Speaker 1>I think you know,</v>

2649
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:25.160
<v Speaker 1>the ebb and flow that we were talking about with technology and that people,</v>

2650
01:14:25.161 --> 01:14:25.490
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

2651
01:14:25.490 --> 01:14:29.000
<v Speaker 1>some folks kind of like bouncing back the other way and looking towards</v>

2652
01:14:29.001 --> 01:14:31.340
<v Speaker 1>mechanical things and being in love with mechanical things.</v>

2653
01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:34.910
<v Speaker 1>I think that also is going to be said about working for big companies that I</v>

2654
01:14:34.911 --> 01:14:38.090
<v Speaker 1>think that a lot of these people are going to get this feeling of like,</v>

2655
01:14:38.091 --> 01:14:38.391
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2656
01:14:38.391 --> 01:14:40.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm just lost in this sea of people.</v>

2657
01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I can make kitchen knives.</v>

2658
01:14:44.061 --> 01:14:47.090
<v Speaker 1>I can make handmade kitchen knives in my garage over the weekend,</v>

2659
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:48.680
<v Speaker 1>start selling them,</v>

2660
01:14:48.770 --> 01:14:51.500
<v Speaker 1>and then one day or another eventually break through.</v>

2661
01:14:51.501 --> 01:14:54.440
<v Speaker 1>I've got a website from Squarespace and I put together this fucking knife</v>

2662
01:14:54.441 --> 01:14:57.350
<v Speaker 1>collection and now I'm selling them online and now I'm independent</v>

2663
01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:59.840
<v Speaker 4>because using a Monte TV chef,</v>

2664
01:15:00.050 --> 01:15:01.760
<v Speaker 4>Luigi is endorsed my,</v>

2665
01:15:01.761 --> 01:15:02.594
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2666
01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:05.260
<v Speaker 1>that shit you want some handmade like does a company.</v>

2667
01:15:05.261 --> 01:15:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2668
01:15:05.850 --> 01:15:08.620
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of companies that have sent me a crest trail,</v>

2669
01:15:08.621 --> 01:15:09.310
<v Speaker 1>knives,</v>

2670
01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:11.500
<v Speaker 1>kestrel knives and a vehement knives.</v>

2671
01:15:11.501 --> 01:15:13.300
<v Speaker 1>And there were companies that did the exact same thing.</v>

2672
01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:16.830
<v Speaker 1>They just started making knives and start selling them that were in tonight's,</v>

2673
01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:20.070
<v Speaker 1>they loved the beauty of the construction of the NYSE VM at knife.</v>

2674
01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:21.340
<v Speaker 1>They made me this fucking big,</v>

2675
01:15:21.341 --> 01:15:21.821
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

2676
01:15:21.821 --> 01:15:22.601
<v Speaker 1>cool thing.</v>

2677
01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:25.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like all the handles all handmade.</v>

2678
01:15:25.551 --> 01:15:26.330
<v Speaker 1>And when you,</v>

2679
01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:26.860
<v Speaker 1>when you know,</v>

2680
01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:29.140
<v Speaker 1>you see that someone can make a living doing that and like can,</v>

2681
01:15:29.141 --> 01:15:30.880
<v Speaker 1>when you're chopping onions with something like that,</v>

2682
01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:34.600
<v Speaker 1>are you doing something in the kitchen or you're using it for camping or hunting</v>

2683
01:15:34.601 --> 01:15:35.261
<v Speaker 1>or something like that?</v>

2684
01:15:35.261 --> 01:15:38.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're feeling like you have a piece of craftsmanship with you.</v>

2685
01:15:38.290 --> 01:15:39.123
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

2686
01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:40.093
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

2687
01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2688
01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.030
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>

2689
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:42.970
<v Speaker 1>there's a connection to the person who made it,</v>

2690
01:15:42.971 --> 01:15:43.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2691
01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2692
01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:44.920
<v Speaker 1>Like a more obvious connection.</v>

2693
01:15:45.130 --> 01:15:45.963
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2694
01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Like if you had a handmade,</v>

2695
01:15:47.041 --> 01:15:48.390
<v Speaker 1>like my friend Ari went to China,</v>

2696
01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.570
<v Speaker 1>get a handmade suit,</v>

2697

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2702
01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:55.871
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2703
01:15:55.871 --> 01:15:58.780
<v Speaker 1>there's something extra jazzy about the fact that you know,</v>

2704
01:15:58.781 --> 01:15:59.800
<v Speaker 1>that a guy made this for you.</v>

2705
01:15:59.801 --> 01:16:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Like that feels good.</v>

2706
01:16:00.610 --> 01:16:01.120
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

2707
01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:01.781
<v Speaker 4>He took your,</v>

2708
01:16:01.781 --> 01:16:03.490
<v Speaker 4>your proportions into consideration.</v>

2709
01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:03.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2710
01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.950
<v Speaker 4>Cause you're six feet tall doesn't mean that your,</v>

2711
01:16:05.951 --> 01:16:09.210
<v Speaker 4>your knees are bending here or your stride is this or that.</v>

2712
01:16:09.330 --> 01:16:09.851
<v Speaker 1>And is,</v>

2713
01:16:09.851 --> 01:16:10.810
<v Speaker 1>he's an artisan.</v>

2714
01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:11.411
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2715
01:16:11.411 --> 01:16:13.330
<v Speaker 1>he's an artist and he creates a beautiful suit.</v>

2716
01:16:13.331 --> 01:16:13.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2717
01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:15.210
<v Speaker 4>it's a pleasure out of that.</v>

2718
01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:16.520
<v Speaker 4>So that's back to that,</v>

2719
01:16:16.521 --> 01:16:16.791
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2720
01:16:16.791 --> 01:16:18.300
<v Speaker 4>that feeling of accomplishment.</v>

2721
01:16:18.330 --> 01:16:20.700
<v Speaker 4>W you could feel like by making stuff.</v>

2722
01:16:20.930 --> 01:16:21.041
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2723
01:16:21.041 --> 01:16:21.780
<v Speaker 4>look at,</v>

2724
01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:22.740
<v Speaker 4>I feel good about that.</v>

2725
01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:24.000
<v Speaker 4>Like what we do with the chambers,</v>

2726
01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:24.630
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

2727
01:16:24.630 --> 01:16:25.350
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2728
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:30.090
<v Speaker 4>we really put a lot of effort into the manufacturing of them and the products</v>

2729
01:16:30.091 --> 01:16:30.631
<v Speaker 4>that we use,</v>

2730
01:16:30.631 --> 01:16:30.870
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2731
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:31.703
<v Speaker 4>the parts,</v>

2732
01:16:31.890 --> 01:16:32.723
<v Speaker 4>all of them.</v>

2733
01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:34.410
<v Speaker 4>Not that there's anything wrong with,</v>

2734
01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:34.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2735
01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:35.221
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2736
01:16:35.221 --> 01:16:37.380
<v Speaker 4>whatever we use no cheap parts.</v>

2737
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:39.210
<v Speaker 4>There was nothing made in China.</v>

2738
01:16:39.211 --> 01:16:40.980
<v Speaker 4>Not that there's anything wrong with made in China,</v>

2739
01:16:40.981 --> 01:16:44.180
<v Speaker 4>but we don't buy anything that's used in China for our stuff at all.</v>

2740
01:16:44.181 --> 01:16:47.610
<v Speaker 4>So I'll either made here or north in North America somewhere to,</v>

2741
01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:47.911
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

2742
01:16:47.911 --> 01:16:48.390
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2743
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:50.790
<v Speaker 4>we have a few European parts from German and Switzerland,</v>

2744
01:16:50.791 --> 01:16:52.590
<v Speaker 4>but the rest of it's all a,</v>

2745
01:16:52.890 --> 01:16:55.530
<v Speaker 4>it made here in America because of the quality.</v>

2746
01:16:55.670 --> 01:16:58.080
<v Speaker 4>We insist upon getting the best pieces.</v>

2747
01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:59.640
<v Speaker 4>And that was the guy you spoke about,</v>

2748
01:16:59.641 --> 01:17:00.001
<v Speaker 4>Lilly,</v>

2749
01:17:00.001 --> 01:17:02.130
<v Speaker 4>John Lilly didn't invented these chambers in the beginning.</v>

2750
01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:03.180
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

2751
01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:05.800
<v Speaker 4>his docker 10 was a doctorate in or whatever it is.</v>

2752
01:17:05.801 --> 01:17:05.971
<v Speaker 4>His,</v>

2753
01:17:05.971 --> 01:17:06.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2754
01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:07.493
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

2755
01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:12.500
<v Speaker 4>his perspective was that it was always better to buy or to you implement or use</v>

2756
01:17:13.101 --> 01:17:13.340
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2757
01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:14.840
<v Speaker 4>the better quality,</v>

2758
01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:16.163
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2759
01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:21.280
<v Speaker 4>piece of equipment then to create this what it is that it is and that is,</v>

2760
01:17:21.710 --> 01:17:22.011
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2761
01:17:22.011 --> 01:17:25.640
<v Speaker 4>so I agree with that so much that the better it is,</v>

2762
01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:27.200
<v Speaker 4>the better it is just saying,</v>

2763
01:17:27.230 --> 01:17:27.381
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2764
01:17:27.381 --> 01:17:28.880
<v Speaker 4>you can get away with it all.</v>

2765
01:17:28.881 --> 01:17:29.750
<v Speaker 4>We could do it this way.</v>

2766
01:17:29.751 --> 01:17:30.740
<v Speaker 4>It's cheaper.</v>

2767
01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:31.430
<v Speaker 4>Or,</v>

2768
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:32.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2769
01:17:32.271 --> 01:17:33.050
<v Speaker 4>a sec,</v>

2770
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:33.411
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2771
01:17:33.411 --> 01:17:34.244
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2772
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.971
<v Speaker 4>I find it,</v>

2773
01:17:34.971 --> 01:17:37.490
<v Speaker 4>if you could figure out the best way to do things,</v>

2774
01:17:37.491 --> 01:17:38.330
<v Speaker 4>that's the way to do it.</v>

2775
01:17:38.331 --> 01:17:39.164
<v Speaker 4>First Class,</v>

2776
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:40.910
<v Speaker 4>you've got first class or no class.</v>

2777
01:17:40.911 --> 01:17:41.480
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2778
01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:42.440
<v Speaker 4>These people come up with this thing.</v>

2779
01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:43.071
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2780
01:17:43.071 --> 01:17:43.570
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2781
01:17:43.570 --> 01:17:45.440
<v Speaker 4>this is what I used to mix sound right on the,</v>

2782
01:17:45.441 --> 01:17:47.450
<v Speaker 4>I do monitors mixed us from the stage.</v>

2783
01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:49.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't think Susan was saying,</v>

2784
01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:49.520
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

2785
01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:49.790

2791
01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:51.850

2792
01:17:51.850 --> 01:17:52.081
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2793
01:17:52.081 --> 01:17:52.611
<v Speaker 4>I'm not in that.</v>

2794
01:17:52.611 --> 01:17:53.660
<v Speaker 4>We don't do pretty good.</v>

2795
01:17:53.661 --> 01:17:54.710
<v Speaker 4>We don't do okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2802
01:18:02.731 --> 01:18:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Well that's like many aspects of life.</v>

2803
01:18:04.261 --> 01:18:07.080
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that are happily halfass and things.</v>

2804
01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:07.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2805
01:18:07.411 --> 01:18:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Just happily getting to the end of the day.</v>

2806
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Slunk over,</v>

2807

<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2810
01:18:15.010 --> 01:18:18.060
<v Speaker 1>and then there's other folks that like you who were fucking crazy,</v>

01:18:18.210 --> 01:18:18.451
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

2812
01:18:18.451 --> 01:18:19.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2813
01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:24.080
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way to invest in incredible amount of time to try to renovate and</v>

2814
01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:26.670
<v Speaker 1>reinvigorate this,</v>

2815
01:18:26.671 --> 01:18:27.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2816
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.890
<v Speaker 1>this business that had kind of been forgotten about.</v>

2817
01:18:28.891 --> 01:18:29.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2818
01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:33.270
<v Speaker 1>when you came along there was like somebody tanks and then there was a couple</v>

2819
01:18:33.271 --> 01:18:35.190
<v Speaker 1>other ones that you could kind of find online,</v>

2820
01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:35.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2821
01:18:35.731 --> 01:18:37.080
<v Speaker 1>that were made in Europe,</v>

2822
01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:38.023
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

2823
01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:38.850
<v Speaker 1>it hadn't,</v>

2824
01:18:38.850 --> 01:18:40.740
<v Speaker 1>it had a little bit more popularity in Europe</v>

2825
01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:42.880
<v Speaker 4>Pathfinder.</v>

2826
01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:43.991
<v Speaker 4>And then they had,</v>

2827
01:18:43.991 --> 01:18:44.824
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2828

<v Speaker 4>let's see,</v>

2829
01:18:45.690 --> 01:18:48.310
<v Speaker 4>oasis has been around since from the beginning.</v>

2830
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Why was it more popular in Europe than it wasn't American?</v>

2831
01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:51.540
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2832
01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:52.373

<v Speaker 4>any idea is,</v>

2834
01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:54.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2835
01:18:54.031 --> 01:18:54.630
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>

2836
01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:54.991
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2837
01:18:54.991 --> 01:18:55.950
<v Speaker 4>I really don't know,</v>

2838
01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:56.620
<v Speaker 4>to be honest with</v>

2839
01:18:56.620 --> 01:18:56.791
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2840
01:18:56.791 --> 01:18:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Still wasn't popular.</v>

2841
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:59.730
<v Speaker 1>It's still way more popular.</v>

2842
01:18:59.731 --> 01:19:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Even now overseas,</v>

2843
01:19:01.021 --> 01:19:02.500
<v Speaker 1>like I get letters all the time from,</v>

2844

<v Speaker 1>there's a new place that opened up in London and I believe this one in</v>

2845
01:19:05.041 --> 01:19:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Manchester that opened up and I get messages from those guys all the time.</v>

2846
01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:14.100
<v Speaker 1>So I know it's there are opening up new ones so it's not like it's already there</v>

2847
01:19:14.101 --> 01:19:14.934
<v Speaker 1>and established.</v>

2848
01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:16.580
<v Speaker 4>Well that's what we were talking about earlier.</v>

2849
01:19:16.581 --> 01:19:18.080
<v Speaker 4>A little bit on the way over here.</v>

2850
01:19:18.081 --> 01:19:20.360
<v Speaker 4>We got a chance to have a little brief discussion about the uh,</v>

2851
01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:21.081
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2852
01:19:21.081 --> 01:19:21.281
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2853
01:19:21.281 --> 01:19:22.150
<v Speaker 4>the future in the,</v>

2854
01:19:22.151 --> 01:19:24.530
<v Speaker 4>in the industry there I got a chance to show you,</v>

2855
01:19:24.531 --> 01:19:25.364
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2856
01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:26.030
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2857
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:27.200
<v Speaker 4>some of these uh,</v>

2858
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:29.830
<v Speaker 4>rules and regulations now that had been uh,</v>

2859
01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:30.361
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2860
01:19:30.361 --> 01:19:30.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2861
01:19:30.490 --> 01:19:32.270
<v Speaker 4>pinned up by you know,</v>

2862
01:19:32.271 --> 01:19:32.930
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>

2863
01:19:32.930 --> 01:19:35.030
<v Speaker 4>various health agencies,</v>

2864
01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.193
<v Speaker 4>NSF,</v>

2865
01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:37.870
<v Speaker 4>national sanitization foundation.</v>

2866
01:19:38.250 --> 01:19:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Well just explain that to people.</v>

2867
01:19:39.630 --> 01:19:39.991
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2868
01:19:39.991 --> 01:19:43.470
<v Speaker 1>there's home tags and then there's commercial tanks and you know,</v>

2869
01:19:43.471 --> 01:19:44.490
<v Speaker 1>people always,</v>

2870
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:45.271
<v Speaker 1>when I tell them,</v>

2871
01:19:45.271 --> 01:19:45.481
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2872
01:19:45.481 --> 01:19:47.100
<v Speaker 1>you should go to the float lab and getting a tank,</v>

2873
01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:47.701
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

2874
01:19:47.701 --> 01:19:48.061
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

2875
01:19:48.061 --> 01:19:49.530
<v Speaker 1>somebody's been in that tank before me.</v>

2876
01:19:49.710 --> 01:19:54.710
<v Speaker 1>That is a very good question and that is a question that up until now has it</v>

2877
01:19:55.921 --> 01:19:59.460
<v Speaker 1>been like completely thoroughly examine and your tanks.</v>

2878
01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Like when people come over my house,</v>

2879
01:20:00.601 --> 01:20:01.760
<v Speaker 1>one of the things they always look at it,</v>

2880
01:20:01.761 --> 01:20:04.140
<v Speaker 1>it's like the back of the tank while the equipment is set up.</v>

2881
01:20:04.141 --> 01:20:04.471
<v Speaker 1>And they'd go,</v>

2882
01:20:04.471 --> 01:20:05.790
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is all that?</v>

2883
01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:06.451
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

2884
01:20:06.451 --> 01:20:06.571
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2885
01:20:06.571 --> 01:20:07.950
<v Speaker 1>that one ozone,</v>

2886
01:20:07.951 --> 01:20:09.120
<v Speaker 1>these ones are filters.</v>

2887
01:20:09.121 --> 01:20:10.260
<v Speaker 1>And like is that overkill?</v>

2888
01:20:10.261 --> 01:20:10.531
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2889
01:20:10.531 --> 01:20:11.700
<v Speaker 1>I dunno what overkill is.</v>

2890
01:20:11.701 --> 01:20:12.271
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2891
01:20:12.271 --> 01:20:13.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

2892
01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:13.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

2893
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2894
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:15.570
<v Speaker 1>I all I know is a tank is awesome.</v>

2895
01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Crash makes the best tanks.</v>

2896
01:20:17.130 --> 01:20:18.720
<v Speaker 1>If he says it should be like this,</v>

2897
01:20:18.721 --> 01:20:19.860
<v Speaker 1>then it probably should be like this.</v>

2898
01:20:20.250 --> 01:20:22.690
<v Speaker 1>But when you talk to people that have other tanks that go to dot,</v>

2899
01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:24.660
<v Speaker 1>got like a little fucking spa pump,</v>

2900
01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:27.870
<v Speaker 1>I get a little spa pump that's about the size of a basketball and that's it.</v>

2901
01:20:28.230 --> 01:20:29.480
<v Speaker 1>And you got like a,</v>

2902
01:20:29.481 --> 01:20:34.481
<v Speaker 1>a JPL fucking set up back there with digital this and fucking porno.</v>

2903
01:20:35.170 --> 01:20:36.180
<v Speaker 1>More complicated.</v>

2904
01:20:36.181 --> 01:20:40.500
<v Speaker 1>As we get more and more involved with the authorities like UL and UL is what</v>

2905
01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:41.760
<v Speaker 1>underwriters laboratory,</v>

2906
01:20:41.761 --> 01:20:45.090
<v Speaker 1>they do all electrical certification for any kind of stuff like this.</v>

2907
01:20:45.450 --> 01:20:50.160
<v Speaker 1>These people that what had happened to mine where mine shorted out is fairly</v>

2908
01:20:50.161 --> 01:20:50.670
<v Speaker 1>common.</v>

2909
01:20:50.670 --> 01:20:54.030
<v Speaker 1>I showed you the email too about this and these electrical issues.</v>

2910
01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:54.870
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2911
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:57.180
<v Speaker 1>you got an email without naming anybody.</v>

2912
01:20:57.181 --> 01:20:58.800
<v Speaker 1>There was another manufacturer that,</v>

2913
01:20:58.801 --> 01:20:59.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2914
01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:02.850
<v Speaker 1>makes pods and his pod melted into oblivion.</v>

2915
01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:03.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2916
01:21:03.031 --> 01:21:06.450
<v Speaker 1>He made some sort of a thing and it just,</v>

2917
01:21:06.451 --> 01:21:07.860
<v Speaker 1>it all fucking fell apart.</v>

2918
01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:09.420
<v Speaker 1>There's awesome ones out there,</v>

2919
01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:11.700
<v Speaker 1>but we don't want to slink out or anything.</v>

2920
01:21:11.710 --> 01:21:12.780
<v Speaker 1>But for home use,</v>

2921
01:21:12.781 --> 01:21:13.770
<v Speaker 1>it's a different thing.</v>

2922
01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:17.430
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of these people are taking these home use ones and they're using them</v>

2923
01:21:17.431 --> 01:21:20.790
<v Speaker 1>for these commercial places and all these different people going in there.</v>

2924
01:21:20.791 --> 01:21:23.460
<v Speaker 1>And who knows if they're jerking off some of them probably,</v>

2925
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:24.383
<v Speaker 1>let's be honest.</v>

2926
01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2927
01:21:25.050 --> 01:21:26.550
<v Speaker 1>and where's that going?</v>

2928
01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:26.971
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2929
01:21:26.971 --> 01:21:29.370
<v Speaker 1>it's like going through your little spa filter.</v>

2930
01:21:29.371 --> 01:21:30.240
<v Speaker 1>That's not enough for me,</v>

2931
01:21:30.241 --> 01:21:30.600
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2932
01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:30.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2933
01:21:30.781 --> 01:21:31.614
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2934
01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2935
01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:33.150
<v Speaker 1>This is a video.</v>

2936
01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:34.860
<v Speaker 1>This is the video that Brian made.</v>

2937
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Areas where the water is,</v>

2938
01:21:37.291 --> 01:21:37.830
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

2939
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:38.111
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2940
01:21:38.111 --> 01:21:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Well this is all the shit that I've already said before earlier in this podcast.</v>

2941
01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:43.410
<v Speaker 1>So differently.</v>

2942
01:21:43.770 --> 01:21:45.210
<v Speaker 1>That was before I got my nose fixed.</v>

2943
01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.353
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2944
01:21:49.390 --> 01:21:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Underwater faces floating above the water.</v>

2945
01:21:51.870 --> 01:21:53.660
<v Speaker 1>But your ears are a subject.</v>

2946
01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:55.050
<v Speaker 1>We already said all this stuff,</v>

2947
01:21:55.380 --> 01:21:57.630
<v Speaker 1>but you can watch the video and you can kind of see it.</v>

2948
01:21:57.631 --> 01:21:57.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2949
01:21:57.781 --> 01:22:00.300
<v Speaker 1>My nose when I got my nose opened up,</v>

2950
01:22:00.510 --> 01:22:01.590
<v Speaker 1>changed my voice a little bit.</v>

2951
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:02.370
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2952
01:22:02.370 --> 01:22:03.930
<v Speaker 1>I can breathe out of my nose now.</v>

2953
01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Yay for almost all my life,</v>

2954
01:22:08.191 --> 01:22:08.490
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

2955
01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:09.240
<v Speaker 1>I had no nose.</v>

2956
01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:10.770
<v Speaker 1>My nose was a useless piece of shit.</v>

2957
01:22:11.070 --> 01:22:14.100
<v Speaker 1>It was just bad Cartlidge scar tissue in there.</v>

2958
01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:14.993
<v Speaker 1>But now,</v>

2959
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:17.860
<v Speaker 1>now I can smell when Brian's been smoking cigarettes today.</v>

2960
01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:19.433
<v Speaker 1>Busted.</v>

2961
01:22:19.710 --> 01:22:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Smell him a mile away.</v>

2962
01:22:21.001 --> 01:22:21.810
<v Speaker 1>This motherfucker.</v>

2963
01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2964
01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:22.800
<v Speaker 1>so that is,</v>

2965
01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:23.850
<v Speaker 1>that's the tank from,</v>

2966
01:22:23.851 --> 01:22:25.140
<v Speaker 1>what is a video from Brian?</v>

2967
01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:27.030
<v Speaker 4>This is a wow,</v>

2968
01:22:27.031 --> 01:22:27.651
<v Speaker 4>it's a good question.</v>

2969
01:22:27.651 --> 01:22:29.840
<v Speaker 4>I would say in a while cause thousand nine maybe.</v>

2970
01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:32.330
<v Speaker 4>Is it really the reason I think it's been more than that.</v>

2971
01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:32.930
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>

2972
01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:33.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I said,</v>

2973
01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:37.220
<v Speaker 4>here's this was tank number one facing.</v>

2974
01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:37.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2975
01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:38.510
<v Speaker 4>This is another,</v>

2976
01:22:38.511 --> 01:22:39.344
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2977
01:22:39.370 --> 01:22:41.180
<v Speaker 4>see where like 12 steps from that.</v>

2978
01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:42.923
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2979
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:43.800
<v Speaker 4>Joe is a,</v>

2980
01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:48.320
<v Speaker 4>we've wanted to get over and switch it out for him because he's a deserves to</v>

2981
01:22:48.321 --> 01:22:50.440
<v Speaker 4>have a more updated version.</v>

2982
01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:53.990
<v Speaker 4>He was okay with everything but well craft against you.</v>

2983
01:22:53.991 --> 01:22:54.411
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2984
01:22:54.411 --> 01:22:55.011
<v Speaker 4>Is that good?</v>

2985
01:22:55.011 --> 01:22:55.221
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2986
01:22:55.221 --> 01:22:55.881
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to hear,</v>

2987
01:22:55.881 --> 01:22:56.690
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2988
01:22:56.690 --> 01:22:58.130
<v Speaker 4>well that's not okay with me.</v>

2990
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:01.010
<v Speaker 4>Still not okay with me.</v>

3006
01:23:19.881 --> 01:23:22.970
<v Speaker 1>The one I have now is this weird fucking meat locker.</v>

3007
01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:24.073
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

3008

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3038
01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:51.180
<v Speaker 4>somebody,</v>

3039
01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:53.900
<v Speaker 4>some of these things sit in their house and they don't use it.</v>

3040
01:23:53.901 --> 01:23:54.061
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3041
01:23:54.061 --> 01:23:54.650
<v Speaker 4>what is it</v>

3042
01:23:54.650 --> 01:23:55.361
<v Speaker 1>people need?</v>

3043
01:23:55.361 --> 01:23:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3044
01:23:55.950 --> 01:23:56.340
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3045
01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:56.981
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

3046
01:23:56.981 --> 01:24:01.180
<v Speaker 1>But people need something to like jolt them out of their normal everyday</v>

3047
01:24:01.181 --> 01:24:01.631
<v Speaker 1>routine.</v>

3048
01:24:01.631 --> 01:24:04.960
<v Speaker 1>They need something to jolt them to get an old Dell try one day.</v>

3049
01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Like today I'm going to go to the gym and they work out in the next day.</v>

3050
01:24:07.331 --> 01:24:07.991
<v Speaker 1>It's like fat,</v>

3051
01:24:07.991 --> 01:24:08.710
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

3052
01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:09.220
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

3053
01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:10.060
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>

3054
01:24:10.061 --> 01:24:11.020
<v Speaker 1>it didn't catch fire,</v>

3055
01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:12.040
<v Speaker 1>but they want to improve,</v>

3056
01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:13.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3057
01:24:13.031 --> 01:24:14.110
<v Speaker 4>and that's the first step.</v>

3058
01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:14.861
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

3059
01:24:14.861 --> 01:24:15.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3060
01:24:15.170 --> 01:24:15.310
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3061
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:16.990
<v Speaker 4>the actually doing things,</v>

3062
01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:18.430
<v Speaker 4>people have a lot of folks,</v>

3063
01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:20.110
<v Speaker 4>they discuss a lot of stuff.</v>

3064
01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:21.820
<v Speaker 4>They read about other people,</v>

3065
01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:22.901
<v Speaker 4>all these things.</v>

3066
01:24:22.901 --> 01:24:23.681
<v Speaker 4>And instead of like,</v>

3067
01:24:23.681 --> 01:24:24.940
<v Speaker 4>actually I sit down and say,</v>

3068
01:24:25.210 --> 01:24:25.451
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3069
01:24:25.451 --> 01:24:29.770
<v Speaker 4>to what can I actually do today to get to make me do something that is of a</v>

3070
01:24:29.771 --> 01:24:30.604
<v Speaker 4>value,</v>

3071
01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:31.091
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3072
01:24:31.091 --> 01:24:31.924
<v Speaker 4>rather than,</v>

3073
01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:32.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3074
01:24:32.161 --> 01:24:34.470
<v Speaker 4>these are the criticizing of other people is a really uh,</v>

3075
01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:35.333
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3076
01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:37.990
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't really help so much,</v>

3077
01:24:37.991 --> 01:24:38.291
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3078
01:24:38.291 --> 01:24:39.580
<v Speaker 4>and well it's fun though.</v>

3079
01:24:39.790 --> 01:24:40.240
<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>

3080
01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:41.410
<v Speaker 4>I love to do it,</v>

3081
01:24:41.411 --> 01:24:41.651
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3082
01:24:41.651 --> 01:24:44.960
<v Speaker 4>as a criticizing of other people's oftentimes a good sense of a,</v>

3083
01:24:44.961 --> 01:24:48.490
<v Speaker 4>a source of the entertainments and output to all right man.</v>

3084
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:49.000
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

3085
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:49.833
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3086
01:24:49.930 --> 01:24:54.100
<v Speaker 1>you have to be careful of criticizing too much or getting only into the vein of</v>

3087
01:24:54.101 --> 01:24:54.581
<v Speaker 1>criticism.</v>

3088
01:24:54.581 --> 01:24:59.581
<v Speaker 1>Like you're consistently constantly like people that are smart can oftentimes</v>

3089
01:25:00.131 --> 01:25:02.050
<v Speaker 1>make poor choices or dumb choices.</v>

3090
01:25:02.290 --> 01:25:03.070
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the,</v>

3091
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:07.480
<v Speaker 1>the dumb choices that a lot of smart people make is to like consistently and</v>

3092
01:25:07.481 --> 01:25:11.170
<v Speaker 1>constantly look for the negative and things consistently and constantly.</v>

3093
01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:12.670
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things you can focus on.</v>

3094
01:25:12.671 --> 01:25:14.470
<v Speaker 1>The negatives of things are always going to exist.</v>

3095
01:25:14.471 --> 01:25:15.160
<v Speaker 1>You're not stupid,</v>

3096
01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:15.970
<v Speaker 1>you see them,</v>

3097
01:25:15.970 --> 01:25:20.970
<v Speaker 1>but to constantly and consistently like only rally against dumb things in pop</v>

3098
01:25:21.251 --> 01:25:22.210
<v Speaker 1>culture over and over again.</v>

3099
01:25:22.211 --> 01:25:24.370
<v Speaker 1>At a certain point in time I have to go listen what,</v>

3100
01:25:24.371 --> 01:25:25.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3101
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.660
<v Speaker 1>we see it,</v>

3102
01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:26.350
<v Speaker 1>we see it too.</v>

3103
01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:26.841
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you,</v>

3104
01:25:26.841 --> 01:25:28.270
<v Speaker 1>you're just angry about it.</v>

3105
01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Like that doesn't,</v>

3106
01:25:29.050 --> 01:25:29.980
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't help anybody.</v>

3107
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Like what is either is either be funny or shut the fuck up because we see it's</v>

3108
01:25:34.301 --> 01:25:35.740
<v Speaker 1>dumped too and it's not,</v>

3109
01:25:35.741 --> 01:25:36.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3110
01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:41.280
<v Speaker 1>the funny part is best if someone instead of Joe sort of added to the good part</v>

3111
01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:42.131
<v Speaker 1>of our culture,</v>

3112
01:25:42.131 --> 01:25:42.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3113
01:25:42.371 --> 01:25:42.790
<v Speaker 1>added,</v>

3114
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:43.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3115
01:25:43.001 --> 01:25:44.830
<v Speaker 1>may come up with something that's entertaining,</v>

3116
01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:47.470
<v Speaker 1>come up with something that taps into what,</v>

3117
01:25:47.471 --> 01:25:47.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3118
01:25:47.770 --> 01:25:48.401
<v Speaker 1>people would,</v>

3119
01:25:48.401 --> 01:25:48.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3120
01:25:48.970 --> 01:25:50.160
<v Speaker 1>like to be getting here.</v>

3121
01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:51.580
<v Speaker 1>There's more than this one if that one's empty.</v>

3122
01:25:51.660 --> 01:25:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

3123
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:52.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3124
01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:53.230
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

3125
01:25:53.230 --> 01:25:54.063
<v Speaker 1>Either way.</v>

3126
01:25:55.110 --> 01:25:55.943
<v Speaker 1>Thank you my friend.</v>

3127
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.740
<v Speaker 1>You're welcome.</v>

3128
01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:00.770
<v Speaker 1>I just think one of the things is the tank provides is a,</v>

3129
01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:04.610
<v Speaker 1>this sort of introspective moment that I think a lot of folks are missing.</v>

3130
01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:05.361
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3131
01:26:05.361 --> 01:26:08.180
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes people get caught in patterns and you can get caught up in a</v>

3132
01:26:08.181 --> 01:26:09.380
<v Speaker 1>pattern of negativity.</v>

3133
01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:11.480
<v Speaker 1>You can get caught up in a pattern of depression.</v>

3134
01:26:11.481 --> 01:26:13.760
<v Speaker 1>You can get caught up in a pattern of regret.</v>

3135
01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:16.520
<v Speaker 1>You can get caught up in a pattern of friendships,</v>

3136
01:26:16.521 --> 01:26:16.741
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

3137
01:26:16.741 --> 01:26:17.541
<v Speaker 1>of kindness.</v>

3138
01:26:17.541 --> 01:26:19.880
<v Speaker 1>You can get caught up in a pattern of affection.</v>

3139
01:26:19.881 --> 01:26:20.240
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

3140
01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:22.010
<v Speaker 1>you can get into good patterns too.</v>

3141
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:25.100
<v Speaker 1>You just have to reject the bad ones when they come along.</v>

3142
01:26:25.101 --> 01:26:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Don't indulge.</v>

3143
01:26:26.530 --> 01:26:27.490
<v Speaker 4>It'd be ready for those.</v>

3144
01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:31.270
<v Speaker 4>You can just make sure that that's where the chamber self aware going there and</v>

3145
01:26:31.271 --> 01:26:32.290
<v Speaker 4>you got to look at yourself.</v>

3146
01:26:32.291 --> 01:26:32.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3147
01:26:32.830 --> 01:26:34.090
<v Speaker 4>when I first started doing it,</v>

3148
01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:35.260
<v Speaker 4>I got an eye.</v>

3149
01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:36.700
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know what it was or whatever,</v>

3150
01:26:36.701 --> 01:26:39.220
<v Speaker 4>but I would be in for an hour every day.</v>

3151
01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:43.420
<v Speaker 4>I would go in there and it's beat myself up because I was a damaged goods,</v>

3152
01:26:43.421 --> 01:26:44.254
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3153
01:26:44.890 --> 01:26:45.280
<v Speaker 4>crash.</v>

3154
01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:45.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm not buying it.</v>

3155
01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:46.743
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3156
01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:48.560
<v Speaker 4>Once upon a time on a sir.</v>

3157
01:26:48.670 --> 01:26:48.941
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3158
01:26:48.941 --> 01:26:49.210
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3159
01:26:49.210 --> 01:26:49.850
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3160
01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:50.800
<v Speaker 4>I would anyway.</v>

3161
01:26:51.970 --> 01:26:55.330
<v Speaker 4>But getting in there every day for me for one hour in the beginning and see,</v>

3162
01:26:55.331 --> 01:26:56.260
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know what it was,</v>

3163
01:26:56.261 --> 01:26:57.580
<v Speaker 4>but I knew that that's what it was.</v>

3164
01:26:57.581 --> 01:26:57.820
<v Speaker 4>I put,</v>

3165
01:26:57.820 --> 01:27:00.520
<v Speaker 4>so I'm in there and I beat myself up.</v>

3166
01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:01.271
<v Speaker 4>I'd come out of there,</v>

3167
01:27:01.271 --> 01:27:03.640
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like beaten up and I'd get out and go,</v>

3168
01:27:03.641 --> 01:27:04.474
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

3169
01:27:04.630 --> 01:27:05.650
<v Speaker 4>I feel pretty good.</v>

3170
01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:08.240
<v Speaker 4>I could sit down and they used to have a pa out there at that.</v>

3171
01:27:08.290 --> 01:27:08.981
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't a ranch.</v>

3172
01:27:08.981 --> 01:27:11.100
<v Speaker 4>I had a renter then in a big screen and everything.</v>

3173
01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:14.680
<v Speaker 4>But I would come in there and I always need people around me and stimulation and</v>

3174
01:27:14.681 --> 01:27:14.951
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

3175
01:27:14.951 --> 01:27:16.150
<v Speaker 4>But I get out of that chamber.</v>

3176
01:27:16.510 --> 01:27:21.510
<v Speaker 4>I come in to all by myself and sit down and not turn nothing on and just sit</v>

3177
01:27:21.701 --> 01:27:25.150
<v Speaker 4>there and feel actually relax without use of drugs.</v>

3178
01:27:25.151 --> 01:27:25.984
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3179
01:27:26.110 --> 01:27:27.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm reliant on,</v>

3180
01:27:27.300 --> 01:27:27.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3181
01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:28.121
<v Speaker 4>certain things.</v>

3182
01:27:28.121 --> 01:27:28.954
<v Speaker 4>In the past too.</v>

3183
01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:30.130
<v Speaker 4>It made me feel different ways,</v>

3184
01:27:30.131 --> 01:27:30.401
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3185
01:27:30.401 --> 01:27:32.180
<v Speaker 4>but the chamber now it,</v>

3186
01:27:32.210 --> 01:27:33.190
<v Speaker 4>it was able to,</v>

3187
01:27:33.191 --> 01:27:33.431
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3188
01:27:33.431 --> 01:27:38.431
<v Speaker 4>affect the way I felt as a matter of factly without the use of any kind of,</v>

3189
01:27:39.611 --> 01:27:39.910
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3190
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:40.743
<v Speaker 4>additives.</v>

3191
01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:42.670
<v Speaker 4>And when I learned about that,</v>

3192
01:27:42.671 --> 01:27:44.080
<v Speaker 4>that that's quite a,</v>

3193
01:27:44.530 --> 01:27:45.700
<v Speaker 4>that's quite an impressive,</v>

3194
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:46.840
<v Speaker 4>that a game changer.</v>

3195
01:27:47.290 --> 01:27:47.790
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3196
01:27:47.790 --> 01:27:47.941
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3197
01:27:47.941 --> 01:27:51.610
<v Speaker 4>you now have a window into yourself,</v>

3198
01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:56.440
<v Speaker 4>you can now go in and look at you and see what that is and then say,</v>

3199
01:27:56.441 --> 01:27:57.880
<v Speaker 4>hey woo,</v>

3200
01:27:57.881 --> 01:27:59.290
<v Speaker 4>look at that with that is over.</v>

3201
01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:02.080
<v Speaker 4>Same thing because you're aware of what you are and who you are,</v>

3202
01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:04.210
<v Speaker 4>what did you did and where you've been and what not like that.</v>

3203
01:28:04.211 --> 01:28:06.400
<v Speaker 4>But you have to be willing to,</v>

3204
01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:07.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3205
01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:08.550
<v Speaker 4>admit to all that surrender,</v>

3206
01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:09.393
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

3207
01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:14.470
<v Speaker 4>And then you pick yourself up and start to use what it is that you're able to</v>

3208
01:28:14.471 --> 01:28:17.020
<v Speaker 4>figure out about what to do from here.</v>

3209
01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:17.943
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

3210
01:28:18.010 --> 01:28:20.380
<v Speaker 4>And stand by it and then compromise.</v>

3211
01:28:20.410 --> 01:28:23.770
<v Speaker 4>And the tank tells you that like give me the experience,</v>

3212
01:28:23.771 --> 01:28:28.771
<v Speaker 4>sort of introduces you to yourself and there you are in this box and you realize</v>

3213
01:28:29.531 --> 01:28:30.640
<v Speaker 4>there's two parts of me,</v>

3214
01:28:30.910 --> 01:28:35.200
<v Speaker 4>there's this thing inside of me that that apparently has better information.</v>

3215
01:28:35.470 --> 01:28:39.360
<v Speaker 4>And then there's this thing outside that wants to get high or it goes to go see</v>

3216
01:28:39.370 --> 01:28:40.810
<v Speaker 4>chicks or do whatever you're going to want to do.</v>

3217
01:28:40.811 --> 01:28:43.000
<v Speaker 4>He said go out and blah blah blah.</v>

3218
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.900
<v Speaker 4>You eat too much.</v>

3219
01:28:43.901 --> 01:28:44.950
<v Speaker 4>People do different things,</v>

3220
01:28:44.951 --> 01:28:45.231
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3221
01:28:45.231 --> 01:28:46.210
<v Speaker 4>and the gamble,</v>

3222
01:28:46.390 --> 01:28:47.223
<v Speaker 4>gambling,</v>

3223
01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:50.860
<v Speaker 4>this is all kinds of stuff and cigarettes and we get a hit from that,</v>

3224
01:28:50.861 --> 01:28:51.694
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3225
01:28:52.490 --> 01:28:52.940
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3226
01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:53.773
<v Speaker 4>you know and it,</v>

3227
01:28:53.890 --> 01:28:55.750
<v Speaker 4>but the effect that these things have,</v>

3228
01:28:55.870 --> 01:28:57.310
<v Speaker 4>see what they do is you also,</v>

3229
01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:01.610
<v Speaker 4>they will alter your perspective of yourself sometimes have these,</v>

3230
01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:02.220
<v Speaker 4>these studies,</v>

3231
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:03.810
<v Speaker 4>how people are drunk and they're all like,</v>

3232
01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:04.150
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

3233
01:29:04.150 --> 01:29:04.591
<v Speaker 4>la La,</v>

3234
01:29:04.591 --> 01:29:04.801
<v Speaker 4>la,</v>

3235
01:29:04.801 --> 01:29:05.011
<v Speaker 4>La,</v>

3236
01:29:05.011 --> 01:29:05.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3237
01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:06.241
<v Speaker 4>and they're really,</v>

3238
01:29:06.241 --> 01:29:06.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3239
01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:11.400
<v Speaker 4>it kind of gives them an impression that they're more happy to be around or</v>

3240
01:29:11.401 --> 01:29:12.234
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

3241
01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:14.820
<v Speaker 4>The drunker they get the stupid or they seem to be,</v>

3242
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:18.300
<v Speaker 4>but they don't seem to evaluate themselves from that perspective.</v>

3243
01:29:18.301 --> 01:29:20.010
<v Speaker 4>They think they're more fun or something.</v>

3244
01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:20.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3245
01:29:20.271 --> 01:29:23.600
<v Speaker 1>Self evaluation is one of the hardest things to do.</v>

3246
01:29:23.630 --> 01:29:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3247
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:25.810
<v Speaker 1>It's the one of the hardest things for a person to do to,</v>

3248
01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:28.010
<v Speaker 1>to step away from their,</v>

3249
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:32.930
<v Speaker 1>whatever inaccuracies they've been telling themselves to make themselves feel</v>

3250
01:29:32.931 --> 01:29:35.000
<v Speaker 1>better about their life or their situation.</v>

3251
01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:36.650
<v Speaker 1>And then to force yourself to go,</v>

3252
01:29:36.651 --> 01:29:37.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3253
01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:38.001
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

3254
01:29:38.001 --> 01:29:38.840
<v Speaker 1>this is not right.</v>

3255
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:39.990
<v Speaker 1>This is this,</v>

3256
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:40.940
<v Speaker 1>this society</v>

3257
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:43.070
<v Speaker 4>has an influence on you as well.</v>

3258
01:29:43.250 --> 01:29:44.480
<v Speaker 4>Cause you don't want to look too,</v>

3259
01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:45.613
<v Speaker 4>like you're saying,</v>

3260
01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:46.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3261
01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:47.930
<v Speaker 4>I can remember certainly want to get into this.</v>

3262
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:50.390
<v Speaker 4>They start talking about certain things and people go,</v>

3263
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.991
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3264
01:29:50.991 --> 01:29:51.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3265
01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:52.940
<v Speaker 4>I said I don't want to talk about that or anything like that.</v>

3266
01:29:53.150 --> 01:29:54.770
<v Speaker 4>So you got to have a,</v>

3267
01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:56.600
<v Speaker 4>it's good to work on yourself.</v>

3268
01:29:56.630 --> 01:29:56.800
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

3269
01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:58.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm big on this selfish Chisholm.</v>

3270
01:29:58.280 --> 01:29:59.113
<v Speaker 4>I think of it</v>

3271
01:29:59.150 --> 01:30:02.150
<v Speaker 1>saying though about people not wanting to talk about certain things.</v>

3272
01:30:02.151 --> 01:30:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of things?</v>

3273
01:30:03.410 --> 01:30:03.891
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3274
01:30:03.891 --> 01:30:05.390
<v Speaker 1>a conspiracy theories.</v>

3275
01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:05.661
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3276
01:30:05.661 --> 01:30:06.340
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

3277
01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:06.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3278
01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.960
<v Speaker 1>I kind of a negative thing because when I was,</v>

3279
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3280
01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:10.640
<v Speaker 1>in Vegas,</v>

3281
01:30:10.641 --> 01:30:13.780
<v Speaker 1>the same place and the guy loading is showing,</v>

3282
01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:14.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3283
01:30:14.090 --> 01:30:14.990
<v Speaker 1>And the truck driver goes,</v>

3284
01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:15.141
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3285
01:30:15.141 --> 01:30:16.100
<v Speaker 1>there's the Kim planes.</v>

3286
01:30:16.190 --> 01:30:16.401
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3287
01:30:16.401 --> 01:30:17.234
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3288
01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:17.481
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

3289
01:30:17.481 --> 01:30:17.590
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3290
01:30:17.590 --> 01:30:18.081
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

3291
01:30:18.081 --> 01:30:18.650
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

3292
01:30:18.650 --> 01:30:19.220
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

3293
01:30:19.220 --> 01:30:20.053
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe it.</v>

3294
01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:21.690
<v Speaker 1>There's airplanes spraying this magazine.</v>

3295
01:30:22.130 --> 01:30:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>

3296
01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:25.550
<v Speaker 1>So I was damaged goods from that.</v>

3297
01:30:25.551 --> 01:30:27.260
<v Speaker 1>That messed me up for years.</v>

3298
01:30:27.261 --> 01:30:30.110
<v Speaker 1>And he said he quit telling people about it because they're on the,</v>

3299
01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:31.010
<v Speaker 1>he's driving a truck and go,</v>

3300
01:30:31.011 --> 01:30:31.321
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

3301
01:30:31.321 --> 01:30:32.690
<v Speaker 1>I take another hit on the crack pipe.</v>

3302
01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

3303
01:30:33.770 --> 01:30:35.180
<v Speaker 1>there it is right in front of you.</v>

3304
01:30:35.630 --> 01:30:39.020
<v Speaker 1>He should stop telling people about it and you should just go on Google and find</v>

3305
01:30:39.021 --> 01:30:39.980
<v Speaker 1>out what it actually is.</v>

3306
01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:41.000
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing.</v>

3307
01:30:41.090 --> 01:30:42.740
<v Speaker 1>This is like 15 years ago.</v>

3308
01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3309
01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:45.320
<v Speaker 1>it's not chem trails seat.</v>

3310
01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:46.910
<v Speaker 1>This is where people are really confused.</v>

3311
01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:50.630
<v Speaker 1>It's just airplanes create artificial clouds and hazy environments.</v>

3312
01:30:50.930 --> 01:30:53.870
<v Speaker 1>If an airplane is going through the atmosphere and there's a certain amount of</v>

3313
01:30:53.871 --> 01:30:54.531
<v Speaker 1>condensation,</v>

3314
01:30:54.531 --> 01:30:55.880
<v Speaker 1>it creates an artificial cloud.</v>

3315
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:59.750
<v Speaker 1>It just does the jet engine that you mean you should look into this more than</v>

3316
01:30:59.751 --> 01:31:02.720
<v Speaker 1>anybody because you've talked to me about this before and I know that you</v>

3317
01:31:02.721 --> 01:31:05.030
<v Speaker 1>probably have these ideas in your head,</v>

3318
01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:05.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3319
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:07.700
<v Speaker 1>about the government spraying things in the sky.</v>

3320
01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Say I'm sure whoever it is,</v>

3321
01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:10.573
<v Speaker 1>airplanes.</v>

3322
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Someone may have done that at some point in time.</v>

3323
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Most likely has done that some point in time,</v>

3324
01:31:16.490 --> 01:31:17.540
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what you're saying.</v>

3325
01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:19.490
<v Speaker 1>What are you seeing those clouds that go across,</v>

3326
01:31:19.491 --> 01:31:20.480
<v Speaker 1>those are actual clouds,</v>

3327
01:31:20.690 --> 01:31:22.490
<v Speaker 1>clouds that be made by jet engine.</v>

3328
01:31:22.491 --> 01:31:24.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like this has all been proven.</v>

3329
01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:27.470
<v Speaker 1>This is all scientific that everyone agrees on it.</v>

3330
01:31:27.471 --> 01:31:27.861
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

3331
01:31:27.861 --> 01:31:31.370
<v Speaker 1>there's no controversy about this at all when it comes to people who understand</v>

3332
01:31:31.371 --> 01:31:35.600
<v Speaker 1>jet propellant engines or jet engines and airplanes and airplanes and an</v>

3333
01:31:35.601 --> 01:31:39.920
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere conditions like there's been articles about this since the 1980s I</v>

3334
01:31:39.921 --> 01:31:40.520
<v Speaker 1>mean this,</v>

3335
01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:45.200
<v Speaker 1>all it is is in in 2001 when September 11th happened,</v>

3336
01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:46.110
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

3337
01:31:46.110 --> 01:31:51.110
<v Speaker 1>an article that was on cnn.com like a couple of days afterwards that was talking</v>

3338
01:31:52.401 --> 01:31:56.930
<v Speaker 1>about the changes in the temperature because there weren't the artificial clouds</v>

3339
01:31:57.050 --> 01:32:00.940
<v Speaker 1>that were used to having overhead on a daily that are created when planes fly</v>

3340
01:32:00.941 --> 01:32:01.810
<v Speaker 1>through the atmosphere.</v>

3341
01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:05.140
<v Speaker 1>So it's not something that they were being like secretive about.</v>

3342
01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:07.600
<v Speaker 1>This is just an effect of airplanes.</v>

3343
01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:09.110
<v Speaker 1>The real camp trail,</v>

3344
01:32:09.111 --> 01:32:11.650
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the things that I said on my television show when we covered this.</v>

3345
01:32:12.090 --> 01:32:15.580
<v Speaker 1>They're burning jet fuel in the sky.</v>

3346
01:32:15.670 --> 01:32:16.840
<v Speaker 1>That's the real chem trail.</v>

3347
01:32:16.850 --> 01:32:17.220
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

3348
01:32:17.220 --> 01:32:20.530
<v Speaker 1>we're polluting the sky and we just love it because we can get across the</v>

3349
01:32:20.531 --> 01:32:24.500
<v Speaker 1>country in in five hours and that's where guys like Elon Musk and these</v>

3350
01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:25.271
<v Speaker 1>geniuses,</v>

3351
01:32:25.271 --> 01:32:27.820
<v Speaker 1>they want to create these incredible high speed trains.</v>

3352
01:32:27.821 --> 01:32:30.880
<v Speaker 1>That's what these guys are so amazing because if they can figure out how to do</v>

3353
01:32:30.881 --> 01:32:34.420
<v Speaker 1>that and use the same sort of technology that keeps Google cars safe,</v>

3354
01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:36.220
<v Speaker 1>and if everybody can work together and make these,</v>

3355
01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:38.410
<v Speaker 1>we might be able to change the environment.</v>

3356
01:32:38.411 --> 01:32:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Like the amount of jet fuel that we burn.</v>

3357
01:32:40.061 --> 01:32:43.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like thousands and thousands of flights every hour,</v>

3358
01:32:43.121 --> 01:32:44.200
<v Speaker 1>all across the country,</v>

3359
01:32:44.201 --> 01:32:45.700
<v Speaker 1>constantly going back and forth.</v>

3360
01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:49.290
<v Speaker 5>Rocket ships apparently take a lot of a propulsion to get out.</v>

3361
01:32:49.291 --> 01:32:51.480
<v Speaker 5>There's a credible amount of rocket ships.</v>

3362
01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:52.380
<v Speaker 5>I talked to him and they,</v>

3363
01:32:52.381 --> 01:32:52.950
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3364
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:53.221
<v Speaker 5>they say,</v>

3365
01:32:53.221 --> 01:32:53.520
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>

3366
01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:54.270
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3367
01:32:54.270 --> 01:32:54.511
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3368
01:32:54.511 --> 01:32:54.790
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3369
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:58.290
<v Speaker 5>the biggest thing is the pollution that's created when these things blast off</v>

3370
01:32:58.291 --> 01:32:59.124
<v Speaker 5>the amount of,</v>

3371
01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:00.013
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3372
01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:01.830
<v Speaker 5>whatever it goes into the horse fair.</v>

3373
01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:02.550
<v Speaker 5>But look,</v>

3374
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:03.540
<v Speaker 5>you see fire,</v>

3375
01:33:03.930 --> 01:33:04.763
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3376
01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:06.151
<v Speaker 5>Fire.</v>

3377
01:33:06.151 --> 01:33:08.700
<v Speaker 5>Unless something that's not good is on fire,</v>

3378
01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:09.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3379
01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:10.830
<v Speaker 5>fires coming out of a metal tube.</v>

3380
01:33:10.831 --> 01:33:11.940
<v Speaker 5>That's never good.</v>

3381
01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:12.751
<v Speaker 5>It's never,</v>

3382
01:33:12.751 --> 01:33:17.751
<v Speaker 5>what's good now is that people have that opportunity to investigate information.</v>

3383
01:33:18.270 --> 01:33:19.500
<v Speaker 5>That's why right now I think that,</v>

3384
01:33:19.530 --> 01:33:19.710
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3385
01:33:19.710 --> 01:33:20.130
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3386
01:33:20.130 --> 01:33:20.490
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3387
01:33:20.490 --> 01:33:23.790
<v Speaker 5>ignorance and a negligence or sort of the same thing.</v>

3388
01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:24.690
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

3389
01:33:24.690 --> 01:33:25.050
<v Speaker 5>people say,</v>

3390
01:33:25.050 --> 01:33:25.321
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3391
01:33:25.321 --> 01:33:28.110
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know what you didn't know because you didn't care enough to look into</v>

3392
01:33:28.111 --> 01:33:28.280
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3393
01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:29.113
<v Speaker 5>And that is true</v>

3394
01:33:29.290 --> 01:33:32.040
<v Speaker 1>times you get caught in a situation where you don't,</v>

3395
01:33:32.250 --> 01:33:32.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3396
01:33:32.641 --> 01:33:35.310
<v Speaker 1>you just still don't understand even after all the facts are uh,</v>

3397
01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:35.871
<v Speaker 1>well you,</v>

3398
01:33:35.871 --> 01:33:39.480
<v Speaker 1>you also have contrary opinions back and forth.</v>

3399
01:33:39.481 --> 01:33:41.040
<v Speaker 1>There's this legitimate are varied,</v>

3400
01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:43.470
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to like certain historical events.</v>

3401
01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of people that wanted to talk about,</v>

3402
01:33:45.421 --> 01:33:46.950
<v Speaker 1>like JFK is a good example.</v>

3403
01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:50.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of people that love talking about conspiracies and electric wrap that</v>

3404
01:33:50.161 --> 01:33:50.910
<v Speaker 1>went up tight.</v>

3405
01:33:50.910 --> 01:33:53.580
<v Speaker 1>And when you have these conversations with them and you look at the,</v>

3406
01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:55.650
<v Speaker 1>the contrary evidence on both sides,</v>

3407
01:33:55.651 --> 01:33:56.700
<v Speaker 1>pro and con,</v>

3408
01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:57.301
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3409
01:33:57.301 --> 01:33:57.541
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3410
01:33:57.541 --> 01:34:01.590
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of like massive amounts of confusion as to what the actual events</v>

3411
01:34:01.591 --> 01:34:02.424
<v Speaker 1>where.</v>

3412
01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.200
<v Speaker 5>But actually so many people wanted him,</v>

3413
01:34:04.201 --> 01:34:04.531
<v Speaker 5>dad,</v>

3414
01:34:04.531 --> 01:34:05.910
<v Speaker 5>that you can't even pit the pit.</v>

3415
01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:08.090
<v Speaker 5>You couldn't pin the tail on that donkey no matter what.</v>

3416
01:34:08.130 --> 01:34:08.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3417
01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:12.050
<v Speaker 5>there was multiple people that were upset with his actions.</v>

3418
01:34:12.051 --> 01:34:14.820
<v Speaker 5>Why would they be so lucky if it was just a lone nut?</v>

3419
01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:15.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3420
01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:16.470
<v Speaker 5>Would they be so lucky?</v>

3421
01:34:16.471 --> 01:34:18.030
<v Speaker 5>All those other people would be so happy.</v>

3422
01:34:18.031 --> 01:34:22.080
<v Speaker 5>So lucky because then the situation when you have perpetuated to this point now,</v>

3423
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:25.920
<v Speaker 5>if it was a lone nut back then in the system was actually fail safe from</v>

3424
01:34:25.921 --> 01:34:26.970
<v Speaker 5>situations like this.</v>

3425
01:34:27.150 --> 01:34:27.930
<v Speaker 5>I think what the,</v>

3426
01:34:27.930 --> 01:34:29.210
<v Speaker 5>the knife 1960s</v>

3427
01:34:29.210 --> 01:34:32.540
<v Speaker 1>and the death of Kennedy and you know the Kent state shootings and all that</v>

3428
01:34:32.541 --> 01:34:32.841
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

3429
01:34:32.841 --> 01:34:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean as tragic as it is for then and for those times,</v>

3430
01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:40.610
<v Speaker 1>I think that ultimately that kind of stuff is sort of a reminder and a lot of</v>

3431
01:34:40.611 --> 01:34:45.500
<v Speaker 1>ways to the people of today about how bad it can get if things get out of hand.</v>

3432
01:34:45.501 --> 01:34:48.590
<v Speaker 1>So when he stays start creeping up on these infringements,</v>

3433
01:34:48.591 --> 01:34:50.660
<v Speaker 1>on civil liberties like and people start rising up,</v>

3434
01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:54.410
<v Speaker 1>that's where you see things like us going to Syria gets shot down.</v>

3435
01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:56.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean you see the entire country,</v>

3436
01:34:56.571 --> 01:34:58.290
<v Speaker 1>both Republicans.</v>

3437
01:34:58.310 --> 01:35:01.670
<v Speaker 2>That was the first time that ever happened where they had made a plan to go in</v>

3438
01:35:01.671 --> 01:35:05.190
<v Speaker 2>and invade something and they did not do it because of the voice of the,</v>

3439
01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:06.190
<v Speaker 2>of the public,</v>

3440
01:35:06.191 --> 01:35:07.850
<v Speaker 2>the voice of the whole public.</v>

3441
01:35:07.851 --> 01:35:08.091
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3442
01:35:08.091 --> 01:35:11.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like how many Osca Publicans at this point in time retire.</v>

3443
01:35:11.500 --> 01:35:13.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you've got a blue suit and green suit.</v>

3444
01:35:13.761 --> 01:35:15.920
<v Speaker 2>A per bastard please.</v>

3445
01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:17.253
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

3446
01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:19.190
<v Speaker 2>Broke and we're not invading other countries.</v>

3447
01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:20.750
<v Speaker 2>What for what exactly?</v>

3448
01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:22.850
<v Speaker 2>We're not fixing the problems that we have at home.</v>

3449
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:24.290
<v Speaker 2>How about the fact there's no water?</v>

3450
01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:25.910
<v Speaker 2>How about the fact that Texas,</v>

3451
01:35:25.911 --> 01:35:27.950
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't rained in Texas and fucking years.</v>

3452
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:32.570
<v Speaker 2>You know California had like one rainfall like over the past like three or four</v>

3453
01:35:32.571 --> 01:35:33.260
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

3454
01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:34.093
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>

3455
01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:36.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's something to consider this something to think about.</v>

3456
01:35:36.711 --> 01:35:39.770
<v Speaker 2>Where the fuck we're going to get our water from desalination plants.</v>

3457
01:35:39.770 --> 01:35:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Maybe drain out that fucking goofy ocean tire.</v>

3458
01:35:42.210 --> 01:35:44.150
<v Speaker 2>Those fish sucking up all the good water.</v>

3459
01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:46.700
<v Speaker 2>What's happening with the fish all dead off over there too.</v>

3460
01:35:46.701 --> 01:35:47.240
<v Speaker 2>Everywhere.</v>

3461
01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:47.840
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>

3462
01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:49.590
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of times deal.</v>

3463
01:35:49.810 --> 01:35:50.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3464
01:35:50.430 --> 01:35:52.470
<v Speaker 2>a side effect of pollution to um,</v>

3465
01:35:52.730 --> 01:35:54.280
<v Speaker 2>or it could be a side effect of um,</v>

3466
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:55.850
<v Speaker 2>certain types of um,</v>

3467
01:35:56.210 --> 01:36:00.740
<v Speaker 2>like fish need a certain oxygen level and things can happen and they developed</v>

3468
01:36:00.741 --> 01:36:04.880
<v Speaker 2>dead zones and the water and there's no oxygen and all the fish just drowned.</v>

3469
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:07.670
<v Speaker 2>You've seen that on the zillions of them.</v>

3470
01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:09.050
<v Speaker 2>Hundreds of thousands here.</v>

3471
01:36:09.051 --> 01:36:10.880
<v Speaker 2>There we looked all over the world.</v>

3472
01:36:10.881 --> 01:36:12.920
<v Speaker 2>It seems like there's problems but it could be just,</v>

3473
01:36:13.490 --> 01:36:13.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3474
01:36:13.761 --> 01:36:14.091
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3475
01:36:14.091 --> 01:36:14.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3476
01:36:14.690 --> 01:36:19.690
<v Speaker 2>Well I think it's always happened but it happens certainly because of pollution</v>

3477
01:36:19.821 --> 01:36:20.181
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

3478
01:36:20.181 --> 01:36:22.300
<v Speaker 2>I believe pollution is bad.</v>

3479
01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:23.353
<v Speaker 2>Don't need to say,</v>

3480
01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:24.193
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>

3481
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:26.510
<v Speaker 2>it's okay cause it's only this amount or we can,</v>

3482
01:36:26.511 --> 01:36:26.990
<v Speaker 2>we got to,</v>

3483
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.823
<v Speaker 2>we got to camp.</v>

3484
01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:29.120
<v Speaker 2>We're containing it.</v>

3485
01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:31.170
<v Speaker 2>See this is the containment system.</v>

3486
01:36:31.171 --> 01:36:32.390
<v Speaker 2>See what do they do with that stuff?</v>

3487
01:36:32.391 --> 01:36:35.720
<v Speaker 2>Stuff in the ground from waiting for Godzilla coming at all about we're going to</v>

3488
01:36:35.721 --> 01:36:38.840
<v Speaker 2>collect this garbage and then planted in the ground over here.</v>

3489
01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:40.760
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what a little kid does.</v>

3490
01:36:40.780 --> 01:36:42.320
<v Speaker 2>You know when you're sweeping up you just,</v>

3491
01:36:42.321 --> 01:36:43.310
<v Speaker 2>it's a cartoon.</v>

3492
01:36:43.311 --> 01:36:45.820
<v Speaker 2>You pick up the carpet and you sweep it under the carpet pot,</v>

3493
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:47.040
<v Speaker 2>that carpet down number,</v>

3494
01:36:47.070 --> 01:36:47.720
<v Speaker 2>no shit.</v>

3495
01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:48.553
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3496
01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:48.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3497
01:36:48.891 --> 01:36:50.210
<v Speaker 2>it's a very childish way,</v>

3498
01:36:50.211 --> 01:36:54.860
<v Speaker 2>but it's also the people that were alive that implemented these systems.</v>

3499
01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:57.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're not alive anymore and they were,</v>

3500
01:36:57.530 --> 01:36:59.420
<v Speaker 2>when they were our age,</v>

3501
01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:01.190
<v Speaker 2>it was a completely different era.</v>

3502
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:04.280
<v Speaker 2>And then when you go back to look at their,</v>

3503
01:37:04.281 --> 01:37:04.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3504
01:37:04.461 --> 01:37:07.640
<v Speaker 2>the distance between us and the 1940s go back and look at the,</v>

3505
01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:12.700
<v Speaker 2>the 1940s and the distance between them and the same amount of time and you're</v>

3506
01:37:12.861 --> 01:37:14.300
<v Speaker 2>in the 18 hundreds.</v>

3507
01:37:14.570 --> 01:37:15.081
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3508
01:37:15.081 --> 01:37:18.530
<v Speaker 2>You're in the like the times where people were riding horses and they had a</v>

3509
01:37:18.531 --> 01:37:19.700
<v Speaker 2>paint their pictures.</v>

3510
01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:20.330
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

3511
01:37:20.330 --> 01:37:22.580
<v Speaker 2>that's how much distance has traveled.</v>

3512
01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:23.061
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3513
01:37:23.061 --> 01:37:23.810
<v Speaker 2>we really,</v>

3514
01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:28.070
<v Speaker 2>if you go back to 1940 and you look at those guys that are running the space</v>

3515
01:37:28.071 --> 01:37:30.480
<v Speaker 2>program or work with those guys who were involved in nuclear program,</v>

3516
01:37:30.710 --> 01:37:31.371
<v Speaker 2>how old were they?</v>

3517
01:37:31.371 --> 01:37:33.620
<v Speaker 2>They in their forties let's say they're in their forties.</v>

3518
01:37:33.830 --> 01:37:34.551
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that,</v>

3519
01:37:34.551 --> 01:37:34.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3520
01:37:34.650 --> 01:37:39.590
<v Speaker 2>they were born in the year 1900 and they were designing and working on all</v>

3521
01:37:39.591 --> 01:37:39.990
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

3522
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:44.570
<v Speaker 2>these crazy technological innovations from the time if you went back from them</v>

3523
01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:45.621
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

3524
01:37:45.621 --> 01:37:48.110
<v Speaker 2>as far as us looking at the 1940s,</v>

3525
01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:48.741
<v Speaker 2>you would be,</v>

3526
01:37:48.741 --> 01:37:48.921
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

3527
01:37:48.921 --> 01:37:49.341
<v Speaker 2>60,</v>

3528
01:37:49.341 --> 01:37:52.550
<v Speaker 2>74 years go to 74 years before that.</v>

3529
01:37:52.670 --> 01:37:56.580
<v Speaker 2>So 74 years before that is 18 fucking 26.</v>

3530
01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:57.413
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3531
01:37:57.560 --> 01:37:59.070
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

3532
01:37:59.250 --> 01:38:02.580
<v Speaker 5>They got a horse that stop and think about that.</v>

3533
01:38:02.590 --> 01:38:07.350
<v Speaker 5>They're 1940 like world to us.</v>

3534
01:38:07.351 --> 01:38:11.580
<v Speaker 5>Like when we consider the 1940 world is the early 18 hundreds to them.</v>

3535
01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:12.900
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

3536
01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:17.010
<v Speaker 5>It's essentially two decades or 2 cents on the,</v>

3537
01:38:17.011 --> 01:38:17.670
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3538
01:38:17.670 --> 01:38:18.270
<v Speaker 5>just the,</v>

3539
01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:19.010
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3540
01:38:19.010 --> 01:38:20.550
<v Speaker 5>the regular ratio.</v>

3541
01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:21.940
<v Speaker 5>When you start to consider that,</v>

3542
01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:22.291
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3543
01:38:22.291 --> 01:38:25.410
<v Speaker 5>the exponential type situation and other growth is</v>

3544
01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.040
<v Speaker 5>magnified as it goes on.</v>

3545
01:38:29.041 --> 01:38:31.290
<v Speaker 5>It continues to expand itself out.</v>

3546
01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:32.153
<v Speaker 5>No doubt.</v>

3547
01:38:32.190 --> 01:38:32.371
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3548
01:38:32.371 --> 01:38:37.371
<v Speaker 5>the growth and change between 1820 and 1940 was nothing compared to 19 four d to</v>

3549
01:38:37.951 --> 01:38:39.030
<v Speaker 5>2010.</v>

3550
01:38:39.390 --> 01:38:39.601
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3551
01:38:39.601 --> 01:38:40.650
<v Speaker 5>it's just this,</v>

3552
01:38:40.651 --> 01:38:41.820
<v Speaker 5>this is madness.</v>

3553
01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:42.960
<v Speaker 5>They didn't look ahead and you say,</v>

3554
01:38:42.961 --> 01:38:43.794
<v Speaker 5>oh boy.</v>

3555
01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:44.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3556
01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:45.690
<v Speaker 5>I know it's going to be really weird,</v>

3557
01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:50.730
<v Speaker 5>but it's just so strange that we're still running on the momentum of these</v>

3558
01:38:50.731 --> 01:38:53.620
<v Speaker 5>people's ideas as far as like storage of nuclear weapon,</v>

3559
01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:56.130
<v Speaker 5>storage of nuclear waste,</v>

3560
01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:56.973
<v Speaker 5>reset,</v>

3561
01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:57.751
<v Speaker 5>reset,</v>

3562
01:38:57.751 --> 01:38:59.700
<v Speaker 5>but fascinating though real kids in.</v>

3563
01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:00.880
<v Speaker 5>I agree wholeheartedly,</v>

3564
01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:06.080
<v Speaker 5>but also as a person who's not involved in creating nuclear technology and</v>

3565
01:39:06.501 --> 01:39:07.470
<v Speaker 5>they're not involved in any of that.</v>

3566
01:39:07.471 --> 01:39:10.110
<v Speaker 5>I find it fascinating just as an observer,</v>

3567
01:39:10.111 --> 01:39:11.100
<v Speaker 5>like looking at it all like,</v>

3568
01:39:11.101 --> 01:39:11.281
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

3569
01:39:11.281 --> 01:39:13.950
<v Speaker 5>this is really an interesting scenario because it was created by these</v>

3570
01:39:13.951 --> 01:39:18.951
<v Speaker 5>incredible geniuses that lived as long ago as 1820 something to them.</v>

3571
01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:20.041
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3572
01:39:20.041 --> 01:39:22.230
<v Speaker 5>that is really hard to believe.</v>

3573
01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:23.910
<v Speaker 5>It's really hard to believe.</v>

3574
01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:26.970
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to believe is that we're still operating on that same mechanism.</v>

3575
01:39:26.971 --> 01:39:27.511
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

3576
01:39:27.511 --> 01:39:29.150
<v Speaker 5>It's really hard to believe and it's,</v>

3577
01:39:29.170 --> 01:39:31.470
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to believe that we still have like garbage dumps.</v>

3578
01:39:31.471 --> 01:39:32.304
<v Speaker 5>We have like dumps,</v>

3579
01:39:32.890 --> 01:39:34.020
<v Speaker 5>right dumps.</v>

3580
01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:35.310
<v Speaker 5>We'd take all the garbage,</v>

3581
01:39:35.311 --> 01:39:37.240
<v Speaker 5>we throw it over there and then those dumps,</v>

3582
01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:39.960
<v Speaker 5>he started fucking disasters.</v>

3583
01:39:40.290 --> 01:39:41.640
<v Speaker 5>We went to a garbage dump.</v>

3584
01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:44.630
<v Speaker 5>Who Film something for the man showed a garbage dump wants it was well,</v>

3585
01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:45.480
<v Speaker 5>it was horrible.</v>

3586
01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:46.740
<v Speaker 5>Well this is a horrible fucking,</v>

3587
01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:50.580
<v Speaker 5>they dig a hole and dumped the throw all the shit there and stay,</v>

3588
01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:51.690
<v Speaker 5>just keep digging holes.</v>

3589
01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:53.130
<v Speaker 5>It fucking stinks dude.</v>

3590
01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:55.630
<v Speaker 5>They just cover it up with dirt and it's disgusting.</v>

3591
01:39:55.631 --> 01:39:56.060
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't,</v>

3592
01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:56.770
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3593
01:39:56.770 --> 01:39:58.040
<v Speaker 5>like the uh,</v>

3594
01:39:58.210 --> 01:39:58.670
<v Speaker 5>fume,</v>

3595
01:39:58.670 --> 01:39:59.700
<v Speaker 5>the methane or whatever,</v>

3596
01:39:59.701 --> 01:39:59.870
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3597
01:39:59.870 --> 01:40:01.500
<v Speaker 5>build up if you put it under the ground.</v>

3598
01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:02.791
<v Speaker 5>That's a good question.</v>

3599
01:40:02.791 --> 01:40:03.391
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3600
01:40:03.391 --> 01:40:03.810
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno.</v>

3601
01:40:03.810 --> 01:40:05.970
<v Speaker 5>I mean methane comes from biological weights.</v>

3602
01:40:05.971 --> 01:40:07.500
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't want us that this guy took a,</v>

3603
01:40:07.890 --> 01:40:09.960
<v Speaker 5>a rat or a mouse and he,</v>

3604
01:40:09.961 --> 01:40:10.620
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3605
01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:13.380
<v Speaker 5>made an art thing and he covered up the mouse with the,</v>

3606
01:40:13.381 --> 01:40:13.770
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3607
01:40:13.770 --> 01:40:14.490
<v Speaker 5>with the resin.</v>

3608
01:40:14.490 --> 01:40:15.090
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3609
01:40:15.090 --> 01:40:19.140
<v Speaker 5>And then the mouse was the running through the resident apparently until it,</v>

3610
01:40:19.410 --> 01:40:20.520
<v Speaker 5>it couldn't go into a further.</v>

3611
01:40:20.521 --> 01:40:21.240
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3612
01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:22.580
<v Speaker 5>He was like stuck in the resident,</v>

3613
01:40:22.581 --> 01:40:22.910
<v Speaker 5>the mouse.</v>

3614
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:23.940
<v Speaker 5>But that's an art piece.</v>

3615
01:40:23.941 --> 01:40:26.130
<v Speaker 5>That's an asshole is an asshole.</v>

3616
01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:27.660
<v Speaker 5>He glued a mouse.</v>

3617
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:29.880
<v Speaker 5>So it's inside of this thing now.</v>

3618
01:40:30.150 --> 01:40:32.990
<v Speaker 5>And then there were in that one day that was up on the,</v>

3619
01:40:32.991 --> 01:40:33.760
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3620
01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:34.950
<v Speaker 5>it exploded.</v>

3621
01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:40.560
<v Speaker 5>That was like made out of a plastic glass stuff and it exploded from the gap</v>

3622
01:40:41.090 --> 01:40:46.090
<v Speaker 5>that the mouse was offgassing from inside of it and the mouse created so much</v>

3623
01:40:46.981 --> 01:40:47.550
<v Speaker 5>gas.</v>

3624
01:40:47.550 --> 01:40:50.130
<v Speaker 5>It blew this whole thing up all over the place.</v>

3625
01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:50.993
<v Speaker 5>The guy told me,</v>

3626
01:40:51.210 --> 01:40:52.020
<v Speaker 5>whoa,</v>

3627
01:40:52.020 --> 01:40:53.440
<v Speaker 5>from the mouse being stuck in there,</v>

3628
01:40:53.441 --> 01:40:53.951
<v Speaker 5>the gas,</v>

3629
01:40:53.951 --> 01:40:54.150
<v Speaker 5>that</v>

3630
01:40:54.150 --> 01:40:57.000
<v Speaker 2>it was a offgassing as it died,</v>

3631
01:40:57.020 --> 01:40:57.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3632
01:40:57.490 --> 01:40:58.570
<v Speaker 2>you know the smell you smell.</v>

3633
01:40:58.940 --> 01:41:01.570
<v Speaker 2>He said the house smelled like that to w was you there for that?</v>

3634
01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:03.010
<v Speaker 2>I forget who was telling me no,</v>

3635
01:41:03.011 --> 01:41:06.370
<v Speaker 2>but somebody would come in and do the mop down on the house and everything,</v>

3636
01:41:06.371 --> 01:41:09.190
<v Speaker 2>but that seems like an unnecessary experiment.</v>

3637
01:41:09.220 --> 01:41:10.420
<v Speaker 2>You've got to remember that next time,</v>

3638
01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:11.840
<v Speaker 2>messing around with some mice.</v>

3639
01:41:11.841 --> 01:41:13.430
<v Speaker 2>Don't stick them in some plastic,</v>

3640
01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:15.310
<v Speaker 2>you know that they don't do well.</v>

3641
01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:16.090
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3642
01:41:16.090 --> 01:41:18.640
<v Speaker 2>Well there's plastics that they can make from plant material.</v>

3643
01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:21.190
<v Speaker 2>Something a lot of people aren't aware of.</v>

3644
01:41:21.191 --> 01:41:22.480
<v Speaker 2>You can make plastic from hemp.</v>

3645
01:41:23.190 --> 01:41:23.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3646
01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:24.281
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3647
01:41:24.281 --> 01:41:26.560
<v Speaker 2>It's a biodegradable plastic you can make from hemp.</v>

3648
01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:28.940
<v Speaker 2>That's for drew made a whole car ride.</v>

3649
01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Ford made a,</v>

3650
01:41:30.671 --> 01:41:31.510
<v Speaker 2>the first car.</v>

3651
01:41:31.810 --> 01:41:33.220
<v Speaker 2>The offenders who made at a Hampton,</v>

3652
01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:34.180
<v Speaker 2>you could hit it with a hammer.</v>

3653
01:41:34.450 --> 01:41:35.800
<v Speaker 2>Hemp as a weirdest plan ever.</v>

3654
01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:36.071
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3655
01:41:36.071 --> 01:41:36.371
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

3656
01:41:36.371 --> 01:41:38.890
<v Speaker 2>I know I sound like a hippie when I started talking great about marijuana.</v>

3657
01:41:38.891 --> 01:41:40.210
<v Speaker 2>But forget about marijuana.</v>

3658
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:43.210
<v Speaker 2>The psychoactive benefits of marijuana.</v>

3659
01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:44.560
<v Speaker 2>I've gone too in depth.</v>

3660
01:41:44.590 --> 01:41:45.280
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>

3661
01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:47.230
<v Speaker 2>there's a real benefit to people and I,</v>

3662
01:41:47.231 --> 01:41:47.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3663
01:41:47.501 --> 01:41:48.430
<v Speaker 2>I hear people saying,</v>

3664
01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:48.731
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3665
01:41:48.731 --> 01:41:49.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3666
01:41:49.001 --> 01:41:50.500
<v Speaker 2>kids and what about the kids?</v>

3667
01:41:50.501 --> 01:41:51.334
<v Speaker 2>What about the kids?</v>

3668
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:53.230
<v Speaker 2>What about the kids with fucking anything?</v>

3669
01:41:53.231 --> 01:41:54.610
<v Speaker 2>Kids can die from aspirin.</v>

3670
01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Kids can die if they have a contest to see who eats more salt.</v>

3671
01:41:58.330 --> 01:42:00.460
<v Speaker 2>Kids can die doing a lot of fucking shit.</v>

3672
01:42:00.490 --> 01:42:01.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3673
01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:02.140
<v Speaker 2>it's not about kids,</v>

3674
01:42:02.141 --> 01:42:04.750
<v Speaker 2>it's about responsible use of adults.</v>

3675
01:42:05.110 --> 01:42:06.250
<v Speaker 2>If it's your kid,</v>

3676
01:42:06.370 --> 01:42:09.780
<v Speaker 2>you have a obligation to educate your children.</v>

3677
01:42:09.810 --> 01:42:13.060
<v Speaker 2>Do the best you can to protect them from the dangers of this world.</v>

3678
01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:14.860
<v Speaker 2>All drugs are a part of that,</v>

3679
01:42:14.861 --> 01:42:19.861
<v Speaker 2>including hundreds of legal ones that are available right now that can kill your</v>

3680
01:42:20.021 --> 01:42:20.410
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

3681
01:42:20.410 --> 01:42:22.330
<v Speaker 2>So that's not the issue.</v>

3682
01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Marijuana is a minor,</v>

3683
01:42:24.311 --> 01:42:24.881
<v Speaker 2>minor,</v>

3684
01:42:24.881 --> 01:42:27.130
<v Speaker 2>minor issue when it comes to health and safety.</v>

3685
01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:31.960
<v Speaker 2>It's a major issue when it comes to consciousness and maybe even more so when it</v>

3686
01:42:31.961 --> 01:42:35.290
<v Speaker 2>comes to the implementation of hemp as a commodity.</v>

3687
01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:36.700
<v Speaker 2>Hemp for paper,</v>

3688
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:39.040
<v Speaker 2>hemp for building materials,</v>

3689
01:42:39.130 --> 01:42:42.280
<v Speaker 2>hemp for automobile panels that are lighter and more durable.</v>

3690
01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:47.500
<v Speaker 2>Henry Ford figured that shit out at the turn of the 19th or the 20th century.</v>

3691
01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:48.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3692
01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:48.170
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3693
01:42:48.170 --> 01:42:51.490
<v Speaker 2>he was doing that in the early 19 hundreds.</v>

3694
01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:52.750
<v Speaker 2>This guy had figured that out.</v>

3695
01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:57.010
<v Speaker 2>The pants they make out of it and shirts and everything and they're durable.</v>

3696
01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:59.050
<v Speaker 2>They're way more durable than cotton.</v>

3697
01:42:59.051 --> 01:43:01.600
<v Speaker 2>And now that also has one of the best root system.</v>

3698
01:43:01.601 --> 01:43:02.434
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

3699
01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:03.720
<v Speaker 2>with it did to do with,</v>

3700
01:43:03.721 --> 01:43:07.360
<v Speaker 2>what would it be good idea to do is where you have these erosion problems.</v>

3701
01:43:07.690 --> 01:43:08.920
<v Speaker 2>If they plant weed in there,</v>

3702
01:43:08.921 --> 01:43:09.101
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3703
01:43:09.101 --> 01:43:09.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3704
01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:10.640
<v Speaker 2>the rooting system hamper.</v>

3705
01:43:10.650 --> 01:43:11.171
<v Speaker 2>You got to see him.</v>

3706
01:43:11.171 --> 01:43:11.860
<v Speaker 2>He got to see him.</v>

3707
01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:12.481
<v Speaker 2>When I say we,</v>

3708
01:43:12.481 --> 01:43:13.120
<v Speaker 2>they think you're helping.</v>

3709
01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:13.830
<v Speaker 2>You want to get high.</v>

3710
01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:14.663
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3711
01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:15.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3712
01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:17.360
<v Speaker 2>that's just that.</v>

3713
01:43:17.370 --> 01:43:19.180
<v Speaker 2>Just get in your own safety of your house,</v>

3714
01:43:19.390 --> 01:43:22.040
<v Speaker 2>this other stuff you could put outside and let it grow.</v>

3715
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:24.280
<v Speaker 2>Hemp is a very strange plan.</v>

3716
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:24.940
<v Speaker 2>There's really no,</v>

3717
01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:25.210
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3718
01:43:25.210 --> 01:43:28.330
<v Speaker 2>no plant like it on earth and it's incredibly hard and dense,</v>

3719
01:43:28.331 --> 01:43:33.331
<v Speaker 2>but very light is what seeds they make that that Omega three to Omega six that</v>

3720
01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:39.400
<v Speaker 2>well the protein to hemp protein is the most easily digestible protein and we</v>

3721
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:40.990
<v Speaker 2>sell it at a on it,</v>

3722
01:43:40.991 --> 01:43:43.480
<v Speaker 2>we sell a a hemp protein supplement.</v>

3723
01:43:43.481 --> 01:43:45.280
<v Speaker 2>We bought the best hemp you can get.</v>

3724
01:43:45.281 --> 01:43:46.270
<v Speaker 2>It's really fine.</v>

3725
01:43:46.271 --> 01:43:48.520
<v Speaker 2>It's very high in proteins to the most expensive,</v>

3726
01:43:48.521 --> 01:43:50.980
<v Speaker 2>but it's the best and a lot of people don't like the taste,</v>

3727
01:43:51.110 --> 01:43:51.950
<v Speaker 2>think it tastes delicious.</v>

3728
01:43:51.951 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

3729
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:53.780
<v Speaker 1>I was fixing it up with coconut water.</v>

3730
01:43:54.130 --> 01:43:54.600
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>

3731
01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:55.610
<v Speaker 1>I just throw a banana,</v>

3732
01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:59.540
<v Speaker 1>coconut water and hemp force into a blender and that's how I do it.</v>

3733
01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3734
01:44:00.050 --> 01:44:00.950
<v Speaker 1>you're off to the races.</v>

3735
01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:02.120
<v Speaker 1>He tug just easy.</v>

3736
01:44:02.150 --> 01:44:03.170
<v Speaker 1>The thing about like,</v>

3737
01:44:03.171 --> 01:44:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I like a lot of different protein powders,</v>

3738
01:44:05.331 --> 01:44:06.980
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like the vegetable proteins,</v>

3739
01:44:06.981 --> 01:44:08.120
<v Speaker 1>I like pea protein.</v>

3740
01:44:08.150 --> 01:44:09.860
<v Speaker 1>There's a Vega that is a,</v>

3741
01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:12.560
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an all vegan based protein powder,</v>

3742
01:44:12.561 --> 01:44:14.390
<v Speaker 1>all plant based protein powder that I like to,</v>

3743
01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:15.530
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>

3744
01:44:15.530 --> 01:44:18.200
<v Speaker 1>I liked those because they digest very easily.</v>

3745
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:19.780
<v Speaker 1>You're getting the impact from it.</v>

3746
01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3747
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I think it's also,</v>

3748
01:44:21.501 --> 01:44:22.730
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy on the body,</v>

3749
01:44:22.731 --> 01:44:24.260
<v Speaker 1>whereas I feel like whey protein,</v>

3750
01:44:24.261 --> 01:44:25.670
<v Speaker 1>which is also very effective,</v>

3751
01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:27.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's made from you know,</v>

3752
01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:29.420
<v Speaker 1>way which is made from milk products.</v>

3753
01:44:29.450 --> 01:44:29.721
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3754
01:44:29.721 --> 01:44:30.230
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

3755
01:44:30.230 --> 01:44:33.250
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't quite digest as easily feel it feel like,</v>

3756
01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:34.630
<v Speaker 1>makes my farts stink here too.</v>

3757
01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:37.330
<v Speaker 1>They have to keep side so that everybody's happy.</v>

3758
01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:40.820
<v Speaker 1>My body has no problem with digesting it,</v>

3759
01:44:40.970 --> 01:44:41.600
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3760
01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:44.430
<v Speaker 1>And it's illegal to grow in America from Canada.</v>

3761
01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>

3762
01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:46.071
<v Speaker 1>So stupid.</v>

3763
01:44:46.071 --> 01:44:46.761
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>

3764
01:44:46.761 --> 01:44:47.594
<v Speaker 1>I used to say,</v>

3765
01:44:47.630 --> 01:44:48.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say my mom is it?</v>

3766
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:50.330
<v Speaker 1>What is wrong with this stuff?</v>

3767
01:44:50.331 --> 01:44:50.720
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

3768
01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:53.240
<v Speaker 1>oh well it's all legal and that was the best they could come up with.</v>

3769
01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:54.170
<v Speaker 1>That's not even,</v>

3770
01:44:54.170 --> 01:44:57.200
<v Speaker 1>well that doesn't even work with hemp because hemp can't get you high.</v>

3771
01:44:57.340 --> 01:44:59.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just the point I was worried about the other part growing,</v>

3772
01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:02.480
<v Speaker 1>but growing hemp is like growing pine trees was like,</v>

3773
01:45:02.481 --> 01:45:04.730
<v Speaker 1>what if someone came along and said he can't show growth pine trees,</v>

3774
01:45:04.731 --> 01:45:05.421
<v Speaker 1>no more pine trees.</v>

3775
01:45:05.421 --> 01:45:07.550
<v Speaker 1>You can't make pine tables.</v>

3776
01:45:07.770 --> 01:45:09.560
<v Speaker 1>He can't make pine bed stands,</v>

3777
01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:10.953
<v Speaker 1>no more pine.</v>

3778
01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:11.421
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

3779
01:45:11.421 --> 01:45:12.410
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

3780
01:45:12.411 --> 01:45:16.700
<v Speaker 1>I can't grow pine or rose fucking crazy girl rose bushes stuff out.</v>

3781
01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:21.440
<v Speaker 1>But the preposterousness of pine is a good one because it's so readily</v>

3782
01:45:21.441 --> 01:45:22.130
<v Speaker 1>available.</v>

3783
01:45:22.130 --> 01:45:22.311
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3784
01:45:22.311 --> 01:45:24.110
<v Speaker 1>if marijuana was legal,</v>

3785
01:45:24.170 --> 01:45:26.420
<v Speaker 1>it could be as readily available as pine trees.</v>

3786
01:45:26.421 --> 01:45:27.890
<v Speaker 1>The shit grows everywhere.</v>

3787
01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:29.420
<v Speaker 1>If fucking grows everywhere,</v>

3788
01:45:29.570 --> 01:45:32.240
<v Speaker 1>and for the past hundred years almost,</v>

3789
01:45:32.270 --> 01:45:36.650
<v Speaker 1>there's been this ridiculous boycott on this magical plant.</v>

3790
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:38.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a magical plant.</v>

3791
01:45:38.570 --> 01:45:41.150
<v Speaker 1>If it didn't exist and someone told you about it from another planet,</v>

3792
01:45:41.151 --> 01:45:43.220
<v Speaker 1>we would be sending spaceships out to get it.</v>

3793
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:44.030
<v Speaker 1>If there was,</v>

3794
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:47.590
<v Speaker 1>if we found that there was pot growing on the moon and they found if the,</v>

3795
01:45:47.591 --> 01:45:51.950
<v Speaker 1>if the astronauts went to the moon and they came back with a plan and over the</v>

3796
01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:55.790
<v Speaker 1>next decade they analyze this plan and found it to have a million different uses</v>

3797
01:45:55.791 --> 01:45:58.910
<v Speaker 1>psychoactively medically to treat PTSD,</v>

3798
01:45:59.090 --> 01:46:04.070
<v Speaker 1>interocular pressure from fucking glaucoma to give people their appetite back</v>

3799
01:46:04.071 --> 01:46:04.910
<v Speaker 1>where they're going through chemo.</v>

3800
01:46:04.911 --> 01:46:05.151
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

3801
01:46:05.151 --> 01:46:08.690
<v Speaker 1>you go through a laundry list of benefits at this fucking alien plant.</v>

3802
01:46:08.690 --> 01:46:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Had they had do that fucking,</v>

3803
01:46:10.911 --> 01:46:11.930
<v Speaker 1>what's that Virgin Guy,</v>

3804
01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:12.591
<v Speaker 1>Richard Branson.</v>

3805
01:46:12.591 --> 01:46:15.320
<v Speaker 1>He's to be sent in space ships out to the moon with farmers.</v>

3806
01:46:15.380 --> 01:46:19.610
<v Speaker 1>They'd have Mexicans in space flying to the moon to harvest the marijuana and</v>

3807
01:46:19.611 --> 01:46:20.450
<v Speaker 1>bring it back home.</v>

3808
01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:21.920
<v Speaker 1>That's where we got along here.</v>

3809
01:46:22.030 --> 01:46:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3810
01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:24.740
<v Speaker 1>And we got an ear and these kinds of trying to keep it illegal.</v>

3811
01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:26.510
<v Speaker 1>Amazing dummies like that.</v>

3812
01:46:26.511 --> 01:46:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Chris Christie dummy.</v>

3813

3815
01:46:29.211 --> 01:46:29.780
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

3816
01:46:29.780 --> 01:46:30.561
<v Speaker 1>I don't dummies.</v>

3817
01:46:30.561 --> 01:46:32.630
<v Speaker 1>They re they rail against it.</v>

3818
01:46:32.631 --> 01:46:33.421
<v Speaker 1>They railed,</v>

3819
01:46:33.421 --> 01:46:33.930
<v Speaker 1>they rallied,</v>

3820

3822
01:46:36.741 --> 01:46:38.930
<v Speaker 1>That what we need to do is have them on the right side.</v>

3823
01:46:38.931 --> 01:46:39.764
<v Speaker 1>So you need to get high.</v>

3824
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:41.420
<v Speaker 1>They need to just chill down and say,</v>

3825
01:46:41.421 --> 01:46:41.930

01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:51.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3837
01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Or sell that stuff.</v>

3838
01:46:52.290 --> 01:46:53.370
<v Speaker 1>Don't grab a cat.</v>

3839
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.641
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

3840
01:46:53.641 --> 01:46:53.941
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

3841
01:46:53.941 --> 01:46:58.080
<v Speaker 1>we use it in our product now we use this stuff because we found it's better than</v>

3842
01:46:58.081 --> 01:46:59.160
<v Speaker 1>what we used to use.</v>

3843
01:46:59.490 --> 01:46:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3844
01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:03.300
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of things that could be done to make people,</v>

3845
01:47:03.301 --> 01:47:03.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3846
01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:05.640
<v Speaker 1>overall just overall in this country.</v>

3847
01:47:05.641 --> 01:47:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Just a wee bit healthier,</v>

3848
01:47:07.081 --> 01:47:10.110
<v Speaker 1>just a little bit of a change in the dial and the direction that we're all</v>

3849
01:47:10.111 --> 01:47:10.550
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

3850
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:12.720
<v Speaker 1>I can remember an Anthony Robbins who a,</v>

3851
01:47:12.721 --> 01:47:15.840
<v Speaker 1>although I've made fun of a inspirational guys I think is actually a very</v>

3852
01:47:15.841 --> 01:47:16.674
<v Speaker 1>inspirational guy.</v>

3853
01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:17.191
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3854
01:47:17.191 --> 01:47:21.300
<v Speaker 1>I think Anthony robins has some really good advice and I've read a bunch of</v>

3855
01:47:21.301 --> 01:47:22.500
<v Speaker 1>different things that he said.</v>

3856
01:47:22.530 --> 01:47:24.810
<v Speaker 1>And back when I was competing and my martial arts days,</v>

3857
01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:28.020
<v Speaker 1>I actually benefited very much from a lot of his,</v>

3858
01:47:28.021 --> 01:47:30.840
<v Speaker 1>he had audio books I listened to by the pool when I listened to live in a shitty</v>

3859
01:47:30.841 --> 01:47:31.674
<v Speaker 1>apartment.</v>

3860
01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:32.400
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

3861
01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:36.270
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that he said was that if you would take into consideration</v>

3862
01:47:36.271 --> 01:47:38.040
<v Speaker 1>like two cars that are a,</v>

3863
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:39.270
<v Speaker 1>going in a certain direction,</v>

3864
01:47:39.450 --> 01:47:43.590
<v Speaker 1>if one of them just has a very slight variation off the line,</v>

3865
01:47:43.770 --> 01:47:46.020
<v Speaker 1>just a slight over the course of time,</v>

3866
01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:50.370
<v Speaker 1>the distance that it goes from the original direction it was going to is vast.</v>

3867
01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:52.140
<v Speaker 1>It's just a small change.</v>

3868
01:47:52.141 --> 01:47:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Just a small adjustment.</v>

3869
01:47:53.850 --> 01:47:55.350
<v Speaker 1>And I think that could be said,</v>

3870
01:47:55.351 --> 01:47:57.960
<v Speaker 1>not just of cars that are driving parallel to each other,</v>

3871
01:47:57.961 --> 01:47:58.830
<v Speaker 1>but if a culture,</v>

3872
01:47:59.190 --> 01:48:03.300
<v Speaker 1>and I think that if something like the tank came along and the tank in</v>

3873
01:48:03.301 --> 01:48:08.301
<v Speaker 1>conjunction with this new found refusal to accept the marijuana laws,</v>

3874
01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:10.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a new found refusal.</v>

3875
01:48:10.530 --> 01:48:11.490
<v Speaker 1>And now Colorado,</v>

3876
01:48:11.491 --> 01:48:12.091
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

3877
01:48:12.091 --> 01:48:12.361
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3878
01:48:12.361 --> 01:48:16.050
<v Speaker 1>an article that was written that came out today and I think it came out today.</v>

3879
01:48:16.051 --> 01:48:17.460
<v Speaker 1>I found out about it today.</v>

3880
01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:20.340
<v Speaker 1>I retweeted it today from a reset me,</v>

3881
01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:22.530
<v Speaker 1>which is our friend amber lions website.</v>

3882
01:48:22.710 --> 01:48:24.380
<v Speaker 1>And essentially it's,</v>

3883
01:48:24.381 --> 01:48:29.381
<v Speaker 1>it's talking about how Colorado has made more money and had less crime and the</v>

3884
01:48:30.091 --> 01:48:31.620
<v Speaker 1>tax is six months.</v>

3885
01:48:31.890 --> 01:48:32.723
<v Speaker 1>Read about the school.</v>

3886
01:48:32.910 --> 01:48:35.370
<v Speaker 1>They gave him point 9 billion or something for the school system.</v>

3887
01:48:35.371 --> 01:48:36.390
<v Speaker 1>The woman who wrote it,</v>

3888
01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:39.420
<v Speaker 1>or her name is Laura Pedrum and uh,</v>

3889
01:48:39.421 --> 01:48:39.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3890
01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:41.460
<v Speaker 1>it came out on the 27th.</v>

3891
01:48:41.461 --> 01:48:43.350
<v Speaker 1>So days answers school.</v>

3892
01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3893
01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine that they're doing something on the planet that's putting money</v>

3894
01:48:48.901 --> 01:48:53.901
<v Speaker 1>into schools and it's this and it's empowering people start their own business.</v>

3895
01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:55.450
<v Speaker 1>The right people,</v>

3896
01:48:56.220 --> 01:48:58.410
<v Speaker 1>people who are into weed,</v>

3897
01:48:58.590 --> 01:49:00.450
<v Speaker 1>they're going to start their own businesses and get rich.</v>

3898
01:49:00.570 --> 01:49:02.310
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a weird thing when we'd,</v>

3899
01:49:02.311 --> 01:49:06.870
<v Speaker 1>farmers are like a bunch of rich people running around funding schools.</v>

3900
01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:10.020
<v Speaker 1>We'd farmers are paying for the police to have better facilities.</v>

3901
01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:13.440
<v Speaker 1>We'd farmers are paying for the fire department to be better equipped.</v>

3902
01:49:13.650 --> 01:49:16.290
<v Speaker 1>We'd farmers are paying for the teachers to make more money.</v>

3903
01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:17.250
<v Speaker 1>Like this is all,</v>

3904
01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:18.630
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a pipe dream.</v>

3905
01:49:18.631 --> 01:49:22.770
<v Speaker 1>This is all a very possibility with the community and the officials in the</v>

3906
01:49:22.771 --> 01:49:24.960
<v Speaker 1>community to create a situation.</v>

3907
01:49:25.230 --> 01:49:28.650
<v Speaker 1>These guys could be major influences on the entire,</v>

3908
01:49:28.651 --> 01:49:29.730
<v Speaker 1>not only this part,</v>

3909
01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:30.680
<v Speaker 1>right in the podcast.</v>

3910
01:49:30.690 --> 01:49:34.800
<v Speaker 1>People that are listening who are not into wheat or like I'm fucking hanging up.</v>

3911
01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:35.780
<v Speaker 1>This stuffs are funneling.</v>

3912
01:49:35.781 --> 01:49:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Indoctrination.</v>

3913
01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:37.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3914
01:49:37.090 --> 01:49:37.923
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3915
01:49:38.010 --> 01:49:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Well even if you don't want to smoke weed,</v>

3916
01:49:40.980 --> 01:49:45.150
<v Speaker 1>how could you ever say that $100 million in cash revenue,</v>

3917
01:49:45.510 --> 01:49:48.220
<v Speaker 1>$100 million is not a great thing</v>

3918
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:51.460
<v Speaker 2>that you get that kind of taxes from your first year and who knows where this is</v>

3919
01:49:51.461 --> 01:49:53.560
<v Speaker 2>going to go can easily double by the second year.</v>

3920
01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:56.110
<v Speaker 2>So then you got $200 million in tax revenue.</v>

3921
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:57.303
<v Speaker 2>Oh my goodness.</v>

3922
01:49:57.330 --> 01:49:58.100
<v Speaker 2>They focus where?</v>

3923
01:49:58.100 --> 01:49:58.600
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>

3924
01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:02.980
<v Speaker 2>how much of the tax that you paid last month went to the school system?</v>

3925
01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:04.113
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

3926
01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:07.150
<v Speaker 2>How much did the school get to Colorado?</v>

3927
01:50:07.370 --> 01:50:09.250
<v Speaker 2>Colorado is not that big.</v>

3928
01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:09.821
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3929
01:50:09.821 --> 01:50:10.451
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

3930
01:50:10.451 --> 01:50:10.720
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3931
01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:11.530
<v Speaker 2>it's big,</v>

3932
01:50:11.530 --> 01:50:14.530
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like the amount of people as California,</v>

3933
01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:14.860
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3934
01:50:14.860 --> 01:50:15.521
<v Speaker 2>Not even close.</v>

3935
01:50:15.521 --> 01:50:16.810
<v Speaker 2>So you spread that money out.</v>

3936
01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:18.030
<v Speaker 2>If you've got,</v>

3937
01:50:18.030 --> 01:50:18.480
<v Speaker 2>you had to,</v>

3938
01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:18.591
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3939
01:50:18.591 --> 01:50:21.490
<v Speaker 2>also there's an 800 kids and they made $1,000 or whatever.</v>

3940
01:50:21.491 --> 01:50:26.491
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how much money marijuana would make in California if they just sent</v>

3941
01:50:27.671 --> 01:50:29.440
<v Speaker 2>it loose to set it loose?</v>

3942
01:50:29.441 --> 01:50:32.020
<v Speaker 2>Just unleashed it fully legal.</v>

3943
01:50:32.110 --> 01:50:32.890
<v Speaker 2>Let's go.</v>

3944
01:50:32.890 --> 01:50:33.191
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3945
01:50:33.191 --> 01:50:33.700
<v Speaker 2>just the,</v>

3946
01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:38.700
<v Speaker 2>the medical industry here is so gigantic that there's businesses were doctors</v>

3947
01:50:39.641 --> 01:50:41.050
<v Speaker 2>just give people we'd prescriptions.</v>

3948
01:50:41.050 --> 01:50:41.730
<v Speaker 2>It's all they do.</v>

3949
01:50:41.730 --> 01:50:42.280
<v Speaker 2>That's all they do.</v>

3950
01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:43.920
<v Speaker 2>They have a line of people with headaches out the door.</v>

3951
01:50:43.921 --> 01:50:44.754
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3952
01:50:46.530 --> 01:50:47.440
<v Speaker 2>that's their business.</v>

3953
01:50:47.441 --> 01:50:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's paying 40 bucks and they're keeping it moving.</v>

3954
01:50:49.660 --> 01:50:50.560
<v Speaker 2>And that's legal.</v>

3955
01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:51.371
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

3956
01:50:51.371 --> 01:50:54.010
<v Speaker 2>what they've done legally is crazy.</v>

3957
01:50:54.011 --> 01:50:55.420
<v Speaker 2>If they made it fully legal.</v>

3958
01:50:55.720 --> 01:50:57.910
<v Speaker 2>If they just said release the hounds,</v>

3959
01:50:58.110 --> 01:50:59.050
<v Speaker 2>it would change the culture.</v>

3960
01:50:59.230 --> 01:51:00.520
<v Speaker 2>It really would and it would.</v>

3961
01:51:00.521 --> 01:51:01.061
<v Speaker 2>It would help.</v>

3962
01:51:01.061 --> 01:51:03.580
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people would help a lot of people that are resisting it.</v>

3963
01:51:03.581 --> 01:51:06.310
<v Speaker 2>It would help a lot of athletes and the big one that would help a lot of</v>

3964
01:51:06.311 --> 01:51:07.510
<v Speaker 2>athletes is edible.</v>

3965
01:51:07.670 --> 01:51:10.030
<v Speaker 2>Edible marijuana for inflammation,</v>

3966
01:51:10.031 --> 01:51:11.050
<v Speaker 2>for injuries,</v>

3967
01:51:11.230 --> 01:51:12.220
<v Speaker 2>for relaxation,</v>

3968
01:51:12.221 --> 01:51:14.350
<v Speaker 2>for stretching just for your body.</v>

3969
01:51:14.351 --> 01:51:19.330
<v Speaker 2>Just forget about the psychoactive effects of introspection and self analysis</v>

3970
01:51:19.331 --> 01:51:20.830
<v Speaker 2>and all that other stuff that comes with the eating it,</v>

3971
01:51:21.070 --> 01:51:23.410
<v Speaker 2>the really the physical benefits,</v>

3972
01:51:23.411 --> 01:51:25.810
<v Speaker 2>so it'd be pretty substantial nutritional benefits.</v>

3973
01:51:26.230 --> 01:51:27.070
<v Speaker 2>There's the nutrition.</v>

3974
01:51:27.071 --> 01:51:28.070
<v Speaker 2>You already talked about that.</v>

3975
01:51:28.110 --> 01:51:28.720
<v Speaker 2>I can eat it.</v>

3976
01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:29.553
<v Speaker 2>It's really good for that.</v>

3977
01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:30.370
<v Speaker 2>Super Healthy,</v>

3978
01:51:30.370 --> 01:51:31.203
<v Speaker 2>great for your skin.</v>

3979
01:51:31.210 --> 01:51:32.260
<v Speaker 2>Hemp oil is good for your skin.</v>

3980
01:51:32.261 --> 01:51:33.094
<v Speaker 2>You can cook with it.</v>

3981
01:51:33.250 --> 01:51:33.731
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

3982
01:51:33.731 --> 01:51:35.030
<v Speaker 2>It's just so much more with it.</v>

3983
01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:36.340
<v Speaker 2>Run a car on it.</v>

3984
01:51:36.850 --> 01:51:37.511
<v Speaker 2>You could run a car,</v>

3985
01:51:37.511 --> 01:51:37.991
<v Speaker 2>you get burned.</v>

3986
01:51:37.991 --> 01:51:38.824
<v Speaker 2>Hemp oil.</v>

3987
01:51:39.130 --> 01:51:42.760
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is so ridiculous that if you looked at it on paper and it wasn't</v>

3988
01:51:42.761 --> 01:51:43.330
<v Speaker 2>the same,</v>

3989
01:51:43.330 --> 01:51:43.511
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3990
01:51:43.511 --> 01:51:44.560
<v Speaker 2>we have this stuff.</v>

3991
01:51:44.561 --> 01:51:45.850
<v Speaker 2>We just figured it out today.</v>

3992
01:51:46.090 --> 01:51:49.780
<v Speaker 2>It's called a slippery a whatever and we have it.</v>

3993
01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:50.680
<v Speaker 2>What would be the great,</v>

3994
01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:55.480
<v Speaker 2>it'll be a great plot for a book if there was a company that somehow or another</v>

3995
01:51:55.481 --> 01:51:59.470
<v Speaker 2>managed to plot against one of the most beneficial plants on earth and</v>

3996
01:51:59.471 --> 01:52:03.700
<v Speaker 2>suppressed the the development and use of it for almost a century if that,</v>

3997
01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:08.530
<v Speaker 2>if that was a book you would like be captivated by this plot,</v>

3998
01:52:08.531 --> 01:52:11.950
<v Speaker 2>like could this happen cause this possible the one of the most beneficial plants</v>

3999
01:52:11.951 --> 01:52:13.900
<v Speaker 2>ever known demand could be stifled.</v>

4000
01:52:13.930 --> 01:52:16.720
<v Speaker 2>They might've known about it in the beginning and then cut it off.</v>

4001
01:52:16.721 --> 01:52:17.020
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

4002
01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:19.240
<v Speaker 2>oh this stuff could catch on.</v>

4003
01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:24.070
<v Speaker 2>I think that what happens is one of the things that happens is when anything is</v>

4004
01:52:24.071 --> 01:52:26.350
<v Speaker 2>illegal and then you start arresting people for that thing.</v>

4005
01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:29.170
<v Speaker 2>You make a business and I'm arresting people for that thing.</v>

4006
01:52:29.410 --> 01:52:31.420
<v Speaker 2>You make a business out of that thing being illegal.</v>

4007
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:33.220
<v Speaker 2>And then like we were talking about before,</v>

4008
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:34.990
<v Speaker 2>when those guys are out of a job,</v>

4009
01:52:35.110 --> 01:52:36.070
<v Speaker 2>like they're just out of a job.</v>

4010
01:52:36.071 --> 01:52:37.540
<v Speaker 2>So they'll fight to keep their fucking job.</v>

4011
01:52:37.541 --> 01:52:40.780
<v Speaker 2>And one of the best ways to keep your jobs to keep more things illegal.</v>

4012
01:52:41.050 --> 01:52:43.030
<v Speaker 2>If you're a guy who arrest people for Shit,</v>

4013
01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:46.520
<v Speaker 2>you want to make sure that more like marijuana</v>

4014
01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:49.130
<v Speaker 1>stay illegal because especially the DEA,</v>

4015
01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:52.340
<v Speaker 1>what would they get do if marijuana became legal?</v>

4016
01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:56.990
<v Speaker 1>And then people would start to have to have to start considering all sorts of</v>

4017
01:52:56.991 --> 01:52:58.670
<v Speaker 1>other drugs becoming legal as well.</v>

4018
01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:01.010
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they could figure out how to direct like the,</v>

4019
01:53:01.011 --> 01:53:01.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4020
01:53:01.730 --> 01:53:02.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4021
01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:02.451
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4022
01:53:02.451 --> 01:53:02.870
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4023
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:03.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4024
01:53:03.380 --> 01:53:07.450
<v Speaker 4>business aspects of it just ready to take this money now and we'll have a,</v>

4025
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:07.840
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

4026
01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:08.673
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4027
01:53:08.690 --> 01:53:09.620
<v Speaker 4>an agency,</v>

4028
01:53:09.650 --> 01:53:11.060
<v Speaker 4>let's say that,</v>

4029
01:53:11.110 --> 01:53:11.390
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4030
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:14.000
<v Speaker 4>works directly with these people that then,</v>

4031
01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:14.601
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4032
01:53:14.601 --> 01:53:16.550
<v Speaker 4>maybe then they could have a place and,</v>

4033
01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:17.660
<v Speaker 4>and being helpful,</v>

4034
01:53:17.780 --> 01:53:18.330
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4035
01:53:18.330 --> 01:53:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4036
01:53:18.780 --> 01:53:19.111
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4037
01:53:19.111 --> 01:53:19.771
<v Speaker 1>obviously folks,</v>

4038
01:53:19.771 --> 01:53:20.100
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>

4039
01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:21.990
<v Speaker 1>this is not something that we thought on an advanced.</v>

4040
01:53:21.991 --> 01:53:23.550
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to work this shit out on the fly.</v>

4041
01:53:23.710 --> 01:53:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4042
01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:25.650
<v Speaker 1>This is not the best way to design a government,</v>

4043
01:53:27.150 --> 01:53:28.830
<v Speaker 1>but it might be better than what's already in place.</v>

4044
01:53:29.190 --> 01:53:30.100
<v Speaker 1>You know what's already in place.</v>

4045
01:53:30.101 --> 01:53:31.380
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucking silly.</v>

4046
01:53:31.410 --> 01:53:32.790
<v Speaker 1>You can't tell people they can't have,</v>

4047
01:53:32.791 --> 01:53:33.630
<v Speaker 1>we'd stop it.</v>

4048
01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:34.410
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

4049
01:53:34.410 --> 01:53:36.170
<v Speaker 1>you can't tell if they're very nice to,</v>

4050
01:53:36.171 --> 01:53:39.160
<v Speaker 1>to involve yourself in other people's business like that.</v>

4051
01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:40.770
<v Speaker 1>They're not involved in yours,</v>

4052
01:53:40.830 --> 01:53:41.820
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're ignorant.</v>

4053
01:53:42.090 --> 01:53:42.421
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4054
01:53:42.421 --> 01:53:43.254
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4055
01:53:43.290 --> 01:53:43.680
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4056
01:53:43.680 --> 01:53:45.990
<v Speaker 1>when I was first starting to work for the UFC,</v>

4057
01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:49.500
<v Speaker 1>I would often encounter these articles that were written that were critical of</v>

4058
01:53:49.501 --> 01:53:52.980
<v Speaker 1>mixed martial arts and I could tell by reading the article that the person who</v>

4059
01:53:52.981 --> 01:53:55.050
<v Speaker 1>was writing it had no idea what they were talking about.</v>

4060
01:53:55.051 --> 01:53:56.430
<v Speaker 1>They didn't understand the sport.</v>

4061
01:53:56.690 --> 01:53:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Like from a fundamental level,</v>

4062
01:53:58.110 --> 01:53:59.850
<v Speaker 1>they were incorrect about the rules.</v>

4063
01:53:59.970 --> 01:54:02.550
<v Speaker 1>They were incorrect about what was allowed.</v>

4064
01:54:02.580 --> 01:54:06.630
<v Speaker 1>They were incorrect about the size of the participants that they were one size</v>

4065
01:54:06.631 --> 01:54:07.770
<v Speaker 1>against eat all,</v>

4066
01:54:07.771 --> 01:54:08.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4067
01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:09.550
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know they were there.</v>

4068
01:54:09.710 --> 01:54:13.650
<v Speaker 1>They were acting on really old information and really bad information.</v>

4069
01:54:13.770 --> 01:54:17.670
<v Speaker 1>But yet here they are writing for some loving an opinion in writing it in a</v>

4070
01:54:17.671 --> 01:54:20.460
<v Speaker 1>published form where they spreading it out to the world.</v>

4071
01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:24.000
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're doing when it comes to psycho appreciation.</v>

4072
01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:25.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like having a guy do a wine,</v>

4073
01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:27.870
<v Speaker 1>a wine review.</v>

4074
01:54:28.170 --> 01:54:29.640
<v Speaker 1>This never had any wine.</v>

4075
01:54:30.390 --> 01:54:30.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4076
01:54:30.691 --> 01:54:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Well I'll,</v>

4077
01:54:31.601 --> 01:54:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I'll do you one better.</v>

4078
01:54:32.671 --> 01:54:37.671
<v Speaker 1>Anybody that is trying to get anything like marijuana or mushrooms or any of</v>

4079
01:54:39.151 --> 01:54:42.960
<v Speaker 1>these things removed from the culture and has no experience in them whatsoever.</v>

4080
01:54:43.110 --> 01:54:45.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like a guy who's never had sex trying to make sex illegal.</v>

4081
01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:46.823
<v Speaker 1>It's mean.</v>

4082
01:54:47.070 --> 01:54:47.430
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4083
01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:47.641
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4084
01:54:47.641 --> 01:54:48.570
<v Speaker 1>it's insane.</v>

4085
01:54:48.610 --> 01:54:50.760
<v Speaker 1>It's insane that anybody allows it.</v>

4086
01:54:51.090 --> 01:54:54.660
<v Speaker 1>If someone who has never had sex before tried to make sex illegal to all of us</v>

4087
01:54:54.690 --> 01:54:55.650
<v Speaker 1>that enjoy sex,</v>

4088
01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:56.191
<v Speaker 1>he'd be like,</v>

4089
01:54:56.191 --> 01:54:56.941
<v Speaker 1>are you crazy?</v>

4090
01:54:56.941 --> 01:54:58.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of my favorite things,</v>

4091
01:54:58.620 --> 01:55:00.210
<v Speaker 1>like why would you cut the sex out?</v>

4092
01:55:00.490 --> 01:55:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't get sex so you don't get sex.</v>

4093
01:55:02.521 --> 01:55:03.354
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>

4094
01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:04.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't appreciate it.</v>

4095
01:55:04.281 --> 01:55:05.290
<v Speaker 1>It rots your brain.</v>

4096
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:10.350
<v Speaker 1>We can journeys and someone could just somehow or another trick people and did</v>

4097
01:55:10.411 --> 01:55:11.250
<v Speaker 1>not having sex.</v>

4098
01:55:11.310 --> 01:55:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Obviously sex is a natural urge.</v>

4099
01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana is something that you learn about,</v>

4100
01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:20.720
<v Speaker 1>but they're both beneficial and enjoyable aspects of this beautiful thing called</v>

4101
01:55:21.061 --> 01:55:23.670
<v Speaker 1>life and for whatever fucking reason,</v>

4102
01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:27.540
<v Speaker 1>we've allowed these dummies that are obviously like you look at a guy like Newt</v>

4103
01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Gingrich.</v>

4104
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.991
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

4105
01:55:27.991 --> 01:55:28.260
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

4106
01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:28.770
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

4107
01:55:28.770 --> 01:55:30.060
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to tell me anything.</v>

4108
01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:34.530
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to tell me what to do or how to live at all.</v>

4109
01:55:34.710 --> 01:55:35.730
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to,</v>

4110
01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:36.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in you.</v>

4111
01:55:37.230 --> 01:55:41.370
<v Speaker 1>You know I think your corporate puppet and you don't get to tell me that pot's</v>

4112
01:55:41.371 --> 01:55:41.810
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

4113
01:55:41.810 --> 01:55:42.990
<v Speaker 1>When I look at Chris Christie,</v>

4114
01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 1>you're 300</v>

4115
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:44.341
<v Speaker 2>pounds.</v>

4116
01:55:44.341 --> 01:55:45.630
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to give advice.</v>

4117
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:47.370
<v Speaker 2>You don't get to give advice.</v>

4118
01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:48.001
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4119
01:55:48.001 --> 01:55:49.640
<v Speaker 2>marijuana rots the brain and this.</v>

4120
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:51.000
<v Speaker 2>What about your fucking brain?</v>

4121
01:55:51.001 --> 01:55:54.060
<v Speaker 2>It's allowed you to balloon up like an other animal.</v>

4122
01:55:54.150 --> 01:55:55.500
<v Speaker 2>You don't even look like a human.</v>

4123
01:55:55.680 --> 01:55:57.060
<v Speaker 2>You look like some sloths,</v>

4124
01:55:57.090 --> 01:56:01.830
<v Speaker 2>some some walrus type creature that's waddled out of the ocean and put on big</v>

4125
01:56:01.831 --> 01:56:02.520
<v Speaker 2>pants.</v>

4126
01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:03.840
<v Speaker 2>You're ridiculous person.</v>

4127
01:56:03.841 --> 01:56:04.980
<v Speaker 2>You can't talk about marijuana.</v>

4128
01:56:04.981 --> 01:56:06.180
<v Speaker 2>You don't experience it.</v>

4129
01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:08.370
<v Speaker 2>If you don't experience it on a regular basis,</v>

4130
01:56:08.371 --> 01:56:09.960
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.</v>

4131
01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:12.090
<v Speaker 2>And that's the problem that we have in our culture.</v>

4132
01:56:12.270 --> 01:56:15.600
<v Speaker 2>We have these people that are giving advice on something that they have no</v>

4133
01:56:15.601 --> 01:56:16.150
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

4134
01:56:16.150 --> 01:56:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Other countries we're over at mixed up and other civilizations.</v>

4135
01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:20.591
<v Speaker 2>These people,</v>

4136
01:56:20.591 --> 01:56:23.040
<v Speaker 2>they are operating for thousands or hundreds or whatever it is.</v>

4137
01:56:23.041 --> 01:56:23.581
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

4138
01:56:23.581 --> 01:56:24.391
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to come over and say,</v>

4139
01:56:24.391 --> 01:56:24.930
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

4140
01:56:24.930 --> 01:56:25.380
<v Speaker 2>here we are.</v>

4141
01:56:25.380 --> 01:56:26.220
<v Speaker 2>Now we're going to tell you guys,</v>

4142
01:56:26.221 --> 01:56:26.580
<v Speaker 2>watch it.</v>

4143
01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:29.490
<v Speaker 2>We need humility from people that are leading.</v>

4144
01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:30.600
<v Speaker 2>That's a very important thing.</v>

4145
01:56:30.601 --> 01:56:33.780
<v Speaker 2>So when someone takes a big strong stance on something that they don't have</v>

4146
01:56:33.781 --> 01:56:36.510
<v Speaker 2>experience with or they don't have full knowledge of like this,</v>

4147
01:56:36.511 --> 01:56:39.630
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about some study that they've come out with it.</v>

4148
01:56:39.631 --> 01:56:41.160
<v Speaker 2>Marijuana affects the brain.</v>

4149
01:56:41.161 --> 01:56:41.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4150
01:56:41.371 --> 01:56:42.330
<v Speaker 2>it affects the brain,</v>

4151
01:56:42.420 --> 01:56:44.430
<v Speaker 2>but they don't know if it's good or bad.</v>

4152
01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Did you read that part of it?</v>

4153
01:56:46.050 --> 01:56:47.790
<v Speaker 2>They don't understand what the effects are,</v>

4154
01:56:47.791 --> 01:56:48.720
<v Speaker 2>what the negative effects are,</v>

4155
01:56:48.721 --> 01:56:51.450
<v Speaker 2>but here's other than short term memory loss,</v>

4156
01:56:51.451 --> 01:56:53.490
<v Speaker 2>no one's demonstrated anything really bad,</v>

4157
01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:55.530
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of positive shit,</v>

4158
01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:57.000
<v Speaker 2>tumor shrinkage,</v>

4159
01:56:57.180 --> 01:57:01.890
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of medical benefits to do with deal with inflammation and relieving of</v>

4160
01:57:01.891 --> 01:57:02.701
<v Speaker 2>pressure.</v>

4161
01:57:02.701 --> 01:57:07.701
<v Speaker 2>And for a lot of people it's good you guys still held up on your,</v>

4162
01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:09.333
<v Speaker 2>I hate that.</v>

4163
01:57:09.550 --> 01:57:10.410
<v Speaker 2>I forget it.</v>

4164
01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:11.040
<v Speaker 2>It's over.</v>

4165
01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:11.880
<v Speaker 2>Let it go.</v>

4166
01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:12.601
<v Speaker 2>Short memory.</v>

4167
01:57:12.601 --> 01:57:13.410
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

4168
01:57:13.410 --> 01:57:15.120
<v Speaker 2>I got some good details there later.</v>

4169
01:57:15.121 --> 01:57:16.590
<v Speaker 2>They come up with me when I need them.</v>

4170
01:57:16.591 --> 01:57:17.340
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

4171
01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:18.060
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

4172
01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:20.190
<v Speaker 2>it's a carry garbage around in your head all day.</v>

4173
01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:22.230
<v Speaker 2>Father knows best shit is what it is.</v>

4174
01:57:22.470 --> 01:57:22.711
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4175
01:57:22.711 --> 01:57:24.000
<v Speaker 2>we're watching leave it to beaver.</v>

4176
01:57:24.150 --> 01:57:25.140
<v Speaker 2>We just watching a,</v>

4177
01:57:25.150 --> 01:57:25.983
<v Speaker 2>a less,</v>

4178
01:57:26.610 --> 01:57:28.680
<v Speaker 2>less like ridiculous form of it.</v>

4179
01:57:28.710 --> 01:57:30.270
<v Speaker 2>It's a more modern person,</v>

4180
01:57:31.050 --> 01:57:33.240
<v Speaker 2>incorrect moral value on you.</v>

4181
01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:37.740
<v Speaker 2>They've decided what is right and what's wrong without having enough information</v>

4182
01:57:37.741 --> 01:57:42.741
<v Speaker 2>to even have a valid perspective with the gall of a man to say that another man</v>

4183
01:57:43.561 --> 01:57:48.240
<v Speaker 2>should not be able to legally buy something as innocuous as marijuana is.</v>

4184
01:57:48.241 --> 01:57:51.240
<v Speaker 2>So enraging who the fuck are,</v>

4185
01:57:51.241 --> 01:57:54.390
<v Speaker 2>you can't smoke a joint somewhere by herself.</v>

4186
01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:57.150
<v Speaker 2>Especially a person who placates themselves.</v>

4187
01:57:57.151 --> 01:57:58.260
<v Speaker 2>Obviously you're not,</v>

4188
01:57:58.290 --> 01:57:58.710
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

4189
01:57:58.710 --> 01:58:01.020
<v Speaker 2>you're not some militant fucking like the,</v>

4190
01:58:01.021 --> 01:58:01.261
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4191
01:58:01.261 --> 01:58:01.401
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4192
01:58:01.401 --> 01:58:04.080
<v Speaker 2>the gunny and full metal jacket placate,</v>

4193
01:58:04.290 --> 01:58:05.123
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that word.</v>

4194
01:58:05.150 --> 01:58:05.830
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4195
01:58:05.830 --> 01:58:06.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4196
01:58:07.100 --> 01:58:08.490
<v Speaker 2>what's the best way to describe placate,</v>

4197
01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:09.001
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4198
01:58:09.001 --> 01:58:09.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4199
01:58:09.450 --> 01:58:11.280
<v Speaker 2>to make someone believe it.</v>

4200
01:58:11.670 --> 01:58:12.960
<v Speaker 2>Pretend like you're that way.</v>

4201
01:58:13.260 --> 01:58:13.650
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4202
01:58:13.650 --> 01:58:14.760
<v Speaker 2>to try to here,</v>

4203
01:58:14.790 --> 01:58:16.830
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you a pro to make someone less angry.</v>

4204
01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:21.480
<v Speaker 2>I think it's based on placid to try to calm me down.</v>

4205
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:21.721
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

4206
01:58:21.721 --> 01:58:21.901
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

4207
01:58:21.901 --> 01:58:22.051
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

4208
01:58:22.051 --> 01:58:22.231
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

4209
01:58:22.231 --> 01:58:22.560
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4210
01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

4211
01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:24.060
<v Speaker 2>I just lost my train of thought.</v>

4212
01:58:24.260 --> 01:58:24.661
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

4213
01:58:24.661 --> 01:58:27.510
<v Speaker 2>I have a limited vocabulary in certain areas that you don't though.</v>

4214
01:58:27.511 --> 01:58:27.910
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

4215
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:30.510
<v Speaker 2>you have a very high technological vocabulary.</v>

4216
01:58:30.511 --> 01:58:31.420
<v Speaker 2>I like to ask questions.</v>

4217
01:58:31.490 --> 01:58:34.110
<v Speaker 2>So now I have that word in my repertoire as well.</v>

4218
01:58:34.111 --> 01:58:34.944
<v Speaker 2>So placate,</v>

4219
01:58:34.980 --> 01:58:35.910
<v Speaker 2>placate the masses.</v>

4220
01:58:35.911 --> 01:58:36.810
<v Speaker 2>You know that expression,</v>

4221
01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:38.040
<v Speaker 2>you've heard the expression a calm,</v>

4222
01:58:38.041 --> 01:58:38.490
<v Speaker 2>that acid.</v>

4223
01:58:38.490 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 2>I think I've heard the word never understood.</v>

4224
01:58:41.981 --> 01:58:42.814
<v Speaker 2>What was I saying now?</v>

4225
01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:45.490
<v Speaker 2>What was I saying about the people in the Oh,</v>

4226
01:58:45.540 --> 01:58:46.660
<v Speaker 2>that he placates his body.</v>

4227
01:58:46.661 --> 01:58:49.120
<v Speaker 2>He con he obviously he gives into his urges.</v>

4228
01:58:49.300 --> 01:58:50.133
<v Speaker 2>In order to,</v>

4229
01:58:50.530 --> 01:58:51.850
<v Speaker 2>in order to be that big,</v>

4230
01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:52.713
<v Speaker 2>you have to be indulgent.</v>

4231
01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:53.411
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no way.</v>

4232
01:58:53.411 --> 01:58:54.310
<v Speaker 2>So he's got issues.</v>

4233
01:58:54.490 --> 01:58:57.460
<v Speaker 2>So anybody that's got like some obvious issue like that like,</v>

4234
01:58:57.461 --> 01:58:57.671
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4235
01:58:57.671 --> 01:58:59.050
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to dictate health.</v>

4236
01:58:59.051 --> 01:58:59.510
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

4237
01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.930
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4238
01:58:59.930 --> 01:59:00.270
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4239
01:59:00.270 --> 01:59:03.480
<v Speaker 2>and like consumption policy theory yeah.</v>

4240
01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:05.500
<v Speaker 2>Is Poor.</v>

4241
01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:05.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4242
01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:06.540
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>

4243
01:59:06.540 --> 01:59:07.960
<v Speaker 2>It's control on yourself.</v>

4244
01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:10.660
<v Speaker 2>It's also against the current data.</v>

4245
01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:11.440
<v Speaker 2>Like there's,</v>

4246
01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:12.100
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

4247
01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:17.100
<v Speaker 2>there's no like real consensus that shows any sort of significant dangers</v>

4248
01:59:17.531 --> 01:59:19.450
<v Speaker 2>involved in the consumption of that plant.</v>

4249
01:59:20.050 --> 01:59:23.710
<v Speaker 2>Certainly not like some of these other ones that have how many dead this year</v>

4250
01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:24.130
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

4251
01:59:24.130 --> 01:59:26.350
<v Speaker 2>But you know why those other ones are fine too.</v>

4252
01:59:26.351 --> 01:59:28.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a problem either being around,</v>

4253
01:59:28.271 --> 01:59:29.830
<v Speaker 2>but aspirin will fuck you up.</v>

4254
01:59:29.960 --> 01:59:30.910
<v Speaker 2>You get crazy with it.</v>

4255
01:59:30.930 --> 01:59:31.763
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4256
01:59:31.810 --> 01:59:32.770
<v Speaker 2>you're your own,</v>

4257
01:59:32.990 --> 01:59:33.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4258
01:59:33.380 --> 01:59:34.420
<v Speaker 2>your own architect.</v>

4259
01:59:34.421 --> 01:59:35.254
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4260
01:59:35.260 --> 01:59:37.120
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people die every year from aspirin.</v>

4261
01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Aspirin kills people.</v>

4262
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:39.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4263
01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:40.810
<v Speaker 2>nobody wants to think about that.</v>

4264
01:59:40.811 --> 01:59:42.820
<v Speaker 2>But people can die from a lot of dumb shit.</v>

4265
01:59:43.330 --> 01:59:44.440
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

4266
01:59:44.441 --> 01:59:45.640
<v Speaker 2>It's available everywhere.</v>

4267
01:59:45.790 --> 01:59:48.760
<v Speaker 2>It's not w our issue is education and honesty.</v>

4268
01:59:48.761 --> 01:59:51.700
<v Speaker 2>And if you're not honest about something as innocuous as marijuana,</v>

4269
01:59:52.150 --> 01:59:54.550
<v Speaker 2>then why am I going to trust you about anything else?</v>

4270
01:59:54.700 --> 01:59:55.533
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

4271
01:59:55.570 --> 01:59:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Where's the dangerous shit?</v>

4272
01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:57.161
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

4273
01:59:57.161 --> 01:59:57.994
<v Speaker 2>W Oh,</v>

4274
01:59:58.110 --> 01:59:58.400
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

4275
01:59:58.400 --> 02:00:01.270
<v Speaker 2>we're keeping that legal because it's always been legal.</v>

4276
02:00:01.390 --> 02:00:01.521
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4277
02:00:01.521 --> 02:00:03.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you should make that illegal,</v>

4278
02:00:03.011 --> 02:00:06.370
<v Speaker 2>but you got to let the less dangerous shit into this is what if the less</v>

4279
02:00:06.371 --> 02:00:08.710
<v Speaker 2>dangerous shit changes the way people look at everything,</v>

4280
02:00:08.830 --> 02:00:10.210
<v Speaker 2>including the dangerous shit.</v>

4281
02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4282
02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:11.380
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

4283
02:00:11.380 --> 02:00:14.110
<v Speaker 2>that's a real possibility that psychedelic software have to a lot of people that</v>

4284
02:00:14.111 --> 02:00:15.400
<v Speaker 2>are addicted to diseases.</v>

4285
02:00:16.030 --> 02:00:18.280
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people that have PTSD,</v>

4286
02:00:18.281 --> 02:00:19.330
<v Speaker 2>they're addicted to diseases,</v>

4287
02:00:19.331 --> 02:00:21.820
<v Speaker 2>have had extreme benefits from psychedelics.</v>

4288
02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:24.640
<v Speaker 2>There's legal crash,</v>

4289
02:00:24.670 --> 02:00:25.181
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

4290
02:00:25.181 --> 02:00:26.014
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4291
02:00:26.370 --> 02:00:26.630
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

4292
02:00:26.630 --> 02:00:26.970
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>

4293
02:00:26.970 --> 02:00:27.920
<v Speaker 2>like I told us in the beginning,</v>

4294
02:00:27.940 --> 02:00:28.511
<v Speaker 2>this was my mom,</v>

4295
02:00:28.511 --> 02:00:28.810
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

4296
02:00:28.810 --> 02:00:29.020
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4297
02:00:29.020 --> 02:00:30.150
<v Speaker 2>so what does that mean?</v>

4298
02:00:30.151 --> 02:00:31.310
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't even understand what that is.</v>

4299
02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:32.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm ranting too much.</v>

4300
02:00:32.290 --> 02:00:32.561
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>

4301
02:00:32.561 --> 02:00:35.200
<v Speaker 2>I just get upset and I apologize anybody's heard this before,</v>

4302
02:00:35.650 --> 02:00:35.951
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

4303
02:00:35.951 --> 02:00:36.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4304
02:00:36.150 --> 02:00:36.331
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4305
02:00:36.331 --> 02:00:37.001
<v Speaker 2>I can't help it.</v>

4306
02:00:37.001 --> 02:00:41.230
<v Speaker 2>At certain point in time it hits me and I'm so confused by it.</v>

4307
02:00:41.231 --> 02:00:43.330
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I need to repeat it because it's so,</v>

4308
02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:43.960
<v Speaker 2>it's sucks.</v>

4309
02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:45.940
<v Speaker 2>It's the worst part of where we're at.</v>

4310
02:00:45.970 --> 02:00:46.950
<v Speaker 2>It's a bottleneck.</v>

4311
02:00:47.370 --> 02:00:50.950
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the worst parts is this lack of understanding about what should and</v>

4312
02:00:50.951 --> 02:00:52.390
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be happening to us.</v>

4313
02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's our government committing to wars or whether it's the people's</v>

4314
02:00:57.430 --> 02:01:02.320
<v Speaker 2>emails being spied upon or whether it's people being forced to not consume</v>

4315
02:01:02.321 --> 02:01:07.321
<v Speaker 2>certain things that would offer different perspectives or people being morality.</v>

4316
02:01:07.690 --> 02:01:08.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4317
02:01:08.021 --> 02:01:08.590
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

4318
02:01:08.590 --> 02:01:12.430
<v Speaker 2>people telling you what you can and can't do that's not hurting anybody else.</v>

4319
02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:18.120
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the things that I'm attracted to is altering the,</v>

4320
02:01:19.140 --> 02:01:22.600
<v Speaker 2>the current way that I think and altering the current way that other people</v>

4321
02:01:22.601 --> 02:01:25.060
<v Speaker 2>think and giving you a perspective of,</v>

4322
02:01:25.330 --> 02:01:27.070
<v Speaker 2>of the paths that we just get on.</v>

4323
02:01:27.071 --> 02:01:31.450
<v Speaker 2>We get stuck in these fucking grooves and it's so easy to keep making those same</v>

4324
02:01:31.451 --> 02:01:35.710
<v Speaker 2>terms over and over again whenever you hit these very similar moments in your</v>

4325
02:01:35.711 --> 02:01:36.480
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

4326
02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:40.250
<v Speaker 2>And that's where something like the isolation tank is so good.</v>

4327
02:01:40.670 --> 02:01:42.710
<v Speaker 1>It's so good to just get out of that groove.</v>

4328
02:01:43.150 --> 02:01:43.541
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

4329
02:01:43.541 --> 02:01:44.290
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

4330
02:01:44.290 --> 02:01:44.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4331
02:01:44.900 --> 02:01:45.490
<v Speaker 4>like a log.</v>

4332
02:01:45.490 --> 02:01:47.320
<v Speaker 4>It's even when I met you and everything like that.</v>

4333
02:01:47.321 --> 02:01:47.890
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4334
02:01:47.890 --> 02:01:48.723
<v Speaker 4>I think I went to,</v>

4335
02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I'd just gotten back from Costa Rica or somebody might say,</v>

4336
02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:52.510
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>

4337
02:01:52.510 --> 02:01:52.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4338
02:01:52.690 --> 02:01:53.770
<v Speaker 4>this isn't ever going to happen.</v>

4339
02:01:53.830 --> 02:01:55.810
<v Speaker 4>It's just people are never going to get with this.</v>

4340
02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:57.370
<v Speaker 4>And then because it was just,</v>

4341
02:01:57.371 --> 02:01:58.420
<v Speaker 4>you kept trying and now,</v>

4342
02:01:58.780 --> 02:02:03.780
<v Speaker 4>but now it seems as if these people in general have gotten up to a place where</v>

4343
02:02:04.490 --> 02:02:07.430
<v Speaker 4>they're more willing to uh,</v>

4344
02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:10.000
<v Speaker 4>experience themselves and then,</v>

4345
02:02:10.001 --> 02:02:10.834
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4346
02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:12.340
<v Speaker 4>make action on that.</v>

4347
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:13.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4348
02:02:13.221 --> 02:02:13.731
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

4349
02:02:13.731 --> 02:02:14.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4350
02:02:14.090 --> 02:02:14.990
<v Speaker 1>I think we're,</v>

4351
02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:16.670
<v Speaker 1>people are waking up with a lot things.</v>

4352
02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:19.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean you were talking about earlier about pilates and yoga.</v>

4353
02:02:19.431 --> 02:02:21.590
<v Speaker 1>I think people are just waking up about their body.</v>

4354
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:24.680
<v Speaker 1>People were really concerned about where their food's coming from.</v>

4355
02:02:24.681 --> 02:02:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Now this is something that hadn't really existed decades ago.</v>

4356
02:02:28.071 --> 02:02:30.170
<v Speaker 1>No one was concerned about organics or you know,</v>

4357
02:02:30.190 --> 02:02:30.810
<v Speaker 1>when one was current,</v>

4358
02:02:30.810 --> 02:02:34.400
<v Speaker 1>concerned about GMOs products in general.</v>

4359
02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Is this the fact that I don't,</v>

4360
02:02:35.511 --> 02:02:38.720
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not necessarily saying that Gmos were all bad because I don't think they</v>

4361
02:02:38.721 --> 02:02:39.070
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

4362
02:02:39.070 --> 02:02:39.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4363
02:02:39.230 --> 02:02:40.810
<v Speaker 1>I think there's definitely some benefits to,</v>

4364
02:02:40.811 --> 02:02:41.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4365
02:02:41.170 --> 02:02:43.790
<v Speaker 1>to some genetically modified organisms.</v>

4366
02:02:43.791 --> 02:02:47.030
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's important that we have the conversations that people who are</v>

4367
02:02:47.031 --> 02:02:52.031
<v Speaker 1>really intelligent start dedicating time and effort to researching the benefits,</v>

4368
02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:52.851
<v Speaker 1>pros and cons,</v>

4369
02:02:52.851 --> 02:02:56.660
<v Speaker 1>and then relaying that information back to the people relaying it back to the</v>

4370
02:02:56.661 --> 02:02:58.190
<v Speaker 1>public so we know what we're in for.</v>

4371
02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:00.740
<v Speaker 1>But then money gets involved in those things and that's what people are</v>

4372
02:03:00.741 --> 02:03:01.574
<v Speaker 1>concerned about.</v>

4373
02:03:02.060 --> 02:03:02.730
<v Speaker 1>The outcome</v>

4374
02:03:02.730 --> 02:03:03.780
<v Speaker 4>and then what you see,</v>

4375
02:03:03.781 --> 02:03:05.910
<v Speaker 4>you don't even know if it was the uh,</v>

4376
02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:07.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4377
02:03:07.550 --> 02:03:11.930
<v Speaker 1>but it also snaps people back and makes them more involved in growing their own</v>

4378
02:03:11.931 --> 02:03:13.970
<v Speaker 1>food and more interested in organic gardens.</v>

4379
02:03:13.971 --> 02:03:16.790
<v Speaker 1>And you've seen a lot of farmers' markets that are popping up left and right.</v>

4380
02:03:17.090 --> 02:03:18.710
<v Speaker 1>I think farmer's markets are amazing.</v>

4381
02:03:18.980 --> 02:03:19.521
<v Speaker 1>You go there,</v>

4382
02:03:19.521 --> 02:03:22.280
<v Speaker 1>you get a direct connection with the guy who actually grows the food.</v>

4383
02:03:22.281 --> 02:03:24.680
<v Speaker 1>This is the woman who actually milks these cows.</v>

4384
02:03:24.681 --> 02:03:27.260
<v Speaker 1>This is the guy that actually picks this salary.</v>

4385
02:03:27.261 --> 02:03:28.100
<v Speaker 1>He's right there.</v>

4386
02:03:28.190 --> 02:03:28.681
<v Speaker 1>This is their,</v>

4387
02:03:28.681 --> 02:03:29.720
<v Speaker 1>their special tomatoes.</v>

4388
02:03:29.721 --> 02:03:30.710
<v Speaker 1>They have heirloom tomatoes.</v>

4389
02:03:30.711 --> 02:03:31.820
<v Speaker 1>You get to meet these people.</v>

4390
02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:32.271
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4391
02:03:32.271 --> 02:03:35.720
<v Speaker 1>I think that is that that sort of connection is exciting to people and that's</v>

4392
02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:39.260
<v Speaker 1>the blow back away from a lot of the other stuff.</v>

4393
02:03:39.261 --> 02:03:42.740
<v Speaker 1>But it's all because we're getting this information and we get to this and</v>

4394
02:03:42.741 --> 02:03:42.980
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

4395
02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:45.470
<v Speaker 1>we're able to make all the decisions kind of appealing.</v>

4396
02:03:45.770 --> 02:03:47.870
<v Speaker 1>Maybe years ago you really don't want to meet the farmer,</v>

4397
02:03:47.871 --> 02:03:49.670
<v Speaker 1>you don't really don't care where it's tomato came from.</v>

4398
02:03:49.940 --> 02:03:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Now it's kind of like more interesting</v>

4399
02:03:52.710 --> 02:03:53.730
<v Speaker 4>to understand,</v>

4400
02:03:53.731 --> 02:03:54.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4401
02:03:54.031 --> 02:03:54.241
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4402
02:03:54.241 --> 02:03:54.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4403
02:03:54.960 --> 02:03:55.920
<v Speaker 4>the orientation,</v>

4404
02:03:55.921 --> 02:03:56.221
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4405
02:03:56.221 --> 02:03:56.380
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

4406
02:03:56.380 --> 02:03:58.470
<v Speaker 4>how it's happening or you know,</v>

4407
02:03:58.530 --> 02:03:59.610
<v Speaker 4>what's going on.</v>

4408
02:03:59.700 --> 02:04:00.470
<v Speaker 4>People are more,</v>

4409
02:04:00.470 --> 02:04:03.040
<v Speaker 4>more like the spray on them that they're the roundup.</v>

4410
02:04:03.050 --> 02:04:03.980
<v Speaker 4>And then like I said,</v>

4411
02:04:04.090 --> 02:04:04.923
<v Speaker 4>if you know,</v>

4412
02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:05.940
<v Speaker 4>people back,</v>

4413
02:04:05.940 --> 02:04:06.421
<v Speaker 4>they just,</v>

4414
02:04:06.421 --> 02:04:08.640
<v Speaker 4>stuff just happened and they really weren't,</v>

4415
02:04:08.850 --> 02:04:09.331
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4416
02:04:09.331 --> 02:04:10.164
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4417
02:04:10.730 --> 02:04:11.310
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4418
02:04:11.310 --> 02:04:11.850
<v Speaker 1>There were certain,</v>

4419
02:04:11.850 --> 02:04:15.160
<v Speaker 1>there was just caught up in whatever was going on because they didn't have a way</v>

4420
02:04:15.161 --> 02:04:16.150
<v Speaker 1>of communicating about it.</v>

4421
02:04:16.151 --> 02:04:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Like we have to the Internet,</v>

4422
02:04:17.561 --> 02:04:17.921
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

4423
02:04:17.921 --> 02:04:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Someone,</v>

4424
02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:18.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4425
02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:22.120
<v Speaker 1>someone could put up a blog about here's the dangers of this particular</v>

4426
02:04:22.121 --> 02:04:23.740
<v Speaker 1>pesticide on your tomatoes.</v>

4427
02:04:24.010 --> 02:04:25.330
<v Speaker 1>And then you hear about that and you go,</v>

4428
02:04:25.331 --> 02:04:25.800
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

4429
02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:28.180
<v Speaker 1>that that is not good and that's real.</v>

4430
02:04:28.181 --> 02:04:29.830
<v Speaker 1>The pesticides kill bugs.</v>

4431
02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Why do they kill bugs?</v>

4432
02:04:30.941 --> 02:04:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Cause they're fucking poison.</v>

4433
02:04:32.350 --> 02:04:32.651
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

4434
02:04:32.651 --> 02:04:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Why those plants not getting poisoned?</v>

4435
02:04:34.181 --> 02:04:34.691
<v Speaker 1>Well they are,</v>

4436
02:04:34.691 --> 02:04:35.890
<v Speaker 1>but just not enough to kill him.</v>

4437
02:04:36.140 --> 02:04:36.973
<v Speaker 1>They figured out a way,</v>

4438
02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:37.640
<v Speaker 1>make a whole,</v>

4439
02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:38.130
<v Speaker 1>it's one</v>

4440
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:38.990
<v Speaker 5>day and I'm in there.</v>

4441
02:04:39.010 --> 02:04:41.040
<v Speaker 5>This guy was in there spraying this stuff,</v>

4442
02:04:41.041 --> 02:04:41.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4443
02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:42.121
<v Speaker 5>I said to him,</v>

4444
02:04:42.121 --> 02:04:42.301
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

4445
02:04:42.301 --> 02:04:42.421
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

4446
02:04:42.421 --> 02:04:45.930
<v Speaker 5>what's this conventional grown or a organically grown?</v>

4447
02:04:45.931 --> 02:04:46.121
<v Speaker 5>What,</v>

4448
02:04:46.121 --> 02:04:46.800
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

4449
02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:47.580
<v Speaker 5>What does that mean?</v>

4450
02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:47.941
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

4451
02:04:47.941 --> 02:04:48.301
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4452
02:04:48.301 --> 02:04:48.571
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>

4453
02:04:48.571 --> 02:04:48.840
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4454
02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:49.920
<v Speaker 5>I guess if it's organic,</v>

4455
02:04:49.921 --> 02:04:51.000
<v Speaker 5>it's done without poison.</v>

4456
02:04:51.770 --> 02:04:52.340
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>

4457
02:04:52.340 --> 02:04:53.050
<v Speaker 5>Huh,</v>

4458
02:04:53.050 --> 02:04:53.883
<v Speaker 5>all right.</v>

4459
02:04:53.970 --> 02:04:55.140
<v Speaker 5>So the conventional and means,</v>

4460
02:04:55.141 --> 02:04:56.010
<v Speaker 5>is that like a with it a,</v>

4461
02:04:56.011 --> 02:04:57.750
<v Speaker 5>a poisonous substance in order to,</v>

4462
02:04:57.780 --> 02:04:58.030
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4463
02:04:58.030 --> 02:04:58.351
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

4464
02:04:58.351 --> 02:05:01.680
<v Speaker 5>let's find out about that because I've always wanted to know what is the</v>

4465
02:05:01.681 --> 02:05:03.840
<v Speaker 5>official description,</v>

4466
02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:05.850
<v Speaker 5>what is the official definition of organic?</v>

4467
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:06.201
<v Speaker 5>Like I said,</v>

4468
02:05:06.201 --> 02:05:08.280
<v Speaker 5>I got this from the clean up food and I thought,</v>

4469
02:05:08.290 --> 02:05:09.123
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

4470
02:05:09.390 --> 02:05:10.590
<v Speaker 5>he didn't seem to be a scientist.</v>

4471
02:05:10.591 --> 02:05:12.030
<v Speaker 5>But that seems to make a lot of sense.</v>

4472
02:05:12.510 --> 02:05:13.980
<v Speaker 5>Let's look into Wikipedia.</v>

4473
02:05:14.010 --> 02:05:15.400
<v Speaker 5>This is organic foods</v>

4474
02:05:15.590 --> 02:05:18.530
<v Speaker 1>are produced using methods of organic farming.</v>

4475
02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Currently Baba Baba Baba Baba requires countries require producers tubes to</v>

4476
02:05:24.680 --> 02:05:28.970
<v Speaker 1>obtain special certification or to to market food as organic within their</v>

4477
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:30.103
<v Speaker 1>borders.</v>

4478
02:05:30.130 --> 02:05:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4479
02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:31.670
<v Speaker 1>the context of these regulations,</v>

4480
02:05:31.671 --> 02:05:36.380
<v Speaker 1>organic food is food produced in a way that complies with organic standards that</v>

4481
02:05:36.381 --> 02:05:37.280
<v Speaker 1>keeps saying nothing here.</v>

4482
02:05:37.310 --> 02:05:38.051
<v Speaker 1>What's organic there?</v>

4483
02:05:38.051 --> 02:05:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Wake up,</v>

4484
02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:38.511
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

4485
02:05:38.511 --> 02:05:38.840
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

4486
02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:42.470
<v Speaker 1>Janica while the organic standard is defined differently in different</v>

4487
02:05:42.471 --> 02:05:43.304
<v Speaker 1>jurisdictions.</v>

4488
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4489
02:05:43.700 --> 02:05:44.300
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

4490
02:05:44.300 --> 02:05:44.931
<v Speaker 1>In general,</v>

4491
02:05:44.931 --> 02:05:48.710
<v Speaker 1>organic farming response to site specifics,</v>

4492
02:05:48.740 --> 02:05:52.430
<v Speaker 1>farming and crop conditions by integrating cultural,</v>

4493
02:05:52.431 --> 02:05:57.431
<v Speaker 1>biological and mechanical practices that foster cycling of resources promote</v>

4494
02:05:58.161 --> 02:06:01.010
<v Speaker 1>ecological balance and concern biodiversity.</v>

4495
02:06:01.011 --> 02:06:01.844
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

4496
02:06:01.850 --> 02:06:02.151
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4497
02:06:02.151 --> 02:06:05.510
<v Speaker 1>Synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers are not allowed,</v>

4498
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:10.520
<v Speaker 1>although certain organically approved pesticides may be used under limited</v>

4499
02:06:10.521 --> 02:06:11.480
<v Speaker 1>conditions in general,</v>

4500
02:06:11.481 --> 02:06:15.110
<v Speaker 1>organic foods are not processed using irradiation,</v>

4501
02:06:15.260 --> 02:06:18.440
<v Speaker 1>industrial solvents or chemical food additives.</v>

4502
02:06:19.250 --> 02:06:20.360
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know the first part though.</v>

4503
02:06:20.361 --> 02:06:23.000
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it was defined by a cycling.</v>

4504
02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:23.661
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4505
02:06:23.661 --> 02:06:26.270
<v Speaker 1>the conditions cycling of re</v>

4506
02:06:26.530 --> 02:06:27.280
<v Speaker 5>resources,</v>

4507
02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:28.120
<v Speaker 5>what they need to do,</v>

4508
02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:32.920
<v Speaker 5>the nutrients in the soil there.</v>

4509
02:06:33.150 --> 02:06:33.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4510
02:06:33.511 --> 02:06:33.791
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

4511
02:06:33.791 --> 02:06:35.220
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the most difficult things.</v>

4512
02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Representation I guess is a crop rotation.</v>

4513
02:06:38.191 --> 02:06:38.851
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>

4514
02:06:38.851 --> 02:06:39.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4515
02:06:39.121 --> 02:06:44.070
<v Speaker 1>when you have enormous chunks of land that are just dedicated entirely to corn</v>

4516
02:06:44.071 --> 02:06:45.690
<v Speaker 1>or entirely to this are entirely to that.</v>

4517
02:06:45.990 --> 02:06:46.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4518
02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:49.800
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times those farmlands become minerally deficient and they have to</v>

4519
02:06:49.801 --> 02:06:52.440
<v Speaker 1>actually add minerals to the ground in order to,</v>

4520
02:06:52.441 --> 02:06:53.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4521
02:06:53.100 --> 02:06:55.020
<v Speaker 1>I think they would use in the old days,</v>

4522
02:06:55.021 --> 02:06:57.780
<v Speaker 1>like they would use like fish and stuff like that to try to replenish their</v>

4523
02:06:57.781 --> 02:06:59.820
<v Speaker 1>garden fishes apparently really good for that.</v>

4524
02:07:00.390 --> 02:07:01.223
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

4525
02:07:01.260 --> 02:07:01.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4526
02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:02.573
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4527
02:07:02.610 --> 02:07:03.540
<v Speaker 1>the idea that,</v>

4528
02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:06.540
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird thing to want something to be organic.</v>

4529
02:07:06.630 --> 02:07:08.490
<v Speaker 1>I think you gotta you gotta ask for that.</v>

4530
02:07:08.491 --> 02:07:08.731
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4531
02:07:08.731 --> 02:07:10.800
<v Speaker 1>how did you allow people to pour poison on,</v>

4532
02:07:10.810 --> 02:07:11.643
<v Speaker 1>on food?</v>

4533
02:07:11.850 --> 02:07:13.050
<v Speaker 1>How'd you allow people to grow?</v>

4534
02:07:13.080 --> 02:07:13.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4535
02:07:13.620 --> 02:07:15.390
<v Speaker 1>isn't there another way to deal with those bugs?</v>

4536
02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Can you like hire someone to clean the bugs off and you have to fucking spray</v>

4537
02:07:19.470 --> 02:07:20.670
<v Speaker 1>death from the sky?</v>

4538
02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:21.900
<v Speaker 1>It sounds ridiculous.</v>

4539
02:07:21.901 --> 02:07:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Like my,</v>

4540
02:07:22.540 --> 02:07:24.150
<v Speaker 1>my version of it sounds ridiculous.</v>

4541
02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Birds and animals.</v>

4542
02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Birds eat all the corn too though,</v>

4543
02:07:28.261 --> 02:07:29.094
<v Speaker 1>don't they?</v>

4544
02:07:30.210 --> 02:07:30.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4545
02:07:30.870 --> 02:07:31.703
<v Speaker 1>Animals do.</v>

4546
02:07:32.650 --> 02:07:33.070
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

4547
02:07:33.070 --> 02:07:33.903
<v Speaker 1>He'd say,</v>

4548
02:07:34.160 --> 02:07:34.350
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4549
02:07:34.350 --> 02:07:34.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4550
02:07:34.591 --> 02:07:36.700
<v Speaker 1>I was watching some show the other day on the history channel.</v>

4551
02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:37.900
<v Speaker 1>It was actually about history,</v>

4552
02:07:37.930 --> 02:07:40.450
<v Speaker 1>which is hilarious because you watch the fucking history channel.</v>

4553
02:07:40.451 --> 02:07:42.250
<v Speaker 1>When was the last time you saw some shit about history?</v>

4554
02:07:42.610 --> 02:07:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4555
02:07:43.270 --> 02:07:43.751
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

4556
02:07:43.751 --> 02:07:47.050
<v Speaker 1>It's always like alligator farmers or something fucked up.</v>

4557
02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:48.970
<v Speaker 1>But it was a about locusts.</v>

4558
02:07:49.180 --> 02:07:49.931
<v Speaker 1>It was all about,</v>

4559
02:07:49.931 --> 02:07:50.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4560
02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:51.670
<v Speaker 1>the early 18 hundreds.</v>

4561
02:07:51.671 --> 02:07:56.410
<v Speaker 1>And these people were like a traveling across the United States setting up farms</v>

4562
02:07:56.411 --> 02:08:00.010
<v Speaker 1>and stuff and the locus hit these people's farms and they had to send in the</v>

4563
02:08:00.011 --> 02:08:02.410
<v Speaker 1>army to bring these people food mean these,</v>

4564
02:08:02.470 --> 02:08:03.430
<v Speaker 1>these grasshoppers.</v>

4565
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:05.260
<v Speaker 1>He's locusts were just,</v>

4566
02:08:05.261 --> 02:08:07.480
<v Speaker 1>they filled the sky for hours.</v>

4567
02:08:07.570 --> 02:08:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Like for hours and hours.</v>

4568
02:08:08.621 --> 02:08:12.040
<v Speaker 1>They filled the sky and just flew by and just destroyed everything.</v>

4569
02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Just tore through people's crops.</v>

4570
02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:15.460
<v Speaker 1>And they were talking about how big,</v>

4571
02:08:15.461 --> 02:08:16.111
<v Speaker 1>it must've been the,</v>

4572
02:08:16.111 --> 02:08:17.840
<v Speaker 1>the millions and millions of,</v>

4573
02:08:17.841 --> 02:08:19.960
<v Speaker 1>of bugs that must've been in the air.</v>

4574
02:08:20.230 --> 02:08:21.063
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4575
02:08:21.710 --> 02:08:22.480
<v Speaker 1>For the corn though,</v>

4576
02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:23.500
<v Speaker 1>they went straight for crops.</v>

4577
02:08:23.501 --> 02:08:25.330
<v Speaker 1>They just buzz through and killed everything.</v>

4578
02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:28.330
<v Speaker 1>They said you would see it as a storm cloud coming at you.</v>

4579
02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:31.300
<v Speaker 1>And then as you look down or looked up,</v>

4580
02:08:31.301 --> 02:08:31.630
<v Speaker 1>rather,</v>

4581
02:08:31.630 --> 02:08:34.810
<v Speaker 1>you would realize somewhere along the line to there wasn't a cloud that was a</v>

4582
02:08:34.811 --> 02:08:35.391
<v Speaker 1>storm.</v>

4583
02:08:35.391 --> 02:08:35.851
<v Speaker 1>It was cloud.</v>

4584
02:08:35.851 --> 02:08:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4585
02:08:36.130 --> 02:08:36.611
<v Speaker 1>Bugs.</v>

4586
02:08:36.611 --> 02:08:38.290
<v Speaker 1>Do they make a quickie sound or something?</v>

4587
02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Pull up,</v>

4588
02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:40.180
<v Speaker 1>pull up video of locusts.</v>

4589
02:08:40.210 --> 02:08:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Pull up some locust video from the,</v>

4590
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:43.623
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4591
02:08:43.930 --> 02:08:44.620
<v Speaker 1>whenever I'm like,</v>

4592
02:08:44.620 --> 02:08:46.120
<v Speaker 1>it's got a clicky sound when it's flying.</v>

4593
02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:46.631
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4594
02:08:46.631 --> 02:08:47.770
<v Speaker 1>I never been around locus.</v>

4595
02:08:47.770 --> 02:08:50.620
<v Speaker 1>I've been around grasshoppers and apparently they're in the grasshopper family.</v>

4596
02:08:50.621 --> 02:08:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4597
02:08:51.130 --> 02:08:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Where's this locus shallows.</v>

4598
02:08:52.571 --> 02:08:53.530
<v Speaker 1>That's so disgusting.</v>

4599
02:08:53.531 --> 02:08:56.700
<v Speaker 1>You would just like go outside and you'll just see this empty shell of what it</v>

4600
02:08:56.710 --> 02:08:58.090
<v Speaker 1>looks exactly like a locust.</v>

4601
02:08:58.150 --> 02:08:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

4602
02:08:58.680 --> 02:08:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Like the shell of it.</v>

4603
02:08:59.830 --> 02:09:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Just the outside of those things.</v>

4604
02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:02.200
<v Speaker 1>But if you've,</v>

4605
02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:03.033
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4606
02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:05.950
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever heard of like biblical predictions,</v>

4607
02:09:05.951 --> 02:09:10.870
<v Speaker 1>locus was involved in biblical predictions of apocalyptic conditions.</v>

4608
02:09:10.871 --> 02:09:11.051
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4609
02:09:11.051 --> 02:09:13.690
<v Speaker 1>they always talked about locus locus taking the sky.</v>

4610
02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:13.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4611
02:09:13.921 --> 02:09:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Like when you think about like old horror movies,</v>

4612
02:09:16.721 --> 02:09:16.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4613
02:09:16.961 --> 02:09:18.940
<v Speaker 1>like demonic possession things.</v>

4614
02:09:19.030 --> 02:09:21.190
<v Speaker 1>A plague of locusts hit Egypt this weekend,</v>

4615
02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:24.790
<v Speaker 1>causing some citizens to burn tires and attempt to ward them off.</v>

4616
02:09:25.130 --> 02:09:25.841
<v Speaker 1>That's when you know,</v>

4617
02:09:25.841 --> 02:09:27.160
<v Speaker 1>shit gets ugly.</v>

4618
02:09:27.370 --> 02:09:28.270
<v Speaker 1>30 tires,</v>

4619
02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:29.350
<v Speaker 1>burn tires,</v>

4620
02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:33.790
<v Speaker 1>swarm of locusts were spotted in several districts of Cairo on Saturday as they</v>

4621
02:09:33.791 --> 02:09:36.670
<v Speaker 1>invaded the Giza area of the Middle Eastern nations.</v>

4622
02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:36.911

4630
02:09:44.771 --> 02:09:45.604

4653
02:10:30.711 --> 02:10:31.610

<v Speaker 7>So many of them,</v>

4691

<v Speaker 7>Fucking goddamn storm.</v>

4694
02:11:49.810 --> 02:11:51.940
<v Speaker 7>You should be so psyched that people invented cars.</v>

4695
02:11:52.870 --> 02:11:54.040
<v Speaker 7>That's how you should feel right now.</v>

4696
02:11:54.041 --> 02:11:57.940
<v Speaker 7>You just feel like people are awesome cars vented</v>

4697
02:11:57.940 --> 02:11:59.100
<v Speaker 2>to protect us from locus.</v>

4698
02:11:59.570 --> 02:12:00.640
<v Speaker 2>That's what you should be thinking.</v>

4699
02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:01.450
<v Speaker 2>She'd be like,</v>

4700
02:12:01.450 --> 02:12:01.691
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4701
02:12:01.691 --> 02:12:02.524
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing.</v>

4702
02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:03.640
<v Speaker 2>Thank God they invested.</v>

4703
02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Pesticides are sprayed to the sky and knock those fuckers dead.</v>

4704
02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:11.140
<v Speaker 2>Can they do anything when,</v>

4705
02:12:11.170 --> 02:12:12.820
<v Speaker 2>when locusts come do you think?</v>

4706
02:12:12.821 --> 02:12:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Can they like throw nets up or anything?</v>

4707
02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:16.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4708
02:12:16.871 --> 02:12:17.290
<v Speaker 2>What did they,</v>

4709
02:12:17.290 --> 02:12:18.670
<v Speaker 2>how did they stop locusts?</v>

4710
02:12:18.790 --> 02:12:19.031
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4711
02:12:19.031 --> 02:12:19.840
<v Speaker 2>you do,</v>

4712
02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:24.160
<v Speaker 2>you get like a windmill with like a very large paddle and you just put in the</v>

4713
02:12:24.161 --> 02:12:24.941
<v Speaker 2>center of the town.</v>

4714
02:12:24.941 --> 02:12:25.774
<v Speaker 2>Just Swat.</v>

4715
02:12:26.770 --> 02:12:30.520
<v Speaker 2>Just smack them right in the face as they come in and just kill them all.</v>

4716
02:12:30.521 --> 02:12:34.300
<v Speaker 2>Eventually put a sheet down below so when you chop them up,</v>

4717
02:12:34.301 --> 02:12:36.070
<v Speaker 2>that's a good protein powder there.</v>

4718
02:12:36.250 --> 02:12:36.971
<v Speaker 2>It's very good for you.</v>

4719
02:12:36.971 --> 02:12:37.320
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4720
02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:38.410
<v Speaker 2>It's protein powder.</v>

4721
02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:41.440
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people eat bugs and other parts of the other parts of the world where</v>

4722
02:12:41.441 --> 02:12:43.450
<v Speaker 2>they have to and the tasty,</v>

4723
02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:45.550
<v Speaker 2>the locust crunchy.</v>

4724
02:12:45.870 --> 02:12:47.170
<v Speaker 2>You actually eat them?</v>

4725
02:12:47.410 --> 02:12:48.330
<v Speaker 2>Well no,</v>

4726
02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:49.630
<v Speaker 2>but what are you saying crash.</v>

4727
02:12:49.910 --> 02:12:50.743
<v Speaker 2>Remember these gifts?</v>

4728
02:12:50.770 --> 02:12:51.281
<v Speaker 2>It's all gone.</v>

4729
02:12:51.281 --> 02:12:52.930
<v Speaker 2>Rock candies.</v>

4730
02:12:52.990 --> 02:12:53.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4731
02:12:53.231 --> 02:12:54.160
<v Speaker 2>I never got a chart.</v>

4732
02:12:54.300 --> 02:12:55.133
<v Speaker 2>Grasshopper.</v>

4733
02:12:55.190 --> 02:12:56.023
<v Speaker 2>Grasshopper.</v>

4734
02:12:56.060 --> 02:12:57.540
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>

4735
02:12:57.590 --> 02:12:58.331
<v Speaker 2>I'd never tried it,</v>

4736
02:12:58.331 --> 02:13:00.510
<v Speaker 2>but they used to sell that shit at urban outfitters.</v>

4737
02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:01.300
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

4738
02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:02.630
<v Speaker 2>Urban outfitters sells locust.</v>

4739
02:13:02.631 --> 02:13:02.711
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4740
02:13:02.711 --> 02:13:04.180
<v Speaker 2>They said like these weird bugs,</v>

4741
02:13:04.181 --> 02:13:07.210
<v Speaker 2>they can just get chocolate and you answered their chocolate ants,</v>

4742
02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:08.110
<v Speaker 2>caterpillars.</v>

4743
02:13:08.170 --> 02:13:10.060
<v Speaker 2>The thing about chocolate answers,</v>

4744
02:13:10.510 --> 02:13:11.001
<v Speaker 2>you know they,</v>

4745
02:13:11.001 --> 02:13:12.070
<v Speaker 2>they're actually good for you.</v>

4746
02:13:12.071 --> 02:13:13.480
<v Speaker 2>Like answer actually good for you.</v>

4747
02:13:13.510 --> 02:13:16.380
<v Speaker 2>Like if as long as you're not poisoning ads when you're eating ants,</v>

4748
02:13:16.450 --> 02:13:17.740
<v Speaker 2>actually a good source of protein,</v>

4749
02:13:17.830 --> 02:13:19.900
<v Speaker 2>so it was a good source of protein covered in chocolate.</v>

4750
02:13:19.901 --> 02:13:20.711
<v Speaker 2>You kind of feel like,</v>

4751
02:13:20.711 --> 02:13:21.370
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4752
02:13:21.370 --> 02:13:22.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really eating candy,</v>

4753
02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:24.160
<v Speaker 2>but he's still eating candy.</v>

4754
02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:27.790
<v Speaker 2>I think we'd put the windmill up after they hit the corn field.</v>

4755
02:13:28.060 --> 02:13:29.350
<v Speaker 2>Then after all full of corn,</v>

4756
02:13:29.351 --> 02:13:29.741
<v Speaker 2>then we,</v>

4757
02:13:29.741 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 2>then we make them into the powder and then</v>

4758
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:33.430
<v Speaker 6>they have more nutritional value.</v>

4759
02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:33.641
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4760
02:13:33.641 --> 02:13:35.140
<v Speaker 1>I think even if you put the windmill up,</v>

4761
02:13:35.141 --> 02:13:37.090
<v Speaker 1>you'd only kill the ones that are near the windmill.</v>

4762
02:13:37.091 --> 02:13:39.730
<v Speaker 1>The ones underneath the windmill that they're like your height and my height.</v>

4763
02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:41.680
<v Speaker 1>It's they fly like an inch off the ground.</v>

4764
02:13:41.681 --> 02:13:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Those fuckers like they're everywhere.</v>

4765
02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Kamikazes yeah,</v>

4766
02:13:44.501 --> 02:13:45.430
<v Speaker 1>there's so many of them.</v>

4767
02:13:45.431 --> 02:13:46.270
<v Speaker 1>There's no room.</v>

4768
02:13:46.271 --> 02:13:48.210
<v Speaker 1>They can't all just be in the sky happen.</v>

4769
02:13:48.340 --> 02:13:49.390
<v Speaker 1>How do they all get born?</v>

4770
02:13:49.420 --> 02:13:50.231
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

4771
02:13:50.231 --> 02:13:52.990
<v Speaker 1>I think they fuck just to all of those at one time.</v>

4772
02:13:52.991 --> 02:13:53.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like I do,</v>

4773
02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:55.060
<v Speaker 1>it's called a cluster fuck.</v>

4774
02:13:57.610 --> 02:13:58.750
<v Speaker 1>The biblical cluster.</v>

4775
02:13:58.751 --> 02:13:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

4776
02:13:59.230 --> 02:14:00.063
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

4777
02:14:00.130 --> 02:14:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4778
02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:01.473
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4779
02:14:01.780 --> 02:14:02.380
<v Speaker 1>We're lucky.</v>

4780
02:14:02.380 --> 02:14:03.041
<v Speaker 1>We're very lucky.</v>

4781
02:14:03.041 --> 02:14:04.090
<v Speaker 1>Especially here in California.</v>

4782
02:14:04.091 --> 02:14:05.290
<v Speaker 1>We don't need to have mosquitoes.</v>

4783
02:14:05.291 --> 02:14:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

4784
02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:07.900
<v Speaker 1>You know I thought about that when I was up in Canada.</v>

4785
02:14:07.901 --> 02:14:08.640
<v Speaker 1>We have to,</v>

4786
02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:10.030
<v Speaker 1>they have a thing called Thermacell.</v>

4787
02:14:10.031 --> 02:14:11.140
<v Speaker 1>You ever heard of a Thermacell?</v>

4788
02:14:11.890 --> 02:14:12.551
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

4789
02:14:12.551 --> 02:14:16.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like got a compartment in it that you put like a a chemical and then you</v>

4790
02:14:16.211 --> 02:14:21.211
<v Speaker 1>turn these suckers on and then you put it down and this like mist comes out and</v>

4791
02:14:21.401 --> 02:14:22.540
<v Speaker 1>you can't smell it at all,</v>

4792
02:14:22.541 --> 02:14:24.580
<v Speaker 1>but the mosquitoes avoid you like the plague.</v>

4793
02:14:24.850 --> 02:14:29.850
<v Speaker 1>So we would sit down outside in the woods and it was really mosquito ridden.</v>

4794
02:14:29.950 --> 02:14:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Like immediately the mosquitoes come near and you're like,</v>

4795
02:14:31.901 --> 02:14:32.441
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

4796
02:14:32.441 --> 02:14:33.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I can do this.</v>

4797
02:14:33.510 --> 02:14:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Like this is rough.</v>

4798
02:14:34.420 --> 02:14:34.511
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4799
02:14:34.511 --> 02:14:36.130
<v Speaker 1>they were all over the world.</v>

4800
02:14:36.490 --> 02:14:38.080
<v Speaker 1>You put this Thermacell thing down,</v>

4801
02:14:38.170 --> 02:14:38.530
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

4802
02:14:38.530 --> 02:14:39.910
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes later they're gone.</v>

4803
02:14:40.060 --> 02:14:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Before that I got like a mask on ski mask and a hat and I got fucking gloves on.</v>

4804
02:14:43.991 --> 02:14:44.201
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

4805
02:14:44.201 --> 02:14:44.441
<v Speaker 1>cheese.</v>

4806
02:14:44.441 --> 02:14:45.730
<v Speaker 1>And they're trying to bite me through my glove.</v>

4807
02:14:45.731 --> 02:14:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Like you fuckers,</v>

4808
02:14:46.540 --> 02:14:47.373
<v Speaker 1>they're everywhere.</v>

4809
02:14:47.500 --> 02:14:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Participant in Thermacell,</v>

4810
02:14:48.551 --> 02:14:49.570
<v Speaker 1>you keep it on for 10 minutes.</v>

4811
02:14:49.630 --> 02:14:50.740
<v Speaker 1>There's no mosquitoes.</v>

4812
02:14:50.830 --> 02:14:51.330
<v Speaker 6>Boom.</v>

4813
02:14:51.330 --> 02:14:52.270
<v Speaker 6>You know what sucks is those,</v>

4814
02:14:52.271 --> 02:14:52.450
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4815
02:14:52.450 --> 02:14:56.170
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if they haven't been in Los Angeles is the Japanese beetles that in</v>

4816
02:14:56.171 --> 02:14:59.950
<v Speaker 6>the Midwest we used to get so many Japanese beetles that we'd have to have these</v>

4817
02:14:59.951 --> 02:15:04.390
<v Speaker 6>bags that you put in your front and back yard where the beetles will come in and</v>

4818
02:15:04.391 --> 02:15:05.470
<v Speaker 6>get collected in there.</v>

4819
02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:08.410
<v Speaker 6>You're just like every week you just have this humongous bag.</v>

4820
02:15:08.650 --> 02:15:10.600
<v Speaker 6>Just sweaty bugs.</v>

4821
02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:12.370
<v Speaker 6>We were trapping to throw it out.</v>

4822
02:15:12.470 --> 02:15:12.790
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4823
02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:13.630
<v Speaker 6>It's like a beetle.</v>

4824
02:15:13.631 --> 02:15:14.464
<v Speaker 6>A hotel.</v>

4825
02:15:14.490 --> 02:15:14.621
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4826
02:15:14.621 --> 02:15:15.454

02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:09.841

4902
02:17:22.250 --> 02:17:25.210
<v Speaker 2>on Kansas had this one in 1992,</v>

4903
02:17:25.270 --> 02:17:28.810
<v Speaker 2>two batches of severe thunderstorms for six hours.</v>

4904
02:17:29.230 --> 02:17:29.381
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4905
02:17:29.381 --> 02:17:34.381
<v Speaker 2>within six hours of either dumped hailstones up to four and a half inches across</v>

4906
02:17:34.931 --> 02:17:35.770
<v Speaker 2>this area,</v>

4907
02:17:35.950 --> 02:17:37.660
<v Speaker 2>including the city of Wichita,</v>

4908
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:41.500
<v Speaker 2>surrounding counties of South Central Kansas.</v>

4909
02:17:41.501 --> 02:17:43.930
<v Speaker 2>And over 10,000 homes were damaged.</v>

4910
02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:48.040
<v Speaker 2>The hail left wheat fields in a near total loss.</v>

4911
02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:53.280
<v Speaker 2>Property damage totaled $500 million with crop damage at 100 million and below.</v>

4912
02:17:54.710 --> 02:17:55.990
<v Speaker 2>How many people died though?</v>

4913
02:17:56.330 --> 02:17:57.280
<v Speaker 2>It can't find it.</v>

4914
02:17:57.530 --> 02:17:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Can't find.</v>

4915
02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:00.400
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that he'd be the first dummy that died from Hale.</v>

4916
02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:01.680
<v Speaker 2>They stay in when that stuff,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You're fine.</v>

4920
02:18:04.970 --> 02:18:06.340
<v Speaker 2>You're stuck a wheat.</v>

4921
02:18:06.620 --> 02:18:07.690
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't hurt that bad.</v>

4922
02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:08.320
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

4923
02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:09.310
<v Speaker 2>Hail Storm.</v>

02:18:11.830 --> 02:18:12.760
<v Speaker 2>Let's treat people die.</v>

4927
02:18:12.761 --> 02:18:13.780
<v Speaker 2>A year from Hale,</v>

4928
02:18:14.920 --> 02:18:17.920
<v Speaker 2>27 people died from tomato,</v>

4929
02:18:17.950 --> 02:18:21.100
<v Speaker 2>tornadoes and hailstorms in the Midwest.</v>

4930
02:18:25.150 --> 02:18:27.280
<v Speaker 2>What's that says here at 900 people a year?</v>

4931
02:18:27.650 --> 02:18:28.483
<v Speaker 2>Watts.</v>

4932
02:18:29.310 --> 02:18:30.670
<v Speaker 2>How many sets from the coconut again?</v>

4933
02:18:30.700 --> 02:18:31.210
<v Speaker 2>What'd you say?</v>

4934
02:18:31.210 --> 02:18:34.680
<v Speaker 2>One 50 150 shoes.</v>

4935
02:18:35.290 --> 02:18:36.160
<v Speaker 2>Where does it say that?</v>

4936
02:18:36.250 --> 02:18:37.420
<v Speaker 2>900 a year.</v>

4937
02:18:38.590 --> 02:18:40.240
<v Speaker 2>Where's it say that it just came up.</v>

4938
02:18:40.241 --> 02:18:43.720
<v Speaker 2>How many people die from hail and 900 a year?</v>

4939
02:18:43.810 --> 02:18:45.730
<v Speaker 2>It can be very dangerous thing.</v>

4940
02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:48.880
<v Speaker 2>Are there any instances of death?</v>

4941
02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:52.750
<v Speaker 2>There's only one here that says they know of of the United States.</v>

4942
02:18:53.080 --> 02:18:54.430
<v Speaker 2>1939 in Lubbock,</v>

4943
02:18:54.431 --> 02:18:54.911
<v Speaker 2>Texas,</v>

4944
02:18:54.911 --> 02:18:59.740
<v Speaker 2>a farmer got caught in an open field and died from a hail last name death.</v>

4945
02:18:59.800 --> 02:19:04.800
<v Speaker 2>Fort Collins and infant lying in its mother's arms was killed by hail in 1979</v>

4946
02:19:05.950 --> 02:19:06.751
<v Speaker 2>can you imagine that?</v>

4947
02:19:06.751 --> 02:19:09.400
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like lots and you could do,</v>

4948
02:19:09.401 --> 02:19:09.641
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4949
02:19:09.641 --> 02:19:12.550
<v Speaker 2>if you were caught in an open field and it started coming down hard,</v>

4950
02:19:13.070 --> 02:19:13.930
<v Speaker 2>kills your kid.</v>

4951
02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:14.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4952
02:19:14.530 --> 02:19:15.310
<v Speaker 2>that's gotta be the,</v>

4953
02:19:15.310 --> 02:19:16.150
<v Speaker 2>it's not many people,</v>

4954
02:19:16.151 --> 02:19:16.481
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4955
02:19:16.481 --> 02:19:18.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe it's 900 a year.</v>

4956
02:19:18.260 --> 02:19:22.240
<v Speaker 2>This actually says the last known death was caused by hail and the US was in the</v>

4957
02:19:22.241 --> 02:19:23.170
<v Speaker 2>year 2000.</v>

4958
02:19:24.460 --> 02:19:25.241
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

4959
02:19:25.241 --> 02:19:26.620
<v Speaker 2>It was 900 total.</v>

4960
02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:26.831
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

4962
02:19:27.261 --> 02:19:27.621
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

4963
02:19:27.621 --> 02:19:28.010
<v Speaker 2>people</v>

4964
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:31.820
<v Speaker 1>know so much about storms and if you live in an area where you might,</v>

4965
02:19:31.821 --> 02:19:32.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4966
02:19:32.031 --> 02:19:35.190
<v Speaker 1>you live in some Kansas type area where they have hailstorms on a regular basis,</v>

4967
02:19:35.250 --> 02:19:36.083
<v Speaker 1>get in.</v>

02:19:36.990 --> 02:19:38.450
<v Speaker 1>we'll get the car is getting pummeled.</v>

4970
02:19:38.540 --> 02:19:39.373
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4971
02:19:39.770 --> 02:19:43.310
<v Speaker 1>hurricanes are waste carrier hurricanes and the most scary.</v>

4972
02:19:43.350 --> 02:19:44.183
<v Speaker 6>Do you ever,</v>

4973
02:19:44.310 --> 02:19:44.990
<v Speaker 6>you ever see that show,</v>

4974
02:19:44.990 --> 02:19:46.180
<v Speaker 6>this old house you remember?</v>

4975
02:19:46.181 --> 02:19:46.321
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4976
02:19:46.321 --> 02:19:47.154
<v Speaker 6>I remember that guy,</v>

4977
02:19:47.350 --> 02:19:48.670
<v Speaker 6>Bob Dylan and uh,</v>

4978
02:19:48.780 --> 02:19:49.800
<v Speaker 6>they still have that show on,</v>

4979
02:19:49.801 --> 02:19:50.360
<v Speaker 6>I watched it,</v>

4980
02:19:50.360 --> 02:19:50.550
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4981
02:19:50.550 --> 02:19:54.900
<v Speaker 6>some PBS this weekend and they were rebuilding the Jersey shore and they were</v>

4982
02:19:54.901 --> 02:19:57.510
<v Speaker 6>showing how it's destroyed.</v>

4983
02:19:57.540 --> 02:19:58.310
<v Speaker 6>It's destroyed.</v>

4984
02:19:58.310 --> 02:19:58.620
<v Speaker 6>But so,</v>

4985
02:19:58.620 --> 02:20:02.670
<v Speaker 6>but they've had to do is go under all these houses and like lift him up all 10</v>

4986
02:20:02.671 --> 02:20:03.091
<v Speaker 6>feet.</v>

4987
02:20:03.091 --> 02:20:07.100
<v Speaker 6>So all the houses are going up 10 feet to make them taller and taller.</v>

4988
02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:07.980
<v Speaker 6>The water comes in again.</v>

4989
02:20:07.981 --> 02:20:08.400
<v Speaker 6>They're okay.</v>

4990
02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:08.850
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4991
02:20:08.850 --> 02:20:10.920
<v Speaker 6>And they have to take these humongous like,</v>

4992
02:20:10.950 --> 02:20:11.340
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

4993
02:20:11.340 --> 02:20:11.760
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4994
02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:13.500
<v Speaker 6>like these like call holes,</v>

4995
02:20:13.700 --> 02:20:13.951
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4996
02:20:13.951 --> 02:20:17.640
<v Speaker 6>they look like a telephone poles and if they'd like push them into the ground,</v>

4997
02:20:17.641 --> 02:20:19.110
<v Speaker 6>like 20 feet or something like that,</v>

4998
02:20:19.111 --> 02:20:19.830
<v Speaker 6>I just went on,</v>

4999
02:20:19.830 --> 02:20:20.051
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5000
02:20:20.051 --> 02:20:21.760
<v Speaker 6>it's such a pain in the ass and it's not gonna be,</v>

5001
02:20:21.900 --> 02:20:25.290
<v Speaker 6>they say a Jersey shore is probably not going to come back for another seven to</v>

5002
02:20:25.291 --> 02:20:28.350
<v Speaker 6>10 years complete until it's back to normal.</v>

5003
02:20:28.380 --> 02:20:29.213
<v Speaker 6>That's incredible.</v>

5004
02:20:29.580 --> 02:20:30.960
<v Speaker 6>I can't believe that they're going to do that.</v>

5005
02:20:31.230 --> 02:20:33.450
<v Speaker 6>Make these polls and then just sit there.</v>

5006
02:20:33.451 --> 02:20:34.410
<v Speaker 6>And what if the water's on?</v>

5007
02:20:34.520 --> 02:20:38.310
<v Speaker 6>You can imagine fucking sit in your house and the water comes up to the top of</v>

5008
02:20:38.311 --> 02:20:39.660
<v Speaker 6>the pole and you're like,</v>

5009
02:20:39.690 --> 02:20:40.650
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>

5010
02:20:40.651 --> 02:20:42.300
<v Speaker 6>why don't I build a house here again?</v>

5011
02:20:42.301 --> 02:20:43.350
<v Speaker 6>What am I crazy?</v>

5012
02:20:43.351 --> 02:20:43.740
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5013
02:20:43.740 --> 02:20:47.130
<v Speaker 6>I got the ocean on or might have to put the boat on the roof.</v>

5014
02:20:47.131 --> 02:20:50.490
<v Speaker 6>See the ocean like slowly coming up closer and closer to the bottom of your</v>

5015
02:20:50.491 --> 02:20:50.791
<v Speaker 6>house.</v>

5016
02:20:50.791 --> 02:20:51.031
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>

5017
02:20:51.031 --> 02:20:51.650
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>

5018
02:20:51.650 --> 02:20:53.040
<v Speaker 6>why don't you just go 20 feet?</v>

5019
02:20:53.041 --> 02:20:54.340
<v Speaker 6>Why wouldn't you just keep going first?</v>

5020
02:20:54.360 --> 02:20:55.410
<v Speaker 6>That's 20 feet.</v>

5021
02:20:55.730 --> 02:20:58.290
<v Speaker 1>You get all the way up there and the shit would be swaying in the breeze.</v>

5022
02:20:58.291 --> 02:21:00.750
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to dig deeper holes for the columns.</v>

5023
02:21:01.170 --> 02:21:05.190
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to worry about mean I don't know how strong the ground is there.</v>

5024
02:21:05.220 --> 02:21:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5025
02:21:05.500 --> 02:21:06.640
<v Speaker 6>we had a house in Hawaii.</v>

5026
02:21:06.641 --> 02:21:07.690
<v Speaker 6>It was on a poles.</v>

5027
02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:08.860
<v Speaker 6>It was a Ph.</v>

5028
02:21:08.940 --> 02:21:09.530
<v Speaker 6>Dot.</v>

5029
02:21:09.530 --> 02:21:10.091
<v Speaker 6>Right at the beach.</v>

5030
02:21:10.091 --> 02:21:12.220
<v Speaker 6>It got washed away in 69 wow.</v>

5031
02:21:12.221 --> 02:21:12.960
<v Speaker 6>Three houses.</v>

5032
02:21:12.960 --> 02:21:14.080
<v Speaker 6>The waves came up so high.</v>

5033
02:21:14.290 --> 02:21:16.090
<v Speaker 6>Is it between pipeline and why?</v>

5034
02:21:16.091 --> 02:21:17.110
<v Speaker 6>Maybe they live in sunset.</v>

5035
02:21:17.140 --> 02:21:17.973
<v Speaker 6>There was,</v>

5036
02:21:18.040 --> 02:21:21.340
<v Speaker 6>there's three houses there on poles cause they'd been washed up on the cam</v>

5037
02:21:21.341 --> 02:21:23.440
<v Speaker 6>highway when they brought him back down,</v>

5038
02:21:23.770 --> 02:21:26.110
<v Speaker 6>they put them up on these poles and we lived in one of them.</v>

5039
02:21:26.500 --> 02:21:27.430
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

5040
02:21:27.431 --> 02:21:28.240
<v Speaker 6>This is pretty cool.</v>

5041
02:21:28.240 --> 02:21:30.250
<v Speaker 6>But there's waves never came up that high.</v>

5042
02:21:30.251 --> 02:21:30.680
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5043
02:21:30.680 --> 02:21:32.860
<v Speaker 6>I think they were only counting on tsunamis and shit.</v>

5044
02:21:33.300 --> 02:21:34.330
<v Speaker 6>That's what that whole thing,</v>

5045
02:21:34.331 --> 02:21:34.650
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

5046
02:21:34.650 --> 02:21:35.381
<v Speaker 1>the tsunami.</v>

5047
02:21:35.381 --> 02:21:37.660
<v Speaker 1>The thing is if the water comes in,</v>

5048
02:21:38.020 --> 02:21:39.700
<v Speaker 1>it's not coming in by itself.</v>

5049
02:21:39.940 --> 02:21:40.301
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5050
02:21:40.301 --> 02:21:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever watch the tsunami that hit in Japan?</v>

5051
02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5052
02:21:43.170 --> 02:21:46.860
<v Speaker 1>It bringing in boats and houses get hit by a house.</v>

5053
02:21:46.870 --> 02:21:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Get,</v>

5054
02:21:47.100 --> 02:21:47.933
<v Speaker 1>fuck</v>

5055
02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:50.650
<v Speaker 1>your house is going to get hit by a boat.</v>

5056
02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:52.390
<v Speaker 1>You don't want that to happen,</v>

5057
02:21:52.391 --> 02:21:52.810
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5058
02:21:52.810 --> 02:21:53.700
<v Speaker 1>You want to get out of there?</v>

5059
02:21:54.180 --> 02:21:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Just don't fucking count on that 10 foot pole.</v>

5060
02:21:57.220 --> 02:21:58.053
<v Speaker 1>That fucking,</v>

5061
02:21:58.330 --> 02:21:58.601
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

5062
02:21:58.601 --> 02:22:00.040
<v Speaker 1>There's people that stayed in,</v>

5063
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5064
02:22:00.400 --> 02:22:00.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5065
02:22:00.910 --> 02:22:01.601
<v Speaker 1>many storms.</v>

5066
02:22:01.601 --> 02:22:03.160
<v Speaker 1>I remember Gloria when I was a kid,</v>

5067
02:22:03.580 --> 02:22:06.730
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid and I lived in Boston is when the Hurricane Gloria hit.</v>

5068
02:22:06.731 --> 02:22:07.720
<v Speaker 1>I want to say,</v>

5069
02:22:08.200 --> 02:22:08.501
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

5070
02:22:08.501 --> 02:22:09.101
<v Speaker 1>if I had to guess,</v>

5071
02:22:09.101 --> 02:22:10.270
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to say I was in high school,</v>

5072
02:22:10.271 --> 02:22:12.040
<v Speaker 1>so I'd say it was in the 80s,</v>

5073
02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:13.933
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

5074
02:22:13.990 --> 02:22:18.930
<v Speaker 1>it was a huge one and it hit way the fuck up the east coast and uh,</v>

5075
02:22:18.970 --> 02:22:21.700
<v Speaker 1>it put knocked the power out and a lot of places.</v>

5076
02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:24.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5077
02:22:24.490 --> 02:22:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5078
02:22:25.140 --> 02:22:25.320
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

5079
02:22:25.320 --> 02:22:25.501
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

5080
02:22:25.501 --> 02:22:25.681
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

5081
02:22:25.681 --> 02:22:25.891
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

5082
02:22:25.891 --> 02:22:26.700
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

5083
02:22:26.700 --> 02:22:28.380
<v Speaker 1>it was 1985,</v>

5084
02:22:28.590 --> 02:22:29.610
<v Speaker 1>so it was when I was,</v>

5085
02:22:29.611 --> 02:22:30.444
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5086
02:22:30.540 --> 02:22:32.460
<v Speaker 1>in high school and I was graduating.</v>

5087
02:22:32.461 --> 02:22:33.090
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't like the,</v>

5088
02:22:33.090 --> 02:22:35.070
<v Speaker 1>my senior year of high school was 85,</v>

5089
02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:40.500
<v Speaker 1>and that's when this fucker hit and it hit the first major storm to affect New</v>

5090
02:22:40.500 --> 02:22:44.760
<v Speaker 1>York and long island directly since Hurricane Donna in 1960.</v>

5091
02:22:44.970 --> 02:22:47.220
<v Speaker 1>So people went a long time.</v>

5092
02:22:47.700 --> 02:22:52.260
<v Speaker 1>They went 25 years when they hadn't had a hurricane hit him.</v>

5093
02:22:52.530 --> 02:22:57.530
<v Speaker 1>And this motherfucker came down and wiped out everything and power was out.</v>

5094
02:22:58.201 --> 02:22:59.430
<v Speaker 1>And I lived in Boston,</v>

5095
02:22:59.431 --> 02:23:01.920
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty far away from the epicenter of the storm,</v>

5096
02:23:01.921 --> 02:23:04.650
<v Speaker 1>but I remember it being utterly humbling.</v>

5097
02:23:05.010 --> 02:23:06.810
<v Speaker 1>I remember we were in my house,</v>

5098
02:23:06.811 --> 02:23:10.380
<v Speaker 1>we were looking out the window and the trees were just fucking like,</v>

5099
02:23:10.590 --> 02:23:11.423
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

5100
02:23:11.640 --> 02:23:12.810
<v Speaker 1>like leaves.</v>

5101
02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:14.580
<v Speaker 1>They were blowing back and forth.</v>

5102
02:23:14.581 --> 02:23:15.810
<v Speaker 1>Like they were just leaves.</v>

5103
02:23:15.810 --> 02:23:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Like there was no weight to them and he would see you would go out afterwards</v>

5104
02:23:18.991 --> 02:23:20.940
<v Speaker 1>and just trees would be falling everywhere.</v>

5105
02:23:20.941 --> 02:23:22.890
<v Speaker 1>Just collapsed over streets,</v>

5106
02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:24.360
<v Speaker 1>collapsed on houses,</v>

5107
02:23:24.361 --> 02:23:25.400
<v Speaker 1>collapsing on cars,</v>

5108
02:23:25.401 --> 02:23:27.360
<v Speaker 1>just broken trees everywhere.</v>

5109
02:23:27.690 --> 02:23:29.070
<v Speaker 1>And just the feeling like,</v>

5110
02:23:29.071 --> 02:23:29.904
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

5111
02:23:30.060 --> 02:23:30.271
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

5112
02:23:30.271 --> 02:23:30.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5113
02:23:30.451 --> 02:23:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I had been in storms before.</v>

5114
02:23:31.741 --> 02:23:33.060
<v Speaker 1>I'd been in thunderstorms before.</v>

5115
02:23:33.061 --> 02:23:34.290
<v Speaker 1>I'd been in snowstorms before,</v>

5116
02:23:34.560 --> 02:23:37.410
<v Speaker 1>but there was something about a hurricane and even a hurricane that,</v>

5117
02:23:37.770 --> 02:23:38.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5118
02:23:38.241 --> 02:23:38.400
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5119
02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:40.380
<v Speaker 1>I was way away from the center.</v>

5120
02:23:40.650 --> 02:23:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I lived in Boston,</v>

5121
02:23:42.150 --> 02:23:42.901
<v Speaker 1>I lived in Newton,</v>

5122
02:23:42.901 --> 02:23:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts actually.</v>

5123
02:23:43.951 --> 02:23:44.731
<v Speaker 1>So that was like,</v>

5124
02:23:44.731 --> 02:23:45.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5125
02:23:45.240 --> 02:23:46.590
<v Speaker 1>a suburb of Boston.</v>

5126
02:23:46.860 --> 02:23:47.101
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

5127
02:23:47.101 --> 02:23:47.431
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

5128
02:23:47.431 --> 02:23:47.881
<v Speaker 1>we didn't,</v>

5129
02:23:47.881 --> 02:23:48.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5130
02:23:48.300 --> 02:23:49.021
<v Speaker 1>we didn't get enough.</v>

5131
02:23:49.021 --> 02:23:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Joel was,</v>

5132
02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:49.800
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

5133
02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:50.670
<v Speaker 1>just the residual.</v>

5134
02:23:51.390 --> 02:23:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>

5135
02:23:52.680 --> 02:23:53.101
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5136
02:23:53.101 --> 02:23:53.934
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

5137
02:23:54.180 --> 02:23:58.140
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't imagine what it would be like to be in one of those Katrina ones.</v>

5138
02:23:58.260 --> 02:23:58.910
<v Speaker 1>The ocean is</v>

5139
02:23:58.910 --> 02:24:00.920
<v Speaker 4>so powerful that that water,</v>

5140
02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:01.330
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

5141
02:24:01.330 --> 02:24:02.163
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5142
02:24:02.540 --> 02:24:03.171
<v Speaker 4>when I was out there,</v>

5143
02:24:03.171 --> 02:24:05.750
<v Speaker 4>I started to learn how to surf two about the same time and near death.</v>

5144
02:24:05.751 --> 02:24:07.460
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many times you hit by one of these waves.</v>

5145
02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:11.030
<v Speaker 4>The water possesses so much power.</v>

5146
02:24:12.210 --> 02:24:13.970
<v Speaker 4>You really have to have a respect for it,</v>

5147
02:24:13.971 --> 02:24:14.211
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

5148
02:24:14.211 --> 02:24:16.340
<v Speaker 4>And once it gets riled up like that coming at,</v>

5149
02:24:16.341 --> 02:24:17.120
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5150
02:24:17.120 --> 02:24:20.030
<v Speaker 4>there's not a whole lot going to be done to slow it down,</v>

5151
02:24:20.031 --> 02:24:20.740
<v Speaker 4>I don't think.</v>

5152
02:24:20.740 --> 02:24:20.861
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5153
02:24:20.861 --> 02:24:25.490
<v Speaker 1>I think we're basing our ideas about what the atmosphere is like,</v>

5154
02:24:25.491 --> 02:24:26.740
<v Speaker 1>like what the weather's like,</v>

5155
02:24:26.741 --> 02:24:27.640
<v Speaker 1>what the,</v>

5156
02:24:27.670 --> 02:24:27.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5157
02:24:27.941 --> 02:24:29.860
<v Speaker 1>the safety of being around volcanoes,</v>

5158
02:24:29.861 --> 02:24:31.060
<v Speaker 1>the safety of being around the ocean.</v>

5159
02:24:31.270 --> 02:24:34.090
<v Speaker 1>We're basing it on the few hundred years.</v>

5160
02:24:34.091 --> 02:24:36.130
<v Speaker 1>If people have been paying attention and taking notes.</v>

5161
02:24:36.400 --> 02:24:36.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5162
02:24:36.820 --> 02:24:38.710
<v Speaker 1>how many people have been here before that?</v>

5163
02:24:38.740 --> 02:24:40.150
<v Speaker 1>The native Americans only.</v>

5164
02:24:40.151 --> 02:24:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Really what happened to them.</v>

5165
02:24:41.470 --> 02:24:41.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5166
02:24:41.771 --> 02:24:42.850
<v Speaker 1>Well that was us.</v>

5167
02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:43.660
<v Speaker 1>Most of it,</v>

5168
02:24:43.660 --> 02:24:44.740
<v Speaker 1>but the tsunami.</v>

5169
02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:48.310
<v Speaker 1>But there was certainly people that died in that way as well.</v>

5170
02:24:48.370 --> 02:24:49.203
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5171
02:24:49.300 --> 02:24:50.680
<v Speaker 1>we just didn't hear about it.</v>

5172
02:24:50.980 --> 02:24:51.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5173
02:24:51.221 --> 02:24:52.270
<v Speaker 1>they had to be people.</v>

5174
02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:55.240
<v Speaker 1>If people have lived in North America for the past,</v>

5175
02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:55.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5176
02:24:55.840 --> 02:24:57.370
<v Speaker 1>x amount of thousands of years,</v>

5177
02:24:57.371 --> 02:25:00.490
<v Speaker 1>like they have evidence that goes way back to 10,000 years ago of people living</v>

5178
02:25:00.491 --> 02:25:01.324
<v Speaker 1>in North America.</v>

5179
02:25:01.570 --> 02:25:03.610
<v Speaker 1>So that's the case for sure.</v>

5180
02:25:03.611 --> 02:25:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Something during that time,</v>

5181
02:25:04.871 --> 02:25:06.220
<v Speaker 1>like there had been a bunch of events,</v>

5182
02:25:06.221 --> 02:25:07.090
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of things happening,</v>

5183
02:25:07.240 --> 02:25:08.530
<v Speaker 1>we just were not aware.</v>

5184
02:25:08.650 --> 02:25:11.470
<v Speaker 1>So when something like Katrina comes or something like Gloria comes when I was</v>

5185
02:25:11.471 --> 02:25:12.304
<v Speaker 1>in high school,</v>

5186
02:25:12.310 --> 02:25:13.240
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

5187
02:25:13.241 --> 02:25:13.601
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

5188
02:25:13.601 --> 02:25:13.841
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

5189
02:25:13.841 --> 02:25:14.440
<v Speaker 1>is this po?</v>

5190
02:25:14.440 --> 02:25:14.711
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

5191
02:25:14.711 --> 02:25:15.970
<v Speaker 1>this can happen to like,</v>

5192
02:25:15.971 --> 02:25:17.050
<v Speaker 1>this can fucking happen.</v>

5193
02:25:17.410 --> 02:25:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Like shouldn't we be prepared for this?</v>

5194
02:25:18.970 --> 02:25:20.050
<v Speaker 1>How often does this happen?</v>

5195
02:25:20.260 --> 02:25:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5196
02:25:20.420 --> 02:25:21.253
<v Speaker 1>the last time it happens,</v>

5197
02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:22.720
<v Speaker 1>1960s I just relaxed.</v>

5198
02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5199
02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:24.851
<v Speaker 2>But it can happen,</v>

5200
02:25:24.851 --> 02:25:25.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5201
02:25:25.150 --> 02:25:25.983
<v Speaker 2>This can happen.</v>

5202
02:25:26.110 --> 02:25:29.350
<v Speaker 2>You should prepare for this now that you know that this can happen,</v>

5203
02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:32.560
<v Speaker 2>there should be no houses that are built from here on out that can't deal with</v>

5204
02:25:32.561 --> 02:25:34.420
<v Speaker 2>this because it might not happen,</v>

5205
02:25:34.450 --> 02:25:35.710
<v Speaker 2>but it could fucking happen.</v>

5206
02:25:35.711 --> 02:25:38.770
<v Speaker 2>It has happened and you got to have them on record.</v>

5207
02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:42.070
<v Speaker 2>You've got one from 1960 you got one from 1985 dot.</v>

5208
02:25:42.080 --> 02:25:43.480
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck do I have to tell you?</v>

5209
02:25:43.570 --> 02:25:44.290
<v Speaker 2>We're waiting for that.</v>

5210
02:25:44.290 --> 02:25:45.430
<v Speaker 2>These pitches are happening.</v>

5211
02:25:45.431 --> 02:25:46.264
<v Speaker 2>They're coming.</v>

5212
02:25:46.450 --> 02:25:47.170
<v Speaker 2>Let's get ready.</v>

5213
02:25:47.170 --> 02:25:48.010
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what can happen.</v>

5214
02:25:48.011 --> 02:25:49.180
<v Speaker 2>You can get three of them in a year,</v>

5215
02:25:49.240 --> 02:25:51.310
<v Speaker 2>like the ones that existed before.</v>

5216
02:25:51.311 --> 02:25:52.570
<v Speaker 2>People measured things.</v>

5217
02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:53.620
<v Speaker 2>They still existed.</v>

5218
02:25:53.740 --> 02:25:57.340
<v Speaker 2>The giant fucking storms that killed people before meteorologists were invented</v>

5219
02:25:57.520 --> 02:26:01.870
<v Speaker 2>were still valid and this idea that we're basing it off on this tiny little</v>

5220
02:26:01.871 --> 02:26:03.430
<v Speaker 2>window that we've been alive and I've fucking,</v>

5221
02:26:03.740 --> 02:26:07.280
<v Speaker 2>I've been in La since 94 I haven't seen a single fucking significant earthquake.</v>

5222
02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:08.510
<v Speaker 2>There's not worry if everybody's supposedly,</v>

5223
02:26:08.670 --> 02:26:09.520
<v Speaker 2>are you crazy?</v>

5224
02:26:09.910 --> 02:26:12.410
<v Speaker 2>This fucking things on a piece of moving ground.</v>

5225
02:26:12.411 --> 02:26:12.621
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

5226
02:26:12.621 --> 02:26:16.930
<v Speaker 2>you don't live long enough for it to move that much because the perspective that</v>

5227
02:26:18.340 --> 02:26:20.770
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at in terms of a human life perspective,</v>

5228
02:26:21.170 --> 02:26:24.430
<v Speaker 2>you've got to look at it in a fractal sense like earth and there's no</v>

5229
02:26:24.431 --> 02:26:25.264
<v Speaker 2>guarantees.</v>

5230
02:26:25.330 --> 02:26:25.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5231
02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:27.430
<v Speaker 2>This years is nothing.</v>

5232
02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:29.560
<v Speaker 2>It could be right now it's time could be up.</v>

5233
02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:31.450
<v Speaker 2>We'll just think about what we were talking about before.</v>

5234
02:26:31.451 --> 02:26:33.880
<v Speaker 2>The difference between us and the people in the 1940s,</v>

5235
02:26:33.940 --> 02:26:36.850
<v Speaker 2>the difference between the people in 1940s in the difference between them and</v>

5236
02:26:36.851 --> 02:26:39.790
<v Speaker 2>the people in the 1820s add all that stuff up together,</v>

5237
02:26:39.910 --> 02:26:40.451
<v Speaker 2>look at it,</v>

5238
02:26:40.451 --> 02:26:42.340
<v Speaker 2>and just go back a few times like that.</v>

5239
02:26:42.341 --> 02:26:43.570
<v Speaker 2>A few generations like that.</v>

5240
02:26:43.870 --> 02:26:45.460
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we have.</v>

5241
02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:47.350
<v Speaker 2>That's the amount of information we have.</v>

5242
02:26:47.351 --> 02:26:48.670
<v Speaker 2>And in that time,</v>

5243
02:26:48.671 --> 02:26:49.690
<v Speaker 2>in those time periods,</v>

5244
02:26:49.900 --> 02:26:51.070
<v Speaker 2>we have a bunch of them.</v>

5245
02:26:51.220 --> 02:26:54.220
<v Speaker 2>We have the earthquake and fire in San Francisco,</v>

5246
02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:55.750
<v Speaker 2>we have floods,</v>

5247
02:26:55.900 --> 02:26:58.030
<v Speaker 2>we have Hurricane Katrina,</v>

5248
02:26:58.031 --> 02:26:59.160
<v Speaker 2>we have glory.</v>

5249
02:26:59.380 --> 02:27:01.690
<v Speaker 2>We have the most recent ones.</v>

5250
02:27:01.691 --> 02:27:01.801
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

5251
02:27:01.801 --> 02:27:05.350
<v Speaker 2>the tornadoes that the one that fucking town in.</v>

5252
02:27:05.380 --> 02:27:06.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5253
02:27:06.070 --> 02:27:07.570
<v Speaker 2>what was the town that Joplin,</v>

5254
02:27:07.571 --> 02:27:10.990
<v Speaker 2>Mississippi like almost completely wiped off the map.</v>

5255
02:27:11.260 --> 02:27:12.580
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was Joplin.</v>

5256
02:27:12.581 --> 02:27:13.600
<v Speaker 2>I should probably put her here.</v>

5257
02:27:13.601 --> 02:27:14.434
<v Speaker 2>Mississippi,</v>

5258
02:27:14.890 --> 02:27:15.281
<v Speaker 2>Missouri.</v>

5259
02:27:15.281 --> 02:27:15.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5260
02:27:15.551 --> 02:27:15.911
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

5261
02:27:15.911 --> 02:27:16.241
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

5262
02:27:16.241 --> 02:27:16.690
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

5263
02:27:16.690 --> 02:27:17.111
<v Speaker 2>Joplin,</v>

5264
02:27:17.111 --> 02:27:20.240
<v Speaker 2>Missouri was favorite places.</v>

5265
02:27:21.190 --> 02:27:22.023
<v Speaker 2>Hang out in Joplin.</v>

5266
02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Tornado.</v>

5267
02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:25.113
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

5268
02:27:25.190 --> 02:27:25.900
<v Speaker 2>he's joking.</v>

5269
02:27:25.900 --> 02:27:26.321
<v Speaker 2>He's joking,</v>

5270
02:27:26.321 --> 02:27:26.580
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

5271
02:27:26.580 --> 02:27:26.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5272
02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:29.080
<v Speaker 2>In 2011 and Joplin,</v>

5273
02:27:29.300 --> 02:27:31.000
<v Speaker 2>a tornado struck Joplin,</v>

5274
02:27:31.001 --> 02:27:31.834
<v Speaker 2>Missouri.</v>

5275
02:27:32.290 --> 02:27:32.830
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5276
02:27:32.830 --> 02:27:33.730
<v Speaker 2>it was a large,</v>

5277
02:27:34.330 --> 02:27:39.330
<v Speaker 2>a larger late May tornado outbreak and it reached a maximum width ready for this</v>

5278
02:27:40.150 --> 02:27:42.430
<v Speaker 2>of one mile.</v>

5279
02:27:42.910 --> 02:27:44.920
<v Speaker 2>A width of a mile.</v>

5280
02:27:45.250 --> 02:27:46.540
<v Speaker 2>A Tornado.</v>

5281
02:27:46.780 --> 02:27:48.260
<v Speaker 2>That's a why?</v>

5282
02:27:48.850 --> 02:27:49.121
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5283
02:27:49.121 --> 02:27:49.391
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5284
02:27:49.391 --> 02:27:49.631
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5285
02:27:49.631 --> 02:27:49.901
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5286
02:27:49.901 --> 02:27:50.171
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5287
02:27:50.171 --> 02:27:50.441
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5288
02:27:50.441 --> 02:27:50.920
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5289
02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:52.870
<v Speaker 2>That's the devastation path.</v>

5290
02:27:53.100 --> 02:27:53.360
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5291
02:27:53.360 --> 02:27:56.590
<v Speaker 2>a mile wide when it comes through the terrorists of five,</v>

5292
02:27:57.940 --> 02:27:58.773
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

5293
02:27:58.780 --> 02:28:00.310
<v Speaker 2>What's the FBI in that classification?</v>

5294
02:28:00.311 --> 02:28:01.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that means.</v>

5295
02:28:01.250 --> 02:28:02.590
<v Speaker 2>I just know it means death.</v>

5296
02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:03.550
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5297
02:28:03.550 --> 02:28:04.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5298
02:28:04.130 --> 02:28:08.740
<v Speaker 2>Like a reach a maximum width of nearly one mile during its path through the</v>

5299
02:28:08.741 --> 02:28:10.060
<v Speaker 2>southern part of the city.</v>

5300
02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:14.050
<v Speaker 2>It rapidly intensified and tracked eastward through across the city and then</v>

5301
02:28:14.051 --> 02:28:19.051
<v Speaker 2>continued eastward across interstate 44 into rural sections of Jasper County and</v>

5302
02:28:19.751 --> 02:28:20.590
<v Speaker 2>Newton County.</v>

5303
02:28:20.860 --> 02:28:21.140
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

5304
02:28:21.140 --> 02:28:25.010
<v Speaker 2>the third tornado destroyed Joplin's since May of 1971,</v>

5305
02:28:25.250 --> 02:28:30.250
<v Speaker 2>the tornado killed 158 people with the additional four indirect deaths,</v>

5306
02:28:30.831 --> 02:28:32.330
<v Speaker 2>injured some 1000,</v>

5307
02:28:32.331 --> 02:28:37.331
<v Speaker 2>150 others and caused damages amounted to two point $8 billion.</v>

5308
02:28:37.461 --> 02:28:41.390
<v Speaker 2>It was the deadliest tornado to strike the United States since the 1947</v>

5309
02:28:41.391 --> 02:28:42.224
<v Speaker 2>tornadoes.</v>

5310
02:28:42.920 --> 02:28:43.753
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

5311
02:28:43.940 --> 02:28:47.660
<v Speaker 2>Since the turn it in a 47 there was multiple.</v>

5312
02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:49.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5313
02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:50.770
<v Speaker 2>There was the glacier,</v>

5314
02:28:51.650 --> 02:28:53.000
<v Speaker 2>the glacier Higgins,</v>

5315
02:28:53.001 --> 02:28:55.990
<v Speaker 2>Woodward tornadoes in 1947 sure.</v>

5316
02:28:56.690 --> 02:28:57.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5317
02:28:57.500 --> 02:28:58.071
<v Speaker 2>And these,</v>

5318
02:28:58.071 --> 02:28:58.281
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5319
02:28:58.281 --> 02:29:03.281
<v Speaker 2>they traveled 125 miles from Texas to Oklahoma destroying everything in its path</v>

5320
02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:09.200
<v Speaker 2>because it was originally thought to have left a 220 mile path,</v>

5321
02:29:09.350 --> 02:29:12.440
<v Speaker 2>but it's now believed to have been a part of a family of eight or nine</v>

5322
02:29:12.441 --> 02:29:13.274
<v Speaker 2>tornadoes.</v>

5323
02:29:13.310 --> 02:29:15.460
<v Speaker 11>Ooh.</v>

5324
02:29:15.770 --> 02:29:15.921
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5325
02:29:15.921 --> 02:29:18.410
<v Speaker 2>fucking family of tornadoes.</v>

5326
02:29:18.590 --> 02:29:19.430
<v Speaker 2>These tornadoes,</v>

5327
02:29:19.431 --> 02:29:20.211
<v Speaker 2>although deadly,</v>

5328
02:29:20.211 --> 02:29:23.360
<v Speaker 2>did not match the astounding death toll of the earlier event.</v>

5329
02:29:23.630 --> 02:29:27.080
<v Speaker 2>Nor did they match the record speed of that tornado or the,</v>

5330
02:29:27.081 --> 02:29:29.900
<v Speaker 2>although at over 40 miles per hour,</v>

5331
02:29:29.901 --> 02:29:32.390
<v Speaker 2>they qualified as a fast tracking storm.</v>

5332
02:29:33.290 --> 02:29:33.980
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5333
02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:34.341
<v Speaker 2>Mom,</v>

5334
02:29:34.341 --> 02:29:35.174
<v Speaker 2>I'm home,</v>

5335
02:29:35.930 --> 02:29:36.430
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

5336
02:29:36.430 --> 02:29:39.770
<v Speaker 2>Could you fucking imagine looking out your window and seeing nine tornadoes</v>

5337
02:29:39.771 --> 02:29:42.650
<v Speaker 2>coming at you and just thinking about all the times you jerked off and what the</v>

5338
02:29:42.651 --> 02:29:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Bible told you and you're like thinking it was you.</v>

5339
02:29:45.220 --> 02:29:45.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5340
02:29:45.950 --> 02:29:49.230
<v Speaker 2>if you lived in 1947 very low cost are coming on top of it,</v>

5341
02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:49.911
<v Speaker 2>they know it's over.</v>

5342
02:29:49.911 --> 02:29:53.330
<v Speaker 2>If you were in Texas and it was 1947 you could convince yourself that those</v>

5343
02:29:53.331 --> 02:29:55.280
<v Speaker 2>tornadoes we're coming for you because you jerked off.</v>

5344
02:29:55.730 --> 02:30:00.560
<v Speaker 2>If you were 16 if you were some kid who's just resisting church so bad,</v>

5345
02:30:00.680 --> 02:30:01.340
<v Speaker 2>but you couldn't,</v>

5346
02:30:01.340 --> 02:30:03.480
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't stop beating off and you still go to church,</v>

5347
02:30:03.530 --> 02:30:06.380
<v Speaker 2>dad would scream at you and you're in there beaten off and you look out the</v>

5348
02:30:06.381 --> 02:30:10.940
<v Speaker 2>window and you see nine tornadoes headed your thing and you're fucking convinced</v>

5349
02:30:10.941 --> 02:30:13.940
<v Speaker 2>it was you convinced it was you that killed everybody.</v>

5350
02:30:14.120 --> 02:30:19.120
<v Speaker 2>Fire and Brimstone Brian Red Band masturbate and the devil is sent his edge men</v>

5351
02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:23.870
<v Speaker 2>to take you out of the path and out of the path of righteousness and you have to</v>

5352
02:30:23.871 --> 02:30:26.240
<v Speaker 2>become a priest because everyone in the town died cause he you,</v>

5353
02:30:26.510 --> 02:30:29.420
<v Speaker 2>you and your beating off you fuck family or tornadoes.</v>

5354
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:30.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5355
02:30:30.110 --> 02:30:31.430
<v Speaker 2>that's a terrifying idea.</v>

5356
02:30:31.760 --> 02:30:34.630
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of heavy vibes on that man and you know you're behind.</v>

5357
02:30:34.670 --> 02:30:37.220
<v Speaker 2>It's a mile wide tornado.</v>

5358
02:30:38.330 --> 02:30:39.141
<v Speaker 2>What the hell,</v>

5359
02:30:39.141 --> 02:30:39.290
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

5360
02:30:39.290 --> 02:30:41.060
<v Speaker 2>Nine of them now a little patch.</v>

5361
02:30:41.090 --> 02:30:41.901
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if I'm accurate.</v>

5362
02:30:41.901 --> 02:30:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Tornadoes.</v>

5363
02:30:42.620 --> 02:30:46.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm wonder if I'm correct saying the mile of destruction because it sounded so</v>

5364
02:30:46.011 --> 02:30:47.900
<v Speaker 2>much better than just the actual width of the storm.</v>

5365
02:30:47.990 --> 02:30:50.090
<v Speaker 6>So happy we don't have to deal with tornadoes man.</v>

5366
02:30:50.091 --> 02:30:51.690
<v Speaker 6>That shit was so I saw one the other day.</v>

5367
02:30:52.130 --> 02:30:54.860
<v Speaker 6>I saw one the other day where I saw a tornado of leaves.</v>

5368
02:30:55.010 --> 02:30:55.430
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

5369

5378
02:31:05.491 --> 02:31:07.730
<v Speaker 6>like driving to like Vegas or something and you'll just see on the side of the</v>

5379
02:31:07.731 --> 02:31:09.370
<v Speaker 6>road like a sand tornado.</v>

<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they can get them.</v>

5388
02:31:16.020 --> 02:31:18.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean they have gotten them in California before we,</v>

5389
02:31:18.131 --> 02:31:18.990
<v Speaker 2>we looked that up one.</v>

5390
02:31:19.440 --> 02:31:20.390

02:31:22.201 --> 02:31:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Something that,</v>

5394
02:31:22.860 --> 02:31:25.140
<v Speaker 1>whether it stops and it starts to spinning.</v>

5395
02:31:25.200 --> 02:31:27.830
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's like cold weather mixing was warm weather.</v>

5396
02:31:27.840 --> 02:31:28.673
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5397
02:31:28.900 --> 02:31:29.733
<v Speaker 1>Cold France.</v>

02:31:29.990 --> 02:31:30.601
<v Speaker 1>Warm,</v>

5399
02:31:30.601 --> 02:31:31.470
<v Speaker 1>warm weather is,</v>

<v Speaker 1>well let's look it up.</v>

5405
02:31:34.350 --> 02:31:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about what causes the tornado is a tornado.</v>

5406
02:31:36.310 --> 02:31:39.660
<v Speaker 1>This is clone to learn today.</v>

5407
02:31:39.770 --> 02:31:40.920
<v Speaker 1>What we're learning every day.</v>

5408
02:31:40.980 --> 02:31:41.813
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully.</v>

5409
02:31:42.330 --> 02:31:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5410
02:31:42.690 --> 02:31:43.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to go along with that.</v>

5411
02:31:43.921 --> 02:31:45.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm still holding the cards.</v>

5414
02:31:49.250 --> 02:31:54.120
<v Speaker 1>A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the</v>

5415
02:31:54.121 --> 02:31:55.380
<v Speaker 1>surface of the earth.</v>

5428
02:32:25.410 --> 02:32:29.400
<v Speaker 1>They're often come cumulus and they were often referred to as twisters are</v>

5429
02:32:29.401 --> 02:32:29.940
<v Speaker 1>cyclones,</v>

5430
02:32:29.940 --> 02:32:34.200
<v Speaker 1>although the word cyclone is using meteorology in a wider sense to name any</v>

5431
02:32:34.201 --> 02:32:36.000
<v Speaker 1>close low pressure circulation.</v>

5432
02:32:36.090 --> 02:32:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes,</v>

5433
02:32:38.521 --> 02:32:43.521
<v Speaker 1>but they're typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel who's narrow</v>

5434
02:32:44.191 --> 02:32:49.191
<v Speaker 1>and touches the earth in its often encircled by a cloud of debris and dust.</v>

5435
02:32:49.620 --> 02:32:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen the video from Dallas,</v>

5436
02:32:51.211 --> 02:32:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Texas from two years ago where semis were flying through the air?</v>

5437
02:32:56.240 --> 02:32:57.073

5439
02:32:57.960 --> 02:33:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Pull up semis flying through the air in Dallas.</v>

5444
02:33:06.540 --> 02:33:08.400
<v Speaker 1>I was in Texas at the time too.</v>

5445

<v Speaker 1>I was in another part of Texas and the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think I was in another state,</v>

5455
02:33:19.310 --> 02:33:20.330

5458
02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:22.670
<v Speaker 1>I could have been in Texas right now.</v>

<v Speaker 1>they're removing them.</v>

5482
02:33:57.360 --> 02:34:01.750
<v Speaker 1>They're removing electrical cables and shit from the ground and shorting things</v>

5483
02:34:01.751 --> 02:34:02.140
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

5507
02:34:34.481 --> 02:34:35.920
<v Speaker 2>It's throwing it through the air.</v>

5508
02:34:36.700 --> 02:34:39.730
<v Speaker 2>Those are all like cargo boxes and tractor trailers.</v>

5509
02:34:39.910 --> 02:34:40.510
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5518
02:35:00.100 --> 02:35:00.933
<v Speaker 2>it is on our terms,</v>

5519
02:35:01.030 --> 02:35:06.030
<v Speaker 2>especially when we're fucking around light and shit on fire and sending rocket</v>

5520
02:35:06.101 --> 02:35:07.180
<v Speaker 2>ships in the space.</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

5525
02:35:16.210 --> 02:35:17.080
<v Speaker 2>But even if we didn't,</v>

5526
02:35:17.500 --> 02:35:18.340
<v Speaker 2>even if we didn't add,</v>

5527
02:35:18.580 --> 02:35:20.530
<v Speaker 2>even if we did in the places that God damn horrifying mess,</v>

5528
02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:22.330
<v Speaker 2>even if we didn't do a goddamn thing,</v>

5529
02:35:22.331 --> 02:35:24.520
<v Speaker 2>if we lived our lives completely egocentric,</v>

5530
02:35:24.730 --> 02:35:26.650
<v Speaker 2>if we lived our lives with organic farming,</v>

5531
02:35:26.740 --> 02:35:29.710
<v Speaker 2>if we lived our lives in a completely harmonious way with nature,</v>

5532
02:35:29.860 --> 02:35:34.030
<v Speaker 2>we could still get smushed by big Robert Space clobbered.</v>

5533
02:35:34.540 --> 02:35:35.400
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5537
02:35:39.070 --> 02:35:41.380
<v Speaker 2>loving to our mother earth and we absolutely should.</v>

5538
02:35:42.280 --> 02:35:43.001
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

5539
02:35:43.001 --> 02:35:44.110
<v Speaker 2>100% without a doubt.</v>

5540
02:35:44.111 --> 02:35:45.100
<v Speaker 2>No argument from me,</v>

5541
02:35:45.130 --> 02:35:48.820
<v Speaker 2>but it's possible for us to get fucked up by a super volcano.</v>

5542
02:35:48.850 --> 02:35:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Even if we did,</v>

5543
02:35:50.260 --> 02:35:52.360
<v Speaker 2>even if we did an ice age can come,</v>

5544
02:35:52.390 --> 02:35:54.220
<v Speaker 2>even if we did the best we could do.</v>

5545
02:35:54.280 --> 02:35:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Well the dinosaurs are all die where they hit it with a media.</v>

5546
02:35:58.090 --> 02:35:58.331
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5547
02:35:58.331 --> 02:35:59.690
<v Speaker 2>they were using their cell phones too much.</v>

5548
02:35:59.690 --> 02:36:00.521
<v Speaker 2>Shoot myself itself,</v>

5549
02:36:00.521 --> 02:36:01.750
<v Speaker 2>the fucking cell phone,</v>

5550
02:36:01.990 --> 02:36:02.171
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5551
02:36:02.171 --> 02:36:03.960
<v Speaker 2>drew in magic.</v>

5552
02:36:03.970 --> 02:36:08.200
<v Speaker 2>They found old cell phones that dinosaurs used and we realize we're super</v>

5553
02:36:08.201 --> 02:36:09.620
<v Speaker 2>fucking smart but had cell phones.</v>

5554
02:36:09.830 --> 02:36:12.100
<v Speaker 2>I picture that guy on that line and uh,</v>

5555
02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:15.400
<v Speaker 2>he was in the beginning of a movie and he was walking by with a phone on his ear</v>

5556
02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:16.930
<v Speaker 2>is in front of man's theater.</v>

5557
02:36:17.380 --> 02:36:18.161
<v Speaker 2>What was that movie?</v>

5558
02:36:18.161 --> 02:36:18.551
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>

5559
02:36:18.551 --> 02:36:18.750
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

5560
02:36:18.750 --> 02:36:23.650
<v Speaker 2>a last clip they found off of an old movie Charlie Chaplin Movie.</v>

5561
02:36:23.950 --> 02:36:24.431
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

5562
02:36:24.431 --> 02:36:24.611
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5563
02:36:24.611 --> 02:36:24.830
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5564
02:36:24.830 --> 02:36:25.540
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5565
02:36:25.540 --> 02:36:27.670
<v Speaker 2>He had everyone thought,</v>

5566
02:36:27.730 --> 02:36:27.940
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

5567
02:36:27.940 --> 02:36:29.110
<v Speaker 2>that guy walking by with a thing.</v>

5568
02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:29.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5569
02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:30.520
<v Speaker 2>It's not what it was.</v>

5570
02:36:30.700 --> 02:36:33.970
<v Speaker 2>There was an invention that they had come up with for people that were hard of</v>

5571
02:36:33.971 --> 02:36:36.620
<v Speaker 2>hearing before they had hearing aids and you hold it up to a year.</v>

5572
02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:37.840
<v Speaker 2>It would magnify the sound.</v>

5573
02:36:38.350 --> 02:36:39.183
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>

5574
02:36:39.250 --> 02:36:40.300
<v Speaker 2>And so to,</v>

5575
02:36:40.330 --> 02:36:42.310
<v Speaker 2>in a blurry image when you're looking at it,</v>

5576
02:36:42.370 --> 02:36:43.090
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

5577
02:36:43.090 --> 02:36:43.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5578
02:36:43.271 --> 02:36:44.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like a future guys.</v>

5579
02:36:44.481 --> 02:36:45.400
<v Speaker 2>It's on a cell phone.</v>

5580
02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:46.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5581
02:36:46.300 --> 02:36:46.931
<v Speaker 2>to this day,</v>

5582
02:36:46.931 --> 02:36:48.480
<v Speaker 2>people have ear problems and they,</v>

5583
02:36:48.481 --> 02:36:49.840
<v Speaker 2>they get hearing aids.</v>

5584
02:36:49.880 --> 02:36:50.830
<v Speaker 2>I see him a lot.</v>

5585
02:36:50.831 --> 02:36:51.730
<v Speaker 2>They stick out of their ear.</v>

5586
02:36:52.150 --> 02:36:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5587
02:36:52.510 --> 02:36:53.500
<v Speaker 2>back in those days,</v>

5588
02:36:53.501 --> 02:36:54.730
<v Speaker 2>they just held it up to their ear.</v>

5589
02:36:54.880 --> 02:36:55.091
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

5590
02:36:55.091 --> 02:36:55.430
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5591
02:36:55.430 --> 02:36:56.470
<v Speaker 2>So that was a sound.</v>

5592
02:36:56.471 --> 02:36:57.304
<v Speaker 2>A</v>

5593
02:36:58.360 --> 02:36:59.470
<v Speaker 2>sound amplifier.</v>

5594
02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5595
02:37:00.430 --> 02:37:02.050
<v Speaker 2>If someone's going to do time travel,</v>

5596
02:37:02.110 --> 02:37:03.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they would go to the Charlie Chaplin days.</v>

5597
02:37:04.220 --> 02:37:04.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5598
02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5599
02:37:05.330 --> 02:37:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Are they going to hang around here and do that for you?</v>

5600
02:37:07.361 --> 02:37:10.270
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if we did find out that some dude's been fucking traveling back in time</v>

5601
02:37:10.271 --> 02:37:11.590
<v Speaker 2>from the future and we get up to the future.</v>

5602
02:37:11.591 --> 02:37:12.424
<v Speaker 2>One day we meet him,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They can,</v>

5674
02:38:36.190 --> 02:38:37.210
<v Speaker 2>they can take your time away,</v>

5675
02:38:37.211 --> 02:38:39.250
<v Speaker 2>but they also give you the opportunity to do things.</v>

5676
02:38:39.251 --> 02:38:41.620
<v Speaker 2>It's up to you to decide what you do with your time.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's bad to be selfish.</v>

5682
02:38:46.191 --> 02:38:46.520
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>

5683
02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:46.671
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

5684
02:38:46.671 --> 02:38:47.121
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

5685
02:38:47.121 --> 02:38:49.880
<v Speaker 4>because if you're conservative yourself and what you're up to,</v>

5686
02:38:50.180 --> 02:38:50.440
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

5687
02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:54.080
<v Speaker 4>you turned out to be a better product for the other people around you and say,</v>

5688
02:38:54.110 --> 02:38:54.561
<v Speaker 4>Oh wow,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5691
02:38:58.450 --> 02:38:59.450
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird word though,</v>

5692
02:38:59.451 --> 02:39:00.690
<v Speaker 2>because when I think of southwest,</v>

5693
02:39:00.710 --> 02:39:01.401
<v Speaker 2>I think of like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>those movies where like people are trapped somewhere and it turns out one dude's</v>

5699
02:39:06.081 --> 02:39:07.940
<v Speaker 2>been hogging all the food and lying about it.</v>

5700
02:39:08.060 --> 02:39:09.230
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of selfish.</v>

02:39:11.480 --> 02:39:11.931
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

02:39:18.370 --> 02:39:19.203
<v Speaker 2>He runs away.</v>

02:39:21.820 --> 02:39:24.800
<v Speaker 2>And then you hear the people get killed by the monster and then you find out</v>

5719
02:39:28.100 --> 02:39:28.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

02:39:33.201 --> 02:39:35.710
<v Speaker 2>And some people are uncomfortable with other people concentrating on their</v>

5722
02:39:35.711 --> 02:39:36.440
<v Speaker 2>shelves.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like grams of sugar and like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>One of those sports drinks type things.</v>

5757
02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:24.470
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So it's like more sugar than he's supposed to have in a day.</v>

02:40:35.540 --> 02:40:36.690
<v Speaker 2>Well that's good.</v>

5774
02:40:45.841 --> 02:40:47.700
<v Speaker 2>but try to like when you buy the sugar,</v>

5775
02:40:47.701 --> 02:40:49.840

02:40:50.850 --> 02:40:51.570
<v Speaker 2>That's what the labels,</v>

5778
02:40:51.570 --> 02:40:53.310
<v Speaker 2>now that I understand that,</v>

5783
02:41:01.320 --> 02:41:03.120
<v Speaker 2>but your body doesn't want it like that.</v>

5784
02:41:03.121 --> 02:41:05.520
<v Speaker 2>Your body wants sugar that's attached to foods.</v>

5785
02:41:06.060 --> 02:41:07.280
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of yummy stuff.</v>

5786
02:41:07.330 --> 02:41:09.060
<v Speaker 2>That stuff I love.</v>

5787
02:41:09.330 --> 02:41:10.650
<v Speaker 2>Oranges didn't exist.</v>

5788
02:41:10.710 --> 02:41:11.101
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5792
02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:20.340
<v Speaker 2>like a real good ripe Florida orange when it was big plump ones with it's easy</v>

5796
02:41:23.700 --> 02:41:25.560
<v Speaker 2>It would be an extreme luxury.</v>

5797
02:41:25.620 --> 02:41:27.300
<v Speaker 2>It's so much better than caviar.</v>

5798
02:41:27.720 --> 02:41:29.280
<v Speaker 2>It's just caviars hard to get.</v>

5799
02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:31.680
<v Speaker 2>But caviar tastes like dog shit.</v>

5800
02:41:31.890 --> 02:41:32.580
<v Speaker 2>It's grow.</v>

5801
02:41:32.580 --> 02:41:33.510
<v Speaker 2>It's an acquired taste.</v>

5802
02:41:33.630 --> 02:41:37.020
<v Speaker 2>No one needs an acquired taste for oranges are delicious.</v>

5803
02:41:37.420 --> 02:41:38.340
<v Speaker 2>You like caviar,</v>

5804
02:41:38.790 --> 02:41:39.840
<v Speaker 2>you're one of those motherfuckers.</v>

5805
02:41:39.900 --> 02:41:42.240
<v Speaker 2>I used to live with them Russian people and I got a,</v>

5806
02:41:42.450 --> 02:41:43.620
<v Speaker 2>you acquired the taste.</v>

5807
02:41:43.621 --> 02:41:44.850
<v Speaker 2>I did acquire the taste,</v>

5808
02:41:44.910 --> 02:41:45.743
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

5809
02:41:45.990 --> 02:41:46.823
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

5810
02:41:46.900 --> 02:41:47.940
<v Speaker 2>I can appreciate the,</v>

5811
02:41:47.960 --> 02:41:48.793
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5812
02:41:49.110 --> 02:41:49.950
<v Speaker 2>nothing wrong with it.</v>

5813
02:41:49.951 --> 02:41:53.310
<v Speaker 2>But my point is the old orange is right there.</v>

5814
02:41:53.340 --> 02:41:54.030
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

5815
02:41:54.030 --> 02:41:54.863

02:41:55.020 --> 02:41:55.853
<v Speaker 2>Different.</v>

5817
02:41:56.070 --> 02:41:56.610
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

5818
02:41:56.610 --> 02:41:58.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a sophisticated palate that represents,</v>

5819
02:41:58.721 --> 02:42:01.440
<v Speaker 2>is recognize the subtleties of all caviar.</v>

5820
02:42:02.340 --> 02:42:05.430
<v Speaker 2>Caviar is from a very particular type of sturgeon.</v>

5821
02:42:06.270 --> 02:42:07.830
<v Speaker 2>I can't even tell if it's greed.</v>

5822
02:42:07.860 --> 02:42:10.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean if it's black or the red or whatever is a,</v>

5823
02:42:10.330 --> 02:42:12.720
<v Speaker 2>it's all tastes kind of like the same dummy stock shit.</v>

5824
02:42:12.740 --> 02:42:13.573
<v Speaker 2>It's like wine.</v>

5825
02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:14.700
<v Speaker 2>I never used to.</v>

5826
02:42:14.700 --> 02:42:16.380
<v Speaker 2>I know like I can't really tell the difference.</v>

5827
02:42:16.410 --> 02:42:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh this tastes like a wine,</v>

5828
02:42:18.031 --> 02:42:18.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5829
02:42:18.580 --> 02:42:20.370
<v Speaker 2>he's good one like wanting to taste good.</v>

5830
02:42:20.371 --> 02:42:21.204
<v Speaker 2>I just don't,</v>

5831
02:42:21.270 --> 02:42:24.510
<v Speaker 2>it's a good to a Somalia that is a real job.</v>

5832
02:42:24.600 --> 02:42:27.630
<v Speaker 2>Like someone who actually understands why I let the guys who are really good at</v>

5833
02:42:27.631 --> 02:42:27.751
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

5834
02:42:27.751 --> 02:42:28.321
<v Speaker 2>they really,</v>

5835
02:42:28.321 --> 02:42:29.160
<v Speaker 2>it really is an art.</v>

5836
02:42:29.340 --> 02:42:30.750
<v Speaker 2>It's weird out and stuff.</v>

5837
02:42:30.751 --> 02:42:31.950
<v Speaker 2>They don't even swallow it this.</v>

5838
02:42:31.960 --> 02:42:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise they'd get fucked up if they could tell what it is by swirling and or</v>

5839
02:42:36.300 --> 02:42:37.630
<v Speaker 2>somehow in their mouth they,</v>

5840
02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:38.340
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5841
02:42:38.340 --> 02:42:41.940
<v Speaker 2>well that you still get drunk but you get drunk less quick than if you drink it</v>

5842
02:42:41.941 --> 02:42:42.450
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

5843
02:42:42.450 --> 02:42:42.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5844
02:42:42.850 --> 02:42:44.490
<v Speaker 2>it tastes good and your tongue,</v>

5845
02:42:44.620 --> 02:42:45.453
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

5846
02:42:46.050 --> 02:42:47.100
<v Speaker 2>some of them drink it though.</v>

5847
02:42:47.160 --> 02:42:50.730
<v Speaker 2>They just go old school and get that fucking Orson Welles potbelly and keep</v>

5848
02:42:50.731 --> 02:42:55.731
<v Speaker 2>rocking it and can keep it in Sonoma hard every year fucking pound that.</v>

5849
02:42:56.430 --> 02:42:57.870
<v Speaker 2>That's Santa Ynez wine.</v>

5850
02:42:58.280 --> 02:42:58.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5851
02:42:58.590 --> 02:42:59.430
<v Speaker 2>I never gone on one of those.</v>

5852
02:42:59.750 --> 02:43:00.583
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5853

5854
02:43:01.891 --> 02:43:02.071
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

5855
02:43:02.071 --> 02:43:02.400

02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:02.840
<v Speaker 2>Brian's,</v>

5857
02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:03.673
<v Speaker 2>it's great.</v>

5858
02:43:03.780 --> 02:43:04.380
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>

5859
02:43:04.380 --> 02:43:07.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be around a bunch of stinky drunks pretending to be cultured</v>

5860
02:43:07.980 --> 02:43:09.150
<v Speaker 2>wherein you fucking boat shoes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Get away from me dudes with those</v>

5862
02:43:12.070 --> 02:43:12.851
<v Speaker 5>moccasins,</v>

02:43:12.851 --> 02:43:13.630
<v Speaker 5>with the fucking,</v>

5864
02:43:13.630 --> 02:43:18.630
<v Speaker 5>those weird yellow shoe laces in their moccasins.</v>

5865
02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:19.931
<v Speaker 5>Get out of here man.</v>

02:43:21.191 --> 02:43:21.790
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

5868
02:43:21.790 --> 02:43:22.623
<v Speaker 5>Those weird things.</v>

5869
02:43:22.840 --> 02:43:23.530
<v Speaker 5>I know what you're doing.</v>

5870
02:43:23.530 --> 02:43:25.990
<v Speaker 5>Get asked to do gigs down there at the Gainey winery.</v>

5871
02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:27.100
<v Speaker 5>Gainey want you heard of that?</v>

5872
02:43:27.310 --> 02:43:27.940
<v Speaker 5>Gigs?</v>

5873
02:43:27.940 --> 02:43:29.380
<v Speaker 5>Abandoned it shows.</v>

5874
02:43:29.660 --> 02:43:30.493
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5875
02:43:30.670 --> 02:43:31.510
<v Speaker 5>Gainey winery.</v>

5876
02:43:31.780 --> 02:43:32.920
<v Speaker 5>They have gigs at a winery.</v>

5877
02:43:32.930 --> 02:43:33.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5878
02:43:33.400 --> 02:43:33.821
<v Speaker 5>Outside.</v>

5879
02:43:33.821 --> 02:43:34.421
<v Speaker 5>It was to be fun.</v>

5880
02:43:34.421 --> 02:43:36.190
<v Speaker 5>Like a party or we're running out of time.</v>

5881
02:43:36.220 --> 02:43:36.531
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

5882
02:43:36.531 --> 02:43:36.880
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5883
02:43:36.880 --> 02:43:37.810
<v Speaker 5>let's talk about,</v>

5884
02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:38.051
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5885
02:43:38.051 --> 02:43:38.320
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

5886
02:43:38.320 --> 02:43:38.590
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

5887
02:43:38.590 --> 02:43:41.560
<v Speaker 5>your tank center and the new place that you guys are doing and what's the</v>

5888
02:43:41.561 --> 02:43:45.520
<v Speaker 5>difference between what you're doing and what the,</v>

5889
02:43:45.830 --> 02:43:49.300
<v Speaker 5>a lot of these commercial places that are using these home tanks?</v>

5890
02:43:49.720 --> 02:43:50.361
<v Speaker 5>We have a,</v>

5891
02:43:50.361 --> 02:43:51.400
<v Speaker 5>there's a real problem with that,</v>

5892
02:43:51.401 --> 02:43:51.700
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

5893
02:43:51.700 --> 02:43:56.700
<v Speaker 5>As far as like infections and far as safety and as far as like everything needs</v>

5894
02:43:56.801 --> 02:43:58.180
<v Speaker 5>to be moved to a higher standard.</v>

5895
02:43:58.990 --> 02:44:02.020
<v Speaker 5>That's a certainly our opinion of the situation.</v>

5896
02:44:02.021 --> 02:44:02.321
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5897
02:44:02.321 --> 02:44:02.530
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

5898
02:44:02.530 --> 02:44:03.550
<v Speaker 5>we've been working with,</v>

5899
02:44:03.580 --> 02:44:03.931
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5900
02:44:03.931 --> 02:44:07.130
<v Speaker 5>like with the NSF and the other state and local authorities tend to uh,</v>

5901
02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:12.760
<v Speaker 5>get in tune with what's required as far as rules and regulations as far as</v>

5902
02:44:12.761 --> 02:44:13.810
<v Speaker 5>testing the water.</v>

5903
02:44:13.811 --> 02:44:15.670
<v Speaker 5>And that's our certification.</v>

5904
02:44:15.730 --> 02:44:16.960
<v Speaker 5>We've been certified for that.</v>

5905
02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:18.940
<v Speaker 5>Whichever three log kill what they call,</v>

5906
02:44:18.941 --> 02:44:22.810
<v Speaker 5>which said 99.9 of all the microorganisms that are in fact they in fact the</v>

5907
02:44:22.811 --> 02:44:23.644
<v Speaker 5>water.</v>

5908
02:44:23.680 --> 02:44:26.590
<v Speaker 5>Then they see how long it takes to eradicate this infection.</v>

5909
02:44:26.680 --> 02:44:29.320
<v Speaker 5>And obviously this is a big difference between someone who just has one that's</v>

5910
02:44:29.321 --> 02:44:30.160
<v Speaker 5>only for them,</v>

5911
02:44:30.190 --> 02:44:31.570
<v Speaker 5>only for their own personal use,</v>

5912
02:44:31.840 --> 02:44:35.320
<v Speaker 5>which is like a lot of these more low end ones and someone who is running a</v>

5913
02:44:35.321 --> 02:44:38.260
<v Speaker 5>commercial business sort of like the difference between your home pool and your</v>

5914
02:44:38.261 --> 02:44:39.094
<v Speaker 5>swimming pool.</v>

5915
02:44:39.670 --> 02:44:40.660
<v Speaker 5>I always like to say,</v>

5916
02:44:40.661 --> 02:44:41.051
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5917
02:44:41.051 --> 02:44:41.491
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

5918
02:44:41.491 --> 02:44:41.870
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5919
02:44:41.870 --> 02:44:42.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5920
02:44:42.520 --> 02:44:44.500
<v Speaker 5>opening a restaurant with an easy bake oven,</v>

5921
02:44:44.930 --> 02:44:45.190
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5922
02:44:45.190 --> 02:44:48.100
<v Speaker 5>it isn't appropriate for appropriate.</v>

5923
02:44:48.310 --> 02:44:50.500
<v Speaker 5>This is not up to us to decide anyway.</v>

5924
02:44:50.770 --> 02:44:55.770
<v Speaker 5>All is we've had to do is adhere to these standards and codes that have been set</v>

5925
02:44:56.231 --> 02:45:00.910
<v Speaker 5>up by realistic people that that understand and you've helped with these,</v>

5926
02:45:00.911 --> 02:45:02.320
<v Speaker 5>the setting up the standards and codes.</v>

5927
02:45:02.321 --> 02:45:04.000
<v Speaker 5>So losing a very important thing for you.</v>

5928
02:45:04.001 --> 02:45:04.211
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

5929
02:45:04.211 --> 02:45:04.931
<v Speaker 5>Super important.</v>

5930
02:45:04.931 --> 02:45:08.140
<v Speaker 5>It's more important to us than anything else is this disinfection,</v>

5931
02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:13.560
<v Speaker 5>this ability to disinfect this w the solution correctly between usages because</v>

5932
02:45:14.110 --> 02:45:16.270
<v Speaker 5>we don't use chemicals and we're all tested,</v>

5933
02:45:16.690 --> 02:45:17.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5934
02:45:17.410 --> 02:45:18.610
<v Speaker 5>to do this three log,</v>

5935
02:45:18.611 --> 02:45:20.500
<v Speaker 5>we actually did a seven log in a vessel.</v>

5936
02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:23.230
<v Speaker 5>The vessel itself generally contaminates the specimen,</v>

5937
02:45:23.231 --> 02:45:26.920
<v Speaker 5>but we have such a small body of water in such an intense system there of</v>

5938
02:45:26.921 --> 02:45:27.930
<v Speaker 5>cleaning that uh,</v>

5939
02:45:28.270 --> 02:45:32.710
<v Speaker 5>they tested the material in the vessel and we still got the three log and then</v>

5940
02:45:32.711 --> 02:45:33.610
<v Speaker 5>surpass that.</v>

5941
02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:37.150
<v Speaker 5>But that's within one cleaning cycle without any of the use of chemicals.</v>

5942
02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:38.740
<v Speaker 5>The problem with chemicals now,</v>

5943
02:45:38.741 --> 02:45:41.410
<v Speaker 5>which is what everybody else has to do due to the fact that they don't or</v>

5944
02:45:41.411 --> 02:45:44.980
<v Speaker 5>unwilling to spend the money on the disinfection process,</v>

5945
02:45:44.981 --> 02:45:49.960
<v Speaker 5>which is this I told you about this UV lights like nine grand if 7,500 for the</v>

5946
02:45:49.990 --> 02:45:50.741
<v Speaker 5>generators.</v>

5947
02:45:50.741 --> 02:45:53.170
<v Speaker 5>And so it's a lot of bread to get it right man.</v>

5948
02:45:53.171 --> 02:45:53.381
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5949
02:45:53.381 --> 02:45:54.860
<v Speaker 5>and the electrical stuff,</v>

5950
02:45:54.861 --> 02:45:56.470
<v Speaker 5>see our UL listing as well.</v>

5951
02:45:56.650 --> 02:45:57.760
<v Speaker 5>Underwriters Laboratory,</v>

5952
02:45:57.761 --> 02:46:00.400

5953
02:46:00.430 --> 02:46:02.320
<v Speaker 5>you're in a water and electricity,</v>

5954
02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:02.951
<v Speaker 5>you can't,</v>

5955
02:46:02.951 --> 02:46:03.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5956
02:46:03.440 --> 02:46:04.030
<v Speaker 5>Eh,</v>

5957
02:46:04.030 --> 02:46:07.300
<v Speaker 5>scooter McGee said it's okay or shifty Williams over here.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean we've heard his story,</v>

5965
02:46:16.161 --> 02:46:18.320
<v Speaker 4>but the facts are the facts.</v>

5966
02:46:18.321 --> 02:46:23.310
<v Speaker 4>You need to go into a laboratory and evaluate the situation correctly.</v>

5967
02:46:23.311 --> 02:46:24.160
<v Speaker 4>We utilizing,</v>

5968
02:46:24.420 --> 02:46:24.680
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5969
02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:25.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5970
02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:25.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5971
02:46:25.550 --> 02:46:27.700
<v Speaker 4>methods of that are there ethical,</v>

5972
02:46:27.710 --> 02:46:27.981
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

5973
02:46:27.981 --> 02:46:28.814
<v Speaker 4>not</v>

5974
02:46:29.810 --> 02:46:30.650
<v Speaker 4>pouring this,</v>

5975
02:46:30.651 --> 02:46:31.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5976
02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:31.971
<v Speaker 4>chemicals,</v>

5977
02:46:31.971 --> 02:46:35.780
<v Speaker 4>the chlorine and bromine and or whatever it is you're pointing as a breaking</v>

5978
02:46:35.781 --> 02:46:36.201
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

5979
02:46:36.201 --> 02:46:37.130
<v Speaker 4>Now this,</v>

5980
02:46:37.131 --> 02:46:40.880
<v Speaker 4>this material and then creating a biproduct is biproduct.</v>

5981
02:46:40.881 --> 02:46:41.930
<v Speaker 4>Then you know,</v>

5982
02:46:41.931 --> 02:46:45.200
<v Speaker 4>you're getting in there with it and you're sweating or pissing or spinning or</v>

5983
02:46:45.201 --> 02:46:47.090
<v Speaker 4>whatever and then you're mixing you with this,</v>

5984
02:46:47.130 --> 02:46:47.471
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5985
02:46:47.471 --> 02:46:48.710
<v Speaker 4>the ammonia nitrogen</v>

5986
02:46:49.330 --> 02:46:50.011
<v Speaker 1>more of an issue with,</v>

5987
02:46:50.011 --> 02:46:51.120
<v Speaker 1>when I talked to him about the tank,</v>

5988
02:46:51.150 --> 02:46:51.871
<v Speaker 1>they always say that like,</v>

5989
02:46:51.871 --> 02:46:53.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get in the water that someone else has been in</v>

5990
02:46:53.840 --> 02:46:54.501
<v Speaker 4>fucking weird.</v>

5991
02:46:54.501 --> 02:46:55.760
<v Speaker 4>It should have an issue with it.</v>

5992
02:46:55.761 --> 02:46:56.870
<v Speaker 4>There is an issue with it.</v>

5993
02:46:56.890 --> 02:46:57.723
<v Speaker 4>It is like,</v>

5994
02:46:57.800 --> 02:46:58.041
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5995
02:46:58.041 --> 02:47:00.050
<v Speaker 4>if these things are not dealt with properly,</v>

5996
02:47:00.051 --> 02:47:00.680
<v Speaker 4>they're there,</v>

5997
02:47:00.680 --> 02:47:01.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5998
02:47:01.100 --> 02:47:02.750
<v Speaker 4>it's an infestation</v>

5999
02:47:03.280 --> 02:47:05.510
<v Speaker 1>and as the popularity these things grows,</v>

6000
02:47:05.540 --> 02:47:08.630
<v Speaker 1>this is something we really need to consider because this is something that</v>

6001
02:47:08.631 --> 02:47:10.400
<v Speaker 1>could become an issue for some folks.</v>

6002
02:47:10.610 --> 02:47:12.810
<v Speaker 1>And I know that you're very conscientious about this.</v>

6003
02:47:12.811 --> 02:47:15.740
<v Speaker 1>This is very important to you and this is like one of the main focuses of</v>

6004
02:47:15.741 --> 02:47:17.360
<v Speaker 1>conversation that we've had over the years,</v>

6005
02:47:17.361 --> 02:47:18.290
<v Speaker 1>is about this,</v>

6006
02:47:18.380 --> 02:47:22.040
<v Speaker 1>this need to make sure that everything is like at the same standards of the</v>

6007
02:47:22.041 --> 02:47:22.874
<v Speaker 1>tanks that you have.</v>

6008
02:47:22.960 --> 02:47:27.250
<v Speaker 4>It's important for the people that are doing this to have a product,</v>

6009
02:47:27.251 --> 02:47:31.840
<v Speaker 4>then that is a credible that has been designed correctly,</v>

6010
02:47:31.841 --> 02:47:34.630
<v Speaker 4>that's had a lot of time and effort spent to uh,</v>

6011
02:47:35.170 --> 02:47:39.340
<v Speaker 4>to verify how it actually works and what it does and now,</v>

6012
02:47:39.341 --> 02:47:39.930
<v Speaker 4>and then,</v>

6013
02:47:39.930 --> 02:47:40.290
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6014
02:47:40.290 --> 02:47:41.030
<v Speaker 4>does all the harm,</v>

6015
02:47:41.030 --> 02:47:42.250
<v Speaker 4>all the good and none of the harm.</v>

6016
02:47:42.280 --> 02:47:42.730
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

6017
02:47:42.730 --> 02:47:44.140
<v Speaker 4>And it's all the potential harm out,</v>

6018
02:47:44.170 --> 02:47:47.070
<v Speaker 4>all checked out and know and documented and,</v>

6019
02:47:47.071 --> 02:47:47.340
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

6020
02:47:47.340 --> 02:47:49.030
<v Speaker 4>and then like I said,</v>

6021
02:47:49.031 --> 02:47:50.440
<v Speaker 4>this is new one UL stuff too.</v>

6022
02:47:50.441 --> 02:47:51.274
<v Speaker 4>The amount of,</v>

6023
02:47:52.620 --> 02:47:53.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6024
02:47:53.090 --> 02:47:56.980
<v Speaker 4>adjustments that we've had to do with the electrical aspects of these thing are</v>

6025
02:47:56.981 --> 02:47:57.814
<v Speaker 4>tremendous,</v>

6026
02:47:57.820 --> 02:47:58.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6027
02:47:58.470 --> 02:47:59.370
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>

6028
02:47:59.470 --> 02:48:00.190
<v Speaker 4>by the time we're all,</v>

6029
02:48:00.190 --> 02:48:00.941
<v Speaker 4>we've been working with them,</v>

6030
02:48:00.941 --> 02:48:01.271
<v Speaker 4>whatnot,</v>

6031
02:48:01.271 --> 02:48:03.940
<v Speaker 4>four years with NSF to try to,</v>

6032
02:48:03.941 --> 02:48:04.720
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6033
02:48:04.720 --> 02:48:07.270
<v Speaker 4>established these guidelines then for,</v>

6034
02:48:07.690 --> 02:48:08.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6035
02:48:08.230 --> 02:48:09.063
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6036
02:48:09.370 --> 02:48:10.270
<v Speaker 4>effective,</v>

6037
02:48:10.450 --> 02:48:11.283
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6038
02:48:11.290 --> 02:48:12.040
<v Speaker 4>purification.</v>

6039
02:48:12.040 --> 02:48:12.611
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

6040
02:48:12.611 --> 02:48:14.320
<v Speaker 4>too for people then to do this.</v>

6041
02:48:14.321 --> 02:48:17.920
<v Speaker 4>Because if you don't have it and people come away from it with a bad,</v>

6042
02:48:17.950 --> 02:48:18.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6043
02:48:18.610 --> 02:48:19.990
<v Speaker 4>how long is it going to last?</v>

6044
02:48:19.991 --> 02:48:21.250
<v Speaker 4>The industry,</v>

6045
02:48:21.280 --> 02:48:21.671
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6046
02:48:21.671 --> 02:48:21.831
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

6047
02:48:21.831 --> 02:48:26.380
<v Speaker 4>it needs to have guidelines and standards set up to adhere to then to become a</v>

6048
02:48:26.381 --> 02:48:27.214
<v Speaker 4>credible,</v>

6049
02:48:27.490 --> 02:48:27.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6050
02:48:27.761 --> 02:48:28.460
<v Speaker 4>industry.</v>

6051
02:48:28.460 --> 02:48:28.641
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6052
02:48:28.641 --> 02:48:30.290
<v Speaker 1>I commend the fact also that you're,</v>

6053
02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:30.740
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

6054
02:48:30.740 --> 02:48:33.350
<v Speaker 1>you're meeting it head on before it becomes a big issue.</v>

6055
02:48:33.380 --> 02:48:36.170
<v Speaker 1>Like there's not a lot of people that are reporting like infections and lot a</v>

6056
02:48:36.171 --> 02:48:38.360
<v Speaker 1>lot of people that have become sick because of it.</v>

6057
02:48:38.990 --> 02:48:41.240
<v Speaker 1>But if this industry continues to grow,</v>

6058
02:48:41.390 --> 02:48:45.440
<v Speaker 1>the potential instances of people not taking care of the water can rise and that</v>

6059
02:48:45.441 --> 02:48:47.080
<v Speaker 1>could potentially damage there.</v>

6060
02:48:47.090 --> 02:48:51.320
<v Speaker 1>The reputation that you fought so hard to try to let people know about the</v>

6061
02:48:51.321 --> 02:48:53.120
<v Speaker 1>positive benefits of this.</v>

6062
02:48:53.121 --> 02:48:53.380
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>

6063
02:48:53.380 --> 02:48:53.901
<v Speaker 1>I know you,</v>

6064
02:48:53.901 --> 02:48:55.340
<v Speaker 1>you've been working on this for a long time,</v>

6065
02:48:55.341 --> 02:48:56.040
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6066
02:48:56.040 --> 02:48:57.110
<v Speaker 1>It's catching on now,</v>

6067
02:48:57.111 --> 02:48:57.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6068
02:48:57.540 --> 02:48:57.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6069
02:48:57.930 --> 02:48:58.171
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

6070
02:48:58.171 --> 02:48:58.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6071
02:48:58.440 --> 02:48:58.591
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

6072
02:48:58.591 --> 02:48:58.911
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

6073
02:48:58.911 --> 02:48:59.131
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

6074
02:48:59.131 --> 02:49:01.380
<v Speaker 4>it's been something I've been dedicated to with,</v>

6075
02:49:01.530 --> 02:49:02.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6076
02:49:02.280 --> 02:49:03.113
<v Speaker 4>all of my,</v>

6077
02:49:03.750 --> 02:49:04.650
<v Speaker 4>everything I have,</v>

6078
02:49:04.680 --> 02:49:05.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6079
02:49:05.100 --> 02:49:07.530
<v Speaker 4>it's been involved in trying to get right.</v>

6080
02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:08.450
<v Speaker 4>Cause it's,</v>

6081
02:49:08.450 --> 02:49:09.420
<v Speaker 4>it's important,</v>

6082
02:49:09.480 --> 02:49:09.871
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6083
02:49:09.871 --> 02:49:10.320
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

6084
02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:11.153
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6085
02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:13.920
<v Speaker 4>that this technology is not overlooked right now.</v>

6086
02:49:13.950 --> 02:49:14.940
<v Speaker 4>We need to get ahold.</v>

6087
02:49:15.150 --> 02:49:15.760
<v Speaker 4>You seen if it,</v>

6088
02:49:15.760 --> 02:49:19.000
<v Speaker 4>if it's set up with these little Mickey mouse second rate rigs,</v>

6089
02:49:19.450 --> 02:49:21.090
<v Speaker 4>the authorities are not going to,</v>

6090
02:49:21.091 --> 02:49:21.720
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

6091
02:49:21.720 --> 02:49:23.220
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to allow it.</v>

6092
02:49:23.250 --> 02:49:23.851
<v Speaker 4>We've already been,</v>

6093
02:49:23.851 --> 02:49:24.870
<v Speaker 4>but they allow it right now.</v>

6094
02:49:25.280 --> 02:49:26.370
<v Speaker 4>Now it's unregulated.</v>

6095
02:49:26.390 --> 02:49:26.681
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

6096
02:49:26.681 --> 02:49:28.280
<v Speaker 4>so it's going to eventually be regular.</v>

6097
02:49:28.490 --> 02:49:29.040
<v Speaker 4>So low.</v>

6098
02:49:29.040 --> 02:49:29.850
<v Speaker 4>That's what this,</v>

6099
02:49:29.850 --> 02:49:30.720
<v Speaker 4>we showed you this,</v>

6100
02:49:30.840 --> 02:49:31.160
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

6101
02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:31.501
<v Speaker 4>Well I know,</v>

6102
02:49:31.501 --> 02:49:33.030
<v Speaker 4>but people that are listening,</v>

6103
02:49:33.270 --> 02:49:34.530
<v Speaker 4>when is this all going to take place?</v>

6104
02:49:34.560 --> 02:49:35.550
<v Speaker 4>It's happening now.</v>

6105
02:49:35.551 --> 02:49:36.010
<v Speaker 4>We were on,</v>

6106
02:49:36.010 --> 02:49:39.780
<v Speaker 4>we have a task group that's been formed with both the Canadian Ministry of</v>

6107
02:49:39.780 --> 02:49:43.710
<v Speaker 4>Health and several health and safety officials here in this country.</v>

6108
02:49:43.980 --> 02:49:48.480
<v Speaker 4>Statewise local ys and NSF national sanitization foundation to set up these</v>

6109
02:49:48.481 --> 02:49:49.314
<v Speaker 4>guidelines.</v>

6110
02:49:49.380 --> 02:49:53.790
<v Speaker 4>So they're realizing that this industry growing and they're stepping in.</v>

6111
02:49:53.820 --> 02:49:54.630
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

6112
02:49:54.630 --> 02:49:55.261
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

6113
02:49:55.261 --> 02:49:55.891
<v Speaker 4>We were at a,</v>

6114
02:49:55.891 --> 02:49:56.630
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6115
02:49:56.630 --> 02:49:57.900
<v Speaker 4>a a task group.</v>

6116
02:49:58.080 --> 02:49:58.950
<v Speaker 4>What was that thing called?</v>

6117
02:49:58.951 --> 02:49:59.784
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

6118
02:50:00.750 --> 02:50:04.950
<v Speaker 4>we went to a thing and they had callers calling in.</v>

6119
02:50:04.951 --> 02:50:08.220
<v Speaker 4>It was the most asked about subject,</v>

6120
02:50:08.221 --> 02:50:10.590
<v Speaker 4>a topic that they had conversated about at this,</v>

6121
02:50:10.591 --> 02:50:11.850
<v Speaker 4>it was called a task.</v>

6122
02:50:11.880 --> 02:50:12.720
<v Speaker 4>What was the meeting call?</v>

6123
02:50:12.730 --> 02:50:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that it's possible for you to make two different tanks to make a</v>

6124
02:50:16.181 --> 02:50:21.181
<v Speaker 1>commercial fully sanitize unit and make a unit for the home that's less complex</v>

6125
02:50:21.610 --> 02:50:22.660
<v Speaker 1>and more affordable?</v>

6126
02:50:22.710 --> 02:50:25.860
<v Speaker 4>We see what you were thinking about that because naturally that would be a good</v>

6127
02:50:25.861 --> 02:50:26.930
<v Speaker 4>business sense.</v>

6128
02:50:26.940 --> 02:50:28.860
<v Speaker 4>But we got back to the point again,</v>

6129
02:50:28.861 --> 02:50:31.110
<v Speaker 4>it's like in order to do it right,</v>

6130
02:50:31.230 --> 02:50:32.370
<v Speaker 4>this is what it costs.</v>

6131
02:50:32.371 --> 02:50:32.671
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6132
02:50:32.671 --> 02:50:34.650
<v Speaker 4>we could make it Mickey mouse or whatever,</v>

6133
02:50:34.830 --> 02:50:36.600
<v Speaker 1>but is it Mickey mouse for the consumer?</v>

6134
02:50:36.601 --> 02:50:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Like say if it's just you a quick crash lives by himself,</v>

6135
02:50:39.481 --> 02:50:39.831
<v Speaker 1>crashed,</v>

6136
02:50:39.831 --> 02:50:41.160
<v Speaker 1>loves to do the isolation tank,</v>

6137
02:50:41.580 --> 02:50:43.440
<v Speaker 1>not gonna jerk off or penis tank.</v>

6138
02:50:43.650 --> 02:50:44.401
<v Speaker 1>Or if I do,</v>

6139
02:50:44.401 --> 02:50:45.570
<v Speaker 1>I'll be in there with myself.</v>

6140
02:50:46.540 --> 02:50:46.700
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

6141
02:50:46.700 --> 02:50:47.241
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

6142
02:50:47.241 --> 02:50:48.074
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

6143
02:50:48.910 --> 02:50:49.190
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

6144
02:50:49.190 --> 02:50:49.910
<v Speaker 4>he's right.</v>

6145
02:50:49.910 --> 02:50:53.180
<v Speaker 4>But if you're going into some place and it's these people in those,</v>

6146
02:50:53.290 --> 02:50:53.901
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

6147
02:50:53.901 --> 02:50:54.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6148
02:50:54.670 --> 02:50:58.610
<v Speaker 4>and then what's happening then what we were doing was trying to,</v>

6149
02:50:58.640 --> 02:50:59.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6150
02:50:59.330 --> 02:50:59.990
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

6151
02:50:59.990 --> 02:51:00.823
<v Speaker 4>they're cheap,</v>

6152
02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:01.510
<v Speaker 4>so they're gonna,</v>

6153
02:51:01.510 --> 02:51:01.781
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

6154
02:51:01.781 --> 02:51:06.670
<v Speaker 1>I'll buy it while people are broke to fucking super expensive to buy one of</v>

6155
02:51:06.680 --> 02:51:07.060
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

6156
02:51:07.060 --> 02:51:07.893
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>

6157
02:51:08.320 --> 02:51:13.060
<v Speaker 1>I know that the equipment is really costly and it's really high end,</v>

6158
02:51:13.270 --> 02:51:15.820
<v Speaker 1>but all I'm trying to say is with our last five minutes of time,</v>

6159
02:51:15.821 --> 02:51:16.870
<v Speaker 1>before we turn into a Pumpkin,</v>

6160
02:51:17.080 --> 02:51:17.913
<v Speaker 1>all I'm trying to say is,</v>

6161
02:51:17.920 --> 02:51:20.090
<v Speaker 1>is it possible that it's,</v>

6162
02:51:20.160 --> 02:51:22.600
<v Speaker 1>it could be made into a consumer unit.</v>

6163
02:51:22.800 --> 02:51:23.251
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

6164
02:51:23.251 --> 02:51:23.671
<v Speaker 4>it would be.</v>

6165
02:51:23.671 --> 02:51:28.671
<v Speaker 4>But back to the liability in order to get this right and not harm anybody,</v>

6166
02:51:29.011 --> 02:51:29.950
<v Speaker 4>buy this con,</v>

6167
02:51:30.030 --> 02:51:30.331
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6168
02:51:30.331 --> 02:51:31.200
<v Speaker 4>different things.</v>

6169
02:51:31.390 --> 02:51:31.630
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

6170
02:51:31.630 --> 02:51:31.970
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

6171
02:51:31.970 --> 02:51:33.120
<v Speaker 4>it's not easy.</v>

6172
02:51:33.150 --> 02:51:34.200
<v Speaker 4>Like he's telling you</v>

6173
02:51:34.320 --> 02:51:36.360
<v Speaker 1>how much more do you have to say about this stuff?</v>

6174
02:51:36.361 --> 02:51:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to do another hour when to shut this off and do another hour?</v>

6175
02:51:39.420 --> 02:51:40.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6176
02:51:40.010 --> 02:51:42.060
<v Speaker 1>do you cool to talk about this or are you running out of gas?</v>

6177
02:51:42.090 --> 02:51:43.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm not running out of gas.</v>

6178
02:51:43.201 --> 02:51:44.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't run out of gas.</v>

6179
02:51:44.110 --> 02:51:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

6180
02:51:44.760 --> 02:51:45.900
<v Speaker 1>Let's just wrap this up because this is,</v>

6181
02:51:45.901 --> 02:51:46.770
<v Speaker 1>we're running out of time,</v>

6182
02:51:47.060 --> 02:51:47.761
<v Speaker 1>so we'll wrap this up.</v>

6183
02:51:47.761 --> 02:51:49.500
<v Speaker 1>We'll be right back in about 10 more minutes.</v>

6184
02:51:49.620 --> 02:51:51.540
<v Speaker 1>So I have nine minutes.</v>

6185
02:51:52.120 --> 02:51:53.220
<v Speaker 1>I was giving you an extra,</v>

6186
02:51:54.160 --> 02:51:54.961
<v Speaker 1>an extra five minutes.</v>

6187
02:51:54.961 --> 02:51:55.561
<v Speaker 1>We'll wrap it up.</v>

6188
02:51:55.561 --> 02:51:56.790
<v Speaker 1>We'll wrap it up and we'll come right back.</v>

6189
02:51:57.240 --> 02:51:57.660
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

6190
02:51:57.660 --> 02:51:58.081
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6191
02:51:58.081 --> 02:51:58.651
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

6197

6200
02:52:14.081 --> 02:52:16.570
<v Speaker 5>but it'll probably be like 40 minutes.</v>

6201
02:52:17.170 --> 02:52:18.040
<v Speaker 5>That's what I recommend.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I recommend another 40 minutes.</v>
