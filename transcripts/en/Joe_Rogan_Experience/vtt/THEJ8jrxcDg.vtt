<v Speaker 1>Train by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Where's Shane Carwyn going?</v>

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Shane Carlin's going Arisun.</v>

4
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.613
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:09.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.620
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't take it no more.</v>

7
00:00:11.621 --> 00:00:12.370
<v Speaker 1>The silence.</v>

8
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.761
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

9
00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:13.570
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

10
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.180
<v Speaker 1>I guess he wants to have some fun while he's still shame.</v>

11
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.310
<v Speaker 1>Carwyn I salute that he could still hit harder than McKinney did.</v>

12
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that Jason Ellis fight?</v>

13
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Do you see what crazy Jason Ellis did?</v>

14
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Jay Snell is fought.</v>

15
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Shane Carwyn with one hand tied up.</v>

16
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.581
<v Speaker 1>Shane.</v>

17
00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Karlyn had his right hand tied up to his body and so Jason,</v>

18
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:32.291
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

19
00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:33.790
<v Speaker 1>you don't realize how big Shane Carwyn is.</v>

20
00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Like Jason Nelson is not the tiniest guy.</v>

21
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.071
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

22
00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:37.510
<v Speaker 1>he's probably about 200 pounds.</v>

23
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Who any stand next to Shane Carwyn.</v>

24
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.040
<v Speaker 1>It is almost comical how it look at this.</v>

25
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Look how big car one is.</v>

26
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.883
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

27
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.030
<v Speaker 1>he's a giant.</v>

28
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.910
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking giant and he's got one arm tied up.</v>

29
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.850
<v Speaker 1>Look at this and he looks good dude.</v>

30
00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Like physically,</v>

31
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.890
<v Speaker 1>he looks jacked.</v>

32
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Like he hasn't fought in a while,</v>

33
00:00:56.541 --> 00:00:58.130
<v Speaker 1>but obviously he's been working out.</v>

34
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean he looks better than he did the did the last time I saw him,</v>

35
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.900
<v Speaker 1>the last time I saw him,</v>

36
00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:06.560
<v Speaker 1>he was a recovering from some injuries and he was still in the UFC.</v>

37
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.990
<v Speaker 1>So apparently he's a free agent and I think,</v>

38
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:12.920
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

40
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.560
<v Speaker 1>he's fighting for rise and I'm pretty sure,</v>

41
00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:15.801
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

42
00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:17.480
<v Speaker 1>I know we put it on his Instagram page,</v>

43
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.680
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

44
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.690
<v Speaker 1>he k man,</v>

45
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.590
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

46
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.770
<v Speaker 1>it's really kind of wrong.</v>

47
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.183
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

48
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:26.241
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

49
00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:26.930
<v Speaker 1>that was one,</v>

50
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.040
<v Speaker 1>that was one punch.</v>

51
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Did he hit him with that wasn't even though the punch at that k Odom is it?</v>

52
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.341
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

53
00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:36.640
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

54
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.340
<v Speaker 1>that was like at the end of around,</v>

55
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.183
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

56
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.100
<v Speaker 1>see this is where it k Odom right here.</v>

57
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.270
<v Speaker 1>So that was the second one.</v>

58
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean that one really Kayo and I'm like,</v>

59
00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:50.110
<v Speaker 1>you could see when he was down he was like,</v>

60
00:01:50.111 --> 00:01:51.340
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

61
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean that guy is so God damn big.</v>

62
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Carlin's a gigantic human.</v>

63
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.690
<v Speaker 1>So they were talking about setting him up with,</v>

64
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.330
<v Speaker 1>or like fate or versus car when,</v>

65
00:02:01.331 --> 00:02:02.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's gonna happen,</v>

66
00:02:02.381 --> 00:02:03.190
<v Speaker 1>but if that does,</v>

67
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.023
<v Speaker 1>I'm in,</v>

68
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.283
<v Speaker 1>I'm in,</v>

69
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm paying to see that that's a dangerous fight for faith for dangerous fires.</v>

70
00:02:11.651 --> 00:02:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

71
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:12.783
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>

72
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.050
<v Speaker 1>it's essentially the same guy who was a charge of a pride for awhile.</v>

73
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.901
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

75
00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:20.734
<v Speaker 1>I believe so.</v>

76
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.940
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

77
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

78
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.800
<v Speaker 1>if he goes over and fights,</v>

79
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.240
<v Speaker 1>if Carl and goes over and fights in Japan and he fights fade or as a giant fight</v>

80
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:30.431
<v Speaker 1>last time,</v>

81
00:02:30.431 --> 00:02:31.010
<v Speaker 1>afraid off,</v>

82
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.780
<v Speaker 1>fought,</v>

83
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.320
<v Speaker 1>fought Fabio Maldonado and barely squeaked by a fight,</v>

84
00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:37.600
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people thought that he should have lost you got hurt.</v>

85
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.290
<v Speaker 1>Fabio Maldonado tagged them and there's no shame in that.</v>

86
00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:42.124
<v Speaker 1>Fabio [inaudible],</v>

87
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Fabio Maldonado is a very good boxer.</v>

88
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.140
<v Speaker 1>He rocked Glover to share before glow over,</v>

89
00:02:47.141 --> 00:02:47.974
<v Speaker 1>finished him off.</v>

90
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.120
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

91
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.620
<v Speaker 1>he's just tough as shit and he's a tough,</v>

92
00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:51.220
<v Speaker 1>tough guy.</v>

93
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.710
<v Speaker 1>They always call that poor guy in like,</v>

94
00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:54.430
<v Speaker 1>they always,</v>

95
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Fabio Fabio's like,</v>

96
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>who are we going to get old fighter who will be this fucking wacky fight on</v>

97
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:00.484
<v Speaker 1>short notice?</v>

98
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Fabio Maldonado,</v>

99
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>you remember how he saved that fight in Australia?</v>

100
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>In Brazil?</v>

101
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Some way.</v>

102
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Phots steep bay at heavyweight steep Emile chick when Steve Bay's is just</v>

103
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 1>fucking tearing through the ranks.</v>

104
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:13.451
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

105
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Steve Bay's trying to get a shot at the title and he fights Fabio Maldonado.</v>

106
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.813
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

107
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.241
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

108
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Steve Bay just ran through them.</v>

109
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:21.460
<v Speaker 1>It was horrific.</v>

110
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.031
<v Speaker 1>And Steve,</v>

111
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 1>but he's a scary guy as a heavyweight and Fabio Maldonado just was not the same</v>

112
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:27.200
<v Speaker 1>size,</v>

113
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>just did not belong in there with them.</v>

114
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.793
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

115
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 1>just too big,</v>

116
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:32.681
<v Speaker 1>too strong,</v>

117
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:33.401
<v Speaker 1>too fast.</v>

118
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:34.121
<v Speaker 1>It's too hard.</v>

119
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 1>It was a scary fight.</v>

120
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.693
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

121
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.290
<v Speaker 1>when you think about Fabio Rock and Faye door and hurting him and his last fight</v>

122
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.100
<v Speaker 1>and you think good lord would if he gets hit by Carwyn like car car when takes a</v>

123
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 1>great shot and he hits harder than anybody in the division.</v>

124
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.801
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

125
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:51.634
<v Speaker 1>he's probably,</v>

126
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.760
<v Speaker 1>he's probably one of the scariest heavyweight punchers ever.</v>

127
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Literally ever when he fought mirror,</v>

128
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>I remember he,</v>

129
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.530
<v Speaker 1>he tied near up in a clinch and just ripped up,</v>

130
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.620
<v Speaker 1>cuts to his chin,</v>

131
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.600
<v Speaker 1>his face and put them down and just beat him down when he's on the ground.</v>

132
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:12.601
<v Speaker 1>Like Carwyn could Faulk and paunch scary punch her man.</v>

133
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 1>So if he's healthy like he looks like and that video,</v>

134
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 1>it looks fucking healthy to me and he looks huge.</v>

135
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.100
<v Speaker 1>It looks like he's like well over to 60.</v>

136
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

137
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:23.790
<v Speaker 1>I dunno fader.</v>

138
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno if that's the kind of fight he wants at this stage of his life.</v>

139
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

140
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 1>after he fought Maldonado,</v>

141
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.270
<v Speaker 1>he might be looking to fight smaller heavyweights.</v>

142
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.310
<v Speaker 1>He might be looking to fight bigger names,</v>

143
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.180
<v Speaker 1>will actually comments pretty God damn big name as far as the free market.</v>

144
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.640
<v Speaker 1>But who knows what's going to happen,</v>

145
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:40.240
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

146
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.073
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

147
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.161
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

148
00:04:42.161 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

149
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 1>one of the crazy things with all these new organizations,</v>

150
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 1>whether it's one FC,</v>

151
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.381
<v Speaker 1>whether it's,</v>

152
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

153
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 1>fill in the blank Bella tour,</v>

155
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.120
<v Speaker 1>rise in all these other,</v>

156
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.320
<v Speaker 1>like everyone is scrambling to pick up anybody who leaves the UFC.</v>

157
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.570
<v Speaker 1>So if people's contracts are up,</v>

158
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 1>like they're starting to do and they start bolting over and go into these other</v>

159
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 1>different organizations,</v>

160
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 1>stuff can get crazy.</v>

161
00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 1>Like things can heat up and you might see like another pride UFC type rivalry,</v>

162
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 1>which I think would be great for everybody.</v>

163
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Like if if rise and really does take off,</v>

164
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:18.610
<v Speaker 1>like if rise and puts on fate or versus shame Carwyn and then they come up with</v>

165
00:05:18.611 --> 00:05:20.860
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of other crazy fights for the undercard,</v>

166
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.163
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.070
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

168
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.810
<v Speaker 1>there's just not right now the same level of talent available outside the UFC.</v>

169
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.213
<v Speaker 1>Not right now,</v>

170
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:31.301
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

171
00:05:31.301 --> 00:05:34.330
<v Speaker 1>it's been close a few times and it used to be,</v>

172
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

173
00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:36.520
<v Speaker 1>obviously it used to be with pride.</v>

174
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.870
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to make it something like that happen,</v>

175
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:41.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

176
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.000
<v Speaker 1>I feel with like a Shane car when,</v>

177
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:43.834
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

178
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Shane carn was a great fighter.</v>

179
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.380
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't thrown a punch in how many years?</v>

180
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

181
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.840
<v Speaker 1>he hasn't fought MMA since,</v>

182
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it's two years ago.</v>

183
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.331
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>

184
00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:55.931
<v Speaker 1>three years.</v>

185
00:05:55.931 --> 00:05:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

186
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.313
<v Speaker 1>If the,</v>

187
00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.400
<v Speaker 1>in my world,</v>

188
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.880
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

189
00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.660
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

190
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the professional here,</v>

191
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 1>but I think the UFC marketing would know.</v>

192
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.660
<v Speaker 1>They could do something with a Shane cow and if they,</v>

193
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 1>if they passed on them,</v>

194
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's something they can do.</v>

195
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:10.370
<v Speaker 1>The heavyweight division is packed.</v>

196
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.910
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

197
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:11.430
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

198
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 1>Parameters of this,</v>

199
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

200
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.330
<v Speaker 1>I feel like when a fighter hasn't fought more than a year or two or maybe even</v>

201
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:18.164
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

202
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.360
<v Speaker 1>I think about comedy.</v>

203
00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:21.194
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan,</v>

204
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 1>when I think about it,</v>

205
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.470
<v Speaker 1>probably just didn't do any company for three years.</v>

206
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.860
<v Speaker 1>What would I be ready for?</v>

207
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.731
<v Speaker 1>What would you,</v>

208
00:06:27.731 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 1>you didn't do any comedy for three years.</v>

209
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 1>What would you honestly book yourself for and fucking December.</v>

210
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.940
<v Speaker 1>It's October 31st what would you book yourself on the December the garden,</v>

211
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

212
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 1>you do like the laughing skull and Atlanta.</v>

213
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:43.523
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

214
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.340
<v Speaker 1>A nice cool intimate little room.</v>

215
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:47.174
<v Speaker 1>Very quiet.</v>

216
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 1>99 Cedar.</v>

217
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Shane might not have a lot of money and the rising might have offered them a big</v>

218
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:53.121
<v Speaker 1>chat.</v>

219
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:53.271
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

220
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 1>I understand all these parameters,</v>

221
00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:56.420
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying to you is,</v>

222
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

223
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.630
<v Speaker 1>it's like the GSP thing that was going on and maybe they weren't what they were.</v>

224
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 1>And I think even as a finer two,</v>

225
00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:05.714
<v Speaker 1>three years,</v>

226
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.010
<v Speaker 1>shit is fucking change.</v>

227
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.050
<v Speaker 1>I can change.</v>

228
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.913
<v Speaker 1>Yes and no.</v>

229
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.843
<v Speaker 1>Here's the no,</v>

230
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.320
<v Speaker 1>depends on if you're still training,</v>

231
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 1>see if you decide to take some time off because you have nagging injuries or</v>

232
00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:17.090
<v Speaker 1>some fighters like that.</v>

233
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Joseph volatility and you guy were talking about earlier,</v>

234
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.890
<v Speaker 1>he stepped back because of concussion syndrome cause he's getting,</v>

235
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:22.160
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

236
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

237
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:26.240
<v Speaker 1>he had too many hits to the head and so he recognized it was having some real</v>

238
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:28.040
<v Speaker 1>symptoms and he said no I have to resign.</v>

239
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:28.371
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

240
00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:33.371
<v Speaker 1>he gave up his belt and taking two or three years off if you're having any sort</v>

241
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:35.660
<v Speaker 1>of real problem,</v>

242
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.790
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you've got a reoccurring back injury,</v>

243
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:39.460
<v Speaker 1>which I know Shane had some back issues.</v>

244
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:40.520
<v Speaker 1>He even had surgery.</v>

245
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

246
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.010
<v Speaker 1>So maybe taking that time off.</v>

247
00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:48.011
<v Speaker 1>So it was junior dos Santos was his last loss and that was UFC one 31 and wow.</v>

248
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 1>2011.</v>

249
00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:51.230
<v Speaker 1>So that's five fucking years ago.</v>

250
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.470
<v Speaker 1>Fucking the Fado I love him to death.</v>

251
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:54.771
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

252
00:07:54.771 --> 00:07:56.270
<v Speaker 1>I caught the tail and the Fado,</v>

253
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

254
00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.740
<v Speaker 1>I caught like the two fights before he got on board.</v>

255
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Right by a boy.</v>

256
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Well he got our bart first.</v>

257
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.780
<v Speaker 1>And you saw the fights that he won before that?</v>

258
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:06.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

259
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:06.944
<v Speaker 1>like two fights.</v>

260
00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:08.723
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

261
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.711
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

262
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:10.544
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

263
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.350
<v Speaker 1>he beat Brett Rogers and then,</v>

264
00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:12.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

265
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.930
<v Speaker 1>I think the next fight after Brett Rogers,</v>

266
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.240
<v Speaker 1>pretty sure it was fair to him.</v>

267
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.110
<v Speaker 1>I didn't catch fade or in his hay day is what I'm trying to say.</v>

268
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.990
<v Speaker 1>So the last couple of times I went,</v>

269
00:08:20.991 --> 00:08:22.810
<v Speaker 1>it was like how people said they wanted,</v>

270
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.260
<v Speaker 1>they went to watch x at the end and they got all excited.</v>

271
00:08:25.261 --> 00:08:27.410
<v Speaker 1>It went down so a lot.</v>

272
00:08:27.411 --> 00:08:28.780
<v Speaker 1>And then he got submitted by,</v>

273
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:29.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

274
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.110
<v Speaker 1>for doom,</v>

275
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.621
<v Speaker 1>the doom.</v>

276
00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:34.100
<v Speaker 1>What you and I discussed it this could fucking be doing for him.</v>

277
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:36.320
<v Speaker 1>He's got a nasty guard.</v>

278
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:37.810
<v Speaker 1>There's another guy we were talking about yet.</v>

279
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Nasty guard.</v>

280
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

281
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:44.500
<v Speaker 1>So then I saw a couple pieces of the last fight that was fucking embarrassing.</v>

282
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.073
<v Speaker 1>That was fucked up,</v>

283
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:49.700
<v Speaker 1>both of them.</v>

284
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.080
<v Speaker 1>But at the Fabio I love,</v>

285
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:55.100
<v Speaker 1>I love his fucking jaw that he takes a fight at short notice and then he fought</v>

286
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.790
<v Speaker 1>that Indian gentlemen before that.</v>

287
00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

288
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:57.750
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

289
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 1>but Fado I mean,</v>

290
00:08:58.861 --> 00:08:59.441
<v Speaker 1>now you just,</v>

291
