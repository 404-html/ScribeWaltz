00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.710
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:03.121
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4
00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:03.681
<v Speaker 1>homelands,</v>

5
00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:04.514
<v Speaker 1>a good show.</v>

6
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.763
<v Speaker 1>No habit.</v>

7
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.750
<v Speaker 1>I gave up after loss on tea.</v>

8
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Just don't watch television.</v>

9
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't watch anything they show and real three or a flat screen Elvis.</v>

10
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:15.084
<v Speaker 1>The TV,</v>

11
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:16.663
<v Speaker 1>I only watch.</v>

12
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:17.761
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

13
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:19.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm done throwing and watch.</v>

14
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.431
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good thing.</v>

15
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:21.241
<v Speaker 1>It's not any virtue.</v>

16
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:22.500
<v Speaker 1>Like I watched bigfoot hunter,</v>

17
00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:24.330
<v Speaker 1>I watched fucking two episodes.</v>

18
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:25.164
<v Speaker 1>I had DVR</v>

19
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.420
<v Speaker 1>finding big foot or something and it's like a series where they have like more</v>

20
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:31.400
<v Speaker 1>than one hour.</v>

21
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.420
<v Speaker 1>The first episode they'd be like,</v>

22
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:33.571
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

23
00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:34.440
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to find them.</v>

24
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.071
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

25
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:35.890
<v Speaker 1>it's awesome.</v>

26
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:36.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

27
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.370
<v Speaker 1>the best part about it is the beginning of the guys.</v>

28
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.920
<v Speaker 1>I've been hunting Sasquatches for 25 years.</v>

29
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>I'll quit now.</v>

30
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Quit quitting that.</v>

31
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:46.400
<v Speaker 1>You haven't even got a video of one and crazy as hell.</v>

32
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

33
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:47.731
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

35
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:47.941
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

36
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:50.220
<v Speaker 1>you know how those go shows are really not realistic.</v>

37
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Like they never really find a ghost.</v>

38
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.810
<v Speaker 1>This what if we did it with Sas,</v>

39
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.840
<v Speaker 1>but what's next?</v>

40
00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Like Tuba cobre sure.</v>

41
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>If they can sell it,</v>

42
00:00:57.781 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>they would.</v>

43
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.830
<v Speaker 1>They would have it.</v>

44
00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.161
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

45
00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:00.360
<v Speaker 1>it's a fun show to watch though,</v>

46
00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:01.380
<v Speaker 1>because it's so stupid.</v>

47
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

48
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.821
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

49
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 1>everyone has a video that they want you to analyze.</v>

50
00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:05.940
<v Speaker 1>It may have been a Sasquatch,</v>

51
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:07.950
<v Speaker 1>so they have to recreate the scene in the video.</v>

52
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:08.803
<v Speaker 1>It looks sweet.</v>

53
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>It looks so silly because the people knew exactly where the car was and this is</v>

54
00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:13.531
<v Speaker 1>the tree.</v>

55
00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>And so they line it up on the camera and then they have this big guy named Bobo</v>

56
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 1>who kind of looks like a big foot.</v>

57
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.930
<v Speaker 1>And he goes out there and he does exactly what,</v>

58
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.340
<v Speaker 1>and he's always way bigger than the big foot in the video.</v>

59
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.310
<v Speaker 1>So it always proves that it wasn't really that day.</v>

60
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.511
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

61
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:28.071
<v Speaker 1>I see here.</v>

62
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Or You were big foot.</v>

63
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.311
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

64
00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Out of pig foot a season one.</v>

65
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:31.351
<v Speaker 1>Season two.</v>

66
00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:32.041
<v Speaker 1>They replaced me.</v>

67
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 1>There was like a contract.</v>

68
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when I wanted to make us more empathetic and uh,</v>

69
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.650
<v Speaker 1>Harry and the Hendersons like a whole family lived with big foot.</v>

70
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.191
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

71
00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:43.024
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

72
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.650
<v Speaker 1>She badgered her selfie to my kids.</v>

73
00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure.</v>

74
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't even trust dogs than,</v>

75
00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:52.111
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

76
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:54.900
<v Speaker 1>This guy's got a fucking big foot hanging out with his kids.</v>

77
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.880
<v Speaker 1>He probably told these stupid humans a thing or two about love.</v>

78
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.380
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

79
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.940
<v Speaker 1>hurry in the Henderson,</v>

80
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.590
<v Speaker 1>there's never been a real good bigfoot movie.</v>

81
00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:08.424
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

82
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Nobody has ever stepped up and it's not like,</v>

83
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.813
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

84
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.830
<v Speaker 1>the bar's been set that high.</v>

85
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.820
<v Speaker 1>The bar is incredibly low.</v>

86
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>The bar is all fraudulent videos.</v>

87
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

88
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>That's the closest thing to a big foot move and I would think after like season</v>

89
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:24.360
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

90
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.400
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that watch the show and they're like,</v>

91
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:27.140
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

92
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Like I think you should</v>

93
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.643
<v Speaker 1>never been up.</v>

94
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

95
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was like this is a really bad ones.</v>

96
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:36.810
<v Speaker 1>The seventies or some swamp thing,</v>

97
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 1>monster guy.</v>

98
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.620
<v Speaker 1>But there's never been a movie,</v>

99
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:43.170
<v Speaker 1>a good movie about a bunch of people that encounter big foot.</v>

100
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

101
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.380
<v Speaker 1>How is that possible that you have such a,</v>

102
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.660
<v Speaker 1>a folklore that is completely permeated society.</v>

103
00:02:48.661 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>He's not there.</v>

104
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.000
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever made,</v>

105
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.881
<v Speaker 1>not sexy,</v>

106
00:02:50.881 --> 00:02:54.020
<v Speaker 1>but I made a movie about finding bigfoot.</v>

107
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.840
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

108
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.673
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

109
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

110
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.701
<v Speaker 1>We're really,</v>

111
00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:58.550
<v Speaker 1>when you think about how popular it is,</v>

112
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>you would movie would be human.</v>

113
00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>The movie ideas they're doing,</v>

114
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:02.340
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>

115
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

116
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like based on a matchbook.</v>

117
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

118
00:03:04.831 --> 00:03:05.220
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

119
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.220
<v Speaker 1>so you'd think they'd have big fun romantic comedies when you hear some romantic</v>

120
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 1>comedy premise and you like what?</v>

121
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.971
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>

122
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Finally meet again at 60.</v>

123
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

124
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 1>I sometimes feel like I just established a consciousness when I was like 30</v>

125
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 1>because like romantic comedies,</v>

126
00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:23.620
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

127
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:23.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>I was so dumb I think in my twenties that like when,</v>

129
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:03:27.321 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>it would be like,</v>

131
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:28.743
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

132
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

133
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal,</v>

135
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:32.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 1>like Harry met Sally.</v>

137
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Like to me that was just a movie.</v>

138
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>I didn't consider that a romantic comedy,</v>

139
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:37.991
<v Speaker 1>which it was,</v>

140
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 1>but now it's like this genre that is always existed,</v>

141
00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:43.480
<v Speaker 1>but they just kind of like,</v>

142
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:44.800
<v Speaker 1>just churn out these,</v>

143
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>just like those romantic code existed.</v>

144
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Movies were when a woman got mouthy,</v>

145
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.160
<v Speaker 1>the made gave her the back of her hand.</v>

146
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.233
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

147
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.313
<v Speaker 1>Back of his hand.</v>

148
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.453
