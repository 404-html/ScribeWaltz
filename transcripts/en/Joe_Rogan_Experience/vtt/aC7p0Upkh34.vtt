<v Speaker 1>but fuck.</v>

14
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:46.090
<v Speaker 1>He goes to the hill and not in a judgy </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of like,</v>

15
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.580

<v Speaker 1>I live a boy's life as a 47 year old </v>

18
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.450
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy that writes about people </v>

22
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.400
<v Speaker 1>that shoot bow and arrows to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>crimes.</v>

23
00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:05.950
<v Speaker 1>They usually have boxing gloves at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of them and shit like that.</v>

24
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.620
<v Speaker 1>That's good to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

25
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.630
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

26
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.230
<v Speaker 1>I guess the point is I know you're busy </v>
<v Speaker 1>as fuck and I know sometimes I get very </v>

27
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.891
<v Speaker 1>busy as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we only don't do this </v>

28
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:20.200
<v Speaker 1>because of how busy we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

29
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.720
<v Speaker 1>that's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My very convoluted.</v>

30
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.010
<v Speaker 1>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

31
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll buy that for me is for me,</v>

32
00:01:26.171 --> 00:01:26.980
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

33
00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:27.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

34
00:01:27.611 --> 00:01:30.010
<v Speaker 1>I could do that once a week because I'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk away.</v>

35
00:01:30.011 --> 00:01:33.670
<v Speaker 1>I always walk away with a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've never done cocaine,</v>

36
00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:36.790
<v Speaker 1>but I imagine that's what it's like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do a line of cocaine off.</v>

37
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if somebody beautiful or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

38
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.290
<v Speaker 1>I always walk away with wisdom and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wisdom that even though it's on a </v>

39
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.070
<v Speaker 1>podcast and recorded and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>record of like,</v>

40
00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:46.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where you learned those things.</v>

41
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.330
<v Speaker 1>I still go out into the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>present them as my own,</v>

42
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.090
<v Speaker 1>like I'm a smart well read person out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

43
00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:54.910
<v Speaker 1>There's dudes that have done a line of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine off someone and they're like,</v>

44
00:01:54.911 --> 00:01:59.911
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is he telling you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never learned anything from that </v>

45
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:01.780
<v Speaker 1>except to do it better where the cocaine</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't quite fall into the ass crack or</v>

46
00:02:01.781 --> 00:02:03.040
<v Speaker 1>where.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where'd all my money go?</v>

47
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Speaker 1>To think that that was never my poison </v>
<v Speaker 1>man and never.</v>

48
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.220
<v Speaker 1>I still have never in this lifetime done</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowingly done cocaine.</v>

49
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Somebody might've slipped it to me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I both really?</v>

50
00:02:12.881 --> 00:02:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never touched it,</v>

51
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.610
<v Speaker 1>but one time in man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking,</v>

52
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.390
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

53
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

54
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.760
<v Speaker 1>were rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:18.761 --> 00:02:21.520
<v Speaker 1>And also just like as entertainers were </v>
<v Speaker 1>rare as well,</v>

56
00:02:21.521 --> 00:02:26.521
<v Speaker 1>does it ever make you feel less than </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you read about those of us who try </v>

57
00:02:26.711 --> 00:02:31.711
<v Speaker 1>to be funny in this business and those </v>
<v Speaker 1>who have been insanely successful and </v>

58
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:32.650
<v Speaker 1>become icons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always have,</v>

59
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they did blow for hours and </v>

60
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

61
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

62
00:02:38.321 --> 00:02:42.330
<v Speaker 1>that's not part of my matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hence I must not be one of the greats.</v>

63
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very lucky that I know that.</v>

64
00:02:44.381 --> 00:02:49.381
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel that right because I think </v>

65
00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:49.420
<v Speaker 1>I'd have a real problem with speed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>amphetamines and coke.</v>

66
00:02:49.421 --> 00:02:54.421
<v Speaker 1>I think I'd have a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what draws your eye like from a </v>

67
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:54.421
<v Speaker 1>distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't enjoy it.</v>

68
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:58.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's the worst thing for </v>

69
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>someone like me who's up probably person</v>
<v Speaker 1>to begin with,</v>

70
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has served me well.</v>

71
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.130
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

72
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>that stuff makes you giggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giggle.</v>

73
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:11.941
<v Speaker 1>Not because it's not facetious is if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>walked into the facility that I just </v>

74
00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:16.591
<v Speaker 1>walked into and had the grand tour that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were given a gentle listener and </v>

75
00:03:16.591 --> 00:03:17.060
<v Speaker 1>watcher at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

80
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.390
<v Speaker 1>it's a paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

81
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck the term man cave.</v>

82
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.480

<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

83
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.810

<v Speaker 1>It's everything he loves under one </v>

84
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 1>fucking roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said it to him before,</v>

85
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.140
<v Speaker 1>like you did this with your mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you talked yourself into this.</v>

86
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that awesome?</v>

87
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you've gotten,</v>

88
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.500
<v Speaker 1>you've got a zillion things that you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like even in a world of the MMA </v>

89
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's still your mouth.</v>

90
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.420
<v Speaker 1>It's always your fucking mouth that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking you from where you started til </v>

91
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:02.461
<v Speaker 1>now you walk into this building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like he had a family fortune </v>

92
00:04:02.461 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 1>and it was willed to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your mouth put you in a building.</v>

93
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 1>This nice painted the walls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the color it is.</v>

94
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:09.130
<v Speaker 1>You walk in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a museum.</v>

95
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:13.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like you see pieces of of him hence</v>
<v Speaker 1>me all over the fucking place.</v>

96
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.900
<v Speaker 1>That's all out of your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If anybody's watching or listening at </v>

97
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.960
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teetering on the verge of like,</v>

98
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:24.961
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if I should do a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Send them a snapshot of that fucking </v>

99
00:04:24.961 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 1>room where you can launch bow and arrows</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 45 yards.</v>

100
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.350
<v Speaker 1>They'll start talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think if you're interested in at </v>

101
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.440
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should do a podcast talk to you.</v>

102
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>It can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be a way to make a living.</v>

103
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 1>There's enough people like this.</v>

104
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

105
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.270
<v Speaker 1>famine thinkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the opposite.</v>

106
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Like you could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody can do it.</v>

107
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:43.030
<v Speaker 1>I've never like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

108
00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:44.810
<v Speaker 1>it might not be enough for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

109
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm always the guy who encourages you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

110
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.190

<v Speaker 1>we've been,</v>

113
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.400
<v Speaker 1>we're rare birds and as much as we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been around since the fucking art forum </v>

114
00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.641
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you've been doing podcasts since a </v>

115
00:05:00.641 --> 00:05:03.710
<v Speaker 1>minute after podcasts start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At first he was the Guy Predate Corolla.</v>

116
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

117
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:05.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

118
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.800
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're in the first five years you </v>

119
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.800
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

120
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.640
<v Speaker 1>what year did you start?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started,</v>

121
00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:15.400
<v Speaker 1>we just celebrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last year was our 10th anniversary,</v>

122
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.440
<v Speaker 1>so we're now a year 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So count back from now is two one.</v>

123
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven years.</v>

124
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did you begin?</v>

125
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand nine.</v>

126
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.990
<v Speaker 1>It was in two years of the Big Bang when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

127
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.020
<v Speaker 1>when I jumped in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was Leo Laporte doing this week in </v>

128
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.761
<v Speaker 1>tech and I think he still does that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the happy tree friends and that was like</v>

129
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:43.981
<v Speaker 1>the apple podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>top five and then me and Scott started </v>

130
00:05:43.981 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 1>with smog cast and then later on we </v>
<v Speaker 1>added a bunch of stuff,</v>

131
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.750
<v Speaker 1>but getting in within the first two </v>
<v Speaker 1>years like we happened and then right on</v>

132
00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:56.350
<v Speaker 1>the heels of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam was on the radio and that radio job</v>

133
00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>went away and where</v>

134
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Adam went to podcasting gotta be 2000 if</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started smart guests,</v>

135
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 1>2007.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's either in.</v>

136
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.310
<v Speaker 1>We start February 2007.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either he loses the Radio Gig in 2007 </v>

137
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.180
<v Speaker 1>and moves the pockets or it happens in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2008,</v>

138
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that neighborhood?</v>

139
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.030
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's.</v>

140
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:18.470
<v Speaker 1>He was the model for a lot of folks now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Ralph Garman,</v>

141
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:20.810
<v Speaker 1>the guy that I do Hollywood babble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Ralph.</v>

142
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.520
<v Speaker 1>Ralph's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was let go byK rock earlier this year</v>

143
00:06:24.521 --> 00:06:25.060
<v Speaker 1>or later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

144
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 1>at the end of last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right before Christmas.</v>

145
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.220
<v Speaker 1>And so he to moved into a kind of online</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

146
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.830
<v Speaker 1>It can sustain a motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ralph's report is his show.</v>

147
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.370
<v Speaker 1>I liked him a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a good dude.</v>

148
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.580
<v Speaker 1>Good Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm talking to him when you,</v>

149
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.910
<v Speaker 1>when you go to k rock and that's how our</v>
<v Speaker 1>friendship began.</v>

150
00:06:44.911 --> 00:06:48.620
<v Speaker 1>And you sit there doing the show and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then afterwards I was a cigarette smoker</v>

151
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:53.621
<v Speaker 1>in those days and we'd sit there out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the parking lot and smoke and slowly </v>

152
00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:57.100
<v Speaker 1>like I remember I came in once k rock </v>
<v Speaker 1>just announced like,</v>

153
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've rented a theater on Santa Monica </v>

154
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Boulevard and we're calling it smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>cast when going,</v>

155
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.470
<v Speaker 1>we're the world's first live podcasting </v>
<v Speaker 1>theater,</v>

156
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.630
<v Speaker 1>then we're going to do podcasts there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>

157
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.650
<v Speaker 1>And so Ralph was listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's right there.</v>

158
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:18.130
<v Speaker 1>And then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like months prior he had approached me </v>

159
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:18.130
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

160
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 1>would you ever want to do like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Showbiz beat?</v>

161
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>That's what he used to do on k rock on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin and been like as a Saturday show.</v>

162
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:25.040
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Ya,</v>

163
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.350
<v Speaker 1>hear myself on the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be fantastic.</v>

164
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.800
<v Speaker 1>So we recorded a demo for the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave it to his bosses and his bosses </v>

165
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.680
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to listen to people talk on</v>

166
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:36.920
<v Speaker 1>the radio anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it died there.</v>

167
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:41.921
<v Speaker 1>Just like how years ago things died when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't get past a gatekeeper who </v>

168
00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:43.280
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want your shit.</v>

169
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Was this after the talk radio station in</v>
<v Speaker 1>La went under this.</v>

170
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they probably were like current on </v>

171
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:52.720
<v Speaker 1>that and they were just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.460
<v Speaker 1>k rock was reading the tea leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was like,</v>

173
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.400
<v Speaker 1>people don't want to hear people cheer.</v>

174
00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.930
<v Speaker 1>This won't play music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're competing with satellite radio now</v>

175
00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:04.931
<v Speaker 1>we're competing with streaming music </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's like they don't have to wait </v>

176
00:08:04.931 --> 00:08:07.340
<v Speaker 1>15 minutes to hear a song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan could shows though runway steckler.</v>

177
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.000
<v Speaker 1>That was a really good show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

178
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.540
<v Speaker 1>they were great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a bunch of really good shows.</v>

179
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.030
<v Speaker 1>But the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he,</v>

180
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.410
<v Speaker 1>we had tried that and it was called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Showbiz beat.</v>

181
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.720
<v Speaker 1>And then months later when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there going like,</v>

182
00:08:20.721 --> 00:08:25.721
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm opening this podcast theater </v>

183
00:08:25.721 --> 00:08:26.030
<v Speaker 1>afterwards in the parking lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grabbing the post show smoke.</v>

184
00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Ralph is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

185
00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:31.010
<v Speaker 1>would you ever want to try that radio </v>
<v Speaker 1>show at that theater?</v>

186
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.390
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah,</v>

187
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:34.310
<v Speaker 1>you want to do it as a podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

188
00:08:34.311 --> 00:08:34.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like yeah,</v>

189
00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:39.971
<v Speaker 1>let's try it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was driving home and I texted </v>

190
00:08:39.971 --> 00:08:44.231
<v Speaker 1>him at a light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said we could call it Hollywood </v>

191
00:08:44.231 --> 00:08:44.231
<v Speaker 1>Babylon.</v>

192
00:08:44.231 --> 00:08:49.040
<v Speaker 1>It was an old book called Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 1>Babylon that was about like gossipy </v>

193
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.520
<v Speaker 1>stories about Hollywood people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

194
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.790
<v Speaker 1>but we spell that of course differently </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff and that was my.</v>

195
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.650
<v Speaker 1>That's what I brought to Babylon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>

196
00:08:55.651 --> 00:09:00.651
<v Speaker 1>Ralph built that entire thing and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>my job became to sit next to them and </v>

197
00:09:00.651 --> 00:09:05.331
<v Speaker 1>react to the news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why I love that part so much </v>

198
00:09:05.331 --> 00:09:06.540
<v Speaker 1>because as you can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking love the sound of my voice and</v>

199
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:07.620
<v Speaker 1>I wind up talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>

200
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:12.650
<v Speaker 1>talking on smog casts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would lead on Jay and silent Bob get </v>

201
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really about Jason Muse.</v>

202
00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:17.871
<v Speaker 1>I wound up wind up talking a bunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with Babylon I get to sit there </v>

203
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:21.300
<v Speaker 1>while he's the main act and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.930
<v Speaker 1>the second banana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

205
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.950
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nice to be able to top and bottom </v>

206
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.200
<v Speaker 1>in the world of podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

207
00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:30.900
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

208
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.590
<v Speaker 1>it gives you a place to go if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>tapping all the time,</v>

209
00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:34.860
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

210
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:39.860
<v Speaker 1>That I'm talking about my thoughts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I believe in and these are the </v>

211
00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:39.860
<v Speaker 1>experiences I've had and people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in that.</v>

212
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.530
<v Speaker 1>But then sometimes you just want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>check out and talk about somebody else's</v>

213
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:45.750
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None a podcast we do call fat man.</v>

214
00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:46.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm battling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we do.</v>

215
00:09:46.801 --> 00:09:48.690
<v Speaker 1>I just sit around and go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

216
00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:50.220
<v Speaker 1>you watched the avengers and shit like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

217
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.410
<v Speaker 1>So you get to concentrate on that kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of stuff.</v>

218
00:09:52.411 --> 00:09:57.411
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Babylon thing grew insanely </v>

219
00:09:57.411 --> 00:09:57.411
<v Speaker 1>organically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We started that little theater,</v>

220
00:09:57.411 --> 00:10:01.880
<v Speaker 1>sat 48 people and since he was on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio every morning he can just fucking </v>

221
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.160
<v Speaker 1>sell it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>

222
00:10:02.161 --> 00:10:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to Kevin's website.</v>

223
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:06.900

<v Speaker 1>This is that you placed on.</v>

224
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.140
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was somewhere in West Hollywood,</v>

225
00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:11.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That little theater.</v>

226
00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:12.040
<v Speaker 1>It was on.</v>

227
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was on Santa Monica Boulevard in an </v>

228
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.440
<v Speaker 1>area of where they put up a few black </v>
<v Speaker 1>box theaters.</v>

229
00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:24.441
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this section is called the complex and </v>

230
00:10:24.441 --> 00:10:27.561
<v Speaker 1>we had one theater in the complex and </v>
<v Speaker 1>repainted it and hung up like all the </v>

231
00:10:27.561 --> 00:10:32.391
<v Speaker 1>artwork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you got our work based on the </v>

232
00:10:32.391 --> 00:10:32.391
<v Speaker 1>podcast out in the hallway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

233
00:10:32.391 --> 00:10:34.530
<v Speaker 1>We were essentially built a shrine to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott Mosier,</v>

234
00:10:34.531 --> 00:10:36.190
<v Speaker 1>my cohost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart kids,</v>

235
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.580
<v Speaker 1>which I'm sure on some level creeped him</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck out.</v>

236
00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:41.760
<v Speaker 1>First time he walked in was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants to wear my skin,</v>

237
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:47.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the idea was we're going to do </v>

238
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.461
<v Speaker 1>nothing but smart cast here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But since Scott didn't suddenly go into </v>

239
00:10:49.461 --> 00:10:49.680
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

240
00:10:49.681 --> 00:10:51.120
<v Speaker 1>let's do five podcasts a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

241
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:56.140
<v Speaker 1>it stayed pretty much the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a theater with nothing going on </v>

242
00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.420
<v Speaker 1>and it and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started trying other things.</v>

243
00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Babylon became one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay and silent Bob get old also came out</v>

244
00:11:01.651 --> 00:11:03.550
<v Speaker 1>of that experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still have that theater.</v>

245
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.120
<v Speaker 1>We let go of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me and Maddie Cohen,</v>

246
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:10.110
<v Speaker 1>who's a cohost on this very fun podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>he does with Macaulay Culkin.</v>

247
00:11:10.111 --> 00:11:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Have you spoken to fucking Macaulay </v>
<v Speaker 1>Culkin?</v>

248
00:11:11.641 --> 00:11:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Ya know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just putting a bug in your ear.</v>

249
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

250
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.040
<v Speaker 1>He gives good talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good oral.</v>

251
00:11:20.041 --> 00:11:21.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean that sounds filthier than I meant</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

252
00:11:21.451 --> 00:11:23.100
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like as a guest.</v>

253
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Fucking fascinating and funny and it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

254
00:11:27.481 --> 00:11:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Matt and Macaulay do a podcast called </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunny ears,</v>

255
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:35.930
<v Speaker 1>and so Matt Cohen was the guy that I'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>opened smog castle with like guy going,</v>

256
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.330
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had a black box theater and </v>
<v Speaker 1>went out and found it and stuff.</v>

257
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.970
<v Speaker 1>So we kept it open for like one year and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then let it go.</v>

258
00:11:41.971 --> 00:11:46.971
<v Speaker 1>Because what had happened was the Babel </v>
<v Speaker 1>show sold so well so quickly all the </v>

259
00:11:46.971 --> 00:11:50.460
<v Speaker 1>time that it became clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we move this to a bigger theater.</v>

260
00:11:50.461 --> 00:11:52.590
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was on the radio all the time,</v>

261
00:11:52.591 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 1>so it was easy to move seats.</v>

262
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:58.610
<v Speaker 2>So we went up to the lovetts member,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jon Lovitz Comedy Club.</v>

263
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.210
<v Speaker 2>Ralph had went to the Improv and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>love.</v>

264
00:12:01.211 --> 00:12:06.211
<v Speaker 2>It's the love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's with like you could have 95 or 100 </v>

265
00:12:06.211 --> 00:12:09.151
<v Speaker 2>percent of the doors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something ridiculous and that was the </v>

266
00:12:09.151 --> 00:12:09.390
<v Speaker 2>only reason we went up there with air </v>
<v Speaker 2>for awhile.</v>

267
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.610
<v Speaker 2>Things fell out with Lovitz and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we moved to the Improv instead.</v>

268
00:12:12.611 --> 00:12:17.611
<v Speaker 2>So we've been there ever since and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>we do it on the road quite a bit and </v>

269
00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.330
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always weird,</v>

270
00:12:19.331 --> 00:12:24.331
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the people were way above your </v>

271
00:12:24.331 --> 00:12:25.681
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one level here and one level way </v>

272
00:12:25.681 --> 00:12:28.470
<v Speaker 2>was meant to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was bb king's originally back in the </v>

273
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.520
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like a jazz club where you </v>

274
00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.901
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't mind looking down at the act </v>
<v Speaker 2>but for a podcast and with a guy with a </v>

275
00:12:34.361 --> 00:12:36.910
<v Speaker 2>fucking bald spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was nerve wracking because like,</v>

276
00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:41.911
<v Speaker 2>how am I supposed to be funny knowing </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're staring down at me judging my </v>

277
00:12:41.911 --> 00:12:41.911
<v Speaker 2>bald spot.</v>

278
00:12:41.911 --> 00:12:43.480
<v Speaker 2>Some comedy shows there and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

279
00:12:43.481 --> 00:12:48.481
<v Speaker 2>but it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was odd because it was a weird shape </v>

280
00:12:48.481 --> 00:12:48.481
<v Speaker 2>tray flap and straighten up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me.</v>

281
00:12:48.481 --> 00:12:51.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm just jump off topic real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What were you.</v>

282
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:56.340
<v Speaker 2>Was it the times you were featured in </v>
<v Speaker 2>for being like the source for news?</v>

283
00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:00.280
<v Speaker 2>It's this thing that these guys are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're they're,</v>

284
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:06.090
<v Speaker 2>they're calling something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual dark web and they've </v>

285
00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:07.660
<v Speaker 2>connected a bunch of people together </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are interesting.</v>

286
00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:12.661
<v Speaker 2>People that don't follow poor standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>for name bad marketing because when I </v>

287
00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:16.540
<v Speaker 2>read it I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think of him as dark web.</v>

288
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.850
<v Speaker 2>The dark web.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend,</v>

289
00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:21.780
<v Speaker 2>I think of Weinstein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She loves that sneaky.</v>

290
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.610
<v Speaker 2>You can dagger type stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He came up with the name of it.</v>

291
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:29.790
<v Speaker 2>He just gets a kick out of it I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but essentially the piece was about how </v>

292
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:33.481
<v Speaker 2>you are doing media that the quote </v>
<v Speaker 2>unquote real media is not doing like you</v>

293
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:39.390
<v Speaker 2>know more about the rise of certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectuals that are very </v>

294
00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.931
<v Speaker 2>controversial like Jordan Peterson and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris and all the debate about </v>

295
00:13:42.931 --> 00:13:42.931
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

296
00:13:42.931 --> 00:13:46.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm just someone who they get a chance </v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk to for three hours,</v>

297
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a pretty well.</v>

298
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:54.220
<v Speaker 2>Well we'll subscribe to base is a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are going to listen to these</v>

299
00:13:54.221 --> 00:13:55.660
<v Speaker 2>conversations and they get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

300
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.980
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

301
00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.060
<v Speaker 2>Why haven't I heard people talk like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this before?</v>

302
00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:02.240
<v Speaker 2>Why haven't I heard about the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>determinism versus freewill?</v>

303
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:07.290
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why haven't I heard like last time we </v>

304
00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:08.650
<v Speaker 2>were here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about the universal monetary.</v>

305
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Everybody starts with a salary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

306
00:14:11.591 --> 00:14:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Universal basic income.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was super hesitant about that.</v>

307
00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:16.210
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's nonsense.</v>

308
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:17.770
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

309
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.000
<v Speaker 2>the more I thought about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

310
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.880
<v Speaker 2>whenever I just immediately dismiss </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

311
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.990
<v Speaker 2>I always have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

312
00:14:22.991 --> 00:14:25.720
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why am I immediately dismissing it?</v>

313
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

314
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.000
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

315
00:14:27.001 --> 00:14:28.290
<v Speaker 2>why did I go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I thought,</v>

316
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.440
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking people.</v>

317
00:14:29.441 --> 00:14:30.750
<v Speaker 2>They're just lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just want money.</v>

318
00:14:30.751 --> 00:14:31.430
<v Speaker 2>And then I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

319
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.430
<v Speaker 2>is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me see what the fuck's going on.</v>

320
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.190
<v Speaker 2>Because there's a weird reaction that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had.</v>

321
00:14:38.191 --> 00:14:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Like I had a reaction against lazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

322
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:44.340
<v Speaker 2>The unexamined life is not worth living,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's easy enough for you to be like,</v>

323
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:49.350
<v Speaker 2>now I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But most people end their and their </v>

324
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.350
<v Speaker 2>story goes in a different direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

325
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.160
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't I didn't have a clear defense?</v>

326
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 2>My actions,</v>

327
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.780
<v Speaker 3>the way I thought not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

328
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.770
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do anything but the way I </v>
<v Speaker 3>considered this subject,</v>

329
00:14:57.771 --> 00:15:00.260
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have a real bay.</v>

330
00:15:00.261 --> 00:15:02.570
<v Speaker 3>I was very knee jerk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I said,</v>

331
00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:07.571
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me really examine this and what the </v>

332
00:15:08.121 --> 00:15:12.740
<v Speaker 3>real issue I think is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>automation and artificial intelligence.</v>

333
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.210
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to remove a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous amount of jobs.</v>

334
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:22.510
<v Speaker 3>I think automation in terms of a car </v>
<v Speaker 3>driving and a different use,</v>

335
00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:28.340
<v Speaker 3>different functions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once they get better at robotics and </v>

336
00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.040
<v Speaker 3>being able to do things and then people </v>
<v Speaker 3>will be less and less necessary and they</v>

337
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.540
<v Speaker 3>have a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think with cars,</v>

338
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:37.870
<v Speaker 3>with a number of males that drive cars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in the millions for a job and that </v>

339
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:44.560
<v Speaker 3>they would all like almost instantly be </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of work if they ever get these </v>

340
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.890
<v Speaker 3>automated cars down and where everybody.</v>

341
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:50.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since we're a culture that believes in </v>

342
00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:51.920
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one's inclined to believe,</v>

343
00:15:51.921 --> 00:15:56.921
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will get these self driving </v>

344
00:15:56.921 --> 00:15:57.070
<v Speaker 3>vehicles down to a science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they'll get it down there.</v>

345
00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:02.280
<v Speaker 3>They're pretty damn close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Close by fact that as soon as somebody </v>

346
00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:06.491
<v Speaker 3>gets it right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get set back a couple of hundred </v>

347
00:16:06.491 --> 00:16:07.670
<v Speaker 3>miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's been a few fatalities,</v>

348
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Several.</v>

349
00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.040
<v Speaker 3>But how many have been fatalities </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of humans,</v>

350
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:18.220
<v Speaker 3>and I always say that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how many more humans are driving </v>

351
00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:22.240
<v Speaker 3>that fucking robots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that shit is off the charts and </v>

352
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.540
<v Speaker 3>that number's got to be banana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like how many actual robots are out</v>

353
00:16:23.541 --> 00:16:25.550
<v Speaker 3>there driving?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he got 10 and two of them killed,</v>

354
00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:27.990
<v Speaker 3>people settled down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still.</v>

355
00:16:27.991 --> 00:16:29.750
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the numbers though,</v>

356
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.690
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>billions of people driving cars.</v>

357
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.350
<v Speaker 3>Only 10 robots and they've already taken</v>
<v Speaker 3>two lives,</v>

358
00:16:35.351 --> 00:16:36.440
<v Speaker 3>so that's pretty.</v>

359
00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:38.850
<v Speaker 3>It was a pretty bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

360
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:41.090
<v Speaker 3>That's what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that.</v>

361
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:46.150
<v Speaker 3>I've been talking about this a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a fucking robot that I'm a Darpa</v>

362
00:16:47.001 --> 00:16:50.870
<v Speaker 3>created and it's called the eater robot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>EA T R,</v>

363
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:56.260
<v Speaker 3>and it can fucking fuel itself with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>biological material.</v>

364
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.190
<v Speaker 3>Any or is it programmed for certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>biological material?</v>

365
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.170
<v Speaker 3>No Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but biological computer.</v>

366
00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:06.440
<v Speaker 3>Dead bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no doubt.</v>

367
00:17:06.441 --> 00:17:09.920
<v Speaker 3>But does that mean that a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's aware of when it's powering down?</v>

368
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's remember either the military role</v>

369
00:17:12.681 --> 00:17:14.720
<v Speaker 3>at this supposed to eat humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His is the thing.</v>

370
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:20.230
<v Speaker 3>I think the idea of biological material </v>
<v Speaker 3>is maybe it could sustain itself on </v>

371
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:21.860
<v Speaker 3>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you could sustain.</v>

372
00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.420
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's possible.</v>

373
00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:26.030
<v Speaker 3>It's possible you went right to human </v>
<v Speaker 3>remains possible.</v>

374
00:17:26.031 --> 00:17:31.031
<v Speaker 3>If you can use this thing in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>battlefield that you would want to have </v>

375
00:17:31.031 --> 00:17:31.700
<v Speaker 3>it eat people because you can have dead </v>
<v Speaker 3>people everywhere.</v>

376
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.030
<v Speaker 3>Have this fucking robot monster that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're sending to kill people.</v>

377
00:17:35.031 --> 00:17:37.670
<v Speaker 3>Also eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So not only is it killing people,</v>

378
00:17:37.671 --> 00:17:40.370
<v Speaker 3>but it's also cleaning up in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>background as well.</v>

379
00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:45.550
<v Speaker 3>Taking dead bodies away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was a diabolical scientists and I was </v>

380
00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:49.001
<v Speaker 3>going to come up with the evilest mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>his shit to to send to the enemy to go </v>

381
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will be a</v>

382
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.100
<v Speaker 2>robot that eats people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

383
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.230
<v Speaker 2>Because it's going to kill people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

384
00:17:55.231 --> 00:18:00.231
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be sent there that killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>your loved one watch in horror as a </v>

385
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:07.040
<v Speaker 2>consumer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's flush and power me further fuel to </v>

386
00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:07.530
<v Speaker 2>kill you next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And wouldn't we?</v>

387
00:18:07.531 --> 00:18:12.531
<v Speaker 2>I mean pretty bad and and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stereotypical and one might even say </v>

388
00:18:12.531 --> 00:18:14.160
<v Speaker 2>racist robot voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I apologize for the race.</v>

389
00:18:14.161 --> 00:18:16.740
<v Speaker 2>What race would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monotone.</v>

390
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.740
<v Speaker 2>I feel no love nor are paid and they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it look scary to man.</v>

391
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:27.560
<v Speaker 2>They can make it look like venom like </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a star wars books or spiderman,</v>

392
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.430
<v Speaker 2>Spiderman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>books that would be scary to people.</v>

393
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:30.780
<v Speaker 2>Be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Fuck venoms here.</v>

394
00:18:30.781 --> 00:18:32.170
<v Speaker 2>This rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be pretty close.</v>

395
00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:37.210
<v Speaker 2>Our Denim Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It needs to look like that face the </v>

396
00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:39.030
<v Speaker 2>giant face with the wind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that.</v>

397
00:18:39.031 --> 00:18:43.410
<v Speaker 2>If that was in the eater robot and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside all that scare you,</v>

398
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:47.670
<v Speaker 2>would that scare you more or would it </v>
<v Speaker 2>scare you more if there were like,</v>

399
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the eater robot,</v>

400
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:54.260
<v Speaker 2>its head is full of hypodermic needles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each one more toxic than the last and </v>

401
00:18:55.231 --> 00:18:57.240
<v Speaker 2>infected at a moment's touch.</v>

402
00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.870
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are terrible too.</v>

403
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

404
00:19:02.291 --> 00:19:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to try option or do you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to greet by the sharks?</v>

405
00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:05.540
<v Speaker 2>Which question</v>

406
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:11.100
<v Speaker 3>have you spoken about Roseanne yet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not publicly.</v>

407
00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:16.410
<v Speaker 2>Have you had private conversations?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is enough to form some sort of thought </v>

408
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.130
<v Speaker 2>process on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to Ben Shapiro about it today </v>

409
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:19.170
<v Speaker 2>on his show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it won't be out until Sunday.</v>

410
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.400
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

411
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:25.510
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever encountered her in the </v>

412
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.510
<v Speaker 2>world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know Roseanne,</v>

413
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:29.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to her on the phone and I </v>

414
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:32.431
<v Speaker 3>believe every word she said she told me </v>
<v Speaker 3>that she was taking the Ambien and that </v>

415
00:19:32.431 --> 00:19:37.021
<v Speaker 3>she was drunk and Memorial Day weekend </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she tweeted a bunch of stupid shit </v>

416
00:19:37.021 --> 00:19:38.470
<v Speaker 3>and she's out of her fucking mind and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she said,</v>

417
00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in her words,</v>

418
00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.210
<v Speaker 3>I need to adjust my meds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

419
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:48.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm not thinking straight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she was talking about how exhausted </v>

420
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.541
<v Speaker 3>she got doing that television show and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she got bronchitis and she was </v>

421
00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:52.630
<v Speaker 3>overworked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she's stressing the fuck out.</v>

422
00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.230
<v Speaker 3>She also told me that she did not know </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that lady was even black.</v>

423
00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:59.000
<v Speaker 3>She thought that lady was Jewish and she</v>
<v Speaker 3>said to me like,</v>

424
00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:02.350
<v Speaker 3>do you really think that I would make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>joke about a black lady and say,</v>

425
00:20:02.351 --> 00:20:04.210
<v Speaker 3>planet aches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't fucking do that.</v>

426
00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:05.710
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought she was Jewish.</v>

427
00:20:05.711 --> 00:20:10.711
<v Speaker 3>Look at her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I did look at her like pull up her </v>

428
00:20:10.711 --> 00:20:11.050
<v Speaker 3>wikipedia page.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This lady,</v>

429
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.870
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

430
00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean she most certainly pull it up so </v>
<v Speaker 3>we could see it.</v>

431
00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:23.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean she most certainly could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>African American for sure,</v>

432
00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:29.730
<v Speaker 3>but she also most certainly could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>like Hawaiian or native American or</v>

433
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.280
<v Speaker 2>point ban the Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she thought Jewish.</v>

434
00:20:33.281 --> 00:20:34.540
<v Speaker 2>Those what Roseanne said?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish.</v>

435
00:20:34.541 --> 00:20:36.580
<v Speaker 2>This is what she said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not know.</v>

436
00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:40.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she's lying to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she's racist.</v>

437
00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.020
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever had an Ambien?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

438
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:47.030
<v Speaker 2>I've never taken him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I talked to here ever taken a good </v>

439
00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:47.080
<v Speaker 2>friend of mine about it today and he</v>

440
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 3>got up</v>

441
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.490
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooked himself a meal,</v>

442
00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:52.480
<v Speaker 1>eight it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to sleep,</v>

443
00:20:52.481 --> 00:20:55.630
<v Speaker 1>got up in the morning and had no </v>
<v Speaker 1>recollection of it.</v>

444
00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:00.660
<v Speaker 1>He had to be told that he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to figure out who put the </v>

445
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:01.780
<v Speaker 1>plates in the sink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who ate this food,</v>

446
00:21:01.781 --> 00:21:03.370
<v Speaker 1>where this food comes from and couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure it out.</v>

447
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.130
<v Speaker 1>He got up in the middle of the night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't remember a thing,</v>

448
00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:07.960
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And cooked himself a meal,</v>

449
00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:09.100
<v Speaker 1>sat down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ate,</v>

450
00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:11.530
<v Speaker 1>and went back to bed at zero </v>
<v Speaker 1>recollection of it.</v>

451
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.730
<v Speaker 1>I said to this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shit out of it during that meal.</v>

452
00:21:14.731 --> 00:21:17.460
<v Speaker 1>At any point did he get racist or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that?</v>

453
00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:19.080
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

454
00:21:19.081 --> 00:21:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Like he's literally buckets one thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a spooky story.</v>

455
00:21:22.441 --> 00:21:27.441
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took ambien and I made myself some </v>

456
00:21:27.441 --> 00:21:27.441
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an even spookier story to be like,</v>

457
00:21:27.441 --> 00:21:28.590
<v Speaker 1>I took ambien and I fucking killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>

458
00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.190
<v Speaker 1>But it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a stretch to be like it is.</v>

459
00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:35.520
<v Speaker 1>I took ambien and I said something I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would never say in a million years.</v>

460
00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:40.550
<v Speaker 1>It heartens me to hear you say that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>said that she wasn't aware of the ladies</v>

461
00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.990
<v Speaker 1>race because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

462
00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know her all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know her from his Roseanne.</v>

463
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know her from his decades of watching </v>

464
00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.310
<v Speaker 1>her and media or TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I followed it before the TV show.</v>

465
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't seem like</v>

466
00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.130
<v Speaker 1>the Roseanne that I've watched for 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years.</v>

467
00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:02.810
<v Speaker 3>Well see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing.</v>

468
00:22:02.811 --> 00:22:07.811
<v Speaker 3>I'm not close to her on a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have tremendous respect for her as a </v>

469
00:22:07.811 --> 00:22:09.020
<v Speaker 3>comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

470
00:22:09.021 --> 00:22:14.021
<v Speaker 3>I think she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was a real pioneer and a lot of </v>

471
00:22:14.021 --> 00:22:14.021
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was this brash,</v>

472
00:22:14.021 --> 00:22:18.850
<v Speaker 3>like really confident lady who shit on </v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid men and she did it and it's like </v>

473
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.800
<v Speaker 3>really bold way and stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was very unique for the time.</v>

474
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:30.070
<v Speaker 3>I think if people go back and you watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of her early standup when she was </v>

475
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.470
<v Speaker 3>coming out of Denver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the domestic goddess,</v>

476
00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.790
<v Speaker 3>she was a beast man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was obese.</v>

477
00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.090
<v Speaker 3>She was crushing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was crushing,</v>

478
00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:40.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then she got that Sitcom and it's </v>

479
00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:40.120
<v Speaker 3>absolutely one of the greatest sitcoms </v>
<v Speaker 3>of all time.</v>

480
00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:44.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But now she's 65 years old and it's </v>

481
00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:46.340
<v Speaker 3>fucking hard for her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that schedule she was telling me was</v>

482
00:22:46.341 --> 00:22:49.550
<v Speaker 3>absolutely brutal and that they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>killing her with all the work.</v>

483
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't know her very well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do know there was another time </v>

484
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.120
<v Speaker 3>where she said something about Susan </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rice who is a,</v>

485
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.050
<v Speaker 3>another African American woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she,</v>

486
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:06.040
<v Speaker 3>she said something about her and </v>
<v Speaker 3>compared to her balls.</v>

487
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:09.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something like swinging eight balls,</v>

488
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:12.460
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's two for two.</v>

489
00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:14.020
<v Speaker 3>It's two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

490
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.790
<v Speaker 3>Well this one for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

491
00:23:15.791 --> 00:23:17.580
<v Speaker 3>Because this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no excuse for this.</v>

492
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:20.500
<v Speaker 3>This is one from the past that there was</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

493
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:21.490
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

494
00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.930
<v Speaker 3>I was on Ambien.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tweeted this.</v>

495
00:23:22.931 --> 00:23:27.931
<v Speaker 3>No one said anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Susan Rice is a man with a big swinging </v>

496
00:23:27.931 --> 00:23:27.931
<v Speaker 3>ape balls</v>

497
00:23:27.931 --> 00:23:29.890
<v Speaker 1>and that wasn't meant to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>compliment.</v>

498
00:23:29.891 --> 00:23:31.060
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>13.</v>

499
00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a long time ago.</v>

500
00:23:33.191 --> 00:23:34.870
<v Speaker 1>That's five years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

501
00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:36.000
<v Speaker 1>and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

502
00:23:36.001 --> 00:23:39.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's still available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you can go through a timeline and</v>

503
00:23:39.041 --> 00:23:42.700
<v Speaker 1>see a bunch of things that are not like </v>
<v Speaker 1>a comedian being funny,</v>

504
00:23:42.701 --> 00:23:43.400
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

505
00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs,</v>

506
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:45.890
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

507
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.590
<v Speaker 3>That one is um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doubts are rough.</v>

508
00:23:48.591 --> 00:23:50.840
<v Speaker 3>One.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That to me is a way rougher one.</v>

509
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.720
<v Speaker 3>It's way rougher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that one is like,</v>

510
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:56.420
<v Speaker 3>that's what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is what it is.</v>

511
00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:01.510
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you said that the other lady looked </v>

512
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.510
<v Speaker 3>like planet of the apes just because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>her haircut,</v>

513
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:03.800
<v Speaker 3>because she looks like the lead woman in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sierra.</v>

514
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She looked like zero.</v>

515
00:24:05.181 --> 00:24:08.660
<v Speaker 3>There was like a photo of her back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just like the way her haircut was</v>

516
00:24:08.661 --> 00:24:12.090
<v Speaker 3>and her outfit was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some people would,</v>

517
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.750
<v Speaker 3>but if you didn't know that she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>black,</v>

518
00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.450
<v Speaker 3>it's a totally different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

519
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Do we know that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

520
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.120
<v Speaker 3>only she knows for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

521
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Are you surprised at how quickly it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>ended?</v>

522
00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Well that was the part of the story that</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

523
00:24:30.381 --> 00:24:35.381
<v Speaker 1>I have no skin in the game other than I </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched the old Roseanne and I was </v>

524
00:24:35.381 --> 00:24:39.761
<v Speaker 1>enjoying the new Roseanne as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I came home from like I was vegas </v>

525
00:24:39.761 --> 00:24:44.351
<v Speaker 1>the other day and I flew home yesterday </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and then I had a meeting over </v>

526
00:24:44.351 --> 00:24:47.480
<v Speaker 1>the studios like at noon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I took a nap when I go home,</v>

527
00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:52.770
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also my wife wakes me up and she </v>

528
00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:52.770
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a meeting,</v>

529
00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:53.390
<v Speaker 1>don't forget like it's 1130.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

530
00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:55.670
<v Speaker 1>And Roseanne's been canceled and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

531
00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:57.650
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's impossible.</v>

532
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Like I was groggy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like that's impossible.</v>

533
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:02.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like 20 million people are watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>that show.</v>

534
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.750
<v Speaker 1>And she said she tweeted something </v>
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>

535
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:08.540
<v Speaker 1>so I'm fucking pick up my phone and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it and stuff.</v>

536
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:13.600
<v Speaker 1>And by the time like this had happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the span of like the hour I took a </v>

537
00:25:13.881 --> 00:25:15.780
<v Speaker 1>fucking nap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

538
00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:18.890
<v Speaker 1>the network acted so fucking incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>

539
00:25:18.891 --> 00:25:20.730
<v Speaker 1>There was no prevarication equivocation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

540
00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Do they have that ax sharpened and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ready?</v>

541
00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.430
<v Speaker 1>It was not like all of a sudden they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were just like,</v>

542
00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:27.860
<v Speaker 1>we're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know or disavow.</v>

543
00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:28.830
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

544
00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:33.890
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was so surprising because </v>

545
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:38.050
<v Speaker 1>it's been awhile since somebody did </v>
<v Speaker 1>something even superficially a moral,</v>

546
00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:46.480
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've read a lot of articles online </v>

547
00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:46.480
<v Speaker 1>where people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

548
00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.380
<v Speaker 1>abc didn't own the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So of course they fucking had,</v>

549
00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.950
<v Speaker 1>didn't have as much skin in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was easy for them to cancel it.</v>

550
00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Would they have canceled with this fast?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they own the show and dot,</v>

551
00:25:53.751 --> 00:25:54.470
<v Speaker 1>dot dot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

552
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:59.710
<v Speaker 1>you can make a bunch of kind of caveats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the end of the day something bad </v>

553
00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:03.410
<v Speaker 1>happened and then the network reacted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A major come fuck the network.</v>

554
00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.730
<v Speaker 1>A major company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Major Corporation reacted.</v>

555
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.850
<v Speaker 3>That is the right way to handle it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to just immediately cancel the show.</v>

556
00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:14.960
<v Speaker 1>I personally would have maybe fired her </v>
<v Speaker 1>and kept everybody else done.</v>

557
00:26:15.031 --> 00:26:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

558
00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Valerie never die off or just use </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer animation.</v>

559
00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:22.080
<v Speaker 1>I could replace it with the pixars </v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

560
00:26:22.081 --> 00:26:27.081
<v Speaker 1>but I think you can sell it equally </v>
<v Speaker 1>compelling stories like without her </v>

561
00:26:27.081 --> 00:26:28.980
<v Speaker 1>honestly like the nine episodes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done this season.</v>

562
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:32.660
<v Speaker 1>She really hasn't been the driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor of stories.</v>

563
00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:37.670
<v Speaker 1>It's been more about Darlene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's who I felt bad for when this </v>

564
00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:38.040
<v Speaker 1>whole thing imploded because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's.</v>

565
00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.640
<v Speaker 1>She put this show together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Gilbert,</v>

566
00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.030
<v Speaker 1>and she was crushing on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like</v>

567
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:49.040
<v Speaker 2>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Showing off like what a great actress </v>

568
00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.040
<v Speaker 2>she is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now everybody's out of job.</v>

569
00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.191
<v Speaker 2>Feel bad for John Goodman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've worked with him before and he was </v>

570
00:26:52.191 --> 00:26:54.000
<v Speaker 2>wonderful on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could sustain the show without her.</v>

571
00:26:54.001 --> 00:26:55.590
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can She be forgiven?</v>

572
00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:57.660
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

573
00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:02.680
<v Speaker 2>Ken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't Mel Gibson get forgiven as any </v>

574
00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:02.680
<v Speaker 2>working again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mel,</v>

575
00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.051
<v Speaker 2>Mel Gibson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was also a case of him being </v>

576
00:27:06.051 --> 00:27:06.750
<v Speaker 2>intoxicated right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was yelling some antisemitic stuff at</v>

577
00:27:06.751 --> 00:27:07.400
<v Speaker 2>a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

578
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:12.470
<v Speaker 2>nevermind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That also punch his ex wife like </v>

579
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:14.220
<v Speaker 2>violence action than him just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

580
00:27:14.221 --> 00:27:19.221
<v Speaker 2>sugar tits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there were some that his wife had </v>

581
00:27:19.221 --> 00:27:20.160
<v Speaker 2>recorded them or recording them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yelling at her on the phone.</v>

582
00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.340
<v Speaker 2>So we had nobody knows if he truly hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

583
00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:24.420
<v Speaker 2>my bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was,</v>

584
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:25.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

585
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the specifics of any accusation and</v>

586
00:27:28.801 --> 00:27:32.340
<v Speaker 2>also I also didn't follow it that </v>
<v Speaker 2>closely and not because I'm like,</v>

587
00:27:32.341 --> 00:27:37.341
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Martin Riggs and I don't want to </v>

588
00:27:37.341 --> 00:27:37.341
<v Speaker 2>hear anything bad about him.</v>

589
00:27:37.341 --> 00:27:37.341
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't follow it because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

590
00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

591
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:43.200
<v Speaker 2>can she be forgiven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forgiven?</v>

592
00:27:43.201 --> 00:27:44.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean look,</v>

593
00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:49.650
<v Speaker 2>she should have tweeted what you said </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of a,</v>

594
00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took ambien.</v>

595
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:56.480
<v Speaker 2>Like that turned into an opportunity for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a major pharmaceutical company to put </v>

596
00:27:57.241 --> 00:27:59.390
<v Speaker 2>out one of the best singers twitter's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever seen.</v>

597
00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.640
<v Speaker 2>Like this is a company they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>normally used to like,</v>

598
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:04.740
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what should we say to be funny?</v>

599
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:08.400
<v Speaker 2>Like they have to put out very staid </v>
<v Speaker 2>information and for once they were like,</v>

600
00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:12.340
<v Speaker 2>how about this guys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We say racism isn't a byproduct of.</v>

601
00:28:12.341 --> 00:28:15.030
<v Speaker 2>It was really well said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was this was well worded.</v>

602
00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:17.190
<v Speaker 2>You sit there and go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why didn't I tweet that?</v>

603
00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:19.290
<v Speaker 2>Whoever wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was whoever wrote it rather.</v>

604
00:28:19.291 --> 00:28:23.490
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty slick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the thing ambient does do though and</v>

605
00:28:23.491 --> 00:28:25.560
<v Speaker 2>definitely makes you act bizarre.</v>

606
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.050
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some sleep,</v>

607
00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.110
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you just.</v>

608
00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:35.160
<v Speaker 2>There's a smoke weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat edibles.</v>

609
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.360
<v Speaker 2>That would help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

610
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:41.750
<v Speaker 2>There's websites dedicated to people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have had crazy experiences on that </v>

611
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.750
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a few of those stories.</v>

612
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.760
<v Speaker 2>The one that you told me about your </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend cooking dinner is about the </v>

613
00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.270
<v Speaker 2>fourth time somebody communicate that </v>
<v Speaker 2>story now because they've been listening</v>

614
00:28:48.271 --> 00:28:50.520
<v Speaker 2>to your show and you may have sold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ted said that story.</v>

615
00:28:50.521 --> 00:28:55.521
<v Speaker 2>Probably have people drive cars on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go places that don't realize what </v>

616
00:28:55.561 --> 00:29:00.561
<v Speaker 2>they're doing to get places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the serpent and the rainbow </v>

617
00:29:00.561 --> 00:29:00.561
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You become zombified and you're like,</v>

618
00:29:00.561 --> 00:29:02.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm not your bill pullman and a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>casket.</v>

619
00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:03.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a.</v>

620
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:08.480
<v Speaker 2>There was a guy that got pulled over a </v>
<v Speaker 2>few years back who was famous and I </v>

621
00:29:08.521 --> 00:29:10.110
<v Speaker 2>forget what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something about like,</v>

622
00:29:10.111 --> 00:29:12.180
<v Speaker 2>I got to get to the dance or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

623
00:29:12.181 --> 00:29:14.460
<v Speaker 2>and the cops were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck you talking about?</v>

624
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:18.360
<v Speaker 2>And they realized like he was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of it and then after it was over,</v>

625
00:29:18.361 --> 00:29:21.660
<v Speaker 2>it was revealed that he had been on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ambien and that he had gotten in his car</v>

626
00:29:21.661 --> 00:29:24.440
<v Speaker 2>and really had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't even know he was traveling.</v>

627
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm over like literally the guy was in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dream.</v>

628
00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:30.390
<v Speaker 2>It reminds me of when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was not drug related,</v>

629
00:29:30.391 --> 00:29:31.590
<v Speaker 2>but I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was asleep.</v>

630
00:29:31.591 --> 00:29:34.290
<v Speaker 2>I fell asleep on the couch watching TV </v>
<v Speaker 2>and before my,</v>

631
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:39.310
<v Speaker 2>like my brother had lost his fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>wallet at a school dance and my mother </v>

632
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:43.311
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll drive you up there and try to find </v>

633
00:29:43.311 --> 00:29:43.311
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my father would get up for work</v>

634
00:29:43.311 --> 00:29:44.950
<v Speaker 1>at about 9:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>at night and then had to work at 10:00</v>

635
00:29:44.951 --> 00:29:46.780
<v Speaker 1>and I think he started working at 11:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>at night.</v>

636
00:29:46.781 --> 00:29:49.030
<v Speaker 1>He worked at the post office cancel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking stamps.</v>

637
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he,</v>

638
00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.070
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

639
00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:57.140
<v Speaker 1>my mom tells me that and I fall asleep </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the couch watching like fucking </v>

640
00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.871
<v Speaker 1>dynasty or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the eighties and then my dad </v>

641
00:30:00.871 --> 00:30:01.540
<v Speaker 1>wakes me up because he woke up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody was home.</v>

642
00:30:01.541 --> 00:30:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Like my mom wasn't around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody was there and he's like,</v>

643
00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.660
<v Speaker 1>where is everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he fucking startled me awake.</v>

644
00:30:07.661 --> 00:30:08.500
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

645
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Donald,</v>

646
00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:15.510
<v Speaker 1>they had to go to the school because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald lost his thriller and my father </v>

647
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:15.510
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

648
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.380
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald last is thriller.</v>

649
00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.180
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're saying.</v>

650
00:30:19.181 --> 00:30:24.181
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dot mom said that Donald losses </v>

651
00:30:24.181 --> 00:30:26.910
<v Speaker 1>thriller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I kept replacing the word wallet </v>

652
00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:27.850
<v Speaker 1>with fucking thriller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my father looked at me and literally</v>

653
00:30:27.851 --> 00:30:31.180
<v Speaker 1>sent these out the next day to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you using drugs?</v>

654
00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:32.050
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

655
00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.050
<v Speaker 1>you woke me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was in some sort of,</v>

656
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:37.990
<v Speaker 1>maybe I was dreaming about fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>thriller was 1982,</v>

657
00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:39.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like eight brain just never clicked back</v>

658
00:30:39.941 --> 00:30:44.941
<v Speaker 1>over into waking life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stayed in this weird Zombie land where </v>

659
00:30:44.941 --> 00:30:44.941
<v Speaker 1>we're wallet meant thriller.</v>

660
00:30:44.941 --> 00:30:46.990
<v Speaker 3>Did you find that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

661
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:52.950
<v Speaker 3>what we were looking at got pulled over </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm trying to remember what he told </v>

662
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:53.030
<v Speaker 3>the cops where they realized that </v>
<v Speaker 3>something was going on.</v>

663
00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:58.420
<v Speaker 3>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was in one of the articles that I </v>

664
00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:58.420
<v Speaker 3>tweeted the store was in one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>articles that I tweeted.</v>

665
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.920
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens in that instance?</v>

666
00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:05.930
<v Speaker 3>You get in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can they rescue for being the ambient </v>

667
00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:09.551
<v Speaker 3>driver?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a rare reaction because a lot of </v>

668
00:31:09.551 --> 00:31:11.690
<v Speaker 3>people take that shit right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This story all the time.</v>

669
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:15.710
<v Speaker 3>There's not selling just a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those pills a day,</v>

670
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:21.180
<v Speaker 3>a webpage devoted to stories of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who took ambien and got fired for being </v>

671
00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:21.620
<v Speaker 3>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's right.</v>

672
00:31:21.621 --> 00:31:22.640
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even better,</v>

673
00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:26.660
<v Speaker 3>there's no stories of people that took </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ambien and,</v>

674
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:27.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Pr.</v>

691
00:31:56.290 --> 00:32:00.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it dulls the senses to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where like when you.</v>

692
00:32:00.051 --> 00:32:05.051
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the way I heroin's always </v>
<v Speaker 1>explained to me was when you're on </v>

693
00:32:05.661 --> 00:32:07.880
<v Speaker 1>heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the senses are dulled.</v>

694
00:32:07.881 --> 00:32:11.330
<v Speaker 1>The nerve receptors like just don't take</v>
<v Speaker 1>in as much,</v>

695
00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:15.530
<v Speaker 1>but when you're not on heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pain of withdrawal,</v>

696
00:32:15.531 --> 00:32:20.531
<v Speaker 1>part of it is the receptors coming back </v>
<v Speaker 1>to life all at once and it was a light </v>

697
00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.170
<v Speaker 1>skinned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

698
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Jason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jason Muse.</v>

699
00:32:23.691 --> 00:32:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Long time ago I had problems with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

700
00:32:25.251 --> 00:32:28.820
<v Speaker 1>So it was one of the Rehab doctors </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicated it thusly.</v>

701
00:32:28.821 --> 00:32:33.821
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how when you sit on your hand </v>

702
00:32:33.821 --> 00:32:33.821
<v Speaker 1>and fucking falls asleep?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

703
00:32:33.821 --> 00:32:33.821
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

704
00:32:33.821 --> 00:32:38.441
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that was your whole body and </v>

705
00:32:38.441 --> 00:32:38.441
<v Speaker 1>times it by a million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's going through.</v>

706
00:32:38.441 --> 00:32:38.441
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like,</v>

707
00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:39.020
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then.</v>

708
00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because up until then I</v>

709
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.800
<v Speaker 2>was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just fucking stop doing heroin.</v>

710
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:45.110
<v Speaker 2>Just stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then meanwhile I was eating a lot of</v>

711
00:32:45.111 --> 00:32:46.590
<v Speaker 2>sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just stop doing your job.</v>

712
00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:52.200
<v Speaker 2>You might fucking drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But once that dude explained it that </v>

713
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:52.200
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

714
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:52.220
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be.</v>

715
00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:57.790
<v Speaker 2>That would be fucking painful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No wonder the kid doesn't want to get </v>

716
00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:00.971
<v Speaker 2>off heroin because he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the path to not being on heroin </v>

717
00:33:00.971 --> 00:33:04.280
<v Speaker 2>is full of pins and needles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you never die from it.</v>

718
00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:09.340
<v Speaker 2>That's the good thing about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't die from heroin </v>

719
00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.831
<v Speaker 2>withdrawal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know from amy winehouse and other </v>

720
00:33:11.831 --> 00:33:14.930
<v Speaker 2>cases that you can die from alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 2>withdrawal like you can.</v>

721
00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:19.960
<v Speaker 2>You can get off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're in jail and you're </v>

722
00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:20.690
<v Speaker 2>kicking heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the cops just be like,</v>

723
00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:23.300
<v Speaker 2>you know the hair just keep throwing up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and piss in,</v>

724
00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:26.720
<v Speaker 2>but if you're kicking booze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to give you booze because your</v>

725
00:33:26.721 --> 00:33:27.350
<v Speaker 2>heart could stop.</v>

726
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.880
<v Speaker 2>What are we looking at?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This fucking article,</v>

727
00:33:28.881 --> 00:33:33.881
<v Speaker 2>he pulled up an estimated 446,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the United States were current</v>

728
00:33:34.671 --> 00:33:39.671
<v Speaker 2>hmis users of Ambien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what is the misuse and dependency </v>

729
00:33:40.101 --> 00:33:43.310
<v Speaker 2>onto ambien can develop after just two </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks of use.</v>

730
00:33:43.311 --> 00:33:48.311
<v Speaker 2>Don't attempt to quit without proper </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge and before putting a medical </v>

731
00:33:48.311 --> 00:33:50.300
<v Speaker 2>treatment plan into place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

732
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:55.450
<v Speaker 2>Two weeks is all it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two weeks [inaudible] son maybe driving </v>

733
00:33:56.361 --> 00:33:59.450
<v Speaker 2>around having conversations because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>uses Ambien,</v>

734
00:33:59.451 --> 00:34:03.890
<v Speaker 2>gets a good night's sleep and you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst that happens on the job in the</v>

735
00:34:03.891 --> 00:34:04.470
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

736
00:34:04.471 --> 00:34:07.460
<v Speaker 2>you kinda where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just lose a word like your leg.</v>

737
00:34:07.461 --> 00:34:12.461
<v Speaker 2>Donald last is thriller and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lowest mildest form of every now and </v>

738
00:34:12.461 --> 00:34:13.880
<v Speaker 2>then you skip a word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I do now.</v>

739
00:34:13.881 --> 00:34:17.360
<v Speaker 2>I call that hitting a pothole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roseanne is,</v>

740
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:22.450
<v Speaker 2>she's an older lady,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's in her sixties and she's had some </v>

741
00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:26.060
<v Speaker 2>mental problems and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's drinking and she's taking that</v>

742
00:34:26.061 --> 00:34:30.680
<v Speaker 2>stuff to go to sleep and she's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking it for just two weeks.</v>

743
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:32.480
<v Speaker 2>She's taking it a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

744
00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:36.410
<v Speaker 2>And she said she needs it to go to sleep</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think there's a lot of people that</v>

745
00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.100
<v Speaker 2>feel like they need something to help </v>
<v Speaker 2>them go to sleep that fine.</v>

746
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.210
<v Speaker 2>But then tweet ticket fucking works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

747
00:34:41.211 --> 00:34:46.211
<v Speaker 2>I don't think at the end of the day it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not like she took ambien and that makes </v>

748
00:34:46.211 --> 00:34:46.211
<v Speaker 2>her bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

749
00:34:46.211 --> 00:34:49.840
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that she fucking tweeted what you </v>

750
00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.451
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like if you think for a second </v>

751
00:34:52.451 --> 00:34:55.900
<v Speaker 2>that if in using this drug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I need to go to sleep because I'm </v>

752
00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:56.450
<v Speaker 2>late sixties woman and any of my rest or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

753
00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm at war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just deserve fucking sleep.</v>

754
00:34:59.031 --> 00:35:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've merciful,</v>

755
00:35:00.681 --> 00:35:02.300
<v Speaker 2>I've never suffered from a lack of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep,</v>

756
00:35:02.301 --> 00:35:05.030
<v Speaker 2>but I know that people who have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's fucking mind bending itself,</v>

757
00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.330
<v Speaker 2>but if you know you have to do that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

758
00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:13.660
<v Speaker 2>there's the slightest chance that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could become somebody else or say things</v>

759
00:35:13.911 --> 00:35:17.510
<v Speaker 2>that are not in your character,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give up your fucking social media man.</v>

760
00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't think she realized that she</v>
<v Speaker 2>was obviously going to do that.</v>

761
00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:27.070
<v Speaker 2>I think she had tweeted ridiculous shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the past before and had flew under </v>

762
00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:27.290
<v Speaker 2>the radar and nobody cared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

763
00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.030
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a racism thing,</v>

764
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:29.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's,</v>

765
00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:34.860
<v Speaker 2>what's fascinating to me about it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's positive to me about it is that </v>

766
00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:39.040
<v Speaker 2>we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our culture has like a fucking zero for </v>

767
00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:39.040
<v Speaker 2>racism</v>

768
00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.130
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It things have tightened up so much.</v>

769
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:46.850
<v Speaker 3>Like it's entirely possible that within </v>
<v Speaker 3>a few decades like racism can be almost </v>

770
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:52.560
<v Speaker 3>completely eradicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's possible with the spread of</v>

771
00:35:52.561 --> 00:35:55.200
<v Speaker 3>the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going into like 50 years from now,</v>

772
00:35:55.201 --> 00:36:00.201
<v Speaker 3>60 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>racism could be seen as the ridiculous </v>

773
00:36:00.201 --> 00:36:04.290
<v Speaker 3>idea that it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Racism can be seen the way someone looks</v>

774
00:36:04.291 --> 00:36:05.460
<v Speaker 3>at it or someone like Jane,</v>

775
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:09.020
<v Speaker 2>there'll be like a roddenberry world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be like star trek people.</v>

776
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:11.310
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe back in the day there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

777
00:36:11.311 --> 00:36:13.080
<v Speaker 2>but we haven't experienced that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>centuries.</v>

778
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:18.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The distrust in and hate for specific </v>

779
00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:23.060
<v Speaker 3>gigantic general groups of people like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Asians or blacks or whatever and the </v>

780
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:28.730
<v Speaker 3>disparaging ideas that you have about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>race just because they're,</v>

781
00:36:29.301 --> 00:36:34.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because a person's from a specific </v>

782
00:36:34.301 --> 00:36:34.301
<v Speaker 3>part of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit,</v>

783
00:36:34.301 --> 00:36:34.680
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be a thing of the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to get past that</v>

784
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:40.010
<v Speaker 2>because I would love to believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately we live in a bubble </v>

785
00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:40.020
<v Speaker 2>out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you live?</v>

786
00:36:40.021 --> 00:36:43.230
<v Speaker 2>In a bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does kind of work in it.</v>

787
00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:44.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at Dm.</v>

788
00:36:44.521 --> 00:36:49.521
<v Speaker 2>That's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard people out there about to </v>

789
00:36:49.521 --> 00:36:49.830
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>judge the fact that he's fucking sell in</v>

790
00:36:49.831 --> 00:36:51.570
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>California blows the one.</v>

791
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yay California,</v>

792
00:36:53.671 --> 00:36:55.560
<v Speaker 2>fuck the rest of the world of fuck the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the country.</v>

793
00:36:55.561 --> 00:37:00.561
<v Speaker 2>But I will say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone here lives fairly </v>

794
00:37:00.561 --> 00:37:01.770
<v Speaker 2>multiculturally and there doesn't seem </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>

795
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:04.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>granted we're in this area of the state.</v>

796
00:37:04.621 --> 00:37:08.190
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps it's different elsewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it feels.</v>

797
00:37:08.191 --> 00:37:13.191
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna say Utopian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it feels like people get along out </v>

798
00:37:13.191 --> 00:37:13.230
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's a plastic,</v>

799
00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:16.260
<v Speaker 2>get along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still get along pretty good.</v>

800
00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:21.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So much so that I think a lot of people </v>

801
00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:21.350
<v Speaker 2>in the state where that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

802
00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:23.910
<v Speaker 2>we're mystified when the election went </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way it did because they were like,</v>

803
00:37:23.911 --> 00:37:24.270
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

804
00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.330
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's not the way life works.</v>

805
00:37:27.331 --> 00:37:32.331
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the way life works in most of </v>

806
00:37:32.331 --> 00:37:32.550
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's the way it went for a</v>

807
00:37:32.551 --> 00:37:33.810
<v Speaker 2>bunch of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

808
00:37:33.811 --> 00:37:36.120
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the middle of the country </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't feel represented.</v>

809
00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:39.520
<v Speaker 2>A significant say when it comes to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

810
00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:42.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the um,</v>

811
00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:45.870
<v Speaker 2>what's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Electoral College vote.</v>

812
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:51.200
<v Speaker 2>That's when we get squirrely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the points that </v>

813
00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.390
<v Speaker 2>different states are worth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

814
00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:56.010
<v Speaker 2>it's very weird that we still have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a person,</v>

815
00:37:56.011 --> 00:37:57.000
<v Speaker 2>one person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one vote,</v>

816
00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:58.350
<v Speaker 2>not even one person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one vote.</v>

817
00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:02.850
<v Speaker 2>It's like these weird fucking spots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why isn't it one person,</v>

818
00:38:02.851 --> 00:38:03.450
<v Speaker 2>one vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

819
00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:07.500
<v Speaker 2>is this explained to me in high school </v>
<v Speaker 2>why the Electoral College was necessary?</v>

820
00:38:07.501 --> 00:38:09.480
<v Speaker 2>And even then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

821
00:38:09.481 --> 00:38:11.460
<v Speaker 2>but well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one person,</v>

822
00:38:11.461 --> 00:38:13.680
<v Speaker 2>one vote kind of makes more sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

823
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:17.570
<v Speaker 2>both you and I know Jack Shit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics makes this,</v>

824
00:38:17.571 --> 00:38:22.571
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this journey of where people are </v>

825
00:38:22.571 --> 00:38:22.860
<v Speaker 2>bleeding from their ears going fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>idiots,</v>

826
00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:24.660
<v Speaker 2>but the checks and balances that are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>play,</v>

827
00:38:24.661 --> 00:38:29.661
<v Speaker 2>like the representative government is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what keeps someone from just like </v>

828
00:38:29.661 --> 00:38:31.140
<v Speaker 2>running through the whole thing and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a little bit of a test to it by like</v>

829
00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:31.530
<v Speaker 2>trump.</v>

830
00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:34.770
<v Speaker 2>I met a buddy of yours on a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What guy?</v>

831
00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My favorite area.</v>

832
00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice guy.</v>

833
00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:42.930
<v Speaker 1>But here's what I want to pass on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we were on a 45 minute flight,</v>

834
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:48.630
<v Speaker 1>maybe super smooth like in and not in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way of like,</v>

835
00:38:49.571 --> 00:38:51.190
<v Speaker 1>hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Lando Calrissian.</v>

836
00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:56.640
<v Speaker 1>But this dude had a thing like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a rep parts and not like he wasn't </v>

837
00:38:56.751 --> 00:38:58.910
<v Speaker 1>like having sex with somebody but he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

838
00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:04.500
<v Speaker 1>a rep our tag going with the flight </v>
<v Speaker 1>attendant that was so effortless and you</v>

839
00:39:05.171 --> 00:39:10.171
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sit next to him and we chit chatted </v>

840
00:39:10.171 --> 00:39:10.171
<v Speaker 1>before the flight and I had mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about fucking Joe Rogan.</v>

841
00:39:10.171 --> 00:39:10.540
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

842
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.150
<v Speaker 1>I know Joe Rogan and he talks about like</v>
<v Speaker 1>content,</v>

843
00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:13.540
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>

844
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:16.660
<v Speaker 1>But in any event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of the flight,</v>

845
00:39:16.661 --> 00:39:21.661
<v Speaker 1>I had to like a front row seat for him </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to the flight attendant and it </v>

846
00:39:21.661 --> 00:39:24.580
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a real clinic in like,</v>

847
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:28.980
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's got that thing that like I,</v>

848
00:39:28.981 --> 00:39:32.110
<v Speaker 1>I've had to make up for not having my </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole life.</v>

849
00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:37.130
<v Speaker 1>But people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well not even just talking to people </v>

850
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:40.351
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the way like you watched like a </v>

851
00:39:40.351 --> 00:39:40.660
<v Speaker 1>fucking movie star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say two things.</v>

852
00:39:40.661 --> 00:39:42.970
<v Speaker 1>And the people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh you,</v>

853
00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:48.020
<v Speaker 1>you like he just had this person in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>palm of his hand and I'm being very </v>

854
00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:52.891
<v Speaker 1>careful because I don't want it to seem </v>
<v Speaker 1>like he was making the moves on her and </v>

855
00:39:52.891 --> 00:39:52.891
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't,</v>

856
00:39:52.891 --> 00:39:57.510
<v Speaker 1>but he easily could have been with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person by the flights end.</v>

857
00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:03.390
<v Speaker 1>And it was just as I sat there watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>it going like I've had to make up for a </v>

858
00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:04.150
<v Speaker 1>deficit in my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being like,</v>

859
00:40:04.151 --> 00:40:05.800
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's some funny things.</v>

860
00:40:05.801 --> 00:40:10.801
<v Speaker 1>And Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw star wars and talk about all this </v>

861
00:40:10.801 --> 00:40:10.801
<v Speaker 1>other shit to try to trick somebody into</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking me.</v>

862
00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.380
<v Speaker 1>This guy just like sits down on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plane,</v>

863
00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.260
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up,</v>

864
00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:15.190
<v Speaker 1>and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

865
00:40:15.191 --> 00:40:20.191
<v Speaker 1>you and instantly started going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to them and I was trying to </v>

866
00:40:20.191 --> 00:40:20.191
<v Speaker 1>discern throughout the whole flight.</v>

867
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Did they know each other as he see her </v>
<v Speaker 1>on this flight often or something?</v>

868
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:28.590
<v Speaker 1>No Dry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hit that flight as dry as anybody </v>

869
00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:32.101
<v Speaker 1>else and literally could have walked </v>
<v Speaker 1>away hand in hand with somebody who's </v>

870
00:40:32.101 --> 00:40:32.590
<v Speaker 1>very impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got bowhunter confidence.</v>

871
00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

872
00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.010
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

873
00:40:36.011 --> 00:40:37.690
<v Speaker 1>You exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even a regular bow hunter.</v>

874
00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:42.700
<v Speaker 1>He's like a super advanced bowhunter </v>
<v Speaker 1>where a compound bow was too easy for </v>

875
00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:42.700
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that,</v>

876
00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:43.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he switched over to a recurve bow,</v>

877
00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.500
<v Speaker 1>will cs to get closer to animals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice more.</v>

878
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:49.510
<v Speaker 1>He was explaining my friend Aaron </v>
<v Speaker 1>Snyder,</v>

879
00:40:49.511 --> 00:40:54.511
<v Speaker 1>he's a little bit crazy without even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was explaining that and it didn't </v>

880
00:40:54.511 --> 00:40:55.390
<v Speaker 1>sound braggy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a really good podcast.</v>

881
00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:58.030
<v Speaker 1>He said he's cast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it called?</v>

882
00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Kfar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] K I f a r U.</v>

883
00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:05.791
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a company that he works for that </v>

884
00:41:05.791 --> 00:41:08.221
<v Speaker 1>makes really high end hunting and hiking</v>
<v Speaker 1>backpacks and military backpacks and uh,</v>

885
00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:11.950
<v Speaker 1>he does a podcast through them and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said he's very good at it.</v>

886
00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.170
<v Speaker 1>He's very good at talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a funny dude.</v>

887
00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:19.200
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't fucking attest to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sat there and watched him be 100 </v>

888
00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:19.650
<v Speaker 1>confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

889
00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:20.440
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

890
00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:22.300
<v Speaker 1>He's not a swagger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's whole life.</v>

891
00:41:22.301 --> 00:41:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Like there was nothing about him that </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly.</v>

892
00:41:24.641 --> 00:41:29.641
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was definitely very macho,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was nothing about his thing </v>

893
00:41:29.641 --> 00:41:31.210
<v Speaker 1>that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a guy's guy.</v>

894
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like honestly flight attendant probably</v>

895
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.010
<v Speaker 3>could have been a guy in a barren was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just as interested in short,</v>

896
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:40.230
<v Speaker 3>short range bow hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would've landed that guy as well.</v>

897
00:41:40.231 --> 00:41:42.340
<v Speaker 3>Like he was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

898
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:44.420
<v Speaker 3>it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when he said I do a podcast too,</v>

899
00:41:44.421 --> 00:41:45.350
<v Speaker 3>it made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

900
00:41:45.351 --> 00:41:46.770
<v Speaker 3>I bet you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

901
00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:51.590
<v Speaker 3>smart dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's a weird way to live.</v>

902
00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:56.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it spends 200 nights a year in the </v>

903
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.400
<v Speaker 3>forest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sleeping in like either a bivy sack or a</v>

904
00:41:58.401 --> 00:42:00.890
<v Speaker 3>tent or under a tarp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fucking,</v>

905
00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:05.920
<v Speaker 3>just like Robin Hood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's out there all the time and it's </v>

906
00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.461
<v Speaker 3>like there's not a whole lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are doing that more woods than men.</v>

907
00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:12.200
<v Speaker 3>That's another guy was ex military too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of these ex military guys.</v>

908
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:17.230
<v Speaker 3>They get really in a bow hunting because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they find it very difficult in a </v>

909
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:17.960
<v Speaker 3>physical challenge.</v>

910
00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:21.020
<v Speaker 3>It's nerve wracking and it's hard to </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep your cool under pressure.</v>

911
00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:25.700
<v Speaker 3>And for a lot of guys who um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go from the military and maybe do a</v>

912
00:42:25.701 --> 00:42:30.701
<v Speaker 3>few tours overseas and come back to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mainland and just have a real issue with</v>

913
00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:36.100
<v Speaker 3>being just not stimulated enough and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel detached and you don't feel like </v>

914
00:42:36.291 --> 00:42:40.550
<v Speaker 3>you're involved in anything that's got </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a high adrenaline threshold.</v>

915
00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:44.180
<v Speaker 3>And for a lot of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bowhunting is very therapeutic.</v>

916
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:49.450
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is that an issue when people come </v>

917
00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:49.450
<v Speaker 3>back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

918
00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:50.030
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the issue I always hear about,</v>

919
00:42:50.031 --> 00:42:52.850
<v Speaker 3>of course there's ptsd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that sounds like the opposite.</v>

920
00:42:52.851 --> 00:42:57.851
<v Speaker 3>Like somebody who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was there for the rush and now the </v>

921
00:42:57.851 --> 00:42:59.510
<v Speaker 3>real world offers like that's that her </v>
<v Speaker 3>not even necessarily that there were,</v>

922
00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:01.580
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that hurt like hurt rock locker.</v>

923
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:03.980
<v Speaker 3>Not even necessarily that they're there </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the rush,</v>

924
00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:06.860
<v Speaker 3>but that once they experience that rush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

925
00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:12.360
<v Speaker 3>got to bring this book up too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Sebastian younger wrote a book </v>

926
00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.881
<v Speaker 3>called tribe and it's all about this and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about these guys coming back from </v>

927
00:43:15.881 --> 00:43:20.471
<v Speaker 3>war and trying to just sort of assemble </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and having a really difficult time </v>

928
00:43:20.661 --> 00:43:23.780
<v Speaker 3>and how so many of them talk about when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were over there,</v>

929
00:43:23.781 --> 00:43:28.730
<v Speaker 3>they had a purpose and that life was </v>
<v Speaker 3>intensified and cranked up to 10 and the</v>

930
00:43:28.731 --> 00:43:30.920
<v Speaker 3>highs were the highest and the lows were</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lowest.</v>

931
00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.620
<v Speaker 3>They come back here and everything's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just too flat.</v>

932
00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:38.980
<v Speaker 3>It's just really hard for them to adjust</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they feel disconnected from their </v>

933
00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:42.191
<v Speaker 3>community and they laid long to go back </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's why a lot of them keep </v>

934
00:43:42.191 --> 00:43:46.301
<v Speaker 3>signing up and going back and they feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that life at the tip of the spear </v>

935
00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.580
<v Speaker 3>is actually more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more satisfying,</v>

936
00:43:49.581 --> 00:43:54.581
<v Speaker 3>more rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just feels right for them and the </v>

937
00:43:54.581 --> 00:43:55.790
<v Speaker 3>regular world just for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've just tasted it or they've.</v>

938
00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:58.640
<v Speaker 3>They've adjusted to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there they have a very,</v>

939
00:43:58.641 --> 00:44:00.170
<v Speaker 3>very difficult time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them do.</v>

940
00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:03.530
<v Speaker 3>Was the closest you've ever felt to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

941
00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:09.160
<v Speaker 3>like have you ever gotten close to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling of like what have you done in </v>

942
00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.190
<v Speaker 3>life that has given you the adrenaline </v>
<v Speaker 3>high?</v>

943
00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:15.140
<v Speaker 3>What's your highest adrenaline rush?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'm asking the probably the most</v>

944
00:44:15.141 --> 00:44:20.141
<v Speaker 3>nervous I ever got was when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting when I was doing martial arts </v>

945
00:44:20.141 --> 00:44:20.930
<v Speaker 3>because there was a nervous for a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>

946
00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:26.140
<v Speaker 3>It's like you might get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really possible you might get </v>

947
00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:28.721
<v Speaker 3>kicked in the head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm the second most nervous was </v>

948
00:44:28.721 --> 00:44:30.860
<v Speaker 3>before I did stand up for the first time</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was shitting my pants man.</v>

949
00:44:30.861 --> 00:44:34.620
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

950
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:36.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm funny.</v>

951
00:44:36.570 --> 00:44:39.690
<v Speaker 3>Like were you high school funny?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was locker room funny.</v>

952
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:44.990
<v Speaker 3>I was A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would make my friends laugh in the </v>

953
00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:46.650
<v Speaker 3>locker room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got talked to by a good buddy of mine,</v>

954
00:44:46.651 --> 00:44:48.720
<v Speaker 3>my friend Steve Graham.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still good friends with.</v>

955
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:50.940
<v Speaker 3>He talked me into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>him and my friend Ed shorter,</v>

956
00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:52.320
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they talked me into it.</v>

957
00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:54.220
<v Speaker 3>I would make them laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

958
00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:59.480
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I thought that they were laughing </v>

959
00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:01.581
<v Speaker 3>because they were my friends and I felt </v>
<v Speaker 3>like everybody else gonna think I'm an </v>

960
00:45:01.581 --> 00:45:01.581
<v Speaker 3>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're just being polite.</v>

961
00:45:01.581 --> 00:45:02.750
<v Speaker 3>Well it's all that too.</v>

962
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:06.570
<v Speaker 3>And like my sense of humor was fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was all fighters,</v>

963
00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.670
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so everybody was like,</v>

964
00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:13.940
<v Speaker 3>they were hard men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you had to have like a certain </v>

965
00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:14.250
<v Speaker 3>staying to your gallows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Humor.</v>

966
00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:17.250
<v Speaker 3>Well everybody was on their way to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>kick people in the head.</v>

967
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.990
<v Speaker 3>It was just a weird life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

968
00:45:19.991 --> 00:45:22.680
<v Speaker 3>It was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very strange way to be 15.</v>

969
00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:24.720
<v Speaker 3>You now have 15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>16,</v>

970
00:45:24.721 --> 00:45:26.660
<v Speaker 3>17.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was like my whole life to.</v>

971
00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:31.440
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't the adrenaline rush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The adrenaline rush of doing standup was</v>

972
00:45:31.441 --> 00:45:36.441
<v Speaker 3>unexpected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I freaked me out because I </v>

973
00:45:36.441 --> 00:45:36.441
<v Speaker 3>didn't think I was going to be so </v>
<v Speaker 3>nervous and I was shitting my pants.</v>

974
00:45:36.441 --> 00:45:41.121
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't have a background in </v>
<v Speaker 3>performing and right before I was going </v>

975
00:45:41.121 --> 00:45:41.121
<v Speaker 3>up there I was thinking all the times </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I,</v>

976
00:45:41.121 --> 00:45:43.380
<v Speaker 3>I fought and I should be comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing this,</v>

977
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:47.250
<v Speaker 3>but I was fucking shit in my pants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so terrible.</v>

978
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:49.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I was so terrified.</v>

979
00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:51.660
<v Speaker 3>It was in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a place called stitches.</v>

980
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Are they still there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>August 27.</v>

981
00:45:53.501 --> 00:45:54.400
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 88?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

982
00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:54.900
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

983
00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:55.930
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The day.</v>

984
00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

985
00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:58.180
<v Speaker 1>You're making me cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

986
00:45:58.181 --> 00:45:59.560
<v Speaker 1>Why do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

987
00:45:59.561 --> 00:46:01.000
<v Speaker 1>I always remembered it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say it again.</v>

988
00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:04.720
<v Speaker 1>August 27,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1988 because then naturally everything I</v>

989
00:46:04.721 --> 00:46:07.210
<v Speaker 1>hear I have to put through a filter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>how does this affect me?</v>

990
00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.190
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sitting there going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was I doing?</v>

991
00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:10.840
<v Speaker 1>August 27th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1988.</v>

992
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.590
<v Speaker 1>I had just graduated high school in </v>
<v Speaker 1>June.</v>

993
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:20.430
<v Speaker 1>And where was I working?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was working at buyright liquors and </v>

994
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:20.650
<v Speaker 1>shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

995
00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:26.070
<v Speaker 1>and it would be two years before I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>go onto the stage at rascals in town </v>

996
00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:31.780
<v Speaker 1>between the monmouth mall in the CV </v>
<v Speaker 1>square mall and try it myself.</v>

997
00:46:31.781 --> 00:46:34.310
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't not tell West orange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's up north.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This place was like a couple miles from </v>

1000
00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:40.660
<v Speaker 1>asbury park south.</v>

1001
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:42.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that one too.</v>

1002
00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a pro.</v>

1003
00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:49.870
<v Speaker 1>I went in an open mic night just because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't tell my fucking friends because</v>

1004
00:46:49.871 --> 00:46:52.990
<v Speaker 1>I was terrified my friends and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you think you're funny and stuff.</v>

1005
00:46:52.991 --> 00:46:56.080
<v Speaker 1>I was not the funniest of my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I wasn't sitting there going like,</v>

1006
00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:57.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come support me.</v>

1007
00:46:57.941 --> 00:47:01.620
<v Speaker 1>I kind of did it on the slide and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I did five minutes.</v>

1008
00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:06.650
<v Speaker 1>I made like one joke that really worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit about sucking my dick and that </v>

1009
00:47:07.361 --> 00:47:11.260
<v Speaker 1>wound up in clerks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was tested in front of the audience.</v>

1010
00:47:11.261 --> 00:47:16.261
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I know that might get a laugh and </v>

<v Speaker 1>don't think I even had five minutes.</v>

1015

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1023
00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:38.230
<v Speaker 2>just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven had a piece of paper that I </v>

1024
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:41.020
<v Speaker 2>brought with me on stage because I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrified I was going to forget a lot of</v>

1025
00:47:41.021 --> 00:47:46.021
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knew you were a pro and you can put </v>

1026
00:47:46.021 --> 00:47:46.021
<v Speaker 2>that paper away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm about to cry.</v>

1027
00:47:46.021 --> 00:47:47.020
<v Speaker 2>That's so fucking sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1028
00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:48.640
<v Speaker 2>A young you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How old are you at this point?</v>

1029
00:47:48.641 --> 00:47:53.641
<v Speaker 2>It was 21.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why'd you wait so long after I have </v>

1030
00:47:53.641 --> 00:47:56.440
<v Speaker 2>to be 21 to get a little boost to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a nightclub,</v>

1031
00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:57.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I thought.</v>

1032
00:47:57.641 --> 00:47:59.600
<v Speaker 2>Apparently I was wrong though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>

1033
00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:01.600
<v Speaker 2>they would allow you as a performer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go in.</v>

1034
00:48:01.601 --> 00:48:04.090
<v Speaker 2>They're younger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know this at the time.</v>

1035
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.670
<v Speaker 2>I thought you had to be 21.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I waited until I was 21,</v>

1036
00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:09.730
<v Speaker 2>which was August 11th and then I went up</v>
<v Speaker 2>August 27th.</v>

1037
00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:12.280
<v Speaker 2>What was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what got the biggest laugh?</v>

1038
00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1039
00:48:14.081 --> 00:48:16.270
<v Speaker 2>the fucking day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>

1040
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:21.390
<v Speaker 2>The material was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to think past it as quickly as </v>

1041
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:21.790
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one joke that I remember,</v>

1042
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:27.230
<v Speaker 2>this is my impression of a good looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>girl getting pulled over by a cop like </v>

1043
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.230
<v Speaker 2>drilling fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going,</v>

1044
00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:29.170
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you like my tits?</v>

1045
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:31.000
<v Speaker 2>So I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a warning.</v>

1046
00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:34.500
<v Speaker 2>Like it was that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how bad.</v>

1047
00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:36.100
<v Speaker 2>That's how bad the comedy I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>slinging.</v>

1048
00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:41.560
<v Speaker 2>Take you home man and put you on a show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an adorable joke.</v>

1049
00:48:41.561 --> 00:48:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait a second.</v>

1050
00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:44.680
<v Speaker 2>How many years before news radio is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1051
00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:50.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm 88 was six years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So technically if one follows the </v>

1052
00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:54.661
<v Speaker 2>journey backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucking terrible joke lands you </v>

1053
00:48:54.661 --> 00:48:55.870
<v Speaker 2>eventually on Newsradio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1054
00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:57.590
<v Speaker 2>In a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get you this building.</v>

1055
00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a way that's not mock that joke </v>

1056
00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:03.170
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a good strong.</v>

1057
00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the weird wings of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>butterfly that becomes a hurricane.</v>

1058
00:49:04.541 --> 00:49:09.541
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like go back in your life and think </v>

1059
00:49:09.541 --> 00:49:09.541
<v Speaker 2>about weird little lefts you took or </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1060
00:49:09.541 --> 00:49:12.850
<v Speaker 2>You took a bunch of those when I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>three months ago at heart.</v>

1061
00:49:12.851 --> 00:49:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1062
00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Tech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was on the table,</v>

1063
00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:17.780
<v Speaker 1>because of the good doctor was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1064
00:49:17.781 --> 00:49:18.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1065
00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:21.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a 100 percent occlusion in your</v>

1066
00:49:21.621 --> 00:49:23.030
<v Speaker 1>lad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1067
00:49:23.031 --> 00:49:25.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

1068
00:49:25.061 --> 00:49:26.170
<v Speaker 1>your lad is your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1069
00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:28.430
<v Speaker 1>is the main artery that goes across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of your heart.</v>

1070
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:31.190
<v Speaker 1>He's going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a 100 percent occlusion,</v>

1071
00:49:31.191 --> 00:49:34.790
<v Speaker 1>means 100 percent blocked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got cholesterol is blocked,</v>

1072
00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:39.820
<v Speaker 1>there's no way for blood to get through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's creating your mass </v>

1073
00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:39.820
<v Speaker 1>part of tech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's like,</v>

1074
00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:39.820
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna.</v>

1075
00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Take care of it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1076
00:49:41.031 --> 00:49:42.590
<v Speaker 1>but you're accomplished guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1077
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:43.310
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1078
00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:44.720
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll like this,</v>

1079
00:49:44.721 --> 00:49:46.820
<v Speaker 1>that artery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's called the widow maker.</v>

1080
00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:47.870
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1081
00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:53.170
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because 80 percent of cases of 100 </v>

1082
00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:53.210
<v Speaker 1>percent occlusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the patient always dies.</v>

1083
00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.100
<v Speaker 1>He's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to be in the 20 percent</v>

1084
00:49:55.101 --> 00:49:56.240
<v Speaker 1>because I'm really good at my job.</v>

1085
00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:57.920
<v Speaker 1>And he fucking disappeared into my </v>
<v Speaker 1>crotch.</v>

1086
00:49:57.950 --> 00:50:01.880
<v Speaker 1>One of my grind through my femoral </v>
<v Speaker 1>artery and fucking went up into my heart</v>

1087
00:50:01.881 --> 00:50:04.730
<v Speaker 1>and put a stent in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that lad.</v>

1088
00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:06.560
<v Speaker 1>And the moment he opened up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

1089
00:50:06.561 --> 00:50:08.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna open it up now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he showed me what it was,</v>

1090
00:50:08.361 --> 00:50:10.310
<v Speaker 1>tiny little mesh wire thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1091
00:50:10.311 --> 00:50:12.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna open it froome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly it was like,</v>

1092
00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:18.320
<v Speaker 1>because that artery had been like a hose</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the it and it's fucking full of water</v>

1093
00:50:18.321 --> 00:50:19.850
<v Speaker 1>and shit and was pushing down on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart,</v>

1094
00:50:19.851 --> 00:50:21.530
<v Speaker 1>which was in turn pushing down on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>lungs.</v>

1095
00:50:21.531 --> 00:50:23.000
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea it was having a heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>

1096
00:50:23.001 --> 00:50:24.680
<v Speaker 1>I just felt like I couldn't catch my </v>
<v Speaker 1>breath.</v>

1097
00:50:24.681 --> 00:50:29.681
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was too hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was in between shows between two </v>

1098
00:50:29.681 --> 00:50:31.040
<v Speaker 1>gigs when you were filming?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shot them both while we were going to</v>

1099
00:50:31.041 --> 00:50:31.340
<v Speaker 1>shoot them.</v>

1100
00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Both my only shot the one because I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>the heart attack and we didn't do the </v>

1101
00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:36.340
<v Speaker 1>second one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was for,</v>

1102
00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:40.181
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the folks that commented dynamics </v>

1103
00:50:40.181 --> 00:50:42.371
<v Speaker 1>and it became a showtime special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were shooting two shows that </v>

1104
00:50:42.371 --> 00:50:46.001
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was meant to be like an hour and an </v>

1105
00:50:46.001 --> 00:50:46.001
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1106
00:50:46.001 --> 00:50:46.001
<v Speaker 1>once you get up there I feel like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking rolling.</v>

1107
00:50:46.001 --> 00:50:50.471
<v Speaker 1>I'm rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I did two hours and after the first </v>

1108
00:50:50.471 --> 00:50:53.381
<v Speaker 1>show they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't even need to do the second </v>

1109
00:50:53.381 --> 00:50:53.381
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can cut an that we're only cutting an</v>

1110
00:50:53.381 --> 00:50:53.630
<v Speaker 1>hour out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you gave us plenty and stuff.</v>

1111
00:50:53.631 --> 00:50:58.631
<v Speaker 1>I said I got two different hours so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do the second show and plus </v>

1112
00:50:58.631 --> 00:51:02.231
<v Speaker 1>everyone was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were lined up and so I took a big </v>

1113
00:51:02.231 --> 00:51:03.740
<v Speaker 1>swig of fucking milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was dairy drinker,</v>

1114
00:51:03.741 --> 00:51:05.360
<v Speaker 1>heavy dairy drinker in those days.</v>

1115
00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.860
<v Speaker 1>I've since become Vegan ice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be happy now.</v>

1116
00:51:07.861 --> 00:51:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1117
00:51:09.561 --> 00:51:14.561
<v Speaker 1>I took a big swig of milk then I went to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the green room and I chitchatted real </v>

1118
00:51:14.561 --> 00:51:16.940
<v Speaker 1>quick with Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who runs our company as Jason's wife,</v>

1119
00:51:16.941 --> 00:51:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Jason Muses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife.</v>

1120
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:19.670
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emily was there.</v>

1121

<v Speaker 1>So we're Chit Chat.</v>

1122
00:51:22.491 --> 00:51:23.120
<v Speaker 1>And then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1123
00:51:23.121 --> 00:51:24.620
<v Speaker 1>I feel fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel sick.</v>

1124
00:51:24.621 --> 00:51:26.420
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm gonna throw up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you guys get Outta here?</v>

1125
00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Because when I get sick I just want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go off like an animal and fucking die </v>

1126
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:34.541
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want to be ministered to </v>

00:51:34.541 --> 00:51:34.541
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like fuck off and shit.</v>

1128
00:51:34.541 --> 00:51:34.541

1129
00:51:34.541 --> 00:51:39.131
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I laid down on the floor and I felt </v>

1130
00:51:39.131 --> 00:51:41.950
<v Speaker 1>like nauseous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nauseated and I never feel sick like </v>

1131
00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:45.011
<v Speaker 1>that and wound up throwing up some bile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing chunky but just like fluid and </v>

1132
00:51:45.011 --> 00:51:46.310
<v Speaker 1>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well maybe I'll feel better now.</v>

1133
00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:48.980
<v Speaker 1>Stood up and I looked in the mirror and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just swamp man.</v>

1134
00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Like now as a heavy dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sweat when you fucking breathe.</v>

1135
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:57.670
<v Speaker 1>This was like I'd look like I'd just </v>
<v Speaker 1>come out of the pool and I felt really </v>

1136
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.710
<v Speaker 1>cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get warm and ship.</v>

1137
00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Emily popped her head and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you okay?</v>

1138
00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:01.540
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no man,</v>

1139
00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:03.920
<v Speaker 1>can you turn on like a hairdryer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just like drop me off.</v>

1140
00:52:03.921 --> 00:52:08.921
<v Speaker 1>I feel fucking freezing cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she touched back of my neck while </v>

1141
00:52:08.921 --> 00:52:08.921
<v Speaker 1>she's driving me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

1142
00:52:08.921 --> 00:52:09.920
<v Speaker 1>you never feel like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is scary.</v>

1143
00:52:09.921 --> 00:52:10.750
<v Speaker 1>You should do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

00:52:10.751 --> 00:52:11.300
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1145
00:52:11.301 --> 00:52:16.301
<v Speaker 1>I said I was still wanting to do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>second show as like someone to find a </v>

1146
00:52:16.301 --> 00:52:16.520
<v Speaker 1>couch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a cast for me to lay down.</v>

1147
00:52:16.521 --> 00:52:21.521
<v Speaker 1>If I get like a half hour nap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I'll be fucking fine and I </v>

1148
00:52:21.521 --> 00:52:24.260
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get comfortable on the couch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't sleep and that's when I started</v>

1149
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:26.480
<v Speaker 1>not being able to catch my fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>breath.</v>

1150
00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:32.140
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm no doctor but like fucking you </v>

1151
00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:32.140
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1152
00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:35.111
<v Speaker 1>I know my body and I know what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I smoke too much weed and I've got too </v>

1153
00:52:35.111 --> 00:52:36.410
<v Speaker 1>much mucus in my fucking chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all this is.</v>

1154
00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:41.360
<v Speaker 1>So I said I better sit up and put my </v>
<v Speaker 1>arms up like this because that will help</v>

1155
00:52:41.361 --> 00:52:46.361
<v Speaker 1>me breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Jordan comes around the corner </v>

1156
00:52:46.361 --> 00:52:46.940
<v Speaker 1>eventually and she sees me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

1157
00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:47.750
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1158
00:52:47.751 --> 00:52:49.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a hard time catching my breath.</v>

1159
00:52:49.971 --> 00:52:54.971
<v Speaker 1>I could breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't get all the way to the top </v>

1160
00:52:54.971 --> 00:52:54.971
<v Speaker 1>and stuff of the breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't take a full fucking breath.</v>

1161
00:52:55.010 --> 00:52:56.600
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I,</v>

1162
00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:59.270
<v Speaker 1>maybe we shouldn't do that second show </v>
<v Speaker 1>after all.</v>

1163
00:52:59.271 --> 00:53:00.770
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we already canceled it.</v>

1164
00:53:00.771 --> 00:53:05.771
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck did you cancel the second </v>

1165
00:53:05.771 --> 00:53:05.771
<v Speaker 1>show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>

1166
00:53:05.771 --> 00:53:05.771
<v Speaker 1>because I'd never seen you sick like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1167
00:53:05.771 --> 00:53:06.680
<v Speaker 1>She's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know this,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1170
00:53:08.271 --> 00:53:10.790
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should see a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she goes to Sunday night,</v>

<v Speaker 1>all doctors are closed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we called an ambulance.</v>

1172
00:53:12.651 --> 00:53:14.480
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck did you call an ambulance?</v>

00:56:05.491 --> 00:56:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm Dr Leighton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

1260
00:56:06.481 --> 00:56:07.130
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you?</v>

1261
00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:07.920
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong?</v>

1262
00:56:07.921 --> 00:56:08.470
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

1263
00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:09.930
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't catch my breath,</v>

1264
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:12.090
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1265
00:56:12.091 --> 00:56:13.800
<v Speaker 1>that's because you're having a massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart attack.</v>

1266
00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:16.980
<v Speaker 1>It was the first time anyone had said </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>

1267
00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:19.440
<v Speaker 1>How did he know for sure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he does.</v>

1268
00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:24.530
<v Speaker 1>I think what he knew for sure was when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they put the leads on me and the blood </v>

1269
00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:26.560
<v Speaker 1>pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they looked at each other at one point,</v>

1270
00:56:26.830 --> 00:56:29.320
<v Speaker 1>but I assumed like numbers that'll show </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1271
00:56:29.330 --> 00:56:34.330
<v Speaker 1>That'll indicate that something just </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and they made this wonderful </v>

1272
00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:34.330
<v Speaker 1>call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to find these kids,</v>

1273
00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:36.250
<v Speaker 1>give them a hug one day on the call </v>
<v Speaker 1>sheet,</v>

1274
00:56:36.251 --> 00:56:37.940
<v Speaker 1>because we were shooting that night on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the call sheet.</v>

1275
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:42.990
<v Speaker 1>It was a different hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they took me to Glendale adventist </v>

1276
00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:48.060
<v Speaker 1>because they knew that I was in having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cardiac episode and that's shy of one </v>

1277
00:56:49.271 --> 00:56:51.470
<v Speaker 1>hospital in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glendale,</v>

1278
00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Dale adventist is one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>cardiology wings in the United States of</v>

1279
00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:56.020
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

1280
00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.960
<v Speaker 1>So I happen to be in the right place at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right time.</v>

1281
00:56:58.961 --> 00:57:03.961
<v Speaker 1>We were supposed to shoot my comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>special at the Ryman Auditorium in </v>

1282
00:57:03.961 --> 00:57:03.961
<v Speaker 1>Nashville.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1283
00:57:03.961 --> 00:57:08.110
<v Speaker 1>it wound up being shot instead at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex in Glendale and stuff.</v>

1284
00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:10.870
<v Speaker 1>And if I hadn't been doing the show </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1285
00:57:11.110 --> 00:57:12.280
<v Speaker 1>who fucking knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1286
00:57:12.281 --> 00:57:17.281
<v Speaker 1>I might have gone to a hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I probably might've fucking died </v>

1287
00:57:17.281 --> 00:57:20.760
<v Speaker 1>because homeboy told me when he went up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the heart when I was in the operating </v>

1288
00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.000
<v Speaker 1>room and he told me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call that the widow maker and shit,</v>

1289
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:25.430
<v Speaker 1>80 percent 80 slash 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sat there going like,</v>

1290
00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:27.790
<v Speaker 1>these are the weirdest odds I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>had in my life.</v>

1291
00:57:27.791 --> 00:57:30.370
<v Speaker 1>I figured like you leave the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 50 slash 50,</v>

1292
00:57:30.371 --> 00:57:31.990
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fucking drop dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1293
00:57:31.991 --> 00:57:35.020
<v Speaker 1>They get hit by a car struck by </v>
<v Speaker 1>lightning trip of fucking dog.</v>

1294
00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:38.020
<v Speaker 1>And then the dog bite your juggler and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking bleed out your look.</v>

1295
00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:40.300
<v Speaker 1>But I always loved dogs and you die </v>
<v Speaker 1>ironically.</v>

1296
00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:41.520
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1297
00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:43.940
<v Speaker 1>just dragging along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the 80 slash 20 million,</v>

1298
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:46.570
<v Speaker 1>20 percent chance of life was fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up thought.</v>

1299
00:57:46.571 --> 00:57:48.730
<v Speaker 1>First time I'd ever had that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

1300
00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:52.120
<v Speaker 1>And in my head I had to cognitively </v>
<v Speaker 1>reframe it and go,</v>

1301
00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:55.630
<v Speaker 1>you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might've been close to death so many</v>

1302
00:57:55.631 --> 00:58:00.631
<v Speaker 1>fucking times in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There might've been like a cycle behind </v>

1303
00:58:00.631 --> 00:58:03.721
<v Speaker 1>you with a fucking knife and then all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sudden you got a cell phone call and </v>

1304
00:58:03.721 --> 00:58:06.420
<v Speaker 1>forgot about you or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So suddenly I repurposed it the whole </v>

1305
00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:10.500
<v Speaker 1>time I was laying on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get re purposing every not repurposed </v>

1306
00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:12.730
<v Speaker 1>and cognitively reframing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting because I couldn't like at</v>

1307
00:58:12.731 --> 00:58:14.530
<v Speaker 1>one point they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wife's on the phone.</v>

1308
00:58:14.531 --> 00:58:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to say you want to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>her?</v>

1309
00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:18.760
<v Speaker 1>After they told me that I was having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart attack and that they had to get up</v>

1310
00:58:18.761 --> 00:58:22.480
<v Speaker 1>and be fast and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they are holding up a phone and I see</v>

1311
00:58:22.481 --> 00:58:24.820
<v Speaker 1>it as the first time a crystallized </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I was like,</v>

1312
00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.700
<v Speaker 1>oh these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people think I'm going to die.</v>

1313
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in no pain whatsoever.</v>

1314
00:58:30.701 --> 00:58:33.130
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't catch my breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kept asking me like zero to 10.</v>

1315
00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:34.930
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your pain level?</v>

1316
00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:35.830
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative three.</v>

1317
00:58:35.831 --> 00:58:37.000
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing this wrong.</v>

1318
00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:42.300
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like I grew up in the </v>

1319
00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:42.790
<v Speaker 1>seventies watching Sanford and sons and </v>
<v Speaker 1>my idea of a heart attack is.</v>

1320
00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:45.940
<v Speaker 1>That's big and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Felt none of the symptoms.</v>

1321
00:58:45.941 --> 00:58:48.070
<v Speaker 1>No numbness in the arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything like that.</v>

1322
00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:51.050
<v Speaker 1>I was sweating a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I threw up bile.</v>

1323
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:52.520
<v Speaker 1>Bile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1324
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:55.120
<v Speaker 1>I was cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1325
00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:56.560
<v Speaker 1>and what was the last one?</v>

1326
00:58:56.590 --> 00:59:01.590
<v Speaker 1>It was just fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would never associate with a heart </v>

1327
00:59:01.590 --> 00:59:01.590
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he would associate it with like,</v>

1328
00:59:01.590 --> 00:59:01.600
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1329
00:59:01.601 --> 00:59:06.601
<v Speaker 1>I feel under the weather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But apparently these are symptoms of </v>

1330
00:59:06.601 --> 00:59:09.901
<v Speaker 1>heart attacks as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to share it because some cats </v>

1331
00:59:09.901 --> 00:59:13.051
<v Speaker 1>never heard that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen a lot of people on social </v>

1332
00:59:13.051 --> 00:59:13.051
<v Speaker 1>media since we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saved my life.</v>

1333
00:59:13.051 --> 00:59:17.671
<v Speaker 1>Here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I talked about the fucking </v>

1334
00:59:17.671 --> 00:59:19.410
<v Speaker 1>symptoms and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while I'm laying there and they go </v>

1335
00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:19.410
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're growing,</v>

1336
00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:21.320
<v Speaker 1>they go up your femoral artery to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart.</v>

1337
00:59:21.321 --> 00:59:26.321
<v Speaker 1>And stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went up and he saw that it was all </v>

1338
00:59:26.321 --> 00:59:26.321
<v Speaker 1>blocked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said later on,</v>

1339
00:59:26.321 --> 00:59:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck man.</v>

1340
00:59:26.751 --> 00:59:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Like I like dropped 80 pounds three </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

1341
00:59:28.851 --> 00:59:32.030
<v Speaker 1>I've been like walking up a hill a mile </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a half every day and stuff.</v>

1342
00:59:32.390 --> 00:59:32.900
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1343
00:59:32.901 --> 00:59:34.400
<v Speaker 1>but the kind of blockage you had.</v>

1344
00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:37.220
<v Speaker 1>You guys that didn't start fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>

1345
00:59:37.221 --> 00:59:39.290
<v Speaker 1>He's gotten that started in childhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1346
00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:39.860
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1347
00:59:39.861 --> 00:59:42.650
<v Speaker 1>fucking hostess twinkies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I remembered we had no money.</v>

1348
00:59:42.651 --> 00:59:43.460
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1349
00:59:43.461 --> 00:59:45.230
<v Speaker 1>fucking little debbie Swiss delights and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1350
00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:48.230
<v Speaker 1>That's how it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It started with little debbie cakes.</v>

1351
00:59:48.231 --> 00:59:50.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you because I was raised on him</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit,</v>

1352
00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:55.180
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were trained to like twinkies more </v>

1353
00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:57.191
<v Speaker 1>because they had a commercial little </v>
<v Speaker 1>debbie would never bother with the </v>

1354
00:59:57.191 --> 00:59:57.191
<v Speaker 1>commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then didn't have a commercial that did.</v>

1355
00:59:57.191 --> 00:59:59.030
<v Speaker 1>They know you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the leaders later they did,</v>

1356
00:59:59.031 --> 01:00:04.031
<v Speaker 1>but when we were kids they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>because how can you have a commercial </v>

1357
01:00:04.031 --> 01:00:05.260
<v Speaker 1>and sell your product for fifty nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>cents oyster cake?</v>

1358
01:00:05.410 --> 01:00:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Just like a better experience because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had more of those trans fats.</v>

1359
01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Trans fats back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1360
01:00:13.690 --> 01:00:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Colin's fats probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1361
01:00:16.101 --> 01:00:18.590
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trans fats are part of a.</v>

1362
01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:24.130
<v Speaker 1>When you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what were those cookies that were </v>

1363
01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:25.810
<v Speaker 1>not peak screens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1364
01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:30.010
<v Speaker 1>is like a white Oreo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goddammit.</v>

1365
01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:32.930
<v Speaker 1>I forget the name of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fairly well known,</v>

1366
01:00:32.931 --> 01:00:35.810
<v Speaker 1>but when I was a kid it was an older </v>
<v Speaker 1>brand from child,</v>

1367
01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:40.860
<v Speaker 1>some of my parents' childhood and Hydrox</v>
<v Speaker 1>hydrox their name hydrox comes from </v>

1368
01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:48.850
<v Speaker 1>hydrogen ised a palm oil or corn oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's when it began.</v>

1369
01:00:51.201 --> 01:00:51.650
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1370
01:00:51.651 --> 01:00:56.651
<v Speaker 1>we can take this and fuck it up and turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>it into something edible and shit like </v>

1371
01:00:56.651 --> 01:00:56.660
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not knowing you that block arteries,</v>

1372
01:00:57.410 --> 01:01:00.760
<v Speaker 1>but canola oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all that kind of nonsense stuff.</v>

1373
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:03.880
<v Speaker 1>But I went after a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to fucking get there.</v>

1374
01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:05.150
<v Speaker 1>It is hydraulic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1375
01:01:05.151 --> 01:01:10.151
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's named after a chemical that could </v>

1376
01:01:10.151 --> 01:01:10.151
<v Speaker 1>fucking kill you.</v>

1377
01:01:10.151 --> 01:01:10.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's how they marketed it back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>

1378
01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Kids Chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

1379
01:01:12.891 --> 01:01:15.110
<v Speaker 1>I used to fuck up some pepperidge farm </v>
<v Speaker 1>cookies.</v>

1380
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.320
<v Speaker 1>Remember those pepperidge farms talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a fat man.</v>

1381
01:01:18.321 --> 01:01:21.080
<v Speaker 1>I've eaten every cookie cookie there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>man with milk.</v>

1382
01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when they marketed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost almost home cookies,</v>

1383
01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:31.180
<v Speaker 1>almost home cookies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So essentially there was a craze and </v>

1384
01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:34.160
<v Speaker 1>still they still exist to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when we were children,</v>

1385
01:01:34.161 --> 01:01:37.130
<v Speaker 1>cookies were hard unless they came out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of an oven fresh.</v>

1386
01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Then they started serving these soft </v>
<v Speaker 1>bake cookies.</v>

1387
01:01:40.131 --> 01:01:45.131
<v Speaker 1>You can get them there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are almost tell them now I remain </v>

1388
01:01:45.131 --> 01:01:45.860
<v Speaker 1>your grocers island shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you'd take this cookie out of the</v>

1389
01:01:45.861 --> 01:01:49.610
<v Speaker 1>package and bite it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was soft as if it came out of the</v>

1390
01:01:49.611 --> 01:01:54.611
<v Speaker 1>oven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that too is a chemical process I </v>

1391
01:01:54.611 --> 01:01:56.180
<v Speaker 1>believe because things are meant to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard after they come home.</v>

1392
01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:58.460
<v Speaker 1>And it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

1393
01:01:58.461 --> 01:02:00.150
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like watching porn hard,</v>

1394
01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:05.200
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're eating some much that doesn't </v>

1395
01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:05.200
<v Speaker 1>turn into mold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>

1396
01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.070
<v Speaker 1>I went vegan post heart attack but I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly,</v>

1397
01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:11.300
<v Speaker 1>it's not an ethical thing like my kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegan because she's like,</v>

1398
01:02:11.301 --> 01:02:14.150
<v Speaker 1>I love animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I went vegan because they were like,</v>

1399
01:02:14.151 --> 01:02:19.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go plant based you've got a </v>

1400
01:02:19.151 --> 01:02:19.151
<v Speaker 1>really great chance of dropping your </v>
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol.</v>

1401
01:02:19.151 --> 01:02:22.080
<v Speaker 1>And my kid had been bugging me to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegan for like three years and stuff and</v>

1402
01:02:22.081 --> 01:02:23.340
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but honestly not bugging me.</v>

1403
01:02:23.341 --> 01:02:24.820
<v Speaker 1>She would just make comments every once </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a while,</v>

1404
01:02:24.821 --> 01:02:26.130
<v Speaker 1>like not your mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not your milk.</v>

1405
01:02:26.131 --> 01:02:31.131
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I was drinking milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so after the heart attack </v>

1406
01:02:31.131 --> 01:02:34.911
<v Speaker 1>nutritionist was in the hospital room </v>
<v Speaker 1>with mango and like 100 percent </v>

1407
01:02:34.911 --> 01:02:34.911
<v Speaker 1>blockage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1408
01:02:34.911 --> 01:02:36.080
<v Speaker 1>He definitely time to change your diet </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a gay.</v>

1409
01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Are you eating before?</v>

1410
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:41.730
<v Speaker 1>I just fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even like a lot of weight.</v>

1411
01:02:41.731 --> 01:02:43.280
<v Speaker 1>And when you lost lot of weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember you would do.</v>

1412
01:02:43.281 --> 01:02:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Doing a lot of juicing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1413
01:02:44.911 --> 01:02:49.911
<v Speaker 1>I was doing a bit of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which vegetable juices I've since told </v>

1414
01:02:49.911 --> 01:02:53.691
<v Speaker 1>me is not good because you're supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to distribute the juice of whatever with</v>

1415
01:02:56.011 --> 01:02:59.130
<v Speaker 1>the fiber while eating the fruit and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1416
01:02:59.131 --> 01:03:01.680
<v Speaker 1>This juicing thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what juice,</v>

1417
01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:03.960
<v Speaker 1>vegetable juice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really an issue,</v>

1418
01:03:04.090 --> 01:03:06.280
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1419
01:03:06.290 --> 01:03:11.290
<v Speaker 1>like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm part of now I'm a weight </v>

1420
01:03:11.290 --> 01:03:13.041
<v Speaker 1>watchers ambassador and people that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that like they,</v>

1421
01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.200
<v Speaker 1>they like vegetable juices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say that you really better off with</v>

1422
01:03:16.201 --> 01:03:21.201
<v Speaker 1>like a vegetable smoothie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you get the fiber it is all </v>

1423
01:03:21.201 --> 01:03:21.300
<v Speaker 1>about the smoothie and keep some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiber in it.</v>

1424
01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:26.380
<v Speaker 1>And the weight watchers diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go by points and shit like that or </v>

1425
01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:29.400
<v Speaker 1>some shit like you can if you eat a </v>
<v Speaker 1>banana,</v>

1426
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:34.640
<v Speaker 1>no points if you juice a banana or </v>
<v Speaker 1>blended banana than it has points </v>

1427
01:03:35.641 --> 01:03:37.620
<v Speaker 1>because then it's no longer about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiber.</v>

1428
01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:40.230
<v Speaker 1>It's all about the sugar at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Babies don't have any points anymore,</v>

1429
01:03:40.231 --> 01:03:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1430
01:03:40.861 --> 01:03:44.730
<v Speaker 1>they took points away from like eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkey and chicken,</v>

1431
01:03:44.731 --> 01:03:46.920
<v Speaker 1>which broke my heart because I used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>love Turkey chicken.</v>

1432
01:03:46.921 --> 01:03:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Then I realized I didn't love Turkey and</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken as much as I thought like I went</v>

1433
01:03:51.091 --> 01:03:55.030
<v Speaker 1>on in order to after the heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1434
01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:00.440
<v Speaker 1>I read a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened to it on tape and not even a </v>

1435
01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.520
<v Speaker 1>tape digitally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Penn Jillette's book.</v>

1436
01:04:02.521 --> 01:04:07.521
<v Speaker 1>Presto about how he lost 100 pounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>after his heart episode and it's a </v>

1437
01:04:07.521 --> 01:04:09.450
<v Speaker 1>fantastic book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you had a similar issue,</v>

1438
01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:11.370
<v Speaker 1>like a heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't have a heart attack.</v>

1439
01:04:11.371 --> 01:04:16.371
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on the fucking birds and they </v>

1440
01:04:16.371 --> 01:04:17.931
<v Speaker 1>were going to give them a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bypasses and then a friend of his was </v>

1441
01:04:17.931 --> 01:04:17.931
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of that,</v>

1442
01:04:17.931 --> 01:04:19.530
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just try eating radically </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

1443
01:04:19.530 --> 01:04:21.840
<v Speaker 1>I could propose a way for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ray Cronies,</v>

1444
01:04:21.850 --> 01:04:26.460
<v Speaker 1>he as a diet called just sides and so in</v>
<v Speaker 1>pens book Presto,</v>

1445
01:04:26.461 --> 01:04:29.280
<v Speaker 1>he details out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ray was like for the first two weeks,</v>

1446
01:04:29.281 --> 01:04:31.020
<v Speaker 1>just eat potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing but potatoes.</v>

1447
01:04:31.021 --> 01:04:33.420
<v Speaker 1>You have as many as you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He as many fucking potatoes as you want,</v>

1448
01:04:33.421 --> 01:04:38.421
<v Speaker 1>but you can't put anything on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't fry them is just bake the </v>

1449
01:04:38.421 --> 01:04:39.150
<v Speaker 1>potato and eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eat everything.</v>

1450
01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:44.180
<v Speaker 1>And you can have nine if you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain but you can't put any butter on </v>

1451
01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:44.180
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Salt,</v>

1452
01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:44.640
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just flat up potatoes.</v>

1453
01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:50.240
<v Speaker 1>So for me that sounded tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I just come off the heart attack so</v>

1454
01:04:51.781 --> 01:04:53.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather not die,</v>

1455
01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:57.510
<v Speaker 1>so I'll fucking try one potato two weeks</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight up.</v>

1456
01:04:57.511 --> 01:05:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Just potatoes and raw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Raw,</v>

1457
01:05:00.421 --> 01:05:05.421
<v Speaker 1>like uncooked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can bake them but you can't use </v>

1458
01:05:05.421 --> 01:05:07.761
<v Speaker 1>anything to cook and you can't wrap it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in tin foil with butter and salt or </v>

1459
01:05:07.761 --> 01:05:07.761
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>

1460
01:05:07.761 --> 01:05:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Just flat out playing the victim and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you must have been bored as fuck.</v>

1461
01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:12.810
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens to trigger the Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in my estimation,</v>

1462
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:14.730
<v Speaker 1>is that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1463
01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:20.720
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to eat as many potatoes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want and you think you like </v>

1464
01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:23.461
<v Speaker 1>potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was reading pens book or rather </v>

1465
01:05:23.461 --> 01:05:23.461
<v Speaker 1>listening to pence book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1466
01:05:23.461 --> 01:05:23.461
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do that.</v>

1467
01:05:23.461 --> 01:05:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Like I fucking dig potatoes and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize you don't like potatoes as much </v>

1468
01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:31.831
<v Speaker 1>as you like butter and salt and milk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that goes into like mashed </v>

1469
01:05:31.831 --> 01:05:33.550
<v Speaker 1>potatoes and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

1470
01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:37.960
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning there's a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>satiety because potatoes have some girth</v>

1471
01:05:37.961 --> 01:05:39.880
<v Speaker 1>to him and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're mostly water.</v>

1472
01:05:39.881 --> 01:05:44.881
<v Speaker 1>So it's an excellent diuretics or </v>
<v Speaker 1>pissing like a racehorse and that's </v>

1473
01:05:44.881 --> 01:05:47.680
<v Speaker 1>dropping weight like more water out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your bottom good vitamins in the skin as</v>

1474
01:05:47.681 --> 01:05:48.040
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1475
01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:50.110
<v Speaker 1>A lot of potassium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some people,</v>

1476
01:05:50.111 --> 01:05:51.390
<v Speaker 1>like when I was telling him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1477
01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:53.020
<v Speaker 1>the moment you tell people what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

1478
01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:58.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's got their fucking advice </v>

1479
01:05:58.050 --> 01:05:59.671
<v Speaker 1>about how to dye it and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I was talking about I'm doing </v>

1480
01:05:59.671 --> 01:05:59.671
<v Speaker 1>this potato diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can't eat potatoes,</v>

1481
01:05:59.671 --> 01:05:59.800
<v Speaker 1>carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1482
01:05:59.810 --> 01:06:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Don't fucking nuts too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bad and shit.</v>

1483
01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:04.360
<v Speaker 1>But in two weeks of eating nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>potatoes,</v>

1484

1486
01:06:08.801 --> 01:06:13.801
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time it taught me </v>

1487
01:06:13.801 --> 01:06:13.801
<v Speaker 1>something more important than like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1488
01:06:13.801 --> 01:06:16.450
<v Speaker 1>I hate potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It taught me to fast.</v>

1489
01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Like it taught me to like now I eat a </v>
<v Speaker 1>meal a day.</v>

1490
01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:21.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't eat in the morning when I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1491
01:06:21.041 --> 01:06:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't listen to the propaganda of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got eight of breakfast and shit like</v>

1492
01:06:24.191 --> 01:06:24.460

<v Speaker 1>My Body has enough stored energy.</v>

1494
01:06:27.491 --> 01:06:32.491
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to fucking eat eggs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>orange juice in order to fucking feel </v>

1495
01:06:32.491 --> 01:06:35.910
<v Speaker 1>good in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have to wait for my body to be </v>

1496
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:35.910
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing's coming in great.</v>

01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:37.210
<v Speaker 1>We'll hook over to the fucking stored </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy and shit like that.</v>

1498
01:06:37.211 --> 01:06:39.550
<v Speaker 1>And I got a lot of like intermittent </v>
<v Speaker 1>fasting.</v>

1499
01:06:39.551 --> 01:06:41.740
<v Speaker 1>So what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so much intermittent.</v>

1500
01:06:41.741 --> 01:06:46.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like I eat once a day and then some</v>
<v Speaker 1>days if I'm like feeling needy,</v>

1501
01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:48.620
<v Speaker 1>like you go through it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit a wall every once in a while.</v>

<v Speaker 1>minutes it's going to pass.</v>

1505
01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.330
<v Speaker 1>And then 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1506

<v Speaker 1>typically dinner generally about 3:00</v>

1509
01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:11.560
<v Speaker 1>in the afternoon and then you go a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time before you eat again.</v>

<v Speaker 1>A lot of people think that's the way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat it.</v>

1512
01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:18.610
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smarter people than I like gray.</v>

1513
01:07:18.611 --> 01:07:23.611
<v Speaker 1>Who created the just sides?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diet and penn who followed the Diet and </v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to.</v>

1517
01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:30.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's down to one meal a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

1518
01:07:30.731 --> 01:07:35.731
<v Speaker 1>I think he just eats better than I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was able to keep up with res </v>

1519
01:07:35.731 --> 01:07:35.731
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't.</v>

1520
01:07:35.731 --> 01:07:37.870
<v Speaker 1>After the two weeks it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1521
01:07:37.871 --> 01:07:40.630
<v Speaker 1>now we corn and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never eaten corn in my life.</v>

1522
01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's telling you just eat corn?</v>

1523
01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:48.120
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was saying to add corn to the Diet </v>

1524
01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:48.120
<v Speaker 1>and they were adding more things after </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first two weeks.</v>

1525
01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:48.820
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now just corn.</v>

1526
01:07:49.170 --> 01:07:54.170
<v Speaker 1>This just sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his hook is that you're eating </v>

1527
01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:54.170
<v Speaker 1>the size essentially or eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1528
01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:57.400
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of just all plant based and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and so I couldn't.</v>

1529
01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:01.420
<v Speaker 1>I was hoping that I could fucking go the</v>
<v Speaker 1>distance and be a vegetable.</v>

1530
01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:06.600
<v Speaker 1>I fucking hate vegetables and so I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out a way to be v eight </v>

1531
01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:11.580
<v Speaker 1>vegetated so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could you be a Vegan and hate </v>

1532
01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:14.371
<v Speaker 1>vegetables?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You find a very thin corridor in which </v>

1533
01:08:14.371 --> 01:08:18.560
<v Speaker 1>you know to live and exist scooping up </v>
<v Speaker 1>that tow food pretty much eating pinto </v>

1534
01:08:19.911 --> 01:08:21.650
<v Speaker 1>beans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating black beans,</v>

1535
01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.430
<v Speaker 1>good source of carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1536
01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:24.890
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1537
01:08:24.891 --> 01:08:28.450
<v Speaker 1>what I've fallen in love with and never </v>
<v Speaker 1>ate before in my life or chickpeas.</v>

1538
01:08:28.730 --> 01:08:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Chickpeas are great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such a great goto snack,</v>

1539
01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:35.630
<v Speaker 1>fucking full of protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in Vegan comfort food cooking.</v>

1540
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:39.170
<v Speaker 1>They use it as a versatile ingredient.</v>

1541
01:08:39.170 --> 01:08:42.560
<v Speaker 1>So like if you go to one of my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurants in town is crossroads.</v>

1542
01:08:42.561 --> 01:08:43.850
<v Speaker 1>They've got like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1544
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it is.</v>

1545
01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:50.480
<v Speaker 1>I believe Travis Barker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drummer,</v>

1546
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:52.910
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's his place.</v>

1547
01:08:52.911 --> 01:08:57.911
<v Speaker 1>I believe so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure they got a meatball sub </v>

1548
01:08:57.911 --> 01:08:57.911
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1549
01:08:57.911 --> 01:08:58.220
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd suck a dick for it.</v>

1550
01:08:58.221 --> 01:09:00.980
<v Speaker 1>So fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Immersively that don't make you do that.</v>

1551
01:09:00.981 --> 01:09:02.780
<v Speaker 1>They just make you pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very sweet of them.</v>

1552
01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:04.280
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is good business model.</v>

1553
01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:07.560
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be a very good place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is one of the fantastic.</v>

1554
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:12.590
<v Speaker 1>There's meatball subs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Travis Travis's place tastes exactly </v>

1555
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:14.060
<v Speaker 1>like five miles from here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a little bit more called.</v>

1556
01:09:14.061 --> 01:09:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Follow your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever been in that place?</v>

1557
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

1558
01:09:16.671 --> 01:09:21.060
<v Speaker 1>That's why I met Ray to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Diet first.</v>

1559
01:09:21.150 --> 01:09:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Some killer fucking pancakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1560
01:09:23.031 --> 01:09:23.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they're dealing with.</v>

1561
01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Kind of Voodoo they're doing to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegan pancake.</v>

1562
01:09:26.421 --> 01:09:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Takes that good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In New York,</v>

1563
01:09:27.921 --> 01:09:30.050
<v Speaker 1>they got a place in Brooklyn called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Champ's diner,</v>

1564
01:09:30.051 --> 01:09:32.900
<v Speaker 1>which is also like all plant based Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

1565
01:09:32.901 --> 01:09:37.901
<v Speaker 1>but they do comfort food like you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can get a like an impossible </v>

1566
01:09:37.901 --> 01:09:42.041
<v Speaker 1>burger or beyond that or like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating meat balls and you think about </v>

1567
01:09:42.041 --> 01:09:42.041
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1568
01:09:42.041 --> 01:09:42.820
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bread is most of it.</v>

1569
01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:48.340
<v Speaker 1>The sauces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next biggest part and meat balls </v>

1570
01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:48.610
<v Speaker 1>themselves aren't really that packed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>

1571
01:09:48.650 --> 01:09:50.690
<v Speaker 1>It's much more breading than fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat and stuff.</v>

1572
01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:53.730
<v Speaker 1>So I have to do is find something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll stand in for the fucking meet,</v>

1573
01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:59.080
<v Speaker 1>drench it in fucking Marinara sauce and </v>
<v Speaker 1>put it in between a nice soft roll and </v>

1574
01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.750
<v Speaker 1>they use like ricotta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a cashew ricotta,</v>

1575
01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:04.820
<v Speaker 1>like kind of finished it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is fucking bliss dude.</v>

1576
01:10:04.821 --> 01:10:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>

1577
01:10:05.961 --> 01:10:08.360
<v Speaker 1>it's Vegan comfort food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can't do that every day.</v>

1578
01:10:08.530 --> 01:10:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's nice to know that if you're </v>

1579
01:10:13.530 --> 01:10:13.530
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1580
01:10:13.530 --> 01:10:14.720
<v Speaker 1>I've missed real fucking food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to eat a goddamn animal,</v>

1581
01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:17.750
<v Speaker 1>they can hand you something that's close</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the approximate.</v>

1582
01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Now the good news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know a lot of people like fuck</v>

1583
01:10:20.181 --> 01:10:23.090
<v Speaker 1>veganism and you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no damn fun for me at least.</v>

1584
01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:27.150
<v Speaker 1>But after a month of plant based,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1585
01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:32.160
<v Speaker 1>I was on a series of medications after </v>
<v Speaker 1>the heart attack and stolen and it was </v>

1586
01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:35.861
<v Speaker 1>on a full dose of Lipitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a cholesterol fucking cutter </v>

1587
01:10:35.861 --> 01:10:36.800
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my doctor,</v>

1588
01:10:36.801 --> 01:10:38.630
<v Speaker 1>I was telling him about this potato diet</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>

1589
01:10:38.631 --> 01:10:43.631
<v Speaker 1>I don't trust this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's gone on to do so I want to do your </v>

1590
01:10:43.631 --> 01:10:43.631
<v Speaker 1>meds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me some of your blood.</v>

1591
01:10:43.631 --> 01:10:43.631
<v Speaker 1>So he takes my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1592
01:10:43.631 --> 01:10:44.600
<v Speaker 1>I gotta make sure you're getting all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrition.</v>

1593
01:10:44.601 --> 01:10:49.601
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get it all from a fucking </v>

1594
01:10:49.601 --> 01:10:49.601
<v Speaker 1>potato.</v>

1595
01:10:49.601 --> 01:10:51.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he did my labs and came back and he </v>

1596
01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:51.400
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fantastic.</v>

1597
01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:53.060
<v Speaker 1>He's going nutrients wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're great.</v>

1598
01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:58.120
<v Speaker 1>Everything is crossed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The board is great except for </v>

1599
01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:58.120
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1600
01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:58.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did just have a heart attack,</v>

1601
01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:58.120
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1602
01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:58.910
<v Speaker 1>your cholesterol is in the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's gone,</v>

1603
01:10:58.911 --> 01:11:00.860
<v Speaker 1>so I need you to break your lipitor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>

1604
01:11:00.861 --> 01:11:05.861
<v Speaker 1>He's going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't take that much liberatory </v>

1605
01:11:05.861 --> 01:11:05.861
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's like,</v>

1606
01:11:05.861 --> 01:11:05.861
<v Speaker 1>what have you done different?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1607
01:11:05.861 --> 01:11:10.001
<v Speaker 1>I'm just eating fucking potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cholesterol drops so radically that he </v>

1608
01:11:10.001 --> 01:11:10.001
<v Speaker 1>was worried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1609
01:11:10.001 --> 01:11:13.800
<v Speaker 1>and enough to take me off of my half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half my prescription when is.</v>

1610
01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:17.130
<v Speaker 1>See I don't understand enough about </v>
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol levels.</v>

1611
01:11:17.131 --> 01:11:20.040
<v Speaker 1>This is what they told me recently that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I found fascinating.</v>

1612
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:21.720
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is liberatory.</v>

1613
01:11:21.721 --> 01:11:23.100
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eat up the cholesterol.</v>

1614
01:11:23.101 --> 01:11:23.520
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1615
01:11:23.521 --> 01:11:24.600
<v Speaker 1>it's in your system forever.</v>

1616
01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:25.620
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

1617
01:11:25.621 --> 01:11:26.130
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1618
01:11:26.131 --> 01:11:29.250
<v Speaker 1>I can loosen it up and move it about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then we have to be careful.</v>

1619
01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Make sure it's loose and soft and </v>
<v Speaker 1>globule cholesterol.</v>

1620
01:11:31.951 --> 01:11:36.951
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't go into your fucking brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus if hard pieces like you know,</v>

1621
01:11:37.021 --> 01:11:40.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you ever put like </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking grid off your teeth after you've</v>

1622
01:11:40.861 --> 01:11:42.870
<v Speaker 1>eaten or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come back to the,</v>

1623
01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:45.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's plaque technically I guess,</v>

1624
01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:47.970
<v Speaker 1>but that's kind of shit that's up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your veins,</v>

1625
01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:50.520
<v Speaker 1>but in that shit gets hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets super hard.</v>

1626
01:11:50.521 --> 01:11:55.521
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cholesterol that was blocking up my </v>

1627
01:11:55.521 --> 01:11:58.071
<v Speaker 1>lad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my man had to drill through it to get </v>

1628
01:11:58.071 --> 01:11:58.830
<v Speaker 1>the stent in there and you keep that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol forever.</v>

1629
01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:03.860
<v Speaker 1>Now I can't say that a hundred percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the way it was communicated </v>

1630
01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:06.891
<v Speaker 1>to me because I thought I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this magic drug will eat up the </v>

1631
01:12:06.891 --> 01:12:06.891
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol.</v>

1632
01:12:06.891 --> 01:12:06.891
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1633
01:12:06.891 --> 01:12:10.191
<v Speaker 1>we have to be very careful with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol because it moves throughout </v>

1634
01:12:10.191 --> 01:12:10.920
<v Speaker 1>your system chief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess maybe eventually it moves out</v>

1635
01:12:10.921 --> 01:12:13.260
<v Speaker 1>of your system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's in your blood system,</v>

1636
01:12:13.261 --> 01:12:18.261
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a chance that it goes up near </v>

1637
01:12:18.261 --> 01:12:20.271
<v Speaker 1>your brain eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's what they're trying to </v>

1638
01:12:20.271 --> 01:12:22.641
<v Speaker 1>keep all idiots talking about medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that right now you can't be an </v>

1639
01:12:22.981 --> 01:12:27.981
<v Speaker 1>expert on everything Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you have to take shots in the </v>

1640
01:12:27.981 --> 01:12:27.981
<v Speaker 1>dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1641
01:12:27.981 --> 01:12:28.330
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1642
01:12:28.450 --> 01:12:29.490
<v Speaker 1>we know your audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1643
01:12:29.491 --> 01:12:31.080
<v Speaker 1>the audience is sitting there right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>going like,</v>

1644
01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:34.920
<v Speaker 1>this irritates me if they're not going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to speak truth and hard facts.</v>

1645
01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Understand science.</v>

1646
01:12:37.111 --> 01:12:38.100
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't.</v>

1647
01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:40.710
<v Speaker 1>That's why we went in to entertain them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you are,</v>

1648
01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:45.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting a full blood panel done </v>

1649
01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:45.820
<v Speaker 1>and all these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're checking all your.</v>

1650
01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I've also become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1651
01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:51.840
<v Speaker 1>and I'd be the guy that does algae and </v>
<v Speaker 1>algae,</v>

1652
01:12:51.841 --> 01:12:56.040
<v Speaker 1>but are pills that this a re turned me </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto this doctor.</v>

1653
01:12:56.041 --> 01:12:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I bet you know his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his name escapes me.</v>

1654
01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Who formulated this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1655
01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:03.630
<v Speaker 1>these are the nutrients you need a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guarantee.</v>

1656
01:13:03.631 --> 01:13:05.670
<v Speaker 1>You've probably talked to this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name escapes me,</v>

1657
01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.650
<v Speaker 1>but ray was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get these supplements.</v>

1658
01:13:07.651 --> 01:13:12.651
<v Speaker 1>They'll cover everything is gone because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're no longer immediate or anything </v>

1659
01:13:12.651 --> 01:13:13.140
<v Speaker 1>you need that would come out and meet </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes out of this.</v>

1660
01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.070
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1661
01:13:14.071 --> 01:13:15.870
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of explained to me when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

1662
01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:16.650
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1663
01:13:16.651 --> 01:13:18.450
<v Speaker 1>like my kid was going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do it,</v>

1664
01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:20.760
<v Speaker 1>Kiddo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we were raised differently.</v>

1665
01:13:20.761 --> 01:13:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>granted I didn't,</v>

1666
01:13:22.561 --> 01:13:24.690
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't raised with flaming neon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did eat steak,</v>

1667
01:13:24.691 --> 01:13:26.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm through most of my childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's kind of a meat,</v>

1668
01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:31.970
<v Speaker 1>like it's tough to separate from </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you've lived with for so </v>

1669
01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:31.970
<v Speaker 1>fucking long.</v>

1670
01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:33.180
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gave up cigarettes.</v>

1671
01:13:33.181 --> 01:13:34.150
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh all right,</v>

1672
01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:34.980
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And stuff.</v>

1673
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:40.430
<v Speaker 1>So it's nice to be able to go to places </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can eat food that's not just </v>

1674
01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:43.590
<v Speaker 1>like grass and roots and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you eliminate?</v>

1675
01:13:43.591 --> 01:13:45.800
<v Speaker 1>This is what I'm going to concentrate on</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>

1676
01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:48.030
<v Speaker 1>she's dairy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all dairy,</v>

1677
01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:48.960
<v Speaker 1>cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>milk.</v>

1678
01:13:49.230 --> 01:13:51.840
<v Speaker 1>I was drinking no bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A two gallons of milk a day.</v>

1679
01:13:51.841 --> 01:13:56.841
<v Speaker 1>So that might've been part of the reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wound up having a fucking heart </v>

1680
01:13:56.841 --> 01:13:56.841
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So milk went away,</v>

1681
01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:59.070
<v Speaker 1>cheese went away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1682
01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:01.650
<v Speaker 1>animal food products one away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no burgers.</v>

1683
01:14:01.651 --> 01:14:03.960
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't a big burger guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did like burgers.</v>

1684
01:14:03.961 --> 01:14:06.720
<v Speaker 1>What about bread?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pasta,</v>

1685
01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pasta.</v>

1686
01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Pasta can be Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it shouldn't,</v>

1687
01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:12.330
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't overdo it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1688
01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Can't eat up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucked on a bread and stuff.</v>

1689
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:15.110
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't know.</v>

1690
01:14:15.230 --> 01:14:18.810
<v Speaker 1>So shit just and honestly they prefer </v>
<v Speaker 1>went away,</v>

1691
01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:21.190
<v Speaker 1>like most doctors aren't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

1692
01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:22.900
<v Speaker 1>eat all the bread you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1693
01:14:22.901 --> 01:14:24.860
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's as part of weightwatchers,</v>

1694
01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:29.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a value to it that you can eat </v>

1695
01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.731
<v Speaker 1>bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it takes up like a quarter of the </v>

1696
01:14:32.731 --> 01:14:33.340
<v Speaker 1>point you can go to weightwatchers as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegan.</v>

1697
01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Was it tricky?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1698
01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight watchers so fucking simple </v>

1699
01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:39.960
<v Speaker 1>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the APP,</v>

1700
01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:42.280
<v Speaker 1>it's all APP based now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was part of it when I was a kid,</v>

1701
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:44.960
<v Speaker 1>like at age 14 I was part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weightwatchers,</v>

1702
01:14:45.450 --> 01:14:50.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like the lone male in the </v>

1703
01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:52.321
<v Speaker 1>group and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's so technologically based that </v>

1704
01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:53.410
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a food store and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1705
01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:55.420
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want those.</v>

1706
01:14:55.421 --> 01:15:00.421
<v Speaker 1>But I wonder how many points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just scan the Barcode and it tells </v>

1707
01:15:00.421 --> 01:15:04.741
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can enter things like pinto </v>

1708
01:15:04.741 --> 01:15:04.741
<v Speaker 1>beans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

1709
01:15:04.741 --> 01:15:05.910
<v Speaker 1>It tells you there's zero points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anything you entered,</v>

1710
01:15:05.911 --> 01:15:08.470
<v Speaker 1>they generally have a value for even </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast food chains.</v>

1711
01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:11.590
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's shockingly easy to use.</v>

1712
01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Take weightwatchers out of the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Being Vegan difficult?</v>

1713
01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I watched my kid go through it </v>

1714
01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:21.660
<v Speaker 1>where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no choices,</v>

1715
01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:23.500
<v Speaker 1>you're really limited to the places you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can go in life and go out to eat,</v>

1716
01:15:24.130 --> 01:15:29.130
<v Speaker 1>but if it's a choice between wine and up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the fucking emergency room again and </v>

1717
01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:30.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating whatever I want to eat,</v>

1718
01:15:30.701 --> 01:15:34.360
<v Speaker 1>which is what I did for 47 years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then wound up nearly fucking dying.</v>

1719
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:38.290
<v Speaker 1>Closes diver came to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay to go plant based for,</v>

1720
01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:43.360
<v Speaker 1>for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I told the kid I'm doing it for at </v>

1721
01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:43.360
<v Speaker 1>least a year and if I can live like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1722
01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:43.360
<v Speaker 1>I'll keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1723
01:15:43.450 --> 01:15:48.450
<v Speaker 1>So you cut out a milk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheese animal products and all your </v>

1724
01:15:49.751 --> 01:15:49.950
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>

1725
01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:50.860
<v Speaker 1>Sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar.</v>

1726
01:15:50.861 --> 01:15:54.550
<v Speaker 1>I cut out prior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prior to this now when I first met you,</v>

1727
01:15:54.551 --> 01:15:58.120
<v Speaker 1>you were a candy junkie and it look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still a candy junky at heart.</v>

1728
01:15:58.121 --> 01:16:01.290
<v Speaker 1>I just can't buy anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll always be a candy junkie.</v>

1729
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:03.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm a dry drunk right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

1730
01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:05.650
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't eat all the candy if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>presented it,</v>

1731
01:16:05.651 --> 01:16:10.651
<v Speaker 1>but it was mostly the dairy and the meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I had to say goodbye to cut out.</v>

1732
01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was the most.</v>

1733
01:16:12.970 --> 01:16:15.370
<v Speaker 1>The biggest percentage of your diet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably,</v>

1734
01:16:15.371 --> 01:16:15.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1735
01:16:15.850 --> 01:16:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Especially dairy now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about exercise exercise?</v>

1736
01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:24.240
<v Speaker 1>After the heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want you to do shit for like </v>

1737
01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.161
<v Speaker 1>the first month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the only three months ago </v>

1738
01:16:26.161 --> 01:16:26.830
<v Speaker 1>that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once the doctor gave me the a okay,</v>

1739
01:16:26.831 --> 01:16:29.020
<v Speaker 1>then I was back to walking the dog up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hill of the way.</v>

1740
01:16:29.021 --> 01:16:29.510
<v Speaker 1>I always did.</v>

1741
01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't gone harder than that and I </v>

1742
01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:38.520
<v Speaker 1>don't honestly like I'm so fucking lazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>at heart that I.</v>

1743
01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:43.520
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people like I love getting out </v>

1744
01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:43.520
<v Speaker 1>there and fucking helps me think and my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not me.</v>

1745
01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.340
<v Speaker 1>I can fucking think just fine at home </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking a joint,</v>

1746
01:16:45.550 --> 01:16:47.590
<v Speaker 1>sitting there fucking watching Kobe or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1747
01:16:47.591 --> 01:16:49.010
<v Speaker 1>That's what you and I separate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1748
01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:50.770
<v Speaker 1>You liked the physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

1749
01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:51.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1750
01:16:51.551 --> 01:16:52.720
<v Speaker 1>you like the rush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1751
01:16:52.730 --> 01:16:57.250
<v Speaker 1>you're like the adrenaline junkies who </v>
<v Speaker 1>have kind of late raise their level.</v>

1752
01:16:57.430 --> 01:17:00.610
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not enough for you to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit in one place,</v>

1753
01:17:00.611 --> 01:17:03.100
<v Speaker 1>like you can do this and shocking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll do it for three hours.</v>

1754
01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:05.320
<v Speaker 1>But then after this you probably do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like Raza,</v>

1755
01:17:05.321 --> 01:17:08.670
<v Speaker 1>bare fucking knife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunt of species,</v>

1756
01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:10.090
<v Speaker 1>run</v>

1757
01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:12.350
<v Speaker 3>the hills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you did at run hills in the</v>

1758
01:17:12.351 --> 01:17:17.351
<v Speaker 3>morning?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how far a couple miles at the </v>

1759
01:17:17.351 --> 01:17:18.470
<v Speaker 3>most I do because I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's real steep stuff.</v>

1760
01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.330
<v Speaker 3>Do you listen to anything or are you </v>
<v Speaker 3>today?</v>

1761
01:17:20.331 --> 01:17:23.240
<v Speaker 3>I did two that cheated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I cheat when I listen to things.</v>

1762
01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:28.540
<v Speaker 3>I think it's cheating was supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>alone with your Bosch supposed to be in </v>

1763
01:17:28.540 --> 01:17:32.561
<v Speaker 3>a meditative state where you're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>pushing yourself at a certain pace and </v>

1764
01:17:32.561 --> 01:17:32.930
<v Speaker 3>when you're listening to something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially something cool,</v>

1765
01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:36.020
<v Speaker 3>a distraction to the point where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>hear how heavier breathing,</v>

1766
01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:41.200
<v Speaker 3>but you don't think negatively about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you thinking about whatever the </v>

1767
01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:41.920
<v Speaker 3>music you're listening to is like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting because it's.</v>

1768
01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:46.580
<v Speaker 3>It's a nice trick because you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually work harder and not be bothered</v>

1769
01:17:46.581 --> 01:17:51.581
<v Speaker 3>by it because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're so tuned into the music that you </v>

1770
01:17:51.581 --> 01:17:54.491
<v Speaker 3>listened into or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're really captivated with that you </v>

1771
01:17:54.491 --> 01:17:58.271
<v Speaker 3>can keep pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most of the time I like to do it </v>

1772
01:17:58.271 --> 01:18:00.290
<v Speaker 3>where I don't hear shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just hear the pounding in my footsteps</v>

1773
01:18:00.291 --> 01:18:05.291
<v Speaker 3>and my breathing and also I have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>logical fear of mountain lions so I </v>

1774
01:18:05.291 --> 01:18:05.291
<v Speaker 3>don't want to.</v>

1775
01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that story about the fucker </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of Seattle?</v>

1776
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Scared the fuck out of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was terrifying.</v>

1777
01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:12.140
<v Speaker 1>And those spots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't like.</v>

1778
01:18:12.141 --> 01:18:13.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't gone.</v>

1779
01:18:13.071 --> 01:18:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Do you know we did the right thing?</v>

1781

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like one trail where they have a sign </v>

<v Speaker 1>those little graphic tutorials on what </v>

1786

<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously I'm just reading the </v>

1804
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:21.000
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't there,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Your deliberate,</v>

1806
01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:27.480
<v Speaker 3>the guy who survived,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said that he felt the mountain lions </v>

1807
01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:30.270
<v Speaker 3>fucking jaws around his head and then to</v>

<v Speaker 3>pound cat and it was a macerated and it </v>

1811
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:45.280
<v Speaker 3>wasn't doing well.</v>

1812
01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:49.360
<v Speaker 3>It was probably an old Kathy Ferrell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all pharaoh.</v>

1813
01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:50.200

<v Speaker 3>all fearful motherfucker there.</v>

1818
01:19:59.130 --> 01:20:03.690

<v Speaker 3>anymore and shit couldn't catch dear.</v>

1819
01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:08.720

01:20:11.130 --> 01:20:15.270
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fastest human is a joke to a cat,</v>

1824
01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:18.600
<v Speaker 3>but it dear deers are so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He received dear.</v>

1825
01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:21.000
<v Speaker 3>Try to run away from a wolf or something</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that in the video.</v>

1826
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:22.980
<v Speaker 3>Not a wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen deers runaway from us.</v>

1827
01:20:22.981 --> 01:20:27.981
<v Speaker 3>They were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were all around our house and </v>

1828
01:20:27.981 --> 01:20:27.981
<v Speaker 3>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1829
01:20:27.981 --> 01:20:29.130
<v Speaker 3>you can't even come close to catch them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A cat could catch a person so quick,</v>

1830
01:20:29.131 --> 01:20:29.760
<v Speaker 3>but even if.</v>

1831
01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:30.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1832
01:20:30.181 --> 01:20:35.181
<v Speaker 3>so it's a 100 pound cat is still going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be smaller than the dude that it's </v>

1833
01:20:35.181 --> 01:20:35.490
<v Speaker 3>attacking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever get into fight with a house</v>

1834
01:20:35.491 --> 01:20:36.270
<v Speaker 3>cat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>

1835
01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:37.640
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never gotten a fight with the house</v>

1836
01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:39.240
<v Speaker 3>to all animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am as well,</v>

1837
01:20:39.241 --> 01:20:42.000
<v Speaker 3>but I had a feral cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I raised him.</v>

1838
01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:43.410
<v Speaker 3>They're all fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Farrah Joe?</v>

1839
01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:43.920
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not.</v>

1840
01:20:43.921 --> 01:20:48.921
<v Speaker 3>All this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a cat that was actually born in </v>

1841
01:20:48.921 --> 01:20:48.921
<v Speaker 3>the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1842
01:20:48.921 --> 01:20:51.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was born in the wild and I had a stay</v>

1843
01:20:51.481 --> 01:20:56.160
<v Speaker 3>with him in a room to get myself used to</v>
<v Speaker 3>him and get him used to me.</v>

1844
01:20:56.161 --> 01:20:57.660
<v Speaker 3>This is pre internet too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

1845
01:20:57.910 --> 01:21:02.910
<v Speaker 3>So this is like in the nineties and so I</v>
<v Speaker 3>locked myself in a bedroom with this </v>

1846
01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:04.830
<v Speaker 3>kitten and just brought a stack of </v>
<v Speaker 3>books.</v>

1847
01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:07.080
<v Speaker 3>I put a mattress in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brought a stack of books,</v>

1848
01:21:07.081 --> 01:21:12.081
<v Speaker 3>just hung out with this cat and every </v>
<v Speaker 3>time I'd get near this cat cat would </v>

1849
01:21:12.081 --> 01:21:15.561
<v Speaker 3>freak out and hissed at me and jump on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the curtains and fucking literally like </v>

1850
01:21:15.561 --> 01:21:16.920
<v Speaker 3>climb the blinds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming and hissing,</v>

1851
01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:19.070
<v Speaker 3>and then I finally would get my hands on</v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

1852
01:21:19.090 --> 01:21:24.090
<v Speaker 3>He would immediately start purring and </v>
<v Speaker 3>given in because once you realize it </v>

1853
01:21:24.090 --> 01:21:24.090
<v Speaker 3>wasn't trying to eat him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I was his friend,</v>

1854
01:21:24.090 --> 01:21:26.760
<v Speaker 3>I would pat him and he would put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed an Auntie Kat would pro.</v>

1855
01:21:26.761 --> 01:21:31.761
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I developed this bizarre bond with </v>

1856
01:21:31.761 --> 01:21:33.510
<v Speaker 3>this cat because the cat was so scared </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the world.</v>

1857
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:36.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was that scared of every </v>
<v Speaker 3>action every time.</v>

1858
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:39.630
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And eventually calmed down and be like,</v>

1859
01:21:39.670 --> 01:21:44.670
<v Speaker 3>was the only one that could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that could touch them though I was the </v>

1860
01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:44.670
<v Speaker 3>only person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my friends would come over.</v>

1861
01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:45.930
<v Speaker 3>He'd hiss at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would like,</v>

1862
01:21:45.931 --> 01:21:47.200
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1863
01:21:47.201 --> 01:21:50.580
<v Speaker 3>like let them know like bitch shit is </v>
<v Speaker 3>about to get really crazy.</v>

1864
01:21:50.730 --> 01:21:54.030
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm not a regular cat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I could go up to him and I could pet</v>

1865
01:21:54.031 --> 01:21:55.230
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a feral cat,</v>

1866
01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:58.140
<v Speaker 3>you know what was my point?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beginning this.</v>

1867
01:21:58.350 --> 01:22:00.740
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did we were.</v>

1868
01:22:01.610 --> 01:22:04.050
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to get them fixed.</v>

1869
01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:05.230
<v Speaker 3>This is what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cat.</v>

1870
01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:07.060
<v Speaker 3>I had to get them fixed and I had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pick them up,</v>

1871
01:22:07.061 --> 01:22:10.140
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know how the fuck he knew </v>
<v Speaker 3>that something was going on.</v>

1872
01:22:10.170 --> 01:22:10.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

1873
01:22:10.801 --> 01:22:12.600
<v Speaker 3>Because I was trying to get them in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>laundry basket.</v>

1874
01:22:12.990 --> 01:22:17.990
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to put them in the laundry </v>
<v Speaker 3>basket because I wanted to bring him to </v>

1875
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:20.690
<v Speaker 3>the doctors who tried who he trusts </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes at him with a fucking cake.</v>

1876
01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:25.720
<v Speaker 3>Not that deep into a relationship either</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's the only like 10 or 11 </v>

1877
01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:26.580
<v Speaker 3>months old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He ran in my house,</v>

1878
01:22:26.581 --> 01:22:31.581
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's lifted his tail up and just </v>

1879
01:22:31.581 --> 01:22:31.581
<v Speaker 3>shooting piss on my walls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1880
01:22:31.581 --> 01:22:32.850
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fuck dude.</v>

1881
01:22:32.851 --> 01:22:37.440
<v Speaker 3>He pissed all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the time I realized like I had to get</v>

1882
01:22:37.441 --> 01:22:38.990
<v Speaker 3>him to a doctor.</v>

1883
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:43.990
<v Speaker 3>You'd Piss to my house like 10 times </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they just piss in the house and </v>

1884
01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:44.160
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I was worried like if you don't</v>

1885
01:22:44.161 --> 01:22:47.320
<v Speaker 3>get them quick enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I've yet to clean everything up,</v>

1886
01:22:47.321 --> 01:22:52.321
<v Speaker 3>but deep clean all the carpets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you don't get to him quick </v>

1887
01:22:52.321 --> 01:22:52.321
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just thinks,</v>

1888
01:22:52.321 --> 01:22:54.690
<v Speaker 3>well he's spraying from now on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even after you fix them that that can be</v>

1889
01:22:54.691 --> 01:22:59.691
<v Speaker 3>a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I tried to hold onto him and put him </v>

1890
01:22:59.691 --> 01:23:02.040
<v Speaker 3>in this laundry basket and he taught me </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck up.</v>

1891
01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:07.220
<v Speaker 3>He tore my arms up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just scratched and me and he was </v>

1892
01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:09.720
<v Speaker 3>remarkably strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is a little cat.</v>

1893
01:23:09.730 --> 01:23:13.090
<v Speaker 3>And this was your friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he was saying the same to me.</v>

1894
01:23:13.091 --> 01:23:15.040
<v Speaker 3>I thought you were my friend bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to stop.</v>

1895
01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:20.470
<v Speaker 3>I know what you fucking prick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I had a blanket on him.</v>

1896
01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:22.720
<v Speaker 3>He was hissing at me and trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the room.</v>

1897
01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:25.090
<v Speaker 3>I had to throw a blanket at m and under </v>
<v Speaker 3>the blanket.</v>

1898
01:23:25.091 --> 01:23:27.730
<v Speaker 3>I scooped him up and I put them in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>laundry basket.</v>

1899
01:23:27.850 --> 01:23:32.200
<v Speaker 3>And then I slowly pulled the blanket out</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he didn't suffocate while keeping the</v>

1900
01:23:32.201 --> 01:23:33.910
<v Speaker 3>lid down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then tape the,</v>

1901
01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:36.070
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the laundry basket up.</v>

1902
01:23:36.130 --> 01:23:41.130
<v Speaker 3>So I can put it in my car and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't jump out in my car and call my </v>

1903
01:23:41.130 --> 01:23:43.180
<v Speaker 3>fucking face off while I'm trying to see</v>
<v Speaker 3>it in a Chevy chase movie.</v>

1904
01:23:43.210 --> 01:23:45.760
<v Speaker 3>Did you leave it at the vet and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>walk away the.</v>

1905
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:49.630
<v Speaker 3>That was a good friend of mine who has </v>
<v Speaker 3>since passed on and it was a.</v>

1906
01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:52.720
<v Speaker 3>He was a really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He that guy,</v>

1907
01:23:52.721 --> 01:23:55.100
<v Speaker 3>loved animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eat the cat whisperer.</v>

1908
01:23:55.230 --> 01:23:57.610
<v Speaker 3>He know he knew how to take care of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knew.</v>

1909
01:23:57.611 --> 01:24:00.340
<v Speaker 3>I told him the whole deal coming in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1910
01:24:00.341 --> 01:24:01.900
<v Speaker 3>he knew he knew how to handle it.</v>

1911
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:03.950
<v Speaker 3>He's the only vet I've ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1912
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.830
<v Speaker 3>cry with me over what animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a puppy that had distemper.</v>

1913
01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:13.000
<v Speaker 3>A friend of mine found these puppies at </v>
<v Speaker 3>a gas station.</v>

1914
01:24:13.001 --> 01:24:16.390
<v Speaker 3>Someone was given them away and he took </v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of them and he calls me up,</v>

1915
01:24:16.450 --> 01:24:16.900
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

1916
01:24:16.901 --> 01:24:18.470
<v Speaker 3>you want a puppy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were at the gas stations.</v>

1917
01:24:18.471 --> 01:24:19.360
<v Speaker 3>Said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah man,</v>

1918
01:24:19.361 --> 01:24:22.420
<v Speaker 3>bring that puppy over here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1919
01:24:22.421 --> 01:24:27.421
<v Speaker 3>The puppy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just after like a couple of days of </v>

1920
01:24:27.421 --> 01:24:30.271
<v Speaker 3>being at the house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd have these seizures like violent </v>

1921
01:24:30.271 --> 01:24:32.971
<v Speaker 3>seizures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just lie down and eyes would roll </v>

1922
01:24:32.971 --> 01:24:33.120
<v Speaker 3>back and you can just pet it a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

1923
01:24:33.130 --> 01:24:38.130
<v Speaker 3>It would slowly come back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it would be weak and delirious and </v>

1924
01:24:38.130 --> 01:24:41.041
<v Speaker 3>it would know it would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then towards the end it was having </v>

1925
01:24:41.041 --> 01:24:42.340
<v Speaker 3>them all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was just all day long.</v>

1926
01:24:42.370 --> 01:24:44.680
<v Speaker 3>And that's distemper distemper.</v>

1927
01:24:45.130 --> 01:24:46.630
<v Speaker 3>So how does it manifest it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1928
01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:52.040
<v Speaker 3>it's just some horrible neurological </v>
<v Speaker 3>disease that dogs get and if they don't </v>

1929
01:24:52.541 --> 01:24:56.080
<v Speaker 3>get the right shots when they're young </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can get this and there's a bunch of</v>

1930
01:24:56.081 --> 01:24:58.240
<v Speaker 3>different horrible reactions and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>fatal.</v>

1931
01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:01.600
<v Speaker 3>So I had to take him to the vet and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>vet was like,</v>

1932
01:25:01.601 --> 01:25:02.800
<v Speaker 3>there's really nothing we could do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1933
01:25:02.801 --> 01:25:05.110
<v Speaker 3>He's having seat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was having seizures all night,</v>

1934
01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:06.910
<v Speaker 3>all night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was awful.</v>

1935
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:09.530
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to die any,</v>

1936
01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:11.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any hour now,</v>

1937
01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:12.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have to put him down.</v>

1938
01:25:12.731 --> 01:25:16.480
<v Speaker 3>So he puts them down and he comes out in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hallway.</v>

1939
01:25:16.481 --> 01:25:16.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1940
01:25:16.831 --> 01:25:19.090
<v Speaker 3>I held the dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I placed him down,</v>

1941
01:25:19.091 --> 01:25:20.680
<v Speaker 3>I gave him a kiss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said goodbye,</v>

1942
01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:25.570
<v Speaker 3>and he put the needle in the dog and put</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dog to sleep.</v>

1943
01:25:25.571 --> 01:25:26.880
<v Speaker 3>Then we both went outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

1944
01:25:26.881 --> 01:25:28.700
<v Speaker 3>He was just crying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just weep.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the guys at the job or just loved.</v>

1946
01:25:33.670 --> 01:25:34.990
<v Speaker 3>He felt loved animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

1947

<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

1949

<v Speaker 3>That was a rough one.</v>

1953
01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:52.360
<v Speaker 3>I got an email,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe from his daughter.</v>

1954
01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:59.170
<v Speaker 3>It was a rough one.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The dog was a bummer,</v>

1959
01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:10.010
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was more of a bummer.</v>

1960
01:26:10.011 --> 01:26:14.030
<v Speaker 3>Even the way he was approaching it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just human.</v>

1961
01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:15.990
<v Speaker 3>He was approaching it very humanly like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1962
01:26:16.030 --> 01:26:19.040
<v Speaker 3>most doctors I guess or were expected </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're like,</v>

1963
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:23.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry if this person is passed onto </v>
<v Speaker 3>the callous about it at all.</v>

01:26:24.301 --> 01:26:27.830

<v Speaker 3>That's why I would imagine I would be as</v>

1966
01:26:27.831 --> 01:26:29.750
<v Speaker 3>a doctor just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so pockets.</v>

<v Speaker 3>this kind of a breakup.</v>

<v Speaker 3>again while they're just trying to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>money from you and lying about what </v>

<v Speaker 3>you've done so they can get more money </v>
<v Speaker 3>from you.</v>

1984
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:11.470
<v Speaker 3>He went through a bad one and I believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of his friends went through real </v>

1985
01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:11.720
<v Speaker 3>bad ones too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just,</v>

1986
01:27:11.721 --> 01:27:13.100
<v Speaker 3>he was one of those dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1987
01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>26,</v>

1988
01:27:14.481 --> 01:27:15.440
<v Speaker 3>27.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1989
01:27:15.441 --> 01:27:20.441
<v Speaker 3>Jesus man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel like this is a man of science </v>

1990
01:27:20.441 --> 01:27:20.441
<v Speaker 3>as a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows what he's talking about an,</v>

1991
01:27:20.441 --> 01:27:23.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a wise man who knew a lot of shit.</v>

1992
01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:25.230
<v Speaker 3>So when he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1993
01:27:25.290 --> 01:27:26.960
<v Speaker 3>I was a moron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he grabbed me.</v>

1994
01:27:26.961 --> 01:27:29.090
<v Speaker 3>Let's listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't fucking get married,</v>

<v Speaker 3>They got married,</v>

1996
01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:33.280
<v Speaker 3>he's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1997
01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:35.510
<v Speaker 3>he was just a guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1998
01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:38.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really firmly believe when it comes to</v>

1999
01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:41.660
<v Speaker 3>things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just people that are supposed to</v>

2000
01:27:41.661 --> 01:27:43.670
<v Speaker 3>be doing what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2001
01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:47.010
<v Speaker 3>And he was the guy that was supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be working with the animals like it.</v>

2002
01:27:47.070 --> 01:27:48.260
<v Speaker 3>It just worked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2003
01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:50.480
<v Speaker 3>He had the heart for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Veterinarian,</v>

2004
01:27:50.481 --> 01:27:52.580
<v Speaker 3>you've probably seen how many animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>die.</v>

2005
01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:57.760
<v Speaker 3>How many animals injured and still the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy's crying like a baby puppy is a baby</v>

2006
01:27:58.131 --> 01:28:03.131
<v Speaker 3>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wants to see a baby with this </v>

2007
01:28:03.131 --> 01:28:03.131
<v Speaker 3>world without a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the dude's got his heart in the right</v>

2008
01:28:03.131 --> 01:28:07.871
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the guy you want to bring your </v>

2009
01:28:07.871 --> 01:28:07.871
<v Speaker 3>animal to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent.</v>

2010
01:28:07.871 --> 01:28:07.871
<v Speaker 3>He's also the first guy that ever told </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

2011
01:28:07.871 --> 01:28:08.390
<v Speaker 3>don't get my dog fixed.</v>

2012
01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:09.380
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2013
01:28:09.381 --> 01:28:09.890
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2014
01:28:09.891 --> 01:28:11.630
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't let your dog have babies,</v>

2015
01:28:11.631 --> 01:28:13.130
<v Speaker 3>don't be an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2016
01:28:13.131 --> 01:28:18.131
<v Speaker 3>but if you get your dog fix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to realize you're not going </v>

2017
01:28:18.131 --> 01:28:18.131
<v Speaker 3>to have any testosterone anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be tired.</v>

2018
01:28:18.131 --> 01:28:18.890
<v Speaker 3>It's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to be the same dog.</v>

2019
01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:20.060
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

2020
01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:20.810
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2021
01:28:20.811 --> 01:28:25.811
<v Speaker 3>And so of course I got my dog faced and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just would not fucking listen to this </v>

2022
01:28:25.811 --> 01:28:27.470
<v Speaker 3>bag fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to calm him down.</v>

2023
01:28:27.471 --> 01:28:29.130
<v Speaker 3>He was a pit bull and he was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2024
01:28:29.131 --> 01:28:31.910
<v Speaker 3>aggressive when I want it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did calm him down,</v>

2025
01:28:31.911 --> 01:28:34.850
<v Speaker 3>but immediately lost most of his energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't,</v>

2026
01:28:34.851 --> 01:28:37.590
<v Speaker 3>he just didn't have the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same energy anymore.</v>

2027
01:28:37.591 --> 01:28:39.350
<v Speaker 3>It was kind of like bummed out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was weird.</v>

2028
01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:42.200
<v Speaker 3>The yellow lab that I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had to,</v>

2029
01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:45.230
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I first met Jennifer,</v>

2030
01:28:45.231 --> 01:28:50.231
<v Speaker 3>my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she got pregnant shortly after we met </v>

2031
01:28:51.170 --> 01:28:52.390
<v Speaker 3>Allah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2032
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:55.520
<v Speaker 3>that's how fucking virile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like a,</v>

2033
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:58.130
<v Speaker 3>like a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2034
01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:59.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2035
01:28:59.090 --> 01:29:00.050
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd never,</v>

2036
01:29:00.150 --> 01:29:01.650
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never even a dog,</v>

2037
01:29:01.830 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

2038
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:07.070
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should get a dog to see if we'd be </v>

2039
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.920
<v Speaker 1>good parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we went to the pet store in,</v>

2040
01:29:07.921 --> 01:29:12.921
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Menlo Park Mall in New Jersey and </v>

2041
01:29:12.921 --> 01:29:16.071
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked for yellow lab she had in her </v>

2042
01:29:16.071 --> 01:29:16.071
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

2043
01:29:16.071 --> 01:29:16.640
<v Speaker 1>I a yellow lab when I was a kid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the best dogs for children's,</v>

2044
01:29:16.641 --> 01:29:19.260
<v Speaker 1>so let's go get a yellow lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never had a dog in my life.</v>

2045
01:29:19.261 --> 01:29:20.580
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds great.</v>

2046
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:24.000
<v Speaker 1>I knew what they look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we went to the pet shop,</v>

2047
01:29:24.030 --> 01:29:29.030
<v Speaker 1>try to find a yellow lab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we found this dog that was blonde </v>

2048
01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:30.150
<v Speaker 1>leggy yellow lab and they were marketing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it as a yellow lab,</v>

2049
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:35.100
<v Speaker 1>but she'd been left behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the other puppies had gone and she'd</v>

2050
01:29:35.101 --> 01:29:36.620
<v Speaker 1>been there perhaps a little too long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2051
01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:38.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she wasn't a dog yet,</v>

2052
01:29:38.551 --> 01:29:40.920
<v Speaker 1>but she was fucking on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2053
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:41.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2054
01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:43.200
<v Speaker 1>what was the Brittany Spears Song?</v>

2055
01:29:44.180 --> 01:29:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not yet a womb.</v>

2056
01:29:47.191 --> 01:29:50.550
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the dog was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was too big for the fucking cage,</v>

2057
01:29:50.850 --> 01:29:53.150
<v Speaker 1>like her face was pressed up against and</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2058
01:29:53.250 --> 01:29:54.930
<v Speaker 1>So we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about this dog?</v>

2059
01:29:54.931 --> 01:29:59.931
<v Speaker 1>And it was been priced down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see like 2000 marked all the </v>

2060
01:29:59.931 --> 01:30:00.330
<v Speaker 1>way down to like 600 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And truly,</v>

2061
01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:05.900
<v Speaker 1>so we got that dog and you never see </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was like something out of a </v>

2062
01:30:06.151 --> 01:30:08.760
<v Speaker 1>fucking cartoon because we were the ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were like,</v>

2063
01:30:08.761 --> 01:30:11.850
<v Speaker 1>get out of this cramped ass cage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>come with us out into the parking lot.</v>

2064
01:30:12.930 --> 01:30:15.210
<v Speaker 1>Dog instantly bonded with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loved us.</v>

2065
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:17.690
<v Speaker 1>So fucking much became so needy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2066
01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:20.190
<v Speaker 1>we called it scully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're big fans of the x files.</v>

2067
01:30:20.670 --> 01:30:25.670
<v Speaker 1>So uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after a week of having that dog and the </v>

2068
01:30:25.670 --> 01:30:25.670
<v Speaker 1>dog was a cup in our grill all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

2069
01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:30.740
<v Speaker 1>thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you for fucking getting me out of </v>

2070
01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:30.740

2071
01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Like you are my people and Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>

2072
01:30:31.501 --> 01:30:33.450
<v Speaker 1>we should get another dog to babysit </v>
<v Speaker 1>this dog.</v>

2073
01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:35.670
<v Speaker 1>This dog has a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we went,</v>

2074
01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:38.980
<v Speaker 1>instead of to the pet store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went to a breeder's Kendall,</v>

2075
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:43.990
<v Speaker 1>like a pedigree place and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had puppies versions of fucking </v>

2076
01:30:44.250 --> 01:30:48.030
<v Speaker 1>yellow labs and they were adorable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fucking 10 of them falling all over</v>

2077
01:30:48.031 --> 01:30:49.530

<v Speaker 1>like an animated,</v>

2078
01:30:49.531 --> 01:30:53.430
<v Speaker 1>like a pixar movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Jennifer picks up one and bonds,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>600 bucks.</v>

2090
01:31:13.670 --> 01:31:18.570
<v Speaker 1>600 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went up to the counter and I was </v>

<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's too expensive.</v>

2098
01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:31.980
<v Speaker 1>I tried to represent.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We are stealing from you.</v>

2101
01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:38.970
<v Speaker 1>We got that dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to be fair,</v>

2102
01:31:39.450 --> 01:31:41.610
<v Speaker 1>we named a molder because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>x files,</v>

2103
01:31:41.611 --> 01:31:46.611
<v Speaker 1>Fan scully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and mulder and scully was just like </v>

01:31:46.611 --> 01:31:50.151
<v Speaker 1>happy heart that just loved molder was </v>
<v Speaker 1>so smart and fucking thoughtful.</v>

2105
01:31:52.710 --> 01:31:55.260
<v Speaker 1>He wrote my four best movies.</v>

2106
01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:58.230
<v Speaker 1>That's why he died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made tusk and Yoga hosers like without</v>

2107
01:31:58.231 --> 01:32:01.480
<v Speaker 1>that dog writing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you write for you?</v>

2108
01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:02.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

2109
01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:06.280
<v Speaker 1>He was fearful because he's just saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was so smart.</v>

2110
01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:08.430
<v Speaker 1>He was so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How smart wedding.</v>

2111
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:10.210
<v Speaker 1>He's so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote my last few scripts.</v>

2112
01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Joke didn't quite land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was missing something.</v>

2113
01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:18.560
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't set it up properly and not a </v>

2114
01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:18.560
<v Speaker 1>fucking pro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in any event,</v>

2115
01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:18.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he uh,</v>

2116
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:24.030
<v Speaker 1>he was wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we got them clipped and his demeanor</v>

2117
01:32:24.491 --> 01:32:27.050
<v Speaker 1>never really changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was always very low key.</v>

2118
01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:32.060
<v Speaker 1>We called him kilroy because he'd go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other side of the bed and just look </v>

2119
01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:32.060
<v Speaker 1>up like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2120
01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:33.130
<v Speaker 1>I got my massive snipped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't really change.</v>

2121
01:32:33.131 --> 01:32:35.530
<v Speaker 1>His personality stayed the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stayed the same,</v>

2122
01:32:35.531 --> 01:32:37.150
<v Speaker 1>but he was always kind of a mellow dog.</v>

2123
01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:40.150
<v Speaker 1>We got a very big dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like to do too much.</v>

2124
01:32:40.151 --> 01:32:43.330
<v Speaker 1>We got a rescue last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>year and a half ago.</v>

2125
01:32:43.810 --> 01:32:46.840
<v Speaker 1>That was like when you mother died a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple years ago.</v>

2126
01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2127
01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:49.480
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2128
01:32:49.570 --> 01:32:54.570
<v Speaker 1>he made it to 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like fucking old and for a big </v>

2129
01:32:54.570 --> 01:32:55.060
<v Speaker 1>dog too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty deep.</v>

2130
01:32:55.061 --> 01:32:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Like a doctrinal stick around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2131
01:32:57.460 --> 01:33:00.220
<v Speaker 1>fucking like cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a fucking big dog like that.</v>

2132
01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Generally you don't make it past 10:11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've got a lot of good years out of </v>

2133
01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:08.601
<v Speaker 1>him and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was fucking horrible when he </v>

2134
01:33:08.601 --> 01:33:10.261
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent the last two years of scalies </v>

2135
01:33:10.261 --> 01:33:11.320
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost as rehearsal for molder.</v>

2136
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:16.350
<v Speaker 1>They're yellow labs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what usually goes first is the hips </v>

2137
01:33:16.350 --> 01:33:17.530
<v Speaker 1>and the back legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So scalies back legs when she just,</v>

2138
01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:22.800
<v Speaker 1>the rest of her body could work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she was literally dragging your </v>

2139
01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:22.800
<v Speaker 1>carcass.</v>

2140
01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:23.470
<v Speaker 1>What was wrong with her legs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just went.</v>

2141
01:33:23.670 --> 01:33:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Dr was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this just happens.</v>

2142
01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:27.510
<v Speaker 1>They're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was 12,</v>

2143
01:33:27.530 --> 01:33:29.140
<v Speaker 1>13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she'd made it a while,</v>

2144
01:33:29.710 --> 01:33:32.530
<v Speaker 1>but I will just stop working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just give out.</v>

2145
01:33:32.710 --> 01:33:34.780
<v Speaker 1>So the nerves start firing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The legs stop.</v>

2146
01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:37.840
<v Speaker 1>There's no muscle left in language labs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2147
01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I put a scarf under her.</v>

2148
01:33:40.670 --> 01:33:45.670
<v Speaker 1>The back end of her called the magic </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking scarf and I would become the </v>

2149
01:33:45.670 --> 01:33:49.981
<v Speaker 1>back legs for her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she would walk and I would be the </v>

2150
01:33:49.981 --> 01:33:49.981
<v Speaker 1>back legs and fucking get shit and piss </v>
<v Speaker 1>all over and stuff.</v>

2151
01:33:49.981 --> 01:33:51.520
<v Speaker 1>But I'd doug the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was no big deal.</v>

2152
01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:54.790
<v Speaker 1>So I did that all the way up to when </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott passed away.</v>

2153
01:33:54.910 --> 01:33:59.410
<v Speaker 1>And then molder was always very healthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fucking mobile and loved walking and</v>

2154
01:33:59.411 --> 01:34:00.730
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super Athletic Dog.</v>

2155
01:34:00.731 --> 01:34:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Jen would take them up on Runyon Canyon </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>

2156
01:34:03.610 --> 01:34:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Then one day he had his back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legs started dropping and your fucking </v>

2157
01:34:08.610 --> 01:34:09.310
<v Speaker 1>heart sinks because your leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2158
01:34:09.311 --> 01:34:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Scully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't that active,</v>

2159
01:34:10.991 --> 01:34:13.210
<v Speaker 1>so when she lost her legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as a bummer,</v>

2160
01:34:13.211 --> 01:34:16.880
<v Speaker 1>but she wasn't like the run around dog </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she used to chase moldy,</v>

2161
01:34:16.890 --> 01:34:21.890
<v Speaker 1>you throw ball molded would run after </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she would just chase molder and </v>

2162
01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:25.411
<v Speaker 1>tried to bite his back legs to prevent </v>
<v Speaker 1>him from doing it because she wasn't </v>

2163
01:34:25.411 --> 01:34:25.570
<v Speaker 1>nearly as fast molder was the go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

2164
01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:28.630
<v Speaker 1>He loved to fucking be active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when his back legs,</v>

2165
01:34:28.631 --> 01:34:33.631
<v Speaker 1>when it was like heartbreaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he stuck around for two more </v>

2166
01:34:33.631 --> 01:34:35.670
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was literally two years of me Walk</v>

2167
01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Magic walking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scarfing,</v>

2168
01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:39.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dog.</v>

2169
01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he got to the place where he did,</v>

2170
01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:44.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't just temporary,</v>

2171
01:34:44.921 --> 01:34:46.690
<v Speaker 1>but when you were talking about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounded so familiar,</v>

2172
01:34:46.691 --> 01:34:48.940
<v Speaker 1>he would do that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing where he would be like,</v>

2173
01:34:50.130 --> 01:34:55.130
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this will go on for fucking hours.</v>

2174
01:34:55.450 --> 01:34:58.910
<v Speaker 1>And you could tell it was exhausting him</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he couldn't fucking move.</v>

2175
01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:01.670
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2176
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:04.040
<v Speaker 1>everyone in the family was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's time to let them go.</v>

2177
01:35:04.041 --> 01:35:06.020
<v Speaker 1>And this was like when he first lost his</v>
<v Speaker 1>legs,</v>

2178
01:35:06.021 --> 01:35:07.460
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you fucking shit man,</v>

2179
01:35:07.461 --> 01:35:12.461
<v Speaker 1>if like if I lose my legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better fucking put a magic walking </v>

2180
01:35:12.461 --> 01:35:14.240
<v Speaker 1>scarf around my fat ass and not fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned me over to the needle.</v>

2181
01:35:14.241 --> 01:35:15.950
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking family here.</v>

2182
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:21.790
<v Speaker 1>So I held onto them for as long as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could until he got to that place where </v>

2183
01:35:21.801 --> 01:35:26.060
<v Speaker 1>he was like an obvious fucking pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember I shot a video of it.</v>

2184
01:35:26.590 --> 01:35:28.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm on my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still have it and it's not,</v>

2185
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:30.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds fucking cruel or sick.</v>

2186
01:35:30.981 --> 01:35:35.981
<v Speaker 1>But like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just a reminder because every </v>

2187
01:35:35.981 --> 01:35:39.581
<v Speaker 1>once in a while like I knew eventually </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we would have to put them down and </v>

2188
01:35:39.581 --> 01:35:40.760
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a weird relationship where one</v>

2189
01:35:40.761 --> 01:35:45.761
<v Speaker 1>day you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you to death and I love you so </v>

2190
01:35:45.761 --> 01:35:45.761
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to fucking kill you.</v>

2191
01:35:45.761 --> 01:35:49.600
<v Speaker 1>So I had that video on my phone for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>longest time so that when in like the </v>

2192
01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:51.620
<v Speaker 1>wee small hours of the morning I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>wake up and be like,</v>

2193
01:35:51.621 --> 01:35:55.220
<v Speaker 1>you killed your best fucking friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could watch that video and be like,</v>

2194
01:35:55.221 --> 01:35:57.710
<v Speaker 1>you had to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had like keep wanting to go.</v>

2195
01:35:57.711 --> 01:36:01.040
<v Speaker 1>So it was sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the doctor came over,</v>

2196
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:03.770
<v Speaker 1>we got the vet to come over to the house</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

2197
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:08.830
<v Speaker 1>it was like a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like we all knew it was coming </v>

2198
01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:11.051
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was flying home from a Gig and I kept </v>

2199
01:36:11.051 --> 01:36:11.690
<v Speaker 1>telling him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer,</v>

2200
01:36:11.691 --> 01:36:13.970
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do anything just like freeze,</v>

2201
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.710
<v Speaker 1>like I'll be there as quickly as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

2202
01:36:16.610 --> 01:36:20.050
<v Speaker 1>And so like Dr Kumar who is our vet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2203
01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:25.060
<v Speaker 1>was scheduled to come over and that last</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hour was probably hands down the</v>

2204
01:36:27.261 --> 01:36:28.850
<v Speaker 1>most of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2205
01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:32.340
<v Speaker 1>because we all knew it was coming in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your program to,</v>

2206
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:37.280
<v Speaker 1>to stop that at all cost program to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>people around and keep yourself around.</v>

2207
01:36:39.170 --> 01:36:44.170
<v Speaker 1>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we were just all sitting there </v>

2208
01:36:44.170 --> 01:36:46.511
<v Speaker 1>loving on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing that like at the time Dr Kumar </v>

2209
01:36:46.511 --> 01:36:46.511
<v Speaker 1>gets here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all done.</v>

2210
01:36:46.511 --> 01:36:48.890
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking hard as artist thing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world to do and he was still in pain</v>

2211
01:36:48.891 --> 01:36:53.891
<v Speaker 1>the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though you knew you were doing </v>

2212
01:36:53.891 --> 01:36:53.891
<v Speaker 1>the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

2213
01:36:53.891 --> 01:36:55.940
<v Speaker 1>like I understand why that vet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2214
01:36:55.941 --> 01:37:00.941
<v Speaker 1>got emotional stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in any event that we lost that dog a </v>

2215
01:37:01.551 --> 01:37:02.960
<v Speaker 1>while ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of years ago,</v>

2216
01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:08.680
<v Speaker 1>and on my 45th birthday when we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>back east doing a show with the count </v>

2217
01:37:08.781 --> 01:37:11.450
<v Speaker 1>basie theater in red bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing yoga,</v>

2218
01:37:11.451 --> 01:37:15.830
<v Speaker 1>hosers screening it and we were shooting</v>
<v Speaker 1>it for the kind of compliment show.</v>

2219
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:18.890
<v Speaker 1>So I was driving down the highway in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Middletown,</v>

2220
01:37:18.891 --> 01:37:23.891
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I passed the place where we had </v>

2221
01:37:23.891 --> 01:37:23.891
<v Speaker 1>bought molder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was just like,</v>

2222
01:37:23.891 --> 01:37:25.520
<v Speaker 1>you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 45 years old.</v>

2223
01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:27.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm a grown ass fucking man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

2224
01:37:27.371 --> 01:37:29.360
<v Speaker 1>I make my own money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do whatever I want.</v>

2225
01:37:29.361 --> 01:37:32.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm going buy a fucking dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to replace that dog.</v>

2226
01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get me another yellow lab </v>

2227
01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:37.360
<v Speaker 1>and we've had two dogs since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2228
01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:41.501
<v Speaker 1>We got a Louis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a chocolate lab and check he </v>

2229
01:37:41.501 --> 01:37:41.501
<v Speaker 1>was my favorite little miniature </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctrine,</v>

2230
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:43.940
<v Speaker 1>but like I missed molder and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to replace them.</v>

2231
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:45.980
<v Speaker 1>And then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I went in to the pet store,</v>

2232
01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:47.570
<v Speaker 1>same place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the puppies,</v>

2233
01:37:47.571 --> 01:37:48.230
<v Speaker 1>puppies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puppies,</v>

2234
01:37:48.231 --> 01:37:53.231
<v Speaker 1>where we had gotten older and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked in and I didn't see any yellow </v>

2235
01:37:53.231 --> 01:37:53.900
<v Speaker 1>labs and there was nobody at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter.</v>

2236
01:37:53.901 --> 01:37:54.660
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2237
01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:56.580
<v Speaker 1>I'll get outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And The lady comes out and she's like,</v>

2238
01:37:56.581 --> 01:37:57.450
<v Speaker 1>can I help you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2239
01:37:57.451 --> 01:37:58.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2240
01:37:58.961 --> 01:37:59.640
<v Speaker 1>it's was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

2241
01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came looking for a yellow lab,</v>

2242
01:38:01.411 --> 01:38:03.270
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys don't have any.</v>

2243
01:38:03.271 --> 01:38:04.440
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have one in the back.</v>

2244
01:38:05.370 --> 01:38:06.930
<v Speaker 1>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay,</v>

2245
01:38:06.990 --> 01:38:07.830
<v Speaker 1>can I meet him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

2246
01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:08.610
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit right down.</v>

2247
01:38:08.611 --> 01:38:10.590
<v Speaker 1>They put you into a little room and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

2248
01:38:10.630 --> 01:38:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Then they bring the dog in and in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>head I'm like,</v>

2249
01:38:13.490 --> 01:38:15.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm counting the money out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2250
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:20.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's inflation has hit the dog </v>
<v Speaker 1>market so it's going to be more than </v>

2251
01:38:20.510 --> 01:38:23.661
<v Speaker 1>4,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm ready to fucking go and then </v>

2252
01:38:23.661 --> 01:38:25.290
<v Speaker 1>they bring in this puppy and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

2253
01:38:25.530 --> 01:38:28.230
<v Speaker 1>He was a good dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very bouncy and energetic as fuck.</v>

2254
01:38:28.410 --> 01:38:31.050
<v Speaker 1>You could cut this dog's nuts off and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have mattered,</v>

2255
01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:34.650
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't molder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked exactly like him,</v>

2256
01:38:34.710 --> 01:38:39.710
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was this weird lesson of like when </v>

2257
01:38:39.710 --> 01:38:43.431
<v Speaker 1>it's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gone and you need to appreciate it </v>

2258
01:38:43.431 --> 01:38:44.730
<v Speaker 1>more when it's there because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2259
01:38:45.090 --> 01:38:47.940
<v Speaker 1>they tell you this from a young age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like everything,</v>

2260
01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:51.720
<v Speaker 1>everything dies and nothing's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>replaceable at the end of the day.</v>

2261
01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:54.510
<v Speaker 1>So as I sat there playing with his dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2262
01:38:54.511 --> 01:38:57.240
<v Speaker 1>it's not like it's not him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never going to be him.</v>

2263
01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:02.720
<v Speaker 1>And I would sit there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raise the dog his whole life expecting </v>

2264
01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:06.290
<v Speaker 1>to be something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody else out there wants this </v>

2265
01:39:06.290 --> 01:39:06.780
<v Speaker 1>fucking hyper poppy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Me,</v>

2266
01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:07.920
<v Speaker 1>but I took a picture of it because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

2267
01:39:07.921 --> 01:39:12.921
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fuck with my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I took a picture of the dog and </v>

2268
01:39:12.921 --> 01:39:15.741
<v Speaker 1>texted a tour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife instantly calls me back and be </v>

2269
01:39:15.741 --> 01:39:15.741
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not buy a fucking dog.</v>

2270
01:39:15.741 --> 01:39:16.950
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2271
01:39:16.951 --> 01:39:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm a 45 year old grown ass man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could do what I want.</v>

2272
01:39:19.261 --> 01:39:19.770
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2273
01:39:19.771 --> 01:39:23.790
<v Speaker 1>we have two older dogs at home and it'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>be so unfair to bring a new dog into the</v>

2274
01:39:23.791 --> 01:39:26.190
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she hit me on that level going like,</v>

2275
01:39:26.191 --> 01:39:26.640
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

2276
01:39:26.670 --> 01:39:27.660

<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

2277
01:39:27.661 --> 01:39:29.670
<v Speaker 1>you got to wait until one of the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>dogs dies.</v>

2278
01:39:29.671 --> 01:39:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Then you could buy a new dog as it fair </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough and two days later,</v>

2279
01:39:33.541 --> 01:39:35.970
<v Speaker 1>my wife we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right before we go home to Los Angeles,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like uncharacteristically says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this dog in my twitter feed.</v>

2281
01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it looked like this,</v>

2282
01:39:43.801 --> 01:39:48.801
<v Speaker 1>a macerated fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked like the dog from the Sarah </v>

2283
01:39:48.801 --> 01:39:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Mclaughlin Song.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking can,</v>

2285
01:39:52.951 --> 01:39:55.860
<v Speaker 1>just like bones with a dog head on it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit,</v>

2286
01:39:56.670 --> 01:39:57.720
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so sad.</v>

2287
01:39:57.721 --> 01:40:02.721

01:40:02.721 --> 01:40:04.290
<v Speaker 1>of kill shelter with a rope and was </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to be all through the rope and so</v>

01:40:04.291 --> 01:40:09.291
<v Speaker 1>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took it home to foster it but they </v>

2290
01:40:09.291 --> 01:40:11.391
<v Speaker 1>can't keep it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They already have six dogs so they need </v>

2291
01:40:11.391 --> 01:40:11.391
<v Speaker 1>a home for this dog.</v>

2292
01:40:11.391 --> 01:40:12.150
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2296
01:40:21.291 --> 01:40:21.291
<v Speaker 1>unfair to the other two old dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>saw this dog that sounded like the </v>

2299
01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:28.500
<v Speaker 1>distemper case that you described with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the puppy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2321
01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:26.880
<v Speaker 1>So I started making eggs every morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just scrambled eggs and I'd give </v>

<v Speaker 1>these eggs are so plain,</v>

2324
01:41:27.610 --> 01:41:29.530
<v Speaker 1>so I started putting like bacon and ham </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cheese.</v>

2325
01:41:29.531 --> 01:41:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Started making omelets for the dog and </v>

<v Speaker 1>but given her omelets every morning he </v>

2331
01:41:46.411 --> 01:41:46.411
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say to cook the eggs.</v>

2332
01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:47.080
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

2333
01:41:47.081 --> 01:41:52.081
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just break an egg and put it in a </v>

2334
01:41:52.081 --> 01:41:52.081
<v Speaker 1>bowl to fucking dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just eat it like you made it eggs.</v>

2335
01:41:52.081 --> 01:41:52.490
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2336
01:41:52.690 --> 01:41:54.700
<v Speaker 1>got in a fight with my wife many times </v>
<v Speaker 1>because she was like,</v>

2337
01:41:54.701 --> 01:41:56.020
<v Speaker 1>you never made me an Omelet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2338
01:41:56.021 --> 01:41:57.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dog is dying here.</v>

2339
01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:59.440
<v Speaker 1>So that dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we nursed it back to health.</v>

2340
01:41:59.441 --> 01:42:04.441
<v Speaker 1>We named it Mad Martin Marty and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

2341
01:42:04.481 --> 01:42:08.110
<v Speaker 1>we all know her history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she figures she's six years old.</v>

2342
01:42:08.111 --> 01:42:12.070
<v Speaker 1>The doctor guest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's clearly a street dog and she lives</v>

2343
01:42:12.850 --> 01:42:13.600
<v Speaker 1>in her head.</v>

2344
01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:18.600
<v Speaker 1>I guess the same way that you described </v>
<v Speaker 1>did everything was fucking terrifying.</v>

2345
01:42:18.941 --> 01:42:23.590
<v Speaker 1>Took a long time for the fucking trust </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she loves my fucking wife.</v>

2346
01:42:23.591 --> 01:42:28.591
<v Speaker 1>Like she must understand that like she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the one that fucking got her into </v>

2347
01:42:28.591 --> 01:42:31.981
<v Speaker 1>this house and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when other people come into the room </v>

2348
01:42:31.981 --> 01:42:36.710
<v Speaker 1>just goes fucking nuts because she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very fucking protective of the wife and </v>

2349
01:42:36.710 --> 01:42:41.431
<v Speaker 1>shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She could flip fast and recently we had </v>

2350
01:42:41.431 --> 01:42:42.100
<v Speaker 1>an incident in the house because she </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get along with two other dogs,</v>

2351
01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:47.520
<v Speaker 1>so we have to put up all these like what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call a checkpoint charlies in the SC </v>

2352
01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:47.520
<v Speaker 1>series of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2353
01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:47.520
<v Speaker 3>dog gates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dogs,</v>

2354
01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:49.810
<v Speaker 3>cadaver dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all female.</v>

2355
01:42:49.811 --> 01:42:54.380
<v Speaker 3>Three females that I've had problems </v>
<v Speaker 3>with that in the past females did not.</v>

2356
01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:58.300
<v Speaker 3>They don't give up the Alpha position </v>
<v Speaker 3>like males would give up.</v>

2357
01:42:58.330 --> 01:43:03.330
<v Speaker 3>Like if you have a couple males and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>boss will run the house.</v>

2358
01:43:03.731 --> 01:43:07.270
<v Speaker 3>Like I have two males.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them is 120 pounds.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So who's the boss?</v>

2363
01:43:17.970 --> 01:43:19.690
<v Speaker 3>The ones the boss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but females,</v>

2364
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:21.400
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't give up on that.</v>

2365
01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:23.330
<v Speaker 3>They just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the author.</v>

2366
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:25.960
<v Speaker 3>Keep going after each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really common,</v>

2367
01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:31.440
<v Speaker 3>really common with females,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you leave them alone for </v>

2368
01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:31.630
<v Speaker 3>any length of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fuck each other up,</v>

2369
01:43:31.631 --> 01:43:32.950
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it happened.</v>

2370
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:35.440
<v Speaker 3>Not on my watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank God it happened.</v>

2371
01:43:36.810 --> 01:43:38.380
<v Speaker 3>Did it happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I asked her.</v>

2372
01:43:38.410 --> 01:43:40.990
<v Speaker 3>I used to have two females was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrible.</v>

2373
01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:43.090
<v Speaker 3>Ours was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ours happened when I was away.</v>

2374
01:43:43.091 --> 01:43:44.800
<v Speaker 3>I was just doing a show two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three weeks ago.</v>

2375
01:43:44.801 --> 01:43:47.880
<v Speaker 3>I was in Vancouver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few Canadian shows that night.</v>

2376
01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:48.220
<v Speaker 3>My kids</v>

2377
01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:51.620
<v Speaker 1>and then she was like Marty and check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got into a and I was like,</v>

2378
01:43:51.621 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2379
01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:54.290
<v Speaker 2>And check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is literally shine and adoption.</v>

2380
01:43:54.291 --> 01:43:58.040
<v Speaker 2>She's a minute reduction and Marty is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the size of a football and mixed pit,</v>

2381
01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:01.490
<v Speaker 2>so they've seen each other that walk </v>
<v Speaker 2>with each other.</v>

2382
01:44:01.491 --> 01:44:03.870
<v Speaker 2>We walk them in the hills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the walk side by side and shit.</v>

2383
01:44:03.871 --> 01:44:08.090
<v Speaker 2>But the moment you get in that house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just territory of why?</v>

2384
01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:10.820
<v Speaker 2>Because they want your love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your love feels so good.</v>

2385
01:44:10.850 --> 01:44:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Like if you come over and massage them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and another dog comes by,</v>

2386
01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:16.630
<v Speaker 2>you might stop massaging them and start </v>
<v Speaker 2>massaging that other dogs.</v>

2387
01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:18.680
<v Speaker 2>They'll attack that dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding.</v>

2388
01:44:18.710 --> 01:44:21.350
<v Speaker 2>That's because the dog's a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>

2389
01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:26.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially dogs that had been </v>

2390
01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:26.380
<v Speaker 2>mistreated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So jealous.</v>

2391
01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:29.920
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My dog that had an issue with this was </v>

2392
01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:32.171
<v Speaker 2>also a dog that I got from the pound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a couple from the one from the </v>

2393
01:44:32.171 --> 01:44:35.531
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was covered in mange and I nursed </v>

2394
01:44:35.531 --> 01:44:35.531
<v Speaker 2>her back to health in a similar story.</v>

2395
01:44:35.531 --> 01:44:36.960
<v Speaker 2>She was two years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had a Greg Nipples,</v>

2396
01:44:36.961 --> 01:44:39.320
<v Speaker 2>so she had had puppies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

2397
01:44:39.321 --> 01:44:39.810
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>

2398
01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:44.240
<v Speaker 2>This dog has also ics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd you call it?</v>

2399
01:44:44.241 --> 01:44:46.100
<v Speaker 2>The standard extended extended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2400
01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:47.130
<v Speaker 2>ma'am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have the wrong foot.</v>

2401
01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:52.160
<v Speaker 2>They said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't necessarily mean like in </v>

2402
01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:52.160
<v Speaker 2>Marty's case he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2403
01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:54.230
<v Speaker 2>did she have puppies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it looked like she had nipples,</v>

2404
01:44:54.231 --> 01:44:55.070
<v Speaker 2>but he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2405
01:44:55.130 --> 01:44:58.730
<v Speaker 2>It's also some cases that happens with </v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs that are associated,</v>

2406
01:44:58.731 --> 01:45:01.490
<v Speaker 2>but I can't imagine a street dog didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get laid,</v>

2407
01:45:01.491 --> 01:45:02.600
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2408
01:45:02.630 --> 01:45:04.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean the vet said that she had had </v>
<v Speaker 2>puppies.</v>

2409
01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:07.250
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno why he determined that.</v>

2410
01:45:07.340 --> 01:45:09.740
<v Speaker 2>I think he had said because the nipples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were hanging low,</v>

2411
01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:12.180
<v Speaker 2>like I always have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2412
01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:17.620
<v Speaker 2>but the two females,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the male got along great with both </v>

2413
01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:17.620
<v Speaker 2>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had no problems with them,</v>

2414
01:45:17.690 --> 01:45:18.590
<v Speaker 2>but those females,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2415
01:45:18.591 --> 01:45:23.591
<v Speaker 2>they would fight all the fucking time </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they would fight whenever one of </v>

2416
01:45:23.591 --> 01:45:23.750
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when someone come over to get pet,</v>

2417
01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:29.140
<v Speaker 2>like they got into a big fight once </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the pool guy came over and the </v>

2418
01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:29.240
<v Speaker 2>pool guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2419
01:45:29.241 --> 01:45:29.570
<v Speaker 2>what's up?</v>

2420
01:45:29.570 --> 01:45:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Kids?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he pat one of the dogs over the </v>

2421
01:45:34.570 --> 01:45:34.570
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other one.</v>

2422
01:45:34.570 --> 01:45:35.340
<v Speaker 2>And so they started going after each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

2423
01:45:35.341 --> 01:45:35.900
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

2424
01:45:35.901 --> 01:45:36.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

2425
01:45:37.050 --> 01:45:38.000
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get this,</v>

2426
01:45:38.001 --> 01:45:38.470
<v Speaker 2>call him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2427
01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:41.480
<v Speaker 2>your dogs are about to fuck each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>up over the pool guy.</v>

2428
01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:42.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

2429
01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:46.250
<v Speaker 2>you're so guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had to keep the girls separate.</v>

2430
01:45:47.570 --> 01:45:49.700
<v Speaker 2>We were keeping them separate with </v>
<v Speaker 2>gates,</v>

2431
01:45:49.701 --> 01:45:54.701
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody turned back and the two wound </v>

2432
01:45:54.701 --> 01:45:59.411
<v Speaker 2>up in the same space and fucking went at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and so one dog's way bigger than the </v>

2433
01:45:59.411 --> 01:46:04.391
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the big dog little dog up by her </v>

2434
01:46:04.391 --> 01:46:07.190
<v Speaker 2>hind quarters and was shaking the leg </v>
<v Speaker 2>shakes a toy.</v>

2435
01:46:07.550 --> 01:46:12.550
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile shecky was the little one </v>
<v Speaker 2>is she has no napoleon complex so she's </v>

2436
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:14.420
<v Speaker 2>got no idea of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're bigger than me.</v>

2437
01:46:14.450 --> 01:46:15.230
<v Speaker 2>She didn't give a fuck.</v>

2438
01:46:15.230 --> 01:46:18.500
<v Speaker 2>So as the dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as Marty is swinging,</v>

2439
01:46:18.501 --> 01:46:23.501
<v Speaker 2>shecky the little dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little dog is swinging from side to </v>

2440
01:46:23.501 --> 01:46:25.850
<v Speaker 2>side brightener and then swinging to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other side and biting her.</v>

2441
01:46:25.851 --> 01:46:28.550
<v Speaker 2>She wouldn't go down dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I imagine if somebody bit me in the</v>

2442
01:46:28.551 --> 01:46:30.530
<v Speaker 2>ass and shook me from side to side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

2443
01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:32.780
<v Speaker 2>you when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this dog was just like,</v>

2444
01:46:32.970 --> 01:46:37.970
<v Speaker 2>fuck fucking hell's are a stab at the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She kept trying to go right back at her.</v>

2445
01:46:38.510 --> 01:46:42.420
<v Speaker 2>So when I came home it was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>heartbreaking because I'd heard they got</v>

2446
01:46:42.430 --> 01:46:45.080
<v Speaker 2>in a fight and my daughter was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's got stitches and stuff.</v>

2447
01:46:45.410 --> 01:46:49.540
<v Speaker 2>So I was prepared for stitches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I got home it was like it.</v>

2448
01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:51.770
<v Speaker 2>It looked fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she is.</v>

2449
01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:54.450
<v Speaker 2>She looked like a fucking walrus from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tusk,</v>

2450
01:46:54.451 --> 01:46:57.900
<v Speaker 2>like a Frankenstein version of her lane </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the other dog.</v>

2451
01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:03.180
<v Speaker 2>She had pieces of her like missing </v>
<v Speaker 2>chunks out of sketchy and she was like,</v>

2452
01:47:03.181 --> 01:47:08.181
<v Speaker 2>she knew she got in trouble because </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jennifer like put her into what we call </v>

2453
01:47:08.181 --> 01:47:08.181
<v Speaker 2>chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prisons.</v>

2454
01:47:08.181 --> 01:47:12.891
<v Speaker 2>The other side of the gate where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>lured the dogs in the chicken and then </v>

2455
01:47:12.891 --> 01:47:13.320
<v Speaker 2>you're locked in the bathroom and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could still see everybody else,</v>

2456
01:47:13.321 --> 01:47:15.150
<v Speaker 2>but there's a gate keeping you on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>side of the room.</v>

2457
01:47:15.390 --> 01:47:20.390
<v Speaker 2>So she went to jail for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could tell she felt fucking bad </v>

2458
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:23.850
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But does it linger like you seem to know</v>

2459
01:47:23.851 --> 01:47:28.851
<v Speaker 2>more about dogs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That little dogs always going to </v>

2460
01:47:28.851 --> 01:47:28.851
<v Speaker 2>remember that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're both gonna.</v>

2461
01:47:28.851 --> 01:47:28.851
<v Speaker 2>Remember it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2462
01:47:28.851 --> 01:47:30.210
<v Speaker 2>If you leave them alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to do it again.</v>

2463
01:47:30.630 --> 01:47:33.420
<v Speaker 2>The girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you brought home a,</v>

2464
01:47:33.421 --> 01:47:35.400
<v Speaker 2>an extra wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you think that would work out?</v>

2465
01:47:36.370 --> 01:47:38.610
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly how it's like with dogs.</v>

2466
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:42.120
<v Speaker 2>They don't know that they told you that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Craig,</v>

2467
01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:43.880
<v Speaker 2>my friend who died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2468
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:45.210
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2469
01:47:45.300 --> 01:47:47.550
<v Speaker 2>he just said you can't have two girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2470
01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:48.380
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just gonna.</v>

2471
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:50.850
<v Speaker 2>They're going to go at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes more often than not,</v>

2472
01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:51.870
<v Speaker 2>he goes like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you leave them alone.</v>

2473
01:47:51.871 --> 01:47:56.871
<v Speaker 2>You have a nice big yard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter because they're going to </v>

2474
01:47:56.871 --> 01:47:56.871
<v Speaker 2>find out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to sit there.</v>

2475
01:47:56.871 --> 01:47:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Why you sitting there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my spot.</v>

2476
01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:59.220
<v Speaker 2>That's my boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dogs won't do that to no boy,</v>

2477
01:47:59.221 --> 01:48:00.880
<v Speaker 2>dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cats or other shit.</v>

2478
01:48:00.881 --> 01:48:02.130
<v Speaker 2>I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can fight.</v>

2479
01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:04.720
<v Speaker 2>But boy dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the alpha.</v>

2480
01:48:04.810 --> 01:48:07.530
<v Speaker 2>This is according to dog people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not me.</v>

2481
01:48:07.531 --> 01:48:08.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know what I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

2482
01:48:09.210 --> 01:48:11.880
<v Speaker 2>But what is the way it's been explained </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me is that boy,</v>

2483
01:48:11.881 --> 01:48:13.440
<v Speaker 2>dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the most part,</v>

2484
01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:16.470
<v Speaker 2>with few exceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exceptions will pick an alpha.</v>

2485
01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:17.760
<v Speaker 2>Alpha would lead the pack.</v>

2486
01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:22.820
<v Speaker 2>Then unless he's challenged by a new dog</v>
<v Speaker 2>or one of the dogs gets bigger or </v>

2487
01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:26.481
<v Speaker 2>something happens and he gets older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless there's some sort of a shifting </v>

2488
01:48:26.481 --> 01:48:27.900
<v Speaker 2>of the chain of command,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he will remain the Alpha forever.</v>

2489
01:48:28.170 --> 01:48:29.790
<v Speaker 2>He's the Alpha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the big dog.</v>

2490
01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:31.890
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't know this about the office </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

2491
01:48:31.891 --> 01:48:34.680
<v Speaker 2>And with scully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2492
01:48:34.790 --> 01:48:36.510
<v Speaker 2>I was again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new dog owner,</v>

2493
01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:41.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would go to La Scala and mold out </v>

2494
01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:44.370
<v Speaker 2>and scaly would barge through the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the alpha.</v>

2495
01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:45.960
<v Speaker 2>First she was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's the alpha.</v>

2496
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:50.990
<v Speaker 2>So I what I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't know this until later in </v>

2497
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:53.691
<v Speaker 2>life later in her life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I would get like fucking shitty </v>

2498
01:48:53.691 --> 01:48:53.691
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2499
01:48:53.691 --> 01:48:54.500
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>

2500
01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:57.510
<v Speaker 2>And so I'd hold her back and let him </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

2501
01:48:58.020 --> 01:49:02.520
<v Speaker 2>And the betrayal on her face and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>confusion on mother's face of like,</v>

2507
01:49:10.131 --> 01:49:12.021
<v Speaker 2>human characteristics to animals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We decide that we're going to stop </v>

2508
01:49:12.021 --> 01:49:13.380
<v Speaker 2>bullying amongst like I know the order </v>
<v Speaker 2>of things.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Bullying and grade school,</v>

2510

<v Speaker 2>bad bullying and dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Ain't gonna do shit about it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You just let it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let that go.</v>

2512
01:49:20.370 --> 01:49:21.630

<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

2513
01:49:21.631 --> 01:49:22.580
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

2514
01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:24.750
<v Speaker 2>my two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my two older dogs,</v>

2515
01:49:25.020 --> 01:49:27.180
<v Speaker 2>they own the only ones that have issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marshall's,</v>

2516
01:49:27.210 --> 01:49:29.340
<v Speaker 2>the younger dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He runs circles around everybody.</v>

2517
01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:33.850
<v Speaker 2>When I opened the door to feed them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big one comes in first every time.</v>

2518
01:49:33.851 --> 01:49:35.340
<v Speaker 2>And if the little ones to close the </v>
<v Speaker 2>door,</v>

2519
01:49:35.550 --> 01:49:40.550
<v Speaker 2>he'll fucking sideswipe bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm eating first as we would clear </v>

2520
01:49:41.370 --> 01:49:42.990
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I let them do it.</v>

2521
01:49:42.991 --> 01:49:44.670
<v Speaker 2>They don't fight with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2522
01:49:44.671 --> 01:49:45.090
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2523
01:49:45.091 --> 01:49:46.950
<v Speaker 2>they're cool with everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is just the,</v>

2524
01:49:46.990 --> 01:49:48.580
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the leadership</v>

2525
01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:53.940
<v Speaker 3>that they've established and it's one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things that like hit me in the </v>

2526
01:49:53.940 --> 01:49:54.970
<v Speaker 3>wrong way because I'm not an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

2527
01:49:54.971 --> 01:49:55.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2528
01:49:55.721 --> 01:49:58.270
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've obviously got a system down.</v>

2529
01:49:58.271 --> 01:50:00.100
<v Speaker 3>They've worked it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's fucking cool.</v>

2530
01:50:00.101 --> 01:50:03.220
<v Speaker 3>My friend Whitney Cummings knows way </v>
<v Speaker 3>more about dogs and animals than I do.</v>

2531
01:50:03.221 --> 01:50:07.930
<v Speaker 3>She actually has like a horse that she </v>
<v Speaker 3>raises that's like a rescue horse.</v>

2532
01:50:08.170 --> 01:50:13.090
<v Speaker 3>She rides it with no saddle and she has </v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of dogs and weight rescue horse.</v>

2533
01:50:13.150 --> 01:50:14.830
<v Speaker 3>Somebody like gunbarrel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2534
01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:16.210
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a horse.</v>

2535
01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:19.810
<v Speaker 3>I think they use them for movies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stunt horses.</v>

2536
01:50:19.811 --> 01:50:24.811
<v Speaker 3>And stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have one person who owns </v>

2537
01:50:24.811 --> 01:50:26.971
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some horses get abandoned and she </v>

2538
01:50:26.971 --> 01:50:29.071
<v Speaker 3>rescued this one horse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So very similar to what happens with </v>

2539
01:50:29.071 --> 01:50:29.071
<v Speaker 3>dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone abandons a horse,</v>

2540
01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:31.450
<v Speaker 3>horses get abused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

2541
01:50:31.451 --> 01:50:35.080
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to cat Zingano the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>day too,</v>

2542
01:50:35.081 --> 01:50:40.081
<v Speaker 3>is one of the top UFC bantamweight </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters and she was talking about </v>

2543
01:50:40.081 --> 01:50:44.790
<v Speaker 3>equine therapy too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that she's worked with horses and takes </v>

2544
01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:46.330
<v Speaker 3>care of horses and there's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>about a human bond with a horse.</v>

2545
01:50:46.330 --> 01:50:50.140
<v Speaker 3>You're petting a horse and riding a </v>
<v Speaker 3>horse and feeding a horse is like a very</v>

2546
01:50:50.141 --> 01:50:53.230
<v Speaker 3>good love bond that people develop with </v>
<v Speaker 3>horses.</v>

2547
01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.300
<v Speaker 3>But in Whitney knows a shitload about </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

2548
01:50:55.301 --> 01:50:58.450
<v Speaker 3>My point she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I talked to her about her dogs,</v>

2549
01:50:58.600 --> 01:50:59.530
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she goes,</v>

2550
01:50:59.531 --> 01:51:00.310
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the boss.</v>

2551
01:51:00.430 --> 01:51:02.050
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't walk around them.</v>

2552
01:51:02.051 --> 01:51:03.820
<v Speaker 3>I walked through them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've walked through them.</v>

2553
01:51:03.821 --> 01:51:07.840
<v Speaker 3>I pad out of my fucking way like we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a real clear,</v>

2554
01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:10.420
<v Speaker 3>like there's a power structure in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

2555
01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:14.590
<v Speaker 3>Whitney's the top boss and then all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dogs have to just deal with her.</v>

2556
01:51:14.830 --> 01:51:17.140
<v Speaker 3>So she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's the 100 percent.</v>

2557
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:19.900
<v Speaker 3>She pushes him out of the way she </v>
<v Speaker 3>decides when they eat.</v>

2558
01:51:20.050 --> 01:51:22.390
<v Speaker 3>She makes them sleep and pens like she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she.</v>

2559
01:51:22.630 --> 01:51:23.710
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2560
01:51:23.740 --> 01:51:25.810
<v Speaker 3>She gives them rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2561
01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:27.880
<v Speaker 3>Still a lot of structured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty gangster.</v>

2562
01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:29.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's uh,</v>

2563
01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:31.300
<v Speaker 3>she's not want to be mothered in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2564
01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:34.570
<v Speaker 3>You get your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get your dogs.</v>

2565
01:51:34.690 --> 01:51:35.800
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not people.</v>

2566
01:51:35.801 --> 01:51:40.801
<v Speaker 3>And we attached these human </v>
<v Speaker 3>characteristics and needs to them and </v>

2567
01:51:40.801 --> 01:51:40.801
<v Speaker 3>that's not what they want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they want.</v>

2568
01:51:40.801 --> 01:51:44.941
<v Speaker 3>It's order and they want you to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want love and a lot of affection </v>

2569
01:51:44.941 --> 01:51:46.300
<v Speaker 3>and they want exercise and all those </v>
<v Speaker 3>other great things in good food.</v>

2570
01:51:46.420 --> 01:51:48.640
<v Speaker 3>But they also want order and her order </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2571
01:51:48.670 --> 01:51:50.520
<v Speaker 3>she's the fucking boss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's the boss.</v>

2572
01:51:50.530 --> 01:51:52.210
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It totally makes sense.</v>

2573
01:51:52.211 --> 01:51:54.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's read a shitload of books on it.</v>

2574
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:58.120
<v Speaker 3>I've read a couple books like way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way back in the day on dogs.</v>

2575
01:51:58.121 --> 01:52:00.010
<v Speaker 3>I read some books on dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know enough.</v>

2576
01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:05.070
<v Speaker 3>All my information species picked up </v>
<v Speaker 3>from fucking vets and also probably a </v>

2577
01:52:05.070 --> 01:52:07.900
<v Speaker 3>lot of theories that I stitched together</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me to project onto the animals,</v>

2578
01:52:07.901 --> 01:52:10.540
<v Speaker 3>like fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you give your dogs boys and shit like</v>

2579
01:52:10.541 --> 01:52:11.350
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Voices?</v>

<v Speaker 3>him in my world.</v>

2587
01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:30.460
<v Speaker 3>The little doctrine calls me the man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't know my name.</v>

2588
01:52:30.461 --> 01:52:33.520
<v Speaker 3>She just knows me as the man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She knows my wife has that lady,</v>

2589
01:52:33.970 --> 01:52:34.790
<v Speaker 3>so she's always there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sick</v>

<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I love the man.</v>

2592
01:52:37.410 --> 01:52:40.900
<v Speaker 4>He's the pits and food because I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how they view me.</v>

2593
01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:44.520
<v Speaker 4>Did they view me as an Alpha because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy that's like,</v>

2594
01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:45.780
<v Speaker 4>I'll take you out a walk.</v>

2596
01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.860
<v Speaker 3>intimidating if you had to fight to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>death,</v>

2597
01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:55.460
<v Speaker 3>but they don't see me like that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've never even seen me be mad,</v>

2598
01:52:55.461 --> 01:53:00.461
<v Speaker 3>but I'm always like to hear your voice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a fight with my wife and like </v>

2600
01:53:03.561 --> 01:53:06.410
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that you have a deep voice </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean that it,</v>

2601
01:53:06.590 --> 01:53:10.220
<v Speaker 3>that it shows your mail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's enough for them to.</v>

<v Speaker 3>13 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over 13 years.</v>

<v Speaker 3>This little dog knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I got him wrapped around my finger.</v>

<v Speaker 3>right next to you with is fucking crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he talked to that dog.</v>

2609
01:53:29.540 --> 01:53:31.390
<v Speaker 3>That dog would listen to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:32.240
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be like,</v>

2614
01:53:36.291 --> 01:53:41.291
<v Speaker 3>No doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a way bigger organism than that </v>

2615
01:53:41.291 --> 01:53:41.291
<v Speaker 3>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2616
01:53:41.291 --> 01:53:42.320
<v Speaker 3>And it's talking with his deep voice and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has confidence.</v>

2617
01:53:42.321 --> 01:53:42.850
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>

2618
01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:44.970
<v Speaker 3>whatever you need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to lay down right here,</v>

2619
01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:49.870
<v Speaker 3>but if you were like some little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's that fella like?</v>

2620
01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:52.580
<v Speaker 3>Give me a small person's name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her villa.</v>

2621
01:53:52.590 --> 01:53:54.110
<v Speaker 3>Shay's the no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2622

<v Speaker 3>I meant like very thin wispy Tony.</v>

2623
01:53:58.100 --> 01:53:59.990

<v Speaker 3>Well Tony Hinchcliffe.</v>

2624
01:53:59.991 --> 01:54:03.410
<v Speaker 3>So when Tony was 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say that and he tried to,</v>

2625
01:54:03.411 --> 01:54:06.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to the same dog in the same room.</v>

2626
01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:09.260
<v Speaker 3>The dog would be like dismissive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like something used to Lebron James.</v>

2627
01:54:09.261 --> 01:54:11.940
<v Speaker 3>Give me directions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have called that a boy's,</v>

<v Speaker 3>he'll you call that timber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might be able to eat,</v>

2629
01:54:14.121 --> 01:54:17.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think like with Whitney's case,</v>

01:54:17.211 --> 01:54:20.180
<v Speaker 3>she doesn't leave any room for any gray </v>
<v Speaker 3>area.</v>

2631
01:54:20.210 --> 01:54:23.770
<v Speaker 3>She just runs the roost but she's super </v>
<v Speaker 3>affectionate with her daughter.</v>

2632
01:54:23.771 --> 01:54:26.560
<v Speaker 3>So all these pictures on instagram or </v>
<v Speaker 3>her cuddling with her dog.</v>

2633
01:54:26.561 --> 01:54:28.220
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she clearly loves dogs,</v>

2634
01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:31.100
<v Speaker 3>but she's cage to the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

2635
01:54:31.130 --> 01:54:36.130
<v Speaker 3>how to take care of your fucking cage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people sleep with their dogs and </v>

2636
01:54:36.130 --> 01:54:36.130
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is cool,</v>

2637
01:54:36.130 --> 01:54:38.930
<v Speaker 3>but the dogs are farting in your face </v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff and you're trying to sleep and</v>

2638
01:54:38.931 --> 01:54:41.810
<v Speaker 3>they're snoring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're losing sleep for a dog.</v>

2639
01:54:42.070 --> 01:54:45.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's the move bro.</v>

2640
01:54:45.501 --> 01:54:47.590
<v Speaker 3>You literally cried about a puppy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

2641
01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:52.640
<v Speaker 3>but now you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell me like I draw a lot of dog farts </v>

2642

<v Speaker 3>on care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll fucking cute to have your own bed.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm in here.</v>

2645
01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:59.690
<v Speaker 3>Let me call me boo with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take their dog shit smeared.</v>

2646
01:54:59.690 --> 01:55:03.360
<v Speaker 3>Pause and rub your sheets with them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>touch your pillow.</v>

2647
01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:05.660
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the fleet part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal.</v>

2648
01:55:05.661 --> 01:55:07.310
<v Speaker 3>That's why they don't sleep in the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

2649
01:55:07.311 --> 01:55:10.600
<v Speaker 3>This is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sleep in the bed with the dog.</v>

2650
01:55:10.630 --> 01:55:12.680
<v Speaker 3>She got very short hair too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was in high school,</v>

2651
01:55:12.681 --> 01:55:15.710
<v Speaker 3>my dog had fleas real bad and I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>fleas in my carpet.</v>

2652
01:55:15.711 --> 01:55:17.180
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking rough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2653
01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:21.980
<v Speaker 3>I would go through the house and I would</v>
<v Speaker 3>find fleas on my calves like in the walk</v>

2654
01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:25.550
<v Speaker 3>on my carpet from my bed to the bathroom</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the hallway.</v>

2655
01:55:25.551 --> 01:55:30.551
<v Speaker 3>I would have fleas on my leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I lived with my parents in New </v>

2656
01:55:30.551 --> 01:55:31.760
<v Speaker 3>Jersey at 21 Jackson Street,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were kept people.</v>

2657
01:55:31.790 --> 01:55:33.920
<v Speaker 3>He turned out flea me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Motherfuckers in here comes,</v>

2658
01:55:33.921 --> 01:55:37.190
<v Speaker 3>watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am about to pull out my dick and throw</v>

2659
01:55:37.191 --> 01:55:41.960
<v Speaker 3>it on the table against your own fleet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had cats and the cats,</v>

2660
01:55:41.961 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them are outside so they would </v>
<v Speaker 3>come in with</v>

2661
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:46.140
<v Speaker 1>fleas and we'd never had pets when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a small child.</v>

2662
01:55:46.141 --> 01:55:47.940
<v Speaker 1>We didn't start getting cats in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

2663
01:55:47.941 --> 01:55:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Tell us about 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>13 or something.</v>

2664
01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:54.150
<v Speaker 1>So my mom like having no prior </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience with cats and stuff.</v>

2665
01:55:54.151 --> 01:55:57.300
<v Speaker 1>Decided that like the flea problems are </v>
<v Speaker 1>too much.</v>

2666
01:55:57.301 --> 01:55:59.580
<v Speaker 1>We have to give the cats baths with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2667
01:55:59.581 --> 01:56:02.400
<v Speaker 1>fucking flee shampoo and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd do that.</v>

2668
01:56:02.401 --> 01:56:05.540
<v Speaker 1>And cats don't like to be anywhere near </v>
<v Speaker 1>water and shit.</v>

2669
01:56:05.541 --> 01:56:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Like oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was terrible.</v>

2670
01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Get scratched up while I know because my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother also insisted that I clipped the </v>

2671
01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:15.861
<v Speaker 1>cat's toenails first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wanted them like declawed and I was </v>

2672
01:56:15.861 --> 01:56:15.861
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>

2673
01:56:15.861 --> 01:56:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cats need their fucking clause in nature</v>

2674
01:56:16.561 --> 01:56:17.520
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

2675
01:56:17.521 --> 01:56:19.320
<v Speaker 1>well you have to clip the cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kona toe nails.</v>

2676
01:56:19.321 --> 01:56:21.490
<v Speaker 1>They do that at the vet all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

2677
01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:23.480
<v Speaker 1>you take off the hooky point part man.</v>

2678
01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:25.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you don't like that,</v>

2679
01:56:25.410 --> 01:56:27.450
<v Speaker 1>they don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they like it better than if you took</v>

2680
01:56:27.451 --> 01:56:29.130
<v Speaker 1>the fucking clause out altogether and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2681
01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I used to bathe the cat and then when</v>

2682
01:56:33.031 --> 01:56:38.031
<v Speaker 1>you bathed in the cat with flea shampoo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every fucking flee comes to the surface </v>

2683
01:56:38.850 --> 01:56:43.850
<v Speaker 1>to try to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they would fill the fucking sink </v>

2684
01:56:43.980 --> 01:56:48.980
<v Speaker 1>in the water and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dying in the water because the </v>

2685
01:56:48.980 --> 01:56:51.771
<v Speaker 1>shampoo is in the water as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my mom would always take it a step </v>

2686
01:56:51.771 --> 01:56:54.801
<v Speaker 1>further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She would give me a set of tweezers and </v>

2687
01:56:54.801 --> 01:56:56.050
<v Speaker 1>she would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get that one and I would fucking pull a,</v>

2688
01:56:56.170 --> 01:57:00.240
<v Speaker 1>a flea off the cat and you have to press</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fucking hard because they're kind</v>

2689
01:57:00.241 --> 01:57:05.241
<v Speaker 1>of flat to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise they just jump away and then </v>

2690
01:57:05.241 --> 01:57:05.241
<v Speaker 1>come back to the cat when it's dry.</v>

2691
01:57:05.241 --> 01:57:07.470
<v Speaker 1>That was like my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a set schedule.</v>

2692
01:57:07.471 --> 01:57:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Like every Tuesday night I made the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cats.</v>

2693
01:57:09.151 --> 01:57:11.700
<v Speaker 1>But once a week my mom would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to bathe the cats.</v>

2694
01:57:11.810 --> 01:57:15.180
<v Speaker 1>So once that included the fleeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you ever get rid of the fleas?</v>

2695
01:57:15.181 --> 01:57:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Never ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2696
01:57:16.261 --> 01:57:18.740
<v Speaker 1>what got rid of the fleas were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a storm.</v>

2697
01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:24.200
<v Speaker 1>They eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the Nor'easter of 92 on the east </v>

2698
01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:25.500
<v Speaker 1>coast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had this big storm,</v>

2699
01:57:25.501 --> 01:57:27.690
<v Speaker 1>like it was Kinda like a Hurricane </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sandy,</v>

2700
01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:32.840
<v Speaker 1>but though not as big and our town got </v>
<v Speaker 1>flooded including like our neighborhood </v>

2701
01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:34.740
<v Speaker 1>and we had like 30 outdoor cats that my </v>
<v Speaker 1>dad would feed.</v>

2702
01:57:35.130 --> 01:57:37.650
<v Speaker 1>We were finding those cats for like </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks after the flood.</v>

2703
01:57:37.651 --> 01:57:42.651
<v Speaker 1>People will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we found six of your cats under our </v>

2704
01:57:42.651 --> 01:57:42.651
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're like,</v>

2705
01:57:42.651 --> 01:57:42.651
<v Speaker 1>they're not our cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

2706
01:57:42.651 --> 01:57:46.290
<v Speaker 1>they arrive or drowned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dead Lot of these poor cats on fences.</v>

2707
01:57:47.730 --> 01:57:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Did I hit that maximum impact?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dead.</v>

2708
01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Very theatrical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2709
01:57:52.670 --> 01:57:55.530
<v Speaker 1>we found a few like holding on to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fences,</v>

2710
01:57:55.531 --> 01:57:56.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like escape.</v>

2711
01:57:56.941 --> 01:57:58.530
<v Speaker 1>The floodwaters was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>heartbreaking.</v>

2712
01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Smart ones went up and trees though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they stuck around and live.</v>

2713
01:58:01.350 --> 01:58:04.140
<v Speaker 1>But after that flood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no fleas whatsoever,</v>

2714
01:58:04.170 --> 01:58:07.770
<v Speaker 1>but not nearly as many cats either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might've helped Christ.</v>

2715
01:58:09.090 --> 01:58:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forever cat guy.</v>

2716
01:58:10.621 --> 01:58:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Or were you always a dog person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always had cats.</v>

2717
01:58:13.110 --> 01:58:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always had both.</v>

2718
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I really don't want to die at</v>

2719
01:58:18.601 --> 01:58:20.580
<v Speaker 1>the paws of a mountain cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2720
01:58:20.581 --> 01:58:23.360
<v Speaker 1>I just know what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nasty.</v>

2721
01:58:23.380 --> 01:58:28.380
<v Speaker 1>No fucking super predators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They catch deer with their face when </v>

2722
01:58:28.380 --> 01:58:29.140
<v Speaker 1>they killed deer with their face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2723
01:58:29.150 --> 01:58:31.670
<v Speaker 1>they use their face to kill a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2724
01:58:31.930 --> 01:58:34.470
<v Speaker 1>they bite it in the neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tackle it and take it down.</v>

2725
01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:37.770
<v Speaker 1>That's why mountain cats are scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're unbelievably powerful.</v>

2726
01:58:37.940 --> 01:58:41.650
<v Speaker 1>I had this Guy Donnie Vinson in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday's a outdoor maker,</v>

2727
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:46.300
<v Speaker 3>and he was talking about a cat that </v>
<v Speaker 3>these guys had hunted and killed.</v>

2728
01:58:46.450 --> 01:58:49.960
<v Speaker 3>They weighed 200 pounds and it was two </v>
<v Speaker 3>years old,</v>

2729
01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:53.590
<v Speaker 3>two years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and weigh 200 pounds.</v>

2730
01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:58.740
<v Speaker 3>It had been eating so many deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just that it was just this massive </v>

2731
01:58:59.060 --> 01:59:04.060
<v Speaker 3>jacked fucking Super Predator has just </v>
<v Speaker 3>roaming through the forest and ask those</v>

2732
01:59:04.421 --> 01:59:07.180
<v Speaker 3>guys in Seattle that survived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one guy that survived,</v>

2733
01:59:07.181 --> 01:59:12.181
<v Speaker 3>the one guy that died from that attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mountain bike attack are fucking </v>

2734
01:59:12.181 --> 01:59:13.780
<v Speaker 3>terrifying animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2735
01:59:13.781 --> 01:59:18.781
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so do you think they attack the people </v>

2736
01:59:18.781 --> 01:59:18.781
<v Speaker 3>just because they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're fucking hungry?</v>

2737
01:59:18.781 --> 01:59:22.860
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just always a macerated I think </v>

2738
01:59:22.860 --> 01:59:22.860
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tried to eat them.</v>

2739
01:59:22.860 --> 01:59:26.030
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was starving and so he knew that they</v>

2740
01:59:26.031 --> 01:59:31.031
<v Speaker 3>were an organism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There weren't a normal thing on the </v>

2741
01:59:31.031 --> 01:59:31.031
<v Speaker 3>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was so risky.</v>

2742
01:59:31.031 --> 01:59:34.420
<v Speaker 3>It was so rather I'm hungry that it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>willing to take those risks.</v>

2743
01:59:34.450 --> 01:59:39.450
<v Speaker 3>It was willing to go after some people </v>
<v Speaker 3>even though the people are swinging </v>

2744
01:59:39.450 --> 01:59:42.631
<v Speaker 3>their bike at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was part of the story that got </v>

2745
01:59:42.631 --> 01:59:43.870
<v Speaker 3>me the most because you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I would do.</v>

2746
01:59:43.871 --> 01:59:47.440
<v Speaker 3>I guess I would swing the bucket and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>would think this bike will save me,</v>

2747
01:59:47.441 --> 01:59:52.441
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it brings it back to my story about the </v>

2748
01:59:52.441 --> 01:59:52.441
<v Speaker 3>house cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I threw the blanket on him,</v>

2749
01:59:52.441 --> 01:59:53.200
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't believe how strong he was.</v>

2750
01:59:53.530 --> 01:59:56.170
<v Speaker 3>He was so strong because he was fighting</v>
<v Speaker 3>for his life.</v>

2751
01:59:56.171 --> 02:00:01.171
<v Speaker 3>He thought I was going to kill him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm trying to stuff them into this </v>

2752
02:00:01.171 --> 02:00:04.350
<v Speaker 3>laundry basket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going fucking crazy and all his </v>

2753
02:00:04.350 --> 02:00:06.700
<v Speaker 3>thinking is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is this cat weigh eight pounds,</v>

2754
02:00:07.060 --> 02:00:12.060
<v Speaker 3>like maybe eight pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking terrified of them to do is </v>

2755
02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:15.631
<v Speaker 3>catch a juggler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little more complicated than </v>

2756
02:00:15.631 --> 02:00:15.631
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it?</v>

2757
02:00:15.631 --> 02:00:15.631
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be hard.</v>

2758
02:00:15.631 --> 02:00:16.930
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put your hand on it.</v>

2759
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:19.900
<v Speaker 3>Stopped the bleeding and it's not going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to kill you like a lion kills you,</v>

2760
02:00:20.890 --> 02:00:23.710
<v Speaker 3>but what if it got both sets of clause?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2761
02:00:23.740 --> 02:00:26.650
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When a tiger claws onto your juggling.</v>

2762
02:00:27.070 --> 02:00:29.140
<v Speaker 3>Shredding it in so many different </v>
<v Speaker 3>directions.</v>

2763
02:00:29.141 --> 02:00:31.530
<v Speaker 3>Really it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's mostly give can be killed by.</v>

2764
02:00:31.820 --> 02:00:33.750
<v Speaker 3>She'll scratches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

2765
02:00:33.970 --> 02:00:36.530
<v Speaker 3>It's very rare that someone gets killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>by a house cat.</v>

2766
02:00:36.630 --> 02:00:37.090
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here.</v>

2767
02:00:37.091 --> 02:00:42.091
<v Speaker 3>Here's the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're fucking a house cat and it </v>

2768
02:00:42.091 --> 02:00:42.230
<v Speaker 3>reaches back and claws into your femoral</v>
<v Speaker 3>artery,</v>

2769
02:00:42.250 --> 02:00:44.450
<v Speaker 3>but you should let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a cat.</v>

2770
02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:50.040
<v Speaker 3>It's clearly not continually this point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clearly if you fought to the death with </v>

2771
02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:51.880
<v Speaker 3>a house cat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would bet on you you would win,</v>

2772
02:00:52.420 --> 02:00:54.280
<v Speaker 3>but it would be ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would be.</v>

2773
02:00:54.310 --> 02:00:56.860
<v Speaker 3>But what the force that you can generate</v>
<v Speaker 3>is lethal.</v>

2774
02:00:57.070 --> 02:00:59.530
<v Speaker 3>The force that it can generate is </v>
<v Speaker 3>ferocious,</v>

2775
02:00:59.740 --> 02:01:02.800
<v Speaker 3>but nonlethal like if you put me in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>room with a cat,</v>

2776
02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:06.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm coming out of that fucking room </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred percent of the time with a house</v>

2777
02:01:06.701 --> 02:01:08.020
<v Speaker 3>cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be dead.</v>

2778
02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:09.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to kill that cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2779
02:01:09.671 --> 02:01:11.720
<v Speaker 3>but it's gonna fuck me up in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>process,</v>

2780
02:01:11.740 --> 02:01:15.040
<v Speaker 3>so scratched up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have bloody hands.</v>

2781
02:01:15.041 --> 02:01:20.041
<v Speaker 3>I might get my face clawed up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to kill it as soon as I </v>

2782
02:01:20.041 --> 02:01:22.480
<v Speaker 3>think gets to half my size.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm dead.</v>

2783
02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:24.370
<v Speaker 3>Is that my size?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2784
02:01:24.580 --> 02:01:26.620
<v Speaker 3>Fit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not even one quarter of my size.</v>

2785
02:01:26.660 --> 02:01:31.540
<v Speaker 3>When I say it's a 50 pound cat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucked because it's too powerful.</v>

2786
02:01:31.930 --> 02:01:35.530
<v Speaker 3>Fifty pound cat is like 150 pound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>200 pound man.</v>

2787
02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:40.680
<v Speaker 3>Plus they have fangs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have claws that it would be much </v>

2788
02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:44.351
<v Speaker 3>stronger and faster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't be able to stop it from </v>

2789
02:01:44.351 --> 02:01:44.351
<v Speaker 3>biting you and clawing at you.</v>

2790
02:01:44.351 --> 02:01:46.010
<v Speaker 3>It would be too big and if you've got to</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 pounds,</v>

2791
02:01:46.130 --> 02:01:49.160
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it gets to 200 pounds,</v>

2792
02:01:49.250 --> 02:01:51.410
<v Speaker 3>your super dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dead quick.</v>

2793
02:01:51.411 --> 02:01:54.110
<v Speaker 3>It'll crush your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to grab a hold of your neck,</v>

2794
02:01:54.230 --> 02:01:56.660
<v Speaker 3>it's going to crush her esophagus </v>
<v Speaker 3>crusher,</v>

2795
02:01:56.720 --> 02:01:58.120
<v Speaker 3>windpipe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's going to.</v>

2796
02:01:58.220 --> 02:02:02.510
<v Speaker 3>It has sensors in its tafe like certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain big cats.</v>

2797
02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:06.620
<v Speaker 3>They can feel where your veins are with </v>
<v Speaker 3>their teeth,</v>

2798
02:02:06.770 --> 02:02:10.560
<v Speaker 3>their teeth have like a a sense where </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>

2799
02:02:11.300 --> 02:02:16.300
<v Speaker 3>you know how like you ever eat something</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you feel like a hard piece of </v>

2800
02:02:16.300 --> 02:02:20.951
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe you're eating a crab or </v>

2801
02:02:20.951 --> 02:02:20.951
<v Speaker 3>something like that little piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>shell gets in there.</v>

2802
02:02:20.951 --> 02:02:25.030
<v Speaker 3>You've got to move that shell around </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside your mouth while you're chewing </v>

2803
02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:28.960
<v Speaker 3>and you get the shell over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sense of moving your tongue and </v>

2804
02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:33.041
<v Speaker 3>knowing what that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That cat has a with a with a fan and </v>

2805
02:02:33.081 --> 02:02:38.081
<v Speaker 3>knows how to hit like an antelopes </v>
<v Speaker 3>juggled a lion when it bites into </v>

2806
02:02:38.081 --> 02:02:39.320
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so tell you where the blood is.</v>

2807
02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:41.460
<v Speaker 3>It feels where the veins are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think he does,</v>

2808
02:02:42.150 --> 02:02:43.700
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't want the blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2809
02:02:43.701 --> 02:02:46.490
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that if I break this thing,</v>

2810
02:02:46.491 --> 02:02:48.230
<v Speaker 3>this thing will stop moving and I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>eat it.</v>

2811
02:02:48.231 --> 02:02:51.620
<v Speaker 3>It's mostly cut off the air if you see </v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly what they do.</v>

2812
02:02:51.621 --> 02:02:54.260
<v Speaker 3>Mostly what they do is crush the neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They there.</v>

2813
02:02:54.290 --> 02:02:58.550
<v Speaker 3>It's more of that than it is like cut </v>
<v Speaker 3>you like a knife would cut your juggler.</v>

2814
02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:00.710
<v Speaker 3>It's mostly crushing everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Few.</v>

2815
02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:05.800
<v Speaker 3>If you had the presence of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like let's say this thing is crushing </v>

2816
02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:08.891
<v Speaker 3>your windpipe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you reach up and choke a cat to </v>

2817
02:03:08.891 --> 02:03:08.891
<v Speaker 3>death?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

2818
02:03:08.891 --> 02:03:09.440
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think they're too strong.</v>

2819
02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:10.820
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean straws?</v>

2820
02:03:10.910 --> 02:03:15.910
<v Speaker 3>They're too strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So would it be swarmed at you or </v>

2821
02:03:15.910 --> 02:03:16.580
<v Speaker 3>something or too much?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muscle or muscle?</v>

2822
02:03:16.581 --> 02:03:18.770
<v Speaker 3>Both of you put your fingers in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes.</v>

2823
02:03:18.890 --> 02:03:22.520
<v Speaker 3>That would be one of the only things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I could think might have an effect,</v>

2824
02:03:22.521 --> 02:03:24.590
<v Speaker 3>but it would probably just be a second </v>
<v Speaker 3>one as the second one.</v>

2825
02:03:24.830 --> 02:03:27.020
<v Speaker 3>You Jam your finger up the cat's ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instantly.</v>

2826
02:03:27.021 --> 02:03:30.320
<v Speaker 3>It stops their son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How are you going to get way back down?</v>

2827
02:03:31.650 --> 02:03:34.600
<v Speaker 3>That's what I do with my last few </v>
<v Speaker 3>breaths,</v>

2828
02:03:34.610 --> 02:03:35.390
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>

2829
02:03:35.391 --> 02:03:38.720
<v Speaker 3>A few feet away and you same way that </v>
<v Speaker 3>little kitten was attacking you.</v>

2830
02:03:38.721 --> 02:03:42.470
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm a fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would leave this life and the mouth of</v>

2831
02:03:42.471 --> 02:03:47.471
<v Speaker 3>a big cat with my fingers up its ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would know that I was there before I </v>

2832
02:03:47.471 --> 02:03:50.240
<v Speaker 3>left this fucking world because if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>stick your finger up a dog's ass,</v>

2833
02:03:50.270 --> 02:03:52.130
<v Speaker 3>it breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's concentration doesn't.</v>

2834
02:03:52.190 --> 02:03:52.850
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2835
02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:55.250
<v Speaker 3>That's an old wives' tale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know you ever see two pit bulls fighting</v>

2836
02:03:55.251 --> 02:03:56.750
<v Speaker 3>each other?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stick your finger up their ass.</v>

2837
02:03:56.750 --> 02:03:59.870
<v Speaker 3>Watch what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're holding your finger in the ass,</v>

2838
02:03:59.871 --> 02:04:02.120
<v Speaker 3>but dogs biting another dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's happening.</v>

2839
02:04:02.180 --> 02:04:03.230
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't do shit.</v>

2840
02:04:03.250 --> 02:04:05.480
<v Speaker 3>They want each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always read that.</v>

2841
02:04:05.481 --> 02:04:10.481
<v Speaker 3>If you stick your finger up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dogs ass instantly stopped what it's </v>

2842
02:04:10.481 --> 02:04:13.090
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you've got a bitch ass dog that </v>

2843
02:04:13.090 --> 02:04:15.191
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have to help drive it ain't the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dog and you.</v>

2844
02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:18.080
<v Speaker 3>There are certain dogs that are going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hang on.</v>

2845
02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:23.200
<v Speaker 3>They're just going to hang on and you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can pick holes in the presence of </v>

2846
02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:23.510
<v Speaker 3>mind to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know your fingers in my ass,</v>

2847
02:04:23.511 --> 02:04:26.030
<v Speaker 3>but biting this other dog is the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>important thing in the world.</v>

2848
02:04:26.031 --> 02:04:27.880
<v Speaker 3>They're driven because you want to pick </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2849
02:04:27.881 --> 02:04:30.920
<v Speaker 3>They're very driven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your cat may want to kill you.</v>

2850
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:35.950
<v Speaker 3>Study says that in a heartbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that they would absolutely </v>

2851
02:04:35.950 --> 02:04:37.950
<v Speaker 3>kill you if you are big enough or if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're big enough.</v>

2852
02:04:37.950 --> 02:04:39.900
<v Speaker 3>Rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the photo that she was doing.</v>

2853
02:04:39.901 --> 02:04:42.510
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent would kill you if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they could as the joker of cats.</v>

2854
02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:43.200
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cat?</v>

2855
02:04:43.230 --> 02:04:43.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>

2856
02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:46.320
<v Speaker 3>If you were the size of the cat and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cat was the size of you,</v>

2857
02:04:46.321 --> 02:04:48.330
<v Speaker 3>you'd be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honest percent.</v>

2858
02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:49.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent.</v>

2859
02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:51.210
<v Speaker 3>What have you were his friend from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning?</v>

2860
02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:56.680
<v Speaker 3>They don't have friends like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if I have a joke in my act about </v>

2861
02:04:56.680 --> 02:04:59.631
<v Speaker 3>how you could have a dog and have a pet </v>
<v Speaker 3>hamster and that hamster could live a </v>

2862
02:04:59.631 --> 02:05:01.930
<v Speaker 3>long and healthy life in the same house </v>
<v Speaker 3>running around.</v>

2863
02:05:02.030 --> 02:05:04.050
<v Speaker 3>If you've got a good dog and you train </v>
<v Speaker 3>that dog,</v>

2864
02:05:04.260 --> 02:05:07.380
<v Speaker 3>if you got a cat that lives in a house </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a hamster on the hamster,</v>

2865
02:05:07.381 --> 02:05:11.310
<v Speaker 3>has an hour to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's lucky,</v>

2866
02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:16.760
<v Speaker 3>there's no such thing as a cat at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also has a pet hamster that's a dead </v>

2867
02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:16.760
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>

2868
02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:17.820
<v Speaker 3>Next to that cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They kill everything.</v>

2869
02:05:17.970 --> 02:05:20.670
<v Speaker 3>Everything they can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>canaries lizards,</v>

2870
02:05:20.730 --> 02:05:23.430
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck you leave around that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can kill.</v>

2871
02:05:23.431 --> 02:05:24.960
<v Speaker 3>That's what they like to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like to kill Shit.</v>

2872
02:05:24.990 --> 02:05:26.720
<v Speaker 3>Why do we have this relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 3>them then?</v>

2873
02:05:26.730 --> 02:05:30.210
<v Speaker 3>Because they are small and like bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the bitches to the cats,</v>

2874
02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:32.400
<v Speaker 3>we feed them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We give them free massages.</v>

2875
02:05:32.401 --> 02:05:35.320
<v Speaker 3>They don't do anything for us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All they do is curl up to you and go and</v>

2876
02:05:35.350 --> 02:05:38.030
<v Speaker 3>willing you to touch me and you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do a view to.</v>

2877
02:05:38.260 --> 02:05:40.340
<v Speaker 3>He didn't say he loves you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you die,</v>

2878
02:05:40.341 --> 02:05:42.030
<v Speaker 3>the first thing that happens to you when</v>
<v Speaker 3>he dies,</v>

2879
02:05:42.031 --> 02:05:43.680
<v Speaker 3>the cats eat your face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that true?</v>

2880
02:05:43.690 --> 02:05:44.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get hungry.</v>

2881
02:05:44.281 --> 02:05:46.370
<v Speaker 3>They start eating your lips if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't get to anything.</v>

2882
02:05:46.380 --> 02:05:48.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that find dead bodies.</v>

2883
02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:53.240
<v Speaker 3>What does the sun nearly killed by a </v>
<v Speaker 3>stray cat left covered in blood because </v>

2884
02:05:53.240 --> 02:05:54.670
<v Speaker 3>cats are mean and all an honest.</v>

2885
02:05:54.670 --> 02:05:56.430
<v Speaker 3>I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait a second.</v>

2886
02:05:56.490 --> 02:05:57.870
<v Speaker 3>Wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go back to what we said before.</v>

2887
02:05:57.880 --> 02:06:00.590
<v Speaker 3>We've read that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um.</v>

2888
02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:01.710
<v Speaker 3>Which part?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2889
02:06:01.711 --> 02:06:04.470
<v Speaker 3>The thing you just said it was shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2890
02:06:04.471 --> 02:06:08.730
<v Speaker 3>you totally took my head out the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was about the fuck,</v>

2891
02:06:08.820 --> 02:06:11.850
<v Speaker 3>it was just about the dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cow,</v>

2892
02:06:11.980 --> 02:06:14.580
<v Speaker 3>the cat was as big as me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cat would get 100 percent.</v>

2893
02:06:14.820 --> 02:06:16.760
<v Speaker 3>You have a cat was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what about a dog?</v>

2894
02:06:16.761 --> 02:06:20.040
<v Speaker 3>If a dog was as big as dogs can be giant</v>
<v Speaker 3>and still be your friend.</v>

2895
02:06:20.220 --> 02:06:25.220
<v Speaker 3>That's why a woman could be like 90 </v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds and have a 200 pound mastiff and </v>

2896
02:06:25.220 --> 02:06:29.541
<v Speaker 3>that dog will totally listened to her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She raised that door from the time it </v>

2897
02:06:29.541 --> 02:06:32.691
<v Speaker 3>was a puppy and she can ride it like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Khaleesi Roger Track it if she wanted </v>

2898
02:06:32.691 --> 02:06:32.691
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

2899
02:06:32.691 --> 02:06:35.040
<v Speaker 3>But that doctor listened to her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have a cat that big,</v>

2900
02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:40.220
<v Speaker 3>like you better hope that that cat just </v>
<v Speaker 3>decides to not kill you because one day </v>

2901
02:06:40.220 --> 02:06:42.090
<v Speaker 3>it might just get bored and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>planning ahead.</v>

2902
02:06:42.290 --> 02:06:44.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not like investment bankers.</v>

2903
02:06:44.460 --> 02:06:46.260
<v Speaker 3>They just don't like the way you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving one day,</v>

2904
02:06:46.261 --> 02:06:48.570
<v Speaker 3>just jump on you and just fuck you up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and kill you.</v>

2905
02:06:48.660 --> 02:06:51.480
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been hit by cats like,</v>

2906
02:06:51.540 --> 02:06:53.820
<v Speaker 3>not like in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like you're sitting there and all of</v>

2907
02:06:53.821 --> 02:06:54.890
<v Speaker 3>a sudden they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2908
02:06:55.070 --> 02:06:55.630
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good reason,</v>

2909
02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:58.380
<v Speaker 3>so if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that cat was eight times its size,</v>

2910
02:06:58.620 --> 02:07:00.420
<v Speaker 3>did you see that video of the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a,</v>

2911
02:07:00.421 --> 02:07:05.421
<v Speaker 3>a long time animal trainer and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>trained Lyons and he trained this line </v>

2912
02:07:05.421 --> 02:07:09.060
<v Speaker 3>for like 10 years and he's in the pen </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the thing and the thing just looked</v>

2913
02:07:09.061 --> 02:07:10.860
<v Speaker 3>at him funny and the guy starts backing </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

2914
02:07:10.861 --> 02:07:11.430
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

2915
02:07:11.431 --> 02:07:15.750
<v Speaker 3>when he runs and this line just chases </v>
<v Speaker 3>after this motherfucker grabs him by the</v>

2916
02:07:15.751 --> 02:07:19.560
<v Speaker 3>head and drags him around and apparently</v>
<v Speaker 3>he survived the lion,</v>

2917
02:07:19.561 --> 02:07:24.561
<v Speaker 3>let them go and somehow know that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>got the line away from him and got the </v>

2918
02:07:24.561 --> 02:07:24.630
<v Speaker 3>guy to a hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was an older guy,</v>

2919
02:07:24.810 --> 02:07:29.810
<v Speaker 3>I want to say he was deep into his </v>
<v Speaker 3>sixties and his line was dragging him </v>

2920
02:07:29.810 --> 02:07:33.501
<v Speaker 3>around by his fucking head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is a line that he had trained </v>

2921
02:07:33.501 --> 02:07:33.501
<v Speaker 3>in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened to,</v>

2922

<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's her name?</v>

<v Speaker 3>the photos.</v>

2945
02:08:25.790 --> 02:08:27.440
<v Speaker 3>It's so preposterous.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You imagine if you were a burglar and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you broke into that fucking house.</v>

2950
02:08:37.250 --> 02:08:39.080
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a mistake.</v>

2951
02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:44.520
<v Speaker 3>I imagine you break into a house and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>see a 600 pound African male lion just </v>

2952
02:08:44.601 --> 02:08:46.940
<v Speaker 3>looking at you with that gigantic head </v>
<v Speaker 3>of death.</v>

2953
02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:48.620
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man.</v>

2954
02:08:48.630 --> 02:08:53.250
<v Speaker 1>The bizarre tale of Melanie Griffith and</v>
<v Speaker 1>her pet lion did they talk about the</v>

2955
02:08:53.770 --> 02:08:58.770
<v Speaker 3>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but look at her spitting water into the </v>

2956
02:08:58.981 --> 02:09:00.840
<v Speaker 3>big cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one in the family was ever injured by</v>

2957
02:09:00.841 --> 02:09:03.690
<v Speaker 3>the lion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one will buy that line by that one.</v>

2958
02:09:03.860 --> 02:09:07.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh my neil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Neil certainly could have killed any</v>

2959
02:09:07.561 --> 02:09:11.070
<v Speaker 3>of them at a moments notice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At one point he did attack Ron Oxley,</v>

2960
02:09:11.071 --> 02:09:13.380
<v Speaker 3>his owner during a dinner party at his </v>
<v Speaker 3>home.</v>

2961
02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:15.390
<v Speaker 3>Fuck all of that.</v>

2962
02:09:15.610 --> 02:09:18.310
<v Speaker 1>After Neil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the family went on to adopt numerous big</v>

2963
02:09:18.311 --> 02:09:20.860
<v Speaker 1>cats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's resulted in a series of serious</v>

2964
02:09:20.861 --> 02:09:23.260
<v Speaker 1>injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty seven years old,</v>

2965
02:09:23.261 --> 02:09:26.680
<v Speaker 1>melanie has learned from the experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>and runs a sanctuary.</v>

2966
02:09:27.910 --> 02:09:30.700
<v Speaker 3>She finds a sanctuary for 32 big cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2967
02:09:30.701 --> 02:09:34.390
<v Speaker 3>Look at that thing on the desk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is so insane.</v>

2968
02:09:34.750 --> 02:09:37.180
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does that thing need exercise?</v>

2969
02:09:37.181 --> 02:09:39.780
<v Speaker 3>Just to keep it shit together?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at the size of that fucker.</v>

2970
02:09:39.790 --> 02:09:41.330
<v Speaker 3>How much you think you got to feed that </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy?</v>

2971
02:09:41.380 --> 02:09:43.360
<v Speaker 3>A lot dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And only meat.</v>

2972
02:09:43.860 --> 02:09:45.700
<v Speaker 3>They are obligate carnivores,</v>

2973
02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:51.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not like a dog looking at how </v>

2974
02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:51.720
<v Speaker 1>tall he is in the fridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huge animal man.</v>

2975
02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:53.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's the point where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not working here anymore.</v>

2976
02:09:53.780 --> 02:09:58.780
<v Speaker 1>It's just laying around their house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the fucking muscles on that </v>

2977
02:09:58.780 --> 02:09:59.930
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you think they're like cats?</v>

2978
02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Like will they only shit where they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to?</v>

2979
02:10:02.001 --> 02:10:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Shit a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit's wants.</v>

2980
02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2981
02:10:05.130 --> 02:10:08.820
<v Speaker 3>The thing about the size of this cat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is crazy.</v>

2982
02:10:09.090 --> 02:10:11.250
<v Speaker 3>It's so big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

2983
02:10:11.280 --> 02:10:16.280
<v Speaker 3>It must be a thrill to be around </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that could just kill you at </v>

2984
02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:19.611
<v Speaker 3>any moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And apparently lions in particular are </v>

2985
02:10:19.611 --> 02:10:20.820
<v Speaker 3>pretty cool with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2986
02:10:20.821 --> 02:10:25.821
<v Speaker 3>That's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're playing the lion hazard by the </v>

2987
02:10:25.821 --> 02:10:28.281
<v Speaker 3>leg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's jumping into the pool and some </v>

2988
02:10:28.281 --> 02:10:28.281
<v Speaker 3>fake biting her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck all of that.</v>

2989
02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Everything about that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put that on a tee shirt with those words</v>

2990
02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:34.520
<v Speaker 3>at her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were friends,</v>

2991
02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:36.050
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were buddies at a young.</v>

2992
02:10:36.051 --> 02:10:37.070
<v Speaker 2>She looked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she looks,</v>

2993
02:10:37.130 --> 02:10:39.410
<v Speaker 2>she's a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's in her teens at this point.</v>

2994
02:10:39.411 --> 02:10:39.840
<v Speaker 2>She has a</v>

2995
02:10:39.900 --> 02:10:44.010
<v Speaker 3>giant line in our yard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go find the cooler.</v>

2996
02:10:44.011 --> 02:10:47.610
<v Speaker 3>Was there apparently than tigers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tigers are a little sketchier.</v>

2997
02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:53.280
<v Speaker 3>There's a little sketchier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like you'd have an easier time Tony </v>

2998
02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:53.930
<v Speaker 3>Alliance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we would have done that.</v>

2999
02:10:54.060 --> 02:10:54.870
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>

3000
02:10:54.930 --> 02:10:59.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking way out of school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I believe is the case is that </v>

3001
02:10:59.930 --> 02:11:03.030
<v Speaker 3>male lions are mostly there to protect </v>
<v Speaker 3>the pride.</v>

3002
02:11:03.420 --> 02:11:06.240
<v Speaker 3>They're mostly there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're not the hundreds right there.</v>

3003
02:11:06.241 --> 02:11:08.400
<v Speaker 3>The bigger ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the females do all the hunting.</v>

3004
02:11:08.430 --> 02:11:12.150
<v Speaker 3>What are the size of that female.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

3005
02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:14.970
<v Speaker 3>What's going on there in the movie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's attacking her in the movie.</v>

3006
02:11:14.971 --> 02:11:15.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I mean.</v>

3007
02:11:15.661 --> 02:11:18.180
<v Speaker 3>That's what the link was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This close call below.</v>

3008
02:11:21.530 --> 02:11:24.920
<v Speaker 3>So it's biting her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got her mouth around the ribs.</v>

3009
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:27.500
<v Speaker 3>Is it actually hurting her?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't look happy.</v>

3010
02:11:29.620 --> 02:11:31.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm not showing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3011
02:11:31.090 --> 02:11:32.650
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

3012
02:11:32.830 --> 02:11:34.660
<v Speaker 3>This is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this was in the movie.</v>

3013
02:11:34.661 --> 02:11:36.820
<v Speaker 3>They were freaking out to the line was </v>
<v Speaker 3>biting somebody.</v>

3014
02:11:37.260 --> 02:11:39.010
<v Speaker 3>It says the father refused to yell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cut.</v>

3015
02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:43.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

3016
02:11:43.420 --> 02:11:45.250
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Blood was drawn and the lion grabbed her</v>

3017
02:11:45.251 --> 02:11:48.070
<v Speaker 3>hair and pulled her back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the line was just fucking with her.</v>

3018
02:11:48.130 --> 02:11:50.830
<v Speaker 3>But he is dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was once Claude,</v>

3019
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:55.870
<v Speaker 3>the face during that filming that </v>
<v Speaker 3>required required reconstructive </v>

3020
02:11:55.870 --> 02:11:55.870
<v Speaker 3>surgery.</v>

3021
02:11:55.870 --> 02:11:56.210
<v Speaker 2>Ge Story that I'd heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was clogged</v>

3022
02:11:57.500 --> 02:12:02.500
<v Speaker 3>more responsible and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's several lines in this house and </v>

3023
02:12:02.500 --> 02:12:04.200
<v Speaker 3>it's not just one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the lions who's there,</v>

3024
02:12:04.690 --> 02:12:06.200
<v Speaker 3>the lines are just running shit.</v>

3025
02:12:06.700 --> 02:12:11.700
<v Speaker 2>And I think they picked them and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were lines that came from like </v>

3026
02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:11.700
<v Speaker 2>surfaces and shit.</v>

3027
02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:15.560
<v Speaker 3>$17,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the movie and it brought back to a </v>

3028
02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:15.560
<v Speaker 3>bargain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roar.</v>

3029
02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:15.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3030
02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.040
<v Speaker 2>After this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get ready for another 50 bucks.</v>

3031
02:12:19.370 --> 02:12:21.800

3033
02:12:24.101 --> 02:12:26.410
<v Speaker 2>Million dollars in 1971.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3034
02:12:26.470 --> 02:12:28.010
<v Speaker 2>This is a nice way to learn to cocaine </v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

3035
02:12:28.011 --> 02:12:29.290
<v Speaker 2>son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's going on there.</v>

3036
02:12:29.380 --> 02:12:30.700
<v Speaker 2>What is that today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like $80.</v>

3037
02:12:30.701 --> 02:12:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Million Dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Billion.</v>

3038
02:12:32.030 --> 02:12:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Trillion.</v>

3039
02:12:34.250 --> 02:12:37.720
<v Speaker 3>The what I was saying was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what happens is that lions,</v>

3040
02:12:37.721 --> 02:12:42.721
<v Speaker 3>the male lions don't hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They usually just eat the kill that the </v>

3041
02:12:42.721 --> 02:12:43.180
<v Speaker 3>female lions hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

3042
02:12:43.190 --> 02:12:45.160
<v Speaker 3>they're doing all the hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But with tigers,</v>

3043
02:12:45.161 --> 02:12:47.980
<v Speaker 3>the male lions hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're all hunt and they don't,</v>

3044
02:12:48.070 --> 02:12:50.110
<v Speaker 3>they don't operate in packs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3045
02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:52.300
<v Speaker 3>they're not independent than rogue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3046
02:12:52.301 --> 02:12:53.200
<v Speaker 3>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>

3047
02:12:53.230 --> 02:12:56.170
<v Speaker 3>They don't operate the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lions who don't have a pride,</v>

3048
02:12:56.440 --> 02:12:57.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll take.</v>

3049
02:12:57.160 --> 02:12:59.440
<v Speaker 3>I think tigers are pretty much on their </v>
<v Speaker 3>own know.</v>

3050
02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:01.870
<v Speaker 3>I think the females take care of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cubs as long as they can,</v>

3051
02:13:01.871 --> 02:13:05.530
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think they have these big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could be wrong,</v>

3052
02:13:05.550 --> 02:13:10.550
<v Speaker 3>find out if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think tigers operate in </v>

3053
02:13:10.550 --> 02:13:11.470
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that kind of a group</v>

3054
02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:17.560
<v Speaker 2>in a world where like I've got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>miniature doctrine that means that </v>

3055
02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:17.560
<v Speaker 2>somebody's genetically made that dog </v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller.</v>

3056
02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3057
02:13:18.711 --> 02:13:21.890
<v Speaker 2>when you say genetically they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it through a laboratory,</v>

3058
02:13:21.891 --> 02:13:25.850
<v Speaker 2>they're doing it through selective </v>
<v Speaker 2>breeding and it's remarkably effective.</v>

3059
02:13:25.910 --> 02:13:28.520
<v Speaker 2>And then you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just needed that to get to this point.</v>

3060
02:13:28.521 --> 02:13:31.080
<v Speaker 2>Can you do that with a tiger baby tiger?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3061
02:13:31.150 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 2>So could you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

3062
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:37.070
<v Speaker 3>what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All house cats have come from some kind </v>

3063
02:13:37.070 --> 02:13:39.390
<v Speaker 3>of wild cat that we turned into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>domestic cat.</v>

3064
02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:42.210
<v Speaker 3>And there's a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>varieties of cats,</v>

3065
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:47.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The difference between cats and dogs is </v>

3066
02:13:47.390 --> 02:13:48.030
<v Speaker 3>that all dogs come from wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of them.</v>

3067
02:13:48.230 --> 02:13:49.320
<v Speaker 3>Everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every dog,</v>

3068
02:13:49.380 --> 02:13:54.380
<v Speaker 3>every dog started as a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tigers did not live in permanent groups </v>

3069
02:13:54.380 --> 02:13:57.711
<v Speaker 3>like lions do for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They live solitary lives except when </v>

3070
02:13:57.711 --> 02:14:00.711
<v Speaker 3>females are raising cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although rarely seen the term for a </v>

3071
02:14:00.711 --> 02:14:02.490
<v Speaker 3>group of tigers is a streak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dope word.</v>

3072
02:14:03.300 --> 02:14:04.890
<v Speaker 3>Tigers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Murder of crows.</v>

<v Speaker 3>kid and now I can tell her mom if there </v>

3076

<v Speaker 3>of the film,</v>

3120
02:16:10.261 --> 02:16:15.261

<v Speaker 3>It has been considered the most </v>

02:18:42.270 --> 02:18:43.510
<v Speaker 3>Pretend to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the liquid.</v>

3180
02:18:43.700 --> 02:18:48.700
<v Speaker 3>Pretend I'm Mrs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like when the fuck do the antelope </v>

3181
02:18:48.700 --> 02:18:50.380
<v Speaker 3>show up so I could start jacking fools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you.</v>

3182
02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:56.880
<v Speaker 3>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you agree that since you do more </v>

3183
02:18:56.880 --> 02:18:57.340
<v Speaker 3>outdoors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the activity that may I running it,</v>

3184
02:18:57.460 --> 02:19:02.460
<v Speaker 3>you've gone hunting and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your chances of being eaten alive are </v>

3185
02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:04.600
<v Speaker 3>far greater than mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

3186
02:19:04.630 --> 02:19:07.060
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like surfers.</v>

3187
02:19:07.510 --> 02:19:11.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a zero percent chance in most of </v>
<v Speaker 3>my life of getting eaten by a shark,</v>

3188
02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:17.400
<v Speaker 3>but I have friends who are surfers who </v>
<v Speaker 3>surf all the time and they fucking love </v>

3189
02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:21.091
<v Speaker 3>it and they're willing to roll that dice</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they like surfing that much and </v>

3190
02:19:21.091 --> 02:19:21.091
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3191
02:19:21.091 --> 02:19:22.030
<v Speaker 3>you can't get bit by a shark if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't go in the ocean.</v>

3192
02:19:22.540 --> 02:19:27.540
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got this shark thing figured out </v>

3193
02:19:27.540 --> 02:19:27.540
<v Speaker 3>and defeated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just don't go in the ocean.</v>

3194
02:19:27.540 --> 02:19:27.890
<v Speaker 3>They say it's worth it.</v>

3195
02:19:28.370 --> 02:19:29.930
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3196
02:19:29.931 --> 02:19:34.931
<v Speaker 1>like there's a bunch of bad ways to die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I always felt like the most </v>

3197
02:19:35.541 --> 02:19:40.220
<v Speaker 1>indignity I would ever feel in death was</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was something else's food.</v>

3198
02:19:40.460 --> 02:19:44.390
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing if I'm like my body goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the earth and fucking the worms and</v>

3199
02:19:44.391 --> 02:19:49.391
<v Speaker 1>the grass and shit like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to be someone's fucking meal is so </v>

3200
02:19:50.060 --> 02:19:54.410
<v Speaker 1>it's a temporary or a permanent solution</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a temporary problem,</v>

3201
02:19:54.440 --> 02:19:59.440
<v Speaker 1>your life for their meal of the moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're just going to shoot you out </v>

3202
02:20:00.170 --> 02:20:05.170
<v Speaker 1>in a couple of hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I think it's hard for </v>

3203
02:20:05.170 --> 02:20:05.170
<v Speaker 1>humans get their head around being </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating my son because like,</v>

3204
02:20:05.170 --> 02:20:10.030
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm too special and then they'll just </v>

3205
02:20:10.030 --> 02:20:12.191
<v Speaker 1>going to poop me out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that would be the indignity man is </v>

3206
02:20:12.191 --> 02:20:12.191
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

3207
02:20:12.191 --> 02:20:15.551
<v Speaker 1>they ate me to stay alive I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then it's not like I sustained them </v>

3208
02:20:15.551 --> 02:20:20.321
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I sustained him for a couple of </v>

3209
02:20:20.321 --> 02:20:20.321
<v Speaker 1>fucking hours and they shipped me out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3210
02:20:20.321 --> 02:20:21.400
<v Speaker 3>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is how it works.</v>

3211
02:20:21.401 --> 02:20:22.050
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3212
02:20:22.410 --> 02:20:23.920
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very disturbing.</v>

3213
02:20:23.921 --> 02:20:26.680
<v Speaker 3>Seeing images of humans that have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>eaten by animals.</v>

3214
02:20:26.710 --> 02:20:31.710
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen any and I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want any finger starting to </v>

3215
02:20:31.710 --> 02:20:31.900
<v Speaker 3>move toward a gay boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>

3216
02:20:31.930 --> 02:20:32.110
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3217
02:20:32.111 --> 02:20:37.111
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Classic one of a body that they found </v>

3218
02:20:37.111 --> 02:20:39.691
<v Speaker 3>that bears at eaten and I was horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just crazy to look at is even make </v>

3219
02:20:40.850 --> 02:20:42.250
<v Speaker 3>human anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3220
02:20:42.251 --> 02:20:47.251
<v Speaker 3>you know what it is because it was still</v>
<v Speaker 3>wearing sneakers and it's still at heck </v>

3221
02:20:47.251 --> 02:20:48.820
<v Speaker 3>half of its pants on and it's still </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3222
02:20:48.910 --> 02:20:49.900
<v Speaker 3>you know the one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3223
02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:52.370
<v Speaker 3>you could see the thigh bone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

3224
02:20:52.371 --> 02:20:57.371
<v Speaker 3>the meat from the bone had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely stripped off and it was just </v>

3225
02:20:57.371 --> 02:21:00.400
<v Speaker 3>nothing but the thigh bone and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrific.</v>

3226
02:21:00.520 --> 02:21:05.110
<v Speaker 3>You gotta realize like those things man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they get ahold of you,</v>

3227
02:21:05.140 --> 02:21:10.140
<v Speaker 3>the amount of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of power that a bear could </v>

3228
02:21:10.140 --> 02:21:10.140
<v Speaker 3>generate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like especially at grizzly bear.</v>

3229
02:21:10.140 --> 02:21:14.770
<v Speaker 3>My friend John saw a grizzly bear kill a</v>
<v Speaker 3>moose by swatting it,</v>

3230
02:21:15.070 --> 02:21:19.300
<v Speaker 3>swatted it with its pot and broke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's back a moose.</v>

3231
02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:22.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>second deadliest animal on the planet is</v>

3232
02:21:22.901 --> 02:21:26.080
<v Speaker 3>a big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it really that crazy?</v>

3233
02:21:26.081 --> 02:21:28.590
<v Speaker 3>Nobody thinks about it because when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about the logo,</v>

3234
02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:33.640
<v Speaker 3>a rookie be hippo is the most dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal to man on the planet in terms of </v>

3235
02:21:34.241 --> 02:21:37.060
<v Speaker 3>like how many people get killed aml.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second is the Moose.</v>

3236
02:21:37.150 --> 02:21:39.130
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of the deer family.</v>

3237
02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:41.550
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the only dear.</v>

3238
02:21:41.570 --> 02:21:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that will regularly rush.</v>

3239
02:21:43.241 --> 02:21:47.040
<v Speaker 3>People don't want to be anywhere near </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Moose during the reading season.</v>

3240
02:21:47.290 --> 02:21:49.960
<v Speaker 3>There's that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really more importantly is you don't</v>

3241
02:21:49.961 --> 02:21:52.750
<v Speaker 3>want to be near a cow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's got her calves.</v>

3242
02:21:52.770 --> 02:21:56.020
<v Speaker 3>That's video that online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing with grizzlies.</v>

3243
02:21:56.770 --> 02:21:57.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say the real.</v>

3244
02:21:58.180 --> 02:22:00.460
<v Speaker 3>The real fear is not running into a male</v>
<v Speaker 3>grizzly.</v>

3245
02:22:00.460 --> 02:22:03.010
<v Speaker 3>The real fear is running to a female </v>
<v Speaker 3>with cubs,</v>

3246
02:22:03.060 --> 02:22:04.980
<v Speaker 3>which they'll to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3247
02:22:04.990 --> 02:22:07.090
<v Speaker 3>they just didn't want you around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might be a hunter.</v>

3248
02:22:07.240 --> 02:22:10.300
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they seen someone shoot an animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

3249
02:22:10.301 --> 02:22:15.301
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they saw some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of their family gets to that little </v>

3250
02:22:15.301 --> 02:22:15.301
<v Speaker 3>cat that just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot suddenly,</v>

3251
02:22:15.301 --> 02:22:17.780
<v Speaker 3>like you're gonna kill me up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even though you were buddies.</v>

3252
02:22:18.020 --> 02:22:19.840
<v Speaker 3>It has cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it has cubs,</v>

3253
02:22:19.841 --> 02:22:20.390
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're.</v>

3254
02:22:20.391 --> 02:22:25.391
<v Speaker 3>They're on fucking full red alert all </v>
<v Speaker 3>day long because they get eaten all the </v>

3255
02:22:25.391 --> 02:22:27.790
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their cubs get eaten by other bears too,</v>

3256
02:22:27.820 --> 02:22:32.820
<v Speaker 3>so fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like an animal has enough sense to </v>

3257
02:22:32.820 --> 02:22:32.820
<v Speaker 3>be like something to do here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to protect my kids and we just</v>

3258
02:22:32.820 --> 02:22:34.550
<v Speaker 3>watched footage from a movie where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy's like,</v>

3259
02:22:34.590 --> 02:22:38.190
<v Speaker 3>get closer to that lion honey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spit water in its mouth.</v>

3260
02:22:38.220 --> 02:22:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we're soft and we love the </v>

3261
02:22:43.220 --> 02:22:43.220
<v Speaker 3>thrill of being that close to death and </v>
<v Speaker 3>danger.</v>

3262
02:22:43.380 --> 02:22:46.680
<v Speaker 3>I know you're a smart man now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a chicken man.</v>

3263
02:22:47.340 --> 02:22:48.690
<v Speaker 3>You're a wise man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No courage.</v>

3264
02:22:48.691 --> 02:22:51.510
<v Speaker 3>I just want to extend my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is not true.</v>

3265
02:22:51.690 --> 02:22:56.690
<v Speaker 3>You have courage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just choose to not put yourself in </v>

3266
02:22:56.690 --> 02:22:57.840
<v Speaker 3>dangerous situations all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had never taken this path in life and</v>

3267
02:22:57.841 --> 02:22:59.970
<v Speaker 3>become this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you didn't have any courage,</v>

3268
02:22:59.971 --> 02:23:04.971
<v Speaker 3>you absolutely have courage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you just smart enough to know that </v>

3269
02:23:04.971 --> 02:23:05.570
<v Speaker 3>you're not like a physical person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not into.</v>

3270
02:23:05.640 --> 02:23:10.640
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to do those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He definitely don't want to be around </v>

3271
02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:10.710
<v Speaker 3>some fucking giant ass cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can kill you.</v>

3272
02:23:10.920 --> 02:23:13.860
<v Speaker 3>It's not a matter of being a coward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a matter of being smart.</v>

3273
02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:18.920
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if that's a matter of being smart </v>

3274
02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:19.290
<v Speaker 3>now everything collapses and shit like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3275
02:23:19.320 --> 02:23:21.900
<v Speaker 3>then I got no livable skill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one does.</v>

3276
02:23:21.910 --> 02:23:25.590
<v Speaker 3>Ready to fucking take to the hills with </v>
<v Speaker 3>a fucking bow and defend yours,</v>

3277
02:23:25.620 --> 02:23:26.370
<v Speaker 3>just like you are.</v>

3278
02:23:26.490 --> 02:23:28.470
<v Speaker 3>How many hours do I have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3279
02:23:28.471 --> 02:23:31.270
<v Speaker 3>how long can I live with these arrows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

3280
02:23:31.310 --> 02:23:34.440
<v Speaker 3>What happens if I break that down to 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrows?</v>

3281
02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:35.730
<v Speaker 3>How many?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long can I live with?</v>

3282
02:23:35.731 --> 02:23:40.731
<v Speaker 3>20 arrows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many things am I going to miss to </v>

3283
02:23:40.731 --> 02:23:40.731
<v Speaker 3>keep running?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to break into a Cabela's,</v>

3284
02:23:40.731 --> 02:23:45.680
<v Speaker 3>steal a bunch of Arrow shafts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>figured out they've got a gluing </v>

3285
02:23:45.680 --> 02:23:48.501
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to learn how to restrain a bow </v>

3286
02:23:48.501 --> 02:23:48.501
<v Speaker 3>with the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if the one of the risers snaps?</v>

3287
02:23:48.501 --> 02:23:50.820
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get some spare boast somehow and</v>
<v Speaker 3>have them laying around.</v>

3288
02:23:51.180 --> 02:23:52.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3289
02:23:52.261 --> 02:23:54.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be real skinny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to miss a lot.</v>

3290
02:23:54.331 --> 02:23:56.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to get enough food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know it's going to happen.</v>

3291
02:23:56.731 --> 02:23:58.710
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least I didn't die years ago.</v>

3292
02:23:58.711 --> 02:24:02.630
<v Speaker 3>Like Kev.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh cause he had no skills whatsoever.</v>

3293
02:24:02.630 --> 02:24:05.480
<v Speaker 3>I want to be one of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>restart civilization lock.</v>

3294
02:24:05.530 --> 02:24:06.860
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3295
02:24:07.020 --> 02:24:09.390
<v Speaker 3>Do you know there's blamed when </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's like,</v>

3296
02:24:09.391 --> 02:24:10.980
<v Speaker 3>this sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is your fault.</v>

3297
02:24:10.981 --> 02:24:13.260
<v Speaker 3>You started civilization like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like tried.</v>

3298
02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:16.440
<v Speaker 3>What's going on right now in Hawaii is </v>
<v Speaker 3>fairly minor.</v>

3299
02:24:16.470 --> 02:24:19.770
<v Speaker 3>What is in terms of volcanic volcanic </v>
<v Speaker 3>activity in terms of the world,</v>

3300
02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:23.020
<v Speaker 3>like there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's giant events that happened every</v>

3301
02:24:23.050 --> 02:24:25.170
<v Speaker 3>know 100,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>80,000,</v>

3302
02:24:25.171 --> 02:24:28.050
<v Speaker 3>whatever all over the world and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>giant events.</v>

3303
02:24:28.051 --> 02:24:33.051
<v Speaker 3>These super volcanoes had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible for knocking people down to </v>

3304
02:24:33.051 --> 02:24:33.240
<v Speaker 3>an estimated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the number?</v>

3305
02:24:33.241 --> 02:24:37.950
<v Speaker 3>Something like seven thousand seven </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand people somewhere.</v>

3306
02:24:38.150 --> 02:24:40.320
<v Speaker 3>It was maybe a couple thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>70,000</v>

3307
02:24:40.321 --> 02:24:42.050
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that where I'm getting the Fran seven</v>

3308
02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:47.150
<v Speaker 3>from a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was a super volcano that the </v>

3309
02:24:47.150 --> 02:24:50.331
<v Speaker 3>human population killed every one except</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a few thousand people and there was.</v>

3310
02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:54.720
<v Speaker 3>This was somewhere around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 60 slash 70,000</v>

3311
02:24:54.721 --> 02:24:56.460
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it?</v>

3312
02:24:56.461 --> 02:25:00.840
<v Speaker 3>Say I pompei like event 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>roughly a thousand reproductive people.</v>

3313
02:25:01.110 --> 02:25:04.080
<v Speaker 3>Thousand people left 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

3314
02:25:04.170 --> 02:25:07.380
<v Speaker 3>A thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the last of the humans and they</v>

3315
02:25:07.381 --> 02:25:11.430
<v Speaker 3>repopulate it from that number to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One says it was as low as 40,</v>

3316
02:25:11.610 --> 02:25:14.700
<v Speaker 3>40 people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's just a rough estimate.</v>

3317
02:25:14.730 --> 02:25:17.430
<v Speaker 3>Biblical where this information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well listen man,</v>

3318
02:25:17.431 --> 02:25:22.431
<v Speaker 3>if yellow stone blows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're dealing with the exact same </v>

3319
02:25:22.431 --> 02:25:22.431
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

3320
02:25:22.431 --> 02:25:22.600
<v Speaker 3>most of North America is dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

3321
02:25:22.690 --> 02:25:23.590
<v Speaker 3>Expand?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

3322
02:25:23.740 --> 02:25:26.530
<v Speaker 3>Yellow stone is a super volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3323
02:25:26.531 --> 02:25:31.531
<v Speaker 3>Might've hit as low as what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened to Harry went to JFK </v>

3324
02:25:31.531 --> 02:25:34.410
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Conspiracies pairs</v>

3325
02:25:34.410 --> 02:25:34.980
<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3326
02:25:34.981 --> 02:25:39.981
<v Speaker 1>we've wax so we can win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once in our history of the worldwide </v>

3327
02:25:39.981 --> 02:25:42.000
<v Speaker 1>population of human being skidded so </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharply,</v>

3328
02:25:42.210 --> 02:25:44.820
<v Speaker 1>we were down to roughly a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproductive adults.</v>

3329
02:25:44.821 --> 02:25:47.600
<v Speaker 1>One study says we hit as low as 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40.</v>

3330
02:25:47.610 --> 02:25:48.780
<v Speaker 1>C'Mon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can't be right.</v>

3331
02:25:48.781 --> 02:25:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technical term is 40 breeding pairs.</v>

3332
02:25:51.151 --> 02:25:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Children not included,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more likely.</v>

3333
02:25:53.281 --> 02:25:56.570
<v Speaker 1>There was a drastic dip and then $5,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

3334
02:25:56.580 --> 02:26:01.580
<v Speaker 1>bedraggled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Homosapiens struggled together and </v>

3335
02:26:01.580 --> 02:26:04.191
<v Speaker 1>pitiful little clumps hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gathering for thousands of years until </v>

3336
02:26:04.191 --> 02:26:05.730
<v Speaker 1>in the late stone age we humans began to</v>
<v Speaker 1>recover,</v>

3337
02:26:05.970 --> 02:26:08.640
<v Speaker 1>but for a time there says science writer</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Kean.</v>

3338
02:26:08.641 --> 02:26:11.430
<v Speaker 1>We damn near went extinct and that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the volcano.</v>

3339
02:26:11.431 --> 02:26:12.820
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

3340
02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:15.690
<v Speaker 1>What killed the lava blocks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Sun</v>

3341
02:26:15.740 --> 02:26:18.050
<v Speaker 3>blocks the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody runs out of food.</v>

3342
02:26:18.051 --> 02:26:19.670
<v Speaker 3>Everything goes extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the matrix.</v>

3343
02:26:19.671 --> 02:26:21.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets really fucking cold.</v>

3344
02:26:21.710 --> 02:26:22.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

3345
02:26:22.431 --> 02:26:25.220
<v Speaker 3>Very scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The difference in Mount St Helens.</v>

3346
02:26:25.221 --> 02:26:27.380
<v Speaker 3>Little Little Fart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vesuvius,</v>

3347
02:26:27.590 --> 02:26:32.590
<v Speaker 3>79.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it said the Tobi Super Volcano is </v>

3348
02:26:32.590 --> 02:26:33.200
<v Speaker 3>the one that happens 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

3349
02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:38.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that was a mess around from Mount </v>

3350
02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:38.680
<v Speaker 3>Saint Helen's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You massive.</v>

3351
02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:38.680
<v Speaker 3>Super.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3352
02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:39.620
<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Captured my imagination.</v>

3353
02:26:39.621 --> 02:26:40.220
<v Speaker 3>I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3354
02:26:40.221 --> 02:26:42.350
<v Speaker 3>we got volcanoes on this bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3355
02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:45.080
<v Speaker 3>yellowstone is the spooky one because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a super.</v>

3356
02:26:45.081 --> 02:26:48.200
<v Speaker 3>Volcano is just water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3357
02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:51.830
<v Speaker 3>no stone is what they call a Caldera </v>
<v Speaker 3>volcano.</v>

3358
02:26:51.980 --> 02:26:53.200
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is,</v>

3359
02:26:53.201 --> 02:26:56.270
<v Speaker 3>is it gets to this peak in the eruption </v>
<v Speaker 3>is so violent.</v>

3360
02:26:56.540 --> 02:27:01.540
<v Speaker 3>It flattens out and the mountain </v>
<v Speaker 3>disappears and it's just left this </v>

3361
02:27:01.540 --> 02:27:02.570
<v Speaker 3>crater and so when they were first </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at it,</v>

3362
02:27:02.571 --> 02:27:03.830
<v Speaker 3>they were trying to figure out what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

3363
02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:08.920
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know if it was an impact </v>
<v Speaker 3>crater was this crater from and then </v>

3364
02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:11.870
<v Speaker 3>they started using satellite imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say like 20 years ago,</v>

3365
02:27:12.530 --> 02:27:17.530
<v Speaker 3>20 plus years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they realized that it was a super </v>

3366
02:27:17.530 --> 02:27:20.251
<v Speaker 3>volcano and enormous volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's something like 600 </v>

3367
02:27:20.251 --> 02:27:22.850
<v Speaker 3>kilometers across and if that fucker </v>
<v Speaker 3>blows,</v>

3368
02:27:22.910 --> 02:27:27.910
<v Speaker 3>like that is a wrap for North America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a wrap and it blows every six to </v>

3369
02:27:28.431 --> 02:27:33.431
<v Speaker 3>800,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years and the last time it blew was </v>

3370
02:27:33.431 --> 02:27:33.431
<v Speaker 3>600,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

3371
02:27:34.340 --> 02:27:39.340
<v Speaker 3>So we could be on the verge of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Within the history within the next </v>

3372
02:27:39.340 --> 02:27:40.310
<v Speaker 3>200,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

3373
02:27:40.340 --> 02:27:42.830
<v Speaker 3>It's likely if the history repeats </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself again,</v>

3374
02:27:43.100 --> 02:27:48.100
<v Speaker 3>that we get some sort of unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 3>violent event that comes out of </v>

3375
02:27:48.201 --> 02:27:51.290
<v Speaker 3>yellowstone that literally brings </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity to its knees.</v>

3376
02:27:51.410 --> 02:27:56.410
<v Speaker 3>So all of our problems with </v>
<v Speaker 3>overpopulation destroying the </v>

3377
02:27:56.410 --> 02:27:58.730
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crime and war and corruption,</v>

3378
02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:04.000
<v Speaker 3>they will seem like nothing can because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there will be no fucking son getting in.</v>

3379
02:28:04.610 --> 02:28:07.340
<v Speaker 3>There will be nuclear winter plants </v>
<v Speaker 3>dying,</v>

3380
02:28:08.280 --> 02:28:12.530
<v Speaker 3>no snap and half the people disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like these are the end times.</v>

3381
02:28:12.531 --> 02:28:15.680
<v Speaker 3>The Sky is black hundred percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible that something like that.</v>

3382
02:28:15.681 --> 02:28:18.170
<v Speaker 3>If especially if there's more than one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them went off,</v>

3383
02:28:18.290 --> 02:28:23.290
<v Speaker 3>like say yellowstone goes off and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>say one goes somewhere else in the </v>

3384
02:28:23.290 --> 02:28:23.290
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

3385
02:28:23.290 --> 02:28:25.370
<v Speaker 2>I think isn't there like seven or eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>super volcanoes?</v>

3386
02:28:25.610 --> 02:28:27.710
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's seven or eight of them I want to</v>

3387
02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:33.440
<v Speaker 2>could split the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we just cover the earth with </v>

3388
02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:33.440
<v Speaker 2>ash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think the problem is the ash,</v>

3389
02:28:33.530 --> 02:28:38.530
<v Speaker 2>the objections and all that stuff just </v>
<v Speaker 2>blocks out the sun and it lingers for </v>

3390
02:28:38.530 --> 02:28:40.010
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three of them are in the western part of</v>

3391
02:28:40.011 --> 02:28:41.630
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the.</v>

3392
02:28:42.090 --> 02:28:46.490
<v Speaker 2>That's that's where we are three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Dude.</v>

3393
02:28:47.210 --> 02:28:49.800
<v Speaker 2>What are the other ones?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Long Valley and Valley Grande.</v>

3394
02:28:50.110 --> 02:28:52.040
<v Speaker 2>What does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard of those.</v>

3395
02:28:52.600 --> 02:28:57.600
<v Speaker 2>That's super close to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where the fuck is that one more sitting </v>

3396
02:28:57.600 --> 02:28:58.480
<v Speaker 2>on it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We look it up.</v>

3397
02:28:59.020 --> 02:28:59.580
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3398
02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:04.600
<v Speaker 2>I used to be scared of that shit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I don't get scared of that some </v>

3399
02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:09.880
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you feel different now that you've </v>

3400
02:29:09.880 --> 02:29:11.561
<v Speaker 2>had a heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you feel like you're a different </v>

3401
02:29:11.561 --> 02:29:11.561
<v Speaker 2>person?</v>

3402
02:29:11.561 --> 02:29:11.561
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a second lease on life as it</v>
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

3403
02:29:11.561 --> 02:29:15.790
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not in the way like you see in </v>

3404
02:29:15.790 --> 02:29:15.790
<v Speaker 2>movies where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you feel isn't mammoth?</v>

3405
02:29:15.790 --> 02:29:19.040
<v Speaker 2>Mammoth is a super volcano called Dara.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3406
02:29:19.041 --> 02:29:22.670
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up with Jason to mammoth </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain time to move.</v>

3407
02:29:22.671 --> 02:29:26.870
<v Speaker 2>We could blow mammoth could blow they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but wouldn't you rather be that close to</v>

3408
02:29:26.871 --> 02:29:31.490
<v Speaker 2>ground zero like because you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to live in the Glendale,</v>

3409
02:29:31.980 --> 02:29:33.760
<v Speaker 2>so it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just rubs.</v>

3410
02:29:33.770 --> 02:29:35.500
<v Speaker 2>It just kills everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anywhere near.</v>

3411
02:29:35.990 --> 02:29:40.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be like a million miles </v>
<v Speaker 2>away and watch it from the distance and </v>

3412
02:29:40.990 --> 02:29:41.960
<v Speaker 2>know that in a month you're gonna be </v>
<v Speaker 2>starving to death.</v>

3413
02:29:42.020 --> 02:29:42.910
<v Speaker 2>It's coming soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3414
02:29:42.920 --> 02:29:47.920
<v Speaker 2>You're almost better off and having </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening right underneath you and just </v>

3415
02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:50.981
<v Speaker 2>sucking you into the lava.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever have a near death </v>

3416
02:29:50.981 --> 02:29:51.050
<v Speaker 2>experience?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3417
02:29:51.051 --> 02:29:52.370
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3418
02:29:52.670 --> 02:29:56.810
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it is in the movies where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you suddenly you're like,</v>

3419
02:29:56.811 --> 02:29:58.580
<v Speaker 2>now I see everything more clearly.</v>

3420
02:29:59.050 --> 02:30:03.020
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly an organizing an </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizer like where you're like,</v>

3421
02:30:03.021 --> 02:30:08.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that Shit just doesn't really </v>

3422
02:30:08.021 --> 02:30:09.971
<v Speaker 2>matter so much anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And periodically you sit there and go </v>

3423
02:30:09.971 --> 02:30:09.971
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck,</v>

3424
02:30:09.971 --> 02:30:13.421
<v Speaker 2>I almost died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it puts things in a different </v>

3425
02:30:13.421 --> 02:30:13.421
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I saw a lot of folks online go on,</v>

3426
02:30:13.421 --> 02:30:18.311
<v Speaker 2>like I can't wait to see what he makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>next man because it can be so profound </v>

3427
02:30:18.311 --> 02:30:22.271
<v Speaker 2>and that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next thing I'm going to make as Jane </v>

3428
02:30:22.271 --> 02:30:24.670
<v Speaker 2>Silent Bob Reboot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing profound about it and </v>

3429
02:30:24.670 --> 02:30:26.891
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I figured I figured out because I </v>

3430
02:30:26.891 --> 02:30:29.920
<v Speaker 2>started thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why I think it's [inaudible] like I've </v>

3431
02:30:29.920 --> 02:30:31.040
<v Speaker 2>just always been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least for the last 20 years,</v>

3432
02:30:31.640 --> 02:30:36.640
<v Speaker 2>25 of my career just conducted myself in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a way like live a fucking bucket list </v>

3433
02:30:37.581 --> 02:30:39.200
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just do the things I want to do.</v>

3434
02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I hate you saying that you </v>

3435
02:30:44.230 --> 02:30:44.230
<v Speaker 2>don't have any courage because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>where she didn't take courage.</v>

3436
02:30:44.230 --> 02:30:46.160
<v Speaker 2>That's self centered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no centered courage is like,</v>

3437
02:30:46.520 --> 02:30:49.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it's gonna work out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like you know,</v>

3438
02:30:49.230 --> 02:30:52.670
<v Speaker 2>fucking and also courage comes in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not about you.</v>

3439
02:30:52.671 --> 02:30:55.010
<v Speaker 2>I think for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to do shit.</v>

3440
02:30:55.011 --> 02:30:57.860
<v Speaker 2>That seems interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems fun and you have the confidence</v>

3441
02:30:57.861 --> 02:30:59.610
<v Speaker 2>to pursue that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen Dude,</v>

3442
02:30:59.611 --> 02:31:02.960
<v Speaker 2>if this shit to teach how to use a bow </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Arrow and you,</v>

3443
02:31:02.961 --> 02:31:04.400
<v Speaker 2>you'd figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually.</v>

3444
02:31:04.401 --> 02:31:09.401
<v Speaker 2>Rise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like you're losing all this weight </v>

3445
02:31:09.401 --> 02:31:09.401
<v Speaker 2>and readjusting your life and to do I </v>
<v Speaker 2>check if it all went down.</v>

3446
02:31:09.401 --> 02:31:14.390
<v Speaker 2>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat him first and then I'd be so </v>

3447
02:31:14.390 --> 02:31:15.260
<v Speaker 2>insulted because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to ship me out.</v>

3448
02:31:15.530 --> 02:31:18.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm good for a podcast or two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please don't eat me.</v>

3449
02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:20.730
<v Speaker 2>So I have Robert Schoch</v>

3450
02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:25.760
<v Speaker 3>on the podcast as geologists from Boston</v>
<v Speaker 3>University and he is one of,</v>

3451
02:31:25.860 --> 02:31:30.860
<v Speaker 3>of many people that's now pushing this </v>
<v Speaker 3>very controversial theory that the </v>

3452
02:31:30.860 --> 02:31:34.881
<v Speaker 3>sphinx and many of the other structures </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Egypt are far older than people </v>

3453
02:31:34.881 --> 02:31:36.750
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are not just like a couple thousand</v>

3454
02:31:36.750 --> 02:31:38.160
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe even 10,000</v>

3455
02:31:38.161 --> 02:31:39.540
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe even more,</v>

3456
02:31:39.810 --> 02:31:43.590
<v Speaker 3>and he bases it on water erosion marks </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the tempo of the Sphinx,</v>

3457
02:31:43.710 --> 02:31:46.500
<v Speaker 3>like where the Sphinx was carved out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Sphinx enclosure.</v>

3458
02:31:46.650 --> 02:31:51.650
<v Speaker 3>There's all these deep fissures that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they thought was sand and gravel and </v>

3459
02:31:51.650 --> 02:31:52.500
<v Speaker 3>wind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he has,</v>

3460
02:31:52.610 --> 02:31:53.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he studied.</v>

3461
02:31:53.671 --> 02:31:58.671
<v Speaker 3>He's a geologist so he studied erosion </v>
<v Speaker 3>his whole life and he looked at it and </v>

3462
02:31:58.671 --> 02:32:02.361
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is water erosion from thousands of </v>

3463
02:32:02.361 --> 02:32:02.361
<v Speaker 3>years of rainfall and he goes into it in</v>
<v Speaker 3>great detail.</v>

3464
02:32:02.361 --> 02:32:06.990
<v Speaker 3>The last time there was great rainfall </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Nile Valley was 9,000</v>

3465
02:32:06.991 --> 02:32:11.991
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which has many thousand years before </v>

3466
02:32:11.991 --> 02:32:11.991
<v Speaker 3>they think the pyramids were </v>
<v Speaker 3>constructed.</v>

3467
02:32:11.991 --> 02:32:15.920
<v Speaker 3>So it's one of these things like they </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't even know of a civilization from </v>

3468
02:32:15.920 --> 02:32:19.461
<v Speaker 3>9,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago that was capable of cutting </v>

3469
02:32:19.461 --> 02:32:19.461
<v Speaker 3>and moving stone like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this rewrites history,</v>

3470
02:32:19.461 --> 02:32:21.120
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super reluctant.</v>

3471
02:32:21.180 --> 02:32:24.390
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that all of these people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have these people that are talking about</v>

3472
02:32:24.391 --> 02:32:29.391
<v Speaker 3>these ancient civilizations is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity rose to a very high level and </v>

3473
02:32:29.391 --> 02:32:33.711
<v Speaker 3>build some incredible structures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then something like that Super </v>

3474
02:32:33.711 --> 02:32:35.160
<v Speaker 3>Volcano or an asteroid will impact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or an ice age,</v>

3475
02:32:35.190 --> 02:32:40.190
<v Speaker 3>some gigantic catastrophic event wiped </v>
<v Speaker 3>out a shitload of fucking people and </v>

3476
02:32:41.221 --> 02:32:44.010
<v Speaker 3>then people were forced to rebuild and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of relearn.</v>

3477
02:32:44.220 --> 02:32:46.800
<v Speaker 3>So if you're looking at some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>construction of the Pyramids,</v>

3478
02:32:46.801 --> 02:32:51.801
<v Speaker 3>like the Great Pyramid of Giza,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure they've dated that to </v>

3479
02:32:51.801 --> 02:32:51.801
<v Speaker 3>2,500</v>
<v Speaker 3>BC.</v>

3480
02:32:52.170 --> 02:32:57.170
<v Speaker 3>So the people that made the Sphinx and </v>
<v Speaker 3>even some of the other structures they </v>

3481
02:32:57.170 --> 02:33:00.930
<v Speaker 3>might have been from a longer ago in </v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

3482
02:33:01.560 --> 02:33:03.720
<v Speaker 3>in relationship to the construction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Sphinx,</v>

3483
02:33:03.780 --> 02:33:06.690
<v Speaker 3>than we are to the construction of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Great Pyramid.</v>

3484
02:33:07.320 --> 02:33:09.810
<v Speaker 3>Like we might have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we were talking about,</v>

3485
02:33:10.110 --> 02:33:12.300
<v Speaker 3>the Great Pyramid was 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years old.</v>

3486
02:33:12.460 --> 02:33:17.460
<v Speaker 3>Right now I have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's entirely possible if the Great </v>

3487
02:33:19.020 --> 02:33:20.610
<v Speaker 3>Pyramid of Giza would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think of somewhere around 50,000</v>

3488
02:33:20.611 --> 02:33:22.590
<v Speaker 3>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that was 5,000</v>

3489
02:33:22.591 --> 02:33:26.970
<v Speaker 3>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Sphinx might be 4,000</v>

3490
02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:32.000
<v Speaker 3>or more years older than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There might be structures that are </v>

3491
02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.050
<v Speaker 3>$10,500,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even 30,000</v>

3492
02:33:34.051 --> 02:33:35.310
<v Speaker 3>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some people's,</v>

3493
02:33:35.430 --> 02:33:37.590
<v Speaker 3>when they go deep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a guy named John Anthony West,</v>

3494
02:33:37.591 --> 02:33:42.591
<v Speaker 3>that was his deep speculation based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way this finks lines up with </v>

3495
02:33:42.591 --> 02:33:44.070
<v Speaker 3>constellations and the Constellation </v>
<v Speaker 3>Leo,</v>

3496
02:33:44.220 --> 02:33:47.100
<v Speaker 3>it does it at like 10,500</v>
<v Speaker 3>BC,</v>

3497
02:33:47.101 --> 02:33:50.490
<v Speaker 3>but also it does it uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or 10,500</v>

3498
02:33:50.491 --> 02:33:53.490
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it also does it at like 30,</v>

3499
02:33:53.760 --> 02:33:55.770
<v Speaker 3>30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago or somewhere in that range,</v>

3500
02:33:55.771 --> 02:34:00.771
<v Speaker 3>like really long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which people are going to get the fuck </v>

3501
02:34:00.771 --> 02:34:00.771
<v Speaker 3>outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just not possible.</v>

3502
02:34:00.771 --> 02:34:01.830
<v Speaker 3>And his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his take was like,</v>

3503
02:34:01.980 --> 02:34:04.680
<v Speaker 3>we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're were just talking about rocks.</v>

3504
02:34:04.860 --> 02:34:06.690
<v Speaker 3>We don't know how these rocks got into </v>
<v Speaker 3>this shape.</v>

3505
02:34:06.930 --> 02:34:11.930
<v Speaker 3>This is just no recorded history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or they used to have some,</v>

3506
02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:14.940
<v Speaker 3>but they know they've got hieroglyphs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a few things,</v>

3507
02:34:14.941 --> 02:34:18.180
<v Speaker 3>but they used to have only had like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

3508
02:34:18.300 --> 02:34:23.300
<v Speaker 3>like a incredibly developed society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mayans and the aztecs built some </v>

3509
02:34:24.101 --> 02:34:27.700
<v Speaker 3>incredible structures and they were like</v>
<v Speaker 3>really into constellations as well.</v>

3510
02:34:27.701 --> 02:34:30.730
<v Speaker 3>They aligned up a lot of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>structures with the constellations.</v>

3511
02:34:30.731 --> 02:34:35.731
<v Speaker 3>They knew a lot about the summer </v>
<v Speaker 3>solstice and they had a really </v>

3512
02:34:35.731 --> 02:34:38.530
<v Speaker 3>complicated calendar that was like a 13 </v>
<v Speaker 3>lunar cycle calendar,</v>

3513
02:34:38.760 --> 02:34:39.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>

3514
02:34:39.590 --> 02:34:41.740
<v Speaker 3>There was like the thing where the Mayan</v>
<v Speaker 3>calendar,</v>

3515
02:34:41.741 --> 02:34:44.290
<v Speaker 3>we're supposed to end December 21st 2000</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of years ago.</v>

3516
02:34:44.291 --> 02:34:44.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

3517
02:34:44.861 --> 02:34:48.670
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was over telling everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got a couple more years pro.</v>

3518
02:34:48.830 --> 02:34:53.830
<v Speaker 3>We have your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've really seem to know what they were </v>

3519
02:34:53.830 --> 02:34:53.830
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

3520
02:34:53.830 --> 02:34:55.480
<v Speaker 3>Go back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if that turns out to be the case.</v>

3521
02:34:55.840 --> 02:34:59.020
<v Speaker 3>Humanity has experienced these great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>

3522
02:34:59.380 --> 02:35:04.380
<v Speaker 3>like high achievements in construction </v>
<v Speaker 3>methods and their ability to put </v>

3523
02:35:05.021 --> 02:35:07.960
<v Speaker 3>together these enormous structures and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then capitalism.</v>

3524
02:35:08.380 --> 02:35:10.780
<v Speaker 3>People die off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get down to a small number and then</v>

3525
02:35:10.781 --> 02:35:13.340
<v Speaker 3>they rebuild and then they do these over</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3526
02:35:13.350 --> 02:35:13.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

3527
02:35:13.931 --> 02:35:18.931
<v Speaker 3>these dips and ups and downs over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>course of thousands and thousands of </v>

3528
02:35:18.931 --> 02:35:20.350
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we got to put it into perspective.</v>

3529
02:35:20.620 --> 02:35:24.850
<v Speaker 3>This country is only 250 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's nothing.</v>

3530
02:35:25.090 --> 02:35:28.630
<v Speaker 3>So if you went back just let's go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go full crazy.</v>

3531
02:35:28.750 --> 02:35:31.900
<v Speaker 3>Let's go back 500 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back 500 years,</v>

3532
02:35:31.901 --> 02:35:36.901
<v Speaker 3>which is nothing in terms of the history</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the planet and nothing in terms of </v>

3533
02:35:36.901 --> 02:35:38.200
<v Speaker 3>even the history of human beings </v>
<v Speaker 3>relatively,</v>

3534
02:35:38.350 --> 02:35:40.810
<v Speaker 3>but 500 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing here,</v>

3535
02:35:40.811 --> 02:35:44.260
<v Speaker 3>but native Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no structures is a few Europeans</v>

3536
02:35:44.261 --> 02:35:44.890
<v Speaker 3>that have visited.</v>

3537
02:35:45.040 --> 02:35:47.530
<v Speaker 3>There's a few set of people that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>come over and boats,</v>

3538
02:35:47.770 --> 02:35:49.870
<v Speaker 3>but there's no buildings in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3539
02:35:49.871 --> 02:35:53.770
<v Speaker 3>there's no New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no Chicago 500 years ago.</v>

3540
02:35:53.771 --> 02:35:58.771
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's none of this goes outside and </v>

3541
02:35:58.771 --> 02:36:02.290
<v Speaker 3>sit around and do a three slash 16 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>look around and realize how improbable </v>

3542
02:36:02.290 --> 02:36:03.940
<v Speaker 3>it all is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go a thousand years before that,</v>

3543
02:36:03.941 --> 02:36:05.500
<v Speaker 3>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand years before that.</v>

3544
02:36:05.501 --> 02:36:06.880
<v Speaker 3>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is empty.</v>

3545
02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.730
<v Speaker 3>This is empty for thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years now.</v>

3546
02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:13.180
<v Speaker 3>Two hundred and 50 years later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

3547
02:36:13.390 --> 02:36:18.390
<v Speaker 3>It stacked up with buildings and </v>
<v Speaker 3>construction methods that we were never </v>

3548
02:36:18.390 --> 02:36:19.690
<v Speaker 3>capable of 200 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>300 years ago,</v>

3549
02:36:19.691 --> 02:36:22.420
<v Speaker 3>500 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we couldn't build these things.</v>

3550
02:36:22.421 --> 02:36:24.280
<v Speaker 3>We couldn't make airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't have the knowledge yet.</v>

3551
02:36:24.281 --> 02:36:29.281
<v Speaker 3>We didn't understand it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is that people have gone </v>

3552
02:36:29.281 --> 02:36:32.131
<v Speaker 3>through these great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great heights many times and but they </v>

3553
02:36:32.131 --> 02:36:36.301
<v Speaker 3>did it in different ways and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you look at the construction </v>

3554
02:36:36.301 --> 02:36:37.750
<v Speaker 3>of this finks and the pyramids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody builds anything like the pyramids</v>

3555
02:36:37.751 --> 02:36:38.230
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

3556
02:36:38.500 --> 02:36:40.540
<v Speaker 3>Two million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>300,000</v>

3557
02:36:40.541 --> 02:36:45.541
<v Speaker 3>stones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them cut from a quarry that was </v>

3558
02:36:45.541 --> 02:36:48.061
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used to take the fucking rocks and </v>

3559
02:36:48.061 --> 02:36:49.000
<v Speaker 3>float them down on boats and fit them </v>
<v Speaker 3>into places.</v>

3560
02:36:49.001 --> 02:36:51.190
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the knowledge.</v>

3561
02:36:51.191 --> 02:36:53.410
<v Speaker 3>They must have had the wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3562
02:36:53.470 --> 02:36:58.470
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the understanding of construction </v>

3563
02:36:58.470 --> 02:37:00.571
<v Speaker 3>methods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're off just a little bit with </v>

3564
02:37:00.571 --> 02:37:02.731
<v Speaker 3>each rock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to meet up at the top of </v>

3565
02:37:02.731 --> 02:37:05.011
<v Speaker 3>this perfect pyramid shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a marvel of mathematics and </v>

3566
02:37:05.011 --> 02:37:09.240
<v Speaker 3>engineering and construction and by </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's estimate it's 5,000</v>

3567
02:37:10.181 --> 02:37:13.750
<v Speaker 3>something years old are in the range of </v>
<v Speaker 3>4,500</v>

3568
02:37:13.751 --> 02:37:15.040
<v Speaker 3>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere around there,</v>

3569
02:37:15.480 --> 02:37:19.230
<v Speaker 1>sane along and says it may be older than</v>
<v Speaker 1>you</v>

3570
02:37:19.420 --> 02:37:20.950
<v Speaker 3>might be older than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that not.</v>

3571
02:37:20.980 --> 02:37:23.590
<v Speaker 3>They don't think the pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure,</v>

3572
02:37:23.770 --> 02:37:27.130
<v Speaker 3>and maybe this is controversial as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's based on the biological</v>

3573
02:37:27.131 --> 02:37:30.220
<v Speaker 3>material that they can pull out from in </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the cracks and the stones.</v>

3574
02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:35.840
<v Speaker 3>I think people who died was stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything physical or anything biological</v>

3575
02:37:36.611 --> 02:37:41.611
<v Speaker 3>rather like wood or or patrice that </v>
<v Speaker 3>might've went into building the chat.</v>

3576
02:37:41.740 --> 02:37:43.420
<v Speaker 3>That's how they'd carbon dates </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

3577
02:37:43.450 --> 02:37:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Apparently they need carbon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's really tough to carbon date like</v>

3578
02:37:46.970 --> 02:37:49.660
<v Speaker 3>a stone because you don't know what your</v>
<v Speaker 3>dating.</v>

3579
02:37:49.661 --> 02:37:54.661
<v Speaker 3>Are you dating the way the age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stone was cut or the stone was </v>

3580
02:37:54.661 --> 02:37:56.470
<v Speaker 3>created.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck is that?</v>

3581
02:37:56.830 --> 02:37:59.980
<v Speaker 3>Have you had a giant piece of limestone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you dating?</v>

3582
02:37:59.981 --> 02:38:02.320
<v Speaker 3>Are you dating the actual origin of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>limestone?</v>

3583
02:38:02.500 --> 02:38:05.630
<v Speaker 3>It might be millions of years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how long limestone is like,</v>

3584
02:38:06.370 --> 02:38:06.910
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

3585
02:38:07.210 --> 02:38:12.210
<v Speaker 3>I think limestone is seashells that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>been ground down and smashed by gravity </v>

3586
02:38:13.661 --> 02:38:17.830
<v Speaker 3>and layers and layers of earth until </v>
<v Speaker 3>they form into a stone.</v>

3587
02:38:18.310 --> 02:38:22.990
<v Speaker 3>See if I made that up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might have sounded awfully metal.</v>

3588
02:38:23.320 --> 02:38:28.320
<v Speaker 3>There's some shit like that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I know travertine is that </v>

3589
02:38:28.320 --> 02:38:32.460
<v Speaker 3>travertine is like old seashells that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been compressed down at the bottom </v>

3590
02:38:32.460 --> 02:38:35.140
<v Speaker 3>of the ocean forever until they form </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this hard layer.</v>

3591
02:38:35.290 --> 02:38:36.580
<v Speaker 3>Pretty sure that's true too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might be.</v>

3592
02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:38.290
<v Speaker 3>That might also be bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

3593
02:38:38.310 --> 02:38:39.940
<v Speaker 3>you're well read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

3594
02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:41.950
<v Speaker 3>Incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wrong.</v>

3595
02:38:43.450 --> 02:38:48.450
<v Speaker 3>Most limestone deposits are made from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the shells of Microsoft scopic sea </v>

3596
02:38:48.450 --> 02:38:52.141
<v Speaker 3>organisms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coral reefs are a beautiful example of </v>

3597
02:38:52.141 --> 02:38:53.680
<v Speaker 3>organic sedimentary rocks made by </v>
<v Speaker 3>creatures that are still living.</v>

3598
02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:54.700
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

3599
02:38:54.701 --> 02:38:56.530
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So limestone deposits,</v>

3600
02:38:56.550 --> 02:38:59.260
<v Speaker 3>it's made by the shells of microscopic </v>
<v Speaker 3>sea organisms.</v>

3601
02:38:59.261 --> 02:39:01.630
<v Speaker 3>So these shells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they compress down,</v>

3602
02:39:01.631 --> 02:39:06.631
<v Speaker 3>they make this stone they built,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they built fucking giant buildings out </v>

3603
02:39:06.631 --> 02:39:09.460
<v Speaker 3>of this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just think of the age of that stone.</v>

3604
02:39:09.461 --> 02:39:11.170
<v Speaker 3>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3605
02:39:11.290 --> 02:39:12.580
<v Speaker 3>how old was that shit?</v>

3606
02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:18.800
<v Speaker 1>So everything that we think we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>could literally be incorrect by a couple</v>

3607
02:39:20.081 --> 02:39:20.410
<v Speaker 1>thousand.</v>

3608
02:39:20.460 --> 02:39:21.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even that,</v>

3609
02:39:21.631 --> 02:39:26.631
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's weird that we're holding </v>

3610
02:39:26.631 --> 02:39:26.970
<v Speaker 3>onto these numbers instead of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

3611
02:39:26.971 --> 02:39:31.971
<v Speaker 3>well we have some tests that show that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're pretty sure that this was created </v>

3612
02:39:32.221 --> 02:39:34.590
<v Speaker 3>around them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that you might be right.</v>

3613
02:39:34.620 --> 02:39:39.620
<v Speaker 3>That might be older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people like really resist what he's </v>

3614
02:39:39.620 --> 02:39:42.021
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're really resistant because you'd </v>

3615
02:39:42.021 --> 02:39:44.031
<v Speaker 3>have to go back and a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>got degrees in Egyptology like do you </v>

3616
02:39:44.031 --> 02:39:45.390
<v Speaker 3>have to rewrite what we know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because once they.</v>

3617
02:39:45.540 --> 02:39:49.290
<v Speaker 3>Once they decide this is the age where </v>
<v Speaker 3>this was made and taught Moses,</v>

3618
02:39:49.291 --> 02:39:53.010
<v Speaker 3>the third is responsible for this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's responsible for that.</v>

3619
02:39:53.190 --> 02:39:58.190
<v Speaker 3>Once they write that and sell the books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super hard to take that back and </v>

3620
02:39:58.190 --> 02:40:02.310
<v Speaker 3>suddenly be like a super hard to admit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't really know and so this</v>

3621
02:40:02.670 --> 02:40:04.410
<v Speaker 1>and this isn't something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3622
02:40:04.411 --> 02:40:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Pluto's not a planet anymore because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were off by its size or whatever.</v>

3623
02:40:08.850 --> 02:40:13.850
<v Speaker 1>This is like we had literally no idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people existed that</v>

3624
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:19.010
<v Speaker 3>far back when people existed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we didn't know they were capable of </v>

3625
02:40:19.010 --> 02:40:19.190
<v Speaker 3>building things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm saying like,</v>

3626
02:40:19.230 --> 02:40:22.230
<v Speaker 3>why is that even surprising?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If people 4,000</v>

3627
02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:24.750
<v Speaker 3>fucking years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could build something as crazy as the</v>

3628
02:40:24.751 --> 02:40:28.560
<v Speaker 3>great pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why would I be shocked that someone</v>

3629
02:40:28.561 --> 02:40:33.561
<v Speaker 3>4,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years before that could build a sphinx </v>

3630
02:40:33.561 --> 02:40:33.561
<v Speaker 3>or 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years before that?</v>

3631
02:40:33.561 --> 02:40:37.341
<v Speaker 3>I can build some other fucking temple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's also just a number that's </v>

3632
02:40:37.341 --> 02:40:40.491
<v Speaker 3>really like fucking ridiculous to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>your head around where you're to wait </v>

3633
02:40:40.491 --> 02:40:42.390
<v Speaker 3>4,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>from now backwards and then 4,000</v>

3634
02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:44.010
<v Speaker 3>from that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like forget it.</v>

3635
02:40:45.180 --> 02:40:49.740
<v Speaker 3>And then to think that humanity was </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably restarted at least to a certain</v>

3636
02:40:49.741 --> 02:40:51.600
<v Speaker 3>extent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere around the end of the ice age,</v>

3637
02:40:51.690 --> 02:40:55.020
<v Speaker 3>like the humanity recovered and started </v>
<v Speaker 3>flourishing again.</v>

3638
02:40:55.470 --> 02:40:56.220
<v Speaker 3>So who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3639
02:40:56.270 --> 02:41:01.270
<v Speaker 3>w what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what number of people we dipped down to </v>

3640
02:41:01.270 --> 02:41:01.270
<v Speaker 3>15,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>plus years ago if they were,</v>

3641
02:41:01.890 --> 02:41:06.030
<v Speaker 3>if they built the spanx further back </v>
<v Speaker 3>than we thought they did,</v>

3642
02:41:06.330 --> 02:41:07.830
<v Speaker 3>did they have language skills?</v>

3643
02:41:08.170 --> 02:41:10.860
<v Speaker 3>It must build something like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>without being like,</v>

3644
02:41:10.861 --> 02:41:12.510
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put a nose on it.</v>

3645
02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:15.150
<v Speaker 3>I think they're pretty sure that </v>
<v Speaker 3>language is 40,000</v>

3646
02:41:15.151 --> 02:41:16.680
<v Speaker 3>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if that's true.</v>

3647
02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:22.400
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what they think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they think language in the form </v>

3648
02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:23.250
<v Speaker 3>that we would describe as language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3649
02:41:23.251 --> 02:41:24.790
<v Speaker 3>like maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3650
02:41:25.820 --> 02:41:29.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what language is 200,000.</v>

3651
02:41:29.820 --> 02:41:30.550
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3652
02:41:32.550 --> 02:41:35.340
<v Speaker 3>Psychology today though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely probably smarter than me.</v>

3653
02:41:35.730 --> 02:41:37.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

3654
02:41:37.231 --> 02:41:38.730
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so 200,000</v>

3655
02:41:38.731 --> 02:41:40.770
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more over around 50,000</v>

3656
02:41:40.771 --> 02:41:43.070
<v Speaker 3>years ago for a period referred to by </v>
<v Speaker 3>archeologists,</v>

3657
02:41:43.150 --> 02:41:48.150
<v Speaker 3>the Upper Paleolithic and unprecedented </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultural explosion began to manifest </v>

3658
02:41:48.150 --> 02:41:50.100
<v Speaker 3>itself for human communities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's what I remember.</v>

3659
02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:55.400
<v Speaker 3>So 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago is the number of this in my </v>

3660
02:41:55.400 --> 02:41:55.400
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So language,</v>

3661
02:41:55.400 --> 02:41:56.760
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had it a long time.</v>

3662
02:41:56.790 --> 02:42:01.790
<v Speaker 3>They didn't start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't think at least they started </v>

3663
02:42:01.790 --> 02:42:02.310
<v Speaker 3>writing shit until somewhere around </v>
<v Speaker 3>10,000</v>

3664
02:42:02.311 --> 02:42:07.311
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't even know if that's the </v>

3665
02:42:07.311 --> 02:42:07.311
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>

3666
02:42:07.311 --> 02:42:09.330
<v Speaker 3>But I think the oldest known writing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we know of today,</v>

3667
02:42:09.331 --> 02:42:11.760
<v Speaker 3>I think is that stuff that comes out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iraq.</v>

3668
02:42:12.480 --> 02:42:14.040
<v Speaker 3>Cuneiform,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called.</v>

3669
02:42:14.041 --> 02:42:19.041
<v Speaker 3>It's from the ancient Sumerians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were the oldest civilization that </v>

3670
02:42:19.041 --> 02:42:19.770
<v Speaker 3>we're like modern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not modern,</v>

3671
02:42:19.771 --> 02:42:22.340
<v Speaker 3>but advanced civilization that we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>currently aware of.</v>

3672
02:42:22.380 --> 02:42:24.150
<v Speaker 3>And they kept records.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3673
02:42:24.151 --> 02:42:27.120
<v Speaker 3>they wrote with like old school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever do any carpentry?</v>

3674
02:42:27.390 --> 02:42:30.960
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was a kid in Boston,</v>

3675
02:42:31.020 --> 02:42:34.650
<v Speaker 3>I've worked on a lot of houses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>demolition stuff and carpentry stuff.</v>

3676
02:42:34.651 --> 02:42:39.651
<v Speaker 3>And you would go in these old old houses</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they had these weird nails because </v>

3677
02:42:39.651 --> 02:42:42.950
<v Speaker 3>the nails were all handmade back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There weren't a nail like you think of a</v>

3678
02:42:42.951 --> 02:42:47.951
<v Speaker 3>nail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a table top with a pole underneath </v>

3679
02:42:47.951 --> 02:42:50.091
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not what the nails where the nails </v>

3680
02:42:50.091 --> 02:42:51.980
<v Speaker 3>were like this weird kind of like almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>rectangle or triangle thing and that </v>

3681
02:42:51.980 --> 02:42:55.020
<v Speaker 3>that was exactly what cuneiform looks </v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

3682
02:42:55.021 --> 02:42:57.600
<v Speaker 3>It has like a very specific pull up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

3683
02:42:57.601 --> 02:43:00.660
<v Speaker 3>a Sumerian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sumerian cuneiform.</v>

3684
02:43:00.870 --> 02:43:05.870
<v Speaker 3>So as a series of lines and it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be insanely hard to decipher</v>

3685
02:43:07.590 --> 02:43:12.590
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they were writing and what they </v>

3686
02:43:12.590 --> 02:43:12.590
<v Speaker 3>meant by all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is their language.</v>

3687
02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:14.320
<v Speaker 2>That shit that you're looking at right </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3688
02:43:15.160 --> 02:43:19.000
<v Speaker 2>That right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it seems like an intermediate between</v>

3689
02:43:19.001 --> 02:43:22.030
<v Speaker 2>hieroglyphics and an alphabet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3690
02:43:22.031 --> 02:43:22.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3691
02:43:23.010 --> 02:43:27.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm still considered graphic when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at it like it's still a little.</v>

3692
02:43:27.581 --> 02:43:29.920
<v Speaker 2>Well that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's more toward letter.</v>

3693
02:43:29.980 --> 02:43:31.600
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like a.</v>

3694
02:43:31.610 --> 02:43:33.580
<v Speaker 2>If you saw that on a spaceship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>

3695
02:43:33.610 --> 02:43:34.990
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the alien writing.</v>

3696
02:43:35.050 --> 02:43:40.050
<v Speaker 2>And apparently it's not that alien,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but doesn't that look like if you saw </v>

3697
02:43:40.050 --> 02:43:42.160
<v Speaker 2>that on a spaceship that looks like </v>
<v Speaker 2>something from like hanger 18,</v>

3698
02:43:42.940 --> 02:43:47.940
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that was on the outside of a spatial </v>

3699
02:43:47.940 --> 02:43:47.940
<v Speaker 2>star it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

3700
02:43:47.940 --> 02:43:47.950
<v Speaker 2>it looks very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stargate to me like,</v>

3701
02:43:47.951 --> 02:43:51.250
<v Speaker 2>look at that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dad is like some sort of like if you had</v>

3702
02:43:51.251 --> 02:43:54.170
<v Speaker 2>a computer printout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember those old school printouts that</v>

3703
02:43:54.180 --> 02:43:59.180
<v Speaker 2>would run through computers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the little holes punched in them </v>

3704
02:43:59.180 --> 02:43:59.180
<v Speaker 2>that would look kind of like that.</v>

3705
02:44:00.070 --> 02:44:05.070
<v Speaker 2>The a man that's the oldest language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that shit's 6,000</v>

3706
02:44:05.141 --> 02:44:07.540
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's somewhere around there.</v>

3707
02:44:07.660 --> 02:44:12.660
<v Speaker 2>And that's like Babylonia has been able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to decipher an alphabet or be like 48 </v>

3708
02:44:12.881 --> 02:44:14.080
<v Speaker 2>letters in the alphabet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3709
02:44:14.081 --> 02:44:17.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what they found,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they found a lot of cool shit there.</v>

3710
02:44:17.430 --> 02:44:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Felt a lot of cool shit from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sumerians.</v>

3711
02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:21.150
<v Speaker 2>I remember as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3712
02:44:21.340 --> 02:44:26.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to Catholic school as a kid and </v>

3713
02:44:26.340 --> 02:44:27.460
<v Speaker 2>the big story when we were younger was </v>
<v Speaker 2>we got like new nuns,</v>

3714
02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:29.140
<v Speaker 2>sisters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3715
02:44:29.170 --> 02:44:31.660
<v Speaker 2>like at a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when I started Catholic school,</v>

3716
02:44:31.661 --> 02:44:36.661
<v Speaker 2>Our Lady of perpetual help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had old school nuns that would wrap</v>

3717
02:44:36.671 --> 02:44:40.870
<v Speaker 2>your fucking knuckles and shit like your</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents would talk about and then all of</v>

3718
02:44:40.871 --> 02:44:45.871
<v Speaker 2>a sudden these new sisters come in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sisters of the Franciscan sisters of</v>

3719
02:44:48.611 --> 02:44:52.630
<v Speaker 2>the infant Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were more like about education,</v>

3720
02:44:52.631 --> 02:44:55.200
<v Speaker 2>almost like a Jesuit priest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>

3721
02:44:55.201 --> 02:45:00.201
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they definitely had their vows and </v>

3722
02:45:00.201 --> 02:45:01.981
<v Speaker 2>whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were more progressive in their </v>

3723
02:45:01.981 --> 02:45:04.150
<v Speaker 2>thinking than like the previous </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation that had come prior to them.</v>

3724
02:45:05.370 --> 02:45:10.370
<v Speaker 2>So Sister Teresa was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our eighth grade teacher captured our </v>

3725
02:45:10.370 --> 02:45:13.300
<v Speaker 2>imaginations with the Dead Sea scrolls </v>
<v Speaker 2>through about how,</v>

3726
02:45:13.610 --> 02:45:17.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a bible that we all worked off</v>

3727
02:45:17.111 --> 02:45:22.111
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then thanks to some kid who threw a </v>

3728
02:45:22.111 --> 02:45:25.401
<v Speaker 2>rock in a cave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found all these jars and inside of </v>

3729
02:45:25.401 --> 02:45:27.270
<v Speaker 2>the jurors perfectly preserved where all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these writings on parts.</v>

3730
02:45:28.270 --> 02:45:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3731
02:45:29.470 --> 02:45:34.470
<v Speaker 2>And so that's where we started getting a</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearer picture of the Bible and that's </v>

3732
02:45:34.841 --> 02:45:39.400
<v Speaker 2>where they found bibles or gospels that </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't included in our Bible.</v>

3733
02:45:39.401 --> 02:45:40.720
<v Speaker 2>And Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

3734
02:45:40.810 --> 02:45:44.200
<v Speaker 2>this is a minute before raiders of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lost Ark came out.</v>

3735
02:45:44.770 --> 02:45:46.660
<v Speaker 2>So then when that movie came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were like,</v>

3736
02:45:46.690 --> 02:45:49.240
<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all connected.</v>

3737
02:45:49.950 --> 02:45:50.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

3738
02:45:50.381 --> 02:45:52.030
<v Speaker 2>the scrolls are fascinating man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3739
02:45:52.031 --> 02:45:57.031
<v Speaker 2>they had to use DNA testing to make sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they were getting the pieces of </v>

3740
02:45:57.851 --> 02:46:00.550
<v Speaker 2>this parchment from the same animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>skin.</v>

3741
02:46:00.850 --> 02:46:04.060
<v Speaker 2>So like say if you had these pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did,</v>

3742
02:46:04.150 --> 02:46:08.100
<v Speaker 2>they had so many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they studied them for years and they for</v>

3743
02:46:08.120 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 2>to decipher them would have to lay them </v>
<v Speaker 2>out</v>

3744
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:11.600
<v Speaker 3>on tables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever see what they look like,</v>

3745
02:46:11.900 --> 02:46:16.900
<v Speaker 3>like laid out on tables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the ways that they had to </v>

3746
02:46:16.900 --> 02:46:20.050
<v Speaker 3>determine where pieces would go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a incredibly painstaking </v>

3747
02:46:20.050 --> 02:46:23.681
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had to take small bits of organic </v>

3748
02:46:23.681 --> 02:46:25.730
<v Speaker 3>material because it's animal skins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they would run it through a DNA</v>

3749
02:46:25.731 --> 02:46:26.450
<v Speaker 3>test and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3750
02:46:26.451 --> 02:46:29.840
<v Speaker 3>this is the same animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This animal is where,</v>

3751
02:46:29.870 --> 02:46:30.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3752
02:46:30.650 --> 02:46:35.650
<v Speaker 3>all these pieces go on here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is likely for the same piece of </v>

3753
02:46:35.650 --> 02:46:35.650
<v Speaker 3>skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3754
02:46:35.650 --> 02:46:37.130
<v Speaker 3>amazing dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's crazy.</v>

3755
02:46:37.530 --> 02:46:42.530
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the only version of the </v>

3756
02:46:42.530 --> 02:46:42.530
<v Speaker 3>Bible that was written in Aramaic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3757
02:46:42.530 --> 02:46:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Well done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

3758
02:46:43.221 --> 02:46:43.770
<v Speaker 3>You're well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Read.</v>

3759
02:46:45.260 --> 02:46:46.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>read about drugs.</v>

3760
02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:51.400
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is all about John Marco Allegro we </v>

3761
02:46:51.400 --> 02:46:51.400
<v Speaker 3>talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3762
02:46:51.400 --> 02:46:55.391
<v Speaker 3>that guy found out about the Dead Sea </v>
<v Speaker 3>Scrolls and the Christian myth and the </v>

3763
02:46:55.391 --> 02:46:57.320
<v Speaker 3>sacred mushroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the cross is two books on that.</v>

3764
02:46:57.680 --> 02:46:59.390
<v Speaker 3>But he was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a guy who studied that.</v>

3765
02:46:59.450 --> 02:47:04.070
<v Speaker 3>The Dead Sea Scrolls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At what point do we just saw an image of</v>

3766
02:47:04.071 --> 02:47:06.920
<v Speaker 3>the Dead Sea Scroll?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Parchment spread out point.</v>

3767
02:47:06.921 --> 02:47:08.750
<v Speaker 3>Do I give up instantly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3768
02:47:08.751 --> 02:47:10.310
<v Speaker 3>Like where somebody is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good luck.</v>

3769
02:47:10.340 --> 02:47:12.470
<v Speaker 3>You might have to dns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Goodbye.</v>

3770
02:47:12.620 --> 02:47:13.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

3771
02:47:13.191 --> 02:47:14.390
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you guys need funding,</v>

3772
02:47:14.640 --> 02:47:16.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm down to Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to jet.</v>

3773
02:47:16.790 --> 02:47:17.830
<v Speaker 3>I got a spot at the store.</v>

3774
02:47:19.860 --> 02:47:21.560
<v Speaker 3>The store is not for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3775
02:47:21.710 --> 02:47:23.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is for somebody and I'm grateful.</v>

3776
02:47:24.650 --> 02:47:26.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm grateful that there's guys like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3777
02:47:26.151 --> 02:47:31.151
<v Speaker 3>like Robert Schoch who's taking these </v>
<v Speaker 3>trips to Egypt to study this and really </v>

3778
02:47:31.151 --> 02:47:34.520
<v Speaker 3>putting his neck out there releasing </v>
<v Speaker 3>this very controversial theory.</v>

3779
02:47:34.820 --> 02:47:39.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad there's all these people out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there that are questioning these things </v>

3780
02:47:39.820 --> 02:47:42.080
<v Speaker 3>and looking into these things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone has the energy to study the Dead</v>

3781
02:47:42.080 --> 02:47:47.080
<v Speaker 3>Sea Scrolls and to go over and </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently there's some wacky ass </v>

3782
02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:49.301
<v Speaker 3>fucking crazy stories in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they've tried to compare the </v>

3783
02:47:49.301 --> 02:47:50.360
<v Speaker 3>stories for the like way more extreme </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

3784
02:47:50.361 --> 02:47:52.550
<v Speaker 3>way weirder to the point where people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are only.</v>

3785
02:47:52.551 --> 02:47:56.060
<v Speaker 3>I think we should use these stories to </v>
<v Speaker 3>involve the same characters.</v>

3786
02:47:56.120 --> 02:48:01.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't know much about two years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

3787
02:48:01.540 --> 02:48:04.520
<v Speaker 3>What is like maybe we could find because</v>
<v Speaker 3>that story has a problem,</v>

3788
02:48:04.521 --> 02:48:08.330
<v Speaker 3>isn't chunk missing these 12 and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>next time they pick them up.</v>

3789
02:48:08.330 --> 02:48:09.540
<v Speaker 3>He's 31.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3790
02:48:10.440 --> 02:48:15.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's probably something that </v>

3791
02:48:15.440 --> 02:48:15.740
<v Speaker 3>can't be just googled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think where was Jesus probably have to</v>

3792
02:48:15.741 --> 02:48:18.650
<v Speaker 3>read a book on like what they learned </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the Dead Sea Scrolls.</v>

3793
02:48:18.950 --> 02:48:23.950
<v Speaker 3>But I remember there was some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>documentary on all of the hidden truths </v>

3794
02:48:23.950 --> 02:48:27.961
<v Speaker 3>of the deaths,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Dead Sea Scrolls and why these </v>

3795
02:48:27.961 --> 02:48:30.761
<v Speaker 3>Christians were trying to omit it from </v>
<v Speaker 3>you and not put it into the final </v>

3796
02:48:30.951 --> 02:48:32.750
<v Speaker 3>version of the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3797
02:48:32.770 --> 02:48:34.580
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so nice to gospels,</v>

3798
02:48:34.581 --> 02:48:36.740
<v Speaker 3>they pull a lot from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from there.</v>

3799
02:48:36.741 --> 02:48:40.040
<v Speaker 3>The gnostics were people that it was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>faith,</v>

3800
02:48:40.041 --> 02:48:45.041
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a section of faith that they were </v>

3801
02:48:45.501 --> 02:48:47.540
<v Speaker 3>great record keepers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3802
02:48:48.020 --> 02:48:53.020
<v Speaker 3>but they were also not necessarily like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was the Christ himself,</v>

3803
02:48:53.060 --> 02:48:58.060
<v Speaker 3>the mighty son of God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were a bit more practical in their </v>

3804
02:48:58.060 --> 02:48:59.110
<v Speaker 3>telling of the tale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3805
02:48:59.180 --> 02:49:01.160
<v Speaker 3>Didn't religion it up quite so much.</v>

3806
02:49:01.310 --> 02:49:06.310
<v Speaker 3>If you had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could go back to a time and </v>

3807
02:49:06.310 --> 02:49:09.041
<v Speaker 3>observe life like being like a giant </v>
<v Speaker 3>bulletproof hamster wheel and observe </v>

3808
02:49:10.201 --> 02:49:13.860
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you go to the dinosaur era and see</v>

3809
02:49:13.861 --> 02:49:18.861
<v Speaker 3>like live t rexes running around and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and predators and crazy thick atmosphere</v>

3810
02:49:20.161 --> 02:49:23.640
<v Speaker 3>and heavy vegetation of pre 65 million </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago?</v>

3811
02:49:23.850 --> 02:49:28.850
<v Speaker 3>Or would you go and watch people from </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 5,000</v>

3812
02:49:29.131 --> 02:49:30.690
<v Speaker 3>years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We get one shot,</v>

3813
02:49:30.930 --> 02:49:32.470
<v Speaker 3>one shot either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3814
02:49:32.480 --> 02:49:36.310
<v Speaker 3>does the dinosaurs because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen Jurassic Park and then realize</v>

3815
02:49:36.450 --> 02:49:39.560
<v Speaker 3>there's probably aren't going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>nearly as impressive as of you.</v>

3816
02:49:40.260 --> 02:49:42.000
<v Speaker 3>That being said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jurassic Park,</v>

3817
02:49:42.001 --> 02:49:44.140
<v Speaker 3>you see that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3818
02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:47.720
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to the.</v>

3819
02:49:47.790 --> 02:49:52.790
<v Speaker 3>I go to the Christ era because that </v>
<v Speaker 3>might solve a lot of problems if I can </v>

3820
02:49:52.981 --> 02:49:57.630
<v Speaker 3>come back and be like he was real and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>turns out he was the son of God.</v>

3821
02:49:58.860 --> 02:50:01.980
<v Speaker 3>Let's listen to the clerks guy time </v>
<v Speaker 3>travel.</v>

3822
02:50:01.990 --> 02:50:04.350
<v Speaker 3>He thinks he knows everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got fooled by magician brow.</v>

3823
02:50:04.380 --> 02:50:09.380
<v Speaker 3>Who's the guy who literally a WHO's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's telling us that the Sphinx is </v>

3824
02:50:09.380 --> 02:50:13.371
<v Speaker 3>older than it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody's got to put their neck out </v>

3825
02:50:13.371 --> 02:50:13.371
<v Speaker 3>there sometimes and I'd be willing to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy to do.</v>

3826
02:50:13.371 --> 02:50:14.580
<v Speaker 3>John.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anthony West was the guy.</v>

3827
02:50:14.880 --> 02:50:16.440
<v Speaker 3>He's dead now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just died recently.</v>

3828
02:50:16.620 --> 02:50:17.430
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3829
02:50:17.460 --> 02:50:22.460
<v Speaker 3>John Anthony West.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought this is the guy who's kind of </v>

3830
02:50:22.460 --> 02:50:22.460
<v Speaker 3>Robert Schoch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm talking.</v>

3831
02:50:22.460 --> 02:50:22.680
<v Speaker 3>He's another one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the geologists.</v>

3832
02:50:22.890 --> 02:50:25.920
<v Speaker 3>John Anthony West was the guy who was </v>
<v Speaker 3>making all these dvds about it.</v>

3833
02:50:25.921 --> 02:50:29.220
<v Speaker 3>He's a really serious egyptologists that</v>
<v Speaker 3>just passed away,</v>

3834
02:50:29.240 --> 02:50:34.240
<v Speaker 3>passed away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the one who's really trying to put </v>

3835
02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:34.240
<v Speaker 3>these old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>old age answer.</v>

3836
02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:37.360
<v Speaker 3>So he was the one that first flow the </v>
<v Speaker 3>theory that leg hippie older than you.</v>

3837

<v Speaker 3>magical Egypt.</v>

3839
02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:44.250
<v Speaker 3>It's phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's got a two,</v>

3840
02:50:44.520 --> 02:50:46.500
<v Speaker 3>one and two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really only watched one,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like really just wrapping my head around</v>

3853
02:51:21.271 --> 02:51:25.740
<v Speaker 3>the concept of civilizations collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then a thousand years later rebuilds</v>

3854
02:51:25.741 --> 02:51:30.741
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then do you think about what the </v>

3855
02:51:30.741 --> 02:51:30.741
<v Speaker 3>United States was like 500 years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was non existent.</v>

3856
02:51:30.741 --> 02:51:35.691
<v Speaker 3>And now look at what it is now that </v>
<v Speaker 3>these great moments of change happen </v>

3857
02:51:35.691 --> 02:51:38.220
<v Speaker 3>periodically in human history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in places where there's a lot</v>

3858
02:51:38.221 --> 02:51:43.221
<v Speaker 3>of commerce and there's a lot of food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the rich vast wilderness and a </v>

3859
02:51:46.190 --> 02:51:51.190
<v Speaker 3>river is filled with fish and places </v>
<v Speaker 3>where people could get enough food and </v>

3860
02:51:51.190 --> 02:51:53.610
<v Speaker 3>they would build these cities and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they start inventing shit and innovating</v>

3861
02:51:53.611 --> 02:51:55.290
<v Speaker 3>and 100 years later they'd be better.</v>

3862
02:51:55.440 --> 02:51:56.970
<v Speaker 3>Two hundred years later they'd be better</v>
<v Speaker 3>than that.</v>

3863
02:51:57.060 --> 02:52:02.060
<v Speaker 3>Five hundred years later they'd have </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy structures and then they'll be </v>

3864
02:52:02.060 --> 02:52:03.330
<v Speaker 3>building things and apparently this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>what it was like in the Nile Valley when</v>

3865
02:52:03.331 --> 02:52:08.331
<v Speaker 3>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they were constructing all these </v>

3866
02:52:08.331 --> 02:52:08.331
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just a bounty of food.</v>

3867
02:52:08.331 --> 02:52:10.840
<v Speaker 3>And then somebody just shook it like an </v>
<v Speaker 3>etch a sketch or climate change.</v>

3868
02:52:10.841 --> 02:52:12.390
<v Speaker 3>That's the real theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>

3869
02:52:12.430 --> 02:52:17.430
<v Speaker 3>Rehab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because this is what they're saying </v>

3870
02:52:17.430 --> 02:52:17.500
<v Speaker 3>about the Nile Valley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that before 9,000</v>

3871
02:52:17.501 --> 02:52:20.650
<v Speaker 3>years ago it was our tropical rain </v>
<v Speaker 3>forest and now it's all.</v>

3872
02:52:21.090 --> 02:52:26.090
<v Speaker 3>It's all sand and desert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But before that it was like fucking </v>

3873
02:52:26.090 --> 02:52:28.830
<v Speaker 3>trees and just the climate changes </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether we fuck with it and make a </v>

3874
02:52:28.830 --> 02:52:30.280
<v Speaker 3>change faster or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not stable.</v>

3875
02:52:30.310 --> 02:52:32.770
<v Speaker 3>It's constantly going up and down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3876
02:52:32.771 --> 02:52:37.771
<v Speaker 3>and so this is probably also partially </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible for what happened to those </v>

3877
02:52:37.771 --> 02:52:40.921
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those people had taken shit to a </v>

3878
02:52:40.921 --> 02:52:42.460
<v Speaker 3>another level man more so they need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>go there and give them.</v>

3879
02:52:42.460 --> 02:52:47.460
<v Speaker 3>Because I've only been watching dvds and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm scared of going to Egypt because </v>

3880
02:52:47.460 --> 02:52:49.510
<v Speaker 3>it's sometimes it's a little unstable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but man,</v>

3881
02:52:49.511 --> 02:52:54.511
<v Speaker 3>what it must be like to see these 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking year old gigantic stone </v>

3882
02:52:54.701 --> 02:52:59.701
<v Speaker 3>structures that were cut and moved by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows how many people and who knows </v>

3883
02:52:59.701 --> 02:53:02.050
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just have theories.</v>

3884
02:53:02.170 --> 02:53:04.480
<v Speaker 3>There's just guesses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know.</v>

3885
02:53:05.020 --> 02:53:07.240
<v Speaker 3>There's no hieroglyphic wall that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3886
02:53:07.241 --> 02:53:09.010
<v Speaker 3>here's the real story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>

3887
02:53:09.011 --> 02:53:14.011
<v Speaker 3>I mean the problem was they think that a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of the information was in the </v>

3888
02:53:14.011 --> 02:53:14.110
<v Speaker 3>library of Alexandria was written down </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

3889
02:53:14.111 --> 02:53:19.111
<v Speaker 3>was burned when they were conquered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they don't really know.</v>

3890
02:53:20.260 --> 02:53:22.720
<v Speaker 3>Don't really know how they made them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of good guesses.</v>

3891
02:53:22.770 --> 02:53:24.730
<v Speaker 3>A lot of good theories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but fuck,</v>

3892
02:53:24.731 --> 02:53:29.731
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about millions of stones </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're huge and like how long did </v>

3893
02:53:29.731 --> 02:53:31.810
<v Speaker 3>this take?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say if you cut in place 10 of those</v>

3894
02:53:31.811 --> 02:53:36.811
<v Speaker 3>massive stones a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would take you 664 years to make the </v>

3895
02:53:36.811 --> 02:53:39.260
<v Speaker 3>great pyramid and we're all.</v>

3896
02:53:39.260 --> 02:53:42.640
<v Speaker 3>We know how long it took.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just what,</v>

3897
02:53:42.820 --> 02:53:44.140
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say that again.</v>

3898
02:53:44.470 --> 02:53:49.000
<v Speaker 3>10 of those massive stones a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would take you 600,</v>

3899
02:53:49.001 --> 02:53:52.630
<v Speaker 3>64 years to build all the great pyramid </v>
<v Speaker 3>to build just a great parent of Giza.</v>

3900
02:53:52.631 --> 02:53:53.710
<v Speaker 3>Just that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just that one.</v>

3901
02:53:53.711 --> 02:53:58.711
<v Speaker 3>Just that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whoever commissioned it certainly </v>

3902
02:53:58.711 --> 02:54:01.651
<v Speaker 3>wasn't around to see it 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless they had some wizard magic shit </v>

3903
02:54:01.651 --> 02:54:03.730
<v Speaker 3>that we're not aware of and they did it </v>
<v Speaker 3>way quicker than we think they did.</v>

3904
02:54:04.030 --> 02:54:09.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows how long they it took them to </v>

3905
02:54:09.030 --> 02:54:09.030
<v Speaker 3>build.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't really know.</v>

3906
02:54:09.030 --> 02:54:09.030
<v Speaker 3>It might've been a thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3907
02:54:09.030 --> 02:54:13.890
<v Speaker 3>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where do you stand on the faith or what </v>

3908
02:54:13.890 --> 02:54:15.280
<v Speaker 3>happens in your estimation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We die.</v>

3909
02:54:15.281 --> 02:54:17.710
<v Speaker 3>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't know.</v>

3910
02:54:17.980 --> 02:54:20.920
<v Speaker 3>And I think in that regard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm right there with everybody.</v>

3911
02:54:21.040 --> 02:54:26.040
<v Speaker 3>I think you can have your ideas and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think those ideas can strengthen your </v>

3912
02:54:26.040 --> 02:54:26.230
<v Speaker 3>resolve in this life and they could even</v>
<v Speaker 3>help you.</v>

3913
02:54:26.560 --> 02:54:28.990
<v Speaker 3>And this is something that I had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>accept as I got older.</v>

3914
02:54:29.020 --> 02:54:30.100
<v Speaker 3>More of the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3915
02:54:30.101 --> 02:54:32.740
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do I have this reaction?</v>

3916
02:54:32.770 --> 02:54:33.880
<v Speaker 3>Like there's certain people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3917
02:54:33.881 --> 02:54:35.370
<v Speaker 3>these ardent atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

3918
02:54:35.380 --> 02:54:36.880
<v Speaker 3>God is dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no god.</v>

3919
02:54:36.881 --> 02:54:38.080
<v Speaker 3>Shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

3920
02:54:38.081 --> 02:54:40.990
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you know?</v>

3921
02:54:41.050 --> 02:54:45.010
<v Speaker 3>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even though logic would point,</v>

3922
02:54:45.050 --> 02:54:48.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you really paid attention to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way human beings tell stories,</v>

3923
02:54:48.671 --> 02:54:53.671
<v Speaker 3>you would have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well a lot of these religious stories </v>

3924
02:54:53.671 --> 02:54:54.550
<v Speaker 3>are probably fabricated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe there was an initial message or</v>

3925
02:54:54.551 --> 02:54:57.910
<v Speaker 3>maybe there was some wisdom that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people initially stumbled upon.</v>

3926
02:54:57.911 --> 02:55:02.911
<v Speaker 3>They wanted to document it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But whether or not all this came from </v>

3927
02:55:02.911 --> 02:55:02.911
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3928
02:55:02.911 --> 02:55:04.580
<v Speaker 3>the Cain and Abel Shit and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>trick a brother and to kill.</v>

3929
02:55:04.581 --> 02:55:06.130
<v Speaker 3>And another brother like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3930
02:55:06.131 --> 02:55:06.940
<v Speaker 3>I almost got ya.</v>

3931
02:55:07.070 --> 02:55:08.300
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to do it for me.</v>

3932
02:55:08.480 --> 02:55:09.640
<v Speaker 3>You're my boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna.</v>

3933
02:55:09.660 --> 02:55:10.880
<v Speaker 3>Kill your brother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanks man.</v>

3934
02:55:11.060 --> 02:55:16.060
<v Speaker 3>Or this is so many of those stories that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a little more human than it's way </v>

3935
02:55:16.060 --> 02:55:16.060
<v Speaker 3>more godlike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3936
02:55:16.060 --> 02:55:17.330
<v Speaker 3>But does that mean there's No God?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3937
02:55:17.331 --> 02:55:19.110
<v Speaker 3>of course it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't do this.</v>

3938
02:55:19.190 --> 02:55:24.190
<v Speaker 3>This universe is too bizarre for you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>leave anything off the table.</v>

3939
02:55:24.830 --> 02:55:26.950
<v Speaker 3>Any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any possibilities of,</v>

3940
02:55:27.010 --> 02:55:28.820
<v Speaker 3>of what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what created it,</v>

3941
02:55:28.821 --> 02:55:31.730
<v Speaker 3>what sustains it other than scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3942
02:55:31.790 --> 02:55:36.790
<v Speaker 3>you get down to like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most reductionist perspective of </v>

3943
02:55:36.790 --> 02:55:41.681
<v Speaker 3>it's just a series of quarks and gluons </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Adams and an energy and maybe maybe </v>

3944
02:55:43.641 --> 02:55:45.140
<v Speaker 3>it is all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it is just that,</v>

3945
02:55:45.141 --> 02:55:50.141
<v Speaker 3>but maybe that in itself is God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe God is not a material thing,</v>

3946
02:55:50.241 --> 02:55:52.820
<v Speaker 3>but it's a creating force of the entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe itself.</v>

3947
02:55:52.821 --> 02:55:54.890
<v Speaker 3>And it also has good in its heart.</v>

3948
02:55:55.160 --> 02:56:00.160
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe the reason why we love like </v>
<v Speaker 3>hugs and good conversation and,</v>

3949
02:56:00.321 --> 02:56:05.321
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cute puppy and all these different </v>

3950
02:56:05.321 --> 02:56:07.361
<v Speaker 3>things we like love and we'd like </v>
<v Speaker 3>happiness because all these things are </v>

3951
02:56:07.361 --> 02:56:10.841
<v Speaker 3>powerful forces in the universe and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things represent the greater will </v>

3952
02:56:10.841 --> 02:56:15.560
<v Speaker 3>have the creator of whatever it is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes this universe so spectacular.</v>

3953
02:56:15.561 --> 02:56:18.110
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the fuck that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is,</v>

3954
02:56:18.410 --> 02:56:21.050
<v Speaker 3>but anybody who says they know what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is is lying.</v>

3955
02:56:21.740 --> 02:56:26.740
<v Speaker 3>You're lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to trick people so that </v>

3956
02:56:26.740 --> 02:56:29.321
<v Speaker 3>you have the ultimate truth and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't and that's how we control people </v>

3957
02:56:29.321 --> 02:56:31.130
<v Speaker 3>and that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Up until around now it's fine.</v>

3958
02:56:31.220 --> 02:56:33.740
<v Speaker 3>When there was no internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fine with books were scarce.</v>

3959
02:56:33.830 --> 02:56:35.630
<v Speaker 3>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we had to keep order,</v>

3960
02:56:35.631 --> 02:56:36.680
<v Speaker 3>it's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fine,</v>

3961
02:56:36.830 --> 02:56:39.200
<v Speaker 3>but it's not fun anymore because we know</v>
<v Speaker 3>too much now,</v>

3962
02:56:39.290 --> 02:56:43.550
<v Speaker 3>so it doesn't mean that there's no god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it means you definitely.</v>

3963
02:56:43.550 --> 02:56:45.590
<v Speaker 3>This guy that wants the jet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's that?</v>

3964
02:56:45.591 --> 02:56:47.890
<v Speaker 3>It's televangelists that wants </v>
<v Speaker 3>$50,000,000</v>

3965
02:56:47.900 --> 02:56:51.710
<v Speaker 3>to buy his own private jet for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy's full of shit.</v>

3966
02:56:52.090 --> 02:56:55.630
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like things that we can and it's</v>

3967
02:56:55.640 --> 02:56:57.500
<v Speaker 3>not even original hustle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3968
02:56:57.501 --> 02:56:59.510
<v Speaker 3>I know what happens after this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give me your money.</v>

3969
02:56:59.540 --> 02:57:01.430
<v Speaker 3>God wants me to be wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he's saying.</v>

3970
02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:06.520
<v Speaker 3>St.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever experienced the afterlife </v>

3971
02:57:06.520 --> 02:57:08.210
<v Speaker 3>yet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've met people that it.</v>

3972
02:57:08.211 --> 02:57:13.211
<v Speaker 3>My belief is that a lot of that can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>attributed to the chemicals that your </v>

3973
02:57:13.211 --> 02:57:15.170
<v Speaker 3>brain is capable of producing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On a regular basis,</v>

3974
02:57:15.171 --> 02:57:20.171
<v Speaker 3>it does while you're sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does what you're into periods of </v>

3975
02:57:20.171 --> 02:57:20.171
<v Speaker 3>extreme stress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3976
02:57:20.171 --> 02:57:24.311
<v Speaker 3>and that all of these different </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemicals most likely are released in </v>

3977
02:57:24.311 --> 02:57:28.151
<v Speaker 3>the brain during these overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 3>periods of anxiety and fear and terror </v>

3978
02:57:28.761 --> 02:57:31.050
<v Speaker 3>and injury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when your body is thinking,</v>

3979
02:57:31.130 --> 02:57:32.330
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this might be it,</v>

3980
02:57:32.750 --> 02:57:37.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's probably what a lot </v>

3981
02:57:37.750 --> 02:57:39.260
<v Speaker 3>of these near death experiences are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that people are experiencing what you</v>

3982
02:57:39.261 --> 02:57:44.261
<v Speaker 3>would call an endogenous psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience that your brain is releasing </v>

3983
02:57:44.261 --> 02:57:46.310
<v Speaker 3>these potent chemicals that it has.</v>

3984
02:57:46.550 --> 02:57:51.550
<v Speaker 3>It absolutely has inside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your brain has a ton of different things</v>

3985
02:57:51.741 --> 02:57:54.710
<v Speaker 3>like dimethyltryptamine and different </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic chemicals.</v>

3986
02:57:54.711 --> 02:57:56.960
<v Speaker 3>It's capable of producing as well as </v>
<v Speaker 3>Melatonin,</v>

3987
02:57:56.961 --> 02:57:58.250
<v Speaker 3>dopamine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Serotonin,</v>

3988
02:57:58.430 --> 02:57:59.720
<v Speaker 3>adrenaline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cortisol.</v>

3989
02:57:59.730 --> 02:58:04.730
<v Speaker 3>There's here's a fucking storm of shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on in your brain and in the moment</v>

3990
02:58:05.041 --> 02:58:05.520
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3991
02:58:05.620 --> 02:58:10.620
<v Speaker 3>a moment like Jack's it all out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pumps it through your fucking neurons </v>

3992
02:58:10.861 --> 02:58:15.861
<v Speaker 3>and everything's firing and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing things that aren't there and </v>

3993
02:58:15.861 --> 02:58:18.891
<v Speaker 3>you're talking to dead relatives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your imagine the pearly gates and your </v>

3994
02:58:18.891 --> 02:58:20.310
<v Speaker 3>imagination is on 10 and you just see </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3995
02:58:20.311 --> 02:58:23.040
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the reductionist perspective.</v>

3996
02:58:23.490 --> 02:58:24.210
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3997
02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:29.240
<v Speaker 3>the hopeful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>optimistic spiritual woo perspective is </v>

3998
02:58:29.240 --> 02:58:33.410
<v Speaker 3>this is a chemical gateway and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing through the door of the other </v>

3999
02:58:33.410 --> 02:58:35.010
<v Speaker 3>side and then when they decide it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>your time yet,</v>

4000
02:58:35.280 --> 02:58:40.280
<v Speaker 3>you're sucked back to where you lie and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're allowed to resume this life </v>

4001
02:58:40.591 --> 02:58:45.591
<v Speaker 3>because you have more work to do and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the perspective that a lot of </v>

4002
02:58:45.591 --> 02:58:45.591
<v Speaker 3>people feel when they come out of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>

4003
02:58:45.591 --> 02:58:46.740
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They feel like I have more work to do.</v>

4004
02:58:46.741 --> 02:58:47.580
<v Speaker 3>I can't stop now.</v>

4005
02:58:47.940 --> 02:58:50.280
<v Speaker 1>My mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

4006
02:58:50.340 --> 02:58:51.570
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 10 years ago,</v>

4007
02:58:51.630 --> 02:58:53.790
<v Speaker 1>more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even moved 15 years ago at this point,</v>

4008
02:58:53.800 --> 02:58:57.120
<v Speaker 1>I had a heart attack or a heart episode </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather.</v>

4009
02:58:57.121 --> 02:59:02.121
<v Speaker 1>My Dad died of a heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my mom was on the table and they </v>

4010
02:59:02.121 --> 02:59:05.121
<v Speaker 1>were putting a stent into her heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into an artery and she was sitting there</v>

4011
02:59:05.510 --> 02:59:07.920
<v Speaker 1>chitchatting while they were doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery.</v>

4012
02:59:07.921 --> 02:59:10.110
<v Speaker 1>I guess she was on a local more so than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything else.</v>

4013
02:59:10.920 --> 02:59:12.810
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was joking around with the doctor.</v>

4014
02:59:12.811 --> 02:59:14.170
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric got hurry up doc,</v>

4015
02:59:14.190 --> 02:59:18.710
<v Speaker 1>because I got to pickup my mom for the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then went out well on.</v>

4016
02:59:18.760 --> 02:59:22.160
<v Speaker 1>So she died for a minute and a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinically fucking dead,</v>

4017
02:59:22.210 --> 02:59:26.580
<v Speaker 1>that fucking try to restart the art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

4018
02:59:26.581 --> 02:59:27.630
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

4019
02:59:27.631 --> 02:59:29.490
<v Speaker 1>just what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

4020
02:59:30.510 --> 02:59:32.580
<v Speaker 1>And she didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

4021
02:59:32.610 --> 02:59:34.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't describe a guy saw the bright</v>

4022
02:59:34.741 --> 02:59:36.510
<v Speaker 1>lights and I saw people and Blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>

4023
02:59:37.380 --> 02:59:40.020
<v Speaker 1>She said I was floating and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>floating up.</v>

4024
02:59:40.021 --> 02:59:41.760
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no floating on my back.</v>

4025
02:59:42.240 --> 02:59:43.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4026
02:59:43.231 --> 02:59:45.240
<v Speaker 1>while you were on your back in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital,</v>

4027
02:59:45.390 --> 02:59:46.950
<v Speaker 1>do you think that's what it was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

4028
02:59:47.610 --> 02:59:48.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is,</v>

4029
02:59:48.960 --> 02:59:53.960
<v Speaker 1>this is what I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every iota of responsibility I ever felt</v>

4030
02:59:56.311 --> 02:59:58.920
<v Speaker 1>in my life was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

4031
02:59:58.921 --> 03:00:03.921
<v Speaker 1>I felt free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt instantly lighter and just as I </v>

4032
03:00:06.151 --> 03:00:11.151
<v Speaker 1>was heading in a direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when like they pulled her back so</v>

4033
03:00:12.151 --> 03:00:14.300
<v Speaker 1>she'd been dead for like a minute and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>half hearted stuff.</v>

4034
03:00:14.790 --> 03:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

4035
03:00:17.310 --> 03:00:21.750
<v Speaker 1>you been in this best of all possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>worlds for fucking 60 plus years.</v>

4036
03:00:22.350 --> 03:00:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Now you've seen a glimpse of the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

4037
03:00:26.040 --> 03:00:31.040
<v Speaker 1>which is better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my mom said the other side and I </v>

4038
03:00:31.040 --> 03:00:31.040
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

4039
03:00:31.040 --> 03:00:31.920
<v Speaker 1>What you were there for like a minute </v>
<v Speaker 1>and change why?</v>

4040
03:00:32.550 --> 03:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>And she said I was completely fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

4041
03:00:36.750 --> 03:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Like that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

4042
03:00:38.821 --> 03:00:41.670
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to care for this one.</v>

4043
03:00:41.700 --> 03:00:43.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to make sure this doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of it.</v>

4044
03:00:43.380 --> 03:00:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I have to feed the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

4045
03:00:45.060 --> 03:00:47.150
<v Speaker 1>it was bliss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like in.</v>

4046
03:00:47.151 --> 03:00:49.620
<v Speaker 1>If that's what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I look forward to that again.</v>

4047
03:00:49.920 --> 03:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>So when I have my shit three months ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the doctor was like,</v>

4048
03:00:54.301 --> 03:00:59.301
<v Speaker 1>you got a 20 percent chance to live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting there going through all </v>

4049
03:00:59.301 --> 03:01:00.580
<v Speaker 1>the fucking shit in my head about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

4050
03:01:00.581 --> 03:01:02.020
<v Speaker 1>well this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a fucking.</v>

4051
03:01:02.021 --> 03:01:04.210
<v Speaker 1>You've spent your life with your head up</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ass,</v>

4052
03:01:04.260 --> 03:01:09.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking trying to figure out who you </v>

4053
03:01:09.260 --> 03:01:09.260
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead,</v>

4054
03:01:09.260 --> 03:01:09.550
<v Speaker 1>look at your head and heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is your.</v>

4055
03:01:09.551 --> 03:01:10.900
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the big moment.</v>

4056
03:01:10.930 --> 03:01:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Like what are your thoughts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going through?</v>

4057
03:01:12.640 --> 03:01:14.770
<v Speaker 1>And now Dina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm such a chicken shit in live.</v>

4058
03:01:14.771 --> 03:01:16.750
<v Speaker 1>I assume that I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy was like,</v>

4059
03:01:16.751 --> 03:01:20.200
<v Speaker 1>I'll fucking suck your dick to stay in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this life because I know this live and I</v>

4060
03:01:20.201 --> 03:01:21.910
<v Speaker 1>don't know what happens afterwards and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

4061
03:01:22.480 --> 03:01:24.860
<v Speaker 1>So I thought I'd be begging for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4062
03:01:25.090 --> 03:01:26.920
<v Speaker 1>for help from God or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

4063
03:01:26.921 --> 03:01:27.970
<v Speaker 1>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made dog,</v>

4064
03:01:27.971 --> 03:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure Jesus would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to hell.</v>

4065
03:01:29.591 --> 03:01:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you buddy Christ my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of doing the Gi,</v>

4066
03:01:33.130 --> 03:01:38.130
<v Speaker 1>the religious thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started thinking about just the </v>

4067
03:01:38.130 --> 03:01:38.770
<v Speaker 1>journey itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4068
03:01:38.771 --> 03:01:39.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the journey is ending,</v>

4069
03:01:41.410 --> 03:01:46.410
<v Speaker 1>what are your thoughts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like when the day held up the </v>

4070
03:01:46.410 --> 03:01:46.410
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

4071
03:01:46.410 --> 03:01:46.480
<v Speaker 1>do you want to talk to your wife?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

4072
03:01:46.481 --> 03:01:49.780
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course I did,</v>

4073
03:01:50.470 --> 03:01:54.000
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't want to because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know in my heart of hearts finance,</v>

4074
03:01:54.010 --> 03:01:57.810
<v Speaker 1>if I speak to my wife right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be in the 21st.</v>

4075
03:01:57.850 --> 03:01:59.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had been the 80 percent,</v>

4076
03:01:59.710 --> 03:02:03.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fucking drop dead because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the intensity of it.</v>

4077
03:02:03.940 --> 03:02:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Not even like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

4078
03:02:05.441 --> 03:02:08.020
<v Speaker 1>it's killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just the way they were,</v>

4079
03:02:08.021 --> 03:02:10.900
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want your wife is on the phone,</v>

4080
03:02:11.110 --> 03:02:16.110
<v Speaker 1>do you want to speak to her right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was very leading and you know,</v>

4081
03:02:16.510 --> 03:02:21.510
<v Speaker 1>they're professionals and these cats </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with life and death every day and </v>

4082
03:02:21.510 --> 03:02:23.170
<v Speaker 1>this was my first experience with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I got out of it was you probably</v>

4083
03:02:23.171 --> 03:02:26.650
<v Speaker 1>going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was what they felt and it's still,</v>

4084
03:02:26.651 --> 03:02:31.651
<v Speaker 1>I was in the state of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even realize I was having a </v>

4085
03:02:31.651 --> 03:02:31.930
<v Speaker 1>heart attack and so I remember looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the phone and being like,</v>

4086
03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:34.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I answered,</v>

4087
03:02:34.430 --> 03:02:35.960
<v Speaker 1>if I talked to Jennifer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be,</v>

4088
03:02:36.020 --> 03:02:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to leave this room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

4089
03:02:38.260 --> 03:02:40.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to play the odds if I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to Jennifer.</v>

4090
03:02:41.380 --> 03:02:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's some part of me that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

4091
03:02:43.050 --> 03:02:44.230
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like talking to Jennifer.</v>

4092
03:02:44.231 --> 03:02:47.290
<v Speaker 1>We've been together 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I better enjoy talking to Jennifer.</v>

4093
03:02:48.220 --> 03:02:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if I put this phone call off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4094
03:02:51.790 --> 03:02:54.700
<v Speaker 1>they don't get to talk to Jennifer when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all fucking done.</v>

4095
03:02:54.701 --> 03:02:56.020
<v Speaker 1>So I said to the dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4096
03:02:56.021 --> 03:02:58.960
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell our our color back and the guy goes</v>

4097
03:02:58.961 --> 03:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

4098
03:03:00.101 --> 03:03:02.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I saw him talking and got a phone.</v>

4099
03:03:02.761 --> 03:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

4100
03:03:03.191 --> 03:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

4101
03:03:03.851 --> 03:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>she was fucking pissed dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

4102
03:03:06.461 --> 03:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm dealing with my own shit right now.</v>

4103
03:03:08.800 --> 03:03:13.800
<v Speaker 1>So I was laying there on the table and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like going through my life and I was</v>

4104
03:03:14.141 --> 03:03:16.750
<v Speaker 1>more grateful than anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't scared anymore.</v>

4105
03:03:16.751 --> 03:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>That was the thing as the love thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I love to communicate.</v>

4106
03:03:19.890 --> 03:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Spent my whole life terrified a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>dying.</v>

4107
03:03:23.380 --> 03:03:28.380
<v Speaker 1>And when I was closest to it as I ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew I was and for all I know I was </v>

4108
03:03:28.811 --> 03:03:31.450
<v Speaker 1>closer to someplace but like I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognizant,</v>

4109
03:03:31.630 --> 03:03:35.290
<v Speaker 1>been told by a professional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking risky.</v>

4110
03:03:36.850 --> 03:03:39.850
<v Speaker 1>I was just Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was grateful more than anything else.</v>

4111
03:03:39.851 --> 03:03:41.680
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a fucking journey.</v>

4112
03:03:41.800 --> 03:03:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm 47 and it seems short,</v>

4113
03:03:43.991 --> 03:03:48.400
<v Speaker 1>but fucking like you gotTa admit you did</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than fucking most people get to do.</v>

4114
03:03:48.401 --> 03:03:53.401
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's why it happened at an </v>
<v Speaker 1>early age because you weren't going to </v>

4115
03:03:53.401 --> 03:03:53.401
<v Speaker 1>get the rest of this time and shit like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

4116
03:03:53.710 --> 03:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>But like I wasn't mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't like fucking wise.</v>

4117
03:03:56.730 --> 03:03:59.580
<v Speaker 1>This is unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remembered like a,</v>

4118
03:03:59.581 --> 03:04:04.581
<v Speaker 1>there's a issue of Sandman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I absolutely love Neil Gaiman's </v>

4119
03:04:04.581 --> 03:04:06.350
<v Speaker 1>comic book series back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

4120
03:04:06.351 --> 03:04:07.130
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

4121
03:04:07.131 --> 03:04:09.920
<v Speaker 1>like after the first story arc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

4122
03:04:10.020 --> 03:04:13.820
<v Speaker 1>we meet his sister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main character's dream,</v>

4123
03:04:13.821 --> 03:04:18.821
<v Speaker 1>morpheus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>character of dream is part of the </v>

4124
03:04:18.821 --> 03:04:18.821
<v Speaker 1>endless.</v>

4125
03:04:18.821 --> 03:04:20.210
<v Speaker 1>And he's got two other siblings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>delirium,</v>

4126
03:04:20.211 --> 03:04:21.800
<v Speaker 1>desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of his siblings,</v>

4127
03:04:21.801 --> 03:04:25.040
<v Speaker 1>his death and they represent death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the comic book,</v>

4128
03:04:25.520 --> 03:04:30.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're used to seeing the fucking sky </v>

4129
03:04:30.520 --> 03:04:31.130
<v Speaker 1>than the fucking grim reaper and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the little,</v>

4130
03:04:31.150 --> 03:04:33.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emo girl,</v>

4131
03:04:33.411 --> 03:04:36.170
<v Speaker 1>goth girl wearing a knock around her </v>
<v Speaker 1>neck and shit like that.</v>

4132
03:04:36.171 --> 03:04:41.171
<v Speaker 1>It was written in the nineties and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't tell you right away that she's </v>

4133
03:04:41.171 --> 03:04:41.171
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you're reading the issue,</v>

4134
03:04:41.171 --> 03:04:41.480
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

4135
03:04:41.690 --> 03:04:46.690
<v Speaker 1>I think she's meant to be death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's fairing soles over to the other </v>

4136
03:04:46.690 --> 03:04:49.811
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see a baby passed and she's holding </v>

4137
03:04:49.811 --> 03:04:49.811
<v Speaker 1>the baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the,</v>

4138
03:04:49.811 --> 03:04:50.780
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the refrain is like the,</v>

4139
03:04:50.830 --> 03:04:55.830
<v Speaker 1>I hear the sound of her wings and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking this soul over to the next place </v>

4140
03:04:55.830 --> 03:04:57.740
<v Speaker 1>as she's sitting around talking to her </v>
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>

4141
03:04:58.550 --> 03:05:03.550
<v Speaker 1>And so she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she eventually gets into a room with </v>

4142
03:05:03.550 --> 03:05:03.770
<v Speaker 1>this older guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4143
03:05:03.860 --> 03:05:05.150
<v Speaker 1>who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are you?</v>

4144
03:05:05.150 --> 03:05:05.810
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

4145
03:05:05.811 --> 03:05:07.070
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here for you.</v>

4146
03:05:07.071 --> 03:05:07.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

4147
03:05:07.651 --> 03:05:08.630
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

4148
03:05:09.050 --> 03:05:10.130
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

4149
03:05:10.131 --> 03:05:13.520
<v Speaker 1>I did all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked my fingers to the bone and what</v>

4150
03:05:13.521 --> 03:05:14.930
<v Speaker 1>did I get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is at,</v>

4151
03:05:14.960 --> 03:05:16.610
<v Speaker 1>what did I get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she says,</v>

4152
03:05:16.640 --> 03:05:18.950
<v Speaker 1>you align that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I read it,</v>

4153
03:05:18.951 --> 03:05:20.600
<v Speaker 1>when I was 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was powerful.</v>

4154
03:05:20.601 --> 03:05:22.310
<v Speaker 1>But when I was laying on the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>table,</v>

4155
03:05:22.640 --> 03:05:27.110
<v Speaker 1>it was constantly going through my head </v>
<v Speaker 1>and made it all easier.</v>

4156
03:05:27.140 --> 03:05:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Made me kind of at peace with the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>of dying.</v>

4157
03:05:29.540 --> 03:05:31.280
<v Speaker 1>There's this line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she says to the guy,</v>

4158
03:05:31.281 --> 03:05:32.060
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>

4159
03:05:32.150 --> 03:05:34.190
<v Speaker 1>you got what everybody gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a lifetime.</v>

4160
03:05:34.760 --> 03:05:36.050
<v Speaker 1>And as I was laying there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4161
03:05:36.051 --> 03:05:37.370
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a lifetime.</v>

4162
03:05:37.371 --> 03:05:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it was.</v>

4163
03:05:39.230 --> 03:05:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Nothing more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing fucking less than I did some </v>

4164
03:05:44.230 --> 03:05:46.691
<v Speaker 1>shit in it and now it's going to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are going to go on without </v>

4165
03:05:46.691 --> 03:05:46.691
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

4166
03:05:46.691 --> 03:05:49.910
<v Speaker 1>And that's not terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

4167
03:05:49.911 --> 03:05:54.911
<v Speaker 1>I thought I'd be fucking desperate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live and instead I had that weird s like</v>

4168
03:05:55.400 --> 03:05:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understood what my mother said for the</v>

4169
03:05:57.411 --> 03:05:59.450
<v Speaker 1>first time because I was laying there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4170
03:05:59.480 --> 03:06:01.310
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I made it to the end,</v>

4171
03:06:01.550 --> 03:06:03.290
<v Speaker 1>like this is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the finish line.</v>

4172
03:06:03.291 --> 03:06:06.320
<v Speaker 1>And it had been something that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified of ever getting to.</v>

4173
03:06:06.590 --> 03:06:08.330
<v Speaker 1>But then when really kind of faced with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

4174
03:06:08.331 --> 03:06:09.620
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4175
03:06:10.040 --> 03:06:13.040
<v Speaker 1>like I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not scared that I'm done.</v>

4176
03:06:13.310 --> 03:06:16.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually kind of relieved that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>done and like,</v>

4177
03:06:16.400 --> 03:06:21.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking like I didn't get killed and I </v>

4178
03:06:21.400 --> 03:06:22.010
<v Speaker 1>wasn't home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>invaded a shark,</v>

4179
03:06:22.011 --> 03:06:23.360
<v Speaker 1>didn't eat me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4180
03:06:23.630 --> 03:06:26.840
<v Speaker 1>all the things that like I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified of my entire life,</v>

4181
03:06:27.350 --> 03:06:29.030
<v Speaker 1>like I don't have to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

4182
03:06:29.031 --> 03:06:32.030
<v Speaker 1>I made it to the end and it's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

4183
03:06:32.450 --> 03:06:34.370
<v Speaker 1>So it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My whole life I thought like,</v>

4184
03:06:34.430 --> 03:06:39.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be scared to death and most people </v>

4185
03:06:39.430 --> 03:06:41.201
<v Speaker 1>we all are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all terrified of fucking dying </v>

4186
03:06:41.201 --> 03:06:41.201
<v Speaker 1>because we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the closest I ever came and I</v>

4187
03:06:41.201 --> 03:06:45.821
<v Speaker 1>wasn't scared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like suddenly the fear just went away </v>

4188
03:06:45.821 --> 03:06:46.800
<v Speaker 1>and it seemed logical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like of course it's over like things end</v>

4189
03:06:46.910 --> 03:06:49.070
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't want to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't,</v>

4190
03:06:49.071 --> 03:06:50.690
<v Speaker 1>didn't have a death wish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

4191
03:06:51.250 --> 03:06:53.170
<v Speaker 1>if it's done it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>

4192
03:06:53.290 --> 03:06:57.420
<v Speaker 1>it's done and count your blessings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>be happy and don't be a bitch.</v>

4193
03:06:57.421 --> 03:07:02.421
<v Speaker 1>Like don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the fucking fairy man shows up </v>

4194
03:07:02.421 --> 03:07:02.790
<v Speaker 1>tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't fucking hold out.</v>

4195
03:07:02.791 --> 03:07:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Don't be the last asshole at the party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>

4196
03:07:04.501 --> 03:07:07.240
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just fucking pay the ferryman.</v>

4197
03:07:07.260 --> 03:07:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Get on a boat and go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see what's next and stuff.</v>

4198
03:07:10.050 --> 03:07:15.050
<v Speaker 1>And then ultimately in time did a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>job and I fucking wound up living and </v>

4199
03:07:15.050 --> 03:07:15.050
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

4200
03:07:15.050 --> 03:07:19.130
<v Speaker 1>So I know this much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to read a bunch of shit like after</v>

4201
03:07:19.231 --> 03:07:24.231
<v Speaker 1>I nearly died and it was all nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People wrote very nice things about me </v>

4202
03:07:24.231 --> 03:07:24.231
<v Speaker 1>and shit and I expected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4203
03:07:24.231 --> 03:07:25.920
<v Speaker 1>the creature of the Internet that some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people would be like,</v>

4204
03:07:25.921 --> 03:07:28.350
<v Speaker 1>I wish he had fucking died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck them to death and shit.</v>

4205
03:07:28.590 --> 03:07:33.590
<v Speaker 1>I wish he'd stay silent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but generally it was like very nice </v>

4206
03:07:33.590 --> 03:07:34.080
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were kind of positive and stuff.</v>

4207
03:07:34.710 --> 03:07:36.210
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck man.</v>

4208
03:07:36.211 --> 03:07:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4209
03:07:39.600 --> 03:07:40.950
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to die,</v>

4210
03:07:40.951 --> 03:07:45.180
<v Speaker 1>but like if I had like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would've been okay,</v>

4211
03:07:45.181 --> 03:07:47.130
<v Speaker 1>now I'm back at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4212
03:07:47.131 --> 03:07:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Like now until it ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've got a,</v>

4213
03:07:52.350 --> 03:07:57.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's kind of easy as long as they </v>

4214
03:07:57.350 --> 03:07:57.480
<v Speaker 1>don't wake up with a fucking dead girl </v>
<v Speaker 1>are alive boy,</v>

4215
03:07:57.481 --> 03:08:02.481
<v Speaker 1>I don't think like they'll fucking broke</v>
<v Speaker 1>me over the coals when I die in the </v>

4216
03:08:02.481 --> 03:08:02.481
<v Speaker 1>future and shit like that.</v>

4217
03:08:02.940 --> 03:08:06.000
<v Speaker 1>But it felt weird to be so close to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>completion.</v>

4218
03:08:06.001 --> 03:08:10.050
<v Speaker 1>And so having something that normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifies you suddenly be like,</v>

4219
03:08:10.080 --> 03:08:11.070
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>

4220
03:08:11.430 --> 03:08:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't if you walked up and put a </v>

4221
03:08:16.430 --> 03:08:16.620
<v Speaker 1>gun in my face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I'd feel threatened,</v>

4222
03:08:16.621 --> 03:08:20.100
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda lost my fear of death.</v>

4223
03:08:20.101 --> 03:08:25.101
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like death defying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't go out and do anything </v>

4224
03:08:25.101 --> 03:08:25.101
<v Speaker 1>differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

4225
03:08:25.440 --> 03:08:28.530
<v Speaker 1>that dark cloud that kind of kills any </v>
<v Speaker 1>good time.</v>

4226
03:08:28.531 --> 03:08:31.650
<v Speaker 1>The moment you start thinking about like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fear and anxiety you're going to die</v>

4227
03:08:31.651 --> 03:08:34.560
<v Speaker 1>one day like you know it's gone and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>will send them like,</v>

4228
03:08:34.561 --> 03:08:39.561
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to die one day and it's going </v>

4229
03:08:39.561 --> 03:08:41.221
<v Speaker 1>to be awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not for the reasons that you think </v>

4230
03:08:41.221 --> 03:08:41.221
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying it's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Awesome.</v>

4231
03:08:41.221 --> 03:08:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Just be awesome because a finish like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nice to finish things.</v>

4232
03:08:43.021 --> 03:08:48.021
<v Speaker 1>We know how good it feels in life to </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete something and that's the </v>

4233
03:08:48.021 --> 03:08:49.200
<v Speaker 1>biggest fucking thing in life you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever complete is your journey.</v>

4234
03:08:49.650 --> 03:08:53.790
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't walk away going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to do more.</v>

4235
03:08:53.820 --> 03:08:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Like I got to fucking live life to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fullest.</v>

4236
03:08:56.490 --> 03:08:58.680
<v Speaker 1>I just got to keep doing what I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

4237
03:08:58.830 --> 03:09:02.670
<v Speaker 1>like living life the way I enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do things.</v>

4238
03:09:02.671 --> 03:09:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they fail and Shit.</v>

4239
03:09:04.980 --> 03:09:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people are on your side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people are you fucking blow </v>

4240
03:09:09.980 --> 03:09:13.050
<v Speaker 1>and just do that fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have good conversations in the process.</v>

4241
03:09:13.051 --> 03:09:18.051
<v Speaker 1>Meet interesting people here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new points of view and shit like that </v>

4242
03:09:18.051 --> 03:09:21.630
<v Speaker 1>and keep at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's nothing to be afraid of.</v>

4243
03:09:22.680 --> 03:09:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get eaten by a cat.</v>

4244
03:09:24.571 --> 03:09:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I guarantee you,</v>

4245
03:09:26.940 --> 03:09:30.270
<v Speaker 1>I would not be philosophical as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking big cat was crushing my,</v>

4246
03:09:30.370 --> 03:09:30.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

4247
03:09:30.970 --> 03:09:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4248
03:09:31.821 --> 03:09:36.821
<v Speaker 1>I find prayer quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but death is no longer something.</v>

4249
03:09:38.310 --> 03:09:41.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm not looking for it and I certainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't put myself in harm's way,</v>

4250
03:09:41.611 --> 03:09:46.611
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't preoccupy me anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been there and it's not the thing </v>

4251
03:09:46.741 --> 03:09:49.650
<v Speaker 1>that I was led to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

4252
03:09:49.651 --> 03:09:51.230
<v Speaker 1>it's not the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4253
03:09:51.520 --> 03:09:54.280
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate fear come true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the grim reaper.</v>

4254
03:09:54.310 --> 03:09:56.410
<v Speaker 2>There's a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in my case,</v>

4255
03:09:56.590 --> 03:09:58.420
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a painful heart attack.</v>

4256
03:09:58.421 --> 03:10:03.421
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure people have heart attacks where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they feel like they're fucking bodies </v>

4257
03:10:03.421 --> 03:10:06.130
<v Speaker 2>being ripped and cleaved in twain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't.</v>

4258
03:10:06.930 --> 03:10:08.320
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't scary.</v>

4259
03:10:08.380 --> 03:10:09.040
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4260
03:10:09.970 --> 03:10:14.970
<v Speaker 2>well listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad you lived because I love you </v>

4261
03:10:14.970 --> 03:10:14.970
<v Speaker 2>and you were one of my favorite things </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

4262
03:10:15.730 --> 03:10:18.280
<v Speaker 2>I always love it and after the heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack I couldn't wait to.</v>

4263
03:10:18.390 --> 03:10:19.900
<v Speaker 2>We started texting and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro,</v>

4264
03:10:19.901 --> 03:10:20.630
<v Speaker 2>you got to come in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

4265
03:10:20.660 --> 03:10:22.600
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to ask.</v>

4266
03:10:22.601 --> 03:10:27.601
<v Speaker 2>Quick Protocol goes like that so more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but listen man,</v>

4267
03:10:28.271 --> 03:10:30.360
<v Speaker 2>you might not make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you think you can get in here?</v>

4268
03:10:31.300 --> 03:10:32.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

4269
03:10:32.630 --> 03:10:37.630
<v Speaker 2>I was happy to be here and stuff as well</v>
<v Speaker 2>as as we all are happy to be above </v>

4270
03:10:37.630 --> 03:10:38.410
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's better than below.</v>

4271
03:10:38.420 --> 03:10:43.420
<v Speaker 2>Grab your perspective to really because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a seeker as well and it means a </v>

4272
03:10:43.991 --> 03:10:48.991
<v Speaker 2>lot to a lot of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to because that's what </v>

4273
03:10:48.991 --> 03:10:48.991
<v Speaker 2>everyone's scared of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4274
03:10:48.991 --> 03:10:48.991
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blows everyone's scared of the ride,</v>

4275
03:10:48.991 --> 03:10:53.641
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we think we're trained to </v>

4276
03:10:53.641 --> 03:10:53.641
<v Speaker 2>think that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every fucking movie,</v>

4277
03:10:53.641 --> 03:10:57.991
<v Speaker 2>every book you read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every song is about like how it'll suck </v>

4278
03:10:57.991 --> 03:10:58.150
<v Speaker 2>when it's over and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that fear can keep you from enjoying</v>

4279
03:10:58.151 --> 03:11:01.090
<v Speaker 2>it while you were living and try and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cool things and stuff like that.</v>

4280
03:11:01.230 --> 03:11:03.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean like putting yourself in </v>
<v Speaker 2>harm's way like let's shoot a movie with</v>

4281
03:11:03.971 --> 03:11:06.700
<v Speaker 2>real lions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's been done.</v>

4282
03:11:06.701 --> 03:11:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Don't try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go watch the video,</v>

4283
03:11:08.231 --> 03:11:12.040
<v Speaker 2>but the things where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd really like to try it like a fucking</v>

4284
03:11:12.041 --> 03:11:12.880
<v Speaker 2>won't work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Ah,</v>

4285
03:11:12.881 --> 03:11:16.150
<v Speaker 2>there's maybe time later as the one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing I did walk away from it,</v>

4286
03:11:16.151 --> 03:11:18.160
<v Speaker 2>like time.</v>

4287
03:11:18.520 --> 03:11:20.920
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking lucky for every goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 2>sec,</v>

4288
03:11:20.950 --> 03:11:24.460
<v Speaker 2>every God second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So use it wisely and think,</v>

4289
03:11:24.461 --> 03:11:26.470
<v Speaker 2>and I think if you could just think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

4290
03:11:26.471 --> 03:11:29.140
<v Speaker 2>like today's a borrowed debt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4291
03:11:29.141 --> 03:11:34.141
<v Speaker 2>you'll have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you have to trick yourself </v>

4292
03:11:34.141 --> 03:11:36.990
<v Speaker 2>into like finding more enthusiasm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to trick yourself to be pumped </v>

4293
03:11:36.990 --> 03:11:38.680
<v Speaker 2>up about stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you can really do that and,</v>

4294
03:11:38.681 --> 03:11:43.681
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and exercise those patterns in your </v>

4295
03:11:43.681 --> 03:11:43.681
<v Speaker 2>brain and get them normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

4296
03:11:43.681 --> 03:11:48.000
<v Speaker 2>there's people that have trick </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves into enjoying all sorts of </v>

4297
03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:51.211
<v Speaker 2>things that they know are good for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just fire up those fucking </v>

4298
03:11:51.211 --> 03:11:54.961
<v Speaker 2>chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And today we're going to just go out </v>

4299
03:11:54.961 --> 03:11:54.961
<v Speaker 2>there and attack this day because this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a gift.</v>

4300
03:11:55.300 --> 03:11:57.190
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't supposed to be here.</v>

4301
