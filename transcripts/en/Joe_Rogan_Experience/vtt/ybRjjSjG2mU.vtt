9
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Just come on down and they would go for a few months,</v>

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.100
<v Speaker 2>make quarter million bucks,</v>

11
00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:22.450

48
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing a Gig in Dubai guys for a whole month.</v>

49
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.640
<v Speaker 1>You just want to be the court jester.</v>

50
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Go over there and crack some jokes,</v>

51
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.151
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

52
00:01:35.151 --> 00:01:37.310
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking crazy.</v>

53
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.720
<v Speaker 1>And you think he wears a condom?</v>

54
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.213
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

55
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.143
<v Speaker 1>no condom.</v>

56
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.013
<v Speaker 1>Shut up.</v>

57
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.310
<v Speaker 1>Why would he do that?</v>

58
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

59
00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:44.210
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

60
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.860
<v Speaker 1>He's just shooting loads of these gals,</v>

61
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.300
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>

62
00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:49.360
<v Speaker 1>he's opening himself up for possible.</v>

63
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.383
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they.</v>

64
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.700
<v Speaker 1>I bet he gets them tested.</v>

65
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.770
<v Speaker 1>He puts him in catapults and shoots him in the air.</v>

66
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 3>I am closer to being Lance Armstrong,</v>

67
00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:00.410
<v Speaker 3>like closest auto diets,</v>

68
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.250
<v Speaker 3>absent carbohydrates,</v>

69
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.320
<v Speaker 3>but I'm still,</v>

70
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

71
00:02:04.681 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 3>now I'm just a bigger individual.</v>

72
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.661
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

73
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:07.351
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>

74
00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about,</v>

75
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.193
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

76
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

77
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.933
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

78
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.960
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to a friend of mine who was a freshman manager of my college</v>

79
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:16.681
<v Speaker 3>football team.</v>

80
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 3>So this was harvard.</v>

81
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:17.971
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

82
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.650
<v Speaker 3>It was division two football.</v>

83
00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:20.970
<v Speaker 3>It was a lot of smart</v>

84
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 3>guys who couldn't make it in division one.</v>

85
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:28.260
<v Speaker 3>We had kids who went to Harvard because they didn't get scholarships at Holy</v>

86
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.261
<v Speaker 3>Cross.</v>

87
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:28.651
<v Speaker 3>So they went,</v>

88
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:28.921
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

89
00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:30.300
<v Speaker 3>I'll play football for Harvard.</v>

90
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:31.134
<v Speaker 3>They were local</v>

91
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.091
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>

92
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:33.924
<v Speaker 3>76.</v>

93
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.711
<v Speaker 3>My senior year,</v>

94
00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:36.540
<v Speaker 3>the biggest kid on our team,</v>

95
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.900
<v Speaker 3>Danny tickets weighed 265 pounds,</v>

96
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.790
<v Speaker 3>six foot five tomorrow standards.</v>

97
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.710
<v Speaker 3>Who was enormous.</v>

98
00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:46.770
<v Speaker 3>He went off to play for the Chicago bears for five or six years.</v>

99
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.260
<v Speaker 3>I think we had one other offenses Lineman who was to 65,</v>

100
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.490
<v Speaker 3>also six,</v>

101
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.740
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>

102
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.040
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

103
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.873
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

104
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 3>maybe two this year.</v>

105
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.300
<v Speaker 3>Harvard football team,</v>

106
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.181
<v Speaker 3>smart kid,</v>

107
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.220
<v Speaker 3>same socioeconomic status.</v>

108
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.070
<v Speaker 3>The entire.</v>

109
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 3>Oftentimes they get,</v>

110
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 3>I think 12 players over 300 pounds.</v>

111
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 3>Jesus cronies guys were enormous.</v>

112
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:09.851
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

113
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 3>there are six,</v>

114
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>

115
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:11.763
<v Speaker 3>300 pounds.</v>

116
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 3>They didn't grow people that big when I was growing up.</v>

117
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean I could say maybe I didn't see him.</v>

118
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they weren't around.</v>

119
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:21.730
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they were six,</v>

120
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 3>seven and they only weighed 2:30 because they weren't being bulked up.</v>

121
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 3>So they were playing basketball instead of football.</v>

122
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean I could imagine ways that that confusing,</v>

123
00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:32.260
<v Speaker 3>but from our perception,</v>

124
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:37.261
<v Speaker 3>if you look just what happened when I was a kid in early 19 sixties as far as I</v>

125
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:39.311
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

126
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:40.144
<v Speaker 3>there was one,</v>

127
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 3>300 pounder in the NFL and afl,</v>

128
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.150
<v Speaker 3>two different leads back then.</v>

129
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 3>Bob De remember his name,</v>

130
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 3>he played for the Boston Patriots and his head was like small compared to his</v>

131
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 3>body and he was a big fat guy.</v>

132
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.590
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

133
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.423
<v Speaker 3>what is there now?</v>

134
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.071
<v Speaker 3>Twenty,</v>

135
00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:58.690
<v Speaker 3>30 per team.</v>

136
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.020
<v Speaker 4>And you're saying like a lot of people are saying no,</v>

137
00:04:01.021 --> 00:04:03.660
<v Speaker 4>there's sciences out because they're spending billions of dollars to do that.</v>

138
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.651
<v Speaker 4>The thing is,</v>

139
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:06.870
<v Speaker 4>is when you are playing such far right,</v>

140
00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:08.430
<v Speaker 4>far left partisan politics,</v>

141
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.410
<v Speaker 4>then you have people saying,</v>

142
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.363
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

143
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

144
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.780
<v Speaker 4>obamacare,</v>

145
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.591
<v Speaker 4>he's a socialist.</v>

146
00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:14.680
<v Speaker 4>He started to take over the government,</v>

147
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:15.270
<v Speaker 4>he's trying to do this,</v>

148
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.610
<v Speaker 4>he's trying to do that and sort of blowing it out.</v>

149
00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:17.911
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

150
00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:19.890
<v Speaker 4>Because that creates the tea party which you know,</v>

151
00:04:19.891 --> 00:04:23.310
<v Speaker 4>comes in and then they have power and then the tea party by the way has to go</v>

152
00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:24.660
<v Speaker 4>back to their constituents and say,</v>

153
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.501
<v Speaker 4>we're going to repeal it,</v>

154
00:04:25.501 --> 00:04:26.071
<v Speaker 4>we're going to do this,</v>

155
00:04:26.071 --> 00:04:26.904
<v Speaker 4>we're going to do,</v>

156
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:27.743
<v Speaker 4>and it just becomes.</v>

157
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.900
<v Speaker 4>Everything goes to the atomic level and so that when you actually go into,</v>

158
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.833
<v Speaker 4>into,</v>

159
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

160
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.910
<v Speaker 4>into Congress or into the executive or into the Senate and you try to get</v>

161
00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:39.840
<v Speaker 4>anything done,</v>

162
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.550
<v Speaker 4>you can't because you promised that you're not gonna do anything.</v>

163
00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:47.090
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to have any sort of partisan.</v>

164
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.750
<v Speaker 4>A relation.</v>

165
00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:49.380
<v Speaker 4>Bipartisan,</v>

166
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.213
<v Speaker 4>bipartisan.</v>

167
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

168
00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:51.510
<v Speaker 2>It's fucked up man.</v>

169
00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:51.660
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

170
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.960
<v Speaker 2>and it's stupid and it exists because we have two parties.</v>

171
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.330
<v Speaker 2>When you make to people we make.</v>

172
00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:59.400
<v Speaker 2>One of them were red and you make one of them were blue.</v>

173
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.860
<v Speaker 2>They start wanting to fight each other.</v>

174
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.140
<v Speaker 2>It's a stupid theory.</v>

175
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.720
<v Speaker 2>So disagree.</v>

176
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 4>You're also,</v>

177
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.590
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter if you're in or out,</v>

178
00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:07.450
<v Speaker 4>you're always empower because there's only two,</v>

179
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.490
<v Speaker 4>so you're always going to be this.</v>

180
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 4>The sort of opposition.</v>

181
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

182
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 2>and that influenced the problem is like this is what people have to realize.</v>

183
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.840
<v Speaker 2>A lot of your opinions are my opinions too.</v>

184
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really my opinions,</v>

185
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.660
<v Speaker 2>their opinions that I've decided are good that I've heard from other people and</v>

186
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.810
<v Speaker 2>a lot of our patterns of behaviors from accents to the way we approach culture,</v>

187
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.770
<v Speaker 2>the way we think about women,</v>

188
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:31.150
<v Speaker 2>the way we think about religion.</v>

189
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.980
<v Speaker 2>A lot of that is learned.</v>

190
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

191
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 2>And we have these two deeply ingrained patterns in this country.</v>

192
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:41.470
<v Speaker 2>We have the Democrats and the Republicans and the Republicans are these no</v>

193
00:05:41.471 --> 00:05:43.330
<v Speaker 2>nonsense get business done.</v>

194
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.303
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

195
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.970
<v Speaker 2>and the Democrats are,</v>

196
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

197
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.680
<v Speaker 2>we always think of all these people are all cry babies and they're all wishy</v>

198
00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:55.660
<v Speaker 2>washy and they're bleeding hearts and and that this is like ingrained in sort of</v>

199
00:05:55.661 --> 00:05:57.220
<v Speaker 2>ingrained in our system.</v>

200
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 2>These two different</v>

201
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.900
<v Speaker 1>patterns of behavior and they're severely problematic because you could exhibit</v>

202
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.930
<v Speaker 1>a lot of traits on each sides and still be a very good person or a lot of ideas</v>

203
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:10.070
<v Speaker 1>on each side and still be a very good person.</v>

204
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.730
<v Speaker 5>Because here's the awful thing about being an adult in a relationship or seeking</v>

205
00:06:14.731 --> 00:06:16.570
<v Speaker 5>to be an adult in a relationship.</v>

206
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.820
<v Speaker 5>I have found when I was young and I was a boy and I was dating girls.</v>

207
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.010
<v Speaker 5>It's boys and girls and she's an idiot.</v>

208
00:06:23.011 --> 00:06:26.040
<v Speaker 5>You're an idiot and you do dumb things and everyone cheats and whatever.</v>

209
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.970
<v Speaker 5>Then you hit a certain part of your life where she's a woman and you're a man</v>

210
00:06:29.971 --> 00:06:34.971
<v Speaker 5>and you have adult expectations and you can't be running around being an idiot</v>

211
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.890
<v Speaker 5>with someone who kind of wants you to be at the table because they are sincerely</v>

212
00:06:40.891 --> 00:06:45.230
<v Speaker 5>giving time of their adult life to this thing that you were doing together and</v>

213
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.470
<v Speaker 5>when you come in still thinking you're in ninth grade and she's coming in like,</v>

214
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.870
<v Speaker 5>this is part of what my life is being with you.</v>

215
00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.670
<v Speaker 5>I have never been able to answer that in a mature enough way to where I would've</v>

216
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.570
<v Speaker 5>been able to maintain it because like say next weekend if I had a girlfriend,</v>

217
00:07:08.311 --> 00:07:09.510
<v Speaker 5>she might say,</v>

218
00:07:09.511 --> 00:07:10.081
<v Speaker 5>it's Friday.</v>

219
00:07:10.081 --> 00:07:10.771
<v Speaker 5>What are we doing?</v>

220
00:07:10.771 --> 00:07:11.070
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

221
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.903
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

222
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.530
<v Speaker 5>watching me write for four hours,</v>

223
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.570
<v Speaker 5>and so that's not the way to be.</v>

224
00:07:16.571 --> 00:07:17.500
<v Speaker 5>You can't do that.</v>

225
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.320
<v Speaker 5>So I can't be a good persons other half because I'm always.</v>

226
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:27.390
<v Speaker 5>The work has always attracted me more than coming home to someone.</v>

227
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.600
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

228
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.470
<v Speaker 5>Like I can't stand the idea of someone of living with a person.</v>

229
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.400
<v Speaker 5>I can do it on the bus because it's das boat and work,</v>

230
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:35.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

231
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.970
<v Speaker 5>going down the road.</v>

232
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.223
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

233
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.731
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

234
00:07:38.731 --> 00:07:43.330
<v Speaker 5>I never would want to like wake up and she's there</v>

235
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.300
<v Speaker 1>and I have no aversion.</v>

236
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Get expression.</v>

237
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.920
<v Speaker 1>They can look to your right.</v>

238
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.093
<v Speaker 1>She's there</v>

239
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:54.630
<v Speaker 5>every day.</v>

240
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.720
<v Speaker 5>Here we are together and I'm just not wired that way.</v>

241
00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

242
00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.031
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

243
00:07:59.031 --> 00:07:59.960
<v Speaker 1>did you see that?</v>

244
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.010
<v Speaker 1>That little clip that was making its way around at the inauguration,</v>

245
00:08:04.011 --> 00:08:06.760
<v Speaker 1>on the inauguration stand of Bill Clinton checking you out,</v>

246
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:08.721
<v Speaker 1>getting caught.</v>

247
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:13.330
<v Speaker 1>That was Ivanka and Ivanka could've been either one is so hard.</v>

248
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

249
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

250
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:15.530
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

251
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

252
00:08:16.431 --> 00:08:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Those jeans look was fantastic.</v>

253
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>The look was pure Bill Clinton.</v>

254
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

255
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:20.600
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

256
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.051
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

257
00:08:21.051 --> 00:08:21.501
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

258
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:22.334
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

259
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to hold it back anymore.</v>

260
00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>

261
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.730
<v Speaker 1>I'll look it up.</v>

262
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:26.563
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

263
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:27.560
<v Speaker 1>good Lord.</v>

264
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.731
<v Speaker 1>He's shaking.</v>

265
00:08:28.731 --> 00:08:30.640
<v Speaker 1>He's licking his lips.</v>

266
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.450
<v Speaker 1>She turns around and looks at them.</v>

267
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.063
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

268
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

269
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:36.441
<v Speaker 1>And then it looks,</v>

270
00:08:36.441 --> 00:08:37.310
<v Speaker 1>it gives her a quick look.</v>

271
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

272
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:38.753
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

273
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:41.303
<v Speaker 1>she turned.</v>

274
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Once he looks at her,</v>

275
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:46.371
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

276
00:08:46.371 --> 00:08:47.204
<v Speaker 1>listen bitch,</v>

277

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:48.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

279
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:49.790
<v Speaker 1>you live with a wolf,</v>

280
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.940
<v Speaker 1>you know you live in a big old gray wolf.</v>

281
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.540
<v Speaker 1>She's.</v>

282
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.171
<v Speaker 1>Hi everyone.</v>

283

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

293
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.440
<v Speaker 1>that quiz is beautiful girl.</v>

294
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:08.940
<v Speaker 1>That's the best part of the inauguration day.</v>

295
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:09.774
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

296
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:10.381
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

297
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:11.550
<v Speaker 1>I could beat me again.</v>

298
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of it all.</v>

299
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.070
<v Speaker 1>That would be the only reason I wanted or I would have wanted a Hillary Clinton</v>

300
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:18.150
<v Speaker 1>when the only bright spot,</v>

301
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:19.290
<v Speaker 1>I guess I should say instead,</v>

302
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.900
<v Speaker 1>the only bright spot to her wedding would have been that he would have been back</v>

303
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:23.060
<v Speaker 1>in the house.</v>

304
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

305
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.361
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

306
00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:25.350
<v Speaker 1>As a first man,</v>

307
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.910
<v Speaker 1>man on a rampage,</v>

308
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.890
<v Speaker 1>he'd probably be on a rampage.</v>

309
00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Watches watches mouth.</v>

310
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:30.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

311
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:31.260
<v Speaker 1>I love his mouth.</v>

312
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:31.951
<v Speaker 1>A bites.</v>

313
00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:32.784
<v Speaker 1>His lower lip.</v>

314
00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.520
<v Speaker 1>He says like Miles Ivanka?</v>

315
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:35.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

316
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:36.390
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't.</v>

317
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Does he look.</v>

318
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:37.753
<v Speaker 1>Let me see.</v>

319
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.903
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

320
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:39.960
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

321
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.793
<v Speaker 1>Ivanka.</v>

322
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
