7
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Just come on down and they would go for a few months,</v>

8
00:00:17.051 --> 00:00:18.070
<v Speaker 2>make quarter million bucks,</v>

9
00:00:18.071 --> 00:00:22.450
<v Speaker 2>then fly home and then they'd get all this jewelry and diamonds and shit and one</v>

00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:27.370
<v Speaker 2>just writing stories about it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>slide across the room.</v>

23
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.780

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.243
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

55
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.971
<v Speaker 1>No condom.</v>

56
00:01:40.971 --> 00:01:41.181
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

57
00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:42.014
<v Speaker 1>Shut up.</v>

58
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Why would he do that?</v>

59
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

60
00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

61
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.860
<v Speaker 1>He's just shooting loads of these gals,</v>

62
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.300
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>

63
00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:49.340
<v Speaker 1>he's opening himself up for possible.</v>

64
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.210
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if,</v>

65
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.700
<v Speaker 1>to what I bet he gets them tested.</v>

66
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.770
<v Speaker 1>He puts him in catapults and shoots him in the air.</v>

67
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 3>I am closer to being Lance Armstrong,</v>

68
00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:02.250
<v Speaker 3>like closest on a diet to absent all carbohydrates,</v>

69
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Speaker 3>but I'm still,</v>

70
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

71
00:02:04.681 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 3>now I'm just a bigger individual.</v>

72
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.661
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

73
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:07.330
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>

74
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about,</v>

75
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.203
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

76
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

77
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.903
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

78
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.200
<v Speaker 3>I was talking to,</v>

79
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 3>a friend of mine was at freshmen manager of my college football team.</v>

80
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 3>So this was Harvard.</v>

81
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:17.971
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

82
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.670
<v Speaker 3>It was division two football.</v>

83
00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:20.970
<v Speaker 3>He was a lot of smart,</v>

84
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

85
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 3>guys who couldn't make it in division one.</v>

86
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:28.260
<v Speaker 3>We had kids who went to Harvard because they didn't get scholarships at Holy</v>

87
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.261
<v Speaker 3>Cross.</v>

88
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:28.651
<v Speaker 3>So they went,</v>

89
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:28.921
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

90
00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:30.300
<v Speaker 3>I'll play football for Harvard.</v>

91
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:31.134
<v Speaker 3>They were local.</v>

92
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.710
<v Speaker 3>1976 my senior year,</v>

93
00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:36.570
<v Speaker 3>the biggest kid on our team,</v>

94
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.830
<v Speaker 3>Danny tickets,</v>

95
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.930
<v Speaker 3>weight 265 pounds,</v>

96
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.820
<v Speaker 3>six foot five from our standards.</v>

97
00:02:42.821 --> 00:02:43.710
<v Speaker 3>He was enormous.</v>

98
00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:46.770
<v Speaker 3>He went off to play for the Chicago bears for five or six years.</v>

99
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.640
<v Speaker 3>I think we had one other offensive lineman who was two 65 also six,</v>

100
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:53.731
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>

101
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:54.031
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

102
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:54.864
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

103
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.893
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

104
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.010
<v Speaker 3>maybe two this year.</v>

105
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 3>Harvard football team,</v>

106
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.181
<v Speaker 3>smart kid,</v>

107
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 3>same socioeconomic status.</v>

108
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 3>The entire office of,</v>

109
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:08.460
<v Speaker 3>they got I think 12 players over 300 pounds to his.</v>

110
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 3>These guys were enormous.</v>

111
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's six seven 300 pounds.</v>

112
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 3>They didn't grow people that big when I was growing up.</v>

113
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean I could say maybe I didn't see him,</v>

114
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 3>maybe they weren't around.</v>

115
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they were six seven and they only weighed two 30 cause they weren't being</v>

116
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 3>bulked up so they were playing basketball instead of football.</v>

117
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean I could imagine ways that that confusing but from our perception if you</v>

118
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:37.441
<v Speaker 3>look just what happens when I was a kid in early 1960s I remember I as far as I</v>

119
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:44.101
<v Speaker 3>know there was one 300 pounder in the NFL and the AFL,</v>

120
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.150
<v Speaker 3>two different leads back then.</v>

121
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:46.984
<v Speaker 3>Bob De,</v>

122
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.801
<v Speaker 3>I remember his name,</v>

123
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:52.420
<v Speaker 3>he played for the Boston Patriots and his head was like small compared to his</v>

124
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 3>body and he was a big fat guy.</v>

125
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.660
<v Speaker 3>You know what is there now 2030 per team</v>

126
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.220
<v Speaker 4>and you're saying like a lot of people are saying no the sciences out because</v>

127
00:04:02.221 --> 00:04:03.660
<v Speaker 4>their spend billions of dollars to do that.</v>

128
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.651
<v Speaker 4>The thing is,</v>

129
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:06.870
<v Speaker 4>is when you are playing such far right,</v>

130
00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:08.440
<v Speaker 4>far left partisan politics.</v>

131
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

132
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.440
<v Speaker 4>Then you have people saying,</v>

133
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.393
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

134
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.181
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

135
00:04:12.181 --> 00:04:12.751
<v Speaker 4>Obamacare,</v>

136
00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:13.561
<v Speaker 4>he's a socialist.</v>

137
00:04:13.561 --> 00:04:14.670
<v Speaker 4>He's trying to take over the government.</v>

138
00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:15.241
<v Speaker 4>He's trying to do this,</v>

139
00:04:15.241 --> 00:04:17.610
<v Speaker 4>he's trying to do that and sort of blowing it out.</v>

140
00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:17.911
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

141
00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:19.320
<v Speaker 4>Because that creates the tea party,</v>

142
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.921
<v Speaker 4>which you know,</v>

143
00:04:19.921 --> 00:04:23.010
<v Speaker 4>comes in and then they have power and then the tea party by the way,</v>

144
00:04:23.011 --> 00:04:24.660
<v Speaker 4>has to go back to their constituents and say,</v>

145
00:04:24.661 --> 00:04:25.500
<v Speaker 4>we're going to repeal it.</v>

146
00:04:25.501 --> 00:04:26.041
<v Speaker 4>We're going to do this,</v>

147
00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:26.874
<v Speaker 4>we're going to do anything.</v>

148
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.773
<v Speaker 4>And it just becomes,</v>

149
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.030
<v Speaker 4>everything goes to the atomic level.</v>

150
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.000
<v Speaker 4>And so that when you actually go into,</v>

151
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:33.834
<v Speaker 4>into,</v>

152
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:34.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

153
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.210
<v Speaker 4>into Congress or the executive or into the Senate and you try to get anything</v>

154
00:04:39.331 --> 00:04:40.164
<v Speaker 4>done,</v>

155
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.550
<v Speaker 4>you can't because you've promised that you're not going to do anything.</v>

156
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.200
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have any sort of,</v>

157
00:04:46.201 --> 00:04:46.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

158
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.190
<v Speaker 4>partisan,</v>

159
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

160
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

161
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:48.751
<v Speaker 4>relation,</v>

162
00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:49.351
<v Speaker 4>bipartisan,</v>

163
00:04:49.351 --> 00:04:49.920
<v Speaker 4>bipartisan</v>

164
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.341
<v Speaker 2>relations.</v>

165
00:04:50.341 --> 00:04:50.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

166
00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:51.510
<v Speaker 2>It's fucked up man.</v>

167
00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:51.661
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

168
00:04:51.661 --> 00:04:52.471
<v Speaker 2>and it's stupid.</v>

169
00:04:52.471 --> 00:04:54.960
<v Speaker 2>And it exists because we have two parties.</v>

170
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.330
<v Speaker 2>When you make to people we make,</v>

171
00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:59.400
<v Speaker 2>one of them were red and you make one of them were blue,</v>

172
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.840
<v Speaker 2>they start wanting to fight each other.</v>

173
00:05:00.841 --> 00:05:01.110
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

174
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.720
<v Speaker 2>it's a stupid thing are also disagree.</v>

175
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:04.330
<v Speaker 4>You're also,</v>

176
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.590
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter if you're in or out,</v>

177
00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:07.450
<v Speaker 4>you're always empower cause there's only two,</v>

178
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.970
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

179
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.330
<v Speaker 4>So you're always going to be,</v>

180
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 4>this is the sort of opposition.</v>

181
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

182
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 2>And that influenced the problem is like this is what people have to realize.</v>

183
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.870
<v Speaker 2>A lot of your opinions and my opinions too,</v>

184
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really my opinions,</v>

185
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.850
<v Speaker 2>their opinions that I have decided are good that I've heard from other people.</v>

186
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

187
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.270
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of our patterns of behaviors from accents to the way we approach</v>

188
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.211
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

189
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:29.770
<v Speaker 2>that the way we think about women,</v>

190
00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:31.180
<v Speaker 2>the way we think about religion,</v>

191
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.040
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that is learned.</v>

192
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.821
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

193
00:05:33.821 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 2>And we have these two deeply ingrained patterns in this country.</v>

194
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 2>We have the Democrats and we have the Republicans and the Republicans are these</v>

195
00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 2>no nonsense get business done.</v>

196
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.343
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

197
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.880
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

198
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.970
<v Speaker 2>the Democrats are,</v>

199
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

200
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.680
<v Speaker 2>we always think of all these people are all cry babies and they're all wishy</v>

201
00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:52.690
<v Speaker 2>washy and they're bleeding hearts.</v>

202
00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

203
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.060
<v Speaker 2>and that this is like ingrained,</v>

204
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.220
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of ingrained in our system,</v>

205
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 2>these two different</v>

206
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.040
<v Speaker 1>patterns of behavior if they're severely problematic because you could exhibit a</v>

207
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:08.051
<v Speaker 1>lot of traits on each sides and still be a very good person or a lot of ideas on</v>

208
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:10.100
<v Speaker 1>each side and still be a very good person.</v>

209
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.730
<v Speaker 5>Cause here's the awful thing about being an adult in a relationship to seeking</v>

210
00:06:14.731 --> 00:06:16.590
<v Speaker 5>to be an adult in a relationship.</v>

211
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.100
<v Speaker 5>I have found,</v>

212
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.300
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

213
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.820
<v Speaker 5>when I was young and I was a boy and I was dating girls,</v>

214
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.010
<v Speaker 5>it's poison girls and she's an idiot.</v>

215
00:06:23.011 --> 00:06:24.750
<v Speaker 5>You're an idiot and you do dumb things.</v>

216
00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:26.070
<v Speaker 5>And if when cheats and whatever,</v>

217
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.970
<v Speaker 5>then you hit a certain part of your life where she's a woman and you're a man</v>

218
00:06:29.971 --> 00:06:34.971
<v Speaker 5>and you have adult expectations and you can't be running around being an idiot</v>

219
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.890
<v Speaker 5>with someone who kind of wants you to be at the table because they are sincerely</v>

220
00:06:40.891 --> 00:06:44.970
<v Speaker 5>giving time of their adult life to this thing that you were doing together.</v>

221
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.110
<v Speaker 5>And when you come in still thinking you're in ninth grade and she's coming in</v>

222
00:06:49.111 --> 00:06:53.680
<v Speaker 5>like this is part of what my life is,</v>

223
00:06:53.681 --> 00:06:54.900
<v Speaker 5>is being with you.</v>

224
00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:00.590
<v Speaker 5>I have never been able to answer that in a mature enough way to where I would</v>

225
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:03.930
<v Speaker 5>have been able to maintain it.</v>

226
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.280
<v Speaker 5>Because like say next weekend if I had a girlfriend,</v>

227
00:07:08.281 --> 00:07:10.080
<v Speaker 5>she might say it's Friday.</v>

228
00:07:10.081 --> 00:07:10.771
<v Speaker 5>What are we doing?</v>

229
00:07:10.771 --> 00:07:11.070
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

230
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.903
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

231
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.530
<v Speaker 5>watching me write for four hours</v>

232
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:14.503
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

233
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.570
<v Speaker 5>And so that's not the way to be.</v>

234
00:07:16.571 --> 00:07:17.500
<v Speaker 5>You can't do that.</v>

235
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.330
<v Speaker 5>And so I can't be a good persons other half cause I'm always,</v>

236
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:27.390
<v Speaker 5>the work has always attracted me more than coming home to someone.</v>

237
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.600
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

238
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:28.811
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

239
00:07:28.811 --> 00:07:28.971
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

240
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:32.500
<v Speaker 5>I can't stand the idea of someone of living with a person.</v>

241
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.410
<v Speaker 5>I can do it on the bus cause it's das boat and we're like,</v>

242
00:07:35.411 --> 00:07:35.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

243
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.970
<v Speaker 5>going down the road.</v>

244
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.253
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

245
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:38.711
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

246
00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:43.330
<v Speaker 5>I never would want to like wake up and she's there</v>

247
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.320
<v Speaker 1>and I have no aversion.</v>

248
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:50.523
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

249
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.640
<v Speaker 1>She's there</v>

250
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.630
<v Speaker 5>every day.</v>

251
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.710
<v Speaker 5>Here we are together and I'm just not wired that way.</v>

252
00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

253
00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.031
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

254
00:07:59.031 --> 00:07:59.960
<v Speaker 1>did you see that,</v>

255
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:00.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

256
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:04.190
<v Speaker 1>that little clip that was making its way around at the inauguration on the</v>

257
00:08:04.191 --> 00:08:08.680
<v Speaker 1>inauguration stand of Bill Clinton checking out and getting caught.</v>

258
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:09.500
<v Speaker 1>That was nice.</v>

259
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Ivanka and Ivanka,</v>

260
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.490
<v Speaker 1>his daughter so hot.</v>

261
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

262
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

263
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.500

271
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:22.334

272
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to hold it back anymore.</v>

273
00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:24.891
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>

274
00:08:24.891 --> 00:08:25.724

275
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:26.583

<v Speaker 1>good Lord.</v>

277
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.700
<v Speaker 1>He's shaking.</v>

278
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.410
<v Speaker 1>He's licking his light.</v>

279
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.450
<v Speaker 1>When she turns around and looks at them,</v>

280
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.063
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

281
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

282
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.441
<v Speaker 1>And then he looks,</v>

283
00:08:36.441 --> 00:08:37.310
<v Speaker 1>it gives her a quick look.</v>

284
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

285
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Once he looks at her,</v>

286
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.401
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

287
00:08:46.401 --> 00:08:46.761

292
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.970
<v Speaker 1>You know you live in a big old gray wolf.</v>

293
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.510
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

294
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:54.171
<v Speaker 1>hi everyone.</v>

295
00:08:54.171 --> 00:08:55.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm Ivanka Trump.</v>

296
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Want to remind?</v>

297
00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.750
<v Speaker 1>I wish you had a fucking accent.</v>

298
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.823
<v Speaker 1>What's going on there?</v>

299
00:08:58.890 --> 00:08:59.011
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

300
00:08:59.011 --> 00:09:00.060
<v Speaker 1>it's her giving him a massage.</v>

301
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:00.361
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

302
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:04.440
<v Speaker 1>this is like a porn film that they did a fake porn about Ivanka Trump.</v>

303
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Look beautiful.</v>

304
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.940
<v Speaker 1>It's the best part of the inauguration day.</v>

305
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:09.774
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

306
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:10.381
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

307
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:11.550
<v Speaker 1>I can beat me again.</v>

308
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of it all.</v>

309
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.760
<v Speaker 1>That would be the only reason I wanted,</v>

310
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.090
<v Speaker 1>or I would have wanted a Hillary Clinton when the only bright spot,</v>

311
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:19.350
<v Speaker 1>I guess I should say instead,</v>

312
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.900
<v Speaker 1>the only bright spot to her wedding would have been that he would have been back</v>

313
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:23.040
<v Speaker 1>in and the house.</v>

314
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

315
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.361
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

316
00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:26.910
<v Speaker 1>As a first mom man on a rampage,</v>

317
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.860
<v Speaker 1>he'd probably be on a rampage.</v>

318
00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Watches.</v>

319
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.173
<v Speaker 1>Watch his mouth.</v>

320
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:30.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

321
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:31.950
<v Speaker 1>I love little bites.</v>

322
00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:32.784
<v Speaker 1>His lower lip.</v>

323
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.490
<v Speaker 1>He says like miles Ivanka.</v>

324
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:35.980
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

325
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:36.650
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't.</v>

326
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:37.483
<v Speaker 1>What can we say this?</v>

327
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.293
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

328
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:40.231
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

329
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:41.250
<v Speaker 1>Ivanka.</v>

330
00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

331
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:51.850
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
