<v Speaker 1>Nobody's ever worked Coty over the way.</v>

24
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Cowboy did.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

28
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.980
<v Speaker 1>Because the first is what he was saying that uh,</v>

29
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 1>at one 70,</v>

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 1>the guy who was also like a one 55 are coming up,</v>

31
00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:51.390

32
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

33
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

34
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Who's this first?</v>

35
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.521
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

36
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:54.354
<v Speaker 1>cowboys.</v>

37
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

38
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Was a big dude.</v>

40
00:00:57.541 --> 00:00:58.860
<v Speaker 1>That was that other cowboy dude.</v>

41
00:00:58.861 --> 00:00:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

43
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.080
<v Speaker 1>but that guy is big.</v>

44
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.070
<v Speaker 1>He's a big fella.</v>

45
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>He was bigger than cowboy boots cowboy.</v>

46
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I caught him in the triangle,</v>

47
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.550
<v Speaker 1>but he just looked great.</v>

48
00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:08.070
<v Speaker 1>But like Kofi with a body like one 85 and then he started,</v>

49
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>his first fight was at two oh five he dropped Tito Ortiz.</v>

50
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.180
<v Speaker 1>This is way back in the day.</v>

51
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.030
<v Speaker 1>It's when Tito was a light heavyweight champ I believe.</v>

52
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 1>And I think Tito was either champ or in the,</v>

53
00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was,</v>

54
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Tito was in his prime and he lost to Tito at light heavyweight and then went</v>

55
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>down to one 85 fought Anderson Silva.</v>

56
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.120
<v Speaker 1>He was doing very well,</v>

57
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>very smart fight.</v>

58
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.820
<v Speaker 1>He fought a very smart fight against Anderson where he was like making Anderson</v>

59
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker 1>lead in Anderson's really counter guy and he was just sort of laying it back and</v>

60
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Anderson didn't like it and he doesn't,</v>

61
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.760
<v Speaker 1>the Anderson does not like it when he had like a weird knee popped or something</v>

62
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>and he blew out.</v>

63
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

64
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:45.260
<v Speaker 1>you're like lifted his leg up to throw a kick and his knee just buckled and</v>

65
00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:46.160
<v Speaker 1>shaved in on him.</v>

66
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Shit happen sometimes.</v>

67
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

68
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

69
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.291
<v Speaker 1>weird freak shit.</v>

70
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Like that happens a lot in this sport.</v>

71
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.331
<v Speaker 1>Well sure.</v>

72
00:01:51.331 --> 00:01:54.570
<v Speaker 1>And there's also like injuries that you get like the second and third round that</v>

73
00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:55.850
<v Speaker 1>you don't even know what you mean.</v>

74
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.880
<v Speaker 1>You felt your knee pop,</v>

75
00:01:56.881 --> 00:01:59.760
<v Speaker 1>you're not exactly sure what it is and you're still standing on and everything</v>

76
00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:02.610
<v Speaker 1>seems fine and then you throw a kick and it just gives out.</v>

77
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.103
<v Speaker 1>There's that,</v>

78
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.621
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

79
00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:06.930
<v Speaker 1>But the point is Coty is a stud.</v>

80
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.291
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

81
00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 1>tough fucking guy and to have cowboy work,</v>

82
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:11.281
<v Speaker 1>I'm like that.</v>

83
00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

84
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>whew,</v>

85
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Ninja.</v>

86
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 1>It looked fucking Aussie like terminator that night.</v>

87
00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Like he looks like,</v>

88
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.551
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

89
00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:17.910
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

90
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.700
<v Speaker 1>It looked like a world fucking happy for me.</v>

91
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Legit world champion.</v>

92
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

93
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

94
00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:23.670
<v Speaker 1>I hope he can keep that together.</v>

95
00:02:23.671 --> 00:02:24.390
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

96
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.390
<v Speaker 1>I think one 70 I think these guys that are fucking depleting themselves so badly</v>

97
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:30.294
<v Speaker 1>to cut weight,</v>

98
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>I think that's going to be a thing of the past.</v>

99
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:32.521
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

100
00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:33.720
<v Speaker 1>I think people got to realize like,</v>

101
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.630
<v Speaker 1>this is not the benefit that you get in that is it's negligible cowboys.</v>

102
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Wayne,</v>

103
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.170
<v Speaker 1>like one 76 somewhere around that and he's cutting just a little bit of weight</v>

104
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.600
<v Speaker 1>and making one 70 easy.</v>

105
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

106
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.810
<v Speaker 1>I think he was like four or five pounds off when he came there.</v>

107
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.673
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>

108
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.730
<v Speaker 1>We sparked a couple of weeks before the fight and he was like 14 days out and he</v>

109
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:54.690
<v Speaker 1>was like five pounds.</v>

110
00:02:54.691 --> 00:02:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Like you'd go out to eat,</v>

111
00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:56.920
<v Speaker 1>we're eating whatever.</v>

112
00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

113
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.540
<v Speaker 1>that's nice shit.</v>

114
00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Drinking a beer.</v>

115
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 1>He's so fucking ridiculous with that.</v>

116
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 1>He drinks beer up until the day of the weigh ins.</v>

117
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

118
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.700
<v Speaker 1>that can't be good right now.</v>

119
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

120
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.001
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

121
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of beer is probably okay.</v>

122
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
