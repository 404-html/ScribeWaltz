<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

11
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Brendan Schaub and Brian Callen were engaged in some shenanigans.</v>

12
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>They rough house Sunday.</v>

13
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Rough House.</v>

14
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to chill.</v>

15
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.650
<v Speaker 1>I was talking,</v>

16
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.361
<v Speaker 1>I was poking the bear.</v>

17
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:21.661
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

18
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>I had too much coffee and I went,</v>

19
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.920
<v Speaker 1>I went into,</v>

20
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.210
<v Speaker 1>I got into his face and then he decided to,</v>

21
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's chose me and I'll be on my Instagram story.</v>

22
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.303
<v Speaker 1>Double tap outs.</v>

23
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

24
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:34.704
<v Speaker 1>that was not right.</v>

25
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.580
<v Speaker 1>You had a tap.</v>

26
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Well I got a fucking huge a rug burn on my fucking forehead.</v>

27
00:00:38.581 --> 00:00:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Now that that's it.</v>

28
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>That kind of,</v>

29
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>well that's what happens.</v>

30
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:42.211
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

31
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>what kind of Shit fucking production is this?</v>

32
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:45.600
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

33
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.650
<v Speaker 1>They got who's running?</v>

34
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>The camera's over there in England.</v>

35
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.470
<v Speaker 1>They showed niner in the background.</v>

36
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.963
<v Speaker 1>The fucking,</v>

37
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 1>the curtain that's covering the monitors.</v>

38
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Whoever did that sucks.</v>

39
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>This is what happens.</v>

40
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.150
<v Speaker 1>And the UFC got rid of all the old guys.</v>

41
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Now you got new guys over there in England to or wherever the fuck home.</v>

42
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.863
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

43
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>So Eddie Bravo can't be here folks cause he's on the other side of the world</v>

44
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.210
<v Speaker 1>where Flatworld that shit is ironic.</v>

45
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.880
<v Speaker 1>The flat,</v>

46
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.713
<v Speaker 1>the flat world.</v>

47
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.501
<v Speaker 1>Where is he right now?</v>

48
00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Ticking necessarily says the earth is flat.</v>

49
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:18.210
<v Speaker 1>He's never necessarily set it.</v>

50
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.010
<v Speaker 1>He just says things like,</v>

51
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know Bro.</v>

52
00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at it.</v>

53
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.033
<v Speaker 1>When you look into it.</v>

54
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's round.</v>

55
00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:27.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's flat.</v>

56
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>What's amazing though is the angry flat earth people when even post something</v>

57
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

58
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

59
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>they get so mad.</v>

60
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Speaker 1>But don't you think you're being trolled for the most part?</v>

61
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.680
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

62
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

63
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.410
<v Speaker 1>I think people are that fucking stupid.</v>

64
00:01:40.411 --> 00:01:42.450
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a bunch of meth babies out there.</v>

65
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.410
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a bunch of dummies who were eating nothing but sugar and they</v>

66
00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:48.990
<v Speaker 1>had kids and these kids are stupid as fuck.</v>

67
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.271
<v Speaker 1>That's fair.</v>

68
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:51.950
<v Speaker 1>It might be true.</v>

69
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:52.783
<v Speaker 1>That's fair.</v>

70
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>I think there's like a few trolling,</v>

71
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:55.960
<v Speaker 1>but in general the,</v>

72
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>the math of those morons,</v>

73
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>they believe,</v>

74
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.300
<v Speaker 1>well a lot of people just don't have any idea of any kind of tradition of where</v>

75
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Speaker 1>we came to these conclusions.</v>

76
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>So they think that history starting right now with them?</v>

77
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

78
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.330
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean,</v>

79
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.800
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of laziness is a lot and there's also a lot of confirmation bias.</v>

80
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.170
<v Speaker 1>They have these ideas in their head and they don't look into them.</v>

81
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 1>They're just not interested in like,</v>

82
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

83
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.130
<v Speaker 1>really getting into it.</v>

84
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.581
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

85
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:20.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>like listening to that,</v>

87
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.070
<v Speaker 1>that debate with Michael Shermer and Randall Carlson and Graham Hancock,</v>

88
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.080
<v Speaker 1>like if you as a scientist and smart people,</v>

89
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.190
<v Speaker 1>they're very careful about what they say because they get called out on it.</v>

90
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

91
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.271
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

92
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>And and arriving at real conclusions is something they tend to avoid.</v>

93
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:41.430
<v Speaker 1>They'll just have these big discussions and kind of approximate what probably</v>

94
00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

95
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

96
00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:43.530
<v Speaker 1>And even in that discussion,</v>

97
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>you got to see people that got into trouble for saying something didn't happen.</v>

98
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.020
<v Speaker 1>And so then as Randall started unveiling more evidence and Graham started</v>

99
00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:53.040
<v Speaker 1>unveiling more evidence,</v>

100
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>it was one of those things where everybody kind of had it back up and go,</v>

101
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:56.160
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

102
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>well you can't say it didn't happen because of all this stuff that we know did</v>

103
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>happen now.</v>

104
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.890
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

105
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>it's very complicated when you start saying you know things and when you know</v>

106
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:10.321
<v Speaker 1>almost nothing about science and space and astrophysics and all the different</v>

107
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 1>shit that you need to know to understand satellites and ice walls.</v>

108
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

109
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.370
<v Speaker 1>How about the way our mind works like that?</v>

110
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Tobolowsky what's his name?</v>

111
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Who I just listened to podcasts so I listened to a couple of his lectures back</v>

112
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 1>in the day on,</v>

113
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 1>on ted.com but like when he was talking about all the variables that lend</v>

114
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>themselves to how your brain works and who you are and good luck getting to a</v>

115
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 1>conclusion.</v>

116
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 1>He says staunched determinism believe will not even though I shouldn't say a</v>

117
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 1>believer because he's a scientist,</v>

118
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>but what his conclusion,</v>

119
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean what he's trying to establish with people is that there's so many</v>

120
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 1>variables that go into you being you biological,</v>

121
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>very illogical variables,</v>

122
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 1>genetic variables,</v>

123
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.090
<v Speaker 1>variables in terms of like what genes are turned on by stress when your mother's</v>

124
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.370
<v Speaker 1>has you in the womb.</v>

125
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

126
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.410
<v Speaker 1>There's so much shit that goes into you being a person.</v>

127
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.951
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

128
00:03:56.951 --> 00:04:01.510
<v Speaker 1>you know what he's saying is that like when we look back on today and we look</v>

129
00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:04.140
<v Speaker 1>back at people being punished for certain things that they did and be an</v>

130
00:04:04.141 --> 00:04:04.830
<v Speaker 1>imprisoned,</v>

131
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.830
<v Speaker 1>we're going to think it's absolutely barbaric when when real neurologists firmly</v>

132
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:12.730
<v Speaker 1>established the actual science behind human behavior.</v>

133
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean meaning that we don't really have free will where w w our behavior is</v>

134
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.690
<v Speaker 1>dictated by our biology and our machine.</v>

135
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

136
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

137
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:25.561
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's gotta be some will because why else are they're inspirational</v>

138
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:27.700
<v Speaker 1>memes that strippers put on their Instagram page.</v>

139
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.530
<v Speaker 1>This has gotta be</v>

140
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.290
<v Speaker 1>shy to rise</v>

141
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.170
<v Speaker 1>above the try and,</v>

142
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.930
<v Speaker 1>and you can't get inspired,</v>

143
00:04:40.931 --> 00:04:41.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

144
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

145
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Like we see this is where the freewill argument kind of hits a bump in the road</v>

146
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 1>because you can get inspired by shit and when you do and get inspired by Shitty</v>

147
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 1>can improve your life for how long though,</v>

148
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:52.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

149
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

150
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Well it depends.</v>

151
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.260
<v Speaker 1>They both seem changes.</v>

152
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 1>What's that old expression is that inspiration is like bathing.</v>

153
00:04:58.031 --> 00:04:58.691
<v Speaker 1>It's effective,</v>

154
00:04:58.691 --> 00:04:59.710
<v Speaker 1>but you need to do it daily.</v>

155
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

156
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

157
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Or how about the fact that punishment but got to read a little bit every now and</v>

158
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:05.900
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

159
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Punish my doesn't know.</v>

160
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's some old school shit.</v>

161
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.440
<v Speaker 1>I just dropped my tattoo.</v>

162
00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:12.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting that as a tattoo</v>

163
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.533
<v Speaker 1>on my dog.</v>

164
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 1>That's a bold move guys.</v>

165
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Who Tattoo Their Dick</v>

166
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.160
<v Speaker 1>for a tab or would you like what would you do?</v>

167
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.600
<v Speaker 1>We should tell you to your Dick Black.</v>

168
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Just all black.</v>

169
00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Just a black band.</v>

170
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.740
<v Speaker 1>Black people do that.</v>

171
00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:31.030
<v Speaker 1>They get like their whole arm black.</v>

172
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:31.720
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird,</v>

173
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 1>I wonder why I thought it was cause they messed up and then God better to cover</v>

174
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:35.651
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

175
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:36.251
<v Speaker 1>Go Black.</v>

176
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:39.970
<v Speaker 1>But no for some people they do do it for that and some people do it because they</v>

177
00:05:39.971 --> 00:05:41.530
<v Speaker 1>just want their whole arm to be black.</v>

178
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

179
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Some people have bands can look good and then there are people that just get</v>

180
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:49.750
<v Speaker 1>random shit like a Cadillac or a doll.</v>

181
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Well how about Travis Barker?</v>

182
00:05:50.831 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 1>He's got everything.</v>

183
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.061

184
00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:52.511
<v Speaker 1>he's got it.</v>

185
00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:52.871
<v Speaker 1>It's all right.</v>

186
00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

187
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.240
<v Speaker 1>I got that tactic just to doodle pad a tattoo.</v>

188
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.093
<v Speaker 1>The Cadillac tax.</v>

189
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 1>He has a guy</v>

190
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.521
<v Speaker 2>is guy,</v>

191
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:00.830

192
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 2>but he'll have two of them worked on at the same time.</v>

193
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ both on his back just doing work dudes like that,</v>

194
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 2>like run out of cannabis,</v>

195
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 2>like he's kind of running out of canvas space.</v>

196
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.620
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know his whole head is done.</v>

197
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 2>Jesus taught us this whole head is done but a lot.</v>

198
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:16.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's had a lot of those tattoos.</v>

199
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.400
<v Speaker 2>We remembered he got on that plane crash and he had like third degree burns all</v>

200
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:20.234
<v Speaker 2>over his body.</v>

201
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.890
<v Speaker 2>I remember he got a lot of them after that cover.</v>

202
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.853
<v Speaker 2>Kind of that bullshit.</v>

203
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Fucking crazy.</v>

204
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:27.350
<v Speaker 2>He's same man.</v>

205
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.060
<v Speaker 2>He survives that Guy Dj am and then the guy kills himself afterwards when he was</v>

206
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:34.640
<v Speaker 2>really fucked up right after on these drugs.</v>

207
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 2>I use a little fine before then and then goes to the hospital and then you know</v>

208
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.470
<v Speaker 2>you're on the medication.</v>

209
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.303
<v Speaker 2>The neighborhood labs.</v>

210
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:45.140
<v Speaker 2>I know a woman who got injured like that and then she was,</v>

211
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.940
<v Speaker 2>they put her on morphine and she has to basically battle a morphine addiction</v>

212
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:50.774
<v Speaker 2>the rest of her life.</v>

213
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.561
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

214
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:53.660
<v Speaker 2>I will always be addicted to opiates.</v>

215
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:54.720
<v Speaker 2>I'll always want it.</v>

216
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.461
<v Speaker 2>Don't have to be,</v>

217
00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:55.910
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

00:06:56.211 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying she's got that urge all the time.</v>

220
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Speaker 2>But you got that urge when you had your nose fixed,</v>

221
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:01.244
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

222
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.600
<v Speaker 2>Yadda issue.</v>

223
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.500
<v Speaker 2>But what's it like a,</v>

225
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Like what is it like when you say you want,</v>

226
00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:07.731
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

227

<v Speaker 2>Like the same feeling as like a,</v>

229
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't like if you crave something,</v>

230
00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:14.920
<v Speaker 2>like you're constantly craving it.</v>

00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:40.220
<v Speaker 2>I think it might've been because I remember you and I talking to him in 1997 and</v>

291
00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:42.140
<v Speaker 2>he was to 60 he had just,</v>

292
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.930
<v Speaker 2>he just need that ranger in the face.</v>

293
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.781
<v Speaker 2>Rancher.</v>

294
00:08:45.781 --> 00:08:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Stott.</v>

295
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:46.580
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

296
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.510
<v Speaker 2>And then I said,</v>

297
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:47.861
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

298
00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:48.111
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

299
00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:49.280
<v Speaker 2>you wrestled at one 88.</v>

300
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:49.550
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

301
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:49.941
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

302
00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:50.151
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

303
00:08:50.151 --> 00:08:51.440
<v Speaker 2>what are you wait nine to six.</v>

304
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:53.630
<v Speaker 2>He put a little miracle grow in my cereal every morning.</v>

305
00:08:53.631 --> 00:08:54.200
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

306
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.710
<v Speaker 2>God damn his steroids.</v>

307
00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Good on him.</v>

308
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:57.590
<v Speaker 2>Steroids.</v>

309
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.070
<v Speaker 2>They looked amazing on him.</v>

310
00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.410
<v Speaker 2>He uh,</v>

311
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.800
<v Speaker 2>he's gay too or no?</v>

312
00:09:01.801 --> 00:09:02.850
<v Speaker 2>Is that like you don't know?</v>

313
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

314
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.170
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

315
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:04.820
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>

316
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:05.071
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

317
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:07.530
<v Speaker 2>It's a wonderful man.</v>

318
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.580
<v Speaker 2>A really nice man.</v>

319
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.110
<v Speaker 2>I hope he's gay.</v>

320
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.700
<v Speaker 2>What's going on here?</v>

321
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:12.960
<v Speaker 2>So who are these gentleman?</v>

322
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:15.510
<v Speaker 2>The guy with the writing on his arm or Hermann for 30 right now,</v>

323
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:20.720
<v Speaker 2>son Hermanson and Nicholson and the four 20 84274206425 in round one.</v>

324
00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 2>If you want to sync up,</v>

325
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.090
<v Speaker 2>you look at the fighters on this card and it's a fucking good luck with this</v>

326
00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:27.421
<v Speaker 2>spelling,</v>

327
00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:29.640
<v Speaker 2>but to get them back then Jesus Christ,</v>

328
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.810
<v Speaker 2>just those shelters dealt so big.</v>

329
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:34.703
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

330
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:36.660
<v Speaker 2>And he'd made her American.</v>

331
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:38.340
<v Speaker 2>He'd wear American flag shorts.</v>

332
00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:39.780
<v Speaker 2>That amazing.</v>

333
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:40.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

334
00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:41.154
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

335
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.580
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>

336
00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.100
<v Speaker 2>They called him the specimen,</v>

337
00:09:44.101 --> 00:09:44.760
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

338
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.390
<v Speaker 2>Will they fart?</v>

339
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.080
<v Speaker 2>They started out calling the specimen then they call it the started calling the</v>

340
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.660
<v Speaker 2>smashing machine when he fought,</v>

341
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.940
<v Speaker 2>I forget who he follows.</v>

342
00:09:52.941 --> 00:09:54.780
<v Speaker 2>Damn globish Dan Boba.</v>

343
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:59.730
<v Speaker 2>She got Dan Bowbridge down and he submitted him by shoving his chin in his</v>

344
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:04.560
<v Speaker 2>eyeball that he'd put his chin in his eye socket and just grabbed the back of</v>

345
00:10:04.561 --> 00:10:05.360
<v Speaker 2>his neck.</v>

346
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Blumkin forced his chin was eyeball head move of all time.</v>

347
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:09.541
<v Speaker 2>All time.</v>

348
00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:10.170
<v Speaker 2>It's up there.</v>

349
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.050
<v Speaker 2>It's a great meeting.</v>

350
00:10:11.051 --> 00:10:13.620
<v Speaker 2>She'll meet head movement and you need to do that kind of a move.</v>

351
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:15.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know it's a move for a shirt,</v>

352
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.200
<v Speaker 2>some meat hedge,</v>

353
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:18.940
<v Speaker 2>but it's a move beam.</v>

354
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.590
<v Speaker 2>Is it more of a meathead moved in the can opener cause he submitted a guy with a</v>

355
00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:23.460
<v Speaker 2>can opener too.</v>

356
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.380
<v Speaker 2>I feel like they can't open a little more technical.</v>

357
00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:27.090
<v Speaker 2>He Jackson Dude's neck with a candle.</v>

358
00:10:27.091 --> 00:10:28.020
<v Speaker 2>But how has it more technical?</v>

359
00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:30.810
<v Speaker 2>You just pull on a guy's head but you got to get them position.</v>

360
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean for you if you're just doing like fuck it.</v>

361
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.830
<v Speaker 2>Shinda I Chen the eyeballs.</v>

362
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.280
<v Speaker 2>No techniques like my more to that recall.</v>

363
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.610
<v Speaker 2>That's actually more tactical that a can opener or is it more barbaric?</v>

364
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.050
<v Speaker 2>It's more about Baird for sure,</v>

365
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.750
<v Speaker 2>but I mean I guess that would be,</v>

366
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:50.751
<v Speaker 2>well that's fights over I guess this Dude Jack Ma Hammered Jack in mine.</v>

367
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:56.450
<v Speaker 2>I guess the big issue with a 12 to six eyeballs would be if a guy was down and</v>

368
00:10:56.671 --> 00:10:59.640
<v Speaker 2>you crush it right into the eyeball.</v>

369
00:10:59.670 --> 00:10:59.791
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

370
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:01.560
<v Speaker 2>This is more like a steamroll approach,</v>

371
00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:04.020
<v Speaker 2>which just real slow mush.</v>

372
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:05.363
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

373
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.200
<v Speaker 2>it bothers me that I can't do that to a man.</v>

374
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.580
<v Speaker 2>What are we looking at up there,</v>

375
00:11:08.581 --> 00:11:09.240
<v Speaker 2>Jim?</v>

376
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:09.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh sorry.</v>

377
00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:10.860
<v Speaker 2>I thought we thought you're showing us something.</v>

378
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to work on that technique.</v>

379
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:14.430
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't do that to a man?</v>

380
00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:15.090
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you're saying?</v>

381
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:15.361
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

382
00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:15.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

383
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:19.170
<v Speaker 2>I just kind of could a smaller guy and I'm fresh off my wound.</v>

384
00:11:19.171 --> 00:11:19.330
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

385
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:20.470
<v Speaker 2>my head still hurts from you.</v>

386
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:24.090
<v Speaker 2>You fucking hurting Josh Martin on the ground and stuck your Chin in his</v>

387
00:11:24.091 --> 00:11:24.441
<v Speaker 2>eyeball.</v>

388
00:11:24.441 --> 00:11:25.274
<v Speaker 2>I think you get some them.</v>

389
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.970
<v Speaker 2>There are guys that got them into this,</v>

390
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.910
<v Speaker 2>which was a comedian.</v>

391
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:31.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

392
00:11:31.081 --> 00:11:32.490
<v Speaker 2>there are certain communities I can do that too.</v>

393
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

394
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:34.500
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's all a pecking order,</v>

395
00:11:34.501 --> 00:11:34.920
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

396
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.690
<v Speaker 2>To Jay Davis might give you a hard time.</v>

397
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.531
<v Speaker 2>Remember when,</v>

398

406
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:47.850

407
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

408

410
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure it was out of sight control.</v>

411
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.980
<v Speaker 2>Valentine Overeem submitted,</v>

412

<v Speaker 1>old school.</v>

414
00:11:55.271 --> 00:11:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Old School.</v>

415
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

416
00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.330
<v Speaker 1>He just didn't have it like the rain.</v>

417
00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:58.930
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

418
00:11:58.930 --> 00:11:59.081
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

419
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:00.450
<v Speaker 1>he would fall apart when the,</v>

420
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.090
<v Speaker 1>when the bombs started dropping,</v>

421
00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.760
<v Speaker 1>when the going got tough.</v>

422
00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:04.001
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

423
00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:04.301
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

424
00:12:04.301 --> 00:12:05.230
<v Speaker 1>fuck this check please.</v>

425
00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:06.360
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

426
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.090
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

427
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:07.590
<v Speaker 1>when you're ready.</v>

428
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:08.410
<v Speaker 1>CFO who didn't,</v>

429
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:09.400
<v Speaker 1>he was more of a striker,</v>

430
00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:10.234
<v Speaker 1>wasn't he?</v>

431
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

432
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.673
<v Speaker 1>to say the least.</v>

433
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:12.941
<v Speaker 1>So for him,</v>

434
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:15.610
<v Speaker 1>I guess getting caught in a can opener just as a function of just like,</v>

435
00:12:15.611 --> 00:12:17.950
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't get a high level Jujitsu and can opener,</v>

436
00:12:17.951 --> 00:12:18.251
<v Speaker 1>would you?</v>

437
00:12:18.251 --> 00:12:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Or would you?</v>

438
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.630
<v Speaker 1>There's no situation that's super gorilla.</v>

439
00:12:22.631 --> 00:12:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Like Mark Kirk could get a good black belt in one if like,</v>

440
00:12:26.021 --> 00:12:26.854
<v Speaker 1>he just could.</v>

441
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:28.820
<v Speaker 1>The guy just could not get out and exhausted.</v>

442
00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.520
<v Speaker 1>And if mark gets a hold of your neck,</v>

443
00:12:30.521 --> 00:12:32.890
<v Speaker 1>like he just can't rip your ligaments apart,</v>

444
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:34.900
<v Speaker 1>your tendons and ligaments.</v>

445
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Back then he was so gorilla strong.</v>

446
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:37.421
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

447
00:12:37.421 --> 00:12:38.620
<v Speaker 1>it didn't even make any sense.</v>

448
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

449
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:40.060
<v Speaker 1>He was so stupid.</v>

450
00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Strong.</v>

451
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.321
<v Speaker 1>And you're not used to it.</v>

452
00:12:41.321 --> 00:12:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Like if it caught you off guard,</v>

453
00:12:42.251 --> 00:12:43.180
<v Speaker 1>like I had Brian,</v>

454
00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:43.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

455
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:44.591

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.550

471
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what's funny is when you see</v>

472
00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.160
<v Speaker 1>it was so embarrassing and Shane goes,</v>

473

477
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.380
<v Speaker 1>have you ever tapped that?</v>

478
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.213
<v Speaker 1>Ego's</v>

479
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:34.750
<v Speaker 1>not like that.</v>

480
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:38.080
<v Speaker 1>You're looking for some kind of comradery and it was just dead silence and I was</v>

481
00:13:38.081 --> 00:13:39.550
<v Speaker 1>just this pussy of the day.</v>

482
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Maybe come back next week.</v>

483
00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:46.060
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what's funny is when a guys who've never had any combat experience,</v>

484
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:47.140
<v Speaker 1>especially with wrestling,</v>

485
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:50.230
<v Speaker 1>get caught up with a guy who has experienced so,</v>

486
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.050
<v Speaker 1>but dove had never had any wrestling and he grabbed onto may,</v>

487
00:13:54.051 --> 00:13:57.100
<v Speaker 1>him Miller and Jason was kind of showing him,</v>

488
00:13:57.101 --> 00:13:57.611
<v Speaker 1>just hit my,</v>

489
00:13:57.611 --> 00:13:57.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

490
00:13:57.851 --> 00:13:59.440
<v Speaker 1>it's like we're all on a wood floor.</v>

491
00:13:59.441 --> 00:14:02.840
<v Speaker 1>And Jason started showing him just a couple of things where Doug was grabbing</v>

492
00:14:02.841 --> 00:14:03.490
<v Speaker 1>him and stuff.</v>

493
00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:05.200
<v Speaker 1>And dove was so kind of,</v>

494
00:14:05.201 --> 00:14:07.540
<v Speaker 1>and he's boxed so he knows the difference with striking.</v>

495
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.630
<v Speaker 1>But he called me up the next day and he said it's very difficult for me to get</v>

496
00:14:10.631 --> 00:14:11.650
<v Speaker 1>my head around this.</v>

497
00:14:11.651 --> 00:14:15.940
<v Speaker 1>I said what he said to be that dominated by another man that easily,</v>

498
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.950
<v Speaker 1>and to realize that I could just be as dove,</v>

499
00:14:17.951 --> 00:14:19.120
<v Speaker 1>have a mirror in his house.</v>

500
00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:21.940
<v Speaker 1>He knows better,</v>

501
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.133
<v Speaker 1>he knows better,</v>

502
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:23.681
<v Speaker 1>he knows better,</v>

503
00:14:23.681 --> 00:14:23.880
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

504
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.470
<v Speaker 1>he's not a bad boxer for an actor or a comedian.</v>

505
00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:27.710
<v Speaker 1>He knows better.</v>

506
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

507
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.320
<v Speaker 1>But there doing black belts,</v>

508
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.530
<v Speaker 1>she'll be honest about what's going on though,</v>

509
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:36.250
<v Speaker 1>have dumbbells punch in the face.</v>

510
00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Dub is a good boxer.</v>

511
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:37.871
<v Speaker 1>Luck with that.</v>

512
00:14:37.871 --> 00:14:40.000
<v Speaker 1>He spars a lot with dove.</v>

513
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Dove is not a bad box for a Mac man,</v>

514
00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:44.230
<v Speaker 1>especially at this price,</v>

515
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.810
<v Speaker 1>especially at his prime.</v>

516
00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.680
<v Speaker 1>May hand was a monster man was a bad mother fucker,</v>

517
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:50.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

518
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.760
<v Speaker 1>like I really feel like mayhem just took too much punishment and his career.</v>

519
00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.110
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

520
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

521
00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.280
<v Speaker 1>he also had some,</v>

522
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:01.820
<v Speaker 1>some obvious deep mental health issues and demons.</v>

523
00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.473
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

524
00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

525
00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.401
<v Speaker 1>He a rough,</v>

526
00:15:04.401 --> 00:15:05.061
<v Speaker 1>rough upbringing.</v>

527
00:15:05.061 --> 00:15:05.680
<v Speaker 1>I just think,</v>

528
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.160
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

529
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:06.993
<v Speaker 1>I like my hand.</v>

530
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:09.401
<v Speaker 1>All those,</v>

531
00:15:09.401 --> 00:15:11.840
<v Speaker 1>those weird things you can't control.</v>

532
00:15:11.841 --> 00:15:15.620
<v Speaker 1>I think that all of that accumulated on him and then 100% brain trauma may be</v>

533
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.940
<v Speaker 1>100% brain trauma.</v>

534
00:15:16.941 --> 00:15:17.121
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

535
00:15:17.121 --> 00:15:18.820
<v Speaker 1>that Bisping fight was a motherfucker.</v>

536
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:19.251
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

537
00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:21.620
<v Speaker 1>Bisping beat the shit out of him before that though,</v>

538
00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:22.161
<v Speaker 1>cause gambling,</v>

539
00:15:22.161 --> 00:15:24.490
<v Speaker 1>that's really going into that fight like that wasn't,</v>

540
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.080
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen mayhem fight like that before he even took a punch.</v>

541
00:15:27.081 --> 00:15:27.351
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

542
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:28.610
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is he doing?</v>

543
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:28.911
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

544
00:15:28.911 --> 00:15:32.480
<v Speaker 1>that was a big fight for him because that was one of the first fights we had a</v>

545
00:15:32.481 --> 00:15:36.170
<v Speaker 1>lot to lose because he was on the ultimate fighter coaching against Bisping and</v>

546
00:15:36.171 --> 00:15:37.004
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate fighter.</v>

547
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:37.611
<v Speaker 1>He ain't had.</v>

548
00:15:37.611 --> 00:15:41.270
<v Speaker 1>See if you could pull up Mark Carr submitting Dan Bovis where the Chin to the</v>

549
00:15:41.271 --> 00:15:41.900
<v Speaker 1>eyeball.</v>

550
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:42.740

551
00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:43.820

00:15:52.371 --> 00:15:55.190
<v Speaker 1>when they would have it in a parking lot somewhere and I would always come with</v>

<v Speaker 1>Holloway has a legit chance.</v>

628
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I think Mex wins.</v>

629
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.253
<v Speaker 1>You think so?</v>

630
00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

631
00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:46.940
<v Speaker 1>I like maths in this fight.</v>

632
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.290
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

633
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.183
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that.</v>

634
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:49.740
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

635
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why he's not getting more respect.</v>

636
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't Max.</v>

637
00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

638
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.760
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking killer.</v>

639
00:17:54.761 --> 00:17:56.070
<v Speaker 1>She's getting a ton of respect.</v>

640
00:17:56.071 --> 00:17:57.060
<v Speaker 1>You don't think Max gets it?</v>

641
00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:58.230
<v Speaker 1>A lot of our spa,</v>

642
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:00.000
<v Speaker 1>not like he should or the press.</v>

643
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.430
<v Speaker 1>I liked the fact that he's willing to fight him in fucking Rio to man the</v>

644
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.260
<v Speaker 1>doesn't care.</v>

645
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.340
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't give a full book.</v>

646
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Talk about just an incredible champion though.</v>

647
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:09.570
<v Speaker 1>All know.</v>

648
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Well you know what man,</v>

649
00:18:10.501 --> 00:18:15.420
<v Speaker 1>all those legacy in his reign is always going to be tarnished by that 13 seconds</v>

650
00:18:15.421 --> 00:18:16.081
<v Speaker 1>against Mcgregor,</v>

651
00:18:16.081 --> 00:18:19.920
<v Speaker 1>which is so crazy and a bit cause you take away that fight and he's got one</v>

652
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:23.250
<v Speaker 1>brutal war with Chad Mendez where he got rocked and stunned,</v>

653
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.290
<v Speaker 1>which is a tough fight to him about part two.</v>

654
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:25.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

655
00:18:25.741 --> 00:18:27.450
<v Speaker 1>The second one would be the one of the best fights.</v>

656
00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:27.871
<v Speaker 1>Welcome.</v>

657
00:18:27.871 --> 00:18:28.704
<v Speaker 1>Great fight.</v>

658
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.460
<v Speaker 1>And then those are like the only hard moments he's had inside the octagon.</v>

659
00:18:32.461 --> 00:18:32.731
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

660
00:18:32.731 --> 00:18:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Other than like maybe round five against Ricardo Lamas.</v>

661
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Member lamas had them down and it was doing a little bit of ground and pound the</v>

662
00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:41.490
<v Speaker 1>fifth round.</v>

663
00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:42.600
<v Speaker 1>But that was like all the,</v>

664
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.980
<v Speaker 1>was too drained,</v>

665
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:44.850
<v Speaker 1>making that weight.</v>

666
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.080
<v Speaker 1>But he's smaller now,</v>

667
00:18:46.081 --> 00:18:46.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

668
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.150
<v Speaker 1>he generally looks smaller.</v>

669
00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.710
<v Speaker 1>He definitely,</v>

670
00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:50.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

671
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:52.900
<v Speaker 1>chose to slim down and because,</v>

672
00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:53.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

673
00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:54.330
<v Speaker 1>because he was,</v>

674
00:18:54.331 --> 00:18:58.200
<v Speaker 1>had unbelievably brutal weight cuts early in his career.</v>

675
00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:03.230
<v Speaker 1>He was just too big for the weight class and so he just chose to a slim his body</v>

676
00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:08.790
<v Speaker 1>down your boy Vito fights nape mark hard on that flip and that's his last fight</v>

677
00:19:08.791 --> 00:19:09.331
<v Speaker 1>in the UFC.</v>

678
00:19:09.331 --> 00:19:10.770
<v Speaker 1>And then he says he's going to go elsewhere.</v>

679
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Time for the return of T.</v>

680
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:14.663
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait.</v>

681
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.310
<v Speaker 1>He's going to Japan son,</v>

682
00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Godzilla movies.</v>

683
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.680
<v Speaker 1>Go to Japan and fight super heavyweight.</v>

684
00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:25.800
<v Speaker 1>He's going to get to 40 and celebrate that and just happen to everyone with his</v>

685
00:19:25.801 --> 00:19:27.390
<v Speaker 1>chin and the fucking shit.</v>

686
00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:28.860
<v Speaker 1>You can't find the chin,</v>

687
00:19:28.861 --> 00:19:29.640
<v Speaker 1>the eyeball thing.</v>

688
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.473
<v Speaker 1>Damn it.</v>

689
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.633
<v Speaker 1>Didn't find it.</v>

690
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Mark Kirk was in UFC 14,</v>

691
00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:36.450
<v Speaker 1>which would be on fight pass,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yellow's was Ben Johnson and Johnson,</v>

725
00:20:20.491 --> 00:20:24.360
<v Speaker 1>the one who won the gold medal and was the first like real publicly shamed</v>

726
00:20:24.361 --> 00:20:25.080
<v Speaker 1>steroids.</v>

727
00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember how fast,</v>

728
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.200
<v Speaker 1>how he pulled away from Carl Lewis and everybody?</v>

729
00:20:28.201 --> 00:20:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Just what you remember what he looked like,</v>

730
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:31.290
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

731
00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Carl Lewis was on steroids to correct all of them.</v>

732
00:20:33.751 --> 00:20:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Were his and Ben Johnson just better,</v>

733
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:35.911
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

734
00:20:35.911 --> 00:20:37.020
<v Speaker 1>he just took way too much.</v>

735
00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Took it to the Simpson.</v>

736
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:39.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

737
00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:40.104
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

738
00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what Carl Lewis was on,</v>

739
00:20:41.941 --> 00:20:44.850
<v Speaker 1>but I do know Carl Lewis tested positive for quite a few things.</v>

740
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.800
<v Speaker 1>When I started researching the history of doping,</v>

741
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.020
<v Speaker 1>when I had Victor Conte on from the Barco scandal and the ultimate,</v>

742
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.220
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate super snitch,</v>

743
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.930
<v Speaker 1>he's the super snitch of all time.</v>

744
00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.080
<v Speaker 1>And then talking to Lance Armstrong and understanding like,</v>

745
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:00.911
<v Speaker 1>and then going into,</v>

746
00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:04.870
<v Speaker 1>I watched maybe five or six documentaries on,</v>

747
00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.940
<v Speaker 1>on drugs and sport,</v>

748
00:21:05.941 --> 00:21:07.840
<v Speaker 1>get your masters if you watch that many documentaries,</v>

749
00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.560
<v Speaker 1>when I feel the college degree,</v>

750
00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:12.820
<v Speaker 1>I watched three of them and be like,</v>

751
00:21:12.821 --> 00:21:13.654
<v Speaker 1>I got this.</v>

752
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:14.231
<v Speaker 1>I got them.</v>

753
00:21:14.231 --> 00:21:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Ask If,</v>

754
00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:19.420
<v Speaker 1>so what I did take out of it was that like according to Victor,</v>

755
00:21:19.421 --> 00:21:20.254
<v Speaker 1>Kanye,</v>

756
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.870
<v Speaker 1>all of the track and field athletes are dirty.</v>

757
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.490
<v Speaker 1>It's more prevalent than track and field</v>

758
00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:30.160
<v Speaker 1>track and field 100% what he was saying essentially was that what Ben Johnson</v>

759
00:21:30.161 --> 00:21:30.994
<v Speaker 1>did was get caught.</v>

760
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.910
<v Speaker 1>But there was a lot of people that do it and not only were they doing it,</v>

761
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:37.690
<v Speaker 1>but it was coordinated by coaches who was coordinating part of the game.</v>

762
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:40.000
<v Speaker 1>And I say this all the time,</v>

763
00:21:40.001 --> 00:21:42.670
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just part of professional sports.</v>

764
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:43.601
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

765
00:21:43.601 --> 00:21:45.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying your favorite guys doing it,</v>

766
00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:46.940
<v Speaker 1>but you know the,</v>

767
00:21:46.941 --> 00:21:49.990
<v Speaker 1>the odds are there's a lot of these guys that you see on TV are doing it.</v>

768
00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys think that there's this part of the game steroids in boxing?</v>

769
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:53.111
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

770
00:21:53.111 --> 00:21:53.650
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

771
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

772
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:54.880
<v Speaker 1>that's a serious question.</v>

773
00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Well don't you understand that Shannon Briggs just got pulled out of his world</v>

774
00:21:58.301 --> 00:22:01.810
<v Speaker 1>title fights per test and he's 45 he's 45.</v>

775
00:22:01.811 --> 00:22:02.521
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about like,</v>

776
00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:03.580
<v Speaker 1>cause not to say,</v>

777
00:22:03.581 --> 00:22:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying anybody's doing it,</v>

778
00:22:04.691 --> 00:22:08.780
<v Speaker 1>but when I watched the Kell Brook or all spans fight great fight by the way.</v>

779
00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:11.200
<v Speaker 1>Amazing fighters spends on it.</v>

780
00:22:11.201 --> 00:22:12.880
<v Speaker 1>Athlete New World Champs,</v>

781
00:22:12.881 --> 00:22:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Right Doug?</v>

782
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

783
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:18.970
<v Speaker 1>that's right on an athlete in his domain and he got it kind of boxed up for the</v>

784
00:22:20.291 --> 00:22:21.124
<v Speaker 1>first few rounds.</v>

785
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:22.390
<v Speaker 1>But winning those firsts when the,</v>

786
00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.790
<v Speaker 1>when they brought up the scorecard and like,</v>

787
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:23.991
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

788
00:22:23.991 --> 00:22:24.641
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>

789
00:22:24.641 --> 00:22:25.474
<v Speaker 1>I feel like broken.</v>

790
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Well I agreed with what's his face?</v>

791
00:22:28.841 --> 00:22:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

792
00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Steve Farr firewood.</v>

793
00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:30.521
<v Speaker 1>Is that his name?</v>

794
00:22:30.521 --> 00:22:31.031
<v Speaker 1>Steve Farr.</v>

795
00:22:31.031 --> 00:22:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Hood,</v>

796
00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:32.020
<v Speaker 1>firewood.</v>

797
00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.260
<v Speaker 1>And each time what that brought up the,</v>

798
00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:35.830
<v Speaker 1>he's the herald letter of enough showtime a lot better though.</v>

799
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:37.510
<v Speaker 1>You like them better?</v>

800
00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

801
00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:38.700
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

802
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:39.700
<v Speaker 1>all right everybody,</v>

803
00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:40.653
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>

804
00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

805
00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:44.110
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad crash.</v>

806
00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.250
<v Speaker 1>It's so intense.</v>

807
00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.600
<v Speaker 1>It's so intense.</v>

808
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:48.270
<v Speaker 1>It throws me off.</v>

809
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.540
<v Speaker 1>But that fight was great.</v>

810
00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:49.900
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

811
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.330
<v Speaker 1>I had Kell Brook right in there that round seven.</v>

812
00:22:52.331 --> 00:22:54.940
<v Speaker 1>He was still doing work around or two away at least.</v>

813
00:22:54.941 --> 00:22:59.380
<v Speaker 1>And then Spence just put it on them and those body shots were ruthless and his</v>

814
00:22:59.381 --> 00:23:00.880
<v Speaker 1>endurance is incredible.</v>

815
00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:01.240
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

816
00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.600
<v Speaker 1>my favorite part is if you go back and listen carefully to the corners,</v>

817
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.980
<v Speaker 1>they pulled out at the same game plan.</v>

818
00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:06.221
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

819
00:23:06.221 --> 00:23:06.760
<v Speaker 1>We just got again,</v>

820
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.910
<v Speaker 1>pass the 10th round and then we're gonna put it on him and they go to the other</v>

821
00:23:09.911 --> 00:23:10.270
<v Speaker 1>corner.</v>

822
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Let's just get past the 10 and then it's all you baby.</v>

823
00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

824
00:23:13.061 --> 00:23:14.270
<v Speaker 1>they both say the same thing.</v>

825
00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

826
00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.061
<v Speaker 1>Kell Brook.</v>

827
00:23:15.061 --> 00:23:15.311
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

828
00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:18.770
<v Speaker 1>That Spence was just not experienced enough and didn't have the cause.</v>

829
00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.820
<v Speaker 1>He's been knocking everybody out and he's really been,</v>

830
00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:24.070
<v Speaker 1>he's only done 10 rounds and his corner fell.</v>

831
00:23:24.071 --> 00:23:25.420
<v Speaker 1>A Kell Brook cut too much weight.</v>

832
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

833
00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:27.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's where you want to quit.</v>

918
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.240
<v Speaker 1>That's a legit move.</v>

919
00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:30.830
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you can still do that.</v>

920
00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.680
<v Speaker 1>The challenge in the eye and I'm using it and my next door neighbor said that.</v>

921
00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:33.891
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

922
00:25:33.891 --> 00:25:34.820
<v Speaker 1>you can't touch the eyes.</v>

923
00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.291
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing.</v>

924
00:25:35.291 --> 00:25:36.140
<v Speaker 1>You're not touching it.</v>

925
00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.880
<v Speaker 1>You're just holding onto him sneaking the Chin into the eye socket recently.</v>

926
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.540
<v Speaker 1>What'd you say,</v>

927
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

928
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.970
<v Speaker 1>There's another fight in a form that said it happened in two.</v>

929
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:44.923
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

930
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.823
<v Speaker 1>Interesting guys.</v>

931
00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.313
<v Speaker 1>Algin correct.</v>

932
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.750
<v Speaker 1>There was a fight recently with your Chin Sorta,</v>

933
00:25:50.751 --> 00:25:53.660
<v Speaker 1>but I mean isn't it an eye gouging when you shoved her knuckle in there?</v>

934
00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:54.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

935
00:25:54.501 --> 00:25:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Which is also illegal,</v>

936
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:56.563
<v Speaker 1>but when you knuckle,</v>

937
00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.500
<v Speaker 1>when you punch someone,</v>

938
00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:00.500
<v Speaker 1>but that's unintentional.</v>

939
00:26:00.501 --> 00:26:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Is it short?</v>

940
00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:02.560
<v Speaker 1>Is trying to punch him in the eyeball,</v>

941
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:03.620
<v Speaker 1>try and punch me with other things.</v>

942
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:06.730
<v Speaker 1>But Haysman beat Elvis and no cinesync</v>

943
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:09.183
<v Speaker 1>belt.</v>

944
00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:10.100
<v Speaker 1>It was a while ago.</v>

945
00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.700
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting because Elvis is a Machado black belt.</v>

946
00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:13.963
<v Speaker 1>What's this commercial?</v>

950
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:20.121

956
00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:28.820
<v Speaker 1>where the guy was covering the other guy's mouth so he couldn't breathe.</v>

957
00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:30.860
<v Speaker 1>That sounds brutal.</v>

958
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.281
<v Speaker 1>Brutal.</v>

959
00:26:31.281 --> 00:26:32.114
<v Speaker 1>And time.</v>

960

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

961
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.621
<v Speaker 1>that's not that bad.</v>

962
00:26:33.621 --> 00:26:33.890
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

963
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:34.481
<v Speaker 1>Bj Penn,</v>

964
00:26:34.481 --> 00:26:35.241
<v Speaker 1>you do that all the time.</v>

965
00:26:35.241 --> 00:26:36.530
<v Speaker 1>That's how he used to get guys to,</v>

966
00:26:36.531 --> 00:26:37.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

967
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:40.460
<v Speaker 1>he would cover their mouth when he took their back and then they would try to</v>

968
00:26:40.461 --> 00:26:44.140
<v Speaker 1>stop that and then he would grab their arm with his leg and then he would choke</v>

969
00:26:44.141 --> 00:26:44.610
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

970
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Ken Anderson,</v>

971
00:26:45.511 --> 00:26:46.440
<v Speaker 1>Anderson Silva.</v>

972
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:47.833
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

973
00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Common move.</v>

974

976
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:50.670
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty common.</v>

977
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.793
<v Speaker 1>I don't use it.</v>

978
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:53.421

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Doug Davidoff use it as a master.</v>

982
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Who's doing it there?</v>

983
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Chris Haysman.</v>

984
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Elvis.</v>

985
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Elvis in a sick,</v>

986
00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:04.861
<v Speaker 1>that's the shit.</v>

00:27:04.861 --> 00:27:06.410
<v Speaker 1>That whole just wore back a little bit with this.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is no gloves too.</v>

991
00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

992
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:13.140
<v Speaker 1>Elvis might not have even been a black belt back then.</v>

993
00:27:13.141 --> 00:27:13.770
<v Speaker 1>He's tapping.</v>

994
00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:14.461
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>

995
00:27:14.461 --> 00:27:16.830
<v Speaker 1>He's tapping to the eyeball to eyeball.</v>

996
00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:17.723
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

997
00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Chris Haysman also had a fucking wicked front lake sidekick.</v>

998
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.340
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the first guys in MMA.</v>

999
00:27:23.341 --> 00:27:25.710
<v Speaker 1>They figured out how to use our front leg side kick.</v>

1000
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Well like I just fucking poked his out and had a flat top so it gets the win</v>

1001
00:27:29.271 --> 00:27:29.430
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1002
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:32.800
<v Speaker 1>That's Haysman flat top pace speaking advice.</v>

1003
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Did Kell Brook hurt the same break?</v>

1004
00:27:34.981 --> 00:27:35.581
<v Speaker 1>The same orbital?</v>

1005
00:27:35.581 --> 00:27:36.980
<v Speaker 1>No different than one tip.</v>

1006
00:27:36.981 --> 00:27:38.970
<v Speaker 1>And I hear he's got titanium,</v>

1007
00:27:38.971 --> 00:27:39.330
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1008
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Is that for the titanium from triple g?</v>

1009
00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:43.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1010
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.520
<v Speaker 1>he got boxed up.</v>

1011
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:48.420
<v Speaker 1>God maybe it's good to have two titanium eyes and then the other one broken too.</v>

1012
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Did he break his left leg keep too,</v>

1013
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:50.581
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he did.</v>

1014
00:27:50.581 --> 00:27:53.090
<v Speaker 1>His addiction needs similar thing.</v>

1015
00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1016
00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:54.840
<v Speaker 1>that was a bummer man.</v>

1017
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

1018
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:58.230
<v Speaker 1>I was all flattened out but he also could have been like really paranoid about</v>

1019
00:27:58.231 --> 00:27:59.310
<v Speaker 1>it because of the triple chins.</v>

1020
00:27:59.311 --> 00:28:01.080
<v Speaker 1>What I think cause he went back surgery,</v>

1021
00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:01.470
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1022
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:02.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm not losing my left wider.</v>

1023
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:03.653
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

1024
00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:04.710
<v Speaker 1>It's always in your mind.</v>

1025
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:05.581
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

1026
00:28:05.581 --> 00:28:07.800
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what kind of vision damage he suffered.</v>

1027
00:28:07.801 --> 00:28:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Like a guy like Bisping's tough as fuck.</v>

1028
00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.960
<v Speaker 1>He will tell you he's got bad vision in his right eye.</v>

1029
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:17.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean you won't hear someone come to a fight or analyze a fight about bisman</v>

1030
00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:17.611
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1031
00:28:17.611 --> 00:28:19.800
<v Speaker 1>And he's also doing it with one and a half eyes.</v>

1032
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:21.960
<v Speaker 1>Like it's well known knowledge like you suffering.</v>

1033
00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:22.890
<v Speaker 1>But what is the deal?</v>

1034
00:28:22.891 --> 00:28:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Because back in the day,</v>

1035
00:28:23.971 --> 00:28:27.060
<v Speaker 1>like if you had like a detached retina or something,</v>

1036
00:28:27.061 --> 00:28:28.080
<v Speaker 1>like they wouldn't let you fight.</v>

1037
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.321
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1038
00:28:28.321 --> 00:28:28.921
<v Speaker 1>because he's got,</v>

1039
00:28:28.921 --> 00:28:30.750
<v Speaker 1>so I talked to him a little bit about it.</v>

1040
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:32.920
<v Speaker 1>He's got oil now,</v>

1041
00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:33.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fuck this up</v>

1042
00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.310
<v Speaker 1>so he can't really fix it yet.</v>

1043
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:39.411
<v Speaker 1>He's takes his it.</v>

1044
00:28:39.411 --> 00:28:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1045
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:41.850
<v Speaker 1>because if he gets another shot then it could do more damage.</v>

1046
00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:42.150
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1047
00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:42.983
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if the,</v>

1048
00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:46.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it kind of came up with the thing with GSP to,</v>

1049
00:28:46.351 --> 00:28:48.270
<v Speaker 1>it's his medical that has something to do with his eye.</v>

1050
00:28:48.271 --> 00:28:48.811
<v Speaker 1>It came out,</v>

1051
00:28:48.811 --> 00:28:49.870
<v Speaker 1>now it's,</v>

1052
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.250
<v Speaker 1>we talked about it.</v>

1053
00:28:51.251 --> 00:28:51.720
<v Speaker 1>He's got a,</v>

1054
00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.940
<v Speaker 1>what's called a floater in his eye.</v>

1055
00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:54.803
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1056
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:56.490
<v Speaker 1>it's like a little bit of damage.</v>

1057
00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.350
<v Speaker 1>There's something going on with his eyeball.</v>

1058
00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.050
<v Speaker 1>And that was the holdup is skewed to fight.</v>

1059
00:29:01.051 --> 00:29:01.801
<v Speaker 1>I hate when people,</v>

1060
00:29:01.801 --> 00:29:02.071
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1061
00:29:02.071 --> 00:29:02.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1062
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.510
<v Speaker 1>do you have see knew about it?</v>

1063
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:04.561
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knew about it,</v>

1064
00:29:04.561 --> 00:29:06.000
<v Speaker 1>but they were hoping that they could fix it.</v>

1065
00:29:06.001 --> 00:29:08.640
<v Speaker 1>And I believe they gave some injections to his eye.</v>

1066
00:29:08.641 --> 00:29:09.630
<v Speaker 1>They tried to repair it.</v>

1067
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.910
<v Speaker 1>It's not like threatening his vision.</v>

1068
00:29:11.911 --> 00:29:13.110
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a permanent issue.</v>

1069
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:13.973
<v Speaker 1>It's a time issue.</v>

1070
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:14.790
<v Speaker 1>So this guy,</v>

1071
00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:15.780
<v Speaker 1>something needs to heal.</v>

1072
00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:19.690
<v Speaker 1>This guy cut zero weight and the other guy cut 30 pounds.</v>

1073
00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.461
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

1074
00:29:20.461 --> 00:29:20.821
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1075
00:29:20.821 --> 00:29:24.780
<v Speaker 1>But I liked the way that guys throwing it's old school karate sidekicks a warm</v>

1076
00:29:24.781 --> 00:29:25.440
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1077
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.520
<v Speaker 1>I like mark as a ref.</v>

1078
00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:26.980

<v Speaker 1>Did they say?</v>

1082
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:30.930
<v Speaker 1>I think they said he's 19 now.</v>

1083
00:29:30.931 --> 00:29:31.710
<v Speaker 1>He's 25.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Who's the youngest guy to ever fight in the UFC?</v>

1099
00:29:45.341 --> 00:29:48.300
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it's Dan Lozan for it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's really bad.</v>

1119
00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.010
<v Speaker 2>Back to he laughed at it.</v>

1120
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:19.810
<v Speaker 2>He's very karate based though.</v>

1121
00:30:19.811 --> 00:30:20.411
<v Speaker 2>You could tell,</v>

1122
00:30:20.411 --> 00:30:21.790
<v Speaker 2>but him throwing that,</v>

1123
00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:23.283
<v Speaker 2>that kick.</v>

1124
00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:24.660
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

1125
00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:28.120

1126
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:28.961
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say he was 20.</v>

1127
00:30:28.961 --> 00:30:29.830
<v Speaker 2>He might've been the youngest.</v>

1128
00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:30.700
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

1129
00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:31.061
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1130
00:30:31.061 --> 00:30:31.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1131
00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:33.760
<v Speaker 2>Not Man's composed.</v>

1132
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1133
00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.590
<v Speaker 2>He knocked out Jens Pulver the left Hook,</v>

1134
00:30:38.591 --> 00:30:38.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1135
00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:39.260
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1136
00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:39.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:40.061
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1138
00:30:40.061 --> 00:30:41.290
<v Speaker 2>And he's a huge underdog.</v>

1139
00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:43.090
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>

1140
00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Loads on.</v>

1141
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Still doing the damn thing too.</v>

1142
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.030
<v Speaker 2>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

1143
00:30:46.031 --> 00:30:50.500
<v Speaker 2>Joe Lowe's smart as shit to super smart guy.</v>

1144
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:51.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1145
00:30:51.131 --> 00:30:53.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean easily could have been like some it tech guy.</v>

1146
00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1147
00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:54.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1148
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.860
<v Speaker 2>But he said Chunky for adrenaline.</v>

1149
00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.750
<v Speaker 2>He's a beast video game guy too.</v>

1150
00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.110
<v Speaker 2>This guy is definitely taekwondo guy.</v>

1151
00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:03.410
<v Speaker 2>Say That guy's name and camp.</v>

1152
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:04.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's taekwondo,</v>

1153
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.660
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1154
00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:05.560
<v Speaker 2>I think it's karate.</v>

1155
00:31:05.561 --> 00:31:06.430
<v Speaker 2>I could be wrong,</v>

1156
00:31:06.431 --> 00:31:09.580
<v Speaker 2>but you know the thing of the problem with saying it's taekwondo versus karate.</v>

1157
00:31:09.581 --> 00:31:11.850
<v Speaker 2>He's like a really depends on who's teaching a kick,</v>

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Puncture.</v>

1447
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:47.250
<v Speaker 1>If Brendan has something in his head,</v>

1448
00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:49.530
<v Speaker 1>if he starts talking about it isn't going to happen.</v>

1449
00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.300
<v Speaker 1>It's going to help with these older cut.</v>

1450
00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Like I've looked at a few now.</v>

1451
00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:53.700
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1452
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.230
<v Speaker 1>it's just like a weekend driver.</v>

1453
00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1454
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1455
00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:57.480
<v Speaker 1>what do you recommend for a Porsche?</v>

1456
00:37:57.481 --> 00:37:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to get a used one,</v>

1457
00:37:58.450 --> 00:37:59.283
<v Speaker 1>Brendan?</v>

1458
00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:03.640
<v Speaker 1>78 there's some really good used Porsches like you.</v>

1459
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:03.961
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1460
00:38:03.961 --> 00:38:04.980
<v Speaker 1>even the early models,</v>

1461
00:38:04.981 --> 00:38:06.000
<v Speaker 1>they're really fun to drive,</v>

1462
00:38:06.001 --> 00:38:07.440
<v Speaker 1>but you got to know what you're getting into.</v>

1463
00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1464
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:08.910
<v Speaker 1>You don't want a lemon.</v>

1465
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.830
<v Speaker 1>And those cars are really,</v>

1466
00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.750
<v Speaker 1>they're really fickle.</v>

1467
00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Like when you turn it,</v>

1468
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:17.460
<v Speaker 1>like say if you're making a turn and you're on the gas,</v>

1469
00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:18.990
<v Speaker 1>if you let up off the gas,</v>

1470
00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:23.660
<v Speaker 1>they'll oversteer like the back half ass end of the car will come out on it.</v>

1471
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.761
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1472
00:38:23.761 --> 00:38:25.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a far cry from the,</v>

1473
00:38:25.201 --> 00:38:25.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1474
00:38:25.441 --> 00:38:26.161
<v Speaker 1>a new Porsche,</v>

1475
00:38:26.161 --> 00:38:26.994
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1476
00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:27.921
<v Speaker 1>New Twin Turbo.</v>

1477
00:38:27.921 --> 00:38:32.370
<v Speaker 1>That nine nine one that you use to drive like that is as modern as it gets.</v>

1478
00:38:32.371 --> 00:38:34.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean those things are glued to the fucking road.</v>

1479
00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.200
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1480
00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:35.681
<v Speaker 1>But this one,</v>

1481
00:38:35.681 --> 00:38:36.101
<v Speaker 1>this one that's,</v>

1482
00:38:36.101 --> 00:38:37.480
<v Speaker 1>the modifications can be sick.</v>

1483
00:38:37.481 --> 00:38:40.000
<v Speaker 1>I like the old school vibe to borrow my car for a day.</v>

1484
00:38:40.001 --> 00:38:41.470
<v Speaker 1>You'll throw that other car on the trash.</v>

1485
00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.241
<v Speaker 1>Your gt three.</v>

1486
00:38:43.241 --> 00:38:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1487
00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:46.960
<v Speaker 1>You'll light that 1987 shitbox on fire.</v>

1488
00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Hey Bro,</v>

1489
00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:49.213

1490
00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:55.650
<v Speaker 1>dealership fucking lows things to for like that dad uses to start a fire on one</v>

1491
00:38:56.951 --> 00:38:57.311

1494
00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Or are those Coleman grills for camping?</v>

1495
00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Squirt it all over the car and light it on fire.</v>

1496
00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:03.281
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1497
00:39:03.281 --> 00:39:06.910
<v Speaker 1>I saw someone in a brand new gt three it was purple.</v>

1498
00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:07.721
<v Speaker 1>The GT three Rs.</v>

1499
00:39:07.721 --> 00:39:07.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1500
00:39:07.951 --> 00:39:09.910
<v Speaker 1>They make them fucking purple.</v>

1501
00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Those are those cars.</v>

1502
00:39:10.991 --> 00:39:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Mass dealer.</v>

1503
00:39:11.921 --> 00:39:12.390
<v Speaker 1>So dot.</v>

1504
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:13.051
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

1505
00:39:13.051 --> 00:39:13.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm was sick.</v>

1506
00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:16.150
<v Speaker 1>They finally make it with a manual transmission again.</v>

1507
00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Finally the 2007 nor dean to lab side control the 2017 so you could finally get</v>

1508
00:39:22.211 --> 00:39:24.400
<v Speaker 1>them in the manual transmission work complaining.</v>

1509
00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Well it's Porsche was trying too hard to just get lap times and people were</v>

1510
00:39:28.361 --> 00:39:31.780
<v Speaker 1>pissed and they were complaining like what the fuck does a gt three how come</v>

1511
00:39:31.781 --> 00:39:32.680
<v Speaker 1>it's a double clutch?</v>

1512
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Well how come I can't get it with a manual transmission?</v>

1513
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.380
<v Speaker 1>So finally they um,</v>

1514
00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.450
<v Speaker 1>they released this thing,</v>

1515
00:39:37.451 --> 00:39:42.070
<v Speaker 1>the nine 11 r which was essentially like a gt three without the wing.</v>

1516
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Good luck getting that thing.</v>

1517
00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.750
<v Speaker 1>People are selling them for like half a million dollars in more.</v>

1518
00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.910
<v Speaker 1>They only made how many hundred or 911 crazy.</v>

1519
00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:53.140
<v Speaker 1>They made 911 and the light with the stripes.</v>

1520
00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:53.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1521
00:39:53.501 --> 00:39:55.840
<v Speaker 1>But now they're saying that this new gt three,</v>

1522
00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:59.200
<v Speaker 1>the manual one that you could actually just buy is actually better than the nine</v>

1523
00:39:59.201 --> 00:40:03.310
<v Speaker 1>11 are cause the reason the automatics,</v>

1524
00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:04.960
<v Speaker 1>the PDK is it's,</v>

1525
00:40:04.961 --> 00:40:07.960
<v Speaker 1>you know it's faster than humans will track time.</v>

1526
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.540
<v Speaker 1>We can't keep up with do you mean faster than humans?</v>

1527
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Like shifting stuff like that.</v>

1528
00:40:12.701 --> 00:40:17.020
<v Speaker 1>The computer does computers better track time and it's instantaneous.</v>

1529
00:40:17.021 --> 00:40:20.620
<v Speaker 1>It has two clutches so it has one clutch that's in like say if you're in first</v>

1530
00:40:20.621 --> 00:40:20.801
<v Speaker 1>gear,</v>

1531
00:40:20.801 --> 00:40:22.000
<v Speaker 1>there's one clutches in first gear.</v>

1532
00:40:22.001 --> 00:40:24.280
<v Speaker 1>The second clutch is already engaged in the second gear.</v>

1533
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:25.421
<v Speaker 1>So would you hit it?</v>

1534
00:40:25.421 --> 00:40:26.260
<v Speaker 1>It's instantaneous.</v>

1535
00:40:26.261 --> 00:40:27.094
<v Speaker 1>Like Bam,</v>

1536
00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:29.860
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

1537
00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:30.970
<v Speaker 1>so you don't have to shift it.</v>

1538
00:40:30.971 --> 00:40:32.290
<v Speaker 1>It takes shifting out of the gate.</v>

1539
00:40:32.291 --> 00:40:34.840
<v Speaker 1>You can have it in automatic and it'll shift for itself.</v>

1540
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Or you can have it in manual and you shift with the paddles but you don't have</v>

1541
00:40:37.931 --> 00:40:41.020
<v Speaker 1>to push the clutch in so you're not pushing your left leg.</v>

1542
00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:43.200
<v Speaker 1>That kind of takes away from the trials.</v>

1543
00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1544
00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:44.650
<v Speaker 1>the fun you will find it.</v>

1545
00:40:44.651 --> 00:40:45.970
<v Speaker 1>The driving feeling get automatic.</v>

1546
00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:47.950
<v Speaker 1>I though my Porsche had those,</v>

1547
00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:52.390
<v Speaker 1>the panels is lame and thinks about computers and stuff where they,</v>

1548
00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:56.250
<v Speaker 1>they take out the tactile enjoyment and the,</v>

1549
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:58.740
<v Speaker 1>the timing and the human timing and all that.</v>

1550
00:40:58.740 --> 00:40:58.841
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1551
00:40:58.841 --> 00:40:59.040
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1552
00:40:59.040 --> 00:40:59.261
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1553
00:40:59.261 --> 00:41:01.050
<v Speaker 1>it Kinda makes it not that much fun anymore.</v>

1554
00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:02.860
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine with your car it may,</v>

1555
00:41:02.861 --> 00:41:06.010
<v Speaker 1>it really makes a big difference unless you're on a race track.</v>

1556
00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're on a race track and you're just trying to get zero to whatever,</v>

1557
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:10.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1558
00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:12.670
<v Speaker 1>zero to 60 times and make sure that your,</v>

1559
00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.140
<v Speaker 1>your lap times are quicker,</v>

1560
00:41:14.141 --> 00:41:16.750
<v Speaker 1>then you want something that shifts instantaneously.</v>

1561
00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:21.220
<v Speaker 1>But those are also to put up numbers cause like the new viper they see are</v>

1562
00:41:21.221 --> 00:41:22.480
<v Speaker 1>compared to the new Porsche,</v>

1563
00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:23.350
<v Speaker 1>the lap times,</v>

1564
00:41:23.351 --> 00:41:26.140
<v Speaker 1>they don't wanna look bad so they can put their best foot forward.</v>

1565
00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Well the problem with the Viper is a viper is a standard.</v>

1566
00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:30.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a manual transmission,</v>

1567
00:41:30.431 --> 00:41:32.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's so fucking fast.</v>

1568
00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:33.711
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

1569
00:41:33.711 --> 00:41:36.830
<v Speaker 1>They bring that viper ACR to every track and they go,</v>

1570
00:41:36.831 --> 00:41:37.071
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1571
00:41:37.071 --> 00:41:38.360
<v Speaker 1>we're here to break the new track,</v>

1572
00:41:38.361 --> 00:41:40.280
<v Speaker 1>record the fuck out of the way.</v>

1573
00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:43.520
<v Speaker 1>We have the most ridiculous car America has ever built.</v>

1574
00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:45.350
<v Speaker 1>It's got wings all over it.</v>

1575
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:46.221
<v Speaker 1>She's a student.</v>

1576
00:41:46.221 --> 00:41:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Whenever we talked about this,</v>

1577
00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:50.000
<v Speaker 1>the same guy shoots me Dan and he's like,</v>

1578
00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:51.820
<v Speaker 1>it's a picture of the viper hair.</v>

1579
00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:53.600
<v Speaker 1>It is man for this price and like,</v>

1580
00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.270
<v Speaker 1>oh it's like a little jarring.</v>

1581
00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Scott's it got Eylea so you're,</v>

1582
00:41:56.871 --> 00:41:59.000
<v Speaker 1>you're just drawn that that has no Lord.</v>

1583
00:41:59.001 --> 00:42:04.001
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're drawn to it like a huge engine like pissy pull up viper ACR.</v>

1584
00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.410

<v Speaker 1>A little bit like an asshole pulling up in that though.</v>

1667
00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I feel like an asshole poem for my GG three na,</v>

1668

<v Speaker 1>but I do it.</v>

1669
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:28.860

1670
00:44:28.861 --> 00:44:29.694

1676
00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:38.250
<v Speaker 2>but he's gotten bigger.</v>

1677
00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.330
<v Speaker 2>As the fight progressed.</v>

1678
00:44:39.331 --> 00:44:40.164
<v Speaker 2>I feel like he's,</v>

1679

<v Speaker 2>I feel like he's just somehow that this is chosen return.</v>

1680
00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:45.150

1773
00:47:20.461 --> 00:47:20.851
<v Speaker 2>I wonder,</v>

1774
00:47:20.851 --> 00:47:21.210
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1775
00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:22.021
<v Speaker 2>this is interesting.</v>

1776
00:47:22.021 --> 00:47:24.890
<v Speaker 2>We're just doing at the viper now I'm talking about France,</v>

1777
00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:26.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1778
00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:28.170
<v Speaker 2>to soaring.</v>

1779
00:47:28.171 --> 00:47:29.550
<v Speaker 2>You don't understand why</v>

1780
00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:34.120
<v Speaker 1>the idea that a viper is a stimulating experience.</v>

1781
00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1782
00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.330
<v Speaker 1>I have no experience with those kinds of cars.</v>

1783
00:47:37.331 --> 00:47:38.410
<v Speaker 1>You haven't been in my test,</v>

1784
00:47:38.411 --> 00:47:41.500
<v Speaker 1>so when I've opened her up did I have a bit of driven tests now feel about that</v>

1785
00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.473
<v Speaker 1>very fast.</v>

1786
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:43.270
<v Speaker 1>I like them.</v>

1787
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1788
00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Greg do not.</v>

1789
00:47:44.471 --> 00:47:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I just don't like,</v>

1790
00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:47.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the fact that they run out of batteries quick.</v>

1791
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1792
00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the fact that Sam Harris has left him stranded twice.</v>

1793
00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:52.083
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>

1794
00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:52.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not weird.</v>

1795
00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:55.870
<v Speaker 1>I think for a guy who's not a car guy like me who doesn't get off on the,</v>

1796
00:47:55.871 --> 00:47:56.630
<v Speaker 1>my mom,</v>

1797
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:57.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1798
00:47:57.310 --> 00:48:02.050
<v Speaker 1>I liked that I don't have to go to a gas station and got more issues charging</v>

1799
00:48:02.051 --> 00:48:02.531
<v Speaker 1>like you're like,</v>

1800
00:48:02.531 --> 00:48:02.711
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1801
00:48:02.711 --> 00:48:04.030
<v Speaker 1>I got to find somewhere to charge.</v>

1802
00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:05.770
<v Speaker 1>It is an issue all the time.</v>

1803
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:06.480
<v Speaker 1>He'll be like,</v>

1804
00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:07.700
<v Speaker 1>let me draw your a scatterbrain.</v>

1805
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:10.720
<v Speaker 1>You'll probably want those guys doesn't charge car for you.</v>

1806
00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:11.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1807
00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.130
<v Speaker 1>That's not a car scattered.</v>

1808
00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1809
00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a gas station everywhere.</v>

1810
00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1811
00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:17.140
<v Speaker 1>When you charge at my house.</v>

1812
00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:17.950
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1813
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:18.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1814
00:48:18.101 --> 00:48:18.880
<v Speaker 1>You just plug it in.</v>

1815
00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:19.740
<v Speaker 1>There's superchargers.</v>

1816
00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:20.723
<v Speaker 1>Supercharged,</v>

1817
00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:21.550
<v Speaker 1>supercharged,</v>

1818
00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:22.700
<v Speaker 1>but good luck finding him safely.</v>

1819
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Drive the Improv and you're like,</v>

1820
00:48:23.981 --> 00:48:24.401

00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:25.061
<v Speaker 1>I need to charge.</v>

1822
00:48:25.061 --> 00:48:25.720
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

1823
00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:26.531
<v Speaker 1>You've got some issues.</v>

1824
00:48:26.531 --> 00:48:26.671
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1825
00:48:26.671 --> 00:48:27.011
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1826
00:48:27.011 --> 00:48:29.080
<v Speaker 1>I've call up a rich made it to my,</v>

1827
00:48:29.081 --> 00:48:31.750
<v Speaker 1>I've made it to my driveway with zero battery.</v>

1828
00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Zero,</v>

1829
00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:34.150
<v Speaker 1>like literally zero where I was.</v>

1830
00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not as hard as us.</v>

1831
00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:35.801
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1832
00:48:35.801 --> 00:48:37.030
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible though.</v>

1833
00:48:37.031 --> 00:48:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

1834
00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:41.320
<v Speaker 1>I drove to Irvine and then I realized halfway back from Irvine or I'm going to</v>

1835
00:48:41.321 --> 00:48:43.030
<v Speaker 1>be June 8th and ninth and 10th,</v>

1836
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1837
00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:45.640
<v Speaker 1>where I realized halfway through that I was done.</v>

1838
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I was,</v>

1839
00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:49.860
<v Speaker 1>I was not going to make it back so I had to stop and charge it.</v>

1840
00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.290
<v Speaker 1>And then how long do we have to wait to charge?</v>

1841
00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:52.133
<v Speaker 1>Takes forever.</v>

1842
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:54.070
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have a supercharger,</v>

1843
00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:54.401
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1844
00:48:54.401 --> 00:48:54.941
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1845
00:48:54.941 --> 00:48:56.200
<v Speaker 1>those charges they have in,</v>

1846
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:59.770
<v Speaker 1>in garages are complete bullshit for an hour you'll get,</v>

1847
00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:00.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1848
00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:01.563
<v Speaker 1>18 miles.</v>

1849
00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Those ones you can stop by on the road or be struggling.</v>

1850
00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:04.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1851
00:49:04.211 --> 00:49:05.044
<v Speaker 1>those are great.</v>

1852
00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:06.011
<v Speaker 1>Those and a half hour.</v>

1853
00:49:06.011 --> 00:49:06.430
<v Speaker 1>You're good.</v>

1854
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Where are those were all over?</v>

1855
00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Not really all over yet,</v>

1856
00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:11.110
<v Speaker 1>but I will say this,</v>

1857
00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:12.490
<v Speaker 1>that they're trying,</v>

1858
00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:12.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1859
00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Tesla's trying to get up stations where you can go in and they switch her</v>

1860
00:49:16.211 --> 00:49:17.080
<v Speaker 1>battery out right there.</v>

1861
00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

1862
00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Guess who want to lead I think.</v>

1863
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:22.320
<v Speaker 1>I think probably to leave the,</v>

1864
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:23.830
<v Speaker 1>we're going to come down to the third round.</v>

1865
00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Boy they're going hard with this thing because he was on telling you that shit</v>

1866
00:49:27.671 --> 00:49:28.510
<v Speaker 1>is so depressing.</v>

1867
00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:29.890
<v Speaker 1>What's that logo?</v>

1868
00:49:29.891 --> 00:49:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck out of my face with the ads are brutal.</v>

1869
00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Those shows me in the UFC when a fight starts and they have to do an nor dean to</v>

00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:24.760
<v Speaker 1>Like I have zero script areas like that.</v>

2015
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:26.940
<v Speaker 1>A strong fighter and the kid Hoodie,</v>

2016
00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:27.810
<v Speaker 1>look at that camera.</v>

2017
00:53:27.811 --> 00:53:28.830
<v Speaker 1>That's right baby.</v>

2018
00:53:28.831 --> 00:53:29.700
<v Speaker 1>You can hunt with it.</v>

2019
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:32.760
<v Speaker 1>You can disappear and fully ready to your spine on your ex.</v>

2020
00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

2021
00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:35.070
<v Speaker 1>You really don't want to hunt in cotton,</v>

2022
00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:35.913
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2023
00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:36.151
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2024
00:53:36.151 --> 00:53:36.984
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2025
00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:37.993
<v Speaker 1>It looks good.</v>

2026
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:40.830
<v Speaker 1>We're releasing the hunter additional pure wool.</v>

2027
00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Well you need to get in with first light and have them make a fighter and the</v>

2028
00:53:43.891 --> 00:53:44.830
<v Speaker 1>kid version.</v>

2029
00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Remember wearing wool like when we were wet and how you could be wet in Alaska</v>

2030
00:53:49.741 --> 00:53:50.521
<v Speaker 1>and it was called,</v>

2031
00:53:50.521 --> 00:53:51.241
<v Speaker 1>but you'd be in the morning,</v>

2032
00:53:51.241 --> 00:53:51.811
<v Speaker 1>you'd be cold,</v>

2033
00:53:51.811 --> 00:53:55.740
<v Speaker 1>but you'd put on wet wool and you kept you warm.</v>

2034
00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:55.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2035
00:53:55.951 --> 00:53:56.680
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2036
00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2037
00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Do I want to see Rina?</v>

2038
00:53:58.650 --> 00:53:59.483
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2039
00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:00.323
<v Speaker 1>That's the fight.</v>

2040
00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:03.720
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I want rose to have a year or two more.</v>

2041
00:54:03.721 --> 00:54:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2042
00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:05.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the way it works.</v>

2043
00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:07.360
<v Speaker 1>I know the problems.</v>

2044
00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:09.630
<v Speaker 1>She's beat Claudia twice now.</v>

2045
00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Carolino no,</v>

2046
00:54:11.671 --> 00:54:12.570
<v Speaker 1>she lost Carolina.</v>

2047
00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:14.250
<v Speaker 1>That's how Carol Lena got the fight.</v>

2048
00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Who did roasted,</v>

2049
00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:15.901
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2050
00:54:15.901 --> 00:54:16.830
<v Speaker 1>not saying Yolana.</v>

2051
00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2052
00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:17.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2053
00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:18.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2054
00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:19.650
<v Speaker 1>She'd be Claudia twice.</v>

2055
00:54:19.651 --> 00:54:20.820
<v Speaker 1>She beat Carolina.</v>

2056
00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:21.713
<v Speaker 1>Should beat just gone.</v>

2057
00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Jessica and trust Jesus Christ as Jessica and tries to have a fucking chin.</v>

2058
00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:29.540
<v Speaker 1>That chick is so tough and they were sending me there,</v>

2059
00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:30.403
<v Speaker 1>honey.</v>

2060
00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:33.390
<v Speaker 1>I'll take an shutout out.</v>

2061
00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:33.571
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2062
00:54:33.571 --> 00:54:34.800
<v Speaker 1>well she is a tank.</v>

2063
00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:35.111
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

2064
00:54:35.111 --> 00:54:38.460
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't see my auntie and her and rose Rose A.</v>

2065
00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:39.001
<v Speaker 1>Little more warm up,</v>

2066
00:54:39.001 --> 00:54:39.960
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the way it works.</v>

2067
00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.260
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing left for you on that.</v>

2068
00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I know that there really is nothing left for,</v>

2069
00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:46.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean after rose dismantled the karate hottie</v>

2070
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.760
<v Speaker 1>mantle that didn't think that was going to happen.</v>

2071
00:54:49.761 --> 00:54:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Paid kick to choke.</v>

2072
00:54:50.881 --> 00:54:51.714
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2073
00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Good Lord.</v>

2074
00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:53.521
<v Speaker 1>Good Lord.</v>

2075
00:54:53.521 --> 00:54:57.600
<v Speaker 1>I think rose has real legitimate world championship possibilities.</v>

2076
00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:58.051
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

2077
00:54:58.051 --> 00:54:58.770
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

2078
00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:00.030
<v Speaker 1>I would just like to see her.</v>

2079
00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:00.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2080
00:55:00.271 --> 00:55:00.691

00:55:00.691 --> 00:55:00.841
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2082
00:55:00.841 --> 00:55:01.471
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong.</v>

2083
00:55:01.471 --> 00:55:02.670
<v Speaker 1>She might go in there and get her.</v>

2084
00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:03.830
<v Speaker 1>She might get you on.</v>

2085
00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:06.990
<v Speaker 1>The thing about rose that you can't count out and she's dangerous.</v>

2086
00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:10.380
<v Speaker 1>She's more explosive and like more dynamic than any girl out there I think.</v>

2087
00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:12.173
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2088
00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:13.410
<v Speaker 1>She's so athletic.</v>

2089
00:55:13.411 --> 00:55:15.260
<v Speaker 1>You told me you freak athletic when,</v>

2090
00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:18.060
<v Speaker 1>cause we were training together at grudge and man freak freak.</v>

2091
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:20.450
<v Speaker 1>You ever see her do flying armbars yeah,</v>

2092
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:22.290
<v Speaker 1>she's had it been in fights.</v>

2093
00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:23.723
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2094
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2095
00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:26.010
<v Speaker 1>The girl can hit a flying arm bar in a fight.</v>

2096
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:29.340
<v Speaker 1>She has x factor that Yolanda hasn't seen yet,</v>

2097
00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:32.970
<v Speaker 1>but if that doesn't happen for golden is a scary,</v>

2098
00:55:32.971 --> 00:55:35.010
<v Speaker 1>scary woman striking.</v>

2099
00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Would you say it's the best and you'll see it as an just,</v>

2100
00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:39.000
<v Speaker 1>just flat out right?</v>

2101
00:55:39.001 --> 00:55:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Like tech technical.</v>

2102
00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2103
00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:43.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's definitely the best and women's MMA,</v>

2104
00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:48.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like she doesn't have the brutal knockout power that like cyborg</v>

2105
00:55:48.661 --> 00:55:49.350
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

2106
00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:53.100
<v Speaker 1>which she has is like excellent technique like over and over again.</v>

2107
00:55:53.101 --> 00:55:55.320
<v Speaker 1>She's using perfect technique and footwork,</v>

2108
00:55:55.650 --> 00:55:56.321
<v Speaker 1>but she,</v>

2109
00:55:56.321 --> 00:55:58.830
<v Speaker 1>she needs a volume of punches to get people out.</v>

2110
00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:00.240
<v Speaker 1>She's not a big person.</v>

2111
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:01.530
<v Speaker 1>Like she has small hands.</v>

2112
00:56:01.531 --> 00:56:02.390
<v Speaker 1>She has small feet,</v>

2113
00:56:02.391 --> 00:56:03.450
<v Speaker 1>just small bones.</v>

2114
00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:04.613
<v Speaker 1>She's not like,</v>

2115
00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.270
<v Speaker 1>like in the Jessica and drives fights.</v>

2116
00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Perfect example on drudge was so scary and every punchy throws us like she's</v>

2117
00:56:11.191 --> 00:56:11.491
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>

2118
00:56:11.491 --> 00:56:12.660
<v Speaker 1>these fucking bombs.</v>

2119
00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Whereas you want us just picking at it on that technique.</v>

2120
00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:17.230
<v Speaker 1>She's so much more technical,</v>

2121
00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:21.880
<v Speaker 1>more she wasn't stopping in any way on drugs is kind of constant assaulting</v>

2122
00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:22.650
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

2123
00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2124
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Literally 150 pound female fight.</v>

2125
00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:27.130
<v Speaker 1>You can fight differently too.</v>

2126
00:56:27.131 --> 00:56:27.371
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2127
00:56:27.371 --> 00:56:27.521
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2128
00:56:27.521 --> 00:56:29.230
<v Speaker 1>obviously you can be more technical,</v>

2129
00:56:29.231 --> 00:56:31.330
<v Speaker 1>whereas if you're fighting somebody technical,</v>

2130
00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:32.173
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2131
00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:33.251
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of technique,</v>

2132
00:56:33.251 --> 00:56:38.110
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying I feel like when you would pay very dearly for one shot from</v>

2133
00:56:38.111 --> 00:56:38.944
<v Speaker 1>somebody who's bigger,</v>

2134
00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:40.480
<v Speaker 1>you almost have to fight differently.</v>

2135
00:56:40.481 --> 00:56:40.900
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2136
00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:41.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2137
00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:41.830
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

2138
00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2139
00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:42.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2140
00:56:42.431 --> 00:56:42.911
<v Speaker 1>If you're fighting,</v>

2141
00:56:42.911 --> 00:56:44.590
<v Speaker 1>mighty mouse is more technical than,</v>

2142
00:56:44.591 --> 00:56:44.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2143
00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:45.190
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2144
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2145
00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Anybody really?</v>

2146
00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:47.470
<v Speaker 1>How about him?</v>

2147
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Tj Ain't happening.</v>

2148
00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:50.210
<v Speaker 1>It's that TJC.</v>

2149
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.561
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2150
00:56:50.561 --> 00:56:50.741
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2151
00:56:50.741 --> 00:56:51.574
<v Speaker 1>you've got to pay me.</v>

2152
00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:53.770
<v Speaker 1>And you know I love Tj.</v>

2153
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:55.900
<v Speaker 1>I know you probably listening for Dj,</v>

2154
00:56:55.901 --> 00:56:58.480
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make sense for mighty mouse mighty mouse.</v>

2155
00:56:58.481 --> 00:56:59.730
<v Speaker 1>It does not make any slots.</v>

2156
00:56:59.770 --> 00:57:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Why teachers don't even have the belt.</v>

2157
00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:02.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not as super fight.</v>

2158
00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:03.340
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't,</v>

2159
00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm super fights equal super money and when it,</v>

2160
00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:09.510
<v Speaker 1>when it's not a needle mover unfortunately as I would love to see the fights of</v>

2161
00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:10.360
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous fight.</v>

2162
00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.141
<v Speaker 1>So what is a,</v>

2163
00:57:11.141 --> 00:57:12.330
<v Speaker 1>has mighty mouse had no to it.</v>

2164
00:57:12.331 --> 00:57:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it straight up was like ain't happening.</v>

2165
00:57:14.350 --> 00:57:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2166
00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:15.660
<v Speaker 1>The UFC wants it happened.</v>

2167
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:15.851
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2168
00:57:15.851 --> 00:57:15.971
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2169
00:57:15.971 --> 00:57:16.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

2170
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:17.343
<v Speaker 1>It ain't happening.</v>

2171
00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Ray Boards,</v>

2172
00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:21.460
<v Speaker 1>the next contender isn't that interesting that that he can make those calls too.</v>

2173
00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:23.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's one of those weird things.</v>

2174
00:57:23.351 --> 00:57:24.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like in boxing,</v>

2175
00:57:24.491 --> 00:57:28.000
<v Speaker 1>you know you have mandatory challengers and then you know,</v>

2176
00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:31.420
<v Speaker 1>then you try to make super fights in the UFC.</v>

2177
00:57:31.421 --> 00:57:32.111
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're like,</v>

2178
00:57:32.111 --> 00:57:32.471
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2179
00:57:32.471 --> 00:57:33.550
<v Speaker 1>we've got to fight for you.</v>

2180
00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:34.060
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

2181
00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:34.480
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

2182
00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:35.313
<v Speaker 1>I'm the champ.</v>

2183
00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2184
00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:36.491
<v Speaker 1>but it's rare,</v>

2185
00:57:36.491 --> 00:57:36.791
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2186
00:57:36.791 --> 00:57:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Like if you only have one title defense,</v>

2187
00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:41.800
<v Speaker 1>you better get the fuck up then and played played with us.</v>

2188
00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:42.663
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2189
00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:47.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a cluster fuck because right now like you have to order like I'm all about</v>

2190
00:57:47.261 --> 00:57:47.771
<v Speaker 1>super fights.</v>

2191
00:57:47.771 --> 00:57:48.581
<v Speaker 1>We have to have order.</v>

2192
00:57:48.581 --> 00:57:49.414
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>

2193
00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:49.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2194
00:57:49.661 --> 00:57:51.250
<v Speaker 1>think about if Tj went down there,</v>

2195
00:57:51.251 --> 00:57:54.160
<v Speaker 1>then what happened with the Cody Garbrandt fight lemons with Dj.</v>

2196
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.911
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2197
00:57:54.911 --> 00:57:57.790
<v Speaker 1>But this Conor McGregor kind of phenomenon,</v>

2198
00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:58.780
<v Speaker 1>everyone's trying to do it.</v>

2199
00:57:58.930 --> 00:57:59.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2200
00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Well I think TJ just went through a huge camp and he wants a fight,</v>

2201
00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:04.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2202
00:58:04.781 --> 00:58:05.561
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

2203
00:58:05.561 --> 00:58:07.900
<v Speaker 1>he's gone through this giant camp getting ready for Cody.</v>

2204
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:08.743
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

2205
00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:09.610
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2206
00:58:09.610 --> 00:58:10.151
<v Speaker 1>Cody,</v>

2207
00:58:10.151 --> 00:58:11.570
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to pressure him to fight.</v>

2208
00:58:11.571 --> 00:58:11.980
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2209
00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:12.950
<v Speaker 1>they even sent him down.</v>

2210
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't why I sent him down to Germany,</v>

2211
00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Germany to get the same shit you can get in Santa Monica.</v>

2212
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:19.000
<v Speaker 1>How weird is that?</v>

2213
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:19.121
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2214
00:58:19.121 --> 00:58:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Dana doesn't believe that it's the same and I don't understand that.</v>

2215
00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:22.721
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2216
00:58:22.721 --> 00:58:23.201
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>

2217
00:58:23.201 --> 00:58:24.460
<v Speaker 1>what is wrong with Cody?</v>

2218
00:58:24.461 --> 00:58:25.300
<v Speaker 1>He's got [inaudible].</v>

2219
00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2220
00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:26.740
<v Speaker 1>he's got a back issue.</v>

2221
00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:31.270
<v Speaker 1>What is it do we know he's got something was disk and he needs time off.</v>

2222
00:58:31.271 --> 00:58:35.440
<v Speaker 1>He needs spinal decompression and he's got the Regeneca and he went and got a</v>

2223
00:58:35.441 --> 00:58:36.220
<v Speaker 1>full treatment.</v>

2224
00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:37.600
<v Speaker 1>They say it'd be ready by September.</v>

2225
00:58:37.601 --> 00:58:38.210
<v Speaker 1>October.</v>

2226
00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2227
00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:39.580
<v Speaker 1>Got a weight maybe.</v>

2228
00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:42.190
<v Speaker 1>But you have to absolutely make sure it heals.</v>

2229
00:58:42.191 --> 00:58:43.024
<v Speaker 1>First.</v>

2230
00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:44.440
<v Speaker 1>I sent him a bunch of information.</v>

2231
00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:45.071
<v Speaker 1>I sent him,</v>

2232
00:58:45.071 --> 00:58:45.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2233
00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:46.080
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2234
00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:46.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2235
00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:48.070
<v Speaker 1>reverse hyper machine,</v>

2236
00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:51.960
<v Speaker 1>send them some stuff on spinal decompression and uh,</v>

2237
00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:53.920
<v Speaker 1>he's also talking to Dr. Davidson,</v>

2238
00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:56.880
<v Speaker 1>who they're starting to do some stuff and yeah,</v>

2239
00:58:56.881 --> 00:58:57.160
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2240
00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:57.993
<v Speaker 1>he's brilliant.</v>

2241
00:58:58.150 --> 00:59:01.330
<v Speaker 1>They're starting to do some stuff now in the UFC where there,</v>

2242
00:59:01.331 --> 00:59:01.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2243
00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:06.960
<v Speaker 1>the stem cell doctors are now going to inject stem cells into discs and they're</v>

2244
00:59:07.271 --> 00:59:09.130
<v Speaker 1>going to regenerate disc tissue.</v>

2245
00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:09.910
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

2246
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:10.743
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

2247
00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:11.890
<v Speaker 1>This is the first time.</v>

2248
00:59:11.910 --> 00:59:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2249
00:59:12.310 --> 00:59:12.730
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2250
00:59:12.730 --> 00:59:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2251
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:14.103
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2252
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:15.160
<v Speaker 1>They've got shit.</v>

2253
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:19.060
<v Speaker 1>They've got studies that they've done enough of them now that they have some</v>

2254
00:59:19.061 --> 00:59:21.040
<v Speaker 1>real good evidence that it does regenerate.</v>

2255
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Same way it regenerates cartilage and ligaments and,</v>

2256
00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:25.280
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of times with the injuries where,</v>

2257
00:59:25.281 --> 00:59:25.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2258
00:59:25.521 --> 00:59:27.950
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that's not going to be enough.</v>

2259
00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:28.461
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

2260
00:59:28.461 --> 00:59:29.330
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the injury.</v>

2261
00:59:29.331 --> 00:59:30.500
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times those stem cells,</v>

2262
00:59:30.790 --> 00:59:35.390
<v Speaker 1>it's just sometimes you fuck a lot of that is that there hasn't been that much</v>

2263
00:59:35.391 --> 00:59:36.224
<v Speaker 1>conclusive evidence,</v>

2264
00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:36.681
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2265
00:59:36.681 --> 00:59:41.000
<v Speaker 1>that it grows and when you shoot it into something I've Koby Bryant would beg to</v>

2266
00:59:41.001 --> 00:59:44.880
<v Speaker 1>differ necessarily regenerate sometimes you know,</v>

2267
00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:45.351
<v Speaker 1>or a lot,</v>

2268
00:59:45.351 --> 00:59:46.420
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>

2269
00:59:46.421 --> 00:59:50.040
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to say why it works on some people and why it doesn't work</v>

2270
00:59:50.041 --> 00:59:50.571
<v Speaker 1>on other people.</v>

2271
00:59:50.571 --> 00:59:51.760
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's one of these,</v>

2272
00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:52.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2273
00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:52.610
<v Speaker 1>case by case.</v>

2274
00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:56.540
<v Speaker 1>But I think one factor is whether or not you come back too quick and that's what</v>

2275
00:59:56.690 --> 00:59:57.560
<v Speaker 1>would Cody did.</v>

2276
00:59:57.590 --> 01:00:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Cody got the stem cells and then started working out like four days later.</v>

2277
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I keep,</v>

2278
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:02.271
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>

2279
01:00:02.271 --> 01:00:03.020
<v Speaker 1>That's not smart.</v>

2280
01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:03.770
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

2281
01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:04.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2282
01:00:04.071 --> 01:00:04.761
<v Speaker 1>you know like look,</v>

2283
01:00:04.761 --> 01:00:05.510
<v Speaker 1>he's got a fight,</v>

2284
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:07.920
<v Speaker 1>he's got a big title fight and you,</v>

2285
01:00:07.921 --> 01:00:08.210
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2286
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:10.190
<v Speaker 1>I think actually it took two weeks off or something like that.</v>

2287
01:00:10.191 --> 01:00:12.350
<v Speaker 1>But you need like months and he had a lot of time off.</v>

2288
01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:13.850
<v Speaker 1>You need to have your body heal.</v>

2289
01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:18.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a very difficult area to heal and a lot of people don't do it correctly.</v>

2290
01:00:19.341 --> 01:00:23.570
<v Speaker 1>And then they wind up getting some serious atrophy where the nerves get pinched,</v>

2291
01:00:23.571 --> 01:00:26.870
<v Speaker 1>the swelling and all the inflammation and Cody needs to take it slow,</v>

2292
01:00:26.871 --> 01:00:29.210
<v Speaker 1>come back and in that TJ fly to be there.</v>

2293
01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:30.470
<v Speaker 1>But you can't rush that fight.</v>

2294
01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:31.521
<v Speaker 1>We'll look at Eddie.</v>

2295
01:00:31.521 --> 01:00:33.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean Eddie Bravo is a,</v>

2296
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:34.940
<v Speaker 1>he has a fake disc in his back down.</v>

2297
01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:35.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2298
01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:36.620
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say fake.</v>

2299
01:00:36.621 --> 01:00:38.120
<v Speaker 1>It's artificial.</v>

2300
01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:43.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a titanium articulating disc that he had put into his back because of this.</v>

2301
01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:44.450
<v Speaker 1>The same issue,</v>

2302
01:00:44.451 --> 01:00:45.920
<v Speaker 1>like disc degeneration,</v>

2303
01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:48.620
<v Speaker 1>having those injuries constantly training and rolling.</v>

2304
01:00:48.621 --> 01:00:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Never really letting it heal.</v>

2305
01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:51.980
<v Speaker 1>K or cane hitched surgery.</v>

2306
01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2307
01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:54.110
<v Speaker 1>On more than one occasion.</v>

2308
01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:54.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2309
01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:55.700
<v Speaker 1>on his desk.</v>

2310
01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:56.420
<v Speaker 1>He didn't do the,</v>

2311
01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:57.730
<v Speaker 1>and he's still not back.</v>

2312
01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:58.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean canes,</v>

2313
01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>there's no fight lined up for cane and Cain steep on.</v>

2314
01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that would be the device that would be the fight,</v>

2315
01:01:04.431 --> 01:01:07.130
<v Speaker 1>but I mean if your cane mean Jesus Christ,</v>

2316
01:01:07.131 --> 01:01:08.240
<v Speaker 1>he's been out for ever.</v>

2317
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.661
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

2318
01:01:08.661 --> 01:01:09.311
<v Speaker 1>A tough fight for him.</v>

2319
01:01:09.311 --> 01:01:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2320
01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.131
<v Speaker 1>a real,</v>

2321
01:01:10.131 --> 01:01:11.210
<v Speaker 1>just a fight to make though.</v>

2322
01:01:11.590 --> 01:01:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

2323
01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Steep pays just,</v>

2324
01:01:12.830 --> 01:01:14.210
<v Speaker 1>he's a monster right now.</v>

2325
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:15.590
<v Speaker 1>He's in Bruce Kane is,</v>

2326
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:16.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2327
01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's a like a healthy cake ready to go to.</v>

2328
01:01:19.171 --> 01:01:20.750
<v Speaker 1>It's the best fight in a long,</v>

2329
01:01:20.751 --> 01:01:21.680
<v Speaker 1>long time at heavyweight.</v>

2330
01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

2331
01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:23.181
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding me?</v>

2332
01:01:23.181 --> 01:01:24.310
<v Speaker 1>I was calling lesbian,</v>

2333
01:01:24.311 --> 01:01:24.700
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2334
01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:24.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2335
01:01:24.951 --> 01:01:28.280
<v Speaker 1>I would have loved to seen that fight in his prime canes,</v>

2336
01:01:28.281 --> 01:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>prime and steep Steve Bay right now.</v>

2337
01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Like people would go out.</v>

2338
01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:33.230
<v Speaker 1>It came over the hill,</v>

2339
01:01:33.350 --> 01:01:35.990
<v Speaker 1>came beat the brakes off Travis Browne.</v>

2340
01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:36.430
<v Speaker 1>He looked at him.</v>

2341
01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Travis is obviously no punk like he'd be,</v>

2342
01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:40.070
<v Speaker 1>he looked fucking great.</v>

2343
01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2344
01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:40.880
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2345
01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.230
<v Speaker 1>I just think the guy needs rest.</v>

2346
01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:44.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm really thinking a little bit more than that.</v>

2347
01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.330
<v Speaker 1>He's got a cumulative injuries for sure,</v>

2348
01:01:47.331 --> 01:01:49.220
<v Speaker 1>but those were because he's rushing.</v>

2349
01:01:49.221 --> 01:01:50.330
<v Speaker 1>They can't rush in the camp,</v>

2350
01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.640
<v Speaker 1>so maybe if he takes all this time off,</v>

2351
01:01:52.641 --> 01:01:53.930
<v Speaker 1>they fight at the end of the year.</v>

2352
01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>We get a prime cane versus a prime Steve Bay sign me the fuck up.</v>

2353
01:01:57.820 --> 01:01:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Just came that Mary,</v>

2354
01:01:58.880 --> 01:01:59.450
<v Speaker 1>how old is he?</v>

2355
01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:00.470
<v Speaker 1>He's still fairly young.</v>

2356
01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:02.930
<v Speaker 1>I think he's 32 he's not that old.</v>

2357
01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2358
01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:03.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2359
01:02:03.601 --> 01:02:04.011
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

2360
01:02:04.011 --> 01:02:07.490
<v Speaker 1>he puts his body through the ringer and his fighting style is a grinding style</v>

2361
01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:10.590
<v Speaker 1>that's going to catch up where you were showing that video of him doing a kettle</v>

2362
01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:13.790
<v Speaker 1>bells with those really heavy weight that he was probably training a little bit.</v>

2363
01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:14.600
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2364
01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:17.660
<v Speaker 1>he fucked up and he had a bad strength and conditioning coach for sure.</v>

2365
01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.010
<v Speaker 1>And he's got,</v>

2366
01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:24.050
<v Speaker 1>that guy got criticized hard core by people that are like really in the know</v>

2367
01:02:24.421 --> 01:02:28.220
<v Speaker 1>about technique and back rounded or Kettlebell swings.</v>

2368
01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:30.300
<v Speaker 1>It was more of like a like a,</v>

2369
01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>it was like almost like a shrug.</v>

2370
01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.050
<v Speaker 1>If I got 200 pounds,</v>

2371
01:02:33.130 --> 01:02:33.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm crazy.</v>

2372
01:02:33.610 --> 01:02:34.500
<v Speaker 1>And chocolate balls,</v>

2373
01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:34.880
<v Speaker 1>injuries,</v>

2374
01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:35.550
<v Speaker 1>tub.</v>

2375
01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:35.731
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2376
01:02:35.731 --> 01:02:36.990
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely not helping.</v>

2377
01:02:36.991 --> 01:02:37.161
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2378
01:02:37.161 --> 01:02:37.800
<v Speaker 1>it's not helping.</v>

2379
01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:38.633
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of fun.</v>

2380
01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:39.600
<v Speaker 1>As he corrected that.</v>

2381
01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:40.473
<v Speaker 1>Does he have a better,</v>

2382
01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:41.693
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

2383
01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:41.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2384
01:02:41.971 --> 01:02:43.020
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to talk to Kane,</v>

2385
01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>but all all bullshit aside.</v>

2386
01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:45.751
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2387
01:02:45.751 --> 01:02:46.620
<v Speaker 1>in my eyes,</v>

2388
01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:49.530
<v Speaker 1>he's one of two of the greatest heavyweights of all time.</v>

2389
01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:50.571
<v Speaker 1>He got fade or,</v>

2390
01:02:50.571 --> 01:02:51.840
<v Speaker 1>and you got cane for me,</v>

2391
01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:52.693
<v Speaker 1>he's one of two.</v>

2392
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2393
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:54.810
<v Speaker 1>but also it's steep.</v>

2394
01:02:54.811 --> 01:02:55.990
<v Speaker 1>A fade or cane.</v>

2395
01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Steve Bay's resume.</v>

2396
01:02:57.490 --> 01:02:59.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's top three of all time.</v>

2397
01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2398
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Well were doing was right up there until Steve Bay knocked him out.</v>

2399
01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:08.780
<v Speaker 1>No for doom submitted fade or he submitted Minataro and he submitted cane.</v>

2400
01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:14.100
<v Speaker 1>He submitted three of the top five and looked it looked great against Travis</v>

2401
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Browne.</v>

2402
01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2403
01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:14.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2404
01:03:14.571 --> 01:03:15.404
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2405
01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>twice three of the top five heavyweights of all time.</v>

2406
01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2407
01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:23.130
<v Speaker 1>p s flight card in July got over him for doom rematch.</v>

2408
01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.080
<v Speaker 1>That first one was strike Strikeforce or that one.</v>

2409
01:03:25.790 --> 01:03:26.840
<v Speaker 1>The third one's trilogies.</v>

2410
01:03:26.850 --> 01:03:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2411
01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:28.200
<v Speaker 1>That's one strike Strikeforce.</v>

2412
01:03:28.201 --> 01:03:33.201
<v Speaker 1>I watched the other night a soap or a terrible fight or Jim's sitting there</v>

2413
01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:36.240
<v Speaker 1>fucked his knee up real early in the fight.</v>

2414
01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Real early.</v>

2415
01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:38.093
<v Speaker 1>Terrible fight though.</v>

2416
01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:38.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2417
01:03:38.671 --> 01:03:40.050
<v Speaker 1>What a what a crazy.</v>

2418
01:03:40.110 --> 01:03:40.801
<v Speaker 1>A rematch.</v>

2419
01:03:40.801 --> 01:03:41.181
<v Speaker 1>So that's kid.</v>

2420
01:03:41.181 --> 01:03:43.200
<v Speaker 1>It'd be a fun one in it and over.</v>

2421
01:03:43.201 --> 01:03:45.630
<v Speaker 1>It has been knocked out so many times in his career.</v>

2422
01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude.</v>

2423
01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:47.250
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like,</v>

2424
01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.001
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2425
01:03:48.001 --> 01:03:49.950
<v Speaker 1>it just gets to a point where you're just like,</v>

2426
01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:50.640
<v Speaker 1>to what,</v>

2427
01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:54.450
<v Speaker 1>when are you going to realize that you're taking serious punishment?</v>

2428
01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.190
<v Speaker 1>I think Dutch people are different.</v>

2429
01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:58.140
<v Speaker 1>I think they could just keep getting knocked out.</v>

2430
01:03:58.290 --> 01:03:59.220
<v Speaker 1>I feel like he's all right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Not In anymore.</v>

2442
01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:18.760
<v Speaker 1>There's one fight away.</v>

2443
01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:19.950
<v Speaker 1>He just fought for a title.</v>

2444
01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:21.900
<v Speaker 1>He went on a win street.</v>

2445
01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:22.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

2446
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:23.543
<v Speaker 1>Oh Bullshit.</v>

2447
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:24.583
<v Speaker 1>I really don't.</v>

2448
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:26.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't find it that exciting.</v>

2449
01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:27.780
<v Speaker 1>If it's a worldclass tracker,</v>

2450
01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:30.570
<v Speaker 1>I dub dub dub would light a lot of guys out,</v>

2451
01:04:30.571 --> 01:04:31.404
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing,</v>

2452
01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.830
<v Speaker 1>the best heavyweight striker of all time over him.</v>

2453
01:04:34.831 --> 01:04:36.360
<v Speaker 1>You won't want to watch him fight,</v>

2454
01:04:36.930 --> 01:04:38.460
<v Speaker 1>but that title,</v>

2455
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:40.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2456
01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:40.171
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2457
01:04:40.171 --> 01:04:43.500
<v Speaker 1>he just went for a title and knocked I STP on is,</v>

2458
01:04:43.501 --> 01:04:44.400
<v Speaker 1>as I understand,</v>

2459
01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:45.330
<v Speaker 1>he fought for a title.</v>

2460
01:04:45.770 --> 01:04:47.150
<v Speaker 1>He's the best striker in the UFC.</v>

2461
01:04:47.151 --> 01:04:47.761
<v Speaker 1>I understand,</v>

2462
01:04:47.761 --> 01:04:51.030
<v Speaker 1>but if you could pull up how many times have been knocked out in the past two</v>

2463
01:04:51.031 --> 01:04:51.780
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>

2464
01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:52.830
<v Speaker 1>It's done a bunch.</v>

2465
01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:53.681
<v Speaker 1>It's tough to watch.</v>

2466
01:04:53.681 --> 01:04:54.241
<v Speaker 1>It's two years.</v>

2467
01:04:54.241 --> 01:04:54.810
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:56.010
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot the past two years,</v>

2469
01:04:56.011 --> 01:04:56.350

01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:58.231
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2473

<v Speaker 1>you've got to remember 10 excited.</v>

2474
01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:00.050
<v Speaker 1>He fought it.</v>

2475
01:05:00.050 --> 01:05:00.883
<v Speaker 1>The bullshit.</v>

2476
01:05:01.210 --> 01:05:02.350
<v Speaker 1>You're buying time now.</v>

2477
01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:05.340
<v Speaker 1>He fucking fun at the highest level in the world and striking.</v>

2478
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:07.950
<v Speaker 1>So he's going to have more knockouts then of her doom.</v>

2479
01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:08.520
<v Speaker 1>Then um,</v>

2480
01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:12.330
<v Speaker 1>then all these other guys come to the territory but not so much anymore.</v>

2481
01:05:12.331 --> 01:05:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2482
01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:13.900
<v Speaker 1>That's all I'm saying.</v>

2483
01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:16.050
<v Speaker 1>I say these two names just don't want to see him get knocked out.</v>

2484
01:05:16.051 --> 01:05:16.290

2487
01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Try doing a spelling bee for those little bitches on tap for this fight card.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's a beast.</v>

2489

<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

2498
01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:42.250
<v Speaker 1>I looked at,</v>

2499
01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:43.790
<v Speaker 1>I looked at our Laski shoulders on it.</v>

2500
01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:44.663
<v Speaker 1>There's hair on the shoulders.</v>

2507
01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:53.590
<v Speaker 1>That's coming out of his ears.</v>

2508
01:05:53.591 --> 01:05:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Like although shaving brush</v>

2509
01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.990
<v Speaker 1>connected as mustaches.</v>

2510
01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh God damn it.</v>

2511
01:06:00.330 --> 01:06:02.920
<v Speaker 1>And then look at that beard for God's sakes.</v>

2512
01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:03.640
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2513
01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:04.473
<v Speaker 1>he's</v>

2514
01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:06.333
<v Speaker 1>straight up.</v>

2515
01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:06.730
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2516
01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:09.490
<v Speaker 1>he's one of those wind up before you throw a punch.</v>

2517
01:06:09.491 --> 01:06:10.121
<v Speaker 1>Guy's like,</v>

2518
01:06:10.121 --> 01:06:11.230
<v Speaker 1>he's like digging in.</v>

2519
01:06:11.231 --> 01:06:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Some would say stiff.</v>

2520
01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:13.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2521
01:06:13.790 --> 01:06:14.623
<v Speaker 1>real stiff.</v>

2522
01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:16.690
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a stiffness.</v>

2523
01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:18.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean like a lot of these guys,</v>

2524
01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.440
<v Speaker 1>they could be like more fluid,</v>

2525
01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.750
<v Speaker 1>but they're trying to knock you out with every shot.</v>

2526
01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.090
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like a curse to power.</v>

2527
01:06:25.810 --> 01:06:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Like it's absolutely beneficial.</v>

2528
01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.250
<v Speaker 1>There's also a curse to it.</v>

2529
01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2530
01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:33.370
<v Speaker 1>you can come down so much.</v>

2531
01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:37.030
<v Speaker 1>It slows you down so much when you're trying to use it that much.</v>

2532
01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.540
<v Speaker 1>But the greatness comes to the guys know when to use it.</v>

2533
01:06:40.541 --> 01:06:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Right timing.</v>

2534
01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:42.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2535
01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:42.611
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2536
01:06:42.611 --> 01:06:47.611
<v Speaker 1>one of the most beautiful things that you see in Connor style is how he has none</v>

2537
01:06:48.251 --> 01:06:49.084
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

2538
01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Like when he's throwing punches,</v>

2539
01:06:51.130 --> 01:06:53.280
<v Speaker 1>unless he's got you fucked up and stunned,</v>

2540
01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:54.050
<v Speaker 1>then you're fucked.</v>

2541
01:06:54.050 --> 01:06:57.370

<v Speaker 1>Mcgregor,</v>

2585
01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:51.011
<v Speaker 1>Floyd Mayweather,</v>

2586
01:07:51.011 --> 01:07:51.581
<v Speaker 1>the thing is,</v>

2587
01:07:51.581 --> 01:07:56.581
<v Speaker 1>is all a hoax and just a way to get Connor to have people talking about him</v>

2588
01:07:56.591 --> 01:07:57.640
<v Speaker 1>until he has his next fight.</v>

2589
01:07:58.060 --> 01:07:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Like do you think that's just a big,</v>

2590
01:07:59.291 --> 01:08:00.450
<v Speaker 1>huge thing to say?</v>

2591
01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:02.320
<v Speaker 1>It's marketing ploy.</v>

2592
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:03.940
<v Speaker 1>I think the world's flat too.</v>

2593
01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:05.973
<v Speaker 1>You think it's real?</v>

2594
01:08:06.370 --> 01:08:08.140
<v Speaker 1>I think me and Joe Bolte don't want to talk about,</v>

2595
01:08:08.141 --> 01:08:10.210
<v Speaker 1>I think we're both at red in the face time that no,</v>

2596
01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:10.800
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2597
01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:10.930
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2598
01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:11.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2599
01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:12.280
<v Speaker 1>do you think he's like an album box?</v>

2600
01:08:12.281 --> 01:08:13.060
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen.</v>

2601
01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:15.950
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be what's it's gonna happen.</v>

2602
01:08:15.951 --> 01:08:16.491
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna happen.</v>

2603
01:08:16.491 --> 01:08:17.570
<v Speaker 1>It's so close.</v>

2604
01:08:17.650 --> 01:08:17.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2605
01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you this.</v>

2606
01:08:19.890 --> 01:08:20.723
<v Speaker 1>Why I don't talk to him.</v>

2607
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:24.423
<v Speaker 1>You got one.</v>

2608
01:08:26.150 --> 01:08:29.540
<v Speaker 1>There is a current birthing contract to a new podcast called the fighter and the</v>

2609
01:08:29.541 --> 01:08:30.374
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2610
01:08:32.750 --> 01:08:33.540
<v Speaker 1>listen to me.</v>

2611
01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:38.390
<v Speaker 1>She's too confusing tracked who was in the UFC and Connor Verde come to an</v>

2612
01:08:38.391 --> 01:08:43.130
<v Speaker 1>agreement and we can update them because right now they're in negotiation with</v>

2613
01:08:43.131 --> 01:08:44.600
<v Speaker 1>the Floyd Mayweather team.</v>

2614
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:47.810
<v Speaker 1>So Floyd me where the team is going to want an exorbitant amount of money.</v>

2615
01:08:47.811 --> 01:08:48.680
<v Speaker 1>They're very patient.</v>

2616
01:08:48.681 --> 01:08:50.390
<v Speaker 1>They going to take a long time to drive us out.</v>

2617
01:08:50.391 --> 01:08:50.660
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2618
01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:52.010
<v Speaker 1>So they can get the best deal.</v>

2619
01:08:52.190 --> 01:08:56.180
<v Speaker 1>But essentially the UFC and Connor have come to some sort of promotional</v>

2620
01:08:56.181 --> 01:09:00.230
<v Speaker 1>agreement and now they have to figure out how much money Floyd gets and whether</v>

2621
01:09:00.231 --> 01:09:05.120
<v Speaker 1>or not they want to gamble on giving him a flat rate of like a hundred million</v>

2622
01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:05.121
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>

2623
01:09:05.121 --> 01:09:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck he wants.</v>

2624
01:09:05.991 --> 01:09:08.390
<v Speaker 1>That's a big whether that's a big like if,</v>

2625
01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:08.751
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2626
01:09:08.751 --> 01:09:10.670
<v Speaker 1>but he's also going to want a piece of the pie.</v>

2627
01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:11.150
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

2628
01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:12.980
<v Speaker 1>They'll be not close to a contract yet.</v>

2629
01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.300
<v Speaker 1>They're not close,</v>

2630
01:09:14.301 --> 01:09:17.630
<v Speaker 1>but they're 90% that's what I'm saying is that I feel like,</v>

2631
01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:18.000
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2632
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:18.830
<v Speaker 1>so what happens?</v>

2633
01:09:18.830 --> 01:09:21.560
<v Speaker 1>They don't pretend that you have any knowledge of this.</v>

2634
01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Just do everybody a favor.</v>

2635
01:09:24.230 --> 01:09:24.951
<v Speaker 1>I'm yourself.</v>

2636
01:09:24.951 --> 01:09:25.970
<v Speaker 1>That's my theory.</v>

2637
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Do yourself a favor and don't let your mouth get ahead of life theory that I</v>

2638
01:09:30.561 --> 01:09:34.130
<v Speaker 1>believe this is a very smart way of keeping him in align lightheaded.</v>

2639
01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:34.971
<v Speaker 1>That's by the way,</v>

2640
01:09:34.971 --> 01:09:35.804
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you this.</v>

2641
01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:36.560
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

2642
01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:37.011
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2643
01:09:37.011 --> 01:09:37.844
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2644
01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:39.050
<v Speaker 1>Tony Ferguson,</v>

2645
01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:44.320
<v Speaker 1>and let's just say tiny furniture sending could be fight before that and now,</v>

2646
01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:47.990
<v Speaker 1>now somebody is waiting to fight.</v>

2647
01:09:47.991 --> 01:09:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Conor,</v>

2648
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:51.860
<v Speaker 1>will Conor fight those guys before he fights Floyd?</v>

2649
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:52.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2650
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:53.151
<v Speaker 1>definitely not.</v>

2651
01:09:53.151 --> 01:09:54.430
<v Speaker 1>So then what happens to the money?</v>

2652
01:09:54.510 --> 01:09:58.300
<v Speaker 1>The money right now is in Floyd versus Connor for Connor.</v>

2653
01:09:58.330 --> 01:10:00.710
<v Speaker 1>And it's just exorbitant money.</v>

2654
01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Like he might make,</v>

2655
01:10:01.761 --> 01:10:03.950
<v Speaker 1>who knows how many fucking millions of dollars,</v>

2656
01:10:03.951 --> 01:10:04.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe a hundred.</v>

2657
01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2658
01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:07.760
<v Speaker 1>So that's where the real money is for Floyd.</v>

2659
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:08.041
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2660
01:10:08.041 --> 01:10:09.770
<v Speaker 1>And this is where the real money is for Connor.</v>

2661
01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:14.980
<v Speaker 1>So for Connor to jeopardize that by fighting that fucking Russian savage or Tony</v>

2662
01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Ferguson who also could beat him,</v>

2663
01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:17.211
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2664
01:10:17.211 --> 01:10:18.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying he's going to,</v>

2665
01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:23.800
<v Speaker 1>but it the off Tony Ferguson is a motherfucking world champion caliber fighter.</v>

2666
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:25.700
<v Speaker 1>So is Habib.</v>

2667
01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:28.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking killer fight.</v>

2668
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:29.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2669
01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.910
<v Speaker 1>but we don't even know if Khabib can even make one 55 anymore,</v>

2670
01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:32.753
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2671
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:35.900
<v Speaker 1>He says he can influence by in October.</v>

2672
01:10:35.901 --> 01:10:36.081
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2673
01:10:36.081 --> 01:10:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Of course there was,</v>

2674
01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:37.460
<v Speaker 1>he says he can,</v>

2675
01:10:37.461 --> 01:10:38.390
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't make it.</v>

2676
01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:41.510
<v Speaker 1>Not only did he not make it this fucking liver shutting down and he had to go to</v>

2677
01:10:41.511 --> 01:10:42.380
<v Speaker 1>the Goddamn hospital.</v>

2678
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:43.071
<v Speaker 1>Did you die?</v>

2679
01:10:43.071 --> 01:10:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Can we was like,</v>

01:10:43.670 --> 01:10:43.821
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2681
01:10:43.821 --> 01:10:44.690
<v Speaker 1>but did you die?</v>

2682
01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Almost,</v>

2683
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:46.220
<v Speaker 1>but did you die?</v>

2684
01:10:46.221 --> 01:10:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Did you tie it?</v>

2685
01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2686
01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:51.020
<v Speaker 1>get up and make 55 so I can fucking eat my popcorn.</v>

2687
01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:52.250
<v Speaker 1>And you fight Tony Ferguson.</v>

2688
01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:53.803
<v Speaker 1>Did you die?</v>

2689
01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Did not get the fuck up there and make the weight for my entertainment.</v>

2727
01:11:46.021 --> 01:11:46.451
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

2728
01:11:46.451 --> 01:11:50.970
<v Speaker 1>do you think there's a Korean or Chinese dude with just a fucking egg roll for a</v>

2729
01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:51.380
<v Speaker 1>cock?</v>

2731
01:11:53.250 --> 01:11:53.940
<v Speaker 1>First of all.</v>

2732
01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Now there's gotta be some fucking genetic engineering to doing over there.</v>

2733
01:11:57.390 --> 01:11:58.950
<v Speaker 1>They're doing that CRISPR thing.</v>

2734
01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:00.110
<v Speaker 1>You know that genetic,</v>

2735
01:12:00.130 --> 01:12:00.963
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2736
01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:04.530
<v Speaker 1>taking embryos and changing their genes,</v>

2737
01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.720
<v Speaker 1>they're definitely worth on that big dick gene.</v>

2738
01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:09.810
<v Speaker 1>They say there are seven years away from the trials where you can have different</v>

2739
01:12:09.811 --> 01:12:10.260
<v Speaker 1>hair.</v>

2740
01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:10.950
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait.</v>

2741
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:13.380
<v Speaker 1>What if you have like big Dick Gene?</v>

2742
01:12:13.381 --> 01:12:15.330

2743
01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2744
01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:19.800
<v Speaker 1>the only way you could get big tick is you gotta have fun pictures.</v>

2745
01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:22.473
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2746
01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:22.980
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:23.080
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2748
01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:23.221
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2749
01:12:23.221 --> 01:12:25.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like fucking double like double her feet.</v>

2750

<v Speaker 1>No feet.</v>

2751
01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:29.550
<v Speaker 1>You're doing no sports.</v>

2752
01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather have that baby.</v>

2753
01:12:30.690 --> 01:12:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Don't swim like a motherfucker.</v>

2754
01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:32.301
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2755
01:12:32.301 --> 01:12:33.134
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

2756
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:37.410
<v Speaker 1>You can have your cutting and Maren mountain climbing would be off the charts.</v>

2757
01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:38.621
<v Speaker 1>That dorsal fin,</v>

2758
01:12:38.621 --> 01:12:39.421
<v Speaker 1>the Fra Cock.</v>

2759
01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:40.860
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to help you through the water.</v>

2760
01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:41.710
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

2761
01:12:41.710 --> 01:12:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Think that fucker ride your like flotation device.</v>

2762
01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Have you were on some Viagara could actually be a float device.</v>

2763
01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Agnes bodies.</v>

2764
01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:53.190
<v Speaker 1>You can make your Dick Bigger.</v>

2765
01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:55.250
<v Speaker 1>There's an operation that no,</v>

2766
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:57.050
<v Speaker 1>only by an inch be right.</v>

2767
01:12:57.051 --> 01:12:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Can you cut that cord or something?</v>

2768
01:12:59.251 --> 01:13:00.170
<v Speaker 1>You cut the tenant,</v>

2769
01:13:00.171 --> 01:13:00.871
<v Speaker 1>but there's also,</v>

2770
01:13:00.871 --> 01:13:02.460
<v Speaker 1>I think you can make it thicker too.</v>

2771
01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:03.600
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole process.</v>

2772
01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:05.100
<v Speaker 1>They pump it up with fat,</v>

2773
01:13:05.101 --> 01:13:09.690
<v Speaker 1>but what's going to happen is you're going to have a floppy fat that sounds all</v>

2774
01:13:09.691 --> 01:13:11.820
<v Speaker 1>four or this fat deposits the wrong way.</v>

2775
01:13:11.821 --> 01:13:13.890
<v Speaker 1>So you've got a big old door knob for a happy,</v>

2776
01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:17.230
<v Speaker 1>it all seeps down to the bottom and take.</v>

2777
01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Looks like it's got to have fucking belly man's penis and transplant operation.</v>

2778
01:13:22.781 --> 01:13:23.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a lie.</v>

2779
01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:23.820
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2780
01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:23.941
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2781
01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:24.500
<v Speaker 1>it's not allowed.</v>

2782
01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:28.200
<v Speaker 1>They have done penis transplants now because there's three of them.</v>

2783
01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:31.320
<v Speaker 1>I thought that last one in a circumcision</v>

2784
01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:37.560
<v Speaker 1>circumcision apparently that the real issue with these transplants is Africa</v>

2785
01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:40.620
<v Speaker 1>because African traditional circumcisions or ruthless.</v>

01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:55.940
<v Speaker 1>I just can't put on weight because I don't try hard enough and I don't care.</v>

3112
01:21:03.810 --> 01:21:04.290
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you want to sparring.</v>

3118
01:21:10.351 --> 01:21:12.210
<v Speaker 2>And it's like that's the culture there.</v>

3119
01:21:12.250 --> 01:21:12.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3120
01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:13.441
<v Speaker 2>That's tough.</v>

3121
01:21:13.441 --> 01:21:14.370
<v Speaker 2>When you just want to work out.</v>

3122
01:21:14.371 --> 01:21:14.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3123
01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:15.600
<v Speaker 2>and he doesn't want to say no,</v>

3124
01:21:15.601 --> 01:21:16.950
<v Speaker 2>and I told you this before Brian,</v>

3125
01:21:16.951 --> 01:21:17.491
<v Speaker 2>because Brian was like,</v>

3126
01:21:17.491 --> 01:21:18.470
<v Speaker 2>I just want to get put out of spoiler.</v>

3127
01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:18.870
<v Speaker 2>He went,</v>

3128

<v Speaker 2>I want you to walk into wildcard west and he'd get all the spike in handle.</v>

3129
01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:24.270
<v Speaker 2>Myra Lopez will punch you in the Dick.</v>

3130
01:21:24.271 --> 01:21:26.430
<v Speaker 2>So we'll punch you.</v>

3131
01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:29.930
<v Speaker 2>The Sopa Barn is Mario dues.</v>

3132
01:21:29.950 --> 01:21:30.210
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

3133
01:21:30.210 --> 01:21:31.940
<v Speaker 2>he's budge.</v>

3134
01:21:32.050 --> 01:21:33.420
<v Speaker 2>But do I worry about that?</v>

3135
01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:37.680
<v Speaker 2>I worry about those guys that do that recreational sparring and then all of a</v>

3136
01:21:37.681 --> 01:21:39.240
<v Speaker 2>sudden one day like where are my keys?</v>

3137
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:41.000
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense in my hand can hit.</v>

3138
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:42.450
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense to me.</v>

3139
01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:43.613
<v Speaker 2>Why are you doing?</v>

3140
01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:44.291
<v Speaker 2>Are you getting paid?</v>

3141
01:21:44.291 --> 01:21:44.941
<v Speaker 2>He in the head.</v>

3142
01:21:44.941 --> 01:21:45.774
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>

3143
01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:47.310
<v Speaker 2>I talked to him about it when,</v>

3144
01:21:47.311 --> 01:21:47.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3145
01:21:47.730 --> 01:21:51.450
<v Speaker 2>he fought one of our friends from a 10th planet Jujitsu.</v>

3146
01:21:51.570 --> 01:21:53.670
<v Speaker 2>He's been boxing for a long time too.</v>

3147
01:21:53.671 --> 01:21:55.440
<v Speaker 2>I think it has been like,</v>

3148
01:21:55.441 --> 01:21:59.040
<v Speaker 2>legitimately he had an amateur boxing match with a buddy of mine.</v>

3149
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:01.030
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

3150
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.863
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

3151
01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:02.360
<v Speaker 2>I get,</v>

3152
01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:02.911
<v Speaker 2>it's fun.</v>

3153
01:22:02.911 --> 01:22:04.920
<v Speaker 2>You've got to test yourself and maybe you know you're in TV,</v>

3154
01:22:04.921 --> 01:22:06.600
<v Speaker 2>so you've got to make sure you still have your main card,</v>

3155
01:22:06.601 --> 01:22:07.291
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

3156
01:22:07.291 --> 01:22:09.030
<v Speaker 2>But there's other ways to do it.</v>

3157
01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:09.620
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

3158
01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:11.580
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu is the best way to do it because you don't,</v>

3159
01:22:11.610 --> 01:22:12.180
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

3160
01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:13.410
<v Speaker 2>you don't get the brain damage,</v>

3161
01:22:13.411 --> 01:22:16.530
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of guys don't like the damage to your neck and your knees and your</v>

3162
01:22:16.531 --> 01:22:18.120
<v Speaker 2>joints and your back.</v>

3163
01:22:18.510 --> 01:22:19.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3164
01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:19.280
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

3165
01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.790
<v Speaker 2>that's a personality thing too.</v>

3166
01:22:20.791 --> 01:22:23.640
<v Speaker 2>I think Stryker's a lot of times have different personalities.</v>

3167
01:22:23.641 --> 01:22:24.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about guys who do it.</v>

3168
01:22:25.230 --> 01:22:26.850
<v Speaker 2>Like the difference between a striker,</v>

3169
01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:28.680
<v Speaker 2>pure striker and a pure wrestler.</v>

3170
01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.330
<v Speaker 2>There's actually a personality difference.</v>

3171
01:22:30.331 --> 01:22:32.850
<v Speaker 2>I think sometimes maybe it's also like,</v>

3172
01:22:32.970 --> 01:22:33.241
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3173
01:22:33.241 --> 01:22:37.920
<v Speaker 2>a lot of guys who could have been big time or would have really gotten big time</v>

3174
01:22:37.921 --> 01:22:38.754
<v Speaker 2>into striking.</v>

3175
01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:41.520
<v Speaker 2>They found Jujitsu first and they've got big time into Jujitsu.</v>

3176
01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:43.620
<v Speaker 2>It depends with that look,</v>

3177
01:22:43.621 --> 01:22:46.890
<v Speaker 2>I loved both of them and I love striking and I loved it all.</v>

3178
01:22:47.130 --> 01:22:48.090
<v Speaker 2>I loved Jujitsu.</v>

3179
01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:49.261
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3180
01:22:49.261 --> 01:22:54.261
<v Speaker 2>I think that the difference in striking clearly is that you can get hit and hurt</v>

3181
01:22:54.850 --> 01:22:57.080
<v Speaker 2>and you get hit a little bit in Jujitsu,</v>

3182
01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:59.770
<v Speaker 2>QED but each other and run into the shit.</v>

3183
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.921
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I would've done?</v>

3184
01:23:01.921 --> 01:23:03.450
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not being funny here.</v>

3185
01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:06.000
<v Speaker 2>If you put me in a time and I was like</v>

3186
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:10.700
<v Speaker 1>say 1814 I'm not kidding with trade and last thing.</v>

3187
01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding?</v>

3188
01:23:11.530 --> 01:23:11.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3189
01:23:11.771 --> 01:23:12.750
<v Speaker 1>I tried it and run slang,</v>

3190
01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:13.421
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo,</v>

3191
01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:13.951
<v Speaker 1>all this up.</v>

3192
01:23:13.951 --> 01:23:14.591
<v Speaker 1>I would be,</v>

3193
01:23:14.591 --> 01:23:15.970
<v Speaker 1>I would be practicing an instrument.</v>

3194
01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:18.130
<v Speaker 1>I would be a great dancer and I would sing,</v>

3195
01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.740
<v Speaker 1>just want to get distracted by pussy and he would start doing stand up.</v>

3196
01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:26.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you would do that.</v>

3197
01:23:26.561 --> 01:23:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Be Maybe I had to be a fighter.</v>

3198
01:23:28.451 --> 01:23:29.284
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3199
01:23:29.650 --> 01:23:30.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3200
01:23:30.190 --> 01:23:31.870
<v Speaker 1>cause I I knowing what I know now,</v>

3201
01:23:31.871 --> 01:23:32.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't have that now.</v>

3202
01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Dancing w you fucked up by not singing and dancing.</v>

3203
01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.233
<v Speaker 1>Look at me.</v>

3204
01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:39.920
<v Speaker 1>I would have been great dancing,</v>

3205
01:23:40.690 --> 01:23:41.523
<v Speaker 1>dancing,</v>

3206
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:42.191
<v Speaker 1>singing.</v>

3207
01:23:42.191 --> 01:23:43.330
<v Speaker 1>I was singing it.</v>

3208
01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Something you can work at,</v>

3209
01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:45.880
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not talking about being it's white singer.</v>

3210
01:23:46.330 --> 01:23:47.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about being,</v>

3211
01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:47.953
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3212
01:23:47.970 --> 01:23:48.730
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong,</v>

3213
01:23:48.730 --> 01:23:49.061
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>

3214
01:23:49.061 --> 01:23:49.751
<v Speaker 1>You're completely wrong.</v>

3215
01:23:49.751 --> 01:23:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3216
01:23:50.050 --> 01:23:51.340
<v Speaker 1>some people have amazing instruments,</v>

3217
01:23:51.341 --> 01:23:53.710
<v Speaker 1>but you can become a very good singer just with training.</v>

3218
01:23:53.730 --> 01:23:54.221
<v Speaker 1>But believe me,</v>

3219
01:23:54.221 --> 01:23:54.720
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

3220
01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:59.230
<v Speaker 1>especially if you could translate into being good singer has to be a dick.</v>

3221
01:23:59.231 --> 01:24:00.064
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

3222
01:24:00.210 --> 01:24:02.860
<v Speaker 1>I did sing it when in theater school.</v>

3223
01:24:03.130 --> 01:24:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Like I got to a point where I could,</v>

3224
01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:05.800
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't hurt your ears.</v>

3225
01:24:05.801 --> 01:24:06.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not song.</v>

01:24:06.731 --> 01:24:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Did you sing?</v>

3227
01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:07.851
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3228
01:24:07.851 --> 01:24:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I sang all the musicals and stuff.</v>

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:15.860
<v Speaker 1>No mortgage giants saint a little bit.</v>

3233

3236
01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:20.493
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

3237
01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:21.453
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

3238
01:24:21.610 --> 01:24:22.900
<v Speaker 1>I can't just,</v>

3239
01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:28.140
<v Speaker 1>I picked you as a country western music inside of me.</v>

3240
01:24:28.450 --> 01:24:31.750
<v Speaker 1>I picture you're doing like a cover of like some Hank Williams Jr.</v>

3241
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:32.361
<v Speaker 1>No Dude,</v>

3242
01:24:32.361 --> 01:24:33.194
<v Speaker 1>I don't sing country.</v>

3243
01:24:33.930 --> 01:24:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Don't like country new kids on the block.</v>

3244
01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:36.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3245
01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:37.030
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3246
01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.480
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

3247
01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:38.950
<v Speaker 1>some people like have great voices,</v>

3248
01:24:38.951 --> 01:24:41.380
<v Speaker 1>but you gotta remember Justin Timberlake's been singing since he was a little</v>

3249
01:24:41.381 --> 01:24:42.940
<v Speaker 1>kid born with a lot of town though.</v>

3250
01:24:43.090 --> 01:24:44.410
<v Speaker 1>It's been saying since he was a little kid.</v>

3251
01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:47.380
<v Speaker 1>And toweling talent though talent,</v>

3252
01:24:47.381 --> 01:24:51.700
<v Speaker 1>but also like this is that I wish I could go wrong.</v>

3253
01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Bron James,</v>

3254
01:24:53.190 --> 01:24:53.441
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3255
01:24:53.441 --> 01:24:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

3256
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.940
<v Speaker 1>It's actually very different.</v>

3257
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

3258
01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:56.471
<v Speaker 1>Yes there's talent,</v>

3259
01:24:56.471 --> 01:24:56.860
<v Speaker 1>but there's all,</v>

3260
01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:57.790
<v Speaker 1>there's timing and common,</v>

3261
01:24:58.030 --> 01:25:01.040
<v Speaker 1>but like singing and dancing is something that when you've been doing since a</v>

3262
01:25:01.041 --> 01:25:02.770
<v Speaker 1>little kid like that,</v>

3263
01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:06.280
<v Speaker 1>that the reason that he's so good is that's been trained into it.</v>

3264
01:25:06.281 --> 01:25:08.020
<v Speaker 1>He also has tenant though be he has talent.</v>

3265
01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:11.020
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people definitely have talent,</v>

3266
01:25:11.021 --> 01:25:13.240
<v Speaker 1>but I think what Brian is saying is that you can get better.</v>

3267
01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:13.471
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3268
01:25:13.471 --> 01:25:14.290
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

3269
01:25:14.290 --> 01:25:17.170
<v Speaker 1>With coaching and I think that it's also a muscle,</v>

3270
01:25:17.650 --> 01:25:18.070
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

3271
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Throat your throat to 100% of muscle,</v>

3272
01:25:19.991 --> 01:25:20.340
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

3273
01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:21.021
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>

3274
01:25:21.021 --> 01:25:25.570
<v Speaker 1>you can get to be 100% of us so that you can get very good and very powerful</v>

3275
01:25:25.571 --> 01:25:26.350
<v Speaker 1>with your voice.</v>

3276
01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:28.810
<v Speaker 1>I just know too many Broadway singers and dancers,</v>

3277
01:25:28.811 --> 01:25:31.840
<v Speaker 1>the amount of practice that they put in from early ages,</v>

3278
01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:32.770
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3279
01:25:32.770 --> 01:25:33.401
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

3280
01:25:33.401 --> 01:25:34.910
<v Speaker 1>very physical products.</v>

3281
01:25:34.990 --> 01:25:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Like the opera is the same way and I agree.</v>

3282
01:25:36.491 --> 01:25:37.720
<v Speaker 1>You can practice being get better,</v>

3283
01:25:37.721 --> 01:25:39.250
<v Speaker 1>but don't you think a lot of those singers,</v>

3284
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:40.261
<v Speaker 1>they're pinched,</v>

3285
01:25:40.261 --> 01:25:41.500
<v Speaker 1>learned from a very young age?</v>

3286
01:25:41.501 --> 01:25:43.490
<v Speaker 1>They were performers like they were good at seashore.</v>

3287
01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:43.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3288
01:25:43.890 --> 01:25:44.723
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3289
01:25:45.150 --> 01:25:46.200
<v Speaker 1>probably not for you.</v>

3290
01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:49.780
<v Speaker 1>And even if even if Michael Jackson helped him sing all his life,</v>

3291
01:25:49.781 --> 01:25:51.140
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to be a professional singer.</v>

3292
01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.270
<v Speaker 1>So my Brummie lessons,</v>

3293
01:25:52.271 --> 01:25:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Adele had my exam it up.</v>

3294
01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3295
01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:55.720
<v Speaker 1>she's very special,</v>

3296
01:25:55.721 --> 01:25:57.310
<v Speaker 1>but she also was only singing.</v>

3297
01:25:57.340 --> 01:25:58.870
<v Speaker 1>She also makes money doing it,</v>

3298
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.261
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I knew I need to put on some muscle.</v>

3345
01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:58.220

<v Speaker 1>He eats bear three days a week.</v>

3531
01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:31.721
<v Speaker 1>He's just an animal.</v>

<v Speaker 1>undeniable.</v>

3539

<v Speaker 1>The fact that he's been running forever,</v>

3540
01:31:46.471 --> 01:31:47.304
<v Speaker 1>undeniable.</v>

<v Speaker 2>But the problem with Woodley is woolly can put you on the fucking planet.</v>

3729
01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Pluto was one punch.</v>

3730
01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:05.653
<v Speaker 2>He's so,</v>

3731
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:07.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3732
01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:10.460
<v Speaker 2>I get you a little stumbly Pluto one puck kind of fucking stumbled through that</v>

3733
01:36:10.461 --> 01:36:11.294
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

3734
01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:15.080
<v Speaker 2>Highly always say put you on Pluto was trying to come up with a better word.</v>

3735
01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Damien Maia has a very hard time taking Woodley down.</v>

3736
01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:18.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3737
01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:19.130
<v Speaker 2>how do you think that fight goes down?</v>

3738
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:21.050
<v Speaker 2>It's a hard fight for Damien.</v>

3739
01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Very hard fight because Damien Woodley is ruthlessly powerful on his feet.</v>

3740
01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:28.130
<v Speaker 2>His fucking striking is so scary.</v>

3741
01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:29.460
<v Speaker 2>Think about what he did to Wonderboy.</v>

3742
01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:30.440
<v Speaker 2>Two fights in a row.</v>

3743
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3744
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:32.060
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3745
01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:32.870
<v Speaker 2>two fights in a row.</v>

3746
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:33.530
<v Speaker 2>One fight,</v>

3747
01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:34.040
<v Speaker 2>two fights.</v>

3748
01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:36.200
<v Speaker 2>That second fight was punk shit.</v>

3749
01:36:36.230 --> 01:36:37.200
<v Speaker 2>He heard them bad though.</v>

3750
01:36:37.210 --> 01:36:38.630
<v Speaker 2>Still 30 seconds in the fifth round,</v>

3751
01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:39.950
<v Speaker 2>but still he can do that.</v>

3752
01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:41.360
<v Speaker 2>He can hurt you.</v>

3753
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:43.580
<v Speaker 2>It's always a liability and he's hurting Wonderboy.</v>

3754
01:36:43.670 --> 01:36:47.240
<v Speaker 2>Who's one of the best strikers literally ever in the 170 pound division.</v>

3755
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.780
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

3756
01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:49.340
<v Speaker 2>Tyron Woodley can hurt anybody.</v>

3757
01:36:49.341 --> 01:36:50.174
<v Speaker 2>He's got sucked.</v>

3758
01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:50.681
<v Speaker 2>Nobody did it.</v>

3759
01:36:50.681 --> 01:36:51.830
<v Speaker 2>Robbie Lawler one punch.</v>

3760
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.903
<v Speaker 2>Paul,</v>

3761
01:36:52.970 --> 01:36:53.601
<v Speaker 2>here's the problem.</v>

3762
01:36:53.601 --> 01:36:54.320
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem.</v>

3763
01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:55.011
<v Speaker 2>Well not the prime,</v>

3764
01:36:55.011 --> 01:36:57.410
<v Speaker 2>but here's what if Damien Maia stymied and engage in that,</v>

3765
01:36:57.560 --> 01:36:59.360
<v Speaker 2>he's going to jump to garden half guard.</v>

3766
01:36:59.390 --> 01:37:00.950
<v Speaker 2>That's where it gets tricky in a try.</v>

3767
01:37:00.951 --> 01:37:03.120
<v Speaker 2>But he's 39 years old and he's going to try to do,</v>

3768
01:37:04.090 --> 01:37:05.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about way big.</v>

3769
01:37:05.690 --> 01:37:05.811
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3770
01:37:05.811 --> 01:37:06.110
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

3771
01:37:06.110 --> 01:37:07.530
<v Speaker 2>he's way taller,</v>

3772
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:08.090
<v Speaker 2>taller,</v>

3773
01:37:08.090 --> 01:37:09.980
<v Speaker 2>but Tyron is a fucking tank.</v>

3774
01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:10.940
<v Speaker 2>He's all muscle.</v>

3775
01:37:11.170 --> 01:37:11.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3776
01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:11.690
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>

3777
01:37:11.690 --> 01:37:13.910
<v Speaker 2>but you get Damien Maia in a deep half guard.</v>

3778
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:14.833
<v Speaker 2>I don't care who you are.</v>

3779
01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:16.073
<v Speaker 2>You don't have some trouble.</v>

3780
01:37:16.180 --> 01:37:16.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3781
01:37:16.371 --> 01:37:18.620
<v Speaker 2>But you're going to be taking shots on the way in.</v>

3782
01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:19.001
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

3783
01:37:19.001 --> 01:37:19.730
<v Speaker 2>I th I think,</v>

3784
01:37:19.730 --> 01:37:19.881
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3785
01:37:19.881 --> 01:37:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Woodley's the roughest matchup for Damien Maia to get a belt.</v>

3786
01:37:22.511 --> 01:37:23.000
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

3787
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:23.571
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

3788
01:37:23.571 --> 01:37:24.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3789
01:37:24.030 --> 01:37:25.310
<v Speaker 2>There couldn't be a worst matchup for him,</v>

3790
01:37:25.311 --> 01:37:26.144
<v Speaker 2>but I like it.</v>

3791
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:27.950
<v Speaker 2>I like it because it's interesting.</v>

3792
01:37:27.951 --> 01:37:28.311
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>

3793
01:37:28.311 --> 01:37:31.610
<v Speaker 2>I wish Damien had a shot at this like a few years ago.</v>

3794
01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:33.180
<v Speaker 2>So Bob has got some good striking,</v>

3795
01:37:33.181 --> 01:37:34.130
<v Speaker 2>he's got a great chap,</v>

3796
01:37:34.131 --> 01:37:34.910
<v Speaker 2>watch this,</v>

3797
01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:37.760
<v Speaker 2>he's doing these undercuts and all this kind of stuff is good fighter.</v>

3798
01:37:38.210 --> 01:37:41.390
<v Speaker 2>Very good striker first dean lister in his corner.</v>

3799
01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:41.961
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3800
01:37:41.961 --> 01:37:42.231
<v Speaker 2>he is.</v>

3801
01:37:42.231 --> 01:37:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Definitely is dean lister and Peter Bought Sabattus called.</v>

3802
01:37:44.101 --> 01:37:44.390
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

3803
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

3804
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:48.110
<v Speaker 2>Where is he this jab as you'll see him.</v>

3805
01:37:48.230 --> 01:37:48.521
<v Speaker 2>Boom,</v>

3806
01:37:48.521 --> 01:37:49.250
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>

3807
01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:53.630
<v Speaker 2>Pretty sure Ben has gotten a long ass reach man and he likes to throw a lot of</v>

3808
01:37:53.631 --> 01:37:55.010
<v Speaker 2>those front kicks to the body,</v>

3809
01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:55.351
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

3810
01:37:55.351 --> 01:37:56.160
<v Speaker 2>How Bouts Cowboy</v>

3811
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Robbie Lawler.</v>

3812
01:37:57.630 --> 01:37:58.463
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

3813
01:37:59.490 --> 01:38:00.323
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

3814
01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:03.450
<v Speaker 1>So I think Ben,</v>

3815
01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:06.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean Ben can stand with people for sure,</v>

3816
01:38:06.570 --> 01:38:09.840
<v Speaker 1>but I think Ben's best chance is if you can get this fight to the ground.</v>

3817
01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3818
01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Cause he,</v>

3819
01:38:10.230 --> 01:38:12.520
<v Speaker 1>I think Ben in the clinic was really Japanese.</v>

3820
01:38:13.250 --> 01:38:14.520
<v Speaker 1>I Love Ben in the plum.</v>

3821
01:38:14.670 --> 01:38:14.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3822
01:38:14.911 --> 01:38:15.061
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3823
01:38:15.061 --> 01:38:15.960
<v Speaker 1>he's got a great poem.</v>

3824
01:38:16.010 --> 01:38:16.741
<v Speaker 1>He had a great plan.</v>

3825
01:38:16.741 --> 01:38:17.250
<v Speaker 1>What's these?</v>

3826
01:38:17.250 --> 01:38:17.731
<v Speaker 1>He's long.</v>

3827
01:38:17.731 --> 01:38:19.770
<v Speaker 1>They can't really get them to do so much bigger than them.</v>

3828
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.903
<v Speaker 1>What's the plum?</v>

3829
01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:22.080
<v Speaker 1>The Thai clinch.</v>

3830
01:38:22.410 --> 01:38:23.243
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

3831
01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3832
01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:24.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3833
01:38:24.810 --> 01:38:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Sabato has been lightened them up,</v>

3834
01:38:26.401 --> 01:38:27.240
<v Speaker 1>but that jab man,</v>

3835
01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:29.600
<v Speaker 1>that's a nice step in jab swift.</v>

3836
01:38:29.610 --> 01:38:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Just going underneath to,</v>

3837
01:38:30.781 --> 01:38:34.350
<v Speaker 1>he's doing an upper cuts and I think it's hard time sometimes when south paws</v>

3838
01:38:34.351 --> 01:38:35.580
<v Speaker 1>fight other south paws too,</v>

3839
01:38:35.581 --> 01:38:35.820
<v Speaker 1>that like,</v>

3840
01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

3841
01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:36.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3842
01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:36.771
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3843
01:38:36.771 --> 01:38:37.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit of a shit show.</v>

3844
01:38:37.741 --> 01:38:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3845
01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:42.420
<v Speaker 1>It's guys facing looks just like he's Ben's eyes pretty fucked up from that.</v>

3846
01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Keeps getting caught,</v>

3847
01:38:43.621 --> 01:38:44.454
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3848
01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:46.073
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3849
01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Working.</v>

3850
01:38:46.750 --> 01:38:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Ben's was trying to close the distance.</v>

3851
01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:48.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3852
01:38:48.910 --> 01:38:50.830
<v Speaker 1>you got click that left hand.</v>

3853
01:38:50.831 --> 01:38:51.221
<v Speaker 1>It's the same.</v>

3854
01:38:51.221 --> 01:38:52.054
<v Speaker 1>They right clip</v>

3855
01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:55.560
<v Speaker 1>and it's taken a lot of punishing.</v>

3856
01:38:55.580 --> 01:38:56.413
<v Speaker 1>Smooth.</v>

3857
01:38:56.450 --> 01:38:56.771
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3858
01:38:56.771 --> 01:39:00.490
<v Speaker 1>But he's trying to get time but he's trying to get that clinch in Sabata.</v>

3859
01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:01.091
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3860
01:39:01.091 --> 01:39:02.620
<v Speaker 1>let's see if he can do anything.</v>

3861
01:39:02.650 --> 01:39:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3862
01:39:03.250 --> 01:39:03.491
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3863
01:39:03.491 --> 01:39:03.831
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

3864
01:39:03.831 --> 01:39:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Much smarter bottle.</v>

3865
01:39:05.250 --> 01:39:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Just let them stand out.</v>

3866
01:39:06.191 --> 01:39:09.040
<v Speaker 1>A lot of fucked up wrapped up here.</v>

3867
01:39:09.041 --> 01:39:10.110
<v Speaker 1>He's got a mission control here.</v>

3868
01:39:10.111 --> 01:39:11.700
<v Speaker 1>This is what Ben needs is not good.</v>

3869
01:39:11.701 --> 01:39:12.730
<v Speaker 1>This is not good for us about it.</v>

3870
01:39:12.731 --> 01:39:14.820
<v Speaker 1>And Ben's got these crazy long ass legs.</v>

3871
01:39:14.830 --> 01:39:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Gonna get that left leg out.</v>

3872
01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Watch.</v>

3873
01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:17.260
<v Speaker 1>Watch him pop that left leg out.</v>

3874
01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:18.310
<v Speaker 1>He's also Staccato.</v>

3875
01:39:18.430 --> 01:39:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Sabata is trying to ease his uh,</v>

3876
01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:22.990
<v Speaker 1>his right knee forward every time Ben moves his leg,</v>

3877
01:39:22.991 --> 01:39:24.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to pop up over the top.</v>

3878
01:39:24.370 --> 01:39:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Now Subodh is not in a good place.</v>

3879
01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:27.693
<v Speaker 1>This is not good.</v>

3880
01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:31.060
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to put tea in danger of getting caught with hear submissions.</v>

3881
01:39:31.330 --> 01:39:32.111
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

3882
01:39:32.111 --> 01:39:35.470
<v Speaker 1>his left arm was completely trapped in his right arm is on the mat,</v>

3883
01:39:35.471 --> 01:39:36.550
<v Speaker 1>which is the wrong place for it.</v>

3884
01:39:36.551 --> 01:39:40.270
<v Speaker 1>Cause his right arm should be on the chest right now because Ben's going to put</v>

3885
01:39:40.271 --> 01:39:41.260
<v Speaker 1>him in the dead orchard,</v>

3886
01:39:41.470 --> 01:39:44.710
<v Speaker 1>which means both legs trapped in a triangle or both arms rather trapped in a</v>

3887
01:39:44.711 --> 01:39:45.544
<v Speaker 1>triangle.</v>

3888
01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:46.660
<v Speaker 1>How much time is left though?</v>

3889
01:39:46.710 --> 01:39:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Not much pulled the clock.</v>

3890
01:39:48.391 --> 01:39:49.690
<v Speaker 1>It's probably 10 10 seconds.</v>

3891
01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3892
01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:52.030
<v Speaker 1>But also remember Ben's recovering right now.</v>

3893
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:54.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a great move by Ben.</v>

3894
01:39:54.610 --> 01:39:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Terrible move by homeboy to let him go to fly farm down to the ground.</v>

3895
01:39:58.030 --> 01:39:58.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3896
01:39:58.361 --> 01:39:59.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why he did that.</v>

3897
01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:01.630
<v Speaker 1>I think he thought he can hammer them out.</v>

3898
01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:03.893
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3899
01:40:05.130 --> 01:40:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3900
01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:06.533
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

3901
01:40:06.990 --> 01:40:08.880
<v Speaker 1>So what we were talking about non fight related,</v>

3902
01:40:08.881 --> 01:40:11.130
<v Speaker 1>we were just talking about something super important.</v>

3903
01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:13.673
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3904
01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:14.600
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

3905
01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:16.050
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about Tyron Woodley,</v>

3906
01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:16.670
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

3907
01:40:16.670 --> 01:40:17.590
<v Speaker 1>He was a singer.</v>

3908
01:40:17.670 --> 01:40:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Jermaine Cyborg.</v>

3909
01:40:20.090 --> 01:40:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3910
01:40:20.790 --> 01:40:21.623
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3911
01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:23.650
<v Speaker 1>I think takes a lot too much.</v>

3912
01:40:23.651 --> 01:40:24.720
<v Speaker 1>You do too much hate.</v>

3913
01:40:24.721 --> 01:40:24.961
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3914
01:40:24.961 --> 01:40:25.794
<v Speaker 1>she do you,</v>

3915
01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:26.713
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

3916
01:40:26.970 --> 01:40:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Change your physiology.</v>

3917
01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:29.213
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think that,</v>

3918
01:40:29.550 --> 01:40:30.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3919
01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:31.500
<v Speaker 1>no more than anybody else has.</v>

3920
01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:31.771
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3921
01:40:31.771 --> 01:40:33.840
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about the woman has done that?</v>

3922
01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:35.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3923
01:40:35.190 --> 01:40:38.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean if we're talking about steroid use that she got caught with 2012,</v>

3924
01:40:38.551 --> 01:40:40.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many people have been caught with a steroid?</v>

3925
01:40:40.270 --> 01:40:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I think she takes out an unfair Bronto look at that straight.</v>

3926
01:40:43.570 --> 01:40:44.403
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3927
01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:46.053
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3928
01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:48.601
<v Speaker 1>It is what it is.</v>

3929
01:40:48.601 --> 01:40:49.091
<v Speaker 1>So let's see.</v>

3930
01:40:49.091 --> 01:40:51.330
<v Speaker 1>What do you do with that 145 pound division?</v>

3931
01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:52.920
<v Speaker 1>You just don't give Cyborg a fight.</v>

3932
01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3933
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.611
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

3934
01:40:54.611 --> 01:40:54.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3935
01:40:54.770 --> 01:40:55.660
<v Speaker 2>you vacate.</v>

3936
01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:58.240
<v Speaker 2>If Germain de Randamie does not want to fight Cyborg,</v>

3937
01:40:58.241 --> 01:40:58.780
<v Speaker 2>but she said,</v>

3938
01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:02.170
<v Speaker 2>and you are allowing Cyborg to fight and she won't fight her.</v>

3939
01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:02.801
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

3940
01:41:02.801 --> 01:41:03.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3941
01:41:03.070 --> 01:41:03.461
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

3942
01:41:03.461 --> 01:41:04.540
<v Speaker 2>you got to give Cyborg.</v>

3943
01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:06.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean you got to give her a fight,</v>

3944
01:41:06.581 --> 01:41:06.761
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3945
01:41:06.761 --> 01:41:07.870
<v Speaker 2>Isn't she fighting cat?</v>

3946
01:41:08.330 --> 01:41:10.030
<v Speaker 2>But what cat and her both want it,</v>

3947
01:41:10.031 --> 01:41:10.450
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

3948
01:41:10.450 --> 01:41:11.201
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>

3949
01:41:11.201 --> 01:41:13.150
<v Speaker 2>they want to announce the fight on the Anaheim card.</v>

3950
01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Why won't they announce it?</v>

3951
01:41:14.350 --> 01:41:15.580
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea to talk to your boy.</v>

3952
01:41:15.730 --> 01:41:16.563
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

3953
01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:17.680
<v Speaker 2>Well who knows what's going on.</v>

3954
01:41:17.681 --> 01:41:20.470
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to talk to Kat cause cat just came out hard against Reebok.</v>

3955
01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:20.900
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3956
01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:22.420
<v Speaker 2>we'll see that the,</v>

3957
01:41:22.421 --> 01:41:23.021
<v Speaker 2>I saw that.</v>

3958
01:41:23.021 --> 01:41:23.681
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is,</v>

3959
01:41:23.681 --> 01:41:24.830
<v Speaker 2>is a cat,</v>

3960
01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:25.090
<v Speaker 2>cat,</v>

3961
01:41:25.090 --> 01:41:27.190
<v Speaker 2>cat wants to fight Cyborg once the fight,</v>

3962
01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:27.970
<v Speaker 2>but something,</v>

3963
01:41:27.970 --> 01:41:29.830
<v Speaker 2>there's some seems to be some sort of hiccup.</v>

3964
01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:31.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure why know what it is.</v>

3965
01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:32.253
<v Speaker 2>But also,</v>

3966
01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:32.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3967
01:41:32.721 --> 01:41:32.850
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

3968
01:41:32.850 --> 01:41:33.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3969
01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:34.750
<v Speaker 2>sideboards going on social media,</v>

3970
01:41:34.780 --> 01:41:35.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3971
01:41:35.021 --> 01:41:35.561
<v Speaker 2>and it's good.</v>

3972
01:41:35.561 --> 01:41:36.400
<v Speaker 2>She's voice in a pinch.</v>

3973
01:41:36.401 --> 01:41:37.234
<v Speaker 2>She's unhappy,</v>

3974
01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:38.170
<v Speaker 2>but it's relentless.</v>

3975
01:41:38.171 --> 01:41:39.130
<v Speaker 2>It's every day.</v>

3976
01:41:39.490 --> 01:41:41.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they want that as their champ.</v>

3977
01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:44.350
<v Speaker 2>So you want the fight and you won't be the champ now,</v>

3978
01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:45.310
<v Speaker 2>but the UFC is going,</v>

3979
01:41:45.311 --> 01:41:46.070
<v Speaker 2>hold up.</v>

3980
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.440
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

3981
01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:47.140
<v Speaker 2>she's already,</v>

3982
01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:47.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3983
01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:47.891
<v Speaker 2>yelling.</v>

3984
01:41:47.891 --> 01:41:51.370
<v Speaker 2>Now what is she saying every day she's saying gimme a fight.</v>

3985
01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:51.911
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3986
01:41:51.911 --> 01:41:53.410
<v Speaker 2>Ben Saunders with a stiff jab.</v>

3987
01:41:53.710 --> 01:41:54.543
<v Speaker 2>She's literally saying,</v>

3988
01:41:54.850 --> 01:41:55.571
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>

3989
01:41:55.571 --> 01:41:55.991
<v Speaker 2>Give me a fight.</v>

3990
01:41:55.991 --> 01:41:57.160
<v Speaker 2>Let me fight Megan Anderson,</v>

3991
01:41:57.161 --> 01:41:57.431
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>

3992
01:41:57.431 --> 01:41:58.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3993
01:41:58.120 --> 01:41:58.901
<v Speaker 2>champion and Victor,</v>

3994
01:41:58.901 --> 01:41:59.651
<v Speaker 2>let me fight cat.</v>

3995
01:41:59.651 --> 01:42:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Let me fight somebody.</v>

3996
01:42:00.581 --> 01:42:01.414
<v Speaker 2>Do something.</v>

3997
01:42:01.690 --> 01:42:02.021
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3998
01:42:02.021 --> 01:42:02.980
<v Speaker 2>I could see her argument.</v>

3999
01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:03.790
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

4000
01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:04.481
<v Speaker 2>She wants a fight.</v>

4001
01:42:04.481 --> 01:42:04.811
<v Speaker 2>And Megan,</v>

4002
01:42:04.811 --> 01:42:04.951
<v Speaker 2>Hannah,</v>

4003
01:42:04.951 --> 01:42:05.771
<v Speaker 2>she wants a fighter.</v>

4004
01:42:05.771 --> 01:42:06.910
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a good fight.</v>

4005
01:42:07.300 --> 01:42:08.230
<v Speaker 2>The best fight can make,</v>

4006
01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:09.081
<v Speaker 2>can just go.</v>

4007
01:42:09.081 --> 01:42:09.914
<v Speaker 2>It really doesn't make sense.</v>

4008
01:42:10.090 --> 01:42:10.301
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4009
01:42:10.301 --> 01:42:13.750
<v Speaker 2>cats and gotten was a name in the UFC and Megan and Sean doesn't have a name in</v>

4010
01:42:13.751 --> 01:42:14.584
<v Speaker 2>the UFC yet.</v>

4011
01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:15.581
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

4012
01:42:15.581 --> 01:42:16.121
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

4013
01:42:16.121 --> 01:42:16.841
<v Speaker 2>That's a good fight.</v>

4014
01:42:16.841 --> 01:42:18.400
<v Speaker 2>And Megan Anderson's a big girl,</v>

4015
01:42:19.690 --> 01:42:20.171

4165
01:45:09.891 --> 01:45:10.970
<v Speaker 2>you sought a rules.</v>

4166
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:13.560
<v Speaker 2>She'd pass the test burner.</v>

4167
01:45:13.610 --> 01:45:15.680
<v Speaker 2>Dallas Commission like NASA and not up in here.</v>

4168
01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:16.781
<v Speaker 2>Under you side.</v>

4169
01:45:16.781 --> 01:45:17.151
<v Speaker 2>A rural,</v>

4170
01:45:17.151 --> 01:45:18.080
<v Speaker 2>she passed the test.</v>

4171
01:45:18.590 --> 01:45:19.400
<v Speaker 2>How's that work?</v>

4172
01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:20.330
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

4173
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:24.380
<v Speaker 2>But she has an elevated epitestosterone to testosterone ratio,</v>

4174
01:45:24.381 --> 01:45:24.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4175
01:45:24.860 --> 01:45:25.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4176
01:45:25.161 --> 01:45:26.450
<v Speaker 2>Before Dallas though.</v>

4177
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:29.060
<v Speaker 2>But under Usada regulation she did it.</v>

4178
01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:30.081
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>

4179
01:45:30.081 --> 01:45:31.910
<v Speaker 2>But Dallas commissions when who overturned it?</v>

4180
01:45:31.911 --> 01:45:33.470
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's the commission and that weird.</v>

4181
01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:34.281
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4182
01:45:34.281 --> 01:45:35.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean it makes you think like,</v>

4183
01:45:35.271 --> 01:45:40.100
<v Speaker 2>why doesn't you sought to have more stringent testing than doubt?</v>

4184
01:45:40.101 --> 01:45:43.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why they have different standards like Olympics one to one I</v>

4185
01:45:43.731 --> 01:45:44.060
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

4186
01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:45.020
<v Speaker 2>or two to one.</v>

4187
01:45:45.070 --> 01:45:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Some are four to 101 case he picked up the biggest wham blah blah blah.</v>

4188
01:45:49.590 --> 01:45:54.200
<v Speaker 2>You S Usada the official antidoping agency has yet to announce if they will be</v>

4189
01:45:54.201 --> 01:45:55.250
<v Speaker 2>taking any action.</v>

4190
01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:55.881
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4191
01:45:55.881 --> 01:45:59.030
<v Speaker 2>so Dallas is only suspended her for a short amount of time.</v>

4192
01:45:59.031 --> 01:46:01.160
<v Speaker 2>Now the only suspend her for 90 days.</v>

4193
01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:05.060
<v Speaker 2>We have not been informed by you side of anything regarding potential</v>

4194
01:46:05.061 --> 01:46:07.610
<v Speaker 2>anti-doping policy violation for Cortney Casey,</v>

4195
01:46:08.090 --> 01:46:09.020
<v Speaker 2>no positive tests,</v>

4196
01:46:09.021 --> 01:46:13.460
<v Speaker 2>no suspicion of anything now or in the past who saw it as not been in contact</v>

4197
01:46:13.461 --> 01:46:14.294
<v Speaker 2>about anything.</v>

4198
01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:17.060
<v Speaker 2>So scroll up to the top of this article.</v>

4199
01:46:17.330 --> 01:46:18.740
<v Speaker 2>So what happened here then?</v>

4200
01:46:21.110 --> 01:46:22.490
<v Speaker 2>Suspended for three months.</v>

4201
01:46:22.550 --> 01:46:26.870
<v Speaker 2>See that's what's weird because suspending her for three months through Dallas,</v>

4202
01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:27.230
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

4203
01:46:27.230 --> 01:46:31.180
<v Speaker 2>if you get suspended through Usada it's two years.</v>

4204
01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:32.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4205
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:32.420
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4206
01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:33.290
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it two years?</v>

4207
01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:35.450
<v Speaker 2>But I mean most of the commissions they listened,</v>

4208
01:46:35.451 --> 01:46:36.920
<v Speaker 2>they all follow the same rules,</v>

4209
01:46:36.921 --> 01:46:38.750
<v Speaker 2>but she's just suspended in Dallas.</v>

4210
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4211
01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:40.623
<v Speaker 2>Joe Daddy.</v>

4212
01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:41.953
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>

4213
01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:43.393
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

4214
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:44.263
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

4215
01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:44.660
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

4216
01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:45.111
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>

4217
01:46:45.111 --> 01:46:45.790
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>

4218
01:46:45.790 --> 01:46:45.891
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4219
01:46:45.891 --> 01:46:46.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4220
01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:46.791
<v Speaker 2>four to one.</v>

4221
01:46:46.791 --> 01:46:49.560
<v Speaker 2>What I think Olympics two to one just depends on commission.</v>

4222
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:53.010
<v Speaker 2>But with you Sadik cause you saw it as an employee of the UFC.</v>

4223
01:46:53.011 --> 01:46:56.810
<v Speaker 2>Remember you saw it as an outsource sub contracted employee.</v>

4224
01:46:56.830 --> 01:46:57.470
<v Speaker 2>The UFC.</v>

4225
01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:57.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4226
01:46:57.630 --> 01:46:59.280
<v Speaker 2>But how does you saw to not catch it?</v>

4227
01:46:59.281 --> 01:47:00.300
<v Speaker 2>That's what I don't understand.</v>

4228
01:47:00.570 --> 01:47:00.961
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

4229
01:47:00.961 --> 01:47:02.460
<v Speaker 2>they test the samples as well.</v>

4230
01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't it random?</v>

4231
01:47:04.170 --> 01:47:05.010
<v Speaker 2>They don't test everyone,</v>

4232
01:47:05.011 --> 01:47:05.640
<v Speaker 2>do they?</v>

4233
01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:06.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4234
01:47:06.330 --> 01:47:06.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

4235
01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:08.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they don't test every fighter on the card.</v>

4236
01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:09.180
<v Speaker 2>I I,</v>

4237
01:47:09.180 --> 01:47:10.230
<v Speaker 2>but Dallas does.</v>

4238
01:47:10.890 --> 01:47:11.970
<v Speaker 2>Dallas did random.</v>

4239
01:47:11.971 --> 01:47:13.440
<v Speaker 2>She was one of the random ones.</v>

4240
01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:18.420
<v Speaker 2>Now what causes someone to have an elevated epitestosterone range?</v>

4241
01:47:18.421 --> 01:47:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a bunch.</v>

4242
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:21.120
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of wasted.</v>

4243
01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:21.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4244
01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:22.081
<v Speaker 2>Trip those.</v>

4245
01:47:22.081 --> 01:47:22.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4246
01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:25.860
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of it is like taking some sort of external testosterone.</v>

4247
01:47:25.890 --> 01:47:26.330
<v Speaker 2>It'd be,</v>

4248
01:47:26.330 --> 01:47:27.163
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4249
01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Peter Soboba TKL fight too and looking good.</v>

4328
01:49:13.501 --> 01:49:16.230

<v Speaker 1>Then if you're UFC guy,</v>

4452
01:52:31.511 --> 01:52:32.141
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>

4453
01:52:32.141 --> 01:52:32.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4454
01:52:32.680 --> 01:52:34.540
<v Speaker 1>You got to find out whether or not you can.</v>

4455
01:52:35.170 --> 01:52:36.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a different game.</v>

4456
01:52:36.190 --> 01:52:37.180
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you this right now.</v>

4457
01:52:37.181 --> 01:52:38.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be Jimmy Manawat.</v>

4458
01:52:39.130 --> 01:52:39.760
<v Speaker 1>These curls.</v>

4459
01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:40.001
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4460
01:52:40.001 --> 01:52:41.380
<v Speaker 1>who knows if they're going to give him Jenny.</v>

4461
01:52:41.381 --> 01:52:41.671
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

4462
01:52:41.671 --> 01:52:41.860
<v Speaker 1>he works.</v>

4463
01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:45.920
<v Speaker 1>The Jimi Manuwa is like top three in the world right now at heavyweight though.</v>

4464
01:52:45.921 --> 01:52:46.754
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking,</v>

4465
01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:47.840
<v Speaker 1>we need something.</v>

4466
01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:48.561
<v Speaker 1>That's how we,</v>

4467
01:52:48.561 --> 01:52:48.801
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4468
01:52:48.801 --> 01:52:51.020
<v Speaker 1>well I just feel like someone,</v>

4469
01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:54.620
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have put him in there with someone that's a good fighter,</v>

4470
01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:56.450
<v Speaker 1>but this is just striking.</v>

4471
01:52:56.451 --> 01:52:58.220
<v Speaker 1>This is a big test though.</v>

4472
01:52:58.460 --> 01:53:00.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean to have him come into the UFC,</v>

4473
01:53:00.501 --> 01:53:01.550
<v Speaker 1>it's a big signing.</v>

4474
01:53:01.670 --> 01:53:03.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a big deal for a guy like me.</v>

4475
01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:05.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean my Dick is hard as a rock right now.</v>

4476
01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:07.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm very excited about this.</v>

4477
01:53:07.101 --> 01:53:09.350
<v Speaker 1>I promise you God.</v>

4478
01:53:09.351 --> 01:53:10.070
<v Speaker 1>That's some,</v>

4479
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:11.720
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's a Bella Torah move.</v>

4480
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.901
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4481
01:53:11.901 --> 01:53:12.061

01:53:17.301 --> 01:53:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

4485
01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:19.220
<v Speaker 1>he's going to put hands on people.</v>

4486
01:53:19.250 --> 01:53:19.401
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4487
01:53:19.401 --> 01:53:20.090
<v Speaker 1>he's not.</v>

4488
01:53:20.090 --> 01:53:20.311
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4489
01:53:20.311 --> 01:53:23.390
<v Speaker 1>I'll take a high school wrestler and he's going to mop on the fucking floor.</v>

4490
01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Give them a high school wrestler,</v>

4491

4492
01:53:27.530 --> 01:53:31.180
<v Speaker 1>I want to give him somebody who lost a bet who has to go in there and stare and</v>

4493
01:53:31.250 --> 01:53:33.260
<v Speaker 1>it has a little bit of grudge and the UFC is like,</v>

4494
01:53:33.261 --> 01:53:36.470
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to do this one for someone who's just like,</v>

4495
01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:37.100
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

4496
01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:38.240
<v Speaker 1>questionable judgment.</v>

4497
01:53:38.780 --> 01:53:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Someone who makes a lot of mistakes in their lives,</v>

4498
01:53:40.821 --> 01:53:43.400
<v Speaker 1>they're a good striker strike.</v>

4504
01:53:50.190 --> 01:53:52.310

01:56:10.411 --> 01:56:11.880
<v Speaker 1>but the numbers aren't crazy.</v>

4595
01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:13.073
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying like a needle.</v>

4596
01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:14.340
<v Speaker 1>What were the numbers on that?</v>

4597
01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Can you bring that up Jamie?</v>

4598
01:56:15.841 --> 01:56:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I know it wasn't like ground shaking.</v>

4599
01:56:17.970 --> 01:56:18.661
<v Speaker 1>You know what's crazy?</v>

4600
01:56:18.661 --> 01:56:20.140
<v Speaker 1>I was watching Spencer broke yesterday.</v>

4601
01:56:20.141 --> 01:56:20.341
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

4602
01:56:20.341 --> 01:56:21.001
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

4603
01:56:21.001 --> 01:56:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Boxing this year is better than UFC for the first time.</v>

4604
01:56:24.571 --> 01:56:25.500
<v Speaker 1>It allows a pick fight.</v>

4605
01:56:25.650 --> 01:56:27.990
<v Speaker 1>But Boston in general this year has been killing it.</v>

4606
01:56:28.020 --> 01:56:28.381
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

4607
01:56:28.381 --> 01:56:29.490
<v Speaker 1>And they're making the matchups.</v>

4608
01:56:29.491 --> 01:56:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Everyone wants to see overlap.</v>

4609
01:56:30.871 --> 01:56:31.830

4639
01:57:01.411 --> 01:57:02.100
<v Speaker 1>Triple G.</v>

4640
01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:02.381
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

4641
01:57:02.381 --> 01:57:03.214
<v Speaker 1>but isn't that crazy?</v>

4642
01:57:03.270 --> 01:57:03.901
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>

4643
01:57:03.901 --> 01:57:05.160
<v Speaker 1>He barely speaks English,</v>

4644
01:57:05.161 --> 01:57:06.440
<v Speaker 1>but he's such a phenomenal box.</v>

4645
01:57:06.441 --> 01:57:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4646
01:57:06.630 --> 01:57:06.931
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

4647
01:57:06.931 --> 01:57:09.570
<v Speaker 1>But Canelo Chavez got over a million paper.</v>

4648
01:57:09.571 --> 01:57:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Canelo doesn't speak English at all.</v>

4649
01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:12.480
<v Speaker 1>He can't a little,</v>

4650
01:57:12.510 --> 01:57:14.100
<v Speaker 1>but he likes to stick to his native tongue.</v>

4651
01:57:15.330 --> 01:57:16.163
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll just say Steve Bay doe sit like that card was a bang.</v>

4653
01:57:23.070 --> 01:57:24.660
<v Speaker 1>He likes to stick to his native tongue.</v>

4654
01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:28.750
<v Speaker 1>I would jack off certain things you say real sexual flare,</v>

4655
01:57:28.770 --> 01:57:30.580
<v Speaker 1>like sexual innuendo in there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know to soaring blackbuck I'll be a natural funny guy.</v>

4657
01:57:35.401 --> 01:57:36.001

4668
01:57:55.341 --> 01:57:56.161

4669
01:57:56.161 --> 01:57:58.710
<v Speaker 1>so that was the best card to the gear.</v>

4670
01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Live gate record for the UFC events.</v>

4671
01:58:00.661 --> 01:58:01.980
<v Speaker 1>The American Airlines Center,</v>

<v Speaker 1>2.6 million,</v>

01:58:04.110 --> 01:58:07.590
<v Speaker 1>19,000 fans interest too in 50,000 for that.</v>

4674
01:58:07.710 --> 01:58:08.820
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy to me,</v>

4675
01:58:08.821 --> 01:58:09.060
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4676
01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:10.470
<v Speaker 1>That's such a fun card.</v>

4677
01:58:10.530 --> 01:58:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4678
01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:13.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's just when this weird time where people are,</v>

4679
01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:14.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4680
01:58:14.220 --> 01:58:19.220
<v Speaker 1>how old do you think is this going to do the versus a 50,000 I'd say Joseph</v>

4681
01:58:19.660 --> 01:58:21.240
<v Speaker 1>verse a Holloway in America,</v>

4682
01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:21.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

01:58:24.970 --> 01:58:25.291
<v Speaker 1>Gary,</v>

4685
01:58:25.291 --> 01:58:25.640
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4686
01:58:25.640 --> 01:58:26.520
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy though.</v>

4687
01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:28.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the world we're in right now.</v>

4688
01:58:28.171 --> 01:58:29.004
<v Speaker 1>Ontario.</v>

4689
01:58:29.230 --> 01:58:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it talks about mismanagement by the UFC.</v>

4690
01:58:31.590 --> 01:58:32.680
<v Speaker 1>I think that what you said about,</v>

4691
01:58:32.681 --> 01:58:36.090
<v Speaker 1>it's not frank care giving that young guy to Frankie Edgar,</v>

4692
01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:38.370
<v Speaker 1>that's a different thing now that's a different thing.</v>

4693
01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:39.233
<v Speaker 1>You're young.</v>

4694
01:58:39.580 --> 01:58:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4695
01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:44.380
<v Speaker 1>It's just you go through phases in fighting like box right now it's killing it</v>

4696
01:58:44.381 --> 01:58:46.150
<v Speaker 1>and they have all these stars ready to compete.</v>

4697
01:58:46.300 --> 01:58:47.350
<v Speaker 1>You can see right now in that,</v>

4698
01:58:47.351 --> 01:58:48.250
<v Speaker 1>after the fact,</v>

4699
01:58:48.251 --> 01:58:51.010
<v Speaker 1>if [inaudible] did to Frankie Edgar what he did to Bj Penn,</v>

4700
01:58:51.250 --> 01:58:53.050
<v Speaker 1>you've got a giant superstar in Mexico.</v>

4701
01:58:54.010 --> 01:58:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Let's be fair though,</v>

4702
01:58:54.881 --> 01:58:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

4703
01:58:55.300 --> 01:58:55.631
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4704
01:58:55.631 --> 01:58:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Year fighting.</v>

4705
01:58:57.011 --> 01:58:59.840
<v Speaker 1>Bj Penn is completely different than the know you're fighting Frankie egg.</v>

4706
01:58:59.841 --> 01:59:00.041
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4707
01:59:00.041 --> 01:59:04.380
<v Speaker 1>100% like I love Bj Penn more than a lot of people.</v>

4708
01:59:04.390 --> 01:59:06.150
<v Speaker 1>100% he had no business fighting a year.</v>

4709
01:59:06.280 --> 01:59:07.890
<v Speaker 1>That was a shitty fight to do to budget.</v>

4710
01:59:07.891 --> 01:59:09.780
<v Speaker 1>We found out that he had no business.</v>

4711
01:59:10.450 --> 01:59:11.740
<v Speaker 1>He thought that he did.</v>

4712
01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Did we thought he was going to be able to do something.</v>

4713
01:59:13.661 --> 01:59:14.494
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

4714
01:59:14.850 --> 01:59:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Well and then when like,</v>

4715
01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:16.421
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4716
01:59:16.421 --> 01:59:16.900
<v Speaker 1>you're Frankie,</v>

4717
01:59:16.900 --> 01:59:19.300
<v Speaker 1>but remember the desire asked for Frankie.</v>

4718
01:59:21.610 --> 01:59:21.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4719
01:59:21.761 --> 01:59:26.510
<v Speaker 1>but you don't just cause he asked for is it timeless father time sense though.</v>

4720
01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:29.110
<v Speaker 1>It was timeless for Randy coture.</v>

4721
01:59:29.860 --> 01:59:30.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4722
01:59:30.221 --> 01:59:31.840
<v Speaker 1>until Machita said is it timeless?</v>

4723

<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying Bro.</v>

4732
01:59:57.700 --> 02:00:01.930
<v Speaker 1>You look at light heavyweight like suits and stuff from Toronto fighting a</v>

4733
02:00:01.940 --> 02:00:02.773
<v Speaker 1>Toronto.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Number five rank.</v>

4771
02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:05.410

5024
02:07:39.610 --> 02:07:41.530
<v Speaker 1>How do you describe jumping in by describing</v>

5025
02:07:45.790 --> 02:07:46.181
<v Speaker 1>what color?</v>

5026

<v Speaker 1>The carpet even then I'm furious.</v>

5027
02:07:48.761 --> 02:07:50.920
<v Speaker 1>I describe him as a man was small calves in a high belly button.</v>

5028
02:07:50.921 --> 02:07:51.754
<v Speaker 1>That's all I say.</v>

5029
02:07:52.090 --> 02:07:52.781

5032
02:07:56.080 --> 02:07:56.913
<v Speaker 1>no racism.</v>

5033
02:07:57.370 --> 02:07:58.150
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

5034
02:07:58.150 --> 02:07:59.740
<v Speaker 1>as I was going to buy some chicken,</v>

5035
02:07:59.741 --> 02:08:00.574
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a white guy,</v>

5036
02:08:01.320 --> 02:08:02.170
<v Speaker 1>I like chicken too.</v>

5037
02:08:02.950 --> 02:08:07.540
<v Speaker 1>There was this guy in line that could not be anything but black just by like,</v>

5038
02:08:07.570 --> 02:08:09.340
<v Speaker 1>I could like send you a picture.</v>

5039
02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.710
<v Speaker 1>His ass was so ridiculous.</v>

5040
02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:13.960
<v Speaker 1>It was like this guy was fat too.</v>

5041
02:08:13.961 --> 02:08:15.160
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like an athlete,</v>

5042
02:08:15.190 --> 02:08:15.900
<v Speaker 1>but he's asking,</v>

5043
02:08:15.900 --> 02:08:16.601
<v Speaker 1>he met up his back.</v>

5044
02:08:16.601 --> 02:08:19.240
<v Speaker 1>He had like a belly and his upper body looked normal,</v>

5045
02:08:19.480 --> 02:08:21.190
<v Speaker 1>but his ass was literally like,</v>

5046
02:08:21.191 --> 02:08:23.050
<v Speaker 1>he was stealing basketball.</v>

5047
02:08:24.130 --> 02:08:26.070
<v Speaker 1>This guy put a basketball in each.</v>

5048
02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Celebrate that.</v>

5049
02:08:27.850 --> 02:08:29.250
<v Speaker 1>I call that the ostrich effect.</v>

5050
02:08:29.290 --> 02:08:30.550
<v Speaker 1>I'll see some Instagram girls,</v>

02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:39.473
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5058
02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:41.470

5059
02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:42.191
<v Speaker 1>it's a black girl,</v>

<v Speaker 1>she'll get you.</v>

5063
02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Well the white girls that have those acids that are fake,</v>

5064
02:08:46.930 --> 02:08:49.300
<v Speaker 1>the problem is they don't have fake thighs.</v>

5065
02:08:49.330 --> 02:08:49.780
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

5066
02:08:49.780 --> 02:08:53.350
<v Speaker 1>So they have these two pages look like popsicles,</v>

5067
02:08:53.351 --> 02:08:55.000
<v Speaker 1>like those Kim Kardashian pictures.</v>

5068
02:08:55.020 --> 02:08:58.210
<v Speaker 1>You saw this kid event wondering if those are real sir.</v>

5069
02:08:58.240 --> 02:08:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

5070
02:08:58.810 --> 02:09:00.490
<v Speaker 1>and so she did get a fake ass here.</v>

5071
02:09:00.491 --> 02:09:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

5072
02:09:01.020 --> 02:09:03.220
<v Speaker 1>100% here's the way in this room would have fun.</v>

5073
02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Here's what happened.</v>

5074
02:09:04.380 --> 02:09:09.250
<v Speaker 1>What she usually does is bring fake Paparazzi with her places.</v>

5075
02:09:09.460 --> 02:09:13.750
<v Speaker 1>They take these fake candid photos and they airbrushed the shit out of him.</v>

5076
02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:15.100
<v Speaker 1>They Photoshop them,</v>

5077
02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:16.690
<v Speaker 1>they make everything look beautiful.</v>

5078
02:09:16.810 --> 02:09:18.460
<v Speaker 1>But when she was in Mexico,</v>

5079
02:09:18.461 --> 02:09:21.360
<v Speaker 1>she got jacked by Real Paparazzi to Mexia.</v>

5080
02:09:21.370 --> 02:09:22.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

5081
02:09:22.961 --> 02:09:27.880
<v Speaker 1>They were hiding in the bushes and they did some real Paparazzi pictures.</v>

5082
02:09:27.900 --> 02:09:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5083
02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:29.530
<v Speaker 1>that it's not a good look.</v>

5084
02:09:29.531 --> 02:09:30.730
<v Speaker 1>I was hearing about Paul.</v>

5085
02:09:30.910 --> 02:09:31.061
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5086
02:09:31.061 --> 02:09:34.260
<v Speaker 1>it's horrible because they're eating tamales,</v>

5087
02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:35.500
<v Speaker 1>big lumpy,</v>

5088
02:09:35.501 --> 02:09:38.700
<v Speaker 1>dumpy thing and then the legs of these little skinny things.</v>

5089
02:09:38.710 --> 02:09:39.310
<v Speaker 1>They're not doing any,</v>

5090
02:09:39.310 --> 02:09:39.461
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5091
02:09:39.461 --> 02:09:40.180

5092
02:09:40.180 --> 02:09:41.350
<v Speaker 1>she's not an athlete.</v>

5093
02:09:41.590 --> 02:09:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you look like,</v>

5099
02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:56.430
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at her arms.</v>

5100
02:09:56.431 --> 02:09:58.900
<v Speaker 1>She had this very nice little dress and I was looking at her.</v>

02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:53.960
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe you might have a real desert Drake before that.</v>

5170
02:11:53.961 --> 02:11:54.720
<v Speaker 2>He's not like,</v>

5171
02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:55.970
<v Speaker 2>he might have a real dick.</v>

5172
02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:56.930
<v Speaker 2>Maybe does.</v>

02:12:02.150 --> 02:12:03.140
<v Speaker 2>and we don't know.</v>

5176
02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:04.280
<v Speaker 2>Or girls don't care that much.</v>

5177
02:12:04.281 --> 02:12:04.920
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>

5178
02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:07.190
<v Speaker 2>He pulls it out and smoke comes out of the nose.</v>

5179
02:12:08.570 --> 02:12:10.300
<v Speaker 2>Like smell like a hawk.</v>

5180
02:12:10.340 --> 02:12:11.173
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

5181
02:12:12.740 --> 02:12:13.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to have this conversation.</v>

5182
02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Serina fine.</v>

02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:23.000
<v Speaker 2>he might just be awesome.</v>

5185
02:12:24.220 --> 02:12:25.053
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

5186
02:12:26.590 --> 02:12:28.190
<v Speaker 2>My stomach is so full,</v>

5187
02:12:28.430 --> 02:12:31.140
<v Speaker 2>so long to buy gold.</v>

5188
02:12:32.540 --> 02:12:33.373
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

5189
02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:37.070
<v Speaker 2>How about how much you want that tennis tournament at nine,</v>

5199
02:12:49.640 --> 02:12:50.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh she doesn't need the money.</v>

5200
02:12:50.871 --> 02:12:51.920
<v Speaker 2>She's rich as shit.</v>

5201
02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:52.460
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

5202
02:12:52.460 --> 02:12:54.020
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she just likes nice guys.</v>

5203
02:12:54.021 --> 02:12:55.040
<v Speaker 2>He's a really smart dude.</v>

5204
02:12:55.041 --> 02:12:55.850
<v Speaker 2>He's white guys.</v>

5205
02:12:55.850 --> 02:12:56.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5206
02:12:56.590 --> 02:12:56.930
<v Speaker 2>Interest.</v>

5207
02:12:56.930 --> 02:12:57.490
<v Speaker 2>He divided.</v>

5208
02:12:57.490 --> 02:12:59.450
<v Speaker 2>She dated to Lavonne Arrington for a little while.</v>

5209
02:12:59.510 --> 02:12:59.841
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5210
02:12:59.841 --> 02:13:00.980
<v Speaker 2>How does this fight play out?</v>

5211
02:13:01.310 --> 02:13:01.921
<v Speaker 2>There's glow over.</v>

5212
02:13:01.921 --> 02:13:02.720
<v Speaker 2>Have anything left.</v>

5213
02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:03.021
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5214
02:13:03.021 --> 02:13:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Glover knocked out Rashad,</v>

5215
02:13:04.431 --> 02:13:07.750
<v Speaker 2>but Glover's got a bum shoulder man and he was having a hard time with his</v>

5216
02:13:07.751 --> 02:13:10.310
<v Speaker 2>shoulder and his last fight against Jared cannoneer.</v>

5217
02:13:10.370 --> 02:13:11.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5218
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:12.200
<v Speaker 2>And he had a hard time in training.</v>

5219
02:13:12.290 --> 02:13:13.440
<v Speaker 2>If Alex done it.</v>

5220
02:13:13.441 --> 02:13:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Gus Finn had his on right.</v>

5221
02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:16.640
<v Speaker 2>He's to me,</v>

5222
02:13:16.641 --> 02:13:18.200
<v Speaker 2>he's the best light heavyweight in the world.</v>

5223
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:19.040
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

5224
02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:19.370
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

5225
02:13:19.370 --> 02:13:21.090
<v Speaker 2>But DC beat him and Jon Jones,</v>

5226
02:13:21.410 --> 02:13:22.310
<v Speaker 2>I think he beat John.</v>

5227
02:13:22.370 --> 02:13:23.720
<v Speaker 2>I think he beat DC in that flight.</v>

5228
02:13:23.870 --> 02:13:24.111
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5229
02:13:24.111 --> 02:13:24.771
<v Speaker 2>he's the best light.</v>

5230
02:13:24.771 --> 02:13:27.050
<v Speaker 2>Every weight in the world now that rumbles retired.</v>

5231
02:13:27.650 --> 02:13:29.660
<v Speaker 2>You're saying fight.</v>

5232
02:13:29.661 --> 02:13:30.590
<v Speaker 2>He got headbutted.</v>

5233
02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:31.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5234
02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:33.870
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of asterisks to me talent wise,</v>

5235
02:13:34.020 --> 02:13:34.480
<v Speaker 2>if his,</v>

5236
02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:35.940
<v Speaker 2>if his mind's on right,</v>

5237
02:13:36.210 --> 02:13:38.280
<v Speaker 2>like remember this fight at one 65 with John,</v>

5238
02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:41.040
<v Speaker 2>but it's two heads colliding.</v>

5239
02:13:41.041 --> 02:13:42.420
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you're hitting him with a weapon.</v>

5240
02:13:42.450 --> 02:13:44.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm say it's a bit of a freak accident.</v>

5241
02:13:44.780 --> 02:13:45.720
<v Speaker 2>They fight again.</v>

5242
02:13:45.750 --> 02:13:47.040
<v Speaker 2>I bet that fight goes different.</v>

5243
02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:48.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you'd wind machine goes debride,</v>

5244
02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:49.590
<v Speaker 2>especially now.</v>

5245
02:13:49.590 --> 02:13:49.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5246
02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:52.950
<v Speaker 2>You don't think they have the Johnson that showed up a fight DC would it be,</v>

5247
02:13:52.980 --> 02:13:53.813
<v Speaker 2>would be.</v>

5248
02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:55.610
<v Speaker 2>I think he was on his way out and that flight.</v>

5249
02:13:55.620 --> 02:13:56.400
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying,</v>

5250
02:13:56.400 --> 02:13:56.941
<v Speaker 2>that fight,</v>

5251
02:13:56.941 --> 02:13:57.680
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>

5252
02:13:57.680 --> 02:14:00.450
<v Speaker 2>it seemed to me like he really just did not want to fight anymore in that.</v>

5253
02:14:00.451 --> 02:14:01.260
<v Speaker 2>That's all I'm saying.</v>

5254
02:14:01.260 --> 02:14:02.780
<v Speaker 2>Like when he started clinching with DC,</v>

5255
02:14:02.781 --> 02:14:03.121
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

5256
02:14:03.121 --> 02:14:04.230
<v Speaker 2>what is happening?</v>

5257
02:14:04.610 --> 02:14:04.711
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5258
02:14:04.711 --> 02:14:05.341
<v Speaker 2>you can take down.</v>

5259
02:14:05.341 --> 02:14:07.200
<v Speaker 2>The Olympiads already had it in his mind.</v>

5260
02:14:07.201 --> 02:14:07.890
<v Speaker 2>It was over.</v>

5261
02:14:07.890 --> 02:14:09.330
<v Speaker 2>He told everyone weeks before.</v>

5262
02:14:09.750 --> 02:14:10.471
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

5263
02:14:10.471 --> 02:14:11.091
<v Speaker 2>What was camp at?</v>

5264
02:14:11.091 --> 02:14:11.401
<v Speaker 2>Family.</v>

5265
02:14:11.401 --> 02:14:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I was hearing that he was barely trained for that fight.</v>

5266
02:14:13.470 --> 02:14:15.930
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was hearing and I thought it was bullshit.</v>

5267
02:14:15.931 --> 02:14:16.261
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

5268
02:14:16.261 --> 02:14:16.771
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>

5269
02:14:16.771 --> 02:14:20.100
<v Speaker 2>he's fighting for the title and I was hearing all kinds of shit.</v>

5270
02:14:20.101 --> 02:14:21.900
<v Speaker 2>Like he came into training four weeks out,</v>

5271
02:14:22.110 --> 02:14:23.550
<v Speaker 2>so I get it.</v>

5272
02:14:23.551 --> 02:14:24.390
<v Speaker 2>But if you're one foot in,</v>

5273
02:14:24.391 --> 02:14:24.931
<v Speaker 2>one foot out,</v>

5274
02:14:24.931 --> 02:14:25.141
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

5275
02:14:25.141 --> 02:14:26.280
<v Speaker 2>I might as well get this money.</v>

5276
02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:29.700
<v Speaker 2>Just try and wrestle because then you make how much thing you made in that fine</v>

5277
02:14:30.270 --> 02:14:35.270
<v Speaker 2>500,000 so I'm Glover is a guy that if he didn't have those six years outside of</v>

5278
02:14:38.311 --> 02:14:38.881
<v Speaker 2>the UFC,</v>

5279
02:14:38.881 --> 02:14:40.200
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it could've been a champ.</v>

5280
02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:41.880
<v Speaker 2>Not with Jon Jones at the helm.</v>

5281
02:14:41.940 --> 02:14:42.121
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5282
02:14:42.121 --> 02:14:43.140
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't have been a champion.</v>

5283
02:14:43.141 --> 02:14:44.010
<v Speaker 2>John John's at the helm.</v>

5284
02:14:44.220 --> 02:14:45.630
<v Speaker 2>It would have been before Jon Jones,</v>

5285
02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:47.280
<v Speaker 2>who was before John Shogun.</v>

5286
02:14:47.310 --> 02:14:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5287
02:14:47.550 --> 02:14:48.030
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

5288
02:14:48.030 --> 02:14:48.630
<v Speaker 2>It's fair.</v>

5289
02:14:48.630 --> 02:14:50.100
<v Speaker 2>He could have probably got a chance.</v>

5290
02:14:50.130 --> 02:14:50.963
<v Speaker 2>He had a chance.</v>

5291
02:14:51.020 --> 02:14:52.480
<v Speaker 2>He just got right.</v>

5292
02:14:52.570 --> 02:14:52.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5293
02:14:52.730 --> 02:14:55.380
<v Speaker 2>It was the visa issue for six fucking years.</v>

5294
02:14:55.530 --> 02:14:56.730
<v Speaker 2>When he was in his prime.</v>

5295
02:14:57.240 --> 02:14:58.260
<v Speaker 2>He was one guy,</v>

5296
02:14:58.261 --> 02:14:59.970
<v Speaker 2>like when he destroyed.</v>

5297
02:14:59.971 --> 02:15:04.971
<v Speaker 2>So could you in the WEC back when the WBC was in northern California in the</v>

5298
02:15:05.491 --> 02:15:05.941
<v Speaker 2>middle of nowhere.</v>

5299
02:15:05.941 --> 02:15:06.480
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>

5300
02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:06.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5301
02:15:06.661 --> 02:15:09.690
<v Speaker 2>With Reed was running that read his love for you to just love read.</v>

5302
02:15:09.690 --> 02:15:10.523
<v Speaker 2>He's great guy.</v>

5303
02:15:10.770 --> 02:15:11.790
<v Speaker 2>He's still with the EOC.</v>

5304
02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:12.481
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

5305
02:15:12.481 --> 02:15:13.314
<v Speaker 2>I love that guy.</v>

5306
02:15:13.350 --> 02:15:15.210
<v Speaker 2>But when Glover back in those days,</v>

5307
02:15:15.211 --> 02:15:16.680
<v Speaker 2>Glover was a fucking destroyer,</v>

5308
02:15:16.770 --> 02:15:18.270
<v Speaker 2>like a God damn destroyer.</v>

5309
02:15:18.271 --> 02:15:19.620
<v Speaker 2>It was like the Brazilian boogey man.</v>

5310
02:15:19.650 --> 02:15:20.131
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was like,</v>

5314
02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:26.160
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to figure out as visa and then chuck Ladell signed off on them</v>

5315
02:15:26.161 --> 02:15:28.830
<v Speaker 2>and have them in signed off and then by the time he got there,</v>

5326
02:15:48.010 --> 02:15:49.200
<v Speaker 2>I should have beat in Russia.</v>

02:15:54.510 --> 02:15:56.610
<v Speaker 2>he tried to protest like you should have protest.</v>

5337
02:15:56.611 --> 02:16:01.200
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you got on a plane and went to Russia protested anywhere else.</v>

5338
02:16:01.201 --> 02:16:02.340
<v Speaker 2>He won that fight kid.</v>

5339
02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:02.970
<v Speaker 2>It's true,</v>

5340
02:16:02.970 --> 02:16:03.240
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5341
02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:05.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean by the new scoring he wanted in a big way.</v>

5342
02:16:05.590 --> 02:16:06.150
<v Speaker 2>Easily.</v>

5343
02:16:06.150 --> 02:16:06.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5344
02:16:06.570 --> 02:16:07.403
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

5345
02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:08.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean for Fader,</v>

5346
02:16:08.790 --> 02:16:09.623
<v Speaker 2>never really heard him.</v>

5347
02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

5348
02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:10.850
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5349
02:16:10.850 --> 02:16:14.220
<v Speaker 2>but he heard the shit out of fate or he had a paid or queer straight would have</v>

5350
02:16:14.221 --> 02:16:15.120
<v Speaker 2>stopped that fight.</v>

5351
02:16:15.121 --> 02:16:15.960
<v Speaker 2>In America.</v>

5352
02:16:15.961 --> 02:16:16.770
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times,</v>

5353
02:16:16.770 --> 02:16:19.620
<v Speaker 2>especially in New York though fade or took a term where all the men were Marin</v>

5354
02:16:19.621 --> 02:16:20.454
<v Speaker 2>dresses,</v>

5355
02:16:21.260 --> 02:16:22.860
<v Speaker 2>those queer street.</v>

5356
02:16:23.670 --> 02:16:25.240
<v Speaker 2>What do you think happened with fatal or Mitch [inaudible]?</v>

5357
02:16:25.530 --> 02:16:27.450
<v Speaker 2>Mitch reone easily could knock 'em out.</v>

5358
02:16:27.750 --> 02:16:28.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5359
02:16:28.410 --> 02:16:28.920
<v Speaker 2>early on.</v>

5360
02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:30.070
<v Speaker 2>I just think that fate</v>

5361
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:33.490
<v Speaker 1>or is still fade or in bursts,</v>

5362
02:16:33.670 --> 02:16:35.740
<v Speaker 1>but I just think if you look at the Maldonado fight,</v>

5363
02:16:35.950 --> 02:16:36.220
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

5364
02:16:36.220 --> 02:16:38.290
<v Speaker 1>you're not talking about fate or is private paid.</v>

5365
02:16:38.291 --> 02:16:39.340
<v Speaker 1>One is prime kills,</v>

5366
02:16:39.341 --> 02:16:40.174
<v Speaker 1>mitre own.</v>

5367
02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:41.081
<v Speaker 1>You go back to fade,</v>

5368
02:16:41.081 --> 02:16:42.640
<v Speaker 1>orange pride and the pride days,</v>

5369
02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:43.990
<v Speaker 1>but mitre on his way,</v>

5370
02:16:43.991 --> 02:16:48.490
<v Speaker 1>closer to his prime then fade or is Mitch and Mitch reone has a Chin like a</v>

5371
02:16:48.491 --> 02:16:50.000
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker still Roy.</v>

5372
02:16:50.001 --> 02:16:50.834
<v Speaker 1>He knocked him out.</v>

5373
02:16:51.030 --> 02:16:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>

5374
02:16:51.810 --> 02:16:52.451
<v Speaker 1>Tki owed him.</v>

5375
02:16:52.451 --> 02:16:53.560
<v Speaker 1>He didn't knock him flatland,</v>

5376
02:16:54.250 --> 02:16:54.790
<v Speaker 1>flatland,</v>

5377
02:16:54.790 --> 02:16:57.540
<v Speaker 1>hit him with a hammer and dropped and dropped and then I'm like,</v>

5378
02:16:57.880 --> 02:16:58.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5379
02:16:58.151 --> 02:16:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda style or something like that.</v>

5380
02:16:59.321 --> 02:17:02.320
<v Speaker 1>I like Mark Kahn was only a couple of punches though.</v>

5381
02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5382
02:17:02.680 --> 02:17:04.590
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just saying he didn't like flat flat line.</v>

5383
02:17:04.591 --> 02:17:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah but we,</v>

5384
02:17:05.380 --> 02:17:09.220
<v Speaker 1>we both agree he could take it and mitre on is a way better athlete Mitro and is</v>

5385
02:17:09.221 --> 02:17:10.120
<v Speaker 1>fastened his feet.</v>

5386
02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:11.680
<v Speaker 1>If Mitre on fight smart,</v>

5387
02:17:11.710 --> 02:17:13.000
<v Speaker 1>I think he can win that fight.</v>

<v Speaker 2>his teeth out.</v>

5476
02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:31.000
<v Speaker 2>He knocked his fucking sold out.</v>

5477
02:19:31.010 --> 02:19:32.510
<v Speaker 2>His soul had to come back down.</v>

5478
02:19:32.630 --> 02:19:34.970
<v Speaker 2>Gravity had to put his soul back down.</v>

02:25:50.280 --> 02:25:50.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5741
02:25:50.660 --> 02:25:50.990
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah,</v>

5742
02:25:50.990 --> 02:25:54.250
<v Speaker 2>tell him I may got crushed with them and then the MMA guy I had to go into</v>

5743
02:25:54.251 --> 02:25:58.720
<v Speaker 2>hiding because apparently people in China want to kill him because it's like a</v>

5744
02:25:58.721 --> 02:26:00.980
<v Speaker 2>disgrace to the Chinese martial arts.</v>

5745
02:26:00.981 --> 02:26:01.990
<v Speaker 2>So it's not a march.</v>

5746
02:26:01.991 --> 02:26:03.970
<v Speaker 2>It's not part of that right hand be it's their fault.</v>

5747
02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5748
02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:07.330
<v Speaker 2>that's a beautiful upper cut.</v>

5749
02:26:08.060 --> 02:26:09.850
<v Speaker 2>So long you get out too.</v>

5750
02:26:09.851 --> 02:26:11.140
<v Speaker 2>It's a nice open man.</v>

5751
02:26:12.110 --> 02:26:12.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5752
02:26:12.620 --> 02:26:14.570
<v Speaker 2>Gustafson looking slick dude.</v>

5753
02:26:14.571 --> 02:26:16.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm really champ.</v>

5754
02:26:16.731 --> 02:26:17.331
<v Speaker 2>Him and John,</v>

5755
02:26:17.331 --> 02:26:17.541
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

5756
02:26:17.541 --> 02:26:18.680
<v Speaker 2>that's the fucking fight.</v>

5757
02:26:18.860 --> 02:26:19.693
<v Speaker 2>It might be</v>

5758
02:26:20.660 --> 02:26:21.201
<v Speaker 2>Muy Bien.</v>

5759
02:26:21.201 --> 02:26:22.940
<v Speaker 2>Well now that rumbles out of the picture,</v>

5760
02:26:22.941 --> 02:26:23.571
<v Speaker 2>I mean Gustafson,</v>

5761
02:26:23.571 --> 02:26:24.051
<v Speaker 2>you got to remember,</v>

5762
02:26:24.051 --> 02:26:26.930
<v Speaker 2>did rock out Jimmy marijuana as a right hand over the top.</v>

5763
02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:28.220
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how they handle that now.</v>

5764
02:26:28.221 --> 02:26:29.180
<v Speaker 2>They've been training together.</v>

5765
02:26:29.181 --> 02:26:31.180
<v Speaker 2>You know Gus Gus January beat Manoa.</v>

5766
02:26:31.220 --> 02:26:31.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5767
02:26:31.401 --> 02:26:31.941
<v Speaker 2>he knocked him out.</v>

5768
02:26:31.941 --> 02:26:34.880
<v Speaker 2>But I wonder how they handled that because if man was still in the mix,</v>

5769
02:26:34.910 --> 02:26:37.160
<v Speaker 2>if they do eventually have to cross paths again,</v>

5770
02:26:37.340 --> 02:26:38.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to see that again.</v>

5771
02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:38.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5772
02:26:38.730 --> 02:26:41.990
<v Speaker 2>it's so thin and they have to,</v>

5773
02:26:42.020 --> 02:26:43.010
<v Speaker 2>they have to fight again.</v>

5774
02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:45.620
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like flyweight like who the fuck is there?</v>

5775
02:26:45.650 --> 02:26:45.891
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5776
02:26:45.891 --> 02:26:46.071
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

5777
02:26:46.071 --> 02:26:49.460
<v Speaker 2>you look at this running away the stone and then stop.</v>

5778
02:26:49.490 --> 02:26:49.631
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5779
02:26:49.631 --> 02:26:52.500
<v Speaker 2>he clipped him with that opera cut again again with the upper cut,</v>

5780
02:26:53.060 --> 02:26:53.570
<v Speaker 2>left hook.</v>

5781
02:26:53.570 --> 02:26:55.010
<v Speaker 2>Get out of there and then he'd go,</v>

5782
02:26:56.250 --> 02:26:57.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm not mad at this tactic.</v>

5783
02:26:57.470 --> 02:27:00.670
<v Speaker 2>Clover swinging for the fences to backache.</v>

5784
02:27:00.730 --> 02:27:02.450
<v Speaker 2>We've got five rounds of this boys.</v>

5785
02:27:02.510 --> 02:27:03.560
<v Speaker 2>I love this fight,</v>

5786
02:27:03.561 --> 02:27:04.310

5789
02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:08.360
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to see Gus and John Too.</v>

5790
02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:09.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I'm saying.</v>

5791
02:27:09.980 --> 02:27:11.780
<v Speaker 2>Dumb shit that everybody listen again.</v>

02:27:14.300 --> 02:27:15.410
<v Speaker 2>He's still young man.</v>

5795
02:27:15.440 --> 02:27:16.910
<v Speaker 2>A lot of fight left Joe.</v>

5813
02:27:43.010 --> 02:27:46.140
<v Speaker 2>It's got to get inside of that reading comprehension.</v>

5814
02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:49.580
<v Speaker 2>Not Wonder if blowers going to time that with an overhand right.</v>

02:32:57.010 --> 02:32:58.950
<v Speaker 2>but you look at his fight with Jon Jones fight.</v>

6030
02:32:59.010 --> 02:32:59.251
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

6031
02:32:59.251 --> 02:33:01.830
<v Speaker 2>that's the greatest light heavyweight fight of all time.</v>

6032
02:33:02.130 --> 02:33:04.470
<v Speaker 2>I was fucking so thrilled with that fight,</v>

6033
02:33:04.471 --> 02:33:04.770
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6034
02:33:04.770 --> 02:33:05.221
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

6035
02:33:05.221 --> 02:33:07.380
<v Speaker 2>Because there's finally John John's kind of met his match.</v>

6036
02:33:07.530 --> 02:33:10.200
<v Speaker 2>Granted John Probably had two hours of sleep and do a bunch of lines of coke,</v>

6037
02:33:10.201 --> 02:33:11.034
<v Speaker 2>so who knows now,</v>

6038
02:33:11.280 --> 02:33:13.130
<v Speaker 2>but still at the time it was great.</v>

6039
02:33:13.230 --> 02:33:16.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't like this funding away because clover's going to time this shit man.</v>

6040
02:33:16.500 --> 02:33:17.070
<v Speaker 2>You think?</v>

6041
02:33:17.070 --> 02:33:19.590
<v Speaker 2>I think so and worries me all your years of fighting.</v>

6042
02:33:19.591 --> 02:33:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen that happen?</v>

6043
02:33:21.120 --> 02:33:21.953
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6044
02:33:21.980 --> 02:33:23.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm Mr. O'Brien</v>

6045
02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:25.950
<v Speaker 2>when Mr over and</v>

6046
02:33:27.840 --> 02:33:28.591
<v Speaker 2>I don't teach my,</v>

6047
02:33:28.591 --> 02:33:31.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't teach my students to do all the time.</v>

6048
02:33:31.420 --> 02:33:33.750
<v Speaker 2>So let me ask you guys this while we're watching the fight,</v>

6049
02:33:33.780 --> 02:33:36.600
<v Speaker 2>what's the best set up to do a fight companion?</v>

6050
02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:40.380
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm building a fight companions studio in the next place.</v>

6051
02:33:40.410 --> 02:33:44.220
<v Speaker 2>I feel like chef punching bags that we can hit out of frustration or anxiety.</v>

6052
02:33:44.240 --> 02:33:44.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6053
02:33:44.350 --> 02:33:48.810
<v Speaker 2>what I'm thinking is the way we're sitting here across from each other and</v>

6054
02:33:48.811 --> 02:33:51.300
<v Speaker 2>watching the fights is not totally ideal.</v>

6055
02:33:51.480 --> 02:33:52.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking round table.</v>

6056
02:33:53.220 --> 02:33:54.720
<v Speaker 2>More like a semi circle.</v>

6057
02:33:54.721 --> 02:33:55.590
<v Speaker 2>Like a half moon.</v>

6058
02:33:55.810 --> 02:33:56.643
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>

6059
02:33:56.700 --> 02:33:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6060
02:33:56.970 --> 02:33:58.320
<v Speaker 2>Almost like an analyst desk.</v>

6061
02:33:58.380 --> 02:33:58.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6062
02:33:58.921 --> 02:34:00.510
<v Speaker 2>And then the t v there.</v>

6063
02:34:00.630 --> 02:34:02.300
<v Speaker 2>But this way we're all be like,</v>

6064
02:34:02.400 --> 02:34:02.510
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

6065
02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:03.343
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

6066
02:34:03.890 --> 02:34:04.670
<v Speaker 2>That's what I've been thinking.</v>

6067
02:34:04.670 --> 02:34:05.503
<v Speaker 2>A great idea.</v>

6068
02:34:06.210 --> 02:34:07.380
<v Speaker 2>But we should have a desk,</v>

6069
02:34:07.381 --> 02:34:07.591
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6070
02:34:07.591 --> 02:34:10.110
<v Speaker 2>It's good to have a desk and drink some shirts and stuff.</v>

6071
02:34:11.370 --> 02:34:15.090
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to set up a second thing just in front of a big ass TV and I'm</v>

6072
02:34:15.091 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Speaker 2>thinking of putting a big ass TV like even</v>

6073
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:18.731
<v Speaker 1>bigger than this month.</v>

6074
02:34:18.731 --> 02:34:19.870
<v Speaker 1>I can protect that idea.</v>

6075
02:34:19.940 --> 02:34:20.121
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6076
02:34:20.121 --> 02:34:20.231
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

6077
02:34:20.231 --> 02:34:20.471
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

6078
02:34:20.471 --> 02:34:20.591
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

6079
02:34:20.591 --> 02:34:20.741
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

6080
02:34:20.741 --> 02:34:22.720
<v Speaker 1>Like 110 inch LCD.</v>

6081
02:34:23.010 --> 02:34:23.843
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

6082
02:34:24.560 --> 02:34:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Look at this Combo.</v>

6083
02:34:25.541 --> 02:34:26.201
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

6084
02:34:26.201 --> 02:34:27.160
<v Speaker 1>It could also be,</v>

6085
02:34:27.190 --> 02:34:28.540
<v Speaker 1>we can ask a big couch.</v>

6086
02:34:28.541 --> 02:34:29.040
<v Speaker 1>I want him.</v>

6087
02:34:29.040 --> 02:34:30.100
<v Speaker 1>Would that make us too tired?</v>

6088
02:34:30.240 --> 02:34:31.870
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>

6089
02:34:31.871 --> 02:34:33.760
<v Speaker 1>These chairs are the shit,</v>

6090
02:34:34.300 --> 02:34:34.961
<v Speaker 1>these chairs,</v>

6091
02:34:34.961 --> 02:34:35.261
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

6092
02:34:35.261 --> 02:34:35.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6093
02:34:35.650 --> 02:34:37.140
<v Speaker 1>these are people keep asking.</v>

6094
02:34:37.160 --> 02:34:38.410
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell there's not a sponsor.</v>

6095
02:34:38.411 --> 02:34:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Ergo depot sent me these.</v>

6096
02:34:39.881 --> 02:34:41.030
<v Speaker 1>They're from there.</v>

6097
02:34:41.110 --> 02:34:42.790
<v Speaker 1>They're called capisce goes in.</v>

6098
02:34:42.791 --> 02:34:44.530
<v Speaker 1>There are Ergonomic Tommy buttons.</v>

6099
02:34:44.531 --> 02:34:46.790
<v Speaker 1>It has these now Thompson or has these in his podcasts.</v>

6100
02:34:47.450 --> 02:34:48.283
<v Speaker 1>Ergo what?</v>

6101
02:34:48.470 --> 02:34:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Depo chairs at our second,</v>

6102
02:34:50.380 --> 02:34:52.600
<v Speaker 1>e r g o t depot.com.</v>

6103
02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:55.900
<v Speaker 1>And these fucking chairs are excellent because they're comfortable,</v>

6104
02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:57.450
<v Speaker 1>but they're also ergonomics.</v>

6105
02:34:57.451 --> 02:35:01.090
<v Speaker 1>So like you sit up straight because you sit up straight after the end of the</v>

6106
02:35:01.091 --> 02:35:01.301
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

6107
02:35:01.301 --> 02:35:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Your back doesn't fucking matter at all because you don't do a couch for the no,</v>

6108
02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:05.800
<v Speaker 1>no couches.</v>

6109
02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:08.200
<v Speaker 1>I think where these chairs are it for podcasts.</v>

6110
02:35:08.201 --> 02:35:11.380
<v Speaker 1>I think I found the holy grail of podcast chairs.</v>

6111
02:35:11.460 --> 02:35:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

6112
02:35:11.770 --> 02:35:12.603
<v Speaker 1>They're amazing.</v>

6113
02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:13.031
<v Speaker 1>The question.</v>

6114
02:35:13.031 --> 02:35:16.570
<v Speaker 1>So the question was what kind of set up she would have like side tables and I</v>

6115
02:35:16.571 --> 02:35:16.751
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

6116
02:35:16.751 --> 02:35:17.021
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

6117
02:35:17.021 --> 02:35:17.854
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

6118
02:35:17.860 --> 02:35:19.980
<v Speaker 1>I think a table in front of us is the way I sent,</v>

6119
02:35:20.270 --> 02:35:22.900
<v Speaker 1>because Brian's always bringing wine and cheese and shit.</v>

6120
02:35:22.940 --> 02:35:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

6121
02:35:23.620 --> 02:35:23.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6122
02:35:23.801 --> 02:35:27.220
<v Speaker 1>We're always going to want to slide things down to each other and this stuff.</v>

6123
02:35:27.250 --> 02:35:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Then you should have like give just a area.</v>

6124
02:35:29.040 --> 02:35:29.770
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a,</v>

6125
02:35:29.770 --> 02:35:29.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6126
02:35:29.930 --> 02:35:31.540
<v Speaker 1>like an old school telephone booth.</v>

6127
02:35:31.550 --> 02:35:33.310
<v Speaker 1>It's called conspiracy theories.</v>

6128
02:35:33.340 --> 02:35:34.960
<v Speaker 1>And then fucking Eddie goes in there.</v>

6129
02:35:35.050 --> 02:35:40.050
<v Speaker 1>Now what I'm going to have is a second thing with experts on Skype on standby</v>

6130
02:35:40.630 --> 02:35:41.463
<v Speaker 1>waiting.</v>

6131
02:35:41.590 --> 02:35:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Every time Eddie says something crazy,</v>

6132
02:35:43.121 --> 02:35:45.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to press a button and boom,</v>

6133
02:35:45.340 --> 02:35:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Neil degrasse Tyson,</v>

6134
02:35:46.241 --> 02:35:47.074
<v Speaker 1>you're on the line.</v>

6135
02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:49.420
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I think we should have?</v>

6136
02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Should have a grill and somebody should be cooking.</v>

6137
02:35:52.010 --> 02:35:52.843
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

6138
02:35:53.590 --> 02:35:54.423
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

6139
02:35:54.550 --> 02:35:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

02:35:56.560 --> 02:35:57.393

6147
02:36:04.510 --> 02:36:05.343
<v Speaker 1>If you have to cover,</v>

6148
02:36:05.550 --> 02:36:07.960
<v Speaker 1>but she might or might get grounded out.</v>

6149
02:36:09.880 --> 02:36:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6150

6154
02:36:20.021 --> 02:36:23.590
<v Speaker 1>which is a huge commercial smoker for the studio.</v>

6155
02:36:23.820 --> 02:36:24.760
<v Speaker 1>You should have asked.</v>

6156
02:36:24.850 --> 02:36:26.140
<v Speaker 1>It should be a cooking show.</v>

6157
02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:27.610
<v Speaker 1>We should have somebody shoot.</v>

6158
02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:28.901
<v Speaker 1>I'm way ahead of you.</v>

6159
02:36:28.901 --> 02:36:30.430
<v Speaker 1>You've been listening to my podcast or something?</v>

6160
02:36:30.490 --> 02:36:30.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

<v Speaker 1>We talked about it.</v>

6167
02:36:35.921 --> 02:36:37.420
<v Speaker 1>We're going to sit down and eat dinner.</v>

6168
02:36:37.660 --> 02:36:38.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to cook it on the show,</v>

6169
02:36:38.860 --> 02:36:39.250

6517
02:44:26.590 --> 02:44:29.630
<v Speaker 2>I looked at a picture of me with 10 years ago when I was 40 you'll always</v>

6518
02:44:29.640 --> 02:44:30.180
<v Speaker 2>handsome.</v>

02:44:33.060 --> 02:44:33.490
<v Speaker 2>David.</v>

6523
02:44:33.490 --> 02:44:33.791
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

6524
02:44:33.791 --> 02:44:34.410
<v Speaker 2>Books.</v>

6525
02:44:34.410 --> 02:44:34.690
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

6526
02:44:34.690 --> 02:44:36.040
<v Speaker 2>that's what I've been looking for on a Sunday.</v>

6527
02:44:38.860 --> 02:44:39.400
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

6528
02:44:39.400 --> 02:44:39.671
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

6529
02:44:39.671 --> 02:44:41.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm Brian Day and now it's turned into.</v>

6530
02:44:41.731 --> 02:44:42.251
<v Speaker 2>Now it's get,</v>

6531
02:44:42.251 --> 02:44:44.680
<v Speaker 2>at what point in life do you just say we have fuck you money.</v>

6532
02:44:44.681 --> 02:44:47.640
<v Speaker 2>You say fuck you life where you just let your body go into seat,</v>

6533
02:44:47.650 --> 02:44:48.483
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

6534
02:44:48.660 --> 02:44:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Cause I'm sure a lot of people are doing things,</v>

6535
02:44:50.651 --> 02:44:52.720
<v Speaker 2>but when you were in the public eye like,</v>

6536
02:44:52.750 --> 02:44:52.931
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

6537
02:44:52.931 --> 02:44:54.280
<v Speaker 2>he clipped him with a right hand over the top.</v>

6538
02:44:54.460 --> 02:44:55.480
<v Speaker 2>When you're in the public eye,</v>

6539
02:44:55.481 --> 02:44:56.500
<v Speaker 2>like a David Letterman,</v>

6540
02:44:56.501 --> 02:44:57.580
<v Speaker 2>like most of your life,</v>

6541
02:44:57.581 --> 02:45:00.700
<v Speaker 2>and then you decided you decided to not do that anymore,</v>

6542
02:45:01.150 --> 02:45:03.160
<v Speaker 2>then it becomes kind of interesting.</v>

6543
02:45:03.180 --> 02:45:04.013
<v Speaker 2>You can relax.</v>

6544
02:45:04.450 --> 02:45:06.990
<v Speaker 2>You have to be disappointed by your look and make them look.</v>

6545
02:45:06.991 --> 02:45:08.080
<v Speaker 2>It's that 10 years ago.</v>

6546
02:45:08.081 --> 02:45:09.940
<v Speaker 2>Look at that Cutie Pie or similar,</v>

6547
02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:10.761
<v Speaker 2>I assume not.</v>

6548
02:45:10.761 --> 02:45:11.594
<v Speaker 2>I was so much.</v>

6549
02:45:11.650 --> 02:45:13.360
<v Speaker 2>They look exactly the same on dude.</v>

6550
02:45:13.361 --> 02:45:13.921
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate it.</v>

6551
02:45:13.921 --> 02:45:17.260
<v Speaker 2>The drawback is 30 to 40 that's where you're really dropped off,</v>

6552
02:45:17.560 --> 02:45:19.200
<v Speaker 2>but 40 to 50 if you're maintaining,</v>

6553
02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:20.530
<v Speaker 2>maintaining my,</v>

6554
02:45:20.530 --> 02:45:21.910
<v Speaker 2>seems like you work out more now.</v>

6555
02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:25.000
<v Speaker 2>I do work out every day and it doesn't do much.</v>

6556
02:45:25.050 --> 02:45:26.360
<v Speaker 2>Here's someone's alarm going on like,</v>

6557
02:45:26.370 --> 02:45:27.203

02:45:27.850 --> 02:45:28.031
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6559
02:45:28.031 --> 02:45:28.630
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

6560
02:45:28.630 --> 02:45:29.463
<v Speaker 2>Good ears.</v>

6561
02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:32.050
<v Speaker 2>I think I have bad ears by the way.</v>

6562
02:45:32.410 --> 02:45:33.480
<v Speaker 2>You probably do with age,</v>

6563
02:45:33.590 --> 02:45:34.390
<v Speaker 2>son.</v>

6564
02:45:34.390 --> 02:45:35.010
<v Speaker 2>Get them dig.</v>

6565
02:45:35.010 --> 02:45:37.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm always asking my wife to turn the cell.</v>

6566
02:45:37.020 --> 02:45:37.541
<v Speaker 2>The boxing.</v>

6567
02:45:37.541 --> 02:45:38.020
<v Speaker 2>You do?</v>

6568
02:45:38.020 --> 02:45:38.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6569
02:45:38.270 --> 02:45:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6570
02:45:38.580 --> 02:45:39.100
<v Speaker 2>We'll do it.</v>

6571
02:45:39.100 --> 02:45:40.420
<v Speaker 2>Years of getting boxed in my ears.</v>

6572
02:45:40.421 --> 02:45:41.320
<v Speaker 2>He getting boxed up.</v>

6573
02:45:41.340 --> 02:45:45.540
<v Speaker 2>Borough clover's fucking just go away.</v>

6574
02:45:46.540 --> 02:45:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Game.</v>

6575
02:45:47.060 --> 02:45:48.040
<v Speaker 2>He didn't get the menu.</v>

6576
02:45:48.580 --> 02:45:49.720
<v Speaker 2>The fucking memo.</v>

6577
02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:51.430
<v Speaker 2>Good kick to the body there.</v>

6578
02:45:51.790 --> 02:45:52.623
<v Speaker 2>We're good.</v>

6579
02:45:55.320 --> 02:45:57.070
<v Speaker 2>Lower still looking for that knockout punch,</v>

6580
02:45:57.090 --> 02:45:57.430

<v Speaker 2>always there.</v>

6583
02:45:59.410 --> 02:46:00.400
<v Speaker 2>The scary thing is if,</v>

6584
02:46:00.530 --> 02:46:01.363
<v Speaker 2>oh shit,</v>

6585
02:46:01.420 --> 02:46:03.580
<v Speaker 2>if Alexander slows down a little bit,</v>

6586
02:46:03.650 --> 02:46:04.810
<v Speaker 2>it gets the club was for me.</v>

6587
02:46:05.010 --> 02:46:05.843

02:46:06.220 --> 02:46:07.053

02:46:09.290 --> 02:46:10.810
<v Speaker 2>He needs to stay in the middle of the AUC gun.</v>

6592
02:46:10.950 --> 02:46:12.140
<v Speaker 2>Got Some certain yes.</v>

6594
02:46:14.421 --> 02:46:14.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6595
02:46:14.511 --> 02:46:16.160
<v Speaker 2>It really does like being them at light.</v>

6596
02:46:16.161 --> 02:46:19.130
<v Speaker 2>Heavyweight is so fluid and this movement is excellent.</v>

6597
02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:20.670
<v Speaker 2>It's a big fight for him,</v>

6598
02:46:20.671 --> 02:46:20.870
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6599
02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:21.411
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy.</v>

02:46:21.411 --> 02:46:22.101
<v Speaker 2>For both of them,</v>

6601
02:46:22.101 --> 02:46:24.140
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of career defining to be honest.</v>

6602
02:46:25.010 --> 02:46:26.140
<v Speaker 2>I hate to be good.</v>

6603
02:46:27.170 --> 02:46:28.770
<v Speaker 2>How many can you take of these?</v>

6604
02:46:29.500 --> 02:46:30.333
<v Speaker 2>Strange,</v>

6605

<v Speaker 2>what's going on here?</v>

6606
02:46:31.760 --> 02:46:32.593

02:46:43.490 --> 02:46:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Knowing exactly how good he is.</v>

6614
02:46:45.291 --> 02:46:46.071
<v Speaker 2>Having trained with them.</v>

6615
02:46:46.071 --> 02:46:46.550

6620
02:46:53.691 --> 02:46:54.501
<v Speaker 2>He's very similar to it.</v>

6621
02:46:54.501 --> 02:46:57.980
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'd love to see him in DC fight cause I've trained with and they have</v>

<v Speaker 2>If you guys know what to do,</v>

6661
02:47:54.920 --> 02:47:56.270
<v Speaker 2>it's the inside of my knee,</v>

6663
02:47:57.440 --> 02:47:58.370
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you this.</v>

6664
02:47:58.760 --> 02:48:02.300
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about this UFC training facility?</v>

6665
02:48:02.510 --> 02:48:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Like who's going to go there?</v>

6666
02:48:04.020 --> 02:48:04.853
<v Speaker 2>I was so,</v>

6667
02:48:05.600 --> 02:48:08.030
<v Speaker 2>and they're going to pump Bain like products into his body.</v>

6668
02:48:11.330 --> 02:48:14.360
<v Speaker 2>Fucking in between Brown division in between rounds.</v>

6669
02:48:14.361 --> 02:48:15.440
<v Speaker 2>He steps in a Cryo Chamber,</v>

6670
02:48:15.450 --> 02:48:15.771
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

6671
02:48:15.771 --> 02:48:16.131
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

6672
02:48:16.131 --> 02:48:18.080
<v Speaker 2>but look at Glover and round four.</v>

6673
02:48:18.081 --> 02:48:19.850
<v Speaker 2>After all that punishment keeping his head,</v>

6674
02:48:19.851 --> 02:48:24.851
<v Speaker 2>he looks very fresh that one of the problems with glow is he's so boxing</v>

6675
02:48:24.921 --> 02:48:27.710
<v Speaker 2>oriented in his attack and with a guy like Gustafson,</v>

6676
02:48:27.711 --> 02:48:30.170
<v Speaker 2>he has such a large reach disadvantage.</v>

6677
02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:32.750
<v Speaker 2>So he's constantly moving forward,</v>

6678
02:48:32.751 --> 02:48:33.950
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't throw kicks.</v>

6679
02:48:34.280 --> 02:48:35.113
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

6680
02:48:36.070 --> 02:48:40.310
<v Speaker 2>Or a gusts when stop kick in because he got taken down early on.</v>

6681
02:48:40.311 --> 02:48:40.871
<v Speaker 2>But his kid,</v>

6682
02:48:40.871 --> 02:48:41.810
<v Speaker 2>his kicks too.</v>

6683
02:48:41.811 --> 02:48:43.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't just abandoned it.</v>

6684
02:48:43.370 --> 02:48:45.260
<v Speaker 2>Keeping Away with us for Glover.</v>

6685
02:48:45.740 --> 02:48:48.240
<v Speaker 2>Glover has always got to move into boxing changed.</v>

6760
02:50:35.240 --> 02:50:36.300

6763
02:50:40.030 --> 02:50:40.321

<v Speaker 1>that was brilliant man.</v>

6765
02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant performance.</v>

6766
02:50:43.980 --> 02:50:46.020
<v Speaker 1>When you were saying how glow or just missed the it,</v>

6767
02:50:46.021 --> 02:50:50.730
<v Speaker 1>the it a little bit like that Boston with his wrestling style via brand page.</v>

6768
02:50:50.760 --> 02:50:52.920
<v Speaker 1>He had been champ him first rampage in the prime.</v>

6769
02:50:52.921 --> 02:50:54.510
<v Speaker 1>That's a motherfucking fight.</v>

6770
02:50:54.690 --> 02:50:55.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6771
02:50:55.051 --> 02:50:55.800
<v Speaker 1>he could've won.</v>

6772
02:50:55.800 --> 02:50:56.580
<v Speaker 1>He could have won.</v>

6773
02:50:56.580 --> 02:50:58.290
<v Speaker 1>But you know what's interesting is that he just,</v>

6774
02:50:59.130 --> 02:51:00.750
<v Speaker 1>because he doesn't throw very many kicks,</v>

6775
02:51:00.751 --> 02:51:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean he might throw in 10 kicks,</v>

6776
02:51:02.101 --> 02:51:02.934
<v Speaker 1>that whole fight.</v>

6777
02:51:02.970 --> 02:51:05.580
<v Speaker 1>He's always moving into boxing ranks.</v>

6778
02:51:05.581 --> 02:51:08.340
<v Speaker 1>She's getting chewed up on the way in and it's tough as he is.</v>

6779
02:51:08.610 --> 02:51:10.650
<v Speaker 1>He's still getting tagged over and over and over.</v>

6780
02:51:10.651 --> 02:51:12.720
<v Speaker 1>2017 if you're just boxing,</v>

02:55:51.980 --> 02:55:52.813
<v Speaker 1>He's number one.</v>

6960
02:55:53.210 --> 02:55:54.440
<v Speaker 1>He's number one for sure,</v>

6961
02:55:54.441 --> 02:55:57.920
<v Speaker 1>but that's just because John Jones is on the banned list.</v>

6962
02:55:58.250 --> 02:56:00.940
<v Speaker 1>My boy Vulcan's like to say what happened number one.</v>

6968
02:56:06.860 --> 02:56:08.180
<v Speaker 1>I was in mirror with one punch,</v>

6969
02:56:08.210 --> 02:56:09.230
<v Speaker 1>four clovers giving.</v>

6970
02:56:09.231 --> 02:56:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead and jump back in line behind this UFC training institute.</v>

6971
02:56:13.491 --> 02:56:16.220
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm so confused like what is ending?</v>

6972
02:56:16.240 --> 02:56:17.870
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to do their camp there.</v>

6973
02:56:18.460 --> 02:56:19.200
<v Speaker 1>How could you,</v>

6974
02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:19.620
<v Speaker 1>how?</v>

6975
02:56:19.620 --> 02:56:21.650
<v Speaker 1>How fair would that be if you fight it out?</v>

6976
02:56:21.830 --> 02:56:25.190
<v Speaker 1>Let's say Michael Bisbing doing his camp there and you El Students Camp in</v>

6977
02:56:25.191 --> 02:56:26.210

<v Speaker 1>Jay's arts.</v>

6983
02:56:35.690 --> 02:56:36.501
<v Speaker 1>Don't fuck it.</v>

6984
02:56:36.501 --> 02:56:37.334
<v Speaker 1>She Thought,</v>

6985
02:56:38.120 --> 02:56:38.311
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

6986
02:56:38.311 --> 02:56:38.631

6988
02:56:39.620 --> 02:56:39.951

02:56:41.181 --> 02:56:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Don't forget Jesus and baby Jesus.</v>

02:56:43.730 --> 02:56:44.900
<v Speaker 1>It's open to anybody.</v>

6992
02:56:44.901 --> 02:56:47.930
<v Speaker 1>You can start or end your camp here.</v>

6993
02:56:48.380 --> 02:56:49.940
<v Speaker 1>We have the best training facility.</v>

6994
02:56:51.170 --> 02:56:52.310
<v Speaker 1>It makes no sense.</v>

6995
02:56:53.600 --> 02:56:55.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm just confused as to what they're trying to do with it.</v>

6996
02:56:56.530 --> 02:56:59.270
<v Speaker 1>I just know when I'm in Vegas you fucks.</v>

6997
02:56:59.300 --> 02:57:00.133
<v Speaker 1>You're going to train there.</v>

6998
02:57:00.260 --> 02:57:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

6999
02:57:01.040 --> 02:57:01.880
<v Speaker 1>I bet you're not.</v>

7000
02:57:02.510 --> 02:57:03.260
<v Speaker 1>You don't get it,</v>

7001
02:57:03.260 --> 02:57:04.550
<v Speaker 1>but they won't let you have time.</v>

7002
02:57:04.551 --> 02:57:05.384
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>

7003
02:57:05.790 --> 02:57:06.650
<v Speaker 1>I was going to make</v>

7004
02:57:08.370 --> 02:57:09.230
<v Speaker 1>you a celebrity.</v>

7005
02:57:09.410 --> 02:57:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Not really them.</v>

7006
02:57:10.280 --> 02:57:12.850
<v Speaker 1>If I tell him I called the UFC instead,</v>

7007
02:57:12.860 --> 02:57:13.730
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to get tickets.</v>

7008
02:57:13.980 --> 02:57:14.660
<v Speaker 1>They'd hook it up.</v>

7009
02:57:14.660 --> 02:57:16.310
<v Speaker 1>I explain to them where are they now.</v>

7010
02:57:17.530 --> 02:57:18.790
<v Speaker 1>That's that phase can be tough.</v>

7011
02:57:20.380 --> 02:57:22.630
<v Speaker 1>My feelings are already tight ship.</v>

7012
02:57:22.640 --> 02:57:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Depends on how this,</v>

7013
02:57:23.990 --> 02:57:24.890
<v Speaker 1>this thing,</v>

7014
02:57:24.891 --> 02:57:25.940
<v Speaker 1>this pilot,</v>

7015
02:57:25.941 --> 02:57:27.740
<v Speaker 1>the Goldbergs girls that didn't go.</v>

7016
02:57:27.830 --> 02:57:28.663
<v Speaker 1>You didn't find out?</v>

7017
02:57:28.670 --> 02:57:29.503
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

7018
02:57:29.630 --> 02:57:33.380
<v Speaker 1>you didn't tell me this kind of awkward but the governor's got picked up for two</v>

7019
02:57:33.381 --> 02:57:34.100
<v Speaker 1>more years.</v>

7020
02:57:34.100 --> 02:57:34.491
<v Speaker 1>Either way.</v>

7021
02:57:34.491 --> 02:57:35.390
<v Speaker 1>My Heart's still.</v>

7022
02:57:35.630 --> 02:57:36.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7023
02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:37.640
<v Speaker 1>How often do you want it?</v>

7024
02:57:37.700 --> 02:57:39.020
<v Speaker 1>Like always be almost famous.</v>

7025
02:57:39.021 --> 02:57:42.730
<v Speaker 1>I've realized my partner sells how fucking theaters and now Australia,</v>

7026
02:57:42.760 --> 02:57:43.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7027
02:57:43.110 --> 02:57:44.180
<v Speaker 1>isn't that better though?</v>

7028
02:57:44.390 --> 02:57:46.400
<v Speaker 1>Like it keeps you humble I guess.</v>

7029
02:57:46.530 --> 02:57:49.160
<v Speaker 1>I suppose to a guy like shop was just rocketing up the charts.</v>

7030
02:57:49.161 --> 02:57:51.760
<v Speaker 1>He's eventually going to get a big head tilt.</v>

7031
02:57:55.200 --> 02:57:55.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7032
02:57:55.820 --> 02:57:56.860
<v Speaker 1>and it's also like you,</v>

7033
02:57:56.861 --> 02:58:00.500
<v Speaker 1>you'll have the fuel of being bitter because you are more famous when you guys</v>

7034
02:58:00.501 --> 02:58:02.520
<v Speaker 1>started and then he surpasses,</v>

<v Speaker 1>cars.</v>

7178
03:01:39.970 --> 03:01:42.310
<v Speaker 1>You could actually sell like pen on the car.</v>

7179
03:01:42.311 --> 03:01:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7180
03:01:42.450 --> 03:01:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7181
03:01:42.730 --> 03:01:44.130
<v Speaker 1>My cars are worse investments.</v>

7182
03:01:44.131 --> 03:01:44.241
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

7183
03:01:44.241 --> 03:01:44.410
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

7184
03:01:44.410 --> 03:01:47.740
<v Speaker 1>some of them are bad investments with like my Corvettes worth a lot of money.</v>

7185
03:01:47.741 --> 03:01:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Like those are like old cars you could sell,</v>

7186
03:01:50.800 --> 03:01:51.550
<v Speaker 1>they're worth money.</v>

7187
03:01:51.550 --> 03:01:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Buys made money though.</v>

7188
03:01:52.511 --> 03:01:55.720
<v Speaker 1>You always made more money than most people know more than you right now.</v>

7189
03:01:55.760 --> 03:01:57.970
<v Speaker 1>And most of us as actors and stuff,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I always do a bunch of different things.</v>

7193
03:02:01.391 --> 03:02:06.391
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing I don't like having a boss and I don't like having to count on</v>

7196
03:02:10.061 --> 03:02:12.040
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a fucking disgrace.</v>

7197
03:02:12.370 --> 03:02:13.930
<v Speaker 1>It's a disgrace to the fuck you money.</v>

7198
03:02:13.931 --> 03:02:14.800
<v Speaker 1>If you don't say fuck it,</v>

7199
03:02:14.801 --> 03:02:15.880
<v Speaker 1>you have to get there though.</v>

7200

7213
03:02:30.520 --> 03:02:31.900
<v Speaker 1>That does happen to people too.</v>

7214
03:02:32.140 --> 03:02:34.570
<v Speaker 1>They get that fucking money and then they can't wait to say fuck you.</v>

7215
03:02:34.900 --> 03:02:36.970

7220
03:02:41.711 --> 03:02:42.544
<v Speaker 1>we know people,</v>

7221
03:02:42.560 --> 03:02:45.430
<v Speaker 1>we know because what happens is you've got $6 million in the bank,</v>

7222
03:02:45.431 --> 03:02:46.960
<v Speaker 1>but you start spending $1 million a year.</v>

7223
03:02:46.990 --> 03:02:48.460
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that plenty of times.</v>

7224
03:02:48.640 --> 03:02:49.091
<v Speaker 1>What'd you say?</v>

7226
03:02:53.050 --> 03:02:53.380
<v Speaker 1>million a year.</v>

7227
03:02:53.380 --> 03:02:54.220
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen that.</v>

7228
03:02:54.370 --> 03:02:56.380
<v Speaker 1>So you get six years ago out like a gangster.</v>

03:02:59.110 --> 03:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>my buddy,</v>

7233
03:02:59.740 --> 03:03:04.270
<v Speaker 1>my buddy was making a lot of money and he came and he looked like he'd seen a</v>

7234
03:03:04.271 --> 03:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>ghost and he said,</v>

7235
03:03:05.681 --> 03:03:10.270
<v Speaker 1>my business manager just told me I have to make $900,000 a year just to break</v>

7236
03:03:10.271 --> 03:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>even.</v>

7237
03:03:10.780 --> 03:03:11.440
<v Speaker 1>And I went,</v>

7238
03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:12.620
<v Speaker 1>what do you spam dances?</v>

7239
03:03:12.990 --> 03:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

7240
03:03:13.300 --> 03:03:13.631
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

7241
03:03:13.631 --> 03:03:14.640
<v Speaker 1>what are you spending money on?</v>

7242
03:03:14.690 --> 03:03:15.523
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

7243
03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:16.751
<v Speaker 1>just stuff.</v>

7244
03:03:16.751 --> 03:03:17.290
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

7245
03:03:17.290 --> 03:03:17.501
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

7246
03:03:17.501 --> 03:03:17.831
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

7247
03:03:17.831 --> 03:03:18.730
<v Speaker 1>I got two nannies,</v>

7248
03:03:18.731 --> 03:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>I got three cars,</v>

7249
03:03:19.871 --> 03:03:20.770
<v Speaker 1>I got a big house,</v>

7250
03:03:20.771 --> 03:03:21.461
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know,</v>

7251
03:03:21.461 --> 03:03:22.294
<v Speaker 1>just stuff.</v>

7252
03:03:22.540 --> 03:03:23.680
<v Speaker 1>And he couldn't really figure out,</v>

7253
03:03:23.681 --> 03:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7254
03:03:23.920 --> 03:03:26.410
<v Speaker 1>until his business manager went line for line and was like,</v>

7255
03:03:26.411 --> 03:03:27.460
<v Speaker 1>this is what you're spending.</v>

7256
03:03:28.030 --> 03:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>But you know what happens too when you start making money,</v>

7257
03:03:31.690 --> 03:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>you start hanging out with other people that are making money.</v>

7258
03:03:34.540 --> 03:03:34.901
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7259
03:03:34.901 --> 03:03:38.440
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to this pro football player who was telling me that he was saying</v>

7260
03:03:38.441 --> 03:03:42.160
<v Speaker 1>that basically what happens is you're around all these other dudes and camp and</v>

7261
03:03:42.161 --> 03:03:45.460
<v Speaker 1>the dude shows up with a roles and this guy's got a Bentley in,</v>

7262
03:03:45.461 --> 03:03:47.840
<v Speaker 1>this guy's got a giant gold chain and,</v>

7263
03:03:48.030 --> 03:03:48.551
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>

7264
03:03:48.551 --> 03:03:50.560
<v Speaker 1>you start spending money just to keep up with these people.</v>

7265
03:03:50.890 --> 03:03:52.660
<v Speaker 1>Well Kevin Hart has a funny bit about that,</v>

7266
03:03:52.661 --> 03:03:57.350
<v Speaker 1>where he's hanging out with Dwayne Wade and those guys and they were talking and</v>

7267
03:03:57.351 --> 03:03:57.741
<v Speaker 1>Kevin's like,</v>

7268
03:03:57.741 --> 03:03:58.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm making money and doing what?</v>

7269
03:03:58.851 --> 03:03:59.121
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

7270
03:03:59.121 --> 03:03:59.960
<v Speaker 1>you should buy a boat.</v>

7271
03:04:00.470 --> 03:04:01.130
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

7272
03:04:01.130 --> 03:04:01.963
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

7273
03:04:02.770 --> 03:04:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Fuck God.</v>

7274
03:04:04.700 --> 03:04:05.590
<v Speaker 1>And then they were pulling,</v>

7275
03:04:05.600 --> 03:04:08.210
<v Speaker 1>they were a club and he and Kevin was let me get their check and Dwayne was</v>

7276
03:04:08.211 --> 03:04:08.301
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

7277
03:04:08.301 --> 03:04:08.721
<v Speaker 1>let me get it.</v>

7278
03:04:08.721 --> 03:04:08.901
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

7279
03:04:08.901 --> 03:04:09.471
<v Speaker 1>now let me get it,</v>

7280
03:04:09.471 --> 03:04:09.711
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

7281
03:04:09.711 --> 03:04:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Let me get it.</v>

7282
03:04:10.380 --> 03:04:11.510
<v Speaker 1>And he looked at the bill and he was,</v>

7283
03:04:11.511 --> 03:04:12.360
<v Speaker 1>it was so expensive.</v>

7284
03:04:12.361 --> 03:04:14.720
<v Speaker 1>He had to bring it in the light to make sure he had the number right.</v>

7285
03:04:14.721 --> 03:04:15.081
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

7286
03:04:15.081 --> 03:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>what does it</v>

7287
03:04:17.600 --> 03:04:18.440
<v Speaker 1>hurt now though?</v>

7288
03:04:19.150 --> 03:04:20.630
<v Speaker 1>But if that's what you want to do,</v>

7289
03:04:20.631 --> 03:04:22.640
<v Speaker 1>like if he just want to concentrate on money,</v>

7290
03:04:22.910 --> 03:04:26.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean the real problem is that requires a mindset of it's own.</v>

7291
03:04:26.691 --> 03:04:30.350
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of the people that are just financial entrepreneurs and people that</v>

7292
03:04:30.351 --> 03:04:32.030
<v Speaker 1>are like obsessed with making money,</v>

7293
03:04:32.300 --> 03:04:34.730
<v Speaker 1>they're not also creative geniuses.</v>

7294
03:04:34.970 --> 03:04:38.530
<v Speaker 1>They're not also pursuing a career in PR in the arts.</v>

7295
03:04:38.560 --> 03:04:39.393
<v Speaker 1>They're not Jevity.</v>

7296
03:04:39.410 --> 03:04:39.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7297
03:04:39.741 --> 03:04:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just you gotta you gotta know like what you're,</v>

7298
03:04:42.631 --> 03:04:43.490
<v Speaker 1>you're getting into.</v>

7299
03:04:43.491 --> 03:04:47.780
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a guy that just gets wrapped up and hanging around with rich people</v>

7300
03:04:47.781 --> 03:04:49.070
<v Speaker 1>and keeping up with the Joneses,</v>

7301
03:04:49.120 --> 03:04:50.790
<v Speaker 1>and if you an Indian stocks,</v>

7302
03:04:51.050 --> 03:04:52.040
<v Speaker 1>if you're an athlete,</v>

7303
03:04:52.041 --> 03:04:55.370
<v Speaker 1>it could wind up fucking up your career because you get so wrapped up in that</v>

7304
03:04:55.371 --> 03:04:57.350
<v Speaker 1>stuff that it takes some focus away.</v>

7305
03:04:57.400 --> 03:04:58.233
<v Speaker 1>Tell what else happens.</v>

7306
03:04:58.250 --> 03:04:58.671
<v Speaker 1>You did it.</v>

7307
03:04:58.671 --> 03:04:58.891
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

7308
03:04:58.891 --> 03:04:59.990
<v Speaker 1>you're married to a girl,</v>

7309
03:05:00.260 --> 03:05:03.540
<v Speaker 1>she's hanging out with their wives and now she wants to get that,</v>

7310
03:05:03.950 --> 03:05:05.180
<v Speaker 1>that $10,000 handbag.</v>

7311
03:05:05.181 --> 03:05:06.060
<v Speaker 1>She wants that.</v>

7312
03:05:06.380 --> 03:05:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Ben's,</v>

7313

<v Speaker 1>she wants that.</v>

7314
03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:09.950
<v Speaker 1>And you don't want to make her feel like she's not.</v>

7315
03:05:09.951 --> 03:05:10.940
<v Speaker 1>So she's in that group.</v>

7316
03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:11.950
<v Speaker 1>School's in session.</v>

7317

03:12:45.560 --> 03:12:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Bet your sweet ass.</v>

7608
03:12:46.490 --> 03:12:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Do you just saying stuff right now bro?</v>

7609
03:12:48.461 --> 03:12:48.791
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

7610
03:12:48.791 --> 03:12:51.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to do it when you're thinking about no peppers,</v>

7611
03:12:51.441 --> 03:12:52.600
<v Speaker 1>but you don't really have a guy.</v>

7612
03:12:54.130 --> 03:12:55.120
<v Speaker 1>But if I can grill it,</v>

7613
03:12:55.810 --> 03:12:56.650
<v Speaker 1>the peppers,</v>

7614
03:12:56.710 --> 03:12:59.140
<v Speaker 1>I could tell he was fucking line cause he started grabbing his own beer and it</v>

7615
03:12:59.150 --> 03:12:59.450
<v Speaker 1>was called.</v>

7616
03:12:59.450 --> 03:13:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah I do</v>

7617
03:13:02.110 --> 03:13:03.120
<v Speaker 1>because there was a tiny pause.</v>

7618
03:13:03.121 --> 03:13:03.740
<v Speaker 1>He went,</v>

7619
03:13:03.740 --> 03:13:04.560
<v Speaker 1>I sure do.</v>

7620
03:13:04.560 --> 03:13:05.301
<v Speaker 1>This is the move.</v>

7621
03:13:05.301 --> 03:13:10.090
<v Speaker 1>The move is we have Tom Papa Cook bread cause he gave me a fucking loaf of sour</v>

7622
03:13:10.091 --> 03:13:10.741
<v Speaker 1>dough bread.</v>

7623
03:13:10.741 --> 03:13:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Here's the media of the day.</v>

7624
03:13:11.920 --> 03:13:14.690
<v Speaker 1>But he baked it in the morning and I cheated on it that night.</v>

7625
03:13:14.691 --> 03:13:15.080
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

7626
03:13:15.080 --> 03:13:17.750
<v Speaker 1>I had bread and butter on it.</v>

7627
03:13:17.780 --> 03:13:18.111
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>

7628
03:13:18.111 --> 03:13:18.681
<v Speaker 1>just butter.</v>

7629
03:13:18.681 --> 03:13:19.730
<v Speaker 1>It was outstanding.</v>

7630
03:13:20.130 --> 03:13:21.770
<v Speaker 1>I said at some of it just raw,</v>

7631
03:13:21.771 --> 03:13:23.750
<v Speaker 1>just butter the bread for me,</v>

7632
03:13:23.751 --> 03:13:24.584
<v Speaker 1>but keep going.</v>

7633
03:13:24.680 --> 03:13:25.491
<v Speaker 1>He's very into it,</v>

7634
03:13:25.491 --> 03:13:26.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's because he makes it all himself.</v>

7635
03:13:26.991 --> 03:13:28.550
<v Speaker 1>When I get off from scratch,</v>

7636
03:13:28.551 --> 03:13:29.210
<v Speaker 1>it's so good.</v>

7637
03:13:29.210 --> 03:13:29.331
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

7638
03:13:29.331 --> 03:13:29.901
<v Speaker 1>so this is the,</v>

7639
03:13:29.901 --> 03:13:30.734
<v Speaker 1>this is the idea.</v>

7640
03:13:30.920 --> 03:13:33.650
<v Speaker 1>We'll make some elk burgers with blue cheese in the middle.</v>

7641
03:13:33.651 --> 03:13:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Pork fat little together as one and then I flatten out.</v>

7642
03:13:36.660 --> 03:13:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I put blue cheese in the stature that fold that bitch.</v>

7643
03:13:40.370 --> 03:13:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you and your catch and keep calling fucking American.</v>

7644
03:13:42.981 --> 03:13:44.750
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean they'll catch out with blue cheese,</v>

7645
03:13:44.751 --> 03:13:45.140
<v Speaker 1>bro?</v>

7646
03:13:45.140 --> 03:13:45.770
<v Speaker 1>I grew up,</v>

7647
03:13:45.770 --> 03:13:50.570
<v Speaker 1>I grilled on grilled that bitch and we're going to put it in between two pieces</v>

7648
03:13:50.571 --> 03:13:51.680
<v Speaker 1>of Tom propers.</v>

7649
03:13:53.990 --> 03:13:56.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm hungry right now so bad.</v>

7650
03:13:56.661 --> 03:13:57.920
<v Speaker 1>My stomach is all cut up,</v>

7651
03:13:58.120 --> 03:14:01.790
<v Speaker 1>shredding fucking hands and Jalapenos on that motherfucker.</v>

7652
03:14:01.791 --> 03:14:02.181
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

7653
03:14:02.181 --> 03:14:03.140
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of lettuce.</v>

7654
03:14:03.141 --> 03:14:03.974
<v Speaker 1>He wants him left.</v>

7655
03:14:04.400 --> 03:14:04.940
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

7656
03:14:04.940 --> 03:14:08.780
<v Speaker 1>let's have Tom Papa make some nice fucking French toast and shut his fucking</v>

7657
03:14:08.781 --> 03:14:09.614
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>

7658
03:14:10.010 --> 03:14:11.040
<v Speaker 1>French toast would be,</v>

7659
03:14:11.610 --> 03:14:13.800

7662
03:14:16.780 --> 03:14:17.290

7663
03:14:17.290 --> 03:14:18.020
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

7664
03:14:18.020 --> 03:14:18.630
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

7665

<v Speaker 1>I'm going from buffalo too,</v>

7671
03:14:28.281 --> 03:14:29.930

<v Speaker 1>you can eat it,</v>

7698
03:15:10.190 --> 03:15:13.720
<v Speaker 1>but it takes so long to chew because they're just checked.</v>

7699
03:15:13.780 --> 03:15:15.440

7712
03:15:35.840 --> 03:15:38.630
<v Speaker 1>The bear didn't want to eat like a shade up native American.</v>

7713
03:15:38.920 --> 03:15:39.500
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say it's a busted lip.</v>

7727
03:15:53.970 --> 03:15:55.360
<v Speaker 2>Rather look like this.</v>

7728
03:15:55.550 --> 03:15:57.150
<v Speaker 2>However things get weird in there.</v>

7729
03:15:57.180 --> 03:16:01.080
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's a very round busted lip.</v>

7730
03:16:01.081 --> 03:16:04.080
<v Speaker 2>That's a brown perfectly symmetrical round hurt</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's all good.</v>

7733
03:16:06.901 --> 03:16:07.770
<v Speaker 2>I get those sometimes.</v>

7734
03:16:07.830 --> 03:16:09.180
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember when,</v>

03:16:09.620 --> 03:16:12.270
<v Speaker 2>chocolate Liddell fought rich Franklin and his lip got split?</v>

7737
03:16:12.330 --> 03:16:13.163
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

7738
03:16:14.520 --> 03:16:14.761
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7739
03:16:14.761 --> 03:16:15.594
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>

7740
03:16:15.750 --> 03:16:16.240
<v Speaker 2>Powerful.</v>

7741
03:16:16.240 --> 03:16:17.073
<v Speaker 2>Retrained.</v>

7742
03:16:17.130 --> 03:16:17.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7743
03:16:17.371 --> 03:16:18.270

<v Speaker 2>crazy split lip.</v>

7745
03:16:19.500 --> 03:16:21.300
<v Speaker 2>So Franklin just sort of stepped away.</v>

7746
03:16:21.301 --> 03:16:22.890
<v Speaker 2>He never really officially retired.</v>

7747
03:16:23.160 --> 03:16:24.210
<v Speaker 2>He just stepped back.</v>

7748
03:16:24.300 --> 03:16:24.811
<v Speaker 2>It was just like,</v>

7749

7750
03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:26.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm a chill for a little bit split.</v>

7751
03:16:26.820 --> 03:16:28.620
<v Speaker 2>But then it wasn't like a big announcement,</v>

7752
03:16:28.621 --> 03:16:30.900
<v Speaker 2>like guys weren't doing it like they are now.</v>

7753
03:16:31.100 --> 03:16:31.900
<v Speaker 2>Then you went to warn us.</v>

7754
03:16:31.900 --> 03:16:32.131
<v Speaker 2>See.</v>

7755
03:16:32.131 --> 03:16:32.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

7756
03:16:32.350 --> 03:16:32.850
<v Speaker 2>It might be hard,</v>

7757
03:16:32.850 --> 03:16:33.331
<v Speaker 2>but let's see.</v>

7758
03:16:33.331 --> 03:16:34.170
<v Speaker 2>That looks like a herpes.</v>

7759
03:16:34.240 --> 03:16:34.890
<v Speaker 2>Me.</v>

7760
03:16:34.890 --> 03:16:35.640
<v Speaker 2>You might be right.</v>

7761
03:16:35.640 --> 03:16:36.031
<v Speaker 2>It's all good.</v>

7762
03:16:36.031 --> 03:16:36.631
<v Speaker 2>He's a married man.</v>

7763
03:16:36.631 --> 03:16:36.741
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

7764
03:16:36.741 --> 03:16:37.441
<v Speaker 2>that's all good.</v>

7765
03:16:37.441 --> 03:16:38.180
<v Speaker 2>That's a big strong,</v>

7766
03:16:38.180 --> 03:16:39.013
<v Speaker 2>it's stress.</v>

7767
03:16:39.200 --> 03:16:40.330
<v Speaker 2>Could be an elbow though.</v>

7768
03:16:41.470 --> 03:16:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Fuck around with chicken head.</v>

03:18:02.131 --> 03:18:04.740
<v Speaker 2>influence that you guys have and how many people listen,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7895
03:19:57.490 --> 03:19:59.280
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like the paramount station or something.</v>

7896
03:19:59.320 --> 03:20:00.310
<v Speaker 1>What is the ultimate,</v>

7897
03:20:01.090 --> 03:20:01.840

7898
03:20:01.840 --> 03:20:02.980
<v Speaker 1>let's find out what they're calling it.</v>

7899
03:20:03.230 --> 03:20:03.460
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

7900
03:20:03.460 --> 03:20:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I think they're gonna change.</v>

7901
03:20:04.530 --> 03:20:04.930
<v Speaker 1>I think they're,</v>

7902
03:20:04.930 --> 03:20:08.560
<v Speaker 1>I think they are literally changing the name is that is paramount in that we're</v>

7903
03:20:08.570 --> 03:20:08.730
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

03:20:09.490 --> 03:20:11.020
<v Speaker 1>I got my foam on the Pauls.</v>

7906
03:20:11.110 --> 03:20:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood shows.</v>

7907
03:20:12.340 --> 03:20:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Very few people that are in Hollywood that know less about Hollywood than me.</v>

7908
03:20:15.730 --> 03:20:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

7909
03:20:16.240 --> 03:20:16.960
<v Speaker 1>But you knew that.</v>

7910
03:20:16.960 --> 03:20:18.700
<v Speaker 1>I knew that we bring in a hot new,</v>

7911
03:20:18.701 --> 03:20:20.770
<v Speaker 1>that paramount fight leaks.</v>

7912
03:20:20.771 --> 03:20:21.604

7913
03:20:21.670 --> 03:20:22.390

7917
03:20:24.370 --> 03:20:25.120
<v Speaker 1>give some kind of,</v>

7918
03:20:25.120 --> 03:20:26.110
<v Speaker 1>it's just MMA.</v>

7919
03:20:26.140 --> 03:20:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Just call it MMA.</v>

7920
03:20:27.010 --> 03:20:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Just like when you go to see boxing,</v>

7921
03:20:28.421 --> 03:20:29.470
<v Speaker 1>you're not seeing like,</v>

7922
03:20:29.770 --> 03:20:30.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7923
03:20:30.101 --> 03:20:30.630
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

7924
03:20:30.630 --> 03:20:31.590
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have a mic.</v>

7925
03:20:31.830 --> 03:20:32.590
<v Speaker 1>Showtime,</v>

7926
03:20:32.590 --> 03:20:33.341
<v Speaker 1>Hbo.</v>

7927
03:20:33.341 --> 03:20:33.551
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

7928
03:20:33.551 --> 03:20:34.180
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

7929
03:20:34.180 --> 03:20:35.320
<v Speaker 1>But it's HBO boxing.</v>

7930
03:20:35.321 --> 03:20:37.020
<v Speaker 1>Showtime fight night are paramount.</v>

7931
03:20:37.030 --> 03:20:37.863
<v Speaker 1>Fight night,</v>

7932
03:20:38.350 --> 03:20:40.840
<v Speaker 1>paramount Nmai hape review two or whatever.</v>

7933
03:20:40.841 --> 03:20:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7934
03:20:41.470 --> 03:20:46.470
<v Speaker 1>And MMA has enough of a name now that I think you can like everyone knows UFC is</v>

7935
03:20:46.571 --> 03:20:48.160
<v Speaker 1>always going to be like NFL,</v>

7936
03:20:48.410 --> 03:20:49.360
<v Speaker 1>like NBA.</v>

7937
03:20:49.361 --> 03:20:50.350
<v Speaker 1>It's going to plead find.</v>

7938
03:20:50.690 --> 03:20:52.240
<v Speaker 1>It defines Q tips.</v>

7939
03:20:52.630 --> 03:20:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

7940
03:20:53.410 --> 03:20:55.330
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you what I do like with the UFC is doing.</v>

7941
03:20:55.331 --> 03:20:56.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that it's on fight pass.</v>

7942
03:20:56.621 --> 03:20:57.700
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a terrible idea.</v>

7943
03:20:57.701 --> 03:21:01.120
<v Speaker 1>But the data lights contender series every Thursday night there's like five</v>

7944
03:21:01.121 --> 03:21:01.900
<v Speaker 1>fights of luck.</v>

7945
03:21:01.900 --> 03:21:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Upcoming guys to build up new guys.</v>

7946
03:21:04.150 --> 03:21:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7947
03:21:04.610 --> 03:21:05.500
<v Speaker 1>What's on fight pass?</v>

7948
03:21:05.501 --> 03:21:06.640
<v Speaker 1>We're only the balls.</v>

7949
03:21:06.641 --> 03:21:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Deep hardcore fans see it.</v>

7950
03:21:08.350 --> 03:21:09.820
<v Speaker 1>That should be on Fox sports one,</v>

7951
03:21:09.821 --> 03:21:11.140
<v Speaker 1>they need content like a motherfucker.</v>

7952
03:21:11.410 --> 03:21:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I came on Fox sport,</v>

7953
03:21:12.820 --> 03:21:13.720
<v Speaker 1>the pregame,</v>

7954
03:21:13.990 --> 03:21:18.280
<v Speaker 1>they had Bisbing and Gilbert Melendez guessing the capitals of Europe for 30</v>

7955
03:21:18.281 --> 03:21:18.770
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

7956
03:21:18.770 --> 03:21:19.603
<v Speaker 1>That's important.</v>

7957
03:21:20.920 --> 03:21:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Not to freak the fuck guessing the capitals of Europe.</v>

7958
03:21:24.161 --> 03:21:24.990
<v Speaker 1>The fuck it was.</v>

7959
03:21:24.990 --> 03:21:25.823
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

7960
03:21:25.840 --> 03:21:28.630
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing about live sports.</v>

7961
03:21:29.080 --> 03:21:32.470
<v Speaker 1>This the only thing that makes TV valuable these days.</v>

7962
03:21:32.580 --> 03:21:35.830
<v Speaker 1>The only thing if you take away live sports,</v>

7963
03:21:36.160 --> 03:21:38.020
<v Speaker 1>nobody's watching sitcoms anymore.</v>

7964
03:21:38.021 --> 03:21:39.820
<v Speaker 1>The numbers have dropped radically.</v>

7965
03:21:40.000 --> 03:21:40.421
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's,</v>

7966
03:21:40.421 --> 03:21:40.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

7967
03:21:40.990 --> 03:21:43.210
<v Speaker 1>there's a few people watching those cop dramas,</v>

7968
03:21:43.211 --> 03:21:45.320
<v Speaker 1>those CSI shows is this people,</v>

7969
03:21:45.321 --> 03:21:46.460
<v Speaker 1>it was brain dead.</v>

7970
03:21:46.461 --> 03:21:48.410
<v Speaker 1>People in the Midwest is sitting in front of the TV.</v>

7971
03:21:49.120 --> 03:21:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda,</v>

7972
03:21:49.730 --> 03:21:51.230
<v Speaker 1>that's the bad guy.</v>

7973
03:21:51.530 --> 03:21:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Cause you get a car.</v>

7974
03:21:53.450 --> 03:21:54.790
<v Speaker 1>I was going to get caught.</v>

7975
03:21:54.800 --> 03:21:56.380
<v Speaker 1>That's a terrible character.</v>

7976
03:21:57.160 --> 03:21:58.380
<v Speaker 1>How could that character,</v>

7977
03:21:58.460 --> 03:21:59.500
<v Speaker 1>this is my shower,</v>

7978
03:21:59.570 --> 03:22:00.510
<v Speaker 1>this is my show.</v>

7979
03:22:00.530 --> 03:22:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Csi My show,</v>

7980
03:22:05.570 --> 03:22:06.403
<v Speaker 1>some</v>

7981
03:22:07.370 --> 03:22:11.270
<v Speaker 1>soda water drinking Dr Pepper Chips and shit.</v>

7982
03:22:11.570 --> 03:22:12.620
<v Speaker 1>But I think that um,</v>

7983
03:22:13.490 --> 03:22:14.840
<v Speaker 1>those shows are dropping off.</v>

7984
03:22:14.840 --> 03:22:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at like Hbo,</v>

7985
03:22:17.780 --> 03:22:19.490
<v Speaker 1>the shows that they put together,</v>

7986
03:22:19.491 --> 03:22:22.550
<v Speaker 1>the show is showtime puts together the shows Netflix put together.</v>

7987
03:22:22.551 --> 03:22:25.490
<v Speaker 1>They're just superior thought and not interrupted by commercial,</v>

7988
03:22:26.480 --> 03:22:28.240
<v Speaker 1>especially the episodes and all that.</v>

7989
03:22:28.241 --> 03:22:28.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7990
03:22:28.401 --> 03:22:32.510
<v Speaker 1>So the big thing for television is live sports.</v>

7991
03:22:32.750 --> 03:22:33.583
<v Speaker 1>Like a fight.</v>

7992
03:22:33.590 --> 03:22:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Like we came here to watch television.</v>

7993
03:22:35.511 --> 03:22:37.580
<v Speaker 1>We came here to watch a live fighting event.</v>

7994
03:22:38.120 --> 03:22:38.401
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7995
03:22:38.401 --> 03:22:40.010
<v Speaker 1>the live sporting events are like,</v>

7996
03:22:40.040 --> 03:22:40.731
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

7997
03:22:40.731 --> 03:22:42.440
<v Speaker 1>the premier thing on television now.</v>

7998
03:22:42.920 --> 03:22:44.630
<v Speaker 1>It's really the only reason why you'd have cable,</v>

7999
03:22:44.631 --> 03:22:45.464
<v Speaker 1>to be honest.</v>

8000
03:22:45.710 --> 03:22:46.531
<v Speaker 1>For a lot of kids,</v>

8001
03:22:46.531 --> 03:22:47.570
<v Speaker 1>everything else you can get.</v>

8002
03:22:47.600 --> 03:22:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's generation.</v>

8003
03:22:48.621 --> 03:22:49.490
<v Speaker 1>These youngsters,</v>

8004
03:22:49.520 --> 03:22:51.290
<v Speaker 1>they're all abandoning their cable.</v>

8005
03:22:51.320 --> 03:22:54.920
<v Speaker 1>They're all turning off their direct TV and just watching their computers.</v>

8006
03:22:54.950 --> 03:22:55.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8007
03:22:55.101 --> 03:22:56.300
<v Speaker 1>they're just getting at Netflix.</v>

8008
03:22:56.590 --> 03:22:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8009

8013
03:23:01.910 --> 03:23:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8014
03:23:02.160 --> 03:23:05.000
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be able to air television shows that are on television right</v>

8015
03:23:05.001 --> 03:23:06.470
<v Speaker 1>now on youtube.</v>

<v Speaker 1>My TV,</v>

8017
03:23:08.030 --> 03:23:13.030
<v Speaker 1>I got a TV at home and it plays Netflix from the TV without an apple TV with it.</v>

8018
03:23:13.540 --> 03:23:13.970

03:23:18.680 --> 03:23:18.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
