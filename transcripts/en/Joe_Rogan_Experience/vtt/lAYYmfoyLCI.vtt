00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.420
Weirdos like zone healers are fucking freaks who are doing strange things that

2
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.240
really relies on someone believing in it.
And if someone does believe in it,

3
00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:13.690
then the placebo effect does kind of has some effect.

4
00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:15.670
But you don't want to rely on that fucking thing.

5
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.440
It's nice to know that there's actually some shit going on and not just,

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.290
you know,
I think I feel it right.

7
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.290
The big one for me has always been forming sentences.

8
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.880
Cause obviously I talk for a living,

9
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.770
I talk for a living form sentences for a living and my ability to recall words

10
00:00:32.771 --> 00:00:35.050
and to pull words up instantaneously.

11
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.350
It's critical when dealing with hecklers at a comedy club,

12
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.760
when recalling material,

13
00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:44.200
when recalling techniques or going over techniques during a UFC card,
when,

14
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.630
you know,
trying to reference something during a podcast,
like that's so giant.

15
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.210
And for most people,

16
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.210
<v 1>for everything,
when you're talking to a girl and you're in a business meeting,</v>

17
00:00:52.211 --> 00:00:54.940
when you're in an interview and you're just out hanging out,

18
00:00:54.941 --> 00:00:56.060
it's nice to be able to knock off.

19
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.450
<v 0>Oh yeah.
You know,
and have to think about that,
those dull moments.
You know,</v>

20
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:02.850
we've all had those dull moments when you just woke up,

21
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:06.450
when someone's talking to you on the phone and you're,
um,
you know,

22
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:10.430
it's that thing like I do those fucking radio interviews sometimes,
man.
Uh,

23
00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:12.510
and a lot of times I'll do these radio tours,

24
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.550
like start at like six o'clock in the morning when I wake up,

25
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:15.930
like for UFC and stuff like that,

26
00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:19.470
I have to call up all these different radio stations and for the first 40

27
00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:21.690
minutes I'm a fucking moron,
man.
It's like,

28
00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:26.550
it's so hard to fire up and it's like,
that's one thing that's like,

29
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.650
it's so critical to highlight.

30
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.550
Your brain is not a static state.
It's just not.

31
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.580
It's constantly moving and flowing and what things like Alpha brain can do along

32
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:41.760
with,
of course,
meditation,
proper thinking techniques,

33
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.030
how to manage your consciousness,
managing your mind.

34
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.390
They can get you or keep you in a,
in a,

35
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.800
in a more positive frequency and better,
a better vibration,

36
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.540
a better,
a better Rpm,
you know,
quicker Rpm,
then you would

37
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.740
<v 1>a better frequency for what you're trying to do.
I mean,</v>

38
00:01:59.741 --> 00:02:03.490
you're dragging yourself out of sleep,
which is theta state,
which is really low.

39
00:02:03.491 --> 00:02:05.860
And sometimes Delta state,
if you're a really good sleeper,

40
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.990
which is at the very bottom part of the frequency,

41
00:02:07.991 --> 00:02:11.290
and you're trying to drag yourself back out to that without,

42
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.040
and getting in the optimal frequency,
it's tough.
But yeah,
these things can,

43
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.900
and we've shown it now with these studies,

44
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.290
help get you in that optimal brainwave frequency,
which is pretty Rad.

45
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.310
<v 0>It's very exciting.
And the Boston Center for memory,
they did,</v>

46
00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:27.200
they try to bunch of different shit this year that didn't do anything.
Yeah,
yeah.

47
00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:27.440
This,

48
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.850
<v 1>so they,
Alpha brain broke a streak of 14 straight clinical trials from both</v>

49
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:35.120
pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals that showed zero results.

50
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.010
So when they came back with the results,

51
00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:40.850
they were like pretty surprised and pretty stoked because they're used to just

52
00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:44.000
doing these trials and they report every single one.
If it came back negative,

53
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.520
they'd run the report and they're,
they're,
they're pros.
You know,

54
00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:47.480
they're used to doing this.

55
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.370
And a Alpha brain broke that streak of 14 in a row that came back,
no results.

56
00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:55.300
So they were fired up.
Especially because this is an,

57
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.940
this is a product that has earth grow,
nutrient ingredients,
natural ingredients,

58
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.190
natural ingredients

59
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.820
<v 0>on a healthy population and statistical significance,
you know,</v>

60
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:07.600
really extremely rare according to them,
uh,
from what they've seen.

61
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:09.520
And so it's a pretty fired up.

62
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.580
Isn't it hilarious that so many different things that we could consider earth

63
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:17.530
grown nutrients,
you know,
natural ingredients,

64
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.040
natural ingredients you looked upon,
like what is that going to do?
Yeah,
yeah.

65
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.790
Like,
like most of what you putting in your body,

66
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:26.830
it's supposed to be that staff.
I mean,

67
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:30.210
that's literally the building blocks of your fucking sells is,
is,

68
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.330
is vegetable matter,
plant matter protein that earth grow nutrients.

69
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:37.170
That's what's your,
your Maytag.
How do we get bigger?
How do we get bigger?

70
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.070
We get bigger because we eat these things and it becomes us.
You know?

71
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.770
But it's funny that those things,

72
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:45.730
I mean especially I'm not alpha brain obviously because it's not illegal,

73
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.250
but fuck,
if they had found out about it a long time ago,

74
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:52.750
it probably would have been illegal.
Cannabis,
uh,
is uh,
something that,

75
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:56.140
of course everyone that listens to this podcast knows pretty much how I feel

76
00:03:56.141 --> 00:04:00.100
about marijuana and how important I think it is for humanity.

77
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.460
But it's really a,

78
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.070
it's hitting home with me right now because I have a good friend whose mom has

79
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.600
stage four cancer.
They took her off chemotherapy,

80
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.110
they put her on a CBD oil,
they put her on hand,
Boyle.

81
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.840
And I'm not suggesting anybody do this by the way,

82
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.110
if you know someone who's on cancer and you listen to your fucking doctor,
okay,

83
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.600
do whatever your doctor tells you to do.
However,

84
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:22.660
I just want to tell you what is happening.
My friend,
cause his mom,

85
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:26.270
they pulled her off chemotherapy because they said she was too weak.
I said,

86
00:04:26.271 --> 00:04:28.810
she can't do this anymore.
So he's panicking.
He's like,

87
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:33.700
she's got a few months to live.
He gets her on that hemp oil or the cannabis oil.

88
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.150
Yeah.
Her tumors shrank 30% inside of a month,

89
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.520
30% she sleeps every night where she couldn't sleep before she eats all the

90
00:04:42.521 --> 00:04:44.860
time.
Her appetite is back,
she sleeps,

91
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.300
her appetite is back and her tumor has shrunk by 30 fucking percent inside of a

92
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:50.710
month.
That's awesome.

93
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:54.250
And it shows just how like improving things a little bit can start a positive

94
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:54.821
cascade.

95
00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:58.210
Like you improve just enough to sleep and then the sleep starts improving
things.

96
00:04:58.211 --> 00:05:00.040
And then once you sleep enough,
you can eat more.

97
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.570
And that starts improving things.

98
00:05:01.571 --> 00:05:04.960
So even if the cannabis was only a 10% increase,

99
00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:08.260
maybe that got her to sleep and then maybe the sleep got her to eat and then all

100
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:11.980
of a sudden it starts going on down the line and making a big improvement.
Yeah,

101
00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:16.030
I mean,
you can't discount any of the,
the factors,
you know,
even the chemotherapy,

102
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:16.990
any of the things that she was doing.

103
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.470
But the fact that the cannabis helped her so much helped her sleep,

104
00:05:20.471 --> 00:05:25.240
helped her eat and that in most states,
except for what,
18 now it's illegal.

105
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.500
And in Colorado right now,
they're trying to get people to,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,

106
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.220
sheriff's department and some form of a other form of police department there.

107
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.380
They're trying to sue the state because they said they're upholding a state and

108
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:41.950
federal laws and they're not allowed to uphold the federal law against
marijuana.

109
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.980
Why?
Because they're fucking arrests are down.
The rest are down.

110
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:47.090
They're panicking.
They're going to have to lay off cops there.

111
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.720
They're violent crime is down by like something like 15%.

112
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.930
They have the lowest incidents of drunk driving they've ever had in the state

113
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.710
and they're making fuckloads of money off of tax dollars.

114
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.730
Cannabis is taxed at 39%

115
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.220
<v 2>in Colorado.
That's crazy.
They're making so much money.</v>

116
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:04.130
They had to give some back.
Right?
Yeah.
It's hilarious.
Yeah.
Well,

117
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:05.960
we're going to start selling marijuana eventually,

118
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.890
but right now we're selling alpha for,

119
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.030
so got on a.com bubble and n I t use the Codeword Rogan and you'll save 10% off

120
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:15.500
any and all supplements.
Any other Onnit shit.

121
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.100
Cyber fall is all kinds of cool shit going on.
But yeah,

122
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.870
we'll get on with the pocket.
We got a lot of cool shit including this stuff.

123
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:24.140
What does this Maka Shit I'm drinking.
Yeah,
that's macho,
Macho Chai Latte.

124
00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:28.130
So a ton of Tumeric in there.
Some matcha green tea,
a lot of health benefits.

125
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.220
Real whole spice Chai Macia at some really good drinks.

126
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:34.690
You feel like a hippie makes you want to be around people that have incense and

127
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.990
be like,
it's some sort of macrame project going on back home.
Some,

128
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.140
some carpet that's weird and weird.
Weird earthy colors people.

129
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.200
Yeah,
I'm done with a lot of hippies.
Yeah,

130
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.960
but just a few hippies and fucking ruined it for everybody else or hippies.

131
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.500
A tried too hard.
God Damn.
It's like they're like the Vegan version of hippies.

132
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.580
Yeah.
Well yeah.
Right.
Like to just overzealous.
But that's with everything,
man.

133
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.300
I mean that's like the MMA dudes that wear those fucking tee shirts on it.

134
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.510
You know what?
The skulls that have bullet holes in them and you know,

135
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:07.430
strangling chickens like it's always some fucking guys.
They get it too far.

136
00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:10.340
Yeah.
Instead of just being there showing and as soon as he started showing,

137
00:07:10.341 --> 00:07:12.680
then it's a problem.
That's what it is with everything though,
right?

138
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.080
I mean pretty much with everything there is in this world.

139
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.270
What am I looking for here?
Wonderful.
I don't know.
Should we cue the music?
Yeah.

140
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.730
What do we do that still?
Yeah,
we kind of do that still.
Yeah.

141
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.993
<v 3>Boom.</v>

142
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.420
<v 2>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

143
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.040
<v 3>Try my day.
Joe Rogan podcast by night.
All Day.</v>

144
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:40.040
<v 2>I'm really worried that I lost my wallet.
That's the word.
Is it out there?</v>

145
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.040
Yeah.
Go check out their jammies.
See if we could find it out there.

146
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.470
I don't think it is out there though.
I think it's a,

147
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.390
I think I left it on a table in a restaurant.

148
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.170
It's very possible when you have kids,
dude,

149
00:07:51.171 --> 00:07:53.930
you lose your fucking mind cause you don't know what you're doing at any given

150
00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:56.420
time.
You always like,
hey,
don't eat that.
Put that down.

151
00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.200
Don't stick your finger in there.
That's electrical.
Don't,
don't chew on wires.

152
00:08:00.201 --> 00:08:04.460
Don't put that away.
Don't get like the cars are coming.
Get over here.

153
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.930
You're wrangling.
So I don't have a wallet right now,

154
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.690
so hopefully somebody knows where it is.
We'll find out.

155
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.200
Jamie's taking too long because if it was out there,
he would have found it.

156
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:16.913
<v 3>We might be fucked.</v>

157
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:23.570
<v 2>Well,
yeah,
it's the worst feeling ever,
but it all works out.
Yeah.</v>

158
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.490
The only problem is I feel like I should do something about it before this

159
00:08:26.491 --> 00:08:30.660
restaurant closes.
Nothing.
Okay.
Pause it.
We're going to be right back.

160
00:08:30.661 --> 00:08:32.250
I'm gonna check my truck real quick.
Sorry.

161
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:40.250
You're worried about me.
That isn't that funny,
man.
Like some pieces of paper,

162
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.910
some little cards you have on your wall to have your id on.
I'm like,
oh no.

163
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.620
What if I get pulled over?
It's going to take me to jail.
I read a horrible story,

164
00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:53.621
but a dude who's going to jail because he's a garbage man and he was picking up

165
00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:57.810
the garbage before 7:00 AM so they gave him a citation.

166
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.200
He goes in to deal with the citation and I don't know what he did.

167
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.740
Have you reached some agreement with a core or talk to someone and didn't

168
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:11.970
understand the ramifications and they fucking sentenced him to 30 days in jail.

169
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.730
Oh,
that's fair for that.
That's justice.
And you know I,

170
00:09:16.731 --> 00:09:20.560
I watched people like defended online wounds picking up the garbage for people

171
00:09:20.561 --> 00:09:22.800
who have a choose to put it out like what?

172
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.330
You think it's okay to put that guy in a cage.

173
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.800
You could put them in a cage and apparently they're allowing him to work during

174
00:09:31.801 --> 00:09:36.300
the week and he's got a service 30 days on weekends.
So everybody's got a family,

175
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:40.320
wife,
kids,
the whole deal.
Like most of a year.
Yeah,
30 weekends out of the year.

176
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:44.850
How fucking insane is that?
How insane is that?
They were arresting this guy,

177
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.600
putting them in jail because he picked up the garbage early.

178
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.780
What a weird world we live in,
man.
It is.

179
00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:54.600
I think we're going to look back at this time and we're just going to shake our

180
00:09:54.601 --> 00:09:57.510
head and think we did some weird shit in this period.
Good.

181
00:09:57.511 --> 00:10:01.050
Just like we look back now 50 years ago,
a hundred years ago,

182
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.050
I mean people were giving each other Labatt homies back a long time and that's

183
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.760
where they stick an ice pick in the corner of your eye and thrash it around.

184
00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:12.150
Like I haven't done what they doing.
They just trying to destroy shit.

185
00:10:12.151 --> 00:10:15.510
And that was like going to prove therapy along with electro shock and all this

186
00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:16.710
weird shit.
You know,

187
00:10:16.711 --> 00:10:19.410
we'll look at some of the judicial system we haven't be like,

188
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:23.850
what were we thinking?
Yeah.
Well,
do you remember?
Um,
there was,
um,

189
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:28.410
a documentary on hunter s Thompson and a,
in the documentary,
it was a,

190
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.800
I forget who was supporting for president,
but the vice president,

191
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.620
it was a scandal,
like as they were running for president,

192
00:10:34.621 --> 00:10:37.930
found out that he had gone through electric shock therapy.
He'd gone,

193
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:41.940
he had had a few moments.

194
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.160
We're shit didn't work out right with his brain.

195
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:48.380
And so they decided to juice this guy up with,
I mean,
what,
what is that?
The bath,

196
00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:51.600
that's like the equivalent of smacking your TV when the,
you know,

197
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:53.190
when the reception's not coming in,

198
00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:56.070
just walk up to and fucking smack it and it works.
You're like,
oh,
okay.

199
00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.750
Such a crude instrument to use
full on.

200
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:02.370
It's not like they're targeting anything.
You know,

201
00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:04.050
like Dave Asprey might be doing now.

202
00:11:04.051 --> 00:11:05.940
I mean he's still may not know exactly what he's doing,

203
00:11:05.941 --> 00:11:09.630
but at least he has an idea of a goal going forward.
When he's Zapping his brain,

204
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.530
he's guys was just like sticking a fork in the light socket.
Well they had a,

205
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:17.730
an episode of radio lab about that stuff.
Trend,
you know,
something,

206
00:11:17.731 --> 00:11:19.410
dermal stimulation,
electricity,

207
00:11:19.411 --> 00:11:22.860
they're putting electrodes on certain parts of your brain and it was really

208
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:23.880
fascinating.
Yeah,

209
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.150
that's definitely a new frontier that could show a lot of promise,

210
00:11:27.151 --> 00:11:28.890
but it's getting more exact,
you know,

211
00:11:28.891 --> 00:11:32.460
like the more you get from this crude version to the exact version,

212
00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:34.020
that's where it's going to start showing promise.
Well,

213
00:11:34.021 --> 00:11:36.060
that's what they were saying on the radio lab thing,

214
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:40.200
that they have a bunch of people that are essentially hackers that are creating

215
00:11:40.201 --> 00:11:44.840
their own home remedies and they're attaching these things to them and now

216
00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.890
sometimes they do it and they lose their sense of smell,

217
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.800
like juicing up weird parts of your brain.
You know,

218
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.970
you see weird things out of the corner of your eyes.
Your feet go numb.

219
00:11:54.971 --> 00:11:58.480
Like you just,
you're,
you're applying electricity to the outside of your head.

220
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:03.820
But there's been some things where they've shown like significant improvements,

221
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:08.230
including the ability to focus and the ability to learn tasks.

222
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.660
Like they had this woman go through a sniper training thing.

223
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.020
She did it on the Nache,
she does it,
she's terrible at it.

224
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.080
She knows just like this video game or the hostage situations.

225
00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:20.710
Who Do you shoot and she's missing everybody.
She gets like two out of,
you know,

226
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:23.500
whatever the fuck the number was.
She does it again.

227
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:27.490
They strapped these things to her head.
She does the whole 20 minute course.
She,

228
00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:31.420
it,
it's over like like that.
And she goes,
well,
why was it over so quick?

229
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.840
And they go,
that was 20 minutes.
And she goes,
no,
it wasn't.

230
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:37.090
So they show her the time like this was 20 minutes.

231
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:41.350
She hits every target 100% accuracy.
And she's like,

232
00:12:41.351 --> 00:12:43.810
what in the actual fuck just happened?

233
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.950
Like they juiced her up with these electrodes and she became a fucking assassin.

234
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:48.850
Yeah,
that's awesome.

235
00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:51.280
I'm wondering if it was manipulating the brainwave frequency,

236
00:12:51.281 --> 00:12:54.450
like getting her into that Alpha state zone or whether it was,
you know,

237
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.640
prefrontal cortex blood flow or,
there's a lot of different things they can do,

238
00:12:57.641 --> 00:13:01.210
but I think there's a lot of promise in that field.
You know,
it's,
it's a,

239
00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:05.260
it's a shortcut that we're starting to learn.
Well,
we're,
we're still,

240
00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.640
you know,

241
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:11.640
most people at least are still white belts in how to manage the mind,

242
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:13.241
you know,

243
00:13:13.241 --> 00:13:17.530
were amateur race car drivers with this insanely complicated piece of machinery

244
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.780
that most people don't understand the potential of.

245
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.890
And there's different states that you achieve almost accidentally,
right?

246
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.710
You have a couple of shots were at the bar.
You can't,
you're playing pool.

247
00:13:26.711 --> 00:13:29.570
You can't fucking miss.
Everybody's been there.
You know,

248
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.210
you think you're Tom Cruise,
you look away,

249
00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:35.000
you fire the ball dead in the heart of the pocket.
But try recreating that a few,

250
00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:39.400
a few days later and it's gone.
You know,
maybe even an hour from now it's gone.

251
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.700
It's like,
I think that's why the ancients used to blame it on the gods.

252
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:47.440
The gods are with me.
Hermes was all holding my stick on the pool thing.

253
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.020
Whatever the heck.
Cause it's so crazy.

254
00:13:50.021 --> 00:13:51.460
It's like you don't know when it's gonna come.

255
00:13:51.461 --> 00:13:55.660
It's like you've been gifted by the divine and with the,
with the ancients too.

256
00:13:55.661 --> 00:13:59.830
They only lived to be like 20 so like they had to like figure it out real quick.

257
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:04.120
It was gods,
the gods have done this for us.
Okay,
I think I have cancer.

258
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.690
See you guys later.
And they'll just fucking probably won't even cancer.
Right.

259
00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:11.560
They're both Brown.
The flu.
Syphilis.
Yeah.
Something that got all the ancients.

260
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.500
Yeah,
it got the VNA,
right.
Well,
who's was the first dude to get vd?

261
00:14:14.501 --> 00:14:18.220
Who's that dirty bastard?
There had to be like the first guy they think.

262
00:14:18.221 --> 00:14:21.640
Right and that's just been around forever.
It just the bane of existence.

263
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:25.210
But it's funny that there's like a specific disease,

264
00:14:25.211 --> 00:14:28.090
like nobody catches the flu from eating pussy.
You know what I mean?

265
00:14:28.091 --> 00:14:33.091
Like you get like specific diseases from sex sexually transmitted to the Michael

266
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.580
Douglas got that weird one from eating so much box where he got like throat

267
00:14:36.581 --> 00:14:41.140
cancer.
He says he didn't,
he says that it was bullshit.
Oh really?
Yeah.
Yeah,

268
00:14:41.141 --> 00:14:43.970
there was like,
but it coincided with his divorce so I don't,

269
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.270
I'm not sure if I buy it.
He might've been tried to.

270
00:14:46.271 --> 00:14:50.170
Sweet talk goes way back into Catherine Zeta Jones.
What's her name?

271
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.750
That's her name.
The one,
yeah,
that didn't work out.

272
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:57.710
So they got divorced so maybe it was eating pussy.
If you pull them aside,

273
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.140
I mean come on man.
How much postage eat and oh good Lord.

274
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.550
I'm imagining it's a lot.
I was actually at a dinner party where he was at.

275
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.660
He's the man.

276
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:10.660
Like he's as far as like having just that natural charisma where you just want

277
00:15:10.941 --> 00:15:13.310
to just pull up a seat and listen to them tell a story.

278
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:15.680
Could be about him getting a fucking Starbucks.

279
00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:18.710
It didn't really matter when Michael Douglas was telling a story.
It was like,

280
00:15:18.711 --> 00:15:20.830
whoa man.

281
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:24.950
Including like catastrophic failures as a parent,
you know,

282
00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:29.630
he's got a son that's in jail for drugs that's gotta be like really weird.

283
00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.380
You know,
that,
that,

284
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.730
that often happens with those big time movie star fellows and gals.

285
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.150
They become a big time movie stars and they just don't have enough time to raise

286
00:15:38.151 --> 00:15:39.860
her kids.
And then the kids are around.

287
00:15:39.861 --> 00:15:42.710
These weren't really super unhealthy environments and you know,

288
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:47.740
a lot of like empty pleasure environments and a lack of understanding

289
00:15:48.801 --> 00:15:49.670
discipline.

290
00:15:49.671 --> 00:15:54.671
And then also genetic predisposition to addictions that he had.

291
00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:57.590
And obviously his son Charlie has,
you know,

292
00:15:57.591 --> 00:16:00.290
who knows who other folks in his family might have had as well.

293
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.350
It's a bitter sweet life.
It's challenging.

294
00:16:04.351 --> 00:16:08.330
And I think the way that I look at it is it's,
it's extra pressure.

295
00:16:08.331 --> 00:16:10.880
It's not like it's inevitable that you're going to be fucked up in that

296
00:16:10.881 --> 00:16:12.680
situation,
but it's extra pressure.

297
00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:16.090
And so you have to do extra things to be able to combat that.
You know,

298
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:20.000
you really have to focus on your discipline,
do things like,
you know,

299
00:16:20.001 --> 00:16:23.870
spiritual journeys and meditation and Psychedelics and things that you've got to

300
00:16:23.871 --> 00:16:24.381
say,
listen,

301
00:16:24.381 --> 00:16:27.800
this is going to be the pressure of the world and this situation is going to try

302
00:16:27.801 --> 00:16:28.910
and steer me this way.

303
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:33.080
So I got to overcompensate by working that much harder to make sure I stay

304
00:16:33.081 --> 00:16:35.390
grounded and stay balanced.
But those,
you know,

305
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:38.690
those mechanisms aren't in place and they're not part of mainstream

306
00:16:38.691 --> 00:16:41.830
understanding.
So,
you know,
whereas maybe in 50 years,

307
00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.470
a person like Michael Douglas,
it'd be like,
listen,
here's your 18th birthday.

308
00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:48.140
You're going down to Peru.
I know that Sean Man,
really well,

309
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.370
I'll see you in two weeks.

310
00:16:49.371 --> 00:16:53.060
And then every year thereafter you're doing something else,
you know,
staying in,

311
00:16:53.061 --> 00:16:53.420
uh,

312
00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:57.290
an an osram for two weeks or he's got to know that there's so much pressure that

313
00:16:57.291 --> 00:17:01.370
he can help kind of guide this.
But right now it's just nobody knows that much.

314
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.590
Yeah.
Could you imagine if you grew up,

315
00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:06.140
your dad was a giant movie star and you go on the red carpet holding your dad's

316
00:17:06.141 --> 00:17:10.820
hand and like also you have to live in that Guy Shadow.
Yeah.
You know,

317
00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:15.440
like what are you doing man?
Oh,
you run a bakery.
You're Michael Douglas is kid,

318
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.430
right?
Fucking dad's.
Uh,
he won the Oscar.
I don't even know if he won an Oscar.

319
00:17:19.431 --> 00:17:22.370
I'm sure he did.
One of them,
I'm sure.
Something and another.
Yeah.

320
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:27.530
You know what a fucking weird batch of pressure that is.
You know,
I have friends.

321
00:17:27.531 --> 00:17:31.160
It's debt.
The debt,
their dads are like pretty successful and they still like,

322
00:17:31.161 --> 00:17:33.560
they're adults.
They live under the shadow of their dad.

323
00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.250
Even if they're more successful than their dad.
It's like,
see,
you know,

324
00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:41.310
fucking up past your dad know,

325
00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.720
it's a weird dynamic.
They call that like the oedipal complex,
right?

326
00:17:44.721 --> 00:17:48.230
Where you have that urge to kill your father and it's not literally kill your

327
00:17:48.231 --> 00:17:52.590
father,
but it means to overcome,
you know,
what his,
what his greatness was,

328
00:17:52.591 --> 00:17:52.770
you know,

329
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:56.940
be better than him in some way or another and talk your mom and fuck your
mother.

330
00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.270
Yeah.
That's another,
I don't even know how to explain that part,
but yeah,

331
00:18:00.271 --> 00:18:00.810
but that's,

332
00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:04.890
that's part of this drive to be better than the generation before you,
which is,

333
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:08.640
it's why,
you know,
a lot of times,
even in South America,
the Shamans,
they train,

334
00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:13.050
you know,
father to grandson rather than father to son.

335
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.520
They skip a generation to avoid that kind of power dynamic cause they know it's

336
00:18:17.521 --> 00:18:21.780
going to be kind of fucked up if they're both practicing at the same time.

337
00:18:21.781 --> 00:18:24.390
It's always going to be weird.
That's really clever.
Yeah.

338
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:28.860
That's so clever that they do that.
It was probably out of just sheer necessity,

339
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:29.933
you know,

340
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:33.480
I got a way better relationship with my grandfather and every day with my
father.

341
00:18:33.481 --> 00:18:36.530
Right.
My grandfather likes,
there's no pressure on him.
Exactly.
No,

342
00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:41.070
he'd already raised kids.
I was,
as you know,
his daughters kid,
it was easy.
Yeah.

343
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.350
I hung out with that dude,
went fishing with them and shit,
you know,

344
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.510
and he's not wrapped up in the ego of,
that's my boy.
You know,

345
00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.840
that's a big problem that fathers get caught up in too.

346
00:18:48.841 --> 00:18:52.500
They identify with their children and that becomes part of their identity.

347
00:18:52.501 --> 00:18:56.880
And then they put so much pressure on these kids to for their own benefit rather

348
00:18:56.881 --> 00:19:01.410
than just,
hey,
you're a human,
you know what's best for you,
buddy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

349
00:19:01.411 --> 00:19:03.060
That's real hard for people,
man.

350
00:19:03.061 --> 00:19:07.140
I've seen that with people trying to dictate their children's careers.

351
00:19:07.141 --> 00:19:10.890
And I had a friend and I grew up who was Korean and Korean families.

352
00:19:10.891 --> 00:19:12.210
I don't know if you don't read Korean friends,

353
00:19:12.211 --> 00:19:16.170
but Korean families are incredibly hardworking,

354
00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.170
like incredibly strict,
incredibly disciplined.

355
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:21.600
Like he was one of the most disciplined people I've ever met.

356
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.840
He was on the national taekwondo team when he was going through his,

357
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.400
uh,
he was going through medical school,

358
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:33.240
so he was in the middle of medical school and he was also in the national

359
00:19:33.241 --> 00:19:37.050
taekwondo cans.
Like,
well,
fucking do that man.
I mean,

360
00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:40.950
he won the nationals as a fucking medical student.
This guy,

361
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:44.670
I mean he was studying 16 hours a day and he found time to train.

362
00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:48.630
He would do in between,
uh,
training or in between studying at the library.

363
00:19:48.631 --> 00:19:50.760
He would run stairs at his university.

364
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.970
He would just run the stairs like with this street clothes on.

365
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.970
And that's how he got some of his conditioning in.
Yeah.

366
00:19:56.971 --> 00:20:00.150
I've watched our researcher,
Jared,
as soon as he started medical school,

367
00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.260
it's just,
he was practicing Bjj,
he was living in Brazil,
we met him in Brazil.

368
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.720
He's Kinda stout and he's just killing it in there.

369
00:20:06.721 --> 00:20:11.100
And I've seen the circles get deeper and he's losing weight and he still finds a

370
00:20:11.101 --> 00:20:13.050
little time here and there,
but it's a grind.

371
00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.680
I imagine that anybody thinks it's the way to do it.

372
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.620
I think everybody's just been doing it like that for so long.
But how has it,

373
00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:25.260
how was it possible that they let doctors work these giant long ass shifts

374
00:20:25.261 --> 00:20:30.261
completely exhausted and take care of people's medical issues and possibly fuck

375
00:20:30.451 --> 00:20:35.010
things up because they're exhausted?
Just because of fatigue.
Yeah.

376
00:20:35.011 --> 00:20:35.551
I mean that's,

377
00:20:35.551 --> 00:20:38.940
and it's kind of like that navy seal type of training that they put you through

378
00:20:38.941 --> 00:20:41.770
enough pressure in medical school or in buds training as,

379
00:20:41.771 --> 00:20:44.910
as it is for the navy seals that they can trust you and battle with people's

380
00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:46.230
lives on the line.
You know?

381
00:20:46.231 --> 00:20:49.390
And I think that's why they make medical school that hard.
You know,

382
00:20:49.391 --> 00:20:52.030
it's like a gauntlet that if you pass this motherfucker,

383
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.910
then you'll be able to handle these long shifts.
Especially,
you know,

384
00:20:54.911 --> 00:20:57.460
when you're interning at a hospital and doing all those,

385
00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:01.780
I think it's probably the right move for seals.
Right.
But for doctors,

386
00:21:01.781 --> 00:21:04.920
I just feel like,
Jesus,
why don't you have more doctors?
You know,

387
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:08.380
why don't you have extra doctors instead of making one guy work 18 hours a

388
00:21:08.381 --> 00:21:12.910
fucking day.
My friend Steve,
I think you met Steve Graham,
Dr Steve.

389
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.720
He was,
we were,
uh,
when we were friends in Boston.

390
00:21:16.721 --> 00:21:18.650
He was going through his residency and a,

391
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:23.750
and he was an ophthalmologist and he told me that he was on the toilet taking a

392
00:21:24.731 --> 00:21:27.820
shit with a tray of food in his lap.

393
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:32.400
He fell asleep and his buzzer went off and that's when he realized like,

394
00:21:32.401 --> 00:21:35.170
like what the fuck am I doing with my life?
Yeah.

395
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:40.240
He fell asleep on the toilet while he was eating and the Buzzer,

396
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.970
his pager,
it was back when we had pagers.
Doctors.

397
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:45.840
I think doctors still have page or some of them I think they actually do there.

398
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.180
That's still,
they're the only ones that pager drug dealers and the doctors.

399
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.970
Can you trace people two pagers?
No,
you can't.

400
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.770
There's no fucking payphones anymore.

401
00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.470
So if you're a drug dealer and you're trying to do things on the street,

402
00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.400
like you have to have a toss guy forgot burners.
You gotta have a burner phone.

403
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.170
How long before they make those drug dealers and adulterers?
I am cricket phones.

404
00:22:05.171 --> 00:22:08.350
All Day.
Yeah.
How many people like by those legitimately,

405
00:22:08.351 --> 00:22:10.990
how many people like buy burner phones and like can I just like,

406
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.860
I like this phone.
This is my fault.
No,
nobody,
no.
Seven,
11 phones.

407
00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.780
That doesn't happen.
You know,
one thing about doctors,

408
00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.970
people give doctors a hard time,
especially,
you know,

409
00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.140
because of this medical crisis that we're in,

410
00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:27.220
but I really don't think it's the doctor's fault.
They're trained to,
you know,

411
00:22:27.221 --> 00:22:30.580
they're trained to follow clinical research,
you know,
and they do that really,

412
00:22:30.581 --> 00:22:33.260
really well.
They follow the clinical research.
The problem is,

413
00:22:33.261 --> 00:22:36.370
is that the people funding clinical research have a vested interest.

414
00:22:36.371 --> 00:22:40.270
They're researching products that they want to sell.
They're not researching,
hey,

415
00:22:40.271 --> 00:22:43.630
let's see what happens if we feed this guy a natural diet,
you know,

416
00:22:43.631 --> 00:22:45.280
and do that against placebo.
Well,

417
00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:48.490
that's a couple of hundred grand that nobody's paying for it because nobody's

418
00:22:48.491 --> 00:22:51.160
making any money off that,
you know?
So there's not,

419
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:55.120
there's an absence of clinical research showing these other kind of functional

420
00:22:55.121 --> 00:22:58.480
medicine and nonprofit ways that people can get healthy.

421
00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.840
And I think that really when you're looking at,
you know,

422
00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:04.360
kind of correcting some of the issues in medicine,
that's what needs to happen.

423
00:23:04.361 --> 00:23:08.800
Big nonprofit groups need to get together and start funding clinical trials for

424
00:23:08.801 --> 00:23:12.700
these things that have no profitability,
profitable viability.
You know,

425
00:23:12.701 --> 00:23:15.610
just studying healthy diets,
studying,
you know,

426
00:23:15.611 --> 00:23:19.810
what happens if you float for every day for six weeks studying what happens when

427
00:23:19.811 --> 00:23:23.320
you do all of these other things that you can't possibly make money off of.

428
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.480
And I think that's going to make a big difference.
That is,

429
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:29.080
and it's also tried talking to a doctor about something that's outside of his

430
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.570
wheelhouse and you know,
you're gonna get a lot of,
you know,

431
00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.230
like what do you think about,
you know,

432
00:23:33.231 --> 00:23:36.640
you ask a doctor about meditation or Oh yeah,
you know,

433
00:23:36.641 --> 00:23:39.010
that's not going to fucking busy man.

434
00:23:39.011 --> 00:23:42.660
And he's got 18 different patients waiting in his office and that's not as fuel

435
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.980
to study and you can't possibly know everything about the human

436
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.250
<v 0>body when it comes to every single function of the human body.</v>

437
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:53.490
All the different mechanisms involves and absorbing nutrients and absorbing like

438
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:57.950
the,
the,
the,
the different things that can go wrong in various organs.

439
00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.650
Like you specialize,
they specialize for reason.

440
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:04.040
There's a reason why I foot doctors aren't also neurosurgeons.
You know,

441
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:09.380
you can't be,
you can't be,
and it's,
it's sort of analogous to life.
Like in life,

442
00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:13.670
you can't know everything about everything in life and doctors just most,

443
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:16.880
you run into a lot of doctors,
you don't want to trade bodies with them.

444
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.760
They go like you're a doctor.
Like you're,

445
00:24:19.761 --> 00:24:24.590
you're a guy who's supposed to be like managing like the health and wellness of

446
00:24:24.591 --> 00:24:28.250
these people that are in your care at least as far as fixing them when shit goes

447
00:24:28.251 --> 00:24:32.960
wrong.
But you've got a pot belly and you don't have an ass like you.
You're,

448
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:35.300
you're,
you have bad posture,
your,

449
00:24:35.301 --> 00:24:39.250
your necklace kind of slumped forward like in your doctor and you're you,

450
00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:42.080
so you're not on the ball with everything either.
No one is,

451
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:47.230
it's literally a virtual impossibility to be complete as it,

452
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:52.040
as far as your education about the entire human body and every single organ and

453
00:24:52.041 --> 00:24:55.370
everything that can go wrong and everything that you could do right to prevent

454
00:24:55.371 --> 00:24:59.030
all these things from going wrong and to really have a deep knowledge in the

455
00:24:59.031 --> 00:25:04.031
benefits of all these different things like yoga and meditation and Super

456
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:07.310
Healthy,
you know,
nutrient rich diets.
You got to do it.

457
00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:08.630
You have to actually do that.

458
00:25:08.631 --> 00:25:12.110
You have to have a shitty like rich roll who's going to be on the podcast again

459
00:25:12.111 --> 00:25:15.920
soon.
Uh,
I've had him in the past and he's a ultra marathon runner.

460
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:20.060
He'll became this like fucking health and wellness fanatic and he used to eat

461
00:25:20.061 --> 00:25:24.710
shit food at a terrible diet and then started like juicing beets and eating

462
00:25:24.711 --> 00:25:26.960
healthy vegetables in his whole body was like,
what's going on?

463
00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:30.860
And he looked described like one day where he just got out and just started

464
00:25:30.861 --> 00:25:34.310
running.
Like he had so much energy,
he just started running.
Well,

465
00:25:34.311 --> 00:25:37.130
it takes a guy like that to give you,

466
00:25:37.131 --> 00:25:39.710
I mean obviously it's an anecdotal experience.

467
00:25:39.711 --> 00:25:43.700
It's this one guys take on what happened.
But those,

468
00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:48.500
those stories are super important to say that you know that that is,

469
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:52.880
if you really do change your diet and throw a bunch of healthy,

470
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:57.150
like really low fat meats and high,
you know,

471
00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:01.970
like high nutrient vegetables and eat really healthy foods,

472
00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:04.670
you will feel different.
Like you're,
your way,

473
00:26:04.671 --> 00:26:07.880
you interface with the world will feel different.
Yeah.

474
00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:10.040
Eat a lot of Avocados and coconut oil.

475
00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:14.650
Get those healthy fats for your brain and you feel different about it.

476
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:18.640
It's not gonna fucking aesthetic thing.
It's not like,
oh,

477
00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.300
I to look good on the beach when the store myself,

478
00:26:20.301 --> 00:26:22.250
that's not even healthy looking at her.
It's just not even healthy.

479
00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.920
Like I saw this photo,
these chicks were bombing on this girl.

480
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:29.060
It was hilarious because it was a girl who was just thin.
She's just thin.

481
00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.250
She didn't look like she was anorexic at all,

482
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:36.260
but all these women were shitting on her body like,
Oh God,

483
00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:40.940
get her a sandwich.
Oh God.
She's too thin.
Like that's,
she has a thin bones man.

484
00:26:40.941 --> 00:26:42.830
You look at this girl like that's how she's built,

485
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:45.000
but nobody wants to accept that.
They want to,

486
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.340
they want to think that there's something wrong with this girl.

487
00:26:47.341 --> 00:26:50.820
You're supposed to be overflowing over the top of your fucking jeans.

488
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
You're supposed to have like big floppy meat bags in between your legs that

489
00:26:56.131 --> 00:26:58.950
rubbed.
The other one's easier to think that.
Then they go the other way.

490
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:00.510
She's not healthy.

491
00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:06.770
<v 1>The best doctor I know is his doctor ingle and we work with them and on it and</v>

492
00:27:06.771 --> 00:27:11.480
so he was trained as a psychiatrist,
clinical forensic child,
psycho psychiatry,

493
00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:15.770
God,
his MD,
and then was like,
ah,
I don't really think this is the whole picture.

494
00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.260
So I was just like,
all right,
I'm going to go completely the other way.

495
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:23.500
Went down to South America and did 40 sessions of Iowasca in 60 nights and did

496
00:27:23.661 --> 00:27:26.960
way too much like,
like fried himself to certain degrees.

497
00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.980
So then he had to go live in a tent for a little while to figure some shit out.

498
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.690
He's like,
I was way too much.

499
00:27:32.691 --> 00:27:36.080
So he lived in a tent for an inland for like a year and then he started studying

500
00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:37.790
different kinds of functional medicine.

501
00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:41.090
But he put himself in the lab with all these things.
Sometimes he screwed up,

502
00:27:41.091 --> 00:27:44.060
sometimes he got it right,
but now he's able to combine.

503
00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:48.260
The best part of Western medicine is MD.
The best part of you know,

504
00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:50.630
the shamanistic practices from South America,

505
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:54.270
the best part of functional medicine and natural medicine and kind of put it all

506
00:27:54.271 --> 00:27:55.310
together.
And that's,

507
00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:59.120
that's where the doctors can become great because maybe they're not specialists,

508
00:27:59.121 --> 00:28:03.470
but the problem with specialists is everything in the body is interconnected and

509
00:28:03.471 --> 00:28:06.140
related.
So if you're only specializing in one thing,

510
00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:09.440
you're going to focus on that potentially to the detriment of the rest of your

511
00:28:09.441 --> 00:28:10.100
body.

512
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:14.060
So having that at least basic understanding of the connection between all of the

513
00:28:14.061 --> 00:28:17.030
parts of the body is incredibly valuable for a doctor.

514
00:28:17.031 --> 00:28:19.250
And then also putting themselves through all the thing.

515
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:22.070
How are you going to talk shit on what [inaudible] can do unless you've done it?

516
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.030
You know,
like there's no way to know like what that experience is.

517
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:28.100
Same with prescribing these drugs.
You know,

518
00:28:28.101 --> 00:28:30.980
it's like you're prescribing drugs that you've never even taken.

519
00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:33.590
Like how are you,
how do you know what this is going to do to somebody?

520
00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:36.500
It's a weird kind of place that we're in right now.

521
00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:40.000
<v 0>Well,
uh,
I have a friend,
um,
you have some of that fell.
It's good for you.</v>

522
00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:42.760
I have a friend,
um,
who,
uh,

523
00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:47.820
her husband went over to Germany for artificial disc replacement and I'm like,

524
00:28:48.881 --> 00:28:51.160
he's,
he's fucked.
Like his back is fucked.

525
00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.620
And so they replaced a bunch of his disks

526
00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:59.590
and he's way better now.
Yeah.
Like way better than I skiing again.

527
00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.000
Like because his back was fucked.

528
00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:03.550
And apparently they have these discs in Germany,

529
00:29:03.551 --> 00:29:06.160
these artificial disks that they just can't sell in America.

530
00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.000
You just can't sell them.
Nope.
That's not ready yet.
For whatever reason.
It'd be,

531
00:29:10.001 --> 00:29:11.660
maybe there's a good reason.
I mean,
maybe they're,

532
00:29:11.661 --> 00:29:16.330
they're worth more thorough over here and maybe they prevent people from having

533
00:29:16.331 --> 00:29:19.060
to get those old silicon breast implants pulled out.

534
00:29:19.061 --> 00:29:23.470
Like have that kind of shit cops that given you fucking Lupus or some shit.

535
00:29:23.471 --> 00:29:27.250
And that happens.
People get autoimmune disorders because their tits leak.
Yeah.

536
00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:32.200
But these,
these discs,
a Braulio esteem.
I've got one in his neck.

537
00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:37.290
He had a Jujitsu injury and a really bad neck injury where he's temporarily

538
00:29:39.461 --> 00:29:42.070
paralyzed and the whole deal went and got

539
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:46.800
<v 2>his disc replaced,
fought,
won the world championships afterwards.
His,
uh,</v>

540
00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:48.980
fighting MMA afterwards.
I mean,

541
00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.920
he's gone through this incredibly devastating injury and with an artificial disc

542
00:29:53.921 --> 00:29:57.640
in his neck,
still getting yanked on.
He's still getting choked.
Not that often.

543
00:29:57.641 --> 00:29:59.650
He's pretty fucking good.
He doesn't really get choked very often.

544
00:29:59.651 --> 00:30:02.800
But the point being,
he's got full functionality and so there's this guy,

545
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:06.370
this guy had discs,
fused in his back,
went to Germany,
they open all that shit up.

546
00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.170
Unfused as disks I guess.

547
00:30:08.171 --> 00:30:11.470
I Dunno if they did that and they put these artificial discs in place and now

548
00:30:11.471 --> 00:30:14.280
he's fucking moving around like crazy.
But they canceled.

549
00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.820
But I was talking to my doctor about it.
I go,

550
00:30:15.821 --> 00:30:18.610
so why they don't do that in America?
You can't do it in America,

551
00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:21.160
but do you recommend it?
He goes,
I definitely recommend it.
Like they,

552
00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:22.480
if you have the funds,

553
00:30:22.481 --> 00:30:25.420
like if someone that has got a really fucked up back and they have the funds,

554
00:30:25.421 --> 00:30:27.520
he's like,
yeah,
they like it's worth doing.

555
00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.130
And it's not like Germany is a free for all and a lot of things.

556
00:30:30.131 --> 00:30:31.640
They're even more strict than us.
I mean,
I,

557
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:35.140
I'm pretty sure all vitamins or pharmaceuticals pretty much in Germany.

558
00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:39.640
Like we can't sell shit in Germany because like they control everything very

559
00:30:39.641 --> 00:30:44.540
carefully out there.
So,
you know,
describe them though.
At least vitamins.

560
00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.540
Yeah,
I dunno.
I mean,
I'm not an expert on that,

561
00:30:46.541 --> 00:30:48.790
but I know the prohibition for us sending anything,

562
00:30:48.791 --> 00:30:51.390
even our vitamin C supplements in there like,
no,
nope,
nope.

563
00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:56.980
That's a pharmaceutical.
Why?
Whoa,
whoa,
that's crazy.
But yeah,

564
00:30:56.981 --> 00:31:01.150
I mean,
well that's what they invented that Regena keen,
which I'm a giant fan of.

565
00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:03.610
You know,
I've had that done several times now.
Man,

566
00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:08.150
you want to talk about something that just cuts your injury like the,

567
00:31:08.151 --> 00:31:11.980
the recovery diet time down radically.
It's very expensive,

568
00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:14.860
but if you have something that's really fucking with you and nagging injury,

569
00:31:14.861 --> 00:31:19.630
oftentimes it just nips that shit in the bud and it's available finally in

570
00:31:19.631 --> 00:31:22.750
America.
But insurance doesn't cover it.
You have to pay for it yourself.

571
00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:26.800
It's like what is the shirts like why doesn't this?
And they like it's off label.

572
00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:30.550
Like what does this mean?
Like I'm not,
I'm not complaining that it's here.

573
00:31:30.551 --> 00:31:33.340
I'm happy that at least you could use it because you still can't do the

574
00:31:33.341 --> 00:31:34.930
artificial discs or any of that other shit,

575
00:31:34.931 --> 00:31:36.940
but it's going to come a point in time where you've got to go.

576
00:31:36.941 --> 00:31:40.350
Is this the most efficient system?
Yeah,
no doubt.
I,

577
00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:45.410
I think really we're at a really cool time where all kinds of new shit is coming

578
00:31:45.461 --> 00:31:48.460
out and it's going to be like the best of what technology can do.

579
00:31:48.461 --> 00:31:52.600
And I think the next big piece is going to become and harnessing what the mind

580
00:31:52.601 --> 00:31:53.190
can do.

581
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:55.810
And I was doing a little bit of research because I'm doing a lot of writing now.

582
00:31:56.050 --> 00:32:00.430
And there was a study published in 2002 where they took 180 patients and they

583
00:32:00.431 --> 00:32:05.431
gave half of them a fake placebo knee surgery and the other half arthroscopic

584
00:32:05.531 --> 00:32:06.970
knee surgery.
Right.
And,

585
00:32:06.971 --> 00:32:09.040
but everybody thought they were getting real knee surgery.

586
00:32:09.041 --> 00:32:11.540
So it was placebo controlled knee surgery.
Whoa.

587
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:14.740
And the results were absolutely on par.

588
00:32:14.741 --> 00:32:17.590
The people who got placebo controlled knee surgery,
we're cruising around,

589
00:32:17.591 --> 00:32:18.670
they are walking around fine.

590
00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:20.980
And people who got actual arthroscopic knee surgery,

591
00:32:20.981 --> 00:32:23.980
we're also doing a lot better as well.
Wow.
So I mean,

592
00:32:23.981 --> 00:32:26.980
and that's something that isn't tested very often in surgery cause people don't

593
00:32:26.981 --> 00:32:31.000
think,
how do you do a placebo surgery?
Well they've done,
they've done that with,

594
00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:35.710
there's a study in 1950s that did it with a particular type of heart surgery

595
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.740
where people,
they gave people placebo,
heart surgery in surgery.

596
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.300
<v 1>The results were on par.
And so I think understanding how much that plays in,</v>

597
00:32:44.301 --> 00:32:47.060
in fact,
because if you go to surgery and you come out and you're all right,

598
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:50.150
you think you're fixed,
you know like man,
the doctors were in there,

599
00:32:50.151 --> 00:32:52.880
they know shit.
They were cutting shit up there soaking it up.
I'm good.

600
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:57.950
So that placebo effect,
even in surgery is dramatic.
It's huge.

601
00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:01.700
And I think really the frontiers of medicine are going to be harnessing the

602
00:33:01.701 --> 00:33:05.980
stuff that really does work and had benefit and then us tapping into these late

603
00:33:05.981 --> 00:33:10.981
and resources in our mind and using belief to help speed up and facilitate even

604
00:33:11.241 --> 00:33:12.950
additional healing.
That's amazing.

605
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:13.821
<v 0>The other hand,</v>

606
00:33:13.821 --> 00:33:18.821
I really appreciate the fact that there's steps that people have to go through

607
00:33:18.831 --> 00:33:23.831
before they can sell a pharmaceutical drug because we've all been aware of

608
00:33:24.231 --> 00:33:28.220
someone and close to us for something that that had an adverse effect of some

609
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.730
pharmaceutical drug that you see on those late night commercials where you one

610
00:33:31.731 --> 00:33:36.731
of the ones who took Vioxx or Fen Phen Phen Phen God damn sign that fuck

611
00:33:38.241 --> 00:33:40.910
people's hearts up.
Like for life.

612
00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:44.870
Like there's people that have like fucking tricky hearts now because of some

613
00:33:44.871 --> 00:33:49.100
diet pills to lose fat butt and your life.
Yeah,
man.

614
00:33:49.101 --> 00:33:53.030
I know a dude who had a stroke because he was taking Guy Metzger,
UFC fighters,

615
00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:56.660
former champion,
a great fighter.
Great Guy Too.
Really cool.

616
00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:00.410
Can you get it fucking stroke from Vioxx,
Dude,
he,

617
00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:03.320
he's taking the shit for arthritis in his knees and all a sudden he starts

618
00:34:03.321 --> 00:34:07.850
slurring his words and everyone's like,
I'm guy,
something's going on.

619
00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.060
And they take them in,
they find out he got a stroke,
you know,

620
00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:15.950
and on top of a lifelong career of a MMA fighting,

621
00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:19.640
he was actually talking about some interesting therapy that he's going through.

622
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.610
Something that's really benefited him,
benefited as bell,

623
00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:27.470
see if he could pull that up.
A Guy Medsker I don't have a laptop in front of me,

624
00:34:27.471 --> 00:34:31.970
but guide Medsker discusses brain trauma video.

625
00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:34.010
It's really interesting,
first of all,

626
00:34:34.011 --> 00:34:38.480
because Guy Metzger who is a pioneer,
I mean I was,

627
00:34:38.481 --> 00:34:42.710
I called one of his fights when I was a early UFC fights in 97 you know,

628
00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:47.360
I've known that guy for a long time.
He's always been like a super stand up,

629
00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:50.210
looks like a movie star,
looks like a hero in a movie.

630
00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.640
He's been just a cool dude like always.

631
00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:58.060
And even in this situation it's really cool because he's super honest about how

632
00:34:58.551 --> 00:34:59.590
we,
how we feel.

633
00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:02.780
It's like how he feels physically as opposed to how it used to feel and like

634
00:35:02.781 --> 00:35:06.260
what was going wrong.
And he talked about the improvements that he had.

635
00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:09.410
It's hilarious actually because he talks about the improvements that he has.

636
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.981
Like,
you know,

637
00:35:09.981 --> 00:35:14.540
he's talking about brain trauma from fighting and then a stroke and then later

638
00:35:14.541 --> 00:35:17.450
on he's talking about now he can spar again.

639
00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.480
He's firing with some fucking young whipper snapper.

640
00:35:20.481 --> 00:35:23.570
They came into the gym and the doctor's like,
what the fuck are you doing?

641
00:35:23.571 --> 00:35:24.920
He's don't worry,
you didn't hit me.
He's like,

642
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:29.260
you're in their fucking sparring man.
But for,
you know,

643
00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:32.580
he's a world champion when you're,
when you're a guy like guy masquerade,

644
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:35.540
like legit striking skills to it.
Really it's fun for him

645
00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.980
<v 1>like being a chess master and being able to play chess</v>

646
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.340
<v 0>anymore.
Yeah man.
So where he gets his jollies is this it?
Oh No,</v>

647
00:35:41.341 --> 00:35:43.250
I'm still asking you.
Let me see.
Play it in a,

648
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:47.880
well I'll tell you if it is soft spot.
Yeah,
this is it.
You want to be able to um,

649
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:52.180
<v 4>Moran without your cane especially that's with brain injuries.</v>

650
00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.430
I don't believe we do enough to be honest.

651
00:35:54.431 --> 00:35:59.110
I think we give a lot of lip service to helping our vets but had a lot of
action.

652
00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:00.970
So that's gurus changing bat.

653
00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:03.880
Well we offer here is a class and then start getting in shape.

654
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.810
It's a different thing.

655
00:36:04.811 --> 00:36:08.480
But this is cool that he's doing that and brain injury at is keep your hands up

656
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:12.730
son.
We run it through,
he's in Addison,

657
00:36:12.731 --> 00:36:17.560
Texas man class working alongside the carrot brain centers and Irving.

658
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:22.090
Yeah,
that's for knows what a brain injury does to a person has one too.

659
00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.990
I had a 17 year long professional fight career and I had a medicine induced

660
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:27.700
stroke and I have a brain tumor.

661
00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.940
Metzker believes the combat training and then it works for him.

662
00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:35.840
We'll make our military heroes healthier and happier when we've had it attached

663
00:36:35.841 --> 00:36:40.330
to these guys.
Back to that,
that element that made them become,
you know,

664
00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:44.260
soldiers in the first place for Texans with character.
I'm Tracy Cornet.
Yep.

665
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:46.680
<v 0>This is a different thing.
See if you could find the other one.</v>

666
00:36:46.681 --> 00:36:49.860
Cause the other one,
he details his therapy that he went through that uh,

667
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:50.760
helped him.

668
00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:54.840
But that's cool that you could see from that video what kind of a guy he is.

669
00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:59.520
You know?
So what was important was that he was,
um,

670
00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:02.730
he was talking about it in like this really honest way.

671
00:37:02.731 --> 00:37:06.270
Like his bounces off fucked up.
He wasn't trying to shield himself like,
Hey,

672
00:37:06.271 --> 00:37:08.610
I still got it.
Don't worry about that.
Yeah.
You know,
he was,

673
00:37:08.611 --> 00:37:13.611
he was being like real humble and honest about the state that he's in there

674
00:37:13.621 --> 00:37:16.260
making some headway with brain trauma.
It's interesting.

675
00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:18.690
I have some therapies that are effective,
no doubt,

676
00:37:18.691 --> 00:37:22.590
and I think it's going to come from a basket of really curious at this point.

677
00:37:22.591 --> 00:37:25.050
You know everybody,
it's not going to be one magic bullet.

678
00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:27.450
It's going to be a variety of different things that,
yeah,

679
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.680
and stacking these modalities like CBD has some potential hit your nasal

680
00:37:31.681 --> 00:37:32.251
lyposomal.

681
00:37:32.251 --> 00:37:37.020
Glutathione has the potential floating has some potential microdosing siliciden

682
00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:40.650
might apps and potential.
There's been shown some neurogenesis that comes from,

683
00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:44.460
from that,
but all of these things that were,
that are disparate right now.

684
00:37:44.461 --> 00:37:48.410
I think ultimately maybe when put together might be the solution.
Yeah.

685
00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:52.050
That's the solution,
right?
The solution is,
it's not an either or thing.

686
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.620
It's not have you have to go the conventional route with pharmaceutical drugs

687
00:37:55.621 --> 00:38:00.190
and a doctor's prescription or you go the fruitcake route with holistic
medicine.

688
00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:03.720
You're doing yoga and eating fucking Kelp.
It doesn't have to be.

689
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:06.090
It can be all the good stuff,
all the good stuff,

690
00:38:06.091 --> 00:38:09.040
the good stuff that seems woo woo.
Like,
you know,

691
00:38:09.041 --> 00:38:12.720
you talked to people who do couldn't Daleney Yoga.
Yeah.
Like that's,
I,

692
00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.180
I knew this lady.
She's a sweetheart.

693
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:17.240
I still know her and she's a Kundalini teacher and cheese.

694
00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.700
She blazing hot cause a lot of credit.
She was at one point in time,

695
00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:23.970
I mean she's still attractive but she's an older woman.
Right.
But um,

696
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:27.240
she was beautiful when she was young.
She's beautiful now.
I love her.

697
00:38:27.241 --> 00:38:30.360
She's a good person.
But my point is I don't want to disparage her in any way.

698
00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:34.080
She's so we'll,
we'll,
yeah,
she's so whoa,
whoa.
It's fucking crazy.

699
00:38:34.081 --> 00:38:36.040
Like you can't talk to her,
but anything like she makes you,

700
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.520
like you go onto her property if you go to,
to where her house is,

701
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:44.430
she makes you like stand in a certain place and say your blessings and,
and,

702
00:38:44.431 --> 00:38:47.640
and like ask for,
ask for the,
the,
uh,

703
00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:51.460
the earth in the woods to embrace you.
I can,
she's not bullshitting man.

704
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:53.650
She really means that,
you know,
and she,

705
00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:58.210
she will tell you that like Kundalini Yoga and like this practice of yoga is

706
00:38:58.211 --> 00:39:02.980
like changed her being changed who she is as an individual now let's say like,

707
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:07.600
oh,
she's some woo woo crazy bitch with all due respect with love,
crazy bitch.

708
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:08.770
I call myself crazy bitch.

709
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:13.270
But my then my friend Denny got into it and then he proper Co's and Denny,

710
00:39:13.271 --> 00:39:14.640
you know,
Denny Denny,
uh,

711
00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:18.970
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt world champion as a brown belt.
Nogi Jujitsu me,

712
00:39:18.971 --> 00:39:22.690
he's a bad motherfucker and a very good friend and he's not a bullshit artist at

713
00:39:22.691 --> 00:39:23.524
anything.
Nope.

714
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:27.160
And he started getting deep into Quinn Delaney and he started doing it every day

715
00:39:27.161 --> 00:39:29.500
and he said,
dude,
I'm tripping balls.
He goes,

716
00:39:29.501 --> 00:39:34.090
I'm telling you when I'm in full Kundalini mode because Denny super disciplined

717
00:39:34.091 --> 00:39:37.420
and the type of discipline that you need to be a high level competitive

718
00:39:37.421 --> 00:39:41.980
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt is the same kind of discipline that if applied to

719
00:39:41.981 --> 00:39:46.981
yoga and I like a constant attention and focus on achieving these states.

720
00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:52.210
I now believe that all the stuff that I used to think was horse shit.
I mean,

721
00:39:52.211 --> 00:39:54.220
it's really kind of egotistical that I thought,

722
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:57.820
I just thought there was too much.
There's so much shenanigans going on.
I mean,

723
00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:01.880
well for whatever reason I would hear people talk about these yoga states where

724
00:40:01.881 --> 00:40:06.790
they would achieve full on DMT realm states and I'd be like,
sure you did.

725
00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:10.180
You know,
it just,
I just didn't believe him.
I thought they were like,

726
00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:14.890
you know how people eat Vegan food always tell you it tastes amazing right there

727
00:40:14.891 --> 00:40:16.300
always.
It's like,
Eh,
it's never like,

728
00:40:16.301 --> 00:40:20.230
it's kind of cardboardy but chicken with the apostrophe tastes just like
chicken.

729
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:21.071
But you know what I'm saying?

730
00:40:21.071 --> 00:40:25.960
It's like they're overly enthusiastic to the point where their opinion or their,

731
00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:30.610
their taste is not,
it's,
you don't consider it without reservation.
But Danny,

732
00:40:30.611 --> 00:40:33.010
I consider him without reservation.
I know him so well,

733
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:35.650
so he tells me he's hitting these states.
I was like,
whoa.

734
00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:40.510
<v 1>Yeah,
I mean the Kundalini Yoga is a,
I think,
well first of all,</v>

735
00:40:40.511 --> 00:40:44.050
the problem that a lot of people have is they stack extra shit on top of the

736
00:40:44.051 --> 00:40:46.570
good stuff.
That's just complete nonsense.
Right?

737
00:40:46.571 --> 00:40:48.700
And that how that makes you want to discard the whole thing.

738
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.050
Like some of this woman's other practices were probably the majority of why you

739
00:40:53.051 --> 00:40:54.780
went,
man,
everything you're doing is whack.

740
00:40:54.781 --> 00:40:57.490
Cause I know some of this is whack and I think that's an issue you make.

741
00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:01.300
But the actual Kundalini Yoga,
I had a podcast with a former navy seal,

742
00:41:01.301 --> 00:41:05.970
this Guy Michael Vega and he was on 11 different pharmaceuticals and,

743
00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.970
and that's another big problem in the military as they really overprescribe

744
00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:14.440
psychological meds for these,
these people and the interactions can be a problem.

745
00:41:14.441 --> 00:41:18.340
But she was on 11 couldn't sleep full PTSD,
totally fucked up.

746
00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:20.980
And then his process was exactly the same.

747
00:41:20.981 --> 00:41:23.560
He stopped taking the meds and started doing Kundalini Yoga,

748
00:41:23.561 --> 00:41:26.530
which he stumbled upon and he's actually out here.

749
00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:30.460
And that was the key for him to reverse his PTSD.

750
00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:34.280
And this is an old navy seal,
like a real deal combat that,

751
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:38.690
<v 0>you know,
in the shit kind of guy.
And that's the method that worked.
You know,</v>

752
00:41:38.691 --> 00:41:41.870
it kind of makes sense if you think about it because that applies to almost

753
00:41:41.871 --> 00:41:42.830
everything else.

754
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:47.150
That there's someone out there that does it so well that if you experienced them

755
00:41:47.151 --> 00:41:51.620
doing it,
you go,
oh,
now I get it.
You know what I mean?
Like we've all seen that.

756
00:41:51.621 --> 00:41:54.800
Like I've never taken any music lessons at all,

757
00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:57.610
but I have friends that play guitar and um,

758
00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:59.990
I had a friend that would play classical guitar.

759
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:05.360
I do flamencos and shit and he would grow his finger narrows long and shit like

760
00:42:05.361 --> 00:42:08.900
the whole deal and held up like put nail Polish over him and he would,

761
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.260
he was my friend from the time we were like 15.
And um,

762
00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:15.590
he would go crazy with this fucking guitar.

763
00:42:15.591 --> 00:42:19.760
You could see his fingers move when he played this crazy flamenco music and you

764
00:42:19.761 --> 00:42:21.140
would realize that it's possible.

765
00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:26.680
But until I had saw him do it like with my fucking fat stupid fingers and like I

766
00:42:27.351 --> 00:42:31.910
don't,
I guess you could get there,
but I never seen anybody get there.
You know,

767
00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:35.390
you've got to see it.
And it's the same with martial arts.

768
00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:40.420
I remember being a kid like watching like black belts for the first time,

769
00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:44.060
watching people throw kicks and watching people like this guy's pacifically,

770
00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:45.650
this Guy John Lee and watched him.

771
00:42:45.651 --> 00:42:48.590
I remember watching him hit the bag and now knowing that that was possible,

772
00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.590
whether that was in my mind,
it would those the what he was doing though,

773
00:42:51.591 --> 00:42:54.950
the amount of power that he had and the speed that he had and the execution,

774
00:42:54.951 --> 00:42:57.980
the perfect technique didn't exist in my head.
There was no,

775
00:42:57.981 --> 00:43:00.340
there was no model for it,
you know?
So the,

776
00:43:00.341 --> 00:43:03.980
to watch someone do it in the flesh was all a sudden I was like,
Whoa,

777
00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:07.280
this is a real thing.
Like this is possible.
You can achieve that level.

778
00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:11.150
Whereas you take the average person and tell them to go kick something,

779
00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:12.350
it's going to look ridiculous.

780
00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:17.150
But this guy had it all polished down to this tornado move.

781
00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.340
Why Am Wham?
And he just,

782
00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:23.390
he just had the motions down and it was fascinating to watch.

783
00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:24.860
And so because of that,

784
00:43:24.861 --> 00:43:29.150
like I aspire to achieve a similar level proficiency that this guy had.

785
00:43:29.151 --> 00:43:31.610
There was like,
my goal is to get as good as John Lee.

786
00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:36.140
And so when you look at coon Daleney Yoga,
it's gotta be the same thing.

787
00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:39.500
It's gotta be any it with every discipline there's,
you get better at it.

788
00:43:39.501 --> 00:43:41.690
Every time I do yoga,
I get a little bit better at it.

789
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:45.610
Every time I hit poses I get a little better.
I can go into it deeper.
I,

790
00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:50.110
my body is more comfortable there.
I just,
I set into it better.

791
00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:53.360
My balance is better.
And you got to think that I'm not doing it that often.

792
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:55.550
You've got to think these motherfuckers that are doing it every day,

793
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:59.090
they're getting to these crazy places.
And I'm not doing Kundalini Yoga.

794
00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:01.670
I'm doing just like just stretching and all that kind of,

795
00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:04.370
I don't know what you would even call it like with the discipline is,

796
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:09.470
but the coon Delaney is specifically designed according to Denny to try to

797
00:44:09.471 --> 00:44:13.850
stimulate these psychedelic states and what they're using is breath and you
know,

798
00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:16.190
you can get that in a variety of different ways.

799
00:44:16.191 --> 00:44:18.620
And the other thing that I've done,
it's called holotropic breathing,

800
00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:22.370
which is pretty much like Kundalini yoga without the yoga aspect.

801
00:44:22.371 --> 00:44:24.530
And Kundalini Yoga has very little to do with stretching.

802
00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:28.420
It's mostly getting in postures and breathing really,
you know,

803
00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:32.520
deep breaths frequently and kind of draw it visualizing

804
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:36.420
<v 2>and some visualization,
visualizing,
drawing energy up from your Kundalini Center,</v>

805
00:44:36.421 --> 00:44:39.060
which is the base of your body.
And then doing these Breathworks.

806
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:42.780
And I've felt what,
what can happen when you're in these,
you know,

807
00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:46.350
hyper oxygenated states and it's really,
really powerful.

808
00:44:46.351 --> 00:44:48.960
I haven't done the Kundalini Yoga and like a proper session.

809
00:44:48.961 --> 00:44:51.930
I've just done it a little bit where you kind of bounce up and down and you're

810
00:44:51.931 --> 00:44:55.530
breathing getting these things,
but it's accessing that same mechanism,

811
00:44:55.531 --> 00:45:00.030
which is basically flooding your body with oxygen and creating these seemingly

812
00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:04.710
psychedelic states.
Yeah,
seemingly mommy and they are psychedelic.
I mean,

813
00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:07.860
I would like to see some studies done on what's going on when you're doing that

814
00:45:07.861 --> 00:45:10.290
holotropic breathing,
like if you hit like a peak,

815
00:45:10.291 --> 00:45:15.291
if they could put those EFM g of the key functional Fmri,

816
00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:20.490
Fmri,
if they could put that on you.
All the various ways they have a monitoring.

817
00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:21.720
What the fuck's going on in your dome?

818
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:23.730
If they could do that while you were in that,

819
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:27.060
like if you got to that psychedelic state and he told them I was there,

820
00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:30.330
I was there,
and they're like,
okay,
well let's,
let's look at the chart and see.

821
00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.940
Yeah,
I mean death.
They'd probably see it in a lot of things.

822
00:45:32.941 --> 00:45:35.940
They'd see it in blood flow,
they'd see it in brainwave activity,

823
00:45:35.941 --> 00:45:37.560
they'd see it and in a variety of things.

824
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:40.950
I want to know what happens when you're killing on stage.

825
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:43.540
I want to know what that is.
I bet it,

826
00:45:43.541 --> 00:45:46.020
I bet it's in that 10 Hertz Alpha frequency.

827
00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:50.280
That would be probably exactly where you want to be for that creative.

828
00:45:50.281 --> 00:45:53.310
Everything's easy.
It's smooth.
You lose track of time.

829
00:45:53.311 --> 00:45:56.580
I mean that's the characteristic of that 10 hertz kind of window,

830
00:45:56.581 --> 00:46:01.100
that sweet spot,
that flow state.
If there's a weird state you hit.
Yeah.

831
00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.800
So weird state you hit when everything's cracking and I love watching other

832
00:46:04.801 --> 00:46:07.740
people kill too cause I could kind of see them in that state.

833
00:46:07.741 --> 00:46:12.570
I'm like well you know like you watch like Joey Diaz is like one of the best

834
00:46:12.571 --> 00:46:17.571
examples because Joey will reach these these states and he'll say things off the

835
00:46:18.001 --> 00:46:22.410
top of his fucking head that you would swear somebody like somebody would like

836
00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:26.070
we'll do with Labor for years to try to come up with a line as beautiful and

837
00:46:26.071 --> 00:46:29.610
poetic and he'll say it and then after it comes out of his mouth he starts

838
00:46:29.611 --> 00:46:32.940
laughing because he's laughing at it because he didn't even know he was going to

839
00:46:32.941 --> 00:46:37.640
say it.
And you realize like,

840
00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:41.250
that guy's gone.
He's gone.
He's in that and he's addicted to it.

841
00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:43.650
He said it's totally addicted to killing.

842
00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:47.070
That's funny you say that because I talk with Steven Kotler wrote this book,

843
00:46:47.071 --> 00:46:48.090
the rise of Superman,

844
00:46:48.091 --> 00:46:51.210
and they've done a lot of studies on these flow states and when you're in this

845
00:46:51.211 --> 00:46:55.530
flow state,
you're releasing a concoction of five different indogenous drugs,

846
00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:57.390
and I can't name them off the top of my head,

847
00:46:57.391 --> 00:47:01.860
but he makes the argument that flow state is by far the most addictive substance

848
00:47:01.861 --> 00:47:05.280
in the world because you're getting dopamine,
norepinephrine,

849
00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:08.170
all of these different indogenous drugs,
basically,

850
00:47:08.171 --> 00:47:11.700
they get flooded through your body and nothing feels better.
I mean,

851
00:47:11.701 --> 00:47:13.950
you can chase a high every other which way,

852
00:47:13.951 --> 00:47:17.910
but once you felt that you're going to want to get back to that more and more.

853
00:47:17.911 --> 00:47:22.230
I mean,
it's incredibly addictive,
incredibly productive,
but also addictive.
Yeah.

854
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:26.850
Any guy that's ever done anything dangerous who talked to BMX folks or

855
00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:30.340
skateboarders or any of those extreme maniacs,

856
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:33.210
<v 0>those guys for sure are a ditto.</v>

857
00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:38.140
Ditto that experience the rush of danger and pulling it off.
Fuck,

858
00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:43.290
you know,
you see those guys,
they do a flip and then they land in like fuck yeah,

859
00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:47.260
it's like the university is charging them like Highlander and shit.

860
00:47:47.261 --> 00:47:48.880
Like a lightning bolts going through them.

861
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:53.410
If you'd watch chocolate and chocolate Dellwood when he's the best example of

862
00:47:53.411 --> 00:47:57.970
that state because he would win and he would throw his arms back in,

863
00:47:57.971 --> 00:48:01.660
roar and yell with his chest,
poked out,
pull up,

864
00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:05.590
pull up a video of chocolate,
Dell celebrating.
There's like a,

865
00:48:05.591 --> 00:48:10.240
there's compilations of him celebrating when he was in his prime.
Dude,

866
00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:15.540
you want to talk about like if you wanted the guy to recruit new fans,

867
00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:19.930
if you said,
man,
what is this MMA thing?
Watch this motherfucker.

868
00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:23.980
What is this the most bad ass celebration?

869
00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:27.130
What does this is like an edited version?
Yeah.

870
00:48:27.131 --> 00:48:29.870
Find one where they didn't do their own dance mix to it.

871
00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:33.290
Just show it man.
If you could show it,

872
00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:37.330
you could know and hardly anybody ever going to feel that.
That same thing.

873
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:40.540
We can all taste it and then our own certain little ways.

874
00:48:40.541 --> 00:48:43.450
But if you could bottle that feeling,
forget about it,

875
00:48:43.451 --> 00:48:46.960
and everybody would just hit that button as many times as possible.
You can't.

876
00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:50.950
You can't.
You can't and you,
you,
you don't deserve it.
You don't deserve it.

877
00:48:50.951 --> 00:48:55.300
You need to do what he did to get there.
You have to fight Bob Aloosa brawl,

878
00:48:55.301 --> 00:48:58.300
Tito Ortiz,
you gotta fight Kevin Randleman.

879
00:48:58.301 --> 00:49:01.390
You've got to fight all those fucking guys.
You've got to fight rampage Jackson.

880
00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:04.240
You got to fight ouster over him.
You gotta fight those guys.

881
00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:06.020
If you don't fight those guys,
you don't have,

882
00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:09.790
you don't deserve that feeling like he's in there with murderers and he's

883
00:49:09.791 --> 00:49:14.710
throwing haymakers and when he was at his best dude,
God damn,

884
00:49:14.711 --> 00:49:16.390
he was a ferocious motherfucker.

885
00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:20.950
You know his style almost like it kind of did him in because he was so

886
00:49:20.951 --> 00:49:23.530
aggressive and he was so willing to take one to give one.

887
00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:28.090
He wanted to get you into a war of wills.
He was like,
dude,
there's no way.

888
00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:29.440
There's no,
you just did.
You don't understand.

889
00:49:29.441 --> 00:49:32.030
There's no way you're going to hit me and it's not going to hurt and I'm going

890
00:49:32.031 --> 00:49:35.050
to fucking kill you if you stand in front of me.
I'm gonna Smash your face in.

891
00:49:35.051 --> 00:49:37.630
And that was like his style.
Skillful of course.

892
00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:39.520
I mean he did have do good defensive skills,

893
00:49:39.521 --> 00:49:44.521
but he would oftentimes abandoned them just with just rage and just go after

894
00:49:44.591 --> 00:49:45.220
opponents.

895
00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:48.280
So like if you wanted like the perfect guy to like if you wanted to show

896
00:49:48.281 --> 00:49:51.850
somebody,
I want you to watch MMA,
watch a chocolate Dell fight in his prime,

897
00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.400
you'd be like fucking Christ man.

898
00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:58.520
Like when he beats up Tito Ortiz and he has him up against the cage is just

899
00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:03.680
fucking unloading these combinations and Tito starts to slump down fucking

900
00:50:03.731 --> 00:50:06.640
Christ man.
I mean Jesus Christ,

901
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:12.270
that guy was a fucking warrior in there and Rah Rah over those feelings cause

902
00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:15.670
his arms back.
You appreciate it.

903
00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:19.030
It's not like a guy who just decision to guy to death.

904
00:50:19.031 --> 00:50:22.750
He blanketed on top of them through little baby punches.
Now,

905
00:50:22.751 --> 00:50:26.980
this is a guy just threw his soul,
let a guy came out,
triumph,
and he's like,

906
00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:32.030
you don't get that roar if you barely win by a split decision and a fight where

907
00:50:32.031 --> 00:50:35.480
you didn't take any chances where you,
you know,
you did the right thing,

908
00:50:35.481 --> 00:50:38.420
but you stifled them up against the cage and put it on the ground and got on top

909
00:50:38.421 --> 00:50:41.450
of them and it didn't really make any risks.
No,

910
00:50:41.451 --> 00:50:45.910
you only get that when you go balls out barbarian style.
Yeah.
Ah,

911
00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:49.010
look at that picture.
No video.

912
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:52.070
And it seems like contact no video of this zoo,
Fhfa,

913
00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:57.170
how dare you zoo for my employers,
employers contact sports.

914
00:50:57.171 --> 00:50:58.880
There's some of the best ways to get that.
I mean,

915
00:50:58.881 --> 00:51:03.380
you'll see that also when like a running back runs over three different giant

916
00:51:03.381 --> 00:51:05.660
men who've been training their whole life to bring them down.

917
00:51:05.661 --> 00:51:09.200
They get in there and you'll get a tight tastes that probably none quite the

918
00:51:09.201 --> 00:51:10.310
same as chuck Ladell,

919
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:14.870
but something about these contact sports where you're actually just in it and

920
00:51:14.871 --> 00:51:19.871
just getting pounded by different other individuals and then triumphing releases

921
00:51:20.391 --> 00:51:24.080
that massive feeling.
Yeah.
You know,
I never experienced that.

922
00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:27.770
I never like any tournament that I won or anything like that.

923
00:51:27.771 --> 00:51:30.860
I always felt weird after it was over.
I never felt,

924
00:51:30.861 --> 00:51:33.980
I felt relief because it was over and now I can relax.

925
00:51:33.981 --> 00:51:38.660
I did feel good about it later when I thought about like,
yeah,
I fucking won.

926
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:43.160
Wow,
I have the trophy.
I could look at it like this is mine.
I won this.

927
00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:47.090
But when it was over like the state of mind,
even if I won by knock,

928
00:51:47.091 --> 00:51:50.000
especially even if I won by knock out because then I will always,

929
00:51:50.001 --> 00:51:51.680
I was always like,
fuck,
that could have been me.

930
00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:53.660
Like I'm not even making any money doing this.

931
00:51:53.661 --> 00:51:56.630
I'm out here at throwing kicks it people and they're kicking me and I'm kicking

932
00:51:56.631 --> 00:52:00.110
them and look what happened.
This fucking kid,
I didn't even know this kid.

933
00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:03.290
I just don't even know this kid and I just put them in the hospital like this is

934
00:52:03.291 --> 00:52:05.870
ridiculous.
That's what I would think.
I would never be like,

935
00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:11.850
that's why I had to quit that shit.
Yeah,

936
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:14.190
there's something missing.
I was too.

937
00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:19.120
I was also too aware of the potential downsides,
right?

938
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:24.250
Like I was a early on adaptor of head trauma paranoia because I'm pretty honest

939
00:52:26.631 --> 00:52:29.750
about,
I think one of the things about being a martial artist,
at least for me,

940
00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:30.980
the way,
uh,

941
00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:35.420
I got better at it quicker is that it was super honest about all the shit that I

942
00:52:35.421 --> 00:52:39.680
did wrong.
I never tried to pretend anything was better than what it was.

943
00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.820
I would look at everything and I'd never be satisfied.
All the techniques I like,

944
00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:47.030
that's not crisp enough.
There's not,
the weight transfers on hard enough.

945
00:52:47.031 --> 00:52:48.350
There's like whatever it was,
I'd be like,

946
00:52:48.351 --> 00:52:50.660
I got to just keep drilling this over and over and over again.

947
00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:54.230
And because of that,
it was like acutely aware of my performance levels,

948
00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:57.980
which is why when I started getting hit in the head a lot,

949
00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:02.000
I started looking at the performance of my thinking and I was like,

950
00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:05.180
something's off.
There's something going on here.

951
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:10.100
Like I'm feeling a very small and I'm not trying to attribute it to fatigue.

952
00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:11.720
Like maybe it's cause of fatigue.

953
00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:14.450
Maybe it's because I'm tired because I've been training a lot cause some

954
00:53:14.451 --> 00:53:17.690
fighting.
And then I was like,
maybe I'm getting hit in the head too much.

955
00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.930
And I was like,
Whoa,
fuck man,
this is,

956
00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.660
and then I started thinking about these people that you see in life.

957
00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:27.210
Like you've run into some old and he's hunched over and he's got a cane.

958
00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:30.570
You don't think of that guy as being a three year old running in his dad's

959
00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:31.170
backyard,

960
00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:35.580
laughing and giggling and impervious to injury and flopping down on his butt and

961
00:53:35.581 --> 00:53:37.980
just getting right back up.
Cause he's only three inches off the ground.

962
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:41.930
Now you look at a decaying creature who's reached the,
the,

963
00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:46.950
the final slide of his existence in this dimension he's at,

964
00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:49.410
he's on the way out.
You don't see the full journey.

965
00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:54.600
And I think we think of these guys that you run into in the gym that are punchy

966
00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:57.960
and you think of them and you go,
oh that fucking guy,
man.
Yeah,

967
00:53:57.961 --> 00:54:00.750
he's punched drunk.
That guy didn't use to be punched drunk though.

968
00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:02.520
He used to be a regular guy.

969
00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:06.330
He used to be a regular guy that you can talk to and now he's in this weird

970
00:54:06.331 --> 00:54:10.950
place.
And I know I didn't,
you know,
I didn't compete that long.

971
00:54:10.951 --> 00:54:13.950
Especially like with a lot of head blows,
like the,

972
00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:16.800
the I way more head blows in boxing and kickboxing,

973
00:54:16.801 --> 00:54:20.670
which all happened in the last like two or three years that I was doing martial

974
00:54:20.671 --> 00:54:25.350
arts,
like really intensely and competing.
So I don't think I took too much.

975
00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:26.340
But when I,

976
00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:30.090
when I think about people that I know that I know are fucked up map now that

977
00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:33.450
that bothers me,
man.
It's one of the main things that bothers me about this.

978
00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:35.970
<v 1>No,
no.
And,
and it's,
you know,
it's interesting,</v>

979
00:54:35.971 --> 00:54:38.100
it's like choosing this lifestyle that you know,

980
00:54:38.101 --> 00:54:42.710
can give you access to these feelings.
Like maybe Chuck Mendell felt that 0.0,

981
00:54:42.711 --> 00:54:43.321
zero,
zero,
zero,

982
00:54:43.321 --> 00:54:47.790
1% of the whole world will ever feel you get access to a little piece of that.

983
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:52.050
But it comes at a terrible price.
You know,
if you stick with it too,
if you stick

984
00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:52.871
<v 0>where the two long,</v>

985
00:54:52.871 --> 00:54:55.420
and that's the problem is what we were talking about earlier is the addiction,

986
00:54:55.570 --> 00:55:00.220
the addiction to that fucking rush rush,
that wild feeling.

987
00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:02.800
I know,
like I said,
I've never felt it.

988
00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:07.260
<v 1>Well you look at some of the people who are really intriguing me right now and,</v>

989
00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:10.420
and they have a different kind of attitude when they're in there.

990
00:55:10.421 --> 00:55:13.570
Sometimes they can feel it.
Like someone like John Jones for example,
is a,

991
00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:18.930
is a good example of that where it's just so calculated calm and flow,

992
00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:21.150
you know,
everything looks like it's,
you know,

993
00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:24.850
you don't see that rage come out of him in the cage anymore.

994
00:55:24.851 --> 00:55:28.800
And so he's so efficient at making great guys look silly.
And then,

995
00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:29.711
and even Connor,

996
00:55:29.711 --> 00:55:32.290
even though he's just starting out and he's got a lot of tough for guys to
fight,

997
00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:33.790
he has a little bit of that,

998
00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:37.720
that element too where everything just looks easy for him in there.

999
00:55:37.721 --> 00:55:40.730
And I think that's the next wave because,
and they're going to,

1000
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:44.650
they're going to deny themselves maybe some of the pleasure on the other side,

1001
00:55:44.830 --> 00:55:49.180
but their performance in that level in that mode is going to be pretty fucking

1002
00:55:49.181 --> 00:55:50.014
tough to beat.

1003
00:55:50.350 --> 00:55:55.180
<v 0>Yeah,
it's very interesting seeing these various styles that are emerging.</v>

1004
00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:59.470
You know,
one of the things that I really love about the UFC,
um,
I,

1005
00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:01.210
and this is,
uh,

1006
00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:05.960
as a person who's seen it from the really early days,
you know,

1007
00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:08.790
I started watching UFC too.
So,

1008
00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:12.160
and being able to call more than a thousand fights live from just a few feet

1009
00:56:12.161 --> 00:56:13.870
away.
You're seeing,

1010
00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:17.260
it's like a mathematical equation you're seeing,

1011
00:56:17.261 --> 00:56:22.180
like what are the benefits of being 265 pounds of built like Brock Lesnar versus

1012
00:56:22.181 --> 00:56:24.100
what are the benefits,
a superior gas tank

1013
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.110
<v 2>like Cain Velasquez and really good wrestling skills.</v>

1014
00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:29.800
What are the benefits of crisp technique over whether the benefits of rage and

1015
00:56:29.801 --> 00:56:31.960
aggression and muscle.
What are the benefits of,

1016
00:56:31.961 --> 00:56:36.961
of of a pace that no one can keep up with versus a guy who throws knockout blows

1017
00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:42.270
but gets tired after the second round?
Like where,
where's the numbers?
What Ciena?

1018
00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:46.480
I'm looking at it not just as like individuals with unique personalities,

1019
00:56:46.481 --> 00:56:49.930
unique physical skills like we all know like guys like Hector Lombard,

1020
00:56:49.931 --> 00:56:53.200
like look at him.
That's a unique physical specimen period.

1021
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:56.870
There's no denying that.
You just can't deny it.
He's just does not a,

1022
00:56:56.871 --> 00:56:59.080
that's not a regular dude.
He doesn't move like a regular dude.

1023
00:56:59.081 --> 00:57:02.800
He's not going to hit you like a regular dude.
So there's a massive benefit.

1024
00:57:02.801 --> 00:57:07.300
His goal somehow has muscles that attach to his trap and even though I didn't

1025
00:57:07.301 --> 00:57:11.800
even know that's possible.
So stupid strong too.
Dude,
you watch him fight.

1026
00:57:11.801 --> 00:57:14.620
Tim Boetsch.
Tim Bosch is a like a really big one,

1027
00:57:14.621 --> 00:57:17.470
85 and Timbo shit strong as fuck dude.

1028
00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:22.650
And Tim Bush would go to take down and Hector snapped him down and sprawled like

1029
00:57:22.841 --> 00:57:27.841
I have never seen a five foot eight man due to a big fucking viking looking dude

1030
00:57:30.521 --> 00:57:34.210
like Timbo.
She just grabs him and snaps some down.
It's like fucking Christ.

1031
00:57:34.211 --> 00:57:37.750
How strong is that dude?
Like he's like the way through Jake shields around.

1032
00:57:37.751 --> 00:57:41.070
Who the fuck has ever done that before?
Who's ever done that before?
He,

1033
00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:44.980
he flipped Jake shields through the air and hip tossed him.

1034
00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:48.520
Jake shields is a worldclass Brazilian jujitsu black belt.

1035
00:57:48.521 --> 00:57:52.480
Like he competed against Marcello Garcia,
Cameron Earl.
I mean he was,

1036
00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:54.820
he was in the mix against John Fitch.
He,
he,

1037
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:59.170
he grappled against like some really top level competition and perform very well

1038
00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:00.730
in,
in straight Jujitsu.

1039
00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:05.320
So to watch him just get fucking thrown through the air with the greatest of

1040
00:58:05.321 --> 00:58:07.990
ease here.
Like what kind of a freak is that?

1041
00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:14.010
But is that the way to go or is the way to go to p that guy and also pretend

1042
00:58:14.201 --> 00:58:18.220
you're not there to fight?
Like you're a regular dude to fight.

1043
00:58:18.221 --> 00:58:20.650
Like you're a guy who doesn't have ridiculous explosive power,

1044
00:58:20.651 --> 00:58:24.100
but always have that on tap and know when to release a little bit out of it and

1045
00:58:24.101 --> 00:58:25.330
then pull it back a little bit on them.

1046
00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:28.090
That way you can get that Frankie Edgar Pace.
Well,

1047
00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:31.090
it's not only a proving grounds for strategy like you're talking,

1048
00:58:31.091 --> 00:58:34.360
which is amazing,
but it's also a proven ground for mental conditioning.

1049
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:38.320
I mean this is the place where there's absolutely zero room to be at less than

1050
00:58:38.321 --> 00:58:40.270
your potential.
And you see that all the time.

1051
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:42.340
You see fighters come out and for whatever reason,

1052
00:58:42.550 --> 00:58:46.420
you know that a different operating system in that body would be fighting that

1053
00:58:46.421 --> 00:58:49.030
night better.
So for whatever reason they weren't reaching it.

1054
00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:53.260
And then you see the converse side like Tj Dillashaw versus Barao when he came

1055
00:58:53.261 --> 00:58:58.261
out where you know he's on that bleeding edge of 99 nine nine of his potential

1056
00:58:59.590 --> 00:59:04.030
of what he can do at that given point and the states that they get in to get

1057
00:59:04.031 --> 00:59:06.820
themselves that way.
The practices,
Jon Jones,

1058
00:59:06.821 --> 00:59:10.750
when we actually ran into him before his last fight at dinner and he was talking

1059
00:59:10.751 --> 00:59:14.890
about a really interesting practice that he was doing in which he was going

1060
00:59:14.891 --> 00:59:18.490
through all of the worst case scenarios that can happen against Daniel Cormay.

1061
00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:21.710
Daniel Cormay taking him down,
all of the worst.
And he said,

1062
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:23.840
<v 1>and I've accepted those and I'm fine with him.</v>

1063
00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:29.210
And for him that was releasing any fear that he had of what might happen in the

1064
00:59:29.211 --> 00:59:32.090
ring.
And that's what an Danieli Billy pointed this out.

1065
00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:34.550
That's also what the Sam or I would do before battle.

1066
00:59:34.551 --> 00:59:37.670
And this is described vividly in the Hagia query,
the book of the Samurai.

1067
00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:41.630
They would vividly you imagine in their mind all of the different ways they

1068
00:59:41.631 --> 00:59:42.440
could die,

1069
00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:46.370
gutted in eviscerated their guts spilling out in their hands and Arrow piercing

1070
00:59:46.371 --> 00:59:50.360
their neck.
They would go through all of these different scenarios in their head,

1071
00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:54.110
be at peace with them,
understanding that death was coming to them all anyways.

1072
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:56.630
And then that way they wouldn't fear these scenarios.

1073
00:59:56.631 --> 00:59:57.920
So they were fierce are in battle.

1074
00:59:58.130 --> 01:00:02.600
So these techniques that are getting re innovated by people like John Jones are

1075
01:00:02.601 --> 01:00:03.434
really,
you know,

1076
01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:07.760
amazing to see because a lot of times innovation comes out of necessity and

1077
01:00:07.761 --> 01:00:11.240
there's no greater necessity than another killer trying to pummel you in front

1078
01:00:11.241 --> 01:00:12.074
of millions of people.

1079
01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:15.910
<v 0>Yeah.
The people want to say that it's 99% mental or 90% mental.</v>

1080
01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.450
That's not really true because no matter how strong your brain is,
John,

1081
01:00:19.451 --> 01:00:23.230
John's gonna kick your fucking ass.
Okay,
chuck can be drunk on coke.

1082
01:00:23.530 --> 01:00:25.990
He's going to bitch slap you.
He's a better athlete.

1083
01:00:25.991 --> 01:00:29.320
He's just better fighter period.
But if John Jones,

1084
01:00:29.321 --> 01:00:32.170
his mind is totally on point,

1085
01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:34.630
if he's in that Samurais zone,

1086
01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:37.480
that is an unbelievably deadly combination.

1087
01:00:37.481 --> 01:00:42.040
When you have the superior athlete with the superior mental toughness,

1088
01:00:42.041 --> 01:00:45.580
like a guy who goes through a really strong amateur wrestling background house,

1089
01:00:45.730 --> 01:00:50.730
like all those guys have some savage mental toughness and you add that to like

1090
01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:54.310
some sort of meditation practice or some sort of,

1091
01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:57.130
a lot of them are using hypnosis now,
which is really interesting.

1092
01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:00.790
There's a guy who a Joe Schilling was talking about,

1093
01:01:00.791 --> 01:01:05.320
I'll say his name because it's on my,
it's on my Twitter thing,
but,
uh,

1094
01:01:05.350 --> 01:01:08.290
I want to,
he just did Ian Mccall as well.

1095
01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:12.580
He's hypnotizing motherfuckers and he's doing it through facetime.

1096
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.890
He's hypnotizing them.
Vinny.
God dammit.
Why can't I remember his last name?

1097
01:01:17.891 --> 01:01:20.920
Shoreman I believe it is.
Yes.
Vinny shoreman that's it.

1098
01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:24.460
And Vinny shoreman is also an excellent striking commentator.

1099
01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:27.810
He does like a lot of kickboxing events and,
um,

1100
01:01:27.970 --> 01:01:32.970
Moy Tai events and he works with some of these fighters in hypnotizes them and

1101
01:01:33.461 --> 01:01:37.480
puts them in the states of mind.
[inaudible] essentially,

1102
01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.060
I want to talk to them about doing it for standup comedy because I don't think

1103
01:01:40.061 --> 01:01:43.000
anybody's ever done it for like,
I don't think anybody's ever been hypnotized.

1104
01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:46.410
Like,
especially where everything's going well.
Yeah,
no,
I can sit,

1105
01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:47.890
see what happens.
Let's see what,

1106
01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:50.830
what happens if I get this guy to read my fucking brain?

1107
01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:52.060
<v 1>Well,
all of these things are,</v>

1108
01:01:52.061 --> 01:01:53.960
and we've talked about it a bit on this podcast already.

1109
01:01:53.961 --> 01:01:56.180
They're manipulating the belief system.
And I've,
you know,

1110
01:01:56.181 --> 01:01:58.850
talked about knee surgery,
placebos,
this placebo,

1111
01:01:58.851 --> 01:02:02.930
there's no CBO affect the power that the brain has to be able to affect

1112
01:02:02.931 --> 01:02:07.790
conditions within the human body.
And then so manipulating that to your benefit,

1113
01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:12.470
I think is,
is a huge part of,
you know,
the next frontier.
And I also think,

1114
01:02:12.471 --> 01:02:14.390
especially when there's two people involved,

1115
01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:19.220
if we understand that the belief system has a lot to do with potential outcomes,

1116
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:22.050
both for health and a variety of things,
that's all been proven.
You know,

1117
01:02:22.051 --> 01:02:24.180
belief has huge,
you know,

1118
01:02:24.181 --> 01:02:27.270
a huge amount of leverage on what you're capable of doing physically.

1119
01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.350
So understanding that,
then it would make sense that evolutionarily speaking,

1120
01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.650
humans would be good belief detectors of each other,
right?

1121
01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:38.850
Because that would allow you to assess whether your opponent at a certain point

1122
01:02:38.851 --> 01:02:41.940
or someone you were going to fight might be able to beat you or a mate that you

1123
01:02:41.941 --> 01:02:44.130
were going to be with was going to be good,

1124
01:02:44.131 --> 01:02:46.740
or someone was going to be able to provide,
or your friend was going to be,

1125
01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:51.090
you know,
worthwhile.
So detecting belief had to be a skill that we've developed.

1126
01:02:51.091 --> 01:02:52.530
And I think we're very good at that.

1127
01:02:52.531 --> 01:02:56.400
We know when someone inherently is confident or whether they're cocky and

1128
01:02:56.401 --> 01:03:00.300
insecure,
hiding something,
you know?
So our belief detection is really good.

1129
01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.270
And I think so it's double.
And when you'd look at these competitors,

1130
01:03:03.271 --> 01:03:05.880
because not only is their belief strong,

1131
01:03:05.881 --> 01:03:09.930
but the other person across from them can detect that belief to a certain
degree.

1132
01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.350
And then that might start to shake their belief.
If they're like,
man,

1133
01:03:13.351 --> 01:03:16.920
this motherfucker for sure believes he's going to kick my ass.

1134
01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:21.120
Is My belief enough to believe that that's not going to happen?
You know?

1135
01:03:21.121 --> 01:03:24.120
So it's this kind of contest of,
of course,
both physically,

1136
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.310
but I think people are kind of measuring each other.

1137
01:03:26.550 --> 01:03:29.820
And I think that's an advantage that like again,
Conor McGregor has,

1138
01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:34.410
I really believe that he believes that he is going to kick that other person's

1139
01:03:34.411 --> 01:03:37.410
ass.
So the other person,
when they're dealing with them,
they're like,
man,

1140
01:03:37.411 --> 01:03:40.080
this motherfucker really believes this.
You know?
Am I sure?

1141
01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:41.550
Am I sure that I'm going to win?

1142
01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:45.600
And then that starts to cause doubt and that doubt creates this negative
cascade.

1143
01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:48.560
Yeah.
Isn't it fascinating how that works at the,

1144
01:03:48.570 --> 01:03:53.570
the other person can kind of somehow or another sense your true state.

1145
01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:58.290
Yeah.
Somehow or another you can put on the face of the confident person,

1146
01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.310
but they can go,
this is one of the fuckers buffet,
right?
I smelled bluffing.

1147
01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:07.470
He's shaky.
There's something going on.
Yeah.
You know,
I feel that with audiences,

1148
01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:11.250
audiences know when your head's not there or when you're not,
right.

1149
01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:14.880
You could say the exact right words and the exact right order with the exact

1150
01:04:14.881 --> 01:04:18.990
right amount of pauses,
but if your intent isn't there,
if your mind isn't there,

1151
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:23.700
it's like they don't,
they don't connect with it.
It's a form of hypnosis.

1152
01:04:23.730 --> 01:04:27.600
I really think that standup is some form of hypnosis.
Yeah.

1153
01:04:27.601 --> 01:04:29.510
So they're their belief detectors rack.

1154
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:32.310
If you don't really believe that you're in the pocket and you're,

1155
01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:34.920
and you're delivering it the right way,
they'll,
they'll kind of,

1156
01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:38.340
they'll kind of sense that.
And that's what I'm kind of trying it too.

1157
01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:40.470
And then the opposite of that is,

1158
01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:45.530
is fear because fear is a belief of some probability that some shit bad shit is

1159
01:04:45.601 --> 01:04:49.080
going to happen.
You know?
So it's almost like a negative belief mechanism.

1160
01:04:49.081 --> 01:04:52.320
Of course there's danger and having,
you know,
danger is real.

1161
01:04:52.321 --> 01:04:55.150
But the fear that's on top of that danger,
you know,

1162
01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:58.950
that is a somewhat of a belief that some other bad shit is going to happen.

1163
01:04:58.951 --> 01:05:01.860
And that's why it manifests is because it is a belief.

1164
01:05:01.861 --> 01:05:03.840
It is a belief that something's gonna happen.

1165
01:05:03.841 --> 01:05:06.750
If you're afraid on stage that you're going to bomb,
you know,

1166
01:05:06.751 --> 01:05:11.250
that fear will start to wind its way into yourself and you'll create that

1167
01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:14.370
because some part of you believes that's when,
uh,
that's what's going to happen.

1168
01:05:14.371 --> 01:05:18.160
So it's almost like fear is the no CBO of regular,
everyday

1169
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.040
<v 0>living,
whereas belief is the placebo of everyday living.</v>

1170
01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.610
That's why it's so devastating when you think about people that you don't talk

1171
01:05:24.611 --> 01:05:27.520
about being bullied like some,
some kids have gone through.

1172
01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:30.970
I've gone through like really horrific bullying episodes as children.

1173
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:35.590
And that those when,
when you think about what's happening,

1174
01:05:35.591 --> 01:05:38.920
when you're getting bullied or you know you're scared of someone in your

1175
01:05:38.921 --> 01:05:42.180
neighborhood or you know there's someone who's harassing you or stalking you,

1176
01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:44.500
they become,

1177
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:49.150
it's almost like they become a virus in your mind where someone,

1178
01:05:49.151 --> 01:05:52.870
like if you're in school and you have to get on that fucking boss and go and

1179
01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:56.020
this big fuckers going to smack you in the head every day,

1180
01:05:56.021 --> 01:05:58.420
every and you're going to be living in fear of this guy trying to figure out

1181
01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:01.180
where he is.
That guy becomes like a virus in your head.

1182
01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:06.960
And when you think of how meditation works,

1183
01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:13.020
how meditation is sort of resetting you and clearing all of the programs that

1184
01:06:13.421 --> 01:06:14.050
are in there,

1185
01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:19.050
clearing all the things that seem to be externally dictating behavior.

1186
01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:24.490
When you're,
when you're,
when you're fighting,

1187
01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:27.760
especially when you're competing and someone's beating you at something,

1188
01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:29.620
especially if they're talking shit,

1189
01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:33.380
they're kind of hypnotizing you totally because they're,

1190
01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:37.660
they're planting their mind or their personality is a virus in your head and

1191
01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:39.730
then all sudden you are dealing with them.

1192
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.110
Like they're physically coming into your head and fucking with your head where

1193
01:06:44.111 --> 01:06:46.960
you're not physically getting in their head at all.
They just scored on you.

1194
01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:48.640
You know,
they're,
they're kicking your ass,

1195
01:06:48.641 --> 01:06:50.650
they just leg kicked you and they're like,
what?
Bitch?

1196
01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:54.460
And they pop you with a jab.
He like,
fuck.
Like you're not,
you know,

1197
01:06:54.490 --> 01:06:56.770
you're not in his head at all.
No.
He's fucking,

1198
01:06:56.771 --> 01:07:00.280
your belief is getting stronger while yours is getting weaker.
Yes.

1199
01:07:00.281 --> 01:07:03.670
Like you are getting hypnotized as you're getting fucked up.
Yeah.

1200
01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:06.670
That's fascinating.
When you think about that,

1201
01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:09.700
and it happens not only in the cage,
but beforehand,
you know,

1202
01:07:09.701 --> 01:07:14.260
you see those people who've gotten him in someone else's head way early.

1203
01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:18.220
I wonder if this can be compared in some ways to the sense of loss we feel after

1204
01:07:18.221 --> 01:07:21.080
relationships because with some people there's a,

1205
01:07:21.090 --> 01:07:24.290
a deep anger after relationships.
Uh,

1206
01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:28.450
and people break up because not only do they feel this sense of loss,

1207
01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.910
but they feel like you took something from them.

1208
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:33.700
Like you took like a happiness.

1209
01:07:33.930 --> 01:07:38.320
He took some of that you took because they kind of become a part of you.

1210
01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:42.370
You kind of link up with each other in some sort of weird way that's gotta be

1211
01:07:42.371 --> 01:07:44.230
similar to hypnosis in a way too.

1212
01:07:44.530 --> 01:07:49.530
And that what's going on with all these things is the mind is far more malleable

1213
01:07:50.201 --> 01:07:54.790
than we ever give it credit for being the personality is far more dependent upon

1214
01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:58.810
Wim and circumstance and influence than we ever really want it to be.

1215
01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.900
All these things are kind of playing out at the same time.

1216
01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:05.580
There's not any one thing like,
so these,

1217
01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:08.050
these rigid structures that we think of as this is,
well,

1218
01:08:08.051 --> 01:08:10.720
his personality is like this.
Well,
he was totally different.

1219
01:08:10.721 --> 01:08:13.600
Once you get hooked up with her,
of course that bitch bewitched him.

1220
01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:16.010
She hypnotized him.
But did you

1221
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:17.320
<v 2>know she like women can do,</v>

1222
01:08:17.321 --> 01:08:20.000
some women can do that to men and some men can do that to women.

1223
01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:23.090
They fucking turn them into a different person.
It's like they be,

1224
01:08:23.091 --> 01:08:27.890
which you would their personality,
you're getting sleepy,
sleepy.

1225
01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:32.840
This dick is only for me.
You know,
like people do shit like that to each other.

1226
01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.690
You know?
And I think those,
this,

1227
01:08:35.691 --> 01:08:40.691
these connections of the mind are these like poorly understood interfaces that

1228
01:08:41.541 --> 01:08:44.480
we have with each other at these poorly understood connections.

1229
01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.370
And that we want to,
we want to just like,

1230
01:08:46.371 --> 01:08:49.580
sometimes we can't handle it when to just get distance from all being one.

1231
01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:52.970
Just give me,
get some distance.
I have to take time off,
man.
I'm gonna,

1232
01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.210
I'm gonna go on a vacation.

1233
01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:58.280
How other people are influencing your sphere with relationships?

1234
01:08:58.281 --> 01:09:01.280
I think it has a lot to do with attachment and identity.
You know,

1235
01:09:01.281 --> 01:09:03.680
you get with someone and that becomes part of your identity.

1236
01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:07.280
I'm so and so's husband.
I'm so and so's boyfriend.
She's my girlfriend,

1237
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:11.300
my girlfriend.
You know,
it becomes this part part of you,

1238
01:09:11.301 --> 01:09:13.460
your your ego,
your sense of identity,

1239
01:09:13.461 --> 01:09:16.670
and you get attached to that because it's feeding you with something that you

1240
01:09:16.671 --> 01:09:18.260
think you need some validation.

1241
01:09:18.261 --> 01:09:20.900
Maybe she's super hot and that helps you feel it's a,

1242
01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:23.990
it's like a tricky little trap that helps you feel like,
man,
I'm the man,

1243
01:09:23.991 --> 01:09:26.780
my girl is super hot,
you know,
so that part's inside you.

1244
01:09:26.781 --> 01:09:28.940
And then she leaves and you're like,
shit,

1245
01:09:28.941 --> 01:09:31.340
maybe I'm not the man because that's what was feeding you.

1246
01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:36.260
But the key to that is you got to get to a state of almost invincibility

1247
01:09:36.261 --> 01:09:40.400
yourself,
where you don't need anything from anybody or anything you can do.

1248
01:09:40.401 --> 01:09:45.050
You're just free to enjoy it.
That's just extra on top of it.
You know,
you don't,

1249
01:09:45.051 --> 01:09:48.020
you're not borrowing anything from them to make up your identity.

1250
01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:52.130
You're just enjoying the shit out of him and adding more,
piling it on top.

1251
01:09:52.131 --> 01:09:56.210
So when they leave,
you're not really at a loss of anything.
It's just all right.

1252
01:09:56.211 --> 01:10:00.020
I don't get to experience that extra good thing anymore.
Yeah.

1253
01:10:00.021 --> 01:10:03.580
Most people don't see it that way because they watched John Cusack movies and

1254
01:10:03.581 --> 01:10:07.340
they want to stand outside of chicks fucking house with a boom box playing some

1255
01:10:07.341 --> 01:10:09.770
song that used to listen to before you bang you.

1256
01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.940
Have you heard that country song?
It's called redneck crazy.
It's like the most,

1257
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.430
it's like the most absurd song ever.
It's like,

1258
01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:20.510
I'm going to park outside of your window and shine my lights through your park

1259
01:10:20.511 --> 01:10:22.400
outside of your house.
Shaima lights through your window.

1260
01:10:22.401 --> 01:10:26.190
Throw beer cans at your shadow.
You know you broke the wrong heart baby.

1261
01:10:26.191 --> 01:10:28.310
You'd made me redneck crazy.
Oh.

1262
01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:32.050
And it's like playing on and you'll just hear people humming along and singing.

1263
01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:36.260
I mean,
it's amazing.
Jamie,
do you want to please don't,

1264
01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:38.030
let's pretend we didn't bring it up.

1265
01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:42.380
It's unbelievable to hear cause it's just patterning this crazy behavior that

1266
01:10:42.381 --> 01:10:44.150
people have of this possession.

1267
01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:47.870
That's my girl and the fact that she's enjoying her life with someone else.

1268
01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:51.530
I think the song even says,
did you think I was going to wish you well?

1269
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:55.610
I'm not that kind of man baby,
or something like that.
Oh crap.
You know,
it's like,

1270
01:10:55.611 --> 01:10:56.151
Whoa,

1271
01:10:56.151 --> 01:10:59.840
but that's a worm that's in our consciousness that we're supposed to feel like,

1272
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:02.570
you know,
you took something from me.
How dare you?

1273
01:11:02.571 --> 01:11:04.310
I hope you're never happy again.

1274
01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:07.730
But how about the balls to make a funk and songs and you're talking about

1275
01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:11.540
harassing someone's daughter know because she doesn't want to fuck you anymore.

1276
01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:12.440
Maybe that,

1277
01:11:12.441 --> 01:11:17.070
look at that behavior and wonder why your personality sucks.

1278
01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:20.550
Your personality sucks.
That's why she left in the first place.
You asshole.

1279
01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:22.230
Throw a beer.
Can their fucking house.

1280
01:11:22.231 --> 01:11:27.090
How can you grow up baby baby's exactly the word cause it's seems so needy.

1281
01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:31.350
He needed what she was going to provide him because if she stuck with him

1282
01:11:31.351 --> 01:11:35.700
forever,
right?
She's stuck.
She can't do any better.
She wants to improve her life.

1283
01:11:35.701 --> 01:11:39.240
You're just drinking beer and hanging out by the lake.
Fuck you,
dude.

1284
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:44.070
You know what is this?
Here's the lyrics.
Wish I knew how long it's been going on.

1285
01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:47.400
Oh,
she cheated on him.
How long you been getting some on the side?
Well,

1286
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:49.270
a little different.
Uh,
Nah.

1287
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:54.390
He can't amount to much by the look of that little truck.
Oh,
that's hilarious.

1288
01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:58.560
He can't amount to much because he has a small vehicle.
Well,

1289
01:11:58.561 --> 01:12:02.100
he won't be getting any sleep tonight.
Oh Great.
Okay.

1290
01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:06.090
I'm going to lean my headlights in your bedroom windows through empty beer cans

1291
01:12:06.091 --> 01:12:09.120
at both your shadows.
I didn't come here to start a fight,

1292
01:12:09.150 --> 01:12:12.920
but I'm up for anything tonight.
Okay,
but you didn't come to certify it,
right?

1293
01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:16.770
What do you think's gonna Happen?
You mocked his truck.
Okay,
asshole.

1294
01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:19.650
You threw beer cans.
You have a,
you have a fucking spotlight.

1295
01:12:19.651 --> 01:12:23.580
They use to poach dear.
Putting it through his window.

1296
01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:28.620
You know you broke the wrong heart baby and drove a redneck crazy redneck.

1297
01:12:28.621 --> 01:12:33.330
Crazy.
Do you think I'd wish you the best?
Endless love and happiness.
You know,

1298
01:12:33.331 --> 01:12:35.460
that's just not the kind of man I am.
Yeah.

1299
01:12:35.461 --> 01:12:38.640
I'm the kind that shows up at your house at 3:00 AM.
Oh my God.

1300
01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:42.560
I'm going to lean my head lights into your bedroom windows there as both the low

1301
01:12:42.570 --> 01:12:47.310
blow redneck,
crazy redneck crazy forest fuck.
But that,
I mean,
and people,

1302
01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:50.850
it's playing on pop radio because it strikes a chord and I think some girls

1303
01:12:50.851 --> 01:12:53.340
think,
man,
he really was inter,
you know,
he,

1304
01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:57.000
he really loved her because look at what he's doing on the other side and that's

1305
01:12:57.001 --> 01:13:00.600
just the,
that's just a tricky little trap that we got to transcend,
you know,

1306
01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:01.920
least of my concerns,

1307
01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:05.990
my concerns is that there'll be guys that listened to it and think it's okay to

1308
01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:10.650
act like that if a girl is so silly that she thinks all that,
he just loves him.

1309
01:13:10.651 --> 01:13:13.770
That's why he's all doing that.
Shooting up the house.
Shit.

1310
01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:16.350
You think he really wants a sheet up his fucking house,

1311
01:13:16.351 --> 01:13:18.480
which is letting her know he loves or there's,

1312
01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:21.540
there's women who grow up like that.

1313
01:13:21.541 --> 01:13:24.090
They all fucking black eye and they're having this conversation to their kid

1314
01:13:24.091 --> 01:13:26.730
with a Marlboro hanging out of their mouth less and sugar.

1315
01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:31.330
Your Dad and I have very passionate relationship and I pushed his buttons and

1316
01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:35.280
you know,
and he loves me and if he didn't love me he wouldn't fucking hit me.

1317
01:13:35.281 --> 01:13:39.900
And I don't want to all make sense to you right now,
but someday it will.
Yeah,

1318
01:13:39.930 --> 01:13:40.763
that's it.

1319
01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:46.140
That's this old paradigm that is in dire need of transcendence and the need is

1320
01:13:46.831 --> 01:13:49.350
basically,
you know,
we have to be fully full.

1321
01:13:49.351 --> 01:13:52.200
I think Don Miguel Ruiz mix the example of,
you know,

1322
01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:57.030
create enough self love enough self satisfaction and enough inside yourself that

1323
01:13:57.031 --> 01:13:58.680
you don't need anything from anybody else.

1324
01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:02.480
Your kitchen is fully stocked so you're not starving.
You know a lot of people,

1325
01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:06.690
you stock your own kitchen with your own self fulfillment and then you don't

1326
01:14:06.691 --> 01:14:10.260
need to eat any little burger that comes on the side of the road or some hot dog

1327
01:14:10.261 --> 01:14:12.430
from a stand you can get because you're starving.

1328
01:14:12.730 --> 01:14:15.730
<v 0>You got plenty to eat.
And that's,
I think the analogy that we need to have.</v>

1329
01:14:15.731 --> 01:14:19.570
We need to be full and whole and we needed to have standards as human beings we

1330
01:14:19.571 --> 01:14:23.110
accept of ourselves.
Like what you shouldn't accept from yourself.

1331
01:14:23.230 --> 01:14:25.630
Don't accept from yourself that you're the guy that's going to be outside

1332
01:14:25.631 --> 01:14:27.850
someone's house at three o'clock in the morning shining head light to their

1333
01:14:27.851 --> 01:14:30.880
fucking windows and throwing beer cans.
Don't accept that you're that guy.

1334
01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:33.640
You're not that.
He can't be that guy.
If you're that guy,

1335
01:14:33.641 --> 01:14:37.030
no one's going to come to you for advice.
No one's going to take you seriously.

1336
01:14:37.031 --> 01:14:38.560
You're,
you're a fucking dumb ass.

1337
01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:42.490
You're a dumb ass child who gives him to every whim.

1338
01:14:42.670 --> 01:14:45.670
It's like someone who comes after one stroke every time.
I can't help it.

1339
01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:50.920
Like you're a baby.
You're a fucking baby.
You learn some God damn discipline.

1340
01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:55.330
Yeah,
it sucks.
Yeah.
You feel lonely.
Yeah.
You get depressed.
God,
Tinder stupid.

1341
01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:58.840
Find some more checks.
They're everywhere.
People want to fuck.
They love it.

1342
01:14:59.050 --> 01:15:02.230
That's why there's so many of us.
What are you doing,
man?
You tell me,

1343
01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:04.930
you get this one chick,
you can't get another check.
Go get another one.

1344
01:15:04.931 --> 01:15:06.790
Stupid and he will too.
That's the thing,

1345
01:15:06.810 --> 01:15:09.130
to not have any friends and not have any friends,

1346
01:15:09.131 --> 01:15:13.540
anybody who talks you through it,
and he goes,
dude,
dude,
dude,
come on.
Let's go.

1347
01:15:13.541 --> 01:15:18.460
So what people get so goddamn connected when they date,

1348
01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:23.080
they get so fucking connected that they feel like you stole something from Him

1349
01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:26.740
who been getting some pleasure from another entity.

1350
01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:31.660
I ain't tolerating it.
Ah,
sent us bust up your sleep patterns.

1351
01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:34.100
I'm going to fuck with your Beta waves.

1352
01:15:34.101 --> 01:15:38.920
So I'm going to kick your fucking Ram sleep right and the deck.
You fuck with me?

1353
01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:40.750
You fuck with mass sleep?

1354
01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:46.090
I'm the cop of family and fucks with your sleep bank.
That's what he's doing.

1355
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:47.620
He a fucking baby.

1356
01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:53.170
My four year old and my six year old,
we're having an argument today.
Um,

1357
01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.090
because uh,

1358
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:58.930
my six year old was letting the four year old right on her paper for a while,

1359
01:15:59.290 --> 01:16:02.290
but then she's like right on your own paper and she wrote a little bit more.

1360
01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.610
That's just like I said it in your own paper that she wrote on her paper and she

1361
01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:07.960
tried to write and hurt and they were going back and forth writing on each

1362
01:16:07.961 --> 01:16:10.890
other's papers.
Like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
Whoa,
settle the fuck down.

1363
01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:14.950
Stop trying to hurt each other.
This is not,
this is not,
hey,
do it this.
Okay,

1364
01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:18.670
just this.
We've got to learn how to communicate here,
but that foreign sex,

1365
01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:23.980
they're not a fucking 30 year old man with a pig truck.
Big Old jacked up check.

1366
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:26.680
Yeah,
little truck.

1367
01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:30.220
He ain't got shit in a man kind of little ass.

1368
01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:34.100
Fucking truck came from another country too.
Goddamn.
Drop it.

1369
01:16:34.101 --> 01:16:37.570
I told you what a truck,
what do you want?
Reliability.
Yeah.

1370
01:16:37.571 --> 01:16:39.310
That's the process of growing up.

1371
01:16:39.311 --> 01:16:42.650
It should be learning to transcend those initial feelings like yeah,
that's,

1372
01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:46.120
that's of course reasonable when you're four and six were little monkeys in this

1373
01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:50.530
crazy world where sorting shit out,
but then as you get more practice at that,

1374
01:16:50.531 --> 01:16:55.240
that should become more and more absurd with every passing year if we just

1375
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:56.470
committed to that.

1376
01:16:56.650 --> 01:17:01.650
Committed to not going after people and fucking with people's lives,

1377
01:17:02.231 --> 01:17:05.260
like showing up at someone's house three o'clock in the morning and shining your

1378
01:17:05.261 --> 01:17:08.350
headlights and just commit to never going.

1379
01:17:08.351 --> 01:17:10.730
They're never doing that kind of shit.

1380
01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:14.000
I'd never showing up at someone's house and starting a fight.
Never.

1381
01:17:14.001 --> 01:17:18.890
It was just all that put all that aside,
the world,
we'll get like 90% better.

1382
01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:22.700
Like instantly.
If everyone had a standard of behavior like I could,

1383
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:26.000
we kind of trust that you know,
people in this town,
they don't fight you just,

1384
01:17:26.001 --> 01:17:28.280
you talk things out.
Most dudes in this town of rational,

1385
01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.760
imagine if you've got a talent like that,
you're like,
Whoa,
where is this place?

1386
01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:35.870
Oh,
it's just a straight outside of Seattle.
This one town.
Like everyone's cool.

1387
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:40.250
Like what?
That might be comes Colorado.
But could you imagine?
It might be,

1388
01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:42.110
it might be like spreading out of Denver right now,

1389
01:17:42.111 --> 01:17:46.530
like the epicenter of the fucking cannabis nucleus.
It is possible,
right?

1390
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.400
If you could get a group of friends like we have,

1391
01:17:49.401 --> 01:17:52.520
we have a group of like 15 dudes that I would give 1 million bucks,

1392
01:17:52.521 --> 01:17:55.280
two in a bag and never counted if they gave it back to me because they're like

1393
01:17:55.281 --> 01:17:59.780
15 of us.
But for most people it's hard to find fucking people like that.

1394
01:17:59.781 --> 01:18:04.730
But yeah,
a town,
if you had a town of 100 percenters,
hundred percent down,

1395
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:09.230
100% all you know,
just you could count on them for everything.

1396
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:12.890
They are who they are.
God Damn,
what a great town that would be.
You would know,

1397
01:18:12.891 --> 01:18:13.790
would never get in fistfights.

1398
01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:14.400
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1399
01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:18.210
and I think that's a big key of how to improve our situation is maybe we won't

1400
01:18:18.211 --> 01:18:19.320
be able to get the whole town,

1401
01:18:19.321 --> 01:18:22.890
but we can start a queue getting these tribes around us.
Like you're saying,

1402
01:18:22.891 --> 01:18:25.230
you have these 15 people.
Yeah,
they don't all live together,

1403
01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:27.840
but through travel and through talking,

1404
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:31.290
you end up interacting with all these people anyway,
so it kind of insulates you.

1405
01:18:31.291 --> 01:18:35.280
You have your own tribe of these people that we trust impeccably and they can

1406
01:18:35.281 --> 01:18:38.670
help improve our lives and I think that's a major part that's missing.

1407
01:18:38.671 --> 01:18:43.320
We're missing that sense of tribe where we would give absolutely anything.

1408
01:18:43.321 --> 01:18:46.050
It's not like,
oh,
could I stay in your guest bedroom?

1409
01:18:46.170 --> 01:18:48.570
Fucking of course you could stay in my guest bedroom.
Like what?

1410
01:18:48.571 --> 01:18:50.160
I don't even ask that silly question.

1411
01:18:50.161 --> 01:18:53.910
You could do anything that is mine is yours.
That feeling that's innate to us.

1412
01:18:54.150 --> 01:18:57.660
I think we're going to have to start trying to get that back because I think we

1413
01:18:57.661 --> 01:18:59.910
need that.
I mean that's the kind of creature that we are.

1414
01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:03.630
<v 0>Yeah,
I agree.
And I think that,
you know,
you know how you ride a favor.</v>

1415
01:19:03.631 --> 01:19:06.960
Has it hooked up or,
yeah,
he owns like a block.
Yeah,
he has like a bunch of,

1416
01:19:06.961 --> 01:19:10.830
he's so smart.
But dude,
it's just so clever and a bunch of different ways.

1417
01:19:10.831 --> 01:19:13.080
Very good businessman.
Very clever.

1418
01:19:13.081 --> 01:19:17.010
And you know how he set himself up outside of the UFC as a bunch of houses.

1419
01:19:17.011 --> 01:19:19.530
He flips and stuff and he's got,
he's always got something going on,

1420
01:19:19.710 --> 01:19:24.000
owns real estate,
but him and all these alpha male guys,
the,

1421
01:19:24.001 --> 01:19:28.770
that's their team team,
Alpha Male,
a,
uh,
one of the top level,
a high level,

1422
01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.800
uh,
gyms in the country,
particularly for the lighter weight classes.

1423
01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:34.920
Like they have 135 pound champion,
Tj Dillashaw,

1424
01:19:34.921 --> 01:19:38.130
and they're just a wealth of like real good talent in there,

1425
01:19:38.131 --> 01:19:40.890
including guys you haven't even heard of yet that you will hear of soon.

1426
01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:46.280
But the point being is that he's got it set up where he can kind of do whatever

1427
01:19:46.741 --> 01:19:50.580
the fuck he wants.
You know,
he has it set up where he's got,
you know,

1428
01:19:50.581 --> 01:19:53.730
he's got the housing business,
he's got the gym,
he runs,

1429
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:57.870
he's got all these different things going on at the same time.
That's a,

1430
01:19:58.110 --> 01:19:59.550
that's a pretty sweet place to be in.

1431
01:19:59.870 --> 01:20:03.500
<v 1>Of course.
Well he's got his tribe that actually lives right near him,</v>

1432
01:20:03.501 --> 01:20:07.380
which is obviously the best case scenario.
Yeah.
They're all having on one street.

1433
01:20:07.410 --> 01:20:08.100
Yeah.
Houses

1434
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:11.730
<v 0>that they all own.
They just bought houses next to each other.
That's so clever.</v>

1435
01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:14.600
<v 1>Absolutely.
And I think he does that.
Everybody says they want to do that,</v>

1436
01:20:14.601 --> 01:20:15.620
but nobody does.
Nobody does.

1437
01:20:15.621 --> 01:20:18.740
And it's probably the single thing that would improve people's quality of life

1438
01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:21.380
way more than the neighborhood or whatever other reasons.

1439
01:20:21.381 --> 01:20:25.130
They're living somewhere as being around the proximity of those people who

1440
01:20:25.131 --> 01:20:28.580
enrich your life,
make it better when you write as a real leader.

1441
01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:32.240
You know what he's figured out how to do there is to create this atmosphere of,

1442
01:20:32.241 --> 01:20:34.540
first of all,
super supportive recruits guys,
right?

1443
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:37.070
<v 0>Recruited Tj Dillashaw who's the champion,
his weight class.</v>

1444
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:39.530
And then when they offered him a shot at Tj recently,
he's like,
yeah,

1445
01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:42.180
you know what?
I'll fight Frankie Edgar at one 45 let's,

1446
01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:44.740
let's just have a fucking super fight.
Let's get crazy.
Yeah.
You know,

1447
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.350
you gotta love that,
right?
You got to love that.
He thinks like that,
but I just,

1448
01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:51.200
I just love that setup of all the houses on a block.

1449
01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:55.270
<v 1>Yeah.
And you know,
that's going to be possible for some,
and I think that's great.</v>

1450
01:20:55.271 --> 01:20:58.510
And one of the great things about what he's done to really make tribe,

1451
01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:02.440
you got to go back to rich and these different bonding experiences that allow

1452
01:21:02.441 --> 01:21:06.640
you to reach that level of trust.
You know,
shared,
shared suffering,

1453
01:21:06.641 --> 01:21:09.220
you know the people that you've been been in combat together,

1454
01:21:09.221 --> 01:21:12.370
like your eye and all those people.
That says a lot because it's certain point.

1455
01:21:12.371 --> 01:21:14.170
There's a lot of ways to test people,
you know,

1456
01:21:14.171 --> 01:21:16.060
to a certain degree and go through something together.

1457
01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:19.120
Obviously physical exertion like that,
like rolling with somebody,

1458
01:21:19.121 --> 01:21:22.330
you learn a ton about them or doing a psychedelic experience with somebody,

1459
01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:22.661
you know,

1460
01:21:22.661 --> 01:21:26.590
you both drink a coffee cup full Iowasca you're going to learn a lot about

1461
01:21:26.591 --> 01:21:30.790
somebody at that point.
Same with all of these different rituals that have done,

1462
01:21:30.791 --> 01:21:34.020
developed.
Put your hand in a,
in a Mitt full of bullet ants,

1463
01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:35.860
you're going to learn a lot about a motherfucker.
How He,

1464
01:21:35.890 --> 01:21:39.670
what happens when that pain hits and it's overwhelming,
you know,
and that,

1465
01:21:39.671 --> 01:21:43.210
those were key parts of these societies that we've lost.

1466
01:21:43.211 --> 01:21:47.290
And it just kinda happens to some people and you get this closeness,
you know?

1467
01:21:47.291 --> 01:21:51.790
And I think intentionally bringing that back is going to be really important as

1468
01:21:51.791 --> 01:21:54.370
well as these new tribal units form.

1469
01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:59.560
<v 0>We have education and as far as mathematics,</v>

1470
01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:02.470
we have education as far as history.

1471
01:22:02.471 --> 01:22:06.520
We have education as far as grammar and English language and literature and all

1472
01:22:06.521 --> 01:22:08.950
these different things that we teach the standard in school,

1473
01:22:09.190 --> 01:22:14.190
but we don't teach men especially we don't teach men martial arts.

1474
01:22:15.970 --> 01:22:19.180
And I think that martial arts just know,

1475
01:22:19.210 --> 01:22:23.830
having the ability to understand how to use your body to defend yourself

1476
01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:29.160
psychologically alleviates so much pressure that some people just face and go

1477
01:22:30.071 --> 01:22:32.680
through life with they,
they can't defend themselves.

1478
01:22:33.010 --> 01:22:38.010
And the psychological relieving of that I think is an aid to an enhancing and

1479
01:22:39.551 --> 01:22:43.750
understanding other aspects of your life.
Also along the way,

1480
01:22:43.751 --> 01:22:45.460
along the way you're doing martial arts,

1481
01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:48.100
you're doing something difficult and it's,

1482
01:22:48.101 --> 01:22:52.000
you push yourself very hard and you learn about like what are these?

1483
01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:55.390
What are these feelings inside you that make you want to quit when you know you

1484
01:22:55.391 --> 01:22:58.390
couldn't keep going.
If the instructor goes,
keep going,
keep going.

1485
01:22:58.391 --> 01:23:01.380
30 seconds left and you're like doing a flurry on the bag and you just want to

1486
01:23:01.390 --> 01:23:03.520
stop.
Like if you were alone,
you would stop,

1487
01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:07.540
but you keep going and then you understand that you can keep going and then you

1488
01:23:07.541 --> 01:23:09.760
understand,
okay,
well if I can keep going here,

1489
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:11.350
I could keep going in a sparring session.

1490
01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:13.900
If I can keep going in a sparring session,
I can keep going in competition.

1491
01:23:14.050 --> 01:23:18.940
I can count on myself to when I feel really fucking uncomfortable to hold it

1492
01:23:18.941 --> 01:23:21.100
together because I've experienced that state.

1493
01:23:21.101 --> 01:23:26.050
I understand what it is and I refuse to let the limiting negative aspects of

1494
01:23:26.051 --> 01:23:27.520
that state affect my performance.

1495
01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:30.790
I will do everything that my body is physically capable of doing and nothing

1496
01:23:30.791 --> 01:23:33.610
less.
I'm not going to sell it short with a weak mind.

1497
01:23:33.790 --> 01:23:35.470
But until you've experienced that,

1498
01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:39.640
it's very difficult to have any confidence in your ability to overwhelm a any

1499
01:23:39.641 --> 01:23:42.010
sort of adversity or overcome any sort of diversity.

1500
01:23:42.130 --> 01:23:44.050
You don't really ever know if you can do it.

1501
01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:47.590
So you're always going to have this weird thing and the difference between men

1502
01:23:47.591 --> 01:23:51.400
that I know that have experienced that and do it,
you know,

1503
01:23:51.401 --> 01:23:54.780
do difficult things and even did not even fighting stuff like that either.

1504
01:23:54.790 --> 01:23:57.610
The same piece you get out of dudes who were like ultra marathon runners,

1505
01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:00.520
the guys who are triathletes pushing through that resistance,

1506
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:01.600
they push through who they are,

1507
01:24:01.601 --> 01:24:04.450
they understand who they are better than most people and their religious,

1508
01:24:04.451 --> 01:24:07.360
a little bit more aware.
So a little bit more aware.
There's a,

1509
01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:12.160
and I think especially martial arts does that because of the emotional aspect of

1510
01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:15.730
the training.
It's so terrifying.
Sparrings terrifying all of it.

1511
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:19.630
But in getting through that,
it makes everything else brighter.

1512
01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:22.240
It makes everything else lighter.
It's like it gives you,

1513
01:24:22.270 --> 01:24:25.390
it gives you more freedom with your mind.

1514
01:24:25.690 --> 01:24:28.240
Then if you're tussling with these ideas,

1515
01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:32.900
if you're tussling constantly with the fear of being like physically incapable

1516
01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:35.950
of defending yourself,
a massive deficits,
kind of a,

1517
01:24:35.951 --> 01:24:39.130
it's kind of a perfect storm of two things because it's put,

1518
01:24:39.131 --> 01:24:42.370
you're pushing through immense physical suffering at a certain point,

1519
01:24:42.371 --> 01:24:43.420
which is incredibly valuable.

1520
01:24:43.421 --> 01:24:47.050
Plus immense fear and a lot of other things have maybe one of the two like

1521
01:24:47.051 --> 01:24:50.980
marathon running,
immense physical suffering,
no fear,
Big Wave Surfing,

1522
01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:52.000
immense fear,

1523
01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.820
no physical sufferings that maybe when you get crashed into some coral or

1524
01:24:54.821 --> 01:24:57.670
something bad happens,
right?
But then those are good practices.

1525
01:24:57.671 --> 01:25:01.480
But I think at what you're hitting on is that martial arts hits both and so you

1526
01:25:01.481 --> 01:25:02.620
have to transcend both.

1527
01:25:02.621 --> 01:25:06.700
So you'll respond well in situations that are causing fear to come up and you'll

1528
01:25:06.701 --> 01:25:10.570
respond well in situations that are particularly challenging on the physical

1529
01:25:10.571 --> 01:25:14.620
aspect of things.
And it's almost like the opposite of that famous Musashi quote.

1530
01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:18.850
It said no the way broadly and you'll see it all things no the way narrowly and

1531
01:25:18.851 --> 01:25:21.130
you will be able to apply it broadly.
You know,

1532
01:25:21.131 --> 01:25:24.250
if you reach really great levels in something specific like that,

1533
01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:28.000
you'll be able to use that for the rest of your life and everything.
It's just,

1534
01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:31.420
I really think it should be almost required,

1535
01:25:31.690 --> 01:25:36.160
almost required and it doesn't mean you have to be good at it.
Just do it too,

1536
01:25:36.610 --> 01:25:40.180
just to get your state in a better place.

1537
01:25:40.181 --> 01:25:42.670
Can your mental state and a better place,
especially Jujitsu,

1538
01:25:42.671 --> 01:25:45.680
I think you know because he have no head trauma.
Really had trauma.
Yeah,

1539
01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:47.890
that's a big one.
Yeah and it's just,

1540
01:25:48.730 --> 01:25:51.640
I just think people need to do difficult things and I think life is too,

1541
01:25:51.641 --> 01:25:55.190
God damn amazing.
It's too soft for most people into it.

1542
01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:59.920
As far as like character building character is only like built necessarily under

1543
01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:04.130
pressure.
It's very hard to build character.
You know when just a person who's

1544
01:26:04.730 --> 01:26:08.510
<v 2>won the lottery when you're three and you sat around all day and cake,
he just,</v>

1545
01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:10.910
where's your character?
Like why?
Where's it coming from?

1546
01:26:11.170 --> 01:26:14.450
Like you kind of have to go through some shit and I think that's one of the

1547
01:26:14.451 --> 01:26:18.510
issues with a lot of people in this kind of new age movement and this the

1548
01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:22.460
hippies,
if you want to call them or whatever your name for him,
you know,

1549
01:26:22.461 --> 01:26:26.930
might be the people in that consciousness movement,
let's say,
is that there?

1550
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:30.860
You know that there's some part of you when you meet some of them who haven't

1551
01:26:30.861 --> 01:26:32.090
really been tested where he's saying,

1552
01:26:32.450 --> 01:26:36.880
I see that you haven't really tested yourself under immense pressure,
you know,

1553
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:41.000
and that you get this kind of feeling like what happens if things really get

1554
01:26:41.001 --> 01:26:43.310
shitty?
Am I going to be able to count on you and trust you?

1555
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:46.850
All of these things that you're proposing there are.
They all gonna go to shit.

1556
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:49.490
I have an instance.
I have an instinct that they might,

1557
01:26:49.790 --> 01:26:54.790
and so I think everybody on both sides or are missing this kind of the dualism

1558
01:26:54.921 --> 01:26:59.360
of having both,
of being able to reach high levels of consciousness,

1559
01:26:59.361 --> 01:27:02.240
but also put yourself on a mat with someone who,
you know,

1560
01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:07.450
inevitably in 30 to five 30 seconds to five minutes is gonna choke you out.

1561
01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:08.031
You know,

1562
01:27:08.031 --> 01:27:11.090
like know that you're going to go through that and what that put goes through

1563
01:27:11.091 --> 01:27:15.200
your body.
Being able to do both,
I think is the next wave.
You know,

1564
01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:18.440
two times too many times people are on the polarity of that,
you know,

1565
01:27:18.490 --> 01:27:22.130
they're one or the other.
They're either really good at,
at the Jujitsu side,

1566
01:27:22.131 --> 01:27:23.130
but they haven't,
you know,

1567
01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:26.330
push through the realms of consciousness either through Kundalini or

1568
01:27:26.331 --> 01:27:29.780
psychedelics or meditation or these other things.
And conversely,

1569
01:27:29.781 --> 01:27:30.650
on the other side,

1570
01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:35.330
they haven't tasted what it feel like to push through extreme fear and
adversity.

1571
01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:39.430
Adversity.
Yeah.
It's almost like your,

1572
01:27:39.970 --> 01:27:44.970
your car that you're driving through life will work better if you like running

1573
01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:51.110
over more mountains and it'll work better if you put it in danger.

1574
01:27:51.111 --> 01:27:55.870
It'll work better if you slam on the brakes more,
it'll work better.
Like that's,

1575
01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:58.220
this is what your vehicle is like.
You're in,
in,

1576
01:27:58.221 --> 01:28:02.540
in this compromising situation that we're in.
It's not compromise.
It's amazing.

1577
01:28:02.541 --> 01:28:04.940
We're in the best spot ever as far as like human history,

1578
01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:08.210
like we have great medicine,
we have great education.

1579
01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:13.100
Information is available to basically any human being can get a world class

1580
01:28:13.101 --> 01:28:14.240
education online.

1581
01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:19.840
But because of everything being so easy to get food and easy to get,

1582
01:28:21.081 --> 01:28:21.500
uh,
you know,

1583
01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:25.220
to take care of yourself in comparison to how it was when you're fighting off

1584
01:28:25.221 --> 01:28:29.360
predators,
you don't really use your body that much.
You don't really,

1585
01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:31.190
not a lot that's going on.

1586
01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:36.290
Not a lot of stress on the brain as far as like death,
life or death situations.

1587
01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:40.130
There's not a lot of fleeing at full speed running for your life,

1588
01:28:40.131 --> 01:28:44.220
trying to get up a tree as quick as you can.
There's not a lot of that,
you know,

1589
01:28:44.230 --> 01:28:47.470
and that tested sort of diminish its potential.
Yeah,

1590
01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:50.200
they did this thing on hunter gatherers and a,

1591
01:28:50.210 --> 01:28:54.290
the difference between the bone structure of the hunter gatherer and the bone

1592
01:28:54.291 --> 01:28:55.730
structure of the modern day man and they're,

1593
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:59.720
they're looking at modern humans and like the deterioration of the mass of the

1594
01:28:59.721 --> 01:29:03.200
bones and the hands are getting smaller and that tended to getting weaker and

1595
01:29:03.201 --> 01:29:07.890
like,
like we're,
we're like,
we're becoming like those Goddamn gray aliens.

1596
01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:08.431
I mean,

1597
01:29:08.431 --> 01:29:13.230
we're like slowly but surely going from what we think of as a caveman,

1598
01:29:13.231 --> 01:29:16.320
like just fucking gnarly.
Those neanderthals especially,

1599
01:29:16.321 --> 01:29:20.910
they were like five foot five,
200 plus pounds,
just tanks,

1600
01:29:21.090 --> 01:29:25.650
giant bones and fucking thick heads and shit.
And I mean,
they were,

1601
01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:29.160
they were out there huffing it every day.
And because we're not doing that,

1602
01:29:29.161 --> 01:29:32.490
everything is like feminizing,
everything is like thinning.

1603
01:29:32.491 --> 01:29:35.340
Everything is like becoming weaker and weaker and weaker.

1604
01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:40.350
And then we're missing out on a key element of the magic of this fucking

1605
01:29:40.351 --> 01:29:42.870
experience.
You know,
this turn in this dimension,

1606
01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:48.020
part of the fun of it is feeling what the body can do and feeling those
feelings.

1607
01:29:48.230 --> 01:29:52.560
And if we turn into that gray alien type,
we're going to be fucking bummed out.

1608
01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:56.640
You know?
I mean,
I actually had a vision of that in my Iowasca session,

1609
01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:58.830
the last one that I went on where the,

1610
01:29:59.030 --> 01:30:03.000
this alien being came in and he was,
and I was like,
well,

1611
01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:05.700
what's it like being an alien?
Do you have anything to tell me?

1612
01:30:06.030 --> 01:30:08.460
And because he was just chilling there and he says,
well,

1613
01:30:08.461 --> 01:30:12.840
being human is very enviable because for us,
you know,

1614
01:30:12.841 --> 01:30:16.530
we have no physicality in our realm anymore.
That's been gone.

1615
01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:18.660
And you get to experience everything.

1616
01:30:18.661 --> 01:30:20.790
And he showed me these visions of exactly that,

1617
01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:25.060
like wrestling and fucking and eating crazy to not order.

1618
01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:26.393
No,

1619
01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:31.560
but even everything that we get to do all of the physical pleasures of this

1620
01:30:31.561 --> 01:30:33.470
world,
he's like,
yeah,
there's,
you know,

1621
01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:35.880
there's other pleasures of this other realm,

1622
01:30:35.881 --> 01:30:39.690
this realm of pure consciousness where everything is smooth,

1623
01:30:39.691 --> 01:30:41.340
where a generally in a state of bliss,

1624
01:30:41.341 --> 01:30:44.130
but we're missing the extremes of these physical pleasures.

1625
01:30:44.131 --> 01:30:48.930
So human life is enviable and it just discard that.
Say,
Nah,

1626
01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:53.370
I'm not interested.
We're fucking missing out,
man.
You missed out on vitality.

1627
01:30:53.810 --> 01:30:58.470
You know,
that's something that,
especially people that don't exercise,
they don't,

1628
01:30:58.471 --> 01:31:03.000
they don't take that into consideration when they dismiss it as being some ego

1629
01:31:03.001 --> 01:31:07.290
propping device.
Oh,
what are you doing?
Curls.
They're getting built up your quads,

1630
01:31:07.291 --> 01:31:09.150
man,
you're fucking smart.
You know,

1631
01:31:09.151 --> 01:31:12.750
they like somehow or another try to diminish the,
um,

1632
01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:16.830
the intelligence of what you're doing by pointing out the,
the benefits of it.

1633
01:31:17.090 --> 01:31:20.520
But I like pointing out that your muscles are larger and stronger somehow.

1634
01:31:20.521 --> 01:31:23.030
You must be stupid.
Like,
you know what I mean?
It's like,
it's a,

1635
01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:26.640
it's an adorable thing that they do.
It's like,
it's because it's so transparent.

1636
01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:27.631
It's so obvious.

1637
01:31:27.631 --> 01:31:32.310
Like you're being so silly that you're going through life with that shit body.

1638
01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:33.540
That's what's really going on.

1639
01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:38.370
Like if you just exercise like pretty much everybody that exercises get
stronger.

1640
01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:42.750
It really works.
Yeah.
They've been doing it for years.
I just keep doing it,
man.

1641
01:31:42.751 --> 01:31:45.150
You just keep doing it.
You get stronger when you get stronger,

1642
01:31:45.151 --> 01:31:48.710
your body works better.
When your body works better,
you do stuff easier.
Well,

1643
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:50.370
it's so clearly the ego,

1644
01:31:50.371 --> 01:31:54.480
just restructuring of value systems so that they can be on top.
What's important?

1645
01:31:54.481 --> 01:31:56.430
Well not this,
that's actually a diminishment,

1646
01:31:56.431 --> 01:32:00.010
so therefore I'm on top and pretending that somehow or another

1647
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:03.670
<v 0>that if you are fit or if you are,
if you're muscular,
strong,</v>

1648
01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:04.721
it's somehow or another,

1649
01:32:04.721 --> 01:32:08.200
you must be diminished mentally because that energy that you put into getting

1650
01:32:08.201 --> 01:32:11.210
those muscles,
you didn't,
you weren't studying and you want to go,
I'm a,

1651
01:32:11.211 --> 01:32:15.310
why are you studying all day?
You fuck you stunning.
23 hours a day.
You're not.

1652
01:32:15.311 --> 01:32:18.580
Then you have an hour to go to the gym just to go to the gym.
It's not that hard.

1653
01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:21.610
Like you're talking about something that's not nearly as difficult as you try to

1654
01:32:21.611 --> 01:32:21.911
predict your,

1655
01:32:21.911 --> 01:32:25.540
you're pretending it's like a lifestyle 24 seven choice that you have to make

1656
01:32:25.541 --> 01:32:28.730
and you got to keep away from knowledge.
And you know,
Doug,

1657
01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:31.720
you could get just as smart,
you know John Danaher,

1658
01:32:31.721 --> 01:32:34.450
who's like one of the most brilliant people you're ever gonna meet Jujitsu

1659
01:32:34.451 --> 01:32:38.860
instructor from New York.
He was a,
it was a philosophy major,
you know,

1660
01:32:38.861 --> 01:32:40.840
and he was a bodybuilder at the same time.

1661
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:43.480
I mean he was just big when he was like in the power lifting and shit when he

1662
01:32:43.481 --> 01:32:48.400
first found Jujitsu and he took two Jitsu because he wanted to have some skills

1663
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:52.150
and Casey was in altercations as a bouncer cause he was making a living doing

1664
01:32:52.151 --> 01:32:55.000
that at night while he was a student.
You know?

1665
01:32:55.001 --> 01:33:00.001
So it's like this idea that somehow or another strength or masculinity,

1666
01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:03.270
it's like,
it goes hand in hand with being an idiot.
Like it's,

1667
01:33:03.271 --> 01:33:07.050
it's hilarious that they've actually managed to somehow or another and not,

1668
01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:09.100
they like it some concerted effort,

1669
01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:13.060
but the week souls amongst us that don't want to really look at themselves

1670
01:33:13.061 --> 01:33:13.910
honestly and well,

1671
01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:18.020
and then the meatheads have the same prejudice on the other side.
They think,
oh,

1672
01:33:18.850 --> 01:33:23.140
you're doing yoga.
We're
exactly,

1673
01:33:23.141 --> 01:33:26.150
so they have the same prejudice when really eventually,
you know,

1674
01:33:26.170 --> 01:33:28.720
the wisest stuff.
We're just going to drop all that and say,
Hey,

1675
01:33:28.750 --> 01:33:32.980
I want to fucking do it all because that's what's capable for the human being.

1676
01:33:33.010 --> 01:33:36.710
That's what we're here to do.
Experience everything we can.
Yeah.

1677
01:33:36.730 --> 01:33:38.800
That's what we really should all be doing.

1678
01:33:38.801 --> 01:33:42.100
What's like this idea that you have to be in one camp or another camp?

1679
01:33:42.101 --> 01:33:44.920
Like were we closer to each other than we like to think.

1680
01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:48.490
And the moment we start looking at each other as like us or them,
you know,

1681
01:33:48.491 --> 01:33:51.850
like I had conversations with,
with people and they find out that,
you know,

1682
01:33:51.851 --> 01:33:55.360
you voted Democrat,
like,
oh Christ,
you're fucking one of them.

1683
01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:57.790
You mean you're telling me?
And they're like,
well,
ramp up their voice.
Like,

1684
01:33:57.791 --> 01:34:01.710
whoa dude,
relax,
relax.
You know like we're,

1685
01:34:01.711 --> 01:34:04.930
we're not necessarily in an argument here,
you know,

1686
01:34:04.931 --> 01:34:08.170
I guarantee you there's a lot of shit that I agree with that you agree with too.

1687
01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:11.170
Like we're,
we're probably a lot closer than you think.
A lot of things.

1688
01:34:11.650 --> 01:34:15.130
Well you know what was the biggest fucking Muslim in this country so Obama never

1689
01:34:15.131 --> 01:34:16.960
getting those conversations like chorus dude,

1690
01:34:16.961 --> 01:34:19.240
I can't even talk to you about that.
I don't even know where to begin.

1691
01:34:19.241 --> 01:34:20.650
I don't know.
I don't know where this is going.

1692
01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:23.350
But like they think that you are the enemy.

1693
01:34:23.351 --> 01:34:26.890
Like you get roped into the enemy and some you get categorized.

1694
01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:31.000
But if there was no democrat and there was no republican,
there was no teams,

1695
01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:36.310
there was just a bunch of stances and positions on issues that we would be,

1696
01:34:37.001 --> 01:34:40.840
we would all be way closer then when Dan you think it's just when you vote,

1697
01:34:40.841 --> 01:34:43.930
when you have representatives and one is blue and one is red and you're playing

1698
01:34:43.931 --> 01:34:47.590
some weird fucking like board game.
Like what is this?

1699
01:34:47.710 --> 01:34:51.010
There's a blue team and a red team.
Don't fucking stupid.
That is,

1700
01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:55.750
there's a blue states and red states like the divisiveness of that,
the almost,

1701
01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:58.070
almost something designed

1702
01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:01.970
<v 2>to keep people at odds with each other because if you looked at it in terms of</v>

1703
01:35:01.971 --> 01:35:04.130
just,
just the issues,

1704
01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:07.430
then you could debate the issues individually on their own merit and they

1705
01:35:07.431 --> 01:35:12.290
wouldn't be attached.
Like pro life is constantly attached to the right,

1706
01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:17.090
you know,
um,
there's certain gay rights constantly attached to the left,

1707
01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:22.220
you know,
a health care reform left,
you know,
finances,

1708
01:35:22.221 --> 01:35:27.110
anything,
finances,
anything that benefits business,
right?
It's hilarious.

1709
01:35:27.111 --> 01:35:31.170
It's so adorable that they've managed to pack package,
all this stuff there,

1710
01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:35.810
there a hacking into the dark side of tribalism and the dark side of tribalism

1711
01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:39.650
is when you have a group and fuck everybody else cause they're trying to take

1712
01:35:39.651 --> 01:35:41.230
what I have.
And all of these,

1713
01:35:41.231 --> 01:35:46.231
setting up of these camps is like a mental hack into this instinctual quality

1714
01:35:46.431 --> 01:35:50.750
that we developed.
And you see it and even sports fans,
you know,
these hooligans,

1715
01:35:50.751 --> 01:35:54.680
when their English soccer team in red wins or the blue one winds,

1716
01:35:54.681 --> 01:35:58.140
that's their whole life.
They're punching people,
they're stabbing people,
you,

1717
01:35:58.190 --> 01:35:59.510
they're trampling people.
Whatever.

1718
01:35:59.511 --> 01:36:03.500
This crazy identification with someone who's putting a ball in a net,

1719
01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:08.700
but it's the tribalism aspect that people are playing on and I think politicians

1720
01:36:08.721 --> 01:36:11.060
and everybody have kind of played to that.

1721
01:36:11.061 --> 01:36:13.460
When we realize when you level all of that,
yeah,

1722
01:36:13.461 --> 01:36:17.060
you can have your tribe and that's good,
but beware of the dark side,

1723
01:36:17.061 --> 01:36:19.610
which is these are my people.
Fuck everybody else.

1724
01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:23.870
Even the preppers kind of doomsday preppers have this kind of idea like I got

1725
01:36:23.871 --> 01:36:27.260
this thing and fuck everybody else.
Those people are crazy.

1726
01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:29.000
That shit is not going to work.

1727
01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:32.120
You're going to take your shit and everyone's going to find out.

1728
01:36:32.121 --> 01:36:36.110
They saw you on TV dummy.
They know where you have your pickles varied.

1729
01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:38.160
Like what are you looking at?

1730
01:36:38.161 --> 01:36:40.670
What kind of an asshole or you that prepare us for the worst,

1731
01:36:40.671 --> 01:36:43.850
but shows everybody your house and this is where we have our ammo.

1732
01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:45.470
Oh well now I know where to get the ammo.

1733
01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:47.360
When the fucking Zombie apocalypse hits,

1734
01:36:47.361 --> 01:36:50.690
I just get into the garage and I got the ammo and then you decide which family

1735
01:36:50.691 --> 01:36:53.630
with two kids comes knocking on your door.
You put give the food to.

1736
01:36:53.631 --> 01:36:56.540
It's just this kind of weird,
it's crazy.
It's this kind of weird thing.

1737
01:36:56.541 --> 01:36:58.790
Whereas I think seeing everybody is,

1738
01:36:58.970 --> 01:37:03.020
that could be me in a different circumstance and a different way.
That's me.
Oh,

1739
01:37:03.021 --> 01:37:04.340
that's me.
That's me.

1740
01:37:04.341 --> 01:37:07.220
That's a really cool practice to do actually that I've done as well.

1741
01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:11.300
Go out to a beach somewhere and imagine yourself as each individual.
Oh,

1742
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:12.111
that's me.

1743
01:37:12.111 --> 01:37:15.590
I can see maybe where my thoughts have created this body type and this thing.

1744
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:17.270
And obviously you're just playing a game,

1745
01:37:17.271 --> 01:37:21.110
but you're putting yourself actually in everybody's position and understanding

1746
01:37:21.410 --> 01:37:24.410
they're not that fucking different.
You know,
they just had different genetics,

1747
01:37:24.530 --> 01:37:27.770
different backgrounds and different choices that they made.
Yeah,
I've,

1748
01:37:27.780 --> 01:37:32.180
I've talked about it on stage that I had this experience where I wrote about it.

1749
01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:36.320
Um,
I had this experience when my,
uh,

1750
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:42.320
my first daughter was about to be born and I was in Hawaii and I was on a boat

1751
01:37:42.650 --> 01:37:45.130
and I was super high and uh,

1752
01:37:45.170 --> 01:37:48.290
these dolphins were jumping around next to the boat and I was just,

1753
01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:50.390
I was on this insane edible.

1754
01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:55.400
I was so far gone that I had this like weird connection with these and

1755
01:37:56.970 --> 01:38:01.970
<v 0>I realized like how intelligent they are and I thought like a wonder if they're</v>

1756
01:38:02.191 --> 01:38:05.670
like people,
I wonder if like I lived at dolphins life,
I would be like a dolphin.

1757
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:07.920
Like if you lived in that water,
like if you have,

1758
01:38:07.950 --> 01:38:10.980
you think of you who you are and if you were in a dolphin's body,

1759
01:38:10.981 --> 01:38:12.540
I wonder if you literally would be a dolphin.

1760
01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:14.280
Then I thought about it and I was like,

1761
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:18.600
what if that's how every human being is that we're all exactly the same thing,

1762
01:38:18.601 --> 01:38:21.150
but we are living through different biological filters,

1763
01:38:21.151 --> 01:38:24.960
different life experiences,
different genetics.
But if you live my life,

1764
01:38:24.961 --> 01:38:27.990
you would be me.
And if I lived your life I would be you.

1765
01:38:28.050 --> 01:38:29.280
And then it's an illusion.

1766
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:33.110
And that's what the illusion of separateness is really all about the deal.

1767
01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:35.940
Everyone's like,
there's not an illusion dude.
This guy beat the shit out of me.

1768
01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:38.190
I don't know him.
He's not me.
I'm not in him.
That guy's a dick.

1769
01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:41.160
You know what I mean?
Like people have that,
oh,
that girl fucking cut my hair.

1770
01:38:41.161 --> 01:38:43.100
That is not me cutting my hair turns me.

1771
01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:46.190
We are not one I'm going to fucking stab at home.
You know?

1772
01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:50.310
But if you lived her life,
that's where the illusion is.

1773
01:38:50.311 --> 01:38:55.311
The illusion is that because we live these separate experiences that if we all

1774
01:38:55.441 --> 01:38:59.790
had the agreement that we treat each other as if it was us living another life,

1775
01:39:00.180 --> 01:39:05.100
the world would instantly be better instantly if we could pass that.

1776
01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:06.390
I mean,
everybody wants to pass.

1777
01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:09.960
There's all sorts of radical ideologies that people push.

1778
01:39:09.961 --> 01:39:13.800
There's all sorts of radical religions and behavior choices and all sorts of

1779
01:39:13.801 --> 01:39:16.470
different things that people want other people to just subscribe to.

1780
01:39:16.471 --> 01:39:20.490
And one of the people do it here too.
But if it is a really simple one,

1781
01:39:20.580 --> 01:39:22.920
a really simple one that's almost a one liner,

1782
01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:28.020
treat everybody as if it's you living another life.
If you did do that,

1783
01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:30.600
if you,
if,
if it turned out to be true,

1784
01:39:30.601 --> 01:39:35.601
if we some fucking Nobel prize winning an egg had figured out in a laboratory

1785
01:39:36.540 --> 01:39:40.710
that if like you could literally take the essence of who is Aubrey,

1786
01:39:40.711 --> 01:39:42.690
Marcus and throat and Jamie Vernon's body,

1787
01:39:42.691 --> 01:39:44.940
you'd be Jamie if you lived his life up until now,

1788
01:39:44.941 --> 01:39:47.610
if they proved it mathematically.
And I think,

1789
01:39:47.611 --> 01:39:50.580
and I think that's possible and what you're hitting on is,
you know,
I call it,

1790
01:39:50.670 --> 01:39:54.870
so there's the golden rule,
do unto others as you would do unto yourself.

1791
01:39:55.110 --> 01:39:57.780
But I think there's the platinum rule and you know,

1792
01:39:57.781 --> 01:40:02.370
which supersedes that which very well might be do unto others because they are

1793
01:40:02.371 --> 01:40:03.750
yourself.
You know,

1794
01:40:03.810 --> 01:40:07.590
motherfucker just rewrote the golden rule g here that that mother fucker just

1795
01:40:07.591 --> 01:40:10.480
rewrote the golden rule.
It's the platinum role.

1796
01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:15.000
He'll fucking platinum rules better than the golden rule.
Yeah.
Damn Dude,

1797
01:40:15.001 --> 01:40:19.110
that's strong.
That's a very strong statement and you've totally dead on.
Yeah.

1798
01:40:19.170 --> 01:40:23.010
Treat them as if it's you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's a difference.

1799
01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:25.110
Not treat them because it is you.
Yeah.

1800
01:40:25.111 --> 01:40:28.260
Because it is you in a different life and a different filter and different

1801
01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.900
biological switches that have been hit.

1802
01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:35.340
I think that's why it's so hard to be around people that are falling apart.
Um,

1803
01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:38.460
I was at the comedy store the other night and this woman who used to be a

1804
01:40:38.461 --> 01:40:40.200
comedian,
I don't think she's the comedian anymore,

1805
01:40:40.201 --> 01:40:44.460
came around and she was drunk and fucked up and confused and she hadn't done

1806
01:40:44.461 --> 01:40:47.580
standup in a long time.
And she's probably like close to 60 now.

1807
01:40:47.610 --> 01:40:51.430
She's old as fuck,
but it just never worked out.
She's never,
she was like,
Oh,

1808
01:40:51.431 --> 01:40:53.590
me an open miker or 20 years ago.

1809
01:40:53.630 --> 01:40:57.850
But she would always kind of hang around still and,
uh,
to see her now,

1810
01:40:58.690 --> 01:41:02.630
you know,
it's,
it's,
it's really hard to see someone like,
like she did.

1811
01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:04.810
She would try to talk to us,
but no one could tell him anything.

1812
01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:06.850
And everyone's terrified.
She's going to say,
Hey,

1813
01:41:07.590 --> 01:41:10.270
can you guys put me up some night,
put me up on your show.
You know,

1814
01:41:10.271 --> 01:41:14.380
everyone's terrified.
She's gonna ask for some sort of comedy help,
you know.

1815
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:18.250
But you've got to think like what does it feel like to be that person?
Like what,

1816
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:21.040
what,
what's synapses don't fire?

1817
01:41:21.041 --> 01:41:24.490
What life experience stunts your emotional growth.

1818
01:41:24.670 --> 01:41:26.800
What puts you in a state of denial?

1819
01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:30.910
What gives you these blinders that you can't realize the fact that the audience

1820
01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:33.460
sees you in a way that you don't see yourself.
So this is,

1821
01:41:33.461 --> 01:41:36.040
this comedy thing is never going to work.
Like she just fucking,

1822
01:41:36.041 --> 01:41:38.320
you don't even know what you look like.
You don't know what you sound like.

1823
01:41:38.321 --> 01:41:39.580
You don't know how you behave and,

1824
01:41:40.290 --> 01:41:45.130
and then you see it manifesting itself 20 plus years later in this disastrous

1825
01:41:45.131 --> 01:41:49.480
rack of,
of kind of crazy lady.
And you're like,
wow man,
that could have been me.

1826
01:41:49.690 --> 01:41:53.430
You know,
if I was born in her body and lived her life and you,

1827
01:41:54.210 --> 01:41:56.050
you take into consideration how,

1828
01:41:56.590 --> 01:42:01.480
how difficult it is to turn from that state and improve.

1829
01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:03.760
Like we almost give someone no chance.

1830
01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:07.960
Like you never meet someone who's a total fucking loser at 40 and then you meet

1831
01:42:07.961 --> 01:42:12.250
him at 45 and he's like the best guy ever.
Like nobody does it.

1832
01:42:12.300 --> 01:42:14.460
<v 1>Minimum is a motherfucker.
It's really hard to change.</v>

1833
01:42:14.461 --> 01:42:17.310
But when you have that attitude where you start looking at people just as you

1834
01:42:17.311 --> 01:42:21.030
said,
that could be me.
The only proper response is empathy.

1835
01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:22.380
You know,

1836
01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:25.530
even if it's someone that perpetrates something against you and this is,

1837
01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:28.230
you know,
a really challenging thing to do.
Yeah.
You know,

1838
01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:31.170
you want to prevent that.
If someone goes to fuck you up,
then fuck them up,

1839
01:42:31.171 --> 01:42:31.711
that's fine.

1840
01:42:31.711 --> 01:42:35.280
That's your right to defend yourself and protect but not do it out of anger.

1841
01:42:35.281 --> 01:42:38.010
Do it out of necessity,
out of necessity.

1842
01:42:38.011 --> 01:42:42.000
And then the only feeling that you should have towards that is a feeling of
pity.

1843
01:42:42.030 --> 01:42:46.200
It's too bad that that person got to a place where they had to do that,

1844
01:42:46.201 --> 01:42:49.410
where that was,
what their decision mechanism was.

1845
01:42:49.590 --> 01:42:51.360
And it doesn't mean that you just accept it,

1846
01:42:51.361 --> 01:42:55.590
but it means that that's really the only thing.
But instead we like to,
you know,

1847
01:42:55.650 --> 01:43:00.390
keep up this illusion of separateness.
Like fuck that guy and shit.
Yeah,

1848
01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:04.260
exactly.
But really only pity,
only pity and empathy really come from that.

1849
01:43:04.261 --> 01:43:09.090
And that's the,
that's a real state of bliss.
You know,
like the Tibetan monks,

1850
01:43:09.091 --> 01:43:11.370
that's what they're meditating on all the time.

1851
01:43:11.371 --> 01:43:15.300
It's getting to that state of empathy.
Well,
to get to that state of empathy,

1852
01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:18.810
just look at everybody like their yourself and that's the key way to get in

1853
01:43:18.811 --> 01:43:22.980
there.
Yeah,
try,
try pushing that in the public school system.

1854
01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:27.210
I just,
that was one of the key tenants of the public school system.

1855
01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:30.870
That would work,
man.
Yeah,
it really would work.
It's almost like a little,

1856
01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:36.060
a simple key unlocks a totally different start doing and start doing little,

1857
01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:39.060
you know,
little things where it's like,
what would you know,

1858
01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:43.020
put yourself in that other person's body like,
right from their perspective.

1859
01:43:43.021 --> 01:43:44.880
Or I don't know what school drills you could do.

1860
01:43:44.881 --> 01:43:49.270
Like write a story as this person,
your friend,
you know,
and,

1861
01:43:49.271 --> 01:43:52.360
and then tell him what,
you know,
feel what it's like to go through that.

1862
01:43:52.361 --> 01:43:56.810
Like live these other multiple lives and you'll have,
you'll understand that.

1863
01:43:56.811 --> 01:43:59.570
Yeah.
You know,
that could be me and what and,

1864
01:43:59.620 --> 01:44:01.880
and it'll start to evaporate that from an early age.

1865
01:44:01.881 --> 01:44:03.710
I think putting in the school system is brilliant.

1866
01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:05.120
I think that's what needs to happen.

1867
01:44:05.670 --> 01:44:08.640
<v 0>Yeah.
There's a lot of things that need to happen with the school system,</v>

1868
01:44:08.641 --> 01:44:12.600
but that would definitely help the way that was taught as a tenant and school

1869
01:44:12.601 --> 01:44:15.740
instead of reading the fucking pledge of allegiance.
Right.
You know,

1870
01:44:15.741 --> 01:44:19.260
I mean to the republic for which it stands.
Stop.
What does that mean?

1871
01:44:19.290 --> 01:44:21.900
Do you guys know what that means?
What does that mean?
What does that mean?

1872
01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:22.890
One Nation under God,

1873
01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:26.100
you know that that didn't even exist kids until the fucking red scare of the

1874
01:44:26.101 --> 01:44:30.270
1950s he used to say one nation indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.

1875
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:35.310
But when we had a fight off the Goddamn commies,
we put it God under God.

1876
01:44:35.311 --> 01:44:36.840
You fucks.
I mean,

1877
01:44:36.841 --> 01:44:39.150
most people think that that was like how this nation was founded.

1878
01:44:39.151 --> 01:44:41.100
One Nation under God.
No,
that,
that,

1879
01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:45.490
that was in the fifties but everybody was losing their fucking mind and people

1880
01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:49.200
were going on trial on a regular basis for being communists.

1881
01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:52.140
They were blackballing people that look,

1882
01:44:52.590 --> 01:44:57.240
think of the crazy shit that you and I have done and think of if we were living

1883
01:44:57.241 --> 01:45:01.470
in the 1950s and they,
I did.
Did you in fact go to the jungle of Peru,

1884
01:45:01.471 --> 01:45:02.370
Mr Marcus?

1885
01:45:02.610 --> 01:45:07.610
And did you in fact in by been several toxic medicines you would,

1886
01:45:08.671 --> 01:45:12.060
you'd look like a fucking complete nut if they brought you into some sort of a

1887
01:45:12.061 --> 01:45:15.960
court setting in the 1950s but back then you could even go to a communist

1888
01:45:15.961 --> 01:45:18.030
meeting.
You couldn't go.
Like,
what is this about?

1889
01:45:18.031 --> 01:45:21.420
Like what are you guys pushing you pushing comp socialism and what does that

1890
01:45:21.421 --> 01:45:24.090
mean?
Like no one,
you know,
you do whatever you want.

1891
01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:27.540
Like do you get paid by the government?
Like do you,
how do you contribute?

1892
01:45:27.541 --> 01:45:28.440
Where's the money coming from?

1893
01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:31.770
Like maybe just go and try to figure out what the fuck everyone's talking about.

1894
01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:33.900
And especially amongst creative folk.

1895
01:45:34.170 --> 01:45:36.450
I'm sure there's always been a lot of alternative thinkers,

1896
01:45:36.451 --> 01:45:39.080
whether Erin or on the right track.
Sure.

1897
01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:42.360
There's been a lot of weird people that think outside the box always.

1898
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:45.760
So in the 1950s these guys are probably looking at communism and go,
okay,

1899
01:45:45.761 --> 01:45:50.430
and let's see,
look,
I got my fucking,
my fortune read by dianetics wants,
whatever.

1900
01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:53.280
I did one of those tress meters.
I said,
okay,
let me see what you got.

1901
01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:57.000
What have I got on the list?
Because of that man,
you know,
like this was,

1902
01:45:57.001 --> 01:46:01.290
this was what was going on when they put under God in our pledge of allegiance.

1903
01:46:01.291 --> 01:46:04.880
It was that kind of madness,
insane thinking they had to put,

1904
01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:08.160
<v 1>you know,
yeah,
well these witch hunts have existed.
And again,</v>

1905
01:46:08.161 --> 01:46:12.060
tapping into these old mechanism,
these,
these fear responses,

1906
01:46:12.061 --> 01:46:15.570
these tribalism instincts,
and you know,
these witch hunts,

1907
01:46:15.571 --> 01:46:17.220
we think all the witch hunts are over.
Well,

1908
01:46:17.250 --> 01:46:20.700
at one point they're called witch hunts because they were literally hunting,

1909
01:46:20.701 --> 01:46:24.250
which is throwing them in the water and seeing if they would swim,
you know?

1910
01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:28.350
And if they drowned,
then they weren't a which if they swim,
they were,
which,

1911
01:46:28.351 --> 01:46:29.520
and even worst should happen to him.

1912
01:46:29.970 --> 01:46:34.550
<v 0>Very good.
You're completely fucked.
Either way.
They weren't a wish.</v>

1913
01:46:34.551 --> 01:46:38.890
So sorry about your kid,
Mr. Johnson.
I thought she was a witch.

1914
01:46:39.010 --> 01:46:40.940
It turns out she was just a shitty swimmer.

1915
01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:45.520
<v 1>Yeah.
So that was the witch hunt.
But that's going on today and it's going on.</v>

1916
01:46:45.521 --> 01:46:49.560
You know,
the area that we see at the most is in the psychedelic medicines.

1917
01:46:49.590 --> 01:46:50.310
You know,
people

1918
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:54.600
<v 2>are being hunted for manipulating their own consciousness.</v>

1919
01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:59.040
You know,
even with scientific research coming back that it's beneficial.

1920
01:46:59.220 --> 01:47:04.220
They're being hunted down in these kind of crazy ways and thrown in cages for

1921
01:47:04.471 --> 01:47:07.020
manipulating their own consciousness.
It's crazy.
Yeah.

1922
01:47:07.021 --> 01:47:10.410
There's not too many people getting arrested and thrown in jail for doing it.

1923
01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:13.650
They're getting arrested and thrown in jail for selling it.
But either way,

1924
01:47:13.670 --> 01:47:17.070
you know,
it's,
it's all stupid.
You should be able to sell things that are good.

1925
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:18.390
It's really that simple.

1926
01:47:18.420 --> 01:47:21.540
This idea of these people that are non-experienced in these,

1927
01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:23.370
these states of mind they'd done,

1928
01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:25.890
they don't know really know what they're talking about.
From a personal level.

1929
01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:29.610
Dictating the legality of those experiences is ridiculous.

1930
01:47:29.611 --> 01:47:31.440
And if those are the people that are locking you up,

1931
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:36.090
I'm kind of on your side like you should be able to sell mushrooms.

1932
01:47:36.450 --> 01:47:39.960
Did you grow it?
Yeah,
you should.
You deserve some money.
Did you grow tomatoes?

1933
01:47:40.050 --> 01:47:42.200
Yeah,
I'll pay you for those two.
I don't want to grow.

1934
01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:44.880
I don't want to empower girls to get it.
People don't sell it.

1935
01:47:44.910 --> 01:47:46.830
What the fuck are we talking?
He's a farmer.

1936
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:50.790
He's a fucking farmer of awesome shit.
And that's what a mushroom dealer is.

1937
01:47:50.791 --> 01:47:55.110
He's a farmer of awesome shit.
He's on a drug dealer.
You've done and you're,

1938
01:47:55.111 --> 01:47:59.130
you're subject to the whims of these people and that's the,

1939
01:47:59.150 --> 01:48:02.280
the people that are willing to lock you in a cage in the first place.

1940
01:48:02.490 --> 01:48:03.241
They're fools.

1941
01:48:03.241 --> 01:48:06.570
Like this is like the worst way to deal with someone who's doing something to

1942
01:48:06.571 --> 01:48:10.050
alter their consciousness.
To put them in a fucking cage,
I guess is the worst.

1943
01:48:10.110 --> 01:48:13.320
You're going to think he was paranoid before.
You know?

1944
01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:15.360
Imagine if you go to jail for weed,

1945
01:48:15.361 --> 01:48:20.160
how fucking paranoid you get when you get high.
Yeah,
I mean it's preposterous.

1946
01:48:20.161 --> 01:48:23.970
And imagine if we were the owner of a,
of a pretty smart pet.
You know,

1947
01:48:23.971 --> 01:48:26.230
let's say we had a pet chimpanzee,
you know,

1948
01:48:26.231 --> 01:48:30.900
it's a very smart pet and the chimpanzee found something that reliably made him

1949
01:48:30.901 --> 01:48:34.020
laugh his ass off and made him a better chimpanzee.
You know,

1950
01:48:34.021 --> 01:48:38.520
what kind of owner would we be if we took that chimp and then threw him in the

1951
01:48:38.521 --> 01:48:42.330
worst conditions in the tiniest cage and took away his freedom for doing that?

1952
01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:45.750
We'd think that person is a fucking desperate call animal control.

1953
01:48:45.870 --> 01:48:48.720
He's a fucking crazy person.
It's called law enforcement.
Aubrey,

1954
01:48:48.930 --> 01:48:52.920
you're obviously not aware of what goes on there on the highways and byways of

1955
01:48:52.921 --> 01:48:56.070
America's great.
I pledge of allegiance to the flag.

1956
01:48:56.940 --> 01:49:01.170
Instead I pledged to treat everybody as if it's me living another life.
Yeah.

1957
01:49:01.650 --> 01:49:04.380
If we started off every class like that,
every,

1958
01:49:04.381 --> 01:49:06.810
every school I pledge to treat,

1959
01:49:06.811 --> 01:49:10.800
everybody I meet is if it's me living another life,
everybody adheres to that.

1960
01:49:10.860 --> 01:49:14.070
Everybody across the board got,
damn,
it would be a better place.

1961
01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.340
Wouldn't be so much ferocious competition now that would suck.

1962
01:49:17.970 --> 01:49:22.140
Some Fun Shit happens when you don't like your opponent.
You know?
That's true.

1963
01:49:22.141 --> 01:49:25.020
But I don't know that,
that that has to go,
you know?
I mean,

1964
01:49:25.021 --> 01:49:27.960
I think that you can look at that opponent like,
all right,

1965
01:49:27.961 --> 01:49:31.590
he's the motherfucking mountain that's going to bring the best out of me.

1966
01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:33.750
You know?
And then so you're going to want to find that.

1967
01:49:33.751 --> 01:49:36.030
Like I love it when Daniel Cormier,
I said,

1968
01:49:36.031 --> 01:49:38.610
I mean obviously the fight wasn't that great,
but he said,
you know,

1969
01:49:38.611 --> 01:49:43.170
I've been waiting my whole life for a man who's my equal Jon Jones.
Be that man.

1970
01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:47.560
You know,
that idea I think is embodies the beauty of what MMA can be.

1971
01:49:47.561 --> 01:49:51.370
It's like finding somebody that will push you to the point that you never been

1972
01:49:51.371 --> 01:49:54.760
pushed before.
And I think that'll still exist even in this state.

1973
01:49:54.761 --> 01:49:58.570
You'll just look at them like,
that could be me.
This is me.
No worries.

1974
01:49:58.640 --> 01:50:02.770
We'll see what we can do to bring the best out of each other.
Yeah,
but not a few.

1975
01:50:02.830 --> 01:50:07.300
If you hate them,
it's better.
Federal Wise,
rich two people hate each other.

1976
01:50:07.301 --> 01:50:11.350
It's better to watch Richard some shit.
Talking going on.

1977
01:50:11.580 --> 01:50:13.690
Like we were talking about the chocolate Dell,
Tito Ortiz fight.

1978
01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:16.400
Like when Chuck Liddell and Tito,
they didn't like each other.

1979
01:50:16.401 --> 01:50:18.850
This just a lot of bad blood.
So when chuck beat up Tito,

1980
01:50:18.851 --> 01:50:21.400
that Ra was like extra juicy.
Oh you know,

1981
01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:24.760
it was extra crazy to watch because there was so much like when Ronda Rousey

1982
01:50:24.761 --> 01:50:26.950
fought Misha Tate and they went through that whole season,

1983
01:50:26.951 --> 01:50:30.530
the ultimate fighter together and fuck you and as long as fucking craziness and

1984
01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:34.510
all this anger and then Rhonda beats her ass and gets her in an arm bar again

1985
01:50:34.511 --> 01:50:38.200
after all that,
like you're like,
wow,
that was wild to watch.
You know,
it's,

1986
01:50:38.201 --> 01:50:40.480
you're watching something like super primal.

1987
01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:43.900
Like you're not just watching it on a tactical level where you watch two very

1988
01:50:43.901 --> 01:50:46.660
high level martial arts.
Like she was the first person to push her,
you know,

1989
01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:49.780
deep into the second and third round.
I think she caught her in the fourth round,

1990
01:50:49.781 --> 01:50:52.300
if I remember correctly.
It was third or fourth.
Um,

1991
01:50:52.330 --> 01:50:56.890
but point being like they just didn't like each other and that made you choose

1992
01:50:56.891 --> 01:50:59.740
here.
They're amazing.
Raises the emotional stakes.

1993
01:50:59.741 --> 01:51:01.470
And I think that's also what's interesting too.

1994
01:51:01.471 --> 01:51:05.350
Like how were they going to perform when the stakes are even this high and even

1995
01:51:05.351 --> 01:51:07.900
this site and even this high and when they hate each other,

1996
01:51:07.901 --> 01:51:12.310
you know that it just escalates things to an even higher degree.

1997
01:51:12.311 --> 01:51:15.850
And that's I think why we even like watching the playoffs is it's not that

1998
01:51:15.851 --> 01:51:18.520
somebody gets a little trophy and that's part of it,
but it's,

1999
01:51:18.730 --> 01:51:20.110
oh now the stakes are higher.

2000
01:51:20.110 --> 01:51:23.440
Now people are going to be crying after the game if they lose and they're going

2001
01:51:23.441 --> 01:51:27.070
to be ecstatic if they win.
And like the regular season when it's like,
yeah,
okay,

2002
01:51:27.071 --> 01:51:29.530
it's just a game.
When the stakes get higher,

2003
01:51:29.531 --> 01:51:33.430
it becomes more interesting because we're interested in the reaction that humans

2004
01:51:33.431 --> 01:51:36.550
are going to have in these different scenarios.
Yeah,
we don't,

2005
01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:40.510
we wonder how we would fare and you know,
I remember,
uh,

2006
01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:42.320
being a kid and uh,

2007
01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:47.340
watching boxing matches and seeing like guys like get beat up against the ropes

2008
01:51:47.531 --> 01:51:50.770
or something like that.
And you know,
you almost like see yourself moving.

2009
01:51:50.780 --> 01:51:53.290
You're like trying to figure out,
well,
should he do,
he's got to get out of there.

2010
01:51:53.291 --> 01:51:56.260
He's going to hit that guy like,
but you don't really know how to fight,

2011
01:51:56.350 --> 01:51:58.930
but you're still watching it and you're just like,
ah,
ah.

2012
01:51:59.050 --> 01:52:01.990
It's like you're putting yourself sort of in there in some way.
You know,

2013
01:52:01.991 --> 01:52:03.790
you're watching it,
you want your,
you know,

2014
01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:06.280
especially back then I always had a guy,
you know,
it was,

2015
01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:08.620
I was rooting for this guy.
It was written for that guy.
You know,

2016
01:52:08.621 --> 01:52:11.050
you always like boxing fans would always have like,

2017
01:52:11.110 --> 01:52:13.680
you'd have like a guy you'd pick like I'm a Dale,
a horror fan,

2018
01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:17.740
fucking bro who this is a Chavez.
The Shit,
like people would have those,

2019
01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:20.140
those fucking guys that they would stick with.

2020
01:52:20.410 --> 01:52:22.660
And when your guys getting beat up or he's in trouble,
you know,

2021
01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:26.850
appreciating it on a technical level,
you're almost like,
oh,

2022
01:52:27.060 --> 01:52:28.600
you're almost like getting beat up yourself.

2023
01:52:28.900 --> 01:52:31.450
I remember one of the most terrifying moments I had because I,

2024
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:34.060
I've done striking since I was little,
never that serious,

2025
01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:37.960
but I had a lot of instructors who were very complimentary early,
you know,

2026
01:52:37.961 --> 01:52:41.860
so they had me believing that man,
Aubrey,
you hit someone,
they're done son.

2027
01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:44.260
You know,
like I had this kind of false belief.

2028
01:52:44.261 --> 01:52:46.940
And obviously once I started sparring,
I realized that that wasn't the case.

2029
01:52:46.941 --> 01:52:50.840
But I had some,
had some remnants of that that I was carrying.

2030
01:52:50.841 --> 01:52:54.680
And then I saw Kimbo slice in one of these street fights,
right?
Oh yeah.

2031
01:52:54.681 --> 01:52:59.270
And in bare knuckle fight and this other huge dude catches him with a left hook

2032
01:52:59.630 --> 01:53:04.280
and Kimbo just drops his hands,
go get me good,
fuck off,
fit me again.

2033
01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:08.810
And just leans forward with his head and the other dude hits him again and does

2034
01:53:08.811 --> 01:53:11.120
nothing.
It does nothing now.

2035
01:53:11.121 --> 01:53:14.870
You're dead motherfucker and it catches him with this upper cut and just blows

2036
01:53:14.871 --> 01:53:17.570
up his face,
exploded his face.
And I was like,

2037
01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:22.190
there's nothing I could do to that guy.
If he was that fired up and charging.

2038
01:53:22.490 --> 01:53:27.020
And it was this terrifying moment where you realize what your boundaries are in

2039
01:53:27.021 --> 01:53:30.050
the world,
you know?
Like I couldn't hit him and knock him out,
you know,

2040
01:53:30.051 --> 01:53:31.790
everything I had been told was bullshit.

2041
01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:36.530
No way I could do anything to that man at that point.
Well,

2042
01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:41.760
physical size and structure,
so giant and he actually knows how to fight too,

2043
01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:45.530
but physical size and structure,
so fucking big.
It's so,
it's so,

2044
01:53:45.590 --> 01:53:48.200
so important when it's,
you know,
we look at,

2045
01:53:48.230 --> 01:53:51.920
in terms of its success in weight classes and the really big strong guys don't

2046
01:53:51.921 --> 01:53:54.740
necessarily tend to be the best guys in the weight class.

2047
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:57.410
It's about like whose body is optimized for that weight class?

2048
01:53:57.411 --> 01:53:59.360
So you don't really want to be carrying around a lot of muscle,

2049
01:53:59.510 --> 01:54:03.260
but if you are and someone's smaller than you,
it makes you better.

2050
01:54:03.930 --> 01:54:08.030
It makes you fucking bigger and stronger and everything works better.

2051
01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:09.620
It might not work as good.

2052
01:54:09.621 --> 01:54:14.621
I guess another guy who's 240 pounds who's like got a leaner body and better

2053
01:54:14.751 --> 01:54:16.250
lungs,
but you know,

2054
01:54:16.251 --> 01:54:21.230
Kimbo slice is a god damn giant human being who can punch people in the face all

2055
01:54:21.231 --> 01:54:26.060
the time with no gloves on.
Yeah.
Like Jesus,
he's fighting again.

2056
01:54:26.061 --> 01:54:29.300
You know,
it's funny,
Ken Shamrock,
he was the guy that,
you know,

2057
01:54:29.301 --> 01:54:33.470
I think never really fought to what his physical capability was like.

2058
01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:36.470
His hardware had a certain potential,
like the limits on it.

2059
01:54:36.471 --> 01:54:38.900
Like if you look at him like a computer,
it's like,
oh,
it's got this much,

2060
01:54:39.230 --> 01:54:41.960
you know,
these attributes,
this much remedy,
this much memory,

2061
01:54:41.961 --> 01:54:45.350
this much ram I blah.
But the software,
running it inside the cage,

2062
01:54:45.530 --> 01:54:49.320
I felt like never optimize what his gifts were.
You know,

2063
01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:52.250
it's another one of those interesting things where it's psychologically,

2064
01:54:52.251 --> 01:54:56.480
it didn't bring the best out of what his frame could be.
Yeah.

2065
01:54:56.481 --> 01:54:57.500
That's interesting man.
You know,

2066
01:54:57.501 --> 01:55:00.920
he had problems before you ever even got on the ultimate fighter was his knees.

2067
01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:03.080
His knees are pretty significantly diminished.

2068
01:55:03.081 --> 01:55:05.000
He has like serious like bone on bone,

2069
01:55:05.150 --> 01:55:07.880
like arthritis type conditions in his knees.

2070
01:55:08.130 --> 01:55:12.650
And so like for him like grappling,
is it an issue kickings and issue.

2071
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:16.670
All those things are issues,
you know and he,
you know,

2072
01:55:16.671 --> 01:55:20.000
he had a lifetime of sports football and you know,

2073
01:55:20.030 --> 01:55:24.260
did a lot of a striking training.
Obviously all the over the years,
man,

2074
01:55:24.261 --> 01:55:27.380
shoot that shit up.
Especially football.
Football is brutal on the knees.

2075
01:55:27.381 --> 01:55:30.320
Man carrying porn stars in and out of Limos.
That happens.

2076
01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:35.240
He's got to do that a lot.
Do that.
They're probably like fuck him.
He's also,

2077
01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:37.490
he's in a weird time.

2078
01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:42.520
Like he might be like a little too late for like all the rejuvenation shit that

2079
01:55:43.231 --> 01:55:43.980
they're coming up with right

2080
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:47.850
<v 0>now.
Like they're three d mapping meniscus.
Have you seen this dude?</v>

2081
01:55:47.851 --> 01:55:48.684
They have something like,

2082
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:52.290
it was some article about how the Three d mapping essentially what it looks
like.

2083
01:55:52.291 --> 01:55:56.040
It's like a scaffolding for meniscus and there's certain proteins in this.

2084
01:55:56.041 --> 01:55:58.800
They inserted into the space between your joint,
you know,

2085
01:55:58.801 --> 01:56:02.160
where your meniscus says,
which you know now when you get it scope.
Like I,
my,

2086
01:56:02.220 --> 01:56:03.990
I had my left knee scoped a few years back.

2087
01:56:03.991 --> 01:56:06.420
Like you don't get any extra padding back.

2088
01:56:06.450 --> 01:56:09.510
It's it like you're patting has diminished now.
Like it knee doesn't bother me.

2089
01:56:09.690 --> 01:56:11.940
It feels way better than when it was when it was fucked up.

2090
01:56:12.330 --> 01:56:16.800
But now what they're doing is they're just taking it all out and they're putting

2091
01:56:16.801 --> 01:56:17.280
this,

2092
01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:22.280
this three d thing that they three d print and with these proteins and it,

2093
01:56:22.581 --> 01:56:27.030
your body starts building meniscus inside this framework.
Somehow or another,

2094
01:56:27.031 --> 01:56:29.070
I've just,
I might be totally butchering this,

2095
01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:33.250
but essentially they have artificial meniscus for the first time ever.
They,
they,

2096
01:56:33.251 --> 01:56:38.251
they really weren't able to fix that thing is actually two different solutions I

2097
01:56:38.341 --> 01:56:39.900
think currently on the horizon.

2098
01:56:40.230 --> 01:56:43.980
But this need meniscus generated with three d implants.

2099
01:56:44.030 --> 01:56:46.700
<v 2>Look at this so you can watch it.
It's just a perfect fit.
I mean,</v>

2100
01:56:46.701 --> 01:56:50.020
we're going to get to the point where our bodies are just like cars,
you know,

2101
01:56:50.021 --> 01:56:52.610
you can upgrade any system,
you can change it out.

2102
01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:55.490
And I think the crazy thing that we alluded to,

2103
01:56:55.491 --> 01:56:59.690
they'll come a point where I believe we'll be able to upload our consciousness

2104
01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:03.200
into a brand new car.
You know,
and that will be the point of,

2105
01:57:03.530 --> 01:57:07.700
of immortality to a certain degree because you could just keep creating these

2106
01:57:07.701 --> 01:57:12.050
new cars and then just upload your car.
Oh Shit,
I fucking fuck this one up.

2107
01:57:12.051 --> 01:57:16.670
I got cancer,
I crashed it.
No worries me all over into this other one would.

2108
01:57:16.671 --> 01:57:18.990
If that's hell,
what does,
that's how would,

2109
01:57:18.991 --> 01:57:23.991
if the wood of heaven is just getting over this body and achieving the next

2110
01:57:25.461 --> 01:57:26.540
state of consciousness,

2111
01:57:26.541 --> 01:57:31.220
which is nonlocal completely and dependent upon your physical prison,

2112
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:32.241
but you were like,
dude,

2113
01:57:32.241 --> 01:57:35.600
you were just going to get out of jail and you decided to transfer your sentence

2114
01:57:35.601 --> 01:57:37.340
to some cyber prison.
Well,

2115
01:57:37.341 --> 01:57:42.341
you'll live in your own mind forever and ever and ever repeating yourself ad

2116
01:57:42.471 --> 01:57:44.870
nauseum through space.
Instead,

2117
01:57:44.900 --> 01:57:47.720
you could have been one with the great consciousness of the universe.
Obviously,

2118
01:57:47.770 --> 01:57:50.720
if no one who passed over to the other side could communicate,
you know,

2119
01:57:50.721 --> 01:57:55.100
they'd be just yelling from the other doubt.
Do Die.
You'll see.

2120
01:57:55.101 --> 01:57:58.520
It's amazing.
You get to start again.
You get to start again anyways,

2121
01:57:58.540 --> 01:58:01.640
and it's more awesome because you get this side and then that side,

2122
01:58:02.210 --> 01:58:03.530
who fucking knows?
Man,

2123
01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:07.700
I'm not totally enthusiastic about the prospect of becoming one of those gray

2124
01:58:07.701 --> 01:58:10.520
aliens though.
No,
I've been in either,

2125
01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:13.130
I've been talking about that for years

2126
01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:15.270
<v 0>about that simulation theory.</v>

2127
01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:19.140
That's the thing that I talked to this Guy Richard Trill who was from the JPL

2128
01:58:19.141 --> 01:58:22.290
laboratories.
Um,
when I was doing that,
Joe Rogan questions,

2129
01:58:22.291 --> 01:58:23.810
everything show and when you

2130
01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:25.260
<v 2>tops for whatever reason,</v>

2131
01:58:25.261 --> 01:58:30.210
when he talked like a serious legitimate working scientist and an actual,

2132
01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:33.660
you know,
doctor of science,
a talk to them about it,

2133
01:58:33.661 --> 01:58:38.110
it just makes it seem like way more palatable than if you talked to Duncan and

2134
01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:41.580
Duncan talks about it.
It seems a little bit more sexy.
But this guy,

2135
01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:42.370
what he was saying

2136
01:58:42.370 --> 01:58:47.370
<v 0>essentially is that it's basically inevitable that we're going to come up with</v>

2137
01:58:47.951 --> 01:58:52.951
some sort of an artificial reality that is indiscernible from the reality that

2138
01:58:52.961 --> 01:58:56.020
we're currently enjoying.
It's going to be artificial.
We're going to create it.

2139
01:58:56.170 --> 01:58:59.350
We're going to be totally manipulate it.
It's going to evolve over time.

2140
01:58:59.351 --> 01:59:02.220
It's going to get better and better as the technology moves on and on.

2141
01:59:02.230 --> 01:59:04.000
It's going to get to a point where it's you,
you,

2142
01:59:04.001 --> 01:59:07.000
you literally not gonna be able to tell the difference.
And if that's the case,

2143
01:59:07.420 --> 01:59:11.530
has that already happened?
And if it has already happened,

2144
01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:13.060
would you be able to be aware of it?

2145
01:59:13.390 --> 01:59:15.610
What would you be if we had gotten past this?
Well,

2146
01:59:15.611 --> 01:59:18.250
if you go back to fucking gorillas,
you look at gorillas,

2147
01:59:18.251 --> 01:59:19.370
you look at lower primates.

2148
01:59:19.371 --> 01:59:22.810
So look at these dick swinging monkeys hanging out in Africa.
You know,

2149
01:59:22.850 --> 01:59:25.660
just swinging from tree to tree until somebody figured out how to become a

2150
01:59:25.661 --> 01:59:28.920
person right over all these years,
however the hell it went.
Um,

2151
01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:30.430
look at what they look like.

2152
01:59:30.460 --> 01:59:33.880
Look at a gorilla and then look at a person and look at the feminized person of

2153
01:59:33.881 --> 01:59:36.430
the modern era and then look at those.
God Damn Aliens.

2154
01:59:36.520 --> 01:59:39.040
It's almost like that's the archetype.
Like we know that's coming.

2155
01:59:39.460 --> 01:59:42.820
Like we know the big head,
no mouth.
You don't need to talk your,

2156
01:59:42.821 --> 01:59:45.670
you were permanent sunglasses because you fucked up the ozone layer.

2157
01:59:46.150 --> 01:59:50.000
You know your skin is like some sort of a gray bulletproof material that we've,

2158
01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:52.400
you know,
you don't have any sex organs cause you,
you,

2159
01:59:52.401 --> 01:59:57.401
you can experience any pleasurable Kundalini Yoga state in your mind anytime you

2160
01:59:57.431 --> 02:00:00.950
want,
like regular blow jobs.
It's just not that exciting when you can,
you know,

2161
02:00:00.970 --> 02:00:02.680
travel from dimension to dimension.

2162
02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:05.950
That might even be how they were arriving and going back and forth.

2163
02:00:06.340 --> 02:00:10.780
But it might be a part of them.
Mrs. Head,
Mrs Muscle cars,

2164
02:00:10.810 --> 02:00:13.480
Mr [inaudible],
obviously the vision state,

2165
02:00:13.481 --> 02:00:15.400
you don't know if it's real or in your mind,
whatever.

2166
02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:16.600
I don't even make that discernment.

2167
02:00:16.601 --> 02:00:20.100
But when I was in that vision state and talking to him,
they missed it.

2168
02:00:20.330 --> 02:00:22.750
They missed it,
they missed it.
We're lucky like where the right spot.

2169
02:00:22.900 --> 02:00:26.530
We got the honey hole.
This is the goldilocks zone.
We get to access everything,

2170
02:00:26.740 --> 02:00:28.100
we get to access everything and we get,

2171
02:00:28.110 --> 02:00:31.450
it was a time where we're sort of working it out like as a culture people are

2172
02:00:31.451 --> 02:00:35.710
working it out.
I think there's a lot of like the w in the working out,

2173
02:00:35.711 --> 02:00:38.770
there's like a lot of noise and chaos and shit that's going on.

2174
02:00:38.771 --> 02:00:42.730
I think tea party people and fucking occupy people and the,

2175
02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:43.930
you know there's a lot of,

2176
02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:47.680
there's a cult of personality and cultive ideology that's going along with a lot

2177
02:00:47.681 --> 02:00:50.080
of these things,
but throughout all of it,

2178
02:00:50.170 --> 02:00:55.170
throughout people complaining about fat shaming and you know this the,

2179
02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:59.830
although the Weird Uber sensitivity that you see today,

2180
02:01:00.220 --> 02:01:01.450
the trend though,

2181
02:01:01.810 --> 02:01:06.810
all of it seems to be this like kind of like emerging understanding of how we

2182
02:01:06.941 --> 02:01:10.060
interact with each other.
It's like it says this is battles back and forth.

2183
02:01:10.061 --> 02:01:13.360
There's waves,
but like if you're looking at like what is this?

2184
02:01:13.420 --> 02:01:17.020
When this all this water settles,
what am I seeing here?
What am I seeing here?

2185
02:01:17.021 --> 02:01:18.880
I'm seeing a merging,
understanding,

2186
02:01:19.090 --> 02:01:21.910
emerging understanding and along the way there's a lot of competing factions

2187
02:01:21.911 --> 02:01:25.480
that want to be the most morally upstanding and take the high ground and be the

2188
02:01:25.481 --> 02:01:27.880
one who was always there to call bullshit.

2189
02:01:27.881 --> 02:01:32.620
And the social justice warriors that are just looking to be mean so that they

2190
02:01:32.621 --> 02:01:34.900
can prove to you the way to live,
right?

2191
02:01:34.901 --> 02:01:37.450
Like looking to find people aren't living the way they're leaving and just

2192
02:01:37.451 --> 02:01:40.730
shitting all over them.
A shame them into it.
A different way of thinking.

2193
02:01:40.910 --> 02:01:45.440
All this is just a,
is this a merging?
It's an emerging understanding of,

2194
02:01:45.441 --> 02:01:49.430
of what we are and the connectivity that we share and the demands.

2195
02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:53.990
Like when you see like these black lives matter marches and um,

2196
02:01:54.020 --> 02:01:58.280
these protests,
people wouldn't walk around these,
I can't breathe shirts.
They're,

2197
02:01:58.281 --> 02:02:00.140
they're,
they're expanding.

2198
02:02:00.350 --> 02:02:03.710
This understanding of the reach of the upset people.

2199
02:02:03.860 --> 02:02:07.310
Like this is not a minor thing that you can only,
you know,

2200
02:02:07.311 --> 02:02:08.690
vote about every four years.

2201
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:13.870
This is something you can put a giant ripple and the entire culture right now by

2202
02:02:14.271 --> 02:02:16.550
everybody just wearing a bunch of tee shirts that say something on it.

2203
02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.060
And then everybody realizes like,
okay,
this is,

2204
02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:20.870
it's not just a social media trend.

2205
02:02:20.871 --> 02:02:25.500
It's not just a Hashtag on Twitter and Facebook.
It's also like the,
the,

2206
02:02:25.501 --> 02:02:28.520
the entire country,
like a big chunk of it collectively saying,
hey,

2207
02:02:28.521 --> 02:02:33.080
this is fucked up.
Like we can,
we can do better.
And Oh,
we can talk about this.

2208
02:02:33.081 --> 02:02:36.410
And Oh,
you know,
we're connected in some fucking weird way now.

2209
02:02:36.460 --> 02:02:40.580
Well we can kind of organize shit like this collectively.
And you know,

2210
02:02:40.581 --> 02:02:43.910
there's no real leader,
there's no real leader of any of those moments,
you know?

2211
02:02:43.940 --> 02:02:48.470
But,
but people gravitate towards them.
Yeah.
And so those things,

2212
02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:49.790
they all have that in common.

2213
02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:54.140
They all have this like this new connectivity thing in common.

2214
02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:56.330
And I think that's,
that's really the trend

2215
02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:00.720
<v 1>and were able to draw wisdom pieces of wisdom from all different disciplines,</v>

2216
02:03:00.721 --> 02:03:04.620
you know?
And that's been something cool that I've seen as I've gotten,
you know,

2217
02:03:04.830 --> 02:03:09.000
the ability to reach more different people,
experts in certain things,
you know,

2218
02:03:09.001 --> 02:03:12.600
we'll come in and add a little piece of understanding from their traditional

2219
02:03:12.601 --> 02:03:15.960
scope where,
you know,
most people wouldn't even get that.

2220
02:03:15.961 --> 02:03:19.530
Put that in part of their framework and then you get to add that piece and add

2221
02:03:19.531 --> 02:03:23.370
this piece over here.
Like,
you know,
I can get a piece from Dunkin about Buddhism,

2222
02:03:23.640 --> 02:03:24.140
you know,
and,

2223
02:03:24.140 --> 02:03:28.080
and one of these great pieces that he added recently is the Buddhist have a name

2224
02:03:28.081 --> 02:03:28.800
for that,

2225
02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:33.030
that visceral feeling you get right before you do something bad and get angry at

2226
02:03:33.031 --> 02:03:33.864
someone or,

2227
02:03:33.930 --> 02:03:37.530
or you know that emotional well the Buddhist have a name for that little feeling

2228
02:03:37.531 --> 02:03:39.820
that comes up,
you know,
I was like,
Oh yeah,

2229
02:03:39.821 --> 02:03:42.420
I've felt that little fucking thing that comes out.

2230
02:03:42.450 --> 02:03:45.840
It's like this rush of energy right before you do something,
you know,

2231
02:03:45.841 --> 02:03:47.490
you really know that you shouldn't do.

2232
02:03:47.700 --> 02:03:51.330
And then so you add that little piece of understanding that the name of that

2233
02:03:51.331 --> 02:03:54.270
thing is this.
So I can be more conscious of it and aware of it.

2234
02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:56.250
And then I have another friend,
Ted,

2235
02:03:56.251 --> 02:04:01.050
who studies the Christian texts and puts new meaning to what those things were

2236
02:04:01.051 --> 02:04:05.880
before they were manipulated for power and kind of maneuvered and like,
ah,
okay.

2237
02:04:05.881 --> 02:04:06.990
So he can add that.

2238
02:04:07.230 --> 02:04:10.050
And then so you start to piece together this understanding where of course

2239
02:04:10.051 --> 02:04:15.000
there's no leader.
It's just led by,
you know,
truth and consciousness.
And that's,

2240
02:04:15.001 --> 02:04:19.800
I think the next,
the next wave is just finding what's,
what's feels real,

2241
02:04:19.801 --> 02:04:23.520
what feels right,
what you can use to make your life better.

2242
02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:26.920
<v 0>Also,
we just know there's so much information available today.</v>

2243
02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:29.980
I think it's easier to kind of get an understanding of what's tripping you up.

2244
02:04:30.490 --> 02:04:30.791
You know,

2245
02:04:30.791 --> 02:04:34.330
it's easier to get an understanding of like there's a lot of people that behave

2246
02:04:34.331 --> 02:04:34.811
in a certain way.

2247
02:04:34.811 --> 02:04:38.400
Like that redneck song we were talking about and they've been supporting

2248
02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:41.820
<v 2>that and they were the main man.
He had to do what he had to do.
You know,</v>

2249
02:04:41.821 --> 02:04:45.000
he had to do what he had it.
Do you know what?
I'm playing this,

2250
02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:49.100
you leave a man alone,
we got to do what you going to do.
And that sort of like

2251
02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:53.850
perpetuating that over and over and over again.

2252
02:04:53.851 --> 02:04:56.970
Like if you do that over a long period of time,

2253
02:04:56.971 --> 02:05:01.500
the kid can ruin an entire area.
Like if a bunch of people think like that,
like,

2254
02:05:01.530 --> 02:05:05.160
oh,
this area is polluted with this idea,
right?
Like it's gets polluted,

2255
02:05:05.430 --> 02:05:07.200
polluted with he got do what he gotta do.

2256
02:05:07.530 --> 02:05:11.190
You know like there's areas of the country that for the longest time were

2257
02:05:11.191 --> 02:05:14.310
preluded where if you were in an interracial relationship,

2258
02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:16.800
you couldn't walk down the street.
If you walk down the street,

2259
02:05:16.830 --> 02:05:21.780
you would risk physical attack because you had a black girlfriend or you had a

2260
02:05:21.790 --> 02:05:26.640
white girlfriend and you're a black guy or whatever that was.

2261
02:05:27.330 --> 02:05:30.600
That was a reality for a long time.
In the south,

2262
02:05:30.900 --> 02:05:33.120
it's still a reality in some spots.

2263
02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:38.010
There's places you go is weird places in Texas we'd take a few left turns and

2264
02:05:38.011 --> 02:05:42.330
you drive for a few hours and all of a sudden you're in this fucking weird
place.

2265
02:05:43.130 --> 02:05:45.120
And there are some people that don't have a whole lot of contact with the

2266
02:05:45.121 --> 02:05:46.440
outside world.
That's an outlier.

2267
02:05:46.441 --> 02:05:49.680
That's like one of those weird bases that they would go to on star wars when

2268
02:05:49.681 --> 02:05:52.830
they needed fuel.
You know,
like,
Whoa,
fuck are we doing out here?

2269
02:05:52.831 --> 02:05:56.460
Like it's get out of here going,
oh you know,
that's literally where you are.

2270
02:05:56.520 --> 02:05:58.980
You're in your,
you were in a colony,

2271
02:05:59.250 --> 02:06:03.390
like some weird post that never caught on and it's in the middle of some weird

2272
02:06:03.391 --> 02:06:06.270
place east Texas and you're like,
wow,
the flunk,
I was nice.

2273
02:06:06.660 --> 02:06:08.010
Those spots are still real man.

2274
02:06:08.130 --> 02:06:11.610
They're still real and they're getting less real all the time.
And I think,

2275
02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:13.290
you know,

2276
02:06:13.290 --> 02:06:18.210
the big push is always just that human beings are constantly trying to improve.

2277
02:06:18.211 --> 02:06:22.140
I mean,
we constantly try to improve everything and we're going to try to improve

2278
02:06:22.141 --> 02:06:24.210
culture and relations and understanding.

2279
02:06:24.211 --> 02:06:27.870
And if you look at the way things are now as opposed to the way they were just

2280
02:06:27.871 --> 02:06:30.660
in the early 19 hundreds I mean the changes are pretty,

2281
02:06:30.690 --> 02:06:35.690
been pretty fucking dramatic from 1900 to 2015 is,

2282
02:06:36.990 --> 02:06:40.050
you know,
mentally,
but it's only 115 years,

2283
02:06:40.350 --> 02:06:43.500
115 years in the real world is like God damn,

2284
02:06:43.501 --> 02:06:46.590
that's a blink of an eye and he's a fucking blink of an eye.
If you track,

2285
02:06:46.620 --> 02:06:49.020
if you chart time versus change,
it's,

2286
02:06:49.110 --> 02:06:52.890
it takes this hockey stick curve way up because things are going so fast.

2287
02:06:53.130 --> 02:06:56.070
But I think one point that you've made often is,
you know,

2288
02:06:56.071 --> 02:06:58.470
these conditions that are really fucked up,

2289
02:06:58.770 --> 02:07:00.870
they have a reaction on the other side.
You know,

2290
02:07:00.871 --> 02:07:05.520
they form resistance that allows people to actually propel themselves even

2291
02:07:05.521 --> 02:07:09.120
farther in the other direction.
You know,
it's like the action has a reaction.

2292
02:07:09.121 --> 02:07:13.980
So the bias towards,
you know,
the racial bias for example,

2293
02:07:13.981 --> 02:07:18.810
can actually potentially propel people the other side to make greater leaps in

2294
02:07:18.811 --> 02:07:21.420
consciousness and understanding what we're talking about,

2295
02:07:21.421 --> 02:07:25.350
that we're all just ourselves living another life.
You know,
like these,

2296
02:07:25.530 --> 02:07:28.620
these conditions can create a positive response.

2297
02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:31.620
And I think that's kind of what we're seeing at this point.
Yeah.

2298
02:07:31.621 --> 02:07:36.070
And then the social justice warrior overreaction is really just an a reach.

2299
02:07:36.360 --> 02:07:40.210
<v 0>It's like a comedian.
It makes it Shitty joke or you know,
uh,
it's,</v>

2300
02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:42.070
I mean it's essentially the same kind of thing.

2301
02:07:42.071 --> 02:07:44.260
It's like it's just missing the mark,
you know,

2302
02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:48.550
I think there's a lot of white people specially when anything goes out wrong

2303
02:07:48.551 --> 02:07:52.540
where they like are struggling to appear down,
you know?

2304
02:07:52.541 --> 02:07:56.680
And they'll sometimes be racist against white people in order to show that they

2305
02:07:56.681 --> 02:08:00.520
love black people so much and they're not racist at all is a bunch of people

2306
02:08:00.521 --> 02:08:03.760
that I follow and I can't tell you who they are because then they'll know and

2307
02:08:03.761 --> 02:08:05.920
they'll change their behavior and it'll affect my studies.

2308
02:08:06.430 --> 02:08:10.000
But it's fascinating to see people like right.

2309
02:08:10.001 --> 02:08:13.060
Racist stuff against white people and think it's okay.

2310
02:08:13.090 --> 02:08:17.260
Like you're allowed to generalize against white people.
No fucking goofy.

2311
02:08:17.261 --> 02:08:22.120
That is like,
I know a lot of really fucking cool white people.

2312
02:08:22.300 --> 02:08:26.170
And I know that's not popular to say like for some reason you're supposed to be

2313
02:08:26.171 --> 02:08:28.540
embarrassed about being white.
And if you are,

2314
02:08:28.750 --> 02:08:31.870
you definitely embarrassed of knowing why people that you like and you have to

2315
02:08:31.871 --> 02:08:33.760
like talk about how many black people you know that you like.

2316
02:08:33.790 --> 02:08:35.590
I know a lot of black people,
I like to,

2317
02:08:35.980 --> 02:08:39.430
but I also know a lot of awesome fucking white people and I think generalizing

2318
02:08:39.431 --> 02:08:43.890
towards any fucking gender ethnicity,
but it's stupid.
I don't,

2319
02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:46.530
I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to pretend.
Yeah,
changing,

2320
02:08:46.540 --> 02:08:50.410
modifying any aspect of your behavior one way or another because of

2321
02:08:50.411 --> 02:08:55.270
identification with the color of the genetics that is just perpetuating it.

2322
02:08:55.530 --> 02:08:59.980
You know,
even further that idea of separateness that my tribe,
your tribe.

2323
02:08:59.981 --> 02:09:04.720
So overcompensating is in itself a form of racism to a certain degree.

2324
02:09:04.721 --> 02:09:08.830
You know,
just be real.
Just treat people as fucking as humans.

2325
02:09:08.831 --> 02:09:11.200
Don't worry about overcompensating.
They're compensating.

2326
02:09:11.350 --> 02:09:13.690
And that's also in terms of sexism,

2327
02:09:13.810 --> 02:09:18.160
because there's a lot of men who are sexist against men.
Yeah,

2328
02:09:18.250 --> 02:09:19.510
they really are.
They're like,

2329
02:09:19.540 --> 02:09:22.840
they'll take a woman's side like automatically to be a white knight.

2330
02:09:22.841 --> 02:09:26.470
And that's one of the things that people hate on the Internet.
They white nights.

2331
02:09:26.650 --> 02:09:29.830
People get crazy when they catch someone doing it when it's pretty obvious what

2332
02:09:29.831 --> 02:09:33.550
they're doing.
When someone is not looking at the objective facts or the dude,

2333
02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:36.130
what it,
okay,
what was really going on here?
What's the real story?

2334
02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:38.230
And they had an automatically,

2335
02:09:38.231 --> 02:09:42.130
aside with the woman's with a woman's take on things,
and when you see that,

2336
02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:44.800
especially when it gets revealed,
the one was full of shit later,

2337
02:09:44.801 --> 02:09:46.510
it's always so juicy and glorious.

2338
02:09:46.780 --> 02:09:50.350
I love following those fucking trails and watching it all play out.
It's just,

2339
02:09:50.351 --> 02:09:51.250
it's so bizarre.

2340
02:09:51.251 --> 02:09:55.780
It's so bizarre to watch that behavior that Smiggle from the fucking Lord of the

2341
02:09:55.781 --> 02:09:58.870
rings like behavior.
And that's really what it's like.

2342
02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:00.850
If there's something that they're doing,
they're like,

2343
02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:06.490
it's like you're distorting reality for your own benefit to try to appear that

2344
02:10:06.491 --> 02:10:06.790
you're hot.

2345
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:10.120
You're adhering to a higher moral standard than those around you to make

2346
02:10:10.121 --> 02:10:12.430
yourself look more desirable.
Right.
It's really that simple.

2347
02:10:12.431 --> 02:10:15.730
And it's fucking gross.
And People's,
you know,
at that point,

2348
02:10:15.731 --> 02:10:17.080
people's belief detectors,

2349
02:10:17.081 --> 02:10:20.280
that thing that we use to know when someone's coffee and cracked,

2350
02:10:20.281 --> 02:10:23.350
they start going haywire.
You know,
gears start flying.

2351
02:10:23.410 --> 02:10:27.550
I feel like you're fucking up to something here.
Yeah.
This is not just you.

2352
02:10:28.260 --> 02:10:32.800
And so the belief detectors go crazy.
Yeah.
It's the Beta thinking.

2353
02:10:33.150 --> 02:10:33.983
No,

2354
02:10:34.190 --> 02:10:38.240
<v 2>it's okay to be Beta snow slot.
It's not</v>

2355
02:10:38.460 --> 02:10:42.560
<v 0>good for you.
You don't have to be alpha either.</v>

2356
02:10:42.900 --> 02:10:45.180
<v 2>I feel like there's a state of acceptance,
you know,</v>

2357
02:10:45.181 --> 02:10:49.710
that you should probably achieve instead of either or,
you know,
just being what?

2358
02:10:49.740 --> 02:10:52.360
Being what you're capable of being.
Yeah.
That's it.
Yeah.

2359
02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:54.270
You don't have to try to be alpha.

2360
02:10:54.540 --> 02:10:58.740
There's this one quote that I've been kind of stuck on recently and it pertains

2361
02:10:58.741 --> 02:11:01.830
to,
you know,
just starting it right now at this point.

2362
02:11:01.831 --> 02:11:04.200
And it's from William Butler Yeats.
And he said,

2363
02:11:04.530 --> 02:11:06.750
do not wait to strike to the iron is hot,

2364
02:11:06.780 --> 02:11:11.780
but make the iron hot by striking and that God is not Erin's work cause an idiot

2365
02:11:12.730 --> 02:11:16.600
<v 0>throw it doesn't work that way.
You got to throw the iron in there.</v>

2366
02:11:17.050 --> 02:11:21.020
The fuck dude,
this fucking,

2367
02:11:21.030 --> 02:11:24.100
I know it's blacksmith.
Exactly.

2368
02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:30.130
<v 2>But you know,
as a poet is a pause,
just being silly.
So silly.
Boy,</v>

2369
02:11:30.340 --> 02:11:33.610
it's never hit anything.
Strike to make the iron high.

2370
02:11:33.611 --> 02:11:38.130
It doesn't work that well.
Things do get hot when you smash them going,

2371
02:11:38.150 --> 02:11:41.620
even have to fucking be really ineffective when you're striking

2372
02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:47.460
truth.
We've dismantled Butler Yates as a,
as a blacksmith,
but

2373
02:11:49.020 --> 02:11:52.750
no,
just fucking go at it by start.
Just start doing it.
You know what I mean?

2374
02:11:52.751 --> 02:11:55.960
We're talking all this philosophy about what you can and that may seem out of

2375
02:11:55.961 --> 02:11:58.570
reach to people like,
oh,
how am I going to do that?
How would I,

2376
02:11:58.810 --> 02:12:02.470
how would I do martial arts?
I've never even come close to that.
Well,

2377
02:12:02.740 --> 02:12:03.521
you just do it.

2378
02:12:03.521 --> 02:12:07.360
You don't wait for this perfect opportunity when job and money and everything

2379
02:12:07.540 --> 02:12:11.650
aligns and you read your fucking horoscope in the paper and it says you're going

2380
02:12:11.651 --> 02:12:15.040
to try new things this day and everything's just perfect.
Just do it.

2381
02:12:15.070 --> 02:12:17.210
Just go out there and do a little bit.
Do it.

2382
02:12:17.211 --> 02:12:19.390
Anthony Bordain started Jujitsu at 58

2383
02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:23.960
<v 0>58 no athletic background.</v>

2384
02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:28.100
Used to do heroin when smoked cigarettes five years ago.

2385
02:12:28.101 --> 02:12:31.340
I mean this guy started Jujitsu at 50 fucking eight years old.

2386
02:12:31.341 --> 02:12:32.540
Now he does it every day.

2387
02:12:32.990 --> 02:12:36.530
He doesn't like two hours a day as a private lesson every day and takes a class

2388
02:12:36.531 --> 02:12:38.570
every day.
Like what the fuck,
man?

2389
02:12:38.860 --> 02:12:42.140
It takes a class then he works on all the Shitty did wrong with an instructor

2390
02:12:42.141 --> 02:12:46.670
and the guy goes over positions with them.
Yeah.
Anybody.
You can do things.

2391
02:12:46.730 --> 02:12:51.350
Okay,
so as long as you,
you know,
you can figure out a way to finance it,
you know,

2392
02:12:51.351 --> 02:12:55.670
and if you're not well,
there's ever,
well,
what do I do that that's the problem.

2393
02:12:55.700 --> 02:12:59.180
You're on your own path.
Fuck face we,
I might be,
you live in another life,

2394
02:12:59.210 --> 02:13:01.730
but in your life you've got to get your own shit together.

2395
02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:04.250
I don't have time to figure out what you should do.
Okay.

2396
02:13:04.370 --> 02:13:07.220
That's what you're supposed to do.
And I don't know you dude.

2397
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:08.660
That's the other problem.
You know,

2398
02:13:08.661 --> 02:13:10.190
you can't give anybody advice because you know,

2399
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:12.680
like if you're talking to someone and they want to be a lounge singer and they

2400
02:13:12.681 --> 02:13:15.560
sounded like shit and you go,
well first of all,
lounge singing.

2401
02:13:15.561 --> 02:13:17.950
I don't know if there's a future in that.
And second of all,
dude,

2402
02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:20.120
your voices dog shit,
I don't know what to tell you.

2403
02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:22.700
Like that guy has got to figure out how to make his voice good.

2404
02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:26.770
That's a lot of work.
He's got to revive lounge singing.
He's got a fucking you,

2405
02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:29.810
you can't give everyone advice,
but what you can do

2406
02:13:30.810 --> 02:13:31.643
<v 2>is</v>

2407
02:13:32.490 --> 02:13:33.930
<v 0>have these kinds of conversations.</v>

2408
02:13:34.170 --> 02:13:37.680
Be really honest about what's worked and what hasn't worked for you,

2409
02:13:37.710 --> 02:13:41.040
and point out all the shit that you're noticing in this crazy world.

2410
02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:42.690
That's what we've been able to do.

2411
02:13:42.810 --> 02:13:46.980
That's what most folks that are online that are tuned into the world have been

2412
02:13:46.981 --> 02:13:49.770
able to do with information and news and,
and,

2413
02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:53.040
and just discussion that that's going on now.

2414
02:13:53.250 --> 02:13:57.660
And that really hasn't ever taken place like this before amongst people where

2415
02:13:57.661 --> 02:14:01.350
people were like debating issues all across the country and whether it's fucking

2416
02:14:01.370 --> 02:14:06.300
Obamacare or whether it's the fucking invasion of Persia,

2417
02:14:06.540 --> 02:14:09.840
whatever the fuck it is isn't even a country anymore.
You know what I'm saying?

2418
02:14:09.841 --> 02:14:13.470
Anything that's going on in the world,
the,
the,
the ability to discount,

2419
02:14:13.471 --> 02:14:15.090
to write blogs,
to discuss it,

2420
02:14:15.091 --> 02:14:18.150
to have people like we leaving comments on those blocks,

2421
02:14:18.330 --> 02:14:20.670
to have people writing tweets,
responding to those tweets,

2422
02:14:20.671 --> 02:14:23.550
those tweets becoming articles.
Let's debate the merits of this tweet and these,

2423
02:14:23.670 --> 02:14:27.600
this is like,
whether it's right or wrong and there's ideologically driven,

2424
02:14:27.601 --> 02:14:32.250
whether it's honest or manipulated,
it's a weird exchange.

2425
02:14:32.251 --> 02:14:32.810
There's an exchange.

2426
02:14:32.810 --> 02:14:37.810
There's an exchange of data that's going on now in this really weird state that

2427
02:14:38.311 --> 02:14:42.150
I think we're just so caught up in it that were not realizing how much it's

2428
02:14:42.151 --> 02:14:46.560
changing.
Like,
well,
you're not supposed to say retard anymore.
You know that,
yeah.

2429
02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:50.340
There's slowly but surely closing out on all the words that might potentially

2430
02:14:50.341 --> 02:14:53.660
hurt people's feelings.
You're not supposed to say,
you know all the,
the,

2431
02:14:53.670 --> 02:14:57.660
the standard ones,
right?
Like Fag.
And that's supposed to say the,
any,

2432
02:14:57.720 --> 02:14:59.490
any racial slurs,
those are off the window.

2433
02:14:59.670 --> 02:15:03.330
Those are getting money removed from our culture,

2434
02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:06.630
like over a period way quicker than it's ever happened before.

2435
02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:10.080
They're going at it the wrong way.
They're saying these things can hurt you.

2436
02:15:10.081 --> 02:15:12.900
So they're telling people that they're vulnerable.
You're vulnerable,

2437
02:15:12.901 --> 02:15:15.960
so because these things can hurt you,
so we're going to remove these things.

2438
02:15:16.170 --> 02:15:20.010
Whereas really the message should be that you're fucking invincible.

2439
02:15:20.070 --> 02:15:23.820
That word can't hurt you unless you let,
that word hurts you.
You know,

2440
02:15:23.821 --> 02:15:28.020
you have the right of your own sovereignty of how you feel about yourself.

2441
02:15:28.170 --> 02:15:33.030
That someone saying a word shouldn't make you feel any different way.
Oh,

2442
02:15:33.150 --> 02:15:35.340
that's interesting.
You feel that way.

2443
02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:38.760
I'm sorry that you're in a state that you have that much anger and prejudice

2444
02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:43.380
that you feel that way,
but it doesn't affect me.
You,
Richard Gere,
that that's,

2445
02:15:44.550 --> 02:15:45.151
that's the,

2446
02:15:45.151 --> 02:15:48.150
that's the way that you know that that's the way that we got to do it.

2447
02:15:48.190 --> 02:15:51.510
Not remove all of these potential things that can hurt you.
Just tell people,

2448
02:15:51.511 --> 02:15:52.410
hey motherfucker,

2449
02:15:52.500 --> 02:15:56.820
you're invincible as far as your emotional state if you want to be.
Also,

2450
02:15:56.821 --> 02:15:58.100
it's really you.

2451
02:15:58.101 --> 02:16:03.101
You make a person more vulnerable when you make words taboo,

2452
02:16:03.510 --> 02:16:07.530
you make those words have more power.
Whether those words are racial,

2453
02:16:07.710 --> 02:16:11.580
you know that there are about gender or sexual orientation whenever the slurs

2454
02:16:11.581 --> 02:16:15.660
are,
you make them way more powerful when you make them taboo.
You know,

2455
02:16:15.690 --> 02:16:19.200
if you call someone a fucker like that,
if that hurts your feelings,

2456
02:16:19.230 --> 02:16:22.560
we can't talk like,
Hey fucker,
come on man.
Like if you know,

2457
02:16:22.561 --> 02:16:25.380
like if if someone does something,

2458
02:16:25.860 --> 02:16:29.530
knocks a drink over on your lap like,
hey fucker,
what up man?
You're like,

2459
02:16:29.531 --> 02:16:32.590
if you can't say that to someone,
you can't be friends with that person.
Right?

2460
02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:34.510
You can't.
They do too.
God Damn sensitive.

2461
02:16:34.900 --> 02:16:38.290
But if a guy spilled a drink in your lap and he was gay and you're like,

2462
02:16:38.291 --> 02:16:42.910
you faggot,
like Whoa,
everybody just dropped their drinks at the bar.

2463
02:16:42.910 --> 02:16:44.770
What did he say?
Did you hear the noise he made?

2464
02:16:45.070 --> 02:16:49.170
What is the noise or came of his mother wasn't having Jane Jane.
Oh whoa,

2465
02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:51.940
I can't wait.
It made that noise.
What is his intent?

2466
02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:54.940
What is really going on in his head?
Does he not know that that's a taboo word?

2467
02:16:55.210 --> 02:16:56.950
I can,
everybody just shuffled out of the party.

2468
02:16:56.951 --> 02:16:59.680
Well I guess his fucking party's over and people leave.

2469
02:16:59.830 --> 02:17:03.250
Like there's certain circles where if you did something like that just even as a

2470
02:17:03.251 --> 02:17:07.240
joke do,
you would automatically get ostracized.

2471
02:17:07.241 --> 02:17:12.241
You would automatically get like so is that smart to give a word that much

2472
02:17:12.941 --> 02:17:14.320
power?
No.

2473
02:17:14.770 --> 02:17:18.160
But are they on to something that you shouldn't be the type of person that wants

2474
02:17:18.161 --> 02:17:21.070
to use that word in a negative way?
Yes,

2475
02:17:21.310 --> 02:17:24.370
but are they not on to something cause they forgot about humor.

2476
02:17:24.790 --> 02:17:27.070
And one of the beautiful things about humor as you say shit,

2477
02:17:27.071 --> 02:17:30.700
you don't really mean because it's a funny thing to do.
It's,
it's,

2478
02:17:30.940 --> 02:17:32.890
what's funny about it is that,
you know,

2479
02:17:32.891 --> 02:17:36.820
someone doesn't really mean it like calling your gay friend of faggot cause he

2480
02:17:36.821 --> 02:17:38.890
spilled his drink on you.
It's funny,

2481
02:17:38.891 --> 02:17:41.680
we would all laugh if we were hanging around with Justin Martin down.

2482
02:17:41.681 --> 02:17:44.440
He spilled a drink on my lap.
I wouldn't do,
I wouldn't say that.

2483
02:17:44.680 --> 02:17:45.640
I would never call him a faggot.

2484
02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:49.030
But if Jamie did cause Jamie's I kind of guys from Columbus,
Ohio,

2485
02:17:49.090 --> 02:17:52.690
that's how they are out there.
They just think of Faggot tourettes

2486
02:17:55.210 --> 02:17:58.570
but you know,
if,
if anybody has a problem with that,

2487
02:17:58.571 --> 02:18:03.370
like you'd either either think that Jamie's really capable of being homophobic

2488
02:18:03.800 --> 02:18:08.560
in using a slur to like he hate you so much.
It has simple act of,
of,
of,

2489
02:18:08.561 --> 02:18:10.150
of lack of coordination and,

2490
02:18:10.280 --> 02:18:14.440
and an accident they'll spelt beverage leads to his fucking unleashing of these

2491
02:18:14.441 --> 02:18:16.860
horrible phrases at you.
Come on.

2492
02:18:17.390 --> 02:18:18.460
<v 1>Well,
it's like,
you know,</v>

2493
02:18:18.500 --> 02:18:21.980
you're a parent and when you have a kid and didn't they do something like they

2494
02:18:21.981 --> 02:18:25.610
fall down and they kind of bumped their knee or something.
If,
if you go,

2495
02:18:25.820 --> 02:18:28.760
oh my God,
what did you do?
Are you okay?

2496
02:18:28.790 --> 02:18:31.220
They're going to think they're injuries way fucking worse.

2497
02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:34.490
They're going to freak out.
Like,
oh my God,
you're freaked out.
I'm,

2498
02:18:34.530 --> 02:18:37.520
I belief detector is saying that you believe something terrible is happening.

2499
02:18:37.670 --> 02:18:40.850
So something terrible is happening where it'd be like,
you're right,
get up.

2500
02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:44.180
It's all good.
You know,
dusted off.
They'll be like,
oh,
okay.

2501
02:18:44.350 --> 02:18:47.240
Then maybe they'll cry a little bit,
but they'll feel okay about it.

2502
02:18:47.241 --> 02:18:50.990
And in what we're doing in societies were saying,
oh my God,
he said Faggot.

2503
02:18:51.170 --> 02:18:51.861
Oh my God.

2504
02:18:51.861 --> 02:18:55.730
It's telling that person that we believe that this is really hurting you.

2505
02:18:55.731 --> 02:18:59.780
So it's actually causing the antithesis of what the goal is.

2506
02:18:59.930 --> 02:19:01.980
Where does she'd be saying,
say whatever the fuck you want.

2507
02:19:01.981 --> 02:19:03.340
It doesn't fucking matter.
You know,

2508
02:19:03.350 --> 02:19:06.550
you shouldn't be the kind of person that's saying it maliciously.
Yes.
You know?

2509
02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:08.780
And that's,
and that's the other part of what we've been talking about.

2510
02:19:08.781 --> 02:19:11.540
But if no matter what is said,
it doesn't matter.

2511
02:19:11.541 --> 02:19:15.830
You're a human being and your psyche has made a diamonds in the world is full of

2512
02:19:15.831 --> 02:19:17.990
fucking pillows.
Like that's it.

2513
02:19:18.180 --> 02:19:22.200
<v 0>Whoa strong word.
Um,
I sh I see their point.</v>

2514
02:19:22.230 --> 02:19:27.040
I see wanting to never be around someone who drops and bombs,
you know,
and,

2515
02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:31.340
and wanting to not be around someone who's prejudice against someone because

2516
02:19:31.341 --> 02:19:33.560
it's the consciousness that's the problem.

2517
02:19:33.561 --> 02:19:36.230
It's not the words we're looking to downstream.

2518
02:19:36.231 --> 02:19:38.720
We're trying to look at these downstream effects.

2519
02:19:38.721 --> 02:19:42.590
But really the problem there is you're with an unconscious person who fails to

2520
02:19:42.591 --> 02:19:46.600
see the platinum rule,
which is we're all the same fucking person.
Yeah.
And the,

2521
02:19:46.601 --> 02:19:51.520
the real,
the real attention should be focused on enhancing our,

2522
02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:55.190
our understanding of each other are enhancing our understanding of our,

2523
02:19:55.490 --> 02:20:00.490
our true connectivity and not of demonizing the noises that you make face.

2524
02:20:00.920 --> 02:20:04.640
Totally.
That's silly thinking.
It's like short sighted thinking.
It's like,

2525
02:20:05.020 --> 02:20:09.470
I appreciate your Har in the expression of racism,

2526
02:20:09.770 --> 02:20:14.600
but I don't,
I just think that the best way to approach it is to first of all,

2527
02:20:14.601 --> 02:20:19.100
lead by example.
Be someone who's you.
You would want to imitate,
you know,

2528
02:20:19.130 --> 02:20:21.480
be someone who you'd want an imitate is,
uh,
is a,

2529
02:20:21.490 --> 02:20:25.820
a great way to overcome a lot of things.
Uh,

2530
02:20:25.940 --> 02:20:29.750
like as far as like the way people interact with you,
everyone is interact.

2531
02:20:29.751 --> 02:20:33.350
Everyone who interacts with anybody is always influenced by someone's success or

2532
02:20:33.351 --> 02:20:34.190
failure.
I mean,

2533
02:20:34.191 --> 02:20:37.040
I never did coke cause I was around people who did coke and their lives fell

2534
02:20:37.041 --> 02:20:39.020
apart.
I was like,
well keep away from coke.

2535
02:20:39.260 --> 02:20:42.350
But I've been around people like really hard workers and really disciplined and

2536
02:20:42.351 --> 02:20:46.760
I get excited by them.
I get,
I get stimulated,
you know,
and I think we're,

2537
02:20:46.761 --> 02:20:50.270
we're entirely,
we're way more,

2538
02:20:51.170 --> 02:20:56.130
way more dependent upon the atmosphere of others and the,

2539
02:20:56.160 --> 02:21:00.590
the,
the inspiration of others than we liked to pretend we're way more,
way more.

2540
02:21:00.890 --> 02:21:05.890
And I think that one of the bad things about short sided like black and white

2541
02:21:07.581 --> 02:21:11.110
issues,
and I don't mean black and white in a literal sense.
I mean as far as um,

2542
02:21:11.570 --> 02:21:16.300
like someone never using a word,
you can never use that word.
It's like,
well the,

2543
02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:20.150
the human mind is capable of a lot of different subtleties and variations.

2544
02:21:20.151 --> 02:21:22.100
And when you're talking about language,
especially,

2545
02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:23.990
you're dealing with a lot of subtlety,

2546
02:21:24.170 --> 02:21:27.050
you're dealing with like some really funny things that go on with people.

2547
02:21:27.051 --> 02:21:29.780
And some of those funny things make personalities exciting.

2548
02:21:30.140 --> 02:21:33.740
Like Neal Brennan had is fucking hilarious joke where he was a,

2549
02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:38.030
he used to do this thing all the time with his friends in New York where he

2550
02:21:38.031 --> 02:21:42.230
would go,
uh,
what's,
uh,
what's going on with the weather today?
And they'd go,

2551
02:21:42.231 --> 02:21:44.540
Oh man,
snow.
And he'd go fucking niggers.

2552
02:21:46.880 --> 02:21:49.070
And if anybody knows Neal Brennan,

2553
02:21:49.310 --> 02:21:52.160
he's like one of the least racist human beings you'll ever meet in your life.

2554
02:21:52.190 --> 02:21:56.030
I mean,
he has a podcast.
It's all about interviewing successful black people.

2555
02:21:56.330 --> 02:21:58.220
Him and Moshe Kasher have that podcast,

2556
02:21:58.221 --> 02:22:01.880
the champs where almost all of it is like successful black artists,

2557
02:22:01.881 --> 02:22:05.120
successful black athletes.
Like he's not racist in the least.

2558
02:22:05.420 --> 02:22:09.800
He might hate white people,
you know,
but he's funny.
You know,

2559
02:22:09.801 --> 02:22:12.320
and that's what funny people do when you know they're not racist.

2560
02:22:12.321 --> 02:22:13.730
And it's hilarious.
You know,

2561
02:22:13.731 --> 02:22:17.870
you laugh cause you know him and you know me and it's like,
it's funny,
you know,

2562
02:22:17.871 --> 02:22:21.110
he said he was the fucking cocreative,
the Chappelle show.
I mean he's not racist.

2563
02:22:21.140 --> 02:22:24.500
Well he's just pointing a is pointing out and that's what a lot of humor does.

2564
02:22:24.501 --> 02:22:28.440
It points out things that were not aware of like this is how ridiculous some of

2565
02:22:28.441 --> 02:22:31.650
the scapegoat ism that we use.
Oh,
it's because,
and people have used,

2566
02:22:31.651 --> 02:22:33.720
oh it's the Jews,
it's the blacks,
it's blah,
blah,
blah.

2567
02:22:33.990 --> 02:22:37.050
It shows how ridiculous the snow is.
Completely unrelated.

2568
02:22:37.290 --> 02:22:38.910
And so that's why it's funny.
It's like,

2569
02:22:39.090 --> 02:22:42.500
it's funny because that's happened before all the time,
right.
It's,

2570
02:22:42.800 --> 02:22:47.760
it's obviously a huge exaggeration of it,
but it's,
it's hilarious.
But that's,

2571
02:22:48.060 --> 02:22:51.540
that's the problem with eliminating words.
You know,
you eliminate where you say,

2572
02:22:51.541 --> 02:22:54.600
he should never be able to say that.
I come on that moment that we just laughed.

2573
02:22:54.930 --> 02:22:57.570
I should never do.
I have to say the n bomb,
you know,

2574
02:22:57.571 --> 02:23:00.600
he said fucking in bombs like,
come on.
Really?
And he's like,
what we're doing?

2575
02:23:00.900 --> 02:23:02.790
That's silly.
That's silly.
There's a,

2576
02:23:02.791 --> 02:23:07.791
it's intent is the most critical aspect of human beings communicating with each

2577
02:23:08.041 --> 02:23:10.740
other.
What are you trying to get through?
What,
what is your intent?

2578
02:23:10.741 --> 02:23:12.780
What are you trying to say?
Like oftentimes,

2579
02:23:12.781 --> 02:23:16.920
like you'll hear people speak in political terms or in very measured terms and

2580
02:23:16.921 --> 02:23:20.800
instead of making you feel calm,
it actually makes you uneasy.
She's like,
Oh God,

2581
02:23:20.801 --> 02:23:23.190
I don't even know what the fuck this guy really feels like.

2582
02:23:23.191 --> 02:23:27.570
I'm getting this PC or this a red or a or,
um,
um,

2583
02:23:27.890 --> 02:23:28.723
uh,

2584
02:23:29.010 --> 02:23:33.680
publicists version of who this person's thoughts are.
Who the,

2585
02:23:33.681 --> 02:23:36.360
who this guys,
what this guy's thoughts really are.

2586
02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:38.370
I'm not getting the true emotion.

2587
02:23:38.790 --> 02:23:43.290
The fact that we have to judge our politicians based on these really practice

2588
02:23:43.291 --> 02:23:46.440
staged events rather than real adversity.
You know,

2589
02:23:46.441 --> 02:23:49.050
like that's where we should be able to judge our politicians.

2590
02:23:49.051 --> 02:23:51.840
What happens when they're rolling for two hours and they're getting their ass

2591
02:23:51.841 --> 02:23:53.910
kicked?
Like how do they respond after that?

2592
02:23:53.911 --> 02:23:57.090
What happens when they do a psychedelic?
What happens when they do this thing?

2593
02:23:57.090 --> 02:23:58.750
That's how we should judge the character,

2594
02:23:58.780 --> 02:24:03.480
the people who are leading and back when these politicians emerged from amongst

2595
02:24:03.481 --> 02:24:07.110
the people they emerged because people understood that like that's a bad

2596
02:24:07.111 --> 02:24:10.050
motherfucker.
He can handle it if shit goes wrong.
Um,
you know,

2597
02:24:10.060 --> 02:24:13.290
I'm going to his house and then that guy was the leader back then.

2598
02:24:13.291 --> 02:24:16.980
But now it's not.
Yeah,
now it's just who's better at those fake speeches?

2599
02:24:17.170 --> 02:24:21.630
So hilarious.
I think,
you know,
we almost hot heartburn psychedelics too much,

2600
02:24:21.840 --> 02:24:24.340
but that's because we've done them.
That's the problem.

2601
02:24:24.410 --> 02:24:27.090
People have people who haven't done on the likes guys are idiots or it's just

2602
02:24:27.091 --> 02:24:29.280
talking about doing well.
Yeah,
drugs are the solution.

2603
02:24:30.180 --> 02:24:32.280
It's a fucking goddamn shortcut.

2604
02:24:32.310 --> 02:24:34.890
I'll tell you that's exactly what God damn giant shortcut.

2605
02:24:35.490 --> 02:24:38.820
But I think that if we did have some sort of an experience,

2606
02:24:38.940 --> 02:24:43.410
what even if it's just a physical trial,
like if you had to watch them,
you know,

2607
02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:47.640
go through a mud race together,
you know,
how would they push each other away?

2608
02:24:47.820 --> 02:24:50.670
Do they concentrate on their own performance?
They try to hold people down.

2609
02:24:50.671 --> 02:24:52.950
Like look,
look,
look Al Gore's grabbing his shoe laces,

2610
02:24:53.130 --> 02:24:55.680
he's on tying the guy shoots.
You know what I mean?
Like if you saw them,

2611
02:24:55.681 --> 02:25:00.210
do you saw their character,
a merge character under adversities form of it,

2612
02:25:00.211 --> 02:25:02.450
some form of competition.
You know,

2613
02:25:02.710 --> 02:25:07.320
it would be fascinating to see how these guys performed.
You know,

2614
02:25:07.321 --> 02:25:12.321
I think when you hear like Bill Clinton who I think is a very intelligent guy,

2615
02:25:12.451 --> 02:25:13.560
says he,

2616
02:25:14.070 --> 02:25:18.000
he would do these talks where he would talk about the difference between what

2617
02:25:18.001 --> 02:25:18.840
the Democrats have done,

2618
02:25:18.841 --> 02:25:22.620
the Republicans have done and it was very like team base we did is we lowered

2619
02:25:22.621 --> 02:25:24.990
the depths.
We did this,
we did that.
We did there.

2620
02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:28.210
Haven't been able to do it since.
It's like us and them and day in us.

2621
02:25:28.211 --> 02:25:32.620
And he was like constantly talks about this team thing that's going on.

2622
02:25:32.620 --> 02:25:35.920
You realize like he's in this weird competition with these people.
You know,

2623
02:25:35.921 --> 02:25:38.680
like this is like,
he's like gloating and you know,

2624
02:25:38.681 --> 02:25:42.760
he's looking at the scoreboard.
We're number one,
we're number one.

2625
02:25:42.910 --> 02:25:46.150
I mean that's essentially what you're doing and if you want to get elected in

2626
02:25:46.151 --> 02:25:49.120
this country and under,
especially those conditions back then,

2627
02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:51.430
maybe not as much now,
but it's,
you know,

2628
02:25:51.431 --> 02:25:55.120
it's kind of morphing in some weird place now.
That's what you had to do.

2629
02:25:55.330 --> 02:25:59.970
He had to have that mindset.
So that was the game keeps not that anymore.
No,

2630
02:26:00.070 --> 02:26:04.240
the game is the Goddamn Internet.
The Internet is the portal of consciousness,

2631
02:26:04.241 --> 02:26:05.740
the portal of information.

2632
02:26:05.950 --> 02:26:09.490
It's the portal of connectivity in a way that just didn't exist before.

2633
02:26:09.910 --> 02:26:13.850
So he's fucking guys are,
they're my fellow Americans.
Like,
come on man.

2634
02:26:13.870 --> 02:26:17.770
Like that shit is not an to keep flying is going to come a port and point in

2635
02:26:17.771 --> 02:26:19.960
time,
but we want to watch you go to the jungle.

2636
02:26:20.290 --> 02:26:23.260
How do you deal with mosquitoes when you're high as fuck?
You know,

2637
02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:25.030
like what I want to see.

2638
02:26:25.031 --> 02:26:28.600
What happens if you eat some mushrooms and sit in a quiet room by yourself?

2639
02:26:28.930 --> 02:26:29.381
I want to see,

2640
02:26:29.381 --> 02:26:32.680
I want to see what goes on in your mind when you eat a pot cookie and you think

2641
02:26:32.681 --> 02:26:34.870
you're going to die and then you climb into an isolation tank.

2642
02:26:35.050 --> 02:26:37.340
I want to know what the fuck goes on in there,
man.
What?

2643
02:26:37.390 --> 02:26:40.360
What kind of thoughts about your high school did you have?
Like what did you,

2644
02:26:40.420 --> 02:26:42.460
how do you feel about yourself now?
What do you do you,

2645
02:26:42.461 --> 02:26:44.590
are you happy with the momentum that you've created?

2646
02:26:44.591 --> 02:26:46.540
Would you like to trim back some of these fucking,

2647
02:26:46.870 --> 02:26:50.920
some of these roads that you've got the travel on?
What would you like to do?

2648
02:26:50.950 --> 02:26:55.540
Like would you do know who you are right now or you are a product of the

2649
02:26:55.541 --> 02:26:59.710
momentum of your past and I'm not sure.
It's hard to tell.

2650
02:26:59.860 --> 02:27:04.180
She got to see someone struggle.
You've got to see him.
That's the key.

2651
02:27:04.330 --> 02:27:08.230
30 seconds,
30 seconds,
keep going.
Oh,

2652
02:27:09.250 --> 02:27:13.600
okay.
My feet hurt.
I got some gout,
something wrong my balls.
You know,

2653
02:27:13.601 --> 02:27:16.000
like you're going to see,
you're going to see who they really are.

2654
02:27:16.001 --> 02:27:19.660
Other than that,
that nice person in that nice suit with the perfect smile.

2655
02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:22.940
<v 1>Yeah.
And I think that's the direction that things are going,
you know,</v>

2656
02:27:22.941 --> 02:27:24.930
and I'm encouraged by that.
I think,
you know,

2657
02:27:25.050 --> 02:27:28.580
the Internet's already gotten rid of a lot of the hypocrisy because things get

2658
02:27:28.581 --> 02:27:31.700
found out.
You know,
the transparency has increased.

2659
02:27:31.701 --> 02:27:34.100
But as consciousness increases,

2660
02:27:34.101 --> 02:27:38.450
I think the demand for a conscious leader will become overwhelming.

2661
02:27:38.451 --> 02:27:43.190
And only when the demand for a conscious leader is there will one emerge and

2662
02:27:43.191 --> 02:27:47.090
actually succeed.
So,
you know,
instead of focusing on the politicians,

2663
02:27:47.091 --> 02:27:51.380
let's just focus on raising consciousness everywhere so that the demand is so

2664
02:27:51.381 --> 02:27:55.400
high that one will emerge to meet that demand.
It's also,

2665
02:27:55.401 --> 02:28:00.080
we're in a situation where as far as education goes,
as far as

2666
02:28:00.190 --> 02:28:04.810
<v 0>the,
the roads,
as far as like food,
you know,
food comes at,</v>

2667
02:28:04.820 --> 02:28:07.420
we're dealing with like these structures that are already there.

2668
02:28:07.630 --> 02:28:10.740
They're already there and people seek to improve them.
They seek to improve the,

2669
02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:14.620
the structures and the jail sentencing,
you know,

2670
02:28:14.621 --> 02:28:17.380
all the different bullshit that people hate about police brutality.

2671
02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:21.920
They see seek to improve those structures instead of like trying new one like

2672
02:28:21.921 --> 02:28:25.730
from scratch.
And that's what I think like when you see something like Waco,

2673
02:28:25.731 --> 02:28:29.750
Texas,
the Waco is obviously a bad idea.
What they did,
the Videon complex,

2674
02:28:29.751 --> 02:28:30.531
they stocked up,

2675
02:28:30.531 --> 02:28:34.850
weapons are shooting at the feds and they fucking some wild Texans running a

2676
02:28:34.851 --> 02:28:37.590
call.
It,
the guy was banging everybody's wife allegedly,
you know,

2677
02:28:37.620 --> 02:28:39.590
that's how it goes when it goes wrong,
but,

2678
02:28:40.580 --> 02:28:42.770
but the idea of creating a community,

2679
02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:45.620
organizing an engineering or community with resources,

2680
02:28:45.621 --> 02:28:50.510
including security is the dangerous thought.
Like you people go,

2681
02:28:50.511 --> 02:28:53.510
hey,
hey,
which trying to do,
you're trying to start your own army.
No,

2682
02:28:53.511 --> 02:28:56.090
we just have guns in case somebody fucks with us.
Oh,

2683
02:28:56.091 --> 02:28:58.010
that sounded like an army to me.
Well,

2684
02:28:58.070 --> 02:29:01.430
aren't we allowed to defend ourselves individually?
Individually?

2685
02:29:01.431 --> 02:29:04.820
You can have your own weapon that you could use as a home security device,

2686
02:29:05.180 --> 02:29:08.240
but what you can't do is get together with others and patrol your neighborhood

2687
02:29:08.241 --> 02:29:12.130
as a home security patrol and then a homeschool.
You have a neighborhood butcher.

2688
02:29:12.180 --> 02:29:16.010
Well,
he decided to have a citywide security team.
That sounds like an army boy.

2689
02:29:16.130 --> 02:29:18.860
Well,
we do have bulletproof tanks and laser beams,

2690
02:29:19.100 --> 02:29:22.610
but it's just to kill bad guys.
Like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
That's our job.
You Fuck,

2691
02:29:22.790 --> 02:29:25.340
you're getting in on the government's turned right and then they'll come down.

2692
02:29:25.341 --> 02:29:28.490
The feds will,
but fucking jackbooted thugs kicking your door,

2693
02:29:28.491 --> 02:29:31.340
flame thrower your kids and start from scratch.
Like,
look,

2694
02:29:31.341 --> 02:29:34.940
we told you no compounds.
Yeah,
no high fences.
No,
but no,

2695
02:29:34.941 --> 02:29:38.870
no more than 30 people with guns that live under one roof.
You just can't do it.

2696
02:29:39.260 --> 02:29:42.500
It's a fascinating idea,
but I think that you're going to see,

2697
02:29:42.530 --> 02:29:45.260
there's a town in Texas that I talked about this the other day and people

2698
02:29:45.270 --> 02:29:46.880
actually got to set up that I talked about it.

2699
02:29:47.210 --> 02:29:52.210
They fired the cops in 2012 hired a public or a private company to patrol the

2700
02:29:52.701 --> 02:29:57.460
streets.
Crime went down by 61%.
They,
the cops have no uh,

2701
02:29:57.590 --> 02:30:00.980
no financial vested interest in writing tickets.

2702
02:30:01.250 --> 02:30:04.610
Like they don't have quotas that they have to meet so they don't harass people

2703
02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:07.640
nearly as much and they actually patrol areas where there's crime and that

2704
02:30:07.641 --> 02:30:10.660
reduces crime.
Go figure.
And people are like,
hey man,

2705
02:30:10.680 --> 02:30:12.390
sounds like what you're talking about is fashion.

2706
02:30:12.391 --> 02:30:15.480
And we were talking about private police and security teams are gonna fuck them.

2707
02:30:15.650 --> 02:30:20.330
They're going to be FEMA camps everywhere you look or they're like every other

2708
02:30:20.331 --> 02:30:24.290
business and they become accountable for their actions in a way where,
you know,

2709
02:30:24.310 --> 02:30:27.740
you fire them and you hire a new team.
You know,

2710
02:30:27.741 --> 02:30:31.370
you just don't get locked into any ridiculous 30 year agreement when some police

2711
02:30:31.371 --> 02:30:36.060
department instead like have a security team.
That is,
it's,

2712
02:30:36.061 --> 02:30:40.610
it's beneficial to the community and people can maybe be a part of that security

2713
02:30:40.611 --> 02:30:43.040
team that are in the community.
That'd be crazy.
Huh?

2714
02:30:43.250 --> 02:30:46.220
Have actually people in the community patrolling the community and getting paid

2715
02:30:46.221 --> 02:30:47.240
by the community to do that.

2716
02:30:47.360 --> 02:30:50.390
A lot of unemployed people that might make good cops and you could do all this

2717
02:30:50.391 --> 02:30:51.830
shit and in a,
in a,

2718
02:30:52.010 --> 02:30:55.610
in a way where it's profitable without having all these goddamn quotas that

2719
02:30:55.611 --> 02:30:56.600
these people have to meet.

2720
02:30:56.601 --> 02:30:59.750
And these weird pressures that are on people that are in law enforcement.

2721
02:31:00.410 --> 02:31:03.530
The more we can decentralize the,
the structures,
you know,

2722
02:31:03.531 --> 02:31:05.660
go from federal rules to state rules.

2723
02:31:05.661 --> 02:31:08.320
We've already seen the benefits of that in a state like Colorado where they're

2724
02:31:08.330 --> 02:31:11.840
able to make their own rules,
you know?
That's great.
And then from there,

2725
02:31:11.841 --> 02:31:15.020
if you go back even to the way the towns can decide,
you know,

2726
02:31:15.021 --> 02:31:17.870
what the town should do and is the smaller you get,

2727
02:31:17.871 --> 02:31:20.520
the more opportunity you have for these great situations

2728
02:31:20.520 --> 02:31:23.250
<v 1>to develop.
Yeah.
And I think one of the paradigm cases,</v>

2729
02:31:23.251 --> 02:31:27.840
I read this book called the fifth sacred thing and it shows what happens when a

2730
02:31:27.841 --> 02:31:32.760
Utopian society clashes with the Dystopian society.
It's a,
it's a fiction novel,

2731
02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:37.200
but the really cool part is seeing what the Utopian structure looks like.

2732
02:31:37.201 --> 02:31:41.730
Like what a model of a totally cool place to live would be if everything from

2733
02:31:41.731 --> 02:31:45.750
the family structure to the rules to how they decide things to how they defend

2734
02:31:45.751 --> 02:31:48.900
themselves,
to how everything works,
what they celebrate,

2735
02:31:48.901 --> 02:31:50.490
what the rituals are amongst that.

2736
02:31:50.820 --> 02:31:54.480
And it's cool to be able to look at that and say,
you know,
that's possible.

2737
02:31:54.510 --> 02:31:59.510
We just have to allow people to gather and create their own situation if they

2738
02:31:59.551 --> 02:32:02.160
want to.
It doesn't always have to go where the owner,

2739
02:32:02.310 --> 02:32:06.210
it's all top down and the owner fucks all the teenage girls just because that's

2740
02:32:06.211 --> 02:32:09.170
happened time and time again.
It doesn't need it.

2741
02:32:09.250 --> 02:32:12.610
<v 0>It has to happen that I think it's likely to happen last now that it's ever</v>

2742
02:32:12.611 --> 02:32:15.730
happened before.
And I also don't think that it has to be centrally located.

2743
02:32:15.731 --> 02:32:19.850
And I think that one of the things that we're experiencing with,
um,

2744
02:32:19.900 --> 02:32:22.450
this exchange of information on the Internet is you're finding a lot of

2745
02:32:22.451 --> 02:32:24.940
likeminded people that are also trying to improve themselves.

2746
02:32:25.240 --> 02:32:27.070
They're also being super honest about who they are,

2747
02:32:27.071 --> 02:32:30.190
who they were trying to improve themselves and they get inspiration from other

2748
02:32:30.191 --> 02:32:33.820
people like you or like anybody else that's out there that is also on that same

2749
02:32:33.821 --> 02:32:37.900
path of self improvement and honesty and I think we find each other's cyber Lee,

2750
02:32:38.200 --> 02:32:40.870
I think we don't even necessarily have to live on your rye favors blind.

2751
02:32:41.160 --> 02:32:44.980
I think what he's got is pretty sweet.
That's probably the ideal way to do it,

2752
02:32:44.981 --> 02:32:47.650
but if it's not available,
it's also happening whether you like it or not.

2753
02:32:47.770 --> 02:32:51.100
It's happening throughout the world.
I experiencing the,
I experienced that at,

2754
02:32:51.250 --> 02:32:53.260
at these shows or these standup shows,

2755
02:32:53.261 --> 02:32:56.550
you meet these people that are due to lost 150 pounds.
Like whoa.
And you know,

2756
02:32:56.800 --> 02:32:58.890
changed my life.
I started doing this,
I started doing that.

2757
02:32:58.930 --> 02:33:02.490
He Kale are forking Kettlebell in my back pocket.
You know,

2758
02:33:02.491 --> 02:33:06.700
you meet these fucking people and you realize like there's a lot of folks out

2759
02:33:06.701 --> 02:33:08.830
there that are also trying to,

2760
02:33:08.960 --> 02:33:12.580
they're trying to better themselves and they're trying to like tune into that

2761
02:33:12.581 --> 02:33:16.060
vibe and they're finding other people like that online that trying to tune into

2762
02:33:16.061 --> 02:33:20.590
that,
that vibe of we're all figuring this out,
man.
No one's perfect,

2763
02:33:21.220 --> 02:33:23.260
no one's got a lock on this crazy life.
You know,

2764
02:33:23.290 --> 02:33:27.560
spend less time pointing fingers at other people and shaming them for,
you know,

2765
02:33:27.610 --> 02:33:31.480
making a fat joke and more time getting your own shit together and we'll have a

2766
02:33:31.481 --> 02:33:34.810
way better spot to hang out in.
Yeah,
we will all have a way better spot,

2767
02:33:34.811 --> 02:33:38.020
like the cost across the globe.
I think that's happening,
man.

2768
02:33:38.170 --> 02:33:41.830
People say I'm too optimistic,
but man,
I don't know.
I,
I see it,

2769
02:33:41.831 --> 02:33:45.310
I see it in action.
I see it at these shows.
I see it all the time.

2770
02:33:45.450 --> 02:33:49.020
<v 1>I agree with what's happening that I,
that I see is you have your nuclear tribe,</v>

2771
02:33:49.021 --> 02:33:49.980
those 15 people,

2772
02:33:49.981 --> 02:33:52.980
you say that you could give him $1 million and never even blinking an eye.

2773
02:33:53.100 --> 02:33:55.440
You wouldn't even get nervous about it,
you know,
and,

2774
02:33:55.441 --> 02:33:58.860
and so will you start to develop these nuclear tribes and then getting

2775
02:33:58.861 --> 02:34:02.100
gatherings together,
you know,
I think is another important thing.
Like say,

2776
02:34:02.101 --> 02:34:03.060
hey everybody,

2777
02:34:03.090 --> 02:34:07.350
let's all meet for these five days and hang out and have fun.
And,

2778
02:34:07.650 --> 02:34:10.800
and I think that'll be a cool aspect of consciously bringing into that.

2779
02:34:10.980 --> 02:34:14.250
But then you have like the mega tribe beyond the nuclear tribe and that's like

2780
02:34:14.251 --> 02:34:16.680
all the people listening to the show where you know,

2781
02:34:16.681 --> 02:34:18.430
they're sharing a certain sentiment.

2782
02:34:18.430 --> 02:34:21.820
<v 2>So it's not like your total strangers when you meet,</v>

2783
02:34:22.180 --> 02:34:25.390
there's a part of you that's already connected and like you see that at burning

2784
02:34:25.391 --> 02:34:26.200
man,
you know,

2785
02:34:26.200 --> 02:34:29.100
the mere fact that they're at burning man means that they subscribed,

2786
02:34:29.110 --> 02:34:32.530
subscribed to a certain amount of belief.
Generally.
Of course,

2787
02:34:32.531 --> 02:34:33.640
there's probably some outliers,

2788
02:34:33.641 --> 02:34:36.850
but generally you can meet someone there and know like,
all right,

2789
02:34:36.851 --> 02:34:38.650
you're going to be,
you know,
you're going to be cool with me.

2790
02:34:38.651 --> 02:34:40.930
You're not going to call me a dick.
You know,
hopefully,

2791
02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:45.830
hopefully you've got them in a bad patch of burning man is rogue community.
Yeah.

2792
02:34:46.510 --> 02:34:48.940
Dirty,
sad.
They would feel themselves,
you know,

2793
02:34:48.970 --> 02:34:52.990
they would feel weird in that because the whole collective would end up trying

2794
02:34:52.991 --> 02:34:55.420
to force him out,
like pus in the skin.

2795
02:34:55.421 --> 02:34:58.840
It would become a pimple that would eventually pop and bail the fuck out of

2796
02:34:58.841 --> 02:35:02.620
there.
You know,
the collective organism would reject it.
Yeah.

2797
02:35:02.621 --> 02:35:06.850
And I think to things like burning man and the growth of that,
which is so big,

2798
02:35:06.851 --> 02:35:10.770
it gets sold out every year.
Like in advance.
It's like,
it's letting,
there's,

2799
02:35:10.771 --> 02:35:14.380
there's a giant community of people that also would like to go to burning man,

2800
02:35:14.410 --> 02:35:16.150
but can't make it there.
You know,

2801
02:35:16.151 --> 02:35:18.760
they might have obligations or family or whatever they have to do,

2802
02:35:18.761 --> 02:35:22.600
but they want to go there but certain react like it's not Mac our God damn,

2803
02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:25.820
I don't have to fucking go around that square.
And there's no,

2804
02:35:25.910 --> 02:35:29.230
it's a nowhere place in the desert.
It's literally nothing there.

2805
02:35:29.260 --> 02:35:32.860
Well that's why it's a good spot to go cause nobody fucks with you.

2806
02:35:33.340 --> 02:35:35.660
But really it'd be way better if we did it in Hawaii.
Folks.

2807
02:35:37.190 --> 02:35:41.740
Let's just fuck it all.
Go to mally man.
Malley's way better than the desert.

2808
02:35:41.900 --> 02:35:44.860
I totally,
you know,
but they would get mad dirty hippies.
But you gotta,

2809
02:35:44.861 --> 02:35:46.750
you gotta wear dust masks when you're out there.

2810
02:35:46.810 --> 02:35:50.290
But I think the point you're making is take your 15 people and have your own

2811
02:35:50.291 --> 02:35:53.230
little burning man where you all bring stuff,
you all share stuff,

2812
02:35:53.231 --> 02:35:55.150
you don't worry about who's paying for what.

2813
02:35:55.151 --> 02:35:58.840
Everybody contributed and you're all hanging out and experience that together in

2814
02:35:58.841 --> 02:36:02.230
your own way.
You don't need to go to black rock Nevada,
right.
To do that.

2815
02:36:02.260 --> 02:36:03.820
You can go to,
you know,

2816
02:36:03.940 --> 02:36:08.470
the fucking camping somewhere out in you just put up some tents and just hang,

2817
02:36:08.471 --> 02:36:11.440
you know?
Yeah.
But what Bernie man seems to be as like a bat signal,

2818
02:36:11.500 --> 02:36:15.100
someone throws up and they all hate there.
You know,
it's the super tribe meeting.

2819
02:36:15.101 --> 02:36:17.920
It's what the aborigines did.
It Ulu at heir's rock.
You know,

2820
02:36:17.921 --> 02:36:22.300
like every once in a while you go to this one fucking spot and it's five days a

2821
02:36:22.301 --> 02:36:23.710
crazy dream time.

2822
02:36:23.710 --> 02:36:28.710
And did you reduce echoing through the whole place and it's a celebration and

2823
02:36:29.291 --> 02:36:33.130
then you go back to your smaller units.
Let your freak flag fly.

2824
02:36:34.240 --> 02:36:36.850
How about we do this?
How about we,

2825
02:36:37.210 --> 02:36:39.940
I've been thinking about this and you've been thinking about this too about us

2826
02:36:39.941 --> 02:36:44.740
getting a ranch in Texas.
If we got,
if we got a ranch in Texas.
Okay.

2827
02:36:44.741 --> 02:36:49.741
If we got like a a hunting ranch in Texas that we also had yearly psychedelic

2828
02:36:52.391 --> 02:36:54.910
rituals.
First of all,
how quick would we get co opted by?

2829
02:36:54.911 --> 02:36:57.880
The feds when they're there,
they're like,

2830
02:36:57.881 --> 02:37:01.050
there's a fucking desk just got assigned to it right now and a coffee.

2831
02:37:01.060 --> 02:37:05.230
You're on this lesson and I was fucking new stream channel.
It's fucking hippies.

2832
02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:09.350
Yeah you do that.
Like have like a,

2833
02:37:10.110 --> 02:37:14.950
a virgin aversion rather of burning man and at a ranch Texas,

2834
02:37:15.950 --> 02:37:19.550
it's,
I mean it's definitely feasible green people though.
You guys are going to,

2835
02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:22.280
sure,
sure,
sure.
And I are anonymous to crawl up the ass.

2836
02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:29.840
Get those folks.
When the Black Internet,
is that what's called the dark internet?

2837
02:37:30.020 --> 02:37:32.120
Sorry.
Well if we just picked a spot,

2838
02:37:32.121 --> 02:37:34.890
it doesn't even have to be a place that we own so there's no liability.

2839
02:37:34.900 --> 02:37:38.900
That's a good move.
We just pick a spot somewhere and we say,
hey,

2840
02:37:38.930 --> 02:37:41.660
all people who liked what we were just talking about,

2841
02:37:41.780 --> 02:37:46.780
let's meet at this general area for these four days and then you know,

2842
02:37:47.121 --> 02:37:48.200
see how it goes.

2843
02:37:48.230 --> 02:37:51.620
But we gotta be somewhere where you can be high as fuck and not be in danger.

2844
02:37:51.621 --> 02:37:54.050
That's why the deserts good cause there's nothing out there.

2845
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:56.480
You can't go wandering off in the woods and get eaten by a bear.

2846
02:37:56.660 --> 02:37:59.280
Like if we did it in Alberta,
we started losing hippies.
Yeah,

2847
02:38:00.360 --> 02:38:04.310
he started getting buried out there.
You hear something,

2848
02:38:04.500 --> 02:38:06.730
this is a drum circle.
Don't worry about their,

2849
02:38:06.780 --> 02:38:09.740
some of these things like I think one of them is called envision and it's in

2850
02:38:09.741 --> 02:38:11.780
Costa Rica and this beautiful fucking place.

2851
02:38:11.780 --> 02:38:15.110
I mean there's places around the world that we could pick that are,

2852
02:38:15.230 --> 02:38:16.070
that are cool with stuff.

2853
02:38:16.071 --> 02:38:18.800
I mean Costa Rica's cool with a law SCA with a Bogo with,

2854
02:38:19.070 --> 02:38:20.450
they're not going to fuck with you too much.

2855
02:38:20.480 --> 02:38:24.200
Traveling to other countries is fucking problematic.
Shit hits the fan.

2856
02:38:24.201 --> 02:38:27.020
You've got to get back to the good old us of a with the quickness

2857
02:38:28.850 --> 02:38:31.640
as that plane is.
Fuck all that star spangled banner Shay,

2858
02:38:31.641 --> 02:38:35.330
you'd be very happy to pledge of allegiance once that plane was leaving and you

2859
02:38:35.331 --> 02:38:37.880
hear guns go off behind your plane and Costa Rica,

2860
02:38:39.130 --> 02:38:43.160
you realize right as the insurgency takes over the new government.

2861
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:47.650
Take care.
Good luck with the Iowaska retreat.

2862
02:38:48.260 --> 02:38:51.440
I'm going to go to Miami for a weekend for sure.
Drink on the beach.

2863
02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:56.070
There's good and bad and all this stuff.
They just uh,

2864
02:38:56.450 --> 02:39:00.050
I think people are getting it together though.
I really do.
I agree.
I feel it.

2865
02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:02.710
I might be delusional,
but I think at least in the,

2866
02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:07.550
to the people that I'm in contact with,
they're getting it and they're there.

2867
02:39:07.551 --> 02:39:11.370
I feel like they're spreading and when I say getting it or you get it,

2868
02:39:11.840 --> 02:39:16.840
what I mean by that is this idea of everybody trying to improve themselves and

2869
02:39:16.881 --> 02:39:21.610
people just kind of being cool with each other and people being honest about all

2870
02:39:21.611 --> 02:39:24.590
their attributes.
The deposit gives the negatives,

2871
02:39:24.591 --> 02:39:27.460
all that stuff and working it out together.
Man.

2872
02:39:27.860 --> 02:39:30.990
And part of getting it is knowing that you know,
nothing really,
you know,

2873
02:39:31.040 --> 02:39:34.820
it's just accepting the fact that we know incrementally less nothing and

2874
02:39:34.821 --> 02:39:38.810
sometimes maybe even more nothing cause the expanse of what is possible to know

2875
02:39:38.990 --> 02:39:40.100
increases,
you know?

2876
02:39:40.101 --> 02:39:43.820
And just understanding that we're just trying to figure it out to the best

2877
02:39:43.910 --> 02:39:47.270
fucking way that we can.
You know?
That's it.
When I was young and stupid,

2878
02:39:47.330 --> 02:39:50.480
I was very insecure about things I didn't know.

2879
02:39:50.540 --> 02:39:53.660
Like I wanted to pretend I knew things so I didn't know like yeah I know that

2880
02:39:53.690 --> 02:39:56.510
you know,
like it would be like somebody would bring up something.
I'm like,

2881
02:39:56.511 --> 02:39:57.344
I know that.

2882
02:39:57.920 --> 02:40:02.210
But I felt like somehow or another there was some weakness and saying like,

2883
02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:06.620
what does that,
you know,
which is like I love to do that now.

2884
02:40:06.680 --> 02:40:07.760
Like my favorite thing to like,

2885
02:40:07.761 --> 02:40:10.790
I don't need to know first of all now I'm smart enough or at least some

2886
02:40:11.450 --> 02:40:14.010
accumulated enough information to know you can't know

2887
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:15.420
<v 0>everything.
I get stupid.</v>

2888
02:40:15.430 --> 02:40:19.290
That's why I love what I talked to someone like Brian Cox was his genius.

2889
02:40:19.620 --> 02:40:23.640
Fucking scientists do to work at the large Hadron collider and teaches fucking

2890
02:40:23.641 --> 02:40:26.520
science to the whole world.
We asked him something he doesn't know.
He goes,

2891
02:40:26.700 --> 02:40:30.660
I don't know.
I don't know about that.
Like,
oh great.
I love that.

2892
02:40:30.810 --> 02:40:32.160
That's fucking giant.

2893
02:40:32.161 --> 02:40:35.940
That's important because one of the things that plagues human beings and their

2894
02:40:35.941 --> 02:40:38.910
development is this lack of admitting to failure.

2895
02:40:39.150 --> 02:40:42.090
There's lack of admitting to not knowing something this to this.

2896
02:40:42.390 --> 02:40:46.770
It's fear of your own ignorance and denial of it to the point where you're

2897
02:40:46.771 --> 02:40:48.300
posturing in front of other people.

2898
02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:52.690
That's all eliminated by pot cookies.
You can,

2899
02:40:53.370 --> 02:40:54.780
you can get rid of all that shit.

2900
02:40:54.970 --> 02:40:57.910
<v 2>Well,
having something to defend because you're,
again,</v>

2901
02:40:57.911 --> 02:40:59.530
it's this illusion of vulnerability.

2902
02:40:59.531 --> 02:41:02.920
I need to defend these beliefs because if I don't have them,
what am I?

2903
02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:06.020
What am I without being right?
You know,
do I love myself?

2904
02:41:06.021 --> 02:41:09.190
If I'm not the smartest person in the room?
Well,
you know,

2905
02:41:09.220 --> 02:41:10.990
you got to let all that shit go.
You know,

2906
02:41:11.020 --> 02:41:13.900
and you've got to build your foundation on the rocks instead of these,

2907
02:41:14.140 --> 02:41:16.270
these sand castles.
Cause that'll never fulfill you.

2908
02:41:16.390 --> 02:41:20.230
If driving around in a certain car makes you feel good or if being right and

2909
02:41:20.231 --> 02:41:22.330
belittling people on the Internet makes you feel good,

2910
02:41:22.410 --> 02:41:26.700
it will never actually work longterm to make you feel good.
You'll,

2911
02:41:26.701 --> 02:41:30.280
it will be this hole that the more you throw in at the bigger the whole gets.

2912
02:41:30.490 --> 02:41:30.671
You know,

2913
02:41:30.671 --> 02:41:35.020
you got to find your own internal ways to feel that good and to feel that way.

2914
02:41:35.260 --> 02:41:39.640
Everything else is just a sidetrack that's taking you backwards.
Yeah.

2915
02:41:39.641 --> 02:41:42.940
And it goes back to what we're talking about where people just automatically

2916
02:41:42.941 --> 02:41:46.870
look to get in disagreements with people if they feel that they're on different

2917
02:41:46.871 --> 02:41:49.450
team.
You know,
people that are on a different idea.
I meet people,

2918
02:41:49.690 --> 02:41:50.680
the Philadelphia Eagles,

2919
02:41:50.681 --> 02:41:54.250
he used to beat the fuck out of people so bad and they're at their games.

2920
02:41:54.251 --> 02:41:57.700
Like they broke some guys a leg and a fucking stairwell cause he was a fan of

2921
02:41:57.701 --> 02:42:01.180
the other team.
Like,
like that type.

2922
02:42:01.300 --> 02:42:04.450
I mean that's not that tribal issue.
You know what you're talking about.

2923
02:42:04.451 --> 02:42:08.280
Like praying on the worst aspects of tribalism.
That's,
uh,

2924
02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:11.860
that's something that needs to be addressed in schools.
Like we need to,

2925
02:42:12.140 --> 02:42:15.790
we can explain like these are why you have these weird instincts to be in teams

2926
02:42:15.791 --> 02:42:19.090
and the form gangs because he really used to have to do that to stay alive.

2927
02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:22.460
Right.
But you know,
now we don't,
we don't have to do that shit anymore.
Nope.

2928
02:42:23.180 --> 02:42:26.110
All right.
Fuckers.
We've reached the end.

2929
02:42:26.210 --> 02:42:30.710
<v 0>This is three hours of love with Aubrey Marcus and Joe Rogan.
Uh,</v>

2930
02:42:30.740 --> 02:42:34.960
we have nothing more to tell you.
Uh,
we hope you enjoyed this.
Uh,

2931
02:42:35.330 --> 02:42:38.660

2932
02:42:38.661 --> 02:42:43.100
well to the warrior poet project.
And you have the Onnit podcast,
which are,

2933
02:42:43.300 --> 02:42:44.060
they're separate

2934
02:42:44.060 --> 02:42:44.580
<v 2>completely.
Sorry,</v>

2935
02:42:44.580 --> 02:42:48.200
I go a little deeper into the kind of spiritual psychedelic realms on my own.

2936
02:42:48.201 --> 02:42:53.000
And then
on it is about just improving human performance.

2937
02:42:53.001 --> 02:42:53.930
Human optimization

2938
02:42:54.620 --> 02:42:59.280
<v 0>you fucks on at.com.

Um,

2943
02:43:14.670 --> 02:43:17.520
And I actually worked there.
It's so funny.
People come and they're like,

2944
02:43:17.530 --> 02:43:21.520

Well,
