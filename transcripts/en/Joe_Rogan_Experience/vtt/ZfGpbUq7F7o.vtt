<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.550
<v Speaker 1>So in your experience and all these other countries and will,</v>

3
00:00:04.551 --> 00:00:04.971
<v Speaker 1>and when you,</v>

4
00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:06.170
<v Speaker 1>you see all these different,</v>

5
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.680
<v Speaker 1>regimes getting toppled,</v>

8
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.260
<v Speaker 1>you don't think there's any American influence and these things happening.</v>

9
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.150
<v Speaker 1>I think we're that good.</v>

10
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.881
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

11
00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:14.750
<v Speaker 1>You don't think the CIA?</v>

12
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.410
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

13
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.250
<v Speaker 1>I've actually,</v>

14
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm a CIA nerd.</v>

15
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of those,</v>

16
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.340
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

17
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.121
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a Gamer,</v>

18
00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:23.510
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a guy who about 25 years ago,</v>

19
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.900
<v Speaker 1>started reading up with the Kennedy assassination,</v>

20
00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:28.730
<v Speaker 1>gotten kept completely obsessed with that.</v>

21
00:00:28.731 --> 00:00:29.630
<v Speaker 1>And then it just,</v>

22
00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:29.741
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

23
00:00:29.741 --> 00:00:30.441
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of these guys,</v>

24
00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:31.750
<v Speaker 1>I read footnotes in a footnote,</v>

25
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.170
<v Speaker 1>leads me to another book to another book.</v>

26
00:00:33.171 --> 00:00:33.321
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:36.350
<v Speaker 1>I disappeared down the rat hole for 10 years reading everything.</v>

28
00:00:36.351 --> 00:00:37.184
<v Speaker 1>So I'm really,</v>

29
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.840
<v Speaker 1>did you ever invest evidence?</v>

30
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.381
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

31
00:00:39.381 --> 00:00:40.214
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

32
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.353
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

33
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.040
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

35
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.180
<v Speaker 1>my feeling is we're just,</v>

36
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.500
<v Speaker 1>if history has taught us anything,</v>

37
00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:48.230
<v Speaker 1>and if you read all of the documents from all of the controversial periods of</v>

38
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:50.120
<v Speaker 1>CIA operations,</v>

39
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.430
<v Speaker 1>we just don't seem to be very good at these things.</v>

40
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.390
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

41
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.370
<v Speaker 1>and everybody rats and writes a book about it,</v>

42
00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:56.440
<v Speaker 1>but immediately afterwards,</v>

43
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.190
<v Speaker 1>so if it went well,</v>

44
00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:01.100
<v Speaker 1>you can be sure you'd be reading about or would have been leaked to a magazine</v>

45
00:01:01.101 --> 00:01:01.491
<v Speaker 1>by now.</v>

46
00:01:01.491 --> 00:01:01.711
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

47
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

48
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.540
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

49
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's so sad.</v>

50
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we're that good.</v>

51
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

52
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.751
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

53
00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 1>I certainly don't think we have much of an appetite for controlling the universe</v>

54
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:14.090
<v Speaker 1>that the group we're doing it.</v>

55
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.061
<v Speaker 1>We seem to be,</v>

56
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:17.690
<v Speaker 1>we work very working very hard to hold the down.</v>

57
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.183
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

58
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.920
<v Speaker 1>So you think there's speculation about the CIA being involved?</v>

59
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Like they're probably just very,</v>

60
00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:30.890
<v Speaker 1>very peripherally involved and there's just shit happening no matter what their</v>

61
00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:33.430
<v Speaker 1>major CIA operations going on right now without it,</v>

62
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.281
<v Speaker 1>without doubt.</v>

63
00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:37.670
<v Speaker 1>But I think this notion that there's an office somewhere where the whole fate of</v>

64
00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:40.250
<v Speaker 1>the world is sort of decided what countries are good,</v>

65
00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:41.660
<v Speaker 1>it would fade over the next 10 years.</v>

66
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:42.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

67
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.670
<v Speaker 1>we're just not that good.</v>

68
00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:45.170
<v Speaker 1>And we're not definitely not that secure.</v>

69
00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:47.470
<v Speaker 1>There's always three people know about something.</v>

70
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.940
<v Speaker 1>It's a greatest argument about the Kennedy's,</v>

71
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.860
<v Speaker 1>the nine 11 conspiracy theory idiots.</v>

73
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

74
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.860
<v Speaker 1>the Kennedy assassination,</v>

75
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

76
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.240
<v Speaker 1>looney tunes.</v>

77
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

78
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 1>if basically in this country of three people,</v>

79
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.680
<v Speaker 1>more than three people know about a thing,</v>

80
00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:02.630
<v Speaker 1>one of them is going to be on the stand crying about it.</v>

81
00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:06.260
<v Speaker 1>The other guy is going to be writing a book about it and maybe two guys will</v>

82
00:02:06.261 --> 00:02:07.094
<v Speaker 1>keep their mouth shut.</v>

83
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.380
<v Speaker 1>I think today,</v>

84
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't think during the time of the Kennedy assassination,</v>

85
00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:14.750
<v Speaker 1>it would have been that difficult to hide things.</v>

86
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.531
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

87
00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:15.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

88
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.390
<v Speaker 1>things were less,</v>

89
00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:20.720
<v Speaker 1>much less transparent back then then were today you have it his death with</v>

90
00:02:20.721 --> 00:02:20.901
<v Speaker 1>greater,</v>

91
00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:21.331
<v Speaker 1>but history,</v>

92
00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:21.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.300
<v Speaker 1>eventually if you're willing to wait around something,</v>

94
00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:25.640
<v Speaker 1>or my VA to my view,</v>

95
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.640
<v Speaker 1>if you're willing to wait around or every boring grim detail will,</v>

96
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.720
<v Speaker 1>will eventually come out.</v>

97
00:02:29.721 --> 00:02:30.101
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

98
00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:31.280
<v Speaker 1>and if you,</v>

99
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>as in the Kennedy assessed,</v>

100
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.643
<v Speaker 1>so someone,</v>

101
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who said it,</v>

102
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:39.890
<v Speaker 1>they described the mafia theory as the halfway house for failed conspiracy</v>

103
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:40.341
<v Speaker 1>theorist.</v>

104
00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:42.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like after you've decided to CIA didn't do it.</v>

105
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.880
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

106
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

107
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

108
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.920
<v Speaker 1>well it was the mafia,</v>

109
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:46.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.460
<v Speaker 1>and there's of course there's all this great evidence to support that theory,</v>

111
00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

112
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.810
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

113
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.660
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately I'm of the Oswald got a lucky shot flaring up.</v>

114
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.440
<v Speaker 1>I read best evidence and that's one of the reasons why I first started believing</v>

115
00:02:57.441 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>that there was some sort of a conspiracy that was,</v>

116
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

117
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.521
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

118
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 1>one of the first things that I saw that made me really reconsider.</v>

119
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>But later in life,</v>

120
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>the thing that really got me was the Northwoods document.</v>

121
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.121
<v Speaker 1>If you never heard of that,</v>

122
00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:13.121
<v Speaker 1>it's something that they drafted in the 1960s or 1960 [inaudible] 61 or 62 where</v>

123
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy actually vetoed it.</v>

124
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 1>And all the joint chiefs of Staff,</v>

125
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 1>the Joint Chiefs of staff signed it.</v>

126
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>And then we're going to have fake American,</v>

127
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

128
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 1>terror attacks.</v>

129
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get a,</v>

130
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.720
<v Speaker 1>a plane and we're going to have a drone plane exploded and say a bunch of people</v>

131
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 1>died and they were going to attack Guantanamo Bay and they were going to arm</v>

132
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Cuban friendlies to attack Guantanamo Bay.</v>

133
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Cause we wanted to go to this was this,</v>

134
00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:39.450
<v Speaker 1>was this a Cuban missile crisis era?</v>

135
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.190
<v Speaker 1>There were,</v>

136
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.840
<v Speaker 1>there were so many complete,</v>

137
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.621
<v Speaker 1>this is what it,</v>

138
00:03:43.621 --> 00:03:43.891
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

139
00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:46.980
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting about Kennedy's assassination conspiracy.</v>

140
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.890
<v Speaker 1>There was so much it wacky shit going on around that time.</v>

141
00:03:52.891 --> 00:03:54.060
<v Speaker 1>So much of it embarrassing.</v>

142
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.423
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

143
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.840
<v Speaker 1>criminal scary,</v>

144
00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:58.703
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>

145
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.760
<v Speaker 1>really silly going on at that time that in fact,</v>

146
00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:05.160
<v Speaker 1>the least interesting thing about the entire,</v>

147
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:06.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.880
<v Speaker 1>big picture of the Kennedy assassination is the actual assassination itself</v>

149
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.050
<v Speaker 1>because what everybody else was up to at the time and covering up where it's</v>

150
00:04:13.051 --> 00:04:17.190
<v Speaker 1>just like right out of a movie and CIA get his meeting with Johnny Roselli and</v>

151
00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:20.070
<v Speaker 1>all these like mafia guys that blackout Castro,</v>

152
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.283
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

153
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.003
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

155
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.440
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

156
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.210
<v Speaker 1>there was just so much other embarrassing shit going on that in many ways those</v>

157
00:04:27.211 --> 00:04:30.690
<v Speaker 1>stories and where they lead or a lot more entertaining and complex and,</v>

158
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.703
<v Speaker 1>and fun.</v>

159
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.570
<v Speaker 1>Then then a story of a guy,</v>

160
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

161
00:04:34.021 --> 00:04:34.920
<v Speaker 1>shooting a president.</v>

162
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.740
<v Speaker 1>So if you believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone,</v>

163
00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:39.530
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing about when you see the,</v>

164
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.860
<v Speaker 1>like the Oliver Stone movie?</v>

165
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Does that drive you fucking crazy?</v>

166
00:04:42.211 --> 00:04:42.740
<v Speaker 1>It would've,</v>

167
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.280
<v Speaker 1>I would've liked to fill in a lot better.</v>

168
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

169
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.690
<v Speaker 1>if they just stuck with a historical record and he invented scenes and</v>

170
00:04:48.691 --> 00:04:49.351
<v Speaker 1>characters,</v>

171
00:04:49.351 --> 00:04:49.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:50.930
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was as a,</v>

173
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.983
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

174
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.100
<v Speaker 1>as a Kennedy assassination plot and character didn't exist.</v>

175
00:04:55.101 --> 00:04:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

176
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.920
<v Speaker 1>And there were just certain things we're just do mention that the garrison jury</v>

177
00:04:58.921 --> 00:05:00.840
<v Speaker 1>was out for like 30 seconds.</v>

178
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.720
<v Speaker 1>He's mentioned the Jim Garrison is a man of many interesting local,</v>

179
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.633
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

180
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.470
<v Speaker 1>a man with an interesting pass,</v>

181
00:05:10.471 --> 00:05:12.040
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way and not go away.</v>

182
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:14.490
<v Speaker 1>He did not,</v>

183
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

184
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.651
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

185
00:05:15.651 --> 00:05:16.484
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

186
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.210
<v Speaker 1>a reputation that was debatable,</v>

187
00:05:18.211 --> 00:05:19.044
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way.</v>

188
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.273
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

189
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.390
<v Speaker 1>which is never good.</v>

190
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.590
<v Speaker 1>The case was bad.</v>

191
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean he put a lot of very interesting stuff together and there was an,</v>

192
00:05:27.211 --> 00:05:29.700
<v Speaker 1>all of it was like fascinating and a lot of ways,</v>

193
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.900
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it was,</v>

194
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.880
<v Speaker 1>it was almost more interesting than the,</v>

195
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.410
<v Speaker 1>than that there wasn't,</v>

196
00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:35.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in the octopus theory.</v>

197
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.650
<v Speaker 1>I think you had a lot of really interesting,</v>

198
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:40.920
<v Speaker 1>very spooky characters who've been doing a lot of really sinister,</v>

199
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:41.251
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

200
00:05:41.251 --> 00:05:42.660
<v Speaker 1>an interesting shit for a long time.</v>

201
00:05:42.661 --> 00:05:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not they were actually involved in the Kennedy assassination is</v>

202
00:05:45.571 --> 00:05:48.570
<v Speaker 1>almost moot because there were up to some really other wacky stuff.</v>

203
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Did the magic bullet theory bother you at all?</v>

204
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.020
<v Speaker 1>I think if you talk,</v>

205
00:05:52.021 --> 00:05:56.280
<v Speaker 1>and I have talked to people who served in combat for a long time,</v>

206
00:05:56.281 --> 00:05:57.114
<v Speaker 1>the story,</v>

207
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>the buddy who gets around through the front of his helmet,</v>

208
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

209
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>it travels around subcutaneously around the skull and it enters out the back</v>

210
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 1>without hurting the guy.</v>

211
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

212
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.970
<v Speaker 1>is it everybody's got shit happens,</v>

213
00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:11.751
<v Speaker 1>shit happens.</v>

214
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>

215
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 1>I am willing to believe that magic bullet theory.</v>

216
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 1>I would be willing to believe it except for the fact that they came up with it</v>

217
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:20.780
<v Speaker 1>because the guy got hit with a ricochet under the bridge.</v>

218
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.120
<v Speaker 1>And so they had to attribute everything to three shots.</v>

219
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:23.690
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

220
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.851
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

221
00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:25.830
<v Speaker 1>that she just seems like fucking shifty lodge.</v>

222
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno what is what they're called.</v>

223
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:29.870
<v Speaker 1>But when you've eliminated all the other suspects,</v>

224
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

225
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

226
00:06:30.801 --> 00:06:32.870
<v Speaker 1>you were left with the likely truth,</v>

227
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:33.410
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

228
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:33.811
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

229
00:06:33.811 --> 00:06:34.041
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

230
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:36.980
<v Speaker 1>to my satisfaction and I've kind of eliminated the other suspects.</v>

231
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.601
<v Speaker 1>Woody Harrelson,</v>

232
00:06:37.601 --> 00:06:39.520
<v Speaker 1>his dad didn't have any part of it grass,</v>

233
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.840
<v Speaker 1>wasn't he like rumored to be one of the shooters?</v>

234
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

235
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

236
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

237
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.090
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that part of this,</v>

238
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:46.190
<v Speaker 1>of course Howard Hunt was supposed to be there.</v>

239
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

240
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 1>everybody's there.</v>

241
00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:48.914
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

242
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.230
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's is there.</v>

243
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Why is that so sexy?</v>

244
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Walking unbelievable.</v>

245
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.920
<v Speaker 1>So badly foot,</v>

246
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:55.491
<v Speaker 1>loch ness,</v>

247
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:56.001
<v Speaker 1>monster,</v>

248
00:06:56.001 --> 00:06:57.620
<v Speaker 1>Ua foes candidate,</v>

249
00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.473
<v Speaker 1>the whole deal.</v>

250
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.960
<v Speaker 1>It's way more fun to think that Lee Harvey Oswald was a Pantsuit,</v>

251
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.441
<v Speaker 1>but remember,</v>

252
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:04.710
<v Speaker 1>he was a really interesting guy.</v>

253
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:05.210
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

254
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.360
<v Speaker 1>I think the book that got it close got it most right.</v>

255
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:09.283
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

256
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 1>was a work of fiction.</v>

257
00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:11.910
<v Speaker 1>The Libra by Don Delillo lower,</v>

258
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.130
<v Speaker 1>it's really gets inside,</v>

259
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:13.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

260
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

261
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:14.681
<v Speaker 1>Oswald's head.</v>

262
00:07:14.681 --> 00:07:15.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

263
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Oswald was a guy who,</v>

264
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.593
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

265
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:18.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

266
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.170
<v Speaker 1>his favorite show is a teenager was,</v>

267
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Speaker 1>I led three lives about an undercover FBI agent.</v>

268
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.860
<v Speaker 1>He was an intelligent,</v>

269
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:27.560
<v Speaker 1>he was a spy junkie in today's world.</v>

270
00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:30.610
<v Speaker 1>He would have been a Gamer and we're not a game.</v>

271
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.550
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to be.</v>

272
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.030
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

273
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.850
<v Speaker 1>he was a guy who kind of wanted to,</v>

274
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:34.730
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>

275
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:35.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

276
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.120
<v Speaker 1>to do big things and he tried very hard.</v>

277
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:40.160
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to be super secret KGB agent.</v>

278
00:07:40.161 --> 00:07:41.480
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to be super secret,</v>

279
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

280
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:42.950
<v Speaker 1>wanting to be a marine.</v>

281
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.410
<v Speaker 1>He probably volunteered to the FBI a couple of times.</v>

282
00:07:45.411 --> 00:07:47.720
<v Speaker 1>He was just a guy who wanted to do something big.</v>

283
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

284
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.540
<v Speaker 1>so I don't have a problem buying it.</v>

285
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.860
<v Speaker 1>So you had no problem with the allegations of them fixing autopsy photos?</v>

286
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:57.890
<v Speaker 1>I have problems with all of it cause I was lost in it for 10 years.</v>

287
00:07:57.891 --> 00:08:01.520
<v Speaker 1>But the Kennedy family had very good reason to ask for,</v>

288
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:02.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

289
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.313
<v Speaker 1>the brain.</v>

290
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had Addison's disease and the implications of,</v>

291
00:08:06.081 --> 00:08:07.190
<v Speaker 1>of Addison's disease,</v>

292
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

293
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:08.671
<v Speaker 1>towards the,</v>

294
00:08:08.671 --> 00:08:10.790
<v Speaker 1>the Kennedy history were not favorable.</v>

295
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:11.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

296
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.991
<v Speaker 1>apparently,</v>

297
00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:12.441
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

298
00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 1>But apparently it has been said that he had multiple bouts of syphilis.</v>

299
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:17.570
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

300
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:17.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

301
00:08:17.811 --> 00:08:18.644
<v Speaker 1>you don't want,</v>

302
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.990
<v Speaker 1>the family didn't want to press and people,</v>

303
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.670
<v Speaker 1>they want this part of the record.</v>

304
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.890
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of sense.</v>

305
00:08:23.891 --> 00:08:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Syphilis Holla at your boy</v>

306
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:28.910
<v Speaker 1>that was worth it.</v>

307
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.790
<v Speaker 1>Amphetamines in large doses at that early.</v>

308
00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:32.780
<v Speaker 1>It is point and who knows what.</v>

309
00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:33.700
<v Speaker 1>He's really a,</v>

310
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.611
<v Speaker 1>he had a doctor,</v>

311
00:08:34.611 --> 00:08:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Max Jacobson I believe,</v>

312
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.130
<v Speaker 1>I believe was the name.</v>

313
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:40.220
<v Speaker 1>He did have a doctor who would shoot him with the vitamin.</v>

314
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I think B12 and amphetamine according to one of the B12 mixed with speed.</v>

315
00:08:45.021 --> 00:08:47.450
<v Speaker 1>That's how that do is not uncommon at certain levels.</v>

316
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:47.931
<v Speaker 1>It was very,</v>

317
00:08:47.931 --> 00:08:48.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

318
00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:51.890
<v Speaker 1>a society thing to do back then a five hour energy drink.</v>

319
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:52.783
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

320
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.170
<v Speaker 1>The 12 and a lot of people didn't even know there was,</v>

321
00:08:55.171 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 1>he was the original doctor.</v>

322
00:08:56.131 --> 00:08:58.440
<v Speaker 1>He was known as Dr Feelgood and that's where the name came from.</v>

323
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Dr I believe it was doctor Max Jacobson night.</v>

324
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:01.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

325
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Legendary.</v>

326
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

327
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Sort of doctor to the stars back in them Warhol and Kennedy's disease.</v>

328
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:08.041
<v Speaker 1>What did it happen?</v>

329
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:09.330
<v Speaker 1>It was at a motor skill thing.</v>

330
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 1>What is it that I don't but,</v>

331
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:15.060
<v Speaker 1>but apparently there were up there are in the symptoms,</v>

332
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.560
<v Speaker 1>the possible symptoms.</v>

333
00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:18.620
<v Speaker 1>I think there can be emotional,</v>

334
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.200
<v Speaker 1>an emotional content to the disease,</v>

335
00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:24.570
<v Speaker 1>so theoretically could have affected his judgment.</v>

336
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.171
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

337
00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:26.100
<v Speaker 1>it was unflattering.</v>

338
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.080
<v Speaker 1>I believe he was in a lot of,</v>

339
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:28.590
<v Speaker 1>this was the guide,</v>

340
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.140
<v Speaker 1>a lot of pain to supposedly,</v>

341
00:09:31.141 --> 00:09:31.381
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

342
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

343
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.200
<v Speaker 1>But back then you just didn't want to talk about these things and,</v>

344
00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:34.710
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

345
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:35.850
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people,</v>

346
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:36.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

347
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:41.630
<v Speaker 1>ran around in circles covering things up for their own reasons and in fact most</v>

348
00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:46.590
<v Speaker 1>of them had really terrible things to cover up that back then thing is really</v>

349
00:09:46.591 --> 00:09:47.820
<v Speaker 1>fascinating when you think about it.</v>

350
00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:49.260
<v Speaker 1>It's not that long ago I was,</v>

351
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.100
<v Speaker 1>I was alive.</v>

352
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.530
<v Speaker 1>I remember being sent home from school when Kennedy was killed.</v>

353
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy was killed it.</v>

354
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:54.863
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

355
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.061
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

356
00:09:56.061 --> 00:09:56.760
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

357
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

358
00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.520
<v Speaker 1>I go for the simple explanation much of the time.</v>

359
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:00.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the good move.</v>

360
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:01.973
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

361

364
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:08.220

<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>

368
