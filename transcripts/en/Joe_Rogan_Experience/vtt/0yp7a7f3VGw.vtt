<v Speaker 1>doom days.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That was nuts.</v>

18
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 1>It really just felt like you're watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>a video game the whole time.</v>

19
00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:44.550
<v Speaker 1>It was absolutely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

20
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:49.551
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was just very </v>

21
00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:50.230
<v Speaker 1>entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>The Rock.</v>

24
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.760
<v Speaker 1>When he had hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

25

00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:02.930
<v Speaker 1>That was a terrible movie was so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does it look like that?</v>

27
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.940
<v Speaker 1>I remember doing being super red and </v>
<v Speaker 1>orange and this is blue.</v>

28
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

29
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.420

<v Speaker 1>Why is he listed first?</v>

30
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Because nobody knew who the raclette </v>
<v Speaker 1>Karl Urban.</v>

31
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how old that movie was.</v>

32
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.090
<v Speaker 1>What else is Karl?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Urban Bennon Dude,</v>

33
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:20.430
<v Speaker 1>I just had a twitter argument with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chelsea Clinton.</v>

34
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like these people don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never respond to someone who's like way </v>

35
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.480
<v Speaker 1>less than a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.710
<v Speaker 1>she like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

37
00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called her,</v>

38
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:33.351
<v Speaker 1>I basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called her parents were criminals and </v>

39
00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:33.351
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

40
00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have listened more during,</v>

41
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.820
<v Speaker 1>during the 2003 Iraq war today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antiwar activist.</v>

42
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:43.821
<v Speaker 1>But she initially called people who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>protesting the Afghanistan war and like </v>

43
00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 1>the AUMF anti American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she was like,</v>

44
00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:51.261
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there was a story that came out </v>

45
00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 1>that said Chelsea Clinton actually with </v>
<v Speaker 1>like American flags and all these things</v>

46
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:57.390
<v Speaker 1>like went and disrupted an antiwar </v>
<v Speaker 1>protest after nine slash 11.</v>

47
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a group of Patriots and in probably</v>

48
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.940
<v Speaker 1>22 or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe,</v>

49
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.980
<v Speaker 1>maybe younger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then people were calling her out and </v>

50
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.980
<v Speaker 1>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.110
<v Speaker 1>like mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like daughter,</v>

52
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 1>because there's stories of Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton,</v>

53
00:02:11.671 --> 00:02:14.340
<v Speaker 1>like really working hard to quell the </v>
<v Speaker 1>protest,</v>

54
00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:16.770
<v Speaker 1>the Vietnam war protests on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on campus and stuff.</v>

55
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.430
<v Speaker 1>As the president of the Republican Young</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans Club.</v>

56
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.460
<v Speaker 1>She was the president really just pre or</v>
<v Speaker 1>post Kent state this.</v>

57
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good question.</v>

58
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know it was when the whole that </v>

59
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>it'd be hard to defend it after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right after people are shot.</v>

60
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Chelsea actually responded to me.</v>

61
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 1>I was floored because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your dad killed 500,000</v>

62
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:43.530
<v Speaker 1>babies in Iraq with the sanctions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mom voted for the Iraq war.</v>

63
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:45.510
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you protest them?</v>

64
00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.310
<v Speaker 1>it was like what she just said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

66
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't really.</v>

67
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that people protesting the</v>

68
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti American.</v>

69
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.480
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.080
<v Speaker 1>140 characters limiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

71
00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:03.081
<v Speaker 1>do you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just called your parents were </v>

72
00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:03.081
<v Speaker 1>criminals</v>

73
00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:04.740
<v Speaker 2>and you're actually responding whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever WTF.</v>

74
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 2>Just put the blinders on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

75
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:11.671
<v Speaker 2>And then she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about the Americans who </v>

76
00:03:11.671 --> 00:03:13.651
<v Speaker 2>denounce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know that America is an </v>

77
00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:13.651
<v Speaker 2>imperialist warmonger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

78
00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:17.910
<v Speaker 2>it is the countries in an imperialist </v>
<v Speaker 2>war mongering country that's killed </v>

79
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.020
<v Speaker 2>millions of people use cert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the democratic processes of dozens of </v>

80
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 2>countries and the world actually thinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>that America is the number one threat to</v>

81
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 2>global peace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I actually agree with the Americans.</v>

82
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 2>You denounce Chelsea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was nuts.</v>

83
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 2>So that was a highlight of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

84
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 2>that's not a good look for her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

85
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 2>she should probably stay off twitter for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few years.</v>

86
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.240
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

87
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 2>just just step back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

88
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:42.631
<v Speaker 2>you sound awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that you're trying to get in the </v>

89
00:03:42.631 --> 00:03:42.631
<v Speaker 2>public spotlight in and get that </v>
<v Speaker 2>momentum behind you.</v>

90
00:03:42.631 --> 00:03:46.921
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are already talking about her </v>

91
00:03:46.921 --> 00:03:47.450
<v Speaker 2>running in 20 slash 20 Michelle Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chelsea Clinton together.</v>

92
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 2>The two of them together that Jay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine?</v>

93
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be hilarious.</v>

94
00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.690
<v Speaker 2>What's the problem is as soon as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>engage with someone that's calling </v>

95
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 2>anyone who is absolutely responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>

96
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.370
<v Speaker 2>a war criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you engage,</v>

97
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

98
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 2>then you have to define what do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is a war criminal?</v>

99
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 2>Like what's okay for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it okay if 10,000</v>

100
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:13.070
<v Speaker 2>babies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he said,</v>

101
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean like you could kind of call any </v>
<v Speaker 2>president ever a war criminal except for</v>

102
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:22.231
<v Speaker 2>maybe Jimmy Carter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy Carter gets slippery because he </v>

103
00:04:22.231 --> 00:04:25.681
<v Speaker 2>was really a peaceful man and a really </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird situation and I think a lot of </v>

104
00:04:25.681 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 2>people capitalized on that weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including Ronald Reagan,</v>

105
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.330
<v Speaker 2>which is the reason why the hostages in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran weren't even released until after </v>

106
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.950
<v Speaker 2>Reagan took office and nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a crazy story.</v>

107
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 2>It's a crazy story because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally kept those people prisoner and</v>

108
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:44.791
<v Speaker 2>negotiated with their release based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ronald Reagan winning the election to </v>

109
00:04:44.791 --> 00:04:44.791
<v Speaker 2>make them look better.</v>

110
00:04:44.791 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 2>Those people were prisoner longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of Reagan,</v>

111
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.830
<v Speaker 2>like they could have just gotten them </v>
<v Speaker 2>out in a total,</v>

112
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 2>nonpartisan way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could've said,</v>

113
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are Americans.</v>

114
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Let's get them home like fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

115
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.090
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to move those chips around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the board.</v>

116
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 2>Let's move this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's move these pieces.</v>

117
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.060
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was almost as good a that Chelsea </v>

118
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.460
<v Speaker 2>Clinton recognition as when John Mccain </v>
<v Speaker 2>tweeted a segment that I did about him </v>

119

<v Speaker 2>on breaking the set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was like the most scathing </v>

120
00:05:12.841 --> 00:05:13.300
<v Speaker 2>segment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling him as senile crazy war criminal</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you don't.</v>

126
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.640
<v Speaker 2>You didn't have anybody telling you what</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

127
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but God can.</v>

128
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.980
<v Speaker 2>You heard about all the DNI report,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that intelligence report that basically </v>

129
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.661
<v Speaker 2>claimed that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>along with another show cost Hillary </v>

130
00:05:42.661 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Clinton the election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this intelligence report came out</v>

131
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.750
<v Speaker 2>after months and months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's waiting with baited breath </v>

132
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.750
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

133
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.110
<v Speaker 2>we're finally going to get evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia hacked the election,</v>

134
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This claim that Russia hacked the </v>

135
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.380
<v Speaker 2>election and then they come out with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this report.</v>

136
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.030
<v Speaker 2>Half of it was just bashing our tea and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it named my shows</v>

137
00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.280
<v Speaker 1>specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it said the show covered fracking,</v>

138
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.740
<v Speaker 1>occupy Wall Street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

139
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 1>government greed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton's war crimes.</v>

140
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:11.831
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they basically just insinuated that </v>

141
00:06:11.831 --> 00:06:12.590
<v Speaker 1>these things are what cost Hillary </v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton the election,</v>

142
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.810
<v Speaker 1>a show that had gone off the air two </v>
<v Speaker 1>years before.</v>

143
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.700
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people are terrified of ridiculous </v>

144
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The intelligence community,</v>

145
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:27.130
<v Speaker 1>how do they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then how could they do that if you're </v>

146
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.290
<v Speaker 1>showing off the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two years before the previous criticism?</v>

147
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said that that was when like Russia</v>

148
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:34.580
<v Speaker 1>had begun to foment like all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>descent and um,</v>

149
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 1>and trying to discredit American </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy.</v>

150
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:42.281
<v Speaker 1>Like that's when Russia really like </v>
<v Speaker 1>began the propaganda campaign was when </v>

151
00:06:42.281 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 1>my show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like the vector.</v>

152
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:48.250
<v Speaker 1>I was like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person that was put in there and </v>

153
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.940
<v Speaker 1>started to unravel democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

154
00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:53.240
<v Speaker 1>It's an enormous amount of power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't know yet.</v>

155
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.400
<v Speaker 1>But what's even crazier about it is it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

156
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:57.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course our t is pro Russian.</v>

157
00:06:57.891 --> 00:07:02.891
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking called Russia today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course they're going to cover Putin </v>

158
00:07:02.891 --> 00:07:03.290
<v Speaker 1>in a positive light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crazy thing is that the intelligence</v>

159
00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:08.291
<v Speaker 1>report essentially said that covering </v>
<v Speaker 1>real issues like covering greed and </v>

160
00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:12.550
<v Speaker 1>fracking are our Russian propaganda </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking points and that was really bad </v>

161
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.121
<v Speaker 1>because you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're calling reality propaganda like </v>

162
00:07:16.121 --> 00:07:16.121
<v Speaker 1>people are living in poverty in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

163
00:07:16.121 --> 00:07:18.320
<v Speaker 1>half the countries and poor living </v>
<v Speaker 1>paycheck to paycheck,</v>

164
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:21.590
<v Speaker 1>so you can't call like covering that </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality propaganda.</v>

165
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Russian propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking reality is slippery.</v>

166
00:07:24.441 --> 00:07:29.441
<v Speaker 1>They're working for something like Rt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they are going to view poutine in a </v>

167
00:07:29.441 --> 00:07:32.590
<v Speaker 1>positive light but they are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticize clinton like it is.</v>

168
00:07:32.591 --> 00:07:35.000
<v Speaker 1>He does get a lIttle slip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you happy you're not there anymore?</v>

169
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I am happy that I'm doing the reporting </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm doing or just like more just on</v>

170
00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:40.460
<v Speaker 1>the ground investigation.</v>

171
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Like since I last saw you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been to palestine.</v>

172
00:07:43.431 --> 00:07:48.431
<v Speaker 1>Like now I finally like really have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of these issues that I was </v>

173
00:07:48.431 --> 00:07:49.220
<v Speaker 1>covering from the studio and and feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I know them more,</v>

174
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after going and talking to the people in</v>

175
00:07:51.201 --> 00:07:52.510
<v Speaker 1>the communities and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

176
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.920
<v Speaker 1>the journalism is definitely much </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

177
00:07:54.921 --> 00:07:57.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any boss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just doing my own things.</v>

178
00:07:57.561 --> 00:07:59.120
<v Speaker 1>And you totally didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

179

180
00:08:04.121 --> 00:08:04.121
<v Speaker 1>funded media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

181
00:08:04.121 --> 00:08:08.230
<v Speaker 1>just to close to soros,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the one that makes the weed </v>

182
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.180
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you read that?</v>

183
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Controls everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I chose the same as he's making the weed</v>

184
00:08:14.581 --> 00:08:16.130
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I ask you a question?</v>

185
00:08:16.131 --> 00:08:19.010
<v Speaker 1>What one does a billionaire become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>globalist?</v>

186
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Because why is not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is rex tillerson not a globalist,</v>

187
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:27.930
<v Speaker 1>the exxon mobil ceo?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one question that this whole thing </v>

188
00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:32.681
<v Speaker 1>about like soros is this globalist and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these people are against the </v>

189
00:08:32.681 --> 00:08:35.471
<v Speaker 1>globalist yet trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's totally fine to have rex tillerson </v>

190
00:08:35.471 --> 00:08:39.011
<v Speaker 1>and all these goldman sachs bankers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the government and why are they not </v>

191
00:08:39.011 --> 00:08:40.430
<v Speaker 1>globalists capital move across the left </v>
<v Speaker 1>wing.</v>

192
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Democrats with money are globalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

193
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Trump's in power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's how it works.</v>

194
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.120
<v Speaker 1>So if trump wasn't in power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it would be rupert murdoch.</v>

195
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.400
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be the one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be the evil bandit.</v>

196
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>

197
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

198
00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 1>Soros is</v>

199
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.190
<v Speaker 3>a horrible person who's done a ton of </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit,</v>

200
00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:02.940
<v Speaker 3>but like so as rex tillerson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so are all these people,</v>

201
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>betsy devoss is his psychotic.</v>

<v Speaker 3>fundamentalists who have used trump as </v>

203
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.781
<v Speaker 3>like the trojan horse to get into power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people have been vying for power </v>

204
00:09:14.781 --> 00:09:14.970
<v Speaker 3>for the last 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These christian evangelicals,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean it's nuts.</v>

234
00:10:39.971 --> 00:10:40.340
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

235
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.760
<v Speaker 3>and when she was in the confirmation </v>
<v Speaker 3>hearing,</v>

236
00:10:42.761 --> 00:10:47.761
<v Speaker 3>of course she was the only one that </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually wasn't confirmed in mike pence </v>

237
00:10:47.761 --> 00:10:47.761
<v Speaker 3>had to do the tiebreaker because </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone was like,</v>

238
00:10:47.761 --> 00:10:49.930
<v Speaker 3>she's the most unqualified person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She cAn't spell.</v>

239
00:10:49.931 --> 00:10:52.190
<v Speaker 3>She's like a total moron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

240
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.790
<v Speaker 3>why is she even like in the running </v>
<v Speaker 3>here?</v>

241
00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.710
<v Speaker 3>And she lied multiple times in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hearing.</v>

242
00:10:56.711 --> 00:10:57.370
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

243
00:10:57.371 --> 00:11:02.371
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a clerical error when it said </v>

244
00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:02.560
<v Speaker 3>that I was vice president or on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>board of this organization,</v>

245
00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:07.561
<v Speaker 3>which is this right wing extremist hate </v>
<v Speaker 3>mongering organization that's funneled </v>

246
00:11:07.561 --> 00:11:12.121
<v Speaker 3>millions of dollars to knock down all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the the gay marriage propositions and </v>

247
00:11:12.121 --> 00:11:15.691
<v Speaker 3>all these states and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she lied and said she wasn't on the </v>

248
00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:18.661
<v Speaker 3>board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really when you look at the </v>

249
00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:20.101
<v Speaker 3>paperwork,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was on the board for like 10 years </v>

250
00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:20.101
<v Speaker 3>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

251
00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:20.260
<v Speaker 3>how could a clerical error happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that long.</v>

252
00:11:20.261 --> 00:11:22.570
<v Speaker 3>So it's sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people are sick.</v>

253
00:11:22.571 --> 00:11:27.571
<v Speaker 3>Mike pence is a disgusting person who he</v>
<v Speaker 3>fought for conversion therapy for gay </v>

254
00:11:27.571 --> 00:11:27.571
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

255
00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.710
<v Speaker 4>Those people are on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does this say?</v>

256
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.180
<v Speaker 4>Refused to agree with democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that schools are no place for guns,</v>

257
00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:39.420
<v Speaker 4>citing one school that needs one to </v>
<v Speaker 4>protect she grizzly grizzlies bears.</v>

258
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:43.450
<v Speaker 4>She really said this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

259
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:49.110
<v Speaker 4>grizzly bears are rarely predatory </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards people and especially not in </v>

260
00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:53.230
<v Speaker 4>schools that don't go to school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All.</v>

261
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:57.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's ever happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bedside and you know what you could do,</v>

262
00:11:57.581 --> 00:12:02.581
<v Speaker 4>you could just shut the door and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>the kids cannot get in the school and </v>

263
00:12:02.581 --> 00:12:03.720
<v Speaker 4>won't try.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unbelievable.</v>

264
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:08.250
<v Speaker 4>The kids guns that didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone say like the.</v>

265
00:12:08.251 --> 00:12:10.450
<v Speaker 4>The solution is sandy hook is giving the</v>
<v Speaker 4>children.</v>

266
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.020
<v Speaker 4>The teachers don't think that it would </v>
<v Speaker 4>work either.</v>

267
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:19.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean it wouldn't be the worst idea to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have some military presence in a place </v>

268
00:12:19.421 --> 00:12:21.910
<v Speaker 4>that where people you really feel that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're threatened,</v>

269
00:12:21.911 --> 00:12:24.100
<v Speaker 4>but the question is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are they threatened?</v>

270
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.790
<v Speaker 4>LIke you have a fucking mentally ill </v>
<v Speaker 4>person who has access to guns.</v>

271
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:32.530
<v Speaker 4>The real issue is keeping track of </v>
<v Speaker 4>mentally ill people I would imagine,</v>

272
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:37.620
<v Speaker 4>and also down that mentally ill thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like wasn't that a vettIng thing that I </v>

273
00:12:37.871 --> 00:12:40.020
<v Speaker 4>think the nra actually shut down that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we.</v>

274
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.240
<v Speaker 4>That mentally ill people can actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>still purchase firearms.</v>

275
00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:45.040
<v Speaker 4>Am I wrong about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>

276
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:50.340
<v Speaker 4>I think in terms of like what is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>medication they're on because finds </v>

277
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:50.340
<v Speaker 4>mental illness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

278
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:55.080
<v Speaker 4>Well the federal government was trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to deny licenses to people that have </v>

279
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.730
<v Speaker 4>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>medical marijuana prescriptions.</v>

280
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.850
<v Speaker 4>They were trying to deny them handgun </v>
<v Speaker 4>licenses.</v>

281
00:13:00.851 --> 00:13:03.430
<v Speaker 4>Who were firearms license.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hilarious.</v>

282
00:13:03.431 --> 00:13:08.431
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy because you could be on </v>
<v Speaker 4>oxycontIn and all sorts of </v>

283
00:13:08.431 --> 00:13:11.410
<v Speaker 4>disassociative drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ssri which are almost entirely connected</v>

284
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.740
<v Speaker 4>to school shootings and mass shootings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at mass shootings,</v>

285
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:20.100
<v Speaker 4>the vast majority of them either were on</v>
<v Speaker 4>psych meds or have been on psych meds,</v>

286
00:13:20.311 --> 00:13:22.930
<v Speaker 4>were off psych meds and of course then </v>
<v Speaker 4>the argument,</v>

287
00:13:22.931 --> 00:13:27.931
<v Speaker 4>the real scientific argument is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they had not necessarily the cause,</v>

288
00:13:28.931 --> 00:13:33.931
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the causation and correlation are not </v>

289
00:13:33.931 --> 00:13:33.931
<v Speaker 4>necessarily connected.</v>

290
00:13:33.931 --> 00:13:35.950
<v Speaker 4>So no one knows exactly why those people</v>
<v Speaker 4>do that.</v>

291
00:13:35.951 --> 00:13:39.340
<v Speaker 4>But if you've ever talked to someone who</v>
<v Speaker 4>was on zoloft or anything,</v>

292
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:44.910
<v Speaker 4>one of the problems is there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>disassociation with reality and the that</v>

293
00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.920
<v Speaker 4>nothing bothers you anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I had a friend who was on it and </v>

294
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:49.920
<v Speaker 4>she was telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's like,</v>

295
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.150
<v Speaker 4>I could come home and my house could be </v>
<v Speaker 4>on fire and I'd be like,</v>

296
00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:53.680
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my house is on fire.</v>

297
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:58.300
<v Speaker 4>She's like the dog burning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She wanted to write a book called.</v>

298
00:13:58.301 --> 00:14:03.301
<v Speaker 4>I lost a year of my life because she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she literally like nothing mattered.</v>

299
00:14:04.481 --> 00:14:09.481
<v Speaker 4>Everything was gray and black and white </v>
<v Speaker 4>and there was no color and it was just </v>

300
00:14:09.851 --> 00:14:11.030
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was like,</v>

301
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:16.110
<v Speaker 4>my whole life just happened in a year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I got off of them and then I </v>

302
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:16.150
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

303
00:14:16.151 --> 00:14:17.440
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm a person again.</v>

304
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.580
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck happened to me for a year?</v>

305
00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.570
<v Speaker 4>That's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the shit out of me.</v>

306
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.960
<v Speaker 4>How many people they just throw on those</v>
<v Speaker 4>goddamn things and I know that some </v>

307
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.200
<v Speaker 4>people are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they benefit from them.</v>

308
00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:30.930
<v Speaker 4>I've had friends that have benefit from </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

309
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.530
<v Speaker 4>I know there's a positive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

310
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.800
<v Speaker 4>I gotta think there's too many people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are going right to them and not </v>

311
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.650
<v Speaker 4>exercising,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not changing their diet,</v>

312
00:14:38.651 --> 00:14:43.651
<v Speaker 4>not trying to meditate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not trying to seek some sort of a </v>

313
00:14:43.651 --> 00:14:47.071
<v Speaker 4>positive avenue for their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their life and their energy and see if </v>

314
00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:50.620
<v Speaker 4>that has any effect on their depression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just scares the shit out of me.</v>

315
00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:51.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

316
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:52.460
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>

317
00:14:52.461 --> 00:14:53.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how crazy is this jeff?</v>

00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:56.390

<v Speaker 4>He wants to,</v>

<v Speaker 4>racist origins.</v>

344
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.840
<v Speaker 4>It was a rolling stone piece and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>racist origins with the drug.</v>

345
00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:03.380

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:11.060
<v Speaker 4>cocaine has medical use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe it or not,</v>

349
00:16:11.061 --> 00:16:13.040
<v Speaker 4>scheduled to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but marijuana,</v>

350
00:16:13.041 --> 00:16:14.960
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these different psychedelic drugs.</v>

351
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:16.340
<v Speaker 4>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

352
00:16:16.341 --> 00:16:19.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure bizarre medical use of </v>
<v Speaker 4>cocaine.</v>

353
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:25.350
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think heroin as well check that jamie </v>

354
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.020
<v Speaker 4>just in case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there is a medical use for cocaine.</v>

355
00:16:27.021 --> 00:16:30.770
<v Speaker 4>There's a medical use for heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>opiates,</v>

356
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:35.890
<v Speaker 4>things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think they have different </v>

357
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.021
<v Speaker 4>designations because of that because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they still refuse to admit there's a </v>

358
00:16:38.021 --> 00:16:41.471
<v Speaker 4>medical use for marijuana despite all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the millions of people using it for </v>

359
00:16:41.471 --> 00:16:44.030
<v Speaker 4>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including kids wIth epilepsy.</v>

360
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:49.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a believable in autism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a good friend who has a kid that </v>

361
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:54.281
<v Speaker 4>had severe seizures and there was </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing they could do about it until </v>

362
00:16:54.281 --> 00:16:54.281
<v Speaker 4>they started giving him.</v>

363
00:16:54.281 --> 00:16:56.240
<v Speaker 4>They would give him hash in like a piece</v>
<v Speaker 4>of melon,</v>

364
00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:57.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

365
00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:02.660
<v Speaker 4>and all the sudden gone like all </v>
<v Speaker 4>seizures and he's more communicative.</v>

366
00:17:02.661 --> 00:17:07.550
<v Speaker 4>He's more responsive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got pretty severe cognitive issues.</v>

367
00:17:07.551 --> 00:17:10.940
<v Speaker 4>Autism and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and also the seizures.</v>

368
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.140
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty severe.</v>

369
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.390
<v Speaker 4>And the only thing that helps them as </v>
<v Speaker 4>medical marijuana.</v>

370
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:15.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

371
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:16.970
<v Speaker 4>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just get high.</v>

372
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.670
<v Speaker 4>I just don't be clear folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

373
00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:20.900
<v Speaker 4>don't be confused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>

374
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:22.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pro all those things.</v>

375
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:28.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was basically a knee operation was </v>

376
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:28.250
<v Speaker 4>okay back in the day if you were making </v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

377
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:31.550
<v Speaker 4>So if there was businesses behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cocaine's stunning.</v>

378
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:37.930
<v Speaker 4>It's used as a local anesthetic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never let the dentist dude fentanyl </v>

379
00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:43.190
<v Speaker 4>that shit prints at scheduled to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my god,</v>

380
00:17:43.191 --> 00:17:48.191
<v Speaker 4>morphine scheduled to opm scheduled to </v>
<v Speaker 4>cody and scheduled to I believe a meth </v>

381
00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.670
<v Speaker 4>schedule to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

382
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.820
<v Speaker 4>And how um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

383
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:58.190
<v Speaker 3>in that article it said that the south </v>
<v Speaker 3>past all of these anti cocaine laws </v>

384
00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:59.550
<v Speaker 3>because after the race riots and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were like scared.</v>

385
00:17:59.551 --> 00:18:04.551
<v Speaker 3>And then in san francisco they pass an </v>
<v Speaker 3>opium ordinance targeting chinese </v>

386
00:18:04.551 --> 00:18:08.301
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like kind of racially bent </v>

387
00:18:08.301 --> 00:18:08.301
<v Speaker 3>back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But of course we'd was never an Industry</v>

388
00:18:08.301 --> 00:18:09.330
<v Speaker 3>behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they just,</v>

389
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:14.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have the capitalized fuck man.</v>

390
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.490
<v Speaker 3>Jeff sessions is a little little elf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is he,</v>

391
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:22.690
<v Speaker 3>it's so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's was just like this old man who's </v>

392
00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:22.690
<v Speaker 3>totally out of touch and for some reason</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just.</v>

393
00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:25.800
<v Speaker 3>What are they going to do though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because California just legalized weed.</v>

394
00:18:25.801 --> 00:18:30.801
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are they going to continue with dea </v>

395
00:18:30.801 --> 00:18:30.801
<v Speaker 3>raids and stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

396
00:18:30.801 --> 00:18:34.300
<v Speaker 4>I think no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they are doing a bunch of sneaky </v>

397
00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.761
<v Speaker 4>shit like Washington dc as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>disproportionate number of arrests on </v>

398
00:18:36.951 --> 00:18:41.951
<v Speaker 4>people of color for marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're getting arrested even though </v>

399
00:18:41.951 --> 00:18:43.880
<v Speaker 4>Washington dc has legal recreational </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana,</v>

400
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.820
<v Speaker 4>there was still arresting black people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucked up.</v>

401
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.040
<v Speaker 4>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a whole article on it.</v>

402
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:50.960
<v Speaker 4>They can't really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're arresting them,</v>

403
00:18:50.961 --> 00:18:54.010
<v Speaker 4>but they can't really do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they just arresting them there.</v>

404
00:18:54.011 --> 00:18:59.011
<v Speaker 4>They just go through the system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get processed and I mean I don't </v>

405
00:18:59.011 --> 00:19:02.740
<v Speaker 4>think they're getting jay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're obviously getting jailed </v>

406
00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:02.740
<v Speaker 4>initially or at least brought in for to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be booked,</v>

407
00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:08.140
<v Speaker 4>but it's just the idea that this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>still going on despite all the evidence.</v>

408
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:11.180
<v Speaker 4>It just shows you what a corrupt system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>

409
00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:16.160
<v Speaker 4>And americans just totally want legal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>recreational marijuana.</v>

410
00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.260
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the only thing holding that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sessions got back.</v>

411
00:19:18.261 --> 00:19:23.240
<v Speaker 4>Is it 57 percent of americans support,</v>
<v Speaker 4>legalized recreational marijuana,</v>

412
00:19:23.241 --> 00:19:26.030
<v Speaker 4>which is just unprecedented this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's never been that high before.</v>

413
00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.280
<v Speaker 4>And that's people willing to answer </v>
<v Speaker 4>polls.</v>

414
00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:33.580
<v Speaker 4>I would venture that if you really got </v>
<v Speaker 4>down and dirty with a bunch of people </v>

415
00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:33.830
<v Speaker 4>like you and I that aren't answering </v>
<v Speaker 4>polls,</v>

416
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.250
<v Speaker 4>I bet you're going way over 70 percent </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it just doesn't make any sense.</v>

417
00:19:37.251 --> 00:19:39.170
<v Speaker 4>And when dc passed the law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

418
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.630
<v Speaker 4>it was overwhelming and that's where all</v>
<v Speaker 4>the legislators are.</v>

419
00:19:41.631 --> 00:19:46.631
<v Speaker 4>Like obviously they want it to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what the hell is holding his back </v>

420
00:19:46.631 --> 00:19:46.631
<v Speaker 4>here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys are in dc,</v>

421
00:19:46.631 --> 00:19:49.820
<v Speaker 4>you all smoke weed is a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>massive amount of money that still being</v>

422
00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:54.821
<v Speaker 4>spent by really odd groups like prison </v>
<v Speaker 4>guard lobbies,</v>

423
00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.770
<v Speaker 4>which is really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we use unions.</v>

424
00:19:57.771 --> 00:20:02.771
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want more people in jail so they </v>

425
00:20:02.771 --> 00:20:04.310
<v Speaker 4>can make more money and get more hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so crazy.</v>

426
00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:07.700
<v Speaker 4>It is like vampires shit because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>think about what you're doing.</v>

427
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:11.600
<v Speaker 4>You're literally trying to suck money </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of people's lives.</v>

428
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:13.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't look at it that way.</v>

429
00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:18.790
<v Speaker 4>They're looking at it like we're going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to keep jobs for these american prison </v>

430
00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:21.701
<v Speaker 4>workers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to keep american jobs just </v>

431
00:20:21.701 --> 00:20:21.701
<v Speaker 4>trying to get create jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe.</v>

432
00:20:21.701 --> 00:20:21.701
<v Speaker 4>Now we're creating jobs.</v>

433
00:20:21.701 --> 00:20:24.310
<v Speaker 3>don't you see the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The good thing behind this record,</v>

434
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:29.590
<v Speaker 3>it's spooky as a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I know that like the outright is </v>

435
00:20:29.681 --> 00:20:33.760
<v Speaker 3>kind of blended in with like this anti </v>
<v Speaker 3>pc culture that I think comedians relate</v>

436
00:20:33.761 --> 00:20:38.761
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like do you just wake up and things </v>

437
00:20:38.761 --> 00:20:38.761
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy shit,</v>

438
00:20:38.761 --> 00:20:38.761
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the president ever?</v>

439
00:20:38.761 --> 00:20:40.790
<v Speaker 3>Are you laying stone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it?</v>

440
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:45.530
<v Speaker 4>Before my last special,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my last special aired in november,</v>

441
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:48.820
<v Speaker 4>which is right before the election,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

442
00:20:48.821 --> 00:20:50.740
<v Speaker 4>do you know how fucking close we are?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And people were laughing,</v>

443
00:20:50.741 --> 00:20:51.640
<v Speaker 4>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not going to win.</v>

444
00:20:51.641 --> 00:20:52.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

445
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.180
<v Speaker 4>he's fucking right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could happen.</v>

446
00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:58.090
<v Speaker 4>And then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he became president and I just like,</v>

447
00:20:58.091 --> 00:21:00.970
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so surreal,</v>

448
00:21:00.971 --> 00:21:05.971
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it highlights to me how preposterous </v>

449
00:21:05.971 --> 00:21:07.540
<v Speaker 4>this system of having one person run </v>
<v Speaker 4>this whole thing is.</v>

450
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.240
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't an any.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know there's a cabinet.</v>

451
00:21:10.241 --> 00:21:13.060
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand the legislation legislative</v>

452
00:21:13.061 --> 00:21:18.061
<v Speaker 4>process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand there's a senate and the </v>

453
00:21:18.061 --> 00:21:18.061
<v Speaker 4>congress,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>

454
00:21:18.061 --> 00:21:21.500
<v Speaker 4>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but still he's got a lot of fucking </v>

455
00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:21.500
<v Speaker 4>power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's did.</v>

456
00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.700
<v Speaker 4>What was the thing that he shut down?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He shutting down the epa database.</v>

457
00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

458
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:27.910
<v Speaker 1>When they had to like start rogue </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter accounts,</v>

459
00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:32.911
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to put out the climate data in </v>

460
00:21:32.911 --> 00:21:32.911
<v Speaker 1>case trump deletes it.</v>

462
00:21:32.911 --> 00:21:37.501
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does the executive branch have this </v>

463
00:21:37.501 --> 00:21:37.501
<v Speaker 1>much power?</v>

464
00:21:37.501 --> 00:21:40.050
<v Speaker 4>I think he's just doing shit and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to stop it somehow or another </v>

465
00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.320
<v Speaker 4>and no one wants to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he's.</v>

466
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.650
<v Speaker 4>He's just doing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether or not he can or can't do shit.</v>

467
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's just doing it and then you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to figure out a way to reverse it,</v>

468
00:21:48.011 --> 00:21:53.011
<v Speaker 4>but it's already getting done like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>epa standards that some spooky shit </v>

469
00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:55.480
<v Speaker 4>because that's the literally the ground </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we grow our food in.</v>

470
00:21:55.481 --> 00:22:00.481
<v Speaker 4>The water that we drink,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the air that we breathe is one of the </v>

471
00:22:00.481 --> 00:22:00.640
<v Speaker 4>most important things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it becomes this.</v>

472
00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.140
<v Speaker 4>It becomes this ideological issue </v>
<v Speaker 4>between right and left were right,</v>

473
00:22:05.141 --> 00:22:10.141
<v Speaker 4>wants work and jobs and industry and </v>
<v Speaker 4>left once water to be clean and like </v>

474
00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:14.220
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking insane that that became one</v>
<v Speaker 4>of those issues that it's.</v>

475
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.720
<v Speaker 4>It's an ideological thing that if you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the right,</v>

476
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:20.230
<v Speaker 4>you're supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if not deny climate change.</v>

477
00:22:20.231 --> 00:22:22.600
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to ignore it at the very</v>
<v Speaker 4>least,</v>

478
00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:27.790
<v Speaker 4>and if you're on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're supposed to be a tree hugger and </v>

479
00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:28.090
<v Speaker 4>a hippie and you're supposed to be all </v>
<v Speaker 4>about clean water.</v>

480
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:33.360
<v Speaker 4>The fact that these people can make </v>
<v Speaker 4>these distinctions like that and then </v>

481
00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.870
<v Speaker 4>figure out a way to make money despite </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're poisoning the mother earth.</v>

482
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.250
<v Speaker 4>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>

483
00:22:39.251 --> 00:22:40.850
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

484
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:42.370
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's gotta be another way </v>
<v Speaker 4>to make money,</v>

485
00:22:42.371 --> 00:22:43.060
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

486
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:48.300
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's got to be this coal mining </v>

487
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:48.300
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to read</v>

488
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.730
<v Speaker 1>night coal mining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump kept calling it clean coal like,</v>

489
00:22:49.731 --> 00:22:51.770
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we living in the fifties,</v>

490
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:53.610
<v Speaker 1>eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat it,</v>

491
00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.820
<v Speaker 1>eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink the water in flint,</v>

492
00:22:55.821 --> 00:22:56.320
<v Speaker 1>and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

493
00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:57.380
<v Speaker 1>water is clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all good.</v>

494
00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.350
<v Speaker 1>FuckIng evacuate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Immediately</v>

495
00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:05.900
<v Speaker 4>pa as a different store,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the agency says it has no plans to shut </v>

496
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.201
<v Speaker 4>down the website,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much less bury the data it makes </v>

497
00:23:09.201 --> 00:23:09.201
<v Speaker 4>accessible and never did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

498
00:23:09.201 --> 00:23:10.530
<v Speaker 4>so they are fighting back.</v>

499
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.230
<v Speaker 1>No way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the epa is not.</v>

500
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.540
<v Speaker 1>So the data is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So were.</v>

501
00:23:16.541 --> 00:23:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Who were those robots?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can fake news?</v>

502
00:23:18.371 --> 00:23:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Who were those rogue accounts that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

503
00:23:20.381 --> 00:23:21.180
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna</v>

504
00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.030
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

505
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:25.700
<v Speaker 5>the story where you came from like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>context,</v>

506
00:23:25.701 --> 00:23:27.890
<v Speaker 5>or excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>data taken out of context from the trump</v>

507
00:23:27.891 --> 00:23:31.160
<v Speaker 5>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They are gonna maybe take out 31 percent</v>

508
00:23:31.161 --> 00:23:32.210
<v Speaker 5>of the epa budget,</v>

509
00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:37.240
<v Speaker 1>but they're just going to get to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pentagon.</v>

510
00:23:38.601 --> 00:23:39.620
<v Speaker 1>You heard about that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

511
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.450
<v Speaker 4>Twenty five percent in the cut in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>workforce.</v>

512
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:47.480
<v Speaker 4>So they're going to get rid of 25 </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent of the epa far as the workforce </v>

513
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.220
<v Speaker 4>and in 31 percent of the money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

514
00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:51.860
<v Speaker 4>So that means the people that remain are</v>
<v Speaker 4>gonna leave.</v>

515
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:57.100
<v Speaker 4>because look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you cut out 31 percent and then 25 </v>

516
00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:57.170
<v Speaker 4>percent of the workforce,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that means you're cutting out more money</v>

517
00:23:57.171 --> 00:24:01.330
<v Speaker 4>than you are cutting out people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I guarantee you that's going to,</v>

518
00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.770
<v Speaker 4>that's goIng to equate to people </v>
<v Speaker 4>leaving.</v>

519
00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the whole like climate accords or </v>

520
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:09.480
<v Speaker 1>whatever that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

521
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.641
<v Speaker 1>the us is not only the biggest polluter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pentagon pollutes more than any </v>

522
00:24:12.641 --> 00:24:13.120
<v Speaker 1>other entity in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then yeah,</v>

523
00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:16.030
<v Speaker 1>the pentagon itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the military.</v>

524
00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the billions of plastic debris in </v>

525
00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:21.340
<v Speaker 1>the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the fucking bombs exploding.</v>

526
00:24:21.341 --> 00:24:22.840
<v Speaker 1>God knows what we're doing around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

527
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

528
00:24:23.981 --> 00:24:28.981
<v Speaker 1>I mean when the pentagon is the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>polluter and then you pull out of the </v>

529
00:24:28.981 --> 00:24:30.190
<v Speaker 1>paris accords or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like trump was just like,</v>

530
00:24:30.191 --> 00:24:35.191
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we're going to pull out of that </v>

531
00:24:35.191 --> 00:24:35.191
<v Speaker 1>climate change agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

532
00:24:35.191 --> 00:24:35.191
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's going to hold it together?</v>

533
00:24:35.191 --> 00:24:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Then it already wasn't enough weight and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

534
00:24:37.031 --> 00:24:42.031
<v Speaker 1>it's like these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he just puts exxon mobil in </v>

535
00:24:42.031 --> 00:24:42.031
<v Speaker 1>charge of the state department.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

536
00:24:42.031 --> 00:24:45.331
<v Speaker 1>it's so much crazier than halliburton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so much crazier than condoleeza </v>

537
00:24:45.331 --> 00:24:46.990
<v Speaker 1>rice has ties to exxon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual ceo.</v>

538
00:24:46.991 --> 00:24:48.970
<v Speaker 1>I just can't even wrap my mind around </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

539
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:50.900
<v Speaker 4>It is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

540
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.120
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing that we didn't learn from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the dick cheney</v>

541
00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:57.360
<v Speaker 1>exxon.</v>

542
00:24:57.361 --> 00:24:58.890
<v Speaker 1>run the country like a business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

543
00:24:58.891 --> 00:25:03.891
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to put actual ceos in </v>

544
00:25:03.891 --> 00:25:03.891
<v Speaker 1>charge of all these departments and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be good.</v>

<v Speaker 1>is thAt fucking good?</v>

546
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:10.400
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be good if you streamline the </v>

547
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.491
<v Speaker 4>business and tried to make it more </v>
<v Speaker 4>practical and cut out waste and </v>

548
00:25:13.491 --> 00:25:16.170
<v Speaker 4>bureaucracy and red tape and made it </v>
<v Speaker 4>better for everybody,</v>

549
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:18.270
<v Speaker 4>but as soon as you start saying things </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

550
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:23.580
<v Speaker 4>we're going to shut down all those </v>
<v Speaker 4>satellites that track global warming,</v>

551
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.720
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like instead of Like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

579
00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.100
<v Speaker 1>instead of some surgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

580
00:26:27.101 --> 00:26:27.370
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

581
00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.010
<v Speaker 4>didn't you mAke him in charge of like </v>
<v Speaker 4>neurosurgery?</v>

582
00:26:30.011 --> 00:26:35.011
<v Speaker 4>He's like a fucking neurosurgeons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shouldn't you be in charge of educating </v>

583
00:26:35.861 --> 00:26:38.070
<v Speaker 4>the board on are the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

584
00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.770
<v Speaker 4>the government on the science behind </v>
<v Speaker 4>neurosurgery and like let's,</v>

585
00:26:41.771 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 4>let's stay on board with all this</v>

586
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.720
<v Speaker 2>research and science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Utilize your expertise.</v>

587
00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's like a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

588
00:26:48.901 --> 00:26:50.940
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing is like a reality show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looking back on it,</v>

589
00:26:50.941 --> 00:26:52.210
<v Speaker 2>I do think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

590
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:55.880
<v Speaker 2>I believed all the polls and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why because there are,</v>

591
00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:01.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's coming from like this ivory tower </v>

592
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:01.120
<v Speaker 2>elite who's totally out of touch with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the country,</v>

593
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:05.241
<v Speaker 2>but I really did believe that trump had </v>
<v Speaker 2>no chance because I thought hillary </v>

594
00:27:05.241 --> 00:27:05.340
<v Speaker 2>would steal the vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if it came down to,</v>

595
00:27:05.341 --> 00:27:06.000
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>

596
00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.560
<v Speaker 2>they have measures in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're really like,</v>

597
00:27:07.561 --> 00:27:08.400
<v Speaker 2>locked this dowN.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

598
00:27:08.401 --> 00:27:13.401
<v Speaker 2>there's still a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when he won I just couldn't believe </v>

599
00:27:13.401 --> 00:27:13.401
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But looking back on it,</v>

600
00:27:13.401 --> 00:27:13.890
<v Speaker 2>it makes so much sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

601
00:27:13.891 --> 00:27:18.891
<v Speaker 2>how could he not have one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hillary was the most corrupt clay </v>

602
00:27:18.891 --> 00:27:21.831
<v Speaker 2>candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years of just a legacy of horrible </v>

603
00:27:21.831 --> 00:27:22.170
<v Speaker 2>death and destruction or husband and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ruined the economy.</v>

604
00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.210
<v Speaker 2>Horrible arrogance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

605
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:28.320
<v Speaker 2>Bill clinton ruin the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deregulation up the ass.</v>

606
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:34.160
<v Speaker 2>He was an officer yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happens right before it </v>

607
00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:34.160
<v Speaker 2>craShes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

608
00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.720
<v Speaker 2>The buildup of all the banking </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulations,</v>

609
00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:40.150
<v Speaker 2>the telecom communications act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prison at a street.</v>

610
00:27:40.151 --> 00:27:43.250
<v Speaker 2>It was clinton years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good time.</v>

611
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:48.430
<v Speaker 2>So for vince foster trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump is um,</v>

612
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.070
<v Speaker 2>and all the women that I raped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How crazy was that when trump brought up</v>

613
00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:57.180
<v Speaker 2>sexual assault victims?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hardcore.</v>

614
00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.560
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

615
00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:01.680
<v Speaker 2>it was right before the debate is why </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't playing games?</v>

616
00:28:01.681 --> 00:28:03.540
<v Speaker 2>He was not playing games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had told him.</v>

617
00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.000
<v Speaker 2>He asked you this because you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalist.</v>

618
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:11.240
<v Speaker 2>What did you think about the wiki leaks </v>
<v Speaker 2>claim that the young man who was </v>

619
00:28:11.791 --> 00:28:16.190
<v Speaker 2>murdered in Washington dc was the guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>who gave them the info center,</v>

620
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:18.490
<v Speaker 2>whatever his name was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

621
00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:24.330
<v Speaker 2>people don't know the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a young guy who was working for </v>

622
00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:24.330
<v Speaker 2>the dnc.</v>

623
00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:26.910
<v Speaker 2>He was murdered at like 3:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning or something crazy.</v>

624
00:28:26.911 --> 00:28:30.840
<v Speaker 2>They shot him in the back anD they </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't take anything from him.</v>

625
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.030
<v Speaker 2>They didn't take his wallet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his phone,</v>

626
00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:34.500
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his cash.</v>

627
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.830
<v Speaker 2>They left everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they called it a robbery,</v>

628
00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.590
<v Speaker 2>a robbery tip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was essentially assassinated.</v>

629
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.460
<v Speaker 2>And the investigation is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>nonexistent.</v>

630
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:49.490
<v Speaker 2>You don't hear a god damn word about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if anybody's like </v>

631
00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:49.490
<v Speaker 2>currently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

632
00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:50.310
<v Speaker 2>working on it where we don't hear about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

633
00:28:50.311 --> 00:28:52.950
<v Speaker 2>but it's not something that's brought up</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the news.</v>

634
00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.770
<v Speaker 2>It's just one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was killed.</v>

635
00:28:55.771 --> 00:28:58.740
<v Speaker 2>there's no leads and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was odd that julian is.</v>

636
00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.430
<v Speaker 2>Andre mentioned that as if it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

637
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.930
<v Speaker 2>leading people to think that he was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaker.</v>

638
00:29:03.931 --> 00:29:05.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

639
00:29:05.581 --> 00:29:10.581
<v Speaker 2>that's what he said is essentially his </v>
<v Speaker 2>words to paraphrase were that there are </v>

640
00:29:10.581 --> 00:29:13.950
<v Speaker 2>consequences to giving us information </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a pretty serious charge.</v>

641
00:29:13.951 --> 00:29:16.520
<v Speaker 2>Basically like he was killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was alive.</v>

642
00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:19.410
<v Speaker 2>If julian assange is a liar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's not true,</v>

643
00:29:19.411 --> 00:29:24.411
<v Speaker 2>that everything he says has to be taken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to take into consideration </v>

644
00:29:24.411 --> 00:29:26.580
<v Speaker 2>everything he says because he's a liar </v>
<v Speaker 2>now because he did.</v>

645
00:29:26.581 --> 00:29:30.000
<v Speaker 2>He really like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he actually come out and say that or</v>

646
00:29:30.001 --> 00:29:35.001
<v Speaker 2>did you kind of insinuate being this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>was killed and that's let's find out </v>

647
00:29:35.251 --> 00:29:37.020
<v Speaker 2>what's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find out what his exact words were.</v>

648
00:29:37.021 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure that his words were that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are consequences for giving</v>

649
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.550
<v Speaker 1>us information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so crazy when you look at what</v>

650
00:29:45.551 --> 00:29:50.551
<v Speaker 1>that allegation was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia hacked our election and 52 </v>

651
00:29:50.551 --> 00:29:53.401
<v Speaker 1>percent of democratic voters actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>think they hacked the vote when really </v>

652
00:29:53.401 --> 00:29:54.970
<v Speaker 1>it was just pedesta fell for fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>phishing scam because he's an old idiot.</v>

653
00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to.</v>

654
00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.850
<v Speaker 4>That's what I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Allegedly.</v>

655
00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:03.340
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

656
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:08.370
<v Speaker 4>that guy is super problematic regardless</v>
<v Speaker 4>of how ridiculous the pizza gate thing </v>

657
00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:09.430
<v Speaker 4>is and what's real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's not real,</v>

658
00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:14.790
<v Speaker 4>what is real is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Him and his brother were Close friends </v>

659
00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:18.211
<v Speaker 4>with dennis hastert who was the speaker </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the house who was fucking kids for </v>

660
00:30:18.761 --> 00:30:22.570
<v Speaker 4>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fact these in jail for fucking kids.</v>

661
00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:27.900
<v Speaker 4>That was the speaker of the house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that the speaker of the house </v>

662
00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.700
<v Speaker 4>could be a serial child molester and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what he is.</v>

663
00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:35.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's literally with the judge called </v>

664
00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:35.910
<v Speaker 4>him when he sentenced him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

665
00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:37.270
<v Speaker 4>And alan dershowitz,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trump and</v>

666
00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:40.230
<v Speaker 1>clinton were on the lolita express.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would that billionaire,</v>

667
00:30:40.231 --> 00:30:42.630
<v Speaker 1>that rape plane that had like a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>underage girls?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

669
00:30:43.861 --> 00:30:45.330
<v Speaker 1>What does that feel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that do?</v>

670
00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:50.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just this crazy billing or who </v>

671
00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:52.251
<v Speaker 1>had some island that was known as some </v>
<v Speaker 1>like sex ring and had a bunch of young </v>

672
00:30:52.251 --> 00:30:53.580
<v Speaker 1>kids and all these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these dudes were.</v>

673
00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.040
<v Speaker 4>We're going there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here it goes.</v>

674
00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:58.520
<v Speaker 4>Whistleblowers go through significant </v>
<v Speaker 4>efforts to get us material.</v>

675
00:30:58.521 --> 00:31:01.140
<v Speaker 4>Often very significant risks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A 27 year old,</v>

676
00:31:01.141 --> 00:31:06.141
<v Speaker 4>the worse for the dnc was shot in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>back murdered just two weeks ago for </v>

677
00:31:06.141 --> 00:31:07.010
<v Speaker 4>unknown reasons as he was walking down </v>
<v Speaker 4>the street and Washington.</v>

678
00:31:07.011 --> 00:31:08.630
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the guy says,</v>

<v Speaker 4>NothIng was robbed.</v>

681
00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.190
<v Speaker 4>Says I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't it?</v>

682
00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:15.110
<v Speaker 4>And assad says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

683
00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:16.520
<v Speaker 4>there's no finding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

684
00:31:16.521 --> 00:31:17.870
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the anchor says,</v>

685
00:31:17.871 --> 00:31:19.640
<v Speaker 4>what are you suggesting?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you suggesting?</v>

686
00:31:19.641 --> 00:31:24.641
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am suggesting that our sources take </v>

687
00:31:24.641 --> 00:31:27.191
<v Speaker 4>risks and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they become concerned to see things </v>

688
00:31:27.191 --> 00:31:28.730
<v Speaker 4>occurring like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

689
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.650
<v Speaker 4>But was he one of your sources?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sources?</v>

690
00:31:30.651 --> 00:31:31.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the anchor says,</v>

691
00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:36.910
<v Speaker 4>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't comment on who our sources are </v>

692
00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:39.490
<v Speaker 4>and the anchor says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but why make suggestions about a young </v>

693
00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:39.490
<v Speaker 4>guy being shot in the streets of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Washington?</v>

694
00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:44.180
<v Speaker 4>Assan says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we have to understand how high </v>

695
00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:47.321
<v Speaker 4>the stakes are in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>our sources are sources face serious </v>

696
00:31:47.321 --> 00:31:51.551
<v Speaker 4>risks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why they come to us so we can </v>

697
00:31:51.551 --> 00:31:52.620
<v Speaker 4>protect their anonymity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

698
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:58.570
<v Speaker 4>I found an article about </v>
<v Speaker 4>representational state transfer that </v>

699
00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:02.650
<v Speaker 4>series.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The government is fucking monitoring my </v>

700
00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:06.311
<v Speaker 4>conversation with abby martin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to say to the government </v>

701
00:32:06.311 --> 00:32:06.311
<v Speaker 4>listened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fuCks.</v>

702
00:32:06.311 --> 00:32:08.360

<v Speaker 4>everybody else.</v>

703
00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.870
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to attack my goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 4>phone.</v>

704
00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:11.430
<v Speaker 4>So that Is really great.</v>

705
00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.280
<v Speaker 1>so he's kind of saying it without saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

706
00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:18.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why he's doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also tweeted out some pizza gate </v>

707
00:32:18.801 --> 00:32:20.100
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know what,</v>

708
00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:21.780
<v Speaker 1>what the deal is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know that,</v>

709
00:32:21.781 --> 00:32:24.710
<v Speaker 1>that that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing about the pizzagate</v>

710
00:32:24.711 --> 00:32:26.350
<v Speaker 1>thing is there's a lot of weird shit.</v>

711
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:31.410
<v Speaker 4>They're like the little international </v>
<v Speaker 4>child molesting symbol was a part of </v>

712
00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:33.790
<v Speaker 4>their logo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the weird artwork that that guy.</v>

713
00:32:33.791 --> 00:32:34.010
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

714
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

715
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a whole expose and podesta and he </v>

716
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 1>is a bougie chef so it's not</v>

717
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:45.100
<v Speaker 3>surprising that he would talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>pizza as being some like really high </v>

718
00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.521
<v Speaker 3>brow chef and they pride themselves on </v>
<v Speaker 3>how they cook all these expensive </v>

719
00:32:48.521 --> 00:32:52.240
<v Speaker 3>dinners and have these dinner parties </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the spirit cooking thing is </v>

720
00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.511
<v Speaker 3>like they're really into this elitist </v>
<v Speaker 3>subversive art scene and so they have.</v>

721
00:32:55.731 --> 00:33:00.731
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have weird ass art and it's really </v>

722
00:33:00.731 --> 00:33:02.891
<v Speaker 3>creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever they do nails when they're </v>

723
00:33:02.891 --> 00:33:04.901
<v Speaker 3>talking about little kids coming over </v>
<v Speaker 3>and getting in the jacuzzi and hanging </v>

724
00:33:04.901 --> 00:33:05.180
<v Speaker 3>out with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kids were going to entertain them.</v>

725
00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:05.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

726
00:33:05.811 --> 00:33:08.270
<v Speaker 3>I need a little bit more to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to really go down that rabbit hole.</v>

727
00:33:08.271 --> 00:33:09.380
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's pedophilia.</v>

728
00:33:09.381 --> 00:33:10.640
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in high places.</v>

729
00:33:10.641 --> 00:33:13.130
<v Speaker 3>The lolita express thing is a really </v>
<v Speaker 3>glaring example,</v>

730
00:33:13.131 --> 00:33:15.470
<v Speaker 3>but in terms of like john podesta been </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in a,</v>

731
00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:18.220
<v Speaker 3>in a pedophile sex trafficking ring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

732
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:22.040
<v Speaker 3>I feel like we need a little bit more to</v>
<v Speaker 3>go on because I feel like the what's out</v>

733
00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:24.140
<v Speaker 3>there right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems pretty self explanatory.</v>

734
00:33:24.141 --> 00:33:25.270
<v Speaker 3>It's like the art and the</v>

735
00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.600
<v Speaker 4>the cooking stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you,</v>

736
00:33:27.601 --> 00:33:32.601
<v Speaker 4>but little kids coming over the house </v>
<v Speaker 4>and getting in the jacuzzi like that </v>

737
00:33:32.601 --> 00:33:32.820
<v Speaker 4>little kids are coming over for </v>
<v Speaker 4>entertainment.</v>

00:33:35.251 --> 00:33:40.251

<v Speaker 4>really out of touch with how to talk </v>

740
00:33:40.251 --> 00:33:43.290
<v Speaker 4>about like their child fucking need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>mask it better.</v>

741

<v Speaker 4>Like I have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have kids that age and if I'm in the </v>

<v Speaker 2>podcast world probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's on,</v>

809
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many different radio </v>
<v Speaker 2>stations,</v>

810
00:37:09.901 --> 00:37:12.150
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it's more than a hundred.</v>

811
00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.670
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a crazy reach,</v>

812
00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:20.090
<v Speaker 2>so it was a wise move by trump and as </v>
<v Speaker 2>long as he gets on alex's show and </v>

813
00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:22.740
<v Speaker 2>doesn't say anything to fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>like those people,</v>

814
00:37:22.741 --> 00:37:24.900
<v Speaker 2>like I can't believe the president is </v>
<v Speaker 2>with alex.</v>

815
00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:28.470
<v Speaker 2>You get those people and then you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that don't like alex.</v>

816
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:32.310
<v Speaker 2>You get those people to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get the hardcore republican base who</v>

817
00:37:32.311 --> 00:37:35.220
<v Speaker 2>just want to quote unquote make America </v>
<v Speaker 2>great again and wear red hats.</v>

818
00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.540
<v Speaker 2>You get those people to.</v>

819
00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is extremely smart.</v>

820
00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:39.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how went.</v>

821
00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:40.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a reality star.</v>

822
00:37:40.531 --> 00:37:43.020
<v Speaker 2>Who won the biggest reality competition </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

823
00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:44.700
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly how to put it in.</v>

824
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:49.910
<v Speaker 2>It was the first time that an actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>popular person entered this popularity </v>

825
00:37:50.161 --> 00:37:51.470
<v Speaker 2>contest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really what,</v>

826
00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:52.770
<v Speaker 2>happily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>

827
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:54.150
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're right,</v>

828
00:37:54.151 --> 00:37:59.151
<v Speaker 2>he knew how to play the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bannon knew exactly how to work the </v>

829
00:37:59.151 --> 00:37:59.151
<v Speaker 2>media to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

830
00:37:59.151 --> 00:38:03.651
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to cultivate that Alex Jones crowd </v>

831
00:38:03.651 --> 00:38:05.010
<v Speaker 2>because people are analyzing the results</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the election and wondering,</v>

832
00:38:05.011 --> 00:38:06.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you win?</v>

833
00:38:06.121 --> 00:38:06.900
<v Speaker 2>HoW did he win?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

834
00:38:06.901 --> 00:38:11.750
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that's a huge component that</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one really puts any credit to is that</v>

835
00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.150
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

836
00:38:14.151 --> 00:38:16.860
<v Speaker 2>this like voting block that never was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really active before,</v>

837
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:21.920
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than ron paul will also this </v>

838
00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:21.920
<v Speaker 2>outright thing that we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

839
00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:22.290
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

840
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:27.500
<v Speaker 2>there's groups of people that were never</v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in politics that are now </v>

841
00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.610
<v Speaker 2>treating it the same way they treat </v>
<v Speaker 2>sports.</v>

842
00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.760
<v Speaker 2>The these guys are sports fans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

843
00:38:32.761 --> 00:38:34.860
<v Speaker 2>that's really what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

844
00:38:34.861 --> 00:38:37.390
<v Speaker 2>this is my team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on team trump,</v>

845
00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:38.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these fucking.</v>

846
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:40.530
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

847
00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:45.250
<v Speaker 2>it's a corp man in and they're showing </v>
<v Speaker 2>up at these berkeley rallies and they're</v>

848
00:38:45.251 --> 00:38:49.690
<v Speaker 2>fighting with people now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like now you've got people responding.</v>

849
00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.210
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the real problems with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the left,</v>

850
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:57.630
<v Speaker 2>the real problem with these really </v>
<v Speaker 2>hardcore lefties that are outraged and </v>

851
00:38:57.630 --> 00:39:01.651
<v Speaker 2>want to do something and they want to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive so they want to shut down all </v>

852
00:39:01.651 --> 00:39:05.590
<v Speaker 2>these people like milo that the thinker </v>
<v Speaker 2>nazis or ann coulter and all these </v>

853
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:09.331
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by doing that and by having these </v>

854
00:39:09.331 --> 00:39:11.671
<v Speaker 2>gigantic protest and it literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>shutting down people communicating and </v>

855
00:39:11.671 --> 00:39:11.680
<v Speaker 2>talking.</v>

856
00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:16.950
<v Speaker 2>You invite people to resist that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you start these antifa people hit </v>

857
00:39:18.011 --> 00:39:19.930
<v Speaker 2>people in the head with fucking bike </v>
<v Speaker 2>locks.</v>

858
00:39:19.931 --> 00:39:24.931
<v Speaker 2>You see the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they found that it was a professor that </v>

859
00:39:24.931 --> 00:39:27.331
<v Speaker 2>was hitting people in the head with bike</v>
<v Speaker 2>locks and that this is going to have </v>

860
00:39:27.331 --> 00:39:30.730
<v Speaker 2>people show up and want to hit you with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and so you can you see now,</v>

861
00:39:30.731 --> 00:39:35.731
<v Speaker 2>and I've seen plenty of footage of trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>protesters and supporters beating other </v>

862
00:39:35.731 --> 00:39:39.961
<v Speaker 2>people out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like getting comfortable on both </v>

863
00:39:39.961 --> 00:39:39.961
<v Speaker 2>sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coming from both sides now,</v>

864
00:39:39.961 --> 00:39:43.200
<v Speaker 2>but I almost feel like this is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>manufactured thing because I think that </v>

865
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.801
<v Speaker 2>there's been from the oakland area and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've an antifa has been showing up at </v>

866
00:39:46.801 --> 00:39:50.910
<v Speaker 2>every protest for as long as I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember and the cops kind of like our </v>

867
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:54.361
<v Speaker 2>hands off and so I feel like to provoke </v>
<v Speaker 2>the antifa block where you know that </v>

868
00:39:54.581 --> 00:39:59.581
<v Speaker 2>they're like really strategically </v>
<v Speaker 2>oriented and keep going to berkeley and </v>

869
00:39:59.581 --> 00:40:03.091
<v Speaker 2>keep going at berkeley and then making </v>
<v Speaker 2>it like this big free speech blowout </v>

870
00:40:03.091 --> 00:40:03.091
<v Speaker 2>where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you keep going?</v>

871
00:40:03.091 --> 00:40:06.760
<v Speaker 2>And like creating the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kind of know what's going to happen.</v>

872
00:40:06.761 --> 00:40:11.761
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a manufactured thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then at the end of the day it makes the </v>

873
00:40:11.761 --> 00:40:15.361
<v Speaker 2>left easier to demonize and end </v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically protests easier to demonize </v>

874
00:40:15.361 --> 00:40:19.831
<v Speaker 2>where now you have 200 people facing </v>
<v Speaker 2>felony riot charges at the inauguration </v>

875
00:40:19.831 --> 00:40:24.601
<v Speaker 2>protests and a couple of them are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists who are filming and all the </v>

876
00:40:24.601 --> 00:40:24.601
<v Speaker 2>trump people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

877
00:40:24.601 --> 00:40:26.590
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking writing and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascists in there.</v>

878
00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:27.310
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

879
00:40:27.311 --> 00:40:29.770
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this happened in berkeley now,</v>

880
00:40:29.771 --> 00:40:31.920
<v Speaker 2>like all protesters are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

881
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:35.850
<v Speaker 2>they're scapegoated to these people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I still get to.</v>

882
00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:41.600
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to box people in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think what's going on at berkeley </v>

883
00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.191
<v Speaker 2>is it's the most outrageously liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>place in the country in berkeley is and </v>

884
00:40:44.561 --> 00:40:47.200
<v Speaker 2>always has been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you go there.</v>

885
00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so lefty that it's like it's a </v>

886
00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:52.210
<v Speaker 2>great target.</v>

887
00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:52.670
<v Speaker 2>It's a great place to get things </v>
<v Speaker 2>popping.</v>

888
00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:56.530
<v Speaker 2>So if I was milo or if I was ann coulter</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what is the culture do?</v>

889
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:58.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean she Wants to sell books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's a troll,</v>

890
00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.590
<v Speaker 2>she's a troll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's totally patrol and we tell them to</v>

891
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.330
<v Speaker 2>be able to rule like probably ashley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just one of those,</v>

892
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.340
<v Speaker 2>she's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a performance artist.</v>

893
00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

894
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:13.710
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's absolutely a performance artist </v>

895
00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:14.920
<v Speaker 2>and not a very good one because if she </v>
<v Speaker 2>was that in trump,</v>

896
00:41:14.921 --> 00:41:18.370
<v Speaker 2>we trust book like the whole cover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what in the fuck is that?</v>

897
00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:22.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was just bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just bizarre that,</v>

898
00:41:22.061 --> 00:41:24.250
<v Speaker 2>that like that she wrote that book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was almost like,</v>

899
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:25.480
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is cheap.</v>

900
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:30.510
<v Speaker 2>Even for her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is just like a cheap ploy </v>

901
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:30.970
<v Speaker 2>during this whole trump movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She sees the,</v>

902
00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 2>the whole momentum of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she's going to write a book and</v>

903
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.390
<v Speaker 4>put trump in the title of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

904
00:41:35.391 --> 00:41:37.790
<v Speaker 4>it's so stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's weird.</v>

905
00:41:37.791 --> 00:41:40.580
<v Speaker 4>It's just weird that it's so easy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it makes sense.</v>

906
00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:44.510
<v Speaker 4>Just like we were talking about how </v>
<v Speaker 4>reagan sort of mobilized the right wing,</v>

907
00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:49.570
<v Speaker 4>conservative people that were christians</v>
<v Speaker 4>that really weren't about politics </v>

908
00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:51.050
<v Speaker 4>before that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he kind of brought them in.</v>

909
00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.840
<v Speaker 4>People real like they look at it and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey look,</v>

910
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:55.040
<v Speaker 4>this is an angle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

911
00:41:55.041 --> 00:42:00.041
<v Speaker 4>there's an angle we can take that no </v>
<v Speaker 4>one's been taking and this you're kind </v>

912
00:42:00.041 --> 00:42:00.410
<v Speaker 4>of like a bait and switch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This whole mila,</v>

913
00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:04.100
<v Speaker 4>mila berkeley thing becausE they know </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly what's going to happen when they</v>

914
00:42:04.101 --> 00:42:09.101
<v Speaker 4>go there and then of course that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly what happens and then they can </v>

915
00:42:09.101 --> 00:42:09.101
<v Speaker 4>use it to be like free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 4>free speech.</v>

916
00:42:09.101 --> 00:42:10.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean it just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well he knows what he's doing.</v>

917
00:42:10.491 --> 00:42:12.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a clever guy.</v>

918
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:17.470
<v Speaker 4>He's very clever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Mean he knows exactly what he's doing </v>

919
00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:17.720
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and milo at one point in time,</v>

920
00:42:17.721 --> 00:42:22.721
<v Speaker 4>by the way was a guy who was very anti </v>
<v Speaker 4>hate speech,</v>

921
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:28.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was very anti shutting down </v>

922
00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:28.750
<v Speaker 4>people who were writing things to hurt </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

923
00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:31.010
<v Speaker 4>People have like pulled quotes of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the past,</v>

924
00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:36.610
<v Speaker 4>whiCh is intEresting because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm sure peOple's philosophies </v>

925
00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:37.370
<v Speaker 4>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure mine have and yours have,</v>

926
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:42.550
<v Speaker 4>but this is like one more piece of </v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence that what you're seeing with a </v>

927
00:42:43.251 --> 00:42:48.251
<v Speaker 4>lot of people that are in the public eye</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are involved in this whole </v>

928
00:42:48.251 --> 00:42:49.700
<v Speaker 4>political arena is you're seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're working angles.</v>

929
00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:51.020
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the angle like,</v>

930
00:42:51.021 --> 00:42:56.021
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's go that way and you can justify </v>

931
00:42:56.021 --> 00:42:56.021
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

932
00:42:56.021 --> 00:42:56.150
<v Speaker 4>I could justify a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 4>angles if I wanted to do that,</v>

933
00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:57.140
<v Speaker 4>if I want it to be.</v>

934
00:42:57.530 --> 00:43:01.240
<v Speaker 4>If I wanted to be in an anti trump </v>
<v Speaker 4>protest or an anti free speech poster,</v>

935
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:06.280
<v Speaker 4>if I wanted to be a person who thinks </v>
<v Speaker 4>that free speech should be limited </v>

936
00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.490
<v Speaker 4>because hate speech is not protected by </v>
<v Speaker 4>the constitution.</v>

937
00:43:07.491 --> 00:43:09.980
<v Speaker 4>Like howard dean just said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that fucking asshole.</v>

938
00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.560
<v Speaker 4>He said hate speech is not protected by </v>
<v Speaker 4>the constitution.</v>

939
00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:13.780
<v Speaker 4>The first amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

940
00:43:13.781 --> 00:43:14.780
<v Speaker 4>Yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Howard.</v>

941
00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:17.700
<v Speaker 4>You fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a goddamn representative.</v>

942
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:21.170
<v Speaker 4>Nazi parties exist actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they can have rallies,</v>

943
00:43:21.171 --> 00:43:24.680
<v Speaker 4>you know like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That happens in this country when he was</v>

944
00:43:24.681 --> 00:43:27.740
<v Speaker 4>saying it about two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was ridiculous.</v>

945
00:43:27.741 --> 00:43:28.780
<v Speaker 4>Our.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would.</v>

946
00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.460
<v Speaker 4>The way he said it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't even like justified.</v>

947
00:43:31.461 --> 00:43:33.020
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like someone was saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

948
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:36.950
<v Speaker 4>we need to gather up these gay people </v>
<v Speaker 4>and hang them from stop signs.</v>

949
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:42.100
<v Speaker 4>That's not what people are saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't anything that extreme where </v>

950
00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:42.100
<v Speaker 4>he.</v>

951
00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:42.710
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was ann coulter,</v>

952
00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:46.610
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure who pulled that up,</v>

953
00:43:46.611 --> 00:43:51.611
<v Speaker 4>see if you can find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure howard dean was talking </v>

954
00:43:51.611 --> 00:43:54.851
<v Speaker 4>about ann coulter and he was saying that</v>
<v Speaker 4>hate speech is not protected by the </v>

955
00:43:54.851 --> 00:43:56.590
<v Speaker 4>first amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what is he advocating around to?</v>

956
00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.550
<v Speaker 4>Roundup angLed his arrest her for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just saying that she should be.</v>

957
00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:03.270
<v Speaker 4>That you can stop her talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just,</v>

958
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:04.550
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was our nuts.</v>

959
00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:09.640
<v Speaker 4>Poorly thought out statement that got </v>
<v Speaker 4>trampled just thrown out and everybody </v>

960
00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:16.800
<v Speaker 4>sort of repeating it over and over and </v>
<v Speaker 4>over again and I just don't think he </v>

961
00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:16.800
<v Speaker 4>thought about it when he was saying it </v>
<v Speaker 4>or the consequences.</v>

962
00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here it is.</v>

963
00:44:17.871 --> 00:44:19.340
<v Speaker 4>Was it about anne culter?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

964
00:44:19.341 --> 00:44:22.340
<v Speaker 4>It was about hey cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>upcoming speech in Vermont,</v>

965
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:24.980
<v Speaker 4>the Vermont dnc chair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>howard dean,</v>

966
00:44:24.981 --> 00:44:29.981
<v Speaker 4>elaborated on his argument that ann </v>
<v Speaker 4>coulter's upcoming speech at berkeley </v>

967
00:44:29.981 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 4>does not have to occur because hate </v>
<v Speaker 4>speech in</v>

968
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.110
<v Speaker 2>quotes is not protected by the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>amendment.</v>

969
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.730
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

970
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

971
00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:40.250
<v Speaker 2>just have someone to bait her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that goddamn hard her.</v>

972
00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.180
<v Speaker 2>It has something to say what we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

973
00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:44.430
<v Speaker 2>but what about the safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the safe space?</v>

974
00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:46.860
<v Speaker 2>like hysteria where people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to save spaces,</v>

975
00:44:46.861 --> 00:44:51.861
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then there it's the same people who </v>

976
00:44:51.861 --> 00:44:51.861
<v Speaker 2>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you protesting as like,</v>

977
00:44:51.861 --> 00:44:52.500
<v Speaker 2>let us debate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then fucking what is it?</v>

978
00:44:52.501 --> 00:44:57.501
<v Speaker 2>Do you want safe spaces are not they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you want to have debates or </v>

979
00:44:57.501 --> 00:45:02.031
<v Speaker 2>you want to have speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can't Stop people in berkeley </v>

980
00:45:02.031 --> 00:45:02.910
<v Speaker 2>from coming in protesting you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's protecting you.</v>

981
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:07.740
<v Speaker 2>It's such a fundamental idea that we all</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that in order to,</v>

982
00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:10.500
<v Speaker 2>if you're gonna have a discussion with </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>

983
00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:14.670
<v Speaker 2>you have to let that person established.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what debates are about,</v>

984
00:45:14.671 --> 00:45:14.880
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

985
00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:20.120
<v Speaker 2>let that person establish their position</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then give your counter to that </v>

986
00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:22.020
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this is like so firmly established in</v>

987
00:45:22.021 --> 00:45:25.440
<v Speaker 2>the way we communicate and the way we go</v>
<v Speaker 2>over ideas,</v>

988
00:45:25.441 --> 00:45:27.810
<v Speaker 2>that is essentially the marketplace of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

989
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:30.600
<v Speaker 2>You have your idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone has an opposing idea.</v>

990
00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:35.310
<v Speaker 2>If you don't let that person establish </v>
<v Speaker 2>their idea and you shut it down,</v>

991
00:45:35.311 --> 00:45:40.311
<v Speaker 2>shut it down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you throw in rocks and burning cop </v>

992
00:45:40.311 --> 00:45:40.500
<v Speaker 2>cars and throwing bricks through </v>
<v Speaker 2>starbucks.</v>

993
00:45:40.501 --> 00:45:45.501
<v Speaker 2>Windows like you are feeding the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>resistance to your ideas.</v>

994
00:45:45.991 --> 00:45:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Flames like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

995
00:45:47.551 --> 00:45:52.551
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're feeding the people that are </v>

996
00:45:52.551 --> 00:45:56.301
<v Speaker 2>saying that they're right and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong because you are against recently </v>

997
00:45:56.301 --> 00:46:00.200
<v Speaker 2>cheating feeding that again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People sympathize with like Richard </v>

998
00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:00.810
<v Speaker 2>Spencer after he got punched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

999
00:46:00.811 --> 00:46:01.890
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem.</v>

1000
00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:07.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a problem because all you have to </v>

1001
00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:07.040
<v Speaker 2>do is let those people hang themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give them a rope,</v>

1002
00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:10.410
<v Speaker 2>give them broad plenum talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to have someone qualified.</v>

1003
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.410
<v Speaker 2>You have to have someone who can have </v>
<v Speaker 2>that speech with them and you can't have</v>

1004
00:46:13.411 --> 00:46:15.210
<v Speaker 2>the fucking audience shout them down </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

1005
00:46:15.211 --> 00:46:17.540
<v Speaker 2>It's a disservice to both ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both,</v>

1006
00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:22.970
<v Speaker 2>but I've heard people say like as </v>
<v Speaker 2>nazi-ism really a an idea worthwhile of </v>

1007
00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:24.720
<v Speaker 2>putting it in the marketplace of ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>like your advocate is genocide.</v>

1008
00:46:24.721 --> 00:46:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard spencer.</v>

1009
00:46:26.071 --> 00:46:27.240
<v Speaker 2>So you that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1010
00:46:27.241 --> 00:46:32.241
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you are going to have someone </v>

1011
00:46:32.241 --> 00:46:34.671
<v Speaker 2>debate them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have someone debate them in a venue </v>

1012
00:46:34.671 --> 00:46:35.850
<v Speaker 2>where let everyone watch it online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1013
00:46:35.851 --> 00:46:37.740
<v Speaker 2>how do you debate someone that wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>exterminate you?</v>

1014
00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.120
<v Speaker 2>like if you're like a black person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1015
00:46:39.121 --> 00:46:40.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy who,</v>

1016
00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:42.900
<v Speaker 2>whose main premise of the argument is </v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't exist.</v>

1017
00:46:42.901 --> 00:46:43.950
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1018
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.360
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard people,</v>

1019
00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:47.220
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a confusing topic,</v>

1020
00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:49.620
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't debate them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't,</v>

1021
00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:54.330
<v Speaker 2>if you shut down their speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you stop and then you can,</v>

1022
00:46:54.331 --> 00:46:57.090
<v Speaker 2>they can frame what they were going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say in a very different way.</v>

1023
00:46:57.330 --> 00:47:00.090
<v Speaker 2>They can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can gather sympathy with people who</v>

1024
00:47:00.091 --> 00:47:05.091
<v Speaker 2>were more pro speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more pro free speech than they are anti </v>

1025
00:47:05.101 --> 00:47:06.470
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that they,</v>

1026
00:47:06.471 --> 00:47:08.220
<v Speaker 2>they still are a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we were saying before,</v>

1027
00:47:08.221 --> 00:47:13.221
<v Speaker 2>nazis still have rallies like no one is </v>
<v Speaker 2>shutting down these from a government </v>

1028
00:47:13.221 --> 00:47:14.070
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think the whole censorship thing is</v>

1029
00:47:14.071 --> 00:47:17.700
<v Speaker 2>not relevant to this situation because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that really does mean like the black end</v>

1030
00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:21.390
<v Speaker 2>of the state like coming down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>blocking you and instead we have what we</v>

1031
00:47:21.391 --> 00:47:26.220
<v Speaker 2>cntf a blocking like physically these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these venues.</v>

1032
00:47:26.221 --> 00:47:31.221
<v Speaker 2>But it's not like these people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>blocked from having venues or access or </v>

1033
00:47:31.221 --> 00:47:31.221
<v Speaker 2>speech</v>

1034
00:47:31.221 --> 00:47:31.900
<v Speaker 4>platforms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're fucking everywhere.</v>

1035
00:47:31.901 --> 00:47:34.600
<v Speaker 4>It's like I feel like all over the news,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's Richard Spencer,</v>

1036
00:47:34.601 --> 00:47:37.990
<v Speaker 4>the dapper nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all these interviews,</v>

1037
00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:43.070
<v Speaker 4>aren't these speeches in this one place?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Aren't they very retro like why even do </v>

1038
00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:45.160
<v Speaker 4>it that way?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why have an audience?</v>

1039
00:47:45.161 --> 00:47:50.161
<v Speaker 4>Why have an angry mom yelling outside or</v>
<v Speaker 4>even inside like create and cultivate </v>

1040
00:47:50.261 --> 00:47:52.060
<v Speaker 4>these situations and they can be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>martyrs,</v>

1041
00:47:52.061 --> 00:47:52.930
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That free speech,</v>

1042
00:47:52.931 --> 00:47:54.610
<v Speaker 4>martyrs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what they're doing.</v>

1043
00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:59.640
<v Speaker 4>It's a very poor way to go over ideas </v>
<v Speaker 4>though I think a better way to go over </v>

1044
00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:03.811
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As you have a moderator and two people </v>

1045
00:48:03.811 --> 00:48:06.781
<v Speaker 4>in a room together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that that simple one person </v>

1046
00:48:06.781 --> 00:48:09.970
<v Speaker 4>isn't a lot of time where they can </v>
<v Speaker 4>express themselves than the other person</v>

1047
00:48:09.971 --> 00:48:14.530
<v Speaker 4>has a lot of time where they can counter</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're not allowed to chime in.</v>

1048
00:48:14.531 --> 00:48:15.760
<v Speaker 4>You're not allowed to interrupt.</v>

1049
00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:20.140
<v Speaker 4>You're not allowed to in any way disrupt</v>
<v Speaker 4>this person's flow of ideas.</v>

1050
00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:25.380
<v Speaker 4>Then there should be a time set aside </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you could Go back and forth with </v>

1051
00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.340
<v Speaker 4>each other and unless you do it that </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

1052
00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:30.070
<v Speaker 4>you're going to involve the cult of </v>
<v Speaker 4>personality.</v>

1053
00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:32.350
<v Speaker 4>You're going to involve the cheers from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the crowds.</v>

1054
00:48:32.351 --> 00:48:37.351
<v Speaker 4>You're going to involve all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>different people that can organize to </v>

1055
00:48:37.351 --> 00:48:38.190
<v Speaker 4>Sway things one way or another or all </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1056
00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:39.910
<v Speaker 4>shut it down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shut it down,</v>

1057
00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:41.160
<v Speaker 4>shut it down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's.</v>

1058
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:46.230
<v Speaker 4>It gets as ridiculous as like Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 4>Peterson speeches and I'm sure you've </v>

1059
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:49.621
<v Speaker 4>seen that professor of university of </v>
<v Speaker 4>toronto that doesn't want to use all </v>

1060
00:48:49.621 --> 00:48:49.621
<v Speaker 4>these meetup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gender pronouns.</v>

1061
00:48:49.621 --> 00:48:53.850
<v Speaker 4>The 78 now accepted gender pronouns </v>
<v Speaker 4>Canada has really weird laws in Canada.</v>

1062
00:48:54.611 --> 00:48:59.611
<v Speaker 4>Has they don't have free speech the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>we have free speech and they have a </v>

1063
00:48:59.611 --> 00:49:02.821
<v Speaker 4>human rights council and they've decided</v>
<v Speaker 4>that these 78 or whatever the fuck they </v>

1064
00:49:04.541 --> 00:49:09.541
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>however many they decide on gender </v>

1065
00:49:09.541 --> 00:49:09.541
<v Speaker 4>pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that if you don't use them,</v>

1066
00:49:09.541 --> 00:49:09.880
<v Speaker 4>if someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1067
00:49:09.881 --> 00:49:13.750
<v Speaker 4>I want you to call me fox can 26,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for real,</v>

1068
00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:17.680
<v Speaker 4>like if you don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're imposing on their human rights.</v>

1069
00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:23.280
<v Speaker 4>Other people have debated him and said </v>
<v Speaker 4>that though that's not how it should be </v>

1070
00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.911
<v Speaker 4>interpreted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's like a very staunch critic of </v>

1071
00:49:26.911 --> 00:49:30.001
<v Speaker 4>marxism and he understands the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the real ideology of marxism and how it </v>

1072
00:49:30.001 --> 00:49:31.330
<v Speaker 4>went horribly wrong all throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>

1073
00:49:31.331 --> 00:49:36.331
<v Speaker 4>throughout history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that he thinks that what you're </v>

1074
00:49:36.331 --> 00:49:39.190
<v Speaker 4>trying to do when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're invoking like this,</v>

1075
00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:44.220
<v Speaker 4>when you're asking the government to </v>
<v Speaker 4>tell people what they must or must not </v>

1076
00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:46.810
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you are going down this road,</v>

1077
00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:49.420
<v Speaker 4>this very dangerous road of cultural </v>
<v Speaker 4>marxist.</v>

1078
00:49:49.421 --> 00:49:50.560
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what does cultural marxism,</v>

1079
00:49:50.561 --> 00:49:55.561
<v Speaker 4>because I've heard this said and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually have no idea what the hell it </v>

1080
00:49:55.561 --> 00:49:57.070
<v Speaker 4>means because marxism is simply a </v>
<v Speaker 4>critique on capitalism,</v>

1081
00:49:57.071 --> 00:49:59.490
<v Speaker 4>so I don't understand this whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>cultural marxism like,</v>

1082
00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:04.560
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's let's get the dead house has </v>

1083
00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:05.380
<v Speaker 4>anything to do with gender pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you'd have to talk to peterson about</v>

1084
00:50:05.381 --> 00:50:05.730
<v Speaker 4>how it.</v>

1085
00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:09.600
<v Speaker 4>But he makes a very compelling argument </v>
<v Speaker 4>about how the two of them are connected.</v>

1086
00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:14.640
<v Speaker 4>Essentially what people are trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>is control your behavior and they're </v>

1087
00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:18.611
<v Speaker 4>just trying to in some way force you to </v>
<v Speaker 4>behave the way they would like you to </v>

1088
00:50:19.151 --> 00:50:21.010
<v Speaker 4>behave,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if it's a preposterous thing,</v>

1089
00:50:21.011 --> 00:50:24.160
<v Speaker 4>like making up words and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>call them this instead of he,</v>

1090
00:50:24.161 --> 00:50:29.161
<v Speaker 4>she or even like even like the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that want to use they riches know </v>

1091
00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:31.610
<v Speaker 4>plurals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is fine.</v>

1092
00:50:31.611 --> 00:50:34.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean like that's a real word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1093
00:50:34.131 --> 00:50:36.830
<v Speaker 4>if you want to use it in an incorrect </v>
<v Speaker 4>way and it does get used like,</v>

1094
00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:37.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1095
00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:41.360
<v Speaker 4>it does use like if anybody wants to use</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bathroom,</v>

1096
00:50:41.361 --> 00:50:46.361
<v Speaker 4>they can go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can be using that in a singular </v>

1097
00:50:46.361 --> 00:50:46.361
<v Speaker 4>term,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1098
00:50:46.361 --> 00:50:46.361
<v Speaker 4>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1099
00:50:46.361 --> 00:50:50.230
<v Speaker 4>it's non gender specific.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there is like open interpretation in </v>

1100
00:50:50.361 --> 00:50:52.460
<v Speaker 4>the stanDard use of it in the english </v>
<v Speaker 4>language.</v>

1101
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:55.340
<v Speaker 4>So pulled up the term cultural marxism</v>

1102
00:50:56.210 --> 00:51:01.210
<v Speaker 1>that was looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't really find a great definition </v>

1103
00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:01.210
<v Speaker 1>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1104
00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:02.270
<v Speaker 1>it's a couple like the google research </v>
<v Speaker 1>assistants,</v>

1105
00:51:02.290 --> 00:51:04.630
<v Speaker 1>a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Calling it a conspiracy theory,</v>

1106
00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:11.240
<v Speaker 4>the urban dictionary definition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This isn't like an obvious social </v>

1107
00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:14.190
<v Speaker 4>political movement that promotes </v>
<v Speaker 4>unreasoned and irrationality through the</v>

1108
00:51:14.191 --> 00:51:17.720
<v Speaker 4>guise of various causes offering </v>
<v Speaker 4>promoted by so called social jet.</v>

1109
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:22.750
<v Speaker 4>This is a perfect example of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These causes and their proponents often </v>

1110
00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:25.740
<v Speaker 4>are often contradictory and are almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>always never rooted.</v>

1111
00:51:25.741 --> 00:51:30.741
<v Speaker 4>in fact indeed true argument or </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussion with proponents of these </v>

1112
00:51:30.741 --> 00:51:34.971
<v Speaker 4>causes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost impossible at most as most </v>

1113
00:51:34.971 --> 00:51:36.720
<v Speaker 4>attempts at discourse descend quickly </v>
<v Speaker 4>into shouting name,</v>

1114
00:51:36.721 --> 00:51:38.280
<v Speaker 4>calling and chanting slogans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1115
00:51:38.281 --> 00:51:41.040
<v Speaker 4>that's a perfect otherwise known as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>regressive</v>

1116
00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.170
<v Speaker 1>left a plate on the contradictory </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

1117
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:48.520
<v Speaker 1>I think that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this seems to be like a hub of the alt </v>

1118
00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:49.440
<v Speaker 1>right word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is founded on like this reactionary</v>

1119
00:51:49.441 --> 00:51:51.660
<v Speaker 1>movement on pc culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on things like that,</v>

1120
00:51:51.661 --> 00:51:56.661
<v Speaker 1>gender pronouns thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seems like there was no real </v>

1121
00:51:56.661 --> 00:52:00.360
<v Speaker 1>political ideology behind what is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outright other than just a reaction to </v>

1122
00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:04.341
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't want to conform to this </v>

1123
00:52:04.341 --> 00:52:04.341
<v Speaker 1>progressive whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural marxism,</v>

1124
00:52:04.341 --> 00:52:07.080
<v Speaker 1>but to me I feel like I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't knoW.</v>

1125
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:12.250
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't bother me as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what bothers me right now is just </v>

1126
00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:12.480
<v Speaker 1>like the empire fucking killing people </v>
<v Speaker 1>on my name.</v>

1127
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:15.300
<v Speaker 1>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No disgusting war criminal who's flipped</v>

1128
00:52:15.301 --> 00:52:17.000
<v Speaker 1>flopped on all the shit that he said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he said.</v>

1129
00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:19.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a different argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're absolutely right.</v>

1130
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:22.950
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying is these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are that upset about leftists,</v>

1131
00:52:22.951 --> 00:52:27.951
<v Speaker 1>like they think leftists are the problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that cultural marxism is like </v>

1132
00:52:27.951 --> 00:52:28.620
<v Speaker 1>ruining society and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this government doing?</v>

1133
00:52:28.621 --> 00:52:30.780
<v Speaker 1>Like The answer never stopped with when </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump won.</v>

1134
00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Jordan peterson a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's progressive.</v>

1135
00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:33.900
<v Speaker 1>He's a liberal.</v>

1136
00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:39.590
<v Speaker 4>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the guy who's arguing against </v>

1137
00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:40.320
<v Speaker 4>cultural marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marxism is actually a progressive.</v>

1138
00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.660
<v Speaker 4>He's actually the liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's not,</v>

1139
00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:44.940
<v Speaker 4>he's not a republican.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's definitely not outright.</v>

1140
00:52:44.941 --> 00:52:47.310
<v Speaker 4>He's canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they obviously have different parties</v>

1141
00:52:47.311 --> 00:52:49.320
<v Speaker 4>up there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's not an alright guy.</v>

1142
00:52:49.321 --> 00:52:51.990
<v Speaker 4>He's a professor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's not,</v>

1143
00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:57.050
<v Speaker 4>he's just sees that there's a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people on campus that are trying to </v>

1144
00:52:57.211 --> 00:52:58.950
<v Speaker 4>control the way other people </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate.</v>

1145
00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:00.970
<v Speaker 1>It'S just such as poor posture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1146
00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:05.980
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally hear that and I see where </v>

1147
00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:05.980
<v Speaker 1>people are really upset about that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

1148
00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:10.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see sj was in leftists are ruining </v>

1149
00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:10.510
<v Speaker 1>everything and to me it just seemed like</v>
<v Speaker 1>such an isolated,</v>

1150
00:53:10.511 --> 00:53:14.830
<v Speaker 1>like totally inconsequential thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in the rest of the world</v>

1151
00:53:14.831 --> 00:53:17.740
<v Speaker 1>and especially what trump is ramming </v>
<v Speaker 1>down everyone's throats.</v>

1152
00:53:17.741 --> 00:53:19.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this really the main issue here?</v>

1153
00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:20.830
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

1154
00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:22.450
<v Speaker 1>but I agree with you to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>extent,</v>

1155
00:53:22.451 --> 00:53:25.030
<v Speaker 1>but to not address that or to write it </v>
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

1156
00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:26.250
<v Speaker 1>it empowers</v>

1157
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:30.540
<v Speaker 2>the people that are fighting against it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because this year you're ignoring it.</v>

1158
00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:33.990
<v Speaker 2>Like to them it'S a giant issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The issue of free speech,</v>

1159
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:39.260
<v Speaker 2>the issue of not having people in force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever ideology that they have on you </v>

1160
00:53:41.011 --> 00:53:44.430
<v Speaker 2>that you have to behave the way they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want you to communicate,</v>

1161
00:53:44.431 --> 00:53:47.700
<v Speaker 2>they want you to or you're a bigot or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a nazi,</v>

1162
00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:52.760
<v Speaker 2>like punch a nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile you're an actual christian </v>

1163
00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:55.050
<v Speaker 2>evangelicals employing top down policy </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's actually telling people,</v>

1164
00:53:55.051 --> 00:53:56.640
<v Speaker 2>here's how education's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>around here,</v>

1165
00:53:56.641 --> 00:54:01.641
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to be indoctrinated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what I feel like we're </v>

1166
00:54:01.641 --> 00:54:04.641
<v Speaker 2>really missing the boat here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these new atheists who agree with </v>

1167
00:54:04.641 --> 00:54:07.911
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like don't want to be policed and aRe </v>

1168
00:54:07.911 --> 00:54:11.270
<v Speaker 2>more in line with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come they're not speaking out </v>

1169
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:12.600
<v Speaker 2>against the christian evangelical hold </v>
<v Speaker 2>over this adMinistration?</v>

1170
00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:14.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which ones are you talking about?</v>

1171
00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:15.870
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1172
00:54:15.871 --> 00:54:18.390
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1173
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:23.480
<v Speaker 2>I just kind of said that in the ether,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I guess I just haven't seen enough </v>

1174
00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:26.280
<v Speaker 2>critique of trump for bringing in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious fanaticism,</v>

1175
00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:27.090
<v Speaker 2>rc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

1176
00:54:27.091 --> 00:54:32.091
<v Speaker 2>But I've seen really great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's really good to hear it in </v>

1177
00:54:32.091 --> 00:54:32.190
<v Speaker 2>different circles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

1178
00:54:32.191 --> 00:54:34.050
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are talking about that.</v>

1179
00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:39.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what'S weird is that people think that </v>

1180
00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:41.631
<v Speaker 2>trump is so inept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They almost would prefer mike pence and </v>

1181
00:54:41.631 --> 00:54:42.810
<v Speaker 2>even ted cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrifying,</v>

1182
00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:48.050
<v Speaker 2>but it mean who's is it better or worse?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're not even choosing the </v>

1183
00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:52.161
<v Speaker 2>lesser of two evils.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're choosing in competence versus </v>

1184
00:54:52.161 --> 00:54:55.730
<v Speaker 2>this radical right wing christian </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology that we were terrified of in </v>

1185
00:54:56.131 --> 00:55:01.131
<v Speaker 2>the beginning or from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like ted cruz would have been a </v>

1186
00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:05.511
<v Speaker 2>terrible president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but many people now think he would've </v>

1187
00:55:05.511 --> 00:55:08.180
<v Speaker 2>been a better president than Donald </v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump and ted cruz and mike pence would </v>

1188
00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:10.560
<v Speaker 2>never have won because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>disgusting creatures and ted cruz is the</v>

1189
00:55:10.561 --> 00:55:12.600
<v Speaker 2>creepiest motherfucker I've ever seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>where he.</v>

1190
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:17.630
<v Speaker 2>He actually tweeted a photo of like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>butterfly cow made out of butter and </v>

1191
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:18.180
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was like,</v>

1192
00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:21.330
<v Speaker 2>my daughter's first word was butter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1193
00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:23.160
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you creepy psycho.</v>

1194
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:25.140
<v Speaker 2>So that creepy to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's creepy.</v>

1195
00:55:25.141 --> 00:55:26.280
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just weird.</v>

1196
00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:28.200
<v Speaker 2>It's just really in a butter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Butter is delicious.</v>

1197
00:55:28.201 --> 00:55:30.660
<v Speaker 2>It is delicious bread on toast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's super fucking weird.</v>

1198
00:55:30.661 --> 00:55:35.661
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people would never win without </v>

1199
00:55:35.661 --> 00:55:35.661
<v Speaker 2>trump being that conduit to like get in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the white house.</v>

1200
00:55:35.661 --> 00:55:36.630
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that with trump not </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1201
00:55:36.631 --> 00:55:38.010
<v Speaker 2>you don't have this veneer where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are like,</v>

1202
00:55:38.011 --> 00:55:38.970
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump's really liberal.</v>

1203
00:55:38.971 --> 00:55:39.390
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

1204
00:55:39.391 --> 00:55:44.391
<v Speaker 2>he really believes in this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you would just have pence and </v>

1205
00:55:44.391 --> 00:55:46.941
<v Speaker 2>that would be really straightforward of </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly who pence is and what he </v>

1206
00:55:46.941 --> 00:55:46.941
<v Speaker 2>believes in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1207
00:55:46.941 --> 00:55:48.150
<v Speaker 2>marco rubIo sucks as a debater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but god damn,</v>

1208
00:55:48.151 --> 00:55:51.210
<v Speaker 2>he's an eloquent and really well spoken </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1209
00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:54.690
<v Speaker 2>OutsIde of those debates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just folded under pressure.</v>

1210
00:55:54.691 --> 00:55:57.630
<v Speaker 2>He's not good with conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's been outstanding.</v>

1211
00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:00.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been outstandIng since then.</v>

1212
00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:02.010
<v Speaker 2>He just doesn't know how to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1213
00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:06.270
<v Speaker 2>That big fucking looming cultive </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality asshole,</v>

1214
00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:07.890
<v Speaker 2>and he just doesn't know how to deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

1215
00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:10.590
<v Speaker 2>Trump is such a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's such a pamper baby.</v>

1216
00:56:10.591 --> 00:56:13.260
<v Speaker 2>I saw this chart of um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many times,</v>

1217
00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:13.770
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1218
00:56:13.771 --> 00:56:17.340
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of a stupid thing because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not opposed to like taking vacations</v>

1219
00:56:17.341 --> 00:56:19.820
<v Speaker 2>or golfing or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the amount that he's gone where he's</v>

1220
00:56:19.821 --> 00:56:20.940
<v Speaker 2>just like gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Half the weekend.</v>

1221
00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:21.930
<v Speaker 2>Maro lago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like golf.</v>

1222
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:26.830
<v Speaker 2>They Spent $10 so far in the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred days,</v>

1223
00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:32.250
<v Speaker 2>trump spent almost as much money as </v>
<v Speaker 2>obama did an entire year on his </v>

1224
00:56:33.791 --> 00:56:35.560
<v Speaker 2>vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the first one.</v>

1225
00:56:35.561 --> 00:56:37.510
<v Speaker 2>Hundred days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So pampered.</v>

1226
00:56:37.511 --> 00:56:42.511
<v Speaker 2>He can't even get away from this world </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's a part of where he has to go </v>

1227
00:56:42.511 --> 00:56:43.660
<v Speaker 2>to a fucking country club and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by billionaires.</v>

1228
00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:48.700
<v Speaker 2>It's also so incredibly hypocritical </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was constantly complaining </v>

1229
00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:50.800
<v Speaker 2>about obama taking vacations and going </v>
<v Speaker 2>golf and he's golf more than anybody.</v>

1230
00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:52.630
<v Speaker 2>You look at the first hundred days of </v>
<v Speaker 2>clinton,</v>

1231
00:56:52.631 --> 00:56:53.920
<v Speaker 2>bush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obama and him.</v>

1232
00:56:53.921 --> 00:56:57.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like no one has done this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think obama maybe went golfing once in</v>

1233
00:56:57.761 --> 00:56:59.650
<v Speaker 2>the first hundred days and trump is like</v>
<v Speaker 2>every week,</v>

1234
00:56:59.651 --> 00:57:02.110
<v Speaker 2>four out of seven days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just gone.</v>

1235
00:57:02.111 --> 00:57:03.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's running the country here?</v>

1236
00:57:04.110 --> 00:57:06.220
<v Speaker 2>It is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1237
00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:11.310
<v Speaker 2>I just want to finish yesterday or </v>
<v Speaker 2>sunday that he hasn't taken a </v>

1238
00:57:11.310 --> 00:57:15.300
<v Speaker 2>international trip yet and at this point</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think George Bush had taken to and </v>

1239
00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:19.621
<v Speaker 2>obama taken a too busy at maro lago </v>
<v Speaker 2>international trip for out of the </v>

1240
00:57:19.621 --> 00:57:22.180
<v Speaker 2>country to go meet another leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come to make that come to me.</v>

1241
00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.750
<v Speaker 2>Come play golf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

1242
00:57:24.751 --> 00:57:28.060
<v Speaker 2>I got a great place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the best,</v>

1243
00:57:28.061 --> 00:57:31.150
<v Speaker 2>the best steaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best come back.</v>

1244
00:57:31.151 --> 00:57:33.790
<v Speaker 2>We really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We really do remember how weird that was</v>

1245
00:57:33.791 --> 00:57:38.791
<v Speaker 2>when even have all these props like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>steaks and the manila folders and all </v>

1246
00:57:38.791 --> 00:57:39.480
<v Speaker 2>these things like on the magazines and </v>
<v Speaker 2>jet.</v>

1247
00:57:39.481 --> 00:57:41.050
<v Speaker 2>He loved all these props,</v>
<v Speaker 2>number that.</v>

1248
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:46.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was doing all these campaign rallies </v>

1249
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.510
<v Speaker 2>on one one campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rally had a bunch of trump steaks out on</v>

1250
00:57:46.511 --> 00:57:47.050
<v Speaker 2>a table.</v>

1251
00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:52.870
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know trump steaks until </v>
<v Speaker 2>last week.</v>

1252
00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:56.920
<v Speaker 2>Was it moshe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moshe turned me on to trump steaks.</v>

1253
00:57:57.590 --> 00:58:02.590
<v Speaker 2>Moshe is a emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Casher was a show that's on comedy </v>

1254
00:58:02.590 --> 00:58:02.590
<v Speaker 2>central right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moshe is a super hardcore lefty.</v>

1255
00:58:02.890 --> 00:58:07.890
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting because he and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>were having this conversation on the </v>

1256
00:58:07.890 --> 00:58:07.890
<v Speaker 2>phone last night or texting back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>

1257
00:58:07.890 --> 00:58:08.590
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about.</v>

1258
00:58:08.591 --> 00:58:13.591
<v Speaker 2>He's at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He asked me to find like a suitable </v>

1259
00:58:13.591 --> 00:58:16.141
<v Speaker 2>representative of the alt right come on </v>
<v Speaker 2>his show and sort of talk about these </v>

1260
00:58:16.141 --> 00:58:17.050
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I my poor boy,</v>

1261
00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:22.030
<v Speaker 2>who the fuck is a suitable represent </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

1262
00:58:22.031 --> 00:58:24.940
<v Speaker 2>Through some people at adam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every name I threw out and he's like,</v>

1263
00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:28.090
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1264
00:58:28.091 --> 00:58:29.650
<v Speaker 2>but that's what you're asking for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1265
00:58:29.651 --> 00:58:31.780
<v Speaker 2>milo would have been great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's so tainted now.</v>

1266
00:58:31.781 --> 00:58:32.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1267
00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:35.290
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pedophilia is the thing that brought him</v>

1268
00:58:35.291 --> 00:58:39.250
<v Speaker 2>down and it was just crazy of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>places.</v>

1269
00:58:39.250 --> 00:58:39.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1270
00:58:39.731 --> 00:58:41.990
<v Speaker 2>They did lose three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got loose,</v>

1271
00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.840
<v Speaker 2>started talking about what your </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction.</v>

1272
00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Your reaction was really fun in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

1273
00:58:45.821 --> 00:58:47.620
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like.</v>

1274
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was trying to justify his own,</v>

1275
00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:53.320
<v Speaker 2>his own victimization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was molested as a child.</v>

1276
00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:55.480
<v Speaker 2>Was trying to turn around and say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>

1277
00:58:55.930 --> 00:58:57.210
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the predator.</v>

1278
00:58:57.910 --> 00:59:02.910
<v Speaker 2>Don't get it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's basically trying to empower </v>

1279
00:59:03.161 --> 00:59:08.161
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was fucked by a priest when he was </v>

1280
00:59:08.161 --> 00:59:08.590
<v Speaker 2>13.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is the reality of his life.</v>

1281
00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:13.980
<v Speaker 2>That is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's trying to figure out a way </v>

1282
00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:18.721
<v Speaker 2>where that empowers him and I just find </v>
<v Speaker 2>it interesting like the tommy lauren </v>

1283
00:59:18.721 --> 00:59:19.180
<v Speaker 2>thing was fired because she was pro </v>
<v Speaker 2>choice.</v>

1284
00:59:19.181 --> 00:59:21.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like that went too far for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>blaze.</v>

1285
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the pedophilia things too far for,</v>

1286
00:59:23.281 --> 00:59:24.390
<v Speaker 2>for the outright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1287
00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:25.910
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking that about hillary </v>
<v Speaker 2>clinton.</v>

1288
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:29.630
<v Speaker 2>How crazy would it be if chelsea clinton</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to work for the blaze?</v>

1289
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:31.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If she started,</v>

1290
00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:34.310
<v Speaker 2>she started going super hardcore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1291
00:59:34.311 --> 00:59:38.080
<v Speaker 2>And she's got two flags,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motorcycle jacket on,</v>

1292
00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.980
<v Speaker 2>pearly whites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hedges.</v>

1293
00:59:39.981 --> 00:59:41.690
<v Speaker 2>Go interrupt those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Antiwar demonstrations.</v>

1294
00:59:41.691 --> 00:59:42.500
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chelsea,</v>

1295
00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:46.730
<v Speaker 2>just like you used to be a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this,</v>

1296
00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:48.270
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about the Syria thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>though?</v>

1297
00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:51.140
<v Speaker 2>Trump within two days of the chemical </v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons attack,</v>

1298
00:59:51.141 --> 00:59:54.170
<v Speaker 2>he's already bombing assad and that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a big point of contention.</v>

1299
00:59:54.171 --> 00:59:56.690
<v Speaker 2>I know with the Alex Jones communiTy </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the alt right.</v>

1300
00:59:56.810 --> 01:00:01.810
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of them were anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention because that's what he was </v>

1301
01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:01.940
<v Speaker 2>saying and so what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think is going on?</v>

1302
01:00:01.941 --> 01:00:03.290
<v Speaker 2>Because you have that whole argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>where like,</v>

1303
01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:08.320
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these people are pulling them in </v>

1304
01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:08.320
<v Speaker 2>different directions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't really want to do this.</v>

1305
01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:08.320
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>

1306
01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's incredibly impulsive.</v>

1307
01:00:09.850 --> 01:00:12.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's sort of been established </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's very impulsive.</v>

1308
01:00:12.741 --> 01:00:17.741
<v Speaker 2>So I also think that he's got this </v>
<v Speaker 2>desire to be a strong leader and to be a</v>

1309
01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:22.070
<v Speaker 2>guy who make strong decisions and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to take any bullshit,</v>

1310
01:00:22.550 --> 01:00:24.410
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I worry about that.</v>

1311
01:00:24.411 --> 01:00:29.411
<v Speaker 2>That scares the shit out of me because </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you really find out how much the </v>

1312
01:00:29.411 --> 01:00:33.820
<v Speaker 2>power the president has in terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>launching a nuclear strike and then you </v>

1313
01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:36.170
<v Speaker 2>look at the conflict that we're getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>into with North Korea,</v>

1314
01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.330
<v Speaker 2>it's entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1315
01:00:38.331 --> 01:00:43.331
<v Speaker 2>they are moving nuclear submarines right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now as we speak off the coast of North </v>

1316
01:00:43.331 --> 01:00:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is happening right now as we speak.</v>

1317
01:00:45.291 --> 01:00:46.850
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were talking about it today.</v>

1318
01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:52.180
<v Speaker 2>It's in the news right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is terrifying because if they </v>

1319
01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:54.590
<v Speaker 2>decide to launch a warhead at North </v>
<v Speaker 2>Korea,</v>

1320
01:00:55.310 --> 01:01:00.310
<v Speaker 2>the odds of someone retaliating are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking high and if they do retaliate,</v>

1321
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:02.270
<v Speaker 2>it's probably going to be los angeles.</v>

1322
01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.250
<v Speaker 2>It's probably going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're the closest.</v>

1323
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:08.270
<v Speaker 2>We're the closest to North Korea and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're also the closest.</v>

1324
01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:11.120
<v Speaker 2>I guess we would be the target for </v>
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>

1325
01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:14.180
<v Speaker 2>I guess we would be the target for a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of places.</v>

1326
01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:19.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about this North Korea thing </v>

1327
01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:19.320
<v Speaker 2>really quickly because the media is </v>
<v Speaker 2>painting it like North Korea,</v>

1328
01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:23.870
<v Speaker 2>like we're going to strike back really </v>
<v Speaker 2>when North Korea is repeatedly said,</v>

1329
01:01:23.871 --> 01:01:28.871
<v Speaker 2>we will never striked the us ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will never strike anyone unless we're </v>

1330
01:01:28.871 --> 01:01:32.141
<v Speaker 2>attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they doing that we're so </v>

1331
01:01:32.141 --> 01:01:32.180
<v Speaker 2>intense with them right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are doing missile,</v>

1332
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:34.550
<v Speaker 2>missile tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't even work.</v>

1333
01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.130
<v Speaker 2>They tried to missile and it blew up </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1334
01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:42.160
<v Speaker 2>But that's how crazy the us has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we have historical amnesia where </v>

1335
01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.880
<v Speaker 2>americans don't know geography until we </v>
<v Speaker 2>bombed somewhere.</v>

1336
01:01:43.881 --> 01:01:48.881
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have completely no memory about </v>

1337
01:01:48.881 --> 01:01:51.191
<v Speaker 2>the korean war where theu ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>s military invaded North Korea and </v>

1338
01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.340
<v Speaker 2>bombed napalm the fuck out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country for three years.</v>

1339
01:01:55.341 --> 01:02:00.341
<v Speaker 2>Killed Twenty percent of the population </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed three to 5 million people left </v>

1340
01:02:00.341 --> 01:02:01.640
<v Speaker 2>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just completely forgot.</v>

1341
01:02:01.641 --> 01:02:04.160
<v Speaker 2>North koreans haven't forgotten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't forgotten.</v>

1342
01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:08.240
<v Speaker 2>They have a deep seated hatred for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>us for a good reason.</v>

1343
01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and americans have no idea.</v>

1344
01:02:09.801 --> 01:02:14.801
<v Speaker 2>We probably don't even know what that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to war with Korea that they don't </v>

1345
01:02:14.801 --> 01:02:15.830
<v Speaker 2>even think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is there a north and South Korea?</v>

1346
01:02:15.831 --> 01:02:17.870
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuCk is this?</v>

1347
01:02:17.871 --> 01:02:19.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so kim,</v>

1348
01:02:19.501 --> 01:02:20.310
<v Speaker 2>jon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uhm,</v>

1349
01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:24.780
<v Speaker 3>obviously probably what he's learned by </v>
<v Speaker 3>now in terms of us empire,</v>

1350
01:02:24.781 --> 01:02:28.290
<v Speaker 3>imperialism and interventions is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to not only act like,</v>

1351
01:02:28.291 --> 01:02:30.720
<v Speaker 3>you will use nukes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you have to have nukes and you have</v>

1352
01:02:30.721 --> 01:02:32.550
<v Speaker 3>to act like you will use them if you get</v>
<v Speaker 3>attacked,</v>

1353
01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:35.780
<v Speaker 3>unless you want to get invaded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look what happened with gaddafi,</v>

1354
01:02:35.790 --> 01:02:37.080
<v Speaker 3>saddam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these things.</v>

1355
01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:42.590
<v Speaker 3>Assad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you give up your chemical weapons and </v>

1356
01:02:42.590 --> 01:02:42.590
<v Speaker 3>then it doesn't matter.</v>

1357
01:02:42.590 --> 01:02:43.060
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1358
01:02:43.070 --> 01:02:48.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm terrified of this whole North Korea </v>

1359
01:02:48.070 --> 01:02:48.390
<v Speaker 4>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As I think everybody is.</v>

1360
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:53.430
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a terrifying place first of all </v>

1361
01:02:53.430 --> 01:02:55.431
<v Speaker 4>because it's one of the last really </v>
<v Speaker 4>obvious military dictatorships in this </v>

1362
01:02:55.431 --> 01:02:56.310
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the world rather.</v>

1363
01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:59.820
<v Speaker 4>There's not a whole lot of them left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's one of the last one since one</v>

1364
01:02:59.821 --> 01:03:02.090
<v Speaker 4>of the ones that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see it.</v>

1365
01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:05.250
<v Speaker 4>There are so extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They see them goosestepping walking down</v>

1366
01:03:05.251 --> 01:03:08.790
<v Speaker 4>the street.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see the people wailing in agony.</v>

1367
01:03:08.791 --> 01:03:10.920
<v Speaker 4>When kim jong il died,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's,</v>

1368
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:14.070
<v Speaker 4>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very strange world where people are born</v>

1369
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:17.160
<v Speaker 4>in prison and they live as prisoners </v>
<v Speaker 4>their whole life.</v>

1370
01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:22.161
<v Speaker 4>And some of them as escaped and detailed</v>
<v Speaker 4>the horrors of the prisons and what's </v>

1371
01:03:22.351 --> 01:03:25.800
<v Speaker 4>going on with that worries me is because</v>
<v Speaker 4>it won't be hard to sell.</v>

1372
01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:26.640
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1373
01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:29.250
<v Speaker 4>People already are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course in North Korea is horrible.</v>

1374
01:03:29.251 --> 01:03:31.260
<v Speaker 4>That prison camps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>labor camps is undeniable.</v>

1375
01:03:31.261 --> 01:03:32.040
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1376
01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:37.041
<v Speaker 4>I guess we should just do regime change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I was going to get to is </v>

1377
01:03:37.041 --> 01:03:37.470
<v Speaker 4>what you had said before the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 4>started,</v>

1378
01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:42.770
<v Speaker 4>that it's a massive reserve of minerals </v>
<v Speaker 4>in North Korea and this is what you and </v>

1379
01:03:42.991 --> 01:03:47.991
<v Speaker 4>I were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>conflict minerals and phones before the </v>

1380
01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:49.090
<v Speaker 4>podcast started and that they know that </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

<v Speaker 4>by the way also Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trillions of dollars of minute minerals </v>

<v Speaker 3>To be honest,</v>

1385
01:03:58.531 --> 01:04:01.660
<v Speaker 3>16 years later we dropped that mother of</v>

01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:06.310
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like he's trying to make up </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the fact that he lied about being in</v>

<v Speaker 4>trying really hard to make up for us.</v>

<v Speaker 4>And then fareed zakaria here they are </v>
<v Speaker 4>telling</v>

1416
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.890
<v Speaker 3>us that trump is mentally unfit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Puppet of Russia,</v>

1417
01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:24.660
<v Speaker 3>who's retarded yet the second he starts </v>
<v Speaker 3>bombing,</v>

1418
01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:25.180
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

01:05:25.181 --> 01:05:26.200
<v Speaker 3>love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First strike.</v>

01:05:26.201 --> 01:05:28.420
<v Speaker 3>Like he started bombing assad now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all love him.</v>

1421
01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:32.560
<v Speaker 3>Rachel maddow has been talking the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>30 days or three months,</v>

1422
01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:34.780
<v Speaker 3>six months about how he needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>impeached.</v>

1423
01:05:34.781 --> 01:05:37.300
<v Speaker 3>He's guided by putin and then the second</v>
<v Speaker 3>he started bombing Syria.</v>

1424
01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:42.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a commercial for tomahawk </v>

1425
01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:44.041
<v Speaker 3>missiles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rachel maddow did a 30 minute segment </v>

1426
01:05:44.041 --> 01:05:44.110
<v Speaker 3>just analyzing how efficient tomahawk </v>
<v Speaker 3>missiles are.</v>

1427
01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:45.490
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

1428
01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:46.630
<v Speaker 4>Why do you think she did that?</v>

1429
01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:52.420
<v Speaker 3>I think that the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bipartisan establishment </v>

1430
01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:53.690
<v Speaker 3>consensus on foreign policy and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>has been.</v>

1431
01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:56.270
<v Speaker 3>This is the empire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does the corporate media.</v>

1432
01:05:56.360 --> 01:06:00.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm completely loves the empire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love imperialism,</v>

1433
01:06:00.621 --> 01:06:03.410
<v Speaker 3>they love selling wars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have for a long time,</v>

1434
01:06:03.411 --> 01:06:04.700
<v Speaker 3>joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I became a journalist because</v>

1435
01:06:04.701 --> 01:06:09.701
<v Speaker 3>I saw the Iraq war been sold by quote </v>
<v Speaker 3>leftists are liberals on tv and I just </v>

1436
01:06:10.011 --> 01:06:13.040
<v Speaker 3>couldn't understand why they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>selling a completely insane,</v>

1437
01:06:13.041 --> 01:06:14.900
<v Speaker 3>unnecessarily illegal war where there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a lot of it.</v>

1438
01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:19.910
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were selling it or at least in </v>

1439
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:20.190
<v Speaker 4>support of it because we were really </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrified after nine slash 11,</v>

1440
01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:25.360
<v Speaker 4>so after nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was this movement to do something </v>

1441
01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:28.880
<v Speaker 4>and this massive amount of people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>ordinarily would have a lot of distrust </v>

1442
01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:34.160
<v Speaker 4>towards the right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all of a sudden we're trusting in </v>

1443
01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.770
<v Speaker 4>bush and trusting in the government to </v>
<v Speaker 4>go and out adequate job.</v>

1444
01:06:37.490 --> 01:06:39.680
<v Speaker 3>So it'd be a stenographer because you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>scared.</v>

1445
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:41.510
<v Speaker 3>That's like the time that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to step up and say,</v>

1446
01:06:41.511 --> 01:06:46.511
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to question my government's </v>

1447
01:06:46.511 --> 01:06:47.420
<v Speaker 3>claims because we're in such a state of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hysteria and acquiescence that I need to</v>

1448
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:52.750
<v Speaker 3>as a journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>QuesTion authority question my </v>

1449
01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:52.750
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the number one job that you have.</v>

1450
01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:54.050
<v Speaker 4>What was your thought?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How old will.</v>

1451
01:06:54.051 --> 01:06:55.250
<v Speaker 4>You're not old enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really?</v>

1452
01:06:55.251 --> 01:06:57.440
<v Speaker 4>How old were you at September 11th.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

1453
01:06:57.441 --> 01:06:58.400
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was 18,</v>

1454
01:06:58.401 --> 01:07:00.590
<v Speaker 4>so I was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did you have any.</v>

1455
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:03.290
<v Speaker 4>Obviously when you're 18 it's hard to </v>
<v Speaker 4>formulate.</v>

1456
01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:04.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1457
01:07:04.321 --> 01:07:07.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm my eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was stunned.</v>

1458
01:07:07.081 --> 01:07:10.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean I agreed with the Afghanistan war</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the time beCause I didn't really know</v>

1459
01:07:10.171 --> 01:07:15.171
<v Speaker 3>and then I went into college and learned</v>
<v Speaker 3>about what the fuck this government and </v>

1460
01:07:15.171 --> 01:07:16.320
<v Speaker 3>country has been doing to the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world and what militarism and empire</v>

1461
01:07:16.321 --> 01:07:18.450
<v Speaker 3>has been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I kind of put it together and then.</v>

1462
01:07:18.451 --> 01:07:23.451
<v Speaker 3>But that was just Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really woke up when one day my mom </v>

1463
01:07:23.451 --> 01:07:24.540
<v Speaker 3>called me and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did saddam bama us?</v>

1464
01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:30.140
<v Speaker 3>She said because every single media </v>
<v Speaker 3>outlet has just switched over from </v>

1465
01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:30.840
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan to Iraq unquestioningly.</v>

1466
01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:36.160
<v Speaker 4>So do you think that like rachel maddow </v>
<v Speaker 4>for me always seems like if there's </v>

1467
01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:40.421
<v Speaker 4>anybody that's not toeing the line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's that lesbian but it doesn't seem </v>

1468
01:07:40.701 --> 01:07:42.070
<v Speaker 4>like she would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

1469
01:07:42.370 --> 01:07:46.910
<v Speaker 4>she'd be like the perfect person to sell</v>
<v Speaker 4>you some shit that you know,</v>

1470
01:07:46.911 --> 01:07:50.840
<v Speaker 4>like you would never buy as a person on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the left because she's like,</v>

1471
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:55.130
<v Speaker 4>she's super articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's wicked sMart and she's obviously a</v>

1472
01:07:55.131 --> 01:07:58.550
<v Speaker 4>lesbian and she's got short hair and she</v>
<v Speaker 4>hated trump,</v>

1473
01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:02.060
<v Speaker 4>so like if you wanted to sell something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's your huckleberry</v>

1474
01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:04.670
<v Speaker 3>and she was trying to sell that Russia </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit real hard.</v>

1475
01:08:04.671 --> 01:08:09.671
<v Speaker 3>I mean she talked more about Russia than</v>
<v Speaker 3>any other issue and that's the Problem </v>

1476
01:08:09.671 --> 01:08:12.941
<v Speaker 3>with this so called resistance is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you focus on a fake issue like </v>

1477
01:08:12.941 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 3>Russia usurping trump's brain or like </v>
<v Speaker 3>and trump's and puppeting</v>

1478
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:18.050
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you forget about all the rapid fire</v>

1479
01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:23.051
<v Speaker 1>executive orders he's throwing down you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You aren't focusing on the real </v>

1480
01:08:23.051 --> 01:08:27.131
<v Speaker 1>important things that he's doing that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>could actually galvanize and stop and </v>

1481
01:08:27.131 --> 01:08:28.160
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're just pro war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these motherfuckers are,</v>

1482
01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:30.350
<v Speaker 1>they're funded by defense contractors in</v>
<v Speaker 1>banks.</v>

1483
01:08:30.351 --> 01:08:33.650
<v Speaker 1>That's what the corporate media is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the corporate media is.</v>

1484
01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:37.970
<v Speaker 1>She knows gone all in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been like a coup against Russia.</v>

1485
01:08:38.210 --> 01:08:40.610
<v Speaker 1>What's homeboy's name that used to be on</v>
<v Speaker 1>espn?</v>

1486
01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:41.600
<v Speaker 1>The fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

1487
01:08:41.601 --> 01:08:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Keith olbermann.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason you saw,</v>

1488
01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:48.380
<v Speaker 1>did you see the kermit the frog where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like covered in the american flag?</v>

1489
01:08:48.381 --> 01:08:50.800
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that crazy way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should look that way.</v>

1490
01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:55.900
<v Speaker 1>He's got a whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like he's in a basement </v>

1491
01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:57.420
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicer resistance.</v>

1492
01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Sponsored by gq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is going on with him?</v>

1493
01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:04.960
<v Speaker 1>does he have children?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the hell is going on </v>

1494
01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:04.960
<v Speaker 1>with the kids.</v>

1495
01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:05.600
<v Speaker 1>I used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to really,</v>

1496
01:09:05.601 --> 01:09:07.520
<v Speaker 1>really like him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychologically.</v>

1497
01:09:07.521 --> 01:09:12.521
<v Speaker 1>I used to as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to think that he had some </v>

1498
01:09:12.521 --> 01:09:14.531
<v Speaker 1>interesting rants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is too many people liked it </v>

1499
01:09:14.531 --> 01:09:16.610
<v Speaker 1>and then he like got drunk with it seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>like now he's,</v>

1500
01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.420
<v Speaker 1>he's his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his speeches are,</v>

1501
01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:23.780
<v Speaker 1>they're almost like a parody of a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who is.</v>

1502
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:28.870
<v Speaker 1>It's almost likE an old Christian Slater</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie about a guy who's got like some </v>

1503
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:33.041
<v Speaker 1>sort of a ham radio thing and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting against the oppressive </v>

1504
01:09:33.041 --> 01:09:33.230
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

1505
01:09:33.231 --> 01:09:35.120
<v Speaker 1>really hurt tuna fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1506
01:09:35.230 --> 01:09:37.830
<v Speaker 1>cartoonish is the right word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really weird.</v>

1507
01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:42.900
<v Speaker 1>I saw this one like side by side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meme of him draPed in the american flag </v>

1508
01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:43.280
<v Speaker 1>and he's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1509
01:09:43.281 --> 01:09:45.970
<v Speaker 1>on the cover of gq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then someone put kermit the frog,</v>

1510
01:09:45.980 --> 01:09:50.980
<v Speaker 1>like draped in a magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what keith olbermann thinks he </v>

1511
01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:50.980
<v Speaker 1>looks like and this is what he really </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like and it was just like a little</v>

1512
01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:52.730
<v Speaker 1>frog into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just nuts.</v>

1513
01:09:52.731 --> 01:09:54.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is this guy doing and how,</v>

1514
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:59.950
<v Speaker 1>what is gq doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>IT's like you have teen vogue somehow </v>

1515
01:09:59.950 --> 01:10:02.390
<v Speaker 1>leading the resistance and like what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck country.</v>

1516
01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:08.730
<v Speaker 1>His videos are so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so verBose and it's like,</v>

1517
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:09.670
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dude.</v>

1518
01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Is this a first draft?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1519
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.000
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you've got a lot of extra </v>

1520
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:17.000
<v Speaker 1>words in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could,</v>

1521
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:17.420
<v Speaker 1>you could trim that down a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and have a little more impact.</v>

1522
01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:22.720
<v Speaker 1>But I wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote this down because I wanted to </v>

1523
01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:23.020
<v Speaker 1>say this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is insane.</v>

1524
01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:25.010
<v Speaker 1>So the pentagon just came out with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>

1525
01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:30.940
<v Speaker 1>It said 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have been killed as a result of </v>

1526
01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:31.130
<v Speaker 1>bombing Syria in Iraq since 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1527
01:10:31.131 --> 01:10:32.330
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

1528
01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:34.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said they called the militants.</v>

1529
01:10:34.521 --> 01:10:37.370
<v Speaker 1>We already know that militant can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a military age males.</v>

1530
01:10:37.371 --> 01:10:41.530
<v Speaker 1>So really they include the libyan </v>
<v Speaker 1>militant feminist feminists.</v>

1531
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:43.810
<v Speaker 1>You can build short hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1532
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.140
<v Speaker 1>lesbian on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the ground and they think they were a</v>

1533
01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:51.141
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So They include like anyone who's </v>

1534
01:10:51.141 --> 01:10:52.100
<v Speaker 1>probably over the age of 10 and a male </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a militant.</v>

1535
01:10:52.101 --> 01:10:54.500
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these numbers are 70,000</v>

1536
01:10:54.501 --> 01:10:59.501
<v Speaker 1>people are killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they said only 229 civilians </v>

1537
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:02.120
<v Speaker 1>were killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 70,000</v>

1538
01:11:02.121 --> 01:11:04.370
<v Speaker 1>militants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>229 civilians.</v>

1539
01:11:04.371 --> 01:11:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Here's another interesting part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cia in 2014,</v>

1540
01:11:07.821 --> 01:11:10.490
<v Speaker 1>estimated that there are only between 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 40,000</v>

1541
01:11:10.491 --> 01:11:13.230
<v Speaker 1>isis fighters in Syria and Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So are The.</v>

1542
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:14.190
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sorry,</v>

1543
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:19.520
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck did these other 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people come from and did you kill all </v>

1544
01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:22.581
<v Speaker 2>isis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all isis has gone somehow their </v>

1545
01:11:22.581 --> 01:11:23.930
<v Speaker 2>back because they're still staring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What year was the estimate?</v>

1546
01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:27.270
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand 14 is when they said there </v>
<v Speaker 2>were probably 30 to 40,000</v>

1547
01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:30.820
<v Speaker 2>and then the pentagon just came out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is according to the la times 70,000</v>

1548
01:11:30.890 --> 01:11:34.020
<v Speaker 2>militants killed since 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only tWo hundred civilians.</v>

1549
01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:35.550
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1550
01:11:35.551 --> 01:11:39.240
<v Speaker 2>That makes me feel really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen one tear.</v>

1551
01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:42.540
<v Speaker 2>I feel pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just killing a bunch of terrorists.</v>

1552
01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:44.370
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>THat's nuts.</v>

1553
01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:45.870

<v Speaker 2>political system.</v>

1557

1563
01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:12.300

<v Speaker 2>like all about the potent character </v>

1564
01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:16.340

1568
01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.640
<v Speaker 2>She directs some of the best episodes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

1569

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1570
01:12:27.630 --> 01:12:29.070
<v Speaker 2>She directed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I watched last night,</v>

1571
01:12:29.071 --> 01:12:30.050
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jesus,</v>

1572
01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:34.370
<v Speaker 2>creepy camera angles and they remind me </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the clintons.</v>

1573
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:36.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1574
01:12:37.090 --> 01:12:38.710
<v Speaker 2>I thought it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it should be.</v>

1575
01:12:38.711 --> 01:12:41.190
<v Speaker 2>It should have been illegal for hillary </v>
<v Speaker 2>to even run.</v>

1576
01:12:41.310 --> 01:12:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I,</v>

1577
01:12:42.621 --> 01:12:45.090
<v Speaker 2>I look at them as a unit just like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>underwoods,</v>

1578
01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:50.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they work together where clinton </v>

1579
01:12:50.150 --> 01:12:52.071
<v Speaker 2>even admitted that hillary was the one </v>
<v Speaker 2>who sold the yugoslavia bombing and </v>

1580
01:12:52.071 --> 01:12:52.071
<v Speaker 2>stuff and she even said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was like,</v>

1581
01:12:52.071 --> 01:12:53.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm an appoint build to run the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like again,</v>

1582
01:12:54.850 --> 01:12:57.660
<v Speaker 2>destroyed the economy back in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties.</v>

1583
01:12:57.661 --> 01:13:01.230
<v Speaker 2>How is this legal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My favorite footage of her of all time,</v>

1584
01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:06.180
<v Speaker 2>where you really got to See behind the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wizard's curtain was when kadafi died.</v>

1585
01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:11.240
<v Speaker 2>That was sick when she was literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>back her head laughing,</v>

1586
01:13:11.431 --> 01:13:12.690
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we came,</v>

1587
01:13:12.691 --> 01:13:17.691
<v Speaker 2>we saw he died after he was raped by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bayonet from the rebels that we funded </v>

1588
01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:22.200
<v Speaker 2>and you could watch it like you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>see stabbed in the asshole.</v>

1589
01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:27.620
<v Speaker 2>You can watch him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could watch him terrified and he </v>

1590
01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:29.020
<v Speaker 2>doesn't even react.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so fucked up.</v>

1591
01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:32.460
<v Speaker 2>And then they're shooting them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>killing them.</v>

1592
01:13:32.461 --> 01:13:35.400
<v Speaker 2>They tried them around his dead body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucked up.</v>

1593
01:13:35.401 --> 01:13:38.790
<v Speaker 2>But watching that guy shoved that band </v>
<v Speaker 2>at up to up his ass.</v>

1594
01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:39.780
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1595
01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.460
<v Speaker 2>And what was the premIse of the Libya </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing?</v>

1596
01:13:41.461 --> 01:13:46.461

<v Speaker 2>I don't like to smoke anymore.</v>

1641
01:15:53.051 --> 01:15:55.120
<v Speaker 2>It's just terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hard to quit,</v>

1642
01:15:55.121 --> 01:16:00.121
<v Speaker 2>but I'm glad it did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We land and he immediately walks right </v>

1643
01:16:00.121 --> 01:16:01.780
<v Speaker 2>into a gift shop or buy cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I changed my mind.</v>

1644
01:16:01.781 --> 01:16:05.410
<v Speaker 2>I want to start smoking again and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>lighting before he gets out the door,</v>

1645
01:16:05.411 --> 01:16:09.460
<v Speaker 2>but he's so impulsive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like walking towards doing.</v>

1646
01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:10.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I guess I smoke again.</v>

1650
01:16:17.470 --> 01:16:20.530
<v Speaker 2>There's people out there that are like </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretending to be wacky.</v>

1651
01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:22.180
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>themselves like no matter what,</v>

1654
01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:30.580
<v Speaker 2>just that's who norman is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's great and he's so funny.</v>

1655
01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.530
<v Speaker 2>David cross's new specials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really good.</v>

1656
01:16:32.531 --> 01:16:33.250
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not new.</v>

1657
01:16:33.251 --> 01:16:36.730
<v Speaker 2>It was before trump got elected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's hysterical.</v>

1658
01:16:36.731 --> 01:16:40.630
<v Speaker 2>His stuff on gun control is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really funny and he's doing it to like a</v>

1659
01:16:40.631 --> 01:16:45.631
<v Speaker 2>houston audience where it's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump supporters and he just goes balls </v>

1660
01:16:45.631 --> 01:16:45.631
<v Speaker 2>to the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everyone's walking out.</v>

1661
01:16:45.631 --> 01:16:47.170
<v Speaker 2>Really just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1662
01:16:47.230 --> 01:16:52.230
<v Speaker 2>it's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Houston is a strange place because it's </v>

1663
01:16:52.230 --> 01:16:52.230
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of liberals in houston,</v>

1664
01:16:52.230 --> 01:16:55.470
<v Speaker 2>a lot more than houston is way more </v>
<v Speaker 2>diversified than it gets credit for.</v>

1665
01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:58.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a very interesting city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very interesting.</v>

1666
01:16:58.661 --> 01:17:00.210
<v Speaker 2>I feel like dallas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>austin,</v>

1667
01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:05.920
<v Speaker 2>austin is the super lefty part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the most lefty part of Texas,</v>

1668
01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:09.260
<v Speaker 2>but houston is way more cut down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle.</v>

1669
01:17:09.261 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like it's a</v>

1670
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:14.510
<v Speaker 4>split of austin and dallas and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got the cool.</v>

1671
01:17:14.890 --> 01:17:15.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1672
01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:19.430
<v Speaker 4>I love houston.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got austin left dallas pretty right,</v>

1673
01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:24.670
<v Speaker 4>and then you've got houston,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like a combo plate bit.</v>

1674
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:26.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you have any.</v>

1675
01:17:26.031 --> 01:17:31.031
<v Speaker 4>Trump will get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People fucking attacked him and I made </v>

1676
01:17:31.031 --> 01:17:32.620
<v Speaker 4>videos of people getting attacked for </v>
<v Speaker 4>st.</v>

1677
01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:35.600
<v Speaker 4>How are you not making fun of trump?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's Donald Trump.</v>

1678
01:17:36.170 --> 01:17:37.010
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll get it.</v>

1679
01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:39.710
<v Speaker 4>They'll get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eventually it will take a little time.</v>

1680
01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:42.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean when there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Snowflakes.</v>

1681
01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:47.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way this is going to keep </v>

1682
01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:47.310
<v Speaker 4>going and be good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just.</v>

1683
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:49.310
<v Speaker 4>I really think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is what I think,</v>

1684
01:17:49.311 --> 01:17:54.311
<v Speaker 4>and I don't think this is necessarily a </v>
<v Speaker 4>reflection of who Donald Trump is or I </v>

1685
01:17:54.311 --> 01:17:57.530
<v Speaker 4>just think the idea of a president is </v>
<v Speaker 4>preposterous.</v>

1686
01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:02.860
<v Speaker 4>The idea of one person that has that </v>
<v Speaker 4>much power over hundreds of millions of </v>

1687
01:18:03.381 --> 01:18:04.700
<v Speaker 4>people is insane.</v>

1688
01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:10.060
<v Speaker 4>It's an idea that was created back when </v>
<v Speaker 4>people rode horses and roping with </v>

1689
01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:10.550
<v Speaker 4>feathers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They used to.</v>

1690
01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:12.380
<v Speaker 4>They used to fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1691
01:18:12.381 --> 01:18:13.690
<v Speaker 4>that's really what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1692
01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:18.700
<v Speaker 4>the whole representative government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a representative government </v>

1693
01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:21.561
<v Speaker 4>because some people lived in North </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dakota and how the fuck would you get </v>

1694
01:18:21.561 --> 01:18:21.561
<v Speaker 4>worried to Washington?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1695
01:18:21.561 --> 01:18:21.680
<v Speaker 4>you had to have somebody talking for </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1696
01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:23.450
<v Speaker 4>Well now you can send an email.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You fuck.</v>

1697
01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:26.240
<v Speaker 4>You could vote online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea is antiquated.</v>

1698
01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:30.920
<v Speaker 4>It's so behind the times and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>behind the times to have one person have</v>

1699
01:18:30.921 --> 01:18:35.921
<v Speaker 4>any sort of massive power and also I </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel like the government works very hard</v>

1700
01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:42.671
<v Speaker 4>to stop monopolies in certain sectors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why don't they work so hard to stop it </v>

1701
01:18:42.671 --> 01:18:45.260
<v Speaker 4>in government because this left versus </v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1702
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:48.560
<v Speaker 4>This republican versus democrat thing is</v>
<v Speaker 4>a goddamn ruse.</v>

1703
01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:51.380
<v Speaker 4>Appropriations police themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great question.</v>

1704
01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.210
<v Speaker 4>It's people.</v>

1705
01:18:52.210 --> 01:18:55.400
<v Speaker 4>It's like I think scholars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>educators,</v>

1706
01:18:55.460 --> 01:19:00.460
<v Speaker 4>people who actually understand the </v>
<v Speaker 4>consequences of these ideological </v>

1707
01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:02.330
<v Speaker 4>structures that were trapped in these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

1708
01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:07.360
<v Speaker 4>these are structures left versus right </v>
<v Speaker 4>as a structure because they provide you </v>

1709
01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:12.131
<v Speaker 4>with a predetermined pattern or behavior</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you adopt and there's many,</v>

1710
01:19:12.201 --> 01:19:15.910
<v Speaker 4>many easily influenced people that go </v>
<v Speaker 4>super hardcore,</v>

1711
01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:20.920
<v Speaker 4>right or super hardcore left because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they want social brownie points within </v>

1712
01:19:21.201 --> 01:19:24.160
<v Speaker 4>the structure and that's a natural part </v>
<v Speaker 4>of being a human.</v>

1713
01:19:24.170 --> 01:19:28.820
<v Speaker 4>It's a natural part of tribal behavior </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it has to be addressed and it has to</v>

1714
01:19:28.821 --> 01:19:33.821
<v Speaker 4>be addressed openly and it has to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>addressed from a an understanding of </v>

1715
01:19:33.821 --> 01:19:38.351
<v Speaker 4>fundamental understanding about a way </v>
<v Speaker 4>the human mind works and the way the </v>

1716
01:19:38.351 --> 01:19:40.790
<v Speaker 4>human psychology works and our need for </v>
<v Speaker 4>social acceptance works.</v>

1717
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:46.030
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of the way we behave </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just based on and predicated on </v>

1718
01:19:46.030 --> 01:19:48.620
<v Speaker 4>these really simple,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obvious principles that everybody knows.</v>

1719
01:19:48.621 --> 01:19:51.350
<v Speaker 4>Peer pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the desire to be loved.</v>

1720
01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:56.380
<v Speaker 4>Those things all play a massive part in </v>
<v Speaker 4>how you're manipulated and how you </v>

1721
01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:59.600
<v Speaker 4>manipulate yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You convince yourself of certain things.</v>

1722
01:19:59.601 --> 01:20:03.470
<v Speaker 4>I really firmly believe that when you go</v>
<v Speaker 4>super hard,</v>

1723
01:20:03.471 --> 01:20:08.471
<v Speaker 4>right and super hard left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the distance between these two is not </v>

1724
01:20:08.471 --> 01:20:08.471
<v Speaker 4>nearly</v>

1725
01:20:08.471 --> 01:20:13.020
<v Speaker 2>as far as you think and that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological point of views than the what</v>

1726
01:20:13.021 --> 01:20:16.440
<v Speaker 2>they want and what they're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplish is very different,</v>

1727
01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:21.680
<v Speaker 2>but the way they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they've locked themselves into </v>

1728
01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:25.680
<v Speaker 2>these predetermined thought patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not much different.</v>

1729
01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:30.920
<v Speaker 2>They're just were indoctrinated one way </v>
<v Speaker 2>or indoctrinated or another way they </v>

1730
01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:33.210
<v Speaker 2>might have gone through the church </v>
<v Speaker 2>system or they might've gone through the</v>

1731
01:20:33.211 --> 01:20:38.211
<v Speaker 2>university system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've sort of both taken these </v>

1732
01:20:38.211 --> 01:20:41.721
<v Speaker 2>hard line stances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the reality of the world and </v>

1733
01:20:41.721 --> 01:20:45.531
<v Speaker 2>have most reasonable people is there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of weirdness and there's a lot of </v>

1734
01:20:46.170 --> 01:20:49.260
<v Speaker 2>variables to be considered in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people are not hard.</v>

1735
01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:54.261
<v Speaker 2>Right and most people are not hard left </v>
<v Speaker 2>theirs and you have to take one or the </v>

1736
01:20:54.261 --> 01:20:58.701
<v Speaker 2>other and it's really the best way is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a gigantic group that gets to </v>

1737
01:21:02.071 --> 01:21:05.400
<v Speaker 2>decide on all sorts of different things </v>
<v Speaker 2>and many,</v>

1738
01:21:05.401 --> 01:21:07.120
<v Speaker 2>many different parties to choose from.</v>

1739
01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:12.120
<v Speaker 2>Like I think holland has something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't they have like 16 different </v>

1740
01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:16.461
<v Speaker 2>political parties or something that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have this two party dictatorship and I </v>

1741
01:21:16.461 --> 01:21:18.420
<v Speaker 2>was reading this quote from chris hedges</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really says it all.</v>

1742
01:21:18.421 --> 01:21:20.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like exactly what you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1743
01:21:20.731 --> 01:21:25.731
<v Speaker 2>You have conservatives across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country who are worried about abortion </v>

1744
01:21:25.731 --> 01:21:30.351
<v Speaker 2>and obsessing about these issues and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have the liberals in New York </v>

1745
01:21:30.351 --> 01:21:30.351
<v Speaker 2>who are obsessing about creationism in </v>
<v Speaker 2>schools.</v>

1746
01:21:30.351 --> 01:21:32.180
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goldman sachs continues to fucking win.</v>

1747
01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:37.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter what you guys are </v>

1748
01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:37.280
<v Speaker 2>squabbling about on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>

1749
01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:37.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Liberal,</v>

1750
01:21:37.861 --> 01:21:42.861
<v Speaker 2>conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like these people are in power and </v>

1751
01:21:42.861 --> 01:21:42.861
<v Speaker 2>they're going to further entrench their </v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

1752
01:21:42.861 --> 01:21:44.740
<v Speaker 2>We're all the losers here and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1753
01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:49.760
<v Speaker 2>like you were just saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean why do we have a system that </v>

1754
01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:50.220
<v Speaker 2>props up these two parties that going </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to the corporate media,</v>

1755
01:21:50.250 --> 01:21:55.250
<v Speaker 2>continues to sell war after war </v>
<v Speaker 2>continues to just sell off our </v>

1756
01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:55.770
<v Speaker 2>government to corporations.</v>

1757
01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:59.540
<v Speaker 2>It's just the matter of which they do so</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1758
01:21:59.550 --> 01:22:04.550
<v Speaker 2>Control of groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anytime you have one person or one </v>

1759
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:06.360
<v Speaker 2>organization that has control over a </v>
<v Speaker 2>group,</v>

1760
01:22:06.361 --> 01:22:08.490
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a dictatorship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a government,</v>

1761
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.880
<v Speaker 2>so like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is a government for?</v>

1762
01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:16.940
<v Speaker 2>is it to control groups of people or is </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to provide people with services like </v>

1763
01:22:17.221 --> 01:22:22.221
<v Speaker 2>schools and utilities and infrastructure</v>
<v Speaker 2>that should be like really what it is </v>

1764
01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:26.640
<v Speaker 2>and the idea that war is an extra bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an extra bowl.</v>

1765
01:22:26.641 --> 01:22:28.840
<v Speaker 2>You can't remove it from our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot.</v>

1766
01:22:28.841 --> 01:22:33.841
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you ask people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you envision a time in your life or </v>

1767
01:22:33.841 --> 01:22:34.020
<v Speaker 2>war doesn't exist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one says yes,</v>

1768
01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:37.350
<v Speaker 2>but yet sad is it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1769
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:39.990
<v Speaker 2>We just live in a war economy or that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just a necessity.</v>

1770
01:22:39.991 --> 01:22:40.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1771
01:22:40.321 --> 01:22:42.140
<v Speaker 2>we have to have just endless war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1772
01:22:42.150 --> 01:22:42.810
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

1773
01:22:42.810 --> 01:22:47.610
<v Speaker 2>Is that the disconnection between human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings based on financial,</v>

1774
01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:50.610
<v Speaker 2>financial situations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on language,</v>

1775
01:22:50.611 --> 01:22:52.200
<v Speaker 2>based on culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on religion,</v>

1776
01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:57.500
<v Speaker 2>like all these differences are so vast </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have to launch bombs out of </v>

1777
01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:01.131
<v Speaker 2>planes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's an indoctrination of </v>

1778
01:23:01.131 --> 01:23:03.651
<v Speaker 2>american exceptionalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back to the historical amnesia </v>

1779
01:23:03.651 --> 01:23:03.780
<v Speaker 2>about what this government has done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rest of the world hasn't forgotten.</v>

1780
01:23:03.781 --> 01:23:08.560
<v Speaker 2>The rest of the world is very acutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of what the empire does on a daily</v>

1781
01:23:08.561 --> 01:23:10.180
<v Speaker 2>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea.</v>

1782
01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's every country.</v>

1783
01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:16.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's every country with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>military tries to enforce that military </v>

1784
01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.520
<v Speaker 2>in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shape or form on other countries.</v>

1785
01:23:18.610 --> 01:23:23.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gone on since the beginning of time</v>

1786
01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:28.440
<v Speaker 2>as far as people getting together in </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups and then going over and </v>

1787
01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:28.810
<v Speaker 2>conquering other people that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources.</v>

1788
01:23:28.850 --> 01:23:29.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people would say it's the,</v>

1789
01:23:29.951 --> 01:23:34.951
<v Speaker 2>it's the system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the economic system that once you </v>

1790
01:23:34.951 --> 01:23:38.460
<v Speaker 2>control one area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to move capital and it and </v>

1791
01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:38.500
<v Speaker 2>extract capital from other areas through</v>
<v Speaker 2>force,</v>

1792
01:23:38.501 --> 01:23:43.501
<v Speaker 2>through military force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the extension of imperialism </v>

1793
01:23:43.501 --> 01:23:43.501
<v Speaker 2>through capitalism.</v>

1794
01:23:43.501 --> 01:23:44.470
<v Speaker 2>And then so you just go and now we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest,</v>

1795
01:23:44.471 --> 01:23:49.090
<v Speaker 2>most powerful empire controlling the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire world and we have to go after the</v>

1796
01:23:49.091 --> 01:23:53.890
<v Speaker 2>last remaining sovereign quote unquote </v>
<v Speaker 2>sovereign states to completely control.</v>

1797
01:23:53.891 --> 01:23:54.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1798
01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:59.760
<v Speaker 2>other countries have done that before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but never on the level of what we're </v>

1799
01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:03.151
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we could just get everybody to speak </v>

1800
01:24:03.151 --> 01:24:03.151
<v Speaker 2>english and everybody to listen to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will be fine.</v>

1801
01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:08.700
<v Speaker 2>We need to do is wipe out all the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultures when you use a wipe wipe out </v>

1802
01:24:08.951 --> 01:24:11.640
<v Speaker 2>all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need cultural marxism.</v>

1803
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:15.040
<v Speaker 2>We just need a dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A one trump world.</v>

1804
01:24:15.370 --> 01:24:17.170
<v Speaker 2>I was going to ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel about the.</v>

1805
01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:22.260
<v Speaker 2>I feel like the level of discourse has </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten to the point back to the </v>

1806
01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:22.690
<v Speaker 2>reactionary thing someone was telling me</v>
<v Speaker 2>this last night,</v>

1807
01:24:22.810 --> 01:24:26.090
<v Speaker 2>that the word responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you know,</v>

1808
01:24:26.290 --> 01:24:31.290
<v Speaker 2>your ability to respond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to understand a situation </v>

1809
01:24:31.290 --> 01:24:34.951
<v Speaker 2>responded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just react and I feel like so much </v>

1810
01:24:34.951 --> 01:24:36.110
<v Speaker 2>of our culture is just reacting to news </v>
<v Speaker 2>without even understanding what the hell</v>

1811
01:24:36.111 --> 01:24:36.730
<v Speaker 2>is going on.</v>

1812
01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:41.730
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the twitter universe where it's just </v>

1813
01:24:41.730 --> 01:24:41.730
<v Speaker 2>like you'd see something and you react </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what?</v>

1814
01:24:41.730 --> 01:24:46.690
<v Speaker 2>What does that do to critical thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that do to discourse when you </v>

1815
01:24:46.690 --> 01:24:50.260
<v Speaker 2>do not understand issues or have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to respond that responsibility?</v>

1816
01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>

1817
01:24:51.181 --> 01:24:54.400
<v Speaker 2>you be aged and dated by so much data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at something,</v>

1818
01:24:54.401 --> 01:24:56.350
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at a headline really </v>
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>

1819
01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:01.060
<v Speaker 2>So many people have no idea what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>article even says like we did like I did</v>

1937
01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:47.010

<v Speaker 6>they finally bring back the cost.</v>

<v Speaker 6>It's.</v>

1939
01:30:49.690 --> 01:30:53.080

<v Speaker 6>So you know what's fucked up.</v>

1946
01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:14.490
<v Speaker 6>They like the old school man alien from </v>
<v Speaker 6>the original one.</v>

1947
01:31:14.580 --> 01:31:19.580
<v Speaker 6>The computers looked so clunky.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know what they thought were going to </v>

1948
01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:21.120

01:31:28.291 --> 01:31:33.291
<v Speaker 6>I've never seen him play a serious role.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just looks so bad.</v>

1953
01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:35.610
<v Speaker 6>This is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1954
01:31:35.611 --> 01:31:40.611
<v Speaker 6>I don't know where they filmed it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They filmed a lot of shit in New </v>

1955
01:31:40.611 --> 01:31:41.220
<v Speaker 6>Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's where they did the hobbit.</v>

1956
01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:43.740
<v Speaker 6>New Zealand is one place that I really </v>
<v Speaker 6>need to go.</v>

1957
01:31:44.370 --> 01:31:48.230
<v Speaker 6>I keep hearing how amazing it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but yeah,</v>

1958
01:31:48.250 --> 01:31:53.250
<v Speaker 6>this looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No burns,</v>

1959
01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:57.900
<v Speaker 6>no animals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like Iceland bitch.</v>

1960
01:31:57.901 --> 01:31:59.900
<v Speaker 6>That's Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1961
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:05.070
<v Speaker 6>Don't be so fucking willing to see </v>
<v Speaker 6>animals on the planet where you don't </v>

1962
01:32:05.070 --> 01:32:07.410
<v Speaker 6>know what can eat shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Damn.</v>

1963
01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:09.190
<v Speaker 6>Shit's food.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is so cool.</v>

1964
01:32:09.191 --> 01:32:14.191
<v Speaker 6>So it's like an a planet where the </v>
<v Speaker 6>aliens are populated planet team of </v>

1965
01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:19.150
<v Speaker 6>people that are going to go save human </v>
<v Speaker 6>or something like that.</v>

1966
01:32:19.330 --> 01:32:21.370
<v Speaker 6>Imagine you get paid to repopulate a </v>
<v Speaker 6>planet.</v>

1967
01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:24.520
<v Speaker 6>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have to fuck to fuck for the future.</v>

1968
01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:27.720
<v Speaker 6>They don't know good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't get too close to it.</v>

1969
01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:33.060
<v Speaker 6>Have you not seen these motherfuckers?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I haven't seen nothing,</v>

1970
01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:40.860
<v Speaker 6>but I just love when they do a movie </v>
<v Speaker 6>like this and now they have these modern</v>

1971
01:32:41.441 --> 01:32:42.730
<v Speaker 6>special effects.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Totally.</v>

1972
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:48.000
<v Speaker 6>But they abused those things sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One of the coolest things about the </v>

1973
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:49.300
<v Speaker 6>original alien was you saw very little </v>
<v Speaker 6>of it.</v>

1974
01:32:49.301 --> 01:32:54.301
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the problem with all movies and </v>

1975
01:32:54.301 --> 01:32:55.300
<v Speaker 6>tv now is you just see way too much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no buildup.</v>

1976
01:32:56.310 --> 01:33:01.310
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's also a real fear comes from the </v>

1977
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:01.310
<v Speaker 6>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

1978
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:05.730
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and glimpses like american werewolf in </v>

1979
01:33:05.730 --> 01:33:08.611
<v Speaker 6>london.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You only saw like a couple of titling </v>

1980
01:33:08.611 --> 01:33:08.611
<v Speaker 6>flashes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Totally.</v>

1981
01:33:08.611 --> 01:33:12.420
<v Speaker 6>And it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whereas Stephen King movie called the </v>

1982
01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:12.730
<v Speaker 6>laying of layers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was.</v>

1983
01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:18.340
<v Speaker 6>I was so terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't remember the last time I was </v>

1984
01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:18.560
<v Speaker 6>watching a movie that I was so scared </v>
<v Speaker 6>and terrified.</v>

1985
01:33:18.561 --> 01:33:21.080
<v Speaker 6>And then at the very end,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cgi like must've just come out.</v>

1986
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:24.980
<v Speaker 6>They show that lear and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it looks just like this.</v>

1987
01:33:24.981 --> 01:33:29.981
<v Speaker 6>It's like a black spot on the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on the screen here is the alien.</v>

1988
01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:32.330
<v Speaker 6>The book is great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1989
01:33:32.331 --> 01:33:37.331
<v Speaker 6>it's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Show what the actual can see the little </v>

1990
01:33:37.331 --> 01:33:38.080
<v Speaker 6>guys up there and go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

1991
01:33:38.730 --> 01:33:40.580
<v Speaker 6>that's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's so stupid.</v>

1992
01:33:40.610 --> 01:33:44.130
<v Speaker 6>That's sad and it was creepy.</v>

1993
01:33:46.370 --> 01:33:51.370
<v Speaker 6>You get killed by.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look at it is that they really fly </v>

1994
01:33:51.370 --> 01:33:54.050
<v Speaker 6>because he can't be real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is real real?</v>

1995
01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:59.080
<v Speaker 6>Was that a made for tv movie though?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's probably why I didn't have any </v>

1996
01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:02.231
<v Speaker 6>money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And plus people that watch tv they feel </v>

1997
01:34:02.231 --> 01:34:04.061
<v Speaker 6>like are still would have been better to</v>
<v Speaker 6>have just like little puppets on a </v>

1998
01:34:04.061 --> 01:34:04.061
<v Speaker 6>string though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that would suck.</v>

1999
01:34:04.061 --> 01:34:06.350
<v Speaker 6>Like if minions really killed you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like from despicable me.</v>

2000
01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:11.400
<v Speaker 6>I felt the most like forced cultural </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing I've ever seen the minion ad </v>

2001
01:34:11.541 --> 01:34:13.250
<v Speaker 6>campaign here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's because you don't have kids.</v>

2002
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:17.010
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't really popular kids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was my kids love that.</v>

2003
01:34:17.011 --> 01:34:18.200
<v Speaker 6>it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They love it.</v>

2004
01:34:18.201 --> 01:34:20.630
<v Speaker 6>I thought it was just some weird forced </v>
<v Speaker 6>on adults thing.</v>

2005
01:34:20.631 --> 01:34:25.550
<v Speaker 6>Like you're going to love minions shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I fucking love.</v>

2006
01:34:25.610 --> 01:34:27.730
<v Speaker 6>And then like you get it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh that's right.</v>

2007
01:34:27.770 --> 01:34:29.600

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2009
01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:33.730
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You haven't seen it.</v>

2010
01:34:33.890 --> 01:34:38.890
<v Speaker 6>I just tried to watch it and it was like</v>
<v Speaker 6>I as six hours hours artists and artists</v>

2011

<v Speaker 6>but the new one day they've shown it.</v>

2012
01:34:42.531 --> 01:34:46.180
<v Speaker 6>It looks way creepier.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It used to be to look creepier than used</v>

2013
01:34:46.181 --> 01:34:48.170
<v Speaker 6>to be the picture show guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2014
01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:49.220

<v Speaker 6>So that is that guy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Tim curry was the original it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was the original clown.</v>

2026
01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:26.900
<v Speaker 4>That's another great book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2027
01:35:26.901 --> 01:35:31.760
<v Speaker 4>I feel like stephen king's movies all </v>
<v Speaker 4>suck bad ones for sure.</v>

2028
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:33.380
<v Speaker 4>Not that they suck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love Stephen King,</v>

2029
01:35:33.390 --> 01:35:38.300
<v Speaker 4>but his books are so good that the books</v>
<v Speaker 4>just don't.</v>

2030
01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:41.720
<v Speaker 4>You just can't turn it into a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>

2031
01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:46.040
<v Speaker 4>like pet cemetery was so god damn creepy</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a book.</v>

2032
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:48.020
<v Speaker 4>And then you see the movie like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2033
01:35:48.021 --> 01:35:49.810
<v Speaker 4>the cat's going to kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll fucking kill that cat.</v>

2034
01:35:49.811 --> 01:35:52.130
<v Speaker 4>Let me get ahold of that care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's a demon.</v>

2035
01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:53.930
<v Speaker 4>Katelyn grabbed by stupid little head.</v>

2036
01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:56.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm really excited for dark tower are </v>
<v Speaker 4>both steven.</v>

2037
01:35:57.800 --> 01:35:59.160
<v Speaker 4>Oh cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But stand by.</v>

2038
01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:04.240
<v Speaker 4>We're not superstitious or supernatural </v>
<v Speaker 4>force or I think when he green mile as </v>

2039
01:36:06.621 --> 01:36:11.621
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was like a little bit of </v>

2040
01:36:11.621 --> 01:36:11.621
<v Speaker 4>supernatural share with Michael Clarke </v>
<v Speaker 4>duncan,</v>

2041
01:36:11.621 --> 01:36:15.310
<v Speaker 4>but the thing is like when you turn his </v>
<v Speaker 4>movies into something that you have to </v>

2042
01:36:15.310 --> 01:36:15.530
<v Speaker 4>look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like christine,</v>

2043
01:36:15.531 --> 01:36:18.270
<v Speaker 4>they kind of pulled augustine as just </v>
<v Speaker 4>the car,</v>

2044
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:22.370
<v Speaker 4>but it was even creepier in the book and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you get more,</v>

2045
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:27.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get more insight into the guy who </v>

2046
01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:27.430
<v Speaker 4>created the car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was sold him the car.</v>

2047
01:36:27.570 --> 01:36:32.570
<v Speaker 4>Super descriptive with his language and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it really paints a picture that you can </v>

2048
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:33.350
<v Speaker 4>never do justice when you're watching </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2049
01:36:33.351 --> 01:36:38.351
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm excited for the dark tower series </v>

2050
01:36:38.351 --> 01:36:40.001
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but do you know that the shining was </v>

2051
01:36:40.001 --> 01:36:40.001
<v Speaker 4>very different than the book?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read the book.</v>

2052
01:36:40.110 --> 01:36:45.110
<v Speaker 4>The book's very different and he redid </v>
<v Speaker 4>the movie with his blessing and they use</v>

2053
01:36:45.591 --> 01:36:49.040
<v Speaker 4>the guy from wings that a made for tv.</v>

2054
01:36:49.430 --> 01:36:50.790
<v Speaker 4>She was In it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think tears.</v>

2055
01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:55.840
<v Speaker 4>The bartender didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but kubrick kubrick had a lot of weird </v>

2056
01:36:55.840 --> 01:37:00.311
<v Speaker 4>shit in the shining,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's a lot of references to the </v>

2057
01:37:00.311 --> 01:37:02.591
<v Speaker 4>apollo moon landings as long as hidden </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit in there hook story that said that </v>

2058
01:37:03.231 --> 01:37:06.080
<v Speaker 4>he had like proven that the moon landing</v>
<v Speaker 4>was false or whatever.</v>

2059
01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:10.880
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he definitely did a bunch of shit in the</v>

2060
01:37:10.881 --> 01:37:15.530
<v Speaker 4>shining to pay homage to the apollo moon</v>
<v Speaker 4>missions and some sort of a weird way.</v>

2061
01:37:15.770 --> 01:37:18.560
<v Speaker 4>Like there was a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget,</v>

2062
01:37:18.561 --> 01:37:20.150
<v Speaker 4>there was a bunch of different things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that were there.</v>

2063
01:37:20.151 --> 01:37:22.790
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the little boy wore a rocket.</v>

2064
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:28.030
<v Speaker 4>He wore look at apollo rocket sweater </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then there was the number for one of</v>

2065
01:37:28.911 --> 01:37:33.911
<v Speaker 4>the rooms that was the exact distance </v>
<v Speaker 4>between the earth and the moon and </v>

2066
01:37:33.911 --> 01:37:36.380
<v Speaker 4>there's a whole documentary that goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>over in depth.</v>

2067
01:37:36.381 --> 01:37:41.381
<v Speaker 4>The connections that kubrick made </v>
<v Speaker 4>between the shining and the apollo moon </v>

2068
01:37:41.381 --> 01:37:41.381
<v Speaker 4>missions.</v>

2069
01:37:41.381 --> 01:37:42.950
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking pretty intense stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>

2070
01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:44.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was just a.</v>

2071
01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:47.240
<v Speaker 4>It was a different book though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The book,</v>

2072
01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:50.390
<v Speaker 4>the book was a slow build before </v>
<v Speaker 4>jackets.</v>

2073
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:54.260
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then in the movie Jack Nicholson was</v>

2074
01:37:54.261 --> 01:37:59.261
<v Speaker 4>like crazy already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like a little crazy and then it </v>

2075
01:37:59.261 --> 01:38:03.471
<v Speaker 4>just got crazy and crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas in the book he like slowly </v>

2076
01:38:03.471 --> 01:38:07.791
<v Speaker 4>became more and more nutty and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>bought into it like you saw him like </v>

2077
01:38:07.791 --> 01:38:12.261
<v Speaker 4>getting taken by this crazy hotel and so</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't like cooper x interpretation </v>

2078
01:38:13.591 --> 01:38:14.190
<v Speaker 4>and that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2079
01:38:14.191 --> 01:38:16.830
<v Speaker 4>he didn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he didn't like that apparently.</v>

2080
01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:21.540
<v Speaker 4>Which is too bad because it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just can't make a book into a movie,</v>

2081
01:38:21.850 --> 01:38:22.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he,</v>

2082
01:38:23.010 --> 01:38:25.530
<v Speaker 4>I guess he can but they're just not as </v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

2083
01:38:25.980 --> 01:38:30.980
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate people that say that though I'm </v>

2084
01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:33.501
<v Speaker 4>saying it and I hate people that say </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the book is the book we don't read </v>

2085
01:38:33.501 --> 01:38:33.501
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

2086
01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:36.180
<v Speaker 4>I think people will read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hardly read anymore.</v>

2087
01:38:36.270 --> 01:38:38.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I listened to books on tape,</v>

2088
01:38:39.310 --> 01:38:42.270
<v Speaker 4>hardly sit down and read them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still read them a little bit,</v>

2089
01:38:42.570 --> 01:38:46.530
<v Speaker 4>but I enjoy having someone read for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's awesome.</v>

2090
01:38:46.710 --> 01:38:50.190
<v Speaker 4>But it feels like a fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when I say if I tell someone I read</v>

2091
01:38:50.191 --> 01:38:52.950
<v Speaker 4>a book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to read some of the book to say I</v>

2092
01:38:52.951 --> 01:38:54.420
<v Speaker 4>read the book right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2093
01:38:54.421 --> 01:38:56.840
<v Speaker 4>but I'll read part of it and they'll go </v>
<v Speaker 4>book on tape and then I go,</v>

2094
01:38:56.850 --> 01:38:59.550
<v Speaker 4>I read that book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't really read it.</v>

2095
01:38:59.551 --> 01:39:04.551
<v Speaker 4>I only read like three chapters and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other 11 that had some actor read if you</v>

2096
01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:08.670
<v Speaker 4>tell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you tell somebody,</v>

2097
01:39:08.671 --> 01:39:10.050
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I listen to a lot of books on tape.</v>

2098
01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:10.430
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2099
01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:15.440
<v Speaker 4>you fucking moron.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But no one's tried to have you write a </v>

2100
01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:15.440
<v Speaker 4>book yet.</v>

2101
01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:17.850
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a book deal and it was so brutal.</v>

2102
01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:20.940
<v Speaker 4>Talk to the editor was so brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gave them their money back.</v>

2103
01:39:22.110 --> 01:39:26.130
<v Speaker 4>What was the book about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just short a bunch of essays on things,</v>

2104
01:39:26.131 --> 01:39:28.500
<v Speaker 4>but they wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what they asked me to do.</v>

2105
01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:31.830
<v Speaker 4>They asked me to transcribe my standup </v>
<v Speaker 4>once they were like,</v>

2106
01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:36.960
<v Speaker 4>they read some of my writing because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>used to do a lot of blogs and I used to </v>

2107
01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:40.041
<v Speaker 4>put a lot of blogs on my website and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>put them on online and some other </v>

2108
01:39:40.041 --> 01:39:40.800
<v Speaker 4>venues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2109
01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:41.760
<v Speaker 4>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2110
01:39:41.761 --> 01:39:46.761
<v Speaker 4>we want to give you a book deal and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's just write whatever you want to </v>

2111
01:39:46.761 --> 01:39:46.761
<v Speaker 4>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2112
01:39:46.761 --> 01:39:49.791
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then once you get some money from </v>

2113
01:39:49.791 --> 01:39:49.791
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's like,</v>

2114
01:39:49.791 --> 01:39:50.190
<v Speaker 4>we want you to write what we want you to</v>
<v Speaker 4>write.</v>

2115
01:39:50.370 --> 01:39:51.980
<v Speaker 4>And then they wanted me to write the.</v>

2116
01:39:52.010 --> 01:39:55.380
<v Speaker 4>One of the thoughts was they wanted me </v>
<v Speaker 4>to take my stand up and transcribe it.</v>

2117
01:39:55.590 --> 01:39:56.970
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's gotta be terrible.</v>

2118
01:39:57.180 --> 01:39:58.380
<v Speaker 4>Bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they were like,</v>

2119
01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:00.550
<v Speaker 4>george carlin did it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but jerry seinfeld did.</v>

2120
01:40:00.570 --> 01:40:00.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2121
01:40:00.931 --> 01:40:04.860
<v Speaker 4>they took a check and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe they wanted the money.</v>

2122
01:40:04.861 --> 01:40:06.850
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe george had taxes city I pay,</v>

2123
01:40:06.851 --> 01:40:08.340
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing that.</v>

2124
01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:09.540
<v Speaker 4>And so they said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2125
01:40:09.690 --> 01:40:13.820
<v Speaker 4>well we want you to think that you want </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get a laugh like onstage,</v>

2126
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:15.360
<v Speaker 4>like every 30 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2127
01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:16.770
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to write about some stuff that</v>

2128
01:40:16.771 --> 01:40:21.771
<v Speaker 4>I don't even think it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then no one does that when they're </v>

2129
01:40:21.771 --> 01:40:24.330
<v Speaker 4>reading a book labs every 30 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I sent them a chapter and they edited</v>

2130
01:40:24.331 --> 01:40:29.331
<v Speaker 4>it and changed a bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sheila changed the tone of it and I'm </v>

2131
01:40:29.331 --> 01:40:29.331
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're done.</v>

2132
01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:34.590
<v Speaker 4>I called my manager,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go tell them we're giving the money </v>

2133
01:40:34.590 --> 01:40:34.590
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were like,</v>

2134
01:40:34.590 --> 01:40:34.590
<v Speaker 4>are you fucking serious?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

2135
01:40:34.590 --> 01:40:34.830
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give them their money back.</v>

2136
01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:39.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy that they would actually </v>

2137
01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:39.860
<v Speaker 4>change the language of what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how you would even write.</v>

2138
01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:43.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm never going to do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That way if I do do it again,</v>

2139
01:40:43.171 --> 01:40:48.171
<v Speaker 4>if I do write a book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to write a book and then I'm </v>

2140
01:40:48.171 --> 01:40:48.330
<v Speaker 4>going to sell the book or I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>put the book online.</v>

2141
01:40:48.331 --> 01:40:53.331
<v Speaker 4>If nobody wants to buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if nobody wants to buy it and turn it </v>

2142
01:40:53.331 --> 01:40:53.331
<v Speaker 4>into a book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go,</v>

2143
01:40:53.331 --> 01:40:53.510
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the blood your own.</v>

2144
01:40:53.550 --> 01:40:57.640
<v Speaker 4>Now you can think it sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at least it sucks.</v>

2145
01:40:57.641 --> 01:41:00.130
<v Speaker 4>And it came from my head and my fingers </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2146
01:41:00.131 --> 01:41:00.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to write it.</v>

2147
01:41:00.970 --> 01:41:05.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to think it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can totally think it sucks and you </v>

2148
01:41:05.970 --> 01:41:08.221
<v Speaker 4>don't want it that and look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's just the reality of things is </v>

2149
01:41:08.221 --> 01:41:13.081
<v Speaker 4>when someone creates something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna resonate with a certain </v>

2150
01:41:13.081 --> 01:41:13.081
<v Speaker 4>amount of people and other people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to hate it.</v>

2151
01:41:13.081 --> 01:41:16.330
<v Speaker 4>Just fucking music that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible and people love it.</v>

2152
01:41:16.331 --> 01:41:21.331
<v Speaker 4>They wait in line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they go to see these concerts that I </v>

2153
01:41:21.331 --> 01:41:24.420
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would have to strap me to a chair </v>

2154
01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:27.120
<v Speaker 4>and prime my eyes open like clockwork </v>
<v Speaker 4>orange for me to sit there and watch it </v>

2155
01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:30.691
<v Speaker 4>and they can't wait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can wait so tastes and and people's </v>

2156
01:41:30.761 --> 01:41:35.761
<v Speaker 4>desires very.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But as soon as someone who tries to </v>

2157
01:41:35.761 --> 01:41:38.710
<v Speaker 4>enforce their ideas of like what you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how you should express yourself.</v>

2158
01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:44.100
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought of it as like very similar to </v>

2159
01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:44.760
<v Speaker 4>stand up in the way that like if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if my standup,</v>

2160
01:41:44.770 --> 01:41:49.770
<v Speaker 4>if somebody came along and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like some publicists that I didn't even </v>

2161
01:41:49.770 --> 01:41:53.251
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not even a friend and wanted to edit my </v>

2162
01:41:53.251 --> 01:41:53.251
<v Speaker 4>standup.</v>

2163
01:41:53.251 --> 01:41:54.040
<v Speaker 4>You can think my standup socks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can not like it,</v>

2164
01:41:54.130 --> 01:41:57.400
<v Speaker 4>but if as long as I'm actually paying </v>
<v Speaker 4>attention to it,</v>

2165
01:41:57.610 --> 01:42:02.610
<v Speaker 4>as long as I'm actually sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm actually going over it and then </v>

2166
01:42:02.610 --> 01:42:04.840
<v Speaker 4>editing it and in thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>myself and practicing and onstage,</v>

2167
01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:07.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't want your opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want your input.</v>

2168
01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:09.330
<v Speaker 4>You either like it or you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly,</v>

2169
01:42:09.370 --> 01:42:10.600
<v Speaker 4>but it's me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2170
01:42:10.890 --> 01:42:12.490
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Came out and it sucked.</v>

2171
01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:14.050
<v Speaker 4>And then people would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you suck.</v>

2172
01:42:14.051 --> 01:42:14.650
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2173
01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:17.590
<v Speaker 4>it actually isn't me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's this ghost writer and he sucks.</v>

2174
01:42:18.030 --> 01:42:20.500
<v Speaker 4>But I think the movie has to be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>collaboration,</v>

2175
01:42:20.530 --> 01:42:21.910
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're doing a movie,</v>

2176
01:42:21.911 --> 01:42:24.040
<v Speaker 4>you have actors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have writers,</v>

2177
01:42:24.041 --> 01:42:26.440
<v Speaker 4>you have directors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have producers,</v>

2178
01:42:26.441 --> 01:42:28.030
<v Speaker 4>you have the people that are giving you </v>
<v Speaker 4>the money.</v>

2179
01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:31.090
<v Speaker 4>That's got to be a goddamn nightmare </v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's a lot of,</v>

2180
01:42:31.450 --> 01:42:33.430
<v Speaker 4>lot of different cooks in that kitchen.</v>

2181
01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:36.510
<v Speaker 4>But that makes sense to me that you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to collaborate with these people.</v>

2182
01:42:36.511 --> 01:42:38.320
<v Speaker 4>Like if you see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're playing some,</v>

2183
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:40.600
<v Speaker 4>some chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some movie,</v>

2184
01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:42.010
<v Speaker 4>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2185
01:42:42.011 --> 01:42:43.930
<v Speaker 4>you have this idea of how it's supposed </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be.</v>

2186
01:42:43.931 --> 01:42:48.931
<v Speaker 4>That's how you audition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then you get on set and the </v>

2187
01:42:48.931 --> 01:42:48.931
<v Speaker 4>director's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>abby,</v>

2188
01:42:48.931 --> 01:42:51.290
<v Speaker 4>what I want you to do is play a chinese </v>
<v Speaker 4>lady 1500.</v>

2189
01:42:51.790 --> 01:42:52.600
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2190
01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:54.130
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd be like,</v>

2191
01:42:54.131 --> 01:42:56.530
<v Speaker 4>but that's not what I got hired to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what the fuck is this?</v>

2192
01:42:56.740 --> 01:43:01.740
<v Speaker 4>Then you have this chaotic sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>struggle between the director and the </v>

2193
01:43:01.931 --> 01:43:06.931
<v Speaker 4>producers telling you to act one way and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a lot of nonsense that one of the </v>

2194
01:43:06.931 --> 01:43:11.191
<v Speaker 4>pure things about writing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's writing stand up or </v>

2195
01:43:11.191 --> 01:43:15.091
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like it's here's the world and </v>

2196
01:43:15.091 --> 01:43:15.091
<v Speaker 4>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's my vision,</v>

2197
01:43:15.091 --> 01:43:16.120
<v Speaker 4>here's the world through my eyes and my </v>
<v Speaker 4>fingers,</v>

2198
01:43:16.121 --> 01:43:19.180
<v Speaker 4>and as soon as you allow someone to </v>
<v Speaker 4>start fucking with that,</v>

2199
01:43:19.181 --> 01:43:24.181
<v Speaker 4>I just think it's a recipe for disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my experience wasn't good.</v>

2200
01:43:24.430 --> 01:43:29.430
<v Speaker 4>Not that you can't have a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience writing a book and maybe </v>

2201
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:30.160
<v Speaker 4>other people have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everybody that I've talked to,</v>

2202
01:43:30.161 --> 01:43:31.600
<v Speaker 4>the wrote a book tolerable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2203
01:43:31.601 --> 01:43:36.601
<v Speaker 4>That told me it was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody I know that wrote a book I </v>

2204
01:43:36.601 --> 01:43:37.260
<v Speaker 4>have to talk to whitney about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She didn't have a bad experience.</v>

2205
01:43:38.610 --> 01:43:40.630
<v Speaker 4>Get there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go use that restroom.</v>

2206
01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:45.740
<v Speaker 4>Every.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Abby martin is my favorite hardcore </v>

2207
01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:48.781
<v Speaker 4>lefty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think she can't figure out where the </v>

2208
01:43:48.781 --> 01:43:48.781
<v Speaker 4>doors.</v>

2209
01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:51.860
<v Speaker 4>She's my favorite hardcore lefty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She so rabid.</v>

2210
01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:57.240
<v Speaker 4>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to get her in a room with sam </v>

2211
01:43:57.240 --> 01:43:58.961
<v Speaker 4>harris though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because she hates sam harris and she </v>

2212
01:43:58.961 --> 01:44:01.070
<v Speaker 4>thinks sam harris wants to fucking bomb </v>
<v Speaker 4>every country where brown people live.</v>

2213
01:44:01.370 --> 01:44:04.010
<v Speaker 4>She just takes things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She see how she ramps up.</v>

2214
01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:09.340
<v Speaker 4>Like she wants to take things so far,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you can't even talk to her about </v>

2215
01:44:09.340 --> 01:44:12.260
<v Speaker 4>like what social justice warriors do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was like,</v>

2216
01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:14.390
<v Speaker 4>she's not even thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that she's just like,</v>

2217
01:44:14.391 --> 01:44:14.930
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but why?</v>

2218
01:44:14.931 --> 01:44:15.230
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2219
01:44:15.231 --> 01:44:17.600
<v Speaker 4>They're paying attention to that while </v>
<v Speaker 4>trump is doing this and they're ready to</v>

2220
01:44:17.601 --> 01:44:20.660
<v Speaker 4>bomb North Korea and yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's still an issue.</v>

2221
01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:23.450
<v Speaker 4>It's still something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a thing going on.</v>

2222
01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:25.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to pick.</v>

2223
01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:27.390
<v Speaker 5>Pick your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2224
01:44:27.450 --> 01:44:29.780
<v Speaker 5>One and be like you said so much info </v>
<v Speaker 5>going on.</v>

2225
01:44:29.781 --> 01:44:30.950
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get distracted from one,</v>

2226
01:44:30.951 --> 01:44:33.710
<v Speaker 5>especially if you have a tinge of add.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

2227
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:35.110
<v Speaker 5>Don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2228
01:44:35.130 --> 01:44:36.110
<v Speaker 5>will for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who doesn't?</v>

2229
01:44:36.370 --> 01:44:39.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't trust people don't have add.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2230
01:44:39.100 --> 01:44:42.370
<v Speaker 4>like you can concentrate all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like one of those people that can</v>

2231
01:44:42.371 --> 01:44:45.550
<v Speaker 4>really sit down and concentrate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally cp that Quick.</v>

2232
01:44:45.551 --> 01:44:47.680
<v Speaker 4>That's the scene where you open it up </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a bucket.</v>

2233
01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:53.640
<v Speaker 4>How's that even possible?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't even make sense with me.</v>

2234
01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:54.730
<v Speaker 4>What are you saying jamie?</v>

2235
01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:57.580
<v Speaker 5>See the lambs being born outside of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>wound.</v>

2236
01:44:57.610 --> 01:45:02.610
<v Speaker 5>Did you set story going around today?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the apocalypse silence and not </v>

2237
01:45:02.610 --> 01:45:04.390
<v Speaker 5>like they weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They weren't a holy god made in there,</v>

2238
01:45:04.391 --> 01:45:06.760
<v Speaker 5>but it waS.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's being tested on.</v>

2239
01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:09.760
<v Speaker 5>I think it was sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a premature births,</v>

2240
01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:14.740
<v Speaker 5>so after a instead of a 37 week period,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it wAs like 28 weeks,</v>

2241
01:45:14.741 --> 01:45:17.350
<v Speaker 5>they could put it in the sack and it was</v>
<v Speaker 5>still growing.</v>

2242
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:22.180
<v Speaker 5>Hair eyes opened up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll show you the story real quick.</v>

2243
01:45:22.930 --> 01:45:24.520
<v Speaker 5>Do you see that blowjob machine,</v>

2244
01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:30.460
<v Speaker 4>this new blowjob robot that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>invented just for blowjobs one better </v>

<v Speaker 4>Flashlight.</v>

2247
01:45:33.420 --> 01:45:34.950
<v Speaker 4>You have to actually move that thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>

2248
01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:35.760
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

2252
01:45:47.110 --> 01:45:49.710
<v Speaker 4>this baby sheep is inside a positive </v>
<v Speaker 4>lamb is growing in an artificial womb.</v>

2253

2291
01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:47.940
<v Speaker 2>But the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the most open,</v>

2292
01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:50.550
<v Speaker 2>like the information is readily </v>

<v Speaker 2>He was such a tortured soul come in at </v>

2308
01:48:29.230 --> 01:48:31.980
<v Speaker 2>times that god gave me mushrooms.</v>

2309
01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:34.710

<v Speaker 2>brought me a giant bag of mushrooms.</v>

2310
01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:38.250
<v Speaker 2>Good man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great guy.</v>

2311
01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:39.570
<v Speaker 2>Good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loved him.</v>

2312
01:48:39.571 --> 01:48:41.890
<v Speaker 2>I didn't agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't agree with them because he was.</v>

2313
01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:46.910
<v Speaker 2>He was so crazy about so many different </v>
<v Speaker 2>things about peak oil and stuff like </v>

2314
01:48:46.910 --> 01:48:49.020
<v Speaker 2>that whole lung collapsed documentary </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they did where they interviewed him</v>

2315
01:48:49.021 --> 01:48:50.460
<v Speaker 2>and he's just sitting there smoking </v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes,</v>

2316
01:48:50.461 --> 01:48:51.690
<v Speaker 2>talking about the end is near.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2317
01:48:51.691 --> 01:48:53.250
<v Speaker 2>jesus dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

2318
01:48:53.251 --> 01:48:55.020
<v Speaker 2>all these years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's fine.</v>

2319
01:48:55.500 --> 01:49:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Like he wasn't right about peak oil and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the other things and he was </v>

2320
01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:02.040
<v Speaker 2>always inclined to go towards doom and </v>
<v Speaker 2>gloom,</v>

2321
01:49:02.041 --> 01:49:07.041
<v Speaker 2>but I think that that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that documentary collapse and his </v>

2322
01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:12.800
<v Speaker 2>worldview,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a lot of it was based on how he </v>

2323
01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:15.291
<v Speaker 2>thought of things because he was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed and just kind of an </v>

2324
01:49:15.291 --> 01:49:16.380
<v Speaker 2>externalization of his own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was depression,</v>

2325
01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:19.020
<v Speaker 2>anyone up often themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so horrible.</v>

2326
01:49:19.050 --> 01:49:24.050
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the saddest suicides of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that I knew when I knew that he </v>

2327
01:49:24.050 --> 01:49:26.340
<v Speaker 2>killed himself because he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sent me some emails.</v>

2328
01:49:26.970 --> 01:49:31.500
<v Speaker 2>We talked back and forth and he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was definitely like down in the dumps</v>

2329
01:49:31.710 --> 01:49:34.500
<v Speaker 2>and I always felt like god man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fuck,</v>

2330
01:49:34.501 --> 01:49:38.700
<v Speaker 2>I just needs better people around him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he just needs more positivity,</v>

2331
01:49:38.701 --> 01:49:43.701
<v Speaker 2>but he was so engrossed and entrenched </v>
<v Speaker 2>in corruption and greed and all this </v>

2332
01:49:44.831 --> 01:49:49.831
<v Speaker 2>stuff that you saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll never forget that fucking </v>

2333
01:49:49.831 --> 01:49:49.831
<v Speaker 2>speech</v>

<v Speaker 8>criminal activity.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's classified well,</v>

2381
01:52:47.811 --> 01:52:52.811
<v Speaker 8>you use that classification to hide the </v>

<v Speaker 2>Like that was a very,</v>

2386
01:53:13.071 --> 01:53:16.440
<v Speaker 2>very important moment.</v>

2389
01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:25.650
<v Speaker 2>fund these black ops and that's how </v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

2390
01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:30.680
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole oliver north.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the connection between freeway </v>

2391
01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:30.850
<v Speaker 2>ricky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I also had an apartment.</v>

2392
01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:35.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's how he made millions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars by selling the cia's</v>

2393
01:53:36.090 --> 01:53:41.090
<v Speaker 2>drugs and that's how they funded the </v>
<v Speaker 2>contract versus the sandinistas unreal.</v>

2394
01:53:41.250 --> 01:53:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're telling me that this opium </v>

2395
01:53:46.250 --> 01:53:46.470
<v Speaker 2>just leaving Afghanistan without being </v>
<v Speaker 2>monitored or,</v>

2396
01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:51.480
<v Speaker 2>or trafficked whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>they must have done a way better job of </v>

2397
01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:51.480
<v Speaker 2>keeping it together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

2398
01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:52.580
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they learned something,</v>

2399
01:53:53.420 --> 01:53:55.500
<v Speaker 2>not have another oliver north type deal.</v>

2400
01:53:55.930 --> 01:53:57.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit ain't no good.</v>

2401
01:53:58.150 --> 01:54:00.990
<v Speaker 2>I think Afghanistan to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only other country other than if I'm</v>

2402
01:54:00.991 --> 01:54:02.130
<v Speaker 2>not mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenya,</v>

2403
01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:06.180
<v Speaker 2>that is actually not only the metadata,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2404
01:54:06.181 --> 01:54:07.680
<v Speaker 2>like we're collecting metadata </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere,</v>

2405
01:54:07.681 --> 01:54:12.681
<v Speaker 2>but that is one of two countries in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world that wikileaks exposed that we're </v>

2406
01:54:12.681 --> 01:54:16.161
<v Speaker 2>actually collecting every phone call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every phone call is being archived and </v>

2407
01:54:16.161 --> 01:54:16.161
<v Speaker 2>recorded from Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2408
01:54:16.161 --> 01:54:20.520
<v Speaker 2>which kind of adds to the weirdness that</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow these giant heroin,</v>

2409
01:54:20.970 --> 01:54:25.970
<v Speaker 2>opium manufacturing operations going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we still can't get a grasp on where </v>

2410
01:54:25.970 --> 01:54:29.190
<v Speaker 2>it's coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yet it really affects America.</v>

2411
01:54:29.191 --> 01:54:29.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god damn.</v>

2412
01:54:29.941 --> 01:54:31.710
<v Speaker 2>What is it like more than car crashes </v>
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>

2413
01:54:31.711 --> 01:54:36.030
<v Speaker 2>Our pill overdoses and opiate overdoses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nuts.</v>

2414
01:54:36.410 --> 01:54:41.100
<v Speaker 2>It's just surpassed car accidents for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first time ever and insane.</v>

2415
01:54:41.130 --> 01:54:44.490
<v Speaker 2>I had dennis mckenna on recently was </v>
<v Speaker 2>explaining to me,</v>

2416
01:54:44.670 --> 01:54:45.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty awesome.</v>

2417
01:54:45.571 --> 01:54:47.820
<v Speaker 2>He's such a genIus man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so spooky.</v>

2418
01:54:47.821 --> 01:54:50.490
<v Speaker 2>Smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was explaining to me carfentanil,</v>

2419
01:54:50.491 --> 01:54:55.491
<v Speaker 2>which is a new form of fentanyl that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>even more powerful than fentanyl still </v>

2420
01:54:55.491 --> 01:54:55.491
<v Speaker 2>scheduled to though.</v>

2421
01:54:57.480 --> 01:55:02.480
<v Speaker 2>Marijuana schedule one never killed a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking human being ever that he was </v>

2422
01:55:02.670 --> 01:55:07.260
<v Speaker 2>saying that the head of a pin contains </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough for you to die of an overdose.</v>

2423
01:55:08.970 --> 01:55:10.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2424
01:55:10.370 --> 01:55:12.120
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would he do that?</v>

2425
01:55:14.070 --> 01:55:18.210
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we make that easy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because like hippos,</v>

2426
01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:20.130
<v Speaker 2>we need a handout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hurt.</v>

2427
01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:23.100
<v Speaker 2>They have joint aches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His poor hippos.</v>

2428
01:55:23.250 --> 01:55:28.250
<v Speaker 2>We have to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to figure out how to to </v>

2429
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:29.970
<v Speaker 2>authoritarians brace for more overdoses </v>
<v Speaker 2>after Maryland desa linked to elephants.</v>

2430
01:55:29.971 --> 01:55:30.590
<v Speaker 2>Additive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2431
01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:33.580
<v Speaker 2>horse tranquilizers now run elephant </v>
<v Speaker 2>sedatives.</v>

2432
01:55:33.630 --> 01:55:35.640
<v Speaker 2>I thought we were on ketamine and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're on.</v>

2433
01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:41.060
<v Speaker 2>Now we're on a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so potent to overdoses 10,000</v>

2434
01:55:42.091 --> 01:55:43.680
<v Speaker 2>times more potent and time.</v>

2435
01:55:44.610 --> 01:55:49.440
<v Speaker 4>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>times more potent than a thousand times.</v>

2436
01:55:49.530 --> 01:55:54.530
<v Speaker 4>Not like 110.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is so insane.</v>

2437
01:55:54.780 --> 01:55:59.780
<v Speaker 4>This is why philip seymour hoffman and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so many other people die of overdoses </v>

2438
01:55:59.780 --> 01:56:02.940
<v Speaker 4>because the drug war and these people </v>
<v Speaker 4>just sell like laced heroin and shit.</v>

2439
01:56:02.941 --> 01:56:05.510
<v Speaker 4>And It's so dangerous and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2440
01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:10.640
<v Speaker 4>it's absolutely horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we were talking about bourdain's </v>

2441
01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:13.461
<v Speaker 4>show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had a great show on Massachusetts on </v>

2442
01:56:13.461 --> 01:56:16.540
<v Speaker 4>cnn show and it was about the heroin </v>
<v Speaker 4>epidemic that's hit Massachusetts and </v>

2443
01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:21.201
<v Speaker 4>many other places as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he kind of talked about </v>

2444
01:56:21.201 --> 01:56:21.201
<v Speaker 4>Massachusetts because,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2445
01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:26.360
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had a few people that they were </v>

2446
01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:28.071
<v Speaker 4>referring to where these people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they got hooked on oxycontin and </v>

2447
01:56:28.071 --> 01:56:29.340
<v Speaker 4>oxycodone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the difference is to,</v>

2448
01:56:29.341 --> 01:56:31.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2449
01:56:31.110 --> 01:56:34.440
<v Speaker 4>and then they made it much more </v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult to get.</v>

2450
01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:36.570
<v Speaker 4>And then as soon as these people made it</v>
<v Speaker 4>much more difficult to get.</v>

2451
01:56:36.570 --> 01:56:39.860
<v Speaker 4>You're dealing with these people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>have addictions and so then they started</v>

2452
01:56:39.861 --> 01:56:44.861
<v Speaker 4>doing actual heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they're taking hillbilly heroin and </v>

2453
01:56:44.861 --> 01:56:45.820
<v Speaker 4>then they get addicted to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2454
01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:48.660
<v Speaker 4>if you have a back pain or you hurt </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>

2455
01:56:48.661 --> 01:56:50.640
<v Speaker 4>they'll fucking write you a script for </v>
<v Speaker 4>that shit.</v>

2456
01:56:50.641 --> 01:56:55.641
<v Speaker 4>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I have a bunch of friends that got </v>

2457
01:56:55.641 --> 01:56:55.641
<v Speaker 4>hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2458
01:56:55.641 --> 01:56:57.290
<v Speaker 4>I have a family member that just became </v>
<v Speaker 4>a loser,</v>

2459
01:56:57.570 --> 01:57:00.470
<v Speaker 4>was a hardworking guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had his shit together,</v>

2460
01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:02.610
<v Speaker 4>got hooked on those pills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Loser.</v>

2461
01:57:02.611 --> 01:57:05.370
<v Speaker 4>Now no one talks to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just gone his own fucking kids.</v>

2462

<v Speaker 4>Don't talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gone.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They had them on that shit.</v>

2465
01:57:11.071 --> 01:57:12.780
<v Speaker 4>And then three months later he's taking </v>
<v Speaker 4>it every day,</v>

2466
01:57:12.781 --> 01:57:15.870
<v Speaker 4>still his friends had come over his </v>
<v Speaker 4>house and scoop it up out of his,</v>

2467
01:57:15.871 --> 01:57:18.050
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of is a medicine cabinet.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>scary stuff.</v>

2469
01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:22.530
<v Speaker 4>Scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you just need it.</v>

2471
01:57:24.210 --> 01:57:25.740
<v Speaker 4>I'll get off it eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but right now I need it.</v>

2472
01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:30.800
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had my wisdom teeth taken out when I </v>

2473
01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:32.230
<v Speaker 4>was 17 and I feel like I got addicted to</v>
<v Speaker 4>them that the doctor gave me.</v>

2474
01:57:32.231 --> 01:57:33.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I loved it.</v>

2475
01:57:33.150 --> 01:57:34.860
<v Speaker 4>How could you not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never did it.</v>

2476
01:57:34.950 --> 01:57:35.480
<v Speaker 4>What's?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2477
01:57:35.510 --> 01:57:40.510
<v Speaker 4>I never did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got a knee surgery once and they </v>

2478
01:57:40.510 --> 01:57:43.881
<v Speaker 4>gave me something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was either percocets or viking and I </v>

2479
01:57:43.881 --> 01:57:44.130
<v Speaker 4>cannot remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it made me so stupid.</v>

2480
01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:46.770
<v Speaker 4>I remember thinking I would rather be </v>
<v Speaker 4>pain.</v>

2481
01:57:47.610 --> 01:57:52.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty good with pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not good with anything that </v>

2482
01:57:52.610 --> 01:57:53.310
<v Speaker 4>makes me feel stupid beCause I feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>vulnerable.</v>

2483
01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:57.560
<v Speaker 4>Like I'd rather I'd rather be hurting </v>
<v Speaker 4>and aware than I w I don't know,</v>

2484
01:57:57.570 --> 01:57:59.640
<v Speaker 4>like a numb guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like numbing out.</v>

2485
01:57:59.670 --> 01:58:04.670
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the reasons why I like pot</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it makes me hyper aware and </v>

2486
01:58:04.670 --> 01:58:07.110
<v Speaker 4>hyper vigilant and really sensitive and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it makes me,</v>

2487
01:58:07.140 --> 01:58:07.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

2488
01:58:07.711 --> 01:58:09.750
<v Speaker 4>you can call it paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people call it paranoid,</v>

2489
01:58:09.751 --> 01:58:10.200
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2490
01:58:10.250 --> 01:58:13.020
<v Speaker 4>I think it's more like hyperawareness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2491
01:58:13.021 --> 01:58:18.021
<v Speaker 4>in that hyper awareness you have to take</v>
<v Speaker 4>into account all the variables that you </v>

2492
01:58:18.021 --> 01:58:18.120
<v Speaker 4>are going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you are in a,</v>

2493
01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:23.220
<v Speaker 4>a ball that spinning a thousand miles an</v>
<v Speaker 4>hour with a thin layer of gas,</v>

2494
01:58:23.221 --> 01:58:24.330
<v Speaker 4>flat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>flat,</v>

2495
01:58:24.331 --> 01:58:26.810
<v Speaker 4>flat earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No spinning,</v>

2496
01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:28.400
<v Speaker 4>spinning around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh wait,</v>

2497
01:58:28.430 --> 01:58:29.730
<v Speaker 4>just stationery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2498
01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:33.360
<v Speaker 4>everything's doing something around us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

2499
01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:35.610
<v Speaker 4>Whenever I hear the flutter thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just like,</v>

2500
01:58:35.611 --> 01:58:40.611
<v Speaker 4>don't ask her not to take photos from </v>
<v Speaker 4>space now or you can see the earth </v>

2501
01:58:40.611 --> 01:58:44.151
<v Speaker 4>behind you live.</v>

<v Speaker 4>a full picture of the earth.</v>

2508
01:58:57.700 --> 01:59:00.330
<v Speaker 4>They think it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all you have to say.</v>

2509
01:59:00.331 --> 01:59:01.360
<v Speaker 4>It's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the way.</v>

2510
01:59:01.361 --> 01:59:03.430
<v Speaker 4>They keep saying that you can't fly over</v>
<v Speaker 4>antarctica.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Stop you from flying away article.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't regularly scheduled flights.</v>

2514
01:59:12.641 --> 01:59:15.100
<v Speaker 4>They fly over antarctica.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>

2515
01:59:15.101 --> 01:59:19.180
<v Speaker 4>there's a quantas pilot who filmed it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he was tired of that bullshit.</v>

2516
01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:24.070
<v Speaker 4>Mic west.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy who runs the man who runs metta,</v>

2517
01:59:24.071 --> 01:59:29.071
<v Speaker 4>bunk metabolic is a website designed for</v>
<v Speaker 4>debunking conspiracy theories with facts</v>

2518
01:59:30.581 --> 01:59:32.140
<v Speaker 4>and science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

2519
01:59:32.180 --> 01:59:37.180
<v Speaker 4>they have many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many pages on the flat earth on that </v>

2520
01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:38.980
<v Speaker 4>website of debunking all the arguments </v>
<v Speaker 4>against flatter it.</v>

2521
01:59:38.990 --> 01:59:41.590
<v Speaker 4>So he's going to come on the website and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to go over them.</v>

2522
01:59:41.890 --> 01:59:44.140
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to die one.</v>

2523
01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:49.600
<v Speaker 4>Some reason it's still growing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's because me and my $3 a month that I</v>

2524
01:59:49.901 --> 01:59:51.890
<v Speaker 4>take from george soros,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

2525
01:59:51.900 --> 01:59:53.350
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my round earth.</v>

2526
01:59:54.860 --> 01:59:59.860
<v Speaker 4>How much you think they get paid you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the earth was flat and you knew that </v>

2527
01:59:59.860 --> 02:00:04.581
<v Speaker 4>the earth was flat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>could they even pay you enough to not </v>

2528
02:00:04.581 --> 02:00:04.581
<v Speaker 4>tell people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2529
02:00:04.581 --> 02:00:05.230
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way.</v>

2530
02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:10.260
<v Speaker 4>There'd be no way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think of how many people you'd have to </v>

2531
02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:10.930
<v Speaker 4>tell or how many people you'd have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>keep fire up the moon landing thing.</v>

2532
02:00:10.931 --> 02:00:12.250
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a cover up.</v>

2533
02:00:12.251 --> 02:00:17.251
<v Speaker 4>The flutter thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The moon landing at least happened in </v>

2534
02:00:17.251 --> 02:00:20.740
<v Speaker 4>1969 and it happened with a limited </v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of people that were had access to</v>

2535
02:00:20.741 --> 02:00:22.600
<v Speaker 4>all the technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no internet.</v>

2536
02:00:23.320 --> 02:00:26.950
<v Speaker 4>They controlled the media and we never </v>
<v Speaker 4>went back.</v>

2537
02:00:27.130 --> 02:00:32.130
<v Speaker 4>So there's all sorts of beautiful things</v>
<v Speaker 4>connect together to form a nice juicy </v>

2538
02:00:32.130 --> 02:00:34.930
<v Speaker 4>fat conspiracy that I love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love the moon landings.</v>

2539
02:00:35.420 --> 02:00:38.920
<v Speaker 4>I secretly not so secretly covered that </v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

2540
02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:41.800
<v Speaker 4>Like no other conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would love it if it was true.</v>

2541
02:00:42.010 --> 02:00:42.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

2542
02:00:42.970 --> 02:00:45.490
<v Speaker 4>there's a great quote from bill clinton </v>
<v Speaker 4>from his book,</v>

2543
02:00:45.491 --> 02:00:48.390
<v Speaker 4>my life on the moon landing and it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2544
02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:53.760
<v Speaker 4>it's fascinating because he's talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about an old carpenter and he says the </v>

2545
02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:54.330
<v Speaker 4>carpenter says that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2546
02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:59.350
<v Speaker 4>them mtv fellers that he didn't believe </v>
<v Speaker 4>the moon landing and that those tv flow </v>

2547
02:00:59.350 --> 02:01:02.670
<v Speaker 4>fellows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never believe anything because they </v>

2548
02:01:02.670 --> 02:01:03.580
<v Speaker 4>can pretty much do anything and make you</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe that it's real and you don't.</v>

2549
02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:05.620
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back then I thought he was a crank,</v>

2550
02:01:05.740 --> 02:01:07.360
<v Speaker 4>but after eight years of the white </v>
<v Speaker 4>house,</v>

2551
02:01:07.870 --> 02:01:09.760
<v Speaker 4>I was wondering if he's not ahead of his</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2552
02:01:10.570 --> 02:01:15.570
<v Speaker 4>That's in bill clinton's book series.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to hear something really quick </v>

2553
02:01:15.570 --> 02:01:15.900
<v Speaker 4>and people are going to go on with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>moon.</v>

2554
02:01:15.901 --> 02:01:16.450
<v Speaker 4>Moon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you good,</v>

2555
02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:18.010
<v Speaker 4>bro?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought you gave up on that.</v>

2556
02:01:18.310 --> 02:01:23.310
<v Speaker 4>I will give you the most cryptic piece </v>
<v Speaker 4>of information about the moon landing.</v>

2557
02:01:23.770 --> 02:01:28.770
<v Speaker 4>Neil armstrong gave a speech on the 25th</v>
<v Speaker 4>anniversary of the moon landings and it </v>

2558
02:01:30.601 --> 02:01:35.601
<v Speaker 4>is one of the most what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>speeches you'll ever hear in your life </v>

2559
02:01:35.601 --> 02:01:37.360
<v Speaker 4>because it's not a guy saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2560
02:01:37.361 --> 02:01:39.150
<v Speaker 4>we went to the moon and it was an </v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing.</v>

2561
02:01:39.290 --> 02:01:41.360
<v Speaker 4>You kids are going to accomplish amazing</v>
<v Speaker 4>things as well.</v>

2562
02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:46.840
<v Speaker 4>Pull up neil armstrong's cryptics says </v>
<v Speaker 4>she doesn't remember if there were </v>

2563
02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:47.200
<v Speaker 4>stars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no known,</v>

2564
02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:52.300
<v Speaker 4>but that is one of the things that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>did say it wasn't neil armstrong by the </v>

2565
02:01:52.300 --> 02:01:55.091
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was Michael Collins had said that </v>

2566
02:01:55.091 --> 02:01:55.091
<v Speaker 4>Michael Collins said that he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>recall seeing any stars,</v>

2567
02:01:55.091 --> 02:01:59.831
<v Speaker 4>but then later in his book he recalled </v>
<v Speaker 4>in great depth what the stars looked </v>

2568
02:02:00.171 --> 02:02:03.650
<v Speaker 4>like and how amazing they were and how </v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible they were him later.</v>

2569
02:02:03.680 --> 02:02:06.140
<v Speaker 4>But meanwhile he was in the lunar lander</v>
<v Speaker 4>is whole time.</v>

2570
02:02:06.141 --> 02:02:07.340
<v Speaker 4>So play this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>play this</v>

2571
02:02:08.650 --> 02:02:12.040
<v Speaker 1>on the 25th anniversary of the event in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1994,</v>

2572
02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:17.520
<v Speaker 1>neil armstrong meter rare public </v>
<v Speaker 1>appearance and held back tears as he </v>

2573
02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:21.751
<v Speaker 1>spoke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These brief triptych remarks before the </v>

2574
02:02:21.751 --> 02:02:22.630
<v Speaker 1>next generation of taxpayers as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>tour the white house.</v>

2575
02:02:22.660 --> 02:02:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Listen to this</v>

2576
02:02:24.430 --> 02:02:28.400
<v Speaker 7>today.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We have with this group of students some</v>

2577
02:02:28.401 --> 02:02:33.401
<v Speaker 7>on america's best to you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We say we have only completed a </v>

2578
02:02:35.111 --> 02:02:39.460
<v Speaker 7>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We leave you much.</v>

2579
02:02:39.850 --> 02:02:44.020
<v Speaker 7>That is under.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There are great ideas.</v>

2580
02:02:44.021 --> 02:02:49.021
<v Speaker 7>Undiscovered breakthroughs are available</v>
<v Speaker 7>to those who can remove one of truths,</v>

2581
02:02:52.301 --> 02:02:53.440
<v Speaker 7>protective layers.</v>

2582
02:02:57.670 --> 02:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Is this a funny thing that happened on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that the moon did?</v>

2583
02:03:00.050 --> 02:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>That movie is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they showed the apollo mission and </v>

2584
02:03:05.050 --> 02:03:08.221
<v Speaker 1>it shows them like putting the piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>paper where it makes it look like </v>

2585
02:03:08.221 --> 02:03:08.221
<v Speaker 1>they're farther away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2586
02:03:08.221 --> 02:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>what are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2587
02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:09.100
<v Speaker 1>have no idea.</v>

2588
02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:14.400
<v Speaker 4>They're filming through a window there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>filming the earth through a circular </v>

2589
02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:17.700
<v Speaker 4>window and they have the cabin of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>lunar module blacked out.</v>

2590
02:03:17.701 --> 02:03:22.701
<v Speaker 4>They have all these things over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>windows like a set and they using </v>

2591
02:03:22.701 --> 02:03:24.190
<v Speaker 4>diffused lighting to operate the </v>
<v Speaker 4>controls.</v>

2592
02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:29.200
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so strange because it's the one </v>

2593
02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:31.911
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy that still to this day you go</v>
<v Speaker 4>home because there's no technological </v>

2594
02:03:32.161 --> 02:03:35.460
<v Speaker 4>achievement from 1969 site easier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cheaper,</v>

2595
02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:40.520
<v Speaker 4>and faster to reproduce today other than</v>
<v Speaker 4>the moon landing is they went six times </v>

2596
02:03:40.561 --> 02:03:43.320
<v Speaker 4>seven attempts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six to successful attempts.</v>

2597
02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:45.930
<v Speaker 4>Apollo 13,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously they never went.</v>

2598
02:03:46.350 --> 02:03:49.590
<v Speaker 4>They did that accident that made tom </v>
<v Speaker 4>hanks great movie,</v>

2599
02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:55.040
<v Speaker 4>but that was the only time human beings </v>
<v Speaker 4>have been more than 400 miles from the </v>

2600
02:03:55.441 --> 02:03:58.870
<v Speaker 4>earth's surface.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every other gun back.</v>

2601
02:03:58.950 --> 02:04:00.150
<v Speaker 4>Not only,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we haven't gone back,</v>

2602
02:04:00.151 --> 02:04:02.580
<v Speaker 4>we never even left the magnetosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

2603
02:04:02.610 --> 02:04:05.250
<v Speaker 4>We've never gone through the van allen </v>
<v Speaker 4>radiation belts since then.</v>

2604
02:04:06.090 --> 02:04:11.090
<v Speaker 4>We never went into deep space like all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the way out and back like around the </v>

2605
02:04:11.090 --> 02:04:14.280
<v Speaker 4>Moon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They never even did like a fly by since </v>

2606
02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:16.011
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's insane how much it costs a </v>

2607
02:04:16.011 --> 02:04:16.350
<v Speaker 4>shitload of money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but so does the space shuttle.</v>

2608
02:04:16.890 --> 02:04:19.560
<v Speaker 4>So does the space station,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so does a lot of things.</v>

2609
02:04:20.010 --> 02:04:22.170
<v Speaker 4>He does cost a lot of money and that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>a good argument,</v>

2610
02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:25.380
<v Speaker 4>but it is weird that we still had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>space program from it.</v>

2611
02:04:25.381 --> 02:04:26.000
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

2612
02:04:26.070 --> 02:04:27.450
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that we didn't go,</v>

2613
02:04:27.451 --> 02:04:30.520
<v Speaker 4>but what I am saying is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is why that conspiracy.</v>

2614
02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2615
02:04:31.341 --> 02:04:36.341
<v Speaker 1>It's super crazy and that movie you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of go through and debunk the </v>

2616
02:04:36.341 --> 02:04:36.680
<v Speaker 1>lighting stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stars,</v>

2617
02:04:36.681 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 1>the van allen radiation belt thing,</v>

2618
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:39.530
<v Speaker 4>but then when it gets to that end </v>
<v Speaker 4>senior,</v>

2619
02:04:39.540 --> 02:04:41.710
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the hell is going on there?</v>

2620
02:04:41.770 --> 02:04:43.770
<v Speaker 4>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It reAlly is creepy with that guy.</v>

2621
02:04:45.330 --> 02:04:46.980
<v Speaker 4>He's very compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

2622
02:04:47.190 --> 02:04:52.190
<v Speaker 4>he was all in that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy who made that movie funny thing </v>

2623
02:04:52.190 --> 02:04:55.461
<v Speaker 4>happened on the way to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was when I was deep in the whole </v>

2624
02:04:55.461 --> 02:04:55.780
<v Speaker 4>moon landing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2625
02:04:55.800 --> 02:05:00.800
<v Speaker 4>but there was a first one that got me is</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was on news radio in the </v>

2626
02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:05.610
<v Speaker 4>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had a documentary on fox called </v>

2627
02:05:05.610 --> 02:05:06.750
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did we ever go to the moon?</v>

2628
02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:12.020
<v Speaker 4>And that one is really compelling and </v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the reasons why it's compelling </v>

2629
02:05:12.020 --> 02:05:15.461
<v Speaker 4>us because there's more than one </v>
<v Speaker 4>occasion where they used the exact same </v>

2630
02:05:15.461 --> 02:05:17.130
<v Speaker 4>backdrop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have the same backdrop,</v>

2631
02:05:17.131 --> 02:05:22.131
<v Speaker 4>but they were supposed to be on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>totally different part of the moon and </v>

2632
02:05:22.131 --> 02:05:22.920
<v Speaker 4>they had the exact same background where</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks fake as fuck.</v>

2633
02:05:23.630 --> 02:05:28.630
<v Speaker 4>You want to see something really fake </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking google astronauts on </v>

2634
02:05:28.630 --> 02:05:28.980
<v Speaker 4>trampolines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to see some ridiculous shit.</v>

2635
02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:34.400
<v Speaker 4>There's one one video clip did they did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now here's what someone explained to me </v>

2636
02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:36.960
<v Speaker 4>that it's entirely likely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this made a lot of sense,</v>

2637
02:05:37.170 --> 02:05:39.720
<v Speaker 4>that it's entirely likely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is during the nixon administration,</v>

2638
02:05:39.721 --> 02:05:40.830
<v Speaker 4>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was all going on.</v>

2639
02:05:40.831 --> 02:05:43.890
<v Speaker 4>Massive deception.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean nixon was just a fucking fraud in</v>

2640
02:05:43.891 --> 02:05:46.620
<v Speaker 4>every way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shape or form and a crook and a liar.</v>

2641
02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:52.400
<v Speaker 4>that it's entirely possible that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>filmed a lot of stuff and that they </v>

2642
02:05:52.831 --> 02:05:56.670
<v Speaker 4>filmed all this fake stuff and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>passed it off as the real footage,</v>

2643
02:05:56.790 --> 02:06:00.060
<v Speaker 4>but that they actually did go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they couldn't get footage of it.</v>

2644
02:06:00.270 --> 02:06:02.330
<v Speaker 4>And one of the reasons why they probably</v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't get footage of it,</v>

2645
02:06:02.370 --> 02:06:07.370
<v Speaker 4>if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that you can't even get that fucking </v>

2646
02:06:07.370 --> 02:06:08.070
<v Speaker 4>film through the radar detector at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>airport or the,</v>

2647
02:06:08.430 --> 02:06:09.170
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2648
02:06:09.210 --> 02:06:11.820
<v Speaker 4>the x ray machine at the airport without</v>
<v Speaker 4>killing it.</v>

2649
02:06:11.820 --> 02:06:16.820
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was looking at some stuff up on this </v>

2650
02:06:16.820 --> 02:06:16.820
<v Speaker 4>the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the van van van allen radiation belts,</v>

2651
02:06:17.700 --> 02:06:22.700
<v Speaker 4>the spaceship itself and all the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were wearing would've protected </v>

2652
02:06:22.700 --> 02:06:26.151
<v Speaker 4>them from most of the radiation that </v>
<v Speaker 4>would have potentially harmed them or </v>

2653
02:06:26.151 --> 02:06:26.550
<v Speaker 4>anything that allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

2654
02:06:26.620 --> 02:06:31.620
<v Speaker 4>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they also didn't go through what they </v>

2655
02:06:31.620 --> 02:06:31.620
<v Speaker 4>went through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the donut hole that's at the top.</v>

2656
02:06:31.620 --> 02:06:34.230
<v Speaker 4>Like the way the van allen radiation </v>
<v Speaker 4>belts apparently surrounded the earth.</v>

2657
02:06:34.530 --> 02:06:39.530
<v Speaker 4>It surrounds it like a doughnut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's an area where you can go </v>

2658
02:06:39.530 --> 02:06:39.530
<v Speaker 4>through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2659
02:06:39.530 --> 02:06:39.530
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2660
02:06:39.530 --> 02:06:40.260
<v Speaker 4>Well there's an area where you can go </v>
<v Speaker 4>through with.</v>

2661
02:06:40.261 --> 02:06:43.470
<v Speaker 4>They're only exposed to the radiation </v>
<v Speaker 4>for like an hour or something like that.</v>

2662
02:06:43.590 --> 02:06:48.590
<v Speaker 4>How,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean with all this deception back in </v>

2663
02:06:48.590 --> 02:06:49.740
<v Speaker 4>started from the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at this.</v>

2664
02:06:50.490 --> 02:06:51.840
<v Speaker 4>So this is.</v>

2665
02:06:54.660 --> 02:06:59.660
<v Speaker 4>This is when I was balls deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but look at this footage like what is </v>

2666
02:07:00.121 --> 02:07:02.400
<v Speaker 4>going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what is this guy doing?</v>

2667
02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:06.640
<v Speaker 4>So here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the physics back then they're.</v>

2668
02:07:06.650 --> 02:07:11.340
<v Speaker 4>They're not the same on every mission,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the way they move around.</v>

2669
02:07:11.341 --> 02:07:16.341
<v Speaker 4>It's not the same amount of palo 11 as </v>
<v Speaker 4>it is on apollo 16 or whatever the last </v>

2670
02:07:16.341 --> 02:07:18.360
<v Speaker 4>mission was that it looks different when</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're moving around,</v>

2671
02:07:18.660 --> 02:07:21.810
<v Speaker 4>but this one is the weirdest one because</v>
<v Speaker 4>here these guys are,</v>

2672
02:07:21.811 --> 02:07:26.811
<v Speaker 4>they're in one six earth's gravity and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's fucking juMping around through </v>

2673
02:07:26.811 --> 02:07:30.471
<v Speaker 4>the air and you can't see their feet </v>
<v Speaker 4>like you only see their feet when </v>

2674
02:07:30.471 --> 02:07:31.200
<v Speaker 4>they're in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just,</v>

2675
02:07:31.580 --> 02:07:36.580
<v Speaker 4>they were hiding behind this lunar </v>
<v Speaker 4>module and they're bouncing around in a </v>

2676
02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:36.580
<v Speaker 4>way that you never saw</v>

2677
02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:39.310
<v Speaker 2>them bounce around before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not in any other moon mission.</v>

2678
02:07:39.940 --> 02:07:44.940
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's entirely Possible that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they fake some stuff and that there </v>

2679
02:07:44.940 --> 02:07:47.890
<v Speaker 2>could have been an issue with them being</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the surface of the moon.</v>

2680
02:07:48.140 --> 02:07:53.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also being on the surface of the </v>

2681
02:07:53.140 --> 02:07:54.691
<v Speaker 2>moon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the radiation on the surface of the </v>

2682
02:07:54.691 --> 02:07:54.691
<v Speaker 2>moon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no protection to those cameras</v>

2683
02:07:54.691 --> 02:07:55.420
<v Speaker 2>and there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no magnetos fear.</v>

2684
02:07:55.421 --> 02:08:00.421
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those hassled bad cameras that they had </v>

2685
02:08:00.421 --> 02:08:00.421
<v Speaker 2>that they kept in the center of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>chests.</v>

2686
02:08:00.421 --> 02:08:01.930
<v Speaker 2>Those weird looking cameras that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>used.</v>

2687
02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:04.780
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing different about those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing protecting,</v>

2688
02:08:05.860 --> 02:08:07.480
<v Speaker 2>protecting us when I was reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2689
02:08:07.481 --> 02:08:09.630
<v Speaker 2>but not the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The camera was external.</v>

2690
02:08:09.700 --> 02:08:11.590
<v Speaker 2>It was in the suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This external.</v>

2691
02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:13.630
<v Speaker 2>It was like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was out in front of them.</v>

2692
02:08:13.690 --> 02:08:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

2693
02:08:14.381 --> 02:08:17.890
<v Speaker 2>I just read that the pentagon spent like</v>
<v Speaker 2>half a billion dollars on just fake isis</v>

2694
02:08:17.891 --> 02:08:21.760
<v Speaker 2>videos and propaganda videos for </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorist recruitment.</v>

2695
02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:23.140
<v Speaker 2>What do you know why they did that </v>
<v Speaker 2>though?</v>

2696
02:08:23.230 --> 02:08:28.230
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something that people bring up a </v>

2697
02:08:28.230 --> 02:08:28.230
<v Speaker 2>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a little misleading.</v>

2698
02:08:28.230 --> 02:08:32.220
<v Speaker 2>what they did was they made these videos</v>
<v Speaker 2>for real player and so when someone </v>

2699
02:08:32.220 --> 02:08:35.200
<v Speaker 2>would watch these videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would collect metadata,</v>

2700
02:08:35.201 --> 02:08:40.201
<v Speaker 2>so location the person was watching and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that way they could find out who is </v>

2701
02:08:40.201 --> 02:08:42.370
<v Speaker 2>watching these terrorists recruitment </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos and they get it.</v>

2702
02:08:42.820 --> 02:08:43.630
<v Speaker 2>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>

2703
02:08:43.660 --> 02:08:48.660
<v Speaker 2>but so is everything the government does</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like if they want to try to figure </v>

2704
02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:49.390
<v Speaker 2>out where isis was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have unlimited money.</v>

2705
02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:51.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean they can kind of do whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck they want.</v>

2706
02:08:51.641 --> 02:08:52.150
<v Speaker 2>someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2707
02:08:52.151 --> 02:08:57.151
<v Speaker 2>I've got an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll make these videos while these </v>

2708
02:08:57.151 --> 02:08:58.740
<v Speaker 2>terrorist recruitment videos and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything like that.</v>

2709
02:08:58.770 --> 02:09:00.340
<v Speaker 2>The garland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas,</v>

2710
02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:05.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that first isis attack and the us was </v>

2711
02:09:05.390 --> 02:09:08.101
<v Speaker 2>really an fba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once again it was an fbi informant to </v>

2712
02:09:08.101 --> 02:09:08.101
<v Speaker 2>fbi informants were on the scene.</v>

2713
02:09:08.101 --> 02:09:10.000
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't they stop the attack ballou </v>
<v Speaker 2>it guys.</v>

2714
02:09:10.050 --> 02:09:10.950
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2715
02:09:11.020 --> 02:09:11.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a better one,</v>

2716
02:09:11.950 --> 02:09:16.950
<v Speaker 2>but they do all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about that video that we were </v>

2717
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:20.140
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be led to believe was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason why they attack bengazi?</v>

2718
02:09:20.470 --> 02:09:22.580
<v Speaker 2>Remember that you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2719
02:09:22.581 --> 02:09:25.480
<v Speaker 2>I remember that fake video that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2720
02:09:26.270 --> 02:09:31.270
<v Speaker 2>that was about the movie and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>was saying everybody was saying that </v>

2721
02:09:31.270 --> 02:09:32.350
<v Speaker 2>that movie was the reason why they </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacked us,</v>

2722
02:09:32.740 --> 02:09:34.570
<v Speaker 2>which was a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They knew it was a lot.</v>

2723
02:09:34.660 --> 02:09:38.440
<v Speaker 2>They had a cia operation running weapons</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of this hub,</v>

2724
02:09:38.500 --> 02:09:39.040
<v Speaker 2>but they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2725
02:09:39.041 --> 02:09:41.310
<v Speaker 2>it's about a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone hates this movie.</v>

2726
02:09:41.930 --> 02:09:44.140
<v Speaker 2>Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're watched the movie now.</v>

2727
02:09:44.230 --> 02:09:46.730
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking unbelievably bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh god.</v>

2728
02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:48.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm so bad that you don't even believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's real movement.</v>

2729
02:09:48.941 --> 02:09:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Seems like create that movie too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would guess so.</v>

2730
02:09:52.540 --> 02:09:54.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would say probably.</v>

2731
02:09:55.090 --> 02:09:56.410
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2732
02:09:56.411 --> 02:09:59.170
<v Speaker 2>I would guess thing that bothers me </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the isis stuff is that,</v>

2733
02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:00.940
<v Speaker 2>like I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that 70,000</v>

2734
02:10:00.941 --> 02:10:05.941
<v Speaker 2>number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you could just say anything's </v>

2735
02:10:05.941 --> 02:10:07.711
<v Speaker 2>isis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isis gigs that we dropped them moab on </v>

2736
02:10:07.711 --> 02:10:07.711
<v Speaker 2>and it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2737
02:10:07.711 --> 02:10:10.030
<v Speaker 2>it's the nicest cave and that's why 70 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of americans support bombing the</v>

2738
02:10:10.031 --> 02:10:12.460
<v Speaker 2>shit out of Afghanistan because isis was</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2739
02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:17.760
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like there was more critical </v>

2740
02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:17.760
<v Speaker 2>thinking that people were upset that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were playing judge,</v>

2741
02:10:17.760 --> 02:10:22.140
<v Speaker 2>jury and executioner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think now we just kill isis and mass </v>

2742
02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:22.140
<v Speaker 2>and it's just no one questioned that at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

2743
02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:23.560
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like what we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about earlier.</v>

2744
02:10:23.561 --> 02:10:28.561
<v Speaker 2>There's just too much information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's too much going on and the they </v>

2745
02:10:28.561 --> 02:10:32.401
<v Speaker 2>bombed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They drop the mother of all bombs right </v>

2746
02:10:32.401 --> 02:10:34.070
<v Speaker 2>after we had accidentally killed a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people</v>

2747
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:36.410
<v Speaker 4>that were on our side in Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2748
02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:37.530
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

2749
02:10:37.580 --> 02:10:42.580
<v Speaker 4>that was like a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we had accidentally fucked up and </v>

2750
02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:43.240
<v Speaker 4>killed some syrian rebels and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ooh,</v>

2751
02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:44.800
<v Speaker 3>didn't he kill it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2752
02:10:44.890 --> 02:10:49.890
<v Speaker 3>We killed a bunch of people that we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>training in arming alqaeda and sees </v>

2753
02:10:49.890 --> 02:10:50.320
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2754
02:10:50.321 --> 02:10:52.180
<v Speaker 3>what trump learned after the Syria </v>
<v Speaker 3>strike,</v>

2755
02:10:52.181 --> 02:10:54.010
<v Speaker 3>he learned that he can get because all </v>
<v Speaker 3>he cares about,</v>

2756
02:10:54.011 --> 02:10:56.770
<v Speaker 3>he's like a little child wants positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>reinforcement and he hates,</v>

2757
02:10:56.771 --> 02:10:58.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fake news.</v>

2758
02:10:58.031 --> 02:10:58.930
<v Speaker 3>Cnn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you,</v>

2759
02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:04.080
<v Speaker 3>why don't you cover me fairly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goeS out there and does these press </v>

2760
02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:06.841
<v Speaker 3>conferences begging the news to cover </v>
<v Speaker 3>him better because that's all he cares </v>

2761
02:11:06.841 --> 02:11:09.841
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's what he learned is that he </v>

2762
02:11:09.841 --> 02:11:11.521
<v Speaker 3>can get bipartisan support and praise </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the media if you just bombed the </v>

2763
02:11:11.521 --> 02:11:12.550
<v Speaker 3>shit out of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what he learns.</v>

2764
02:11:12.551 --> 02:11:14.590
<v Speaker 3>So then he dropped the moab and what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>next?</v>

2765
02:11:14.591 --> 02:11:16.720
<v Speaker 3>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you know now how to be popular,</v>

2766
02:11:16.900 --> 02:11:21.900
<v Speaker 3>just like reagan came in and was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was seen as a joke until he got swept </v>

2767
02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:25.651
<v Speaker 3>into the military industrial complex and</v>
<v Speaker 3>became a war president and I think that </v>

2768
02:11:25.651 --> 02:11:29.401
<v Speaker 3>trump came in as a reality star </v>
<v Speaker 3>president joke and he's surrounded </v>

2769
02:11:29.401 --> 02:11:33.391
<v Speaker 3>himself with more generals than any </v>
<v Speaker 3>other president since world war ii and </v>

2770
02:11:33.391 --> 02:11:35.580
<v Speaker 3>he's just letting them lead him wherever</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want and,</v>

2771
02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:40.600
<v Speaker 3>and of course general just want to be in</v>
<v Speaker 3>charge of of conflicts so they can get </v>

2772
02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:43.970
<v Speaker 3>more stars and emblems and honors and </v>
<v Speaker 3>lead us into different things.</v>

2773
02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:46.900
<v Speaker 3>That's theIr career to bring this up </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier.</v>

2774
02:11:46.901 --> 02:11:47.530
<v Speaker 3>But I forgot</v>

2775
02:11:48.890 --> 02:11:51.800
<v Speaker 4>that was one of the things that was most</v>
<v Speaker 4>creepy is that he's saying he's going to</v>

2776
02:11:51.801 --> 02:11:53.900
<v Speaker 4>let the military do their job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2777
02:11:53.901 --> 02:11:58.070
<v Speaker 4>like oversight of the military is what </v>
<v Speaker 4>eisenhower warned us about at the end of</v>

2778
02:11:58.071 --> 02:11:59.180
<v Speaker 4>his term.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2779
02:11:59.210 --> 02:12:04.210
<v Speaker 4>remember when eisenhower was leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he talked about the military industrial </v>

2780
02:12:04.210 --> 02:12:04.430
<v Speaker 4>complex and everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

2781
02:12:04.730 --> 02:12:09.730
<v Speaker 4>But that was something that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>broadcast on television and back in the </v>

2782
02:12:09.730 --> 02:12:10.580
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's when it ended.</v>

2783
02:12:10.610 --> 02:12:15.610
<v Speaker 4>It was broadcast on tv.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people listened and then business </v>

2784
02:12:15.610 --> 02:12:18.851
<v Speaker 4>went about as usual and it wasn't like </v>
<v Speaker 4>today where you could watch that video </v>

2785
02:12:18.851 --> 02:12:20.300
<v Speaker 4>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you see that video,</v>

2786
02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:23.810
<v Speaker 4>eisenhower saying military,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are industrial complex.</v>

2787
02:12:24.260 --> 02:12:24.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2788
02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:27.390
<v Speaker 3>Trump is now adding 10 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking budget,</v>

2789
02:12:27.391 --> 02:12:30.330
<v Speaker 3>cutting all of these agencies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>bolstering the pentagon even more.</v>

2790
02:12:30.331 --> 02:12:32.640
<v Speaker 3>We already have the biggest military in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the goddamn world.</v>

2791
02:12:32.641 --> 02:12:34.200
<v Speaker 3>Bigger than the next 10 countries </v>
<v Speaker 3>combined.</v>

2792
02:12:34.201 --> 02:12:36.480
<v Speaker 3>Why is this happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is whAt makes America great.</v>

2793
02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:40.890
<v Speaker 3>Just reverting back to like a completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>disgusting.</v>

2794
02:12:41.070 --> 02:12:42.030
<v Speaker 3>It's sick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2795
02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:43.120
<v Speaker 4>What do we do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>abby martin,</v>

2796

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2797
02:12:44.830 --> 02:12:47.080
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if president abby gets selected,</v>

2798
02:12:47.500 --> 02:12:48.130
<v Speaker 4>what do we do?</v>

2799
02:12:48.510 --> 02:12:49.260
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first,</v>

2800
02:12:49.261 --> 02:12:51.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>abolish money in politics and start some</v>

2801
02:12:51.781 --> 02:12:56.781
<v Speaker 3>sort of true democratic representation </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you have simple laws to prosecute </v>

2802
02:12:56.781 --> 02:13:01.070
<v Speaker 3>criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not they have money or </v>

2803
02:13:01.070 --> 02:13:01.070
<v Speaker 3>they're billionaires.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're a corporate criminal,</v>

2804
02:13:01.070 --> 02:13:04.671
<v Speaker 3>you got to fucking jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you pull it sounds like suicide by </v>

2805
02:13:07.170 --> 02:13:09.420
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sick,</v>

2806
02:13:09.421 --> 02:13:09.940
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2807
02:13:10.060 --> 02:13:10.860
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2808
02:13:10.861 --> 02:13:11.910
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to say,</v>

2809
02:13:11.911 --> 02:13:16.911
<v Speaker 3>but I just know that trump has taken us </v>
<v Speaker 3>down a very dangerous path and these </v>

2810
02:13:16.911 --> 02:13:17.100
<v Speaker 3>people who are thinking that he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow anti empire,</v>

2811
02:13:17.101 --> 02:13:20.580
<v Speaker 3>andy deep state are very confuse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bannon iS a psycho.</v>

2812
02:13:20.581 --> 02:13:22.710
<v Speaker 3>Bannon wants war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wants war with China,</v>

2813
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:27.870
<v Speaker 3>but it's naomi outs know the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's just on paper because </v>

2814
02:13:27.870 --> 02:13:31.251
<v Speaker 3>trump didn't like people calling him </v>
<v Speaker 3>president bannon and so he's still </v>

2815
02:13:31.251 --> 02:13:31.830
<v Speaker 3>attending the national security council.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He still has a say.</v>

2816
02:13:31.831 --> 02:13:35.310
<v Speaker 3>We know that he really is him and these </v>
<v Speaker 3>billionaires,</v>

2817
02:13:35.311 --> 02:13:38.310
<v Speaker 3>Robert Mercer in the koch brothers who </v>
<v Speaker 3>have somehow aren't globalists,</v>

2818
02:13:38.311 --> 02:13:43.311
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they really are backing bannon and </v>

2819
02:13:43.311 --> 02:13:43.311
<v Speaker 3>trump and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2820
02:13:43.311 --> 02:13:44.790
<v Speaker 3>they hedge their bets band and tried to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do it before with pailin,</v>

2821
02:13:44.791 --> 02:13:49.791
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he saw sarah pailin is like the trump </v>

2822
02:13:49.791 --> 02:13:53.301
<v Speaker 3>one point zero and made this giant movie</v>
<v Speaker 3>about her and try to latch onto her and </v>

2823
02:13:53.301 --> 02:13:54.130
<v Speaker 3>then she flopped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She saw,</v>

2824
02:13:54.230 --> 02:13:58.680
<v Speaker 3>sure what with pailin with ted nugent,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Trump in the oval.</v>

2827
02:14:05.850 --> 02:14:10.850
<v Speaker 6>This is idiocracy idiocracy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like a fucking bass pro shop video,</v>

2828
02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:15.700
<v Speaker 6>a photo from a cabela's catalog.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2829
02:14:15.701 --> 02:14:20.701
<v Speaker 6>it's hilarious when you look at the five</v>
<v Speaker 6>of them next to trump and when you were </v>

2830
02:14:20.701 --> 02:14:25.441
<v Speaker 6>saying the military do your job,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's already like changed the rules of </v>

2831
02:14:25.441 --> 02:14:27.850
<v Speaker 6>engagement where we look for kIlling a </v>
<v Speaker 6>thousand civilians to be killed.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Didn't hear a peep about it from the </v>

2836
02:14:38.841 --> 02:14:38.970
<v Speaker 3>mainstream media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just move onto the next one.</v>

2837
02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:40.850
<v Speaker 3>The photo then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Israel where he was talking about why </v>
<v Speaker 3>Israel deserves to exist and stuff after</v>

2871
02:15:54.721 --> 02:15:55.590
<v Speaker 3>being there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

2873
02:15:58.740 --> 02:16:03.740
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know what the hell is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on until I went to palestine and </v>

2874
02:16:03.740 --> 02:16:03.740
<v Speaker 3>saw how crazy it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what is it like?</v>

<v Speaker 3>controls palestine.</v>

2877
02:16:09.210 --> 02:16:10.590
<v Speaker 3>That's not true at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

2878
02:16:10.620 --> 02:16:14.100
<v Speaker 3>there's three different areas that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>drawn up with the original partition.</v>

2879
02:16:14.101 --> 02:16:19.101
<v Speaker 3>It's the west bank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is totally under military rule by </v>

2880
02:16:19.101 --> 02:16:20.430
<v Speaker 3>Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's the gaza strip,</v>

2881
02:16:20.431 --> 02:16:25.431
<v Speaker 3>which is like the open air prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they bombed the shit out of like </v>

2882
02:16:25.431 --> 02:16:26.130
<v Speaker 3>every couple of years and hamas controls</v>
<v Speaker 3>that area.</v>

2883
02:16:26.310 --> 02:16:28.680
<v Speaker 3>And then there's jerusalem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is an international city center,</v>

2884
02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:30.910
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that both arabs and jews live in.</v>

2885
02:16:30.910 --> 02:16:34.510
<v Speaker 3>But the westbank has been occupied </v>
<v Speaker 3>militarily since 1967.</v>

2886
02:16:34.511 --> 02:16:36.970
<v Speaker 3>And it's complete martial law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's checkpoints.</v>

2887
02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:40.600
<v Speaker 3>All political parties are illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

2888
02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:43.990
<v Speaker 3>having a gun is like the least of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't hold a flag.</v>

2889
02:16:44.020 --> 02:16:49.020
<v Speaker 3>You can't belong to a political party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You literally can't do shit if you're a </v>

2890
02:16:49.020 --> 02:16:52.681
<v Speaker 3>palestinian.</v>

<v Speaker 3>'em.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if even if you share a photo of </v>

2892
02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:55.240
<v Speaker 3>someone who was killed by an israeli </v>
<v Speaker 3>soldier,</v>

2893
02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:56.630
<v Speaker 3>you go to jail and you go to jail for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of,</v>

02:16:56.631 --> 02:16:58.180
<v Speaker 3>like months that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2895
02:16:58.360 --> 02:17:00.220
<v Speaker 3>based on the shares and likes of the </v>

2896
02:17:00.221 --> 02:17:02.110
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll penalize you more and put you in</v>

2897
02:17:02.111 --> 02:17:03.610
<v Speaker 3>prison for longer and longer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2898
02:17:03.650 --> 02:17:06.680
<v Speaker 3>I'll just tell you one story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put a photo on social media like you put</v>

2899

<v Speaker 3>someone who died and there'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're sharing a martyr and inciting </v>

2900
02:17:11.710 --> 02:17:11.710
<v Speaker 3>people to like commit suicide.</v>

2901
02:17:11.710 --> 02:17:16.200
<v Speaker 3>Like on behalf of palestinians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go to jail and they put them in </v>

2902
02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:19.231
<v Speaker 3>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a 99 point seven percent </v>

2903
02:17:19.231 --> 02:17:19.231
<v Speaker 3>conviction rate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kids are tortured,</v>

2904
02:17:19.231 --> 02:17:21.280
<v Speaker 3>kids are in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is absolutely insane.</v>

2905
02:17:21.281 --> 02:17:23.560
<v Speaker 3>We went to the first day that we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2906
02:17:24.010 --> 02:17:29.010

<v Speaker 3>some farmer who was shot by israeli </v>

2907
02:17:29.010 --> 02:17:29.080
<v Speaker 3>forces and we went to the funeral is </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the women are wailing and crying and</v>

2909
02:17:32.410 --> 02:17:37.410
<v Speaker 3>as relieving the israeli forces had set </v>
<v Speaker 3>up a checkpoint right outside of this </v>

2910
02:17:37.410 --> 02:17:39.760
<v Speaker 3>dude's house and started tear gassing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and shooting rubber bullets.</v>

2911
02:17:39.761 --> 02:17:44.761
<v Speaker 3>I get people who were simply attending </v>
<v Speaker 3>the funeral just to punish people for </v>

2912
02:17:44.761 --> 02:17:45.330
<v Speaker 3>attending the funeral.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2913
02:17:45.340 --> 02:17:48.070
<v Speaker 3>we went to another girl's house named </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] who's a,</v>

2914
02:17:48.370 --> 02:17:53.370

2916
02:17:55.840 --> 02:17:57.610
<v Speaker 3>they shot 200 people that day.</v>

2917
02:17:57.640 --> 02:18:00.220
<v Speaker 3>One guy next to her diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another guy who was paralyzed,</v>

2918
02:18:00.580 --> 02:18:05.580
<v Speaker 3>they have a policy called shoot to </v>
<v Speaker 3>cripple where they shoot guys in the </v>

2919
02:18:05.580 --> 02:18:06.700
<v Speaker 3>dicks is fucking nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2920
02:18:06.730 --> 02:18:11.730
<v Speaker 3>The west bank is no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that I was going to die </v>

2921
02:18:11.730 --> 02:18:11.730
<v Speaker 3>several times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were at this checkpoint going through</v>

2922
02:18:11.730 --> 02:18:16.291
<v Speaker 3>calandria and there was this old man </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking like clearly drunk or something </v>

2923
02:18:16.291 --> 02:18:17.270
<v Speaker 3>and kind of walking a little bit toward </v>
<v Speaker 3>the checkbook.</v>

2924
02:18:17.290 --> 02:18:20.560
<v Speaker 3>They started shooting at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bolts are ricocheting off the thing.</v>

2925
02:18:21.250 --> 02:18:22.630
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2926
02:18:22.631 --> 02:18:26.320
<v Speaker 3>my partner mike who was an invading </v>
<v Speaker 3>soldier of Iraq was just like,</v>

2927
02:18:26.321 --> 02:18:27.910
<v Speaker 3>we're gonna die like they're shooting </v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

2928
02:18:27.911 --> 02:18:29.130
<v Speaker 3>there's bullets ricocheted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

2929
02:18:29.140 --> 02:18:31.960
<v Speaker 3>It was absolutely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as we go through the checkpoint,</v>

2930
02:18:31.961 --> 02:18:32.620
<v Speaker 3>the soldiers like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2931
02:18:32.621 --> 02:18:35.140
<v Speaker 3>stay safe out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

2932
02:18:35.141 --> 02:18:40.141
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you guys are arbitrarily shooting </v>

2933
02:18:40.141 --> 02:18:40.141
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2934
02:18:40.141 --> 02:18:43.631
<v Speaker 3>and the person who was driving us had </v>
<v Speaker 3>just told us that a couple months prior </v>

2935
02:18:43.631 --> 02:18:44.380
<v Speaker 3>to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some woman,</v>

2936
02:18:44.381 --> 02:18:46.270
<v Speaker 3>palestinian woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can't go to jerusalem,</v>

2937
02:18:46.271 --> 02:18:51.271
<v Speaker 3>like if you're a palestinian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's barely any palestinians were </v>

2938
02:18:51.271 --> 02:18:51.271
<v Speaker 3>even allowed to go pray at the most holy</v>
<v Speaker 3>site,</v>

2939
02:18:51.271 --> 02:18:53.620
<v Speaker 3>the dome of the rock and jerusalem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't go to the beach,</v>

2940
02:18:53.621 --> 02:18:56.680
<v Speaker 3>you're just completely constricted in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>prison and you can't travel.</v>

2941
02:18:56.680 --> 02:19:01.680
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was just telling us that months </v>

2942
02:19:01.680 --> 02:19:01.680
<v Speaker 3>before we went through this checkpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone was going through the checkpoint</v>

2943
02:19:01.680 --> 02:19:02.230
<v Speaker 3>because they got a permit to go into </v>
<v Speaker 3>jerusalem,</v>

2944
02:19:02.231 --> 02:19:06.190
<v Speaker 3>which is like a lifetime golden ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like willy wonka and they're walking and</v>

2945
02:19:06.191 --> 02:19:08.820
<v Speaker 3>they get and she just got executed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then yeah,</v>

2946
02:19:08.860 --> 02:19:11.650
<v Speaker 3>she just got executed and she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>bleeding out at this checkpoint.</v>

2947
02:19:11.651 --> 02:19:14.350
<v Speaker 3>And her little brother tried to help her</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they shot him too.</v>

2948
02:19:14.351 --> 02:19:16.930
<v Speaker 3>And they're like hiding the video of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

2949
02:19:16.931 --> 02:19:21.931
<v Speaker 3>And this is just a day because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking hate palestinians and </v>

2950
02:19:21.931 --> 02:19:21.931
<v Speaker 3>palestinians are our animals to these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2951

<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>

2953
02:19:24.941 --> 02:19:26.150
<v Speaker 3>really sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe and I,</v>

2954
02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:31.200
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't even get into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were banned from going into this </v>

2955
02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:33.761
<v Speaker 3>territory because I was told by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>israeli government that I was a </v>

2956
02:19:33.761 --> 02:19:37.151
<v Speaker 3>propagandist and that I was like an </v>
<v Speaker 3>enemy agent and so I wasn't allowed to </v>

2957
02:19:37.151 --> 02:19:38.510
<v Speaker 3>go into gaza,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so gaza's hell,</v>

2958
02:19:38.511 --> 02:19:43.511
<v Speaker 3>but the west bank is an under martial </v>
<v Speaker 3>law and everything's illegal and you </v>

2959
02:19:43.511 --> 02:19:44.600
<v Speaker 3>can't do a goddamn thing and it's super </v>
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

2960
02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:47.210
<v Speaker 3>Like we went to this place called ramola</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was just like,</v>

2961
02:19:47.211 --> 02:19:49.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oakland and where they're smoking weed,</v>

2962
02:19:50.030 --> 02:19:51.860
<v Speaker 3>there's like openly gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

2963
02:19:51.861 --> 02:19:55.400
<v Speaker 3>it's just completely different than what</v>
<v Speaker 3>people think of palestine.</v>

2964
02:19:55.550 --> 02:20:00.550
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people think of it as just a bunch of </v>

2965
02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:00.750
<v Speaker 3>people with turbans on blown and hamas </v>
<v Speaker 3>is like,</v>

2966
02:20:00.770 --> 02:20:03.740
<v Speaker 3>yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you elected hamas and hamas doesn't want</v>

2967
02:20:03.741 --> 02:20:04.580
<v Speaker 3>Israel to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2968
02:20:04.581 --> 02:20:09.581
<v Speaker 3>well actually hamas is controlling this </v>
<v Speaker 3>one area for a reason because it was </v>

2969
02:20:09.581 --> 02:20:11.690
<v Speaker 3>built as this surplus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When Israel was created,</v>

2970
02:20:12.020 --> 02:20:16.010
<v Speaker 3>millions of refugees were put miles away</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the homes that they were ethnically</v>

2971
02:20:16.011 --> 02:20:18.830
<v Speaker 3>cleansed from and put into refugee camps</v>
<v Speaker 3>in gaza.</v>

2972
02:20:19.220 --> 02:20:21.800
<v Speaker 3>And when the israeli military wanted </v>
<v Speaker 3>more and more land,</v>

2973
02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:24.740
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all settlements in Israel are illegal.</v>

2974
02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:26.990
<v Speaker 3>All of them are illegal in the west </v>
<v Speaker 3>bank,</v>

2975
02:20:26.991 --> 02:20:31.991
<v Speaker 3>but they just keep creating more and </v>
<v Speaker 3>more and more and we would go to these </v>

2976
02:20:31.991 --> 02:20:34.511
<v Speaker 3>villages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have just arab people living in these </v>

2977
02:20:34.511 --> 02:20:34.511
<v Speaker 3>villages and the settlers will come.</v>

2978
02:20:34.511 --> 02:20:38.470
<v Speaker 3>You have to be a fanatical fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>asshole to move from California to an </v>

2979
02:20:38.470 --> 02:20:41.630
<v Speaker 3>arab village in palestine and setup a </v>
<v Speaker 3>goddamn tractor trailer and just live on</v>

2980
02:20:41.631 --> 02:20:45.560
<v Speaker 3>top of their home and they can have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>giant machine guns.</v>

2981
02:20:45.561 --> 02:20:47.390
<v Speaker 3>They can fire bomb you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can shoot you,</v>

2982
02:20:47.391 --> 02:20:49.610
<v Speaker 3>they can beat you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're protected by the state.</v>

2983
02:20:49.611 --> 02:20:51.500
<v Speaker 3>You can go with a tractor trailer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>set up a home.</v>

2984
02:20:52.010 --> 02:20:57.010
<v Speaker 3>The state immediately runs a waterline </v>
<v Speaker 3>of power line and a military outpost to </v>

2985
02:20:57.010 --> 02:21:00.911
<v Speaker 3>protect you and the arabs are just </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting there waiting to get killed or </v>

2986
02:21:00.911 --> 02:21:04.751
<v Speaker 3>attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely insane and the way home </v>

2987
02:21:04.751 --> 02:21:08.651
<v Speaker 3>demolitions worker in st louis because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they either deliver a piece of paper </v>

2988
02:21:08.651 --> 02:21:09.170
<v Speaker 3>with a rock over it and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

2989
02:21:09.171 --> 02:21:12.080
<v Speaker 3>if you find it good for you and if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

2990
02:21:12.081 --> 02:21:14.090
<v Speaker 3>then you're screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's if you're lucky.</v>

2991
02:21:14.091 --> 02:21:15.040
<v Speaker 3>If you're not lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll just.</v>

2992
02:21:15.050 --> 02:21:19.580
<v Speaker 3>Your home will be invaded by settlers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you'll be forced out of your home.</v>

2993
02:21:19.581 --> 02:21:24.581
<v Speaker 3>There's videos of this all over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>internet of like groups of settlers </v>

2994
02:21:24.581 --> 02:21:26.870
<v Speaker 3>going and literally taking over arabs </v>
<v Speaker 3>homes and then they just are forced out.</v>

2995
02:21:27.140 --> 02:21:28.130
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2996
02:21:28.131 --> 02:21:33.131
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's completely way crazier than I ever </v>

2997
02:21:33.131 --> 02:21:33.131
<v Speaker 3>could have imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long were you over there?</v>

2998
02:21:33.131 --> 02:21:33.131
<v Speaker 3>For?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A month.</v>

2999
02:21:33.730 --> 02:21:35.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3000
02:21:35.750 --> 02:21:36.470
<v Speaker 3>And we were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3001
02:21:36.540 --> 02:21:39.140
<v Speaker 3>we were simply and people want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>quabble about like,</v>

3002
02:21:39.141 --> 02:21:40.120
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not apartheid.</v>

3003
02:21:40.130 --> 02:21:42.860
<v Speaker 3>There are different fucking license </v>
<v Speaker 3>plates for arabs and jews,</v>

3004
02:21:42.861 --> 02:21:47.861
<v Speaker 3>like you cannot go to areas like israeli</v>
<v Speaker 3>soldiers were arbitrarily set up </v>

3005
02:21:48.351 --> 02:21:51.080
<v Speaker 3>checkpoints in just shut you out of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood and force you to walk three</v>

3006
02:21:51.081 --> 02:21:56.081
<v Speaker 3>miles to your home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they can do whatever they want </v>

3007
02:21:56.081 --> 02:21:56.150
<v Speaker 3>because you are under martial law and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

3008
02:21:56.151 --> 02:21:58.310
<v Speaker 3>you have no mobility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you have no freedom.</v>

3009
02:21:58.700 --> 02:22:00.290
<v Speaker 3>so it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really bad.</v>

3010
02:22:00.410 --> 02:22:05.410
<v Speaker 3>And we just did a whole series on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>empire files talking about how Israel </v>

3011
02:22:05.410 --> 02:22:06.320
<v Speaker 3>was created up until today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we go over like the settlements,</v>

3012
02:22:06.321 --> 02:22:08.540
<v Speaker 3>the demolitions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the jail,</v>

3013
02:22:08.541 --> 02:22:12.740
<v Speaker 3>and why I think there's no hope from </v>
<v Speaker 3>within israeli society to change because</v>

3014
02:22:12.741 --> 02:22:17.741
<v Speaker 3>it's becoming a more theocratic state </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a more fascist state as it grows </v>

3015
02:22:17.741 --> 02:22:22.391
<v Speaker 3>because you have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To maintain this jewish supremacist </v>

3016
02:22:22.391 --> 02:22:25.780
<v Speaker 3>state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be like more fascist and </v>

3017
02:22:25.780 --> 02:22:28.781
<v Speaker 3>more controlling and more militaristic </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the way that you rule society just </v>

3018
02:22:29.671 --> 02:22:34.671
<v Speaker 3>like the us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean people who are conSidered </v>

3019
02:22:34.671 --> 02:22:36.531
<v Speaker 3>outlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fringe assholes 30 years ago are now </v>

3020
02:22:36.531 --> 02:22:37.170
<v Speaker 3>like the christian evangelicals are now </v>
<v Speaker 3>in power.</v>

3021
02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:39.480
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really crazy.</v>

3022
02:22:39.481 --> 02:22:42.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not the same because Israel </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a white nationalist,</v>

3023
02:22:43.020 --> 02:22:48.020
<v Speaker 3>ethno supremacist state and you see the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way that they treat ethiopians and </v>

3024
02:22:48.930 --> 02:22:53.930
<v Speaker 3>african refugees and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it becomes obvious that even if </v>

3025
02:22:53.930 --> 02:22:56.811
<v Speaker 3>you're a jew and you're black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still are a second class citizen </v>

3026
02:22:56.811 --> 02:22:56.811
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

3027
02:22:56.811 --> 02:22:59.700
<v Speaker 3>Have you interviewed anybody that's pro </v>
<v Speaker 3>Israel to interview a lot of israelis?</v>

3028
02:22:59.730 --> 02:23:02.290
<v Speaker 3>And what did you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I interviewed a lot of israelis.</v>

3029
02:23:02.820 --> 02:23:04.890
<v Speaker 3>It seems like a lot of israelis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3030
02:23:04.891 --> 02:23:09.030
<v Speaker 3>think about this in order to really </v>
<v Speaker 3>reject the notion like you,</v>

3031
02:23:09.031 --> 02:23:12.720
<v Speaker 3>it's like rejecting being an american </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's such a hard thing for people to</v>

3032
02:23:12.721 --> 02:23:17.721
<v Speaker 3>really accept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a huge mobilization within </v>

3033
02:23:17.721 --> 02:23:20.481
<v Speaker 3>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who are opposed to the military </v>

3034
02:23:20.481 --> 02:23:20.481
<v Speaker 3>who talk openly about how awful the </v>
<v Speaker 3>occupation is,</v>

3035
02:23:20.481 --> 02:23:21.790
<v Speaker 3>how brutal it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they,</v>

3036
02:23:21.810 --> 02:23:23.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the crimes they committed,</v>

3037
02:23:23.850 --> 02:23:28.850
<v Speaker 3>but you'll very rarely find anti </v>
<v Speaker 3>zionists who will come out and say that </v>

3038
02:23:28.850 --> 02:23:32.600
<v Speaker 3>the notion of a jewish state is wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>because then it means you're just </v>

3039
02:23:32.600 --> 02:23:33.650
<v Speaker 3>rejecting everything that you are and </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3040
02:23:33.930 --> 02:23:37.500
<v Speaker 3>who are you then if you're an israeli </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you are not zionist,</v>

3041
02:23:37.560 --> 02:23:38.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3042
02:23:38.940 --> 02:23:41.220
<v Speaker 3>it's just a really hard notion for you </v>
<v Speaker 3>to wrap your mind around.</v>

3043
02:23:41.220 --> 02:23:43.810
<v Speaker 3>But we interviewed about 40 israelis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man on the streets and,</v>

3044
02:23:43.811 --> 02:23:48.811
<v Speaker 3>and to be leftist as a slur.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like a lot of israelis don't even </v>

3045
02:23:48.811 --> 02:23:49.680
<v Speaker 3>entertain the notion of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3046
02:23:49.681 --> 02:23:51.480
<v Speaker 3>maybe there shouldn't be an occupation </v>
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>

3047
02:23:51.510 --> 02:23:52.410
<v Speaker 3>They're all just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3048
02:23:52.411 --> 02:23:55.290
<v Speaker 3>well maybe we should have a more humane </v>
<v Speaker 3>occupation.</v>

3049
02:23:55.291 --> 02:24:00.291
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we should give them water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe they should have their own </v>

3050
02:24:00.291 --> 02:24:01.170
<v Speaker 3>water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saying the occupation,</v>

3051
02:24:01.350 --> 02:24:06.350
<v Speaker 3>occupation of palestine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the west bank of the west bank has </v>

3052
02:24:06.350 --> 02:24:10.790
<v Speaker 3>been militarily occupied for since 67.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when Israel was created in 48,</v>

3053
02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:15.060
<v Speaker 3>there were those three partitioned to </v>
<v Speaker 3>areas that I talked about and ever since</v>

3054
02:24:15.061 --> 02:24:20.061
<v Speaker 3>that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Israel has just continued to take over </v>

3055
02:24:20.061 --> 02:24:23.091
<v Speaker 3>more and more land in the west bank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>so these settlements just keep growing </v>

3056
02:24:23.091 --> 02:24:23.091
<v Speaker 3>and growing and growing and growing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3057
02:24:23.091 --> 02:24:23.970
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3058
02:24:23.971 --> 02:24:28.971
<v Speaker 3>over time there was mass resistances </v>
<v Speaker 3>that happen and then in 67 Israel was </v>

3059
02:24:28.971 --> 02:24:33.441
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just gonna do a large scale </v>

3060
02:24:33.441 --> 02:24:34.551
<v Speaker 3>invasion and try to take over all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>land and then they just stayed and </v>

3061
02:24:34.551 --> 02:24:34.551
<v Speaker 3>occupied this area and they just had </v>
<v Speaker 3>been there ever since.</v>

3062
02:24:34.650 --> 02:24:39.650
<v Speaker 3>And so that's like the huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>international crime when the </v>

3063
02:24:39.650 --> 02:24:40.140
<v Speaker 3>international community is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way these settlements are illegal</v>

3064
02:24:40.141 --> 02:24:45.141
<v Speaker 3>and we're like condemning you at the un </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the us just vetoes it every time </v>

3065
02:24:45.141 --> 02:24:47.010
<v Speaker 3>because the us is just like boys with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Israel unconditionally.</v>

3066
02:24:47.820 --> 02:24:52.820
<v Speaker 3>It's sick man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they just sign that </v>

3067
02:24:52.820 --> 02:24:54.561
<v Speaker 3>$10,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>aid package given it to Israel for the </v>

3068
02:24:54.561 --> 02:24:55.770
<v Speaker 3>next 10 years is I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was $30,000,000,000</v>

3069
02:24:55.771 --> 02:25:00.771
<v Speaker 3>over the next 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy because this would never </v>

3070
02:25:00.771 --> 02:25:02.580
<v Speaker 3>be able to happen if it weren't just </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely supported by the us.</v>

3071
02:25:02.730 --> 02:25:05.310
<v Speaker 3>And why is this us?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3072
02:25:05.370 --> 02:25:10.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the us loves using Israel </v>

3073
02:25:10.370 --> 02:25:13.101
<v Speaker 3>as a military garrison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love usIng that strategic point in </v>

3074
02:25:13.101 --> 02:25:13.860
<v Speaker 3>the middle east to have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3075
02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:17.340
<v Speaker 3>and also someone was shedding some </v>
<v Speaker 3>light.</v>

3076
02:25:17.370 --> 02:25:19.740
<v Speaker 3>This israeli soldier that I interviewed </v>
<v Speaker 3>who was amazing,</v>

3077
02:25:19.741 --> 02:25:23.740
<v Speaker 3>his name is ronna ferrante and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling me that the military aid package</v>

3078
02:25:23.741 --> 02:25:26.440
<v Speaker 3>that we just signed with Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it may look like just a gift.</v>

3079
02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:28.130
<v Speaker 3>Israel were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's $30,000,000,000.</v>

3080
02:25:28.131 --> 02:25:29.650
<v Speaker 3>But he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really what it was doing,</v>

3081
02:25:30.100 --> 02:25:35.100
<v Speaker 3>Israel has been its own arms dealer it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually is one of the number number </v>

3082
02:25:35.100 --> 02:25:38.260
<v Speaker 3>one weapons dealers in the world now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It actually did like this huge deal with</v>

3083
02:25:38.261 --> 02:25:40.480
<v Speaker 3>India.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the us felt threatened,</v>

3084
02:25:40.870 --> 02:25:42.760
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because we're the military might.</v>

3085
02:25:42.761 --> 02:25:45.670
<v Speaker 3>And so we kind of locked in Israel with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this giant packet and we're like,</v>

3086
02:25:45.671 --> 02:25:48.430
<v Speaker 3>you have to buy us armaments through </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

3087
02:25:48.610 --> 02:25:50.890
<v Speaker 3>so if you accept this $30,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>a deal,</v>

3088
02:25:51.250 --> 02:25:56.250
<v Speaker 3>you have to go through our military like</v>
<v Speaker 3>weapons to buy if you want this money.</v>

3089
02:25:56.681 --> 02:26:01.681
<v Speaker 3>So that's what this guy was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said it's actually a gift to us that </v>

3090
02:26:01.681 --> 02:26:05.200
<v Speaker 3>we're locking down like our control over</v>
<v Speaker 3>this country.</v>

3091
02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:10.030
<v Speaker 3>But honestly it's becoming so unpopular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama had a big feud with netanyahu.</v>

3092
02:26:10.031 --> 02:26:15.031
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump is disgusting because jared </v>

3093
02:26:15.031 --> 02:26:15.031
<v Speaker 3>kushner is personally invested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal settlements.</v>

3094
02:26:15.031 --> 02:26:16.850
<v Speaker 3>And he like his boys with netanyahu </v>
<v Speaker 3>financial.</v>

3095
02:26:16.950 --> 02:26:19.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cushner foundation.</v>

3096
02:26:19.031 --> 02:26:21.600
<v Speaker 3>Like his family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his actual foundation has funded illegal</v>

3097
02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:26.290
<v Speaker 3>settlements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you fund some charity in gaza,</v>

3098
02:26:26.291 --> 02:26:28.810
<v Speaker 3>you will go to jail for supporting </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorism.</v>

3099
02:26:28.811 --> 02:26:33.811
<v Speaker 3>But you can go fund the legal </v>
<v Speaker 3>settlements and sponsor settlers to go </v>

3100
02:26:33.811 --> 02:26:35.650
<v Speaker 3>and live on top of arab villages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's fine.</v>

3101
02:26:35.710 --> 02:26:40.710
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that most people just </v>

3102
02:26:40.710 --> 02:26:40.710
<v Speaker 3>aren't aware?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3103
02:26:40.710 --> 02:26:44.010
<v Speaker 3>I didN't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea how crazy it wasn't for a </v>

3104
02:26:44.010 --> 02:26:45.540
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I a pc.</v>

3105
02:26:45.550 --> 02:26:47.530
<v Speaker 3>You were criticized about on your show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were you,</v>

3106
02:26:48.220 --> 02:26:50.680
<v Speaker 3>you were furious about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god.</v>

3107
02:26:50.681 --> 02:26:51.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people are just,</v>

3108
02:26:51.790 --> 02:26:56.790
<v Speaker 3>it's so confusing and convoluted on </v>
<v Speaker 3>purpose because that it really relies on</v>

3109
02:26:57.160 --> 02:27:02.160
<v Speaker 3>Israel being the victim and for people </v>
<v Speaker 3>not really understanding that </v>

3110
02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:05.641
<v Speaker 3>palestinians are not all terrorists and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's really just a case of being </v>

3111
02:27:05.641 --> 02:27:07.480
<v Speaker 3>occupied and like getting freedom.</v>

3112
02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:10.180
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really tough man.</v>

3113
02:27:10.181 --> 02:27:12.940
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of these israelis want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just want to push the palestinians.</v>

3114
02:27:13.830 --> 02:27:15.220
<v Speaker 3>They wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want them to go,</v>

3115
02:27:15.550 --> 02:27:18.010
<v Speaker 3>they want them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't care as long as they're gone,</v>

3116
02:27:20.410 --> 02:27:22.390
<v Speaker 3>as long as they're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3117
02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:27.040
<v Speaker 3>here's an example of how crazy it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>El rosario as a soldier there,</v>

3118
02:27:27.041 --> 02:27:27.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in the us,</v>

3119
02:27:28.030 --> 02:27:32.710
<v Speaker 3>when police kill black people and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have rallies like black lives matter,</v>

3120
02:27:32.711 --> 02:27:36.700
<v Speaker 3>people have rallies in support of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who get killed in Israel.</v>

3121
02:27:36.701 --> 02:27:38.740
<v Speaker 3>They have mass rallies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10,000,</v>

3122
02:27:38.741 --> 02:27:40.480
<v Speaker 3>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people strong in tel aviv.</v>

3123
02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:46.080
<v Speaker 3>If a soldier executes and unarmed </v>
<v Speaker 3>palestinian man and gets a slap on the </v>

3124
02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:50.401
<v Speaker 3>wrist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this guy leo rosaria executed an </v>

3125
02:27:50.401 --> 02:27:50.401
<v Speaker 3>unarmed palestinian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was on video.</v>

3126
02:27:50.410 --> 02:27:54.490
<v Speaker 3>It's a horrific video and because there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was this international uproar about it,</v>

3127
02:27:54.820 --> 02:27:56.500
<v Speaker 3>Israel had to put him on house arrest.</v>

3128
02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:59.920
<v Speaker 3>The israeli government put him on house </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrest and that was enough for like mass</v>

3129
02:27:59.921 --> 02:28:04.921
<v Speaker 3>mobilization of tens of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to come out and protest the fact </v>

3130
02:28:04.921 --> 02:28:06.190
<v Speaker 3>that he was getting even reprimanded as </v>
<v Speaker 3>slap on the wrist.</v>

3131
02:28:06.191 --> 02:28:07.410
<v Speaker 3>They get house arrest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>video available.</v>

3132
02:28:07.450 --> 02:28:09.460
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're chanting death to arabs.</v>

3133
02:28:09.461 --> 02:28:13.780
<v Speaker 3>There's tens of thousands of google and </v>
<v Speaker 3>look up dan cohen and david schien.</v>

3134
02:28:14.050 --> 02:28:16.520
<v Speaker 3>They do aMazing journalism there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were living that.</v>

3135
02:28:16.530 --> 02:28:18.310
<v Speaker 3>David jean is israeli.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>

3136
02:28:18.330 --> 02:28:21.100
<v Speaker 3>He's been there and he documents these </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy rallies,</v>

3137
02:28:21.290 --> 02:28:26.290
<v Speaker 3>fascist fucking rallies that no one else</v>
<v Speaker 3>has shown and until I saw that until I </v>

3138
02:28:26.811 --> 02:28:30.110
<v Speaker 3>saw People chanting death to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>videographers because they hate when you</v>

<v Speaker 3>Death to the leftists.</v>

3140
02:28:34.150 --> 02:28:39.150
<v Speaker 3>A really scary man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a completely different </v>

3141
02:28:39.150 --> 02:28:39.150
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here it is.</v>

3142
02:28:39.150 --> 02:28:40.450
<v Speaker 3>Here it is.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was just the two of them.</v>

3144
02:28:46.060 --> 02:28:47.140
<v Speaker 3>That bro skis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3145
02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:51.470
<v Speaker 3>go forward until you see this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like crazy.</v>

3146
02:28:52.890 --> 02:28:56.090
<v Speaker 6>We're being criticized all over the </v>
<v Speaker 6>world is if they are righteous,</v>

3147
02:28:57.060 --> 02:29:00.600
<v Speaker 6>killed for less than the United States </v>
<v Speaker 6>is the worst.</v>

3148
02:29:00.601 --> 02:29:02.130
<v Speaker 6>They bomb pop,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so she's basically saying,</v>

3149
02:29:02.131 --> 02:29:05.340
<v Speaker 6>how dare you criticize us when you guys </v>
<v Speaker 6>do this shit,</v>

3150
02:29:05.341 --> 02:29:08.330
<v Speaker 6>which is a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just the war policemen,</v>

3151
02:29:08.350 --> 02:29:12.000
<v Speaker 6>usu blacks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's okay because the whole circus,</v>

3152
02:29:12.001 --> 02:29:14.880
<v Speaker 6>the world per se,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that israeli army are really murderers.</v>

3153
02:29:16.290 --> 02:29:21.290
<v Speaker 6>We gave them an official license to call</v>
<v Speaker 6>us murderers instead of covering it up </v>

3154
02:29:22.141 --> 02:29:25.050
<v Speaker 6>and dealing with it ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why make so much noise?</v>

3155
02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:27.240
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Instead she's pro covering it up.</v>

3156
02:29:27.690 --> 02:29:32.690
<v Speaker 6>Once a soldier understands that he can </v>
<v Speaker 6>be charged with manslaughter next time </v>

3157
02:29:33.601 --> 02:29:38.601
<v Speaker 6>he'll think twice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that hesitation is likely to cost </v>

3158
02:29:38.601 --> 02:29:39.060
<v Speaker 6>soldiers part of this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow,</v>

3168
02:30:12.911 --> 02:30:13.790
<v Speaker 6>soldiers started to chant death.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're present or the future.</v>

02:30:26.070 --> 02:30:31.070
<v Speaker 3>They're mad because they're all tight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Summary execution is like an </v>

3172
02:30:31.070 --> 02:30:33.150
<v Speaker 3>institutionalized thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're all like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>persecuted for something that everyone </v>

3174
02:30:38.151 --> 02:30:38.151
<v Speaker 3>just acknowledges that this is</v>

3175
02:30:38.220 --> 02:30:40.350
<v Speaker 6>so the soldiers have to be in their </v>

3205
02:32:04.700 --> 02:32:04.900
<v Speaker 1>establishment makes it seem like an arab</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a son of a whore,</v>

3206
02:32:04.960 --> 02:32:05.980

<v Speaker 1>We only came to embrace and love the </v>

3210
02:32:20.090 --> 02:32:23.280
<v Speaker 1>army and the soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to change the football club.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3213
02:32:26.040 --> 02:32:28.980
<v Speaker 1>This isn't about killing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ARabs were about celebrating the army.</v>

3214
02:32:29.100 --> 02:32:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some really crazy stuff like my </v>

3215
02:32:34.100 --> 02:32:34.100
<v Speaker 1>friend david,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it listening to terrible music.</v>

3216
02:32:34.100 --> 02:32:38.090
<v Speaker 6>Oh god.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fucking sick of waiting for peace.</v>

3217
02:32:43.520 --> 02:32:48.520
<v Speaker 6>I will know her on their dream about it </v>
<v Speaker 6>until I die together with this holy </v>

3218
02:32:52.051 --> 02:32:54.030
<v Speaker 6>crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I utter a prayer.</v>

3219
02:32:54.330 --> 02:32:56.400
<v Speaker 6>Jesus christ,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like we would go in there</v>

3220
02:32:56.500 --> 02:32:58.210
<v Speaker 1>huge jerusalem and tel aviv and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>

3221
02:32:58.211 --> 02:32:59.860
<v Speaker 1>are you arab?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

3222
02:32:59.861 --> 02:33:04.861
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they just immeDiately just have </v>

3223
02:33:04.861 --> 02:33:07.720
<v Speaker 1>this distrust and hatred for arabs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's extremely intense and like you were</v>

3224
02:33:07.721 --> 02:33:12.721
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is the thing that starts </v>

3225
02:33:12.721 --> 02:33:14.191
<v Speaker 1>from childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are indoctrinated to think that </v>

3226
02:33:14.191 --> 02:33:14.890
<v Speaker 1>every single person is trying to kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

3227
02:33:15.160 --> 02:33:17.880
<v Speaker 1>So all these people or these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>film this,</v>

3228
02:33:17.980 --> 02:33:21.820
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of fucked now they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been jumped.</v>

3229
02:33:21.821 --> 02:33:24.100
<v Speaker 1>My friend david shane was junk because </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone came up to when he was like,</v>

3230
02:33:24.101 --> 02:33:29.101
<v Speaker 1>where's your fucking flag?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you like were israeli flags as </v>

3231
02:33:29.101 --> 02:33:29.101
<v Speaker 1>capes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these people like wear them.</v>

3232
02:33:29.101 --> 02:33:31.210
<v Speaker 1>It's extremely fascist and he was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like my flag.</v>

3233
02:33:31.211 --> 02:33:31.690
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3234
02:33:31.691 --> 02:33:33.400
<v Speaker 1>where's your fucking flag?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'd beat him up,</v>

3235
02:33:34.060 --> 02:33:36.490
<v Speaker 1>took his camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this happens all the time.</v>

3236
02:33:36.491 --> 02:33:41.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they luckily he's an israeli jew so he </v>

3237
02:33:41.491 --> 02:33:41.491
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get that much heat.</v>

3238
02:33:41.491 --> 02:33:41.990
<v Speaker 1>But my friend dan is also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3239
02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:43.600
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is a jew,</v>

3240
02:33:44.140 --> 02:33:46.060
<v Speaker 1>so they don't really give him heat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like yeah,</v>

3241
02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:49.300
<v Speaker 1>it's really dangerous to film there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really dangerous to document what's</v>

3242
02:33:49.301 --> 02:33:54.301
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They must be particularly furious about </v>

3243
02:33:54.301 --> 02:33:54.700
<v Speaker 1>israeli jews that expose this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3244
02:33:54.780 --> 02:33:56.590
<v Speaker 1>There are definitely targeted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3245
02:33:56.770 --> 02:33:59.230
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous for them to be in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country for sure.</v>

3246
02:34:00.450 --> 02:34:04.000
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really ruthless patriotism.</v>

3247
02:34:04.190 --> 02:34:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The woman was saying that the soldiers </v>

3248
02:34:09.190 --> 02:34:09.880
<v Speaker 1>might hesitate if they can be charged </v>
<v Speaker 1>with manslaughter,</v>

3249
02:34:10.690 --> 02:34:12.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to move.</v>

3250
02:34:13.600 --> 02:34:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty intense.</v>

3251
02:34:14.741 --> 02:34:17.230
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3252
02:34:17.470 --> 02:34:18.240
<v Speaker 1>the whole Israel</v>

3253
02:34:18.240 --> 02:34:22.320
<v Speaker 3>thing and people are confused about like</v>
<v Speaker 3>bannon and this antisemitism thing.</v>

3254
02:34:22.321 --> 02:34:22.830
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

3255
02:34:22.860 --> 02:34:27.860
<v Speaker 3>you can hate jews and love Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like Richard Spencer is a perfect </v>

3256
02:34:27.860 --> 02:34:31.221
<v Speaker 3>example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Richard spencer sees Israel as the </v>

3257
02:34:31.221 --> 02:34:33.531
<v Speaker 3>perfect example of what he wants the us </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be because it's an ethnos supremacist</v>

3258
02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:37.350
<v Speaker 3>nationalist state and that's what these </v>
<v Speaker 3>people love.</v>

3259
02:34:37.351 --> 02:34:42.351
<v Speaker 3>So you can be anti semitic and still </v>
<v Speaker 3>love the notion of fostering like a </v>

3260
02:34:42.351 --> 02:34:45.480
<v Speaker 3>certain group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a certain identity.</v>

3261
02:34:46.470 --> 02:34:51.470
<v Speaker 4>so does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does he think we should have mel </v>

3262
02:34:51.470 --> 02:34:51.470
<v Speaker 4>mandatory military service or they do </v>
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>

3263
02:34:51.470 --> 02:34:51.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3264
02:34:51.470 --> 02:34:55.951
<v Speaker 3>he definitely doesn't want different </v>
<v Speaker 3>races breeding so I think that he </v>

3265
02:34:55.951 --> 02:34:57.050
<v Speaker 3>probably just wants like an insular </v>
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

3266
02:34:57.051 --> 02:34:57.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3267
02:34:57.130 --> 02:35:01.840
<v Speaker 4>I'll just like white people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She is christ nazi-ism when when you get</v>

3268
02:35:02.230 --> 02:35:05.020
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of people and everybody has to </v>
<v Speaker 4>join the army.</v>

3269
02:35:05.140 --> 02:35:05.750
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

3270
02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:08.470
<v Speaker 4>there's a disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a bond that they have.</v>

3271
02:35:08.471 --> 02:35:13.471
<v Speaker 4>It's very different than the regular </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilian bond and the like the </v>

3272
02:35:14.291 --> 02:35:18.190
<v Speaker 4>indoctrination that you get once you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>been in the military and you fought side</v>

3273
02:35:18.191 --> 02:35:20.320
<v Speaker 4>by side with your brothers and sisters </v>
<v Speaker 4>in arms.</v>

3274
02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:23.350
<v Speaker 4>So until a totally different feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3275
02:35:23.351 --> 02:35:25.120
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of people that have been in</v>

3276
02:35:25.150 --> 02:35:30.150
<v Speaker 4>the military and some of them got deeper</v>
<v Speaker 4>in it than others and like those people,</v>

3277
02:35:30.521 --> 02:35:35.521
<v Speaker 4>like it's almost like an us versus them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their society that know that whole chris</v>

3278
02:35:35.831 --> 02:35:37.280
<v Speaker 4>kyle sheep dog thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3279
02:35:37.590 --> 02:35:40.450
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's there protecting us,</v>

3280
02:35:41.020 --> 02:35:46.020
<v Speaker 4>but they together as a group are much </v>
<v Speaker 4>tighter than any other group in the </v>

3281
02:35:47.171 --> 02:35:48.850
<v Speaker 4>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

3282
02:35:48.910 --> 02:35:51.640
<v Speaker 4>there's division in all groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3283
02:35:51.970 --> 02:35:56.590
<v Speaker 4>But I got to imagine that the bond that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they have as israelis,</v>

3284
02:35:56.920 --> 02:35:59.020
<v Speaker 4>all of them have been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>been in the military,</v>

3285
02:35:59.021 --> 02:36:03.880
<v Speaker 4>all of them living in this one small </v>
<v Speaker 4>area surrounded by arab states.</v>

3286
02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:07.960
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be super intense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should've created Israel,</v>

3287
02:36:07.961 --> 02:36:11.560
<v Speaker 4>not in the god damn middle of the middle</v>
<v Speaker 4>east.</v>

3288
02:36:11.710 --> 02:36:16.710
<v Speaker 4>Put it in fucking Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what the hell were they thinking </v>

3289
02:36:16.710 --> 02:36:20.860
<v Speaker 4>isn't about the history of that region.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But was it mean sikes,</v>

3290
02:36:20.861 --> 02:36:21.520
<v Speaker 4>pico,</v>

3291
02:36:21.850 --> 02:36:26.850
<v Speaker 3>western empires.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You basically just drew a line through </v>

3292
02:36:26.850 --> 02:36:30.301
<v Speaker 3>the middle east and divided all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries and formed all these borders </v>

3293
02:36:30.301 --> 02:36:32.410
<v Speaker 3>back like 120 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3294
02:36:32.411 --> 02:36:34.110
<v Speaker 3>like 19.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When was sex pico?</v>

3295
02:36:34.120 --> 02:36:36.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somewhere around that time.</v>

3296
02:36:36.581 --> 02:36:41.581
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fast forward to when the ottoman empire </v>

3297
02:36:41.581 --> 02:36:44.551
<v Speaker 3>was colonizing this area and the british</v>
<v Speaker 3>were occupying what is palestine,</v>

3298
02:36:45.190 --> 02:36:47.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the zionist lobby was really strong.</v>

3299
02:36:47.921 --> 02:36:50.350
<v Speaker 3>This is well before the holocaust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were super,</v>

3300
02:36:50.351 --> 02:36:52.960
<v Speaker 3>super strong and embolden and they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiating with the,</v>

3301
02:36:53.580 --> 02:36:56.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the brits about where they can form</v>

3302
02:36:56.021 --> 02:37:01.021
<v Speaker 3>like a jewish state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there really was no support until </v>

3303
02:37:01.021 --> 02:37:01.270
<v Speaker 3>the holocaust where they were able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sell,</v>

3304
02:37:01.271 --> 02:37:01.610
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3305
02:37:01.650 --> 02:37:06.650
<v Speaker 3>the fear more and there was even false </v>
<v Speaker 3>flag attacks were zionist organizations </v>

3306
02:37:06.650 --> 02:37:10.951
<v Speaker 3>were going around different arab </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries and committing terrorism and </v>

3307
02:37:10.951 --> 02:37:10.951
<v Speaker 3>insane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3308
02:37:10.951 --> 02:37:14.900
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the jews need to come and escape </v>

3309
02:37:14.900 --> 02:37:14.900
<v Speaker 3>that you guys are being persecuted.</v>

3310
02:37:14.900 --> 02:37:14.900
<v Speaker 3>Like they would actually carry out </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorism,</v>

3311
02:37:14.900 --> 02:37:17.090
<v Speaker 3>it like and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And thiS is all documented.</v>

3312
02:37:17.091 --> 02:37:19.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the ethnic cleansing that went on,</v>

3313
02:37:19.461 --> 02:37:20.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's horrific.</v>

3314
02:37:20.991 --> 02:37:25.991
<v Speaker 3>There's dozens of massacres that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened in the formation of Israel </v>

3315
02:37:25.991 --> 02:37:29.300
<v Speaker 3>because even though it was partitioned </v>
<v Speaker 3>initially by the un,</v>

3316
02:37:29.301 --> 02:37:32.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who gave like this international body,</v>

3317
02:37:32.451 --> 02:37:35.120
<v Speaker 3>the authority to partition a country on </v>
<v Speaker 3>top of another country.</v>

3318
02:37:35.360 --> 02:37:36.920
<v Speaker 3>But on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3319
02:37:37.190 --> 02:37:42.190
<v Speaker 3>there was several massacres that just </v>
<v Speaker 3>continued to take more and more of the </v>

3320
02:37:42.190 --> 02:37:42.190
<v Speaker 3>land as I said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And since,</v>

3321
02:37:42.190 --> 02:37:46.930
<v Speaker 3>and that was called the noc button.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all these people were expelled </v>

3322
02:37:46.930 --> 02:37:49.541
<v Speaker 3>violently and purged From their lands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we visited some of these refugee </v>

3323
02:37:49.541 --> 02:37:50.600
<v Speaker 3>camps and the people were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we literally,</v>

3324
02:37:50.601 --> 02:37:55.601
<v Speaker 3>our houses are like five miles away and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just stuck in these camps and </v>

3325
02:37:55.601 --> 02:37:55.940
<v Speaker 3>we've been here for 50 years.</v>

3326
02:37:57.320 --> 02:37:58.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sick.</v>

3327
02:37:58.131 --> 02:38:01.040
<v Speaker 3>And they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they have like no water.</v>

3328
02:38:01.310 --> 02:38:06.310
<v Speaker 3>They just have one water tank every </v>
<v Speaker 3>month and israeli soldiers will go and </v>

3329
02:38:06.310 --> 02:38:08.120
<v Speaker 3>spray skunk spray,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like a military manufactured,</v>

3330
02:38:08.390 --> 02:38:11.420
<v Speaker 3>disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>toxic tasting spray that sounds,</v>

3331
02:38:11.450 --> 02:38:16.450
<v Speaker 3>that's like tastes like sewage water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they'll just go target these water </v>

3332
02:38:16.450 --> 02:38:17.990
<v Speaker 3>tanks and then your water will be fucked</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the whole month.</v>

3333
02:38:18.620 --> 02:38:23.620
<v Speaker 3>There's just little things like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>just to make people's lives a living </v>

3334
02:38:23.620 --> 02:38:23.620
<v Speaker 3>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

3335
02:38:23.620 --> 02:38:25.270
<v Speaker 3>Did you film when you were over there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3336
02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:27.340
<v Speaker 3>we have tons of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have tons of data.</v>

3337
02:38:27.380 --> 02:38:30.230
<v Speaker 3>We have what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have four episodes out where we,</v>

3338
02:38:30.280 --> 02:38:35.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to anti-refugee rallies and I'm </v>

3339
02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:37.451
<v Speaker 3>talking to people who are telling me </v>
<v Speaker 3>that these people are subhuman </v>

3340
02:38:37.451 --> 02:38:40.571
<v Speaker 3>infiltrators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to be executed and rounded up </v>

3341
02:38:40.571 --> 02:38:40.640
<v Speaker 3>and put in chains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all on film.</v>

3342
02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:41.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3343
02:38:41.921 --> 02:38:44.150
<v Speaker 3>it's really crazy and I.</v>

3344
02:38:44.240 --> 02:38:49.240
<v Speaker 3>You really don't understand how bad it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is and why it's so dangerous and how </v>

3345
02:38:49.240 --> 02:38:51.050
<v Speaker 3>really it's been the crux of so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems in the world,</v>

3346
02:38:51.710 --> 02:38:54.520
<v Speaker 3>especially in that region,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what we've done just to create this</v>

3347
02:38:54.521 --> 02:38:59.521
<v Speaker 3>settler colonial state in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the middle east and expel all these </v>

3348
02:38:59.521 --> 02:39:00.800
<v Speaker 3>people violently and then just </v>
<v Speaker 3>unconditionally support Israel.</v>

3349
02:39:00.801 --> 02:39:03.230
<v Speaker 3>No matter what war crimes they commit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter who they bombed,</v>

3350
02:39:03.231 --> 02:39:08.231
<v Speaker 3>no matter who they kill it sick and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't respect us for doing that </v>

3351
02:39:08.231 --> 02:39:12.880
<v Speaker 3>and it's super hypocritical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we're engaging in military </v>

3352
02:39:12.880 --> 02:39:14.330
<v Speaker 3>operations in the name of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>morality and humanitarianism.</v>

3353
02:39:14.660 --> 02:39:17.000
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think do openly support </v>
<v Speaker 3>Israel to where they do?</v>

3354
02:39:17.420 --> 02:39:22.420
<v Speaker 3>It's really weird to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do we support Saudi Arabia to Saudi </v>

3355
02:39:22.420 --> 02:39:26.660
<v Speaker 3>Arabia has oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some logic to connect dots.</v>

3356
02:39:26.661 --> 02:39:31.661
<v Speaker 3>They're really simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe the whole zionist lobby </v>

3357
02:39:31.661 --> 02:39:31.661
<v Speaker 3>controls the us.</v>

3358
02:39:31.661 --> 02:39:35.740
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's a partnership.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the us sees a lot of </v>

3359
02:39:35.740 --> 02:39:39.010
<v Speaker 3>leverage having Israel there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's becoming more unpopular</v>

3360
02:39:39.050 --> 02:39:44.050
<v Speaker 3>where it's almost becoming a liability </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the rest of the world is </v>

3361
02:39:44.050 --> 02:39:47.830
<v Speaker 3>increasingly realizing how fucked up the</v>
<v Speaker 3>situation is and trying to boycott like </v>

3362
02:39:47.830 --> 02:39:48.890
<v Speaker 3>the state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3363
02:39:48.891 --> 02:39:50.150
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the us is,</v>

3364
02:39:50.151 --> 02:39:53.810
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to be a popular thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like even when obama was leaving office,</v>

3365
02:39:53.811 --> 02:39:58.811
<v Speaker 3>he did that kind of cursory like </v>
<v Speaker 3>superficial thing where they for the </v>

3366
02:39:58.811 --> 02:40:02.501
<v Speaker 3>first time didn't veto Israel or didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>veto like the condemnation of israeli </v>

3367
02:40:02.501 --> 02:40:03.370
<v Speaker 3>settlements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that was like,</v>

3368
02:40:03.770 --> 02:40:08.770
<v Speaker 3>we didn't not do it but we just like </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't veto it for the first time in a </v>

3369
02:40:08.770 --> 02:40:11.921
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was a huge slap in the face to </v>

3370
02:40:11.921 --> 02:40:12.560
<v Speaker 3>Israel even though it was like nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>but just as symbolic empty gesture.</v>

3371
02:40:12.740 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 3>But that kind of obama's like</v>

3372
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:17.070
<v Speaker 1>fuck you as I was leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really didn't do anything.</v>

3373
02:40:17.071 --> 02:40:22.071
<v Speaker 1>But it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shows you that there's a lot of </v>

3374
02:40:22.071 --> 02:40:22.071
<v Speaker 1>divisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think from the inside.</v>

3375
02:40:22.071 --> 02:40:25.230
<v Speaker 1>And I think the government is realizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it might not be worth it.</v>

3376
02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the pressure continues to,</v>

3377
02:40:27.970 --> 02:40:32.970
<v Speaker 1>to mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we need to put pressure on our </v>

3378
02:40:32.970 --> 02:40:35.061
<v Speaker 1>government to stop this occupation </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's completely inhumane and </v>

3379
02:40:35.061 --> 02:40:39.590
<v Speaker 1>disgraceful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you said you have four episodes of </v>

3380
02:40:39.590 --> 02:40:40.590
<v Speaker 1>this that are outright four episodes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're putting more out.</v>

3381
02:40:40.710 --> 02:40:45.710

<v Speaker 1>interviews with israelis next on empire </v>

<v Speaker 1>Is it just,</v>

3384
02:40:49.471 --> 02:40:50.980
<v Speaker 1>that's the name of the channel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>channel.</v>

3386
02:40:53.041 --> 02:40:55.320

<v Speaker 1>You're doing this all completely </v>

3389
02:41:02.810 --> 02:41:02.810
<v Speaker 1>independently?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3390
02:41:02.810 --> 02:41:04.140
<v Speaker 1>That's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really intense.</v>

3391
02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it like being your own boss?</v>

3392
02:41:06.871 --> 02:41:11.871
<v Speaker 1>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hard because I really love smoking weed </v>

3393
02:41:11.871 --> 02:41:15.150
<v Speaker 1>and not procrastinating so it's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to like get shit done and then I'll</v>

3394
02:41:15.151 --> 02:41:16.260
<v Speaker 1>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>

3395
02:41:16.261 --> 02:41:19.110
<v Speaker 1>I need to put all this together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like just totally.</v>

3396
02:41:19.170 --> 02:41:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Me and my partner just kind of have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep sense of responsibility really into</v>

3397
02:41:23.300 --> 02:41:25.350
<v Speaker 1>somewhere like this and drop this kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of footage.</v>

3398
02:41:25.470 --> 02:41:26.490
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

3399
02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:31.520
<v Speaker 1>And we also went to the amazon and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw the mess that chevron left there,</v>

3400
02:41:31.711 --> 02:41:36.711
<v Speaker 1>like an 18 billion gallons of oil just </v>
<v Speaker 1>festering in the amazon jungle that's </v>

3401
02:41:36.711 --> 02:41:38.120
<v Speaker 1>just been left real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>YeAh.</v>

3402
02:41:38.130 --> 02:41:40.560
<v Speaker 1>And they just lied about a bunch of pits</v>
<v Speaker 1>and never cleaned it up.</v>

3403
02:41:40.561 --> 02:41:43.140
<v Speaker 1>And so we went and I was like standing </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the soil pit and I was like,</v>

3404
02:41:43.141 --> 02:41:44.160
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>

3405
02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:49.160

<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a whole nother level when </v>

3406
02:41:49.160 --> 02:41:49.160

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3407
02:41:49.160 --> 02:41:50.760
<v Speaker 1>you're not just reacting to the news and</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving commentary.</v>

3408
02:41:50.761 --> 02:41:55.761
<v Speaker 1>Like we were saying before in a studio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going there and it's like the </v>

3409
02:41:55.861 --> 02:42:00.861
<v Speaker 1>truth is in front of your face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the first time you've done stuff </v>

3410
02:42:00.861 --> 02:42:00.861
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3411
02:42:00.861 --> 02:42:04.790
<v Speaker 1>So you just felt like when you were on </v>
<v Speaker 1>our t that you were kind of shackled by </v>

3412
02:42:04.790 --> 02:42:08.361
<v Speaker 1>being in the studio and to really get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel of these subjects that we're </v>

3413
02:42:08.361 --> 02:42:09.400
<v Speaker 1>covering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm really emotional.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I wear my heart on my sleeve and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3415

<v Speaker 1>it's a detriment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very fiery.</v>

3416
02:42:13.740 --> 02:42:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's a detriment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

3417
02:42:15.170 --> 02:42:15.670
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3427
02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:40.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a dictatorship right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear they,</v>

3428
02:42:40.050 --> 02:42:43.440
<v Speaker 1>they took over the gm plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that wasn't the government actually</v>

3429
02:42:43.441 --> 02:42:45.510
<v Speaker 1>that came out that it was not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government that did that,</v>

3430
02:42:45.511 --> 02:42:48.330
<v Speaker 1>But yet I don't know if they issued a </v>
<v Speaker 1>correction.</v>

3431
02:42:48.331 --> 02:42:50.260
<v Speaker 1>That was not a real story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

3432
02:42:50.270 --> 02:42:53.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not such a mess.</v>

<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

3435
02:42:58.741 --> 02:43:03.741
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like millions of people from both sides </v>

3436
02:43:03.741 --> 02:43:03.741
<v Speaker 1>are out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just fighting in the streets.</v>

3437

<v Speaker 1>report subtle shot.</v>

3438
02:43:09.900 --> 02:43:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I know it's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's scarier.</v>

3439
02:43:11.500 --> 02:43:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Like 30 people have died already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

3440
02:43:13.420 --> 02:43:14.450
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

3441
02:43:14.860 --> 02:43:19.860

<v Speaker 1>some light about what the hell is going </v>

3442
02:43:19.860 --> 02:43:19.860
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

3443
02:43:19.860 --> 02:43:22.850

02:43:54.251 --> 02:43:56.350
<v Speaker 1>but who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is the dr.</v>

3455
02:43:56.590 --> 02:43:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just a car site.</v>

3456
02:43:58.830 --> 02:44:02.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like sponsored counter reported </v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing.</v>

02:44:02.680 --> 02:44:05.790
<v Speaker 1>It was looked like they were big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abandoning it for awhile though.</v>

3458
02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:08.170
<v Speaker 1>They've abandoned it for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gm was going to abandon it over like.</v>

3459
02:44:09.940 --> 02:44:10.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding.</v>

3460
02:44:10.541 --> 02:44:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a total mess.</v>

3461
02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:15.120
<v Speaker 4>According to rotor routers report on </v>
<v Speaker 4>monday,</v>

3462
02:44:15.121 --> 02:44:20.121
<v Speaker 4>it looks like general motors is </v>
<v Speaker 4>abandoning Venezuela for awhile to </v>

3463
02:44:20.121 --> 02:44:22.950
<v Speaker 4>employees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>told routers that giant employee plant's</v>

3464

<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

3466
02:44:25.261 --> 02:44:30.261
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Corporate email accounts were all </v>

3467
02:44:30.261 --> 02:44:30.990
<v Speaker 4>deactivated over the weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We received a payment in text message.</v>

3468
02:44:31.410 --> 02:44:33.870
<v Speaker 4>The size of the payments was not </v>
<v Speaker 4>disclosed,</v>

3469
02:44:33.871 --> 02:44:35.970
<v Speaker 4>were not disclosed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but according to the union leaders,</v>

3470
02:44:35.971 --> 02:44:39.300
<v Speaker 4>they were too low.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course unions never said they paid us</v>

3471
02:44:39.301 --> 02:44:40.890
<v Speaker 4>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything's great.</v>

3472
02:44:41.240 --> 02:44:43.470
<v Speaker 1>We're psyched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3473
02:44:43.471 --> 02:44:44.190
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna be,</v>

3474
02:44:44.250 --> 02:44:45.780
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bach.</v>

3475
02:44:45.900 --> 02:44:50.900
<v Speaker 4>So Venezuela essentially is now some </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of a dictatorship,</v>

3476
02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:53.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

3477
02:44:53.091 --> 02:44:55.760
<v Speaker 1>I think that that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3478
02:44:55.761 --> 02:44:56.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3479
02:44:56.691 --> 02:44:57.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3480
02:44:57.830 --> 02:44:59.150
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not until you get there.</v>

3481
02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

3482
02:45:00.560 --> 02:45:03.500
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's just a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>misinformation out there just like there</v>

3483
02:45:03.501 --> 02:45:05.140
<v Speaker 1>is about every country that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3484
02:45:05.180 --> 02:45:10.180
<v Speaker 1>rex tillerson just announced that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to install another regime in </v>

3485
02:45:10.551 --> 02:45:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chavez was a,</v>

3486
02:45:12.501 --> 02:45:14.990
<v Speaker 1>was a target from the us empire for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

3487
02:45:14.991 --> 02:45:19.220
<v Speaker 1>So I just really take everything that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>read with a grain of salt,</v>

3488
02:45:19.340 --> 02:45:21.440
<v Speaker 1>especially in light of all the serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

3489
02:45:21.441 --> 02:45:23.870
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like we're in a really heavy</v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda war.</v>

3490
02:45:23.960 --> 02:45:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3491
02:45:24.831 --> 02:45:29.831
<v Speaker 1>you look back in the queue when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually removed hugo chavez from power </v>

3492
02:45:29.831 --> 02:45:31.040
<v Speaker 1>for a couple of days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the New York times was praising it,</v>

3493
02:45:31.041 --> 02:45:35.110
<v Speaker 1>being a distinguished business </v>
<v Speaker 1>businessman took over,</v>

3494
02:45:35.450 --> 02:45:36.370
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3495
02:45:36.380 --> 02:45:39.530
<v Speaker 1>not mentioning like the us was behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this.</v>

3496
02:45:39.531 --> 02:45:42.320
<v Speaker 1>So I just all the media talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3497
02:45:42.330 --> 02:45:45.500
<v Speaker 1>it's a dictatorship and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a pro democracy movement.</v>

3498
02:45:45.501 --> 02:45:50.501
<v Speaker 1>I don't doUbt that there are millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who want maduro gone and they </v>

3499
02:45:50.501 --> 02:45:54.071
<v Speaker 1>have val absolutely valid things to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of fucked up things </v>

3500
02:45:54.071 --> 02:45:54.071
<v Speaker 1>about the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mismanagement,</v>

3501
02:45:54.071 --> 02:45:54.410
<v Speaker 1>corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

3502
02:45:54.950 --> 02:45:57.770
<v Speaker 1>But I'm going to go there and try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out what's going on.</v>

02:46:35.420 --> 02:46:37.660
<v Speaker 4>killing themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's extremely disturbing.</v>

3519
02:46:37.720 --> 02:46:40.420
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the only way you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>people to make a cell phone.</v>

3520
02:46:40.421 --> 02:46:40.990
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that cheap.</v>

3521
02:46:41.060 --> 02:46:46.060
<v Speaker 4>We've reviewed it like we went over the </v>
<v Speaker 4>numbers of like what a cell phone would </v>

3522
02:46:46.060 --> 02:46:49.420
<v Speaker 4>cost if you had it made in America and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you gave people a living wage.</v>

3523
02:46:49.830 --> 02:46:51.620
<v Speaker 4>It's like more than double.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3524
02:46:51.760 --> 02:46:55.840
<v Speaker 4>I feel like you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would pay that if I knew that I waSn't</v>

3525
02:46:55.841 --> 02:47:00.841
<v Speaker 4>using conflict minerals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but conflict minerals and the least of </v>

3526
02:47:00.841 --> 02:47:04.491
<v Speaker 4>your concern,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because this is just american labor </v>

3527
02:47:04.491 --> 02:47:04.491
<v Speaker 4>conflict minerals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to.</v>

3528
02:47:04.491 --> 02:47:08.680
<v Speaker 4>There's one company that was making an </v>
<v Speaker 4>android phone that was like karma free </v>

3529
02:47:08.680 --> 02:47:09.340
<v Speaker 4>phone or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wasn'T it?</v>

3530
02:47:09.340 --> 02:47:11.260
<v Speaker 4>Something like along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everyone's like,</v>

3531
02:47:12.010 --> 02:47:16.930
<v Speaker 4>how good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The camera had only had like three g.</v>

3532
02:47:16.931 --> 02:47:20.310
<v Speaker 4>It was like a test of how much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much do you care?</v>

3533
02:47:20.350 --> 02:47:21.560
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>three g,</v>

3534
02:47:22.630 --> 02:47:24.930
<v Speaker 4>five g is right around the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3535
02:47:24.940 --> 02:47:26.980
<v Speaker 4>You got to step up your game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Karma phone.</v>

3536
02:47:27.130 --> 02:47:27.860
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>judge.</v>

3537
02:47:27.880 --> 02:47:32.880
<v Speaker 4>You know how many emails I get from dude</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying I listen to you in the joe rogan </v>

3538
02:47:32.880 --> 02:47:35.650
<v Speaker 4>show and you are horribly unbecoming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Swear too much.</v>

3539
02:47:35.651 --> 02:47:37.690
<v Speaker 4>You're not a lady.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to stop swearing.</v>

3540
02:47:38.320 --> 02:47:43.320
<v Speaker 4>And it makes me think what and would </v>
<v Speaker 4>what a female ever be able to win any </v>

3541
02:47:43.691 --> 02:47:45.600
<v Speaker 4>political office if a tape came out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them saying,</v>

3542
02:47:45.640 --> 02:47:48.130
<v Speaker 4>I grabbed men by the deq.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3543
02:47:48.131 --> 02:47:49.630
<v Speaker 4>that's my kind of gal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if.</v>

3544
02:47:49.740 --> 02:47:52.360
<v Speaker 4>What if I looked like trump?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh no,</v>

3545
02:47:52.780 --> 02:47:56.070
<v Speaker 4>he didn't have like all that loose skin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you look like you,</v>

3546
02:47:56.740 --> 02:47:57.790
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3547
02:47:57.791 --> 02:47:58.600
<v Speaker 4>go pussy riot.</v>

3548
02:48:00.850 --> 02:48:02.770
<v Speaker 4>That was pussy riot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Girls are cute,</v>

3549
02:48:02.800 --> 02:48:04.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why it works.</v>

3550
02:48:04.660 --> 02:48:06.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know it's true.</v>

3551
02:48:06.611 --> 02:48:07.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3552
02:48:07.151 --> 02:48:09.070
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of shallow thinking.</v>

3553
02:48:09.120 --> 02:48:09.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

3554
02:48:09.791 --> 02:48:13.570
<v Speaker 4>in pretty much every part of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean human beings are involved in this</v>

3555
02:48:14.050 --> 02:48:19.050
<v Speaker 4>weird sort of a race for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for resources and for breeding rights </v>

3556
02:48:19.901 --> 02:48:21.250
<v Speaker 4>and for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3557
02:48:21.550 --> 02:48:24.700
<v Speaker 4>for social,</v>
<v Speaker 4>social position.</v>

3558
02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.430
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of weird shit going on </v>
<v Speaker 4>with people and we're,</v>

3559
02:48:27.431 --> 02:48:32.431
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're like in some weird stage of </v>

3560
02:48:32.431 --> 02:48:35.820
<v Speaker 4>evolution where we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're close to like getting better than </v>

3561
02:48:35.820 --> 02:48:37.420
<v Speaker 4>we are now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're not there yet.</v>

3562
02:48:37.421 --> 02:48:40.480
<v Speaker 4>And the trump thing is like a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>slide back.</v>

3563
02:48:40.481 --> 02:48:43.120
<v Speaker 4>The longing for nostalgia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3564
02:48:43.121 --> 02:48:47.340
<v Speaker 4>we've kind of slid back a few steps but </v>
<v Speaker 4>I always feel like my,</v>

3565
02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:52.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean my take on things is always that </v>
<v Speaker 4>unless there's some sort of resistance,</v>

3566
02:48:52.630 --> 02:48:56.920
<v Speaker 4>the real hard work doesn't get done and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like this,</v>

3567
02:48:57.110 --> 02:49:02.110
<v Speaker 4>this situation that we're in right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really unappealing to a lot of </v>

3568
02:49:02.110 --> 02:49:04.600
<v Speaker 4>us is going to force people to activate </v>
<v Speaker 4>politically,</v>

3569
02:49:04.720 --> 02:49:08.280
<v Speaker 4>socially and gas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also I think</v>

3570
02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:13.280
<v Speaker 2>like this berkeley shit that's going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>these riots and everything is going to </v>

3571
02:49:13.280 --> 02:49:13.470
<v Speaker 2>force people to reexamine the way they </v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with each other.</v>

3572
02:49:13.480 --> 02:49:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Like this is not the functional way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not a good way to interact.</v>

3573
02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:23.000
<v Speaker 2>And that's where I think we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about like what's important about this,</v>

3574
02:49:23.401 --> 02:49:28.401
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regressive left ideology and addressing </v>

3575
02:49:28.401 --> 02:49:29.520
<v Speaker 2>it and say it's important because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuels the right,</v>

3576
02:49:29.790 --> 02:49:33.750
<v Speaker 2>it fuels these alt right people to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of regressed.</v>

3577
02:49:33.751 --> 02:49:36.690
<v Speaker 2>Like literally what the outright to </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on the notion of.</v>

3578
02:49:36.691 --> 02:49:37.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3579
02:49:37.430 --> 02:49:39.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

3580
02:49:40.380 --> 02:49:41.420
<v Speaker 2>you're awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always love.</v>

3581
02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:44.340
<v Speaker 2>I always love having you on this time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3582
02:49:44.341 --> 02:49:49.341
<v Speaker 2>I need to say more things now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really depressing and clinical </v>

3583
02:49:49.341 --> 02:49:53.970
<v Speaker 2>prime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Debbie martin and he didn't say shit </v>

3584
02:49:53.970 --> 02:49:54.250
<v Speaker 2>about sam harris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so won't send me any horrible text.</v>

3585
02:49:54.540 --> 02:49:55.920
<v Speaker 2>Would you ever get together with him?</v>

3586
02:49:55.950 --> 02:49:57.660
<v Speaker 2>Would you ever do a podcast with him and</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to him?</v>

3587
02:49:57.661 --> 02:49:59.580
<v Speaker 2>He's a very reasonable guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I swear to god he is.</v>

3588
02:49:59.620 --> 02:50:04.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is that is his followers are </v>

3589
02:50:04.620 --> 02:50:07.500
<v Speaker 2>just so crazy hidden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of not like not like his man.</v>

3590
02:50:07.501 --> 02:50:08.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

3591
02:50:10.500 --> 02:50:12.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he's a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but dance,</v>

3592
02:50:13.020 --> 02:50:17.380
<v Speaker 2>I think he feels like you misrepresent </v>
<v Speaker 2>what he says and then he presents it.</v>

3593
02:50:17.381 --> 02:50:18.840
<v Speaker 2>I say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he basically,</v>

3594
02:50:18.841 --> 02:50:23.841
<v Speaker 2>his whole argument was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was tearing apart me tearing apart </v>

3595
02:50:23.841 --> 02:50:25.290
<v Speaker 2>official military data and statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is complete bullshit.</v>

3596
02:50:25.291 --> 02:50:28.020
<v Speaker 2>Anyone who believes the military and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pentagon statistics come on,</v>

3597
02:50:29.030 --> 02:50:30.860
<v Speaker 2>you don't think they fucking let you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that 70,000</v>

3598
02:50:30.880 --> 02:50:31.830
<v Speaker 2>numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct?</v>

3599
02:50:32.370 --> 02:50:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they only got a few civilians.</v>

3600
02:50:34.800 --> 02:50:38.040
<v Speaker 2>It was a little surgical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

3601
02:50:38.041 --> 02:50:40.020
<v Speaker 2>Look by a lot of my friends love sam </v>
<v Speaker 2>harris.</v>

3602
02:50:40.021 --> 02:50:45.021
<v Speaker 2>They love his philosophy 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes to politics that you </v>

3603
02:50:45.021 --> 02:50:45.330
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a different jive.</v>

3604
02:50:45.420 --> 02:50:48.210
<v Speaker 2>I think it'd be funny having two guys go</v>
<v Speaker 2>out at though.</v>

3605
02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:49.650
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be interesting.</v>

3606
02:50:49.680 --> 02:50:50.640
<v Speaker 2>It'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be interesting.</v>

3607
02:50:50.641 --> 02:50:51.870
<v Speaker 2>It'd be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

3608
02:50:52.050 --> 02:50:53.940
<v Speaker 2>What'd you do it would you be doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it?</v>

3609
02:50:54.350 --> 02:50:55.530
<v Speaker 2>I'll think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No pressure.</v>

3610
02:50:55.590 --> 02:50:56.670
<v Speaker 2>I'll think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pressure.</v>

3611
02:50:57.150 --> 02:50:58.950
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually would be fun.</v>

3612
02:50:59.490 --> 02:51:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
