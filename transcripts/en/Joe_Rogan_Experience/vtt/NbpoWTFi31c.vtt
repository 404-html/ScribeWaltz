<v Speaker 1>Joe rogan experience Joe Rogan podcast.</v>

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.770
<v Speaker 1>My name's</v>

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.470
<v Speaker 1>Jane Goodall.</v>

4
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 1>At least 100%</v>

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>I found that fascinating.</v>

6
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.523
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

7
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.271
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

8
00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:24.900
<v Speaker 1>the reason being is that there's an actual animal represents called gigantic and</v>

9
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:29.901
<v Speaker 1>it would say that's more than eight feet tall that lived in the most recently we</v>

10
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 1>know of a hundred thousand years ago.</v>

11
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.860
<v Speaker 1>So that's not outside the realm of possibility.</v>

12
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:40.950
<v Speaker 1>If you look at what we've learned today about things that we thought were</v>

13
00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:41.784
<v Speaker 1>extinct,</v>

14
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.653
<v Speaker 1>whether it's,</v>

15
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.290
<v Speaker 1>the Goblin shark or whatever it's been looking at,</v>

17
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.780
<v Speaker 1>or maybe four point there because it's still within the realm of an ape like</v>

18
00:00:52.861 --> 00:00:53.270
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

19
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Which is different from the other cryptos all logical folks who say they were</v>

21
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.153
<v Speaker 1>dragging.</v>

22
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>You get life forms that have no counterpart.</v>

23
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

24
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.423
<v Speaker 1>Anywhere else.</v>

25
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a real animal.</v>

26
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

27
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.820
<v Speaker 1>they have home stay out of the fossils.</v>

28
00:01:08.821 --> 00:01:10.050
<v Speaker 1>They know that it's real animal.</v>

29
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.320
<v Speaker 1>They actually found their teeth in the apothecary shop and like a public area in</v>

30
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.840
<v Speaker 1>like the 1920s gigantic quite make to that,</v>

31
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.450
<v Speaker 1>that they couldn't understand.</v>

32
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.021
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

33
00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>

34
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.173
<v Speaker 1>They knew it was probably,</v>

35
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.140
<v Speaker 1>we knew it was enormous.</v>

36
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>So it eventually led to a digs in China where they found these gigantic pivots</v>

37
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>buried their dead.</v>

38
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Really fascinating stuff.</v>

39
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:40.671
<v Speaker 1>So that that's a high level of intelligence and respect for their dead.</v>

40
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:41.071
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

41
00:01:41.071 --> 00:01:42.300
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting stuff.</v>

42
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.420
<v Speaker 1>And the um,</v>

43
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.460
<v Speaker 1>the Pacific northwest is a crazy spot and it's exactly where they would come if</v>

44
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:52.860
<v Speaker 1>it came down the Bering strait with humans.</v>

45
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting stuff because we know they existed with humans.</v>

46
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.630
<v Speaker 1>We know it was a real animal coexistence.</v>

47
00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

48
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Would they unquestionably side by side in Asia a hundred thousand years ago,</v>

49
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.680
<v Speaker 1>at least.</v>

50
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.310
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

51
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.150
<v Speaker 1>that's solid.</v>

52
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.470
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

53
00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:09.720
<v Speaker 1>that's a blip a hundred thousand years.</v>

54
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you look at like the Pacific northwest and how dense it is.</v>

55
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.051
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

56
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:13.884
<v Speaker 1>she's saying,</v>

57
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 1>she's saying that it existed at some point,</v>

58
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>but she's not agreeing.</v>

59
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.980
<v Speaker 1>You're still,</v>

60
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.813
<v Speaker 1>but randomly,</v>

61
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>actually this is still there.</v>

62
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.500
<v Speaker 1>She thinks enough people have seen the same thing when they brought</v>

63
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.693
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

64
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.141
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

65
00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:29.730
<v Speaker 1>they have gray hair like silver,</v>

66
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.243
<v Speaker 1>the big old</v>

67
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 1>six foot tall</v>

68
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.623
<v Speaker 1>gray hair.</v>

69
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.460
<v Speaker 1>They have photos of dead ones,</v>

70
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.953
<v Speaker 1>couple hundred shot,</v>

71
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.721
<v Speaker 1>no question.</v>

72
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:43.554
<v Speaker 1>It's a totally,</v>

73
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.310
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>

74
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.430
<v Speaker 1>this is more people go through</v>

75
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>at least this particular where they found these gems,</v>

76
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>they have a video of one.</v>

77
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>So there's an interesting</v>

78
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 1>fundamental fact.</v>

79
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.003
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

80
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna make up a story.</v>

81
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.900
<v Speaker 1>There exist a creature that is large and each every human who has come up too,</v>

82
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

83
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

84
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

85
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.373
<v Speaker 1>how do you</v>

86
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.470
<v Speaker 1>know what I said about big foot is that a big foot is due right next to the</v>

87
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 1>grill is no one gives a shit.</v>

88
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.081
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>

89
00:03:31.081 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

90
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 1>if God didn't exist,</v>

91
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.420
<v Speaker 1>it would be mythological and animal that is smart as a human,</v>

92
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 1>maybe without three before cortex 40% larger than a person sees people to fall</v>

93
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>in the ocean and kill sharks.</v>

94
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.671
<v Speaker 1>Kills sharps.</v>

95
00:03:46.671 --> 00:03:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Big Four.</v>

96
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Can't kill a fucking sharp know.</v>

97
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Think about the shit that killer whales.</v>

98
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Nothing pops of the killer whale except for people because that sentence,</v>

99
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 1>big can't kill.</v>

100
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.490
<v Speaker 1>I like these assertions,</v>

101
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.860
<v Speaker 1>knows the shots from the jacket.</v>

102
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be split tasks.</v>

103
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Your arguments they have in comic con,</v>

104
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

111
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:24.340
<v Speaker 1>It's just like we were talking about earlier,</v>

112
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.390
<v Speaker 1>the idea that we're,</v>

113
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.730
<v Speaker 1>that we're actually picking shit.</v>

114
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.193
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant</v>

115
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.140
<v Speaker 1>things that nobody else does.</v>

116
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.930
