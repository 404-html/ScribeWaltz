1
00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:02.253
Okay.

2
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.700
<v 1>Experience</v>

3
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.980
fresh off of Ari.
She fears comedy central show.

4
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:24.540
This is not happening.
It's Ms Pat again.
Welcome back.

5
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.710
Thank you for having me.
Thanks for coming back again.
And uh,

6
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.050
I'm sorry to hear that a bunch of people were fucking with you online the last

7
00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:34.410
time that you were on here.
A bunch of people have contacted you.

8
00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:37.110
You made the cru crucial mistake of paying attention.

9
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:41.400
Now you can't pay attention.
Well,
you know,
I used to fight back in the day,

10
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:43.140
so if you say something about me,
I'm like,
well,

11
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:47.100
meet me at the gay coffee shop so I can whoop you away.
It's the gay coffee shop.

12
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.690
What's the gay coffee shop?
He's style books.
Why Starbucks?
The gay coffee shop.

13
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.920
You allow the white dude's got on dockers and shit.
There's a gay full,

14
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.960
I don't date guys in dockers.
Do you?
Why don't they guys?

15
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.280
But if I did,
I probably wouldn't have a problem with dockers.
Well,

16
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.170
I'm used to jeans,
baggy jeans.
I'm black.
Okay,
okay.

17
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.630
What were dockers exactly like a type of pants?
Yeah,

18
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.550
I was thinking of what they keep.
No,
I think it was like,
yeah,

19
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.540
they keep the big wallet in their back pocket.
Okay.
And that's not good.

20
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.670
I don't,
I don't know.
I mean,
I'm just saying,
I don't think those types of guys,

21
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.970
do you date types of dudes who like have their pants sagging?
Nah,

22
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:34.730
I'm been married for 23 years.
No,
but I mean if you did,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,

23
00:01:34.731 --> 00:01:39.610
no,
no.
You wouldn't do that.
Does that gay too?
Yeah.
There's gay too.

24
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.810
And raggedy looking and very inappropriate.

25
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.100
I mean it's something breakout you can't ruin.
Right,
exactly.
Yeah,
that's,

26
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.390
that's a confusing thing to me that that pants sagging thing has lasted so long.

27
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.590
I'm so confused.
What's confusing to me is that the young girls think it's cute.

28
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.950
Do they think it's cute?
Yes.
You know,
my niece lived with me and she loved them.

29
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.660
They got a hell of they pants sagging real the father down the cuter.

30
00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:06.390
They look really?
Yes.
They get excited by that.

31
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.700
My knees do with me.
That represents,

32
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:13.470
you don't have a job and you stupid and you look crazy and use an ass hole.

33
00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:16.980
I got a son and he's 28 and I was like,

34
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.480
don't fucking let your pants Sag Sun.
You know you can,

35
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.530
you can barely get by now.
Pull your fucking pants up.
But he's not bad with it.

36
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.250
He's not bad when it's like meet him.

37
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.570
Well he's kind of fat so he ain't got no A's.

38
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.930
So his pants just kind of sag on the old.
He ain't trying to be cool.

39
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.620
That's how Joey Diaz is.
Joey does.
Parents are always falling down so much.

40
00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:40.200
So at one point in time you started wearing suspenders.
Yeah.

41
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:44.310
So sometimes I think my son
Joey,

42
00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:47.420
I didn't say that shit.
He did.
He did.
He was wearing fucking suspenders

43
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.610
done with his fucking pants falling out.
Bullshit you wearing.
But he didn't last.

44
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.040
It didn't last with suspenders.
Exactly.

45
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:58.620
It didn't want to accept the fact that he was a dude that wore suspenders.

46
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.810
You know,
this is a very particular type of dude that wears suspenders.

47
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.210
Orgasm Golf.
Who Golf.
Yes.
You got a bunch of categories.

48
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.260
Gay,

49
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.260
gay coffee shop is cause there's white dudes and dockers old guys who golf.

50
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:16.240
That's who wear suspenders.
Yes.

51
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.810
Unemployed black means make that the best sex and the,
yeah.

52
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:23.860
You said they have the most delicious thick.
I didn't say that's what you said.

53
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:27.550
Delicious.
Delicious.
It is what you said.
It's exactly what you said.

54
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.170
There's a difference between when a person is employed and unemployed,

55
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.220
how good this stakes is.
Really.
I think so.
I really do.

56
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:40.120
I think a person who has a nine to five don't have time to really throw you

57
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:44.170
against the wall at night because he got to go to work in the morning versus a

58
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:45.910
dude who don't do shit during the day.

59
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.170
Who can watch Jerry Springer with you and y'all can just practice on getting

60
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:55.060
better and better and badder.
So due to work too much.

61
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.120
Don't have the energy to fuck correctly.
I think so.

62
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.400
Don't you think so about a woman who,
fuck,
a lot don't.
But yeah,

63
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.380
I would imagine that the women that work all day or exhausted,

64
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.580
but I think anybody who works all day is physically.

65
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.770
That's why I say unemployed Dick is the best.
Dick.
You got a point.

66
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.110
I know what I'm talking about because I've had both.
I Bet I've had both.

67
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.150
It does make sense.
Well,
you can only put so much time into one thing,
you know,

68
00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:25.660
like without,
you know,
if you want to have another side thing that you do,
I mean,

69
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:28.540
that's what sex really is.
If you really stop to look at it.
I mean,

70
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:31.120
it's something else.
It's an activity,
right?

71
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.920
You can't really get good at that activity that makes you working 12 hours a day

72
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.180
and that thing,
right?
Like it's like being a comedian with a job.

73
00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:44.470
You Never gonna succeed until you quit your jobs.
True.
Yeah.
Like everything else.

74
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.180
Fighters have that same issue.
Um,
athletes of all sports,
you know,

75
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:52.240
if you're trying to work a day job and then do something else at night,

76
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.160
it's much more difficult to do.
It is.

77
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.010
You don't have all of the energy that you really need to put into it,

78
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.470
into a slinging that good day needed to take those long nap.

79
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.550
Eat at a leisurely pace.
Yes.
Blacks.

80
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.360
And then think about how are you going to slate it?
Yeah.
I don't have a dick.

81
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:13.180
I'm just saying from experiences I imagine.

82
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.510
But if you haven't met an unemployed dude and you like,
oh,
he's unemployed,

83
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.440
but he's slinging some good deck but he's wearing dockers.
That's it.

84
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.470
It's a deal breaker.
It might be a deal breaker.
Joe,

85
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.360
I don't know to baner brother that walk around in dockers.

86
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.590
Dudes don't give a fuck what girls where girls could wear flip flops.

87
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:37.690
You could wear dockers if you're hot,
you're hot.

88
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.410
A girl with big tits and dockers you'll or yeah.
All right.
Whatever.
Who Cares?

89
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.700
And especially once you get,

90
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.120
once you married and meet with somebody for a long time,
they really don't care.

91
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.250
Then they really don't care I think.
I think as w we don't,

92
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.030
I've been married with 20 something years and I don't care.

93
00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:54.580
My underwear have a match.
Since middle school,

94
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.090
we mean you underwear hasn't brought your match.
Yeah.

95
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.540
Brah bottom guys don't give a fuck about,
I mean,
do you really care if,

96
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.370
if you know,
if a woman come to bed with matching underwear,

97
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.620
some women were really get into that.
I'm like,

98
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.280
I don't give a fuck if the pen has got a seat.
I'm cool.

99
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.680
I keep my shit to the seat fallout.
If a dude cares about that,

100
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.710
it's probably some other issues going on with guys.

101
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.280
Like you think so he wants to wear them?
Yeah.
Oh,
he's one of those guys.

102
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.330
I don't know.
I've never had a dude they would have on my panties.

103
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.660
You let them bigger than my means.
So they came with my dad.

104
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.280
If they put on my pants is going to be like a jumpsuit.

105
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.280
What would you do if you came home and a dude was trying on your panties?

106
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.550
If you came home,
like if he came home early and,

107
00:06:39.551 --> 00:06:44.270
and dude had your shoes on and your pants and he was put your panties on and I

108
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:47.900
will probably slap the shit out of him.
What if he's like,
Miss Pat,

109
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:50.830
like you've got to understand like it's not that I'm not a man.

110
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.280
Beat the shit out of him.
What if he's like Ms Pat,
it's not that I'm not a man.

111
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.410
It's just this exciting.
No,
no,

112
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.440
I'm excited by you can get your last dick at my pants.

113
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.640
What if he orders his own?
We said okay.
Okay.
Okay,
okay,

114
00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:11.570
but are you cool with me ordering my own?
I'm going to order a pair that fits me.

115
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.180
No,
that's like dating a dude with long hair.

116
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.060
You were seeing a dude who hears better than his girlfriend.

117
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.870
That's some bullshit.
I'm not dating a guy with better hair than me.

118
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.460
I'm not doing that.
And you're not putting all fucking bowel Dustin,
my panties.

119
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.980
But what if he gets his own path?
He gets his own.

120
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.340
Don't you think a dude who want women panties or gay?

121
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.620
I tried to be open minded.
I try to be open

122
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.980
minded to here.

123
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.740
There's a lot of men who even have like go through sex changes that still like

124
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:49.280
women.
They become lesbians.
I heard that.
My daughter tell,
you know,

125
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.800
my daughter is gay.
So a lot of her girlfriends are getting they uh,

126
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.450
what not girlfriends,
a lot of her gait,
gait colleagues.

127
00:07:56.451 --> 00:07:57.980
I don't know if she called him colleagues.

128
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.380
I don't fucking know.
She called him the ones they hang out with,

129
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.340
they're getting a breast cut off.
Right?
Whoa.

130
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.800
And they and some of them getting their vagina.
Uh,
they are click click.

131
00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:14.270
Tory is a cleaner is you know the little shit down at a man in the boat stretch

132
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.740
longer so it can be a penis.

133
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.440
And my daughter just telling me this shit cause I be nosy.

134
00:08:18.441 --> 00:08:22.400
I was like why is your freaking they tid is cut off this or she tells me how

135
00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:23.720
they're trying to form them a penis.

136
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.630
But I'm like isn't it a little so what's the purpose of closing?

137
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:29.270
Been doing it to your vagina.

138
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.360
I'm making your thing longer when you still gotta use a deal though.

139
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:39.710
Cause I don't give a fuck who you are.
You don't want no smile penis.
I agree.
Yes.

140
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.970
Yeah.
Well,

141
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:45.971
I know that your dick or your clit rather becomes larger if they take

142
00:08:47.391 --> 00:08:50.840
testosterone,
like when you give a woman testosterone like theirs,

143
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.260
that's always that thing that men freak out.
Say date a female bodybuilder,

144
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.500
they have a clip.
Like a thumb?
Yeah.
It's not like a deck,

145
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.710
but it's like a thumb.
You know what I'm saying?
Like it never really,

146
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:06.510
I think it gets pretty hard.
I don't know.
I've never,
I can't really say.

147
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.800
I've never really been down there,

148
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.750
but I've seen pictures online and it looks like a tiny dick,

149
00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.610
like a thumb sized deck.
What would you do?

150
00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:17.850
Have you bought the touch somebody down there and they should feel like a

151
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:20.710
technique.
I would go.

152
00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.960
Tell me about that.
I was asked him if you're going to tell me about that,

153
00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:28.080
like what's going on down there so you'll be that calm.

154
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:31.140
You wouldn't jump off the Hay.
That'll pay.
Does somebody need to look out for?

155
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.470
I would be upset if,

156
00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:37.140
if it was a guy that was dressing up like a woman and didn't let me know,

157
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:42.160
I'd be upset.
That's rude.
Rude.
That's rude.
That's beyond room.

158
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.820
You got her name and to eat the vagina and that thing slip for your mouth.

159
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.550
I said,
Dick,
well,
if it depends,

160
00:09:50.551 --> 00:09:54.510
is it oversized clit or is it a dick?
Like if it's a Dick,

161
00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:55.980
like if you've got a y chromosome,

162
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.920
if you're a dude and you're trying to pretend that you're a woman and you're not

163
00:09:58.921 --> 00:10:02.770
letting anybody know that you're actually,
dude,
that's rude.
That's rude.

164
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.110
He caught it.
But if you're a woman and you just have a weird click,

165
00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:11.070
like some people have weird fingers,
you know,
some people have long noses,

166
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:16.500
crazy long noses,
right?
Somebody's got out of a long clit.
I don't,
I don't know.

167
00:10:16.501 --> 00:10:20.810
My clique is,
I don't know my,
my clicker.
I haven't seen click click.

168
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:21.873
You collect

169
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.430
what happens down there?
I don't really hug it.
No,

170
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.760
I was,
I'm on this TV show once and uh,

171
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.820
I had this friend who was working with and her boyfriend at the time before she

172
00:10:39.721 --> 00:10:42.870
met him,
had this issue.
What are you doing?
I told you,

173
00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:45.300
put that fucking thing down.
You're messing around with,
you got damn phone.

174
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.480
How'd you get here?
Right?
Flipped out.

175
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:56.640
She was telling me that her boyfriend had went on a date with this lady.

176
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.830
They got home,
they started fooling around.

177
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.810
He took her pants off and she had a clip,

178
00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:05.811
like a pinky and he freaked the fuck out and he hit me pretty long.

179
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.420
He came up with some story.
He said,
oh my God.

180
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:13.470
I realized I have to pick my brother up at the airport.
Just ran out the door.

181
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:18.040
Can you choose click like a peanut lick,

182
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.670
bitch.
What's he pulling off of pain?
It just fell on the bed like a,

183
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:28.290
like a soft penis.
Penis allegedly.
I mean,
I don't,
I don't,
you know,

184
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.020
that's what he said that it was like a Pinky,
but like,
who's Pankey?

185
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.990
You know what I'm saying?
Like everybody's pinkies like,

186
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.410
is it like Shaquille O'Neal's Pinky?
Oh,
that's key.
That's a,

187
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.960
that's not a beacon that like little Lester's Pinky,
you know,

188
00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:45.720
it's like everybody's got a different size pinky,
so,
oh yeah.

189
00:11:45.721 --> 00:11:48.720
The little guy from a,
what's the little movie named?
A little midget dude.

190
00:11:48.721 --> 00:11:51.510
We'll be holding up his pinky.
Oh yeah.

191
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.400
Many me that you can deal with that clique.

192
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.100
<v 2>Uh,</v>

193
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:04.490
maybe it depends on the size they supposed to be.

194
00:12:04.631 --> 00:12:06.910
Like you saying,
they come in all shapes and sizes.

195
00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:10.060
Like what if you're sucking on it and it comes,
I don't suck them,

196
00:12:10.061 --> 00:12:12.310
but we can call my daughter on threeway and she tells me

197
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:19.690
she seems to love them.
Oh boy.
Do you guys talk about that?
You know,

198
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:24.100
my daughter is,
you know,
she don't look gay.
She's the girl in the relationship.

199
00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:28.330
But sometimes she,
you,
she forget that everybody ain't gay around her.

200
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.210
So like I bought her a cell phone because she broke her phone.

201
00:12:31.211 --> 00:12:32.530
So she called me and you know,

202
00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:36.190
I'm very open minded with my kids because I had him at 14 and 15 so you know,

203
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:40.390
I grew up,
they respect me.
I'm Mama,
but you know,
you know,

204
00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:44.050
we kind of open minded.
She called me like,
Oh thank you for the phone.
I'm,

205
00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:48.220
I could eat you.
I was like,
Bitch,
I'm your Mama.
Don't say,
oh my goodness.

206
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:53.710
But it was like in a joking form,
you know?
I guess I might call and say,
Hey,

207
00:12:53.711 --> 00:12:56.890
can you get the,
uh,
can you get the vagina at your mouth?
I need to talk to you.

208
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.160
I mean I don't,
I don't want to see her do it.
I tried to block it out,
you know,

209
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.040
cause my daughter looks so much like me and I'd be like,
oh,

210
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:12.760
can you please stop kissing the cheeks with my face?

211
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:18.250
I be sad.
I don't want to imagine what she's doing with my face,

212
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:23.020
but I can guarantee you my face been on a lot of crunchy vaginas.
Crunchy.

213
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.550
Why crunchy?
Because black hair is crunched down there.

214
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.280
Slept with a black woman.
Yes.
So you know it's current.

215
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.640
You remember you did the joke about the lotion.
No,
that wasn't you.

216
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.600
What lotion that wasn't,
you don't fucking know.
We're all,

217
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:42.090
we're all looking for saying no.
You don't feel Berg.
Joe.

218
00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.690
Bill Burner joke about lotion.
Dating a black girl as you put no cocoa butter.

219
00:13:46.691 --> 00:13:50.500
I damn near Piss myself.
Especially like when we get her to have sex.

220
00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:56.050
Cocoa butter make us our skin so soft.
So you get the,

221
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.440
you put the button a,
the cocoa butter all over you.
It makes you extra soft.

222
00:13:59.441 --> 00:14:01.210
So when he rubbing on you just Ooh.

223
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.140
And it really works for fat girls cause you know,

224
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.640
got dimples in ias so it make you kind of go over the humps and Yas.

225
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.170
That's a fat be secret.
You didn't know that.
I did know that.

226
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.840
I got drunk and we woke up next to a drunk,
a fat chick.

227
00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.320
Not all the cocoa butter it up.
Oh that's right.
She was the wrong call.

228
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.020
She got to be black to be cocoa.
Butter it up.

229
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.510
Only black girls use cocoa butter and white girls don't use coal.

230
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.440
We have white girlfriends,
so I don't know.
Do Yo girls?
You cocoa butter.

231
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.570
Black people love cocoa butter.
What is it?

232
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.260
What about cocoa butter or how did that get a foothold in the black market?

233
00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:36.350
I have no idea.
I don't know.
We got to talk to my ancestor,

234
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:40.210
but it's good for removing scars.
It is.
That's what they say.

235
00:14:40.211 --> 00:14:42.490
They say when you get pregnant,
you supposed to rub it on your stomach,

236
00:14:42.491 --> 00:14:47.110
but I've had four kids and my stomach's still fucked up.
I don't,

237
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.200
I don't stand by that product.
Yeah,
I've heard that before.

238
00:14:50.201 --> 00:14:52.370
I did hear that before that like cocoa butter

239
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.910
<v 1>for pregnant women.
It reduces the risk of a stretch marks,
right?
Yes.
Yeah,</v>

240
00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.830
it does.
It doesn't work.
No,
it didn't hurt.

241
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:02.930
I talked to a doctor about that and he said it's all bullshit.

242
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.310
He said it's completely genetic.

243
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:08.210
You said some people they stretch out and snap back like a rubber band and

244
00:15:08.211 --> 00:15:12.050
nothing happened and then the other people they can gain like a girl.

245
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.990
I dated a girl who gained like 10 pounds,
not much,

246
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.640
and she had these bear claw marks on her ass.
Crazy.
Like she got it,

247
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.600
but it was insane.
It didn't even make any sense.
Was like,
how did you ask it?

248
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.730
So fucked up from tiny towns,

249
00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.320
probably 120 pounds.
And she had two kids,

250
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:35.330
so my stomach got really big,
but it went completely flipped out of the baby.

251
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:38.900
But her stomach still fucking wrinkle and she can't afford no tummy tuck.

252
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.930
So she went out and putting these gigantic tech to have a title and what?

253
00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:46.270
Well it scratch Mars that she has got the tag of scratching

254
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:50.510
this.

255
00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:55.510
That is a ghetto stomach live right down because you have to really get close to

256
00:15:56.121 --> 00:16:00.110
know that her stomach is [inaudible] cousin.
Whoever did the tattoo hooked it up.

257
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:05.230
That's hilarious.
Brian Red Band shows up.
Hey,
how's it going?
Hey fellow,

258
00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.910
you some nuts.
I don't want nuts.

259
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.410
This guy comedian makes these really good like nuts that are,

260
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.310
it's kind of like nature box.
That's like the next serratia cash is right there.

261
00:16:16.311 --> 00:16:19.100
And I was like,
dude,
you need him sell these.
You can make a lot of money.

262
00:16:19.101 --> 00:16:23.820
So ain't no drugs.
No,
there's no drug taker.
No,
don't eat them.

263
00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.420
Come through the microphone.
Oh that's right.

264
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:32.630
Did you have a picture of this time to no,
I don't have a picture.
A picture that,

265
00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:34.580
but I was like why would you do that?
Well,

266
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.730
you put a gigantic gay cause she's only like a hundred and something pounds and

267
00:16:37.731 --> 00:16:41.390
when she wear like tank top and there's a big ass Teigel but whoever did it

268
00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:43.850
really hooked it up.
Cuts everywhere to scratch Mazda.
What?

269
00:16:43.851 --> 00:16:48.590
Your stomach gets fucked up.
The tiger just scratching the shit.
Do you know her?

270
00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:52.270
Still Talk to my niece every day we call it text her.
Tell her

271
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:57.350
I need to see a picture of that.
Okay,

273
00:17:00.411 --> 00:17:02.780

274
00:17:02.781 --> 00:17:07.220
She had a kids got all fucked up and stretched out her stomach snap back,

275
00:17:07.221 --> 00:17:10.500
but she has stretch marks so she got a tiger tattooed on her style.

276
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:13.250
That's perfect.
Clause is ripping apart.

277
00:17:13.251 --> 00:17:16.630
The stretchmarks thinks about it's way cheaper.
Didn't get in the stomach tuck.

278
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:21.080
The stomach talks are brutal too.
If you get your skin cut off like that,

279
00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:23.390
like there's a strong chance of infection.

280
00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:27.440
Like people don't think of your skin as an organ,
but it's actually an organ.

281
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:32.020
Your skin isn't just,
you know,
tissue.
It's an organ.
Like,

282
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:32.990
wait,

283
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:37.990
I'm going to get my titties lift and my stomach tucked and my Nate pool a bag.

284
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.170
You can do it.
I mean,
I know people who've done it.
It does work.

285
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.700
I'm not saying that,
I'm just saying it is a,
it's a serious procedure.
I know.

286
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:51.330
You do know what you're getting in his way.
Oh,
working on it.
What are you doing?

287
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:56.190
I'm walking.
Walking.
That's it.
What else you want me to do?

288
00:17:56.191 --> 00:18:01.191
God Damn you gotta Watch her G he's poured two fucking bucket to sugar and in

289
00:18:02.251 --> 00:18:04.700
that fucking coffee,
why are you fucking,

290
00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:09.780
how the fuck I supposed to drink my coffee?

291
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.110
I've only been doing this shit a little while.

292
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:18.360
How long is a little while I started in late December or January.

293
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.910
Have you lost any weight yet?
Like 13 pounds.

294
00:18:20.911 --> 00:18:24.240
You can't tell you if that's all right.
Listen,
that's pretty good.
13 pounds.

295
00:18:24.241 --> 00:18:28.920
That's actually good to do it slowly locked down 13 pounds over a couple months,

296
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.440
you know,
to put personal trainer.
But uh,

297
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:36.460
this dude was wearing me out.
That's what happens.
That's how I've been shaped.

298
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.850
In your vaginal muscles,
this is and you pissing on yourself.

299
00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:48.610
Yes.
I was like,
you just can't lift my legs like dancer.
It's thank you.

300
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:54.990
You got my vagina.
Do what she did.
They did since the seventh grade,

301
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.750
put my goddamn links to him so I quit.

302
00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.530
That does happen to women who've had a bunch of babies though.
Yeah,

303
00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:02.700
a hard time maintaining the urine.

304
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.430
Like sometimes if you fucking pulling muscles that you ain't used otherwise,

305
00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:09.240
of course you're going to piss on yourself.

306
00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:11.790
But that's the only way to get in shape.
You gotta push your body.

307
00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.000
I know I'm pushing my body,
but I'm like,
dude,
too much.

308
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.101
I don't know.

309
00:19:17.101 --> 00:19:21.630
I just quit and I would just click yes and he been calling me a month.

310
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.600
He did it for a whole month.
Oh Ma.

311
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.490
And then you just woke up one day and just give me those fucking Doritos.

312
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:30.260
I ain't ain't no fucking Doritos.
Doritos.

313
00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:35.070
You confusing me.
You send a miss Maxine mixed messages,

314
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:40.710
but I haven't eaten any Doritos.
Oh I see.
Cause I'm trying to lose weight.

315
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:45.360
I quit from him because I kept fucking peon on myself,

316
00:19:45.361 --> 00:19:47.850
not peeing on myself working.
You know

317
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:53.070
you were just leaking a little.
I understand what you're saying.

318
00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:58.060
Why don't you just get some pants that are designed to keep moisture in it?

319
00:19:58.061 --> 00:20:02.580
Call a panty liner.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I keep them.
They like a credit card.
Credit card.

320
00:20:02.581 --> 00:20:03.414
No limit.

321
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:08.700
I don't think he borrowed anything with penny line.
No.

322
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.000
You should probably talk to other people that are giving you financial advice.

323
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.580
I'm not going to work out.
No.

324
00:20:17.581 --> 00:20:21.970
Panty liners are like visas card for women over 40 you don't leave home without

325
00:20:21.971 --> 00:20:25.080
them.
Oh orange.
Very,
very important.

326
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.390
Grab your wallet before you walk out of the house.

327
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:32.700
Most women make sure they have only pantyliner.
Really?
Yeah.
Most women.

328
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.930
I don't know but I do.

329
00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:42.540
I didn't know that most of period or they suspect no,

330
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.420
we use line.
Honestly.
I'll jokes aside,

331
00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:49.420
they keep the seat of your pants from looking at different colors I think.
Oh,

332
00:20:49.421 --> 00:20:51.580
to keep it from staining.
Yes.

333
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.440
Now I don't give a fuck about the bottom of my panties.

334
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:57.040
You don't know that's what it is.
Shit.

335
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:04.280
It's like an awful net.
It's a click eyelash.
Click allies.
I like that.

336
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.030
He's so fun Joe.
You know I,
I gotta tell you I used to be scared of you.
Right?

337
00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:13.870
Why?
I don't know.
You got that top of song and see,
I know you do that.

338
00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:17.710
MSF can I see my free cams?

339
00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.300
What is Shit you be doing?

340
00:21:19.301 --> 00:21:22.090
You know the karate shit you be doing and I can be with the fuck out.

341
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:27.040
I was kind of intimidating.
You walk around your chest all big and shit,

342
00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:31.240
you know Nice,
nice bodies.
You look,
you look tough.

343
00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:33.850
And I was like oh I'm scared of this dude.

344
00:21:33.851 --> 00:21:36.460
You're not getting here the first I was like he's cool as fuck.

345
00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:39.460
I wanted to kiss you the first time when I was still you can kiss me.
No,

346
00:21:39.461 --> 00:21:43.430
not today.
Not Today.
I didn't want her to kiss me with too many panty.

347
00:21:43.431 --> 00:21:48.300
Let her talk to fuck up.
Did she send me the picture of the Tiger town?
Get her.

348
00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.760
I just got their phone number.
What is the deal with panty liners liners?

349
00:21:51.761 --> 00:21:53.560
Cause I've never seen him on a girl before.

350
00:21:53.561 --> 00:21:55.960
And then recently this young girl had them and she's like,
oh no,

351
00:21:55.961 --> 00:21:59.100
I wear them every day.
Everybody keep you fresh down there.
They come with,

352
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.320
they come with,
they come with deodorize,

353
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.630
you know deodorizer.
Yes.

354
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.190
Deodorizer some raising your underwear,
but some girls panties smell good.

355
00:22:09.191 --> 00:22:11.880
Like they're pussies.
Think that's what I,
yeah,

356
00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:15.940
you don't know the trick behind getting them panties to smell like dad getting

357
00:22:15.941 --> 00:22:20.770
their vagina smells.
Oh,
vagina got ahold of him.
Do you agree all,

358
00:22:20.771 --> 00:22:24.820
I don't if there's a very limited study group.
I mean,

359
00:22:24.821 --> 00:22:29.350
how many look this fucking 7 billion people on the planet.
3.9 billion women.

360
00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.760
Dammit.
I'm telling you about real puts said,
I'm not talking about what you read.

361
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:38.980
What you read.
Real.
Yeah.
Real
well,

362
00:22:38.981 --> 00:22:43.340
yeah.
I'm,
I'm sure it comes on an odor,
but not a bad odor.
No,
no.

363
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.990
It's just a natural,
older,
you don't like the ocean.

364
00:22:45.991 --> 00:22:50.080
You know how to ocean smell when you stick your nose to one of those seashells,

365
00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:55.160
fishing,
fishing,
whatever.
Fuck you.
I'll vagina.
Got Old,

366
00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:59.260
older,
right.
No matter how much you watch it.
And I'm like,
no.
Yeah,
thanks.

367
00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.550
Would smells?
What does it smell?
The coffee has a smell.

368
00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.580
I'm not talking about,
oh,
your stem.

369
00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.400
If it's a stench indication that something wrong with it.

370
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:14.110
You know what's fucked up about a yeast infections.
A lot of use infections.

371
00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:14.711
Not all of them.

372
00:23:14.711 --> 00:23:19.300
Obviously they come from girl having sex with more than one guy that which is

373
00:23:19.301 --> 00:23:19.810
crazy.

374
00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:23.950
Like what a weird thing that like if you have sex with one guy like that guys

375
00:23:23.951 --> 00:23:26.230
come in,
your vagina is okay,

376
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.700
but if two different guys come get your job,

377
00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:34.360
it becomes a use infection.
I don't know about that.
And then when they dangerous,

378
00:23:34.361 --> 00:23:37.280
they hurt.
They hurt.
My friend used to,
I used to have a friend.

379
00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:40.680
I still talk to these two infections.
Hurt.
Yeah.
They itch like a motherfucker.

380
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:43.240
Know it's like crabs.
You ever had crabs?
Nope.

381
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:46.243
You've Adam.

382
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.840
<v 2>Yes,
sure.</v>

383
00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.690
But what a yeast infection is on the inside.

384
00:23:53.691 --> 00:23:58.520
So you gotta try to rub it.
Ooh,
it's,
it's really you,
you,
uh,

385
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.590
if it's,
if it gets really bad,

386
00:24:00.591 --> 00:24:05.450
you could really probably scratched the skin out the inside if you don't go get

387
00:24:05.451 --> 00:24:05.830
it treated.

388
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:06.251
<v 3>You know,</v>

389
00:24:06.251 --> 00:24:09.730
that's a funny thing that people are not worried about saving is an organism

390
00:24:09.731 --> 00:24:13.000
that no one was worried about saving his crabs because crabs were on the verge

391
00:24:13.001 --> 00:24:16.140
of extinction because people are shaving their pubic hairs.
That's it.

392
00:24:16.141 --> 00:24:20.530
The real issue today,
there's very few crabs left in the world in the wild.

393
00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:23.770
Uh,
I agree.
No,
but he used to be,
I'm serious.

394
00:24:23.771 --> 00:24:28.030
He used to be a big thing like back in the 70s,
fucking everybody had crabs.
Why?

395
00:24:28.031 --> 00:24:30.820
Because they all had goddamn shrubbery grown their underwear.

396
00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:34.180
They had huge bushes.
Nobody trimmed their pussy.
Nobody trimmed the deck.

397
00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:35.560
It was just a chaos down there.

398
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:40.810
So two people would have sex and it would be like to jungles was going in there.

399
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:42.110
What do you mean?

400
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:45.890
<v 2>Somebody had to go get the crabs and put them there for Dental Omega in the</v>

401
00:24:45.891 --> 00:24:49.730
jungle.
They just didn't go and say,
Hey,
this is my dick today and jump on it.

402
00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.360
<v 3>Well,
that's the case with every disease.</v>

403
00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.670
Every disease had to start with one person,
right?

404
00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.850
Allegedly following with wildlife.

405
00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.620
And a lot of them start with um,
uh,
like today's diseases,
big,

406
00:25:01.621 --> 00:25:05.250
big portion of today's.
He started with agriculture.
Like,
um,

407
00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:10.530
like a lot of chickens,
diseases come from,
um,
uh,
livestock.

408
00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:14.790
A lot of diseases come from pigs,
swine flu,
famous flu,

409
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:19.260
bird flu.
Well,
I mean,
any disease,
any disease,
diseases.
I mean,

410
00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.000
it's all really the same thing.
If you think about it.

411
00:25:21.001 --> 00:25:22.410
They'll have to start with a person.

412
00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.860
The difference between venereal diseases sexually transmitted,

413
00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.310
but you could transmit venereal diseases through blood too.

414
00:25:29.311 --> 00:25:31.950
If you figured out a way to get someone's blood inside of you.

415
00:25:31.951 --> 00:25:36.570
It's just whatever the disease is getting it from one person and one person,

416
00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:40.470
it had to have an original host.
Okay.
It's fucked up,
right?

417
00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.220
A lot of them come from like,
when you see factory farms like,
uh,

418
00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:48.780
like livestock farms and bird farms and tell you that's where a lot of diseases

419
00:25:48.781 --> 00:25:49.614
come from.

420
00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:53.160
They morph because there's a giant population of animals live in their own shit.

421
00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:57.330
You know,
what make you think crabs is on the verge of extinction?

422
00:25:57.450 --> 00:25:58.710
There's articles written about it.

423
00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:03.570
I hope the instances of genital crabs have drastically reduced since,
uh,

424
00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:07.350
the implementation of pornographic,
visual,

425
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:11.130
vagina trimming and penis trimming.
Oh Wow.
Yeah,

426
00:26:11.131 --> 00:26:16.060
because people would shave their pussies and let it wild.
Yeah.
100%.
Yeah.

427
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:17.490
<v 2>Has got an Afro pick in it.</v>

428
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:26.870
I like to see you like God dammit shaving your vagina is for young girls.

429
00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:30.720
You know what I'm saying?
At a certain point in time it's over what I do,

430
00:26:30.721 --> 00:26:33.060
but I don't do it at my house because I don't want to clean it up.

431
00:26:33.061 --> 00:26:37.050
So I wait till I'm at a hotel on the road.
No.

432
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:41.430
So when you're on the road,
then you start burning down the house.

433
00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:44.010
That shit is hard.
You know,

434
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.500
<v 1>I got black hair that she'd curl up on your walls and it's hard to get out.</v>

435
00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.590
I see.
The jheri curl was stuck on a wall before Brazil.

436
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:55.860
I have not seen Jerry curls.
I mean,
you know,
go adding,
you know,

437
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.620
I'm serious.
This shit stick to the wall.

438
00:26:58.621 --> 00:27:01.620
So I wait until I'm on the road and let somebody else clean it up.

439
00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:03.330
So when you're on the road though,
you do trimming up.

440
00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:09.210
You got a Tux was out of the picture.
I'm trying to see
did she said no,

441
00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.290
no,
no,
not yet.
She worked at night.
All right.
Put that phone down.
Okay.

442
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:15.660
Flip that shit up.
Flip it over to,
okay.
She's got one of those things.

443
00:27:15.661 --> 00:27:18.210
She can't help it.
She's getting Neil Brennan disease.

444
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.520
You start fucking with your phone every five seconds.

445
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.710
So do you shave your wiener?
I Shit,

446
00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:26.570
I don't know when my Dick doesn't get herring,
but the,
the legs,

447
00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:32.720
the top does.
Oh,
the top.
Yeah.
I shaved my balls and the above the deck.

448
00:27:32.721 --> 00:27:35.630
But the deck itself does not,
not,
not around,

449
00:27:35.631 --> 00:27:37.460
they're like the trunk of it and it doesn't get that.

450
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.680
I get a little couple raggedy Harris,

451
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:45.780
but it's really the top area that you have to be 40 so hair is good when you

452
00:27:45.781 --> 00:27:49.680
over 40 but when the wind go between your leg,
you warm,

453
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:54.480
the wind goes between your legs.
No,
go between Malaya come a tie this together.

454
00:27:54.481 --> 00:27:56.510
But I'm just saying it whistles.

455
00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:01.240
So when you get to like any sort of a windy intersection,

456
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.330
more protected because the shave,

457
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:08.580
they keep it warm down there.
I see.

458
00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:11.200
Well girls would always say that they would put like a,

459
00:28:11.201 --> 00:28:15.630
but they put on their winter,
20 girls would put on weight for the winter.

460
00:28:15.631 --> 00:28:19.460
I'm like,
this,
you're just fucking lazy.
Yeah.
Well what?

461
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:21.083
I'm staring

462
00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:27.510
at our 20.
Never heard that.
No,

463
00:28:27.511 --> 00:28:31.500
I never heard that for some,
some girls like to get real fin the summer,

464
00:28:31.501 --> 00:28:34.620
so they look sexy and you know where a little cute outfits and then the winter

465
00:28:34.621 --> 00:28:38.310
comes along.
They go,
all right,
it's time to fatten up for the fucking snow.
Oh,

466
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.380
okay.
Yeah.

467
00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.730
I wish I can get them for the summer.
I'm working on it.

468
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:49.530
So when you say you're working on it though,
like I walk every day,
Joe.
Right.

469
00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:54.620
And um,
I do a lot of weight in a little bit of bicycle.

470
00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.230
I'm doing about an hour and a half a day,
about five days a week.

471
00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.970
When I'm home.
I went this morning.
Oh yeah.
Yes.
What'd you do this morning?

472
00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:08.250
I walked for 45 minutes and rode the bike for 20 and I did 20 jumping jacks.

473
00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:13.020
Oh,
that's good.
Yes.
That's good stuff.
I just think so.
Do you watch what you eat?

474
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.650
Yeah.
Watch it.
Go right in your mouth.

475
00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:21.390
I ate strawberries and an anomaly this morning.
Oh,
that's good.

476
00:29:21.391 --> 00:29:23.880
So you're eating healthy.
I'm trying.
I'm trying.

477
00:29:23.881 --> 00:29:28.800
It's hard when you're on the road and lonely and get a bucket of ice cream and

478
00:29:28.801 --> 00:29:33.510
call your husband.
He don't have ice cream.
I don't eat ice cream.

479
00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:38.190
You know what I'm saying?
Not just like food.
I mean food is great,

480
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:43.670
but when I'm by myself and I can more so I go out to fancy or restaurant cause I

481
00:29:44.181 --> 00:29:47.890
don't have my fucking keys.
They're in my ear,
you know?
I don't have to say,
Hey,

482
00:29:47.891 --> 00:29:49.090
if I'm going to buy this steak for me,

483
00:29:49.091 --> 00:29:52.780
I got to buy you one to him by my fucking self.
So I go out and not splurge.

484
00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.690
Right.
Yeah.
I see.

485
00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:01.290
Sometimes I got a bad habit of spending a bad habit of spending.

486
00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.580
Yeah.
I like to do shit,
you know,

487
00:30:03.581 --> 00:30:08.170
like go eat and shopping.
I get bored.

488
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:13.380
You mean when you're on the road?
Yeah,
home too.
How often it home too.

489
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.650
I'm on the road about three times a month.
Three weekends.

490
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:23.170
That's a lot.
Yes,
a lot.
Now in live?
In Indianapolis,
right.

491
00:30:23.171 --> 00:30:25.460
Are you willing to Annapolis you work out in Indianapolis,
like your,

492
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:30.400
your material,
that's where you do stuff?
Yes.
Yeah,
a little bit.
A little bit,

493
00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:33.610
yeah.
I drive down to Kentucky to,
cause the people always mortise.

494
00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.920
They also owned the club in Kentucky,

495
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:41.050
so I drive the drive hour and a half.
Oh,
that's not bad.
I didn't know that.

496
00:30:41.051 --> 00:30:45.040
Indianapolis was only an hour and a half from Kentucky.
Louisville.
Really?

497
00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:50.530
Some lube on hour and a half away.
Yeah,
he just left there.
Hmm.
Who was you with?

498
00:30:50.531 --> 00:30:55.460
Tiffany.
And who else?
Tiffany had his shin.
Tony Hinchcliffe.
I no,
it was del,

499
00:30:55.461 --> 00:30:59.560
right?
Yeah,
it was him.
Yeah.
So,

500
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:02.260
but that's why I work on my material.
That's nice though.

501
00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:05.830
You're working three weekends a month.
That's nice.
It's getting better help.

502
00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.350
You know,
the podcast world have really been supportive.

503
00:31:08.351 --> 00:31:13.000
I went to Chicago after I did chores and all of these fit fuckers from a GM came

504
00:31:13.001 --> 00:31:14.380
out.
I was like,
holy fuck.

505
00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:18.770
I can tell the different people from the different park as your people are

506
00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:23.440
always in fucking shape.
Well that's good.
Yeah.
And they just so motivated.

507
00:31:23.441 --> 00:31:24.700
They'd be like,
Oh miss pat,
you can do,

508
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:26.410
I'm like go fuck yourself and get off my back.

509
00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.220
So they sat there trying to give you help.

510
00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.580
I mean the fans are the ones who stay with me,
you know?

511
00:31:33.581 --> 00:31:36.910
Those are the ones they really like.
You fuck everybody else,
you know?

512
00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.420
Well I guarantee you we can get you a trainer in Indianapolis and won't make You

513
00:31:40.421 --> 00:31:44.330
pee herself.
Really?
Yeah.
We'll find somebody.
Find somebody.

514
00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:47.530
Why?
Why is everything gotta be free?
Don't you make money?

515
00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:52.190
How much chemical free said it like three times.
Three.

516
00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:57.480
Why for for you?
You just said you work.
Oh,

517
00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:02.430

Update.
They cost money lining.
Yeah,

518
00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:07.360
I know you're doing well.
I hear,
I hear things are going to fuck you hear that?

519
00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:11.280
Oh,

They love them.

520
00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:14.900
I'll come in and see me.
Thank you.
So,
uh,

521
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.810
Joe Case,

523
00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.320
What about you?
You give them a shout out on Twitter.
That's all you have to do.

524
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:29.710
Shout out if you want to train me and I don't have to pee on myself.

525
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:32.050
Just two months.
He come to my house.

526
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.110
If someone can prove to you that they can get you in shape,

527
00:32:35.111 --> 00:32:37.900
we start paying them then yeah.
Then you'll pay them.

528
00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:41.030
The last guy was getting me a shape and you were paying him?
Yeah.

529
00:32:41.031 --> 00:32:43.660
The thing is you got to knock on my door and make me come out.

530
00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.620
Got a knock on your door.
You got to wake you up?
Nope.
Does he have to feed you?

531
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:53.450
Put your shoes on?
I'm working on it.
Okay.
Joe got,
Damn.

532
00:32:53.451 --> 00:32:55.990
You sound like a step daddy.

533
00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:58.590
Just trying to find out where your line is.

534
00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:03.820
I'm trying to find out where your aligners lazy but I'm working on it so someone

535
00:33:04.371 --> 00:33:07.120
just has to kind of get you to do it.
You know what it is.

536
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:09.380
I get started and then I don't see no results.

537
00:33:09.381 --> 00:33:13.790
Like I have a problem where I would get on the scale every fucking day and he

538
00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:16.910
was like state or fuck off their scale cause you know you drink water,

539
00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:19.160
that's water weight and I was like,

540
00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.160
I spent all this fucking time at the gym and I didn't a little shit.

541
00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:25.160
So he can't just lose weight and continuously,

542
00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:30.200
I mean I know but I'm an ex drug dealer so everything is was fast in my life and

543
00:33:30.201 --> 00:33:34.010
I like shit to be fast in my life.
But it wasn't fast to get big,

544
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:38.510
you got to get well the same reason he got sick.
I woke up like this,

545
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:45.830
I don't remember.
Caney no 100 and some pounds during my marriage,
my marriage,

546
00:33:45.831 --> 00:33:46.664
we just,
we,

547
00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:51.530
we used to have a lot of sex and eat taco bell and two years later we woke up

548
00:33:51.531 --> 00:33:55.940
fat.
That's,
I don't remember ever changing panty sizes.

549
00:33:56.150 --> 00:34:00.380
One day I just went from a 16 to in my twenties.
I'm like,
what the fuck?

550
00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:05.180
What's a 16 large,
what's the size?
16 panties?

551
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:09.100
A normal size,
but I don't know if that means like what,

552
00:34:09.101 --> 00:34:13.700
what size person would that be?
A hundred pounds.
120 pounds.
For me,

553
00:34:13.701 --> 00:34:18.701
a 16 is about one 75 where you were wearing one 75 when I met my husband and

554
00:34:19.401 --> 00:34:21.890
then somewhere along the line,
straight out of the military.

555
00:34:21.891 --> 00:34:23.730
So he wasn't fat either.
You know,
I tell you,

556
00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:27.960
I told you my husband was a Vegan and he lost all that weight.
He gained,

557
00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:32.150
gained it all back.
Oh No,
we don't.
We don't eat meat.

558
00:34:32.151 --> 00:34:36.130
He just went on a cookie died.
Cookie Diet does happen.

559
00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.270
Um,

560
00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:42.710
he gained about 60 pounds back and since the last time you were here.
Yeah.

561
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:47.340
That's insane.
That's fucking unhealthy.
I keep telling him that's the,

562
00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:50.060
having your titties go up and down like that.

563
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:53.630
You're going to have a heart attack.
The heart attack is the real concern.

564
00:34:53.631 --> 00:34:56.750
It's not the titties.
Yeah.
Two is you're going to get wrecked.

565
00:34:58.090 --> 00:34:59.870
You lose and gain that much weight.

566
00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:04.400
Your body doesn't know what the fuck back in the gym.
Yeah.
Well you can't gain,

567
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:08.540
that's a scary thing.
I tell you what happened.
He went,
um,

568
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:12.620
his gout flare it up.
So when his gout flareup,
he can't do shit.

569
00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:16.790
You'll never had gout.
I have a friend that is some painful shit.

570
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:19.100
My husband can't do shit.
He's told just be,

571
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:23.040
it looked like it fucking talking to you and just read to you.

572
00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:27.170
Take medication for it.
Well it's his diet.
It's his diet.

573
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:30.340
What about the Diet?
Like what,
you know,
they say God,
these two,

574
00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:31.940
see it was like a king's disease.

575
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:35.830
I used to affect a lot of like royal people back in the day cause they let them

576
00:35:35.831 --> 00:35:40.560
in on him.
That man overseas,
what's his name?
Khan.
Jewel will the manual.
Yeah,

577
00:35:40.561 --> 00:35:45.560
him.
He got gout.
The new one.
Kim Jong.
Ooh.
Yeah,
yeah,
he does gout.

578
00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:49.560
Yeah,
that's what they say.
It's associated with people that are overweight,

579
00:35:49.561 --> 00:35:51.590
but it's also associated with specific diets.

580
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:54.510
Diets that are rich and certain foods.
I forget what it is,

581
00:35:54.511 --> 00:35:57.540
but I know some wine has something to do with it.
You don't drink wine.

582
00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:01.920
What's the symptoms?
I don't know.
You get like joint pain.
My friend who has it,

583
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:06.270
he's got like,
he gets really painful heels.
Like his feet swell up.

584
00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:13.170
My husband had in his left tall in his left toe only.
Yup.

585
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.830
That's the only place it flare up.
Really?
Yup.
That's weird.

586
00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:21.840
My father in law just passed in November and um,
he had it all over his body.

587
00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:25.320
He had it in his arms.
His hands,
like my mother in law got it in her arms,

588
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.450
but everybody in my husband's family.
Got It.

589
00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:31.430
<v 3>Hmm.
Okay.
Here's what it says.
There are a number of factors,</v>

590
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:32.930
risk factors for gout.

591
00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:36.410
The more risk factors a person has a greater risk of developing gap when

592
00:36:36.411 --> 00:36:39.680
examining a patient to take the following risk factors into consideration to

593
00:36:39.681 --> 00:36:42.620
ensure a proper diagnosis.
Hyper,

594
00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:48.420
hyper.
You're a see me classified as a serum uric acid.
Yeah.

595
00:36:48.421 --> 00:36:53.050
Uric acid.
That's one of the things that has to do that for some reason.

596
00:36:53.051 --> 00:36:57.800
Other has to do with diet,
right?
Yeah.
Family history,
age,
gender,

597
00:36:57.801 --> 00:37:00.170
gout affects men more than women.
Ethnicity.

598
00:37:00.171 --> 00:37:05.171
The incidences of gouty arthritis and a core comorbid conditions varies by

599
00:37:07.311 --> 00:37:08.920
ethnicity in the US.

600
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:13.430
Hispanics and African Americans who have features of metabolic syndrome are more

601
00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:17.780
likely to develop gout.
Obesity.
What's that?

602
00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:23.270
What are you putting that up for?
I got a trainer.
What?
What is that?

603
00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:25.283
Okay.

604
00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:30.150
<v 1>Give some training or new,
I don't even know.
That guy sucks.
It could not even</v>

605
00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:35.750
just one trainer.
He was fat.
That's not good.

606
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:39.500
Hey,
whoa.
Wait belt to like a girl and I was like,

607
00:37:39.501 --> 00:37:43.380
I'm not going to keep paying your fat ass crystals.
This is the other thing.
Yeah,

608
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.000
it forms crystals and that's what my friend,
that's why it hurt so bad.

609
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:52.030
My husband say it feels like somebody is just fucking got fired to your skin.

610
00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:57.740
<v 3>Alcohol consumption.
Uh,
especially beer.
Pure drinking beer.</v>

611
00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.730
It says Purina.
I don't mean that's not even the dog food.
Purina,

612
00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.850
Purina rich foods,
especially red meat and shellfish.

613
00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:09.260
High Fructose Laden foods like high fructose corn syrup,

614
00:38:09.261 --> 00:38:11.900
crash diets,
crash diets.

615
00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:15.410
I'm going to tell him that including high protein fat diets,

616
00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:21.220
starting uric acid lowering therapy without anti-inflammatory coverage.

617
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:24.340
Hmm.
Bedrest,

618
00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:29.360
often postoperative and all those things trigger nothing can stop the pain.

619
00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:33.430
Nothing like Tylenol.
No.
No.

620
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:36.910
<v 1>They can't give you anything.
They'll give something to try to calm it down,</v>

621
00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:40.570
but nothing like if my husband get it.
What did he,
what did he drink?

622
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:47.620
He drinks something to make his calm down.
Oh.
Um,

623
00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.180
uh,
organic PR.

624
00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:55.030
What is organic cranberry juice or organic cranberry juice.
Yeah.

625
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:58.420
Why don't you percent cranberry juice?
Calms it down.
You know,

626
00:38:58.421 --> 00:39:01.210
most cranberry juices like cranberry juice cocktail,

627
00:39:01.211 --> 00:39:05.410
which is like not a cat tail because the one he buys like $9,

628
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:10.300
like seven to $8 at Kroger down the organic.
I that helps.
Yes.

629
00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:14.760
And he drinks it every day.
Shit,
it's,
it's very tall.

630
00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:18.490
It's taught,
I'm sorry.
It's Tart cranberry juice.
That's what it is.
Well,

631
00:39:18.491 --> 00:39:21.470
cranberry juice cocktail.
Like most people think their drink drinking cram,

632
00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:24.670
juror number,
just shit.
You're drinking a lot of sugar.
Yes you are.

633
00:39:24.671 --> 00:39:29.110
But my husband drinks the tarts and he drinks like maybe he drinks it like at

634
00:39:29.111 --> 00:39:30.860
least once a week to keep the flareups.

635
00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.120
He can tell now when they're about to flare up and he'd get on his cranberry

636
00:39:34.121 --> 00:39:36.910
juice and it'll go away.
Hmm.
That's interesting.

637
00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:41.110
It doesn't that hurt with women who have urinary tract infections as well.
Yeah.

638
00:39:41.111 --> 00:39:44.290
That shit feel like gone to real.
Does it?
You know a gonorrhea.
It feels like,

639
00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:48.910
I know what a lot of shifts.
Aye.

640
00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:52.770
I ain't always had healthcare,
but urinary tract infections,

641
00:39:52.771 --> 00:39:56.430
that's a one thing that women who take cranberry juice to do that cleans your

642
00:39:56.431 --> 00:39:59.410
vagina.
You want to keep it down because if you get like if it,

643
00:39:59.411 --> 00:40:03.840
if it gets really bad and you go to Piss,
you could run out in the bathroom.
Whoa.

644
00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:07.590
That shit hurt.
Yeah.
Why does it hurt?

645
00:40:07.591 --> 00:40:11.350
Because it's inflamed and it's burning.
It's like if you took your wiener,

646
00:40:11.351 --> 00:40:15.690
I'll let me stuck a lighter too.
Oh,
I was just trying to demonstrate the pain.

647
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:20.390
I call a wiener.
Well Dick.
Oh,
okay.
Wait a style like

648
00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:27.100
to me wiener is sexy.
Do you?
If your husband's like,
listen,

649
00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:29.600
baby boomers slang my wiener your way.

650
00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:33.110
Well my husband don't allow me to talk in the bedroom because my voice is deep

651
00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.240
in the bedroom.
He's like fucking clearly off.

652
00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:43.350
Throw tells you not to talk in the bedroom.
Listen,

653
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:47.660
we're going to walk through the threshold of silence.
We do our fucking

654
00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:53.960
trash.
Whoa.
What were you saying?

655
00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.770
Fuck me.
Fuck me.
Oh,

656
00:40:57.771 --> 00:41:00.350
come on hard mother fucker.

657
00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:05.000
You ain't on shit to make you feel like young when you're having sex.
Wow.

658
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:06.440
All that deep talk.

659
00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:12.560
He don't like he said when I lay down and my boobs go up on my neck,

660
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:17.580
I really sounded like a man
looking at me like that.

661
00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:22.190
You know I'm fat so my team is going to roll up on my neck from land down.

662
00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:25.370
Do they ever cover your eyes?
Oh,
they probably could.

663
00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:28.820
Like one time I woke up and I thought my husband was choking me but it was my

664
00:41:28.821 --> 00:41:31.130
titties up under my neck.
Wow.

665
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:34.670
Your titties were under your neck heavy that you thought your husband was

666
00:41:34.671 --> 00:41:35.504
choking him?

667
00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:40.220
I thought he kinda like had his hand around my neck and then I woke up and it

668
00:41:40.221 --> 00:41:41.660
was my fucking,
I wasn't choking,

669
00:41:41.661 --> 00:41:44.900
but you know how you feel something on you when you sleep,
so,

670
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:49.970
so that also affects the way you talk.
So you guys have deals?
Yeah,

671
00:41:49.971 --> 00:41:52.430
I don't talk to talking about them.
Do you have any deals for him?

672
00:41:52.431 --> 00:41:55.740
Like he can't talk anywhere else.
Like you should have a room where he can,

673
00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:57.020
he's got to shut the fuck up.

674
00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:01.180
You can't just have a room where only he gets to talk.
Well he knows,

675
00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:04.310
you know what I'm saying?
You should give him a room,

676
00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:06.050
but you got to get a room to,
well,

677
00:42:06.051 --> 00:42:08.480
I'm working on getting a bedroom so I don't have to watch them.

678
00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:10.760
Bullshit ass TV that he watched.
Oh,

679
00:42:10.761 --> 00:42:12.560
so you're working on getting a separate bedroom?

680
00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:15.290
I have one of my nieces just got to wait till they leave.

681
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:17.990
That's the beginning of the end.
You get separate bedrooms.
Well,

682
00:42:17.991 --> 00:42:21.620
we're not going to,
I'm going to go there and watch TV and relax.
That's it.
Yeah.

683
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:26.390
No,
I have to sleep with my husband.
I love my husband Joe.
I believe he's my hero.

684
00:42:26.391 --> 00:42:29.120
You know most people wait on somebody to in on a white horse.

685
00:42:29.121 --> 00:42:31.340
He came in on a Nissan and got me out the ghetto.

686
00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.050
He gave a bitch.
Hell,
you didn't punch a bitch.
And I hear Friday,
no gun real,

687
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:42.050
no crabs,
no baby mama,
none of that bullshit.
Sounds like a great guy.

688
00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:45.740
He is a great guy.
All you can't talk in the bedroom.

689
00:42:45.741 --> 00:42:47.810
Shit I gotta do.

690
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.330
Okay,
so then you get this new bedroom.

691
00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.830
Then he's got to shut the fuck up and the new bedroom and then a new bedroom.

692
00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:01.730
You can just talk all kinds of crazy shit.
You know ms paths bedroom.

693
00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:02.720
When she gets to talk,

694
00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:08.090
go get me a vibrator and talk to the vibrator.

695
00:43:08.091 --> 00:43:11.330
He won't tell me to shut the fuck up.
You don't have to go that crazy.

696
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:15.650
But I'm just saying love vibrators.
I believe you.
I have never used a vibrator.

697
00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.870
I just never,
you've never tried one?

698
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:20.450
I've been fucking since I was 12 I don't have no problem getting laid.

699
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:23.960
I believe that as well.
Did you ever get curious?

700
00:43:23.961 --> 00:43:28.460
Like what's he was all the fuss was all about.
Well No,
nothing.
Cause you know,

701
00:43:28.461 --> 00:43:29.940
you know what they say.
They say what does your dad,

702
00:43:29.941 --> 00:43:32.570
you're going to meet God and going to flash your life back in your face.

703
00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.480
I don't want to see that vibrator scene when I have to get into him.

704
00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.000
I wouldn't worry about it.

705
00:43:38.001 --> 00:43:40.160
Let me think about all the other shit got in your head.

706
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:43.290
Well I got an excuse for that yourself with your tents?
Yeah.

707
00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:47.800
What you don't want to look at guns said,
oh I needed a nut.
Why not?
No,

708
00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:51.260
I don't want to do that.
God's the one who gave you this desire to come?
Well,

709
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:55.160
I know that.
I mean that was just joking.
I know.
Like vibrators,

710
00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:58.520
you don't like them.
No,
you don't know because you haven't tried them.
Right.

711
00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:02.660
I know that's what my girlfriends say.
But I've always had sex with somebody.

712
00:44:02.661 --> 00:44:04.520
I mean who goes up?
My titty Joe.
Me.

713
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:10.490
So you demand certain activities having sex that the vagina is that the

714
00:44:10.491 --> 00:44:14.540
vibrators not capable of fulfilling Zach Lou,
I'm gonna talk to,
I get it.

715
00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:19.160
I see what you're saying.
A lot of sense.
I mean,
I think they're cute.

716
00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:21.800
You think of vibrators?
Cute.
I've seen him in our sizes.

717
00:44:21.801 --> 00:44:25.820
I hosted a vibrator party one time.
You hosted a vibrator party?
Yes.

718
00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:30.500
And up at the time this,
the new one was you can uh,
it had a suction cup on it.

719
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:35.710
So you just stick into the toilet and you fuck yourself anywhere in the house.

720
00:44:36.151 --> 00:44:39.930
It just stick to the wall.
And it was crazy.

721
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:44.880
And women were buying the shit.
An outsizes Joe.
Oh,
like this,

722
00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:48.990
like this.
I had a friend who had a girlfriend who couldn't come without her.

723
00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:53.790
She got addicted to it and so he wasn't shit.
He would fuck the shit out of her.

724
00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:58.500
And then she was like,
oh,
give me that thing.
Yeah.

725
00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:01.950
Hitachi's are known for that because they're so powerful that they pretty much

726
00:45:01.951 --> 00:45:05.700
make it so it's numbed down there that they only have to have that feeling too

727
00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:09.430
to come now because Hitachi's or like those really strong ones.

728
00:45:09.431 --> 00:45:13.560
They plug in this little law and those things.
Just Tachi.
Is it a massager?

729
00:45:13.561 --> 00:45:18.080
That girl's uses a library.
It's a famous,
uh,
it's one of the oldest massagers.

730
00:45:18.081 --> 00:45:19.210
It looks kind of like a,

731
00:45:19.211 --> 00:45:23.220
a like a long a ice cream cone or something fucking talking about.

732
00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:27.060
The one I saw today was plastic and they just,
yeah,
those look like dicks.
Well,

733
00:45:27.061 --> 00:45:31.530
the one that he's talking about a lot of them too.
Oh yeah,
the lesbian daughter.

734
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:35.660
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
My other daughter is 16.
I hope she ain't got no vibrate.

735
00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:38.760
The one that's weird.
Like,
so lesbians,

736
00:45:38.761 --> 00:45:43.320
we'll use vibrators and strap ons and all that shit,
but they don't want no,
no,

737
00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.980
no.
They want something inside them.
No,
that's why I have a joke.

738
00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:49.760
That's why I have a joke.
I was asked my daughter,
I was like,
why are you gay?

739
00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:51.750
I mean,
if,
if the TDS is your thing,

740
00:45:51.751 --> 00:45:56.751
go out and get a fat boy that's a Hitachi and it's super powerful.

741
00:45:57.331 --> 00:46:00.450
Like if you have it full blast,
well it's not supposed to,
you don't.

742
00:46:00.451 --> 00:46:03.600
You just put on a clip.
It's not supposed to be for that though.

743
00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:07.240
It's supposed to be for your back.
Oh God.
Yeah.

744
00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:09.300
I don't know nothing about that type of sex.

745
00:46:09.301 --> 00:46:13.080
I'm just straight up and down and go to sleep straight up and down and then go

746
00:46:13.081 --> 00:46:15.630
to sleep.
If someone buys one for you,
where are you?

747
00:46:15.631 --> 00:46:20.280
At least try it and we're not on it.
I'm not doing that bullshit.
I'm a Christian.

748
00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:25.340
Oh,
okay.
Yeah,
that makes sense.
Christians don't use fat.
They have Jesus once.

749
00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:30.580
What if one of them is blessed?
Fuck up,
not even going to vibrate.

750
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:33.570
How does that work?
Are Christians allowed to masturbate?
I don't know.

751
00:46:33.571 --> 00:46:38.420
I'm not a real Christian.
I'm a Christian.

752
00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:42.990
I'm a Christian.
You're not a real Christian,
but you are a Christian Christian.

753
00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:47.850
I am.
I believe in God and Jesus.
I am but not been baptized 25 times.

754
00:46:47.851 --> 00:46:52.110
So of course I'm a Christian 25 times.
Why were you baptized 25 times?

755
00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:53.363
Well,

756
00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:57.240
my momma had a skiing in the head back in the day when you went out to churches,

757
00:46:57.241 --> 00:47:00.330
cared about you.
So if you go to church and he was like,
we was poor.

758
00:47:00.331 --> 00:47:02.640
So if you had problems with your financial problems,

759
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:07.050
if he had financial problems and you join the church and the church will write

760
00:47:07.051 --> 00:47:11.520
you a check for your finances that month.
Really?
Yeah,
there was a black church.

761
00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:12.473
That's amazing.

762
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.670
Well that's why black church don't give out money without interviews.

763
00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:20.610
No churches give up interview Monday without interviews.
But that's a,

764
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:23.600
that is a beautiful function of a church though,
that they could actually,

765
00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:27.620
how does that work?
So my mama would take us,

766
00:47:27.621 --> 00:47:30.130
it was five of us and she would take us to get,
we would join

767
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:32.590
<v 2>the church,
you know,
like we really to come and you know,</v>

768
00:47:32.591 --> 00:47:36.810
and they will pay our light bill,
I'll rent or whatever.
And so they,
the,
the past,

769
00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.230
I always wanted to baptize you.

770
00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:41.740
So my momma had a scheme where she would sit in these churches up to get us

771
00:47:41.741 --> 00:47:46.630
baptize and get help.
So you,
you bring the kid in,
you say,

772
00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:49.560
I want my child to get baptized.
I got a lot of financial,
Angela,
no,

773
00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:51.190
you scheduling.
She'll go to the church,

774
00:47:51.191 --> 00:47:54.880
asked for help and and that they always try to talk you into joining cause you

775
00:47:54.881 --> 00:47:58.120
need memos to keep going.
And my mom was like,
yeah I joined,

776
00:47:58.121 --> 00:48:01.330
you know and get baptized or whatever.
I don't know how to meet him.
Went down,

777
00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:05.260
I just showed up for the baptism.
So you would show up?
They'd baptize.

778
00:48:05.261 --> 00:48:08.500
You dunk it in the water and then what happens?
They give you some money.

779
00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:12.190
They give my mama to money.
How much money?
I don't know.
I was a kid.

780
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:14.920
I didn't even know that.
I didn't even realize,

781
00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:17.020
I didn't even realize this shit wasn't right.

782
00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:19.170
Wasn't abnormal until I was on my phone.

783
00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:23.890
My girlfriend probably about eight years ago and I'm talking to probably like 10

784
00:48:23.891 --> 00:48:26.530
years ago and we was talking about baptism and I was like,

785
00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:31.330
I got baptized 25 times.
She's like,
who the fuck baptize you 25 times.
I was like,

786
00:48:31.331 --> 00:48:35.310
I met Sammy,
was you baptized?
She was like once.
I was like,
why?
And I said,

787
00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:39.450
oh that was a fucking skiing.
Did you ever talk to your mom about it?

788
00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:40.361
My mom is dead.

789
00:48:40.361 --> 00:48:43.810
My Mama died when I was 30 when she was 39 I was 16 with two kids.

790
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:48.700
She had diabetes.
Wow.
That's one more reason to try to get you.

791
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:52.990
I wasn't fat.
She was 98 pounds.
Damn 98 pounds.

792
00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:57.970
Never was fat.
Yes,
she was an alcoholic.
My Mom,
I think my Mama,

793
00:48:58.450 --> 00:49:01.240
they say diabetes when you ain't got no health care,
no insurance.

794
00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:04.030
They just put whatever appeals you were taking that with the motherfucker data.

795
00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:08.530
But I think my mom just died of a broken heart.

796
00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:10.700
She had a rough life.
You know,

797
00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:15.310
she had five kids before she was 23 she was uneducated.

798
00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:19.420
She was in a very abusive relationship with my daddy.
I mean,

799
00:49:19.421 --> 00:49:20.590
we never had ships.

800
00:49:20.591 --> 00:49:24.880
We always lived in places where we got evicted because she lived off welfare.

801
00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:29.590
I mean,
she just,
she,
I mean,
I'm not going to say she'd never had a chance.

802
00:49:29.591 --> 00:49:33.790
She just had a bad,
like whatever,
whatever she was,
it was,
it's a cycle.

803
00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:38.200
So whatever her parents,
whatever she saw her parents do,
she went on and did it.

804
00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:42.630
And so that my sister and told to do,
oh,
I changed my life.
Yeah,

805
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:43.950
you broke the cycle.
Yeah.

806
00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:48.820
But did that occur to you while you were young and when you had kids?
Like my,

807
00:49:48.821 --> 00:49:50.920
I'm doing the same thing my mom was doing.
Yes.

808
00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.620
Like my Mama would have me at a really young age,

809
00:49:53.621 --> 00:49:58.580
like a lightened cigarettes at five or six lighting her cigarettes.
Yes.
And,

810
00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:00.390
but I was told in school,
I'm like,

811
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:04.380
well I probably have about six or seven and we was taught in school not to
smoke.

812
00:50:04.381 --> 00:50:06.780
I remember that Joe,
cool guy with the cigarettes.

813
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:09.060
You remember the Little Camera Camera?
That's what I'm talking about.

814
00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:12.400
Remember how cool he was.
But in school you was taught not to smoke.

815
00:50:12.401 --> 00:50:15.460
Cigarettes will kill you.
So that always stuck in my head.

816
00:50:15.461 --> 00:50:18.880
But when my mom would send me in in the room and me and the kitchen and light

817
00:50:18.881 --> 00:50:22.270
her cigarettes after stole and she was like,
make sure you pull it to time.

818
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:25.480
And I'm like,
bitch,
they just told me I'm going to die.
I didn't say that to her.

819
00:50:25.481 --> 00:50:27.590
That's it in my head.
You know.
He shot some it through.

820
00:50:27.591 --> 00:50:31.880
She was telling you to they nail it to get it going.
I don't fucking know.

821
00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:35.870
But my sister smoked everything in the book from this year.
I inhale.

822
00:50:35.871 --> 00:50:36.704
You know what high she,

823
00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:39.560
the reason why she stopped me from doing it because I would go in there and

824
00:50:39.561 --> 00:50:43.400
fucking Friday fucking cigarette and she was slapped the shit.

825
00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:48.730
She smoked Winston's so already that shit is super strong so we'll be want to

826
00:50:49.170 --> 00:50:52.580
spit on like who'd been a confidence shit.

827
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:55.910
My sister got muscles are proud of smoking at eight years old.

828
00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.730
How old were you when she was getting you this lighter cigarettes?

829
00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.010
Probably about,
well my sister probably like eight.

830
00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:02.450
So she two years older than me.

831
00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:06.060
<v 3>So you were six years old and she was telling you to take a hit off a second.</v>

832
00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:09.640
<v 2>Yes,
we did it every day.
Fuck,
that's crazy.
We need it.</v>

833
00:51:09.641 --> 00:51:13.080
If we knew how to pull her Jean and she's drunk Jan and water.

834
00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:16.500
So we would go back there and make her a drink all the time.

835
00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:19.200
She would tell her to make her a drink.
Ah Yes.

836
00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:22.170
And I used to always say everything I say you motherfuckers do,

837
00:51:22.171 --> 00:51:24.780
I'm never going to do it.
I don't smoke or drink and is,

838
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:29.870
you know what I always said my momma made me think and she did everything unsexy

839
00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:34.050
just like she wasn't like most moms like and she smoked a cigarette.

840
00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:36.390
She didn't hold it like you know how you saw most women hold?

841
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:40.110
She had that bitch like a joint cause she smoked a lot of weed and I said why

842
00:51:40.111 --> 00:51:41.550
you do everything like a man?

843
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:44.580
I didn't say that to her but like she never drank out of glass.

844
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:47.940
She always dropped out of a quart bottle.
So I was like,

845
00:51:47.941 --> 00:51:51.360
she'd do everything like a fucking man.
Like she never told her purse.

846
00:51:51.361 --> 00:51:55.560
She always told a wallet,
a man's wallet in my back pocket.
Really?

847
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:59.970
So everything she did,
I was like,
I can't do this bullshit.

848
00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:01.190
<v 3>I believe from heaven.</v>

849
00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:04.560
So many kids at a young age probably want to have nothing to do with sexy.

850
00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:08.040
Just stay the fuck away from me with all their Dick.

851
00:52:08.041 --> 00:52:12.260
That just gets me in trouble.
She's do some repulsive shit so forth.

852
00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:18.690
<v 2>Well,
you know she,
she had five key is really young because her,
my daddy is,</v>

853
00:52:18.691 --> 00:52:21.600
was nine years older than her,
like eight years older than her,

854
00:52:21.601 --> 00:52:22.980
like my kids' father was.

855
00:52:22.981 --> 00:52:25.020
And I didn't even realize that until one day I was out here,

856
00:52:25.410 --> 00:52:29.910
put some shit together and I had my birth certificate and I was like,
ah,

857
00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:33.420
this motherfucker got my mama young.
Like my baby daddy got me young.

858
00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:36.570
It's so crazy.
It's such a repeating cycle.

859
00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:41.600
It is a repeated side until somebody open their eyes and say Holy Shit,

860
00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:44.490
we all headed,
I'm headed like these people.

861
00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:46.640
<v 3>What made you realize and what,</v>

862
00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:49.130
what do you think was like the catalyst to get you to stop?

863
00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:52.320
<v 2>When I had my kids,
when I had my,
you know,</v>

864
00:52:52.321 --> 00:52:57.321
I had the first baby at 14 and that's the first time I ever felt like I was

865
00:52:58.081 --> 00:52:59.580
loved.
I,

866
00:52:59.581 --> 00:53:02.490
that's one of the reasons why I kept the baby cause you know the baby and I got

867
00:53:02.491 --> 00:53:04.650
a book deal so I don't give away all the stores.

868
00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:08.070
But that's one of the reason when I gave birth to her,

869
00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:11.940
I kept her because he was married.
This lady showed up at my door.
I was like,

870
00:53:11.941 --> 00:53:15.150
this is my fucking husband.
You breaking it by it.
But to me,

871
00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:19.530
I was going to finally have somebody in my life that loved me and I never,

872
00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:21.840
I didn't have to worry about betraying me.

873
00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:26.730
So that's why I kept that baby because I knew that baby will love me

874
00:53:26.731 --> 00:53:30.000
unconditionally because I never felt like I was alone until,
I mean,

875
00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:33.360
when I had the baby,
I was 14 and I've given birth by myself.
He wasn't there.

876
00:53:33.361 --> 00:53:34.081
He showed up in the neck,

877
00:53:34.081 --> 00:53:38.610
then the hospital with his girlfriend and his new girlfriend,
Jesus Christ.

878
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:41.400
Yeah.
So you,

879
00:53:41.401 --> 00:53:46.090
you like consciously felt like you could raise this baby from the time it was

880
00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:48.300
little and it would love you.
I,
yeah,

881
00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:51.450
but I didn't realize the finance attached witty,
but yeah.
You know,

882
00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:52.650
it's almost like a baby dog.

883
00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:56.460
That's how you kind of looked at it was a cabbage bad.
I never got,
but I,

884
00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:00.030
my carriage pack,
the carriage pay.
Kids don't eat these motherfucker really aid.

885
00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:03.660
So I had to go out and get a job.
You got a book deal?
Yeah,

886
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:07.770
I'm calling about when did this happen?
Uh,
after I left you

887
00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:12.810
as well,
the writer hurt me or it's your fear.

888
00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.890
So she went to an agency and told them to listen to the Rogan Park Cas.

889
00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:21.090
And so she listened to the Rhogam Park cats and then I did Marin's and then they

890
00:54:21.091 --> 00:54:23.100
listen to him and then the agent picked me up.

891
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:26.770
So got the agent fromU and m seal.

892
00:54:26.771 --> 00:54:30.370
The deal of with all the podcast is together and I thought I did Martin

893
00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:34.350
Marathons and I was shocked too.
I was like,
ah,
y'all going about his shit?

894
00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:37.450
So are you going to write it yourself?
Your now

895
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:44.250
he say click,
click,
click,
click.

896
00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:48.150
Tory's notorious is a Greek Roman clip.

897
00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:51.780
I don't know what you fucking is,
but the Tories maximus,

898
00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:55.970
the lady who found me on Ari park cast,
she's writing it.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.

899
00:54:56.900 --> 00:55:00.720
So you just will tell her the stories driven talking.
Well,

900
00:55:00.721 --> 00:55:02.070
I sold the book last time.

901
00:55:02.071 --> 00:55:06.000
I looked right around the last time I was here after I was here.
So we riding,

902
00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:08.910
we almost done with the first chapter so far was so talking about three,

903
00:55:08.911 --> 00:55:11.520
four times a week.
So does she talk to you on the phone?

904
00:55:11.521 --> 00:55:14.370
On the phone and then she just,
did she record it and transcribe it?

905
00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:17.740
So I'm quite sure she do.
I mean,
I just,
I just don't fucking know.

906
00:55:17.741 --> 00:55:20.010
We'll go in the book.
Right.
I got a GED.

907
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:24.310
I just tell her the stories and then she'd go from there.
Like,
um,

908
00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:26.160
it's kind of funny because,
you know,

909
00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:31.970
she opened doors in my life that I've had close so long that they were,

910
00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:35.160
that's a lot of pain after,
you know,

911
00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:38.100
I only seen his later a couple of times and I'm just opening these doors.

912
00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:40.080
So a lot of times we cried together,

913
00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:46.170
but we also laugh in a lot of time.
I hang up from when she'd come back.

914
00:55:46.171 --> 00:55:51.110
She's like,
Oh,
you okay.
And I'm like,
I'm a fucking case.
This is 30 years ago.
But,

915
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:53.700
and I think the reason why emotion is there,

916
00:55:53.701 --> 00:55:57.180
because I hadn't had to deal with it all of these years,

917
00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:02.940
you know,
you know,
I,
you can,
you know,
when you,
when you compress shit,

918
00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:07.560
it's okay until my fucking crack that door open.
So I deal,

919
00:56:07.561 --> 00:56:10.980
I do a lot.
Well I did a lot of crying with her.
Yeah.

920
00:56:10.981 --> 00:56:15.981
That's the case with a lot of people never recalled like ancient things that

921
00:56:16.231 --> 00:56:16.981
happened to them.

922
00:56:16.981 --> 00:56:20.130
Like you don't even realize how much it affected you until you start talking

923
00:56:20.131 --> 00:56:24.280
about it.
Then you start crying and realize like,
wow,
that played a major

924
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.960
<v 3>part in fucking me up.</v>

925
00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:30.810
<v 2>Yeah.
You know,
and,
and it,
I'm 42 I mean I'm 42 years old and I,</v>

926
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:31.220
and you know,

927
00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:35.000
I still can remember my mama saying white people is better than you.

928
00:56:35.001 --> 00:56:38.830
So for years,
Joe,
I was scared of white people.
I never had to deal with,

929
00:56:38.831 --> 00:56:41.960
y'all didn't come to my fucking house.
I didn't go out looking for y'all.

930
00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:45.710
So I didn't really have to deal with white people until I moved to Indianapolis

931
00:56:45.711 --> 00:56:46.790
in my comedy career.

932
00:56:46.791 --> 00:56:50.210
Cause there was no urban scene because when I first started comedy I was on an

933
00:56:50.211 --> 00:56:51.140
urban singing.

934
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:55.130
So you don't see white people coming in too many Urban's little small hole in

935
00:56:55.131 --> 00:56:57.240
the wall.
So when I got to Austin,

936
00:56:57.310 --> 00:57:01.990
<v 3>funny that urban is black.
Uh Yeah.
How the fuck did that happen?</v>

937
00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:05.980
How did it become urban?
I have no idea.
Urban means city,

938
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:08.590
like city.
Everybody lives in the fucking city.

939
00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:13.360
I mean most half the world lives in a city.
Like how weird is it that people,

940
00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:15.710
they did that.
Oh my people by people.

941
00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:17.920
Do you think it's like a euphemism for black?

942
00:57:17.921 --> 00:57:20.980
They wanted to say I have a nice way of saying black.
So they came up with urban?

943
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:25.480
Yes.
Urban crime.
Hey Eben crying.
Yeah.
Inner city.

944
00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:28.000
So you started doing urban rooms?

945
00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:29.590
<v 2>Yeah.
When I first started,
so when I,</v>

946
00:57:29.610 --> 00:57:33.590
my husband job transferred us to Indianapolis.
It was no singing there.

947
00:57:33.591 --> 00:57:38.020
So I had to go into the,
to the mainstream club,
which was more at ease and,

948
00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:40.970
and crackers and stuff.
And,
and I would just,
you know,

949
00:57:40.971 --> 00:57:45.020
kind of fucking chuck and we'll do what I was doing to one of the managers,

950
00:57:45.021 --> 00:57:48.770
Avery.
Hey Avery,
he love your podcast.
And he was,
I would tell him these stories,

951
00:57:48.771 --> 00:57:50.270
he's like,
you should really talk about your life.

952
00:57:50.271 --> 00:57:52.640
And when I started to talk about my life,
you know,
people,

953
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:55.640
they would just come to me.
Oh,
you so funnels.
Get your fucking hands on me.

954
00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:56.990
I wouldn't say that to them,

955
00:57:57.110 --> 00:58:00.230
but in my mind my mind was fucked up because she said,

956
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:03.980
don't white people are better than you.
Never look them in eye.
Well,

957
00:58:03.981 --> 00:58:05.530
who fucking said that to you?
Your mom.

958
00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:09.830
Your mom said white people are better than you.
Look them in the eye.

959
00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:14.480
What did she mean by that?
I don't know.
You know by,
but they're better than you.

960
00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:16.100
They are.
That's what she said.
Because you know,

961
00:58:16.101 --> 00:58:20.420
I guess my momma was born in the 40 so she was a part of that whole civil right

962
00:58:20.421 --> 00:58:21.620
movement.
And you know,

963
00:58:21.621 --> 00:58:26.150
you had a lot of people that believe that bullshit that we are different.

964
00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:30.710
They were different back then.
So she taught me why people was better than me.

965
00:58:30.711 --> 00:58:33.950
Never look,
you and I,
and until I moved to Indianapolis,

966
00:58:33.951 --> 00:58:38.090
I could never look them in the eye.
And I told my husband his story.
He was like,

967
00:58:38.091 --> 00:58:41.210
we all the fucking sign.
Cause you know,
white women are so friendly.

968
00:58:41.211 --> 00:58:44.240
So they were run up to me and kissed me.
Oh you're so funny.
In my mind,

969
00:58:44.241 --> 00:58:46.670
look bit you and get your Mfa Game I'm in with.
Choke the shit out you.

970
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:51.560
<v 3>I know what's fucked up.
I mean we don't,
we don't think about it in perspective,</v>

971
00:58:51.561 --> 00:58:56.561
but we are as close to 1940s as the 1940s where to slavery.

972
00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:01.370
You don't think about it like that.
But that's reality.

973
00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:06.400
I mean slavery ended in 1875 you think about that thing of 1875 to 1940 you

974
00:59:07.131 --> 00:59:11.420
know,
it's not that much time.
It's not that much time.
So five years,
you know,

975
00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:14.810
whatever plus or minus 10 years,
not that much time.

976
00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:20.090
And then you go from 1940 you know you're dealing with 17 years to today,

977
00:59:20.091 --> 00:59:21.170
74 years,

978
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:25.160
five years from 1940 and give or take a few here or there.

979
00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:26.930
That's crazy.
Yeah.

980
00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:31.520
That's weird when you really think about it like that's not that far away where

981
00:59:31.521 --> 00:59:35.090
people owned people in this fucking country.
Yeah,

982
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:38.570
and your mother grew up in that goes,

983
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:42.530
you know the reverberations of that error and the civil war.

984
00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:46.640
I mean people going to war over that and that's fucked up.

985
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:47.990
If you really stop and think about it,

986
00:59:47.991 --> 00:59:52.991
your mom was as close to God Damn Lincoln being president as we are born in 40

987
00:59:54.930 --> 00:59:55.221
<v 2>I think.</v>

988
00:59:55.221 --> 01:00:00.221
My Dad was born in 42 and she was born in 49 and my dad was born in 30

989
01:00:01.091 --> 01:00:04.030
something.
My Dad was born in at 30 and I don't fucking know.

990
01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:08.110
He died when he was almost 70 but she died at 39

991
01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:12.870
<v 3>yeah,
she was as close to Lincoln being president as we are to Eisenhower being</v>

992
01:00:12.871 --> 01:00:16.350
present,
which is fucking weird.
That is weird.

993
01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:20.370
As weird to think of because it's just,
we look at history,

994
01:00:20.371 --> 01:00:24.030
when you start thinking about slavery,
we start thinking about Abraham Lincoln.

995
01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:28.860
That seems so long ago,
impossibly long ago.
But then when you,
you know,

996
01:00:28.861 --> 01:00:32.010
you,
you do the numbers and you go,
wait a minute.
Oh,
the shit,
whoa.

997
01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.190
1865 like that is not 1875.

998
01:00:35.191 --> 01:00:39.900
That's not that long ago is that it's not,
it's just not,
it's not that long ago.

999
01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:44.970
It's weird.
It's weird that it's not,
but it really isn't.
It's just,
uh,

1000
01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:48.550
th th th the human like the,
the,

1001
01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.130
the toll that,

1002
01:00:50.131 --> 01:00:55.131
that sort of life paid or that the had to be a paid by people of having slavery

1003
01:00:57.451 --> 01:01:02.370
and having just rampant racism throughout this country and having two completely

1004
01:01:02.371 --> 01:01:06.900
different groups of people,
white people and black people and that black people,

1005
01:01:06.901 --> 01:01:10.170
literally your mother telling you white people are better than you.

1006
01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:14.130
The toll of that,
like the,
the,
the impact of that God damn,

1007
01:01:14.131 --> 01:01:16.170
that's going to take a long time to sell the fuck down.

1008
01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.800
<v 2>Well,
I mean,
I'm getting over it now.
I realize we all the same,
you know,</v>

1009
01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:21.180
you know better than me,
you know

1010
01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:21.741
<v 3>you are,</v>

1011
01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:25.400
but you think a lot and you're very smart person that you were exposed to a lot

1012
01:01:25.401 --> 01:01:26.900
of different things.
Yeah.
I mean,

1013
01:01:26.901 --> 01:01:29.390
think about how many people just don't get that message.

1014
01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:33.700
<v 2>You know what?
And I took my brother to show in Lafayette,
Indiana.</v>

1015
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:37.900
I did around Thanksgiving,
my family came up.
So I take my,
my,
my brother them,

1016
01:01:37.901 --> 01:01:41.050
they just think I'm some open mic.
They don't really know what I do,
you know,

1017
01:01:41.051 --> 01:01:45.580
cause I don't see my family a lot.
So I take my brother to Lafayette,

1018
01:01:45.581 --> 01:01:48.340
Indiana and 300 some white people come out,
white people,

1019
01:01:48.341 --> 01:01:49.190
we don't want to be like people.

1020
01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:53.110
I don't have that many black people that come out and see me.
So I told him,

1021
01:01:53.111 --> 01:01:54.940
I said,
I knew it wasn't going to be any black people.

1022
01:01:54.941 --> 01:01:56.890
So I brought black people with me,
my family.

1023
01:01:57.550 --> 01:02:00.070
And so I'm telling these jokes about my life,
how we grew up.

1024
01:02:00.071 --> 01:02:01.570
My brother over there crying,
laughing.

1025
01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:05.500
And so when I finished and we get in the car,
he said,
reb,

1026
01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:10.380
Chaim crackles let you talk to them.
Like Dad,
your street name.

1027
01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:15.250
They don't call me Patricia.
Like your whole family calls you by your

1028
01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:20.160
name.
I thought it was nuts.
I was like,

1029
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.080
<v 1>Tony,
nobody say crackers anymore.
And they're white people.
Okay.</v>

1030
01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:29.790
Isn't that a club crackers?
Crap club correctly.
But that also right people

1031
01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:35.550
crackers and it's filled with white people.
God Damn.
Yeah.

1032
01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:39.240
That's gotta be weird having your brother call your cracker or a rabbit rather.

1033
01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:44.400
I tried to stop him,
but me and my cousins call me rabbit cause I don't know.

1034
01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:48.750
That's where we're going to name the book rabbit.
Oh really?
Yes.

1035
01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:52.290
We're going to name the book rabbit.
Ms Pat,
Aka Rabbit.

1036
01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:55.040
I don't know how it's gonna go,
but I know they decided on rabid.

1037
01:02:55.041 --> 01:02:59.550
They think rabbit gotta pop to it.
Yeah,
you should use your real name,

1038
01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:03.210
the name you use onstage.
Don't let them use any other name.
Ms Pat,

1039
01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:05.730
make sure it's miss pat is in the title somehow or another,

1040
01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:09.660
otherwise people won't find it.
Okay.
You know,
thank you for telling me.

1041
01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:12.030
You get what I'm saying?
They just need to get stupid.

1042
01:03:12.031 --> 01:03:15.090
Harpercollins don't get creative.
You weird white people never alone.

1043
01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.200
They just think it's cool.

1044
01:03:16.201 --> 01:03:20.160
They just wanna be able to call your rabbit rabbit this story.
Miss Pat,

1045
01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:26.640
I don't like the name.
You know what?
If you call me rabbit then you know me.

1046
01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:30.990
You know you call me Ms Pat and then you a fan.
I go home,
I'm paying.

1047
01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:36.030
But if you call me rabbit,
you know my fucking path and it creeps me out.

1048
01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.190
I was like,
don't fucking call me rabbit.

1049
01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:41.190
So do you say that your family don't call you around?
I tried to tell him,

1050
01:03:41.191 --> 01:03:42.920
but I ain't think they know my real fucking,

1051
01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:50.360
my brother called me what you're doing right motherfucker.
I'm pat now.

1052
01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:56.490
Cause you know I got a brother named Anthony and Tony.
Right?
So I'd be like,

1053
01:03:56.550 --> 01:04:01.130
do I call?
Do I call you and call you?
Don't I call you ain't bitch do.

1054
01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:05.220
I mean I call him Anthony.
I don't call him anymore.
You just call him and yeah,

1055
01:04:05.221 --> 01:04:08.160
we just call him ant.
But that's short for Anthony.
That makes sense.
What?

1056
01:04:08.161 --> 01:04:12.450
I call him Anthony and I tell him to call me pat.
Pat.
But he won't.

1057
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:16.980
He won't motherfucker.
And I'm my brother Tony.
My brother Tony,
he's real,

1058
01:04:16.981 --> 01:04:19.440
real black.
So we used to call him itchy.

1059
01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:24.980
I don't call you itchy bitch.
Don't call me red.
Why did you call him itchy?

1060
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:26.430
Because he was a real blow.
I don't know.

1061
01:04:26.431 --> 01:04:28.650
Cause he always looked like you needed lunch.
What are you doing over there?

1062
01:04:28.651 --> 01:04:31.380
Answering emails look like you needed to be stretched.

1063
01:04:31.381 --> 01:04:36.330
He always looked dry and my sister nickname was may.
Pop May pop.
Yeah.

1064
01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.120
Why may pop?
I don't fucking know Joe.
Well,

1065
01:04:39.121 --> 01:04:42.570
we got the names from Papa's flower.

1066
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:48.320
It's a state flower.
Somewhere I may pop is a flower bouquet.

1067
01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:52.950
That's how I learned it may pop,
may pop,
may pop flower.

1068
01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:58.150
Is that a flower?
A and I don't know.
I seen it somewhere.
I might be wrong.

1069
01:04:58.370 --> 01:05:01.080
Yeah,
it's beautiful.
It's purple,
purple passion flower.

1070
01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:04.740
I have no idea why they,
maybe they thought she was a flight.

1071
01:05:04.741 --> 01:05:09.240
She was really pretty before.
Crack passive flora in Karnataka.

1072
01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:12.690
Yeah.
That's beautiful.
I know my Mama didn't read this shit.

1073
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:17.100
A commonly known as maypops Purple Passion Flower.
The Passion Flower Wild

1074
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:22.390
<v 3>and a wild passion vine.
A fast growing perineal vine.</v>

1075
01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:25.660
Well,
it's beautiful flower though.

1076
01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:29.560
If you want to call somebody something like that.
I mean that's a nice thing.

1077
01:05:29.730 --> 01:05:32.600
It was crazy because it's wide open,
so that's replicating.

1078
01:05:32.601 --> 01:05:36.040
Then replicate her legs.
Her legs were always wide open

1079
01:05:37.610 --> 01:05:42.560
<v 2>there.
She,
yeah,
but her name was may pop.
And I have a brother is named George.</v>

1080
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:47.720
We called him Beau.
Beau.
Yeah,
he's biracial.
He's really biracial.

1081
01:05:47.721 --> 01:05:50.930
But my Mama said we all got the same daddy ain't no fucking way when his main

1082
01:05:50.931 --> 01:05:52.730
black is fucking cooter brown.

1083
01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:57.920
So how Beau is a biracial,
he looked like he's white.

1084
01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:01.970
He looks like he's one fuck Yale.
He's,
yeah,
he looked like he white.

1085
01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:05.660
But your mother says it comes from something.
Dot.
Yes.
And he's a junior.

1086
01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:07.950
So I was like,
I know what day to beat y'all.

1087
01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:14.000
Who had a fuck.
Cause when I gave writer,

1088
01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:15.440
when I gained a writer,

1089
01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:18.890
my brother's and sister's pictures so she can kind of visualize what I'm talking

1090
01:06:18.891 --> 01:06:21.320
about.
She was like,
who is this little white girl?
I was like,

1091
01:06:21.321 --> 01:06:25.670
that's my oldest brother.
Wow.
She thought he was a little white girl.

1092
01:06:26.270 --> 01:06:29.840
Jesus.
Yeah.
But he's black.
I mean,
but I don't know what he is.

1093
01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:34.280
We don't talk about it.
What's he in jail for?

1094

For what?
Uh,

1096
01:06:45.621 --> 01:06:47.000
she ran over to crack here.
Me and my,

1097
01:06:47.001 --> 01:06:51.260
I told you that she backed up over too many times and they gave her two years

1098
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:57.740
transvestite.
My cousin,
transvestite girlfriend.
Right,
right.
Yeah.

1099
01:06:57.830 --> 01:07:00.950
I forgot about she's done.
She's out now.
For those who haven't heard that story,

1100
01:07:00.951 --> 01:07:05.840
refer to podcast number one.
Yeah,
it was bad.
So she's out now.
She's out now.

1101
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:08.840
Yeah.
She's uh,
in a drug program.

1102
01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.450
She's getting her tokens day by day,
I guess.

1103
01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:12.270
<v 3>I don't know.</v>

1104
01:07:12.270 --> 01:07:15.840
Now when they see you being successful and becoming famous and doing really
well,

1105
01:07:15.841 --> 01:07:17.220
and they go to see you at a comedy club,

1106
01:07:17.221 --> 01:07:21.060
it's 300 white people laughing and having a great time.

1107
01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:23.290
They happy for you,
like,

1108
01:07:23.970 --> 01:07:28.490
<v 2>uh,
you know,
I don't think they,
I don't really think they,
they,</v>

1109
01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:33.290
they come,
they got it yet,
you know,
they still think,
oh,
just out here,
you know,

1110
01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:34.041
open Mike.

1111
01:07:34.041 --> 01:07:38.000
And I don't think they know what I'm exactly doing because I'm not on TV.

1112
01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:40.070
So if you ain't on TV to black people,
you ain't made it.

1113
01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:44.260
But you're on Ari fear show.
Oh,
it's comedy central show.
That's going to be a,

1114
01:07:44.261 --> 01:07:48.440
I think it's this Thursday.
No,
it's next week.
They changed.
No,
they changed.

1115
01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.630
My sustainer wasn't no fucking comedy.

1116
01:07:50.631 --> 01:07:54.650
Saint Jo and I watch comedy central even though you're on it.
No.
Why not?

1117
01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.010
Uh,
she probably ain't got k before.
First of all,

1118
01:07:58.011 --> 01:08:02.770
she just asked me for $20 and pay her rent.
So got cable.

1119
01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:07.490
I don't know.
I don't know.
Hmm.
I'm a call.
I need to call and say,
Hey,

1120
01:08:07.491 --> 01:08:08.490
you got comedy central.
You,

1121
01:08:08.491 --> 01:08:12.020
you should watch me should have a viewing party for your friends back in India.

1122
01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.570
Family.
You don't have them over.

1123
01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:17.120
Your family's not in Indianapolis is not in Atlanta.

1124
01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:21.650
So you don't want to have him fly out just to,
uh,
who got their cat of money.

1125
01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:25.950
They ain't never been on no plane.
They've never been on a plane no less.
Wow.

1126
01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.040
They'd been on a bus going to court.

1127
01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:34.670
They ain't never been on a plane.
I didn't start flying until I,
um,

1128
01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:38.390
became a comedian.
Really?
How old were you the first time he got on an airplane?

1129
01:08:39.290 --> 01:08:44.060
What I've been doing this what?
Let them 12 years.
Late twenties.

1130
01:08:44.610 --> 01:08:47.310
<v 3>Wow.
So the first time you got an airplane,
we shit in your pants.</v>

1131
01:08:47.530 --> 01:08:48.730
<v 2>I had somebody to go with me.</v>

1132
01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:52.120
I had a friend who worked at the airline and you know,
my mom,
just people,

1133
01:08:52.150 --> 01:08:55.750
black people scared to fly.
That is so fucking true.

1134
01:08:55.900 --> 01:09:00.070
We were other drive 25 hours to get on the plane.
Honestly,

1135
01:09:00.071 --> 01:09:02.770
you might think I'm allowing my granddad and married this lady who has some

1136
01:09:02.771 --> 01:09:06.700
money and she said,
your grandfather,
my grandfather,
he's dead now.

1137
01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:09.940
He married this lady who has some money and he did.

1138
01:09:09.941 --> 01:09:11.500
She wanted to go on a honeymoon.
He was like,

1139
01:09:11.530 --> 01:09:13.720
I don't want to go on a fucking plane and his man,

1140
01:09:13.721 --> 01:09:17.050
and he's 68 so she talked to him.
I want to get on a plane.

1141
01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:19.870
He came back and divorce that bitch.
He said,

1142
01:09:19.871 --> 01:09:22.780
I told that bitch I didn't want to fly.
Why?

1143
01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:25.150
He came back from the honeymoon and they never lived together.

1144
01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:29.860
Just because she made him fly.
She made him fly.
Wow.
So I was always scared.

1145
01:09:29.861 --> 01:09:33.610
My mom was like,
we don't get on a fucking plane.
It ain't for us.

1146
01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:36.820
What was the Gig?
It ain't for us.
White people are better than you.

1147
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:39.790
Don't get on a plane.
She was saying white people,
only white people fly.

1148
01:09:39.791 --> 01:09:42.940
Y'All like dying in the air when you smoke,
when you light my cigarette,

1149
01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:48.970
this is how you make my drink.
This is how you keep a wall in your back pocket.

1150
01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:51.430
Basically everything your mother told you was wrong.

1151
01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:56.050
Did she ever give you any good advice?
Uh,
no.
No,
no,

1152
01:09:56.051 --> 01:09:59.770
she did.
She didn't know.
She didn't know.
I don't have any fault.

1153
01:09:59.771 --> 01:10:03.490
You know what I said my mama did the best she could because she could have been

1154
01:10:03.491 --> 01:10:07.030
like these new bitches of the day and just dropped us off and kept going.

1155
01:10:07.031 --> 01:10:08.830
You know,
these whole leaving the babies at the mall,

1156
01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:13.420
she struggled with her five kids.
I think I,
you know,
she was,

1157
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:16.210
she gave us what she was handed down.
Right.

1158
01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:19.660
And until somebody tap you on the shoulder,
say,
hey,
it's different shit out here.

1159
01:10:19.661 --> 01:10:22.990
Let's try something different like my husband did with me,
then you don't know.

1160
01:10:23.170 --> 01:10:27.280
I mean I got cousins who live in just like my Mama,
all these different,

1161
01:10:27.281 --> 01:10:32.060
I mean all of these kids and welfare and no job.
It just,
it's,

1162
01:10:32.230 --> 01:10:36.910
it just keeps being handed down.
Criminal activity,
going to jail,
you know,

1163
01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:40.660
date.
Like my brother got two kids and I follow them on Instagram.
Right.

1164
01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:45.430
And they always in the hood,
got all my friends joy.
I'm fresh in this bitch.

1165
01:10:45.610 --> 01:10:49.240
And I said,
look at these stupid motherfuckers.
Look at these stupid motherfucker.

1166
01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:53.680
I'm about to go wait in line for tennis shoes.
Really?
Motherfucker.
Really?

1167
01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:58.070
But that's it.
That's all they know in their atmosphere.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean

1168
01:10:58.070 --> 01:11:00.800
<v 3>that's what you,
you saw and you became the same,</v>

1169
01:11:00.801 --> 01:11:03.440
but your children are seeing something different.
I mean,

1170
01:11:03.441 --> 01:11:06.710
that's what's really fascinating,
especially as you become successful.

1171
01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:09.920
You're children are seeing a you that's learned and grown.

1172
01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.860
And as we've talked about this last time you were on here,

1173
01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:16.470
the conversations that you had with your daughter,
when you kind of,
you know,

1174
01:11:16.471 --> 01:11:18.780
you've let your daughter know like,
look,
this is me.

1175
01:11:18.781 --> 01:11:20.340
I was very young when I had you.

1176
01:11:20.341 --> 01:11:24.000
And I've learned some things and along the way I've become a better person in a

1177
01:11:24.001 --> 01:11:26.130
different person and you're a different person,

1178
01:11:26.131 --> 01:11:28.740
a better person than I was when I was your age.
You know?

1179
01:11:28.741 --> 01:11:32.630
And it's like this information that you're picking up,
you're,

1180
01:11:32.650 --> 01:11:35.010
you're spreading your kids,
you,
you broke the chain,
you know,

1181
01:11:35.011 --> 01:11:37.760
you've broken the cycle.
That's kind to be very happy for you.

1182
01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:42.370
<v 2>One of the concerns I had was dropouts.
Nobody graduated.</v>

1183
01:11:42.610 --> 01:11:46.180
Like I dropped out in eighth and my sister dropped out and mom and him,

1184
01:11:46.190 --> 01:11:50.590
everybody going to jail and teenage pregnancy.
I said to myself,

1185
01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:55.330
you motherfuckers would not be fucking my baby at 14 I don't know who

1186
01:11:55.331 --> 01:11:58.590
motherfuckers I was talking about,
but I'm just talking about in general.
Right.

1187
01:11:59.290 --> 01:12:02.210
Well she ended up being gay so she could have used a little dick

1188
01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:08.090
<v 3>that she's gay by nature or</v>

1189
01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:12.720
<v 2>uh,
I don't know cause she said she was born gay.</v>

1190
01:12:12.721 --> 01:12:14.340
I said not according to the ultrasound.

1191
01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:18.750
The ultrasound says whether you're gay or not.
She wasn't sucking no.

1192
01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:20.070
Mean when she was in my stomach.

1193
01:12:20.071 --> 01:12:22.070
So I don't know where she get that had been from,

1194
01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:29.820
not a court.
I don't know.
She say she was born that away.

1195
01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:34.200
Don't trust her.
I mean if she says that,
if she said
now,

1196
01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:35.563
I think,

1197
01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:40.800
I think also that my daughter did not have a good example of what a man should

1198
01:12:40.801 --> 01:12:43.500
have been because she always saw her daddy beat me.

1199
01:12:43.501 --> 01:12:47.160
She was there when her daddy shot me.
She was dealt with all of the abuse,

1200
01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:49.770
all the way,
half of the bitches.
I caught him cheating with my daughter,

1201
01:12:49.771 --> 01:12:54.720
took me to the house.
Right.
So her,
her vision of a man at that time was like,

1202
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:58.230
she was like,
I don't like boys.
I can remember her as a little girl saying,

1203
01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.360
I don't like boys because they hit you.

1204
01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:04.620
<v 3>Mm.
Well,
that there is that,
um,
the,</v>

1205
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:07.040
that that is a factor for sure.

1206
01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:12.020
That women that have been abused,
that have turned to gay relationships.

1207
01:13:12.021 --> 01:13:15.470
There's women that weren't gay when they were young or didn't think they were

1208
01:13:15.471 --> 01:13:18.260
gay when they're young.
They were,
they were involved in Male,

1209
01:13:18.261 --> 01:13:19.670
female relationships,
but they got,

1210
01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:23.180
they encountered so many assholes that they just wanted love.

1211
01:13:23.181 --> 01:13:28.181
And it's more acceptable for a woman to become gay too than a man to become gay.

1212
01:13:28.311 --> 01:13:31.160
For a guy to become gay.
It's very difficult for straight.
Yeah.

1213
01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:35.180
<v 2>Can't go back.
No,
we can't go back.
Yeah.
You know,
I as pop,
they see it.</v>

1214
01:13:35.470 --> 01:13:38.890
<v 3>Yeah.
No Man cares if a woman has lesbian relationships,
it's nice.</v>

1215
01:13:38.891 --> 01:13:43.240
It's like you took a break from deck.
It's like you're a virgin reborn,
you know,

1216
01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:44.740
men don't mind.
They think it's hot.

1217
01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:47.180
<v 2>Well my daughter,
she's not,
she doesn't do that,
you know,</v>

1218
01:13:47.181 --> 01:13:50.270
switching back and forth.
She's just strictly,
I always have been,

1219
01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:55.190
I mean I can remember we thought it noticing like I said around middle school,

1220
01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.900
my eye,
we went over my super saved mother-in-law house.
She,

1221
01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.390
she talks me her safe.
She's super safe.

1222
01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:03.620
I should do is pray and this is what she told my husband.

1223
01:14:03.621 --> 01:14:07.010
She said Y'all need to pray for this girl.
She got a gay spirit.

1224
01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:11.070
Oh my.

1225
01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:15.100
Cause me and my mother in law at the time wasn't really tight so I was like fuck

1226
01:14:15.101 --> 01:14:17.530
her and we need to pray for a whole week cause he's dried out.

1227
01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:23.260
But she had a gay spirit.
That's what she told my husband.

1228
01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:24.950
She didn't tell me that cause I would,

1229
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
I probably would've cussed her ass out old was your daughter when my daughter

1230
01:14:28.001 --> 01:14:30.070
was probably nine,

1231
01:14:31.010 --> 01:14:33.010
when she was nine or 10,

1232
01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:37.400
we t we was over my mother in law house and when I got home my husband said,

1233
01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:42.760
my mother said Ashley has a gay spirit on her.
But if you asked Ashley,

1234
01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.760
she said she'd been gay since elementary.

1235
01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:50.380
I mean she said she knew when she really started liking girls and elementary.

1236
01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:52.390
Well,
it,
what's interesting is that you

1237
01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:53.170
<v 3>variances,</v>

1238
01:14:53.170 --> 01:14:56.690
same sort of thing that she experienced when meaning that your mother was abused

1239
01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:59.000
by your father and uh,
she,

1240
01:14:59.001 --> 01:15:03.020
you saw violence and you saw a young pregnancy and all that stuff,

1241
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:07.950
but her reaction was very different than your reaction.
You love men.
Yeah.

1242
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:11.450
I've never been with a woman,
so I tend to think she's probably,

1243
01:15:11.451 --> 01:15:14.000
it's probably a little bit of both.
You know,
she was probably born,

1244
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:17.010
I mean obviously people are born gay,
right?
I would,

1245
01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:20.870
I got assume I got some gay neighbors.
I can't imagine these dudes with a check.

1246
01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:23.330
They're gay.
They're gay as fuck.
They've always come.

1247
01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.920
<v 2>I've seen little kids,
they act like they,
you know,</v>

1248
01:15:27.150 --> 01:15:29.640
I do believe that people can be born gay

1249
01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:33.130
healing the split.
I like,
I got a nephew,

1250
01:15:33.690 --> 01:15:36.490
I got a nephew and his song hit us play

1251
01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:42.210
like he was a fucking girl and I was like,
oh my God,
everybody is gay.

1252
01:15:42.630 --> 01:15:45.930
<v 3>Whoa.
Hold on.
Maybe just like John Claude van Damme movies.</v>

1253
01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.250
Let's throw some kicks.

1254
01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:52.580
<v 2>No,
no,
he was in a split,
like a cheerleader cheering.</v>

1255
01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:55.130
Tada.
Tada.
Use by five.

1256
01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:59.100
But I have a nephew and I notice gate.
Okay.

1257
01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:02.930
And he called me like when he was younger,

1258
01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:06.530
I think he's about probably probably 12 now,
but he called me one day.

1259
01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:11.680
He started looking gay real young to me,
but he called me real young.

1260
01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:12.551
Like how,

1261
01:16:12.551 --> 01:16:16.790
how was that about seven he just had those Tennessee and his mama would say your

1262
01:16:16.791 --> 01:16:18.070
brother,
because he's my brother's son.

1263
01:16:18.170 --> 01:16:22.370
Your brother need to be around my son because he liked my shoes and he liked my

1264
01:16:22.371 --> 01:16:26.240
clothing,
like my weeds.
So you kind of ignore it as just a boy and you know,

1265
01:16:26.241 --> 01:16:27.320
trying to find herself.

1266
01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:30.560
But my nephew called me a couple of years back and he's like,

1267
01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:35.310
cause he think I'm famous.
And he was an Unti.
Do you?
Uh,
I'm singing,

1268
01:16:35.370 --> 01:16:37.190
I'm in a singing group.
I said,
Oh really?

1269
01:16:37.191 --> 01:16:40.400
So you know you're thinking it's a black kid.
He rnb singer or a rapper.

1270
01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:43.000
So I saw what you singing babies?
My,
Oh my,

1271
01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:47.060
me and my group be singing all the single ladies.
What the fuck?

1272
01:16:49.610 --> 01:16:54.610
I said he seems to be us say songs and Rihanna song and he'd be sitting me gas.

1273
01:16:57.171 --> 01:17:01.400
Very helpful was I be telling him he's 14.

1274
01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:05.300
He fight a lot because my brother just told me fight a lot at school because

1275
01:17:05.301 --> 01:17:09.710
kids mess with him at school a lot.
But so I think he's gay.

1276
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:13.430
I just think,
you know,
I think he's gay,
but you don't know he's gay.
So he needs,

1277
01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:17.720
once he find himself and and,
and not worry about what other people think of him,

1278
01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:21.320
then he'll come out to be gay.
Like I got a lot of gay people in my family.

1279
01:17:22.090 --> 01:17:24.040
<v 3>Interesting.
It sounds like he's gay.</v>

1280
01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.240
<v 2>I think he's gay.
He's it.
All the single ladies and can dance.</v>

1281
01:17:29.241 --> 01:17:32.210
He can twerk like a pussy and between his leg.

1282
01:17:32.670 --> 01:17:35.000
Oh you are?

1283
01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:40.340
I'm telling you my nephew can cut a road block.

1284
01:17:40.341 --> 01:17:44.420
A girl cuts a rug cut around.
That's an expression you don't hear anymore.
No,

1285
01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:48.740
Kinda rough.
Cut a road.
I was like,
Lord have mercy.

1286
01:17:48.741 --> 01:17:50.600
This isn't Glarus all though.
Right?

1287
01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:56.100
<v 3>Stretching,
stretching.
No.</v>

1288
01:17:56.290 --> 01:17:59.470
See I could do a split.
Oh Shit just made me gay.

1289
01:17:59.910 --> 01:18:03.210
<v 2>No,
I'm just making a gay that.
Look man,
that ain't what my nuts man.</v>

1290
01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:07.500
My nephew said on his balls on his balls.

1291
01:18:08.370 --> 01:18:11.460
You know how girl hit is splitting off of John and write down the flow you got

1292
01:18:11.461 --> 01:18:13.280
Jessie just prayed like this is my nephew said

1293
01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:16.290
<v 3>this is a little kid that used to live in my neighborhood who was gay as fuck</v>

1294
01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:19.330
and he was only like five years old and his mother was trying to get them into

1295
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:20.430
football.
It was hilarious.

1296
01:18:20.810 --> 01:18:24.630
Like they were trying to get them to do manly stuff and he just wanted to play

1297
01:18:24.631 --> 01:18:27.640
with dolls and you just want to play with girls.
And He,

1298
01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:31.290
like his mother was talking to my wife,
you know,

1299
01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:34.380
and trying to like figure out a way,

1300
01:18:34.381 --> 01:18:37.060
like I just want to get them to get enough football.

1301
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:40.680
I just think that if he's around more men and like,
I'm like,
oh no,

1302
01:18:40.710 --> 01:18:45.100
like she's in denial.
Like she doesn't want a gay son.
It just like,
she,

1303
01:18:45.101 --> 01:18:47.030
you could tell she was like resisting this.

1304
01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:51.330
It was upsetting her and it was almost like she was like reaching out to try to

1305
01:18:51.331 --> 01:18:55.260
get someone to say,
yeah,
yeah,
if you just get them into football,
it's just a,

1306
01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:59.910
that'll fix him.
Yeah.
He'll just turn straight.
Meanwhile,
he was like,

1307
01:18:59.970 --> 01:19:01.680
I love you until I,
it's can I play with you?

1308
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:06.840
Like he was gay and he's a little gay guy,
you know,
she just,

1309
01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:11.520
she didn't want to accept it.
Yeah.
It's weird.
Yeah.
Oh,
he's,
he's born like that.

1310
01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:16.410
Yeah,
definitely.
I mean,
there was a study they did in Rome,

1311
01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:20.310
some,
some Italian University,
um,
where they,

1312
01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:25.790
they believe that with gay men that it's a variation of the x chromosome because

1313
01:19:26.101 --> 01:19:30.960
they found that women who were promiscuous,
like ultra promiscuous,

1314
01:19:31.170 --> 01:19:35.400
had greater instances of homosexual male sons.

1315
01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:37.840
And so that they thought

1316
01:19:39.810 --> 01:19:43.860
what they thought was that it's possible that some women,

1317
01:19:43.861 --> 01:19:47.970
like some people are just hyper sexual.
Like there's,

1318
01:19:47.971 --> 01:19:49.920
there's different levels just like this,

1319
01:19:49.921 --> 01:19:53.520
different levels of intelligence and different levels of,
you know,

1320
01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:56.850
some people have great singing voices,
some people would just,
they,

1321
01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:01.170
sex feels better to them.
They're more attracted to it.
They want it all the time.

1322
01:20:01.171 --> 01:20:03.930
It's,
some girls could not be with one man.

1323
01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:09.090
And when they found women who are just almost like a chronically promiscuous

1324
01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:14.300
and,
uh,
not just promiscuous,
but,
uh,
we're,
we would cheat on their husbands,

1325
01:20:14.301 --> 01:20:16.470
cheat on their boyfriends and just fucked everybody.
They could.

1326
01:20:16.890 --> 01:20:21.890
Those women had a greater instance of having gay sons and they felt like this is

1327
01:20:21.961 --> 01:20:23.730
probably like there's a genetic,

1328
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:28.900
<v 2>so they liked the most deep it get passed down to the sun like in,
Yup.
Yup.
Yeah,</v>

1329
01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:31.540
that it literally passed down through my nephew,

1330
01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:35.570
mom and acts like a lot of variety

1331
01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:42.070
because my nephew,
he be sending me video,
I was like Lord have mercy,

1332
01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:46.630
the videos a day and they were a w uh,
with my kids.
And you know my son,

1333
01:20:46.631 --> 01:20:49.690
I have a 14 year old son.
So at the time they just been my three,

1334
01:20:49.691 --> 01:20:52.230
four years ago and so I got them there cause you know,

1335
01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:54.790
kind of get them to bond because they cousin,
they don't get to see each other.

1336
01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:58.550
So my son come back,
sorry Mama,
what's wrong with him?
I said,

1337
01:20:58.551 --> 01:21:02.170
well what do you mean he didn't want to sit there and let the water hit his

1338
01:21:02.171 --> 01:21:06.230
balls,
his water,
his boss,
what water?
You know,

1339
01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:09.180
they would go down in their walk down pool.
[inaudible]

1340
01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:11.070
would just set up and let the water hit him with

1341
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:17.260
my kid and my son was gay.
I said,
shut the fuck up.

1342
01:21:17.261 --> 01:21:22.200
He ain't gay and now look,
he was right.
I mean he haven't came out yet.

1343
01:21:22.201 --> 01:21:25.610
You Not Ganti you say
me.

1344
01:21:25.670 --> 01:21:30.370
My daughter was not gay until she told me over the phone.
We assume she was gay,

1345
01:21:30.670 --> 01:21:34.420
but she was gay.
Before that you just did.
She went to college just to eat pussy.

1346
01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:38.560
She went to college and lost her fucking mind.

1347
01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:40.910
Justi pussy or she read a couple of books.

1348
01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:46.320
I think her major was eating pussy.
She,

1349
01:21:46.450 --> 01:21:48.320
she lost her mind in college.

1350
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:52.940
<v 3>More accepting of a girl,
daughter,
a daughter being gay or a son being gay.</v>

1351
01:21:54.190 --> 01:21:58.970
Like if you think about your girl eating pussy,
you know,
I'm sure it's kind of,

1352
01:21:59.570 --> 01:22:00.830
you know,
it takes a while to get used to.

1353
01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:04.040
But is that the same as your son taken it in the ass?

1354
01:22:04.180 --> 01:22:08.350
<v 2>Yeah,
I would think that that would be,</v>

1355
01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:13.010
I would think that would be a on the hierarchy.

1356
01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:15.530
<v 3>Key of a sexual acceptance.</v>

1357
01:22:16.230 --> 01:22:18.710
<v 2>More difficulty.
I don't know.
Dell,</v>

1358
01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:22.610
I'm glad my daughter's not disturbed in the relationship.
Right.

1359
01:22:22.630 --> 01:22:27.460
And she's the woman,
she's the woman.
What is her,
her girlfriend like?
Ah,

1360
01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:33.760
butch.
Jeb Bush cheeks with uh,
with the,
she was dating a white cheek.

1361
01:22:33.761 --> 01:22:37.210
She just dumped her.
I liked her.
Oh my God.
I liked this white girl,
but she,

1362
01:22:37.630 --> 01:22:39.430
my daughter home,
I told my daughter,
I said,

1363
01:22:39.431 --> 01:22:44.431
I'm so glad you gay because of you took as much decreased as you eat much pussy

1364
01:22:44.711 --> 01:22:49.450
you will be wore out,
wore out,
wore out.
It wouldn't be nothing in writing.
No,

1365
01:22:49.451 --> 01:22:53.050
she just,
she just,
she is a whore.
Oh,

1366
01:22:53.051 --> 01:22:55.960
how dare I not like that.
I mean she liked,
she liked,

1367
01:22:55.961 --> 01:23:00.080
I think she just got to switch them up too much.
Switch them up tomorrow.
Yes.

1368
01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:02.290
I'm tired of this.
How it's time to go on until the next one.

1369
01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:06.310
And she'd never say they're my girlfriend.

1370
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:10.690
<v 1>She say these are my friends.
So what do people say when they like a lot of six?</v>

1371
01:23:10.691 --> 01:23:12.370
They,
everybody's their friends.

1372
01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:16.160
That's what people say when they were like a lot of sex.
I think so clean.

1373
01:23:16.170 --> 01:23:20.740
Never heard that before.
I've never heard that before.
Zeroes are guys from girls,

1374
01:23:20.741 --> 01:23:23.010
you know,
they didn't give you,
hey,
you show up,
but this,

1375
01:23:23.090 --> 01:23:26.530
when you see somebody with different people all the time and then they have like

1376
01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:30.580
maybe six month relationship in three months relationship and then you look up

1377
01:23:30.581 --> 01:23:34.870
and they with somebody else.
To me that's a person that's a greedy ass person.

1378
01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:36.790
Hmm.
I haven't known this done.

1379
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.770
You know one thing that you guys do notice is when girls don't have any

1380
01:23:41.771 --> 01:23:45.670
girlfriends is when they're only have a bunch of men friends through our girls

1381
01:23:45.671 --> 01:23:49.300
are just have girlfriends and to a gal.

1382
01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:54.900
Every one of those girls that I've ever met that just has male friends and just

1383
01:23:55.890 --> 01:23:59.460
do
everybody,
don't fuck.

1384
01:23:59.470 --> 01:24:04.300
Don't on the sneak temp on the needs.
We go play tennis.
Yeah.

1385
01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:09.670
Fucking fuck it in the car.
Everywhere.
Everywhere.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
I mean,

1386
01:24:09.671 --> 01:24:13.150
I wouldn't know.
I don't do stuff like that.
I understand my,
I,
I,

1387
01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:17.260
I wasn't going to treat my vagina like that.
All right.
I already started early.

1388
01:24:17.290 --> 01:24:18.640
That was a lot of stress down.

1389
01:24:18.730 --> 01:24:22.210
I shouldn't say to a girl because I do know some girls.
I should take that back.

1390
01:24:24.130 --> 01:24:28.150
They'll sleep with their girlfriends.
It is so popular.
Yeah.

1391
01:24:28.151 --> 01:24:28.841
They don't give a fuck.

1392
01:24:28.841 --> 01:24:31.240
They have a relationship with our girlfriend said we just got high and try

1393
01:24:31.241 --> 01:24:34.100
something new.
I'd like to hit each other on the aids.

1394
01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:35.890
Like when my daughter was in high school,

1395
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:38.800
all the girls would hit each other on the ass and I'm like,
well y'all get up.

1396
01:24:38.860 --> 01:24:42.060
You don't.
You don't wait a minute.
Hit you say hit each other on the ass.
Yeah.

1397
01:24:42.061 --> 01:24:46.390
You don't like they titties hit they titties.
Yeah.

1398
01:24:46.391 --> 01:24:50.500
They bumped titties.
Really?
Going on.
Where you come from Joe.

1399
01:24:50.710 --> 01:24:55.420
You don't have teenage kids grew up in Boston.
Oh,
I was too cold.
Teddy bumping.

1400
01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:01.000
Well especially
well,
yeah,
they do all count.
All freaky stuff with each other.

1401
01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:04.990
Yeah,
that kiss,
that girlfriend.
I never thought about doing shit like that.

1402
01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:09.420
It wasn't going on when I was a kid.
It's pouring,
man.
It's so popular now because

1403
01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:15.520
even when I'm a girl,
I still won't get dressed in front of my girlfriend.

1404
01:25:15.521 --> 01:25:17.890
What made you,
I'm going in his bathroom and fill up.
My pain is over.

1405
01:25:18.130 --> 01:25:22.870
They don't get fucked over.
What is it?
A pancake or a panic.

1406
01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:29.680
You cooking a burger and she was done on the other side.

1407
01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:34.730
You turn them over inside out

1408
01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:40.080
giving you a busy,
that's not a good visual.

1409
01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:45.250
Don't give a fuck what they do these days.
They don't give a fuck.

1410
01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:48.080
I think Brian's right.
I think it's a porn thing because the,

1411
01:25:48.090 --> 01:25:51.730
the shaving of the vaginas when I was in high school didn't exist.

1412
01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:55.060
Girls or jungles down there and now every,
not that I know.

1413
01:25:55.061 --> 01:25:58.240
High school girls pussies these days.
You probably right,

1414
01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:01.910
but I would think that women today,
like the reason why they trim,

1415
01:26:01.911 --> 01:26:05.800
I'm like that it's directly to porn and like they will have sex now when,

1416
01:26:05.850 --> 01:26:10.250
when even when I was starting young,
if you gave it up,
you wanted a relationship.

1417
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:11.720
They don't,
they don't give a fuck.

1418
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:14.000
You can have sex with me and I never got to speak to me again.

1419
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.020
I just wanted to try it out.

1420
01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:18.110
Like it's a fucking ice cream and if you didn't like it,
just throw it away.

1421
01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:21.220
Wait a minute.
There was a lot of girls that used to fuck and didn't want it.

1422
01:26:21.221 --> 01:26:25.470
Relationships though.
That's not where I come from.
Indianapolis.
No,

1423
01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:28.610
I'm from Atlanta.
Atlanta.
When girls would have sex with a man,

1424
01:26:28.611 --> 01:26:30.710
they wanted a relationship.
My neighborhood.
Yeah,

1425
01:26:30.711 --> 01:26:34.220
they you live that was a boyfriend.
It wasn't just no random dude.

1426
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:36.050
You know you would say that little light.

1427
01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:40.550
Are you going to do you want to be my girlfriend?
Check yes or no?
Yes.

1428
01:26:40.670 --> 01:26:43.970
So that's what I told my baby daddy.
Even though he was 22 man,

1429
01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:49.910
I wanted a relationship and you know,
you give it up,
you want it to be special.

1430
01:26:49.930 --> 01:26:52.620
Now they just have sex and they don't,
they don't give a fuck.

1431
01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:57.880
I grew up where we had like girls that just wanted to fuck and they looked like

1432
01:26:58.040 --> 01:27:01.250
there was like a sewer behind her apartment and all like the popular kids would

1433
01:27:01.251 --> 01:27:03.770
go down there and they'll go inside this sewer and fuck him in the center.

1434
01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:06.470
Sue and that would just like line up pretty much just

1435
01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:12.880
tried drain ditch for water.
It's not sewer.
Sewer is where you,

1436
01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:17.870
your shit water rain was like when these huge tubes and just emptied out into

1437
01:27:17.871 --> 01:27:21.320
this big field but it never had anything in there so it would go way back in

1438
01:27:21.321 --> 01:27:23.660
there and somebody put a couch back there at one point.

1439
01:27:24.850 --> 01:27:29.150
Oh and this was like,
oh so you never had sex outside?
Yo Yo whatever now.
Okay.

1440
01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:33.320
Not In the sewer.
Well my kid's side was Mary Woods is normal.

1441
01:27:33.530 --> 01:27:34.760
He didn't have no fucking money.

1442
01:27:34.761 --> 01:27:39.710
So we did it out of time in the graveyard graveyard.
Really Nice.

1443
01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:42.740
Nobody there.
They just looking.
I used to run in graveyards,

1444
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:47.990
do my road work cause I would remind me that I was going to be dead someday.

1445
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:49.670
I was going to be under this ground.

1446
01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:53.420
This is not having any regrets that that's not true.

1447
01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:56.540
You can tell them to cook you and you just be floating in the ocean.

1448
01:27:56.570 --> 01:27:57.290
That's not what I mean.

1449
01:27:57.290 --> 01:28:01.820
I mean being around coach you and you'll be floating in the ocean.

1450
01:28:02.250 --> 01:28:04.420
Just being around cemeteries,

1451
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:08.810
like remind you that this is a temporary thing that one day,
you know,

1452
01:28:08.811 --> 01:28:10.790
you lead to be dead in the ocean,

1453
01:28:10.791 --> 01:28:15.791
float around or they will each in the ocean or you'll be buried either way.

1454
01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:20.170
The idea was that on top,

1455
01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:22.790
because I can't breathe down now I'm claustrophobic,

1456
01:28:22.791 --> 01:28:25.970
so I want you to bear meal top of the ground.
Oh.
Like they do in New Orleans,

1457
01:28:26.150 --> 01:28:29.610
they have those,
they do them in different places if you pay for them,

1458
01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:33.140
well they do it in a lot of places where they have problems with the ground

1459
01:28:33.290 --> 01:28:37.760
being underwater.
Like um,
what did they called the crips,
you know,

1460
01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:39.830
I have no idea.
Yeah,
yeah,
they,
they,

1461
01:28:39.831 --> 01:28:44.060
they make those things at a cement and they build them up.
So you're all,

1462
01:28:44.061 --> 01:28:46.640
everything's above ground.
When my mama passed away,

1463
01:28:46.670 --> 01:28:49.070
I was 16 so I would go to a grave sometime.

1464
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:53.270
So my boyfriend bought her a little tombstone and stuff and I go out there and

1465
01:28:53.271 --> 01:28:58.271
when they were my celiacs and she got an ant pile on top of her or her

1466
01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:01.740
tombstone,
I go to my car,
get gas set at home.

1467
01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:08.550
<v 2>You set the Ann Hill on fire cause it was on your mother's tombstone and I was</v>

1468
01:29:08.551 --> 01:29:11.320
trying to get rid of the ads,
set it on fire.
You got to,

1469
01:29:11.670 --> 01:29:14.890
so everybody's shit out there burning.
I'm about to get a raise.

1470
01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:21.240
So you were pouring gasoline ant pile?

1471
01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:23.790
He was here and I just couldn't,

1472
01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:26.940
I wasn't thinking I was young and didn't answer it on the stone.

1473
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:29.040
Hawes was flat

1474
01:29:30.690 --> 01:29:35.690
like that and so they had built up this big ass pile like well you on top,

1475
01:29:36.150 --> 01:29:39.360
well not on top.
So you know it was on there and I wanted to get it off.

1476
01:29:39.361 --> 01:29:42.380
I caught myself cleaning or gray and I go to my car,

1477
01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:45.350
get just a little gasoline set.
That bitch.
I'm like Ooh.

1478
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:48.660
And her boyfriend is buried next to him.
So he burner,
she burned,

1479
01:29:49.670 --> 01:29:53.190
her boyfriend was buried right next to her boyfriend.

1480
01:29:53.190 --> 01:29:57.660
Was He bought,
he bought the plot next door.
When did he go?

1481
01:29:58.230 --> 01:30:00.150
I don't know.
Cause after she died,
you know,

1482
01:30:00.151 --> 01:30:04.170
she just went to sleep and never woke up.
It ain't,
she wasn't sick.

1483
01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:08.760
I remember talking to her the week that she died because she said come over here

1484
01:30:08.761 --> 01:30:10.900
and I was selling drugs.
So she was like,
Ray,
man,

1485
01:30:10.901 --> 01:30:14.940
I need you to come over here and pay my light.
Bill.
Mom called you rabbit.
Yeah,

1486
01:30:16.050 --> 01:30:19.110
I remember going to the clinic with my Mama one day and she,
my Mama,
you know,

1487
01:30:19.111 --> 01:30:21.450
she was illiterate.
She couldn't read.
I love a rest or so,

1488
01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:26.370
but she couldn't spell our names.
So she said rabbit,
how to spell your real name.

1489
01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:30.090
And so this kid overheard her and say,
Yo Momma dog.

1490
01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:33.420
She can't spell your name.
My mom say,
shut up bitch.
You all know me.

1491
01:30:33.421 --> 01:30:36.060
I dropped out in eighth grade but I was on the ninth grade level.

1492
01:30:36.210 --> 01:30:39.390
So I'm standing there like,
why the fuck did you say that?
That's stupid.

1493
01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:43.910
But because she was in eighth grade and ninth grade level,

1494
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:46.890
probably dropped out in the Er.
I don't know when she dropped out,

1495
01:30:46.891 --> 01:30:51.360
but she dropped out.
Wow.
Your mom,
Connie Robin's dark.

1496
01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.060
Why?
Cause it's your quick selling name.

1497
01:30:54.210 --> 01:30:58.290
Well it wasn't my crack selling named Dan.
That was my nickname.
Oh.

1498
01:30:58.291 --> 01:31:02.550
And to my crack dealer night.
Oh,
so because you can't go on the street name,

1499
01:31:02.551 --> 01:31:06.380
your real name.
Everybody know pooky black May,
may,
may Ma,
you know,

1500
01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:09.450
you know the shit.
They call us in the head.
Everybody got those films.

1501
01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:14.880
You watched those films.
Boyz in the hood and thanks everybody got a nickname.

1502
01:31:15.450 --> 01:31:18.930
So how did you get rapid than if it wasn't a crack dealer named?
What did rabbit,

1503
01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:22.770
I don't know.
They say I like carrots,
raw carrots when I was little,

1504
01:31:23.180 --> 01:31:25.710
but I've always been called rabbit.
Wow.

1505
01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:29.330
So it was like before you can remember you were rabid.
Yeah.
Wow.

1506
01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:33.050
We had a kid and cool.
It's cool to call them onion.
Did you have any idea?

1507
01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:36.300
Did you have a nickname,
Joe?
Growing up for anything?
A nickname?
Nobody.

1508
01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:40.740
Your Momma didn't give anybody a nickname for keys and only one of them got a

1509
01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:42.690
nickname only because he's a junior.

1510
01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:45.720
He knows the sad shit when people give themselves a nickname,

1511
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.400
get the fuck out of here with that.

1512
01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:50.400
Well that's what I want you to guys to start calling me the turbo.

1513
01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:55.800
That's like strippers.
They get a set of nicknames.
Yeah,

1514
01:31:55.801 --> 01:32:00.340
but that's like a stage name.
You know,
it touches.
So Dude's can't be creeping

1515
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:01.700
<v 1>on you.
I had the worst name,</v>

1516
01:32:01.701 --> 01:32:06.060
but people called me poof because my hair was so big.
Like I had like the uh,

1517
01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:10.690
what was popular in that show?
The,
with a 21 jump street?
No.
And the other one,
uh,

1518
01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:13.250
with uh,
Dylan McKay or what's his name?
Yeah.

1519
01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:16.450
I used to have this kind of thing going on,

1520
01:32:16.451 --> 01:32:19.810
so I wanted to do a quick poof and it took me a while to get used to.

1521
01:32:19.930 --> 01:32:24.760
How long did that nicknames took from like a high school to win?

1522
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:28.600
Sort of five years.
You had poof.

1523
01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:31.640
And then like once in a while somebody will run into me that from my old days

1524
01:32:31.641 --> 01:32:35.320
and be like,
poof,
and I'm like,
oh,
he's really don't have nicknames.

1525
01:32:35.321 --> 01:32:37.250
So they'd given their self neat name to be super

1526
01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:39.020
<v 3>cool.
No.
Why kids have nicknames.</v>

1527
01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:42.710
It was a lot of white kids would nicknames just not as popular as black.
So yeah,

1528
01:32:42.711 --> 01:32:46.430
there's a lot of them.
Yeah.
We,
I know a lot of white kids who have nicknames.

1529
01:32:47.690 --> 01:32:51.920
Yeah.
When I was a kid,
when I lived in Newton,
there was this part of Newton,

1530
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:56.420

1531
01:32:56.421 --> 01:33:00.800

It's one part of the country.

1532
01:33:00.801 --> 01:33:01.940
This one part of the city.

1533
01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:06.440
This is one part of this one small suburb where everybody's like Mush,

1534
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:07.970
We've got to go down this fucking thing,

We've got to get this fucking guy mush.

1536
01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:13.670
It's going to go get something to eat mush.
Is it based off the militia mouth?

1537
01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:18.650
Nope.
It's like,

1538
01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:21.050

1555
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.330
I've been listening to podcasts lately and like,
and you know,

1556
01:34:19.630 --> 01:34:22.570
like there's some people that don't understand.
I mean I've,

1557
01:34:22.571 --> 01:34:26.050
I've been guilty of it myself,
but when you listen to it,
you realize it.

1558
01:34:26.051 --> 01:34:27.580
Cause it's a way of saying,
ah,

1559
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:31.450
like some people say fucking this fucking guy with his fucking,

1560
01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:35.470
and what they're really saying is this,
um,
guy with his,
um,

1561
01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:38.410
but they don't want to say,
um,
so they'll say this is fucking,

1562
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:42.880
or they'll say like,
you know,
it's like,

you know this like,

1563
01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:47.410

1564
01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:52.750
Yeah.
Comedians,

They think it no state.
Well,

1565
01:34:52.751 --> 01:34:57.170
sometimes it works.
Like sometimes there's actually,
there's a reason to do it.

1566
01:34:57.171 --> 01:34:58.220
Like you're setting something

1567
01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:00.830
<v 2>up or you're allowing the audience to think along,</v>

1568
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:05.570
like out the every joke,
uh,
uh,
like,

1569
01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:10.400
uh,
he's like,

then you rehearse today,
Huh?
Fuck.

1570
01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:13.850
Do you rehearse your material?
Yes you do.
Well,

1571
01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:16.960
you know I've been shot at a couple of times so I need to get it going and

1572
01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:22.550
not like in the mirror.
I'm gone.
I'm saying this

1573
01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:29.600
as some bull shit there.
I hate that shit.

1574
01:35:29.601 --> 01:35:30.740
Cause when I first started I was like,

1575
01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:32.480
you gotta talk to you see yourself in the mirror.
I'm like,

1576
01:35:32.481 --> 01:35:36.050
what the fuck are you talking about to talk to yourself in the fucking comedians

1577
01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:39.500
who don't know shit about coming?
Yo just rehearsing.
You go on stage,

1578
01:35:39.501 --> 01:35:43.670
you sound like a fucking,
you giving a speech.
And I was like,
I sat on a robotic,

1579
01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:47.210
I don't want to do this bull shit.
So I just started,
you know,

1580
01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:48.770
stopped at rehearsing and shit.

1581
01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:52.340
I go over my set but I'm not going to go in the mirror and said Andy and I said

1582
01:35:52.341 --> 01:35:55.480
this and then I was shot two time and dope nine I'll do that.
Bullshit.

1583
01:35:55.490 --> 01:35:58.760
You write down all the different things you want to talk about because my mind

1584
01:35:58.761 --> 01:36:00.160
is always going and I'm on work.

1585
01:36:00.410 --> 01:36:03.890
I'm always remembering shit from my past and so much going on in my purse.

1586
01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:08.360
You know you're coming so you definitely get a premise every day.
So I mean,

1587
01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:10.760
you know,
most of us do now.

1588
01:36:10.761 --> 01:36:14.040
Do you worry that you're going to eventually run out of stories about your life?

1589
01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:16.440
I'm going to run out of star.

1590
01:36:16.450 --> 01:36:19.820
I can't fucking wait to stop telling these stories to move on.

1591
01:36:19.821 --> 01:36:22.190
It's cause it's gonna be challenging right now.
I'm,

1592
01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:25.220
I'm blessed with so much to talk about.
You know,

1593
01:36:25.221 --> 01:36:28.460
a lot of companies don't have that opportune.
I see white boys ain't did shit.

1594
01:36:28.610 --> 01:36:31.850
They Mama fucking cat jokes in dog jokes

1595
01:36:33.790 --> 01:36:38.510
and I was like shut the fuck up and go rob a liquor store so you can talk about

1596
01:36:38.511 --> 01:36:42.560
something.
Yeah,

1597
01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:46.250
Go Rob a liquor store.
But yeah,
I mean we all,

1598
01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:51.050

1599
01:36:51.051 --> 01:36:54.020
shit in his current light.
You know,
I have a current life.

1600
01:36:54.021 --> 01:36:56.330
A lot of the Shit I talk about now is from my past,

1601
01:36:56.540 --> 01:37:00.140
but I still have a current life.
I mean that I haven't even really gotten to,

1602
01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:02.930
I could probably do it well.
We're working on an hour now.

1603
01:37:03.110 --> 01:37:04.350
That's not even getting,

1604
01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:08.490
only going to show just a small portion of my current life.
You're going to uh,

1605
01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:12.830
put together a comedy special show.
I'm working on it.
I hope so.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1606
01:37:13.010 --> 01:37:16.940
What do you a or would you have a timeline?
We try to do it like,
well,

1607
01:37:16.941 --> 01:37:19.490
I'm talking to her.
Oh,
I'm talking to my managers,

1608
01:37:19.491 --> 01:37:23.090
so we back and forth trying to get it together first.
Or You,

1609
01:37:23.210 --> 01:37:26.060
have you filmed anything?
If you're like,
no,
no,
nothing yet.

1610
01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:28.550
Sometimes it's good to just do a set somewhere,

1611
01:37:28.551 --> 01:37:31.780
film it and then just go over and say,
I can expand on this.
I could,

1612
01:37:31.781 --> 01:37:34.430
do you watch yourself?
Yes.
More.

1613
01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:38.030
The manager that I have forces me to watch and listen to myself.

1614
01:37:38.031 --> 01:37:41.480
I never did it before,
but it helps because you know I'm from the south.

1615
01:37:41.481 --> 01:37:45.350
I can't talk with she.
I fuck up some words and why people stay.
What did you say?

1616
01:37:45.930 --> 01:37:49.400
Yeah,
but it's good.
Like when you,
when you fuck up words,
it's like,
it's fun.

1617
01:37:49.730 --> 01:37:54.710
It's like say like when I first moved from Georgia and then I had this joke

1618
01:37:54.711 --> 01:37:56.280

So go ahead.</v>

1642
01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:35.980

it's not that I don't believe you.
It's just really funny.

1643
01:39:35.981 --> 01:39:40.060
You want to talk to him?
Cock.
That's what a farm.

1644
01:39:40.061 --> 01:39:43.900
He's probably still a fucking up somebody to transmission and was a transmission

1645
01:39:43.901 --> 01:39:47.530
specialists.
No,

he's a fake ass mechanic.
A fake.

1646
01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:52.930
What is a fake mechanic who tell you he knew so he doesn't really know what he's

1647
01:39:52.931 --> 01:39:57.840
doing.
Oh,
hey.
It got him back.
He'd say he fixed costs.
We're really don't.
I mean,

1648
01:39:57.910 --> 01:40:00.190
he ain't went to school for it.
He just be trying some shit.

1649
01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:04.330
So he just fucks around.
He fixed my car.
One time I had a,
um,

1650
01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:09.460
I had a SUV.
I'm on tear route,
so I needed a head job.

1651
01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:12.940
So he told me what the spark plugs kept jumping out the engine.

1652
01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:16.590
So that jumped out of it.
You know,
they kept coming out cause they needed,

1653
01:40:16.690 --> 01:40:21.250
he has stripped to up the hairs on my car.
So instead of saying,
Hey,

1654
01:40:21.251 --> 01:40:24.160
I fucked up here,
your heads,
you know,
you need to get ahead job.

1655
01:40:24.460 --> 01:40:28.630
This boy went on my back porch,
got my Bible,
Q spatular broke that bitch,

1656
01:40:28.631 --> 01:40:32.290
I'll stick it in the engine and screwed that gasket back down.
So I was like,

1657
01:40:32.291 --> 01:40:34.480
the cost still running ragged it.
So I was like,
fuck you,

1658
01:40:34.660 --> 01:40:39.010

She took a barbecue,

1659
01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:43.870
bachelor attached to yours.
You're lucky it didn't explode.

1660
01:40:44.170 --> 01:40:48.040
He say,
look,
I pull up to the dealer shield.
I'm not lying.

1661
01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:51.840
And the man take the thing and he said,

1662
01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:54.040

bachelor.</v>

1664
01:41:00.911 --> 01:41:03.530
That costs me $20 you know what,
I'm real long

1665
01:41:05.630 --> 01:41:10.330
fire.
Yes.
He broke.
That bitch is stuck it in my engine is ridiculous.

1666
01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:12.940
And I was like,
why didn't you do that mother fucker?
He was like,

1667
01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:15.340
I was trying to keep your spark plugs in your engine.

1668
01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:20.530
Then how did he learn anywhere?
Did he go to school?
He's getting better.

1669
01:41:24.460 --> 01:41:29.080
He's getting better.
No more specialist.

1670
01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:34.600
He's at the point where you can trust them.
What an oil change and oil change.

1671
01:41:35.090 --> 01:41:39.680
I will trust my daughter with an oil change.
No,
just him.
Cause he hard

1672
01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:45.990
courts.
This is where they go to.
How fucking hard is that?
Yeah.

1673
01:41:45.991 --> 01:41:50.000
Boy He is horrible.
Oh my God.
That's hilarious.
He's learning.
He's,

1674
01:41:50.050 --> 01:41:53.740
I mean his hand hold training.
Where does he do it all in and wound.

1675
01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:58.450
He got a mobile business,
mobile business.
As soon as he fuck up your car,

1676
01:41:58.451 --> 01:42:02.000
he changed his number.
Oh no he doesn't.
Does he really?

1677
01:42:02.090 --> 01:42:07.090
I got three Anthony's in here
fucking hilarious.

1678
01:42:07.450 --> 01:42:09.550
So he just fucks up people's cars,

1679
01:42:09.551 --> 01:42:13.540
changes his number and just gets ghost get goals.
Do you feel mate?

1680
01:42:13.570 --> 01:42:18.100
He told one lady,
one lady,
one lady told him,

1681
01:42:18.101 --> 01:42:21.820
she said,
Anthony,
you lied to me.
You said you were going to Redo my car.

1682
01:42:21.821 --> 01:42:24.940
My brother said,
look,
you're a bitch.
One thing I don't do is I don't lie.

1683
01:42:25.210 --> 01:42:29.260
What I did was not tell you the truth.
He said,
she said,
bitch you,

1684
01:42:29.290 --> 01:42:32.620
that's still alive.
He is hilarious.

1685
01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:36.610
What I do is not tell you the truth,
but he said he don't lie.

1686
01:42:38.170 --> 01:42:39.870
What's the difference?
Nothing.

1687
01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:48.370
How did we start this mobile business of fixing people's cars and we all got

1688
01:42:48.371 --> 01:42:50.170
busy and we can't work nowhere.

1689
01:42:50.590 --> 01:42:54.370
So he just started working on people's cars and just start bullshitting and

1690
01:42:54.371 --> 01:42:56.620
figured it out along the way.
Yes.
What?

1691
01:42:56.621 --> 01:43:01.000
My stepfather was a mechanic and so all my brothers like him and my brother,

1692
01:43:01.210 --> 01:43:05.380
my brother and my brother and Tony,
they do mechanic work together.
Right?
I mean,

1693
01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:07.750
so they just go out and fuck up people calls.
But he's,

1694
01:43:09.450 --> 01:43:14.380
he fired Tony.
Tony gets social security now.
So he fired Tony.
So it just,

1695
01:43:14.381 --> 01:43:18.340
him by himself be fired him because he gets social security can be a part of the

1696
01:43:18.341 --> 01:43:19.760
team.
He said,
Tony,

1697
01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:28.460
you know,
so security would only let you put in 20 hours.
40 cut.
You check.
Oh,

1698
01:43:30.050 --> 01:43:33.250
I don't know why he fired Tony.
They fight all the fucking time.

1699
01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:36.460
So he's just had to be a lone wolf out there fixing cars.

1700
01:43:36.630 --> 01:43:37.600
Changed your phone numbers,

1701
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:45.550
put a fucking spatulate in your engine.
That is hilarious.

1702
01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:50.020
And then I got it running.
Get you say you want it,
run it.
Yeah.

1703
01:43:50.021 --> 01:43:52.010
Motherfucker but not make it to the stop

1704
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:52.843
<v 2>sign.</v>

1705
01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:56.460
<v 3>Yeah.
Not with a broken spatula.
It'll poke his badge.
I took that.</v>

1706
01:43:56.461 --> 01:43:57.210
She took dealership,

1707
01:43:57.210 --> 01:44:01.470
<v 2>they white dude could not stop laughing.
And I'm like,</v>

1708
01:44:01.510 --> 01:44:03.840
well you laughing.
But that's my good 15,

1709
01:44:03.841 --> 01:44:07.830
$20 bachelor and I'm out of $300 for a head job.

1710
01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:12.450
I thought I got.
Wow.
So he never gave you the money back?
Hell No.

1711
01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:16.770
He got six kids.
He got six kids.

1712
01:44:16.771 --> 01:44:19.810
He got a set of triplets and then he has a,
um,

1713
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:23.640
he has a few more outside kids from his wife,
outside kids

1714
01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:33.100
<v 3>outside kids.
They was keys and can live in his house.
Oh,</v>

1715
01:44:33.110 --> 01:44:36.800
they don't live with him.
Wow.
God Damn.
That is crazy.

1716
01:44:37.110 --> 01:44:40.990
My family is crazy.
You should go.
You just go all and ms pet family towards bad.

1717
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.550
I think what's going to happen next.
Okay.

1718
01:44:43.551 --> 01:44:45.350
What's already happened is you got a book deal.

1719
01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:48.080
What's going to happen next is you're going to have a fucking reality show.

1720
01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:53.810
<v 2>Reality Show.
Why not?
I want a real show.
I mean,
what does that mean?
You know,</v>

1721
01:44:53.811 --> 01:44:57.920
like,
I mean I don't,
I ain't going to say I don't want a reality show,
but

1722
01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:02.760
<v 3>you want a real show like you want to Darren Mack Bernays.
Rosie.
Right,</v>

1723
01:45:02.990 --> 01:45:05.900
I understand.
That makes sense.
And you would be great at that.
However,

1724
01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:10.610
what's really hilarious is the true stories.

1725
01:45:10.850 --> 01:45:14.900
<v 2>And if you want me to put them people on TV,
Joe,
who don't tame that Shit,</v>

1726
01:45:16.230 --> 01:45:18.900
<v 3>you don't have to tame it.
What I'm saying is the difference between,</v>

1727
01:45:18.901 --> 01:45:22.680
like if somebody gets a hold of your life and start turning into a sitcom
script,

1728
01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:25.890
they're not going to do it justice.
They're just not.

1729
01:45:26.130 --> 01:45:29.800
Especially get a bunch of white writers.
It's cable.

1730
01:45:29.820 --> 01:45:33.710
They really gonna be able to capture it.
Yeah,

1731
01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:37.590
but that's different.
The wires,
all fiction,
you know?

1732
01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:42.510
<v 2>No,
it's not.
I live that boy shit.
I don't know what you talking about.
Not,
I mean,</v>

1733
01:45:42.511 --> 01:45:44.250
it's never happens.
I'm like,

1734
01:45:44.251 --> 01:45:49.251
someone wrote all those characters because he was a guy that was a reporter in

1735
01:45:49.321 --> 01:45:53.730
that neighborhood.
That's how that came about.
Go Google it.
What do you mean?

1736
01:45:53.731 --> 01:45:57.150
Who was a reporter who wrote the book?
He was,
yeah,

1737
01:45:57.940 --> 01:45:59.130
he was like a reporter.

1738
01:45:59.131 --> 01:46:02.100
Like he would go out with the police and stuff when all of that stuff was

1739
01:46:02.101 --> 01:46:05.700
happening and he just says,
this was what I heard from my writer.

1740
01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:09.660
He just started to capture that stuff and ended up writing a book.
Well,
I may,

1741
01:46:09.661 --> 01:46:13.290
I believe that,
but a lot of that stuff really went on in DC.

1742
01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:14.980
<v 3>I'm sure it did.
I'm sure it did.</v>

1743
01:46:14.981 --> 01:46:18.370
But the words that they put in the mouse was all created by writers and

1744
01:46:18.371 --> 01:46:20.410
calculated and written out.

1745
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:22.810
<v 2>Have you read it?
If you write stuff about,
if you wrote it,</v>

1746
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:25.160
if you wrote a movie about my past,
I mean,
you know,

1747
01:46:25.170 --> 01:46:27.700
of course you're going to have to,
you know,
kind of torque everything,

1748
01:46:27.701 --> 01:46:31.720
but a lot of work,
tweak,
tweak or whatever you call it,
a Torque,
you know.

1749
01:46:31.721 --> 01:46:33.130
But a lot of it would be missing

1750
01:46:33.170 --> 01:46:34.760
<v 3>pad.
Right.
I believe you,</v>

1751
01:46:34.761 --> 01:46:38.810
but no better way to show the real people.

1752
01:46:38.910 --> 01:46:43.340
<v 2>Well,
kind to show the real people.
What do you mean looking like what?</v>

1753
01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:48.360
Come on a bunch of black people can't talk.
Fighting over a car game.

1754
01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:49.950
Be hilarious.

1755
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:54.310
<v 1>Yeah,
for a little while,
but it wouldn't be hilarious.
Here come air shop.
No.</v>

1756
01:46:54.540 --> 01:46:57.210
And uh,
what is it?
The other bloggers,
Sharpton,

1757
01:46:57.900 --> 01:47:01.760
Jesse Jackson and all the other ones.
This is not high.
I don't know.

1758
01:47:01.761 --> 01:47:04.910
He out his shit from now.
Then you don't have to listen to them talk.

1759
01:47:05.370 --> 01:47:07.380
They don't help you.
They will not help you.

1760
01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:09.480
You get to talk shit about them after they start talking.

1761
01:47:09.810 --> 01:47:10.950
I talk shit about them now.

1762
01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:14.970
But you can be talking shit even stronger if they give you a hard time about

1763
01:47:14.971 --> 01:47:19.770
your show.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Oh,
believe me.
Well,
I'm not telling you what to do.

1764
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:20.970
I mean you do whatever you want to do.

1765
01:47:22.050 --> 01:47:24.450
I'm not going to say I would take anything because I can't,

1766
01:47:24.510 --> 01:47:29.190
I can't see me being the silly fat chick I,
that's not a role for me.
You see,

1767
01:47:29.191 --> 01:47:30.420
the thing is you don't need,

1768
01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:33.120
the thing about a reality show is you don't need a role.

1769
01:47:33.330 --> 01:47:36.540
You can just don't miss paths world and you could narrate it.
You know,

1770
01:47:36.541 --> 01:47:38.280
you could stand in front of the camera and go,

1771
01:47:38.281 --> 01:47:40.650
we're about to meet my fucking brother Anthony,

1772
01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:42.570
who pretends he's a fucking mechanic.

1773
01:47:42.750 --> 01:47:45.830
This stupid motherfucker put a fucking spatially inside my head.

1774
01:47:46.050 --> 01:47:51.050
You can tell that story and then you can do that crazy family that's on TV now.

1775
01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:55.800
That's a lot of show duck dynasty.
No,
not damn Kardashians.

1776
01:47:57.990 --> 01:48:02.430
It's a real sick,
calm,
um,
modern family,
modern,
modern family.

1777
01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:07.140
I never watched that show.
That's a funny show off the boat.
No,

1778
01:48:07.141 --> 01:48:08.910
but that's my friend Eddie Wong Story.

1779
01:48:08.930 --> 01:48:13.920
That fucking shit is anyone do.
That shit is hilarious.

1780
01:48:13.980 --> 01:48:16.950
He's hilarious.
I had to go to the bathroom after watching that show.

1781
01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:19.090
You had to go to the bathroom and pee.
They view okay.

1782
01:48:19.170 --> 01:48:23.820
That shit had my stomach working.
I mean,
Russell's,
I was lacking that.
I edit one.

1783
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.270
If you ain't got nobody else supporting you,
I watch that shit every week.

1784
01:48:27.271 --> 01:48:30.870
My husband record.
I love that show.
It's only two episodes in,

1785
01:48:31.110 --> 01:48:33.040
but y'all need to watch fresh off the boat.
Well,

1786
01:48:33.041 --> 01:48:37.860
it's based on the story of his life that he wrote and he is the narrator and

1787
01:48:37.861 --> 01:48:42.690
there's a little boy who plays him.
The rapper dude.
There was a little boy.

1788
01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:46.920
The young boy plays him and then there's Randall Park who's a comedian and
actor.

1789
01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:49.470
He actually played Kim Jong wound in the

1790
01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:55.920
think he's a rapper.
I didn't,
I haven't seen the show yet,
but it must be him.

1791
01:48:56.340 --> 01:48:59.080
Yeah,
it's a little boy.
He talks like a rapper.
Eddie.

1792
01:48:59.210 --> 01:49:02.400
Eddie talks like he's from Brooklyn.
He grew up in Orlando is funny.

1793
01:49:02.401 --> 01:49:04.520
Your friends show is funny watch.

1794
01:49:04.590 --> 01:49:07.770
He's got a great show on vice to his show on vice.

1795
01:49:07.771 --> 01:49:10.900
It's called off the boat or fresh off the boat with Eddie Wong.
No,

1796
01:49:11.130 --> 01:49:14.840
that's all ABC?
No,
no,
no.
He's got a vice show titles.

1797
01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:20.140
The vice is this channel online vice.com and he has a show on vice.

1798
01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:26.760
That's him.
You know like he's a cook.
He's a very famous chef.
Okay.
Yeah.

1799
01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:31.230
He's a very,
very accomplished chef and that's like what he does for a living.

1800
01:49:31.231 --> 01:49:35.150
But he's a hilarious fucking dude is fucking hilarious.
That show.

1801
01:49:35.370 --> 01:49:40.210
It's so funny.
And Empire.
I haven't seen it in pie.
It's really good too,
isn't it?

1802
01:49:40.380 --> 01:49:42.910
You just sit around watching TV shows,
watch a lot

1803
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:47.980
on your home.
Yeah.
When I'm home I try to catch up

1804
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:49.210
<v 2>this time when my husband,
you know,</v>

1805
01:49:49.211 --> 01:49:51.790
you have to do stuff that you know your partner likes.

1806
01:49:51.791 --> 01:49:56.080
So he liked to watch a lot of TV,
especially when his gout flare it up.

1807
01:49:56.081 --> 01:49:57.220
So what does he feel?

1808
01:49:57.221 --> 01:49:59.560
How does he feel about you or go on the road all the time now because he's like,

1809
01:49:59.561 --> 01:50:02.560
you guys been together for awhile and now all of a sudden you're the successful

1810
01:50:02.561 --> 01:50:06.880
touring comedian.
He,
um,
he's very,
he's in the beginning.
Joe.

1811
01:50:06.881 --> 01:50:11.130
He was not supportive.
He did not think I was funny.
Wow.
No,

1812
01:50:11.140 --> 01:50:14.320
he actually said no thank you.
Were funny because he said nobody.

1813
01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:18.550
I think it's the way he protect me because I was talking about my life,

1814
01:50:18.551 --> 01:50:22.060
you know all,
I got a baby by a married man and his get shot means like,

1815
01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:24.280
and a lot of time a lot of those stories come in and he's like,

1816
01:50:24.430 --> 01:50:27.580
what's the shoot your wife in the checks?
He was like,
I didn't fucking shoot her.

1817
01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:31.690
So he didn't,
he was like,
this stuff is too dark for him.

1818
01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:34.390
And he still don't laugh,
but he's supportive.

1819
01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:38.710
He tried it every now and then.
Give me something to talk about.

1820
01:50:38.711 --> 01:50:40.930
And he helps me out every now and then.

1821
01:50:40.990 --> 01:50:45.250
So when he hears you on podcasts and your tones,
colors doesn't listen.
Why not?

1822
01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:51.160
I don't know.
He don't come.
He only seen me live one time.
What?
One time.

1823
01:50:51.190 --> 01:50:54.270
Wow.
That seems crazy.
He came to Wa,

1824
01:50:54.910 --> 01:50:59.730
I used to open for cat Williams.
So who was in Kentucky and it was cat has old,

1825
01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:02.260
like 20 something thousand tickets.
And my cat was like,

1826
01:51:02.350 --> 01:51:04.120
your husband should come out and see you.
And I was like,

1827
01:51:04.121 --> 01:51:08.590
my husband never going to come see me.
He say,
call him up.
I,
I called my husband,

1828
01:51:08.591 --> 01:51:11.650
cat got on the phone was like,
I want you to come see your wife.
I pay,

1829
01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:14.530
I fly you and the kids.
And he's like,
well,
we live in Kentucky.
He said,
well,

1830
01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:18.190
jumping around a card and I pay for it.
And he was like,
you ain't got to do that.

1831
01:51:18.220 --> 01:51:23.140
I come.
So he came down there,
20,000 people and Kat,
um,

1832
01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:26.470
let me go out second and everybody was doing 15.
He said,

1833
01:51:26.471 --> 01:51:29.350
go do 25 for your husband and I fucking killed.

1834
01:51:29.530 --> 01:51:32.430
And my kids said the whole time my husband ducking his chill like that,

1835
01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:36.310
she'd be funny.
Oh,
she'd be funny.

1836
01:51:36.610 --> 01:51:41.160
And that changed his whole outlook on me.
Yeah,

1837
01:51:41.170 --> 01:51:42.650
I would imagine.
Yes.

1838
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:47.440
20,000 for the first time you ever see your wife on stage.
Wow.
Yeah.

1839
01:51:47.770 --> 01:51:51.120
Wow.
That's crazy.
First time he ever saw you onstage.

1840
01:51:51.250 --> 01:51:52.950
20,000 people in the camp.

1841
01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:58.210
So strange to him for so long.
Yeah.
Never came.

1842
01:51:58.270 --> 01:52:02.140
Never did you crush it?
I crushed it.
Yes I did.

1843
01:52:03.870 --> 01:52:07.180
But you did.
So he like,
like he'll watch stuff like,
you know,

1844
01:52:07.181 --> 01:52:08.970
I'm about to be on comedy central or affair.

1845
01:52:09.070 --> 01:52:13.000
So he probably would record it and watch it when I'm not home watching.

1846
01:52:13.001 --> 01:52:14.380
When you're not home,
he doesn't want to be,

1847
01:52:14.830 --> 01:52:16.510
he doesn't want you to be around when he's watching it.

1848
01:52:16.530 --> 01:52:19.780
I can't watch myself on TV.
Cause then you all,
you're fat,
you're swearing.

1849
01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:21.430
Oh look at my neck,

1850
01:52:21.460 --> 01:52:26.460
you know [inaudible] sweaty [inaudible] reason.

1851
01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:31.720
It was hiding that damn place where we shot at and my ma,

1852
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:35.900
I was sweating my ass off the Strip club.
Yeah,
no cheaters.

1853
01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:40.420
So I was fucking hot and I was just looking at the premium.
I was like,

1854
01:52:40.421 --> 01:52:43.630
Oh holy fuck,
I'm sweating.
That's hilarious.

1855
01:52:43.810 --> 01:52:46.010
So I will it,
what

1856
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:47.360
<v 3>is it like working with Katt Williams?</v>

1857
01:52:47.710 --> 01:52:52.390
<v 2>He was really nice.
You know,
I can't,
it was 2012 2012 I think.</v>

1858
01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:54.670
And the week I got the Gig we cat,

1859
01:52:54.910 --> 01:52:58.500
my father had passed that Monday and they call me,
they Wednesday,
Tammy,

1860
01:52:58.510 --> 01:53:00.820
I was going on tour.
So My,

1861
01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:04.420
my dad had counsel and for his insurance policies to kick in for,

1862
01:53:04.421 --> 01:53:08.170
he needed to be alive to August and he'd done in the older end 11 he needed to

1863
01:53:08.171 --> 01:53:12.490
be a lot to August,
2012 because he had that type of policy.
He had just moved,

1864
01:53:12.491 --> 01:53:13.830
you know,
with me.
So we had a type pause.

1865
01:53:13.831 --> 01:53:18.370
He had to be alive for so long and he didn't make it and we didn't have one

1866
01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:21.120
working money to bear.
And so my,
I was like,
well,
I'll just go on my save.

1867
01:53:21.121 --> 01:53:21.581
And I was like,
well,

1868
01:53:21.581 --> 01:53:25.510
let me see what I can do on top of getting all of my brothers and sisters up

1869
01:53:25.511 --> 01:53:28.540
here to come to the funeral because we didn't have enough money to ship him home

1870
01:53:28.990 --> 01:53:32.050
and can't wait me hurt me on the phone telling my brother,
I say,

1871
01:53:32.051 --> 01:53:34.690
well wait till I get paid from this Gig and I'm gonna get y'all up here,

1872
01:53:34.780 --> 01:53:38.230
but I still gotta pay $9,000 a day if you don't know the fuck it's coming from,

1873
01:53:38.231 --> 01:53:41.430
because they only gave me 40,000 now care overheard me say that.

1874
01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:46.270
Went to the fucking wall and brought me like five g's back to bear my daddy.

1875
01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:50.470
I had not hit the stage that night.
Not one time.
And he was like,

1876
01:53:50.650 --> 01:53:54.910
here's your money,
you know,
go bare your daddy and come back.
And I was like,

1877
01:53:54.911 --> 01:53:57.790
you don't have to do this.
He's like,
I was like,
I can pay you back.
And he's like,

1878
01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:01.720
no,
you don't owe me nothing.
Don't know me from Dick out of war.
Wow.

1879
01:54:01.810 --> 01:54:05.080
And he helped me bare my daddy.
That's why when people say something like,

1880
01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:07.540
I was like,
fuck you.
I mean I was,

1881
01:54:07.541 --> 01:54:11.110
I was opening for somebody on a regular and they didn't even offer besides

1882
01:54:11.170 --> 01:54:12.520
flowers from a daddy.

1883
01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:16.130
<v 3>I Dunno.
I Dunno.
It's Katt Williams.
But my take on Katt Williams,</v>

1884
01:54:16.150 --> 01:54:20.310
like when he does all this crazy shit is he's so fucking funny that you have to

1885
01:54:20.311 --> 01:54:22.590
be crazy to be that funny.
That's how I feel.

1886
01:54:23.730 --> 01:54:26.120
<v 2>And they're intelligent.
You don't know you,</v>

1887
01:54:26.150 --> 01:54:29.800
you see that character that he's done.
But if you talk to them smart as hell.

1888
01:54:30.010 --> 01:54:30.930
<v 3>I believe that I had,</v>

1889
01:54:30.940 --> 01:54:35.940
I had an interview that I listened to that changed the way I prepare for shows

1890
01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:39.950
and it was him.
He was talking about how he doesn't eat before shows.
And I,

1891
01:54:39.951 --> 01:54:41.170
I thought about it,
I was like,
you know what,

1892
01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:45.310
I've eaten before shows and not felt good.
Like I fell on,
weighed down by food.

1893
01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:48.880
My,
that's smart.
So I'm going to do that too.
So I give myself two hour window.

1894
01:54:49.150 --> 01:54:52.840
I will not eat with two hours before show the same window I give myself for like

1895
01:54:52.841 --> 01:54:57.550
working out.
It's smart,
smart thing that he said.
And um,

1896
01:54:57.720 --> 01:54:59.140
you know,
just talking about preparing,

1897
01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:02.640
he has music that he listens to special music right before

1898
01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:05.360
<v 2>he got holes in his hands and his shoulders.</v>

1899
01:55:08.050 --> 01:55:12.430
<v 3>But he's so funny,
like all this different shit that happens to him.
Like he said,</v>

1900
01:55:12.850 --> 01:55:14.860
he did his last special when he goes,

1901
01:55:14.890 --> 01:55:18.520
when you're standing next to shook night and you're the one getting arrested,

1902
01:55:22.050 --> 01:55:25.410
<v 2>that's when you know you fucked up.
Very funny.
You know,</v>

1903
01:55:25.411 --> 01:55:27.690
I don't like to hear people when they talk about,
you know,

1904
01:55:27.691 --> 01:55:30.450
people when they go through shit.
I was like,
cause you'd really don't know.

1905
01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:34.020
You really don't know the situation.
You just on the outside looking at me,

1906
01:55:34.021 --> 01:55:36.180
you fucking Internet thug.
I hate

1907
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:37.303
<v 3>she.</v>

1908
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:42.270
Well there's always going to be people that love to cast rocks to throw rocks at

1909
01:55:42.271 --> 01:55:44.100
people that are fucking,
you know what I'm

1910
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:47.460
<v 1>learning in this business,
what we were talking about before the podcast,</v>

1911
01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:49.860
before Brian showed up,
people that are fucking with you,

1912
01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:53.940
let's say in a bunch of mean shit to you.
Somebody.
Oh they,
like I said,

1913
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.720
come to the central release my internet virgin and somebody called me a black

1914
01:55:57.721 --> 01:56:00.320
can and I'm like user ignorant bitch.
Cop can't,

1915
01:56:00.330 --> 01:56:04.230
don't even ring bells in the hood.
You got to call me a bitch to get me riled up.

1916
01:56:04.250 --> 01:56:09.240
Can't it doesn't work in the hood.
No fucking cunt.
Nope.
Oh No.

1917
01:56:09.241 --> 01:56:14.070
Bitch might get you slapped but cut.
What the fuck gives a con?
I don't.
Fuck you.

1918
01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:18.840
Nothing,
Huh?
Yeah.
But you know I used to get on white checks.
Yes it does.

1919
01:56:18.841 --> 01:56:22.920
I heard a white boy called a white girl,
a con,
and this bitch broke out.

1920
01:56:23.380 --> 01:56:25.260
I was like,
what the fuck is a Chi?

1921
01:56:25.261 --> 01:56:28.650
What's wrong that all I had to go out with my friend.
Why is she crying?

1922
01:56:28.651 --> 01:56:32.670
He was like,
that's like calling you be a bitch or of the inward.
I was like,

1923
01:56:32.671 --> 01:56:33.750
holy fuck.
Keep crying.

1924
01:56:34.570 --> 01:56:37.010
<v 5>Aye.</v>

1925
01:56:38.210 --> 01:56:40.950
<v 1>Ah,
you want me to help you whoop his ass?
I don't know why,</v>

1926
01:56:40.951 --> 01:56:44.490
but kind of have so much of a power over white women,
but it just does.

1927
01:56:44.491 --> 01:56:46.380
It doesn't affect black woman bitch dude.

1928
01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:48.900
But you know it doesn't work on white women in England.

1929
01:56:49.530 --> 01:56:52.380
Everybody's caught over there in England and Ireland.
Everybody calls.

1930
01:56:52.381 --> 01:56:56.100
Everybody caught.
But he's a funny,
yeah,
he's a funny con isn't he?

1931
01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:00.420
And they'll ask you a question,
Ms Patches a funny contest and she,
Oh wow.

1932
01:57:00.450 --> 01:57:01.920
The only really say it about women though.

1933
01:57:01.921 --> 01:57:06.150
It's more like a man thing called men [inaudible].
Oh Wow.
It's like a,

1934
01:57:06.151 --> 01:57:10.230
almost a term of endearment.
Not over here for white women.
It has weird.

1935
01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:11.390
So we're not at work.

1936
01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:14.760
Why white women don't like cut and they don't like crow's feet.

1937
01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:18.060
And then the two things that pisses them off.
Crow's feet.
Yeah.

1938
01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:20.430
You mean like the lines near eyes?
Yeah,

1939
01:57:21.210 --> 01:57:24.000
in the makeup shop they are scared of Crow's feet.

1940
01:57:24.001 --> 01:57:25.720
Like a black man would appeal stone

1941
01:57:27.950 --> 01:57:32.790
assuming just filling them bitches and I'm like let it go girl is okay.

1942
01:57:33.450 --> 01:57:38.080
Let it go.
Well a lot of like blonde ladies especially,
they have that,

1943
01:57:38.130 --> 01:57:41.850
that weird skin that gets real brittle and thin.

1944
01:57:42.030 --> 01:57:44.190
Like thin skin does not age well.

1945
01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:48.540
Like one thing about black people and about dark skinned people,

1946
01:57:48.541 --> 01:57:52.140
Latinos especially they age better cause they have like a thicker,

1947
01:57:52.410 --> 01:57:56.580
like they have thicker skin,
you know Italian women,
they have thicker skin.

1948
01:57:56.790 --> 01:57:59.670
Like there's something about like white really white people.

1949
01:57:59.671 --> 01:58:01.170
They have that really thin skin.

1950
01:58:01.171 --> 01:58:04.890
I have a friend and he's my age and this motherfucker looks like he's 80 years

1951
01:58:04.891 --> 01:58:09.030
old and his kidneys and he's fucking blonde.
[inaudible] son,

1952
01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:14.240
a little bit of Sun but deep deep cracks like all over his face and his mouth.

1953
01:58:14.491 --> 01:58:19.020
I mean he looks really,
really old.
It's weird.
It's weird when you're around them,

1954
01:58:19.021 --> 01:58:22.320
you know?
It's like,
wow,
like he's only 47 years old and it looks like he's,

1955
01:58:22.530 --> 01:58:25.380
I dated this girl that had such thin skin that every time she would take a

1956
01:58:25.381 --> 01:58:29.190
shower you could see her whole entire circuit,
Tory system or certainly lawyers.

1957
01:58:29.250 --> 01:58:32.550
You know what I mean?
Like every single newborn white babies.

1958
01:58:32.551 --> 01:58:34.500
I used to be a medical system,
newborn white.

1959
01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:40.340
I didn't make this shit up.
That is true though.

1960
01:58:40.341 --> 01:58:42.130
Some white girls with really thin,

1961
01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:46.570
you could see their veins in their tits and it was something about the shower.

1962
01:58:46.571 --> 01:58:47.231
When she would get out,

1963
01:58:47.231 --> 01:58:50.970
you could actually see the blood just flowing around her body and it was,

1964
01:58:51.130 --> 01:58:55.630
I remember it was really concerned with boobs.
Yeah,
it really was.

1965
01:58:55.660 --> 01:58:58.180
It was a really concerned or a concentrated around them.
Boobs,

1966
01:58:58.181 --> 01:59:01.150
like a lot of veins going into the boobs and around the boobs.

1967
01:59:01.151 --> 01:59:05.670
For some reason it freaked me out,
but you still fuck.
I did made a tangent.

1968
01:59:06.420 --> 01:59:07.760
I used to be a medical assistant and

1969
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:14.430
they will bring the white babies and that goes to white doctor's office and the

1970
01:59:14.861 --> 01:59:15.760
little babies would be,

1971
01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:19.600
you could just get them naked and they looked like she'd just run it through him

1972
01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:21.580
like some cut on and I was like,

1973
01:59:21.581 --> 01:59:26.581
holy fuck you mean it was really good when you get rid of this stick him because

1974
01:59:26.861 --> 01:59:30.970
you knew not to hit the vein.
So you know you give him but it he's really creepy.

1975
01:59:31.170 --> 01:59:35.470
Yeah.
Vans are creepy.
I have zero veins,

1976
01:59:35.530 --> 01:59:38.440
so whenever I have to give blood they have to like stick it in there and grind

1977
01:59:38.441 --> 01:59:41.270
around and try to find it.
And you should take some a 10 minutes slot.

1978
01:59:41.380 --> 01:59:46.330
It's Sunday.
You have zero vans,
you just have high body fat content.
All they had

1979
01:59:47.930 --> 01:59:50.770
about 10 pounds,
you're fucking Veno swim back to the top.

1980
01:59:51.270 --> 01:59:55.450
It's not the girl who was,
she was skinny,
right?

1981
01:59:55.960 --> 01:59:57.630
She's right.
Yeah.
Yup.

1982
01:59:58.210 --> 02:00:01.960
Can't see through my seat through body.
Yeah.

1983
02:00:01.961 --> 02:00:03.550
There's something about that white skin that's,

1984
02:00:03.610 --> 02:00:06.790
well that's also this guy that I know that a is,
it looks old.

1985
02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:08.980
He's already gotten skin cancer too,

1986
02:00:11.930 --> 02:00:14.800
not tan.
He just goes outdoors and doesn't put sunscreen on.

1987
02:00:15.070 --> 02:00:17.920
But he had a big chunk removed off of his head.

1988
02:00:18.700 --> 02:00:21.850
Jeremiah or walking just had a big chunk roommate from his back.
Right.

1989
02:00:22.740 --> 02:00:27.320
Another white guy again,
uh,
this huge chunk taken out of his back because he had,

1990
02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:29.860
he had like,
he just didn't do anything about it.
He had like this,

1991
02:00:29.861 --> 02:00:31.120
like a skin cancer,

1992
02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:34.560
like mole thing that started getting this changing colors and stuff.

1993
02:00:34.580 --> 02:00:37.870
I know quite a few people that have had skin cancer removed from their body,

1994
02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:41.440
you know,
malignant,
not malignant,
benign,
you know,
whatever it is.

1995
02:00:41.441 --> 02:00:45.700
Different kinds of like look,
cancerous moles.
Super Common.
My mom,

1996
02:00:45.701 --> 02:00:49.420
every couple of months and I have so many moles that I should get this checked

1997
02:00:49.421 --> 02:00:51.910
out.
I probably have it somewhere.
Well,

1998
02:00:52.810 --> 02:00:55.660
go get it checked out because that should become systemic and you're fucked.

1999
02:00:55.990 --> 02:00:59.230
I'm glad I'm black.
Yeah.
Black people.
Very rarely.
Well,

2000
02:00:59.231 --> 02:01:03.990
Bob Marley died of skin cancer.
Got It on his foot.
Yeah.

2001
02:01:04.150 --> 02:01:07.540
Bob Marley gets skin cancer.
I believe it was between his toes.

2002
02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:13.520
Bob Marley,
the manager,
uh,
was one of a manager.

2003
02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:18.140
It's supposedly killed him.
What Hendrix you're thinking of Hendrix?

2004
02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:23.140
Yeah.
Yeah.
The cancer that's killed.
It's genetically different.

2005
02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:24.640
The,
uh,
this is interesting.

2006
02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:28.960
The skin cancer that killed Bob Marley is genetically different in,

2007
02:01:28.961 --> 02:01:30.540
is not caused by the sun.

2008
02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:37.520
They've sequenced the DNA of a rare type of melanoma that caused,

2009
02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:41.240
uh,
Bob Marley's death.
That's really interesting.

2010
02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:45.620
Bob Marley's data's king counts.
Yep.
It's called acral melanomas.

2011
02:01:45.621 --> 02:01:49.880
The rare type of skin cancer.
Yeah.
And you couldn't get the toe off to say to me,

2012
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:52.880
I don't,
I don't think he probably knew what was going on.

2013
02:01:53.780 --> 02:01:57.750
Diabetes and it's tall.
Yeah.
My Mama had,

2014
02:01:58.310 --> 02:02:03.310
my momma had a sore on her feet and on her foot for years and she tried to treat

2015
02:02:03.321 --> 02:02:07.220
it herself with fucking Vaseline and shit.
Yeah.

2016
02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:11.230
The diabetes thing,
it's like a circulatory thing.
It's like,
like,
uh,
uh,

2017
02:02:11.570 --> 02:02:16.280
it doesn't,
it,
she fell and she,
um,
she,

2018
02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:20.180
it was a little sore and she just wouldn't treat it and it just kept getting

2019
02:02:20.181 --> 02:02:22.430
bigger and bigger.
So when she finally went to the doctor,

2020
02:02:22.431 --> 02:02:26.530
they could have foot off.
They cut a leg off.
Ooh.

2021
02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:31.400
Yeah.
That happens.
A lot of people with diabetes.
My Mama and daddy had one lead.

2022
02:02:31.610 --> 02:02:35.300
God Damn Jesus Christ.

2023
02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:41.570
They probably didn't help him.
Bumping thump,
bump,
bump and nubs.

2024
02:02:41.571 --> 02:02:45.950
Now you know it's,
it's a weird thing that diabetes.
That's a scary one.

2025
02:02:46.060 --> 02:02:50.180
It doesn't sound like a disease until you fucking get sick from it.
Yeah,

2026
02:02:50.670 --> 02:02:54.260
I got diabetes.
It's almost like,
so I got crabs.
As long as I maintain them,

2027
02:02:54.261 --> 02:02:58.940
they won't kill me.
Oh,
that's what killed Patrice from diabetes.

2028
02:03:00.380 --> 02:03:03.470
Overweight people.
Very,
very similar.
Joe.

2029
02:03:04.070 --> 02:03:08.150
Setting that with nice chested ass talking about me and rent man didn't die.

2030
02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:15.150
Oh,
really?
Just means
does mean Joe.

2031
02:03:16.650 --> 02:03:18.500
Well,
that's why we're trying to get you a trainer.

2032
02:03:18.590 --> 02:03:22.190
I'm trying to make you not put too much coffee.
Sugar in your coffee.
Oh,

2033
02:03:22.191 --> 02:03:25.120
what am I supposed to do with it?
With what?
Your coffee?
Yes.

2034
02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:26.820
Just put the buttercream.

2035
02:03:26.940 --> 02:03:31.400
You're trying to get me the Stevia stuff was kind of stuff is pauses Divia.
Oh,

2036
02:03:31.410 --> 02:03:35.120
love it.
How are you?
Say that.
No,
that's fake.
It's plant extract.

2037
02:03:36.250 --> 02:03:39.830
Oh,
so it's not fake.
It's a plant extract.

2038
02:03:41.710 --> 02:03:43.330
Well,
you know everything.
You read

2039
02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:47.271
this,

2040
02:03:47.271 --> 02:03:50.240
people that are concerned about Stevia because they think that anything that's

2041
02:03:50.241 --> 02:03:55.241
artificial gives your body this glucose response and because it's not actually

2042
02:03:55.851 --> 02:03:59.540
sweet or it's not actually a sugar that your body gets confused,

2043
02:03:59.570 --> 02:04:02.000
but it's still better than diabetes,

2044
02:04:02.540 --> 02:04:06.800
whatever that fake my take is if you get cancer from Stevia,

2045
02:04:07.110 --> 02:04:09.900
something fucking wrong with you.
What?
Yeah,

2046
02:04:10.250 --> 02:04:12.930
that's what to just say something about Splenda.

2047
02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:16.720
SPLENDA is giving people counsel,
what do I do?

2048
02:04:16.721 --> 02:04:20.330
All those fucking crazy study one time they say,
oh,

2049
02:04:20.331 --> 02:04:23.120
we get a brace that we had a mammogram every year and that he's saying you can

2050
02:04:23.121 --> 02:04:26.090
go three years without worrying about your Ted is three years,

2051
02:04:26.540 --> 02:04:29.930
two or three years without getting a mammogram.
Now that doesn't seem right.
Yeah.

2052
02:04:29.931 --> 02:04:34.190
Some insurance on the pay like every two,
three years,
every year.
So there's,

2053
02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:36.860
the insurance company just doesn't want to pay for it.
Yeah,
of course.

2054
02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:38.250
[inaudible] sick,

2055
02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:41.190
<v 2>you know,
how do they know your design?
See,</v>

2056
02:04:42.030 --> 02:04:46.660
how do they know miss pat
somewhere looks on little white.

2057
02:04:46.670 --> 02:04:50.070
Do want to say some money.
Hey,
cut out the extra money for Teddy's.
Well,

2058
02:04:50.071 --> 02:04:52.470
what happened when you did get sick and you ain't got shit to suck?

2059
02:04:52.530 --> 02:04:56.610
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah.
So I take my titties in every year.
Good idea.

2060
02:04:57.060 --> 02:05:01.200
ASPARTAME is supposed to be really bad for you and that that shit was created

2061
02:05:01.230 --> 02:05:05.250
that was connected to what Donald Rumsfeld had something to do with that shit.

2062
02:05:05.251 --> 02:05:10.251
Get past aspartame is terrible that you've watched that today in a lot of

2063
02:05:10.921 --> 02:05:15.230
sweeteners,
a lot of diet sodas and shit.
I don't drink diet sodas has,

2064
02:05:15.231 --> 02:05:20.150
it's been drinking water.
I love chick fil late.
Eliminate

2065
02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:27.180
chick fillet is good.
The shit everywhere I go.

2066
02:05:27.390 --> 02:05:31.260
They Christian people that know how to make some good chicken.

2067
02:05:31.450 --> 02:05:35.400
And have you noticed they employees are never ugly.
A check flow.

2068
02:05:35.490 --> 02:05:36.960
They don't have other than employees,

2069
02:05:36.961 --> 02:05:39.600
they need him to Mcdonald's and churches and shit like that,

2070
02:05:39.630 --> 02:05:41.880
but never noticed her.
You sure?
Yes.

2071
02:05:41.881 --> 02:05:45.960
I'll never seen an ugly person that Chick-Filet.
They keep him in the back.

2072
02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:51.180
My son,
I love chick fil so much.
My 14 year old son got a job there.

2073
02:05:51.181 --> 02:05:54.390
So I can get a discount.
He worked one day.

2074
02:05:55.590 --> 02:06:00.060
I took him up there.
High Him.
That's hilarious.
He got a job.

2075
02:06:00.150 --> 02:06:03.040
How much of a discount is it really worth your son?
Hey,

2076
02:06:05.250 --> 02:06:09.300
when you go to three times a day,
well what the fuck you talking about?
This guy,

2077
02:06:10.200 --> 02:06:13.200
that grilled nuggets.
Oh,
they got nuggets.

2078
02:06:14.850 --> 02:06:17.820
So healthy does definitely healthy.

2079
02:06:18.630 --> 02:06:23.000
This is before I started exercising my son now.
Oh,
I see,
I see.
Yes.

2080
02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:27.870
Teach him how to work and be a little for the Discount Baltimore to let him know

2081
02:06:28.020 --> 02:06:29.700
that to get anything in this world,

2082
02:06:29.701 --> 02:06:33.450
you got to work forward including grilled nuggets.
Yes.

2083
02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:38.070
Mommy.
Just get mommy a discount.

2084
02:06:39.260 --> 02:06:41.850
Your first job is your mother favor.
Which restaurant?

2085
02:06:41.940 --> 02:06:45.920
Can you say that about yourself?
No.
Okay.
What that historical.
How do you,

2086
02:06:45.930 --> 02:06:49.230
how do your kids feel about you being on TV and being a famous comedian now?
Oh,

2087
02:06:49.231 --> 02:06:53.700
they love it.
And they live in our little white neighborhood.
They just love it.

2088
02:06:54.220 --> 02:06:57.570
Yeah.
That's got to make them proud.

2089
02:06:58.910 --> 02:07:02.160
You know,
I got two sets of keys and I,
and I say that I say this on stage,

2090
02:07:02.161 --> 02:07:05.300
I have a set of Medicaid keys and a set of blue cross blue sheer kids

2091
02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:12.240
and I have a great bit I'm working on about this but you know in my blue cross

2092
02:07:12.241 --> 02:07:14.640
blue shield kids live with me.
Like they,
my kids,

2093
02:07:15.870 --> 02:07:19.600
like my first kids grew up,
they got free lunch who was on welfare,

2094
02:07:19.620 --> 02:07:22.140
you know they was dad with my mood is struggling.
What Mommy and Daddy,

2095
02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:27.200
what you know now will,
we will off we okay.
We ain't well off.
We okay.
We ain't,

2096
02:07:27.230 --> 02:07:31.330
ain't no real struggles like it used to be with my first set of key.
So my,
my,

2097
02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:34.230
I call my blue cross blue shield kids.
Like they won't eat free lunch,

2098
02:07:34.770 --> 02:07:39.490
they won't eat free lunch and Essa.
They said as for poll people,
whoa.

2099
02:07:39.550 --> 02:07:43.040
Yeah,
they would not eat fucking free lunch.
And my daughter tell,

2100
02:07:43.041 --> 02:07:45.380

2101
02:07:45.381 --> 02:07:49.660
my motherfucking teenagers on loss of mine.
She told me last week and you know,

2102
02:07:50.140 --> 02:07:53.020
I don't really want to cuss with kids.
How could we live in the suburbs?

2103
02:07:54.130 --> 02:07:57.730
My daughter go time Mama.
Everybody come to school with a Starbucks cup.

2104
02:07:57.760 --> 02:08:01.460
I'm gonna need you to take me to Starbucks at six 40 so I can walk in school

2105
02:08:01.461 --> 02:08:04.750
with,
with a Starbucks cook.
I said,
motherfucker,

2106
02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:08.740
you don't go get you a cup now and put you some hot chocolate in that bitch when

2107
02:08:08.741 --> 02:08:10.960
you get on that bus.
It looked like you've been to Starbucks.

2108
02:08:11.140 --> 02:08:12.850
I ain't getting out of my goddamn bad to take,

2109
02:08:12.851 --> 02:08:15.070
you know Starbucks the fuck you think.
Damn,

2110
02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:17.710
I ain't that type of Mama to make you look cool.

2111
02:08:17.890 --> 02:08:22.570
So everybody in school wants to look cool by walking to school with Starbucks.

2112
02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:23.320
Cause yes,

2113
02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:28.320
all the white kids parents get up at they fucking bed in Midwest in the snow and

2114
02:08:29.291 --> 02:08:33.550
take day little white kids,
the Starbucks and Dunkin donuts so they can be cool.

2115
02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:37.140
Look what I got.
Who the fuck you,
you better get you a cup and reuse that bitch.

2116
02:08:37.141 --> 02:08:39.750
Act like you've been to Starbucks everyday.
I got plenty.

2117
02:08:39.751 --> 02:08:41.470
I hot chocolate in the kitchen.

2118
02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:44.310
Is it hot chocolate that these kids are getting or is it they get it.

2119
02:08:44.350 --> 02:08:46.990
They get the Mocha woke out.
They don't fast and shit.

2120
02:08:46.991 --> 02:08:48.550
You know the strawberry shit.

2121
02:08:48.940 --> 02:08:52.900
Super Sweet Mocha WOCA rapid frappaccino.
That's what my daughter,

2122
02:08:52.901 --> 02:08:55.240
I'm like you're Chino.
That's so much sugar.

2123
02:08:55.870 --> 02:09:00.160
She already fat shit.

2124
02:09:01.870 --> 02:09:03.640
Shit is so bad for you.
Yes.

2125
02:09:03.641 --> 02:09:06.460
And people drink that and they think the drinking coffee like you're drinking.

2126
02:09:08.050 --> 02:09:09.670
It's a shake.

2127
02:09:09.730 --> 02:09:13.990
If you go to my Starbucks in the morning or at two 30 after the schools and it's

2128
02:09:13.991 --> 02:09:18.580
just a line up the door.
Kids,
I'm telling you my daughter go up there to study.

2129
02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:22.070
What the fuck.
I ain't never studied it inside.
No restaurant.

2130
02:09:22.270 --> 02:09:25.210
People study at Starbucks.
Every time I go there it's filled with laptops.

2131
02:09:25.211 --> 02:09:29.410
It's ridiculous.
And you kids loud.
Well,
they set up,
people wear headphones,

2132
02:09:29.470 --> 02:09:31.390
they set it up where they have these nice tables,

2133
02:09:31.710 --> 02:09:35.820
coffee right there and it's free wifi daughter do study groups there and be
like,

2134
02:09:36.070 --> 02:09:38.740
pick me up from pick me up from our Starbucks.
I said,
look,

2135
02:09:38.770 --> 02:09:43.280
I'm not built like that.
Hunker up her from Starbucks.
I'm not a soccer mom,

2136
02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:44.810
not hauling.
You need other glass church.

2137
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:48.790
You gotta walk your ass down the street and I meet you.
Oh yeah,

2138
02:09:48.791 --> 02:09:50.620
she'll be willing to do extra shit.

2139
02:09:50.650 --> 02:09:53.890
I don't want to do extra shit with your friends.
Okay.
Wow.

2140
02:09:53.950 --> 02:09:56.380
I don't want to just get your shit.
What do you mean by extra shit?

2141
02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:00.460
Pick them up for study group.
No,
motherfuckers ain't studying day.

2142
02:10:00.490 --> 02:10:03.550
You don't want to pick them up for study group because it's extra shit.
Yeah,

2143
02:10:03.551 --> 02:10:06.970
because I'm in the house probably in my underwear watching TV.

2144
02:10:07.750 --> 02:10:11.020
So you don't want to get out of your underwear to take your daughter.

2145
02:10:12.100 --> 02:10:16.750
My daughter's about to be 17 this month.
I don't tell her to learn how to drive.

2146
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:17.290
She's like,

2147
02:10:17.290 --> 02:10:20.350
I don't want to learn how to drive because technically you responsible for me

2148
02:10:20.351 --> 02:10:23.710
till I'm 18 that's what we're taking care of.
You need those kind of arguments.

2149
02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:28.490
Yes.
Technically you're responsible.
That's the difference.

2150
02:10:28.491 --> 02:10:30.460
So I'm between the Blue Cross Blue Shield kids

2151
02:10:32.090 --> 02:10:35.590
a kit with a walk fucking home.
That's what I'm saying.
Exactly.

2152
02:10:35.800 --> 02:10:40.310
She you seeing the difference,
like the soft light for it?
Yeah.
A big difference.

2153
02:10:40.430 --> 02:10:42.440
Yes.
That's why you don't want to do that extra shit.

2154
02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:49.760
Tell you Joe,
my husband,
we fold.
My niece moved.

2155
02:10:49.761 --> 02:10:51.260
Then we will have to sit at the table.

2156
02:10:51.261 --> 02:10:55.130
My husband say you shouldn't allow the kids to vent personal.
I say fuck you.

2157
02:10:55.160 --> 02:10:56.690
If allowing them to vent.
Yes.

2158
02:10:56.750 --> 02:10:59.720
We get at the table and hear what they did at school today.

2159
02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:03.140
I dropped out of school.
I don't give a fuck what you did at school.
First of all,

2160
02:11:03.141 --> 02:11:05.760
I don't care what they did.
It's cool.
Really

2161
02:11:09.740 --> 02:11:11.930
not kindergarten,
they high schoolers.

2162
02:11:11.931 --> 02:11:15.980
I don't fucking know.
You don't want to talk to them.

2163
02:11:16.070 --> 02:11:20.550
I talk to everyday,
hey,
hey,
hey,
oh by,
I'm going in my room and get in the paper.

2164
02:11:20.660 --> 02:11:24.140
That's it.
You don't communicate.
You don't have to Joe my daughter go own it.

2165
02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:25.750
Own it.
Own about bullshit.

2166
02:11:26.850 --> 02:11:31.200
That's a good part of being a child.
No.
So,

2167

2168
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:37.490
I don't know them mother fuckers.
I personally don't care.

2169
02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:40.070
I got real shit like I need to hit pay.

2170
02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:44.030
Oh my fucking computer to pay the bills I don't want to hit is bull shit you

2171
02:11:44.031 --> 02:11:48.380

You know,
so so such as having six.
My daughter is still a virgin,

2172
02:11:48.410 --> 02:11:52.400
thank God.
But I'm like if you were stuck and have something to talk about,

2173
02:11:52.450 --> 02:11:57.050
oh my God.
To her,
you'll talk to her about some shit.

2174
02:11:57.080 --> 02:11:59.450
No,
I don't want to just start fucking are you saying

2175
02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:06.470

You know what?
That's so crazy.
My husband listened to that shit.

2176
02:12:06.590 --> 02:12:10.190
And your puppy such and such got arrested.
They on pills,
they getting high.

2177
02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:12.730
So I asked,
I said,
are you getting high no matter what I'm saying,

2178
02:12:12.830 --> 02:12:14.130
we'll shut the fuck up.
Well,

2179
02:12:14.131 --> 02:12:17.240
that's you talking to kids like that's part of raising kids.

2180
02:12:17.240 --> 02:12:19.150
You got to talk to them.
But

2181
02:12:22.250 --> 02:12:25.090
my husband,
he's very patient.
We have to set

2182
02:12:26.610 --> 02:12:31.270
your husband.
This is his first set of kids.
And your second set of keys?
Yes.

2183
02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:35.990
Wow.
So we get at a dinner table and my daughter want to just go own it.
Own it.

2184
02:12:36.350 --> 02:12:40.490
Do though.
The developing Newman dogs.
I was told,
shut the fuck up.

2185
02:12:41.330 --> 02:12:44.750
Shut the fuck up.
But you were also shut the fuck up.

2186
02:12:44.751 --> 02:12:48.470
But you know all the different cycles that you,
we talked about the broke.
I know,

2187
02:12:48.471 --> 02:12:51.950
but come on Joe.
Be Honest.
You really don't want to hit a bull shit,

2188
02:12:51.951 --> 02:12:55.810
but you do it because forsaking the parenthood.
No,

2189
02:12:57.110 --> 02:13:00.860
I don't respond.
I'm like,
you did key.
Shut the fuck up.

2190
02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:04.910
I don't want to hit his fucking high school shit.
Oh God.
God.

2191
02:13:04.930 --> 02:13:06.740
When you're talking to,
they're human beings.

2192
02:13:06.770 --> 02:13:08.420
That's what they're saying this to her.

2193
02:13:08.490 --> 02:13:10.940
But of course it's not a highschool shit to them.

2194
02:13:10.941 --> 02:13:13.730
It's their little lives and ain't no fucking life.
You get,

2195
02:13:13.731 --> 02:13:17.120
you get your mom and Dad,
your mom and dad pay for your food.

2196
02:13:17.121 --> 02:13:19.510
We pay for everything.
I mean you ain't,

2197
02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:23.780
all you're doing is living and making decent grades.
No,
they're alive.

2198
02:13:23.860 --> 02:13:27.770
They're experiencing life.
Yeah.
Okay.
What do you mean yell?

2199
02:13:28.910 --> 02:13:29.743
[inaudible]

2200
02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:33.750
wasn't raised like you're reacting to the way you were raised and you,

2201
02:13:33.751 --> 02:13:36.000
and you're expecting your kids to realize that you were,

2202
02:13:36.001 --> 02:13:40.440
you were raised in a harsh environment and your other kids lived a harsher life.

2203
02:13:40.441 --> 02:13:42.690
Then they're living and they should just shut the fuck up.

2204
02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:45.030
That's what you're saying.
I don't say that to them,

2205
02:13:45.060 --> 02:13:49.410
but that is what you're saying and it's ridiculous.
Shit.
High School Shit.

2206
02:13:49.411 --> 02:13:52.730
Just part of life.
No,
I'm just saying she ain't

2207
02:13:55.620 --> 02:13:56.453
shit.

2208
02:13:58.260 --> 02:14:00.840
I can't even relate to your offering getting high.

2209
02:14:01.170 --> 02:14:04.440
I don't know your fucking Furrion.
Well,
don't you?
I mean,
look,

2210
02:14:04.770 --> 02:14:07.530
if you're talking to her and she was five years old and she was telling you

2211
02:14:07.531 --> 02:14:10.480
these stories,
would you have the same reaction?
Right.

2212
02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:15.390
You'd be concerned at 16 you're like,
you're on your own.
I mean I listen,

2213
02:14:15.391 --> 02:14:16.580
but I don't want to eat.

2214
02:14:16.590 --> 02:14:20.600
I'm saying I don't want to hear the bullshit about who getting high,
who haven't.

2215
02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:23.640
Who this I should do is tell it all the people business.

2216
02:14:23.910 --> 02:14:26.550
But don't you want to talk to her about life?

2217
02:14:26.551 --> 02:14:30.030
Don't you want to like do talk code shirt?
So you do talk to her about the taste.

2218
02:14:30.340 --> 02:14:34.140
My second,
well,
my second set of kids,
my daughter is a test to her daddy.
Like,

2219
02:14:34.890 --> 02:14:38.760
I mean he's the world too,
so she don't really come to me.

2220
02:14:38.910 --> 02:14:42.030
We got that bond where we deal with each other,

2221
02:14:42.031 --> 02:14:45.360
but we really don't get along with the same people.

2222
02:14:45.370 --> 02:14:49.710
Like she's very fucking funny.
She very snappy.

2223
02:14:49.770 --> 02:14:54.180
She's very like,
okay.
I think my daughter thinks she's smarter than me.

2224
02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:56.040
Ain't gauge to her.

2225
02:14:56.041 --> 02:15:00.510
She is smarter than me because I didn't have no kids at 15 I didn't drop out of

2226
02:15:00.511 --> 02:15:03.870
school.
I didn't sell drugs.
You know,
she got a better life.
So in her head,

2227
02:15:03.871 --> 02:15:08.100
she's ways she no more shit than I do.
Let her tell it.
She smarter than me,

2228
02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:12.320
so I don't fuck with her.
You know,
I don't talk to her that much.
She chose,

2229
02:15:12.321 --> 02:15:15.600
she judges you by judges me past failures.

2230
02:15:17.300 --> 02:15:20.280
Here's your package.
She's talking about something like,

2231
02:15:20.281 --> 02:15:23.340
she was talking one day about history and if I don't know something,

2232
02:15:23.341 --> 02:15:25.230
I'm not ashamed.
I said,
I don't fucking know it.

2233
02:15:25.380 --> 02:15:28.140
That's what my Ms Troupe taught me.
You know?
If you don't know,

2234
02:15:28.141 --> 02:15:30.120
then tell the person you don't know.
The dumbest question is,

2235
02:15:30.121 --> 02:15:31.800
the question I asked is what I was taught.

2236
02:15:32.190 --> 02:15:34.080
So she was talking to someone about history and I was like,

2237
02:15:34.081 --> 02:15:37.650
what are you talking about?
She was like,
how dare you not know this?
I'm like,

2238
02:15:37.680 --> 02:15:39.960
ah bitch.
This is what I say to myself.

2239
02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:45.000
You know I got mad because I'm like,
if I knew it,
I wouldn't ask you.
She said,

2240
02:15:45.001 --> 02:15:47.820
how dare you not know.
How dare you not know it is.

2241
02:15:48.030 --> 02:15:51.210
What was it that you were sort of talking about history?
Somebody Hitler.

2242
02:15:55.520 --> 02:15:59.430
He is the first Jew friend that I really knew mean Jews.

2243
02:15:59.431 --> 02:16:02.910
The black people is just Jesus Christ.
We thought he was the only Jew in hallway.

2244
02:16:04.710 --> 02:16:08.100
So when you talked to her about Hitler and you don't understand what she was

2245
02:16:08.101 --> 02:16:10.770
talking to her father about history that day.

2246
02:16:10.980 --> 02:16:13.110
And then she said something and she was looked at me and say,

2247
02:16:13.111 --> 02:16:15.390
what you know about history?
And I said,

2248
02:16:15.420 --> 02:16:18.810
I know three motherfuck got killed in Chicago last night.
And she's like,

2249
02:16:18.990 --> 02:16:23.430
that's not history.
I said,
well I'm from,
and she didn't like it.

2250
02:16:23.940 --> 02:16:27.210
She got mad at her.
Well she kinda got mad.
So she thinks she's smarter.

2251
02:16:27.211 --> 02:16:31.840
So I asked her,
I said,
well she was,
I'm so much smarter than you.
I say,
Oh yeah,

2252
02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:36.770
yeah.
And I said,
no you're not.
You can't tear a cocaine into crack shit.

2253
02:16:36.780 --> 02:16:39.010
You told them that.
That's what you said to her.

2254
02:16:39.830 --> 02:16:43.510
Don't say that until the baby's 250 pounds,

2255
02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:49.770
250 pounds.
I say no baby.

2256
02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:57.580
Oh my God.
That's hilarious.
Should bring her next time I

2257
02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:03.210
come tell you Joe,
be no 15 year old is on this path.

2258
02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:06.430
Don't give a fuck if she's 20 there'll be no,

2259
02:17:06.431 --> 02:17:09.610
you wouldn't under 21 on this podcast ever.
No,

2260
02:17:09.611 --> 02:17:13.520
you will love her cause she know everything.
You know,
I do not want to hear,

2261
02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:19.330
you know what I tell you?
She's so fucking funny paint.
She'll be a comic.

2262
02:17:19.820 --> 02:17:24.010
I want her to beat.
They would say.
So she told me the other day,
like,

2263
02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:27.910
she actually,
she can write jokes like she'd give me if I'm working on some,

2264
02:17:27.911 --> 02:17:29.160
she's like,
what do you think about death?

2265
02:17:29.350 --> 02:17:31.120
So I'm in the car the other day and she said,
Mama,

2266
02:17:31.121 --> 02:17:32.200
you remember the time you want it.

2267
02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:35.190
I wanted you to go to the children's museum with me in Indianapolis.

2268
02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:37.360
And I was like,
yes,
I couldn't go because I had a geek.

2269
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:41.140
And she said at that museum,
it was crazy.
I said,

2270
02:17:41.141 --> 02:17:44.840
what each hallway represented,
uh,
um,
uh,

2271
02:17:45.250 --> 02:17:49.240
a time in history.
Like they started like at the 50 sixties.
So you know,

2272
02:17:49.241 --> 02:17:51.250
the whole segregation shit,
you know,
white people skiing,

2273
02:17:51.251 --> 02:17:52.390
black people down the street.

2274
02:17:52.660 --> 02:17:56.020
And then she say they had this little black man hanging and in the head she
said,

2275
02:17:56.021 --> 02:17:59.440
did you know the KKK had albums?
And I was like,
what do you mean?
They're like,

2276
02:17:59.441 --> 02:18:02.350
yeah,
they made music and like keep the,
keep the race,

2277
02:18:02.500 --> 02:18:04.690
keep black people and you know,
all this bullshit,
whatever.

2278
02:18:04.691 --> 02:18:08.020
She was telling me then she said she got to the 70 hall,
there was the Lsd,

2279
02:18:08.110 --> 02:18:12.990
she said she got to the 80.
It was,
it was,
it was a term of rap music and um,

2280
02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:15.070
crack epidemic and you know,

2281
02:18:15.071 --> 02:18:19.300
teenage pregnancy and then you say you got to the last hall when they get on the

2282
02:18:19.301 --> 02:18:22.840
way out the door with Obama and she said all her white friends was like,
oh,

2283
02:18:22.990 --> 02:18:24.760
this is the worst hallway.
She was like,
oh,

2284
02:18:24.761 --> 02:18:26.710
did you not see that black man back then?

2285
02:18:30.140 --> 02:18:34.270
That's the worst holy cause Obama Republicans,
where we live at

2286
02:18:36.810 --> 02:18:38.870
Obama is the president of the kids was like,

2287
02:18:38.950 --> 02:18:41.500
that's the worst hallway out of all of them.
And my daughter's like,

2288
02:18:41.530 --> 02:18:45.120
did you not see that black man back there hanging and listen to the news that

2289
02:18:45.130 --> 02:18:48.940
she is so fucking funny,
Joe?
And I said,
you sure?

2290
02:18:48.941 --> 02:18:50.190
He was at a church in Brazil.

2291
02:18:50.191 --> 02:18:52.820
She said when she saw the KKK hang in the blood pressure.

2292
02:18:52.821 --> 02:18:57.670
It's like what got a church museum is
wow,

2293
02:18:58.930 --> 02:19:01.420
she's just fucking funny.
And she said,

2294
02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:06.460
she said so some of her white fruits like I'm so sorry,
I'm so sorry.
She's like,

2295
02:19:06.461 --> 02:19:08.380
don't be sorry for me.
That's your history.

2296
02:19:11.610 --> 02:19:13.150
That's how funny she is.

2297
02:19:13.180 --> 02:19:16.720
There's a lot of white people in the Midwest and I'm mad at Obama,
Huh?
Yeah.

2298
02:19:16.721 --> 02:19:21.470
They didn't blame the country's woes on the president.
Yes.
I don't,
you know,

2299
02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:25.180
I think,
I think,
I think with the whole Obama thing,

2300
02:19:25.190 --> 02:19:29.210
I think some of them just racist.
They want to have a black leader for sure.

2301
02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:30.980
So then the percent,
yeah.
You know,

2302
02:19:30.981 --> 02:19:34.340
I don't like using the race card cause I say everybody ain't racist.

2303
02:19:34.550 --> 02:19:39.050
I say some people are just assholes.
That's true too.
I truly believe that.

2304
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:39.910
But there's a lot of

2305
02:19:39.910 --> 02:19:44.860
<v 3>people that actually are enjoying the fact that Obama is the president.</v>

2306
02:19:44.861 --> 02:19:48.640
So any,
any problem the world has,
they can blame on this black guy.

2307
02:19:48.720 --> 02:19:52.500
<v 2>Listen to it is,
I had,
I have a dentist,
I had a dentist in Indianapolis.
Right.</v>

2308
02:19:52.501 --> 02:19:55.890
So He,
Oh,
Miss Pat,
I'm so Christian and I believe in God.

2309
02:19:56.160 --> 02:19:58.050
Every time I was on probably as well dude,

2310
02:19:58.230 --> 02:20:03.030
white dude problems is only black patient maybe.
I know I was.

2311
02:20:03.300 --> 02:20:05.820
So I go in there cause he coached my son basket maker.

2312
02:20:05.970 --> 02:20:08.580
He coached my son's football team.
Joe.
I go in there,

2313
02:20:08.650 --> 02:20:12.270
oh you want to do a talk about Obama?
I hate him and I hate him.

2314
02:20:12.360 --> 02:20:13.440
So I'm saying to myself,

2315
02:20:13.470 --> 02:20:16.800
why am I'm going to keep letting you shoot me in my mouth and then you get

2316
02:20:16.840 --> 02:20:19.890
excited about Obama and get me to my pain meds and then kill me.

2317
02:20:20.160 --> 02:20:24.180
So I stopped going after because if you are a Christian you don't suppose to

2318
02:20:24.181 --> 02:20:25.050
hate.
Right.

2319
02:20:25.350 --> 02:20:29.070
But every time I come in that because I'm the only black patient you always want

2320
02:20:29.071 --> 02:20:32.280
to talk about Obama.
I said I don't give a fuck about what Obama doing.

2321
02:20:32.400 --> 02:20:34.500
I said he'd doing like everybody else fucking up.

2322
02:20:34.890 --> 02:20:39.050
They all spoke [inaudible] and you want to be technically they all fuckers any

2323
02:20:39.051 --> 02:20:42.000
and no matter which way you vote new,
never going to be happy.

2324
02:20:42.180 --> 02:20:45.450
No one has ever been a president where everybody thought they did a good job.

2325
02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:50.100
Thank you.
Bill Clinton got his dick.
So everybody had a problem with it.
Why?

2326
02:20:50.280 --> 02:20:52.980
Why?
You Know Hillary would through sucking Dick at the time.

2327
02:20:53.160 --> 02:20:55.980
Why are you going to knock a man for sucking Dick?
Getting his dick.

2328
02:20:55.981 --> 02:20:59.460
So if somebody come my miles and helped me,
so I'm going to agree.

2329
02:20:59.520 --> 02:21:02.890
You can help me Suck Dick.
Just don't fucking don't fuck him.

2330
02:21:05.260 --> 02:21:09.510
Suck his dick,
but don't fuck good girl.
What is the,
what is the rule there?

2331
02:21:09.540 --> 02:21:14.280
How's that work?
Please explain.
Just can't fuck.
Hey,
you can't fuck you.

2332
02:21:14.281 --> 02:21:16.770
You Know Dean,
you cross that line,
but as you do it,

2333
02:21:16.771 --> 02:21:19.650
you suck and it did you doing stuff I really get tired of doing.
I don't want,

2334
02:21:22.200 --> 02:21:24.810
that's why Hillary didn't get upset.
Okay Bitch,
you got to stick on.

2335
02:21:24.811 --> 02:21:25.644
Stuck up your ass,

2336
02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:29.460
<v 3>Casey.
You know how you can go and get a massage and no one gets upset?</v>

2337
02:21:29.470 --> 02:21:31.720
What'd you do after work today,
honey?
Oh,
I went and got a massage.

2338
02:21:31.870 --> 02:21:36.560
Nobody gets mad at you.
What if you like,
Hey,
can I get my dick sucked like,
yeah,

2339
02:21:36.640 --> 02:21:39.310
that would be beautiful.
What a beautiful world we live in.

2340
02:21:39.420 --> 02:21:41.690
<v 2>Yeah.
And that's what I tell him.
I say,
nobody's good.</v>

2341
02:21:41.790 --> 02:21:43.110
They're never going to please us.

2342
02:21:43.740 --> 02:21:45.540
<v 3>I watched a document,
not a documentary,</v>

2343
02:21:45.541 --> 02:21:49.140
but a speech to the day that Monica Lewinsky gave about about,
you know,

2344
02:21:49.141 --> 02:21:51.540
like being today about,
you know,

2345
02:21:51.541 --> 02:21:54.780
all the people that judged her and she's still talking about time,
but I'm like,

2346
02:21:54.781 --> 02:21:59.220
you're still talking about it today.
Like that's like,
like Jesus Christ.

2347
02:21:59.221 --> 02:22:02.970
Like I understand it was a big moment for the country because they put her in

2348
02:22:02.971 --> 02:22:05.700
her song.
She did.
Yeah.
Why don't be put on her socks.

2349
02:22:05.701 --> 02:22:07.530
She was talking about that in the speech,

2350
02:22:07.890 --> 02:22:11.130
but it was just something seemed like ridiculous that she's still talking about

2351
02:22:11.131 --> 02:22:13.590
it.
Do you think,
do you think being heard that she,

2352
02:22:13.591 --> 02:22:18.180
I got extra practice trying to be the best Dick sucker cause she knows in the

2353
02:22:18.181 --> 02:22:21.070
future,
every time she sucks at Dick,
that's going to be a thing.
You know,

2354
02:22:21.090 --> 02:22:26.070
like it has to be gagging and S.
I mean any the dates or if

2355
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:27.090
<v 2>she doesn't blow them,</v>

2356
02:22:27.091 --> 02:22:31.890
they're going to be so upset for fucking president.
You won't blow me.

2357
02:22:31.891 --> 02:22:34.800
Everybody knows you so different.
That's the type of Dick you suck.

2358
02:22:34.801 --> 02:22:36.420
Presidential Dick.
Yeah,

2359
02:22:36.421 --> 02:22:38.730
but then you know that the guy knows that he's like below.

2360
02:22:38.920 --> 02:22:41.820
She wasn't around her mouth.
She would have had so many perps.

2361
02:22:42.330 --> 02:22:43.570
<v 3>Huh?
If she didn't run her?</v>

2362
02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:47.970
<v 2>Yes.
I don't know what the fuck she tell for.
What did you tell for everybody?</v>

2363
02:22:47.971 --> 02:22:51.510
Be fucking a president.
Oh,
fucking in that White House.
Everybody cheat.

2364
02:22:51.520 --> 02:22:53.700
That's what they do when they go on and fucking meetings.

2365
02:22:53.930 --> 02:22:57.360
They all go out and buy,
puts a scene in the bathroom and do what they do.

2366
02:22:57.580 --> 02:22:59.520
They don't feed them.
Whatever the fuck they do.

2367
02:22:59.580 --> 02:23:01.830
That was that Larry Craig guy that was gay sex though.

2368
02:23:01.880 --> 02:23:05.570
It was trying and don't give a fuck.
They go out and get one day life from me.

2369
02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:08.070
Why you running your mouth?
Why did you run your mind?

2370
02:23:08.160 --> 02:23:11.610
Did we really have to know that Bill Clinton fucked you?
Monica Lewinsky?

2371
02:23:11.850 --> 02:23:13.670
I woulda never fucking told.

2372
02:23:14.190 --> 02:23:17.280
Do you know she probably still could have been getting a chick on the side to

2373
02:23:17.281 --> 02:23:18.114
this day,

2374
02:23:19.430 --> 02:23:19.980
<v 3>probably.</v>

2375
02:23:19.980 --> 02:23:23.520
<v 2>You don't tell on them type of people.
You tell if you fought right back.</v>

2376
02:23:23.620 --> 02:23:28.440
You know,
you tell us

2377
02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:33.680
what you don't tell on a president.
You keep that the secret.
She,

2378
02:23:33.770 --> 02:23:37.770
she was telling her friend and her friend recorded the conversation or friend

2379
02:23:37.771 --> 02:23:41.580
threw her under the bus.
Skinny girl with the long nose.
Older lady who is angry.

2380
02:23:41.670 --> 02:23:43.500
Yeah.
Cool.
One getting no dick.
Yeah.

2381
02:23:43.520 --> 02:23:46.560
See that's why I say if you are a single woman,

2382
02:23:46.740 --> 02:23:50.780
you don't have bitches that got that.
Don't have a man cause all the,

2383
02:23:50.820 --> 02:23:54.060
those are the ones that's always trying to tell you about your relationship.
Oh,

2384
02:23:54.061 --> 02:23:57.380
you shouldn't take this shit bitch.
You ain't got no man shit.
You're lonely.
Yes,

2385
02:23:57.390 --> 02:23:58.890
that is true.
Yes,

2386
02:23:58.940 --> 02:23:59.810
<v 3>that is true.</v>

2387
02:23:59.811 --> 02:24:04.340
It's always the girls that have no men and have terrible relationships.

2388
02:24:04.341 --> 02:24:07.940
When they do have men,
they want to give their girlfriends some sort of an oh,

2389
02:24:07.941 --> 02:24:09.460
Debbie says,
oh fucking yes.

2390
02:24:09.790 --> 02:24:12.190
<v 2>I have a friend like that.
Always want to tell me,</v>

2391
02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:16.900
oh you shouldn't take this or you bitch other healthcare for over 20 years.

2392
02:24:16.901 --> 02:24:21.730
You don't shut your Medicaid.
We're as hell.
You ain't got no man.

2393
02:24:22.030 --> 02:24:22.421
I don't.

2394
02:24:22.421 --> 02:24:25.360
I tell people I don't fuck with single people because they'll have you thinking

2395
02:24:25.380 --> 02:24:28.000
their way and then you be up here.
A lonely old mulvack.

2396
02:24:28.600 --> 02:24:32.020
<v 3>Well,
there's definitely some people that want people to break up because they're</v>

2397
02:24:32.021 --> 02:24:33.940
single.
That's that as a fact.

2398
02:24:34.070 --> 02:24:37.470
<v 2>Yeah,
definitely.
They won't what you got,
there's that too.
Yeah.</v>

2399
02:24:37.700 --> 02:24:40.460
As soon as you leave and then you look up and she blowing him.
Well,

2400
02:24:40.461 --> 02:24:43.970
you told me not to set up that you told me not to give him hey.
No,

2401
02:24:43.971 --> 02:24:46.310
because this bitch was waiting in line to give him head.

2402
02:24:46.600 --> 02:24:49.880
I can't believe you're saying this what,
but you're right.

2403
02:24:53.870 --> 02:24:56.090
You don't tell nobody how good your man put it down.

2404
02:24:56.091 --> 02:24:58.730
You tell your girlfriend and her wheels get this.

2405
02:24:59.880 --> 02:25:04.620
<v 3>I might need to go try that.
Really?
Yeah.
How common is that?</v>

2406
02:25:05.490 --> 02:25:09.420
Very common among,
amongst women.
Do you think women covet their friends?

2407
02:25:09.540 --> 02:25:13.500
I didn't want it.
Well,
Huh?
You think women covet their friends?

2408
02:25:13.501 --> 02:25:16.280
Men like you know,
like a girls hanging around with you.

2409
02:25:16.281 --> 02:25:19.400
You're talking about your husband's.
I should get this one.

2410
02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:25.510
Each posting.
Yes.
Dealer from Ms Pat and you can steal shit from me.

2411
02:25:27.230 --> 02:25:30.910
I ain't doing shit with me,

Yeah.

2412
02:25:30.950 --> 02:25:32.320

2422
02:26:10.691 --> 02:26:15.100
We need to fucking get that other miss pat.
I'm tired of spelling comedian wrong.

2423
02:26:15.120 --> 02:26:18.280
Okay.
I don't believe in that word,
by the way.
I don't believe in it.

2424
02:26:18.550 --> 02:26:22.960
It's like comedian.
No,
you're a fucking comic.
Your Goddamn standup comic.
Right.

2425
02:26:22.990 --> 02:26:25.960
Okay.
Okay.
You don't need to be a female comedian.

2426
02:26:25.961 --> 02:26:30.290
Like what is that to say that it's categorized as you.
Yeah.
You know,

2427
02:26:30.450 --> 02:26:34.630
and I'll do no females top is really,
you're a fucking comic.
I'm a comic.

2428

Right.
This we need to just miss pat m.

2429
02:26:39.101 --> 02:26:43.720
T there's some person that has it and his fucking like one tweet.
It's bullshit.

2430
02:26:44.050 --> 02:26:46.660
They have no followers.
They're there.
Their tweets are blocked to,

2431
02:26:47.020 --> 02:26:49.630
can't even read their tweets.
Probably because people are bombing on them.

2432
02:26:49.650 --> 02:26:52.460
Give this pattern fucking name.
That's probably what's happening.

2433
02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:57.030
We're looking today and I didn't lose do that.
I will,
