00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.750
<v Speaker 1>We're not like in a,</v>

3
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like in a position where I'm going to have an actual battle with someone</v>

4
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.573
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

5
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

6
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.780
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>

7
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.141
<v Speaker 1>but but,</v>

8
00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:13.420
<v Speaker 1>but for competition,</v>

9
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:14.650
<v Speaker 1>no self defense.</v>

10
00:00:14.651 --> 00:00:15.430
<v Speaker 1>Self defense.</v>

11
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean like I like,</v>

12
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>see then you can't say that because that could happen on the way to the grocery</v>

13
00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:22.150
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>

14
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.691
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

15
00:00:22.691 --> 00:00:26.620
<v Speaker 1>You can run into some crazy messed up chick wants a fucking do get out.</v>

16
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:27.663
<v Speaker 1>Literally</v>

17
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.110
<v Speaker 1>like we're doing this.</v>

18
00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:37.111
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had the fucking manpower literally to like we were in Nashville like</v>

19
00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:39.850
<v Speaker 1>two weeks ago for Americana Fest.</v>

20
00:00:39.851 --> 00:00:42.970
<v Speaker 1>We're playing this festival and we were driving under this bridge and there were</v>

21
00:00:42.971 --> 00:00:46.990
<v Speaker 1>these two guys beating the fuck out of each other in the middle of the street.</v>

22
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.760
<v Speaker 1>It was like a bottle over the face.</v>

23
00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:51.220
<v Speaker 1>This one guy was choking the other guy and anchor.</v>

24
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.063
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

25
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.601
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>

26
00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:53.500
<v Speaker 1>It was sloppy.</v>

27
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.550
<v Speaker 1>It was sloppy.</v>

28
00:00:54.551 --> 00:00:55.280
<v Speaker 1>It was sloppy.</v>

29
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Crackhead,</v>

30
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.913
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

31
00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Main puzzles.</v>

32
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.413
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

33
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.840
<v Speaker 1>obviously we called the police,</v>

34
00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:03.490
<v Speaker 1>but like I had this moment where I was like,</v>

35
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to do something.</v>

36
00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:04.931
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

37
00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:06.160
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck can I do?</v>

38
00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:08.390
<v Speaker 1>And I was literally the leaned out the window and I went stop.</v>

39
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.470
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what to do.</v>

40
00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:12.310
<v Speaker 1>And I called the police.</v>

41
00:01:12.311 --> 00:01:14.150
<v Speaker 1>But like if I were a new job,</v>

42
00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:14.984
<v Speaker 1>like you</v>

43
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.890
<v Speaker 1>definitely stayed in my car,</v>

44
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

45
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.413
<v Speaker 1>100%</v>

46
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.530
<v Speaker 1>if you're driving by two people beating the fuck out of each other,</v>

47
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.420
<v Speaker 1>you are not there.</v>

48
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.683
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

49
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.840
<v Speaker 1>You were in a car just because it's right in front of you.</v>

50
00:01:34.841 --> 00:01:38.650
<v Speaker 1>That shit could be a hundred miles away in less and less.</v>

51
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.280
<v Speaker 1>There's someone in that mixture that needs you.</v>

52
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Like if there's someone who's small and they get beaten up by someone big,</v>

53
00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:47.080
<v Speaker 1>then everything changes.</v>

54
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.630
<v Speaker 1>But if it's too fucking dude chill from the other day,</v>

55
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>they're fighting in the street fucking so my point is don't always stop.</v>

56
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Just kiss already.</v>

57
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Don't always stop.</v>

58
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you get to elect two dudes beat each of the day.</v>

59
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.550
<v Speaker 1>It's better for everybody.</v>

60
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Certain people,</v>

61
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.573
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>

62
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Just give him both rocks and push them near the edge.</v>

63
00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:12.814
<v Speaker 1>Go</v>

64
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.160
<v Speaker 1>let them fall and keep coal mining.</v>

65
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.420
<v Speaker 1>You got to keep moving.</v>

66
00:02:19.421 --> 00:02:19.841
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

67
00:02:19.841 --> 00:02:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Genes need to flourish.</v>

68
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.730
<v Speaker 1>They need to find better streams of diversity.</v>

69
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying,</v>

70
00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:28.554
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

71
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.130
<v Speaker 1>don't always stop fights.</v>

72
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.400
<v Speaker 1>And what I've realized is when they,</v>

73
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.620
<v Speaker 1>when they've recognize you as a threat,</v>

74
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.660
<v Speaker 1>when they identify you as somebody who could do them damage,</v>

75
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.960
<v Speaker 1>they start going on maneuvers trying to find out everything about it.</v>

76
00:02:38.961 --> 00:02:41.610
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to find out what the worst stuff they have on you is so that he</v>

77
00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>can dismiss you as a bigot or a sexist or a Neo Nazi or whatever.</v>

78
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 1>They can come up with anything they can grasp out because their strategy is to</v>

79
00:02:48.691 --> 00:02:49.250
<v Speaker 1>dismiss the,</v>

80
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.190
<v Speaker 1>is to dismiss the speaker by attacking the speakers credibility.</v>

81
00:02:53.191 --> 00:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Because that way they never have to even consider the merits of the argument.</v>

82
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

83
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.020
<v Speaker 1>They haven't been able to do that with me.</v>

84
00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

85
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.180
<v Speaker 1>which is why feminists now refuse to bait me,</v>

86
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 1>debate me on TV because they know they'll lose.</v>

87
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.561
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

88
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:03.041
<v Speaker 1>they calm,</v>

89
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>bring out,</v>

90
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>well they can't bring out,</v>

91
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 1>they've got this battery of dismissing of a dismissal tactics that they've</v>

92
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>amassed over the last 30 years and they've got so complacent because they've</v>

93
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:12.881
<v Speaker 1>never had,</v>

94
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:13.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:14.240
<v Speaker 1>a Sassy gay person.</v>

96
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.921
<v Speaker 1>And come up and say it,</v>

97
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>you're talking bullshit and you're hurting men and here are the facts.</v>

98
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.881
<v Speaker 1>They've never had it before.</v>

99
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:20.530
<v Speaker 1>So they've never built up an arsenal to fight it.</v>

100
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

101
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 1>so this is,</v>

103
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 1>this is why I went and while Cook I'll keep winning because they don't really</v>

104
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>know how to deal with an argument on its own merits.</v>

105
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:29.951
<v Speaker 1>And in any case,</v>

106
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 1>of course the facts are on our side.</v>

107
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

108
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>it's also this conversation that we're having right now is about war.</v>

109
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>You're saying winning and losing and they're taking tactics and strategies to</v>

110
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 1>look up dirt on the opposition.</v>

111
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.490
<v Speaker 1>They're going,</v>

112
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.181
<v Speaker 1>they're treating.</v>

113
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:43.781
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

114
00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:44.050
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

115
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 1>this is an ideological war is not a debate about the facts of the issue.</v>

116
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.160
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's part of it because the left has always seen this as a war.</v>

117
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.510
<v Speaker 1>And the gender warriors,</v>

118
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

119
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 1>have always been warriors.</v>

120
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker 1>They've always seen this in strategic terms.</v>

121
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>

122
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 1>People on Conservatives and naturally more self effacing conservatives tend to</v>

123
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:01.481
<v Speaker 1>be a little bit cool,</v>

124
00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:03.840
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more chill about things they kind of don't really want to get of.</v>

125
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:05.603
<v Speaker 1>How do you explain?</v>

126
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.770
<v Speaker 1>I think they get very angry about things.</v>

127
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 1>Ted Cruz,</v>

128
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:09.461
<v Speaker 1>what am I saying?</v>

129
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:10.211
<v Speaker 1>Old Conservatives,</v>

130
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>but he explained,</v>

131
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.040
<v Speaker 1>what's her name?</v>

132
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Pailin chick.</v>

133
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Pailin.</v>

134
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.231
<v Speaker 1>How to explain that.</v>

135
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:14.590
<v Speaker 1>These are the,</v>

136
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 1>these are the outline is that even most conservatives find these people a bit</v>

137
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:19.020
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

138
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.480
<v Speaker 1>How could be,</v>

139
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.510
<v Speaker 1>I think that guy's in his,</v>

140
00:04:20.511 --> 00:04:21.344
<v Speaker 1>in the end.</v>

141
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Who knows how these much fatter now he was hopping when last time.</v>

142
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.751
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

143
00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:26.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 1>for like a lazy Christian TV gigs,</v>

145
00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 1>so fat he got so far,</v>

146
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:31.541
<v Speaker 1>I cannot vote for anyone.</v>

147
00:04:31.541 --> 00:04:32.830
<v Speaker 1>That phenomena of rock and rolling.</v>

148
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.330
<v Speaker 1>I Want Marco Rubio just because he's hot.</v>

149
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:35.771
<v Speaker 1>If we call out Trump,</v>

150
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 1>then I won't regret it.</v>

151
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

152
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.550
<v Speaker 1>I think people are silly.</v>

153
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.090
<v Speaker 1>So whether or not it's a conservative thing or a liberal thing,</v>

154
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a vast majority of people that aren't not very good at looking</v>

155
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:47.944
<v Speaker 1>at themselves.</v>

156
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.950
<v Speaker 1>And they're not very good at looking at the momentum of their actions.</v>

157
00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:53.390
<v Speaker 1>They just think that they're right because this is what they've,</v>

158
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.180
<v Speaker 1>they've been saying for so long.</v>

159
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.600
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's one of the most horrific things about these conversations</v>

160
00:04:58.601 --> 00:04:59.231
<v Speaker 1>with these women.</v>

161
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Speaker 1>Get in with you about,</v>

162
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.760
<v Speaker 1>cause like when,</v>

163
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 1>when they're talking about what they think are social constructs,</v>

164
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:08.200
<v Speaker 1>things like gender identities and the way people be.</v>

165
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.830
<v Speaker 1>And when you shatter that with the facts,</v>

166
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.530
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for some other weapons and there's nothing there or you see it</v>

167
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.021
<v Speaker 1>in their eyes.</v>

168
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:17.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

169
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>cause it's not really a debate about the idea itself.</v>

170
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 1>It's just not what,</v>

171
00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:21.731
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

172
00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:22.990
<v Speaker 1>What it's about is gender warfare.</v>

173
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.720
<v Speaker 1>That's why people like Christina Hoff summers called them gender warriors</v>

174
00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:28.900
<v Speaker 1>because these aren't people who want any kind of social justice as they say.</v>

175
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.670
<v Speaker 1>These are people who just hate men,</v>

176
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:31.900
<v Speaker 1>will just hate men.</v>

177
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:32.940
<v Speaker 1>They want to hurt men.</v>

178
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

179
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.690
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to quality for women.</v>

180
00:05:34.691 --> 00:05:35.270
<v Speaker 1>They want to,</v>

181
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 1>they want superiority for women.</v>

182
00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's architected into the education system or you know,</v>

183
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.920
<v Speaker 1>affirmative action or whatever it is.</v>

184
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.000
<v Speaker 1>They don't want quality.</v>

185
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:43.930
<v Speaker 1>They want superiority.</v>

186
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.800
<v Speaker 1>And fundamentally,</v>

187
00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:45.280
<v Speaker 1>a lot of this,</v>

188
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

189
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:45.820
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

190
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.140
<v Speaker 1>these crazy extremist,</v>

191
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

192
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:48.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

193
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.630
<v Speaker 1>progressive third wave feminists,</v>

194
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:50.950
<v Speaker 1>today's version of feminism.</v>

195
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.250
<v Speaker 1>It basically boils down to [inaudible] and it takes a gay guy because it's so</v>

196
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:56.530
<v Speaker 1>dangerous for men to even broach this subject anymore.</v>

197
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.200
<v Speaker 1>And any man,</v>

198
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>a mainstream job puts that at risk by even talking on the subject no matter what</v>

199
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:01.214
<v Speaker 1>his opinion is.</v>

200
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

201
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 1>it takes a gay guy to go on,</v>

202
00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:03.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Sky News in the UK and say,</v>

204
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:04.731
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

205
00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.010
<v Speaker 1>the facts are not on your side and what you're doing is damaging to women.</v>

206
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

207
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.870
<v Speaker 1>it's to me really an indictment on a,</v>

208
00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 1>on debate in our public square that it is so dangerous for a man to even express</v>

209
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:17.120
<v Speaker 1>an opinion on this subject that it takes a fact they're going to stick up for,</v>

210
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.200
<v Speaker 1>for heterosexuals.</v>

211
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.850
<v Speaker 1>If other men could say this,</v>

212
00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:24.421
<v Speaker 1>they would be,</v>

213
00:06:24.421 --> 00:06:26.670
<v Speaker 1>but they can't because they would run the risk of their careers.</v>

214
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Feminists always talking about silencing the people.</v>

215
00:06:29.011 --> 00:06:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Icy silence to men,</v>

216
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.690
<v Speaker 1>but we don't,</v>

217
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.140
<v Speaker 1>there's no like established number that everybody knows like,</v>

218
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.351
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

219
00:06:34.351 --> 00:06:35.370
<v Speaker 1>if you eat this,</v>

220
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.710
<v Speaker 1>you how many milligrams are you had 10 oh,</v>

221
00:06:37.711 --> 00:06:38.544
<v Speaker 1>you're fine.</v>

222
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.830
<v Speaker 1>There's because of the fact that it's illegal.</v>

223
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.600
<v Speaker 1>There's all this guessing and you gotta.</v>

224
00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:44.550
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time to figure it out.</v>

225
00:06:44.551 --> 00:06:47.190
<v Speaker 1>You've got to talk to a bunch of different people and get answers.</v>

226
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Don't talk to Joey Diaz throwing off the curve or don't worry about a cop</v>

227
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:52.531
<v Speaker 1>soccer.</v>

228
00:06:52.531 --> 00:06:54.510
<v Speaker 1>Even though the one you're going to walk on ice,</v>

229
00:06:54.511 --> 00:06:55.620
<v Speaker 1>you might as well dance.</v>

230
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.380
<v Speaker 1>I saw him the other day on periscope just eating.</v>

231
00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:58.831
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

232
00:06:58.831 --> 00:06:59.131

246
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.600
<v Speaker 1>He's not even experiencing reality as we know it because reality is just very</v>

247
00:07:17.911 --> 00:07:18.660
<v Speaker 1>different right now.</v>
