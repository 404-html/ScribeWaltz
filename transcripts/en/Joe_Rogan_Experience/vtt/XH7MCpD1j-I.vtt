1
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:05.930
Okay.

2
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.850
<v 1>Which will good experience.</v>

3
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.740
<v 0>Hello everybody</v>

4
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.560
<v 1>and Reagan's here.
Ladies and gentlemen,
longtime friends slash standup comedian.</v>

5
00:00:20.561 --> 00:00:25.330
Extraordinary slash a international man of mystery.
That's how I look at you.
Wow.

6
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.360
I like that intro and I'm working with people.

7
00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.430
I'm going to start asking them to go with that intro.

8
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.150
Plus you have the only comic I know that works outside of Vegas,

9
00:00:34.151 --> 00:00:37.720
but lives in Vegas.
Yes.
For everybody else's.
The opposite.
Right?

10
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.620
Or they live in Vegas only because they want to work in Vegas.

11
00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:45.430
Like a carrot top type individual.
Yes I do.

12
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.340
I do life and show business backwards.

13
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.520
I want a long commute.

14
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.210
I want to go to an airport and get on a plane and fly more than a thousand miles

15
00:00:58.451 --> 00:01:02.980
away from my home and do my work.
But you work everywhere though.
I mean,

16
00:01:02.981 --> 00:01:07.710
you worked in Va.
Do you work in Reno?
Yeah,
I'll do reno.
He'll do reno.
Just what?

17
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.840
You won't do Vegas.
I mean I might at one point.
You know what I mean?

18
00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:14.800
Like those residencies seemed kind of uh,
intriguing.
You know,

19
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.190
carrot top Rita Rudner I think she's doing another one.

20
00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:22.120
I'm not sure the people that,
but not yet.
You know what I mean?

21
00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:25.540
I still like being on the road.
I,
I to me for now,

22
00:01:25.541 --> 00:01:28.890
that's what I want to be as a comedian,
as a traveling comedian.
He had,

23
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:33.130
the residencies are very strange because they're intriguing in some way.

24
00:01:33.131 --> 00:01:35.080
I had a conversation with George Wallace about it.

25
00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:38.560
I ran into him at the comedy and Magic Club and he's done with his,

26
00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:42.010
he used to do one.
And uh,
the way he described it,

27
00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:46.060
it sounded like a lot of fucking work,
like a lot more work than you would think.

28
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.540
Like you would think,
well,
hey,
for him it's great.
He just has to stay there.

29
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.410
And he just kinda like,
does it show?
There is no big deal now they,
you know,

30
00:01:53.411 --> 00:01:55.840
they call it four walling it,
I guess,
you know,

31
00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:58.720
so like you have to fill that place,
fill it all the time.

32
00:01:58.721 --> 00:02:01.870
So you're always doing promotions,
you're always doing this and that.

33
00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:05.140
And you know,
like I don't know how much of that he asked to pay for,

34
00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:07.270
but I believe a lot of it comes out of his pocket.

35
00:02:07.271 --> 00:02:10.750
And so he's constantly trying to fill the place up and constantly trying to,

36
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.380
you know,

37
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.030
put billboards up and keep the place pop in and he has to do things in order to

38
00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:18.550
get people to remember him cause he's not out there.

39
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.720
Like when you're on tour you're out there,
you know,
urine,
Cincinnati,

40
00:02:22.721 --> 00:02:26.440
you know Brian Regan's in Boston,
Brian Regan's in Maryland.

41
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.920
You know when you're in Vegas you're just in Vegas.
Right.

42
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.310
So there's a lot more clutter,
you know when,
when you're in La,

43
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.390
cause there's a lot of comedians doing that and a lot of other shows in Las

44
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.390
Vegas.
I didn't realize it was that much work.
So I'm changing my mind.

45
00:02:40.391 --> 00:02:43.540
I never want to do a residency.
Yeah,
I'm out.

46
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.590
I've thought about like a partial,
not a never a residency.

47
00:02:47.591 --> 00:02:51.100
I don't really want to live there but a partial sort of a situation where you do

48
00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:52.540
like a once a month show there.

49
00:02:52.541 --> 00:02:55.630
I think like once a month show there would be kind of fun.
Yeah.
Yeah.

50
00:02:55.631 --> 00:02:58.810
I've been doing the Mirage pretty recent pre regularly,

51
00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:01.110
like did it twice in January.
Um,

52
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.340
but that's just cause I'm there anyway for the UFC.
Right.
You know,

53
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.160
well George Wallace has a,
has a big billboard up,

54
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.750
says a best 10:00 PM show in Las Vegas.

55
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.370
And I love the,
the qualification on there.
I did a residency,

56
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:21.850
I would put a billboard right next to that best 10 oh five show

57
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.790
or a 10:03 AM 10 oh three show in Las Vegas.
Yeah,

58
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:31.030
that's a weird qualification.
Right.
Best 10:00 PM show,

59
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.740
some silly magazine.
It's always like Vegas best magazine.

60
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:37.630
Like where do I find this fucking Vegas Pass magazine,

61
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.730
the Las Vegas Review Journal.

62
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:44.680
Every year co polls everybody in Las Vegas to ask them what they think the best.

63
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:47.320
Everything is in Las Vegas,
the best Italian restaurant,

64
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:50.210
the best Mexican restaurant.
And um,

65
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.680
Las Vegas is kind of like a hodgepodge of people,
like from all over.

66
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:56.950
And they didn't,
it's not the most cultured place.

67
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.560
So like the best Mexican restaurant or as has always like,
uh,

68
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.490
I'm trying to think of a,
I mean it's not Taco Bell,
but it's like a a bit shaky.

69
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.690
Yeah.
You know,

70
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:11.650
it's like a chain and the best Italian restaurant is like a something you go,

71
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:13.060
Nah,
that's not the best Italian restaurant.

72
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.230
So the Las Vegas Review Journal always has to say,
well these are great choices,

73
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:18.910
but here's some suggestions we make.

74
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:22.990
Like they're trying to push the culture a little bit.
Oh,
that's good.
Yeah.
They,

75
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.730
they have some pretty decent restaurants in Vegas.

76
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:27.910
That's one thing that Vegas has by far,

77
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.940
like that's the most impressive is the restaurants they have in the casinos.

78
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.790
Like if you get a steak in Vegas at a big casino,

79
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.400
it's going to be a bank and steak.
I've never had a bad steak.

80
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.870
Had like a craft steak or a strip steak,
you know,

81
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.120
the places and MGM and Mandalay Bay or nine at the palms.
Like,
you know,

82
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.220
some of the best takes in the world.
Yeah.
I haven't done a lot of those deals.

83
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:50.260
I mean,
I'm pretty much like a home guy.
I mean,

84
00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:54.550
I'll go hit those places every now and then if I've got friends in town.
But,
uh,

85
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.060
I'm not a guy that really knows Las Vegas inside and out,
you know,

86
00:04:58.061 --> 00:05:01.170
it's embarrassing when friends come into town and go,
where are we going,
Brian?

87
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.070
And I'm like,
[inaudible] street,

88
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.400
they got a,
they got a happy hour there and uh,

89
00:05:09.401 --> 00:05:13.210
then we'll go get a draft somewhere.
You know it.
Yeah.
I'm not that guy at all.

90
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.430
Yeah.
When we were at the UFC this,
uh,
last month,
uh,
which is,
uh,
January,
yeah,

91
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.200
January.
And,
uh,
you,

92
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.180
you almost looked like out of sorts and like this is where you live,
man.
Yeah,

93
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.780
it was a,
that was my first UFC fight ever.
Um,

94
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.440
Hannibal Burress was in town and,
uh,

95
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.940
texted me and I had seen him out on the road six months ago or something like

96
00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:40.900
that and said,
hey,
you want to go to the fight tonight?
And,
uh,
I'd never,

97
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.490
I've never been to a boxing match or a UFC fight.
So I was like,
sure.
You know,

98
00:05:45.491 --> 00:05:47.020
it seemed like something fun to do.

99
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.290
And I started googling what boxing matches were in la.

100
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.890
I thought it was a boxing match that he invited me to.
Oh,
that's hilarious.

101
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.200
So I couldn't find any boxing matches.
I'm like,

102
00:05:56.201 --> 00:05:58.010
I don't know what fight he's about.
And he said,
well,

103
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:01.250
just meet me at the will call window.
It did set the MGM,
right.
Yeah.

104
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.800
So I meet him at the will call window.
He gets to tickets.
He goes,

105
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:08.000
let's go inside.
I didn't know until we were walking in.

106
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.480
When I saw that case,
I didn't even know what I was walking into.
I was like,

107
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.160
Oh man,
it's one of these deals.
You know?

108
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.790
That's funny.
Yeah.
It was fun though,
man.
It was really fun.

109
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.600
It was so much different than what,
I mean,
I've only seen like little,

110
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.280
I don't follow that.
You know,
I've only seen like what I've seen on sports,

111
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.840
you know,
stuff.
But,
uh,

112
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.950
there's much more art to it too then I expected.
And I was like,

113
00:06:35.951 --> 00:06:39.530
it was just gonna be a brutal,
like a brutal match.
You know,

114
00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:42.640
just two guys just going at it until blood started squirting.
Right.

115
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.930
But it's actually,
um,
there's art and,
and,
and,
and there's a,

116
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.730
there's a science to it.
You know,

117
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:52.010
it's more interesting than I think somebody who,

118
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.490
somebody who's not a fan wouldn't realize that there's more to it than what they

119
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:59.800
might think.
Yeah.
Well there's definitely a lot of,
a lot of technique to yes,

120
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.850
but the ultimate goal is the first part.
The brutal stuff.
Yes.

121
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:08.510
But,
but they don't,
they don't just go out right at it.
They have to figure each,

122
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.560
there's a cha,
it's chess and fighting.
Yes.

123
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.340
There's three ways.
It's a,
it's a,
both of those things are going on.

124
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.293
They're not just,

125
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.260
the belt doesn't mean they don't just start running at each other and you start

126
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.650
pounding each other in the face.
They're waiting.
Sometimes it goes like that,

127
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:27.620
and sometimes they're waiting and looking at each other and figuring out,
well,

128
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:30.490
what's this guy?
Is this guy going to be on defense going gonna be like,

129
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.510
you know what I mean?
That there's more mental stuff.

130
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.470
Then I think people might think,
I would like to watch it as someone,

131
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.630
as a completely uninitiated,
untrained person.
I wouldn't want,

132
00:07:38.631 --> 00:07:42.770
I would like to see what that feels like because I've been watching it so long

133
00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:46.250
are kind of like have lost touch with what it must look like on the outside.

134
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.480
But to see like a guy would like to sit down with you and watch it.

135
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.420
You know,
cause I was nowhere near you.

136
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:58.421
I was over by the payer brougth but right when I was in comedy comedian row man.

137
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.320
Yeah,
you got Tom Rhodes and Tom Rhodes,
myself,
Hannibal Burress.

138
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.040
Uh,
Russell Russell was there.
Yeah.

139
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.740
I mean it was Kinda cool and I appreciate the tickets.

140
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.770
Oh brother Russell's there all the time.
He has a,

141
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:15.770
he keeps a place in Vegas cause he's there occasionally.

142
00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:18.620
And I guess it's one of those tax deals.

143
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.580
Like Vegas has some pretty sweet tax deals.
You know,
if you live in Vegas,
you,

144
00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:26.300
you pay no state taxes.
Right?
Correct.

145
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.840
So like for your income,
that's,
that's pretty big.
Yeah.

146
00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:34.310
When I moved from California to Nevada,
I didn't do it for that reason,
but uh,

147
00:08:34.311 --> 00:08:37.170
it was certainly a nice byproduct.
You know,
it's weird when you think about,

148
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.670
because that's like a lot of money,
you know,
I think it's 10% of your income.

149
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:44.900
Right?
And then some,
some naughty like that.
What state taxes?
I don't know.

150
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:48.380
I don't even know because it's from eight to seven depending on where you live.

151
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.730
Eight to set goes down.

152
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:55.120
I mean it goes anywhere up to 10 but average it's around eight is state income

153
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:59.760
tax state.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
So that's,
that's a lot of money.

154
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.460
If you're making good money,
you know,
that's a,
that's,
that's a big percent.

155
00:09:03.461 --> 00:09:04.350
It's like having a manager.

156
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.430
The reason I know that there are no state taxes is that night,

157
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:13.860
you look in the sky over at the airport and you see a string of pearls.

158
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.070
There's about 15 little white lights.

159
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:21.360
They're all airplanes and they're all coming in and their land in one eye and

160
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:26.390
every one of those little white dots is filled with people and all of their

161
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.740
pockets are filled with money and they're coming to leave it in Las Vegas.

162
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.850
I mean it's,
it's amazing what,
whenever I'm flying home,

163
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.840
flights are usually packed.
People want to go to Las Vegas so they're bring,

164
00:09:39.841 --> 00:09:42.600
you know,
most people are not going to win,
you know,

165
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:47.340
so money just keeps coming into that town.
Yeah.
It's ridiculous.
And that way,

166
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:52.560
I mean it's one of the only places we could think of where you're guaranteed

167
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.430
you're going to have a bunch of people that are going to be risking their money

168
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.800
like and then spending it and then going on.

169
00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.650
I mean like it's a weird place when you think about it that it's based on

170
00:10:01.651 --> 00:10:03.900
gambling.
Right.
You know,
and

171
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.010
I saw an ad for a slot,
you know,

172
00:10:08.011 --> 00:10:13.011
some casino was saying we give 97% of the money back on slots and that was like

173
00:10:13.381 --> 00:10:15.600
a,
that was like a,
a selling point.
And I think,

174
00:10:15.601 --> 00:10:20.340
can you imagine if your bank told you that they would give you 97% of your money

175
00:10:20.341 --> 00:10:22.650
back?
We only take 3% of your money.
Yeah.

176
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.130
Like that's a good thing that does come in here and we'll give you 97% of your

177
00:10:26.131 --> 00:10:28.920
money.
But how do they,
how do I say that?
That's not true?

178
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:33.330
Cause it's just not true.
I mean,
there's no way they give,
they only make 3%.

179
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.840
There's no way.
I don't know.
I don't know if they could,
I,
you know,

180
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:41.040
I'm sure they can't lie.
So there's probably some technical way that that's true.

181
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.160
But Ben,
it's technically true.
I think it's one of those like,
you know,

182
00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:47.850
there's like a house advantage,
you know,
like the house is like a 54% advantage,

183
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.900
you know,
like oh 54 to [inaudible] 46,
you know what I mean?

184
00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.010
It's like one of those deals.

185
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.100
So that's probably how they get away with saying it.
You know,
I don't know.
But,

186
00:10:56.101 --> 00:10:59.490
but you know,
even if that,
even if it was only 3%,

187
00:10:59.491 --> 00:11:02.130
that's still guaranteed money for the casino.
Right.

188
00:11:02.131 --> 00:11:06.150
You're going to lose 3% of your money every time,
which is not,
not every person,

189
00:11:06.151 --> 00:11:07.890
but I mean overall.
Yeah.

190
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.360
If people bet $100,000 they only have to give 97,000 with that back.

191
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.320
There was a weird case recently in um,

192
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:20.780
New Jersey where a bunch of people was ruled they had to give their money back

193
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:26.180
because they won a lot of money playing this game and the dealer had forgot to

194
00:11:28.261 --> 00:11:32.430
shuffle cause the cards had come pre shuffled and so somewhere along the line

195
00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:36.570
he's players realize that the dealer had forgotten to shovel and so they just

196
00:11:36.571 --> 00:11:39.210
jumped their bets up higher and higher and higher every time.

197
00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:41.220
And then they wound up winning like over $1 million.

198
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:46.530
And then it was revealed that the dealers had made a mistake in some way,

199
00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:48.270
shape or form and that the players,

200
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:53.660
by realizing that the dealers had made this mistake were somehow or another,

201
00:11:54.221 --> 00:11:57.700
it was invalid that they won,
which is fucking hilarious.
Yeah,
I,
I don't,

202
00:11:57.701 --> 00:12:01.810
I don't get how some of that stuff is fair.

203
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:04.270
Like the counting cards thing,
I don't,

204
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.380
I don't understand why you're not allowed to do things in your head.

205
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:12.400
You don't a lot of think,
you know what I mean?
I mean first of all,

206
00:12:12.401 --> 00:12:15.190
how do you know what I'm doing in my head?
Exactly.
You know,

207
00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:17.440
just based on my bedding and,
and even if,

208
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.830
even if you're correct in what I'm doing in my head,

209
00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:26.120
why can't I do that in my head?
Yeah.
I,
that blows my mind that you're not alone,

210
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.930
not alone.
They can just come up to and go,
no,
no,

211
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:32.860
we don't want you in here because you're,
you're winning and you're smart.

212
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.310
You're smart.
You're thinking.
Then I did that.
Right.

213
00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:41.290
I think he got trouble kicked out of a place for,
for counting cards.
Well,

214
00:12:41.291 --> 00:12:43.900
Dana White,
the president of UFC,
he gets kicked out all the time.

215
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:47.650
He doesn't even count cards.
He just wins.
He just,
that's a lot of money.

216
00:12:47.651 --> 00:12:50.680
If he wins too much,
they kick them out,
kick you out.
If you win,

217
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.040
like wait a minute,
if I lose,
that's why there's no,

218
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.130
that's why there's no state income tax.
But that's how,

219
00:12:57.131 --> 00:13:01.170
it's also why those places are fucking gigantic and know when you walk into,

220
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.720
you know,
whatever the Venetian,
you know,

221
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:08.220
name a casino and you see how opulent it is and how beautiful decor and that's a

222
00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:09.424
lot of money,
man.

223
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.820
It's been a lot of money in those fountains that you're passing or shooting

224
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.620
water a hundred feet into the sky and a full show of wealth.
I,

225
00:13:17.621 --> 00:13:21.030
um,
I like watching occasionally they'll have one of these,
you know,

226
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:24.790
TV shows where they show how people cheat at the casinos.

227
00:13:24.791 --> 00:13:27.650
And one I thought it was pretty intriguing.
The dealer was,

228
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:32.460
it was like at a blackjack table or something.
The dealer was in on it with,
uh,

229
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:37.180
his friend who showed up and his friends,
his friend was a cheater.

230
00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.840
They were both cheaters.
So his friend put a black,

231
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.990
a cup of black coffee down on the green felt right.

232
00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:49.530
So the dealer who's got a black chip or two in his hand in the palm of his hand,

233
00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:56.010
puts his hand on the top of the cup like this and drops the black chips into the

234
00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.970
Coffee Cup and says,
you can't put that drink here.
And handed it back to the guy.

235
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.260
And the guy goes,
okay.
And then takes his Coffee Cup back.

236
00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.580
That's $5,
loses,
wins,
whatever,
and then walks away.
That's real cheating.

237
00:14:09.581 --> 00:14:13.530
Now that seems to be like,
of course.
Yeah,
that's,
that's outright cheat.
Yeah.

238
00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.440
That's outright cheating.

239
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.350
The counting thing being cheating is fucking ridiculous.
It's like,

240
00:14:17.351 --> 00:14:22.130
what is the game?
The game is yours.
There's 50 what is it?
52 cards.
Yes.

241
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:26.530
52 cards.
You got 52 cards.
Um,
you,
you're watching the know the cards,

242
00:14:26.531 --> 00:14:27.364
they get dealt.

243
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.780
They had all shuffled up and you just do like a mathematical calculation of

244
00:14:31.781 --> 00:14:32.920
probability in your head.

245
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.850
That seems to me to be like a thing that you should do all the time in life.

246
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.840
Well,
of course.
Yeah.

247
00:14:37.841 --> 00:14:41.020
What are the odds if I run this red light where the odds I get hit by a car,

248
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:44.320
well,
it's three in the morning.
There's not as many people driving.
It's probably,

249
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.890
it's absurd.
Yeah.
It's like,

250
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:50.260
it's like going up to a golfer who just stitched a shot from the fairway and

251
00:14:50.261 --> 00:14:54.100
said,
Hey,
you knew that was 148 yards.
You,

252
00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:58.130
you thought about that.
You figured out that that was 148 yards away.

253
00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:00.710
You're not allowed to do that.
You just have to guess.

254
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:04.430
You hit it as hard as you should for 148 yards and that's bullshit.

255
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.800
You're not allowed to be knowing that stuff.
I just,

256
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.320
I've never been in the gambling.
I like gambling on sports.

257
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.090
Like I like gambling on fights particularly.

258
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.150
That's the only sport I really gamble and I don't really know.
I have no,

259
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:20.570
if I gambled on a baseball game,
it would just be like,
who should I bet on?

260
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:25.310
You know,
Detroit,
okay,
go.
But it makes it exciting,
you know?

261
00:15:25.311 --> 00:15:27.230
I really think it should be legal everywhere.
I really do.

262
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.700
I think gambling should be legal everywhere,

263
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.720
but I think these should be able to count cards.
I mean,
I think if you're,

264
00:15:32.721 --> 00:15:35.960
if you're smart,
you should be able to count cards and if you can count cards,

265
00:15:35.961 --> 00:15:39.970
you're going to win.
And that's the fatal flaw in the casino system.
Like you're,

266
00:15:39.971 --> 00:15:43.520
you're going to win consistently.
Well,
I think what little I know about it,

267
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:45.770
I don't know how to count cards,
but what little I know about it.

268
00:15:45.771 --> 00:15:48.770
You have to be perfect.
You have to,
you can't make a mistake.

269
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.350
You have to count every card,
you got to know exactly what's going on.
Yeah.

270
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:55.310
And then you might end up with like a 1% or something advantage or one and a

271
00:15:55.311 --> 00:15:57.860
half percent or something like that.
It's you have to be absolutely perfect,

272
00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:01.370
I would think.
I'm guessing,
I don't know that the fact on that,

273
00:16:01.371 --> 00:16:06.170
but because it's already a pretty even game blackjack.

274
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:09.140
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's pretty even as far as all those games go,

275
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:14.260
they say that the games that like people really like or like craps and blackjack

276
00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.020
because craps is just like fucking chaos.
You know,

277
00:16:18.021 --> 00:16:20.650
you're just rolled in those dice and who the fuck no.

278
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.320
You got to kind of know how to bet and when to bet and when you're feeling hot

279
00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:27.520
and when it's,
when it's going in your favor.
I was,
I,
I,

280
00:16:27.521 --> 00:16:30.460
I've only played craps a couple of times.
One,
one time was a,

281
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:34.130
there were a bunch of comedians in Las Vegas including drew Hastings.
Okay.

282
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:35.090
Drew Hastings was,

283
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.810
he brought us over the craps table and he was going to show me how to play craps

284
00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.250
and I'm standing next to him and I bet on something that what little I knew,

285
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.080
I could tell that it lost,
you know,

286
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:51.170
sort of [inaudible] itself.
But the guy didn't do the,

287
00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.330
the stick thing to pull it.

288
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:57.800
Like he left it there and I was like confused.

289
00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:02.210
So like a moron.
I,
I yelled at the dealer,
you know,

290
00:17:02.211 --> 00:17:05.860
to explain to him that he should,
that he should be taking my money.
Right.

291
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:09.680
And I said,
excuse me,
excuse me a second.

292
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.080
And then I feel this pressure on my foot.

293
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:15.800
Ju drew Hastings just stepping on the top of my foot,

294
00:17:15.801 --> 00:17:18.710
like really hard and he's trying to tell him,

295
00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:24.530
what does he say?
He knows what I'm doing.
So he's like stepping on my foot.
Like,

296
00:17:24.531 --> 00:17:27.860
would you shut up?
What was wrong with what you were doing?
I was going to,

297
00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:30.170
he drew felt they made a mistake.

298
00:17:30.171 --> 00:17:33.650
I should take the money back even though even though I had lost it or just leave

299
00:17:33.651 --> 00:17:37.360
it out there and and bet on that same thing the next time it's their error.
Oh,

300
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:39.550
so it was an error.
Yeah they were supposed to,

301
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:44.000
they were supposed to take my money and I was trying to explain that to them

302
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:48.350
that I lost that fair and square.
Take it away and oh that's funny.

303
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.240
I thought you just didn't understand like what was going on.

304
00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:53.760
Cause craps is one of those weird games where I've,

305
00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.120
I've sat and I've watched people play craps for like 10 minutes,
you know,

306
00:17:57.121 --> 00:18:00.420
just as an observer and I have,
I had no idea what the fuck was going on.

307
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.620
The hard soft cotton still don't know you can come.
Like what is it?

308
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:08.740
Like there's a come right.
Like that's like part of the bed.
I don't even know.

309
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:13.890
I don't know what any of it means.
I know sevens are good.
Eleven's is good.
Right?

310
00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:18.270
Seven and 11 but then they become bad.
If you get a seven on the first thing,

311
00:18:18.271 --> 00:18:20.910
it's good.
But then you roll an eight on the first thing.

312
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.360
Now you want to get an eight before a seven that's all I know.

313
00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.750
How would they assume that people know how to play that fucking game?

314
00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.180
You get new kids involved.

315
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.990
You know like there's certain games that like you used to be like super popular.

316
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.690
I don't know if the old folks dominoes and shit like that.

317
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.850
How do you get people involved and craps?

318
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.700
Maybe that's why they have these big giant fountains is because I've got a bunch

319
00:18:41.701 --> 00:18:45.760
of people like me making sure that they'd take my losses away.

320
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.540
I don't think that's how,
but I think that there's,

321
00:18:48.541 --> 00:18:52.650
there's some weirdness to that game that just like,
it seems way too complicated.

322
00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:54.840
It didn't,
Richard,
Jenny used to have a bit about craps.

323
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.660
I think he did about how no one knows.

324
00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.810
Like everybody thinks they're an expert at certain games.

325
00:19:00.811 --> 00:19:04.170
What he likes about craps is no one knows what the hell is going on.
You know?

326
00:19:04.171 --> 00:19:08.280
Everyone just can see that no one knows what the hell is going on.
Richard.

327
00:19:08.281 --> 00:19:13.050
Jenny has an album that just came out,
obviously.
He really,
yeah,
he,

328
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.890
you know,
he,
I think it just came out,
when did he,

329
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:19.770
he died about five,
six years ago,
right?
Yeah.
Something like that.

330
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.570
So I don't know if somebody had some,
uh,

331
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:24.960
soundtracks of some stuff that he had recorded,
but,
uh,

332
00:19:24.961 --> 00:19:28.350
I downloaded it and listen to it.
It's really good,
man.
He was great.
Yeah,

333
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.710
I took that one hard.
That wouldn't bump me out a lot.
Yeah.

334
00:19:31.711 --> 00:19:34.050
I didn't know him that well.
I knew him and be like,
hey man,
what's up?

335
00:19:34.051 --> 00:19:38.730
How you doing?
You know,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Last like month before he died,

336
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.500
like that month somewhere in there,

337
00:19:40.501 --> 00:19:43.620
I was with him on a plane just randomly and he was just happy to be sitting

338
00:19:43.621 --> 00:19:47.760
right in front of me and we chatted a little bit.
He was always pleasant,

339
00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.520
but I know he was troubled that,
that's just,

340
00:19:50.521 --> 00:19:54.640
that one hit me hard because when I was a kid,
he was a big influence.
He was,
um,

341
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.380
one of my favorites when I was first starting out and he was,
um,

342
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.460
he was on the tonight show back then.

343
00:19:59.461 --> 00:20:03.360
I believe it was Johnny Carson was Johnny Carson tonight show.
And uh,
you know,

344
00:20:03.361 --> 00:20:06.960
I used to watch them on TV on all those evening at the Improv type shows or

345
00:20:06.961 --> 00:20:09.360
whatever it was,
or Hbo.
And then,
uh,

346
00:20:09.361 --> 00:20:13.260
I got to see him a couple times live and he was really good,
really,

347
00:20:13.261 --> 00:20:18.150
really such a good joke writer.
And when he died and it just,

348
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.430
it just bumped me out.
It's just,
it bombed.

349
00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:24.270
It bums me out when people don't feel appreciated and you think they're awesome,

350
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.610
you know?
And he's,
he was one of those guys just,

351
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:28.680
he always wanted to be like Jim Carrey.

352
00:20:28.681 --> 00:20:32.550
He won't always want her to be like some Jerry Seinfeld type guy that had his

353
00:20:32.551 --> 00:20:35.370
own show.
And instead he was,
you know,

354
00:20:35.371 --> 00:20:39.330
it was a big time headliner on the road selling out theaters and clubs,

355
00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.880
doing a lot of those stuff that you're doing,
you know,
essentially.

356
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.120
But for whatever reason he wasn't appreciated or you didn't feel that he was

357
00:20:45.121 --> 00:20:47.770
appreciated,
don't you know,

358
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:53.220
but it was depression that led to what he did and it's hard to know whether it

359
00:20:53.261 --> 00:20:58.261
was a career related depression or just something so much deeper that people who

360
00:20:58.931 --> 00:21:00.940
don't have depression can't even relate to.
Yeah,

361
00:21:00.941 --> 00:21:02.590
that's a good point because when you know,

362
00:21:02.591 --> 00:21:06.970
you see someone that's getting depressed about their career are they're really

363
00:21:06.971 --> 00:21:09.690
depressed about their career or they really depressing me in these careers.

364
00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:13.960
Successful as hell.
It's like why would he be depressed about all that success?

365
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.220
I mean,
look at Robin Williams.

366
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:19.570
I mean you could not have a more successful career then Robin Williams and he

367
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.370
kills himself because of depression.

368
00:21:21.371 --> 00:21:24.490
So clearly it's not necessarily career related.

369
00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:28.510
It's a much deeper thing that people have difficulty understanding.
I don't,

370
00:21:28.511 --> 00:21:31.540
I don't understand it.
Yeah,
he was another one that was like,
wow,

371
00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:32.740
how is that possible?

372
00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.650
How is it possible that Robin Williams wanted to kill himself?
Like I just,

373
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.640
I can't imagine.
And do you remember?

374
00:21:37.641 --> 00:21:41.290
Good Morning Vietnam and pop by and like this guy was on top of the fucking

375
00:21:41.291 --> 00:21:44.740
world.
Did you ever meet him?
Yeah,
I mean it was weird how I met him,
man.

376
00:21:44.741 --> 00:21:48.340
I didn't know I was meeting him until like five minutes into our conversation.

377
00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.330
He was in the,

378
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:53.620
he came to the Improv to see me and he was in line with everybody else to take

379
00:21:53.621 --> 00:21:56.530
pictures.
He had a baseball hat on and a beard and glasses.

380
00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.980
And he came up to me and he was talking to me about a very particular bit that I

381
00:21:59.981 --> 00:22:01.960
did about how much he loved it and this and that.

382
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:07.090
And a couple minutes into talking to him I'm like,
Oh shit,
this,

383
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:11.050
you didn't even know that I have no idea.
I thought it was talking to some guy.

384
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:15.280
Wow.
You know,
we were talking and um,
you know,
he,

385
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:18.790
but he was like real specific.
I was like,
wow,
this guy's real comedy fan.

386
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.050
He's like really into like the specific aspects of the joke.
Oh,

387
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.180
this guy knows comedy.
He's like,
I love,

388
00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:28.080
like you really put yourself out there with that pivot.
It was like,

389
00:22:28.081 --> 00:22:31.720
so you like the way you did it?
It was so this and that.
And I go,
oh,
thanks man.

390
00:22:31.721 --> 00:22:36.280
I'm glad you're,
oh shit.
Wow.
It was like I met him.
I don't,

391
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.160
I was nobody.
He,
he w it wasn't like he was meeting me,

392
00:22:39.161 --> 00:22:42.340
but I just met him at the Improv in New York when there were a number of

393
00:22:42.341 --> 00:22:44.530
comedians and around,
and I met him at the,
uh,

394
00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.630
outdoor comedy day in San Francisco.
You know,

395
00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.400
when there's like 20 comedians on the show when he was one of them outdoor

396
00:22:51.401 --> 00:22:53.710
comedy day.
It's a,
I don't know what it's called,

397
00:22:53.711 --> 00:22:57.850
but it's like a big comedy festival in one of the parks and the San Francisco

398
00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:00.280
outdoor comedy or something.
But,
um,

399
00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:05.440
he was very like sweet and low key and unassuming,

400
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:09.730
like so different from what you know of him on stage,
you know,

401
00:23:09.731 --> 00:23:14.170
like he was almost like reverential to other comedians it seems.
Yeah,

402
00:23:14.171 --> 00:23:16.690
he was,
that's how I felt when I met him too.
And He,

403
00:23:16.691 --> 00:23:21.190
and he's a guy that had this horrible reputation as being a joke thief and you

404
00:23:21.191 --> 00:23:25.000
know,
and I think in his case,
um,
you know,

405
00:23:25.001 --> 00:23:29.770
to talking to people that were victims of what you know of him doing that in his

406
00:23:29.771 --> 00:23:34.771
case that guy just had this deep desire to be loved and deep desire to please

407
00:23:35.681 --> 00:23:37.330
and deep desire to kill.

408
00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.300
And I'm like some comedians they just get kind of addicted to that,

409
00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:44.290
that the killing and they are just trying to figure out what are the buttons I

410
00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:45.980
have to press get this audience to

411
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:46.813
<v 2>right.
Right.</v>

412
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:51.470
As opposed to say a guy like prior who,

413
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:57.170
what he was trying to do was express himself in this way that you would think

414
00:23:57.171 --> 00:24:01.130
what's funny now are saying Robin Williams or prior now prior the prior was

415
00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:02.640
trying to express himself.
Right.

416
00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:05.450
He was trying to like get whatever it was in his head,

417
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.600
whatever thoughts that he had,
whatever feelings that he,
yeah.

418
00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:11.380
He was trying to get you to understand them.
So you would see like what,

419
00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:15.680
what was so funny about this crazy tragedy or ridiculousness of it is life.

420
00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:19.520
It was like a completely different need.
You know,
like both guys,

421
00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.040
every comic wants to be loved.

422
00:24:22.041 --> 00:24:24.410
Every comic wants to be appreciated for what they're doing.

423
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:28.880
But I think with Robin it was,
I don't think like when you hear him talk,

424
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:29.600
I don't think,

425
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.360
I don't think he had the same sort of attachment to what he was talking about

426
00:24:32.361 --> 00:24:33.830
assembly.
Right.
Prior did.

427
00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.730
And so in that sense it was easier for him to just incorporate other people's

428
00:24:37.731 --> 00:24:40.250
ideas.
Just trying to push those buttons,
trying to push on money,

429
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.740
you know,
and that,
that was his style is just like trying to get you to,

430
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:50.730
<v 3>and I used to feel bad for Robin Williams whenever he was doing little</v>

431
00:24:50.731 --> 00:24:55.680
interviews,
whether it was on the local level,
you know,
or promoing a movie.

432
00:24:55.681 --> 00:25:00.681
I think he felt like he had to be funny and every moment.

433
00:25:02.311 --> 00:25:02.591
And,

434
00:25:02.591 --> 00:25:07.591
and I used to feel for him thinking he's created this monster that when he's

435
00:25:08.161 --> 00:25:11.240
doing little local,
not that that's,
you know,

436
00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:15.780
a bad thing to do local interviews,
but whatever,
he's,

437
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.820
whenever he was being interviewed,

438
00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:22.710
I felt like he felt he had to have his foot on the gas 100%.

439
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:23.963
And it's like,

440
00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:28.810
I kind of wish he felt he could just be real and calm down and just answer

441
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.910
without having to go,
you know what I mean?
Um,

442
00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:36.670
so I,
I don't know that just,
and that's why I liked the,

443
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:41.550
the way things are progressing.
I love this podcast concept.

444
00:25:41.551 --> 00:25:46.551
I love the fact that these kinds of atmospheres are allowing people to relax.

445
00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:53.550
You know,
you can be funny within not having to be funny,
you know?
And,
um,

446
00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:57.660
I think up until this transition started happening,

447
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.420
there was a lot of pressure on Comedians,
you know,

448
00:26:00.421 --> 00:26:04.410
doing morning radio and stuff like that to just aren't lights on and be funny.

449
00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.650
You know what I mean?
Well,

450
00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.460
<v 2>it's also when you do morning radio and no one knows you and you're going into</v>

451
00:26:09.461 --> 00:26:10.480
these local stations,

452
00:26:10.481 --> 00:26:13.210
like how many times have you had done a station where they go,
okay,
uh,

453
00:26:13.211 --> 00:26:16.840
what bits you want us to set up?
You know,
like say a Brian,

454
00:26:16.841 --> 00:26:18.670
I hear you just got back from the zoo.

455
00:26:18.671 --> 00:26:23.320
Why don't you tell us about your trip to the zoo?
It was so forth.
Yeah,

456
00:26:23.321 --> 00:26:27.820
it's a fucking man I've been on.
I was on one just a couple of years ago.

457
00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:31.750
It wasn't that long ago where this fucking guy,
man,

458
00:26:31.751 --> 00:26:35.860
this producer guy came back and I would imagine what it would be like to be a

459
00:26:35.861 --> 00:26:39.400
young comic and to deal with this guy.
So the guy comes back with a clipboard.

460
00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:44.010
I said,
all right,
the guys want to know what bits you want to up,
what topics you

461
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.330
<v 1>want discuss.
I go,
dude,
I'm not doing bits.
He goes,
he looked at me like,</v>

462
00:26:48.331 --> 00:26:51.020
what do you plan on doing on,
on the radio?
I go,
we're going to,

463
00:26:51.021 --> 00:26:54.900
I guess we're going to talk.
Is that okay?
I have a conversation.
You know,

464
00:26:54.901 --> 00:26:58.650
like these microphones and he just rolls his eyes and um,

465
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:04.140
walks out of the room,
like in disgust.
You're like,
look,
you know,
look at you,

466
00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:07.600
look at you silly bitch.
You know,
you're living in 1991.
You're like,

467
00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.780
you have no idea what radio is these days.

468
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:14.370
And sometimes I did a radio interview a long time ago and I,
and you know,

469
00:27:14.371 --> 00:27:16.470
I was trying to play the game and it's like a,

470
00:27:16.471 --> 00:27:21.390
I set the guy up on a a bit and it was just as old bit I used to do say,

471
00:27:21.391 --> 00:27:24.150
and I went through to burger king,
drive through,
I felt like an idiot.

472
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.720
I ordered a cheeseburger,
they said drive around.

473
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:32.310
So I drove around for about a half an hour.
All right.
That's the joke.
All right,

474
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:35.610
so I'm in the radio station.
The guy goes,

475
00:27:35.611 --> 00:27:39.930
I understand you like to go fast food places,
you know,

476
00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:42.660
it was like a southern guy.
So I said,
yeah.
I said,

477
00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:44.400
I went to burger king the other day.

478
00:27:44.401 --> 00:27:48.780
I ordered a cheeseburger and a guy said a drive around and he went,

479
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:52.110
ah,
we'll be back after this.

480
00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:01.380
And I'm like,
wow,
that's going to move a lot of tickets.

481
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.410
There's a lot of that's going to sell a lot of tickets out there.

482
00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.440
There's a lot of good guys out there doing radio.
There's a lot of good guys.

483
00:28:07.441 --> 00:28:10.290
They're just,
they're cool.
They like,
they're happy to have you in there.

484
00:28:10.291 --> 00:28:11.124
They're happening to her.

485
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:15.210
But there's also a lot of shitheads that wish they were comedians and there's a

486
00:28:15.211 --> 00:28:17.400
lot of shitheads that like,
they kind of like,

487
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:22.530
they either want it to be comedians and he didn't have the balls to do it,

488
00:28:22.531 --> 00:28:25.920
or they're judging comedians like,
well,
whatever it is.
But you'll,

489
00:28:25.921 --> 00:28:29.430
you'll see them like trying to fuck with you while you're on the air.

490
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:33.120
And also some people to think that there's the only one way to get attention is

491
00:28:33.121 --> 00:28:35.610
to conflict.
Get those guys too.

492
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.720
I've been on those morning shows and it's just fucking God.
It's just like that.

493
00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.750
But that's just what happens when you're out there on the road when you're,

494
00:28:42.751 --> 00:28:45.600
you know,
you're doing these local shows trying to pump up your,
uh,

495
00:28:45.601 --> 00:28:49.470
your performances and everybody has different skillsets,
you know?
Um,

496
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.670
that was never my skillset.
You know,

497
00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:54.870
I'm not a go toe to toe kind of guy.

498
00:28:54.871 --> 00:28:58.810
And if I get into an atmosphere where I feel it's adversarial or they're,

499
00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:03.480
they're trying to,
uh,
I dunno,
push buttons or see if I can,

500
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:08.400
you know,
come back at like little lighthearted insults or whatever.
I,
I just,

501
00:29:08.401 --> 00:29:13.050
I kind of shut down,
you know,
I just like to be a fairly decent guy.

502
00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:15.840
Nice guy.
Oh,
do my comedy.
You know what I mean?

503
00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:18.660
I don't want to hurt anybody and I don't want to be into those awkward

504
00:29:18.661 --> 00:29:21.870
situations.
Well,
some people live off that.
Like that's their whole thing.

505
00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:26.130
Their whole thing is conflict,
constant conflict.
They'll create artificial drama.

506
00:29:26.131 --> 00:29:28.410
Like,
Hey,
we're going to get into one of the,
I had this one guy,
like,

507
00:29:28.411 --> 00:29:31.220
we're going to have a fake fight about,
oh,
it was about Carlos here.

508
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.510
We're going to have faked a fake fight.
I'm gonna pretend that I'm,

509
00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:37.590
I'm taking his side and I'm like,
okay,
well we will see how this works.
Go ahead.

510
00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:41.890
We're going to do a play.
Yeah,
exactly.
Like we're doing an improvised play.

511
00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:43.500
<v 3>Just like,
ah,</v>

512
00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:47.840
<v 2>see it's just that that whole genre was so limited.</v>

513
00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.930
Like the genre of radio itself is so dead.

514
00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:56.300
Like when you have instant access to podcast on your,
on your car,

515
00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.240
like right from your car stereo,
like right from the factor,

516
00:29:59.241 --> 00:30:02.990
what you're starting to see now with like stitcher and you're starting to see

517
00:30:02.991 --> 00:30:04.160
these integrated apps.

518
00:30:04.161 --> 00:30:07.490
And I know I'm pretty aware that there's quite a few other companies that are

519
00:30:07.491 --> 00:30:08.680
interested in getting into it and they're,

520
00:30:08.681 --> 00:30:13.100
they're starting to prepare to integrate themselves with,
uh,

521
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:18.110
with radios.
And a lot of cars come with Wifi in the car.
Like,

522
00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:21.820
like cellular white.
Like I rented a Cadillac,
one of those escalades.
Yeah.

523
00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:26.300
Loved it.
Big fucking giant American monster.
Really comfortable.

524
00:30:26.301 --> 00:30:28.790
And it handles really well too.
I was really impressed.

525
00:30:28.791 --> 00:30:30.170
The new one is pretty bad ass.

526
00:30:30.171 --> 00:30:33.590
But one of the things that was crazy it was the guy was explaining to me that it

527
00:30:33.591 --> 00:30:37.190
has built in cellular connection for Wifi.

528
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:40.160
So you could set up a Wifi hotspot in your car,

529
00:30:40.161 --> 00:30:44.450
you could work from your backseat with your car acting as a Wifi spot.

530
00:30:44.451 --> 00:30:46.790
So like if your kids are in the backseat and they,
you know,

531
00:30:46.791 --> 00:30:49.610
if it has a rear entertainment system or if they have an iPad and they want to

532
00:30:49.611 --> 00:30:51.740
download apps or a movie or whatever,

533
00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:55.460
you can download it from your fucking car as you're driving.

534
00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:59.700
<v 3>I,
I don't,
I don't,
all this technology stuff,</v>

535
00:30:59.701 --> 00:31:03.660
I'm starting to just get further and further away from understanding what's

536
00:31:03.661 --> 00:31:07.230
going on.
You know,
like phone.
No,
no,
no.
I've got an,

537
00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:13.220
I've got an iPhone,
but a Mattel and Ari Shaffir both have flip phones away.
Yep.

538
00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:15.900
Wow.
Are you just recently went back to a flip phone?

539
00:31:15.901 --> 00:31:20.550
I don't think Dave ever left.
Well,
I,
the,
the car I just got,
you know,

540
00:31:20.551 --> 00:31:23.820
the guy was explaining,
uh,
you know,
you just,

541
00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:28.140
but the phone becomes your radio buy through Bluetooth.

542
00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:33.240
I don't know.
I don't even know what that means.
That's so easy.
So I do that.

543
00:31:33.241 --> 00:31:37.560
So I get in my car and I'm driving off the,
uh,
you know,
the lot.

544
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:42.510
And then my,
my radio starts ringing,

545
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.630
you know,
like,
I don't know.
It was my phone.

546
00:31:45.631 --> 00:31:49.080
It was my phone through the Bluetooth.
Wait a minute.
How long ago was this?

547
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:55.290
Just yesterday.
I don't know how long.
A few months ago.
A few months ago.

548
00:31:55.291 --> 00:31:58.290
You didn't know?
I don't know what fuck park and rang.
No,

549
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.120
that's about it.
You're not that old man.
This is crazy.
No,

550
00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:06.810
I figured out my mom knows that,
but I didn't know how to answer it.

551
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:11.430
I didn't know how to,
you know,
and I'm like,
start yelling.
That's what I did.

552
00:32:11.431 --> 00:32:14.430
I just opened a window,
whoever it's trying to communicate with me,

553
00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:18.900
I may chat the next red light.
What did you do?

554
00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:20.940
I just kept,

555
00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:25.260
I was looking at the steering wheel and I saw a little thing that said that had

556
00:32:25.261 --> 00:32:28.770
a button with a,
a phone,
like a phone icon.

557
00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:33.720
So I just press a button and I'm like saying hello.

558
00:32:33.721 --> 00:32:34.381
It felt weird.

559
00:32:34.381 --> 00:32:39.381
I'm like saying hello out loud in a car by myself and then I hear talking

560
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.100
<v 1>to me and I'm like,
God,
this is strange,
you know?</v>

561
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:48.260
So I had a conversation at a conversation out loud to somebody that wasn't

562
00:32:48.261 --> 00:32:51.500
there.
Yeah,
those Bluetooth microphones are getting pretty,
God damn good.

563
00:32:51.501 --> 00:32:54.080
Now some cars like the really like high end cars.

564
00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.080
It almost sounds like you're talking to someone just on a regular handset,

565
00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:58.780
but I had an old one band,

566
00:32:58.781 --> 00:33:02.240
it sounded like I was in a middle of like Madison Square Garden and my phone was

567
00:33:02.241 --> 00:33:04.740
like 50 feet away and I was screaming at it.

568
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:10.410
I was like,
oh,
it would be horrible like people,

569
00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:13.580
I'm going to record you so you could hear how bad you sound to me.

570
00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.350
Is it normal to you now?

571
00:33:15.351 --> 00:33:18.910
Like do you use it every day or do you still are scared of it when it rains?

572
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:24.070
I'm still only had like two or three phone calls that way through the car

573
00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.500
because you know you're supposed to activate.

574
00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.230
I don't turn on the Bluetooth part on my phone.

575
00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:32.150
Sometimes I think a bit and sometimes I don't.

576
00:33:32.151 --> 00:33:34.550
So usually I don't even have that on.
But every once I'll go,

577
00:33:34.551 --> 00:33:37.820
I'll turn that Bluetooth thing on in case I get a phone call and then,

578
00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:40.250
and a hope for a phone call.
Cause it's like,
no,
I'm ready.

579
00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.920
I know we pay parrot to your car.

580
00:33:42.921 --> 00:33:47.510
I picture you driving like a 1978 Seville.
One of the big long ones.

581
00:33:47.511 --> 00:33:50.510
Nice and slow waving everybody.
No,

582
00:33:50.511 --> 00:33:55.370
it's one of the modern SUV deals.
He drive a regular car.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.

583
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.270
Anti lock brakes.
The whole deal navigation system.
You use that?
I don't know.

584
00:33:59.271 --> 00:34:01.700
He's maps.
Mapquest printed out so

585
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:08.230
he does not miss guides as red light.

586
00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:11.840
That's why you stop and go where is such and such?
You know?

587
00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:16.040
Remember those Thomas guys,
we have to fucking g two you sank my battleship.

588
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.910
You had to fucking write down like people would tell you on the Thomas Guy like

589
00:34:19.911 --> 00:34:20.870
where are they?
Address was.

590
00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.450
Do you remember a trip ticks where you get a trip away and they'd like print out

591
00:34:23.451 --> 00:34:26.480
your whole entire trip to like if were going somewhere and you'd like turn the

592
00:34:26.481 --> 00:34:28.790
page.
Like I got five more pages left.
I get there.

593
00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.360
I remember the first time I rented a,

594
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:36.050
I rented a car that had that gps thing when it was first coming out and it

595
00:34:36.051 --> 00:34:39.740
showed like on a map while you were driving it had like a little triangle which

596
00:34:39.741 --> 00:34:44.540
represented your car.
Right.
And then it's showing a map as you're going.

597
00:34:44.541 --> 00:34:48.020
And I had never seen that this was what,
15 years ago when those first came out.

598
00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:50.510
And uh,
I was like,
wow,
that's amazing.

599
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:53.690
And I wanted to see what would happen if I drove in circles.

600
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:58.070
So I got off the highway and went into like a holiday inn parking lot and just

601
00:34:58.071 --> 00:35:02.510
started driving in circles cause I wanted to see if the triangle went in circles

602
00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:06.790
or if the whole map shift,
you know.
Um,

603
00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.370
and I forget what the answer was,
but it's either or.

604
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:14.040
I mean you can be gone either way.
Yeah.
How high end the navigation systems,

605
00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:15.170
you can actually change it.

606
00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:19.820
You can change it so it follows a direction you're traveling or where the map is

607
00:35:19.821 --> 00:35:21.740
always facing north.
So if you're taking a left,

608
00:35:21.741 --> 00:35:25.550
your arrows going left as a map stays straight or you could take,

609
00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.560
you could do it so there were no matter where you're going,

610
00:35:27.561 --> 00:35:31.340
the Arrow's going straight and then the world adjusters around you.
I like,

611
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:34.700
I like the world or adjust to me.
I just,
I remember

612
00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:38.070
I'm going that way.

613
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.820
<v 2>It's about me and my travel.</v>

614
00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:45.050
This world needs to factor in where my Arrow is going,
plan,

615
00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:50.010
it needs to suck it.
Some of them are really good man.

616
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:54.030
Like the Cadillac one that I'd done that I just rented was amazing because the

617
00:35:54.031 --> 00:35:56.790
screen was a laptop.
It's huge.

618
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.540
The Cadillac navigation screen and the screen that's on the like the dashboard,

619
00:36:01.541 --> 00:36:05.130
the screen,
like it's not a dashboard anymore.
Like it's a,
it's an LCD screen.

620
00:36:05.131 --> 00:36:09.870
So like all the different Shit like your tac and your speedometer,
it's not real.

621
00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:10.853
They're virtual.

622
00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:14.890
So it's all flat screen and you're looking at it like a digital image of a

623
00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:19.650
speedometer that shows you like,
it looks like a circular analog speedometer.

624
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:23.280
Right.
And you know,
it goes like whoa.
Like you could see the,
the dial moving,

625
00:36:23.281 --> 00:36:27.000
but it's not all just all digital.
Hmm.
Yeah.
A lot of cars are doing that.

626
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:29.610
<v 4>Oh,
it's pretty hard to fuck with like ways though.
You know?</v>

627
00:36:29.611 --> 00:36:33.810
I don't know if you use ways.
Oh yeah.
Ways is great.
That's saved me so many.
Like,

628
00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.280
Oh shit.

629
00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:37.450
<v 2>Cop had head.
Well Tony and I rented when we were up in Portland.</v>

630
00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:40.890
We rented this Cadillac and talking to the Cadillac,

631
00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.800
I would start screaming out at you fuck a bitch.
You know what I'm saying?
Like I,

632
00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:47.390
you know,
there's a button like take me to helium comedy club.
It didn't star.

633
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:51.960
It didn't know what the fuck to do.
But I go check this out,

634
00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:53.610
navigate to helium comedy club.

635
00:36:53.611 --> 00:36:57.690
I just press Siri and Siri goes navigating to helium comedy club and share the

636
00:36:57.691 --> 00:36:59.690
best.
Throw my phone down.

637
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.820
I just listened to the phone like fuck this navigation system in the car.

638
00:37:02.821 --> 00:37:03.740
They're just not as good.

639
00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:05.580
<v 4>I want to try apple play,
which is the,</v>

640
00:37:05.581 --> 00:37:09.630
where it pretty much just takes your apple screen on the gps.

641
00:37:09.631 --> 00:37:13.500
So you have all the like Spotify or whatever you have on your phone is that,

642
00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:15.850
it's called apple plates and some cars already.

643
00:37:15.851 --> 00:37:18.750
And you could also do it like I'm thinking about getting my forever like an old

644
00:37:18.751 --> 00:37:22.830
Ford Edge and they'd take out the screen and they put it in like an iPad in it.

645
00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.770
So then it's just an iPad who's doing that?

646
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:29.700
A lot of car places are doing that nowadays.
Those custom car places,

647
00:37:29.701 --> 00:37:32.960
they just throw an iPad that's way better.
Yeah,
totally.
What about the uh,

648
00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:36.800
you mean separate from where the speedometer and all that stuff and the gas

649
00:37:36.801 --> 00:37:39.880
gauge?
That middle part.
The middle part where the navigation is?
Yeah,

650
00:37:39.881 --> 00:37:43.500
like mine is that got 2008 and the thing in there,

651
00:37:43.501 --> 00:37:46.050
it's just so outdated and stuff,
so it's pointless to even happen.

652
00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:47.220
So they just take that out,

653
00:37:47.221 --> 00:37:51.450
put an iPad in there with like three g or four g LTE or whatever.

654
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:54.750
And uh,
so you have internet,
you can make hot spots.

655
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.930
You also have an iPad in there that's way better.
Way Better.

656
00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.350
<v 2>The problem is a lot of those things,</v>

657
00:37:59.351 --> 00:38:02.650
they have a lot of shit integrated into those screens.
Like they have like your,

658
00:38:02.651 --> 00:38:06.830
your mileage.
Yeah.
No,
you're like,
you're,
you're the,
you know,
like the,

659
00:38:06.831 --> 00:38:10.360
the temperature of the car and air conditioning and all that jazz.

660
00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:15.160
Like all I have is integrated into the screen and use of the phone Bluetooth,

661
00:38:15.161 --> 00:38:16.700
this,
that,
the other thing,
like

662
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.690
<v 4>they have these adapters now for like cars.
So like a lot of like,
like mine has,</v>

663
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:24.170
uh,
like my health reports are built into my stereo,
so we're like

664
00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:28.240
<v 2>health reports.
So like you're dead bitch.
Yeah.
No,
you're not good.
You Look Green,</v>

665
00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:31.730
right?
Where,
where it tells you you need,
like you're driving.

666
00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:36.100
I don't want to health report.
Hey,
turn left.

667
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:39.280
How much did you sleep a minute last night.
Is this real?

668
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:43.610
How much cocaine was crazy?
Yeah.

669
00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:45.800
It just takes your blood from the steering wheel.
Yeah.

670
00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.040
It gives you a little pin prick that's coming.
Right.

671
00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:49.690
Like like when you're grabbing on the steering wheel,

672
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:53.800
it should have your heart rate already like displayed or you're a all the,

673
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:55.570
well they're going to be able to give you,

674
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:58.450
they're going to be able to give you a scan with an APP.
You know,

675
00:38:58.451 --> 00:39:01.900
look for sure there's going to be able to have an app where you could scan

676
00:39:01.901 --> 00:39:03.160
someone and find out what's wrong with them.

677
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:06.580
I mean it's not going to happen tomorrow but it will probably happen within a

678
00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.480
decade.
There'll probably be something you have to wear.

679
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:12.310
You know like people wear those fitbit's those risks things and the risk things

680
00:39:12.311 --> 00:39:15.850
tell you like how much you slept.
Like they'll tell you your sleep cycle.

681
00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:17.830
Like people are really into those man.

682
00:39:17.831 --> 00:39:21.970
Finding out how deep they slept and how much rem sleep you got.
Yeah.

683
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.840
And those things are pretty slick because they show up on your,
you know,

684
00:39:25.841 --> 00:39:28.100
your computer.
You can like read the readouts.

685
00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:31.960
Like this week I've been getting much more sleep and my heart rate is lower and

686
00:39:31.961 --> 00:39:35.140
this is then my fitness level,
my body fat,
all that jazz.

687
00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:37.810
You can add all that stuff in and,
and you know,

688
00:39:37.811 --> 00:39:40.120
you look at like your life is like,

689
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.340
you can look at your body like the health of your body.

690
00:39:42.341 --> 00:39:45.850
Like you would look at the,
you know,
analysis of a car.

691
00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:49.800
Like when they plug a car into a computer.
Now if you go to get a tune up,

692
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:54.010
a lot of these newer cars,
they there,
it's,
everything is done by computer.

693
00:39:54.011 --> 00:39:56.560
So they're doing everything.
They're checking your smog there,

694
00:39:56.561 --> 00:39:58.690
checking the way the engine works,

695
00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.630
all that shit is just being analyzed by a computer.

696
00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:04.200
<v 3>You uh,
you talked about the Cadillac Escalade.</v>

697
00:40:04.201 --> 00:40:07.320
I had one of those as my previous car and

698
00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.670
somehow I,

699
00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:15.570
on my email I would be sent a monthly status report of my car.

700
00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:20.610
Like if a tire was low on pressure or something like that,

701
00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:24.440
it would come in an email.
How you tell me now,
how about now?

702
00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:28.920
I thought that was amazing.
That is pretty cool.
You know,

703
00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:33.870
it seems like technology things get,
things get easier to use,

704
00:40:33.871 --> 00:40:36.050
like more user friendly and then they,

705
00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:39.390
and then they go to another level where they get more challenging again.

706
00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:41.850
You know,
like when computers first came out,

707
00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.570
you couldn't work a computer unless you took a computer class and figured out

708
00:40:45.571 --> 00:40:46.710
how to work those deals.

709
00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:49.800
And then they became user friendly where they're very visual and you just click,

710
00:40:49.801 --> 00:40:51.660
click,
click,
click,
click.
Um,

711
00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:55.590
but talk about televisions.

712
00:40:55.770 --> 00:41:00.630
Televisions have gotten so complicated,
I don't even know how to work my TV.

713
00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:04.350
Yeah,
like inputs and share every single thing,
you know,
it's like,

714
00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:10.220
why is there like nine different configurations of the screen you want

715
00:41:10.351 --> 00:41:13.500
letterbox?
Do you want widescreen?
You want normal screen?

716
00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.530
You want five to two ratio,
three to seven ratio.

717
00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.040
I don't even know why isn't there just one thing?
Right.

718
00:41:20.070 --> 00:41:24.330
Why don't you just plug the TV in and it comes on.
You know why?

719
00:41:24.331 --> 00:41:27.240
Because there's a lot of people that are real tech tech geeks.

720
00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.470
They love that shit.
Yeah.

721
00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:31.920
<v 2>Like when they do that ces show in Vegas,
if you ever gotten to that.
No,</v>

722
00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:34.550
he didn't need to go to that.
You want to blow your fucking brains out.

723
00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.350
I need to not go to that.
Lots of fascinating,

724
00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.960
it's fascinating to see like all the gadgets that they're working on.

725
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:45.560
Like one of the podcast sponsors.
What,
what does that,
Jamie,

726
00:41:45.561 --> 00:41:48.410
pull that up if you can that uh,
that one thing.
That one,

727
00:41:48.411 --> 00:41:51.890
the ces best show smart things.

728
00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:56.210
It's one of the sponsors for this podcast and it allows you to do everything

729
00:41:56.211 --> 00:42:00.650
from your phone.
Turn your lights on,
change your heat.
It's fucking crazy.

730
00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:02.720
You do it from your phone.
Well you're not even there.

731
00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.690
I Ha I have smart things.com.

732
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:10.700
This is a one CS,
a best new,
whatever the fuck it is.

733
00:42:10.701 --> 00:42:15.410
Best App.
Some,
some bad ass award.
Yeah.
It's pretty slick.
Yeah.

734
00:42:15.411 --> 00:42:17.720
We're in the future right here.
This podcast in the future,

735
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:20.420
like I've asked you to put something up here,
you would just fold it up and do,

736
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:23.270
we're in HD two.
Can you put a say that Tri caster,

737
00:42:23.271 --> 00:42:24.720
that thing crashes every 10 show

738
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:28.530
really does crash every time.
Yeah.

739
00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:29.800
<v 4>Is this something that like,</v>

740
00:42:29.830 --> 00:42:33.820
like plugs into like an outlet that has like a Wifi connection to so it turns on

741
00:42:33.821 --> 00:42:36.160
and off.
Does everything,
does everything.

742
00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.980
<v 2>I'm setting up my whole house with this.
They sent it to me.
I'm,</v>

743
00:42:38.981 --> 00:42:42.490
I'm setting my whole house up with this.
So it all works from an APP.

744
00:42:42.491 --> 00:42:45.430
It's fucking sweet and then someone can hack it in the middle of the night.

745
00:42:45.431 --> 00:42:48.280
Your House turns into a fucking discount.
It's true beauty

746
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:56.170
and they start playing like Taylor swift
and you can't stop.

747
00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:00.890
<v 4>It is pretty crazy.
Like,
like drop cam like I,
those are those little cameras.</v>

748
00:43:00.891 --> 00:43:03.340
I put one in my bed so I can record myself sleeping in,

749
00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:07.280
see how many times I wake up because it's got motion controls that will show

750
00:43:07.281 --> 00:43:08.960
when you move or when you make a noise.

751
00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.440
And it's crazy how many times I will wake up and say something and then go back

752
00:43:12.441 --> 00:43:15.870
to bed.
Okay,
so there's your body fighting off.
Wait a second.

753
00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:18.080
There's this 24 hours in a day,

754
00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:23.210
eight of 'em you're sleeping and another eight you're watching you sleeping

755
00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:28.250
leaves.
That leaves eight to actually try to accomplish something.
No,

756
00:43:28.251 --> 00:43:32.210
he's not trying to accomplish shit.
You don't know Brian?
He's just having fun.

757
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:35.780
But the um,
the,
the,
this sounds like one of those poltergeist movies,

758
00:43:35.781 --> 00:43:38.090
like you would see the fucking ghost hovering over you in the middle of the

759
00:43:38.091 --> 00:43:39.710
night,
fucking your face while you're sleeping.

760
00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:44.510
What does that rewind it like one of those,
a paranormal.

761
00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:48.110
It is crazy because like I talk a lot in my sleep I guess.

762
00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:50.630
And when you do talk it's like somebody else is talking,

763
00:43:50.631 --> 00:43:53.510
but using your mouth and voice and want,
you have no recollection.

764
00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:54.740
Lean like you weren't doing it.

765
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:57.140
Somebody else is controlling your body's what it seems like.

766
00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:58.640
What are they saying to you?
I don't know.

767
00:43:58.641 --> 00:44:03.440
Like I'll wake up and just pick what do I hae my for it and I'm just like,

768
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:08.360
then I go back to Brits.
But yeah,
it's weird.
It's creepy singer herself.

769
00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.310
So awake and talking,

770
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:14.480
<v 2>this whole sleeping is very fucking strange.
One of them,
Kelly,</v>

771
00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:18.080
it is one of the guys who's been on the podcast for is a fitness expert.

772
00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:21.220
He's sending me this thing you're supposed to,

773
00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:25.520
it's like a pad that you put under your bed that uh,
oh you put under your,
um,

774
00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:30.260
your uh,
sheets and it,
it chills you down to like,
it chills your body.
Like it's,

775
00:44:30.261 --> 00:44:33.210
it's very cold.
Like you're sleeping in it and is,

776
00:44:33.211 --> 00:44:37.860
I think it's gets down to like 58,
50 between 58 and 62 degrees.
You plug it in.

777
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:42.390
Yeah.
And you sleep like essentially air conditioned and uh,

778
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.270
I'm like,
I'm looking now like why the fuck would you do that?

779
00:44:45.271 --> 00:44:48.820
Like I want to be warm.
What's the purpose of apparently you,

780
00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:53.370
your body gets the deepest sleep if it's a little chilly environment.

781
00:44:53.371 --> 00:44:57.990
Joey Diaz has always said that Joey Diaz sleeps like you go into his room.

782
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:59.250
I've gone into his room before,

783
00:44:59.251 --> 00:45:01.080
like when we're on the road together and I'm like,

784
00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:04.650
well this is fucking penguins waddle and out of here.
It's ridiculous.

785
00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:09.300
Like he takes his AC and he cranks it to the bottom.
He will take it.

786
00:45:09.301 --> 00:45:12.230
Like if you go to a hotel and it gives you like 30 degrees or what,

787
00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:16.560
he will literally try to get his hotel down at 30 degrees.
He's fucking crazy.

788
00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:19.410
I've always thought,
because he's,
you know,

789
00:45:19.411 --> 00:45:21.180
he's very overweight and I always say like,

790
00:45:21.181 --> 00:45:24.870
it was probably like if you're walking around everywhere wherein like 10
jackets,

791
00:45:24.871 --> 00:45:27.600
like you would want everything to be colder in your room.

792
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:31.290
So that's what he's doing.
He just,
he's covered in,
you know,

793
00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:36.440
I think it's her fat bizarre that the human body needs this weird recharge mode.

794
00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:44.580
The sleeping thing,
you know,
for like a third of the time you're alive,

795
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:47.070
you gotta be in some bed.

796
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:50.680
Just regrouping and you know,

797
00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:55.470
I wonder if medical people at some point,
whatever,
be able to eliminate that.

798
00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:59.550
You know,
they've worked on that.
They're very close there.
There's actually some,

799
00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:03.300
some various work that's been done on creating some sort of a pill that makes it

800
00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:07.650
like where your body completely resets and you don't need it anymore.

801
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:10.830
There's a bunch of different options that the people have worked on,

802
00:46:10.831 --> 00:46:14.420
but I don't think they totally understand what's going on during sleep.
Yeah.

803
00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:18.030
I think people that don't sleep,
like they've done some,

804
00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:21.780
some tests on people with a forced him to not sleep for like three or four days

805
00:46:21.781 --> 00:46:26.130
in a row.
You become psychotic.
He starts seeing shit.
You hallucinate,

806
00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.290
you become completely out of it.

807
00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:32.250
But that's what you're doing when you're sleeping,
you're dreaming,
you're,
you're,

808
00:46:32.251 --> 00:46:34.230
you're,
you're seeing things that aren't really there.

809
00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:38.910
So it's either going to take place while you're sleeping or if you don't sleep

810
00:46:38.911 --> 00:46:39.744
while you're awake.

811
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:43.650
I wonder if it's the same effect I to have to like if they measure your

812
00:46:43.651 --> 00:46:44.251
chemicals,

813
00:46:44.251 --> 00:46:47.460
the chemicals in your brain and wonder if it's the same thing that's going on

814
00:46:47.461 --> 00:46:50.880
when they do those sleep deprivation studies.
Cause people just,

815
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:53.610
they get like close to heart attacks,
they look ready to die.

816
00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:58.710
You will die if you don't get enough sleep.
Yeah.
I just wonder what the,
uh,

817
00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:03.030
I,
I'm sure there are dream experts who work on this,

818
00:47:03.031 --> 00:47:08.031
but I'm fascinated with what's going on when someone's dreaming.

819
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:11.770
What,
what is the purpose of the dream and what is it,
uh,
you know,
what,

820
00:47:11.771 --> 00:47:14.760
what is it helping you with when you're awake?
You know,

821
00:47:14.761 --> 00:47:17.580
if you have a dream that has anxiety in it or if you have a dream where you're

822
00:47:17.581 --> 00:47:20.940
being chased or you know,
any of these typical dreams that people have.

823
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:25.130
What I just wonder what is that,
what is the purpose of that?
Your,

824
00:47:25.131 --> 00:47:28.800
your brain and your body is doing that for a reason?
Well,

825
00:47:28.801 --> 00:47:31.900
I have work related dream.
Sometimes I need to,

826
00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:35.860
those work related dreams are almost always related to actual concerns that I

827
00:47:35.861 --> 00:47:36.760
have in real life.

828
00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:41.260
Like I'll have work related dreams that are like forget my material and it might

829
00:47:41.261 --> 00:47:44.830
be because I haven't been working like I took a week off or something like that.

830
00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:49.870
And although I know like externally I know like,

831
00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:53.980
or I shouldn't say externally like I know consciously that like if I'm going to

832
00:47:53.981 --> 00:47:57.850
do a show like say on Friday and I haven't worked for a week or so,

833
00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:01.660
I'll do a few tuneup shows,
I'll do a show on Wednesday or showing Thursday,

834
00:48:01.661 --> 00:48:03.610
I'll go over my material,
listen to recordings,

835
00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:06.310
but my brain doesn't trust that I'm actually going to do that.

836
00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:08.380
So if I haven't worked for a week,

837
00:48:08.381 --> 00:48:11.920
my brain like dude you don't even remember even knew she knew her.

838
00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:14.210
A bunch of people who had to see you.

839
00:48:14.211 --> 00:48:16.510
You don't even remember this new shit you're working on,

840
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:20.720
you know and my brand like I didn't remember my new shit stop.
I've got,

841
00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:23.950
I've written down,
I've got recordings but you brain doesn't want to hear that.

842
00:48:23.951 --> 00:48:25.150
Your brain's like listen fucker,

843
00:48:25.151 --> 00:48:28.990
you better stay on the ball constantly and he little weird thing that you might

844
00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:31.960
have in the back of your head that could possibly go wrong.

845
00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:34.710
That'll be brought to the forefront while you're sleeping.
For some reason.

846
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:38.470
<v 3>I have a lot of dreams about shows,</v>

847
00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:42.430
but they're always pre show.
They're never,
they're never me on stage.

848
00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:47.290
It's always assessing,
assessing the situation.
It's always looking at the crowd,

849
00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:49.660
looking at where the,
how the tables are set up,

850
00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:53.590
looking at the lighting and it's all pre,
I don't know why.
I don't know why.

851
00:48:53.591 --> 00:48:57.370
Those are the dreams that I never hit the stage in the dreams.

852
00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:02.020
How many dreams do you have?
Appreciate it.
I've probably had,
I dunno,
Gosh,

853
00:49:02.021 --> 00:49:07.000
a hundred in my life really.
That's strange.
And they're all pre show,

854
00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:07.391
you know,

855
00:49:07.391 --> 00:49:11.980
walking around while the other guys on stage and peeking out the side and trying

856
00:49:11.981 --> 00:49:14.350
to see if people are focused and uh,

857
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:19.090
and yet in real life I don't really have that anxiety.
I mean,

858
00:49:19.091 --> 00:49:21.370
you know what I mean?
It's not part of my,
maybe a little bit,

859
00:49:21.371 --> 00:49:25.570
but not to the degree that it happens in my dreams.
That's so strange.
Yeah.

860
00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:29.210
<v 2>Dictionaries or bibles where like if you're flying,</v>

861
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:31.980
that means you're trying to reach something in your life that still,
you know,

862
00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:34.260
hard to get to and stuff you've ever looked at.

863
00:49:34.261 --> 00:49:37.260
One of those and tried to find that.
Well,

864
00:49:37.261 --> 00:49:40.770
some of it I do kind of by the flying one I do,
but drowning,

865
00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:42.590
maybe I and I,

866
00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:45.930
<v 3>I used to have the flying dreams,
which I don't have any more.
When I was young,</v>

867
00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:50.960
I used to have this very bizarre recurring dream that I was the only one that

868
00:49:52.291 --> 00:49:57.180
figured out how to fly.
And it was all about,
no,
no,
no.

869
00:49:57.181 --> 00:49:59.250
It was a very gentle flight.

870
00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:03.300
It was trusting a gentle breeze.

871
00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:04.740
So bizarre.

872
00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:10.680
I was the only one that knew it could be like a three,
four mile an hour breeze.

873
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:14.190
I knew how to face it and trust it.

874
00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:19.250
I had to lean forward into it and then just lift my feet and then I would just

875
00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:23.280
start kind of going up like a balloon,
very gently and everybody would go,

876
00:50:23.281 --> 00:50:25.470
what the hell is going on here?
It was strange,

877
00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:28.040
but I was the only one that knew how to do it.
Like no one else could figure

878
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.850
<v 2>it out,
but it was a trusting.
It was,
I had to trust that I could do it.</v>

879
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.160
That's so strange.
Bizarre dream.

880
00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:37.300
<v 4>Yeah.
I'm always trying to it.
I always had the flying one,</v>

881
00:50:37.301 --> 00:50:41.080
but it was always very violent trying to,
didn't try to stay up there.

882
00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:45.130
The add China did our oven bird flapping wing type thing,

883
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:47.200
so uh,

884
00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.140
<v 2>yeah.
Everybody wants to fly.
Everybody wants to be able to breathe under water.</v>

885
00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.720
Those are two big ones.
I don't have that.
Never had that.

886
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:54.670
I don't have the water one.
No,
I've had that one.

887
00:50:54.671 --> 00:50:58.690
I've had the flying one and the breathing under water one.
Hmm.
Yeah,
it's a,

888
00:50:58.691 --> 00:51:01.210
those are like recurring archetypes or

889
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:07.270
themes to dreams and I want to sex.
It's also,

890
00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:08.730
do you guys have reoccurring?
Like,

891
00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:13.580
like how did that soundtrack and your and your dreams.
Oh,
okay.

892
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:17.490
Do you guys get recurring like,
like houses that,

893
00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:21.040
what's that sound?
You guys hear that?
Did I do something?
Yeah.
What is that?

894
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:25.750
<v 5>What happened?
You don't hear that Jamie.
Okay,</v>

895
00:51:25.751 --> 00:51:26.584
that sounds good.

896
00:51:26.590 --> 00:51:29.260
<v 2>I think that's your,
a tri caster about the shit and our mouth.</v>

897
00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:34.390
You're about to have a sex dream and it's a soundtrack starting to warm up.
Wow.

898
00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:36.940
That's,
that's an awful sound.
Is that coming through?

899
00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:38.253
<v 5>What'd you just do?</v>

900
00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:44.610
It's that move your move your laptop look at at a weird,

901
00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:51.270
<v 2>well it's on the laptops.
On the microphone.
Okay,
well that's weird.
Yeah,</v>

902
00:51:51.620 --> 00:51:53.960
it's on the mic.
Cable.
What makes sense?
Do you guys have reoccurring?

903
00:51:53.961 --> 00:51:57.710
Like why the fuck did you just do there?
What do you hear that,
that crackle.

904
00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:01.730
<v 5>Whoa was only my son.
Oh,</v>

905
00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:05.980
<v 4>I didn't hear that one.
We've got a ghost.
That was your spine.</v>

906
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:08.670
Crazy crackle.
Uh,

907
00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:12.580
do you guys have reoccurring places in your dreams that don't even make like I

908
00:52:12.581 --> 00:52:15.310
have a place that every time I go to I'm like,
oh,
met this place again.

909
00:52:15.311 --> 00:52:17.890
But it's not my house.
It's not a place I've been to.

910
00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:22.330
It's just a reoccurring environment isn't it?
Like what does it look like?

911
00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:25.180
It's a hotel that's really,

912
00:52:25.181 --> 00:52:30.181
really tall and the elevator is really fast and it's just like this old haunted

913
00:52:31.061 --> 00:52:34.000
hotel.
And I always go to the same hotel and it,

914
00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:38.290
it's not a real hotel I that I think of,
but ever since I was a kid,

915
00:52:38.291 --> 00:52:41.620
exact same hotel and I'll have that dream like once a year where I go to this

916
00:52:41.621 --> 00:52:42.454
weird hotel

917
00:52:42.730 --> 00:52:46.850
<v 2>I,
that hotel is in my dream,
but I'm gently,
gently,</v>

918
00:52:46.851 --> 00:52:48.220
gently loading past diaper.

919
00:52:48.221 --> 00:52:53.221
He asked and I just look over and I kind of wave at you down there and you're

920
00:52:53.571 --> 00:52:58.160
flying up and down town.
It's like telling your terror,
Disneyland,

921
00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:00.650
terrorized.
I can see you terrorized over there,

922
00:53:00.651 --> 00:53:04.150
but I'm just gently enjoying life.
Have you ever done that?
Tower of terror.

923
00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.380
Disneyland,
California Adventures.
Fucking awesome.
That's what it is.

924
00:53:07.381 --> 00:53:10.100
It's a haunted hotel elevator,
which sounds like,
yeah,

925
00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:12.410
that's what I was thinking when you were describing it.
You're,

926
00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:16.340
that's the tower of terror.
Maybe it's a dope elevator ride if you ever on it.

927
00:53:16.341 --> 00:53:18.950
Yeah,
it's really fun.
It's not the haunted mansion out anywhere.

928
00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:23.930
It stretches tower of terror.
It said California.
Great Adventure,
Huh?

929
00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:26.720
California ventures.
Whatever the fuck it is,
and you,

930
00:53:26.721 --> 00:53:29.610
you get on this elevator and it tells you the story.
It shows.

931
00:53:29.611 --> 00:53:33.390
It's like some rod sterling type dude pretending to be the twilight zone guy.

932
00:53:33.391 --> 00:53:36.750
Right.
And he tells you the whole story about these people that got zapped by

933
00:53:36.751 --> 00:53:41.460
electricity and the lightening bolt came and hit the elevator and killed them

934
00:53:41.461 --> 00:53:44.850
and turn them into ghosts and now they're fucking haunted and the elevator is

935
00:53:44.851 --> 00:53:48.060
haunted and you go flying up,
flying down.
Yeah.
You literally,

936
00:53:48.061 --> 00:53:50.100
your ass comes off the seat,
you have to strap in,

937
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:54.180
but your ass literally comes up off the seat because you'd go down so quickly.

938
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:56.790
You go down faster than gravity.
Yeah,

939
00:53:57.250 --> 00:53:59.400
<v 3>you should do that.
No,
I don't want to do that.
It's fun.</v>

940
00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:04.180
What if dreams are the real world and this is our,
the actual fake flows.

941
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:08.820
Creams.
Show me love.
What apps,

942
00:54:08.821 --> 00:54:11.200
what are you talking about?
That's a tough one.

943
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:17.040
<v 2>Dreams of the real world.
Well,
there's no idea.
There's no,</v>

944
00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:19.350
no one has any idea what the fuck is going on.

945
00:54:19.351 --> 00:54:22.080
When you close your eyes and wake up in the morning and you've got a whole new

946
00:54:22.081 --> 00:54:26.260
day,
that consciousness,
whatever it is,
you know,
unconscious consciousness,

947
00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:30.000
that state of mind,
whatever it is,
why you're sleeping,
it's very,

948
00:54:30.001 --> 00:54:32.610
very poorly understood.

949
00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:36.270
We know that there's all sorts of chemicals floating around inside the brain.

950
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:37.321
While that's happening,

951
00:54:37.321 --> 00:54:40.650
there's rem sleep and all these different neurotransmitters that are buzzing

952
00:54:40.651 --> 00:54:44.430
around your your system,
but we don't really know what's going on.
We don't,

953
00:54:44.431 --> 00:54:45.690
you know,
when you have like deep,

954
00:54:45.730 --> 00:54:50.640
we assume that it's connected to various anxieties and wants and needs and those

955
00:54:50.641 --> 00:54:53.100
are like the source of your dreams,
but at the end of the day,

956
00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:54.870
it's a lot of fucking speculating.

957
00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:57.660
There's a lot of speculating as to what's happening while you're dreaming

958
00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:01.920
software updates.
It could be,
it could be that there's,

959
00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:06.210
it could be that we have this idea and this is where it gets real weird,
right?

960
00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:09.630
We have this idea that like everything that is in this world,

961
00:55:09.631 --> 00:55:12.390
we touch things and you pick things up and you weigh things,

962
00:55:12.391 --> 00:55:14.940
you measure things that that's the only way things can be real.

963
00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:18.150
The only way things can be real is if you can measure them,
weigh them,

964
00:55:18.151 --> 00:55:20.550
and put them in,
put them in a box and carry them around.

965
00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:24.030
But that's our own prejudice because that's how we live most of our conscious

966
00:55:24.031 --> 00:55:27.960
life.
We live most of our conscious life with very hard physical things.

967
00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:32.370
But if you could just abandon that for a moment and just imagine a world where

968
00:55:32.371 --> 00:55:35.340
you don't have physical things that you pick up.

969
00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:39.060
Would it be possible to exist only in a state of thought would it?

970
00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:44.120
Would it be possible that the mind is another environment or what you're

971
00:55:44.161 --> 00:55:48.120
thinking about in your imagination is another environment.
It's just you don't,

972
00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:52.880
there's no solid things there.
That's weird.
Yeah.
I mean that's really what

973
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:55.950
<v 3>ooky well,
here's one thing.
You know,</v>

974
00:55:55.951 --> 00:55:58.040
you talk about what's real and what's not real.
I,

975
00:55:58.070 --> 00:56:02.580
I've had many moments in my dreams where I'm trying to decide if it's real or

976
00:56:02.581 --> 00:56:06.810
not and I come to the conclusion that it is real okay.

977
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:11.100
And then in my dream to do,
and then when I wake up,
you know,

978
00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:14.580
we're in a different plane of existence where I go,
okay,
that was a dream,

979
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:18.390
but why wasn't that real while it was happening,
if I made the,

980
00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:22.500
if I came to the conclusion that that was real while I was experiencing it,

981
00:56:22.501 --> 00:56:24.070
I mean that's as,
that was as real

982
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:27.400
<v 2>at that time.
As later when I'm awake.
Yeah.</v>

983
00:56:27.401 --> 00:56:32.350
Why are you not trusting your dream self and only trusting your this self?
Well,

984
00:56:32.351 --> 00:56:34.240
because of the south was there all the time.
Anyway,

985
00:56:34.241 --> 00:56:36.550
I'm going to be at the chuckle hut.
Saturday.

986
00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:41.140
I got two shows.
Friday to Saturday

987
00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:44.590
is a weird world.

988
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:49.300
The world of dreams is a world weird world of all these people analyze them.

989
00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:51.700
All of these people debate what's going on.

990
00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:55.620
I feel like I gave away my breeze dream.
Now everyone is going to be that now.

991
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:58.080
Now when I'm dreaming it,
I'm going to look around.

992
00:56:58.090 --> 00:57:01.150
Everybody's going to be around me floating around going,
hey,
thanks for the tip.

993
00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:04.530
We didn't realize you just had to trust it.
I'm good.
Darn it.

994
00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:06.520
Now it's all crowded up here,
man.

995
00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:10.540
One of these days I'm going to figure out how to do lucid dreaming.

996
00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:14.200
I'm going to sit down with someone who actually is a real legit lucid dreamer

997
00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:17.110
and have a conversation with them about it because the people that are there

998
00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:19.990
techniques that you can practice in their states of mind that you can get

999
00:57:19.991 --> 00:57:23.710
yourself into,
allegedly,
I've never experienced it other than accidentally,

1000
00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:28.930
but when you have dreams so you can control those dreams and that you could

1001
00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:33.490
navigate and create things that happen in your dreams,

1002
00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:36.940
be aware of the fact that you're doing it like that it's a skill and that you

1003
00:57:36.941 --> 00:57:40.900
could develop it.
Hmm.
Yeah.
I've never,
I've had dreams that are lucid dreams,

1004
00:57:40.901 --> 00:57:42.920
but totally accidentally.
And uh,

1005
00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:46.150
one of the ways that I learned was one of those movies was whacking move.

1006
00:57:46.151 --> 00:57:46.961
He's like,
what the bleep?

1007
00:57:46.961 --> 00:57:50.080
Do we know one of those through the rabbit rabbit hole or something like that.

1008
00:57:50.081 --> 00:57:50.914
But,
uh,

1009
00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:54.580
the guy was talking about lucid dreams and he was saying that you have them all

1010
00:57:54.581 --> 00:57:56.260
the time.
You don't just don't realize you're having.
Um,

1011
00:57:56.590 --> 00:58:00.880
the one way to determine it is in your real life,
your conscious state,

1012
00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:05.470
when you walk through a doorway,
knock on the side of the door and say,

1013
00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:09.250
am I dreaming?
Like every time you walk through a doorway,
cool.
Am I dreaming?

1014
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:13.270
And because you do it consciously all the time,
if you do it all the time,

1015
00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:14.470
am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?

1016
00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:17.170
You're going to do it in your sleep and then your sleep,

1017
00:58:17.171 --> 00:58:20.470
you're going to get to the doorway and you gotta go am Mike Dreaming?
Oh my God,

1018
00:58:20.471 --> 00:58:22.600
I'm dreaming.
You're going to,
it's going to go right through it,

1019
00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:26.770
but you're going to stay awake.
I did it once,
just once.
I only did that once.

1020
00:58:26.771 --> 00:58:29.800
I never really,
most of the time I'm tired.
I'm like,
fuck,
I'm going to sleep.

1021
00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:31.630
You know?
I just don't know.
I don't deal.

1022
00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:35.980
But if you're one of those people that practices that on a daily basis,

1023
00:58:35.981 --> 00:58:39.730
apparently you can get really good at it and you can make all sorts of crazy

1024
00:58:39.731 --> 00:58:44.440
things happen and you live in like these wild sex orgy dreams where you could do

1025
00:58:44.441 --> 00:58:47.980
whatever you want.
You fly around,
you live in space,
she hang out with robots,

1026
00:58:48.010 --> 00:58:52.660
you do whatever the fuck you,
I want to get an an orgy with robots.

1027
00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:55.870
Well,
there's enough people talking about lucid dreaming and it's not bullshit.

1028
00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:58.090
I mean there's Freddy does it,
Freddy Lockhart,
doesn't he?
Yeah,

1029
00:58:58.091 --> 00:59:01.180
he reads all the books and he practices it all the time.
Hmm.

1030
00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:06.130
I remember talking to somebody years ago who said she could ask stroll project.

1031
00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:11.170
I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right.
A S T r a l squirt from the butt ass.

1032
00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:15.880
Yes.
She'd say,
excuse me,
I have to go astral project.

1033
00:59:15.881 --> 00:59:20.350
I'll be back in a couple minutes.
No.
Um,
this was a right word,

1034
00:59:20.370 --> 00:59:21.980
but maybe I've got it wrong.

1035
00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:24.980
<v 3>No,
she said she would go somewhere.
This astro in her head,</v>

1036
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:30.670
but like leave her physical body and she'd be above her body and go somewhere

1037
00:59:31.821 --> 00:59:35.450
else and be aware of it and then she could come back into her body.

1038
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:38.510
Was this while she was awake or sleeping?
Uh,
no.

1039
00:59:38.511 --> 00:59:41.870
I think it was while she was awake.
It's a phrenic.
Maybe that was it.

1040
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:45.710
<v 2>Probably similar as to a lucid dream.
You know,</v>

1041
00:59:45.711 --> 00:59:49.190
you're creating this artificial reality or maybe look,

1042
00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:53.120
you're seeing things right.
I mean,
just because you can't,
again,

1043
00:59:53.121 --> 00:59:55.570
put those things on a scale and weigh them and measure them.

1044
00:59:55.571 --> 00:59:57.500
It doesn't mean you're not having that actual experience.

1045
00:59:58.100 --> 00:59:59.510
So when you're closing your eyes,

1046
00:59:59.511 --> 01:00:02.450
you're meditating and you project yourself above your body,

1047
01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:04.920
who knows what the fuck is really going on?

1048
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:09.110
You obviously we think that you're just imagining shit and the shit that you're

1049
01:00:09.111 --> 01:00:10.910
imagining is not real,

1050
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:16.390
but it might very well be that we're just so enamored by the state of things

1051
01:00:17.031 --> 01:00:21.350
being solid that we don't think that unless you could touch something and feel

1052
01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:25.340
it and put it on a scale and measure with a tape ruler,
it's not real.

1053
01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:27.790
<v 3>I,
I'm interested in the concept too,</v>

1054
01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:32.620
that most things are a facade like we are,

1055
01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:36.790
we're enjoying or experiencing something that isn't there.

1056
01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:39.430
When we watch a football game on a big screen TV,

1057
01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.700
those football players aren't there.
They're at another location,

1058
01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:46.330
but we are experiencing it as if we were there.

1059
01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:50.830
You talked about the car and the fake,
the fake gauges.
You know,

1060
01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:55.690
you're looking at a facade and it's,
you get right down to human beings.

1061
01:00:55.691 --> 01:00:59.050
I mean we have the,
the skin and muscles and eyes,

1062
01:00:59.051 --> 01:01:04.051
but like right past that is this bizarre s skull and muscle thing.

1063
01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:06.820
So what is the real,
you know what I mean?

1064
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:09.100
We're looking at a facade that we're comfortable with,

1065
01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:13.810
but what is an inch beyond that?
It's a scary,
scary thing,

1066
01:01:14.050 --> 01:01:18.610
but I think we need facades that we can be comfortable with to be able to

1067
01:01:18.611 --> 01:01:21.100
experience life in a way that isn't scary.

1068
01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:25.390
<v 2>Yeah.
Like I think about you,
Brian Regan,
I know you,
I know your personality,</v>

1069
01:01:25.391 --> 01:01:30.330
but deep into your head there's this bunch of weird synapses that are firing

1070
01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:35.050
your life experiences is all like manifesting itself in your actions and your

1071
01:01:35.051 --> 01:01:39.820
behavior and this is a,
it's a very weird thing to be a person.
Very,

1072
01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:43.150
very weird thing.
Yeah,
but that's a really good way of looking at it.

1073
01:01:43.151 --> 01:01:44.830
It's like you're projecting it.

1074
01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:48.220
That's why weirds us out when whenever someone like does weird shit with their

1075
01:01:48.221 --> 01:01:49.330
face.
You know,

1076
01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:52.600
like when whenever someone gets their lips done or gets her cheeks puffed up

1077
01:01:52.601 --> 01:01:56.560
with that weird shit that they do,
man,
that freaks me out.

1078
01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:58.970
That freaks me out more than almost anything when it,

1079
01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:03.010
when it's people get stuff putting her face and nurture for like,
it's like,

1080
01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:05.680
what do you,
you know,
it's,
it's,
you're confusing me.
I can't,

1081
01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:10.510
I'm used to this certain facility.
It doesn't mind.
I don't mind aging.

1082
01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:14.200
I don't mind if it changes over time.
That all seemed normal.

1083
01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:19.360
When you start putting stuff in there and pumping things up and botoxing shit

1084
01:02:19.531 --> 01:02:20.010
and stuff

1085
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.050
<v 1>that weirds people out because it's like,
man,</v>

1086
01:02:22.051 --> 01:02:25.290
I'm missing the signals off fucking screw.
Where it's like,

1087
01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:30.320
if you can't have the normal facial reactions to express the proper emotions,

1088
01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.370
yeah.
The signals are getting all cross.
That is a weird one.

1089
01:02:35.371 --> 01:02:38.310
When they have the rubber in their face and their face doesn't move.
Right.

1090
01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:43.000
Like I remember we were at the Bray Improv and uh,

1091
01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.290
Joan Rivers rest,
her soul was on television two.

1092
01:02:46.291 --> 01:02:50.760
She had a reality show with her and her daughter and it was me and Joey and Ari

1093
01:02:50.761 --> 01:02:52.320
and we were barbecued.

1094
01:02:52.610 --> 01:02:57.130
We were way too high to be watching the Joan Rivers thing.
And,
um,

1095
01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:02.920
I was freaking out about our face and I was like looking at this weird frozen

1096
01:03:03.451 --> 01:03:06.540
Kabuki mask thing that is her,

1097
01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:11.130
her field of expression.
You know,
it was just very bizarre.

1098
01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:14.910
Like everything was like pushed up and filled in frozen.

1099
01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:19.440
It just wasn't moving right.
And it was like,
oh my God,
like you're,

1100
01:03:19.441 --> 01:03:24.320
it's way better to be old than to be that.
Well,
I,

1101
01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:29.010
I can test that in the sense that people want to do things to make themselves

1102
01:03:29.011 --> 01:03:31.650
feel better.
And sometimes they feel if they look better,

1103
01:03:31.651 --> 01:03:32.700
they're gonna feel better.

1104
01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:36.900
Nobody questioned somebody when they comb their hair or brush their hair or wear

1105
01:03:36.901 --> 01:03:41.550
contacts instead of glasses or shave their beard.
You know,
those,

1106
01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:45.590
those are things that,
you know,
could be considered a selfish and vain,

1107
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:50.910
but even your beard,
while,
I mean,
you know,
like trimming it.
I mean,
um,

1108
01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:52.230
you know,

1109
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:57.230
and some people will go to extra extremes and want to put stuff in their face

1110
01:03:57.331 --> 01:04:01.920
and it makes them feel better.
Um,
I agree with you.
It could look kind of strange,

1111
01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:06.840
but if it makes them feel better,
hey,
I,
you know,
free will.
Well,

1112
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:08.760
it's nice to feel better.
That's true.

1113
01:04:09.090 --> 01:04:13.050
But when you see someone and their face is no longer a human face,

1114
01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:17.910
it's like a weird mask,
a frozen mask that doesn't communicate right.

1115
01:04:18.330 --> 01:04:21.640
It's just,
it gives us,
it gives you a creepy feeling.
Like,
is it,
it can,

1116
01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:23.310
the signals are all wrong.

1117
01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:27.450
I'll give you talk to someone and you talk to like a really old person and

1118
01:04:27.451 --> 01:04:30.720
there's lines all over their face and you're talking to them.
You realize,
wow,

1119
01:04:30.721 --> 01:04:33.750
this guy has lived 90 years,
90 years on this planet.

1120
01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:35.130
Like you could see it in his face,

1121
01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:40.200
but if you talk to that same guy and he's just frozen mask with silicone on his

1122
01:04:40.201 --> 01:04:44.220
lips,
everything like it's fucking strange because you're not,

1123
01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:46.320
you're not getting in there,
you're not seeing it.
It's like,

1124
01:04:46.590 --> 01:04:50.460
it's like you're talking to him through a really thickly tinted window.

1125
01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:54.870
Like I could see there's a person in there and they're talking to me,

1126
01:04:54.871 --> 01:04:58.380
but I don't,
I'm not exactly sure what kind of expressions they're making.

1127
01:04:59.030 --> 01:05:00.600
You know that you know that weird.

1128
01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:05.040
There's a weird thing that people do when they shut off the expressions of their

1129
01:05:05.041 --> 01:05:09.120
face.
It doesn't,
it can't talk and moving around anymore.

1130
01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:14.020
You see someone,
they,
I'm like,
they're super well,
he's honest.

1131
01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:19.000
Is He fucked up his face and his face looks pretty,
worked on really well.

1132
01:05:19.001 --> 01:05:23.140
Maybe he's a old,
I mean it's not that.
I don't know.
He doesn't,
he doesn't.

1133
01:05:23.141 --> 01:05:26.580
Joan Rivers it.
Did you hear the,
the thing recently,
like uh,

1134
01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:30.730
this is like a day before the Oscars that uh,
he got,

1135
01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.510
he was at a gym at three in the morning and Hollywood and this guy was working

1136
01:05:34.511 --> 01:05:37.810
out and then to full just comes up and just like introduce us like,
hey,

1137
01:05:37.811 --> 01:05:39.400
how's it going?
And John,
how's it gone?

1138
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:42.710
It wasn't the week before how it was a long time ago.
Oh,
it was?
Yeah.

1139
01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:45.160
It was a store that went around.
It was like a non story.
It's like,

1140
01:05:45.161 --> 01:05:45.701
what did he do?

1141
01:05:45.701 --> 01:05:49.650
He said hi to a guy in the morning so we'll knows what he really did.
That guy,

1142
01:05:49.651 --> 01:05:51.280
it's,
we're taking that guy's word for it.

1143
01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.200
He's probably trying to get his dick sucked.
You're right.

1144
01:05:53.770 --> 01:05:56.950
Probably it's probably what he does,
you know,
three o'clock in the morning.

1145
01:05:56.951 --> 01:05:58.450
You never know.
Maybe it's like rest stops.

1146
01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:02.620
Like that's where gay dudes meet to try to hook it.
Equinox.
Yeah.
You never know.

1147
01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:05.830
You never know.
But so is that what the gist of the story was?

1148
01:06:05.831 --> 01:06:08.830
They were trying to hit on a guy and I said that it was really awkward because

1149
01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:11.380
at three in the morning this guys comes up to him and he like holds out his hand

1150
01:06:11.381 --> 01:06:14.070
and starts like introducing himself.
And the guy was like,
you know,

1151
01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.080
I felt when he was doing,
but I was,
well,
I read the story was,

1152
01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:20.240
I mean the guy was just saying that it was odd to talk to Jonathan,

1153
01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:23.380
but it's a non story.
The Guy said there was a guy said hi.

1154
01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:27.220
I mean it could be you.
Yeah.
Brian redband came into the fucking equinox,

1155
01:06:27.221 --> 01:06:31.370
three o'clock in the morning.
It was,
we're out to me.
And real strange,
you know.

1156
01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:35.350
Okay,
let's print a story.
Imagine if there's was a story.
It became a story.

1157
01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.450
Every time you said hi to someone at the gym.

1158
01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.230
<v 3>You know what it is?</v>

1159
01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:43.250
Every celebrity encounter is a story.

1160
01:06:43.251 --> 01:06:46.790
Not necessarily something that you know,
gets into the media.

1161
01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:52.180
But I remember living in New York and taking a train out to,

1162
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:55.460
uh,
chuckles and Mineola.
Yeah.

1163
01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:58.760
And they put you in a place where they put you in a cab.
You know,

1164
01:06:58.761 --> 01:07:03.050
it's like five people have to share a cab from the train station to the town.

1165
01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:07.640
So there's three people I guess.
So we're in the cab and the guy goes,

1166
01:07:07.641 --> 01:07:10.550
so where you had night?
And I said,
I'm going to chuckles.
And then,
oh,

1167
01:07:10.551 --> 01:07:13.190
you comedian.
Yeah.
You know,
you're gonna have that awkward conversation.

1168
01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:17.840
And so this cab driver says I had a rose,
um,

1169
01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:20.480
Roseanne Barr and the in the car.

1170
01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:25.960
And I remember driving by and she was looking out the window and she was

1171
01:07:26.151 --> 01:07:30.830
intrigued by a mailbox that she saw in front of one of the houses.

1172
01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:33.920
And you know,
so there's like a nothing story,

1173
01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:38.180
but I'm thinking Roseanne Barr doesn't remember the story,

1174
01:07:39.010 --> 01:07:42.800
but this guy,
that's his Rosanne.
Well Rosanne Arnold now,

1175
01:07:42.801 --> 01:07:44.690
but I mean that's his story.

1176
01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:49.550
So like if anybody gets into an elevator with a celebrity,

1177
01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:50.061
they,

1178
01:07:50.061 --> 01:07:55.061
they will tell that story for the rest of their life that the celebrity's not

1179
01:07:55.311 --> 01:07:58.010
going to remember that particular elevator ride.

1180
01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:02.270
But if you happen to be in an elevator one time in your life with Paul Newman,

1181
01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:06.470
anytime that's Paul Newman's mentioned your,
that's your story.

1182
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.380
And it's weird that every,

1183
01:08:09.381 --> 01:08:13.400
every encounter is a story to somebody.
A story

1184
01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:16.490
<v 1>that I talked about on the podcast because it in an elevator,</v>

1185
01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:18.860
<v 2>we,
me and my friend Eddie,</v>

1186
01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:22.370
we're in an elevator and some guy was in the elevator and apparently when the

1187
01:08:22.371 --> 01:08:26.390
guy left the elevator,
he said,
take it easy or something like that.

1188
01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:30.860
And we didn't respond,
you know,
or if he did respond,
he didn't hear me.

1189
01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:31.723
I don't know what happened,

1190
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:36.970
but he wrote this long crazy post on this message board about what a Douche bag

1191
01:08:36.981 --> 01:08:40.160
I am,
Dan.
I mean,
I literally,
I mean it was like,
Hey,
what's up?

1192
01:08:40.161 --> 01:08:43.670
So getting the elevator and the guy left and uh,
you know,

1193
01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:46.640
and I thought that was it.
There was a guy in an elevator and that's it.

1194
01:08:46.641 --> 01:08:50.000
But in his mind he was slighted like in some strange way,

1195
01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:52.620
which is if someone says hi to me,
I always say hi,
I'm,

1196
01:08:52.621 --> 01:08:56.990
I'm not the type of person that says take it easy.
I'll say,
yeah,
take it easy.

1197
01:08:56.990 --> 01:09:00.690
You know,
always,
always trying to be cordial.
I'm just not that guy.
Right.

1198
01:09:00.790 --> 01:09:05.790
So reading that this like artificial creation in this guy's mind,

1199
01:09:05.871 --> 01:09:10.130
like any apologize for it.
Then it got really weird like,
you know,
like people,

1200
01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:14.740
he got called out on it and so that you,
you responded in a way and then he,

1201
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:18.070
and then he dies.
But it was a message board that I go to.
So it was like,

1202
01:09:18.071 --> 01:09:20.240
it's really strange.
I was like,
what are you talking about?

1203
01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:23.540
And so then he backed off of it and apologized and said he was just insecure.

1204
01:09:23.541 --> 01:09:27.260
It was like,
it was very,
very,
very fucking strange.

1205
01:09:27.261 --> 01:09:32.261
But to see someone just create this artificial version of an encounter and in

1206
01:09:32.391 --> 01:09:34.040
their mind,
I mean his mind,
who knows?

1207
01:09:34.041 --> 01:09:36.890
I mean I don't know what issues this guy had.
Obviously he has some,

1208
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:39.200
otherwise he wouldn't have ever made a post like that.

1209
01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.770
Even if you had slighted him.
Why is that?

1210
01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:46.880
W W w what's the big deal to him and the rest of his existence?

1211
01:09:46.930 --> 01:09:49.910
And if it was a satellite,
I mean,
I mean it wasn't,

1212
01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:54.160
but in his version of a slight,
it was as minor as it gets.
Yeah,

1213
01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:59.000
like take it easy.
No one says anything back.
That's it.
And this fucking diatribe,

1214
01:09:59.001 --> 01:10:03.920
I mean several paragraphs of bile like spewed by this guy,

1215
01:10:03.921 --> 01:10:05.960
but in some people's minds,

1216
01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:11.290
like these encounters like you talking to Roseanne Barr about a fucking mailbox,

1217
01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:15.220
like it's sedan.
Roseanne Barr Shits on people's mailboxes.

1218
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:18.530
Like what kind of mailbox you got ballet,
are you fucking cunt?

1219
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:22.160
Like full whatever.
What kinds of strange mailbox?

1220
01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:24.420
Maybe she's just trying to make small talk.
You fucking know.

1221
01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:28.430
He wasn't saying it negatively was just saying that that was what his encounter

1222
01:10:28.431 --> 01:10:30.710
was.
So that was his story.
But it could be negative.

1223
01:10:30.711 --> 01:10:33.020
I mean there's a lot of those.
I've had conversations with people.

1224
01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:36.950
I always get in when I get in Limos,
I always ask,
who's the biggest shit?

1225
01:10:36.951 --> 01:10:41.951
Had you ever had to drive around a few people where we've done that a bunch of

1226
01:10:43.371 --> 01:10:47.620
times and we hear that,
hmm.
Can't believe it's him again,
can fire.
Yeah.

1227
01:10:48.230 --> 01:10:51.620
There's definitely that.
Everybody,
everybody should get one pass.

1228
01:10:51.621 --> 01:10:52.011
You know what I mean?

1229
01:10:52.011 --> 01:10:54.380
Like everybody's going to have a bad thing or something that's confused,

1230
01:10:54.381 --> 01:10:58.130
but if it's a recurring thing,
then there's probably some truth to it.
Absolutely.

1231
01:10:58.131 --> 01:11:02.390
That wasn't an elevator one time with a guy and he recognized me as a comedian

1232
01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:06.470
and he wanted to do one of my bits to me,

1233
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:10.630
but he got it wrong.
And the bit was just old bid.

1234
01:11:10.670 --> 01:11:14.220
I used to do about saying youtube at the wrong time,
getting out of a cab

1235
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:17.580
<v 3>at the airport and the driver goes,
have a nice flight and you go,
you toe.
So,</v>

1236
01:11:17.581 --> 01:11:21.570
so that's the bit,
so I'm in the elevator with them,
this guy,
and he goes,
oh,

1237
01:11:21.571 --> 01:11:24.280
you're not a comedian,
right?
And said,
yeah,
yeah.
How are you doing?
You know,

1238
01:11:24.281 --> 01:11:27.150
when he goes,
you're the guide,
it says,
and you all the time.

1239
01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:32.700
So I'm not going to call him out on it.
I'm honored,
even knows who I am,

1240
01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:36.180
so I'm not going to embarrass him.
I said,
yeah,
that's me.
That's me.
And he goes,

1241
01:11:36.181 --> 01:11:40.290
yeah.
He goes,
I do not all the time.
I'm always saying,
and you at the wrong time.

1242
01:11:40.291 --> 01:11:42.060
And now I'm like,
no,
I shouldn't.
I should have.
Correct.

1243
01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:45.190
<v 6>Did
you know what I mean?
And he goes,
yeah,</v>

1244
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:47.560
there's probably not a day goes by that I don't know.

1245
01:11:47.730 --> 01:11:51.330
<v 3>And,
and you,
and I'm thinking this is getting off the tracks.</v>

1246
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:54.180
So the elevator door opens,

1247
01:11:54.181 --> 01:11:57.840
it's in a casino with a bunch of people and we walk off the elevator,

1248
01:11:57.841 --> 01:12:02.280
I'm going one way and he goes the other way.
So he starts yelling to me thinking,

1249
01:12:02.281 --> 01:12:02.971
it's going to be funny.

1250
01:12:02.971 --> 01:12:07.800
What he thinks is my bit in a casino now with hundreds of people and he's going

1251
01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:12.540
and Yo and Yo,
oh God.
And I'm thinking,

1252
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:18.090
I'm the only guy here who knows what this guy's talking about and I don't know

1253
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:22.970
<v 2>what he's talking about.
It was very,</v>

1254
01:12:22.971 --> 01:12:25.490
very straight.
You could run into people,
man,

1255
01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.800
and just use zig when you should have zagged,

1256
01:12:27.801 --> 01:12:31.460
and you run into someone who's completely out of their fucking mind and then

1257
01:12:31.461 --> 01:12:33.890
they become a part of your life.
I mean,
that can happen.

1258
01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:37.520
You could definitely run into the wrong people,
especially if a girl,

1259
01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:40.580
especially if you're single,
he just,
for whatever reason,

1260
01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:43.490
start talking to someone and it turns out that they're fucking crazy.

1261
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:48.170
And then you,
you know,
that's a problem with men.
Men are willing to,

1262
01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:51.080
we're willing to look past a lot of shit if a chick's hot.
I'm like,

1263
01:12:51.081 --> 01:12:54.350
I know a lot of guys that have got involved with girls that are just completely

1264
01:12:54.351 --> 01:12:58.460
out of their fucking mind,
but they're pretty,
and they're just like,
oh,
you know,

1265
01:12:58.590 --> 01:13:02.690
she's a little weird,
but not,
no,
no.
She was a guy.
It would be running from her.

1266
01:13:02.710 --> 01:13:07.250
And you imagine if that was a gal and would she be,

1267
01:13:07.251 --> 01:13:08.450
she had giant tits.

1268
01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:12.810
<v 6>Yeah,
I'd be running back to answer.
Exactly.
Yeah.
That's me.
I'm that guy.</v>

1269
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:17.290
Hey Man,
let's do it up.

1270
01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:20.810
<v 2>You'd take it to a restaurant.
She's yelling out and you,</v>

1271
01:13:21.490 --> 01:13:26.490
and you then when she sees your act and then like she sees an old recording and

1272
01:13:26.881 --> 01:13:28.780
she sees that bitch,
he goes,
oh fuck.

1273
01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.390
<v 6>Tell me you had me making an asshole.</v>

1274
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:37.050
You fucking selfish BZ shit.
Brian,

1275
01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:40.830
are you doing it like during the wedding vows?
And she says,
Hey,
and you,

1276
01:13:40.831 --> 01:13:42.560
and you go,
all right,
I gotta tell Ya.

1277
01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:49.720
<v 2>Oh,
people that you meet in this wacky life,</v>

1278
01:13:50.290 --> 01:13:54.260
I've got to think the people you meet living in Vegas is a,
well,

1279
01:13:54.261 --> 01:13:56.890
you're in Henderson,
right?
I don't want to tell you where you're not too late.

1280
01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:59.350
I'm not,
I'm not there.
Beautiful.

1281
01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:04.010
You're in one of those suburban towns outside of the Vegas and uh,

1282
01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:05.020
you're actually further than that.

1283
01:14:05.050 --> 01:14:07.880
You were like deep in the woods in the secret underground compound.

1284
01:14:07.890 --> 01:14:12.100
It's can't discuss.
But the point being that like,
you're,
you're in a real

1285
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:16.900
<v 3>normal town that just happens to be next to the death star.
Like you're like,</v>

1286
01:14:16.901 --> 01:14:21.130
you're like in the vicinity of the death star.
Like you could probably drive,

1287
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:24.340
you can get to the strip in a reasonable amount of time,

1288
01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.200
but the people that you live with,

1289
01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:30.430
they like affected at all by the fact that they live in Vegas or do they seem

1290
01:14:30.431 --> 01:14:32.800
like regular folks in a regular town?
Well,

1291
01:14:32.801 --> 01:14:36.250
I used to live in a house in a cul de sac and so there was more interaction with

1292
01:14:36.251 --> 01:14:39.730
the neighbors and now I live in one of those,
uh,
you know,
condo kind of deal.

1293
01:14:39.731 --> 01:14:42.850
So I now I have less interaction with the other people in the Condo,

1294
01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:45.190
but in the cul de sac,
you know,
um,

1295
01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:51.270
one thing I liked the things I liked about it and didn't like about the neighbor

1296
01:14:51.371 --> 01:14:52.630
thing.
One,

1297
01:14:52.650 --> 01:14:56.680
I'm not a kind of guy that just wants to have a conversation when somebody else

1298
01:14:56.681 --> 01:14:58.060
feels like having a conversation.

1299
01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:03.070
I just felt weird about pulling up into the driveway and then Joe blow wants to

1300
01:15:03.071 --> 01:15:07.600
just walk up and to start talking about the water pump or something that has to

1301
01:15:07.601 --> 01:15:10.120
do with the Culdesac or even small talk.
It's like,
well,

1302
01:15:10.121 --> 01:15:11.110
I don't want to do that right now.

1303
01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:14.570
But one thing I did like about it is because it,

1304
01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:20.160
it was so non show busy and I've got a lot of friends in show business and I

1305
01:15:20.411 --> 01:15:23.980
love him and of course they're going to be interested in their careers and

1306
01:15:23.981 --> 01:15:27.760
that's what people are going to tend to talk about.
When I lived in La,

1307
01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:32.620
there was just a disproportionate amount of conversations about auditions that

1308
01:15:32.621 --> 01:15:36.670
people went to and what they're up for and how they feel about an agent or this

1309
01:15:36.671 --> 01:15:40.690
or that.
And that's okay.
But it's nice to be away from that.

1310
01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:44.230
And one thing I loved about this just very suburban kind of cold,

1311
01:15:44.231 --> 01:15:49.090
the sac and Las Vegas was,
you know,
I'd come back from the road,
right?

1312
01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:49.751
So I'm just,

1313
01:15:49.751 --> 01:15:54.751
I'm doing comedy and I'm doing show business and I come back from the road and

1314
01:15:54.821 --> 01:15:59.170
there's neighbor kids riding their bikes in the cul de sac and the dad's saying,

1315
01:15:59.171 --> 01:16:03.520
yeah,
I put her bike together yesterday and it's just very real.

1316
01:16:03.970 --> 01:16:04.930
And I liked,

1317
01:16:05.650 --> 01:16:10.650
I liked having this show Biz life balanced with the real grounded kind of world.

1318
01:16:12.131 --> 01:16:16.960
We're not,
everything is about,
you know,
furthering careers and stuff.
Yeah.

1319
01:16:16.961 --> 01:16:17.441
That's a,

1320
01:16:17.441 --> 01:16:22.270
that's a big thing that a lot of people experience about any sort of environment

1321
01:16:22.271 --> 01:16:27.100
like Hollywood where it's just so based on one industry and he just gets so

1322
01:16:27.101 --> 01:16:31.350
wrapped up in that world that it's exhausting.
I,
when I was living in Las Vegas,

1323
01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.760
I've been in Las Vegas over 10 years now and uh,

1324
01:16:33.761 --> 01:16:36.970
I was out here doing something and I met a guy on the street.

1325
01:16:37.670 --> 01:16:41.440
I didn't know who he was,
but he was a comedian and said,
uh,
hey man,

1326
01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:46.180
he knew who I was.
And um,
so I said,
hey,
how's it going?
And he said,

1327
01:16:46.690 --> 01:16:50.570
well,
I've got an audition for this.
I got it.
And he started telling me things.
He,

1328
01:16:50.610 --> 01:16:54.370
he was up to Showbiz wise.
And I'm thinking,

1329
01:16:54.371 --> 01:16:57.760
that's not what I meant by how are you dealing,
right.
I meant like,
you know,

1330
01:16:57.790 --> 01:17:01.750
how are things that you feel like there's a guy that I won't name but I can't

1331
01:17:01.751 --> 01:17:03.970
talk to them anymore because every time I talked to him that happens.

1332
01:17:03.971 --> 01:17:06.880
I ran into him.
We were both working in the same venue.
Uh,

1333
01:17:06.881 --> 01:17:10.100
he was doing the really show.
I was doing late show and uh,
I ran

1334
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:13.960
<v 2>into him and I said,
hey man,
what's up?
Well,
I've got a Bolo,
blah,
blah,
blah,</v>

1335
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.080
deal with a bubble.
I mean,
it just starts reading a resume.

1336
01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:19.500
He starts reading off this deal that he's gone,

1337
01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:23.360
his backup deal that he's got and his,
I mean,
he went on for several minutes.

1338
01:17:23.361 --> 01:17:28.120
It was fucking exhausting and I went,
good to see you're doing well.

1339
01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:32.450
Yeah,
well I took a deep breath and I looked like,
I don't know what to say.

1340
01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:35.780
Like I was stuck in this fucking hallway talking to this guy.

1341
01:17:35.781 --> 01:17:37.460
There was no way to get out.
It was no one there,

1342
01:17:37.461 --> 01:17:42.080
but me and him and he just rattles off this fucking crazy resume.

1343
01:17:42.081 --> 01:17:46.760
A bullshit.
Just nonsense.
That by the way,
never happened.
None of it happened.

1344
01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:49.550
I mean,
here we are years later and none of those things took place.

1345
01:17:49.551 --> 01:17:52.400
But he was telling me they didn't have backup deal and this sitcom,

1346
01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:56.610
if this didn't go,
he has a backup deal.
They're going to pay him.
Some mom,
mom,

1347
01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:00.890
mom,
mom,
mom,
mom,
mom,
mom.
It was just nonsense.
Just,

1348
01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:04.100
but that happens.
Never had a backup deal,
man.
I don't want to,

1349
01:18:04.101 --> 01:18:05.510
I don't want to get where I'm,
I'm,

1350
01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:09.440
I'm in that place where I have a deal and a backup deal.
Yeah.

1351
01:18:09.441 --> 01:18:12.480
I guess I have a deal.
I don't even think he had a backup too.

1352
01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:16.350
I think he's just a,
I don't even think he's a bullshit artist.
I think,
you know,

1353
01:18:16.351 --> 01:18:18.380
it's just what he wanted,
what he wanted.

1354
01:18:18.381 --> 01:18:20.570
So he's just like telling me that he's doing great.

1355
01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:23.030
There's some people they run into you,
you know,

1356
01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:27.890
you run into a certain guys and you want to prove to them that you're doing
well.

1357
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.520
You know,
like they maybe have some weird thing about them.
Like they go,
oh,

1358
01:18:31.521 --> 01:18:35.600
this ties doing better than me.
I'm going to tell him I'm doing awesome.

1359
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:39.140
I'm going to let him know right away that we on even ground.

1360
01:18:39.530 --> 01:18:43.250
So that's where this,
you know,
if he was running into some open Miker,
you know,

1361
01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:45.470
and say,
hey man,
how you doing?
He'd be like,
yeah,
good.
How are you doing?

1362
01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.320
Like that would be normal because he would already feel like he has the

1363
01:18:48.321 --> 01:18:49.154
advantage.
Right.

1364
01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:53.150
<v 3>And I know I'm guilty of having,
I don't,
I don't know.</v>

1365
01:18:53.151 --> 01:18:54.440
There are times when I think,
you know,

1366
01:18:54.450 --> 01:18:57.260
I have the proper amount of just low key thing,

1367
01:18:57.650 --> 01:18:59.540
but I know there's a little piece of me,

1368
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:04.840
that little ego part of me that that needs to participate,
you know,
it,
it,

1369
01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:09.860
it like comes out of me sometimes if like if somebody has the wrong idea of

1370
01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:14.560
maybe what I've been able to do as a comedian.
Right.
You know,

1371
01:19:14.570 --> 01:19:16.800
like you meet somebody at a party or something and,
and I,

1372
01:19:16.801 --> 01:19:20.390
I'll never say what I do unless him point blank asked and I'll go,

1373
01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:25.360
what do you do?
And so then now I'm going to be honest as I'm a comedian and,

1374
01:19:26.050 --> 01:19:29.030
and they go,
oh you do like open mic nights and stuff like that.

1375
01:19:29.031 --> 01:19:33.470
Is that what you do?
And then that little ego part of me is like,
now how do I,

1376
01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:37.400
how do I reply to this?
Yeah.
This guy,

1377
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:42.200
this person has the wrong idea of where I,
what I do,

1378
01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:44.690
you know,
or where I'm at.
But you can't be braggy,

1379
01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:47.150
but you don't want to be braggy,
you know?
So,

1380
01:19:47.151 --> 01:19:50.400
so what at what level do you answer a question like that?
You know,
just like,

1381
01:19:50.410 --> 01:19:52.490
do I,
do I just say no,

1382
01:19:52.491 --> 01:19:57.140
I don't do open Mike Nights and let it go with that or do I,
you know,

1383
01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.550
throw something out there that

1384
01:19:59.690 --> 01:20:04.070
<v 2>I used to,
you could say,
maybe I used to do open Mike Nights.
There you go.
Yeah.</v>

1385
01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:07.700
I had this guy running.
I ran into this guy at a fucking gun store for,

1386
01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:12.780
<v 1>you know,
at all places.
And,
um,
the first words that I said,</v>

1387
01:20:12.781 --> 01:20:17.640
this guy never met him before.
First words,
he goes,
Hey,
uh,
you're,
uh,

1388
01:20:17.641 --> 01:20:21.450
you're Joe Rogan,
right?
I go,
yeah.
He goes,
how's your career doing?

1389
01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:27.990
That's his first words.
I go,
I goes,
good.
He goes,

1390
01:20:27.991 --> 01:20:31.800
you're not doing that fear factor Shell,
Huh?
Like,
puts them in a defensive.
I go,

1391
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:34.980
nope.
And he goes,
top business,
good luck.

1392
01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:40.980
I'm like,
whoa.
Like,
but it was so douchey the way he was doing it.

1393
01:20:40.981 --> 01:20:45.410
It was so douchey.
But those are the only words I said.
I'm like,
all right.
I like,

1394
01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:48.470
like literally it ended right there.
I was,
I was high.

1395
01:20:48.630 --> 01:20:50.850
I was under the influence of the sacred plant at the time,

1396
01:20:50.851 --> 01:20:52.260
but it allowed me to relax more.

1397
01:20:52.261 --> 01:20:55.160
But it was like I wasn't going to get in an argument with the guy about it or,

1398
01:20:55.170 --> 01:20:59.890
or correct him,
but it was taken a back by how has your career,
well,

1399
01:21:00.010 --> 01:21:02.340
are the first words out of his mouth.
You could have said,

1400
01:21:02.341 --> 01:21:05.260
well you just said my name.
Yeah.

1401
01:21:05.330 --> 01:21:07.590
So obviously you know who I am,

1402
01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:10.710
but he's trying to paint me as a has been.

1403
01:21:11.670 --> 01:21:15.150
There's people that will do that to you.
They try to paint you as a has been,
hey,

1404
01:21:15.151 --> 01:21:17.610
you should like a guy did it to me at cvs once.

1405
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:21.120
A guy that it's working behind the counter at cvs is this guys,

1406
01:21:21.121 --> 01:21:23.430
I don't know what country he's from,
but he's super,

1407
01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:27.810
he doesn't work there anymore,
but he was like super like agro.
He's like this,

1408
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:31.350
this fucking face like,
and he goes,
hey,
you don't have that show anymore?

1409
01:21:31.890 --> 01:21:35.700
Like that's the words he said.
Wow.
And I go,
what?
You know,
I'm like,

1410
01:21:35.710 --> 01:21:38.580
if you don't have that show anymore,
Huh?
And I go,
no,

1411
01:21:38.581 --> 01:21:41.130
I don't have that show anymore.
I also don't work at CVS.

1412
01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.560
I fucking idiot.
Like,
what are you talking to?

1413
01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:47.850
I can leave anytime I want motherfucker.
You got to stay until your shifts over.

1414
01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:50.460
I had a what a Dick.

1415
01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:54.360
Like how much could you possibly make it CBS that you want to get shitty with

1416
01:21:54.361 --> 01:21:56.970
someone who comes in that used to be on a TV show?
Like he just,

1417
01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:00.030
the way he was saying it was just trying to put me on the defensive,

1418
01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:02.460
like make me feel bad,
but could,
he didn't,

1419
01:22:02.461 --> 01:22:05.880
but he didn't think it out much like you probably didn't think his life out,

1420
01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:11.060
which is why he was the fucking late night guy at cvs workers because a lot of,

1421
01:22:11.891 --> 01:22:16.860
uh,
I'm fortunate in that my,
the people that come out to see my show,

1422
01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:19.290
they're,
they're pretty cool people,
man.
You know,

1423
01:22:19.291 --> 01:22:21.900
I like meeting them after the show and they're nice people,
you know,

1424
01:22:21.901 --> 01:22:24.630
so I have no complaints there,

1425
01:22:24.631 --> 01:22:28.670
but every once in a while you're going to get a curve ball.
And I was working at,

1426
01:22:28.671 --> 01:22:29.504
uh,

1427
01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:34.550
the Improv down in Irvine and I remember I had a pretty strong set,

1428
01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:35.611
felt pretty good.

1429
01:22:35.611 --> 01:22:40.611
I walked off stage and this guy like walks like just beelined it back to me who

1430
01:22:41.491 --> 01:22:44.160
was in the middle of the audience.
And I felt okay,
I just,

1431
01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:46.340
I just made people laugh for an hour,
you know,

1432
01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:49.830
it felt like I did my job and he goes,
hey,

1433
01:22:50.370 --> 01:22:54.240
didn't I see you bomb on our scenario?
Like 10 years ago?

1434
01:22:55.660 --> 01:23:00.390
I was just like,
um,
yeah.
Yeah.
I had a rough one.

1435
01:23:01.090 --> 01:23:05.650
Did you see tonight show
we're in the middle of tonight.

1436
01:23:05.651 --> 01:23:09.880
I just did an hour tonight.
We're not talking about that.

1437
01:23:10.090 --> 01:23:13.940
We're talking about 10 years ago.
Yeah.
The people want to make you feel bad,

1438
01:23:13.941 --> 01:23:17.080
rough,
set,
pause.
People see you,
you know,
like,
oh,

1439
01:23:17.081 --> 01:23:18.550
this guy thinks he's something special.

1440
01:23:18.551 --> 01:23:21.250
I'm going to let him know I'm going to knock him down a peg.

1441
01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:26.150
I saw money wasn't at its best psalm in that weird environment of the,

1442
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:30.160
those shows doing stand up on one of those fucking shows is so brutal.

1443
01:23:30.370 --> 01:23:33.490
It's so hard to,
first of all,
um,
I don't know,

1444
01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:36.070
like if you feel comfortable doing like a real short set,

1445
01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:39.580
but I always feel real weird when I would do five minutes,
like five minutes.

1446
01:23:39.581 --> 01:23:43.330
To me it's like I don't,
that's,
I have long bits,
like five minutes.

1447
01:23:43.331 --> 01:23:47.920
To me it's just exploring a premise.
It's a whole different animal.
I,
you know,
I,

1448
01:23:47.921 --> 01:23:51.820
uh,
I like the challenge of it,
but it's,

1449
01:23:51.850 --> 01:23:54.400
it's so different from doing an hour set,

1450
01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:57.820
especially in our set in front of people who,
you know,
are,

1451
01:23:57.821 --> 01:24:00.250
they're there to see what you do.
Yeah.
Um,

1452
01:24:01.090 --> 01:24:03.190
but if I do Letterman or something like that,

1453
01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:07.510
I'm walking out to a group of people who have no clue who I am.

1454
01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:11.020
Maybe a handful of people in the audience too.
But for the most part it's like,

1455
01:24:11.170 --> 01:24:13.060
you know,
here's a comedian and a,

1456
01:24:13.061 --> 01:24:18.061
you're walking out and on Letterman you get four and a half minutes and uh,

1457
01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:24.100
you know,
it,
it,
it's a very,
very challenging thing to yeah.

1458
01:24:24.101 --> 01:24:28.780
I describe it to people as people think of comedy as knocking down the pins.

1459
01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:32.240
Well the hard part is setting up the pins.
There's no pin set up.

1460
01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:34.630
You're walking out to nothing,

1461
01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:39.940
walking out to nothing and you have to set up pins quickly and then knock them

1462
01:24:40.481 --> 01:24:44.740
down.
Yeah.
And people don't realize that that's part of the art form.

1463
01:24:44.741 --> 01:24:49.700
And part of the challenge,
um,
is coming out to nothing.
It's white.

1464
01:24:49.701 --> 01:24:54.701
So Virgin Snow and you have to quickly talk about something and set up something

1465
01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:00.250
and then start getting people into that.

1466
01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:03.940
And it's a lot more challenging than people might think.

1467
01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:09.030
It's one of the harder jobs in as far as standup goes is doing a talk show set.

1468
01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:14.650
It's one of them harder gigs.
It's like opening up because like when you,

1469
01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:18.070
when you go on stage cold and there's no one who warms up the crowd before you,

1470
01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:21.940
you have to get everybody into the mindset.
There's like,

1471
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:23.590
there's a thing going on.

1472
01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:27.100
The way I describe it is it's like almost like a mass hypnosis.

1473
01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:30.280
Like when I'm watching a Brian Regan show,
when you're killing,

1474
01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:34.300
I'm thinking the way you're thinking.
I'm not thinking in my mind like,
man,

1475
01:25:34.301 --> 01:25:36.970
he's doing,
like if I was in my own head,
I was like,
man,

1476
01:25:36.971 --> 01:25:39.670
I don't like the way he dresses.
This guy's fucking walks weird.

1477
01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:41.380
Do you know what I mean?
Like if you have like date,

1478
01:25:41.381 --> 01:25:45.190
you're going to get out of that the mindset,
right?
When when a guy's killing,

1479
01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:48.760
when you're up there and you're letting it loose and everything's flowing,

1480
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.090
I'm thinking like you,

1481
01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:55.460
I'm allowing you to sort of control where my thoughts go and you're surprising

1482
01:25:56.411 --> 01:25:57.790
me with your statements.

1483
01:25:57.791 --> 01:26:02.020
And those surprises are often really funny and that's how you kind of get comedy

1484
01:26:02.021 --> 01:26:04.160
going.
But when you're just

1485
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:07.700
<v 3>starting out like ready go and you're doing four minutes,</v>

1486
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:11.150
you don't get a chance to hypnotize anybody.

1487
01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:16.160
You just kinda got to hope that they're kind and they're receptive and then
they,

1488
01:26:16.161 --> 01:26:16.411
they,

1489
01:26:16.411 --> 01:26:21.411
they think that your first few words are reasonable enough to allow you a

1490
01:26:21.861 --> 01:26:25.520
certain amount of access to their,
their,
their funny thought.

1491
01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:28.340
I remember somebody years ago,
and I wish I could remember who it was,

1492
01:26:28.580 --> 01:26:30.380
this was before I had ever done a TV set,

1493
01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:33.710
say that you have to get it into your head that the first joke is going to be a

1494
01:26:33.711 --> 01:26:37.370
foul ball and don't let it throw you because you're not going to get the

1495
01:26:37.371 --> 01:26:41.060
reaction that you get in front of your fans,
your first set and a TV,

1496
01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:44.930
your first joke and a TV audience,
they don't know you.
They're,
they'll go,

1497
01:26:44.931 --> 01:26:46.970
who is this guy?
You know,
they're usually trying to be friendly.
They,

1498
01:26:46.971 --> 01:26:47.990
they want to like you.

1499
01:26:48.410 --> 01:26:53.410
So your first joke is there absolute first clue of how you think as a comedian.

1500
01:26:54.171 --> 01:26:58.160
So they're not going to be all in yet.
So it's,
it might get a laugh,

1501
01:26:58.161 --> 01:27:01.130
but it might not get the laugh that you're used to it getting,

1502
01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:05.690
but you have to understand that and go,
I know this first one is a foul ball.

1503
01:27:05.691 --> 01:27:09.830
It's just going to go off and if it does get a bigger laugh,
okay,
that's a bonus.

1504
01:27:09.831 --> 01:27:10.664
Now I can ride it.

1505
01:27:10.670 --> 01:27:15.670
But I think it's best to go out there assuming that it might get nothing or,

1506
01:27:16.370 --> 01:27:20.840
or a little laugh because if you go out there thinking this is going to kill and

1507
01:27:20.841 --> 01:27:24.080
it doesn't,
it could throw you for the whole set.
Yeah,
I've seen that.

1508
01:27:24.081 --> 01:27:25.520
I've seen that in regular shows.

1509
01:27:25.521 --> 01:27:30.200
I've seen guys go out there that never have opened up before or haven't done in

1510
01:27:30.201 --> 01:27:32.930
a long time,
and they'll go out and try to rush it.

1511
01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:37.160
They'll try to rush the first joke like before,
like settle down folks,
what's up?

1512
01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:39.290
How's everybody doing?
Thanks for coming out tonight.

1513
01:27:39.650 --> 01:27:41.600
They just immediately go into a bet,
right?

1514
01:27:41.601 --> 01:27:43.520
When you immediately go into a bit and it doesn't work,

1515
01:27:43.521 --> 01:27:46.830
then you're like undefensive motor tailspin mode and you're trying to cover.

1516
01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.450
I,
I've,
you know,
I'm,

1517
01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:54.980
it's a constant quest to try to figure out how to learn how to do comedy both in

1518
01:27:54.981 --> 01:27:58.610
front of fans or in front of TV audiences and stuff like that.

1519
01:27:58.910 --> 01:28:01.580
And that's one thing I love about it is that you're always learning.

1520
01:28:01.581 --> 01:28:05.210
You're always learning.
Sometimes you can prepare too much,

1521
01:28:05.211 --> 01:28:09.230
sometimes you can prepare too little.
It's like a,
it's a never ending process.

1522
01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:12.590
I think it would be a mistake to get to the point where we go,
oh,
okay,

1523
01:28:12.591 --> 01:28:15.200
I got this figured out.
Yeah.
I don't ever want to feel like that.

1524
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:20.140
I want to feel like I'm learning every time I hit the stage.
And,
um,

1525
01:28:20.210 --> 01:28:24.450
that's one of those things that's a blast about doing like a,

1526
01:28:24.730 --> 01:28:26.720
a TV set.
You know,
I,

1527
01:28:26.721 --> 01:28:30.200
I've kind of learned over the years after the foul ball,

1528
01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:36.620
it's,
uh,
it's,
it's,
it's animals,
man.
It's like you have to let that audience,
no,

1529
01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:40.690
you are comfortable.
You got to let them know,
smell your weakness.
Gas,

1530
01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:44.420
you've got to let them know I got this.
And um,

1531
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:48.950
and it's a cool feeling because that's the moment where you're either going to

1532
01:28:48.951 --> 01:28:52.970
go south or you're going to get them.
You know what I mean?
And,
uh,
it's a fun,

1533
01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:56.240
I dunno.
It's fun.
It's,
it's like hunting,
I guess.
You know what I mean?
No,

1534
01:28:56.241 --> 01:28:59.240
I love it.
I love it too.
The same for the same reason because it's,

1535
01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:02.700
it's constantly challenging.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1536
01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:05.230
<v 2>You never know.
You never have it down.
You just don't,
you know,</v>

1537
01:29:05.231 --> 01:29:08.140
you have it good enough and he can go out there.
Like,
I'm confident.

1538
01:29:08.141 --> 01:29:11.680
Like I did some shows this weekend in Portland.
Every show was fucking amazing.

1539
01:29:11.681 --> 01:29:15.450
Great crowd had a great time.
But before every show,
I'm going over my notes,

1540
01:29:15.451 --> 01:29:17.020
I'm thinking about what bits I want to do.

1541
01:29:17.021 --> 01:29:20.140
I'm tweaking this and tweaking that and I'm getting in the ring.
You can't,

1542
01:29:20.530 --> 01:29:24.370
you can't disrespect it.
You know,
you can't ever get cocky.

1543
01:29:24.371 --> 01:29:26.380
You can't ever think that,
you know,

1544
01:29:26.381 --> 01:29:31.150
for whatever reason that there's the learning processes over,
it's never over.

1545
01:29:31.450 --> 01:29:33.550
Especially when you're constantly creating new material,

1546
01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:36.820
then it's really never over.
Like I did a special November,

1547
01:29:36.821 --> 01:29:41.230
abandoned all the material once it was done,
once it was on TV,
I'm done.

1548
01:29:41.530 --> 01:29:46.450
Now I have a whole new fucking hour I have to hone and sharpen and add to.

1549
01:29:46.451 --> 01:29:48.580
And that's always terrifying.

1550
01:29:48.610 --> 01:29:53.020
It's always terrifying when you trying out new shit and adding new shit to it

1551
01:29:53.021 --> 01:29:56.500
and tweaking it and changing it.
But that's what's exciting about it.

1552
01:29:56.501 --> 01:29:57.730
That's what's so fun about it.

1553
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.230
It's so fun that you've got all this new stuff that's in your head and it's like

1554
01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:04.930
the saddest thing about comedy is watching those guys that have been doing

1555
01:30:04.931 --> 01:30:07.450
comedy forever,
that do the same jokes they did 20 years ago.

1556
01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:09.490
That's one of the saddest things you could ever say.

1557
01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:14.350
<v 3>Yeah.
I,
um,
I work with a guy one time and he had a bit and uh,</v>

1558
01:30:14.710 --> 01:30:18.670
it was a pretty good bit and I remember thinking,
oh,
that's a good idea.

1559
01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:21.280
And He needs to,
you know,
work on that,
you know,

1560
01:30:21.281 --> 01:30:24.880
tighten it up and then get to that point a little bit quicker or whatever.

1561
01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:30.040
And then I worked with a guy like two years later and he did the same joke word

1562
01:30:30.041 --> 01:30:34.330
for word,
like no tightening of the screws at all.

1563
01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:38.380
And I remember kind of being disappointed.
I like as a fellow comedian saying,

1564
01:30:38.381 --> 01:30:42.360
well,
I mean I didn't say that to him,
but thinking,
yeah,

1565
01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:46.300
why aren't you working on this?
You know?
Well,
it's delusional.
He's delusional.

1566
01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:48.480
He's either delusional or he's lazy.
Those are the

1567
01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:50.810
<v 2>two options,
right?
It's like you're delusional.</v>

1568
01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:53.760
You think it's good enough and you don't have to change it or you're lazy and

1569
01:30:53.770 --> 01:30:56.000
that you don't want to work.
You know,
you don't want to fuck with it.

1570
01:30:56.001 --> 01:30:59.030
You don't want to tweak it.
You have to.
There's no way you get,
good.

1571
01:30:59.170 --> 01:30:59.920
<v 3>Years ago,</v>

1572
01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:04.240
I started at the Comic Strip in Fort Lauderdale and a Rodney Dangerfield was

1573
01:31:04.241 --> 01:31:08.890
performing at the sunrise musical theater and he came into the comic strip to do

1574
01:31:08.891 --> 01:31:13.360
a guest set,
like warming up for the,
his big thing,
you know,
down down the road.

1575
01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:17.500
So of course,
a small comedy club in Fort Lauderdale,
we're honored to have him.

1576
01:31:18.610 --> 01:31:22.270
He goes on stage,
crowd goes nuts.
You know,
it's a small audience,
you know,

1577
01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:26.550
200 people or whatever.
He's like,
Hey,
you know,
thanks for,

1578
01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:28.810
I want to work some stuff out.
You know,
I appreciate it.
You know,

1579
01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:33.370
he takes his glasses out and I'd been doing comedy like six months at this
point.

1580
01:31:33.371 --> 01:31:33.491
You know,

1581
01:31:33.491 --> 01:31:36.580
I worked there as a bus boy and they let me go on late at night and I hear,

1582
01:31:36.581 --> 01:31:40.030
I get to watch Rodney Dangerfield.
He,
he goes on stage,

1583
01:31:40.031 --> 01:31:43.450
he tells the audience that he wants to work on some jokes,
he takes glasses,

1584
01:31:44.170 --> 01:31:45.190
reading glasses out.

1585
01:31:45.370 --> 01:31:50.370
He takes that about 20 little three by five cards and he reads him half

1586
01:31:51.221 --> 01:31:53.260
performing them,
half reading them,
you know,
going to,

1587
01:31:53.261 --> 01:31:55.160
I just want to get a feel for these things,
you know,
and,
and he,

1588
01:31:55.170 --> 01:31:58.630
and he does them in some laugh,
some,
some work,
some don't work.

1589
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.740
And then he leaves and I'm like,
wow,
that was interesting.
You know,

1590
01:32:02.741 --> 01:32:04.870
he's working on is working on his act.

1591
01:32:04.871 --> 01:32:08.170
I'd never seen a star comedian work on his act.

1592
01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:13.180
He came in the next night and said,
hey,
you know,
can I do a guest set?

1593
01:32:13.181 --> 01:32:16.480
Of course he goes on now there's no glasses,

1594
01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:21.610
there's no three by five cards of the 20 jokes he's doing about eight of them

1595
01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:26.720
and they're tighter versions of what he had done the night before.
And it,

1596
01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:30.910
I'm getting goosebumps just thinking about it.
It's like when it dawned on me,

1597
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:36.190
this is a,
this is an art form.
This is a craft and you can work at this.

1598
01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:37.430
You can some,
any,

1599
01:32:37.431 --> 01:32:40.810
anybody could watch Rodney Dangerfield end result and just laugh.
Go.

1600
01:32:40.811 --> 01:32:45.070
That was fun.
But I got to watch him.
I got to watch,

1601
01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.760
figure this out,
take stuff,

1602
01:32:48.761 --> 01:32:52.030
trim out fat and figured out how to make a set.

1603
01:32:52.031 --> 01:32:54.820
And like from that moment on I realized,
you know,

1604
01:32:54.821 --> 01:32:58.770
just go on stage and then go home and just chill.
You know,
you,

1605
01:32:58.771 --> 01:33:03.580
you work on it and,
and so I love the process.
I love the offstage process.

1606
01:33:03.581 --> 01:33:08.290
I love working on jokes,
man.
Making them 1% better.
That's always my philosophy.

1607
01:33:08.291 --> 01:33:13.000
I just,
if I can change one word and make that joke 1% better,
why not?
Yeah.

1608
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:17.500
Or Cut,
cut words out and get to a quicker,
I knew it has more impact.
Right.
And,

1609
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:21.010
and that doesn't mean that every joke needs,
you know,
some jokes.
Yeah,

1610
01:33:21.011 --> 01:33:23.710
it's better to stretch something out if it's a free or form kind of thing.

1611
01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:26.120
To me it's like an accordion,
you know,
some stuff you're,

1612
01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:29.440
you're pulling out and other stuff you're squeezed and all that stuff is

1613
01:33:29.441 --> 01:33:30.700
happening simultaneously.

1614
01:33:30.850 --> 01:33:34.900
Or like maybe music where sometimes you have this like really slow buildup and

1615
01:33:34.901 --> 01:33:38.170
sometimes it's like really fast.
Really,
really loud.

1616
01:33:38.350 --> 01:33:42.110
It all varies and it all depends on the subject matter.
It depends on you,

1617
01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:47.050
the what you're trying to do and what,
what that bit leads into when you write.

1618
01:33:47.051 --> 01:33:50.100
Do you write on paper,
do you write on a computer,

1619
01:33:50.110 --> 01:33:51.880
do you write like do you sit down and say,

1620
01:33:51.881 --> 01:33:54.970
I'm going to write jokes today or do you just have an idea and just start

1621
01:33:54.971 --> 01:33:57.280
writing about it?
I,
I,

1622
01:33:57.610 --> 01:34:01.090
I don't know how to sit down in front of a blank piece of paper or a blank

1623
01:34:01.091 --> 01:34:05.730
computer screen and come up with stuff.
I don't know how to do that,
you know?
Um,

1624
01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:08.860
the original inspiration has to be external.
You know,

1625
01:34:08.861 --> 01:34:12.990
I just have to experience something or see something or read something.
I,

1626
01:34:13.170 --> 01:34:18.170
so I just go through my normal day or life the way I normally would and things

1627
01:34:18.191 --> 01:34:20.860
jump up and down.
It's like a kid in gym class,
you know,

1628
01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:22.510
pick me to be on the basketball team.

1629
01:34:22.630 --> 01:34:26.650
Something in life jumps up and down and you go,
oh,
that's weird.

1630
01:34:27.220 --> 01:34:31.750
And then you have your initial weird comedic view of it.

1631
01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:35.860
So the inspiration comes from an external source.
And then all right,

1632
01:34:35.861 --> 01:34:40.480
now I have the nucleus,
then I can,
right.
Then it's like,
okay,

1633
01:34:40.481 --> 01:34:43.150
now I know,
I know what the thought is,

1634
01:34:43.151 --> 01:34:46.450
the idea now what words am I going to apply to it to,

1635
01:34:46.451 --> 01:34:48.910
to get from beginning to middle to end.

1636
01:34:49.210 --> 01:34:51.850
And then that part will could take a year or longer.
You know,

1637
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:55.750
going on every night and changing the world's changing it,
you tightening it,

1638
01:34:55.930 --> 01:34:58.100
switching it,
you know like that.
And you

1639
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:00.830
<v 1>don't go necessarily to comedy clubs to work out.</v>

1640
01:35:00.831 --> 01:35:05.240
You kind of work out your bits in between like bits that are already
established.

1641
01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:08.420
Yeah.
Cause most of the time you're doing these big theaters and your,
your,

1642
01:35:08.421 --> 01:35:13.040
your tour de tour like four or five days in a row or do you just do weekends?

1643
01:35:13.041 --> 01:35:13.910
Like how do you set it up?

1644
01:35:14.330 --> 01:35:19.190
I do two weekends a month and those weekends are for one nighters.

1645
01:35:19.191 --> 01:35:22.460
I do Thursday,
Friday,
Saturday,
Sunday.
Oh you will be only do two a month.

1646
01:35:22.461 --> 01:35:25.520
Do you do every other or do you do two in a row?
It's,
well it depends.

1647
01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:28.940
I work half the weekends of the year.

1648
01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:32.480
And you do this so that you can hang out with your kids and spend time.
Yeah.

1649
01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:34.850
That's cool.
And when you do it,

1650
01:35:35.810 --> 01:35:40.010
do you like you purposely say like,
okay,
I've got,
you know,

1651
01:35:40.011 --> 01:35:43.100
a bunch of bits I'm going to do in the beginning that I know are rock solid.

1652
01:35:43.340 --> 01:35:46.910
I get everybody rocking and then I'll slide this new stuff in there and see how

1653
01:35:46.911 --> 01:35:49.910
it works.
I try not,

1654
01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:54.770
I don't want to have that overly figured out either.
You know,
it's like,
um,

1655
01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:58.250
you know,
I,
I want to,

1656
01:35:58.251 --> 01:36:03.251
I don't want to lose that weirdness of hitting something right off the bat that,

1657
01:36:03.651 --> 01:36:05.770
I dunno if it's gonna work or not.
You know,
it's,

1658
01:36:05.771 --> 01:36:09.290
it's a temptation to go to a surefire laugh and I usually do,

1659
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:11.540
but every once in a while I'll say to myself,

1660
01:36:12.110 --> 01:36:17.000
I need to go out and do something relatively new that I've never opened with.
Um,

1661
01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:18.930
and,
and,

1662
01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:24.590
and see how it flies because I want to keep exercising every muscle.

1663
01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:25.371
You know?
I mean,

1664
01:36:25.371 --> 01:36:28.690
there's a lot of guys out there who just always open with the same thing and

1665
01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:31.140
always close with the same thing and it's like,
I don't,

1666
01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:33.230
I want to keep switching that up.
You know,

1667
01:36:33.231 --> 01:36:38.231
you are also in this place where you're doing these big crowds and you don't do

1668
01:36:38.751 --> 01:36:39.471
other stuff.
Like,

1669
01:36:39.471 --> 01:36:42.530
you're not doing a lot of television shows as far as like sitcoms or you're not

1670
01:36:42.531 --> 01:36:45.230
doing a lot of movies.
You're doing a lot of these things.

1671
01:36:45.231 --> 01:36:49.070
So it's like you're constantly performing,
you're constantly performing,

1672
01:36:49.071 --> 01:36:52.730
you're constantly adding to,
this is sort of,
uh,
this,

1673
01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:57.860
this database of jokes and material,
you know.
Yeah.
I like what you're doing,

1674
01:36:57.861 --> 01:36:59.210
man.
I think it's really cool cause you were,

1675
01:36:59.211 --> 01:37:02.180
you were like trying to do the Sitcom thing for a while,

1676
01:37:02.181 --> 01:37:05.810
like everybody else and then you just like,
well fuck this.

1677
01:37:06.290 --> 01:37:10.160
Just do substantiate it.
I,
you know,
I mean heck,
you know,

1678
01:37:10.161 --> 01:37:13.070
you can't argue with somebody getting a Sitcom and then,
you know,

1679
01:37:13.071 --> 01:37:16.490
the being able to be set for life or whatever.
And um,

1680
01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:18.540
and I,
but,

1681
01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:22.130
but I have always liked to stand up and I always thought you needed to get a

1682
01:37:22.131 --> 01:37:25.310
sitcom to get to the point where you could play in theaters.
Right?

1683
01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:29.660
So that was why I wanted a sitcom so that I could get my exposure up to then I

1684
01:37:29.661 --> 01:37:32.390
could continue doing standup.
But now in front of fans,

1685
01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:37.480
we thought that in the 90s everybody thought that and I didn't realize,

1686
01:37:37.791 --> 01:37:42.590
well,
I kind of got there without having to do that.
You know,
it's like,

1687
01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:46.340
wow,
I'm building the following just from the standup [inaudible] standup thing,

1688
01:37:46.341 --> 01:37:48.530
just kept kind of getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

1689
01:37:49.130 --> 01:37:52.820
And so I was able to make that jump from comedy clubs and theaters and uh,

1690
01:37:53.810 --> 01:37:56.010
so now,
you know,
I'd still,

1691
01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:59.100
I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't want to do a TV thing,
but I would,

1692
01:37:59.130 --> 01:38:03.420
I would want it to be around my creative vision and I'm not interested in being

1693
01:38:03.421 --> 01:38:06.480
a star.
I'm interested in my comedy being a star.
Right.

1694
01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:09.000
Well that's one of the cool things about what you've been able to achieve when

1695
01:38:09.001 --> 01:38:10.710
you do these really big places,

1696
01:38:10.890 --> 01:38:15.890
but you're in is reasonable celebrity mode where it's very reasonable.

1697
01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:17.610
You're like,
I've,
I've hung out with you.

1698
01:38:17.611 --> 01:38:21.360
You could walk around the casinos and occasionally people will recognize you and

1699
01:38:21.361 --> 01:38:24.240
every line of that,
but it's not in weird,
you know,
you don't have to hide.

1700
01:38:24.241 --> 01:38:26.760
You're not getting overwhelmed.
You don't get chase.
And Hog,

1701
01:38:26.910 --> 01:38:30.810
but your pack and these giant fucking places like you have these fans,

1702
01:38:30.990 --> 01:38:34.050
it's like you just hardcore group of dedicated fans,

1703
01:38:34.051 --> 01:38:38.160
they will come to see you because you've earned them by traveling over and over

1704
01:38:38.161 --> 01:38:41.670
again back and forth to the same spots and packing these same places.

1705
01:38:41.970 --> 01:38:44.190
It's a very unique thing you've done.
I,

1706
01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:49.240
it's a very bizarre situation because I dunno what the percentages are,

1707
01:38:50.701 --> 01:38:54.930
but,
but I truly feel like if you pulled a hundred Americans just at random,

1708
01:38:55.890 --> 01:38:59.910
I swear I think 98 of them and showed them a picture of me or something like

1709
01:38:59.911 --> 01:39:04.600
that,
98 of them would not know who I am,
maybe 99.
Um,

1710
01:39:04.710 --> 01:39:09.330
yet I do have enough people that will want to go to these venues.

1711
01:39:09.930 --> 01:39:10.351
I,

1712
01:39:10.351 --> 01:39:15.351
I'm not exaggerating when I say how strange it is for me to be in a theater.

1713
01:39:17.310 --> 01:39:20.790
Say there's 2000 people there and I do my show.

1714
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:26.750
I could go a half a mile down the street to a burger king afterwards and walk in

1715
01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:30.030
and nobody in there knows who I am.
And I'm like,

1716
01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:32.610
how do these two disparate things,

1717
01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:37.530
how can I be big man on campus,
a half a mile that way.

1718
01:39:38.010 --> 01:39:39.750
And then here nobody knows,

1719
01:39:40.050 --> 01:39:43.920
nobody knows who I am while you've done it by establishing this like really

1720
01:39:43.921 --> 01:39:46.800
loyal fan base you ever,
it's very unique what you've done.

1721
01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:51.090
So the people that know you love you,
but you know,

1722
01:39:51.091 --> 01:39:55.440
maybe it's only 1% but if you look at that 1%,
if there's 350 million people,

1723
01:39:55.470 --> 01:40:00.320
that means 3.5 million people fucking love you.
I'm not,
I'm not bothered by,

1724
01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:03.850
I like it.
In fact I,
I'm not saying that you are,
but I'm saying that's,

1725
01:40:03.851 --> 01:40:05.430
it's a very unique,
I it,

1726
01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:10.410
and I realize too that anonymity is a commodity.

1727
01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:11.011
You know,
there are,

1728
01:40:11.011 --> 01:40:16.011
there are celebrities who probably might not want to be as famous as they are in

1729
01:40:18.091 --> 01:40:20.790
terms of just being able to go out and having a meal or something like that.

1730
01:40:21.330 --> 01:40:25.890
And it's like,
you know,
I don't have that issue,
man.
Yeah.
So I,

1731
01:40:25.891 --> 01:40:26.820
I have,

1732
01:40:26.850 --> 01:40:31.710
I have this career in show business with the following and nobody knows who I

1733
01:40:31.711 --> 01:40:35.910
am.
And you kind of,
if people can do that,
you kind of engineered it to,
I mean,

1734
01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:40.830
I remember when you first started like really going on the road hard and you

1735
01:40:40.831 --> 01:40:45.390
started moving from clubs to theaters.
It was all based on repeat customers.

1736
01:40:45.391 --> 01:40:49.200
It's all based on people going to see you really loving your material,

1737
01:40:49.201 --> 01:40:53.070
really laughing,
having a great time,
and then said,
oh,
Brian Regan's back in town.

1738
01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:54.070
And then boom,
boom,

1739
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:57.940
<v 2>boom,
boom,
boom.
Then it slowly started building up and then I,
you know,
I'd heard,</v>

1740
01:40:57.941 --> 01:40:58.121
I mean,

1741
01:40:58.121 --> 01:41:01.060
I don't know how many years ago you started like packing these large theaters,

1742
01:41:01.300 --> 01:41:03.490
but I'm like,
I kept hearing like,
dude,
Brian Regan,

1743
01:41:03.491 --> 01:41:05.140
it's just fucking killing it on the road.

1744
01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:07.840
The difference being that if you had a sitcom,

1745
01:41:08.050 --> 01:41:09.730
like maybe you would get people to come see you,

1746
01:41:09.731 --> 01:41:13.150
but you would not have nearly as much time to perform and to work on your

1747
01:41:13.151 --> 01:41:15.850
material and your sets probably wouldn't be the same.

1748
01:41:15.851 --> 01:41:20.851
It probably wouldn't have the same level of competency on stage that you do now

1749
01:41:21.251 --> 01:41:25.360
because you know you've been hammering that Samurai sword for fucking,
you know,

1750
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:29.470
decades and bang,
Bang.
There's guys,
and I don't want to name any names,

1751
01:41:29.471 --> 01:41:32.140
but it's sad when you see a guy who took seven,

1752
01:41:32.141 --> 01:41:35.680
eight years off to do a successful Sitcom and then they start doing standup

1753
01:41:35.681 --> 01:41:39.640
again and you realize they got soft,
not just soft,

1754
01:41:39.641 --> 01:41:43.510
but it's atrophy.
Just the waste.
They just not did.

1755
01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:46.900
Not only did they not get better,
they got worse.

1756
01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:51.880
Whatever that muscle is that allows you to do comedy and hypnotize those 4,000

1757
01:41:51.881 --> 01:41:54.880
people in the theaters that you're performing and they don't have that muscle

1758
01:41:54.881 --> 01:41:56.770
anymore.
It's just not,
it doesn't exist anymore.

1759
01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:59.560
It's all just sort of like slipped away from them.

1760
01:41:59.561 --> 01:42:02.350
And there's like a ghost of what it used to be that they're trying to

1761
01:42:02.590 --> 01:42:06.320
reestablish these embers are trying to blow on and then,
you know,

1762
01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:10.330
add good analogy.
Yeah,
I mean that's really what it is.
I mean it's,

1763
01:42:10.930 --> 01:42:15.340
we were talked into believing that the only way to be successful as a comic,

1764
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:20.110
it was to do it the way Roseann had done it or the way Seinfeld had done it is

1765
01:42:20.111 --> 01:42:23.980
take that stand up and use it to parlay it into a sitcom.

1766
01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:26.420
And there was nothing wrong with that.
I'm not,
you know,

1767
01:42:26.450 --> 01:42:28.420
that there's nothing wrong with the,
Gosh,

1768
01:42:28.421 --> 01:42:33.130
I applaud anybody that can get a network to want to build a show around them.

1769
01:42:33.131 --> 01:42:36.790
And you know,
if you can have some creative fun with it,
even better and you know,

1770
01:42:36.791 --> 01:42:40.430
make your,
make your money for the rest of your life and all that day.
You know,
I,

1771
01:42:40.990 --> 01:42:44.720
I don't denounce any of that,
but,
um,
you know,
I,

1772
01:42:44.721 --> 01:42:47.350
I like comedy as an end result.
You know,

1773
01:42:47.351 --> 01:42:51.730
some people want comp use standup comedy as a stepping stone to get to something

1774
01:42:52.210 --> 01:42:54.970
beyond that that they think is better.
And I'm like,
well,

1775
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:59.230
I don't think there's anything better.
I like it,
you know?
Yeah.

1776
01:42:59.231 --> 01:43:01.930
We just talked into a long time ago.
Like I said,

1777
01:43:01.931 --> 01:43:05.260
especially in the 90s were talked into thinking that this is not it.

1778
01:43:05.530 --> 01:43:06.370
This is just it.

1779
01:43:06.371 --> 01:43:09.250
That gets you to something else because that's something else like a lot of

1780
01:43:09.251 --> 01:43:12.610
times a lot of fucking money,
like more money than you're ever making,

1781
01:43:12.611 --> 01:43:15.400
doing stand up at the time.
Like they put you on a sitcom.

1782
01:43:15.401 --> 01:43:19.210
Like w when I was on news radio I called the sudden I was on the Sitcom and that

1783
01:43:19.211 --> 01:43:22.150
was a great experience for me.
But this,

1784
01:43:22.190 --> 01:43:26.500
it's being on a great sitcom is even though it's a lot of money,

1785
01:43:26.530 --> 01:43:30.490
this is not nearly as much fun as doing stand up.
It just never will be.

1786
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:34.330
It's just,
it's not.
It's also not nearly as much fun to watch.

1787
01:43:34.510 --> 01:43:38.230
Like if I had to choose between going to see you doing standup or watching you

1788
01:43:38.231 --> 01:43:40.700
in a sitcom,
there's no comparison.
Like,

1789
01:43:40.810 --> 01:43:43.810
and even though this stuff that you do especially like your,

1790
01:43:43.811 --> 01:43:47.260
your act as squeaky clean as one of the,
you're one of the rare guys.

1791
01:43:47.261 --> 01:43:51.980
It's universally like respected as being one of the most hilarious guys

1792
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:56.000
<v 1>out there as a standup comics.
But you're squeaky clean.</v>

1793
01:43:56.001 --> 01:43:58.940
Like I could take my mom to see you and not feel weird.

1794
01:43:59.090 --> 01:44:02.360
I can take my daughter to see you and not feel weird.
Well thank you.

1795
01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:05.720
I did a show somewhere in this family came backstage,

1796
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:10.370
including their a grandmother,
like this 80 year old woman.
And she said,

1797
01:44:10.371 --> 01:44:12.260
so how long have you been in Vaudeville?

1798
01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:19.440
Vaudeville,
Vaudeville?
Again,
I don't even know.
But you know,

1799
01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:22.850
like I guess I started around 1920 I don't,
I don't know.

1800
01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:25.700
Vaudeville's one of those expressions that I never really bothered to figure out

1801
01:44:25.701 --> 01:44:29.270
what it meant.
I Dunno.
So old kind of show Biz thing,
right?

1802
01:44:29.271 --> 01:44:32.060
Where there was a singer and a comedian and a magician or something.

1803
01:44:32.061 --> 01:44:35.270
I'm guessing.
I don't know.
Yeah,
more of a variety thing.

1804
01:44:35.271 --> 01:44:37.970
They used to have to do that.
Yeah.
Imagine if you had to do it.

1805
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.180
Lenny Bruce Style and used to be the fucking,
I don't even see other night.

1806
01:44:41.210 --> 01:44:42.980
I don't know if I,
you know,
if I had to start,

1807
01:44:42.981 --> 01:44:46.910
like if I was born in 1930 or 40 and wanting to be a comedian,

1808
01:44:46.940 --> 01:44:48.020
I don't know if I would have made it.

1809
01:44:48.050 --> 01:44:50.450
I got fortunate in that when I want it to be a comedian,

1810
01:44:50.630 --> 01:44:54.440
there was a such thing as a comedy club where people are there to watch comedy

1811
01:44:54.441 --> 01:44:57.080
only.
Yeah.
And Open mic nights.

1812
01:44:57.620 --> 01:45:00.770
That's the big one is the open Mike nights like training wheels.

1813
01:45:01.100 --> 01:45:02.420
Like before open Mike dice,

1814
01:45:02.421 --> 01:45:05.900
like how the fuck did you ever get on stage the first time?
Right.

1815
01:45:06.290 --> 01:45:08.180
That's why a lot of those guys used to do joke jokes.

1816
01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:10.610
Like if you talked to like some of the old comics,

1817
01:45:10.611 --> 01:45:13.530
it'll be honest with you about like what was going on.

1818
01:45:13.531 --> 01:45:18.230
Like in the early days they would all share material,
you know,

1819
01:45:18.290 --> 01:45:22.130
they would all do jokes.
They would look like they would go to these places.

1820
01:45:22.131 --> 01:45:24.080
The people would never see them again,
you know?

1821
01:45:24.081 --> 01:45:27.500
And they would do a joke and then like their name would get out there that this

1822
01:45:27.501 --> 01:45:31.160
guy is hilarious and you'd go see them.
And they were like doing jokes,

1823
01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:36.090
like two guys walk into a bar.
Like literally they would do like street jokes.

1824
01:45:36.091 --> 01:45:38.960
Right.
And they would have a certain amount of them that they like.

1825
01:45:38.961 --> 01:45:41.360
Jackie the joke man Martley perfect example.

1826
01:45:41.690 --> 01:45:45.020
Jackie Martin Lane like literally knows every fucking joke that's ever,
he has a,

1827
01:45:45.110 --> 01:45:47.480
he has a segment that he does called stump the joke man.

1828
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:51.620
Or He's doing radio where people would call him up with a joke and he would know

1829
01:45:51.621 --> 01:45:55.150
how the joke goes cause he literally knows every joke.
Yeah.

1830
01:45:55.730 --> 01:45:58.370
I've worked with him a number of times over the years.
And you know,

1831
01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:00.680
it's interesting the way he,

1832
01:46:01.130 --> 01:46:04.190
I mean I liked that there are different people doing different things and he's

1833
01:46:04.191 --> 01:46:07.910
like a joke joke guy.
It takes a lot of pride in that and that's fun to watch.

1834
01:46:07.911 --> 01:46:10.860
It's like,
okay,
that's,
that's what he's doing.
Yeah.
Joke,
joke.

1835
01:46:10.861 --> 01:46:14.570
Two guys walk into a bar kind of jokes.
Yeah.
Um,
but I also liked the fact that,

1836
01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:14.781
you know,

1837
01:46:14.781 --> 01:46:19.360
there's other people doing bizarrely are weirdly different kinds of comedy too.

1838
01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:21.940
You know,
that's what's so cool about comedies.

1839
01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:25.160
There's so many different things happening under that,
under that big umbrella.

1840
01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:28.940
You know,
one thing you don't see anymore,
prop acts,

1841
01:46:29.180 --> 01:46:34.040
carrot top killed the prop acts to so few prop backs.
It's weird.

1842
01:46:34.190 --> 01:46:37.910
When I was starting out there was a lot of pop acts like you go to open mic

1843
01:46:37.911 --> 01:46:40.640
night and on an average open Mike night,

1844
01:46:40.641 --> 01:46:45.530
maybe one guy would have prompts and you don't see them anymore.
Hmm.
Carrot,

1845
01:46:45.531 --> 01:46:49.590
top murdered.
That game is no more.
It's like don't like,

1846
01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:53.280
I like him.
He it,
when I used to work in Charlotte,

1847
01:46:53.580 --> 01:46:58.580
he used to live there and he would come out and he was always very uh,

1848
01:46:58.650 --> 01:47:01.530
cool and friendly and you know,

1849
01:47:01.531 --> 01:47:06.030
he was a college act at that time.
And you know,
I think he kind of knew the rap,

1850
01:47:06.031 --> 01:47:10.920
you know,
of how many people,
like what some people think about prop stuff.

1851
01:47:10.921 --> 01:47:15.030
But I dunno,
I,
I like to feel like,
hey man,

1852
01:47:15.150 --> 01:47:19.050
there's all different ways of doing comedy short.
You know,
it's funny.
Yeah,

1853
01:47:19.051 --> 01:47:22.800
he does.
He does props.
Great.
Yeah,

1854
01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:24.390
he's great at that.

1855
01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:27.150
And if you want to go there and just buy into that experience,

1856
01:47:27.151 --> 01:47:29.190
he's going to be holding things up and it's going to be silly and funny.

1857
01:47:29.370 --> 01:47:33.090
That's fine.
I think that's valid.
Oh yeah.
No,
I'm not criticizing it at all.

1858
01:47:33.410 --> 01:47:36.570
You know,
I don't have any problem with what he does.
And by all accounts,

1859
01:47:36.571 --> 01:47:40.740
he's a very nice guy.
But it's,
it's interesting that that genre,
it doesn't exist.

1860
01:47:40.741 --> 01:47:42.990
Anything that is interesting.
It's very few puppet acts.

1861
01:47:42.991 --> 01:47:47.880
He stays to [inaudible] very few puppet acts.
It's like a Jeff Dunham and those,

1862
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.840
those whatever characters that he has,
he's kind of like nailed that down.

1863
01:47:52.050 --> 01:47:53.100
There's like a few guys,

1864
01:47:53.101 --> 01:47:57.200
like there's Terry fade or he does those impressions like he has that Terry Fade

1865
01:47:57.201 --> 01:48:01.500
or theater and uh,
at the Mirage.
But other than those two guys,

1866
01:48:02.010 --> 01:48:04.860
they used to be auto and George.
Did you ever get a chance to work with auto?
Yes,

1867
01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:11.100
I used to love watching George and he's my favorite of all time and when it

1868
01:48:11.281 --> 01:48:13.410
comes to puppet acts,
because he had a crazy rap,

1869
01:48:13.411 --> 01:48:16.780
like the puppet would say all the fucked up shit and then he would go,
uh,

1870
01:48:16.850 --> 01:48:21.330
I can't believe you're saying that.
Papago fuck you.

1871
01:48:21.510 --> 01:48:25.380
He got the puppy got stabbed once.
It's a legendary story.

1872
01:48:25.381 --> 01:48:28.950
Some guy that he was shitting on some guy in the audience and the guy jumped up

1873
01:48:28.951 --> 01:48:32.970
and stabbed the puppet like he has.

1874
01:48:33.210 --> 01:48:37.830
Give me the ultimate compliment.
My puppet.

1875
01:48:38.250 --> 01:48:41.030
I know I'm good at this.
I worked with them once and these kids were heckling.

1876
01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:44.340
We see your lips moving.
We see your lips will like that.

1877
01:48:44.350 --> 01:48:47.130
You Miss Missing the point.
Of course his lips are moving.

1878
01:48:47.140 --> 01:48:51.060
You think the dummies really fucking talking while you looking at his lips.

1879
01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:54.570
But you know,
people want like especially dumb people,

1880
01:48:54.571 --> 01:48:57.510
they want the ventriloquist to regarding wait weight total day.

1881
01:48:58.710 --> 01:49:00.840
I got news for you.
You can't,
you know,

1882
01:49:00.841 --> 01:49:03.480
they want your mouth to be completely still.

1883
01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:08.460
The one thing I never understood is people will say they can throw their voice.

1884
01:49:10.230 --> 01:49:11.010
What does that mean?

1885
01:49:11.010 --> 01:49:16.010
It means you're an idiot where it's hone it to really have the ability to have

1886
01:49:17.070 --> 01:49:21.540
your voice coming from another place outside of your mouth.

1887
01:49:21.550 --> 01:49:26.170
Your honor,
he threw his voice,
came out of the other person.

1888
01:49:26.970 --> 01:49:30.990
Did you throw your voice son?
Chase,
I remind you,

1889
01:49:30.991 --> 01:49:33.840
you are under oath.
You know this,
know this,

1890
01:49:33.841 --> 01:49:36.420
that that's a thing that people used to think people could do.

1891
01:49:36.750 --> 01:49:38.370
They used to think people could throw their voice.

1892
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.030
I think as a kid I thought that that I would actually try like on the side of my

1893
01:49:42.031 --> 01:49:42.864
mouth,
but

1894
01:49:49.130 --> 01:49:50.990
no,
not over here.
I'm over here.

1895
01:49:51.370 --> 01:49:55.330
You could kind of like subtly make it seem like it's not coming from you.

1896
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:58.360
Like maybe coming from this side of you,
you're blowed off the phone.

1897
01:49:58.930 --> 01:50:02.260
I hope there's not somebody out there who does that for a living and they feel

1898
01:50:02.261 --> 01:50:06.640
like I'm slamming him,
slamming his crap.
You like your support,

1899
01:50:06.641 --> 01:50:08.680
carrot copy on support.
Fuck

1900
01:50:10.570 --> 01:50:14.950
you ever watch a good comedy hypnotist?
Uh,

1901
01:50:15.230 --> 01:50:17.110
I,
yeah.
Yeah.
I,

1902
01:50:17.130 --> 01:50:22.100
I'm not big on the hypnosis thing because I,
you know,
um,

1903
01:50:23.890 --> 01:50:28.420
I think you can be really good at that.
I just,
I've,
maybe this is a very,

1904
01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:30.333
I dunno,

1905
01:50:30.580 --> 01:50:35.580
I don't believe that the people that are doing these things are really

1906
01:50:35.981 --> 01:50:38.080
hypnotized.
Wow.

1907
01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:41.290
Maybe I'm naive or I don't know.

1908
01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:45.160
You might use the wrong word.
You need to see someone who's really good at it.

1909
01:50:45.550 --> 01:50:48.430
There's people,
and I don't know why.
I don't know what it is.

1910
01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:51.290
I'm not saying there's that no one can be hit now.

1911
01:50:51.330 --> 01:50:55.690
I'm not saying there's people that no one can hypnotize because I've never tried

1912
01:50:55.691 --> 01:50:56.411
to be hypnotized.

1913
01:50:56.411 --> 01:51:00.000
I never sat down with a really good hypnotist and tried to be hypnotized.
I've,

1914
01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:01.090
I have friends that have,

1915
01:51:01.091 --> 01:51:05.140
and they swear by it and I know fighters that have done it and they say it helps

1916
01:51:05.141 --> 01:51:07.300
their,
their career and then helps their mindset.

1917
01:51:07.630 --> 01:51:11.920
But there are certain people for whatever reason,
that are really,

1918
01:51:11.921 --> 01:51:13.480
really susceptible to hypnosis.

1919
01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:17.860
And there was a guy named Frank Santos and he used to do this show back at

1920
01:51:17.861 --> 01:51:21.730
stitches in Boston.
And,
uh,
he would do it every week.
Frank Santos,

1921
01:51:21.731 --> 01:51:26.140
the r rated hypnotist.
And it was amazing.
I mean,

1922
01:51:26.141 --> 01:51:29.590
the staff would get their staff of the comic club comics who come down and watch

1923
01:51:29.591 --> 01:51:32.830
it because it was just the most bizarre thing.

1924
01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:36.700
You would see these people and they really believed what he was saying.

1925
01:51:36.910 --> 01:51:39.100
Like there'd be people that thought they were having sex,

1926
01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:42.430
they'd be people that thought they were naked.
But,
but how do you know that?

1927
01:51:42.580 --> 01:51:46.570
How do you know they believe that?
How do you know question?
How do you know that?

1928
01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:48.460
You know how Halloween,

1929
01:51:48.490 --> 01:51:52.090
isn't it fun to dress up like a vampire on Halloween because a,

1930
01:51:52.091 --> 01:51:54.670
it's okay to act crazy on Halloween night.

1931
01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.910
Maybe when you're going to one of these comedy hypnosis shows,

1932
01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:02.890
maybe you have the green light to act silly on stage.
You know,
it's like,
Oh wow,

1933
01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:05.090
I can do this and no one's going to hold,

1934
01:52:05.530 --> 01:52:09.940
hold me accountable to acting goofy on stage.
I can say I was hypnotized.

1935
01:52:09.941 --> 01:52:14.200
So maybe they just enjoy being in the limelight and acting goofy.
It is possible.

1936
01:52:14.290 --> 01:52:16.150
But there were people that he would tell them,

1937
01:52:16.151 --> 01:52:19.000
I'm going to say I'm going to count to three and when I count to three,

1938
01:52:19.001 --> 01:52:21.110
you're going to realize you're naked in front of all these people and you're

1939
01:52:21.111 --> 01:52:22.300
going to be terrified.
One,
two,

1940
01:52:22.301 --> 01:52:25.300
three and you'd see them like there would be two good.

1941
01:52:25.510 --> 01:52:28.770
There was some people that were just too good at acting like you would like.

1942
01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:31.660
They would be fucking confused.
They weren't hamming it up.

1943
01:52:31.661 --> 01:52:35.090
They weren't going over the top and he would talk to them and question them.

1944
01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:36.400
You don't have to see it man,

1945
01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:38.920
because he would also know when people weren't under.

1946
01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:41.440
He would know when people weren't under and we remove them from the stage.

1947
01:52:41.590 --> 01:52:43.420
He would know that they were faking and he'd look at them.

1948
01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:46.910
I think there's some people that are fucking stupid and they're open to

1949
01:52:46.911 --> 01:52:49.370
suggestion.
I will say this.

1950
01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:51.693
<v 3>Th Th th th</v>

1951
01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:56.580
<v 1>I'll open the door to the possibility of hypnosis in the sense that you know how</v>

1952
01:52:56.581 --> 01:52:59.790
like when you're watching a football game and all of a sudden the other team has

1953
01:52:59.791 --> 01:53:02.610
the ball and you're like,
I don't remember them punting yet.

1954
01:53:02.611 --> 01:53:05.130
I've been staring at this TV screen for five minutes.

1955
01:53:05.131 --> 01:53:08.970
Obviously my brain went somewhere.
I,
I missed the last few plays.

1956
01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:14.270
So maybe in life that can happen where somebody has the power to make your brain

1957
01:53:15.090 --> 01:53:17.130
go away for awhile.
I,
I don't know,

1958
01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:20.400
I used to think it was total bullshit until I watched this guy do it over and

1959
01:53:20.401 --> 01:53:22.320
over and over again week after week after week.

1960
01:53:22.321 --> 01:53:26.250
And then I became friends with them and talk to him and explained how he started

1961
01:53:26.251 --> 01:53:27.084
out as a,

1962
01:53:27.150 --> 01:53:30.240
he was hypnotizing people for like weight loss and quitting smoking and stuff

1963
01:53:30.241 --> 01:53:31.770
along those lines.
He just knew how to do it.

1964
01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:34.950
He just knew how to do it and he'd done it a long time and he knew when people

1965
01:53:34.951 --> 01:53:37.410
were under and when they weren't under.
I just think there's some,

1966
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:38.581
I don't think you are,

1967
01:53:38.581 --> 01:53:41.130
but I think there's some people that are just really open to suggestion.

1968
01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:44.550
And I think there's also something that happens when you put them on stage

1969
01:53:44.850 --> 01:53:48.270
because I think people like they get really weirded out by the factor on stage.

1970
01:53:48.271 --> 01:53:50.570
The lights are on them and it makes them maybe,

1971
01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:54.000
perhaps some people even more vulnerable.
Right.

1972
01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:58.200
So I understand your a lack of belief,

1973
01:53:58.280 --> 01:53:59.380
the art form,

1974
01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:03.780
trying to be more open minded about everything.

1975
01:54:03.810 --> 01:54:08.000
So I will,
I will say that it is possible.
I wish there was a good one.
Yeah.

1976
01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:12.060
I would love to have like the best back.
Come here and try it on.

1977
01:54:12.061 --> 01:54:17.061
Maybe Jamie or somebody you want to see you for the comedy shows you what Jamie,

1978
01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:19.500
you want to see it live?
You really want to see it live.

1979
01:54:19.650 --> 01:54:22.020
I just wish there was more guys doing that.
I know his son,

1980
01:54:22.021 --> 01:54:25.470
Frank Santos junior does it now in New England,
but I,
uh,

1981
01:54:25.471 --> 01:54:28.650
I just wish there were more those comedy hypnotists out there.

1982
01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:31.710
Not that meant I did a show one time out in the road.

1983
01:54:33.230 --> 01:54:33.830
<v 3>Uh,</v>

1984
01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:38.830
like a fill in date and they didn't tell the the club I was filling in for a

1985
01:54:39.861 --> 01:54:41.630
comedy hypnotist.

1986
01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:45.590
<v 1>Oh,
but they didn't even tell the audience.
Oh No.</v>

1987
01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:47.970
And I had a bad set.

1988
01:54:48.210 --> 01:54:52.740
I get off stage and then I see table tents and all the tables,
you know,

1989
01:54:52.741 --> 01:54:56.610
comedy,
hypnosis night.
And people were coming up to me going,

1990
01:54:57.030 --> 01:55:00.950
how come you didn't make us act like chickens?
You know?
And I'm like,

1991
01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:04.290
that's when I found out you thought I was a comedy hypnotist.

1992
01:55:04.291 --> 01:55:08.550
I did an hour of total confusion for this audience.

1993
01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:11.840
So they're waiting to be hypnotized.
That's what they thought the show was.

1994
01:55:11.841 --> 01:55:15.420
That's hilarious.
So you're eating dick up there talking about socks and right.

1995
01:55:15.421 --> 01:55:19.150
And they're just waiting.
When is he going to start bringing us on stage?

1996
01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:21.690
Yeah,
they're just waiting.

1997
01:55:21.691 --> 01:55:26.640
If like you're warming them up for the comedy hypnosis thing.

1998
01:55:26.641 --> 01:55:29.040
And then I say good night.
And they were like,
what the hell?

1999
01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:33.550
You can just say you don't remember cause I hypnotized

2000
01:55:36.990 --> 01:55:41.760
and you pregnant and you were all feeling like you were naked.

2001
01:55:41.770 --> 01:55:44.000
Good eye.
How

2002
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:48.540
<v 2>weird.
That's what's the worst gig you ever had to do.
Do you have a worst?</v>

2003
01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:53.040
<v 3>Um,
I had one show where I walked almost the entire audience.</v>

2004
01:55:53.190 --> 01:55:57.840
Um,
I filled in for a comedian and he called me up and said,
uh,

2005
01:55:57.870 --> 01:56:01.950
you know Adam Leslie?
No,
Adam Leslie,
he no longer with us,
but uh,

2006
01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:03.930
he had a headline Gig at some,

2007
01:56:03.970 --> 01:56:08.250
at a place called the comedy barn in Jackson,
Mississippi.

2008
01:56:08.251 --> 01:56:11.820
I think it was the,
the town down in the south.
He goes,
I can't do the date,

2009
01:56:11.910 --> 01:56:15.390
would you fill in and headline for me?
I was very new to headlining,

2010
01:56:16.740 --> 01:56:17.670
so I said sure.

2011
01:56:17.671 --> 01:56:21.180
And somehow the club was okay with him bringing somebody else in instead of him.

2012
01:56:21.510 --> 01:56:26.510
So I get onstage on a Friday night and just didn't get my foot in the door.

2013
01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:33.270
Um,
and just flatline and you know,

2014
01:56:33.271 --> 01:56:37.500
how you know how it is like you,
there's a point where,
you know,
this is over,

2015
01:56:37.530 --> 01:56:42.300
this thing happening.
And that was at that point that nothing,
no,
no savers,

2016
01:56:42.301 --> 01:56:47.010
we're working,
nothing was working.
And then a foursome at the front got up.

2017
01:56:47.130 --> 01:56:47.701
Like,
you know,

2018
01:56:47.701 --> 01:56:52.701
when I had like 30 minutes left and just put their coats on,

2019
01:56:52.771 --> 01:56:53.604
I mean,
how

2020
01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:59.220
put their jackets and stuff on it and just walked away.
So I'm thinking,
well,

2021
01:56:59.221 --> 01:56:59.881
maybe you know,

2022
01:56:59.881 --> 01:57:03.690
they have the babysitter or something and then another force him and then a

2023
01:57:03.691 --> 01:57:07.200
twosome and then everybody just thought,
well,
I guess it's okay to leave.

2024
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:12.120
And everybody just got up and walked out.

2025
01:57:12.150 --> 01:57:15.090
I probably had 20 people left when I was done.

2026
01:57:15.390 --> 01:57:18.120
It was the most humiliating,

2027
01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:21.570
one of the most humiliating nights of my career.
How long ago was,

2028
01:57:21.571 --> 01:57:22.800
this is last week.

2029
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:27.800
<v 2>Leslie died.
I got a phone call from the book or</v>

2030
01:57:29.380 --> 01:57:33.860
the book or killed him talking down to my club.

2031
01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:38.350
He murdered out money.
We're losing our mortgage now.
Yeah,
this was,
Gosh,

2032
01:57:38.410 --> 01:57:42.640
25 years ago.
I don't know those,
those moments when you're fucking tail spinning,

2033
01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:45.550
those are what some of the most painful and confusing moments in the comics

2034
01:57:45.551 --> 01:57:47.170
career.
But in my opinion,

2035
01:57:47.171 --> 01:57:50.620
those are like really important because they're all the big growth moments of my

2036
01:57:50.621 --> 01:57:54.400
early career came after I bombed,
bombed and then said,
okay,

2037
01:57:54.401 --> 01:57:56.290
I never want to fucking experience that again.

2038
01:57:56.320 --> 01:57:58.240
I got to figure out what did I do wrong?
Like why did I,

2039
01:57:58.540 --> 01:58:02.010
what did I opened with that sucked.
Did I not get them right off the bat did,

2040
01:58:02.060 --> 01:58:04.690
whereas was I not loose enough?
Was I not comfortable enough?

2041
01:58:04.691 --> 01:58:09.160
Was I not having enough fun?
Like what the hell was it?
What was I too cocky?

2042
01:58:09.161 --> 01:58:13.690
Was I too meek?
Like what,
what are the,
what's the,
what's the numbers?
You know,

2043
01:58:14.350 --> 01:58:17.210
you sometimes think it is to the audience completely.
The audience,
like just,

2044
01:58:17.230 --> 01:58:20.230
you know,
it's Friday night,
10 o'clock show.

2045
01:58:20.260 --> 01:58:22.690
These people are all just in a kind of,
uh,
the,

2046
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:26.590
the audience can play a part in whether or not you have a good set or a great

2047
01:58:26.591 --> 01:58:30.850
set,
but the audience cannot play a part if you are,
if you're a really,

2048
01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:35.350
unless it's just the worst fucking horrendous group of fucking convicts.

2049
01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:40.000
Route on parole all on Beth.
It is possible,

2050
01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:42.910
but a lot of times have uh,
a bad audience,

2051
01:58:42.911 --> 01:58:45.310
but you could still get them and you'll have a good set.

2052
01:58:45.311 --> 01:58:49.390
You could still have a good set.
Sometimes you just go out there and it's magic.

2053
01:58:49.510 --> 01:58:52.960
Sometimes he'd go out there and you just feel so loose and the audience is so

2054
01:58:52.961 --> 01:58:56.590
ready right off the bat that everything is just flowing and amazing.

2055
01:58:56.590 --> 01:59:00.130
Like that was this weekend in Portland.
I did a helium,
that comedy club.

2056
01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:02.230
I'm trying to work on some new material.

2057
01:59:02.231 --> 01:59:05.070
I'm tightened things up so I like to go to comedy clubs.
When I do that,

2058
01:59:05.080 --> 01:59:06.730
I'd like to do a whole weekend at a comedy club.

2059
01:59:06.731 --> 01:59:08.230
You doing those two shows on Friday,

2060
01:59:08.231 --> 01:59:12.090
two shows on Saturday and it was just so fun.
It had been sold out for months.

2061
01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:14.380
It was like the oldest energy in the air and everything was great.

2062
01:59:14.710 --> 01:59:19.090
But then I did the comedy store like two Wednesdays ago.
Oh.
It was just like,

2063
01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:23.680
there was like no energy in the room.
Right.
Marin was on before me.

2064
01:59:23.681 --> 01:59:25.870
He was saying the same thing.
He got off stage.

2065
01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:29.780
I think he even said something like,
you guys,
uh,
you were there.
You know,
like,

2066
01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:32.450
I think you said that like saying good night.
It's just,

2067
01:59:32.451 --> 01:59:34.270
there was a weird lack of,

2068
01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:37.420
it was almost like one of these cross armed audiences where they're like,

2069
01:59:37.870 --> 01:59:41.140
they're not going to put out too much energy.
It's a Wednesday night at 10 30.

2070
01:59:41.141 --> 01:59:44.620
There's not much there,
but you still get them.
Like,
I had a good set.

2071
01:59:44.650 --> 01:59:48.940
It was still good.
It still went,
you know,
all the stuff that's funny.
Got Laughs.

2072
01:59:49.150 --> 01:59:49.983
I always,

2073
01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:55.200
I always felt like my job was to be one better than the audience that,

2074
01:59:56.650 --> 01:59:59.350
you know,
there are many comedians can do as well as the audience.

2075
01:59:59.351 --> 02:00:02.440
If it's a great crowd,
they do crate.
If it's a good crowd,
they do good.

2076
02:00:02.530 --> 02:00:06.720
If it's a bad crowd,
they do bad.
I always wanted to be one,

2077
02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:10.600
like I want it to be where like if they were bad,
I would do so.

2078
02:00:10.601 --> 02:00:14.980
So if they were so,
so I would do good.
If they were good,

2079
02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:17.410
I would do great.
And if they were great I would do great.

2080
02:00:17.500 --> 02:00:20.920
That's a beautiful philosophy.
So I just want it to one up,
you know what I mean?

2081
02:00:20.921 --> 02:00:25.921
Like it was my job to bring them to one higher level of what their situations.

2082
02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:29.850
I was at the Improv one night and it was a late show.
Uh,

2083
02:00:29.870 --> 02:00:33.450
it was like a 10:00 PM show on a Friday.
And,
uh,
the car,

2084
02:00:33.490 --> 02:00:38.080
the crowd was kind of tired and Brody Stevens went on and he was on like last

2085
02:00:38.290 --> 02:00:41.870
and he took his shirt off and started running through the crowd.

2086
02:00:41.871 --> 02:00:45.310
He made them play music.
He took his shirt off,
started running through the crowd,

2087
02:00:45.610 --> 02:00:50.530
and he was taking a shirt and spinning it over his head like a helicopter.

2088
02:00:50.650 --> 02:00:51.071
He's like,

2089
02:00:51.071 --> 02:00:56.071
we have energy and here are all la is happening.

2090
02:00:56.590 --> 02:00:59.920
This is real.
We're in Hollywood.

2091
02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:03.270
And he starts like clapping and putting his arms together and getting everybody

2092
02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:07.720
to clap along.
And he transformed the entire room and he went on stage,

2093
02:01:07.870 --> 02:01:11.290
transformed the,
I mean,
there's a video on my Instagram page of Brody.

2094
02:01:11.500 --> 02:01:15.640
It's late night pull,
pull it up,
the late night video of him drumming.

2095
02:01:15.850 --> 02:01:20.110
He does these closer spots at the,
uh,
at the comedy store where,

2096
02:01:20.830 --> 02:01:21.850
you know,
the show starts,

2097
02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:25.600
the main room show starts at nine o'clock and it goes on until two o'clock in

2098
02:01:25.601 --> 02:01:27.610
the morning and there's a point of no return.

2099
02:01:27.670 --> 02:01:31.180
There's a no man's land time somewhere after like 1130,

2100
02:01:31.390 --> 02:01:34.000
where the audience is like,
okay,
let's just get the fuck out of here.

2101
02:01:34.001 --> 02:01:38.950
I don't like a lot of people leave.
So it was packed.
And then when Brody goes on,

2102
02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:44.120
there's like maybe 25 or 30 peoples of this is,
this is,

2103
02:01:44.450 --> 02:01:48.710
this is a Brodie onstage playing drums.
Check this out.

2104
02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:49.910
Can we hear this through our headphones?

2105
02:01:55.570 --> 02:01:57.310
He's fucking playing drums.

2106
02:01:57.820 --> 02:02:02.820
I mean it doesn't even when he says he's got a guy next to the guy in the middle

2107
02:02:03.011 --> 02:02:07.310
aged guy back there,
the guy who his left that you can't see,
he's got thimbles.

2108
02:02:07.540 --> 02:02:11.500
Joe,
what does those things about?
Symbols.
Symbols,
right?
Tambourine.

2109
02:02:11.740 --> 02:02:13.060
He gave him a fucking tambourine,

2110
02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:17.200
the guy's got a tambourine and he gave it to the guy goes,
you back me up.

2111
02:02:17.201 --> 02:02:18.460
You've got the tambourine,

2112
02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:25.090
I mean I watched him for an hour and he went from that to doing stand up.

2113
02:02:25.410 --> 02:02:27.330
Well he's talking to the crowd.
He,

2114
02:02:27.331 --> 02:02:29.470
there was points in times where you see there's photo,

2115
02:02:30.270 --> 02:02:34.950
there's photos where you can see him walking around the crowd.

2116
02:02:34.951 --> 02:02:38.400
He put the microphone down and started doing standup.
Just walking around.

2117
02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:40.530
Just walking around.
Yeah.
Friday nights.

2118
02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:44.640
Kennison spot in the main room is usually when Brody just does an hour,

2119
02:02:44.641 --> 02:02:47.340
he starts off the drums,
he rocks around.
It's great.
It's a great,

2120
02:02:47.370 --> 02:02:49.290
there's two guys that nail that spot.
Yeah.

2121
02:02:49.590 --> 02:02:54.590
Brian Holtzman and Brody Stevens cause they're both just freeform maniacs.

2122
02:02:54.841 --> 02:02:56.310
They just can just free ball.

2123
02:02:56.311 --> 02:02:59.700
And Brody especially because he does so many warmups.

2124
02:02:59.970 --> 02:03:04.890
He warms up for like sitcoms and talk shows and he's really good at it.

2125
02:03:04.891 --> 02:03:07.430
So they have him come in.
We had them do it when I did the man show.
He,

2126
02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:11.850
he's amazing at it.
Just creating comedy out of nowhere.
He just goes in there,

2127
02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:15.090
starts talking to people and the next thing you know,
I couldn't do that.

2128
02:03:15.250 --> 02:03:18.270
I don't have that ability.
I don't have that ability at all.

2129
02:03:18.310 --> 02:03:19.740
I've seen a couple of sitcoms,

2130
02:03:19.741 --> 02:03:24.741
tapings and watched the comedians that have to warm up that that is a skill that

2131
02:03:26.641 --> 02:03:30.540
is an amazing skill and I could not accomplish it.
It's an act.

2132
02:03:30.570 --> 02:03:34.950
It's a different kind of act.
It's,
it's like another facet of standup comedy.

2133
02:03:35.250 --> 02:03:38.320
I wouldn't say it's my favorite facet but don't,

2134
02:03:38.610 --> 02:03:42.300
but the thing about Brody is that that facet,

2135
02:03:42.330 --> 02:03:45.660
even though I don't necessarily like like watching warm ups that much,
right.

2136
02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:50.230
Brody has turned that into like approving or not approving ground but like a

2137
02:03:50.250 --> 02:03:51.510
training ground for him.

2138
02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:56.720
Like he's so comfortable just free balling about anything and everything and he

2139
02:03:56.881 --> 02:04:00.810
knows how to like hit it and turn it into comedy is a very unusual talent.

2140
02:04:00.811 --> 02:04:03.450
Brody Stevens and that he's really good at that.

2141
02:04:03.570 --> 02:04:07.260
That late night spot I've done since I've been back at the comedy store,

2142
02:04:07.261 --> 02:04:10.500
I've seen him do four or five of those late night spots are particularly just,

2143
02:04:10.501 --> 02:04:13.200
I just waited around and waited so I could watch Brody.

2144
02:04:14.190 --> 02:04:16.870
Michael Keaton was there last night by the way.
Was he reaching there,

2145
02:04:17.250 --> 02:04:21.090
Kimberly condom.
When the roast battle,
a academy award winner,

2146
02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:24.300
Michael Keaton movie won the Academy Award.
All right.
It sucks.

2147
02:04:24.370 --> 02:04:27.750
It's the worst movie.
I watched it three times.
Are you guys joking?

2148
02:04:27.780 --> 02:04:31.590
Jamie liked it.
You liked it?
Jamie liked it.
I haven't seen it,
but I hear it.

2149
02:04:31.630 --> 02:04:33.900
I've heard quite a few people tell you is good.
You know what?

2150
02:04:33.901 --> 02:04:36.240
I'm going to have to watch it.
It was bothering me is there's all the,

2151
02:04:36.241 --> 02:04:37.074
there's this

2152
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:43.070
<v 1>video going around of Michael Keaton putting what some people are speculating is</v>

2153
02:04:43.141 --> 02:04:46.110
an acceptance speech for best actor back into his pocket.

2154
02:04:47.010 --> 02:04:51.270
And the vibe is how embarrassing is that?
Why is that embarrassing?

2155
02:04:52.170 --> 02:04:53.310
You know,
that the guy,

2156
02:04:53.340 --> 02:04:56.790
the guy was up for the best actor at a point in his career where,
you know,

2157
02:04:56.791 --> 02:05:01.050
it's been a while since he's done anything.
I hate this negativity,
you know,

2158
02:05:01.051 --> 02:05:01.500
to to,

2159
02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:06.420
to take that moment and just blow that up as something that he should be ashamed

2160
02:05:06.421 --> 02:05:08.970
of or embarrassed.
Well,
so what,
he had an acceptance speech.

2161
02:05:08.971 --> 02:05:13.720
He was up for the Academy Award.
Didn't I see you bomb and Arsenio,
you,

2162
02:05:15.090 --> 02:05:19.290
hey,
how's your career?
I,
you know,
there's just,
I don't know,

2163
02:05:19.291 --> 02:05:21.930
there's too much.
There's too much,
uh,

2164
02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:24.360
unhappy people in this world don't,

2165
02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:28.830
I don't like to slam and people's dresses and all that stuff.
You know,

2166
02:05:28.831 --> 02:05:33.180
it's like they've been working their ass off or their career to finally get a

2167
02:05:33.181 --> 02:05:35.250
role where they're,
they're getting a little,

2168
02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:39.630
they're getting some attention and they get to go to this big Fun Academy Award

2169
02:05:39.631 --> 02:05:43.170
and they put everything they can into and putting this dress on and then some

2170
02:05:43.470 --> 02:05:48.090
guy or woman just gets to go,
I think it looks ugly.
Do you know why that exists?

2171
02:05:48.630 --> 02:05:52.590
Because of people like Kanye West because people that their egos are so blown

2172
02:05:52.591 --> 02:05:55.740
out of proportion.
You want to shoot them down.
They're so goofy.

2173
02:05:55.741 --> 02:05:58.290
So then you start looking at other people.
It was fun shooting him down.

2174
02:05:58.500 --> 02:06:01.260
Let me look around and see lots of fucking floss and then I don't like,

2175
02:06:01.500 --> 02:06:02.670
and you start looking for them.

2176
02:06:02.671 --> 02:06:06.000
It's like we don't like people that think they're better than everybody else and

2177
02:06:06.001 --> 02:06:07.860
one who when someone thinks they're better than everybody else,

2178
02:06:07.861 --> 02:06:11.940
they are a justifiable target.
So then it becomes like a genre,

2179
02:06:11.941 --> 02:06:15.300
like picking on people that are celebrities.
It becomes like a thing.

2180
02:06:15.510 --> 02:06:18.240
So then you start looking for all these other people that are successful and I'm

2181
02:06:18.241 --> 02:06:21.330
like,
wait,
and Michael Keaton,
but stupid fucking Yay Batman.

2182
02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:23.100
Oh I'm sorry you're not pat Barry anymore.

2183
02:06:25.060 --> 02:06:28.920
Is fucking movie won the Academy Award?
You can't.
But that's deaths people.

2184
02:06:28.950 --> 02:06:33.750
There's a lot of unbounced unhappy people and because of the Internet and people

2185
02:06:33.751 --> 02:06:37.500
making comments,
unfortunately,
you know,
it's like honking a car horn.

2186
02:06:37.530 --> 02:06:39.630
You can do it in the safety of your car cause you know,

2187
02:06:39.631 --> 02:06:42.480
it's unlikely that that guy's going to come over and actually have a physical

2188
02:06:42.481 --> 02:06:47.130
confrontation.
I think comments to me or Horn honkers they're,
they're just,

2189
02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:48.330
they're just people honk.

2190
02:06:48.450 --> 02:06:52.320
They're sitting in their underwear at home and they're just going to honk their

2191
02:06:52.321 --> 02:06:55.650
little horn there.
They didn't to throw their little negativity out there.

2192
02:06:55.830 --> 02:07:00.440
I don't know what they get out of it though.
I psychologically what?

2193
02:07:00.441 --> 02:07:05.130
What does that,
what do you get out of just typing some mean spirited bullcrap.

2194
02:07:05.340 --> 02:07:07.170
I don't get it.
They don't get anything out of it,

2195
02:07:07.171 --> 02:07:08.190
but they're not balanced people.

2196
02:07:08.191 --> 02:07:09.810
They're not thinking about what they get out of it.

2197
02:07:09.811 --> 02:07:14.040
They're not looking at their life objectively like what is the effort to reward

2198
02:07:14.041 --> 02:07:17.430
ratio to what I'm accomplishing here?
Or Am I accomplishing anything?
No,

2199
02:07:17.431 --> 02:07:22.350
they're just,
you know,

2200
02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:26.370
they go back to their shit back job on Monday morning,

2201
02:07:26.371 --> 02:07:28.380
some place that they hate where nobody likes them.
They go,

2202
02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:29.550
Ga seemed Michael Keaton,

2203
02:07:29.670 --> 02:07:33.250
how embarrassing thing back and pack I want to fuck her.

2204
02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:36.060
That's the world we live in.
And

2205
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:39.550
<v 2>it's also the world where people have a voice that never had a voice before.</v>

2206
02:07:39.551 --> 02:07:42.430
You used to have to earn your voice.
You know,

2207
02:07:42.431 --> 02:07:45.730
if you were a great writer or a great critic,

2208
02:07:45.731 --> 02:07:50.080
you were respected by all these people that went and sought out your opinions on

2209
02:07:50.081 --> 02:07:53.950
things.
And so when they read your opinion on something,
it was like,
oh,

2210
02:07:54.100 --> 02:07:56.440
well this guy is a very thoughtful,

2211
02:07:56.441 --> 02:08:01.441
well measured person and his opinion on blank will be interesting to read right

2212
02:08:01.511 --> 02:08:03.130
now.
Everybody gets to put their opinion.

2213
02:08:03.250 --> 02:08:06.610
Everybody can have an opinion about everything.
I like it though.

2214
02:08:07.030 --> 02:08:10.870
I liked it cause I think it's ultimately balancing and I think that the cult of

2215
02:08:10.871 --> 02:08:14.230
personality that comes along with celebrity,
I think is ridiculous.

2216
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:17.800
And I think this chips it down.
It brings it back down.
Look,

2217
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:19.870
this is a weird time that we live in.

2218
02:08:19.900 --> 02:08:23.470
Is it a time where someone can hack in a Jennifer Lawrence his phone and find

2219
02:08:23.471 --> 02:08:27.070
pictures of her asshole and then put those on the Internet that never existed

2220
02:08:27.071 --> 02:08:31.570
before?
Well listen,
I,
I do understand that.
You know,

2221
02:08:31.700 --> 02:08:35.560
it's a different thing and yes,
now any Joe blow can have a comment.

2222
02:08:35.590 --> 02:08:38.110
I'm cool with that.
But I think there should be accountability.

2223
02:08:38.140 --> 02:08:42.670
I hate these trolls that hide behind fake names and they're negative and they're

2224
02:08:42.671 --> 02:08:47.540
not.
If you want to be negative or positive,
you,
you should own who you are.
Yeah.

2225
02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:50.920
It should be you,
you that that should be held accountable.

2226
02:08:51.070 --> 02:08:54.280
The person that you're slamming should be able to confront you.
I think they're,

2227
02:08:54.281 --> 02:08:57.310
well,
I don't know about that because you really want to confront everybody.

2228
02:08:57.311 --> 02:08:58.810
If you're a person that's in the public,

2229
02:08:58.811 --> 02:09:02.620
I you want to confront all those different people that can talk to you,

2230
02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:04.930
you'll waste your entire life dealing with,
no,
no,
no.

2231
02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:08.440
I'm not saying that you need to confront people who are being negative,

2232
02:09:08.441 --> 02:09:11.530
but I'm saying that the person who wants to be negative out there,

2233
02:09:11.531 --> 02:09:15.850
it should be that person's name,
own,
own your negativity.
Well,

2234
02:09:15.851 --> 02:09:18.730
there's a little bit of that that's happening.
I mean that's a Facebook thing.

2235
02:09:18.731 --> 02:09:21.220
You know,
in,
in Facebook it's very difficult to have a fake name.

2236
02:09:21.550 --> 02:09:24.880
But I think that ultimately where this is leading is going to be,

2237
02:09:24.881 --> 02:09:29.260
there's a dissolving of all the boundaries between people.
People can reach you,

2238
02:09:29.470 --> 02:09:31.750
they can contact Brian Regan where they never could before.

2239
02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:35.940
People can reach you know someone and make fun of their celebrity speech there.

2240
02:09:35.941 --> 02:09:37.000
A acceptance speech.

2241
02:09:37.150 --> 02:09:40.420
People who can do things that you can get closer to you than they've ever been

2242
02:09:40.421 --> 02:09:41.410
able to do something before.

2243
02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:46.800
And I think ultimately the good thing about that is things like podcasts and

2244
02:09:46.901 --> 02:09:50.580
things like that that couldn't have existed before.
They,
they,
they,

2245
02:09:50.610 --> 02:09:55.610
they take down this like boundary between people expressing themselves and then

2246
02:09:56.351 --> 02:09:58.780
expression being reached by other people.
You know,

2247
02:09:58.781 --> 02:10:00.670
if someone has really funny tweets,

2248
02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:04.870
they're really funny Twitter person that those really funny tweets can get

2249
02:10:04.871 --> 02:10:07.480
spread around and all of a sudden they have 100,000 followers.

2250
02:10:07.481 --> 02:10:10.540
There's a lot of people like that.
They're just regular folks or regular jobs,

2251
02:10:10.541 --> 02:10:14.260
but they're really funny.
And so this,
this,
this,
just by quality,

2252
02:10:14.410 --> 02:10:17.980
just by people,
they're their ideas resonating with people.

2253
02:10:17.981 --> 02:10:20.110
They have a vehicle that never existed before,

2254
02:10:20.260 --> 02:10:22.060
so it doesn't always have to be negative.

2255
02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:26.650
I think it's just so many people are disenchanted and they just don't like life

2256
02:10:26.651 --> 02:10:28.990
and they're just depressed and they don't like their existence.

2257
02:10:29.230 --> 02:10:33.230
And so they're looking to like shit on people and spread negativity as much as

2258
02:10:33.231 --> 02:10:34.064
possible.

2259
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:39.130
But what it shows is just that this vehicle exists and it doesn't just exist for

2260
02:10:39.201 --> 02:10:43.910
that exist for positivity.
That's true.
People aren't aware.

2261
02:10:43.911 --> 02:10:45.350
This is a new thing,
man.

2262
02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:48.560
This is something that we're navigating for the first time in human history.

2263
02:10:48.980 --> 02:10:50.690
And this is never existed before.

2264
02:10:50.691 --> 02:10:54.320
The ability to believe a youtube comment have the ability to have a,

2265
02:10:54.450 --> 02:10:56.510
a fake Twitter handle.
That's just an egg.

2266
02:10:56.730 --> 02:10:59.420
They can shit all over Brian Regan after a show.
Yeah.

2267
02:10:59.421 --> 02:11:02.480
You don't think hypnotizing these rail anyway,
I call,

2268
02:11:02.570 --> 02:11:05.090
how do you think I like fucking 50 pounds?
The question marketing,

2269
02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:07.170
I mean that's just,
that's it's,

2270
02:11:07.190 --> 02:11:11.630
it's a symptom of this new age that we live in,

2271
02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:16.040
that this,
this stage where technology as it's advancing,

2272
02:11:16.220 --> 02:11:19.610
it's advanced to this completely new realm that never existed before.

2273
02:11:19.850 --> 02:11:23.390
Where the ability to communicate with people is unprecedented.

2274
02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:27.050
The ability to reach people is unprecedented and we're navigating it.
We don't,

2275
02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:29.510
we don't know.
We don't know how to manage it yet,

2276
02:11:29.540 --> 02:11:31.310
and there's a lot of people that,
you know,

2277
02:11:31.340 --> 02:11:34.310
they're not thinking about what the impact of their words are.

2278
02:11:34.460 --> 02:11:37.700
They're just being idiots and they're,
you know,
they're not,
they're thoughtful.

2279
02:11:37.701 --> 02:11:39.560
They're not,
they're not really considering it.

2280
02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:44.950
This is a part of the weird world that we're living in the world of connectivity

2281
02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:49.010
and it's going to get crazier and crazier.
This is just one step.

2282
02:11:49.250 --> 02:11:50.270
This was one step.

2283
02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:54.140
There's going to be a time in the future where I believe we're going to be able

2284
02:11:54.141 --> 02:11:58.550
to communicate not just with words on a screen,
but with someone.

2285
02:11:58.580 --> 02:12:00.590
People are going to be able to express feelings to you.

2286
02:12:00.591 --> 02:12:03.800
They're gonna never be able to express emotions to you without even knowing you

2287
02:12:03.801 --> 02:12:07.520
and being around you and things are gonna get real weird over the next few
years.

2288
02:12:07.850 --> 02:12:10.970
Real weird.
They're not going to slow down.
They're going to speed up.

2289
02:12:10.971 --> 02:12:13.850
We're not going to move to log cabins and start chopping around firewood.

2290
02:12:14.050 --> 02:12:18.110
It's going to get weirder and weirder.
Goodnight everybody.
Brian Reagan,

2291
02:12:18.111 --> 02:12:19.070
ladies and gentlemen.

2292
02:12:20.930 --> 02:12:24.830
Brian Regan comic on Twitter.
What's your show this weekend?

2293
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:29.840
I'm at the Dolby theater.
A Nla this Saturday night.

2294
02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:33.340
What time was this show?
8:00 PM.
That's the same time as the UFC.

2295
02:12:33.341 --> 02:12:37.280
Was the UFC in vi?
In La at the staple center?
Well,

2296
02:12:38.300 --> 02:12:39.860
I'm not saying it's bad.
I mean people are going to see you.

2297
02:12:39.861 --> 02:12:44.630
They could DVR the UFC.
Yeah.
You brought up the UFC either way.
Either way.

2298
02:12:44.631 --> 02:12:48.140
The Dolby theater,
ladies and gentlemen,
mass the place to be on Saturday night.

2299
02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:52.320
Fuck to you up saying I said I worked for them.
I'll be there.

2300
02:12:52.970 --> 02:12:56.760
Dolby theater Saturday night,
uh,
on Twitter.
Brian Regan comments.

2301
02:12:56.761 --> 02:12:57.930
He talked to people on Twitter.
Do you,

2302
02:12:57.931 --> 02:13:01.220
do you interact with the folks from your conversation?

2303
02:13:01.221 --> 02:13:05.960
I might need to adjust my,
my way of doing it right now it's been,

2304
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:09.710
it's been kind of one sided.
I don't tweet a lot,
but it's just me tweeting out.

2305
02:13:10.220 --> 02:13:13.820
But you don't usually like read the tweets and then respond.
No,
I know.

2306
02:13:13.821 --> 02:13:16.100
I probably smarter.
It's probably a smart way to do it.

2307
02:13:16.490 --> 02:13:18.980
My way is probably ridiculous.
No,
I didn't.

2308
02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:23.960
I just tweet out and then we'll go make a milkshake.
Here's what's important.

2309
02:13:23.961 --> 02:13:26.120
You fucking hilarious.
You're a great guy.

2310
02:13:26.121 --> 02:13:27.620
It's always a pleasure to hang out with you.

2311
02:13:27.621 --> 02:13:30.980
Always a pleasure to have you on the podcast.
Never Seen Brian Regan live.

2312
02:13:31.020 --> 02:13:34.260
Please go check him out.
He's fucking absolutely one of the best in the country.

2313
02:13:34.290 --> 02:13:38.610
You're very nice.
Thank you so much ladies and gentlemen.
Dolby theater,

2314
02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:43.260
Los Angeles,
California,
Saturday night.
Be there.
Good.
I see you.
Bye.

2315
02:13:50.860 --> 02:13:51.693
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2316
02:13:53.230 --> 02:13:54.063
<v 2>Hm.</v>

2317
02:13:55.550 --> 02:13:55.600
<v 7>Okay.</v>
