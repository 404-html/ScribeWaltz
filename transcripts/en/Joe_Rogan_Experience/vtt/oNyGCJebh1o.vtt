00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freak bitches</v>

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.090
<v Speaker 2>call this patternicity the tendency to</v>
<v Speaker 2>find meaningful patterns in both</v>

3
00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:09.210
<v Speaker 2>meaningful and meaningless noise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my thought experiment is imagine</v>

4
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:10.800
<v Speaker 2>you're a hominid on the plains of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa,</v>

5
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:14.100
<v Speaker 2>three and a half million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>small brain Australopithecine and your</v>

6
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:16.980
<v Speaker 2>name is Lucy and you hear a rustle in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the grass.</v>

7
00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:19.500
<v Speaker 2>Is that a dangerous Predator or is it</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the wind?</v>

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.070
<v Speaker 2>So if you assume that the rustle in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>grass is a dangerous Predator and it</v>

9
00:00:23.071 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Speaker 2>turns out it's just the wind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a type one error,</v>

10
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:27.750
<v Speaker 2>a false positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you thought a was connected to be but</v>

11
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:30.750
<v Speaker 2>but no harm you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just become skittish and conscious</v>

12
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:32.700
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you assume that the rustle in the</v>

13
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:36.390
<v Speaker 2>grass is just the wind and it turns out</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a dangerous Predator,</v>

14
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 2>your lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've just been given a Darwin award</v>

15
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:41.730
<v Speaker 2>for taking yourself out of the gene pool</v>
<v Speaker 2>early before reproducing.</v>

16
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 2>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's better to just assume that all</v>

17
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 2>things you think are connected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all rustle in the grass are dangerous</v>

18
00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:52.350
<v Speaker 2>predators and not the wind just in case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's not.</v>

19
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.080
<v Speaker 2>There's not a big cost to pay for making</v>
<v Speaker 2>a type one error,</v>

20
00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 2>a false positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a higher cost for making a type</v>

21
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:01.770
<v Speaker 2>two error or false negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we assume that this is the basis of</v>

22
00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:05.610
<v Speaker 2>superstition and magical thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just assume that this is connected to</v>

23
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:07.920
<v Speaker 2>that you pull the slot and you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pull the slot machine,</v>

24
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 2>you win or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what skinner show back in</v>

25
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:15.150
<v Speaker 2>the fifties where you just randomly give</v>
<v Speaker 2>reinforcements to rats and pigeons and</v>

26
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.640
<v Speaker 2>whatever they were doing just before</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got rewarded.</v>

27
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.670
<v Speaker 2>They'll just repeat that behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's like twirling</v>

28
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.360
<v Speaker 2>counterclockwise twice or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the basis of superstition is</v>

29
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.850
<v Speaker 2>nothing wrong with their brains.</v>

30
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.690
<v Speaker 2>They're just trying to find causal</v>
<v Speaker 2>connections between events in the</v>

31
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:33.780
<v Speaker 2>environment and that's the basis of</v>
<v Speaker 2>survival.</v>

32
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.870
<v Speaker 2>So all of us are subject to making those</v>
<v Speaker 2>connections,</v>

33
00:01:37.871 --> 00:01:40.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are more gullible than others.</v>

34
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:41.130
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are more skeptical,</v>

35
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of us can easily be fooled if it's</v>

36
00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 2>done right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

37
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 2>that's the beauty of good cons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good scams is that anybody could fall</v>

38
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 2>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even smart people.</v>

39
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.660
<v Speaker 2>And if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smart people are more likely to believe</v>

40
00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 2>weird things in this sense that once</v>
<v Speaker 2>they believe it,</v>

41
00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:01.170
<v Speaker 2>they think they've drawn a connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're better at rationalizing the</v>

42
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 2>reasons why they believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then say less educated or less</v>

43
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:07.290
<v Speaker 2>intelligent people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so was people like Panacek will tell</v>

44
00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 2>you there's nothing better than an</v>
<v Speaker 2>audience of scientists at Mit.</v>

45
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can really fool them.</v>

46
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they think they're so smart.</v>

47
00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:17.220
<v Speaker 2>I can't be full to wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

48
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:21.900
<v Speaker 2>He must be doing something really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really super psychic because I'm super</v>

49
00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:22.734
<v Speaker 2>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

50
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.890
<v Speaker 2>Well no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because all of our sensory apparatus</v>

51
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:28.200
<v Speaker 2>works the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And magicians know how to manipulate</v>

52
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.440
<v Speaker 2>your gaze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your attention,</v>

53
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.770
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and had a fool.</v>

54
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:32.120
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

55
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.430
<v Speaker 1>What made him think it was big foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit?</v>

56
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>smell it.</v>

57
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Smell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the bear had fucking a bad fish or</v>

58
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:48.020
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't even agree on what it eats.</v>

59
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.840
<v Speaker 1>There were so sure as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't agree.</v>

60
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.850
<v Speaker 1>They can agree on what bigfoot eats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

61
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck discovered that big foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit?</v>

62
00:02:55.791 --> 00:02:58.550
<v Speaker 1>We gotta find that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met that I met.</v>

63
00:02:58.551 --> 00:03:01.670
<v Speaker 1>That dude found the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a conversation with him too.</v>

64
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a teacher in a school.</v>

65
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Where did he find school teacher in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oregon?</v>

66
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Funding out in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

67
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 1>this got to be big bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take it with me.</v>

68
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.680
<v Speaker 1>I would think big food with lay logs</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this big as my thigh.</v>

69
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Just giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever see an elephant?</v>

70
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Take Shit and you see his ass hole open</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and he'd go,</v>

71
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>good Lord.</v>

72
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Just flopping out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a giant asshole.</v>

73
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.530
<v Speaker 1>That's what I imagined for pig foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe that there?</v>

74
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people believe in bigfoot,</v>

75
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 1>but they also believe in a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of big foot.</v>

76
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:39.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like a different kind of like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian church,</v>

77
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>like a Lutheran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They believe.</v>

78
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We believe in bigfoot,</v>

79
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.410
<v Speaker 1>but we believe it's an interdimensional</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

80
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.130
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the chances of that</v>

81
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>being around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably 100 percent.</v>

82
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Not just big flood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe.</v>

83
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.220
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

84
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.300
<v Speaker 1>I got to stop right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

85
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm one eighth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>native American,</v>

86
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 1>my grandmother's side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are our people.</v>

87
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Our people have long known of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence of what we call the old Ma</v>

88
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 1>with a bunch of different names for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new name.</v>

89
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Every time I go up to Oregon or</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington or do a seminar,</v>

90
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:24.751
<v Speaker 1>I asked the guys by show of hands who</v>
<v Speaker 1>believes in bigfoot and most of them do.</v>

91
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

92
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.670
<v Speaker 1>most of them have heard stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.670
<v Speaker 1>I believed in it for the longest time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't disbelieve in it today.</v>

94
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't disbelieve it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's one you can make fun of.</v>

95
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 1>But I found big foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be like,</v>

96
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:40.480
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

97
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's real.</v>

98
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 1>I definitely don't just believe in it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know what?</v>

99
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.640
<v Speaker 1>And I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just say it.</v>

100
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe he isn't or dimensional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

101
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.560
<v Speaker 1>That's how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my gut feeling.</v>

102
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.530
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The things that are going on that are</v>

103
00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:59.320
<v Speaker 1>getting covered up and nobody's talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about like in the film,</v>

104
00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:02.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you saw that drug that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was made in the United States.</v>

105
00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:06.040
<v Speaker 1>It was tainted with AIDS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was tainted with the Aids virus and</v>

106
00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:06.850
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

107
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.650
<v Speaker 1>well we can't lose this big batch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>

108
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.610
<v Speaker 1>Let's send it to France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is.</v>

109
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 1>How does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that though.</v>

110
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.710
<v Speaker 1>How does the AIDS virus get into that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

111
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.690
<v Speaker 1>what is the AIDS virus?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about?</v>

112
00:05:19.691 --> 00:05:21.520
<v Speaker 1>HIV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

113
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's where the news report says</v>

114
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:26.210
<v Speaker 1>and say this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say that news report was all greening.</v>

115
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.190
<v Speaker 1>It was from 1985.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might not know what the fuck they</v>

116
00:05:29.191 --> 00:05:32.070
<v Speaker 1>were talking about now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would definitely was something that I</v>

117
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.180
<v Speaker 1>wanted was a head scratcher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually have a guy,</v>

118
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.990
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy that works at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marks Jim just got his phd and he was</v>

119
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:41.320
<v Speaker 1>going to go work for the company bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a company that sold.</v>

120
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.610
<v Speaker 1>They bear aspirin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

121
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.100
<v Speaker 1>That's a company that did it and I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things he was.</v>

122
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.020
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about this like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I want to work for a</v>

123
00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:48.250
<v Speaker 1>company like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

124
00:05:48.251 --> 00:05:51.490
<v Speaker 1>We need to snopes that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snopes that before you put it in the</v>

125
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.480
<v Speaker 1>documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

126
00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

127
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.930
<v Speaker 1>we have a big team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tastes tasted a few of those.</v>

128
00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 3>When we do these documentaries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have.</v>

129
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.750
<v Speaker 3>Look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to fact check everything.</v>

130
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.010
<v Speaker 3>Make that a little larger please.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here it goes.</v>

131
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.610
<v Speaker 3>Recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unearth documents show that the drug</v>

132
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 3>company beer sold millions of dollars'</v>
<v Speaker 3>worth of injectable blood clotting</v>

133
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:13.670
<v Speaker 3>medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Factor eight,</v>

134
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.020
<v Speaker 3>concentrate intended for haemophiliacs</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Asian Latin American in some European</v>

135
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:21.740
<v Speaker 3>countries in the mid 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although they knew it was tainted with</v>

136
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:22.920
<v Speaker 3>aids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

137
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.400
<v Speaker 3>that's what I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how something and aids go together.</v>

138
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:28.620
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense</v>
<v Speaker 3>for you.</v>

139
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 3>This article is 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the company stopped selling the drug in</v>

140
00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:36.860
<v Speaker 3>the United States in 1984,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but continue to sell it overseas for an</v>

141
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.740
<v Speaker 3>additional year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The medicine was made using a combined.</v>

142
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:40.603
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

143
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.350
<v Speaker 3>Plasma from large numbers of donors and</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the time there was no screening test</v>

144
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:49.010
<v Speaker 3>for eight for the aids virus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so a tiny number of donors with AIDS</v>

145
00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:52.220
<v Speaker 3>could inadvertently contaminate a large</v>
<v Speaker 3>batch.</v>

146
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.450
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they continue to sell the medicine</v>

147
00:06:56.451 --> 00:07:00.710
<v Speaker 3>overseas in an attempt to avoid being</v>
<v Speaker 3>left with a large stock of a drug that</v>

148
00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:02.510
<v Speaker 3>was no longer marketable in the United</v>
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>

149
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.880
<v Speaker 4>I have been so obsessed with this lately</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this,</v>

150
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.370
<v Speaker 4>and I know that I have like probably</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've talked about this before,</v>

151
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.730
<v Speaker 4>I talk to people probably get sick of me</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about it,</v>

152
00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:16.731
<v Speaker 4>but this concept of stressing your body</v>
<v Speaker 4>stressing exercise,</v>

153
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.870
<v Speaker 4>most people think exercise is good</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the exercise itself is good.</v>

154
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.160
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the exercise of this exact exercise</v>

155
00:07:23.161 --> 00:07:25.470
<v Speaker 4>itself is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's actually very stressful on your</v>

156
00:07:25.471 --> 00:07:26.720
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

157
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.090
<v Speaker 4>what's good is the stress response.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The body.</v>

158
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:35.330
<v Speaker 4>We've got a hard wired genetic program</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is conserved in plants,</v>

159
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.060
<v Speaker 4>insects,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bacteria,</v>

160
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:40.140
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

161
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.640
<v Speaker 4>primates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>humans,</v>

162
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:42.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

163
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.840
<v Speaker 4>we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we all have this response to stress.</v>

164
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:50.580
<v Speaker 4>And that response is to try to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need know I need to stay alive,</v>

165
00:07:50.581 --> 00:07:53.340
<v Speaker 4>pass on my genes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously the stress response is much</v>

166
00:07:53.341 --> 00:07:58.341
<v Speaker 4>stronger younger when you're younger or</v>
<v Speaker 4>the earlier in life because your body</v>

167
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.390
<v Speaker 4>knows you're not old enough to reproduce</v>
<v Speaker 4>for whatever,</v>

168
00:08:03.391 --> 00:08:04.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hormones and things like that.</v>

169
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.170
<v Speaker 4>They're not being produced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

170
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:11.970
<v Speaker 4>so the stress response,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like exercise causes stress,</v>

171
00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.680
<v Speaker 4>thermal stress,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like heat cold,</v>

172
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.660
<v Speaker 4>and then there's all these compounds in</v>
<v Speaker 4>plants that are stressful to us that can</v>

173
00:08:18.661 --> 00:08:21.600
<v Speaker 4>induce this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's almost like the brain is</v>

174
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:25.110
<v Speaker 4>preparing for the next time it's going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to encounter stress.</v>

175
00:08:25.111 --> 00:08:25.651
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

176
00:08:25.651 --> 00:08:28.230
<v Speaker 4>this is war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to gather up the troops,</v>

177
00:08:28.231 --> 00:08:30.690
<v Speaker 4>I gotta get this army.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to assemble this army because</v>

178
00:08:30.691 --> 00:08:32.940
<v Speaker 4>that stress is going to happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to be ready for war.</v>

179
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.590
<v Speaker 4>So it Kinda makes sense that you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have a very profound and</v>

180
00:08:37.591 --> 00:08:40.710
<v Speaker 4>positive effect in your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also in other parts of the body.</v>

181
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

182
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 4>the exercise itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

183
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.140
<v Speaker 4>it's funny because a lot of people do it</v>
<v Speaker 4>to lose weight or to mostly to lose</v>

184
00:08:49.141 --> 00:08:53.310
<v Speaker 4>weight or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>become sexually attractive muscle mass,</v>

185
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.340
<v Speaker 4>which has other very important effects.</v>

186
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 4>But people do it because they want to</v>
<v Speaker 4>look good,</v>

187
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.610
<v Speaker 4>and honestly a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are a lot of people that say,</v>

188
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:04.410
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exercise doesn't really play an</v>

189
00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:06.170
<v Speaker 4>important role in losing weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's nutrition.</v>

190
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.270
<v Speaker 4>You know what the right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but exercise has a very important role</v>

191
00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:14.271
<v Speaker 4>and that role is to to cause your body</v>
<v Speaker 4>stress so that you activate all these</v>

192
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:19.110
<v Speaker 4>really good and awesome jeans that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>helping you deal with stress.</v>

193
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 4>And guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stress is happening right now.</v>

194
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.110
<v Speaker 4>Every time you breathe in oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your making stress,</v>

195
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're generating byproducts that are</v>

196
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:29.360
<v Speaker 4>very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

197
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:30.820
<v Speaker 4>so exercise is good.</v>
