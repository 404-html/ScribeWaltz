<v Speaker 1>Try My day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.493
<v Speaker 1>People love both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting like people love your </v>

3
00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:08.914
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people also love like shit talking </v>

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.000
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] people love Nate Diaz for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

5
00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:15.220
<v Speaker 1>And people love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they love the drama,</v>

6
00:00:15.221 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>but they also love someone like you walk</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to holly and hug her.</v>

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.833
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Middle though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I get a lot of flack for,</v>

9
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mouth like,</v>

10
00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:26.050
<v Speaker 2>so you just can't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say what I'm thinking and I'm,</v>

11
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty transparent and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>people think that,</v>

12
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get a lot of flag,</v>

13
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.890
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fake or this.</v>

14
00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:32.390
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really,</v>

15
00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:33.081
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because,</v>

16
00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:33.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

17
00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:35.630
<v Speaker 2>I'll say this like I'm a fan of connor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>

18
00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:36.840
<v Speaker 2>I like his fighting style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

19
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:37.311
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

20
00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:39.380
<v Speaker 2>his antics at first were kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

21
00:00:39.381 --> 00:00:40.310
<v Speaker 2>who is this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

22
00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:41.450
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm like,</v>

23
00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:43.070
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>props to him.</v>

24
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.180
<v Speaker 2>He's done amazing things like good for </v>
<v Speaker 2>him and he's done really good things for</v>

25
00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:49.490
<v Speaker 2>our sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you didn't show up to film that</v>

26
00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:51.490
<v Speaker 2>commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not getting,</v>

27
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be honest,</v>

28
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.383
<v Speaker 2>like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of rubbed me the wrong way </v>

29
00:00:54.141 --> 00:00:56.000
<v Speaker 2>because um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are like,</v>

30
00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:58.040
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he does so much more media than you guys</v>

31
00:00:58.041 --> 00:00:58.400
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

32
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.233
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably does.</v>

33
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably does.</v>

34
00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:01.820
<v Speaker 2>I do a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He probably does more.</v>

35
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:02.773
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't have a private jet flying </v>

36
00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:07.640
<v Speaker 2>out to pick me up and bring me back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fly 20 people in my crew with me too.</v>

37
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.533
<v Speaker 2>He does more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he gets more when they bring them to </v>

38
00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:11.390
<v Speaker 2>Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put them up in a penthouse,</v>

39
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:13.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make sure he has everything that he</v>

40
00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:14.330
<v Speaker 2>needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get that.</v>

41
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.710
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

42
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's earned that.</v>

43
00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:18.980
<v Speaker 2>He's in that spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No problem with that.</v>

44
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.590
<v Speaker 2>But I think three months out from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight camp,</v>

45
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.513
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a private jet coming to pick </v>

46
00:01:23.181 --> 00:01:25.390
<v Speaker 2>you up with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can bring 20 of your teammates.</v>

47
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.263
<v Speaker 2>You could probably work out on the jet </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to on the way there because </v>

48
00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:29.780
<v Speaker 2>it's yours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's private.</v>

49
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

50
00:01:31.011 --> 00:01:32.450
<v Speaker 2>You could probably hit mitts on a jet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

51
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.710
<v Speaker 2>you could totally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

52
00:01:33.711 --> 00:01:37.130
<v Speaker 2>You're three months out and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to show for your media obligations.</v>

53
00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't really understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it just,</v>

54
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:43.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'm trying to figure it out,</v>

55
00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:46.550
<v Speaker 2>but the only issue that I had and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't bother me.</v>

56
00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Like if he didn't want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's his own thing.</v>

57
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.303
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that I showed up the day to film the </v>

58
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:51.944
<v Speaker 2>commercial and I had two segments I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to film and that's all it was </v>

59
00:01:54.621 --> 00:01:56.360
<v Speaker 2>on my schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they asked me like,</v>

60
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.693
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you please help us out because </v>

61
00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:00.734
<v Speaker 2>Connor's not here and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know what we're doing for this </v>

62
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.960
<v Speaker 2>third segment of the commercial that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be conor and nate.</v>

63
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.100
<v Speaker 2>So can you please come back later that </v>
<v Speaker 2>day and film that segment.</v>

64
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.680
<v Speaker 2>And also with that was during my </v>
<v Speaker 2>practice time,</v>

65
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.510
<v Speaker 2>so I had to come back and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it.</v>

66
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.500
<v Speaker 2>So it was a company woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like it was just frustrating because</v>

67
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:19.760
<v Speaker 2>it's like Dang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

68
00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:20.594
<v Speaker 2>if I had known about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could've planned my training </v>

69
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:22.814
<v Speaker 2>otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now I kind of have to like scramble </v>

70
00:02:23.841 --> 00:02:26.030
<v Speaker 2>to get my second workout in and then it </v>
<v Speaker 2>affected me.</v>

71
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.040
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his decision did,</v>

72
00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:29.450
<v Speaker 2>and it probably is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

73
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.000
<v Speaker 2>I haven't made any more money in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sport yet because of Connor.</v>

74
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:34.160
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people like to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh you must have got a bigger payday.</v>

75
00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Cause I'll ask them like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

76
00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:35.984
<v Speaker 2>cause I wasn't the champion so I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get any more of like and get any paper </v>

77
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.280
<v Speaker 2>views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get any more money.</v>

78
00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:42.130
<v Speaker 2>And now he's like not on this fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>card.</v>

79
00:02:42.131 --> 00:02:43.700
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

80
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:44.660
<v Speaker 2>but it's where ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

81
00:02:44.661 --> 00:02:46.340
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's connors deal and,</v>

82
00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:46.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

83
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't hate connor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I going to say how I feel,</v>

84
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.223
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say it if he was sitting </v>

85
00:02:51.711 --> 00:02:52.580
<v Speaker 2>here to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

86
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.710
<v Speaker 2>why did you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd probably,</v>

87
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.410
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

88
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.410
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's a bunch of issues </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and we know,</v>

89
00:02:58.411 --> 00:02:59.244
<v Speaker 1>and the only way to really get a firm </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of it is to sit down with </v>

90
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>everyone involved and say what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicated your manager,</v>

91
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:07.594
<v Speaker 1>did he know what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the appearance schedule was going </v>

92
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you guys agree to this?</v>

93
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 1>Did you understand what you were getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>into when you're fighting?</v>

94
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a misunderstanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say,</v>

96
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 1>but it's the way he went about it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

97
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm retired,</v>

98
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 1>thanks for the cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then saying I'm not retired.</v>

99
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:24.690
<v Speaker 1>And then saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

100
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad the UFC decided to give the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fans what they want and be a,</v>

101
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be on UFC 200 numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

102
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.403
<v Speaker 1>And so like what he's doing is he's kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like using the media to try to get </v>

103
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:38.224
<v Speaker 1>this thing to pass through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't understand Dana and </v>

104
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Lorenzo and frank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's never going to work.</v>

105
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Like you're you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're either in or you're not in.</v>

106
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like real clear about that.</v>

107
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 1>They have to set a precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if you say fuck you,</v>

108
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they kind of go,</v>

109
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.411
<v Speaker 1>oh well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

110
00:03:56.411 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not fighting.</v>

111
00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on,</v>

112
00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:01.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm conor mcgregor where the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

113
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.230
<v Speaker 1>this is what it is.</v>

114
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 2>Made my new stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll make many more.</v>

115
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:04.800
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

116
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.530
<v Speaker 1>And we might lose millions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not on UFC 200</v>

117
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.380
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he,</v>

118
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.410
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had put,</v>

119
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.830
<v Speaker 2>they put 10 million ended up promoting </v>
<v Speaker 2>this Saturday tonight and he's like,</v>

120
00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:14.820
<v Speaker 2>we're way over budget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

121
00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:15.654
<v Speaker 2>So that's why he's was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to show up and do you know </v>

122
00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 2>that's how connor was made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

123
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.551
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That stuff.</v>

124
00:04:20.551 --> 00:04:21.384
<v Speaker 2>So now like at what point do you get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide that you don't have to do that </v>

125
00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:26.550
<v Speaker 2>anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if that's what made you who you are</v>

126
00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:28.380
<v Speaker 2>like I mean don't you kind of have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

127
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.830
<v Speaker 2>does that make sense what I'm saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>

128
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.473
<v Speaker 2>I mean at what point do you get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide like when you don't have to like </v>

129
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.153
<v Speaker 2>I use the machine and now like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to hop off now that I'm </v>

130
00:04:38.401 --> 00:04:39.070
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

131
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.903
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

132
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.750
<v Speaker 2>So you kind of have to keep it the same</v>

133
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.320
<v Speaker 1>boys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

134
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:46.030
<v Speaker 1>But there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is also like a fine line,</v>

135
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:47.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can do too much.</v>

136
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was watching the Josie Aldo </v>
<v Speaker 1>media tour,</v>

137
00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:52.030
<v Speaker 1>when they were going all around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

138
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:52.864
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

139
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.530
<v Speaker 1>I understand that you want to promote </v>
<v Speaker 1>this fight.</v>

140
00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:57.364
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how much of this is helping the </v>

141
00:04:58.781 --> 00:04:59.614
<v Speaker 1>actual fight itself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of it is just conor mcgregor </v>

142
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:02.884
<v Speaker 1>constantly talking Shit at press </v>
<v Speaker 1>conferences and grabbing the belt and </v>

143
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:05.990
<v Speaker 1>all that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

144
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really kind of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling the fight was that,</v>

145
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a lot of it,</v>

146
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:13.990
<v Speaker 1>but apparently connor was sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was like,</v>

147
00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:17.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm just constantly fighting off a cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to get in shape,</v>

148
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:19.660
<v Speaker 1>really hard to train because every week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

149
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:21.850
<v Speaker 1>you're traveling from here to there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there to here.</v>

150
00:05:21.851 --> 00:05:22.684
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're constantly getting beaten down </v>

151
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.630
<v Speaker 1>and you know what it's like if I give </v>
<v Speaker 1>you up.</v>

152
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever flown to Brazil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fought?</v>

153
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.950
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fall in there for fight cards though.</v>

154
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.180
<v Speaker 1>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

155
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.920
<v Speaker 1>the furthest you've ever had a flight of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight?</v>

156
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>

157
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.850
<v Speaker 1>So that's an interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's a long flight.</v>

158
00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:38.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like 16 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

159
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it,</v>

160
00:05:38.741 --> 00:05:39.131
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

161
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:39.964
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

162
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.100
<v Speaker 1>like adjusting and then competing?</v>

163
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.173
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to start adjusting my schedule at </v>

164
00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:46.414
<v Speaker 2>home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like blacking out my windows a little </v>

165
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:48.310
<v Speaker 2>bit or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to,</v>

166
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 2>to make the timeframe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you've never get fully adjusted.</v>

167
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:52.810
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mind frame is like when,</v>

168
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.730
<v Speaker 2>when push comes to shove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when fight time comes,</v>

169
00:05:54.731 --> 00:05:57.040
<v Speaker 2>well that's two in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my time or not like I'm going to be,</v>

170
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 2>so I would just look at it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's not fun.</v>

171
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember three weeks out from my fight</v>

172
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 2>with written to Chi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I didn't even want to,</v>

173
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.060
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to do that fight because </v>
<v Speaker 2>she was so unknown.</v>

174
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.953
<v Speaker 2>She was undefeated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going over there to like fight on a </v>

175
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 2>newly blooming fight pass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

176
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.770
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feels like it does nothing for me.</v>

177
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:16.860
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if she wins it,</v>

178
00:06:16.861 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 2>springboards her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

179
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:20.600
<v Speaker 2>then she'll be 17 to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shove a judo background,</v>

180
00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:22.070
<v Speaker 2>they're going to want to make that fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

181
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.120
<v Speaker 2>for her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Rhonda,</v>

182
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.130
<v Speaker 2>I know that's what they're trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>is they're trying to use,</v>

183
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.323
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>business use me as that springboard and </v>

184
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 2>was like I don't really want to spend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it.</v>

185
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.733
<v Speaker 2>But three weeks before the fight they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had me fly to Japan to do some </v>

186
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:36.620
<v Speaker 2>promotional stuff and I was flying </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer than I was even on the ground.</v>

187
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.890
<v Speaker 2>And they said like ticket sales went up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything was really good.</v>

188
00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:41.750
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was exhausting.</v>

189
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 2>So I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that.</v>

190
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hard.</v>

191
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're peaking right really hard.</v>

192
00:06:46.961 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Ramping it up three weeks</v>

193
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.380
<v Speaker 2>for hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And after my fight with the holly,</v>

194
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:52.214
<v Speaker 2>like I got to spend a little time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia and then I went straight from </v>

195
00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Australia to New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spent a day there,</v>

196
00:06:56.841 --> 00:07:00.530
<v Speaker 2>did a full day of media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to Connecticut to espn,</v>

197
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:02.000
<v Speaker 2>did a full day of media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to Toronto,</v>

198
00:07:02.001 --> 00:07:03.350
<v Speaker 2>did a full day meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just like,</v>

199
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.880
<v Speaker 2>it's non stop from like you start your </v>
<v Speaker 2>first interview at eight in the morning,</v>

200
00:07:08.881 --> 00:07:09.714
<v Speaker 2>so you'll pick up at like seven and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>go until seven at night and even while </v>

201
00:07:14.091 --> 00:07:16.940
<v Speaker 2>you're driving to the next place they'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you on the phone.</v>

202
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.620
<v Speaker 2>Was with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>

203
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:19.550
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

204
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:20.990

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

205
00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:22.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all,</v>

206
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.740
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty intense.</v>

207
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty exhausting site.</v>

208
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.540
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have been in those shoes before,</v>

209
00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:31.610
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

210
00:07:31.611 --> 00:07:32.570
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

211
00:07:32.571 --> 00:07:34.940
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's more extended research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he was hurt or something.</v>

212
00:07:34.941 --> 00:07:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you didn't want people to see like</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>

213
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what if there's even something like</v>

214
00:07:38.871 --> 00:07:39.321
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

215
00:07:39.321 --> 00:07:40.154
<v Speaker 2>what if he had like hurt himself or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and he didn't want like nate </v>

216
00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:42.764
<v Speaker 2>to know.</v>

217
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

218
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.480
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

219
00:07:45.481 --> 00:07:46.314
<v Speaker 1>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also had to realize there was a lot </v>

220
00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:50.220
<v Speaker 1>of work that needed to be done to beat </v>
<v Speaker 1>nate.</v>

221
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's hit nate with some of his best</v>

222
00:07:52.771 --> 00:07:56.670
<v Speaker 1>shots and nate was fine with it and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a real problem.</v>

223
00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.043
<v Speaker 2>That's more what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that he was just obsessed with </v>

224
00:07:59.371 --> 00:08:00.270
<v Speaker 2>beating nay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

225
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.163
<v Speaker 2>I get that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't take that away from him for a </v>

226
00:08:02.851 --> 00:08:03.684
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he wanted to stay home and he was </v>

227
00:08:05.041 --> 00:08:08.100
<v Speaker 2>in Iceland I guess training and he wants</v>
<v Speaker 2>to train to be nate.</v>

228
00:08:08.101 --> 00:08:09.810
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Totally get it.</v>

229
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it too.</v>

230
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.000
<v Speaker 1>It seems like the only way also I felt </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

231
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.680
<v Speaker 1>but then again he could have brought his</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole gym with him,</v>

232
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was going to be a difficult </v>

233
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.880
<v Speaker 1>time just trying to find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

234
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.600
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moments to train and do,</v>

235
00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:24.434
<v Speaker 1>stay in shape and then obviously being </v>
<v Speaker 1>exhausted from flying and all that jazz </v>

236
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.140
<v Speaker 1>quick turnaround too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

237
00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:30.974
<v Speaker 1>like as far as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he was supposed to be </v>

238
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:32.984
<v Speaker 1>there more than like two days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I honestly think he's better off not </v>

239
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:36.314
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I honestly think he's better off like </v>

240
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:42.740
<v Speaker 1>sequestering himself for a few months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like really focusing on what went wrong,</v>

241
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.320
<v Speaker 1>how to correct it and can you correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

242
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean do you like when it comes to the </v>

243
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:50.810
<v Speaker 1>ground game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I saw on the ground,</v>

244
00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:52.760
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy this is a long road.</v>

245
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Like you've got a long road to beat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy like nate,</v>

246
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.550
<v Speaker 1>he's so much further along in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

247
00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.710
<v Speaker 1>in ground and pound Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>positioning everything.</v>

248
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.590
<v Speaker 1>When I was watching nate beat him up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground and choke him,</v>

249
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:05.424
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

250
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.650
<v Speaker 1>that happened quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not like a,</v>

251
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.493
<v Speaker 1>like Weidman and rockhold was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>prolonged beating before rockhold </v>

252
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:15.040
<v Speaker 1>eventually stopped him the next round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

253
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:19.980
<v Speaker 1>But with why with nate and connor wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>that prolonged.</v>

254
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:22.920
<v Speaker 1>It happened pretty quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you see that you go,</v>

255
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is going to be,</v>

256
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.943
<v Speaker 1>this is a lot to overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an unsurmountable build that </v>

257
00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:30.770
<v Speaker 1>those skill sets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't just,</v>

258
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.850
<v Speaker 1>they don't come overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

259
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.910
<v Speaker 1>he can pick up your cardio pretty quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do a lot of things.</v>

260
00:09:34.911 --> 00:09:35.744
<v Speaker 1>We can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't build a skill set any faster </v>

261
00:09:37.471 --> 00:09:40.280
<v Speaker 1>than it's going to go into your muscle </v>
<v Speaker 1>memory and being your effort.</v>

262
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.710
<v Speaker 1>You've got to put thousands of reps in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's no way around it.</v>

263
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:44.963
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way to fast forward through </v>

264
00:09:45.931 --> 00:09:47.460
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way to cut the corner.</v>

265
00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:49.230
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing.</v>

266
00:09:49.231 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 1>You can't just repetition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repetition,</v>

267
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:51.594
<v Speaker 1>repetition would also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it highlights all the various eccentric </v>

268
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:57.240
<v Speaker 1>aspects of your training that people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

269
00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.950
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this what makes connor great?</v>

270
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.193
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you know nate calling it touch </v>

271
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:02.070
<v Speaker 1>button,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the park,</v>

272
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.320
<v Speaker 1>like they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these cartwheels and stuff.</v>

273
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Then video is so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious.</v>

274
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:13.260
<v Speaker 1>My God I was dying laughing areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when this all,</v>

275
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.310
<v Speaker 1>you know he's doing all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this work with this movement guy.</v>

276
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.473
<v Speaker 1>But then you see what happens when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually comes to fighting skills and </v>

277
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.530
<v Speaker 1>you go oh maybe this is not the way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

278
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:26.783
<v Speaker 1>Cause like I've talked to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that were like this stuff that </v>

279
00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:32.820
<v Speaker 1>he's doing his utter horse shit like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

280
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.370
<v Speaker 1>doing cartwheels and being obsessed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

281
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Here's the movements you need to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about.</v>

282
00:10:37.141 --> 00:10:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving your feet,</v>

283
00:10:38.611 --> 00:10:39.444
<v Speaker 1>throwing kicks and punches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take down defense and Jujitsu on the </v>

284
00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:43.380
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

285
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding takedowns yourself,</v>

286
00:10:45.421 --> 00:10:47.670
<v Speaker 1>taking people down if you must trip </v>
<v Speaker 1>sweeps,</v>

287
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:48.533
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But all this cartwheels and what this </v>

288
00:10:51.211 --> 00:10:52.044
<v Speaker 1>guy was explaining to me and I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>name any names cause he's a prominent </v>

289
00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:54.564
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like you have to understand that </v>

290
00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:57.114
<v Speaker 1>there's a limited amount of energy you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have in your time training and you are </v>

291
00:11:01.921 --> 00:11:05.010
<v Speaker 1>not perfect at all these other aspects </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mma.</v>

292
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:06.023
<v Speaker 1>So if you are not perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these other aspects of him that you </v>

293
00:11:07.651 --> 00:11:09.600
<v Speaker 1>have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay how much?</v>

294
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of this stuff is going to help </v>

295
00:11:11.161 --> 00:11:13.050
<v Speaker 1>me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well a guy like George Saint Pierre,</v>

296
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.033
<v Speaker 1>he looked at gymnastics and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what's going to help me if I </v>

297
00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:20.340
<v Speaker 1>can be stronger physically and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no better way.</v>

298
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I think like as far as like manipulating</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>

299
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Then gymnastics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like doing the rings and developing.</v>

300
00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:27.483
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're learning how to manipulate your </v>

301
00:11:29.011 --> 00:11:31.500
<v Speaker 1>body and all kinds of contorted </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions.</v>

302
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Being upside down and understanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you are.</v>

303
00:11:33.991 --> 00:11:36.810
<v Speaker 1>When you're upside down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be with the momentum you</v>

304
00:11:36.811 --> 00:11:37.644
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to calculate that your math is </v>

305
00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:41.550
<v Speaker 1>doing constant algorithms and math </v>
<v Speaker 1>equations.</v>

306
00:11:41.551 --> 00:11:42.384
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're fighting to weight </v>

307
00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:45.210
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are we at?</v>

308
00:11:45.211 --> 00:11:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you tie up with someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

309
00:11:46.751 --> 00:11:47.584
<v Speaker 1>then you have to feel their weight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to manipulate it in a way to </v>

310
00:11:50.251 --> 00:11:52.260
<v Speaker 1>get it where you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's against the cage or whether</v>

311
00:11:52.261 --> 00:11:54.430
<v Speaker 1>it's on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body is using</v>

312
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.690
<v Speaker 2>a equation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

313
00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind is equating,</v>

314
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.720
<v Speaker 2>how much force do I need to make this </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen?</v>

315
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.450
<v Speaker 2>How little force?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what if I go the opposite direction</v>

316
00:12:04.451 --> 00:12:05.284
<v Speaker 2>because they're pushing into me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all these different things that </v>

317
00:12:07.241 --> 00:12:08.074
<v Speaker 2>you have to over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no other way to do it then than </v>

318
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:13.810
<v Speaker 2>a trial and error process and over and </v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over and over again.</v>

319
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

320
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Look at someone who's like really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>at one aspect of it.</v>

321
00:12:17.701 --> 00:12:22.080
<v Speaker 1>I may like Yoel Romero who's just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous wrestler and you go,</v>

322
00:12:22.081 --> 00:12:23.840
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how much touch button the park.</v>

323
00:12:23.841 --> 00:12:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Is that guy doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

324
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 1>how many cartwheels is he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he tumbling?</v>

325
00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:29.483
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I bet you he does a hundred double </v>

326
00:12:30.661 --> 00:12:31.830
<v Speaker 2>eggs a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

327
00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:32.843
<v Speaker 2>it'll least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he's doing all kinds of eggs and </v>

328
00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:37.200
<v Speaker 2>then a hundred body locks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you know,</v>

329
00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.660
<v Speaker 1>connor lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was like,</v>

330
00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.700
<v Speaker 1>this is what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need a movement coach.</v>

331
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I need a movement coach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

332
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:44.483
<v Speaker 1>and it still might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean as we said with George Saint </v>

333
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:46.291
<v Speaker 1>Pierre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

334
00:12:46.291 --> 00:12:49.950
<v Speaker 1>it has massive benefits to get that kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of coordination.</v>

335
00:12:49.951 --> 00:12:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Physical strength.</v>

336
00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.270
<v Speaker 2>Do you like about connor though is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

337
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:57.060
<v Speaker 2>his balance is impeccable and that could</v>
<v Speaker 2>be part of that.</v>

338
00:12:57.061 --> 00:13:01.210
<v Speaker 2>And like he's never over himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least with the striking part of it.</v>

339
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.063
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground is a completely different </v>

340
00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:05.860
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when he's in striking range in his,</v>

341
00:13:05.861 --> 00:13:09.580
<v Speaker 2>just his body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his eye hand coordination is incredible.</v>

342
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:13.210
<v Speaker 2>And his balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's never too far over a punch.</v>

343
00:13:13.211 --> 00:13:15.640
<v Speaker 2>He's never too far back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's always centered,</v>

344
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:17.590
<v Speaker 2>is always centered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He throws a kick,</v>

345
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:18.671
<v Speaker 2>he never gets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

346
00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:19.504
<v Speaker 2>you see people kick and they miss and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they kind of like stumble like their </v>

347
00:13:21.071 --> 00:13:23.920
<v Speaker 2>weights off balance or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they kick and even land and even when</v>

348
00:13:23.921 --> 00:13:25.090
<v Speaker 2>they put their foot down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like,</v>

349
00:13:25.091 --> 00:13:26.680
<v Speaker 2>it's not a good landing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

350
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.480
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like the world's best kicker,</v>

351
00:13:28.481 --> 00:13:29.314
<v Speaker 2>but when I watched conor do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like he kicks or push kicks and </v>

352
00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:34.480
<v Speaker 2>sticks it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is like,</v>

353
00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:36.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a a gymnast in the sense,</v>

354
00:13:36.521 --> 00:13:38.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do those flip and then they want to</v>

355
00:13:38.021 --> 00:13:39.650
<v Speaker 2>just boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stick it like,</v>

356
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.030
<v Speaker 2>and he's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good at that.</v>

357
00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.530
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's where the movement does </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit,</v>

358
00:13:44.531 --> 00:13:47.020
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that he never is over himself and his</v>

359
00:13:47.021 --> 00:13:47.850
<v Speaker 2>weight distribution,</v>

360
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:48.683
<v Speaker 1>isn't it the case that whenever someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>loses though everyone always second </v>

361
00:13:51.911 --> 00:13:55.150
<v Speaker 1>guesses what they were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if what they were doing was getting</v>

362
00:13:55.151 --> 00:13:58.300
<v Speaker 1>them to be like 16 to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally undefeated world champion.</v>

363
00:13:58.780 --> 00:13:59.613
<v Speaker 1>When you'd make a mistake or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes wrong or something goes right for </v>

364
00:14:03.221 --> 00:14:04.054
<v Speaker 1>your opponent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should probably say immediately </v>

365
00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:06.670
<v Speaker 1>people start questioning everything you </v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

366
00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

367
00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.360
<v Speaker 2>All the time it happened with me even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

368
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.130
<v Speaker 2>when I lost to Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy,</v>

369
00:14:13.131 --> 00:14:14.630
<v Speaker 2>you got to change this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta change everything.</v>

370
00:14:14.631 --> 00:14:15.800
<v Speaker 2>But as long as you're winning people </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

371
00:14:15.801 --> 00:14:16.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep doing what you're doing,</v>

372
00:14:16.791 --> 00:14:17.624
<v Speaker 2>it's working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he lose and like change </v>

373
00:14:18.531 --> 00:14:21.230
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

374
00:14:21.231 --> 00:14:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was quick.</v>

375

<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

376
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.620
<v Speaker 1>also the Rhonda criticism in the Holly </v>
<v Speaker 1>Holm fight.</v>

377
00:14:25.621 --> 00:14:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was like looking at her like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominating vechicle.</v>

378
00:14:29.101 --> 00:14:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Heyo would stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

379
00:14:30.961 --> 00:14:33.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm beating Sarah McMahon the way she </v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

380
00:14:33.391 --> 00:14:36.060
<v Speaker 1>Alexis Davis beating her down the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>she did and go,</v>

381
00:14:36.061 --> 00:14:36.894
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda obviously is getting so good at </v>

382
00:14:38.581 --> 00:14:39.414
<v Speaker 1>striking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just such an elite athlete that </v>

383
00:14:40.891 --> 00:14:41.724
<v Speaker 1>she can do what she's doing to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then her trainer saying that she </v>

384
00:14:44.851 --> 00:14:47.580
<v Speaker 1>could go box women professionals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>knock them out.</v>

385
00:14:47.581 --> 00:14:51.060
<v Speaker 1>And so you get this thing in your head </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can do,</v>
