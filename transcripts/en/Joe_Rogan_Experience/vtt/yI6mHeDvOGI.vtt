1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.590
Oh,
okay.
We're live Remy Warren.
How are you fella?
Pretty good.
How's it going on?

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.240
I watched your show last night.
Oh,
did you?
I know,
I watched it again today.

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.130
The show's called Apex Predator.

4
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:13.460
It's on Thursday nights on the sportsmans channel.
Yup.

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.960
8:00 PM and they're getting,

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.550
this is a show that last time he came in with Dan Dodi,

7
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.010
we kind of talked about it off the record,
right?

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.240
We couldn't talk about it yet in the wind there.
It was not,

9
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:25.620
we didn't have any network for it yet.

10
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:29.530
We filmed the pilot episode and now it's,

11
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.840
it's a real deal now on television.
It's a real show.

12
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.190
It's cool and stuff like that happens.

13
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.060
You're planted out your work and it actually comes together and you have a real

14
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:41.940
television show.
It's pretty exciting.
So I've been,

15
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.820
I've been pretty pumped about it because this is something that I've been

16
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:47.020
thinking about for years.
And then,
you know,

17
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.770
we came in and was quite a while ago,
over a year ago or something like that.

18
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.190
Yeah.
And now it's finally come to fruition and people can look at what I've been

19
00:00:56.191 --> 00:00:58.110
talking about for the last couple of years.

20
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.320
It takes a long time to make something fucking happened,
man.

21
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.990
It's this hurry up and wait game buddy.
Uh,

22
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.310
my buddy was in the army and he's like,
yeah,
wars.
Just hurry up and wait.

23
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:09.570
And it's like,
that's television.

24
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.190
Wow,
that's a jaded individual.
He done,
come on.

25
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:21.390
Can we just get to kill?
And folks,
um,
the show is,
uh,

26
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.450
what you're doing on the show is you're essentially emulating a lot of tactics

27
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.150
that various predators use and you are using these tactics to get clothes and

28
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:35.490
figure out how to hunt animals.

29
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.220
The one I saw last night was the buffalo one oh sweet.

30
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.830
Where you put a coyote outfit on and we're crawling up to these buffalo and it's

31
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.110
kind of fascinating that they don't run necessarily from coyotes or wolves that

32
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:51.900
just sort of walked towards them.

33
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.710
The only time the coyotes are the wolves would actually attack them is if they

34
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:59.250
were running that,
that's when they would move in on them.
Yeah,
exactly.

35
00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:00.510
Because the way,

36
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.310
the way wolves hunt is they have to get the animals running first and tomorrow

37
00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:08.550
night's episode.
We really see that when we look at the way wolves hunt,

38
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.870
but the reason that the wolf has to get the buffalo running is the wolf's

39
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.170
essentially outclassed by the bison.
It's so much larger.

40
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:19.620
So for the bisons say we're going to stand here and fight,

41
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.360
then it can kill the wolf and it's,

42
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.390
it's the cost benefit analysis for the wolf to attack that bison while it's

43
00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:28.200
standing there isn't great enough.

44
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.950
So the wolves will actually get around the bison and try to instigate them to

45
00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:35.070
run because if the bison makes the mistake of running,

46
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.200
then they can hunt as a pack.

47
00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:42.201
They can wear it down once they get it moving and then they attack from the back

48
00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:46.620
and they're safer and they're more successful.
So the bison know this,

49
00:02:46.621 --> 00:02:49.020
so if they run,
whether they're going to be in trouble,

50
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.460
but when a human hunter comes along using primitive weapons or whatever,

51
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.000
the human hunter needs that animal to stand still in order to kill it.

52
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.080
So in the bice and sees a human it because that's how

53
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.800
<v 1>it,
it stays safe.
So,
you know,</v>

54
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.830
the point of this show is really dissecting the way nature does things and you

55
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:10.090
look at like every animal,
so specialized,

56
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:14.140
it does something really well and everything falls into a certain niche.

57
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.940
And as a human looking at nature,
we look at and go,
man,
what can we learn?

58
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.940
Like humans are an amazing species.

59
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.800
And what I've come to realize is we've adapted a lot of the techniques and

60
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:31.801
tactics that a certain animal specializes in or does really well and use it for

61
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:36.670
ourselves to become this,
this essential top predator.

62
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.660
So,
you know,
looking at this,
you know,
the plains Indians,
we looked at,
uh,

63
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:44.890
George Catlin painting where it's pretty famous painting.
There's plains Indians

64
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.120
<v 2>painting Jamie.
It's,
it's a really famous fanning.
It's really cool</v>

65
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.650
<v 1>if y'all like that.
Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:49.651 --> 00:03:53.910
There's two plains Indians sneaking up on a herd of bison underneath these white

67
00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:56.190
wolf skins.
And I'd seen that,
you know,

68
00:03:56.191 --> 00:03:58.950
I've always thought that it was an awesome picture.
How do you spell his name?

69
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.550
George Catlin.
Ca,
I,
T,
l,

70
00:04:02.551 --> 00:04:06.660
I n and uh,
yeah.
So you know,
he,

71
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.060
he paints this picture of what supposedly what he saw.

72
00:04:09.061 --> 00:04:12.960
But you never really know these artists that shapes a,

73
00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:16.500
this is from the 18 hundreds.
Yeah.

74
00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:19.650
I mean this is pretty old photo.
So painting,

75
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.830
it was kind of a gamble whether or not he was kind of,

76
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.810
he was kind of going out west and painting what he saw or what he interpreted to

77
00:04:27.811 --> 00:04:31.500
see.
And so I've always thought,
oh,
I wonder if that's really true,

78
00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:33.810
but when you dissect it,
obviously those,

79
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.400
those plains Indian sitting around saw that,
Huh,
when those wolves are there,

80
00:04:38.401 --> 00:04:40.560
those bison aren't running well,

81
00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:43.110
let's throw some of those skins on her back and see what happens.

82
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.410
And it is a tech and like through the show we develop,
find out that text,

83
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.720
that top left corner there.
Yeah,
yeah,

84
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.770
yeah.
Pull that sucker up.
Wow.

85
00:04:55.771 --> 00:05:00.450
That's crazy that they really did that.
Yeah.
They must have.
Yeah.
And I mean,

86
00:05:00.451 --> 00:05:02.460
it makes perfect sense if you're sitting there and,

87
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.510
and see the correlation between the wolves and the bison and you come to this

88
00:05:08.221 --> 00:05:12.330
logical conclusion that if we act like a wolf,
the bison will stay there.

89
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.240
And I did worse than they were back then to a million.

90
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.090
And that's on that episode.
Steve,
you know,
he's the bice and expert and uh,

91
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.980
just how many bison were that he was telling me that they used to find the bison

92
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.740
by giant clouds from their breath.

93
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.300
It make like huge clouds.
What,
that's what Steve was telling me.

94
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.510
Wow.
I mean,
millions,
millions advice.
Yeah.

95
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:37.741
<v 2>Well,
you know,</v>

96
00:05:37.741 --> 00:05:41.850
there's a guy named Dan Flores that's a good friend of Steve's as well and uh,

97
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.070
he is a,

98
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.760
a real bias and expert and he's written a very controversial paper on,
uh,

99
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.830
what happened to the Bison and what he's saying is that he compares,

100
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.850
he's going to be on the podcast soon,
as soon as he's done with his book,
uh,

101
00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.580
hopefully by sometime in the summer.
Um,
and what his,

102
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
what his paper is basically saying is that they were the plains Indians.

103
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:11.870
Once they had figured out how to ride horses and shoot from horses were already

104
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:13.670
on the way to wiping out the buffalo.

105
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.800
And the reason why the buffalo were in such high numbers was because that so

106
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:21.770
many people,
so many native Americans had died from smallpox.

107
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.340
And if you go back before the smallpox epidemic,

108
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:29.480
the people that had arrived in uh,
North America,
like the Dutch,

109
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.080
when they had made an accounting of all the different animals,

110
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.430
they had talked about turkeys and deer and elk and bear now,

111
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.080
no mention whatsoever of Buffalo.

112
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:44.240
And they were visiting all these same areas that 200 years later had millions of

113
00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:47.240
Buffalo.
But during that 200 years,

114
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:51.970
90% of the native Americans had been wiped out by smallpox really.

115
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.821
And during that,

116
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:56.930
and then they were apparently like probably the number one Predator of these

117
00:06:56.931 --> 00:07:00.920
bison.
I'm probably doing a really shitty job of explaining this.

118
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:01.813
That makes sense.

119
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.880
<v 1>Do things like the buffalo jumps where it just drive herds of bison off a cliff</v>

120
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.770
cliffs and they apparently the wolves with feed and cause they're just be dead.

121
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.410
I mean you couldn't take all that meat.

122
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.700
It doesn't matter if you've got a small village,
you're taking what you can use.

123
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.640
There'd be dead bison everywhere and the wolves would come in and gorge on them.

124
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.430
I guess there was an account where there was wolves,
so full on food.

125
00:07:28.431 --> 00:07:30.920
They've usually just laying there in excess just

126
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.310
<v 2>wow.
Gorgeous.
And they were just hanging around next to the native Americans.</v>

127
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.760
Well where the buffalo jumped off cliffs.

128
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.380
They're native Americans were down there too with the wolves.

129
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.560
<v 1>No,
I think I,
I don't know if they would move on,
you know,
certain point.</v>

130
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:45.390
The meat's going to go bad.
Just keep eating.

131
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:49.250
Those are just keep eating and eating and eating.
Fuck.

132
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.760
Cause apparently a wolf's can,
they can gorge like a hungry,

133
00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:57.110
like a wolf that's really hungry to read.
The red was on.
Yeah,

134
00:07:57.111 --> 00:08:01.580
because they'll eat,
uh,
I read something that was like 20,

135
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.960
25 pounds in a sitting and they can process that meat in two hours.

136
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.110
So they'll just eat and eat and eat

137
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.170
<v 2>25 pounds of meat processing.</v>

138
00:08:12.171 --> 00:08:14.780
Imagine if you ate a 25 pound Turkey,

139
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:18.800
like you went to the supermarket and pick up a 25 pound Turkey and you ate it

140
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:22.010
yourself.
And there's never been a wolf bigger than a human being.
Right.

141
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.210
The biggest wolf ever.
It's probably like 200 pounds,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

142
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.000
So we're talking about,
you know,
150 pound wolf,

143
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:34.030
which is the size of a normal man can eat 25 fucking pounds and go through it in

144
00:08:34.611 --> 00:08:38.120
two hours.
That's insane.
Crazy.
That's insane.

145
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:42.290
Competitive eating at its finest.
Well,
their bite powers also freaky.

146
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:45.290
I didn't know Ricky Gervais' told me and I was like,

147
00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:47.240
this guy has got to be wrong.
He said that a,

148
00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:51.560
a wolf has a bite that's five times more powerful than a pit bull.
I'm like,

149
00:08:51.561 --> 00:08:55.260
how could that be true?
Oh yeah,
it's true.
I can't fucking believe it,

150
00:08:55.261 --> 00:08:56.140
but it's true.
Really?

151
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:56.641
<v 0>Yeah.
I mean,</v>

152
00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:59.970
they're not that you look at like pimples all these muscles in their heads and

153
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:01.050
they're known for their bite.

154
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.670
Nothing compared to a wolf wolf can go right through an elk shinbone it's crazy.

155
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.790
Fuck.
Yeah.
I,
that's,
that's,
that's one of the inspiration.

156
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:11.510
Wolves are actually the inspiration for me

157
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.690
<v 1>to even think of the show.
Uh,
I just,
I'm,
I'm pretty fascinated by woes.</v>

158
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:20.691
But one day I was out hunting elk in kind of in Montana and I been hunting this

159
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:27.501
one bull and it was a first time I ever saw a wolf in the wild and it was

160
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.670
probably really close to,
I was like,
well,

161
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.610
this is awesome because this is before you really saw a lot of wolves.

162
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:37.890
And then I do,
I actually got a little video of it and then I go and do my hunt.

163
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.940
And then the wolf happened to be chasing these st hunting,

164
00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:46.170
the same group of elk and a lone wolf.
Yeah,
it was by itself.

165
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.120
And I was actually telling,

166
00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:52.350
I did Steve's podcast with Steve Rinella the other day and I was telling him

167
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:57.240
this similar,
this same story.
And every,

168
00:09:57.241 --> 00:10:00.870
I've seen four times I've seen wolves take down an elk in the wild.

169
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.510
They've all been by themselves.
I've never seen a pack attack.
Oh,

170
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.500
I've only seen lone wolves.

171
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:12.600
<v 0>Dad has gotta be amazing to watch that.
So it's cool.
I mean,
wow,</v>

172
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.660
they're so fat.
You see like the,

173
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:19.730
you see the elk running and it's almost like the wolf is g it can like,

174
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.580
it could almost run between its legs back.
It's going back and forth.

175
00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:28.581
The elk is bee lining and that wove his back and forth thing cause much faster.

176
00:10:28.651 --> 00:10:32.500
Much faster.
Yeah.
So how do they take it out?
They bite its back legs.
Yep.

177
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.890
Grab Hamstring,
bite us back.

178
00:10:34.891 --> 00:10:38.280
Like anywhere it can sink its teeth in but mostly go for the back end.

179
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.850
Do they try to take it down all in one shot or did he try to wound it and then

180
00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:42.720
eventually get it?

181
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.070
I think it's whatever they can grab and half the time it ends up wounding it.

182
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:51.380
When I've seen him be the most successful is they run the elk into dead fall

183
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.560
because the wolf can go under and over.
The logs up and down,

184
00:10:55.561 --> 00:10:58.710
back and forth and the elk struggles,
it uses all its energy.

185
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.800
It kind of gets trapped.
Um,
wow.

186
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.650
So the wolves kind of funnel them into areas where they know there'll be more

187
00:11:04.651 --> 00:11:08.340
successful.
Like it seems like I've always seen him catch him on the downhill,

188
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.250
like run them down a canyon in the bottom of a canyon.

189
00:11:11.251 --> 00:11:14.460
Seems to be where I'm trying to think about it.
Yeah,

190
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.330
it's like in the bottom of a canyon where there's lots of law and things down.

191
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.770
That's gotta be an amazing thing to see happen live because it's so rare to be

192
00:11:22.771 --> 00:11:25.380
able to be there.
I mean,
you might see a wolf,
you might see an elk,

193
00:11:25.381 --> 00:11:27.090
but to see a wolf kill an elk,

194
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.510
like to be at that moment where you didn't matter if you were there or not,

195
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.450
that was going to go down.
I mean that's a nature.
Exactly.
We were,

196
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.090
I was blood trailing my,
my friend's wife's,

197
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:40.110
she shot a nice bowl with her bow last year and we're sitting in there trying to

198
00:11:40.111 --> 00:11:45.111
find this elk and here comes a cow elk running with a wolf hot on its tail.

199
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:50.310
And I was like,
sweet,
we're going to watch it go down.
And my buddy like yells at,

200
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.500
he didn't know what to,
I mean it was right in our face.

201
00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:56.170
It was like right there and he just kind of yells and it spooks the wolf off and

202
00:11:56.171 --> 00:11:59.290
I was like,
why'd you do that?
He's like,
he just,
he didn't even,
he's like,

203
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.110
I don't know.
I was like,
no,
he's just going to go on more.
I mean,

204
00:12:02.111 --> 00:12:05.050
it would've been cool to at least see it.
You know,
you would have seen it,
right?

205
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.170
Oh,
we were 75 yards.

206
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.340
I mean it was right there in the open,
like in this burn.
It was amazing.

207
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.740
They're incredible.
I have so mixed feelings on wolves.
I mean,
one thing,

208
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.950
one part of me thinks they're amazing.
I love them.
They're fascinating.

209
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.470
But another part of me is like this reintroduction of them into the United

210
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:29.560
States.
It just,
I just don't think it was really planned out very well.

211
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.790
And their numbers are staggering now.
Oh yeah,
it's,
well,

212
00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:36.420
when we talk about the American model of conservation eat,

213
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:41.080
there's checks and balances and goes with game animals and non game animals.

214
00:12:41.081 --> 00:12:45.730
So when you reintroduce an animal into an area that it hasn't maybe never been

215
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.760
in that area or it's been so long that it's been in there,

216
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.700
they have to be managed as well.
Otherwise,

217
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.550
the whole ecosystem comes out of balance.
Well,

218
00:12:54.551 --> 00:12:58.450
I watched this video about Yellowstone,
about wolves in Yellowstone.

219
00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.030
It was talking about the impact that wolves have had in Yellowstone and all

220
00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:04.120
these other animals that are thriving because of the introduction of the wolves,

221
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.370
and it's kind of interesting.
It's kind of interesting,

222
00:13:06.371 --> 00:13:09.940
but the reality of those animals is their predators.

223
00:13:09.941 --> 00:13:11.650
You're not talking about any other kind of animal.

224
00:13:11.651 --> 00:13:12.730
You're talking about a predator.

225
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.600
It's like if you have a large amount of elk in an area,
a large amount of deer,

226
00:13:16.601 --> 00:13:19.900
I mean this is a completely different animal than having a large amount of

227
00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:20.734
wolves.

228
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.800
And when you're managing these types of animals with emotions rather than

229
00:13:26.291 --> 00:13:30.220
objective logic,
that's when things get weird because you've got a lot of people,

230
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.300
their version of conservation never would include hunting a wolf,

231
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:38.970
but if you get thousands and thousands of wolves in a state like you,

232
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:42.730
you have to hunt them because then they start attacking livestock.

233
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.170
Like where I was up in BC where I shot that Moose,
there was um,

234
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.030
the guy that I hunted with,

235
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:53.770
his neighbor had a cow get taken out by wolves in the middle of the winter.

236
00:13:53.771 --> 00:13:56.410
It's like cold and there was nothing,
not much for them to eat.
And I said,

237
00:13:56.411 --> 00:13:59.230
fuck it,
let's just do this.
And they took out a cow.

238
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.410
You imagine like you're in your house and you're,
you're hearing,

239
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.280
you're looking out and there's 20 wolves just ripping apart.

240
00:14:06.281 --> 00:14:08.870
One of your cow was like,
fuck man.
Yeah.

241
00:14:08.871 --> 00:14:11.220
Once they figure out what an easy meal is too,

242
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.530
I think it's hard for them to go back to chasing Moose and yeah.
Other animals,

243
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.900
well they have no limit on the amount of wolves he can shoot up there.

244
00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.310
You can shoot as many as you want.
Oh,

245
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.140
I don't think they could ever hurt the population.

246
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.420
What's so dense when you go up there,

247
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.420
everybody who lives in the city,

248
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:34.230
you owe it to yourself at some point in your life to go out into actual real

249
00:14:34.691 --> 00:14:38.830
wilderness because there's all these people that have these opinions on animals

250
00:14:38.831 --> 00:14:42.280
that are completely based on some Narnia,

251
00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:44.800
like idea of what nature's like,

252
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.280
like they've never actually been out there like in real wilderness days,

253
00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.070
in packing go days in where

254
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:56.590
<v 2>you go,
Oh God damn.
Like I just,
I didn't get it.
I did just,</v>

255
00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.690
I just didn't know.
It's nuts out there.

256
00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.030
<v 1>I think the other,</v>

257
00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.710
the other assumption is people think that the real wild is what they would see

258
00:15:05.711 --> 00:15:06.880
in a national park.

259
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:11.920
It's the zoo version of what wild is.

260
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:17.100
When you go out and do a place like DC or outside of any kind of park like that,

261
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:22.450
it's a completely different world and yet you don't see as many animals.

262
00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.450
It's tough life out there.
Even,
I mean,

263
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:30.510
not that the boundary of the park makes it more animals,

264
00:15:30.971 --> 00:15:35.320
but it's set up.
Those animals are climatized to seeing humans.

265
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.050
They don't have their same natural senses.

266
00:15:38.051 --> 00:15:41.200
So if you go out and do a place that they aren't a climatized to seeing humans,

267
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.320
it's a tough go.
It's,
it's not as easy as people think.

268
00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.730
<v 2>Well,
it's not only not easy.
There's a weird silence to it out there.
I was like,</v>

269
00:15:48.731 --> 00:15:53.530
uh,
there's an eerie indifference that you get.

270
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.860
That's one of the things that we,
uh,
we went to a Prince of Wales,
uh,

271
00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:02.650
Steve Rinella took us up there hunting a deer.
We struck out.

272
00:16:02.651 --> 00:16:06.310
But it's,
it's an amazingly remote place.

273
00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.980
Like you don't see it.
You know,

274
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:11.500
we didn't see a single fucking person other than us the entire time we were

275
00:16:11.501 --> 00:16:15.610
there.
And you just,
it doesn't give a fuck about,
you know,

276
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:20.020
if you fall and break your leg and die there.
So what,
just so worth it.

277
00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.020
You're just a part of this whole thing where everything is going to go.

278
00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:25.270
There's bears there,
there's deer there,

279
00:16:25.271 --> 00:16:30.130
there's all sorts of interesting wildlife.
But it doesn't give a fuck about you.

280
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:34.270
It's,
I don't think people kind of understand that.

281
00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:35.440
And a real,

282
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:40.470
like an a in it will you really rationalize it or really like got it into your

283
00:16:41.471 --> 00:16:43.240
brain?
Like this is reality.

284
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.110
And until you actually go into the woods to the real woods,

285
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.020
not yellow stone,
not central park.

286
00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.310
The real woods are a different animal.
It is.

287
00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.400
And that's when you kind of understand if you've,
if you've even,

288
00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:00.100
I haven't encountered wolves in the wild.
I've seen what they've done.

289
00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.530
We talked about in the last podcast,
I took some photos of this.

290
00:17:02.531 --> 00:17:06.550
I'm a moose calf that we had come upon that had been killed probably like the

291
00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:09.160
night before.
It was kind of interesting,
but,
um,

292
00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:14.050
I haven't encountered them in real life,
but the people that I know that have,

293
00:17:14.051 --> 00:17:17.680
have a completely different opinion than the people that live in cities that

294
00:17:17.681 --> 00:17:20.050
think that you'd have to be an asshole to shoot a wolf.

295
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:25.170
<v 1>Yeah.
Well,
if you're aren't around it,
it's so far removed.
I mean you cannot,
oh,</v>

296
00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.370
you almost can't even make an accurate assumption of what it's like.

297
00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:28.681
<v 2>No.</v>

298
00:17:28.681 --> 00:17:31.980
You also can't make an accurate assumption that you'd have to be a person that

299
00:17:31.981 --> 00:17:35.220
hates animals to shoot the wolf.
That's,
that's the,

300
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:39.600
the management aspect of,
of wildlife,
especially when it comes to predators.

301
00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.540
This is lost on a lot of people,

302
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:46.350
and it's one of the reasons why California doesn't have mountain lions seasons,

303
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.160
but like mountain lion attacks and California steadily gone

304
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.380
<v 0>up mount lines.</v>

305
00:17:51.381 --> 00:17:54.960
Sightings have steadily gone up and they're kind of playing with fire because

306
00:17:54.961 --> 00:17:59.370
there's like,
there's a lot of them here now.
They don't get hunted.
You know,

307
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.540
that's what I wonder what,
what the future's gonna look like in a place,

308
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:08.760
in the long feature.
Because in mountain lions,
if you look at African cats,

309
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:13.300
they're very dangerous animal.
But mountain lions or,

310
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.840
or I a shire version of the species,

311
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.110
and I think it's because they've,

312
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:24.210
they're in the predatory realm.
They weren't always,
they weren't at the top.

313
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.370
There was in California,
you look at California,

314
00:18:26.371 --> 00:18:30.260
there used to be grizzly bears or,
or some sort of species of brown,
you know,

315
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.720
coastal grizzly bear and then humans hunting.

316
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.960
And so you had mountain lions that had to be afraid of things.

317
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:43.650
Now they're in a world where they don't have any predators and nothing's chasing

318
00:18:43.651 --> 00:18:47.250
them.
At what point,
I mean,
maybe it's a hundred years down the road,

319
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:48.780
maybe it's a thousand years down the road.

320
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:53.680
At what point do they essentially become a different temperament of cat?

321
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.000
Much similar to the ones in Africa where they have to,

322
00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:01.170
or South America or South America.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Where they don't have predators.

323
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.720
That's a good point.
You've got to keep those bitches scared.

324
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.000
This a family that we went to the farm to hunt Turkeys,
uh,

325
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.030
two weeks ago and uh,
they lost all their sheep.

326
00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.430
Every single one of them in northern California.

327
00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.400
All of them really allows all of 'em to mountain lions.
Hmm.
They're like,

328
00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:18.600
they have so many cats up there.

329
00:19:18.601 --> 00:19:23.100
They see them like in the day just hanging it out and like,
fuck man,

330
00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.620
I didn't have an accurate account of how many they have.
Oh No.

331
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.520
It's pretty rare to see.
And when you,

332
00:19:29.521 --> 00:19:32.340
if you start seeing them outline in the daytime then there's a lot of mountain

333
00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:36.150
lines or are you just got super lucky?
Yeah,

334
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.430
I saw one in Montecito,
which is like a rich suburb of Santa Barbara.

335
00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:46.320
I was driving down like a residential road and I saw this thing bounced in front

336
00:19:46.321 --> 00:19:50.820
of the road and I thought it was a coyote at first until I saw its tail and
Whoa,

337
00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:55.140
that's a fucking mountain line.
And in this like suburban neighborhood,

338
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:59.100
it just looking for a good restaurant to get a steak or a good dog,

339
00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:05.280
good dog that it catches slipping.
Yeah,
I think I got,
I must,
my place in Montana,

340
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:09.270
I think I have some kind of strange mountain line breeding program going on

341
00:20:09.271 --> 00:20:14.271
because every year at the same time it was just lying tracks all at or near the

342
00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.900
cabin all over the place.
And that started to right when I,
uh,

343
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.310
the year I first came here and talked with you and it's just been continuing and

344
00:20:23.311 --> 00:20:26.910
I don't know what it is,
but a friend of mine started chasing lines around there.

345
00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.260
He said you would be surprised how many cats living in this area within these

346
00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:36.240
six or seven within a few,
a mile or two.
It's crazy to hone ranch,

347
00:20:36.241 --> 00:20:41.040
which is about an hour plus from here.
There's a great hunting spot.

348
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:45.720
They have pigs and rocky mountain elk and they have one trail camera on this

349
00:20:45.721 --> 00:20:48.280
pond and they found 16

350
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.700
<v 2>different mountain lines on this trail camera.
That's pretty crazy.</v>

351
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.550
It's a huge ranch is the biggest ranch in California.
It's 270,000 acres.

352
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:02.560
And they have um,
just a,
a large supply of wild pigs.

353
00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:03.700
Wild pigs are all over the place.

354
00:21:03.701 --> 00:21:07.480
That's like their bread and butter for their hunting program.
Yeah.
Yeah.

355
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:11.440
When we went there we saw feel like we only last time I went,

356
00:21:11.441 --> 00:21:15.460
I went like real recently,
um,
we were bow hunting.
We saw 50 pigs.

357
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.800
Yeah.
And we didn't even see a lot,

358
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:21.430
a lot at the time before that we were seeing hundreds of them,

359
00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:25.390
just hundreds of pigs all over the place.
Did you end up getting one first time?

360
00:21:25.391 --> 00:21:30.040
Yes.
Second time.
Now that's cool.
But it's pretty good.
Yeah,
it's delicious.

361
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:33.340
It's very different.
It's very different than um,

362
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:36.400
like I had wild Turkey and I was surprised at how much it tastes like Turkey,

363
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.690
you know,
especially the breast.
I was like,
it's good,
but it's Turkey,
Turkey,

364
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.970
but you eat wild pork and you're like,
Ooh,

365
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.930
this has got a different thing going on.
It depends on the,

366
00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:50.060
<v 1>the pig,
the pig you get because if you buy pork,</v>

367
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:52.340
if you shoot a bore,

368
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:57.470
it tastes a lot different than a sour or even like pregnant sound maybe.
But I,

369
00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:57.891
uh,

370
00:21:57.891 --> 00:22:01.910
in New Zealand we get quite a few pigs and this guy showed me this tactic where

371
00:22:01.911 --> 00:22:04.850
when you're skinning it,
you get your knife sharpened,
make your initial cuts,

372
00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:09.980
and then he doles the tip on the,
on the concrete.
And so when he seen him,

373
00:22:09.981 --> 00:22:13.520
because what it is,
he'll skin healing skin closer to the,

374
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:17.900
essentially closer to the skin and keep all the fat on the pork,

375
00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.560
which normally if you just kind of skin it off,
take the hide off,

376
00:22:21.561 --> 00:22:25.750
all the fats removed.
But he said that if you leave that fat on it just,

377
00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:29.300
it gives it a lot more flavor,
a different flavor.
And he's really good.

378
00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.010
I did it and it was,
it was pretty exciting.

379
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.460
<v 2>What's the difference in the flavor?
Like could you describe it?</v>

380
00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:39.090
<v 1>It's more like regular pork I would say.
Hmm.
Yeah,
more of a,</v>

381
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:41.840
<v 2>do you know who Joel Salitan is?
No.</v>

382
00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:45.930
So kind of a famous farmers get some really unique ideas about farming and he

383
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:47.480
was a guest on the podcast as well.

384
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:51.980
And what he does is he lets his pigs kind of run wild.

385
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:52.911
He sets up,

386
00:22:52.911 --> 00:22:57.650
I'll go large electric fence and he moves that electric fence all over the
place.

387
00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:02.840
So these pigs,
the way they eat is they route,
they eat acorns and they eat,

388
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:06.800
they eat like a normal pig would and there's plenty of food in the forest but

389
00:23:06.801 --> 00:23:10.560
they keep them intact,
uh,
in a,
in a certain area where the,

390
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.150
with this portable electric fence,
so they just kept moving the fence.

391
00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.020
It's like the pigs will,
you know,
route out this area and you know,

392
00:23:18.021 --> 00:23:22.070
forge in this one area and then those kind of move them to another spot and then

393
00:23:22.071 --> 00:23:25.550
they'll let them forage in that area.
And so these pigs have a dark meat,

394
00:23:25.551 --> 00:23:26.510
like a wild boar.

395
00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:30.510
<v 1>Yeah,
it's good.
It's good.
It's,
it isn't like domestic import,
but I,</v>

396
00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:34.290
I almost prefer it if you try it,
if it next time you get one,
try to leap,

397
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:38.550
Cook a little bit with the skin on a that's good.
Really with the skin on,

398
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:38.910
we just,

399
00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:42.720
you just burned the start a big fire and get some water and just sharing the

400
00:23:42.721 --> 00:23:45.980
hair off.
Yeah.
And then cook with the skin on all bone it out

401
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.670
<v 0>first and you can stuff like stuff the ham with.
I don't know.</v>

402
00:23:49.671 --> 00:23:51.620
Some kind of stuffing,
whatever you want,
really,

403
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.070
and then put it in the oven roast in the oven like that.
You don't eat the skin.

404
00:23:55.071 --> 00:23:57.610
But I've seen people do that with domestic pig,
so she would do those,

405
00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:02.460
those big whole pig roasts.
Oh yeah,
that looks upset.
Yeah.
Alex Oss,

406
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.670
we tried doing that for a buddy's bachelor party,

407
00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:06.800
but we didn't get the fire hot enough.

408
00:24:06.801 --> 00:24:10.610
So we're all here camping by this lake and I brought this big pig and I'm all

409
00:24:10.611 --> 00:24:15.470
excited about it,
get it out.
And now we all have raw pig.

410
00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:20.230
So he fired up the grills and then made the best out of the situation.

411
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:24.680
Everything's close.
Everything just smells like pork after.

412
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.430
Was it a wild pig or was it,
it wasn't domestic pig.
Yeah.

413
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:32.060
I wish it would have been a wild pig.
Well,

414
00:24:32.061 --> 00:24:35.500
you have to worry less about tricking osis.
Right.
With the domestic demand,

415
00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.020
they're actually lowering the temperature that you could cook a domestic pig.

416
00:24:39.021 --> 00:24:40.640
Now the,
the recommendation,

417
00:24:40.641 --> 00:24:45.641
they've got it down to 140 degrees c I have heard that the trick gnosis comes

418
00:24:46.221 --> 00:24:51.080
from them eating rodents.
So technically they could get,

419
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.900
I mean there could be mice because they would eat the feed.

420
00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.210
The mice would get in with the grain and everything and I can still get trick

421
00:24:57.211 --> 00:24:59.870
gnosis definitely contact her.
I wouldn't quote me on that,

422
00:24:59.871 --> 00:25:03.020
but I have definitely heard that a lot.
Well I've watched my chickens,

423
00:25:03.021 --> 00:25:06.260
I have domestic chickens and I've watched them eat a miles.
Oh yeah,

424
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.080
they found a mouse in the chicken house and they fucked that thing up man.

425
00:25:09.081 --> 00:25:13.370
It was wild just because usually they just kind of like know they're just like

426
00:25:13.371 --> 00:25:14.390
pack in and they'll,
you know,

427
00:25:14.391 --> 00:25:16.970
they get real happy if they find a snail or stuff like that.

428
00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:20.900
But they found that mouse and they just stomped,
that little fucker went to town.

429
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:23.070
They went to town,
they were fighting over it and they were both,

430
00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:27.220
they were all tearing it apart and you see they're wrapped or past fucking

431
00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:32.290
dinosaurs stores.
That's because on apex I wanted to look at a lot.

432
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:35.370
I'm just fascinated by birds and the way they,
the way they move in hot,

433
00:25:35.371 --> 00:25:40.370
especially predatory birds.
A lot of people think of birds is seed eating,

434
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:45.180
bird bath.
The animals.
Most birds are meat eaters like most divorced.
Yeah.

435
00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.750
All right.
Well I mean there's a lot of smaller species that aren't,

436
00:25:47.751 --> 00:25:51.800
but there are a lot of carnivorous birds and the way they hunt.

437
00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:53.150
I'm like the Great Blue Heron.

438
00:25:53.151 --> 00:25:55.250
We did an episode that'll be coming up here shortly.

439
00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:58.760
The thing's got a spear attached to its head.
What other animal?

440
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.860
What other animals?
There's videos of great blue herons spearing these gophers.

441
00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.790
It's unbelievable.
I want to see something like pull,
pull,
pull that up Jamie.

442
00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:13.540
They have a spear on their face.
Yeah,
it's about Pelicans Pelican.

443
00:26:13.541 --> 00:26:17.540
We've got a scoop scooper and it's got a net there,
but they have a builtin net.

444
00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:22.580
Yeah,
man.
Um,
I rented a house in Malibu for a few months and uh,

445
00:26:22.581 --> 00:26:25.480
when I was getting some fixed in my kitchen and uh,

446
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:28.850
the house was like right on the water and it was really fucking cool because I

447
00:26:28.851 --> 00:26:31.310
would eat breakfast every morning,
like essentially,

448
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:35.030
like you'd look out from the kitchen table and just nothing but water.

449
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.230
And I'd watch these pelicans diving in and I'd watch these swarms of birds when

450
00:26:39.231 --> 00:26:42.770
they'd find,
you know,
a fish feeding.
Oh yeah.
It's just,

451
00:26:42.771 --> 00:26:45.730
it's so wild to be around them.
Oh,
police,

452
00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.710
the blue heron spears a gopher.
So what does he just chilling,

453
00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.240
waiting for it to pop its head up.
Yeah.
I don't know if this is,

454
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:56.700
oh there's like that's it.
He just walked to go for,

455
00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:02.230
they catch anything but he speared it.
That's what's crazy.

456
00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:06.840
Stab it.
Managing that's into your face.
Is this another one?
Yeah.

457
00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:07.763
That's pretty good.

458
00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:13.020
A weapon built in your face catching spearst up.

459
00:27:13.021 --> 00:27:15.030
The bigger fish they'll spear other ones they grabbed.

460
00:27:15.031 --> 00:27:18.510
But these gophers they definitely,
they definitely go for it.

461
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.460
I saw an eagle for the first time,
I guess it was two years ago now in a Alaska.

462
00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.750
Went up their salmon fishing.
I'd never seen an eagle in the wild.
Let's see,

463
00:27:27.751 --> 00:27:31.610
needles before.
But when you see one in the wild and he started going,

464
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:36.210
oh this is a,
this is not what I think it is.
Oh yeah,
this,

465
00:27:36.211 --> 00:27:41.211
this is like some killer cause some flying killer that has literally has knives

466
00:27:43.081 --> 00:27:46.830
on its fingers as it's floating around looking for something not snatching.

467
00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:49.720
Just fuck up.
Catch.
Look at that.
Bam.
Yeah.

468
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:56.460
Just jacked that over.
It's like there's your birds.
Wow.

469
00:27:56.610 --> 00:28:01.260
Kitchen gophers.
Dinosaurs.
Yeah.
They look like it.
They're pretty cool.

470
00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:03.120
Yeah.
Birds are fascinating,
man.

471
00:28:03.121 --> 00:28:06.350
Have you ever seen the videos of the Harpy Eagles and South America?
Oh yeah.

472
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:08.040
They're cool.

473
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.660
Harpy Eagles killing monkeys and sloths flying off of these sloths.

474
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:14.820
They're apparently do the biggest ego,
right?

475
00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:17.730
The Harpy Eagle I believe is the biggest one.
Yeah.
Well I'm not sure.

476
00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:21.930
I believe they are.
Yeah,
I think so.
Either way.

477
00:28:21.931 --> 00:28:23.640
They're fucking enormous.

478
00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:27.780
And so they did this a nature documentary with these guys were setting up a

479
00:28:27.781 --> 00:28:31.680
camera on the Harpy Eagles nest and they had a chance.
Here goes one,

480
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:36.360
look at this.
Whew.
Poor slob.
He's just a shit deal.

481
00:28:36.361 --> 00:28:39.660
Like he lives his life in slow motion and get ripped out of a tree by an eagle

482
00:28:39.661 --> 00:28:43.540
and put on nat Geo wild.
Oh God.
Seriously?

483
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.520
What a shit deal it is to be a sloth.
Uh,

484
00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:49.830
that's crazy.
Oh God.

485
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:54.930
It's amazing that they can fly with an animal that size too easy to look how he

486
00:28:54.931 --> 00:28:59.190
swoops in as bitch.
Bam as cool.

487
00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.580
It's really cheating,
you know?
Oh yeah.
I mean it's like,

488
00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.460
I was like hunting a cow in a pen,

489
00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:12.030
which is pretty cool.
It is really cool.
But it's,
it's,
that's an eagle,

490
00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:12.751
you know,
I mean,

491
00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:16.710
that's what we think of when we think of a bird of prey that is the

492
00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:19.800
quintessential bird of prey doing this apex Predator show.

493
00:29:19.801 --> 00:29:22.860
I've got to get up close and person with a lot of animals that I just think are

494
00:29:22.861 --> 00:29:27.780
pretty bad ass and you to be sure.
We did one that was a Golden Eagle episode.
Oh.

495
00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.700
And went to this lady,

496
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.830
she runs like this rehabilitation center raptor of the Rockies and she's gotten

497
00:29:33.831 --> 00:29:38.831
all kinds of crazy raptors and there's a Golden Eagle and a bald eagle in the

498
00:29:39.691 --> 00:29:44.530
same enclosure area and we got to take the Golden Eagle out and check it out.

499
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:47.410
And that the Golden Eagle is an impressive,

500
00:29:47.411 --> 00:29:50.150
I mean it's quite a bit bigger than the baldy.
That's an enormous burden.

501
00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:53.830
And they're native to Colorado and the out.
Yeah,
they're,

502
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.890
they're probably the most widely distributed eagle in North America.

503
00:29:56.891 --> 00:30:01.810
I mean all the way through Mexico there and they are a crazy predator.

504
00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:07.120
<v 2>Yeah.
I've seen some videos of them killing wolves on,
we does the Mongolia,</v>

505
00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:11.740
the Mongolian guys.
That's bizarre.
They've trained these eagles to hunt

506
00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.360
<v 0>Wolf's for it.
That's pretty crazy.</v>

507
00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:18.840
He had said it's an enormous bird and it's really crazy to think that at one

508
00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:22.690
point in time they were even larger.
You know,
they have much,

509
00:30:22.691 --> 00:30:26.260
much larger birds of prey in North America.
Look at the face on that thing.

510
00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.540
Damn those eyeballs.
Yeah.
Apparently that's what I was studying.

511
00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:36.250
Their eyesight and they can spot medium sized pray from up to two miles away,

512
00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:40.870
two miles.
Isn't that fun?
I mean that's the thing that,

513
00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:46.650
one of the things that just so much fascinates me about animals especially is

514
00:30:46.931 --> 00:30:51.931
they have capabilities that it's almost hard with all our technology to even

515
00:30:52.271 --> 00:30:54.460
replicate.
If you really think about it,

516
00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:56.860
there's a lot of weird stuff on this planet.

517
00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:02.430
Dolphins using sonar and eagles being able to see two miles away or it was just

518
00:31:03.071 --> 00:31:08.071
a lot of crazy things in nature that it's taken us years and years to replicate

519
00:31:08.621 --> 00:31:11.740
some kind of machine or contraption where we can even compare it to it and in

520
00:31:11.741 --> 00:31:15.370
some cases we haven't even come close like this smell that a bloodhound can pick

521
00:31:15.371 --> 00:31:16.204
up.
Exactly.

522
00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:21.450
Smelling things that have been there ages ago and we don't have any idea like

523
00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:27.380
<v 2>we don't have any idea how to make a piece of equipment that can smell something</v>

524
00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:32.690
in the distance the way a dog can with dogs.
I mean,
Kim,

525
00:31:32.691 --> 00:31:35.570
I would just love to wonder.
I would love to experience what are they,

526
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.910
what's going on inside their nose when they,
when they catch a scent,

527
00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:44.060
like what is that?
What are they catching all we're a bird walked.
It's crazy.

528
00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:44.911
Yeah,
they're,

529
00:31:44.911 --> 00:31:49.911
they say that the comparison is a with skunk spray because with skunk spray,

530
00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:55.550
a person can pick up parts per million in a way that you can't with any other

531
00:31:55.551 --> 00:31:58.970
spray with any of smell.
Rather like a,
when you're driving down the street,

532
00:31:58.971 --> 00:32:02.420
like there's this area near my house and as I'm driving on my way home,

533
00:32:02.421 --> 00:32:07.400
I smell sconsin this one spot all the time and they're probably blocks away from

534
00:32:07.401 --> 00:32:12.140
me,
but I smelled them so clearly.
Like I rolled down the window.

535
00:32:12.141 --> 00:32:15.200
Like you could sleep up there right there and they were there days ago probably.

536
00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.830
Yeah,
it could be or it could be.
Well,
they're definitely not right there.

537
00:32:18.831 --> 00:32:20.330
They're probably blocks away from me.

538
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:22.160
There's nothing else that I could think of that,

539
00:32:22.161 --> 00:32:26.150
that small that you could smell blocks away.
Yeah,
that's crazy.

540
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:30.530
They say that that's kind of like a dog,
but way better.

541
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:34.940
Like they know where it is.
Then I'll just go,
fuck,
what is that?
They go,
oh,

542
00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:39.590
it's over there.
It's over there.
Yeah,
Dude.
Like I think it's,
you can make,

543
00:32:39.591 --> 00:32:42.120
make them smell a dude socks.
And then he hit my,

544
00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.520
they'll know he's over there and they can chase his ass down just like you could

545
00:32:46.521 --> 00:32:50.120
smell skunk.
They could smell a person like that.
It's fucking

546
00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:53.580
<v 1>crazy.
So if,
have you been elk hunting yet?
Not yet.</v>

547
00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:55.860
One of the things I always tell people is,

548
00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:59.550
especially if you haven't been helping most of the elk that we end up killing,

549
00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:03.120
I attribute to smelling him first and people that don't,

550
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:06.000
elk hunt would never pick up on it.

551
00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:10.170
But I'm hunting with my knows almost as much as I'm using any other tactic.

552
00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.210
Really.
Oh yeah.
And I'll,
I'll,

553
00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:15.300
I always keep a lighter in my pocket and as soon as I pick up the scent,

554
00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:18.600
if flipped the lighter on and see which way the wind's going because you'll

555
00:33:18.601 --> 00:33:22.830
catch it.
Like if the wind blows first split second or swirls,

556
00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.430
you'll smell it and you can get right in.
And I,

557
00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:30.740
I can distinguish the difference between the smell of an elk and we're an Alex

558
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:31.050
Ben,

559
00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:36.000
you can actually smell it in elks urinated right here where there's a wall low

560
00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:40.890
and there's a different smell between that.
And the smell of an animal.

561
00:33:40.891 --> 00:33:45.390
So I'll tell my clients will say,
I smell an elk lake,
a physical animal.

562
00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:49.140
Get be ready.
It's,
it's within x amount of distance.

563
00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:53.010
And just through practice you can,
you can decipher those things.

564
00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:56.820
<v 2>What is,
is there a way you could describe it?
Like it was the smelling,</v>

565
00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:01.230
<v 1>so I s uh,
smells are the hardest thing on the planet.
Describe uh,
an,</v>

566
00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.150
an elk smells a lot like a beef cow,
but there's a different,

567
00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:08.920
a different note to it and the,
the smell of on say a bowl.

568
00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:12.970
A live animal.
It's a,
it's a weird,
it almost smells hot.

569
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:16.470
I don't know how to describe it,
but you can,
you can smell the difference.

570
00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:21.490
It's stronger and it,
it just smells different.
Hot.
Yeah.
I don't,

571
00:34:21.491 --> 00:34:26.350
I don't know.
It's like if the very end of the scent you can,
you can pick it up.

572
00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:30.120
<v 2>Does their smell vary based on whether or not they're in the Rut?</v>

573
00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:35.160
<v 1>Yeah,
it does.
Well,
the intensity of their smell varies.
The A cow.</v>

574
00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:39.870
A cow elk will smell different when she's in heat or during the Rut.

575
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:42.090
Same with meal deer.
You'll smell meal deer as well.

576
00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.210
<v 2>Well,
I know when we hunted mule deer,</v>

577
00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:50.860
a Renault was telling us don't touch the tarsal gland cause that gland you,

578
00:34:50.861 --> 00:34:52.960
if you get that on you or if you get it on the,

579
00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:56.440
especially if you get it on the immediate thing,
it just fucks up everything.

580
00:34:56.441 --> 00:34:57.910
Yeah.
But does that smell like

581
00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:04.510
<v 1>smells like musty dear?
Just like funk.
Yeah.
Funk dear funk.</v>

582
00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:08.190
And you can,
have you ever got it on the meat before?
No,
not that I know.

583
00:35:08.191 --> 00:35:11.360
If I did have one mule deer that I shot during the Rut,
uh,

584
00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:16.490
with my recurve bow and it was not as good as other deer,

585
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:22.450
it was probably one of the worst tasting deer in.
So maybe I did somehow.
Huh?

586
00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:26.220
Cause I thought I was eating it and going,
this tastes like they smell.

587
00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.840
It's usually tie make sausage.

588
00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:36.120
Usually they smell right,
it tastes good,
tastes awesome.
But that must,

589
00:35:36.121 --> 00:35:40.080
it could have been that.
It just could have been,
I don't know.
Who knows really?

590
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:43.140
What is a,
if you doing this show,

591
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:46.980
what has been the most surprising thing when you're analyzing all these

592
00:35:46.981 --> 00:35:48.780
different animals in their hunting tactics?

593
00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:53.810
I think the most surprising thing is humans have a natural innate ability

594
00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:01.160
hunting ability that is very comparable to animals that have to hunt to survive.

595
00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.680
And I say that like we,
one of the,

596
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:11.400
one of the things that really brought this to light was one of our last episodes

597
00:36:11.401 --> 00:36:14.070
of the season.
We look at the River Otter River on it.

598
00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:18.570
Well it's a mammal that hunts underwater.
We're mammals can we hunt underwater?

599
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:22.020
And I'm pretty much from the desert.

600
00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:24.870
So water is people are in the water,

601
00:36:24.871 --> 00:36:28.650
but I think of it as something that people have trained their whole lives to do

602
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:33.150
or whatever,
you know,
be efficient,
free diving.

603
00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:38.390
So I go to Florida and kind of just try to uncover how humans compared to

604
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.950
mammals at hunter water.

605
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:45.870
It turns out we have the same guy reflexes in other things as other mammals that

606
00:36:45.871 --> 00:36:50.220
hunter under water and we,
anybody off the street can initiate these,

607
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:53.130
these reflexes thing that our trouble is,
is our mind.

608
00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.680
We have this mental threshold that we have to get over.

609
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.590
But once we get over that,
within two hours,

610
00:36:58.591 --> 00:37:02.310
I was able to hold my breath for over four minutes.
What crazy.

611
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:05.040
What's all the mentee?
You're in really good shape.
No,

612
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:09.570
this is the guy that I did this free diving course and the guy is like,

613
00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:10.500
we could take,
if,

614
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:14.820
if everyone could just block mental things out of their mind,

615
00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:18.990
pretty much the average person off the street could easily hold their breath for

616
00:37:18.991 --> 00:37:23.250
three minutes.
And if you could completely clear your mind,

617
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:26.160
pretty much everyone could hold their breath for three or four to five minutes.

618
00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:31.320
That's insane.
It's crazy.
So it's just the panic,
the freaking out.

619
00:37:31.321 --> 00:37:33.550
Like I gotta breathe,
you gotta breathe.
But there,

620
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:37.360
there's this mammalian dive reflex in it.
It restricts your capillaries,

621
00:37:37.361 --> 00:37:40.660
slows your heart rate automatically.
Uh,
your,

622
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:45.770
your spleen releases more red blood cells so your body consumes less oxygen.

623
00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:49.980
It's the exact same thing that happens in whales,
dolphins,
auditors.

624
00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:54.000
So we're just born with these predators,

625
00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:56.820
these things that other male other predators have.

626
00:37:57.270 --> 00:38:02.270
And it kind of really comes out in this TV show and that that's one of the

627
00:38:02.341 --> 00:38:06.270
things that I really wanted to do this because looking at it and talking about

628
00:38:06.271 --> 00:38:07.860
it,
he say,
what,
what are you doing?

629
00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.620
And at the onset it sounds completely ridiculous,

630
00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:15.660
especially to a guy like me that made most of my life hunting.
So I go,

631
00:38:15.661 --> 00:38:16.990
okay,
well what am I doing here?
I'm,

632
00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:22.100
I'm trying to dissect nature and see his hunting really something that's natural

633
00:38:22.531 --> 00:38:25.710
for humans to do.
Are we meant to be hunters?
Are we born to be hunters?

634
00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.230
And obviously there's a big learning curve in it,

635
00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:33.320
but there we are very similar to these other animals that are born predators.

636
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.310
What the only makes sense if buffalo

637
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:41.230
<v 2>have a natural instinct to avoid by pedal hominids cause they've seen that,
okay,</v>

638
00:38:41.231 --> 00:38:44.770
they get shot or get killed and they know that wolves come around.
Okay.

639
00:38:44.771 --> 00:38:47.380
Don't run,
stay put,
and we'll fuck these wolves up.

640
00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:51.550
Like it almost seems like all this information just gets passed on somehow or

641
00:38:51.551 --> 00:38:55.570
another through genetics.
And that's how these animals,
uh,
managed to be here.

642
00:38:55.990 --> 00:39:00.760
We would only make sense that if we've gotten to 2015 the way we got here is by

643
00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:04.120
eating everything that we could eat up til now,

644
00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:07.930
including every animal that we could figure out how to hunt and all those skills

645
00:39:07.931 --> 00:39:09.520
and all those abilities.

646
00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:14.590
Especially the idea that your spleen starts releasing extra red blood when you

647
00:39:14.591 --> 00:39:17.110
dive under water to allow you to stay.

648
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.900
There's only one reason to stay underwater.
It's to to,

649
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.750
to hide from something or to kill some things.
That's it.

650
00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:26.630
<v 1>Yeah,
it's crazy.
Wow.
That's pretty wild.</v>

651
00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:29.440
So what did you do when you,
when you did that you,

652
00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:32.570
we use a spear or something like that.
So yeah.
Then I went,

653
00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.310
we went out into the Gulf of Mexico and,

654
00:39:34.311 --> 00:39:38.750
and spirits and greater amberjack and diving down pretty deep.

655
00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.050
And it was,
it was awesome.
It's so cool.

656
00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:45.170
How long was the longest she stayed down while moving?

657
00:39:45.171 --> 00:39:48.530
So the static breath holds or you're doing four minute breath holds.

658
00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:51.830
And when I got up from those that you feel this kind of euphoric sense,

659
00:39:51.831 --> 00:39:52.430
you're like,
wow.

660
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:56.090
And you get up and you people black out at the top because they forget to take a

661
00:39:56.091 --> 00:39:59.650
breath because at that point you get to a certain point where you,

662
00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:03.620
you get up and you're like,
you aren't out at,
you aren't really out of breath.

663
00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:07.790
It's a mental thing.
It's a horrible feeling.
Like I know why,

664
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:11.660
but it is a mental thing because you realize your body doesn't,

665
00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:14.120
it tells you it needs oxygen,
but it essentially doesn't,

666
00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:15.950
well it does at some point,

667
00:40:15.951 --> 00:40:19.100
but there's people that will hold their breath for 12 minutes,

668
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:23.350
<v 2>12 minutes.
Well,
didn't that,
that Dude David Blaine,
right?</v>

669
00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:27.970
He did something where he took like oxygen in.
He did something,

670
00:40:27.971 --> 00:40:31.030
he did some sort of a sneaky trick where he,
uh,

671
00:40:31.031 --> 00:40:35.530
he breathed in pure oxygen and held it and held his breath like 17 minutes or

672
00:40:35.531 --> 00:40:36.000
something.
Right?

673
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.310
<v 1>Yeah.
This is before he did that stunt.</v>

674
00:40:39.311 --> 00:40:43.240
This is the same thing that he went through to prepare for it.
Oh really?
Yeah,

675
00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:48.090
<v 2>so he went through through free diving.
Yeah.
Performance to name it Egan.
Anyway,</v>

676
00:40:48.091 --> 00:40:52.290
he's brothers with a guy named [inaudible] who was a famous a MMA fighter and a

677
00:40:52.291 --> 00:40:54.060
Egan actually fought some MMA himself,

678
00:40:54.061 --> 00:40:57.420
but Egan was a world champion free diver and I think he could hold his breath

679
00:40:57.421 --> 00:41:02.250
for like seven minutes crazy living in Hawaii.
The law they would use,

680
00:41:02.251 --> 00:41:05.640
I'm holding their breath underwater is it was one of the strength and

681
00:41:05.641 --> 00:41:09.120
conditioning programs they would do.
They would move rocks underwater.

682
00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:11.280
Bj Penn had it on one of his,
um,

683
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.710
one of the countdown shows to one of his big fights.

684
00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:17.280
He would dive underwater and lift up a big rock and then move the rock

685
00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:20.430
underwater and drop it and come back over here and go down and move it again,

686
00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.660
drop and come back over here.
I've heard

687
00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:27.200
<v 1>through the grapevine that a lot of athletes are doing these breath holds before</v>

688
00:41:27.201 --> 00:41:28.940
competitions because they're,

689
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.840
they're naturally naturally creating more red blood cells.

690
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:34.430
Performance enhancing

691
00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:39.140
<v 2>breath holds.
Wow.
That makes sense.
Yeah,
that makes sense.
If,
if,</v>

692
00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:43.490
if you're saying that the spleen releases it when you're underwater,

693
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:47.030
it probably is releasing it cause you're holding your breath.
Correct.
Yeah.

694
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:52.290
Wow.
It's just,
it's going to be the new doping fuck

695
00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:56.360
blood doping,
but there's a lot of,

696
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:58.730
there's a lot of athletes that are doing these,

697
00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:04.730
initiating these natural responses to enhance their performance.
Yeah.

698
00:42:04.731 --> 00:42:08.810
That's one of the big ones that I've been really getting into over the last few

699
00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:09.860
months or a year or so actually is um,

700
00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:15.040
cryogenic therapy where you go into this chamber that's 250 degrees below zero.

701
00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:19.550
Wow.
You put a surgical mask on earmuffs,
on gloves.
Uh,

702
00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:24.580
you have underwear on and you wear socks and like rubber crocs so that you uh,

703
00:42:25.191 --> 00:42:27.920
your foot doesn't touch the bottom cause you will get frostbite.

704
00:42:27.921 --> 00:42:28.671
Anything you touch,

705
00:42:28.671 --> 00:42:32.480
you'll get frostbite and he stepped in this thing for 250 degrees below zero for

706
00:42:32.481 --> 00:42:37.481
three minutes and you get out and you feel fucking fantastic when you get out.

707
00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:41.780
You feel like you could jump over the building just wow.
You just,

708
00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.610
everything just feels so good once your,

709
00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:46.700
because your body thinks it's going to die if your body pulls all his blood

710
00:42:46.701 --> 00:42:51.260
until your internal organs and when you come out they actually do a temperature

711
00:42:51.261 --> 00:42:51.591
test.

712
00:42:51.591 --> 00:42:54.470
The surface of your skin and the surface of my skin is usually somewhere around

713
00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:56.660
30 30 to 35 degrees.

714
00:42:56.661 --> 00:43:01.661
It's like it gets really cold and then immediately your blood just rushes back

715
00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:07.490
to all your extremities and the anti inflammatory response is spectacular.

716
00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:10.730
So people have like pretty significant injuries,
arthritis,

717
00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.400
like even people that are like close,

718
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:15.530
borderline and needing like hip replacements.

719
00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:19.100
They've been able to put it off by doing this cryotherapy and mitigate almost

720
00:43:19.101 --> 00:43:20.960
all the pain.
That's pretty cool.

721
00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:25.640
That's because it's funny the the Mammalian dive reflex response.

722
00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.470
When your face hits cold water,

723
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:31.220
it starts to initiate because that's closing those capillaries and it's probably

724
00:43:31.221 --> 00:43:36.020
a very similar process that's going on with that Cryo.
Then I may make sense.

725
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:39.890
I used to take cold showers like real hardcore cold showers.

726
00:43:39.891 --> 00:43:41.120
When I lived in Boston,

727
00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:45.680
there was this guy named Bob Calf umbrella that I used to do taekwondo with and

728
00:43:45.681 --> 00:43:49.220
he was like a,
he was a senior student.
He was like ahead of me.

729
00:43:49.221 --> 00:43:52.100
He was a black ball before I was,
he was like way and he was,

730
00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:56.330
he was fucking mad man.
He's asleep at the gym train all day long.

731
00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.410
He'd always see him training,

732
00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:02.060
but he was also into like forcing himself to do things that he didn't like to do

733
00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:06.470
it to be uncomfortable and want to do is in mid January who'd take cold showers

734
00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:11.720
and it was fucking cold.
Take your talking about code 33 degree water,

735
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:12.140
you know,

736
00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:15.740
it was like just barely cold enough to not be frozen in the pipes and he would

737
00:44:15.741 --> 00:44:18.560
turn that shit on and he would take a shower in there and it would just breathe

738
00:44:18.561 --> 00:44:22.700
in there.
I am like Ugh.
And I remember trying and I did it a few times,

739
00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:26.720
but it's just like you can't,
that's the thing that freaks you out.

740
00:44:26.721 --> 00:44:30.680
It's like you got no breath.
Yeah.
Why can't I breathe like,

741
00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:32.880
and she made being cold makes sense.

742
00:44:32.881 --> 00:44:37.080
But why can't I breathe and I guess is probably the same sort of a response.

743
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:38.730
It is.
Yeah.
Wow.

744
00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:43.380
Who would think that maybe taking a really cold shower before you perform,

745
00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:47.400
you know,
before you do anything athletic would,
would benefit you as well?

746
00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:50.130
<v 1>I would think so.
There's a lot of,</v>

747
00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:54.560
there's a lot of things that nature can teach us that,
you know,

748
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:55.980
our bodies just do

749
00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.150
<v 2>what was,
what was the motivation to do this show?</v>

750
00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:01.940
Because this is a very different than solo hunter,

751
00:45:01.941 --> 00:45:04.950
which is how I found out about you,
which is really cool show.
Uh,

752
00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:09.020
it's still round you if you guys want to catch some episodes and in that show

753
00:45:09.021 --> 00:45:13.520
you would go out by yourself.
Just bring cameras and really fascinating stuff.

754
00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:13.960
<v 1>And I'm,</v>

755
00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:17.650
and I'm still doing that show and I don't really plan on changing anything with

756
00:45:17.651 --> 00:45:20.740
that because I still,
my bread and butter is going out and hunting.

757
00:45:20.741 --> 00:45:21.574
It's what I love.

758
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:26.910
But I wanted to get a little bit deeper and do something different and buy

759
00:45:28.481 --> 00:45:29.314
something different.

760
00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:34.360
I wanted to also do something that looks at hunting in any person watching the

761
00:45:35.531 --> 00:45:39.760
show,
whether they're a hunter,
not could look at this and go,
you know what?

762
00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:40.661
There's something here.

763
00:45:40.661 --> 00:45:45.661
There's something that shows me that humans are meant to be hunters.

764
00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:51.550
If and,
and if I can make one person think that and go,
okay,
well maybe,

765
00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:54.730
maybe hunting isn't so bad.
Then for me that's,

766
00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:57.310
that's a bonus because it's something that I love.

767
00:45:57.311 --> 00:46:01.450
I don't want to see hunting go away because if I did,
then that's,

768
00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.400
that's my passion.
That's what I'm all about.

769
00:46:03.401 --> 00:46:07.390
So if all of a sudden it disappeared wasn't allowed or whatever,

770
00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:09.850
people didn't understand it,
then for me,

771
00:46:09.851 --> 00:46:12.610
I feel like I don't know what I would do.

772
00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.070
<v 2>Is that really possible though?</v>

773
00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:20.810
<v 1>No,
I,
it could be.
I mean you never really know because it's not guaranteed.</v>

774
00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:25.160
There's just like mountain lion hunting isn't allowed in California.

775
00:46:25.161 --> 00:46:27.830
It makes no sense ecologically or whatever.

776
00:46:27.831 --> 00:46:32.030
If people's emotions get involved with management or whatever,

777
00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.060
<v 2>it just seems like change California.</v>

778
00:46:34.061 --> 00:46:39.061
Such an extreme example of people who don't have experience with wildlife.

779
00:46:39.161 --> 00:46:42.460
We're making those choices or definitely don't have experience with hunting.

780
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.820
Yeah.
The whole department of fish and game out here isn't fishing game.

781
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:47.500
It's fishing wildlife.

782
00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:52.000
It's in the few states that has a distinction in the way labels itself.

783
00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:55.170
<v 1>But the other reason is I</v>

784
00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:58.290
professionally might,

785
00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:03.320
I've made my living hunting and there's always been this idea for me of kind of

786
00:47:04.651 --> 00:47:05.640
taking it deeper.

787
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:10.440
And in this show I actually learned something every time I do.

788
00:47:10.441 --> 00:47:14.040
One of these is as ridiculous as the premise might be or whatever we're trying

789
00:47:14.041 --> 00:47:16.680
to do.
Seemed ridiculous to me sometimes at first.

790
00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:20.820
And then I go through the steps and I really learned something and if I can

791
00:47:20.821 --> 00:47:22.740
learn something,
I've been doing this forever,

792
00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:26.040
then I feel like other people watching can learn something.
Other hunters,

793
00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:27.810
other people in general.

794
00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:30.070
<v 2>Yeah,
no doubt.
Um,
I think</v>

795
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:33.670
<v 1>just the hunting itself is a learning experience.</v>

796
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:39.510
There's so many bad ideas that people have or are just bad con misconceptions

797
00:47:41.021 --> 00:47:43.330
about hunting.
And a lot of it comes down to,

798
00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:46.450
we look at hunting or people look at hunting.

799
00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:51.010
A lot of times they look at the negative aspects of like trophy hunting,

800
00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:53.470
trophy hunting seems kind of gross to people.
Like they're,

801
00:47:53.830 --> 00:47:57.480
the recent one was that lady was laying down next to a giraffe.
Yeah I saw.

802
00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:02.950
That's just really,
it's just poor taste,

803
00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:07.480
poor management,
poor thinking like you,
you really,

804
00:48:07.481 --> 00:48:09.190
you could keep going on and on forever.

805
00:48:09.191 --> 00:48:13.480
Like why would you lie down next to a giraffe smiling,

806
00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:18.790
you know there's the whole thing is is very strange and w the real fuck up about

807
00:48:18.791 --> 00:48:23.791
it is that it puts out this image that confuses the real issue at hand,

808
00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:31.020
which is this was a large non breeding male that they were going to take out

809
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:33.610
anyway.
Like this was,

810
00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:38.500
they had already deemed through their conservation efforts that they were going

811
00:48:38.501 --> 00:48:39.334
to take this,

812
00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.500
this giraffe out and that they were going to use it to feed these villagers.

813
00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:49.770
So her paying money to go and shoot this thing actually helps all these

814
00:48:49.811 --> 00:48:52.390
villagers,
it gives them food.
Then they take the money,

815
00:48:52.391 --> 00:48:54.670
they can apply the money to,
you know,
whatever,

816
00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:58.540
making wells or whatever they do with the money that they get from,
um,

817
00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:00.340
from hunter's paying to hunt these animals.

818
00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:03.790
There's a benefit to it because that animal wasn't going to be around much

819
00:49:03.791 --> 00:49:07.120
longer anyway,
her stepping in and go,
but then,

820
00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:10.430
but then when you put it on Facebook and you're smiling and you're,

821
00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:14.230
it's all so fucking confusing.
Like to everybody else that goes,
well,

822
00:49:14.231 --> 00:49:18.790
you're an asshole.
You just shot a fucking giraffe jr who eats giraffes?
You know,

823
00:49:18.791 --> 00:49:19.624
like,
no,
no one's,

824
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:22.990
you're not like going over there to feed your family by shooting giraffes.

825
00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:24.550
And then you find out,
well,

826
00:49:24.551 --> 00:49:28.810
you actually can eat drafts and actually drafts tastes like a lot of different

827
00:49:28.811 --> 00:49:32.320
animals.
They're related to meet.
Yeah,
they're deer.

828
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:34.660
They're essentially crazy necked antelopes right?

829
00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:37.750
Isn't that what they're their family,
their,
yeah.
Yeah.

830
00:49:37.751 --> 00:49:42.610
I mean antelopes are delicious.
Yeah.
But giraffes are so nice.

831
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:44.290
You go to the zoo.
You know,

832
00:49:44.291 --> 00:49:48.670
I had this bit in my last special about giraffes being like the only animal that

833
00:49:48.671 --> 00:49:50.310
I don't feel bad there at the zoo.
Yeah.

834
00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:54.520
Cause they wake up and they're like on another day with no lions and they just

835
00:49:54.521 --> 00:49:56.350
wander around like having a great old time.

836
00:49:56.530 --> 00:49:59.950
Like we're so confident that giraffes are nice that they let babies feed them.

837
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.510
Yeah.
Like when my daughter was two,

838
00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:06.570
I was holding her up in my arms and she's got her little tiny little baby hand

839
00:50:06.571 --> 00:50:09.370
out with a piece of lettuce and the giraffe comes over,

840
00:50:09.371 --> 00:50:12.250
wraps its tongue around the lettuce and takes and she's laughing and like

841
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:17.400
they're so confident at the zoo in the giraffes behavior at Dell had babies feed

842
00:50:17.591 --> 00:50:19.420
them,
which is crazy.
In the wild though,

843
00:50:19.421 --> 00:50:24.421
giraffes can be like a Bolger African be pretty dangerous animal because

844
00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:25.850
probably because of their size.
But if you,

845
00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:30.900
I've seen drafts fighting their necks and wham and did you use their weapon?

846
00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:35.600
They whip their head into each other,
but they're uh,
you know,

847
00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:38.540
I think people assume too,
like,
oh,
drafts.
Really.

848
00:50:38.541 --> 00:50:42.650
It would be really easy to kill because they're so big.
And I got this,
uh,
uh,

849
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:46.370
I was working in South Africa and on this place there was a future apps there

850
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.310
and they would get this disease from ticks.

851
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:55.030
And so the guy would hire these professional hunters like myself or whatever to

852
00:50:55.850 --> 00:51:00.850
shoot,
like inoculate the giraffes with these paint fill with like,
um,
uh,

853
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:05.780
we call it douse or drench.
It's kills parasites.

854
00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:07.840
So it's a paintball gun.

855
00:51:07.841 --> 00:51:11.090
So you have to get closer than you would with a bow and sneak up on these
drafts.

856
00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:14.930
The drafts were the hardest thing on the place to inoculate.
Oh yeah.

857
00:51:14.931 --> 00:51:18.380
Because they can see you coming forever.

858
00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.780
And they were skittish because they just,

859
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:24.230
they wanted these drafts to survive and to have the drafts had actually gotten

860
00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.790
killed by power lines.
So there's only a few giraffes.

861
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:32.440
There's a big windstorm and two giraffes,
boom,
zapped dead.
Oh,

862
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:35.560
the lines came down and cook them.
Whoa.
I don't know if that,

863
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:40.310
how it happened or what,
just whipping in the wind and killed both of them.
Whoa.

864
00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:41.330
But,

865
00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:46.330
so the guy was really set on inoculate or dowsing these giraffes.

866
00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:52.760
So I went out there and I don't know why because a lot I would,

867
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:56.810
there was a lot of other animals in this area that just weren't accustomed to

868
00:51:56.811 --> 00:52:00.830
the ticks there because they might've been from another region and they kind of

869
00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:05.350
do this on these giant,
I don't even know what you call him,
preserves in Africa.

870
00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:07.610
If you go on a photo safari in South Africa or whatever,

871
00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:12.970
it's essentially there's places where say they bring in animals and maybe that

872
00:52:13.971 --> 00:52:15.830
animal wasn't indigenous to that region,

873
00:52:15.831 --> 00:52:20.831
but they swapped with this game reserve area over here to kind of integrate

874
00:52:21.621 --> 00:52:24.500
breeding and keep the populations existing.

875
00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:29.860
And so you bring in a giraffe to this portion of Africa that maybe hasn't had

876
00:52:30.171 --> 00:52:33.890
your ass for,
who knows how long and the ticks there will kill him.

877
00:52:33.891 --> 00:52:36.020
They get these diseases from the ticks.
So,

878
00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:39.530
but there was a lot of other animals like that too.

879
00:52:39.531 --> 00:52:44.150
So I'd go out at night or whatever and try to shoot these animals antelope with

880
00:52:44.151 --> 00:52:47.210
paintballs that would actually kill the ticks.

881
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:50.990
And I never saw the drafts at night.
I don't know why.
Maybe I just,

882
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:55.670
it was kind of weird.
You'd think you'd find them
trees,

883
00:52:56.330 --> 00:52:58.670
but maybe they're laying down.
Maybe that's why I didn't find them.

884
00:52:58.671 --> 00:53:00.020
I don't know why I couldn't figure that out.

885
00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:04.190
But they were the hardest things to shoot with a paintball gun.
So there it is.

886
00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:08.390
Drafts paintballing drafts is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.

887
00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:12.560
Those wild game preserves and Africa.
Boy,

888
00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:16.700
that is a goddamn conundrum and if there's any ever anything that's stirred up

889
00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:17.600
the,
the,

890
00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:23.120
the sort of the horrible feelings anti hunters have,

891
00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:25.770
it's those game preserves.
We could just go there

892
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:31.280
<v 2>and just kill these animals and it's such a catch 22 because these animals,</v>

893
00:53:32.101 --> 00:53:37.101
a lot of them were bordering on being extinct just a couple of decades ago and

894
00:53:37.351 --> 00:53:40.080
now their populations are thriving,

895
00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:44.730
but the vast majority of them are in these high fence game operations.

896
00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:45.750
It's real weird.

897
00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:46.281
<v 1>Well,</v>

898
00:53:46.281 --> 00:53:51.281
even in the places that aren't sh hunting where they just are for photo safaris

899
00:53:52.101 --> 00:53:55.910
or what have you,
you get,
say you bring in,

900
00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:59.570
I'll pick a species cooch way kudu.
There you go.

901
00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:04.870
So you bring in Kudu to displace where it could be 200,000 acres and people are

902
00:54:05.961 --> 00:54:08.510
going to come and take pictures of these animals.
Well,

903
00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:09.620
if there's no hunting there,

904
00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:13.340
even with the lions and other things that they have there,

905
00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:17.810
the Kudu pop,
one of these populations may explode.

906
00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:22.040
They cannot sustain themselves.
They have to manage these areas too.

907
00:54:22.041 --> 00:54:27.041
So a lot of times they do game captures or they may allow some hunting that the

908
00:54:27.081 --> 00:54:29.060
people taking photos don't even know about.

909
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:31.760
But whenever you have these populations,
it's just,

910
00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:36.960
it's the same as managing animals in the state of Montana.

911
00:54:37.401 --> 00:54:40.760
Just on a smaller scale.
You know you have a limited amount of food supply,

912
00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:43.880
you have x amount of animals.
These populations are growing at this rate.

913
00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.710
The predators are only taking care of this much.

914
00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:48.650
Therefore excess has to be taken care of.

915
00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:53.360
And some of those excess animals are animals that used to be near extinction and

916
00:54:53.361 --> 00:54:56.840
now if you don't manage them,
they'll,
they'll all die off of wherever they're at.

917
00:54:57.220 --> 00:55:00.280
<v 2>That's so crazy.
Yeah,
it's a,
it's so crazy.
Also the,</v>

918
00:55:00.281 --> 00:55:03.340
this is a giant booming economy in Africa now.

919
00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:08.230
<v 1>Oh yeah.
And,
and all that.
It's a,
it's a,</v>

920
00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:12.100
it's a business on multilevels too because the land owner now owns the meat.

921
00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:16.180
So then he'll either sell the meat or give it to people living there,

922
00:55:16.181 --> 00:55:17.014
working there.

923
00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:20.820
<v 2>Yeah.
If you go over to Africa to hunt,
you can't really bring that meat back.</v>

924
00:55:20.821 --> 00:55:23.220
Kenya.
Nah,
but you can't in New Zealand.
Yep.

925
00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:26.260
<v 1>Can you,
and you can hose up a New Zealand's clean.</v>

926
00:55:26.261 --> 00:55:28.600
They don't have anything that we don't have.
So you can't,

927
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:30.010
you couldn't bring meat into New Zealand,

928
00:55:30.011 --> 00:55:32.140
but you can bring me out of New Zealand.
Okay.

929
00:55:32.141 --> 00:55:35.600
So you don't have to worry about some funky new type thing.

930
00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:40.690
They don't have anything.
It's crazy.
Yeah.
It's funny.
It bulla,

931
00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:41.320
the,

932
00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:45.490
one of my friends is a professional hunter in South Africa and a lot of people

933
00:55:45.491 --> 00:55:48.130
didn't want to go to Africa after they heard the Ebola.

934
00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:53.700
Well from Africa is such a large continent from where he is to where the bullet

935
00:55:54.101 --> 00:55:57.280
is is further away than Atlanta,
Georgia.

936
00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:03.470
<v 2>Wow.
Not to Americans for Africa.</v>

937
00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:06.080
The same shit.
One over there.

938
00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:10.130
They all got aids from the monkeys.

939
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:16.880
Yeah.
We don't realize how big it is.
We,
we did an image on the podcast recently.

940
00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:20.240
We uh,
we pulled up,
there's an image of Africa,

941
00:56:20.241 --> 00:56:24.460
the continent and how enormous it is and how other continents

942
00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:27.550
<v 0>you could stuff inside of Africa.</v>

943
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:29.650
And it's so shocking when you,

944
00:56:29.651 --> 00:56:34.180
when you realize how big it really is because on a map,
there it is right there.

945
00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:38.350
Look,
China,
United States,
India,

946
00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:41.860
Eastern Europe and a bunch of other shit in there too.

947
00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:46.480
I mean all of it just stuffed in there.
The UK,
everything stuffed in there.

948
00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:49.240
Jam packed.
That's crazy.
That's nuts.
That's a cool picture.

949
00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:51.550
It's a very cool picture.
This is a,
God damn sure.

950
00:56:51.551 --> 00:56:55.120
Which country are huge continent rather.
That's the other thing is Africa.

951
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:57.620
People think of,
it's like United States,
African Africa,
you know,

952
00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.440
it's the fucking continent man.

953
00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:05.220
Different facets and people and problems and solutions and a huge spot of

954
00:57:06.581 --> 00:57:10.390
controversy now for hunting and this,
this whole trophy hunting thing.

955
00:57:10.391 --> 00:57:13.600
Rinella wrote a great piece about it.
The,
the,
the really,

956
00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:16.230
he wrote an amazing piece about,
um,

957
00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:21.040
the woman as these young girls that are getting involved in hunting and it's

958
00:57:21.041 --> 00:57:22.840
like become a career for a lot of them.

959
00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:26.260
They look real pretty and they go over there and shoot animals and pose with

960
00:57:26.261 --> 00:57:29.600
them and all the pro hunters get on their side and all the anti hunters have,

961
00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:31.630
or Facebooks and death threats and it's like,

962
00:57:31.631 --> 00:57:35.050
it's almost like a dance that everyone's doing.
But what he wrote about it,

963
00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:37.180
which I,
I thought it was really fascinating.
It was like,

964
00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:41.030
I think a lot of this is sexism.
Oh,
for sure.
For sure.
Right?
Yeah.

965
00:57:41.170 --> 00:57:42.790
You're dealing with is pretty blonde.

966
00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:45.040
Who goes over there and shoots all these animals.

967
00:57:45.050 --> 00:57:49.730
If it was a fat old guy from Denmark,
nobody would give a fuck.

968
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:52.030
It wouldn't be storming that guy's Facebook page.

969
00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:55.750
People would find it distasteful that he shall lie and like an asshole.

970
00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:59.380
But that would be where it ends.
It's because,
yeah,
it's because it's women and,

971
00:57:59.430 --> 00:58:02.320
and as much as it's the same people,

972
00:58:02.321 --> 00:58:07.120
it's kind of a hypocritical way to look at it too,
because they,
they go,

973
00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:09.580
oh,
there's a lot of the people that are doing this.

974
00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:11.710
Maybe it's just me being hypocritical as well,

975
00:58:11.711 --> 00:58:14.260
but a lot of the people that do it probably look at him as a women and go,

976
00:58:14.850 --> 00:58:16.240
you know,
if it's a man,

977
00:58:16.241 --> 00:58:19.450
it's different because hunting's a man's sport and they see these pretty girls

978
00:58:19.451 --> 00:58:21.760
doing it and they,
if they're out of place or something,

979
00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:24.370
whereas hunters don't even think like that.
It's like,
oh,
a woman hunting.
Yeah.

980
00:58:24.371 --> 00:58:26.260
That's great.
Well,
you know what it is too.

981
00:58:26.261 --> 00:58:30.730
I think it's also that they're attractive white women with blonde hair.

982
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:36.340
You just think all these evil thoughts of racism and cruelty and just these

983
00:58:36.341 --> 00:58:41.341
monster Arion women that are shooting animals and posing with a big stupid

984
00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:46.690
whitened teeth.
Smiles.
Yeah.
It is a form of sexist.

985
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:51.010
I,
I feel like now on the flip side,

986
00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:53.920
some of them probably just,
I mean it's the easy,

987
00:58:53.921 --> 00:58:56.200
if you wanted to jump in that spotlight,

988
00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:58.480
go shoot yourself align and where a cheerleader,

989
00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:02.020
I'm actually planning on doing that next week.

990
00:59:02.021 --> 00:59:05.070
They show little blow up Apex Predator.
It was

991
00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:10.360
cheerleader outfit.
Have my pom poms and go out and chase them lines.

992
00:59:10.361 --> 00:59:11.100
That's what you need to do.

993
00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:15.540
You need to take over the transgender hunting markets.
It's right.

994
00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:16.540
It's right.

995
00:59:16.540 --> 00:59:21.110
If you became the first openly transgender or hunting or at least trends across

996
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.440
trash stressor,
not transgender,

997
00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:25.160
<v 2>that trickles down.
I don't want to get to that deep into it.</v>

998
00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:28.760
When you start pulling out a scalpel and removing balls on

999
00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:35.180
the endocrine system,
there's a lot going on there by the Cno hills in heels,

1000
00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:36.940
just a new one.
All my accounts,

1001
00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:41.450
cancer now solo hunters and I've used to get these stilettos letters,
pumps.

1002
00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:45.980
I'm really pumped for this adventure.
I wonder how many gay hunters or are two.

1003
00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:47.490
That was something that we,

1004
00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:52.250
we'd gotten into before we were trying to describe like the average hunter and I

1005
00:59:52.251 --> 00:59:54.260
said,
well how many people like,
you know,

1006
00:59:54.261 --> 00:59:59.261
like a lot of hunters tend to lean right wing and maybe that's because of gun

1007
01:00:00.561 --> 01:00:05.561
rights or second amendment ideas or just because it's like sort of a

1008
01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:09.320
traditional,
you know,
God guns and you know,

1009
01:00:09.321 --> 01:00:12.150
grills grilling.
I'm kind of going,

1010
01:00:13.550 --> 01:00:17.510
but they tend to like,
like I would say the majority,

1011
01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:21.560
I would say it's probably like more than 60% or right wing.
Yeah,

1012
01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:26.030
I'd probably say that.
Yeah.
But how many of them are gay?
I don't know.

1013
01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:29.600
Do you know any gay hunters?
I do.
You do?
Ah,
there you go.

1014
01:00:29.601 --> 01:00:32.860
I know a few of them that are actually guides like professional hundred.
Really?

1015
01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:37.670
Are they open?
Not,
no.
I mean they just tell you,

1016
01:00:37.671 --> 01:00:41.030
hey man,
you don't want to share a tent with me cause I will fuck you.

1017
01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:46.790
That's one of,
in one of those.
No,
I mean,
there I,

1018
01:00:46.791 --> 01:00:50.410
yeah,
I don't really know why wouldn't he just know that they're gay.
Yeah.

1019
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:53.600
And it just doesn't come up.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1020
01:00:53.601 --> 01:00:57.860
I think in this day and age it's more about,
I mean,

1021
01:00:57.861 --> 01:01:02.180
not that this needs to be discussed in depth,
but I think homosexuality,

1022
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:04.730
it's more like if you really do care,

1023
01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:08.570
unless you're dealing with some extremely aggressive individual that's like

1024
01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:12.740
annoying with his gayness.
Right?
Like you just won't take no for an answer.

1025
01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:17.030
Which I have seen.
I have seen,
I know a comedian like that,
he's fucking brutal,

1026
01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.150
was not so brutal anymore.
He's an older gentleman.

1027
01:01:19.170 --> 01:01:22.340
I believe he's going to calm down.
But back in the day,

1028
01:01:22.341 --> 01:01:23.720
like maybe 10 15 years ago,

1029
01:01:23.721 --> 01:01:28.130
I had a deal with them one night at a drunken bar and Montreal.
I was like,
dude,

1030
01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:31.640
you gotta get the fuck away from me.
Like I'm not gay.
You got to stop.

1031
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:33.380
She was brutal,
you know,

1032
01:01:33.381 --> 01:01:36.170
like trying to be trying to get this other dude to come upstairs and then he's

1033
01:01:36.171 --> 01:01:39.130
like,
what about you?
I'm like,
come on man,
get outta here.
Like you just,

1034
01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:42.470
you just brutal like you,
you realize what it's like to be a woman.

1035
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:47.300
They have some,
I'm not a piece of meat.
You can stand.
Eyes are up here,

1036
01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:51.350
these holes top looking at my nonfunctional breasts,
but then he started,

1037
01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:54.830
then he started to insult you and you're kinda like,
well,
what's wrong with me?

1038
01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:57.410
Latch.
Yeah.

1039
01:01:57.430 --> 01:02:02.090
He'd put starts playing mind games and then you start wanting them.
Yeah.
I just,

1040
01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.040
I,
I w I think in this day and age,

1041
01:02:04.041 --> 01:02:07.430
just because there's gonna come a point in time where the person that is

1042
01:02:07.431 --> 01:02:10.940
homophobic or racist or in any other prejudice,

1043
01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:14.360
that person is going to be like very rare,

1044
01:02:14.570 --> 01:02:18.530
very rare and like despised.
Like right now it's,

1045
01:02:18.590 --> 01:02:20.010
there's plenty of people that you

1046
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:25.010
<v 0>could hang out with that would share in your racism or share in your homophobia.</v>

1047
01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:26.880
But I think because of the Internet,

1048
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:29.490
because people are kind of understanding people a little bit better and

1049
01:02:29.491 --> 01:02:33.080
motivations a little bit better,
that's going to be less and less.
Yeah.

1050
01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:37.110
I think if more gay hunters were around,
I think that would help.

1051
01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:42.800
So you gave his blog,
they're a great way to get in.
Fabulous.
First.
Fabulous.

1052
01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:44.490
As far as that stuff,
that's a touchy one though.

1053
01:02:44.491 --> 01:02:47.910
Even people that like to eat meat,
they're like,
I have a hard time with furs.

1054
01:02:47.911 --> 01:02:49.740
Right?
Yeah.
For is it tricky?

1055
01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:54.150
They are falls into like sort of the same ideas of trophy hunting.
Like you're,

1056
01:02:54.151 --> 01:02:56.730
you're,
you're turning an animal into an object.

1057
01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:01.940
Even people that didn't meet have a problem with first or first or leathers,

1058
01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:06.090
I guess lenders because you're eating the animal underneath it.
Well,
I look,

1059
01:03:06.091 --> 01:03:09.250
I could wear these fucking converse to wholefoods.
No single Vegan.
Oh,

1060
01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:11.000
give me a heart.
There's a leather,
you know,

1061
01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.890
nobody would give me a hard time about these.
Yeah,
that'd be fine.
Leather belt,

1062
01:03:13.891 --> 01:03:16.960
no one's going to get crazy.
Is that leather interior in your car?

1063
01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:19.160
No one gives a fuck.
No one cares.

1064
01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:24.650
But if you say that you eat an animal that's not on the average every day menu,

1065
01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:29.900
you know,
if you're one of those weird dudes do go squirrel hunting,
you know,

1066
01:03:29.901 --> 01:03:33.830
all you piece of shit.
How could you shoot a squirrel?
Would,
would uh,

1067
01:03:34.190 --> 01:03:37.510
what is her analysis term?
He uses?
Um,
um,

1068
01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:42.510
charismatic megafauna like bears.
Bears are a big one.

1069
01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:47.310
People think of Yogi and booboo and all these different animals.

1070
01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:52.380
It's,
yeah,
we've given,
we've given human personalities to,
to non humans.

1071
01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:55.920
Yeah,
so we attached to them,
but Bullwinkle never caught down.

1072
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:58.800
Nobody gives a fuck if you shoot a moose,
they really don't care.

1073
01:03:58.801 --> 01:04:03.450
Rocky because of the squirrel.
Squirrel.
That's fine.
Well,
what's the cross?

1074
01:04:03.451 --> 01:04:08.190
A cute,
fluffy.
They like the most acceptable road in ever.
I don't,

1075
01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:12.570
yeah,
I think they're just kind of big,
noisy rats.
Really.
I don't even,

1076
01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:16.260
I've eaten coyote coyote before.
I ate a squirrel.
Really?

1077
01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:19.320
I've never eaten squirrels.
I don't know why.
You've never even tried it.

1078
01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:23.550
I not that I wouldn't,
but in my,
where I grew up.
Squirrels.

1079
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:25.210
You just didn't eat squirrels.
Well,

1080
01:04:25.211 --> 01:04:28.620
you got your coyote the same place I got my squirrel from Rinella,

1081
01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.120
Dj some squirrels.
Again,

1082
01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:34.230
I feel like I shouldn't go through my life without eating a squirrel.

1083
01:04:35.370 --> 01:04:36.180
I hate a pigeon.

1084
01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:39.240
The other day we had pigeons on our roof and they were just crapping all over,

1085
01:04:39.241 --> 01:04:40.610
so I shot it with a pellet gun or

1086
01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:49.290
whatever.
It's me.
It's like,
well,
yeah.

1087
01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:52.570
I feel like when you,
when you utilize it,
then it's okay.

1088
01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:56.900
It kind of it for myself.
It justifies it.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Well,
yeah,
he's a,

1089
01:04:57.130 --> 01:05:01.740
it was like now if I trap a rat and garage and I can eat that

1090
01:05:03.810 --> 01:05:05.190
unless you're really hungry.

1091
01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:09.600
I was in New York City last week and they had pigeon on the menu at a
restaurant.

1092
01:05:09.601 --> 01:05:13.470
We ate,
I call it squad.
Nope.
It was pitched and it just said pigeon it.

1093
01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.720
See that's some animals get weird.

1094
01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:22.030
There's like a weird stipulation with them where it's not a tasty edible item,

1095
01:05:22.270 --> 01:05:26.120
but no.
If you put dove there,
duck hunters love gfes,
but pigeons are tabbing.

1096
01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:30.190
Hunters love dogs,
but if you had dove on a menu in a regular restaurant,

1097
01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:31.780
the average person who's not a hunter would,

1098
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:37.830
<v 3>he's full bird.
It's the piece bird of love.</v>

1099
01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:40.890
That's the love bird.
He has the twig in its hand.

1100
01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:42.540
I start the love bird was the swallow.

1101
01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:46.160
<v 0>I don't know.
That's not the love.
That's the less burlesque bird.
Yeah,</v>

1102
01:05:46.161 --> 01:05:48.340
it's just a dirty bird that's,
I forgot.
Yeah.

1103
01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:52.840
The patients were actually brought to North America as a food source.

1104
01:05:52.841 --> 01:05:55.930
When you look at pigeons that are in New York and they're flying all over the

1105
01:05:55.931 --> 01:05:57.820
buildings and shitting all over the place,

1106
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.210
those pigeons were initially brought over as a food source.

1107
01:06:01.211 --> 01:06:02.710
They are nonnative animals.

1108
01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:06.790
My great grandma raised pigeons for food wine sold and that was like that was

1109
01:06:06.791 --> 01:06:11.020
there.
Their pigeon farmers squabbling sales.
Wow.

1110
01:06:11.021 --> 01:06:14.560
Squad salesman.
Yeah.
That's crazy.
Cause I'd seen it.

1111
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:18.130
You see it in a few Chinese food restaurants,
squad salad and other things,

1112
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:23.100
but they have to call it squad.
If you don't call,
if you call it Cajun.
This.

1113
01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:25.870
That's why I was amazed at this New York City restaurant,
but they're just,

1114
01:06:26.070 --> 01:06:28.810
New York City is on some next level culinary type shit.

1115
01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:33.880
I mean that's like,
that's locally sourced man.
That's paging from it.

1116
01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.910
Yeah,
I can see that.
It's from my jungle,

1117
01:06:37.930 --> 01:06:42.340
the jungle of my rooftop apartment.
Yeah.
There's uh,
a lot of them.

1118
01:06:42.341 --> 01:06:44.290
If you want to serve pigeons in New York,
that's like,

1119
01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:48.040
you've got a sustainable sort of an environment and they're fed well to dare eat

1120
01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:51.890
lots of garbage.
Probably not good for you.
They used to say that,
um,

1121
01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:56.560
lobster was like a poor person's food in New York.
Like way back in the day.

1122
01:06:56.830 --> 01:06:58.690
They used to,
when people wanted lobsters,

1123
01:06:58.691 --> 01:07:00.580
they would get them directly from the river.

1124
01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:04.030
They'll get them right from the East River and they would pull him out and they

1125
01:07:04.031 --> 01:07:07.780
would serve them in bars and they were like poor people food or just cause

1126
01:07:07.781 --> 01:07:12.240
they're aqua cockroaches.
Yeah.
Well they literally are a rack.

1127
01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:16.780
Spiders,
if you have an allergy to shellfish,
you also have an allergy to roaches.

1128
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:19.760
We found that out on fear factor.
That's pretty crazy.
Yeah.

1129
01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.840
People that were allergic to shellfish,
we gave them roaches and their,

1130
01:07:23.110 --> 01:07:24.180
their throat started season.

1131
01:07:24.190 --> 01:07:27.280
Oh cause they're eating the roaches in the rather show where it's like,

1132
01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:31.840
oh cockroach over here.
Oh yeah,
they're ingesting base.
We,

1133
01:07:31.841 --> 01:07:34.190
I did can't believe that.
No one knew that.
Like they,

1134
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:37.360
they would ask people what are your allergies?
And they said shellfish.
Okay.

1135
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:39.280
Eat a roach.
Same fucking thing,
man.

1136
01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:41.950
You're making anybody going to like Anna Filactic.
Shocker.
He's,

1137
01:07:41.951 --> 01:07:43.840
this guy got real close.
He was whistling.

1138
01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.380
<v 3>Ooh,</v>

1139
01:07:46.290 --> 01:07:49.010
<v 0>his mouth was a windpipe was closing down.</v>

1140
01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:52.720
Did you do when someone's dying for meeting Cockroach,
do even,

1141
01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:56.780
do you kind of like shit talk.
I'm still like you scared.
Come on man,
suck it up.

1142
01:07:56.930 --> 01:08:00.860
It was much later after the show.
Yeah.
They had eaten the cockroach.

1143
01:08:00.861 --> 01:08:04.070
They'd gone back to the hotel and that's when the reaction started kicking in.

1144
01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:05.990
It wasn't an instantaneous reaction,

1145
01:08:05.991 --> 01:08:09.680
so I don't know if maybe they have a less strong reaction from eating the

1146
01:08:09.681 --> 01:08:12.370
cockroach and they do from eating shellfish or if that's how they're,

1147
01:08:12.371 --> 01:08:15.980
the reaction normally is,
I guess there's levels.
Allergies,

1148
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.550
<v 2>right?
Yeah.
Some people are like acutely,
like I have my friend Gary,</v>

1149
01:08:19.730 --> 01:08:23.310
he can't even come over my house because I have cats.
If he opens my door,

1150
01:08:23.311 --> 01:08:27.860
I was just stuck.
He literally can't even breathe the air inside my house,

1151
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:31.130
but my wife's allergic to cats and she lives,
she's fine.

1152
01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:34.790
She just has to wash her hands.
If they touch her,
they liquor or they get there.

1153
01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:37.360
They had the cats have to be clean.
We have to bathe them.
Hmm.

1154
01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:39.470
My friend Gary can't even walk in the door,

1155
01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.570
so I guess it's like there's levels of it.

1156
01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:45.290
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's put that on cockroach allergy.</v>

1157
01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:48.330
<v 2>Is there a game animals that are people who are allergic to?
Is there any animal?</v>

1158
01:08:48.331 --> 01:08:50.890
Have you ever heard of a person being allergic to like venison or something?

1159
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:54.940
<v 1>Well,
I know and I'm kind of,
I'm allergic to antelope in a certain way.</v>

1160
01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:58.780
I greet him,
skinning it,
the blood.
When it dries,
it get hives.
Itchy.

1161
01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:03.830
Some people to get that.
Only antelope.
Yeah.
Did you ever get it checked?
No.
Huh?

1162
01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:07.570
I don't know,
but I mean cook it,
eat it all the time.
I love antelope meat,

1163
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:09.370
so I don't know.
But I've heard,

1164
01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:11.860
I've talked to other people that that happens to you.

1165
01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:12.881
<v 2>If you had to say like,</v>

1166
01:09:12.881 --> 01:09:15.910
what is your all time favorite meat if somebody restricted you to one meet for

1167
01:09:15.911 --> 01:09:16.744
the rest of your life.

1168
01:09:17.650 --> 01:09:22.000
<v 1>Tough.
Probably elk.
Yeah,
I is this just something about elk.</v>

1169
01:09:22.001 --> 01:09:26.580
It's delicious and healthy and it's good.
It's really good.

1170
01:09:26.690 --> 01:09:30.480
<v 2>It's such a majestic animal too.
I've only seen a few of them in the wild,</v>

1171
01:09:30.690 --> 01:09:32.760
but every time I see him and just like,
whoa.

1172
01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:37.320
<v 1>And it's fun animal to,
I mean it's so hard animal to hunt.</v>

1173
01:09:37.530 --> 01:09:38.400
A lot of people don't realize,

1174
01:09:38.401 --> 01:09:43.401
but the payoffs amazing because it's pretty large and some of the best meat

1175
01:09:43.681 --> 01:09:47.550
around.
I really,
I keep coming back to no is the best.

1176
01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:51.110
<v 2>Yeah,
it's very,
very delicious.
You know,
it's,
it's enormous animal.</v>

1177
01:09:51.111 --> 01:09:52.670
Like what's the biggest elk you've ever shot?

1178
01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:54.220
<v 1>Bodywise bodywash.</v>

1179
01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:59.340
Oh this year on me and my brother drew tags on southwest of fog neck island up

1180
01:09:59.921 --> 01:10:04.750
in Alaska and we shot these elk.
They mine,
no joke.

1181
01:10:05.230 --> 01:10:08.200
Probably weighed 1400 pounds.
Hold.
It was this,

1182
01:10:08.201 --> 01:10:12.190
now this is for people like most [inaudible] are about 400 pounds,

1183
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:17.290
like rocky mountain l average,
you know,
younger bull.
I think the,

1184
01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:18.161
what was it?

1185
01:10:18.161 --> 01:10:22.090
Wyoming did a study and it's around their 400 and something pounds is the

1186
01:10:22.091 --> 01:10:23.440
average elk.
Wait,

1187
01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:28.420
this was a very large animal and the fishing game department in Alaska sends out

1188
01:10:28.421 --> 01:10:31.870
a thing saying these elk are about the size of Moose.
And yes,

1189
01:10:31.871 --> 01:10:36.640
this elk was as big.
We're bigger than any moose I've ever packed out,

1190
01:10:36.641 --> 01:10:38.500
taken apart.
It was,

1191
01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:43.240
it was a brutal experience to say the least.
Carry it.

1192
01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:48.070
Oh yeah.
We had to pack this thing.
It was crazy.
Weak,
lower back.

1193
01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:51.460
Just start throwing.
Me and my brother,
we both shot,
we both shot bulls.

1194
01:10:51.461 --> 01:10:54.970
Mine was quite a bit larger body wise and my brothers,
but

1195
01:10:56.470 --> 01:11:00.070
eight days of just straight toil,
hundred plus pound packs,

1196
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:01.680
eight days of just caring.

1197
01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:06.250
We filmed a documentary style show on this.

1198
01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:09.490
Oh it's not anything yet,
but we did.

1199
01:11:09.970 --> 01:11:11.410
We recorded all our,

1200
01:11:11.670 --> 01:11:16.670
our trip meaning in a documentary fashion and recorded on his gps are elevation

1201
01:11:18.930 --> 01:11:20.280
because we camped on this one,

1202
01:11:20.281 --> 01:11:23.760
like can we had to climb up this big mountain down the next one and we shot

1203
01:11:23.761 --> 01:11:26.460
these elk a ways away and it was,

1204
01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:31.720
I hate pulling,
I'm so bad with numbers.
I always remember Mr Representatives,

1205
01:11:31.721 --> 01:11:32.580
I'm trying to think here,

1206
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:37.090
but it was something like 60 man hours of packing between the two of us,
30 hour,

1207
01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:41.400
you know,
30 hours of just straight carrying.
Holy Fuck.
It was,

1208
01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:42.390
it was.

1209
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:47.390
I got and I got really sick on that trip and I think it might have been

1210
01:11:47.911 --> 01:11:52.911
partially due to just being physically done,

1211
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:57.310
just Roy destroyed it was,

1212
01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.550
it was one of the most physical trips I've ever had.

1213
01:11:59.551 --> 01:12:02.280
But it was probably one of the best trips I've ever had.
And we came back with

1214
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:09.630
600 pounds of boned out,
meet a hand,
get this,

1215
01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:13.950
uh,
we,
we put the meat up in a tree because we had to do cashes.

1216
01:12:13.951 --> 01:12:16.110
I mean this is a multiple day or deal.

1217
01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:20.280
So we're doing these caches and this island has some of the largest brown bears

1218
01:12:20.281 --> 01:12:25.281
in the world and we got them up in this one spruce trees high as we could get,

1219
01:12:25.381 --> 01:12:27.000
um,
probably 14,

1220
01:12:27.001 --> 01:12:32.001
15 feet up and two of the hindquarters in our cash got eaten by bears by a bear.

1221
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:39.060
And they say these bears don't climb trees.
I don't necessarily believe that.

1222
01:12:39.061 --> 01:12:42.700
I think that they can get up a tree in some fashion because I don't think it was

1223
01:12:42.701 --> 01:12:45.420
a 16.
I know it wouldn't have been a 16 foot bear,

1224
01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.480
but somehow this bear got the meat out of this cash.

1225
01:12:49.230 --> 01:12:54.230
And so we came back with 600 pounds of meat minus two hindquarters.

1226
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:58.310
Oh Shit.
Sane and the hindquarters or burned out or no?
Yeah,
boned out.

1227
01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:01.260
No bones and just meet.
Wow.
A hundred percent meat.

1228
01:13:01.530 --> 01:13:03.200
We took a picture where we got the plane,

1229
01:13:03.210 --> 01:13:07.470
we had to take two plane trips to get the meat out.
Just stacks of meat.

1230
01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:11.100
So how far were you traveling?
Like as the crow flaws?

1231
01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:15.090
I love saying by as the crow flies,

1232
01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:18.780
five miles as the crow flies,
but you're going up and down.

1233
01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:20.760
So quite a bit more than that.
From camp.

1234
01:13:20.761 --> 01:13:24.180
The summit was 2,500 feet from our camp vertical up.

1235
01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:27.150
So it's 5,000 each.

1236
01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:33.060
5,000 some of in one in my brothers we had to go even over two ranges like that.

1237
01:13:34.351 --> 01:13:35.790
So just to get one trip back,

1238
01:13:35.791 --> 01:13:40.680
it was 10,000 vert fuck just we documented the whole thing cause it was just

1239
01:13:40.681 --> 01:13:41.514
ridiculous.

1240
01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:45.870
And so I got sick and I don't know if it was from drinking water,

1241
01:13:45.871 --> 01:13:48.870
but sometimes the gestation period of a lot of things you pick up.

1242
01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:52.080
I did drink out of one stream that my brother didn't and it might have been

1243
01:13:52.081 --> 01:13:54.660
below an elk wallow.
Anyways,

1244
01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:59.720
I get sick and it happens to be this night that we had an insane walked back.

1245
01:13:59.791 --> 01:14:03.990
We got back,
I think there's one in the morning and we could have bivy out,

1246
01:14:03.991 --> 01:14:08.370
but the thought was we set up a base camp and if you Bibi out,

1247
01:14:08.371 --> 01:14:11.320
you carry your camp on your back but then you still have to get all the meat

1248
01:14:11.321 --> 01:14:12.154
back.
And it was

1249
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:17.250
<v 0>in our minds easier to just do extra effort if we had to come out light and then</v>

1250
01:14:17.771 --> 01:14:21.490
we would have room to carry meat so we wouldn't have to carry our gear and other

1251
01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:25.510
things.
And with the bears as well,
I mean these bears are everywhere.

1252
01:14:25.511 --> 01:14:29.020
So we have a electric bear fence around our base camp.
Whoa.

1253
01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:34.140
And the night we come back and I just got super sick as gale force winds,

1254
01:14:35.201 --> 01:14:39.190
70 mile an hour winds.
And,
um,
and you're just trying not,

1255
01:14:39.210 --> 01:14:43.300
you're trying to hold throwing up the coming out both ends essentially.

1256
01:14:43.301 --> 01:14:46.390
And so worst time ever.

1257
01:14:46.570 --> 01:14:48.570
So you probably had giardia or stuff like that.

1258
01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:53.410
I don't think it was just something maybe kind of food boy something,

1259
01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:57.670
but it had to have been bacterial in some way because uh,

1260
01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:00.550
I had one of those,
z is the z pack,

1261
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:05.800
three antibiotic things and I just so happen to throw it in.
I normally do,

1262
01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:10.420
but it was a lucky deal cause I took it out of my carry on through it and thing

1263
01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:11.250
and I've,

1264
01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:16.250
it's been in my kit forever and I've never had to use it and that helped.

1265
01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:21.160
I don't know how I would've done it because I was able to still take that and

1266
01:15:21.161 --> 01:15:24.880
kind of kill off whatever was going on and then finish your packing out or,

1267
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:30.990
so you're talking about 30 plus hours of just packing lead and carrying it?

1268
01:15:31.621 --> 01:15:36.290
Yeah.
And each pack you're more than a hundred pounds right on your back.
Yeah.

1269
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:39.400
Yeah,
man,
I was,
my brother's,

1270
01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:42.280
my brother's in really good shape and he's a bigger guy than me.

1271
01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:46.720
So carrying the same amount of weight for me,
and this is my little brother,

1272
01:15:46.721 --> 01:15:49.990
I can't,
he can't carry more weight than me.
Uh,

1273
01:15:50.410 --> 01:15:53.170
I hope he doesn't listen to this because I was hurting.
I didn't have to know it,

1274
01:15:53.171 --> 01:15:56.170
but I was
still hurt from it.

1275
01:15:56.350 --> 01:16:00.310
It's like a competition to see who breaks for exactly.

1276
01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:04.540
Who could deal with the hardship better.
Exactly.
And he's a,
I mean,
if I'm in,

1277
01:16:04.570 --> 01:16:06.940
if I'm ever in a wilderness hard situation,

1278
01:16:06.941 --> 01:16:10.600
like that's the guy I want in my corner.
He's just an awesome dude.
And,
and,

1279
01:16:10.601 --> 01:16:14.400
and because of it,
it ended up being one of the coolest trips ever.

1280
01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:16.720
And while we're hiking,
the thing we do,

1281
01:16:16.930 --> 01:16:19.000
you're just like walking and working hard.

1282
01:16:19.001 --> 01:16:21.930
And all we do is talk about how few calories where we,

1283
01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:26.340
we memorize the amount of calories and every mountain house that was our thing

1284
01:16:26.341 --> 01:16:29.350
is mountain house.
Those meals.
It's freeze dried meals,
meals,

1285
01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:32.920
and when you're over exerting and just eating freeze dried meals,

1286
01:16:33.190 --> 01:16:36.640
nothing is better than some fresh elk stake over the fire.

1287
01:16:36.730 --> 01:16:39.460
I was hanging out with this photographer when we went moose hunting.

1288
01:16:39.510 --> 01:16:41.570
This guys say I'm,
and he was talking about um,

1289
01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:46.510
this trip that he had went on where they had not brought enough food and

1290
01:16:46.570 --> 01:16:49.480
everyone on the trip had lost like 30 pounds,

1291
01:16:49.481 --> 01:16:51.610
20 pounds to lose so much weight.

1292
01:16:51.611 --> 01:16:56.080
So when I first started guiding every year I would loose 20th,
30 pounds.

1293
01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:58.900
Wow.
There's starving.
You're starving.
Yeah.

1294
01:16:58.930 --> 01:17:01.210
It's essentially starvation essentially.
Yeah.

1295
01:17:01.690 --> 01:17:05.590
You force your body to keep going and it starts eating off fat and muscle and it

1296
01:17:05.591 --> 01:17:09.830
doesn't take much to do cause you,
you almost to a point

1297
01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:13.550
<v 1>when you're working so hard that you physically can't,</v>

1298
01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:18.860
you just get sick of eating almost you,
they need some better hierarchy.

1299
01:17:18.861 --> 01:17:20.150
You just need to bring sticks of butter

1300
01:17:20.150 --> 01:17:23.660
<v 2>or something like that.
Does actual fat realistically,
Yeah.</v>

1301
01:17:23.661 --> 01:17:26.120
When people say that I can't lose weight,
man,
I can't,
we use way.

1302
01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.720
You're not trying to have you.
You've just test is what you need to do.

1303
01:17:29.721 --> 01:17:31.310
Get one of those Tenzing packs.

1304
01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:34.670
Throw a fucking rock in it like Cameron Hanes does,
and go climb up a mountain.

1305
01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.490
He puts 130 pound rock and his path.

1306
01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.530
It's one of the ways he prepares for elk season.

1307
01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:42.260
He puts a rock in his pack and he hikes up mountains.

1308
01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:46.400
<v 1>I saw he did.
I was on Facebook or something.
Uh,</v>

1309
01:17:46.990 --> 01:17:51.990
he just did the Boston marathon for a guy in his like bodybuilders status to run

1310
01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:54.190
like that is Semyon human really?

1311
01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:57.450
<v 2>That mother fucker works hard.
Oh yeah,
he does it.
He lives it.</v>

1312
01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:59.760
He lifts weights every day,
seven days a week.
I go,

1313
01:17:59.761 --> 01:18:02.100
how many days you work out every day.
Every day.
He never took a day off.

1314
01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:05.760
It doesn't take days off.
He just pushes it and he's always hurt is always sore.

1315
01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:09.420
He's always like aching,
barely can get out of bed,
has to drink coffee,

1316
01:18:09.421 --> 01:18:13.710
take aspirin,
hot shower and then starts running just crazy.
It's just,

1317
01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:18.810
it's just tough.
There's certain people,
man,
they just,

1318
01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:22.080
and a lot of them are hunters like we're known was one of those guys.

1319
01:18:22.081 --> 01:18:26.430
He's just fucking tough.
Just they have this mental toughness,

1320
01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:30.440
the ability to endure discomfort that the average person just doesn't get.

1321
01:18:30.450 --> 01:18:34.740
And I think it's accentuated by this life or death struggle that you,

1322
01:18:34.770 --> 01:18:37.380
you experience on a day to day basis when you're hunting,

1323
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:42.510
you can kind of compartmentalize certain aches and pains and hunger and thirst

1324
01:18:42.511 --> 01:18:43.344
and cold.

1325
01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:47.210
You could just block that shit out and keep going or the average person sorta

1326
01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:48.570
wallows in that stuff.

1327
01:18:49.050 --> 01:18:51.840
<v 1>But you know,
you ha you have to,
you come into this,
this,</v>

1328
01:18:52.110 --> 01:18:55.260
you have to do these certain things where you're tasked with something,

1329
01:18:55.710 --> 01:19:00.390
it's probably a lot harder than the average person thinks you can do,

1330
01:19:00.391 --> 01:19:01.224
but you,

1331
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:06.300
once you've done it once meant it's a lot of this stuff's mental and that's the

1332
01:19:06.301 --> 01:19:11.160
apex predators show that I've been doing comes back to a lot of Shit's just

1333
01:19:11.161 --> 01:19:14.910
mental.
Yeah.
It's so many things.

1334
01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:18.810
<v 2>A lot is mental with almost everything.
Yeah.
With almost like,
you know,</v>

1335
01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:21.360
tattoos here and it was a bad example,

1336
01:19:21.361 --> 01:19:23.520
but everybody says like how bad tattoos hurt.

1337
01:19:23.790 --> 01:19:27.030
I fell asleep and I was getting tattooed.
Like it doesn't hurt.

1338
01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:29.130
I mean it hurts a little,
but it's not her.

1339
01:19:29.131 --> 01:19:31.710
It doesn't hurt like someone kicking you in the head.
It doesn't hurt.

1340
01:19:31.711 --> 01:19:34.290
Like someone trying to choke your fucking neck off.
No,
it doesn't,

1341
01:19:34.291 --> 01:19:37.710
it doesn't hurt.
Like a lot of things hurt.
Like they really hurt.

1342
01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:41.850
That's this is this discomfort and there's a difference between discomfort and

1343
01:19:41.851 --> 01:19:46.110
real pain.
Yeah.
And what you can endure.
Like you,

1344
01:19:46.170 --> 01:19:50.460
a lot of times people start focusing on the discomfort and like it accentuates,

1345
01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:51.533
it starts,

1346
01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:56.600
it becomes like their entire focus becomes this pain instead of doing the task,

1347
01:19:57.421 --> 01:20:00.810
like blocking out whatever discomfort that you have dealing with it and get

1348
01:20:00.811 --> 01:20:01.210
through it right

1349
01:20:01.210 --> 01:20:06.010
<v 1>then going on.
I sometimes that that Alaska trip it while we're doing it,</v>

1350
01:20:06.011 --> 01:20:08.160
we're like,
would you do this again?

1351
01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:11.820
<v 0>No.
And then when it's over where we were so excited,</v>

1352
01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:14.760
we're just wanting to do it again.
And it was because we hurt the whole time.

1353
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:19.040
Like,
when's the last time you just hurt for a week?
Just punished.
You're in.
It's,

1354
01:20:19.330 --> 01:20:24.000
and it's like this cool experience where you push yourself to these limits and

1355
01:20:24.001 --> 01:20:28.290
then you feel awesome afterwards.
Well,
after it's done,
after it's done,

1356
01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:31.920
done the middle of the toilet,
you're like,
Oh God,
this is not fun.
But you get,
Oh,

1357
01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:35.670
you get back to camp that night we flew in a few beers,

1358
01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:39.690
crack open a beer after in the middle of nowhere.
And you go,
Yep,

1359
01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:41.003
let's do this again.

1360
01:20:43.290 --> 01:20:47.760
Rinella has a whole way of describing it that he said he learned from one of his

1361
01:20:47.761 --> 01:20:50.430
buddies is that there's different kinds of fun.

1362
01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:55.200
There's the kind of fun that's fun while you're doing it,
but it's not fun later.

1363
01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:58.770
Right?
And there's a kind of fun that's not fun while you're doing it,

1364
01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:03.840
but afterwards you have amazing fun memories and it's awesome.
It's so weird.

1365
01:21:04.330 --> 01:21:08.310
I,
I,
I noticed and you,
you know,

1366
01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:09.630
I don't know if you've,

1367
01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:12.520
<v 1>here's this yet,
but for me,
you know,</v>

1368
01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:17.800
I've hunted a lot and so I almost like to punish myself in some,

1369
01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.690
I like it to be hard.
I like to be a challenge.

1370
01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:22.580
So I will actually create it to be,

1371
01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:27.260
I just did this hunt in New Zealand where I was hunting these,
these fallow deer.

1372
01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:31.790
And at any given time,
for the first few days I could have shot a deer.
Well,

1373
01:21:32.570 --> 01:21:35.090
if hunt a lot of people don't realize as hunters,

1374
01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:39.980
it's not always the goal to just go shoot something.
It's part of the experience.

1375
01:21:39.981 --> 01:21:40.814
And so for me,

1376
01:21:41.090 --> 01:21:46.090
I just kept passing up animals because the experience wasn't right until the

1377
01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:49.400
last day when I was supposed to leave early.
And I end up,
oh,

1378
01:21:49.401 --> 01:21:51.920
I'm just going to be hunting for two hours and I don't bring any water.

1379
01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:56.360
And I ended up hunting all day and going,
I don't even know how far,

1380
01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:00.830
18 miles maybe.
And I didn't bring any food,
any water,
and I'm hurting.

1381
01:22:00.831 --> 01:22:04.550
And I ended up shooting a deer last light.
And,

1382
01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:08.990
and now is to me is awesome experience.

1383
01:22:08.991 --> 01:22:11.060
It made the trip and made that memory,

1384
01:22:11.070 --> 01:22:16.070
the hardship made the memory and something that I as a hunter that hunters don't

1385
01:22:16.761 --> 01:22:21.761
really maybe understand is like having these antlers around and when the meets

1386
01:22:21.771 --> 01:22:22.604
long gone,

1387
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:26.420
I can look at that and remember the hardship and the journey and the adventure

1388
01:22:26.421 --> 01:22:30.370
and these other things about the experience and the meat was a byproduct.

1389
01:22:30.530 --> 01:22:31.970
But these are the memories that I like.

1390
01:22:31.971 --> 01:22:34.430
You look at that Moose and you think of something completely different than I,

1391
01:22:34.431 --> 01:22:37.640
do you remember how it went down?
You remember,
you know,

1392
01:22:37.641 --> 01:22:42.020
maybe the struggle or carrying the meat back or whatever.

1393
01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:45.720
So I may have a,
a rack in my house that's sitting up on the mantle.

1394
01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.710
And why is that one on the mantle and that one will,

1395
01:22:47.711 --> 01:22:49.160
that one I had to work real hard for.

1396
01:22:49.161 --> 01:22:53.780
So I look at it and I think it reminds me constantly of what I went through.

1397
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:57.500
When you say that the experience wasn't right,
what,
what do you mean by that?

1398
01:22:57.620 --> 01:23:02.300
Like I feel sometimes it just wasn't a challenge.
It was,

1399
01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:05.800
I would have been shooting an animal,
not the,
wasn't there,

1400
01:23:05.801 --> 01:23:09.280
the challenge wasn't there.
It just wasn't the right time.

1401
01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:14.200
I wanted to keep going until it,
until it happened.
I don't know.
It's so weird.

1402
01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:17.920
But for me,
hunting's about the adventure and everything behind it.

1403
01:23:18.430 --> 01:23:22.890
And so as well as obviously getting meat,
but there comes a point where,
you know,

1404
01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:26.590
okay,
if I didn't get a deer this week,
well maybe I'll,
I'll get one next week.

1405
01:23:26.591 --> 01:23:29.410
I'm not going to starve to death.
I've got a freezer with meat.

1406
01:23:30.490 --> 01:23:33.850
But I also want to keep that freezer full.

1407
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:38.680
But so it comes to a point for me where it's about other things as well.

1408
01:23:38.681 --> 01:23:42.010
The experience,
the adventure,
the meat,

1409
01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:47.090
all combining into this.
If it's too easy,
I just don't like it.
That's fast.

1410
01:23:47.091 --> 01:23:50.470
I don't know.
It'll come.
It'll happen.
You know?
For me it happened.

1411
01:23:50.650 --> 01:23:53.080
I started when I was younger.

1412
01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:57.670
I never wanted to stop hunting because I liked the experience of being out there

1413
01:23:57.671 --> 01:24:01.330
so much.
So I would do what a lot of people call trophy hunting.

1414
01:24:01.331 --> 01:24:05.230
And I'm air quoting that because it means something different to me or I would

1415
01:24:05.231 --> 01:24:10.231
look for a bigger deer because I wanted to keep hunting and make it more of a

1416
01:24:10.571 --> 01:24:13.600
challenge for myself.
I see what you're saying.
See what I'm saying.

1417
01:24:13.630 --> 01:24:17.800
<v 2>So instead of like some people they want a bigger deer so they could say,
hey,</v>

1418
01:24:17.801 --> 01:24:22.690
I got a one 90 buck and one 90 inch and look,
it's on.
You know,
and they will,

1419
01:24:22.691 --> 01:24:27.070
they'll measure everything and look at his tines and look how big is for you it

1420
01:24:27.071 --> 01:24:29.260
was just,
it's a more difficult pursuit.

1421
01:24:29.450 --> 01:24:29.960
<v 1>Right.</v>

1422
01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:34.130
Just the dif difficult pursuit where it keeps me in the field longer because if

1423
01:24:34.131 --> 01:24:37.940
I shoot that first,
first deer I see,
I would be the type of guy that goes out.

1424
01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:40.100
If I've got 10 days to hunt on 110 days,

1425
01:24:40.190 --> 01:24:41.630
I don't want to shoot something on the first day.

1426
01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:44.250
Even if I ended up getting something in the last hour,

1427
01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:45.740
the last day that I would have shot the first day,

1428
01:24:45.741 --> 01:24:48.710
I don't want to spend those 10 days out hunting.

1429
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:52.580
<v 2>That's funny.
I'm the opposite.
I'll shoot that fucker in the first minute first.</v>

1430
01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:56.660
I would love to set the account up,
turned around,
look,

1431
01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:01.580
look what I got.
Boom,
cut it up,
start eating it on the spot.

1432
01:25:01.670 --> 01:25:04.310
But I've,
I haven't been hunting as long.
I think when you've been hunting,

1433
01:25:04.311 --> 01:25:05.840
as long as you have also,

1434
01:25:05.841 --> 01:25:10.330
you kind of appreciate what you appreciate after the fact.
Like you,

1435
01:25:10.331 --> 01:25:14.240
you have a real deep understanding of what it means to you.

1436
01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:18.020
Whereas to me it's all pretty new.
Yeah.
I've only been doing it for three,

1437
01:25:18.050 --> 01:25:21.680
not even three years now.
So it's like,
oh,
crazy.
We're shooting a Turkey now.

1438
01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.830
Oh this is cool.
Like,
oh,

1439
01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:27.800
we're going to go shoot this and I want to eat that and it's fun.
I enjoy it.

1440
01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:32.060
I love the Turkey.
I don't know if I'll do that again.
I might,

1441
01:25:32.061 --> 01:25:35.480
I mean it's not that I didn't like it,
but what I didn't like about the Turkey,

1442
01:25:35.481 --> 01:25:37.880
as you work all day and you know,

1443
01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:42.170
several days in a row to get a Turkey and you can only,
it's like a meal,

1444
01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:46.820
a meal for my family.
They couldn't even eat the whole Turkey,
let's like,

1445
01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:48.170
it's not that big,
you know.

1446
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:52.610
<v 1>So in Nevada checker hunting's big and you might Work Yorker chucker what's it's</v>

1447
01:25:52.630 --> 01:25:56.670
a,
it's a partridge.
Ah,
it looks,

1448
01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:58.980
they're from the Middle East.
They aren't native,

1449
01:25:58.981 --> 01:26:01.350
but they be released into the mountain and they're always,

1450
01:26:01.351 --> 01:26:03.950
they live in cliffs and there is a really animal to hunt

1451
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:07.320
<v 0>and you may go out and only shoot one bird and hike.</v>

1452
01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:12.610
My friend put his little track,
my run thing on and we're hiking,

1453
01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:15.650
like we hit back to the truck after Chickering like,
you know,
I'm pretty tired.

1454
01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:20.840
It's like 22 miles because you're walking from sunup to sundown and steep.
But,

1455
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:25.420
and it's like,
well we got one bird between the three of us.
It's just,

1456
01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:30.290
it's where I grew up.
That was the thing to do.
But it's not even lunch.
No,

1457
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:33.680
but it's more,
you're out there,
you're working hard for it.

1458
01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:37.640
So if you get it and when you get,
when you shoot six of them,
then you,

1459
01:26:37.730 --> 01:26:39.890
you really feel like you've accomplished something.
Well,

1460
01:26:39.891 --> 01:26:43.760
how much is one like as far as the amount of meat you get out of one,

1461
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.210
like to quail.
Wow.
Yeah.

1462
01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:52.340
So like six ounces.
Eight ounces maybe.
Yeah.
Maybe not even.

1463
01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:57.130
Not even.
Wow.
Fuck that.
But I know,

1464
01:26:57.410 --> 01:27:00.710
but when it's just the pursuit of it as well.
So you get,

1465
01:27:00.770 --> 01:27:04.430
you get into and then the,
and then the more you fail,

1466
01:27:04.431 --> 01:27:06.320
the the harder you want to try to succeed.

1467
01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:11.360
So the next time you go out you want to go further and harder and try to get,

1468
01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:15.590
shoot better.
I Dunno.
That's interesting.
So it becomes,

1469
01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:20.060
so hunting isn't just about going out and acquiring meat.

1470
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:25.280
Hunting is also about the challenge of the pursuit of the animal being being the

1471
01:27:25.281 --> 01:27:28.430
hunter,
being the Predator out there,

1472
01:27:28.431 --> 01:27:31.040
trying to outsmart or out hunt,

1473
01:27:31.490 --> 01:27:33.800
defy their natural instincts,

1474
01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:37.670
figure out how to avoid the wind blowing in their nose.

1475
01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:41.870
Figuring out how to approach them the right way and to make it even more

1476
01:27:41.871 --> 01:27:42.470
difficult.

1477
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:45.770
Going after the bigger ones that are smarter than I've been alive longer and

1478
01:27:45.771 --> 01:27:49.160
making it a more difficult task and making the appreciation of the

1479
01:27:49.161 --> 01:27:52.880
accomplishment much better.
Yeah,
and the harder something is,

1480
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:54.680
the more skill you need,

1481
01:27:54.681 --> 01:27:58.430
the more you've honed your abilities in the end.

1482
01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:01.910
And I've always said the harder you worked for something better it tastes.

1483
01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:03.920
If you asked me what the best tasting thing is,

1484
01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:07.250
l just because you work hard for elk now,
Himalayan Tar and New Zealand,

1485
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:11.090
I think they're delicious.
It's a goat that lives in the mountains,

1486
01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:14.270
but you work your ass off for it and when you sit down to eat it,

1487
01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:18.560
you appreciate it.
It's just a different feeling.
What does it taste like?

1488
01:28:18.561 --> 01:28:22.260
Because goat,
a lot of people don't like it.
Tastes like venison.
Really.

1489
01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:26.240
It's kind of good.
It's kind of got marbled fat in the meat,
which is different.

1490
01:28:26.241 --> 01:28:29.630
Mountain mountain goods have that as well.
They have a while coat.
Yeah.

1491
01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:33.420
To pull up an image of a Himalayan tar icon there.

1492
01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:38.120
Gorilla grizzly be HR,
I think EHR.
Yes.

1493
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:42.650
Or G H J or either way.
That's a wild looking animal.
Yeah.
Cool.
Yeah.

1494
01:28:42.651 --> 01:28:45.680
That was like a Werewolf Chewbacca or something like that,

1495
01:28:45.681 --> 01:28:48.680
and I like their back looks like a grizzly or a gorilla because they've got

1496
01:28:48.681 --> 01:28:52.940
these silver stripes down the back and then they've got a lion's mane on the

1497
01:28:52.941 --> 01:28:57.380
front and then I look at that thing.
I'm like,
fuck,
what a wild,

1498
01:28:57.950 --> 01:28:59.270
they're probably one of my favorite,

1499
01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:04.440
favorite stat is so strange and that's a very difficult hunt.
Right?
Can Be.

1500
01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:06.720
It depends how you want to do it.
Now it's like for me,

1501
01:29:06.721 --> 01:29:09.510
I want to walk up from the bottom,
but you could take a helicopter to the top.

1502
01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:12.920
We'll do that.
Oh yeah.
In New Zealand.
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.

1503
01:29:13.410 --> 01:29:15.020
Look at that fucking face.

1504
01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:20.040
That looks like a baboon's or something crazy wild looking half lion and they

1505
01:29:21.181 --> 01:29:24.480
have a red meat.
That's just like venison.
Yeah.
Wow.

1506
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:28.170
Now some people,
they fly up on a helicopter,

1507
01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:29.880
they shoot these things and then they what?

1508
01:29:29.881 --> 01:29:34.650
Fly back down now like what are the elevations you're climbing when you're

1509
01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:35.640
dealing with these things?

1510
01:29:38.220 --> 01:29:40.620
Four thousand five thousand feet maybe.
Wow.

1511
01:29:41.110 --> 01:29:44.650
<v 1>It depends where you're at.
Three to five,
three to six.</v>

1512
01:29:44.810 --> 01:29:48.560
<v 0>And it's all weird,
rocky,
slippery terrain.</v>

1513
01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:50.060
Very precarious.

1514
01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:53.960
I watched one of your episodes of solo hunter when you went after these things.

1515
01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:57.620
Oh yeah.
Was it,
when did I get one or did I fail one?
You didn't get one.

1516
01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:01.130
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
You Go,
I mean,
just the,

1517
01:30:01.131 --> 01:30:04.340
the adventure and getting up there is half the fun in the first place.

1518
01:30:04.490 --> 01:30:05.570
What the fuck is that pounding?

1519
01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:10.460
Is that next door doing demo demo where you're building a robot?

1520
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:14.600
Um,
yeah.
It seems like those,
um,
those,

1521
01:30:14.990 --> 01:30:18.800
those trips are very strange too because you were staying in one of those weird

1522
01:30:18.801 --> 01:30:21.870
cabins that they have set up there for people that can just,

1523
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:23.720
they can just use them anytime they want.

1524
01:30:23.721 --> 01:30:27.430
They can go up there and hang out in those cabins.
Hopefully cuts.
Yeah.

1525
01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:30.740
That's pretty cool.
Is it that many people that go hunting up there?
They have,

1526
01:30:30.741 --> 01:30:31.510
those things are there for,

1527
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:33.560
<v 1>oh,
they're here.
Not An earring.
A lot of it's,</v>

1528
01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:36.920
most of the ones I stand her for ice climbing because I liked hunting around the

1529
01:30:36.921 --> 01:30:40.460
glaciers.
So they're all,
uh,
ice climber huts.

1530
01:30:40.670 --> 01:30:43.430
Like are you based out of before you go really nice climbing.

1531
01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:47.330
Well that's a really popular pursuit around there.
No,

1532
01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:51.320
but there's so much so that they have huts.
Yeah,
because,
well yeah,

1533
01:30:51.321 --> 01:30:54.350
because it's tough terrain and if that's your sport,

1534
01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:56.120
these groups like build these huts.

1535
01:30:56.420 --> 01:30:58.430
There's historical significance to some of them too.

1536
01:30:58.431 --> 01:31:03.431
They're put in for cooling expeditions back when animals are running rampant

1537
01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:06.890
there because they're all non natives.
Is it completely talking about,

1538
01:31:07.250 --> 01:31:09.650
I like to talk about New Zealand because it's a place that I've,

1539
01:31:09.710 --> 01:31:12.710
I've come to love for a lot of reasons,

1540
01:31:12.711 --> 01:31:14.960
but when you talk about conservation,

1541
01:31:14.961 --> 01:31:18.050
there is completely different than we think of it here.
It's almost a,

1542
01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:22.280
it's a different world and it's really hard to explain to people that don't

1543
01:31:22.281 --> 01:31:26.150
understand it because the animals aren't technically supposed to be there,

1544
01:31:26.151 --> 01:31:28.880
but we want them there and they can't get rid of them.

1545
01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:33.800
So there's a completely different system in place there.

1546
01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:38.300
They don't have any tags.
You don't have to have a license,
you just go.
Not yet.

1547
01:31:38.330 --> 01:31:40.970
Well,
you have to have this thing you get online for free,

1548
01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:45.620
but things might change.
Who knows it as it is right now.

1549
01:31:46.130 --> 01:31:50.130
Yeah.
You just open.
Is there a some movement to try to change it and regulated?

1550
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:55.550
I think it looks like there might be not necessarily just not that they want

1551
01:31:55.700 --> 01:32:00.070
less animal shot because a lot of people there would want them all gone if they

1552
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:03.400
<v 0>could.
I mean they poison animals.
The government shoots him out of helicopters.</v>

1553
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.960
Yeah,
they have to.
Cause there's so many no predators and no one,

1554
01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:11.710
no knuckle heads want to bring wolves over there.
Anything,
uh,
back in,

1555
01:32:12.370 --> 01:32:15.760
back during,
I think it was World War II,
they'd proposed to bring mountain lions.

1556
01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:21.940
Well,
it's the,
it's the woman who swallowed a fly problem like swallow and why?

1557
01:32:21.941 --> 01:32:25.150
So I'm going to swallow a frog.
What they,
what they found out is,

1558
01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:29.830
so they bring in rabbits and then they bring in ferrets to kill the rabbits and

1559
01:32:29.831 --> 01:32:32.170
weasels.
And then they find out that the Robinson,

1560
01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:36.160
the ferrets are in killing these endangered flightless birds because they're

1561
01:32:36.161 --> 01:32:37.960
like,
he's here to kill.
And her were having,

1562
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:43.300
and so the non natives eat the native plants and kill off the native wildlife.

1563
01:32:43.330 --> 01:32:45.850
Did you find that,
did you read that study?

1564
01:32:45.850 --> 01:32:50.850
They did recently on deer and deer eating birds now and that it's incredibly

1565
01:32:51.191 --> 01:32:56.140
common for deer to eat birds and that not only will deer eat birds,

1566
01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.780
they'll find nesting birds and they'll eat them.

1567
01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:03.640
They'll find ground nesting birds,
delete chicks.
But they also found,
they did,

1568
01:33:03.670 --> 01:33:08.650
they had these birds that were caught in a net and much to their surprise,

1569
01:33:08.651 --> 01:33:12.040
mature deer were walking up to these birds that were caught in the net and just

1570
01:33:12.041 --> 01:33:16.980
eating him alive.
And that birds apparently are on the,
on the menu for deer.

1571
01:33:16.990 --> 01:33:21.030
Deer.
Yeah.
That's interesting.
No one knew,
but this is really,

1572
01:33:21.031 --> 01:33:24.050
really recent discovery.
Oh,

1573
01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:27.460
I wonder if w where's there more Buchser dose or do they even know?
Just,

1574
01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:30.680
I don't know,
Jamie Cvo pull up that article.
The,

1575
01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:34.000
because all you got it already dear.
I've been eating birds for years.

1576
01:33:34.030 --> 01:33:38.440
They do need a lower protein,
especially the females need it when they're

1577
01:33:40.130 --> 01:33:40.963
<v 4>uh,</v>

1578
01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:44.880
<v 0>pregnant,
and then the males need it.
When they're growing their handlers,
they,</v>

1579
01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:47.620
they pick out higher protein grass and other things.

1580
01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:49.620
It makes sense that if they eat a bird,

1581
01:33:49.621 --> 01:33:51.490
then they get a little bit more protein in their diet.

1582
01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:56.040
<v 2>They're eating the heads and legs of live seabird chicks as a way to get</v>

1583
01:33:56.041 --> 01:33:57.780
minerals they need to grow their antlers.

1584
01:33:57.781 --> 01:34:01.350
Scientists believe that surprising addition to the red deer's diets stems from

1585
01:34:01.710 --> 01:34:04.710
mineral deficiencies and the vegetation they eat.
Wow.

1586
01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:07.860
There's a bunch of different versions of this that they've,
uh,

1587
01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:12.060
there's more than one study that they've sort of a,
this is from 2003.

1588
01:34:12.061 --> 01:34:16.520
This is not the one.
There's one firm much more recent.
That's pretty crazy.
Yeah.

1589
01:34:17.490 --> 01:34:18.930
Field cameras.
Yeah.

1590
01:34:20.090 --> 01:34:20.490
<v 4>Huh?</v>

1591
01:34:20.490 --> 01:34:23.980
<v 2>Yeah.
This is,
this is the most recent one.
This is the North American one.</v>

1592
01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:25.540
It's crazy.
In North Dakota,

1593
01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:30.610
they set up nest cams over a ness of songbirds expected to see.

1594
01:34:30.611 --> 01:34:33.400
So a lot of the nestlings and eggs getting eaten by ground squirrels,

1595
01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:34.480
foxes and badgers.

1596
01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:39.340
Squirrels hit 13 nasty other meat eaters made a poor showing foxes and weasels

1597
01:34:39.341 --> 01:34:40.810
only took one nest each.

1598
01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:44.860
You know what fearsome animal out did either of those two sleek,

1599
01:34:44.861 --> 01:34:47.290
resourceful predators.
White tail deer,

1600
01:34:48.370 --> 01:34:51.820
the eight living nestlings right out of the nests and if you're thinking that

1601
01:34:51.821 --> 01:34:54.970
must be a mistake that the deer were chewing the way through.

1602
01:34:54.971 --> 01:34:58.550
Some vegetation happened upon a mouthful.
Bird think again.
Up in Canada,

1603
01:34:58.610 --> 01:35:02.000
a group of Ortho knowledgist.
It's nice money on a theologist.

1604
01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:05.060
We're studying adult birds in order to examine them closely.

1605
01:35:05.061 --> 01:35:06.680
Researchers used mist nets.

1606
01:35:06.681 --> 01:35:11.681
These nets usually draped between trees are designed to trap birds or bats

1607
01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:15.050
gently so that they can be collected,
studied and released.

1608
01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:16.580
When a herd of deer came by,

1609
01:35:16.581 --> 01:35:20.360
the deer walked up to the struggling birds and ate them alive right out of the

1610
01:35:20.361 --> 01:35:25.310
nets.
Crazy.
Oh,
that's cool.
It is wild,

1611
01:35:25.311 --> 01:35:29.960
man.
It is wild,
Huh?
A cow.

1612
01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:34.100
They found a cow eating a recently hatch chick.
Wow.

1613
01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:37.010
Herbivores eat meat when they're not getting enough nutrients in their diet.

1614
01:35:37.190 --> 01:35:40.370
That's interesting.
It is.
No,

1615
01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:42.320
it is really fascinating.

1616
01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:45.690
<v 1>I wonder I,
it's amazing.</v>

1617
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:48.480
I wonder what other animals do things that we don't even know about.

1618
01:35:48.630 --> 01:35:50.430
You just happened upon it accidentally.

1619
01:35:50.630 --> 01:35:54.020
<v 2>I'm sure there's a lot.
Yeah,
I'm sure you know,</v>

1620
01:35:54.021 --> 01:35:57.470
I mean it's one of the things that they've found over the last,
uh,

1621
01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:02.090
I don't know how many years is how many bears eat baby bears and that it's not

1622
01:36:02.091 --> 01:36:06.680
just a matter of like trying to keep their blood line or trying to discourage up

1623
01:36:06.681 --> 01:36:11.300
and coming males,
they just eat babies.
Like that's just their Fein source.

1624
01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:15.170
Like when they get out of the high or the,
um,
when the,
the den,

1625
01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:19.730
when they're done hibernating,
they like immediately seek out cubs.

1626
01:36:19.930 --> 01:36:21.290
That's like one of their favorite things to eat.

1627
01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:22.640
<v 1>I've heard that.
I wonder,</v>

1628
01:36:23.690 --> 01:36:27.070
I've heard also heard that they do that for breeding reasons as well because in

1629
01:36:27.071 --> 01:36:28.760
the female was cycle again,

1630
01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:33.770
<v 2>right?
Yeah.
There's all sorts of speculation about that.
But we,</v>

1631
01:36:33.771 --> 01:36:37.580
uh,
when we were in a Alberta last year,
one of the guys we were with,

1632
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:42.650
they had seen a female eat its own baby.
Wow.
It's really fucked.

1633
01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:45.800
The male had killed it and then the female finished it off.

1634
01:36:46.670 --> 01:36:50.440
The mail came in and tried to attack the female and tact or cop.

1635
01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:54.050
Her cops started eating her calm.
She chased him off and then she finished it.

1636
01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:58.760
Hmm.
Yeah.
That's my snack.
That's harsh.

1637
01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:02.240
That's fucking harsh,
man.
Mom,
why are you eating me?

1638
01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:05.240
It's not a me anymore dead.

1639
01:37:06.610 --> 01:37:09.720
It's a harsh fucking world.
The world of

1640
01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:13.090
<v 1>doing the,
the APEC spreaders show,</v>

1641
01:37:13.091 --> 01:37:17.830
one of the things that really kind of was surprised cause we,
you know,

1642
01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:21.910
start out doing a TV thing and you have these ideas of what should happen and

1643
01:37:21.911 --> 01:37:26.290
that never fricking happens ever.
Things always go wrong or,

1644
01:37:26.590 --> 01:37:27.340
or something.

1645
01:37:27.340 --> 01:37:31.390
But that's why I wanted to take and look at it as a learning experience.

1646
01:37:31.391 --> 01:37:35.050
Not necessarily come out with these pre I preconceived ideas of what's going to

1647
01:37:35.051 --> 01:37:38.380
happen.
I just want to act as this animal in the wild,

1648
01:37:38.381 --> 01:37:41.860
learn from it and then see what its life would be like.

1649
01:37:42.490 --> 01:37:45.850
And one of the things that I've come to the conclusion of is a lot of these

1650
01:37:45.851 --> 01:37:50.560
animals that we see as being super efficient and uh,

1651
01:37:50.830 --> 01:37:54.640
they've easily surviving.
It's a hard knock life for them.

1652
01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:59.520
It's not as easy.
A lot of animals scrounge and are hunting all day,

1653
01:37:59.521 --> 01:38:03.510
every day into the night just to get enough food to sustain themselves.

1654
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:05.790
And then there's other animals that it is easier.

1655
01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:11.130
But for the most part I've learned that these animals that hunt daily,

1656
01:38:11.490 --> 01:38:13.440
it's not as easy as you might think.

1657
01:38:13.441 --> 01:38:16.860
You always see the highlight reel of the lion catching the gazelle,

1658
01:38:17.190 --> 01:38:21.090
but it's pretty hard even for the lion to catch the gazelle.

1659
01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:24.870
It's a,
it's a pretty interesting thought.

1660
01:38:24.871 --> 01:38:28.860
And then we go out as humans and it's a lot essentially,

1661
01:38:28.890 --> 01:38:32.010
it's a lot easier for us to hunt and catch things than it is for these.

1662
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:36.480
These natural predators are animals.
Well,
I can imagine we have guns.
Yeah,

1663
01:38:36.690 --> 01:38:39.150
exactly.
Well that's the archery thing too,
right?

1664
01:38:39.151 --> 01:38:41.430
That's one of the reasons why people enjoy archery.

1665
01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:43.710
It's cause it is a much more difficult challenge.

1666
01:38:43.711 --> 01:38:45.960
You have to figure out how to get between,
you know,

1667
01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:51.440
20 and 50 yards proximity and yeah,

1668
01:38:51.511 --> 01:38:53.720
the,
the Cha,
it's,

1669
01:38:53.730 --> 01:38:57.280
it just goes back to that challenge of what makes it hard and,

1670
01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:59.850
and why you do what.
I mean there's people that only bow hunt.

1671
01:38:59.851 --> 01:39:02.250
There's people that bow hunt and rifle hunt.

1672
01:39:02.610 --> 01:39:07.610
There's people that don't traditional bow hunt and it's all based on the

1673
01:39:09.331 --> 01:39:14.331
challenge and the experience for them as well as a lot of ideals as far as,

1674
01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:19.170
okay,
well I'm a bow hunter and if you shoot with a gun that's too easy for me.

1675
01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:23.640
But for me I,
I do whatever kind of hunting because I just love hunting.
Yeah.

1676
01:39:23.641 --> 01:39:24.570
There's a lot of people that have,

1677
01:39:24.571 --> 01:39:28.050
there's like a purity involved in like shooting something with a bow because

1678
01:39:28.051 --> 01:39:31.100
it's much more difficult than shooting something with a rifle.
See and I'm,

1679
01:39:31.150 --> 01:39:34.710
I'm cool with that,
but I sometimes for me it's,
there's hunter,

1680
01:39:34.770 --> 01:39:36.420
I don't like when hunters are against hunter.

1681
01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:41.280
If you're a hunter cause your shoot it with a rifle and then we'll the

1682
01:39:41.670 --> 01:39:44.550
traditional dudes like you aren't a hunter because you shoot it with a compound

1683
01:39:44.551 --> 01:39:47.540
bow and there's a guy out,
there were no shoes going.

1684
01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:50.970
You guys need to grab them with your hands and there are some other games like

1685
01:39:50.971 --> 01:39:55.050
you got to catch him with your teeth.
Can't we all just get along?

1686
01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:58.930
Yeah.
It's already a much aligned community.

1687
01:39:59.490 --> 01:40:03.540
I ran into uh,
Jim Shockey at this thing and,

1688
01:40:03.550 --> 01:40:05.310
and he's always been a hero of mine.

1689
01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:09.090
I was talking to him about because he came on your podcast and I listened to

1690
01:40:09.091 --> 01:40:12.630
that and I thought that was an awesome,
awesome podcasts.

1691
01:40:12.631 --> 01:40:16.400
The guy so well spoken and I love that day you can talk about anything and

1692
01:40:16.401 --> 01:40:20.520
you're just like,
oh wow.
It makes sense to me now.
But yeah,
I,

1693
01:40:20.850 --> 01:40:23.610
I was kind of talking to them about a few things and it's,

1694
01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:27.030
and it's in fewer words,

1695
01:40:27.031 --> 01:40:30.930
you just don't fuck it up,
you know,
like don't be against hunters.

1696
01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:32.070
And then in a thought.
Yeah,

1697
01:40:32.071 --> 01:40:36.140
I mean that makes sense because really it's all hunting.

1698
01:40:36.370 --> 01:40:41.250
We've all got the same desire to go out and harvest our meat and hunt and be out

1699
01:40:41.251 --> 01:40:42.084
in the wild.

1700
01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:45.360
What's it matter if you're doing it with a bow or on public land or private land

1701
01:40:45.361 --> 01:40:47.940
or with a spear?
With a gun.

1702
01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:51.030
I mean it's all the end result's the same as the dead animal.

1703
01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:54.130
Well he tried to make it more difficult for himself to make

1704
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:58.830
<v 2>the challenge.
So his challenge is used as muzzleloaders right?
All the time.
Yeah.</v>

1705
01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:02.380
Even in regular rifle sees and uses a muzzle loader cause he only gets one shot.

1706
01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:05.080
<v 1>Exactly.
And that that's for me it may,</v>

1707
01:41:05.081 --> 01:41:09.310
if I'm hunting with a rifle then I may try to find something that's bigger or

1708
01:41:09.670 --> 01:41:14.670
packing to an area that's further or who knows what I do just to make it more of

1709
01:41:15.641 --> 01:41:15.890
a chat.

1710
01:41:15.890 --> 01:41:18.790
And then there's some times where obviously the only intention is I'm looking

1711
01:41:18.791 --> 01:41:22.540
for meat and I need that meat now.
But for the most part,

1712
01:41:22.541 --> 01:41:26.500
yeah you either way,
you're still out there hunting.

1713
01:41:27.070 --> 01:41:29.890
<v 2>What brings me back to your buffalo show.</v>

1714
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:34.330
Cause the buffalo show was a particularly trying one for you because you snuck

1715
01:41:34.331 --> 01:41:39.190
up on this buffalo,
you got it.
It was a good shot with your bow.

1716
01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:42.970
But the buffalo was still alive.
They're so fucking tough and they're so big

1717
01:41:43.090 --> 01:41:47.470
<v 1>and you know,
there's a lot of things that I would have done different,</v>

1718
01:41:47.471 --> 01:41:51.590
but also I couldn't have done different in them.
Sometimes you,

1719
01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:56.140
you have to do what happens in that moment and make a decision.
And for me,

1720
01:41:56.141 --> 01:41:59.170
I didn't want to shoot a buffalo bedded down,
bison bedded down.

1721
01:41:59.171 --> 01:42:02.860
But some things went wrong during the filming of the camera.

1722
01:42:02.861 --> 01:42:06.430
Guy was in the wrong place.
And if that Bison got up and started walking off,

1723
01:42:06.431 --> 01:42:08.860
we wouldn't be able to film it.
And,
and so I,

1724
01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:13.210
I made the decision to shoot it with my bow in that particular instance.

1725
01:42:13.211 --> 01:42:15.880
And I had to live with that decision and yeah,

1726
01:42:15.881 --> 01:42:19.300
I shot it where it would have been good,
but it just,

1727
01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:23.050
the boat didn't penetrate hard enough and it was nothing.
I mean,

1728
01:42:23.051 --> 01:42:25.300
the equipment was all right,
everything was right.

1729
01:42:25.301 --> 01:42:30.250
It was just one of those deals where a quarter inch left or right and maybe

1730
01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:33.730
would have made a difference.
It hit the shoulder and just,
yeah,

1731
01:42:33.731 --> 01:42:36.760
the next day it was still alive.
And for me,

1732
01:42:37.090 --> 01:42:39.910
I mean there's guys that could maybe watch that episode and go,

1733
01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:43.180
well your bow hunting and you shot it in the end with if you haven't seen him

1734
01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:45.580
given away a spoiler alert.
But yeah,

1735
01:42:45.581 --> 01:42:49.780
and I ended up shooting it with a rifle the next day.
And for me it,

1736
01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:54.430
it wasn't about bow hunting or rifle hunting or being a purist in this former or

1737
01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:55.780
following through because of the,

1738
01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:59.890
the natives who did that tactic would have only used primitive weaponry or order

1739
01:43:00.010 --> 01:43:04.750
for me in that moment is about putting that bison down and you know,
it's,

1740
01:43:05.290 --> 01:43:08.710
as hunters,
we don't want to see an animal suffer this,
that,
or the other thing.

1741
01:43:08.890 --> 01:43:11.620
So it didn't really matter what I shot it with in the end,

1742
01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:15.580
I just wanted to do my job to,
to make things right.

1743
01:43:15.630 --> 01:43:17.750
<v 2>Right.
That had to be a hard feeling to,</v>

1744
01:43:17.751 --> 01:43:20.550
to know that this animal's wounded and you have to go to sleep.

1745
01:43:21.630 --> 01:43:24.540
<v 1>I didn't even sleep that night and there it was raining.
We,</v>

1746
01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:26.400
I think we got back to the tents at

1747
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:32.160
one 30 in the morning.
Later it had been just dumping rain.

1748
01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:35.910
We lost the blood trail and it just,
you know,
we're just an,

1749
01:43:35.911 --> 01:43:38.640
I also didn't want to keep pushing it because at some point you think,
okay,

1750
01:43:38.641 --> 01:43:40.620
well you,
it's not smart to track at night.

1751
01:43:40.621 --> 01:43:44.700
The only reason we were tracking it at night was because the rain was coming and

1752
01:43:44.701 --> 01:43:45.534
then it just,

1753
01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:49.530
there was good blood and then we lost the blood trail and decided to come back

1754
01:43:49.531 --> 01:43:54.120
the next day.
And,
and luckily things turned out.
But I,

1755
01:43:54.770 --> 01:43:58.040
when I came away from that trip,
there's a lot of things that I was like,

1756
01:43:58.270 --> 01:44:01.340
you know,
but I,
I,
when I do a television show,

1757
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:03.350
I like to make things.

1758
01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:07.880
I don't necessarily need to show people that I'm pounding my chest and be the

1759
01:44:07.881 --> 01:44:09.770
greatest dog,
show my failures as well.

1760
01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:12.260
And not saying that that was a failure or whatever,
but you know,

1761
01:44:12.261 --> 01:44:13.670
even in Solo hunters or other things,

1762
01:44:13.671 --> 01:44:16.070
there's a lot episodes where I don't get anything and there's a lot of hunting

1763
01:44:16.071 --> 01:44:18.680
shows that won't show that.
But for me it's a real,

1764
01:44:18.681 --> 01:44:22.790
it's hunting and I've missed things with my bow and miss things with my rifle,

1765
01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:27.290
I've messed up.
But you know,
I keep doing it and I think,
you know,
if,

1766
01:44:27.291 --> 01:44:30.680
if I just edited things,
how I'm always,
it's always perfect,

1767
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:32.960
then I'm just kind of lying to myself really

1768
01:44:33.050 --> 01:44:36.290
<v 2>there.
I think if there was very few hunting shows out there,</v>

1769
01:44:36.590 --> 01:44:38.120
maybe that would be acceptable.

1770
01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:41.900
I'd like to try to make it like the most exciting version of hunting possible.

1771
01:44:42.230 --> 01:44:45.580
But I think it's really important to portray it for what it really is.
Yeah.

1772
01:44:45.590 --> 01:44:46.111
Would,
it really is,

1773
01:44:46.111 --> 01:44:48.950
is a difficult pursuit even for an expert hundred like yourself.

1774
01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:50.160
It doesn't always work.

1775
01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:52.200
<v 1>No.
Things go wrong and,
and you know,
and then,</v>

1776
01:44:52.590 --> 01:44:55.110
and then it also has the gravity of the situation.
You know,

1777
01:44:55.111 --> 01:45:00.111
we come upon a bison and shoot it with a rifle and the bison drops.

1778
01:45:00.211 --> 01:45:04.140
And uh,
that episode in particular,
um,

1779
01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:07.890
I had quite a few people that weren't hunters at all,

1780
01:45:08.070 --> 01:45:12.540
but it started watching the series and they said that it was like there was no

1781
01:45:12.541 --> 01:45:16.920
warning the bison just died.
And they,
they were like,
I felt sad.

1782
01:45:17.790 --> 01:45:20.550
And I said,
yeah,
that's the point.
Like you go through the,

1783
01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:23.250
you felt the emotions of a hunter.
I don't necessarily feel sad,

1784
01:45:23.251 --> 01:45:25.410
but I talk about it in the end.

1785
01:45:25.411 --> 01:45:30.390
I say that the path of a hunter is a humbling path and it really is like in that

1786
01:45:30.391 --> 01:45:34.410
moment you watch that and go,
boom,
this bison just is now dead.
And you go,
Whoa,

1787
01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:38.300
Whoa,
Eagle.
Right?

1788
01:45:38.310 --> 01:45:42.180
And then there's also the feeling of I'm thankful for this bison and now it's

1789
01:45:42.181 --> 01:45:45.750
providing me with all this meat.
And that is what it is to be a hunter.

1790
01:45:45.810 --> 01:45:49.470
You go through a range of emotions no matter how many times you've done it,
that,

1791
01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:52.830
yeah,
life begets life.
And now,

1792
01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:58.200
now this bison is no longer an animal is a source of meat and I'm going to use

1793
01:45:58.201 --> 01:45:59.400
that throughout the year.

1794
01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:03.860
<v 2>That's the real big difference between someone who's been involved in the taking</v>

1795
01:46:03.861 --> 01:46:04.311
of the life,

1796
01:46:04.311 --> 01:46:07.130
whether you're a farmer and the kills your own cows or whether you're a hunter

1797
01:46:07.370 --> 01:46:09.110
that goes out and hunts the meat.
There's a,

1798
01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:13.070
there's a much deeper understanding of what you're actually eating.
Yeah.

1799
01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:17.060
I don't think it's necessarily healthy that we could just go to a supermarket

1800
01:46:17.061 --> 01:46:20.210
and buy a steak.
I just,
I think it's weird.

1801
01:46:20.211 --> 01:46:23.170
It just gives you a massive disconnect and that's where all the self

1802
01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:25.550
righteousness from people wearing leather,

1803
01:46:26.210 --> 01:46:28.730
eating meat and getting angry at people for hunting.

1804
01:46:28.731 --> 01:46:31.760
That's where it all comes from.
It's like it's,
it's a sickness.
It's like a,

1805
01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:33.260
there's a disconnect,

1806
01:46:33.410 --> 01:46:37.610
like a complete total disconnect from what you're doing by eating a hamburger.

1807
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:39.860
You're how you hired a supermarket,

1808
01:46:39.861 --> 01:46:43.820
hit man to go out there and kill those fucking animals and package it up so you

1809
01:46:43.821 --> 01:46:47.210
can be completely insulated from the life or death struggle.

1810
01:46:47.390 --> 01:46:50.070
And then you're getting at other people,

1811
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:53.490
like the idea of a meat eating person who wears leather.

1812
01:46:53.730 --> 01:46:56.970
Being upset at hunting is one of the great,

1813
01:46:57.300 --> 01:46:59.940
bizarre hypocrisy of our culture.

1814
01:47:00.290 --> 01:47:04.400
<v 1>Yeah.
It doesn't really make sense.
And I,
I can't,
for me,</v>

1815
01:47:04.401 --> 01:47:07.570
I've seen,
you know,

1816
01:47:07.610 --> 01:47:12.110
I have a respect for my food in a different way that someone,
an animal is now,

1817
01:47:12.111 --> 01:47:16.590
food is not an animal.
But for me,
meat is always an animal.
It's always food.
I,

1818
01:47:16.591 --> 01:47:19.850
I respect it in that way.
And when it becomes meat than it,

1819
01:47:20.180 --> 01:47:22.760
it becomes something different to me.
But it's still an animal.

1820
01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:25.550
I think it's kind of a weird story.

1821
01:47:25.551 --> 01:47:29.030
But they had a horse that,
uh,

1822
01:47:29.570 --> 01:47:33.920
we'd use the pack out things and whatever in it and it breaking it to like,
and,

1823
01:47:33.921 --> 01:47:35.990
uh,
we had to shoot it.
Okay.

1824
01:47:36.410 --> 01:47:40.430
And so I didn't want to do it because he is like,

1825
01:47:40.431 --> 01:47:44.570
you have this attachment to this animal.
And then,
uh,

1826
01:47:44.630 --> 01:47:46.130
my other guy didn't want to do it either,

1827
01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:49.070
but one of the guys that hadn't used the horses,
we talked to him.
Okay.

1828
01:47:49.071 --> 01:47:52.640
Like you need to put this horse down.
He shot the horse.

1829
01:47:53.060 --> 01:47:57.880
And I still felt like,
okay,
this is like,
now we have a dental.

1830
01:47:58.190 --> 01:48:02.660
And so I don't know why,
but I cut the back stakes out and ate the horse.

1831
01:48:03.530 --> 01:48:06.260
There's like,
people are going to be like,
that is discussed,
that is sick.

1832
01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:08.870
But for me it was like,
okay,

1833
01:48:09.230 --> 01:48:14.000
well now it serves the utility a purpose.

1834
01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:16.520
It's now food.
It's no longer wasted.

1835
01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:19.170
<v 2>Yeah.
Otherwise you'd be wasting it.
Something's going to eat it.</v>

1836
01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:24.200
Either bacteria is going to eat it or predators or rodents or scavengers.

1837
01:48:24.661 --> 01:48:28.260
Someone's going to eat it.
Yeah.
Why shouldn't you?
And I've had horse before.

1838
01:48:28.261 --> 01:48:31.020
I had it in Montreal.
It was a place called Joe beef.
They,

1839
01:48:31.021 --> 01:48:34.650
I've had horse tar tar or I've had raw horse and I've had a horse,

1840
01:48:34.651 --> 01:48:39.400
a loins with a,
they cooked like the back strap and they cooked.
Uh,
they,

1841
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:43.740
they cooked it up like a steak.
It was delicious.
Yeah.
So really it's been there.

1842
01:48:43.830 --> 01:48:46.950
You know,
in the end it's meat and now in smoke,

1843
01:48:46.951 --> 01:48:51.720
but I mean obviously you like it is pat what?
Oh,
Sicko.

1844
01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:55.020
But yeah,
for me it was more out of a respect thing.
Okay.

1845
01:48:55.530 --> 01:48:56.910
Now it's the circle of life.

1846
01:48:57.030 --> 01:49:01.140
Some people will knock an understand that now it's weird,
but that's okay.

1847
01:49:01.290 --> 01:49:05.280
There's,
you can't help everybody understand things that make sense to me.
It's,

1848
01:49:05.281 --> 01:49:08.700
to me it's makes sense because it's good meat.
It's healthy for you.

1849
01:49:08.850 --> 01:49:10.530
It's very common.
Eaton,
Europe,

1850
01:49:12.150 --> 01:49:13.870
it's one of the weird things is I've,

1851
01:49:14.010 --> 01:49:19.010
I believe a lot of the horse they buy in Canada comes from the United States,

1852
01:49:19.081 --> 01:49:21.510
but we can't sell it in the United States.

1853
01:49:21.790 --> 01:49:24.700
<v 1>Yeah,
I know.
I had an Iceland and those horses are,</v>

1854
01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:27.610
that was the only other time I'd had it.
I couldn't remember.

1855
01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:31.660
Part of the reasons I was like,
you can't actually get horse here.
I might as well

1856
01:49:32.190 --> 01:49:34.190
<v 2>try it.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1857
01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:38.400
We served horse rectum on fear factor once and it was,
yeah,

1858
01:49:38.490 --> 01:49:41.670
people are just so angry.
I believe it was boiled.

1859
01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:46.770
I was very chewy and disgusting,
but people were so angry and it was a horse.

1860
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:48.430
Yeah,
it's a horse

1861
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:51.190
<v 0>to a lot of folks.
It's like if we started serving dog tongue,</v>

1862
01:49:51.590 --> 01:49:56.140
people would be like,
you assholes.
You sort of serving dog town.
That's our pet,

1863
01:49:56.740 --> 01:49:57.940
you know?
So for a lot of people,

1864
01:49:57.941 --> 01:50:01.960
their horses even more intimately involved in their life.
Then a dog,

1865
01:50:01.961 --> 01:50:06.490
because they ride it like that horse worked.
It carried.

1866
01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:11.470
It was like it carried elk for me,
it was on the hunt,
which is kind of a weird,

1867
01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:16.210
I mean maybe it was,
yeah,
it's a weird philosophy.

1868
01:50:16.570 --> 01:50:20.050
I mean it's an animal that you associate with and it's weird,
but I think it's,

1869
01:50:20.230 --> 01:50:23.500
I think what you [inaudible] I was like,
I didn't really know.

1870
01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:25.540
I felt weird about it and then I was like,

1871
01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:29.170
but then when we cooked it up and it became,
it was like,
okay,
yeah,
it's,

1872
01:50:30.330 --> 01:50:33.130
I don't know.
I'm glad I did it.
I don't know if I'd do it again,

1873
01:50:33.131 --> 01:50:35.230
but I thought in that moment it felt right.

1874
01:50:35.380 --> 01:50:39.110
How much of the meat did you take off the horse?
The back strap.
That's it.
Yeah.

1875
01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:43.570
Because,
well,
it was pretty,
yeah,
and I thought,

1876
01:50:43.571 --> 01:50:46.240
well there was other animals out there that we're also going to eat it,

1877
01:50:46.241 --> 01:50:50.380
but it would've been,
it would've been impossible to get an arrest out.

1878
01:50:50.560 --> 01:50:53.430
When you were,
where you were in a bare area where the arrows,
yeah,

1879
01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:58.240
the berries ate it within,
it was gone.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
I went back.
How long?

1880
01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:03.330
I went back like three days later.
It was pretty much toast.
Wow.
Yeah.

1881
01:51:03.490 --> 01:51:07.290
What kind of bears?
Black bears are groups.
Eagles were,

1882
01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:12.070
they eat a lot.
There's just probably when I got there,
I don't,

1883
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:16.990
there was a lot eagles on it.
That's crazy.
Eagles eat a lot.
I'm sure.

1884
01:51:16.991 --> 01:51:21.280
I know how.
Yeah,
there's maybe a combination of animals,
coyotes,
eagles,

1885
01:51:21.790 --> 01:51:26.320
bears.
Amazing how quick nature can eat something like that.

1886
01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:29.260
A horse and it was a horror thousand pounds or something.

1887
01:51:29.261 --> 01:51:34.090
Probably even more big ass animal gets devoured in a few days.

1888
01:51:34.091 --> 01:51:36.350
A few days it's gone.
Yeah.
That's why when people say,

1889
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:39.130
talk about like finding dead animals in the woods,

1890
01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:43.780
like you've rarely you'll find bones.
Yeah.
You know and whole animals.

1891
01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:47.230
Very rarely try finding a dead mountain lion.
Good luck.

1892
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:50.080
And you live your whole life.
Never,
never see a dead mountain.

1893
01:51:50.081 --> 01:51:54.170
While I've only found one really dead one.
Where was it?
In a river.
Ooh,

1894
01:51:54.171 --> 01:51:56.980
it's round.
Yup.
Well I think a high water.

1895
01:51:57.370 --> 01:51:59.020
Either it's trade swimming across or something.

1896
01:51:59.170 --> 01:52:04.170
Have you ever seen that picture of a mountain lion and a mountain goat that

1897
01:52:05.231 --> 01:52:09.430
apparently got into a scrap and they both fell off the mountain onto a highway

1898
01:52:09.910 --> 01:52:12.730
and there was dead?
Was it a sheep or a goat?

1899
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:17.200
Maybe it was a big horn sheep.
Now that I'm thinking about,
I think you're right.

1900
01:52:17.740 --> 01:52:20.740
I did see a picture or something like that.
A whole series of pictures.

1901
01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:23.710
Is there a pictures of him actually fighting like,
oh,
they're dead.

1902
01:52:23.711 --> 01:52:27.860
They're both there they are.
Bam.
They're both dead on the road.
Huh?

1903
01:52:28.180 --> 01:52:32.140
It's a crazy picture.
I think that thing to the left is one of the horns.
Yeah.

1904
01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:33.041
Well what happened?

1905
01:52:33.041 --> 01:52:38.041
Because the w when they fall along with these air pressure blows through and

1906
01:52:38.411 --> 01:52:40.210
pops the horn off.
We're really look at it.

1907
01:52:40.211 --> 01:52:44.560
Look at the top would go up a little bit of blew that horn.
Like where?

1908
01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:45.650
Where it came off

1909
01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:51.160
<v 2>this weird bloody stump with a horn popped off and then it fell off a cliff or</v>

1910
01:52:51.771 --> 01:52:55.100
got hit by a,
we'll go down to,
no,
it died off the cliff.
Look,

1911
01:52:55.101 --> 01:53:00.020
he's got a mouthful of far.
He died with a mouthful of further fucking monster.

1912
01:53:01.130 --> 01:53:04.850
Look at.
He's got it in his mouth as he's dead.
That's crazy.

1913
01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:09.980
Oh well we're a broken legs and shit.
Look at the fall

1914
01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:11.280
<v 5>fun.</v>

1915
01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:16.940
<v 2>Hmm.
That's crazy.
Imagine stumbling upon.</v>

1916
01:53:16.941 --> 01:53:21.690
That is a cool thing to see.
Candida.

1917
01:53:22.370 --> 01:53:26.000
I Dunno.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

1918
01:53:26.001 --> 01:53:31.001
But it's a classic glacier national park or is that at that same Montana?

1919
01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:38.300
Wow.
That's amazing.
It's so cool.
Stumbling upon things like that.

1920
01:53:38.301 --> 01:53:40.640
Just seeing,
just seeing the,
well you,

1921
01:53:40.641 --> 01:53:44.450
especially having seen wolves actually take out and elk.
Oh yeah.

1922
01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:46.940
It's pretty cool.
So what different animals?

1923
01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:49.560
<v 1>Emily,
I know this week is wolf.
Yes.
And this week,</v>

1924
01:53:49.770 --> 01:53:53.670
so the first episode we did the alligator,
it's trying to grab pig.

1925
01:53:54.300 --> 01:53:57.420
Did you?
I didn't have seen that.
Oh yeah,
that's,
that's fine.

1926
01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:00.630
So the first episode we,

1927
01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:05.780
I emulated the alligator learned from the alligator and my goal was to learn

1928
01:54:07.590 --> 01:54:08.130
from the alligator,

1929
01:54:08.130 --> 01:54:12.600
but I was trying to grab a wild boar bare handed and you got to watch that

1930
01:54:12.601 --> 01:54:15.900
episode.
It's pretty cool.
That sounds like the most ridiculous idea.

1931
01:54:15.901 --> 01:54:20.760
Or what about the tusks?
You worry about reaching back and biting you.

1932
01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:22.650
I wasn't until I was about four feet away.

1933
01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:29.400
Did you tell me,
cause that's going to drive people to the site.
Okay.

1934
01:54:29.430 --> 01:54:32.310
Apex,
Predator.
Dot.
TV Apex.
Predator dot.
TV.
If they go there,

1935
01:54:32.311 --> 01:54:35.840
they can actually stream the entire season,
right?
Yep.
Yeah.

1936
01:54:35.841 --> 01:54:39.870
The ones that haven't aired yet or no.
So what happens?
You can,
if you get,

1937
01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:44.040
if you buy the season,
the day they air,
when the air live on TV,

1938
01:54:44.070 --> 01:54:47.160
you also get access to it online.
Oh,
okay.

1939
01:54:47.161 --> 01:54:52.161
So so every Thursday at 8:00 PM east or it probably,

1940
01:54:53.010 --> 01:54:57.750
I think it's right after shorter 8:30 PM east boom in play the trailer,

1941
01:54:57.751 --> 01:54:58.410
Jamie,

1942
01:54:58.410 --> 01:54:59.280
<v 2>let's play the trailer</v>

1943
01:55:01.460 --> 01:55:04.220
<v 1>dump.
Dump,
dump,
dump in the wild.</v>

1944
01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:09.080
Every animal has adapted to survive
as humans.

1945
01:55:09.380 --> 01:55:14.030
We have learned from those adaptations to become better hunters were the

1946
01:55:14.031 --> 01:55:17.240
planet's top frame,
but we didn't get here alone.

1947
01:55:18.350 --> 01:55:19.830
Nature itself was team.

1948
01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:26.633
<v 6>I'm Remy Ma.</v>

1949
01:55:26.850 --> 01:55:30.780
I'm going to study animals in their environments and learn what makes them

1950
01:55:30.781 --> 01:55:35.781
successful and challenge myself with nearly impossible hunt giving you raw

1951
01:55:36.031 --> 01:55:38.460
skills only obtained from experience.

1952
01:55:39.790 --> 01:55:43.540
<v 1>I plan to immerse myself in nature and hunt like an</v>

1953
01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:55.990
<v 0>that's a cool fucking trailer dude.
He has great.</v>

1954
01:55:58.050 --> 01:56:01.440
Those guys at 0.0 they know what they're doing so good.

1955
01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:04.620
The thing about it is when we started doing it,

1956
01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:08.610
I mean I hate corny things and every time we'd think of an episode we go,

1957
01:56:08.611 --> 01:56:13.611
this could either be the cornice dumbest thing ever or it could be amazing and

1958
01:56:13.621 --> 01:56:17.700
the fact that we can take something and be real about it and not have to create

1959
01:56:17.701 --> 01:56:22.701
drama and other things and make it educational where you can still learn and do

1960
01:56:23.341 --> 01:56:28.341
something that nobody else has really tried and and make it not ridiculous to me

1961
01:56:28.771 --> 01:56:32.340
is a win.
Well,
I also doing it on the sportsmans channel.

1962
01:56:32.341 --> 01:56:34.890
You could actually do the whole show,
right?

1963
01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:37.710
You could actually do it the way you want to do it.

1964
01:56:37.890 --> 01:56:40.800
They're not going to fuck with you.
Where if you were doing this on,
you know,

1965
01:56:40.801 --> 01:56:42.720
fill in the blank and name another cable channel,

1966
01:56:42.721 --> 01:56:45.450
they would give you a hard time.
They just,
they're not used to hunting.

1967
01:56:45.451 --> 01:56:48.750
They would try to turn it into some bullshit reality show and predetermined

1968
01:56:48.810 --> 01:56:52.560
endings.
They would try to predetermined beats in it to make sure they kept,

1969
01:56:52.561 --> 01:56:56.600
people know there's an offer.
That first step,

1970
01:56:56.610 --> 01:56:58.890
that alligator episode we,

1971
01:56:59.910 --> 01:57:04.560
I got charged by a peg when I'm moving locations and grab it and tackle it.

1972
01:57:04.770 --> 01:57:05.880
Really?
Yeah.
Cause we were just,

1973
01:57:06.090 --> 01:57:11.090
I was just bare handing everything and I left it out of the episode because for

1974
01:57:12.091 --> 01:57:14.490
two reasons,
one,
Dan was filming,

1975
01:57:14.491 --> 01:57:16.380
he was on the other side of a Bush and so he just,

1976
01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:18.720
he didn't actually get that charge on film.

1977
01:57:19.230 --> 01:57:24.230
But the other part was I caught it in a way that wasn't about the learning

1978
01:57:25.711 --> 01:57:30.110
aspect of
the alligator.
Right.

1979
01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:32.310
So it was just an incidental,
it just happened.

1980
01:57:32.311 --> 01:57:36.720
I just got charged cackled this pig.
How did you tackle it?
And I had grabbed it,

1981
01:57:36.721 --> 01:57:38.930
pine,
the neck,
and then threw it down,
grabbed his bag.

1982
01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:43.410
Pig wasn't very big as luckily a hundred pounds,

1983
01:57:43.411 --> 01:57:47.520
50 pounds.
Um,
I don't even know.

1984
01:57:47.550 --> 01:57:51.870
75 pounds.
50 pounds.
Let's see.
Yeah.
Small,
big middle.
Yeah.
Somewhere in there.

1985
01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:55.710
So it charged you that mouth of and racks.
And the thing was honoree.
Yeah,

1986
01:57:55.720 --> 01:57:57.600
we put up an ear.
You can see that they get,

1987
01:57:57.601 --> 01:58:02.150
we put it on our youtube channel.
Oh,
you can see the video?
Yeah,
we,

1988
01:58:02.160 --> 01:58:06.990
I put that on the youtube channel,
but we didn't to,
what's the Youtube Channel?

1989
01:58:07.020 --> 01:58:11.640
Apex Predator or apex?
Predator TV.
Apex.

1990
01:58:11.641 --> 01:58:16.210
Predator TV or I dunno.
So or on our,
yeah,
me.

1991
01:58:16.211 --> 01:58:19.170
We're on our social media.
There's only code and the pig.

1992
01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:23.370
So why did they charge you?
They're,
you're just,
I don't know.

1993
01:58:23.371 --> 01:58:27.330
I just had about government and just fuckers.
Yeah.
I think that pig charged me.

1994
01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:31.440
I think that pig had been caught by human before.
Like dogs recently.

1995
01:58:31.620 --> 01:58:35.360
I think it had been let go again.
Oh by dog.
Yeah.
Cause it,

1996
01:58:35.430 --> 01:58:38.550
it looked like it had been,
so I think it was just already pissed off.

1997
01:58:38.551 --> 01:58:42.340
Enough is enough.
You fucks.
That's what he was like.
Yeah.
But you know,

1998
01:58:42.341 --> 01:58:44.470
I think pigs,
we'll do that from time to time.

1999
01:58:44.530 --> 01:58:47.950
They just kind of won't charge if they feel like it was funny because

2000
01:58:50.250 --> 01:58:53.290
that's where we recreate something.
As you notice,
there's Dan,

2001
01:58:54.990 --> 01:58:58.440
this is the recreation.
Uh Oh,
you grab a wild boar.
That's it.

2002
01:58:59.530 --> 01:59:02.310
Everything's a board by the way.
Even if it's a female,
ever noticed that.
Yeah.

2003
01:59:02.910 --> 01:59:05.890
Thank you.
A wild pig at the store,
but you can't get a wild boar.

2004
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:09.570
It's a weird way,
you know,
it's kind of stupid.

2005
01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:13.110
It just a little bit little guy.
Luckily

2006
01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:21.230
that thing charged you.
It was funny as laying in a wall and just straight up.

2007
01:59:21.290 --> 01:59:26.150
It just looks at me and there was no lag time.
Just Bam on me like that.
Wow.
Yeah.

2008
01:59:26.151 --> 01:59:28.340
That's probably a pig that had been fucked with.
Yeah.

2009
01:59:28.550 --> 01:59:33.390
So what'd you guys wind up doing with them?
Go,
but I tied it up with,
uh,

2010
01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:37.070
I had some p cord because the whole goal was I was trying to grab the Bor.

2011
01:59:37.250 --> 01:59:38.140
I wasn't going to kill him

2012
01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:42.420
<v 1>and or a peg.
It could've been if you sow to</v>

2013
01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:48.410
strolling around in my head above water using endangers thing,

2014
01:59:48.510 --> 01:59:50.790
this thing instantly charged me.

2015
01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:54.600
I mean there wasn't even a split second and wheeled around and came right at me.

2016
01:59:55.610 --> 01:59:57.920
<v 0>So wait,
wait,
what did it try to bite?</v>

2017
01:59:57.950 --> 02:00:00.500
They try to bite your leg a gate or anything.

2018
02:00:00.501 --> 02:00:03.870
It's just had mouth opening comment and you just jumped down on,

2019
02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:08.870
it's back of it's neck cause they pick camp bite its own button.

2020
02:00:09.320 --> 02:00:12.170
So if you get both of its back legs can't bite shit.

2021
02:00:12.171 --> 02:00:14.180
But it's Kinda hard to get both their back legs.

2022
02:00:14.181 --> 02:00:16.820
I ended up just kind of getting its back legs,

2023
02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:19.790
getting behind it and then throwing it down,

2024
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:24.200
putting a knee on it and then tying it hog tying it.
Wow.

2025
02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:27.590
When you let them go,
no,
you're really fucking let it go.

2026
02:00:27.980 --> 02:00:32.120
And it was uh,
we ended up having to go to,
there was a tree.
There was,

2027
02:00:32.121 --> 02:00:36.620
luckily there was like a tree stand nearby and so Dan gets up from the tree

2028
02:00:36.621 --> 02:00:41.030
standing on my all into it.
Sorry.
I think it's hanging around the tree going,

2029
02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:44.870
I had to climb up the tree stand and we let it go.
Wow.
What a gangster.

2030
02:00:44.871 --> 02:00:45.520
A little pit.

2031
02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:50.330
It was Henri and then just strolls off like I showed those guys.

2032
02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:55.160
Wow.
That's pretty cool.
Have you ever been charged by anything else in the wild?

2033
02:00:55.580 --> 02:00:57.080
Not Seriously,

2034
02:00:57.490 --> 02:01:00.040
<v 1>no.
I mean nothing that um,</v>

2035
02:01:01.330 --> 02:01:04.210
nothing life threatening really.
I would say.

2036
02:01:06.130 --> 02:01:11.130
I mean I've had l like wounded elk come pretty close then getting at me,

2037
02:01:11.711 --> 02:01:15.250
but that was just because somebody messed up and it wasn't a,

2038
02:01:15.550 --> 02:01:16.140
it was pretty weird.

2039
02:01:16.140 --> 02:01:20.010
<v 0>They were just trying to figure out a way to get out of there if they have to</v>

2040
02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:22.950
put their head down and run at you antlers first.
Yeah,

2041
02:01:23.070 --> 02:01:25.920
<v 1>exactly.
So it wasn't like a chart.
It was different.</v>

2042
02:01:26.230 --> 02:01:29.860
<v 0>Yeah.
Antlers.
The fucking antlers on elk are insane.</v>

2043
02:01:29.890 --> 02:01:34.090
How nature engineered an elk that they fall off and grow back every year.

2044
02:01:34.860 --> 02:01:38.500
Imagine really quick,
if you could harness that growing potential.

2045
02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:39.913
I think that's why,

2046
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:44.510
<v 1>that's why they put staghorn and a lot of performance enhancing things cause the</v>

2047
02:01:44.511 --> 02:01:45.530
magic powers.

2048
02:01:45.620 --> 02:01:46.520
<v 2>Well,
velvet,</v>

2049
02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:51.170
a deer antler spray is a human growth hormone enhancer.

2050
02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:52.610
Right.
I don't know if it works,

2051
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:55.670
but I know that a lot of people were getting into that.

2052
02:01:55.671 --> 02:01:56.840
Like a lot of football players

2053
02:01:57.100 --> 02:02:01.510
<v 1>supposedly now you can't even,
it's illegal to use in the NFL.
Not illegal to use,</v>

2054
02:02:01.511 --> 02:02:06.340
but like in the NFL.
Right.
Well,
I was so good.
Yeah,

2055
02:02:06.341 --> 02:02:09.970
I think so.
I,
that's what I was guiding a guy that plays for the,

2056
02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:14.980
in the NFL a couple,
few weeks ago,
a month ago,
and uh,
he was like,
yeah,

2057
02:02:14.981 --> 02:02:16.720
we can't use the stag horn.

2058
02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:19.750
<v 2>That's hilarious.
And steroids,</v>

2059
02:02:21.310 --> 02:02:23.050
they have a weird though,

2060
02:02:23.100 --> 02:02:26.380
the whole relationship that football has to steroids.

2061
02:02:26.860 --> 02:02:30.550
Is it similar way,
the what the UFC has to steroids,

2062
02:02:30.551 --> 02:02:34.900
but the UFC is more aggressively pursuing it.
I think the,
uh,
the NFL,

2063
02:02:35.290 --> 02:02:39.880
if you look at football players from the 1960s and you look at football players

2064
02:02:39.881 --> 02:02:44.650
for 2015,
you're like,
okay,
what the fuck happened?
What happened?
Did,

2065
02:02:44.740 --> 02:02:48.790
did humans evolve to humans become much larger?

2066
02:02:48.940 --> 02:02:50.440
Like what happened?
Well,

2067
02:02:50.470 --> 02:02:54.280
there's certainly like advancements in strength and conditioning programs,

2068
02:02:54.680 --> 02:02:59.650
understanding recovery and how to enhance growth and all these different things,

2069
02:02:59.651 --> 02:03:03.490
but there's also steroids.
No goddamn down about it.

2070
02:03:03.550 --> 02:03:07.510
<v 1>Supplements do make a big difference.
Oh,
I know.
It's,
you know,
anything.</v>

2071
02:03:07.900 --> 02:03:11.350
Even vitamins and things.
Oh yeah,
there you go.
But yeah.

2072
02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:15.180
<v 2>Well the size,
these fuckers,
they used to be one 90 now the three 35.</v>

2073
02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:19.740
<v 1>Oh my God.
Different game though as well.
Oh yeah,
definitely.
I mean,
the,</v>

2074
02:03:20.010 --> 02:03:24.500
the guy on the 1927 is not wearing a hell

2075
02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:30.160
<v 2>64 or 67 like I was still two 45 and 1967 that guy was unnatural toot Alan Page</v>

2076
02:03:32.200 --> 02:03:37.050
and natural to 45 big dude.
Yeah.
That's a big fucker.
And that's a,

2077
02:03:37.090 --> 02:03:42.090
that's a real two 45 whereas this guy from 2006,

2078
02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:46.690
335 pounds,
these guys are,

2079
02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:50.000
<v 1>these guys are in phenomenal shape though.
The guy that I took out,</v>

2080
02:03:50.001 --> 02:03:53.930
his name was Justin Tuck and uh,
he's a big dude,

2081
02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:58.040
but just strong.
Oh yeah.
Naturally,

2082
02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:02.090
I wouldn't want to stand in a line against the guy rip you in half

2083
02:04:02.370 --> 02:04:06.480
<v 2>Nicholas Job Raisie running at each other,
giant dudes running at each other.</v>

2084
02:04:06.780 --> 02:04:08.040
<v 1>Why it explained it.
He's like,
yeah,</v>

2085
02:04:08.041 --> 02:04:10.680
it's just like getting a car wreck daily for your job.

2086
02:04:10.710 --> 02:04:13.950
Just running into another guy that's just as big.

2087
02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:14.501
<v 2>Well,</v>

2088
02:04:14.501 --> 02:04:18.520
they're starting to realize now the overall effect of all these car wrecks and

2089
02:04:18.521 --> 02:04:19.331
it's not pretty.

2090
02:04:19.331 --> 02:04:22.690
And it's interesting because there's this class action lawsuit against the NFL

2091
02:04:22.691 --> 02:04:25.420
and there's all these different people that are saying they're going to start

2092
02:04:25.421 --> 02:04:29.290
suing and all these different players that played for years and years and years

2093
02:04:29.291 --> 02:04:32.680
that are now debilitated.
They're just,
their brains have come to toast.

2094
02:04:32.740 --> 02:04:36.790
Did you see the real sports a piece on it?
They did.
No,
I didn't.
It's scary.

2095
02:04:36.850 --> 02:04:41.850
It's terrifying because they have all sorts of like very predictable patterns

2096
02:04:43.681 --> 02:04:47.490
that these guys follow when they have traumatic brain injury,
impulsiveness,

2097
02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:50.790
violent outbursts,
uh,
memory loss.

2098
02:04:51.210 --> 02:04:53.820
And they essentially become a totally different human being.

2099
02:04:53.821 --> 02:04:56.250
And it's all because their brain is,
and the,
the,

2100
02:04:56.251 --> 02:05:00.150
the damage takes really 10 years to fully manifest.

2101
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:02.400
So if they get a massive concussion,

2102
02:05:02.580 --> 02:05:07.530
the real damage is like 10 years down the line.
It's insidious.
Hmm.
Yeah.

2103
02:05:07.531 --> 02:05:10.770
I imagine it probably goes for any full contact sport.

2104
02:05:10.830 --> 02:05:12.780
Like MMA is a real issue.

2105
02:05:13.180 --> 02:05:17.430
The real issue in MMA for sure guys are starting to talk about it now about how

2106
02:05:17.431 --> 02:05:21.740
to mitigate it by not sparring is hard.
Um,
trying to um,

2107
02:05:22.290 --> 02:05:26.430
spar less and concentrate more on strength conditioning drills,
the drills skill,

2108
02:05:26.460 --> 02:05:30.660
skill based drills for fighting.
Cause in the old days and some,

2109
02:05:30.661 --> 02:05:33.930
some camps still do it this way.
They would just go to war three,

2110
02:05:33.931 --> 02:05:34.681
four days a week.

2111
02:05:34.681 --> 02:05:38.220
They would just glove up and beat the fuck out of each other and that's how they

2112
02:05:38.221 --> 02:05:41.010
got better.
And that's how they learned.
And there's,
there's some,

2113
02:05:41.850 --> 02:05:46.220
there's some benefit to that,
you know,
me becomes normal to you.
Yeah.
You know,

2114
02:05:46.260 --> 02:05:50.280
much like when we were talking about earlier about the mental aspect of just

2115
02:05:50.281 --> 02:05:54.210
being tough enough to deal with certain situations and not,
you know,

2116
02:05:54.211 --> 02:05:59.211
not freaking out and not being overwhelmed by your,

2117
02:05:59.311 --> 02:06:03.200
your,
your thoughts.
Like,
Oh my God,
I'm suffering.
Yeah,
that's,
that's,

2118
02:06:03.210 --> 02:06:04.770
that's similar in martial arts too.

2119
02:06:04.771 --> 02:06:08.790
Like one of the sayings in Jujitsu is always you got to get comfortable with

2120
02:06:08.791 --> 02:06:13.740
being uncomfortable because Jujitsu,
like sometimes people panic tap,

2121
02:06:13.741 --> 02:06:16.480
they just get in a bad situation,
it just hurts and they just can't take it.

2122
02:06:16.481 --> 02:06:19.590
And they tap where they really don't have to tap.
It's just pain.

2123
02:06:19.740 --> 02:06:21.810
It's do not in danger of getting an arm broken.

2124
02:06:21.811 --> 02:06:25.950
You're not in danger of being put to sleep.
You're just,
you're just in pain.

2125
02:06:25.951 --> 02:06:29.940
So you've got to just deal with that and just recognize it's only a sensation.

2126
02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:33.480
And I imagine too,
once you get to a certain threshold,
you know,

2127
02:06:34.230 --> 02:06:37.440
I handled this last time and I think that happened.
Yup.

2128
02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:42.510
And then you can keep moving on.
You can,
but there's also borders.

2129
02:06:42.540 --> 02:06:44.790
There's like borders when it comes to joints.

2130
02:06:45.150 --> 02:06:47.880
Like there's some things you shouldn't fight off because like you have to

2131
02:06:47.881 --> 02:06:51.580
realize as you get older,
especially you realize,
okay,
um,

2132
02:06:51.870 --> 02:06:56.420
the reason why I don't want to tap here is because of my ego.
But if I do tap,

2133
02:06:56.430 --> 02:07:00.210
then I don't have to go to the hospital and get surgery on my fucking elbow.

2134
02:07:00.430 --> 02:07:02.310
Yeah.
But if I don't tap,

2135
02:07:02.460 --> 02:07:05.370
I'm going to get my elbow ripped apart and then they're going to have to

2136
02:07:05.371 --> 02:07:08.550
reconstruct it because I've already done this before.
Sorry.
I'll just tap.

2137
02:07:08.650 --> 02:07:10.160
All right and then you're fine.
You're good.

2138
02:07:10.350 --> 02:07:14.040
That's the cool thing about Jujitsu is you can just tap most of the time that's

2139
02:07:14.041 --> 02:07:14.551
the case.

2140
02:07:14.551 --> 02:07:18.300
There's occasional injuries but there'll be occasional injuries if you do any

2141
02:07:18.301 --> 02:07:20.640
kind of sport where you're trying really hard to do something.

2142
02:07:20.641 --> 02:07:24.960
We even tag football.
There's,
there's hardcore injuries with tag football.

2143
02:07:25.830 --> 02:07:30.750
I read somewhere that most the highest rate of sports injuries from running

2144
02:07:30.990 --> 02:07:35.620
soccer's a big one.
ACL,
ACL reconstructions for soccer.

2145
02:07:35.621 --> 02:07:36.010
It's like one

2146
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:40.240
<v 0>of the biggest uh,
methods or reasons why people tear their ligaments,</v>

2147
02:07:40.241 --> 02:07:44.110
their knees,
they're like throw a kick.
They're planted and they did,

2148
02:07:44.170 --> 02:07:48.280
they kick and their foot doesn't move and their body torques and it's taught
pop.

2149
02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:53.170
Yet those guys are,
that's one of those things.
They're in pretty good shape.

2150
02:07:53.470 --> 02:07:55.340
I mean cause you're running is a sport we were running with it.

2151
02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:57.820
What I started doing was I got like a sock.

2152
02:07:57.920 --> 02:07:59.770
I'm not very good at soccer or whatever,

2153
02:07:59.771 --> 02:08:02.200
but running up and down hills with a soccer ball,

2154
02:08:02.230 --> 02:08:05.320
like juggling it cause then you get,
you like got to control the ball.

2155
02:08:05.321 --> 02:08:08.530
So on your decent and things you're,
you're actually working a lot harder.

2156
02:08:09.130 --> 02:08:11.410
So that's what you do for training and just started that.

2157
02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:13.990
So even on the decent you have to control the ball.

2158
02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:16.120
Would you have rather than out of it or something?
Yeah.

2159
02:08:16.121 --> 02:08:17.350
Or just like try to control it.

2160
02:08:17.351 --> 02:08:21.080
Like slow it down because then otherwise you chasing a ball even though you hunt

2161
02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:24.500
like you probably like what,
300 days a year or something crazy like that.
Yeah,

2162
02:08:24.750 --> 02:08:28.030
it's been a little bit less not,
I've been doing more TV things and other stuff,

2163
02:08:28.031 --> 02:08:32.830
but yeah.
Even though all of that you still have to train for hunting.
Yeah,

2164
02:08:32.831 --> 02:08:35.390
I just,
yeah,
that's a new,
you have to,

2165
02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:38.890
that's a big one that I think there's a massive misconception in the public
side.

2166
02:08:38.891 --> 02:08:41.980
They think of hunters as being these fat guys who drink beer and go out and

2167
02:08:41.981 --> 02:08:45.670
shoot animals and laugh about it.
They don't realize like there's guys like you,

2168
02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:47.770
like you were talking about this the last time you were here,

2169
02:08:47.771 --> 02:08:51.790
you have this insane vo two Max and then when they studied you for that Predator

2170
02:08:51.791 --> 02:08:55.150
show for your Predator shores to they um,

2171
02:08:55.390 --> 02:08:59.860
they tested your vo two Max and you'll like in like some elite endurance athlete

2172
02:08:59.861 --> 02:09:00.694
territory.

2173
02:09:00.970 --> 02:09:05.170
And that is crazy because it's essentially,

2174
02:09:05.260 --> 02:09:10.060
I haven't trained for that,
but it's just by hunting.
I am training for that.

2175
02:09:10.061 --> 02:09:11.320
It is an endurance sport.

2176
02:09:11.350 --> 02:09:15.130
You're out there every day grinding and up and down mountains and

2177
02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:19.600
working hard.
It's a,
it's a hard now.

2178
02:09:19.601 --> 02:09:22.310
I mean if you're sitting in a tree stand all the time,
it's different.
Right.

2179
02:09:22.380 --> 02:09:26.020
But hunting to me is something different than maybe someone else.
Something.

2180
02:09:26.050 --> 02:09:30.160
Well that was one of the fun episodes of Solo Hunter was you up in a tree stand

2181
02:09:30.220 --> 02:09:34.060
hunting deer and you'd like to Sox,
I hate this.
I'm way to add for this.

2182
02:09:34.180 --> 02:09:36.640
Well that's with doing the Apex Predator.

2183
02:09:36.820 --> 02:09:40.210
I've realized my biggest mental thing is patience.

2184
02:09:40.570 --> 02:09:42.910
I have happy I can.

2185
02:09:42.970 --> 02:09:47.230
I'll hike all day every day for years.
Doesn't matter.
I love it,

2186
02:09:47.710 --> 02:09:51.790
but tell me to sit down for an hour like I go crazy.

2187
02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:56.410
I would not do well in prison.
He probably just get your,

2188
02:09:56.430 --> 02:10:01.430
you're probably designed like of all these years of pursuing spot and stalk

2189
02:10:02.021 --> 02:10:05.900
hunting and going after elk especially.
That's your specialty,
right?
It's elk.

2190
02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:07.930
L had so much mountain climbing.

2191
02:10:07.931 --> 02:10:12.550
It's so much hiking up hills and people don't realize how difficult that is if

2192
02:10:12.551 --> 02:10:16.390
you don't do it,
especially if you don't do it with a rifle,
a pack on your back,

2193
02:10:16.391 --> 02:10:18.550
you don't realize how God damn heavy everything is.

2194
02:10:18.850 --> 02:10:22.780
Your lungs are would give out.
Exactly.
Like my,
my legs were fine.

2195
02:10:22.820 --> 02:10:25.810
Like the first trip I ever did in Montana,
we went to the,

2196
02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:30.160
there was all this up and down and that real slippery shake.
My legs were fine,

2197
02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:33.980
but my lungs were like,
fuck dude.
He could have,
you could have

2198
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:36.200
<v 2>prepared us for this.
I was like,
I didn't know.</v>

2199
02:10:36.201 --> 02:10:37.820
I had no idea what he's going to be this hard.

2200
02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:38.640
<v 1>Oh yeah.
I mean you're,</v>

2201
02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:42.180
you're working hard in elevation with weight on your back all the time.

2202
02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:44.220
And for me,
like my side,

2203
02:10:44.250 --> 02:10:48.990
I'm not a real big guy but I can carry a lot of weight for a long ways.

2204
02:10:49.410 --> 02:10:53.610
I mean I would say body,
it'd be kind of fun to do like a comparison.

2205
02:10:53.611 --> 02:10:57.200
Bodyweight to bodyweight,
carry something up the mountain because I,

2206
02:10:57.870 --> 02:10:58.830
that's what I do all the time.

2207
02:10:58.831 --> 02:11:03.831
I carry animals out for my job is to pretty much a human meal carry shit.

2208
02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:08.270
<v 2>You must develop like really great course to ability to,</v>

2209
02:11:08.271 --> 02:11:12.800
because it's all about balancing that heavyweight on your back and then walking

2210
02:11:12.801 --> 02:11:16.840
with it and you,
you,
you have to stay tight.
Like every,
you can't slow

2211
02:11:17.380 --> 02:11:21.590
<v 1>just getting,
getting used to the weight and like,
like you say,</v>

2212
02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:25.150
you're used to that kind of pressure and pain and you realize my have get

2213
02:11:25.151 --> 02:11:25.950
through it.

2214
02:11:25.950 --> 02:11:30.690
<v 2>Human beings are very adaptable.
It's a matter of like going on and on and on.</v>

2215
02:11:30.870 --> 02:11:34.560
Like I have friends that don't work out and one of the most hilarious things

2216
02:11:34.561 --> 02:11:34.831
over,

2217
02:11:34.831 --> 02:11:37.680
I was taking one of my friends who was a comedian who doesn't work out to the

2218
02:11:37.681 --> 02:11:39.690
gym and try and put them through a workout,

2219
02:11:39.720 --> 02:11:44.720
like a just a fairly easy workout and watching them just turn blue and gray and

2220
02:11:45.751 --> 02:11:49.840
looked like he was dying and heaving and coughing and hang onto the,

2221
02:11:50.050 --> 02:11:53.550
did the recovery time he needed in between sets was hilarious.

2222
02:11:53.551 --> 02:11:55.410
It's like you realize like this guy just,

2223
02:11:55.560 --> 02:11:59.370
here's what this is what a body looks like when it's never been pushed and have

2224
02:11:59.371 --> 02:12:04.320
allowed it to live for 35 years on booze and and shitty food and then you take

2225
02:12:04.321 --> 02:12:07.170
them to the gym.
I want to get in shape.
Cool.
Come on,
I'll bring it to the gym.

2226
02:12:07.171 --> 02:12:08.430
I'll just put you,
don't kill me.

2227
02:12:08.550 --> 02:12:12.840
I'll put you through just a normal marginal workouts.
Yeah,
nothing crazy.

2228
02:12:12.990 --> 02:12:17.370
No hill sprints,
you know.
No clean and jerks,
no dead lifts,
nothing nutty.

2229
02:12:17.580 --> 02:12:20.330
I just want to get you doing some pushups.

2230
02:12:20.370 --> 02:12:25.370
Bear crawls a couple of Chin ups and just see the body reacting.

2231
02:12:26.670 --> 02:12:29.790
But if he had just done it like there's nothing exceptional about a person's

2232
02:12:29.791 --> 02:12:32.850
body,
you can do pushups and Chin ups.
It's normal.
It's normal stuff.

2233
02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:36.270
You just have to do it.
But if you did it,
just do one.

2234
02:12:37.230 --> 02:12:41.400
Do one set a day.
Well,
how many can you do?
Can you do five?
Okay,

2235
02:12:41.401 --> 02:12:45.990
do five today.
Tomorrow,
try to do five again and let's do this for a week.

2236
02:12:46.050 --> 02:12:49.380
Just do that for a week and then at the end of the week,
let's work it up to six.

2237
02:12:49.380 --> 02:12:50.071
Let's get crazy.

2238
02:12:50.071 --> 02:12:53.700
He's tried to do six today and if you just do that for six months,
guess what?

2239
02:12:53.701 --> 02:12:56.910
You can do 20 Gen apps.
It doesn't seem like it works that way,

2240
02:12:56.911 --> 02:12:59.910
but it really does.
You just got to put in the numbers.

2241
02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:04.200
And with a guy like you,
you're putting in the numbers for your hunting.

2242
02:13:04.500 --> 02:13:06.810
You know you're always did.
It's a part of your normal life.

2243
02:13:06.811 --> 02:13:08.940
Like every time I go hiking with Rinella,
I just,

2244
02:13:08.970 --> 02:13:12.840
I laughed that fucking mountain goat.
I can't keep up with them.
And you know,

2245
02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:15.420
he's just doing it every day.

2246
02:13:15.450 --> 02:13:19.050
He doesn't get tired like you'll be heaving and Helvin I'm going to how good a

2247
02:13:19.051 --> 02:13:20.100
shape you think you are.

2248
02:13:20.350 --> 02:13:23.490
The only thing that gets you prepared for doing that is doing that.

2249
02:13:23.670 --> 02:13:25.580
<v 1>Yeah,
that's,
that's exactly it because I've,</v>

2250
02:13:25.581 --> 02:13:29.040
I've taken out and hunted with a few professional athletes.

2251
02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:34.300
These guys are human specimens of the highest degree like they physically and

2252
02:13:35.971 --> 02:13:37.040
then they try hiking with me.

2253
02:13:37.930 --> 02:13:41.140
<v 0>Absolutely.
They just don't get that does like,
no,
no.</v>

2254
02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:45.730
I trained for this is what I do.
He'll fit or whatever.
Right.
If you put me in,

2255
02:13:46.060 --> 02:13:47.950
if I'm going to go bench press like humans president,

2256
02:13:47.951 --> 02:13:51.100
this is not going to happen but put a heavy pack on my back and I'll just hike

2257
02:13:51.101 --> 02:13:54.940
forever.
That's a good way of putting it.
He'll fit your fit for what you do.

2258
02:13:55.090 --> 02:13:57.220
What do you,
what do you use for like a pack?

2259
02:13:57.221 --> 02:13:59.440
What is your equipment when you like when you pack out,
meet,

2260
02:13:59.441 --> 02:14:03.700
what kind of pack do you use?
A either an internal frame or external frame.

2261
02:14:03.940 --> 02:14:08.260
What company do I just started using a kfar pack.
It's pretty good.

2262
02:14:08.380 --> 02:14:12.120
It's,
I actually used one a long time ago when they first started.

2263
02:14:12.121 --> 02:14:16.120
He'd say Kfar Faru I a f

2264
02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:22.010
a R.
U.
K.
Farro.
Keep,
it looks like key for real.

2265
02:14:22.530 --> 02:14:24.420
Uh,
it's got like a little rhino

2266
02:14:25.970 --> 02:14:28.620
symbol and either use that or for an external frame.

2267
02:14:28.621 --> 02:14:32.620
I've been using the outdoorsman.
One wilderness.
Yeah.

2268
02:14:32.760 --> 02:14:36.840
Outdoorsman outdoorsman was.com.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's what Rinella uses.
Yeah.

2269
02:14:37.330 --> 02:14:42.330
So they've designed these packs primarily for guys like you that are going to do

2270
02:14:43.771 --> 02:14:46.170
what you did in Alaska.
Yep.
Where are you going to walk?

2271
02:14:46.260 --> 02:14:50.670
Hours and hours and hours with giant slabs of meat on your back.
Yeah.

2272
02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:52.160
<v 1>And that's,
yeah.</v>

2273
02:14:52.270 --> 02:14:56.190
Special gear for a special task because it puts the weight on your,

2274
02:14:56.700 --> 02:14:59.120
on your hips and your sink,
I guess.
Yes.
Right.

2275
02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:03.220
The right above your tailbone there,
because you don't want the weight,
you know,

2276
02:15:03.230 --> 02:15:06.870
you want it above your hips so you've got full mobility and can move,

2277
02:15:06.871 --> 02:15:09.780
but kind of distribute the weight through the frame to your,

2278
02:15:10.170 --> 02:15:12.290
to your hips and yeah,

2279
02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:16.590
you can put some serious weight and some of these packs and go.
I mean,
no joke.

2280
02:15:16.591 --> 02:15:20.160
I've,
I've packed out a whole elk myself in one trip before

2281
02:15:20.390 --> 02:15:21.520
<v 0>one trip.
Yeah.</v>

2282
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:27.950
<v 1>Instagram of this one.
This dude,
we took every piece of meat,</v>

2283
02:15:27.980 --> 02:15:29.720
ribs,
uh,

2284
02:15:29.780 --> 02:15:33.410
everything like boned out and I've got a pack loaded with me and then I'm like

2285
02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:37.130
dragging two quarter up this little hill.
It was pretty cool.

2286
02:15:37.580 --> 02:15:38.690
And the guy's looking at me gone,

2287
02:15:38.790 --> 02:15:42.570
<v 0>Huh?
Yeah,
I didn't think you were much when I showed up,
but I,
you're doing it.</v>

2288
02:15:42.830 --> 02:15:46.940
I'm good on Ya.
So that's if you're,
you know,
you only got to go a short distance.

2289
02:15:46.990 --> 02:15:49.350
It was like a mile and a half.
So he just said,
fuck it.

2290
02:15:49.351 --> 02:15:53.070
Let's just do it all one job.
Go back when he was two miles,
it was uphill for,

2291
02:15:53.250 --> 02:15:57.180
I would say half a mile,
something like that.
And then the rest was downhill.

2292
02:15:57.181 --> 02:16:01.110
So I figured,
well shit,
I just get home.
And when you did that Alaska trip,

2293
02:16:01.111 --> 02:16:04.410
like how long did it take you to recover?
There's,
you drag it onto there.

2294
02:16:05.010 --> 02:16:09.660
That's a whole elk basically.
Basically.
Yeah.
I might've when I took that picture,

2295
02:16:09.661 --> 02:16:13.410
I might've had some of it out at the top already.
I can't remember.
Yeah,

2296
02:16:13.650 --> 02:16:14.670
that's a lot of fucking weight.

2297
02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:20.280
Like how long does it take you to recover from that,
that a Alaska trip?

2298
02:16:20.630 --> 02:16:21.463
<v 8>Uh,</v>

2299
02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:26.730
<v 1>I mean I recover pretty quick as the,
during the days.
I mean,</v>

2300
02:16:26.790 --> 02:16:30.400
when I sit down and recover,
I mean,
I guess afterwards,

2301
02:16:30.850 --> 02:16:35.590
me and my brother gorged like two bears on a fresh jail.

2302
02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:39.160
We got back to Kodiak and we ate at this pizza place.

2303
02:16:39.180 --> 02:16:41.610
It was probably the best meal I've ever eaten in my life.
I don't know.

2304
02:16:41.611 --> 02:16:45.850
There's just so hungry.
You're like,
yeah,
we just fucked.
Yeah,

2305
02:16:45.851 --> 02:16:49.960
we just went and got his ma or as many calories as we could.

2306
02:16:50.170 --> 02:16:52.760
We just were under or just gorge.

2307
02:16:52.761 --> 02:16:57.100
Just ate and ate and ate and ate and ate and then just slept the whole next day.

2308
02:16:57.250 --> 02:16:59.830
So I'd say a day of solid recovery.

2309
02:17:00.440 --> 02:17:02.030
<v 2>God,
that's so crazy.</v>

2310
02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:07.360
That's such a wild experience that that Kodiak island man was the subject of

2311
02:17:07.851 --> 02:17:11.420
that television show that was really controversial because it had James Hetfield

2312
02:17:11.421 --> 02:17:13.580
from Metallica was the the narrator.

2313
02:17:13.581 --> 02:17:16.760
Do you know that that show some bear hunting thing?
Yeah,

2314
02:17:16.850 --> 02:17:19.730
it was a great wells filled with fucking

2315
02:17:19.740 --> 02:17:21.050
<v 1>great I,
that's what I heard.</v>

2316
02:17:21.150 --> 02:17:24.530
That just bear sounds in the bushes and the camera's shaking.
Yeah,

2317
02:17:25.570 --> 02:17:29.890
<v 2>same bear sound and every commercial break.
What did you see him?
Where is he?</v>

2318
02:17:31.130 --> 02:17:33.390
Then it would cut to commercial and then it's some stage

2319
02:17:33.450 --> 02:17:36.450
<v 1>eg bear like from Cabela's big game hunter video game</v>

2320
02:17:36.830 --> 02:17:37.830
<v 2>there was,
it was so bad.</v>

2321
02:17:37.831 --> 02:17:41.280
It was like there was one scene where these guys were stalking this bear and the

2322
02:17:41.281 --> 02:17:43.000
guy was about to pull the trigger on,

2323
02:17:43.001 --> 02:17:46.920
on his bow and then they cut to commercial and then they come back and then all

2324
02:17:46.921 --> 02:17:50.640
of a sudden the guy doesn't have a jacket on and his pack's not there and it's

2325
02:17:50.641 --> 02:17:52.320
like he's in the same scene.

2326
02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:55.560
But did he take his pack off where you reenacting this?

2327
02:17:55.561 --> 02:17:59.310
Did you forget to wear a jacket?
There was a lot of fuckery,
man.
There was,

2328
02:17:59.460 --> 02:18:03.990
and then I talked to this dude work on the set and he was explaining to me how

2329
02:18:03.991 --> 02:18:06.360
much fuckery was going on and then it made even more sense.

2330
02:18:06.380 --> 02:18:11.000
<v 1>That's what I'm talking about,
the creating drama and I hate that,
but yep.
I,</v>

2331
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:11.943
there's,

2332
02:18:12.170 --> 02:18:16.690
I was watching some other Alaska show and there's supposedly about like a wolf

2333
02:18:16.691 --> 02:18:20.960
is coming to eat our cows and we're going to go kill this wolf and then there's

2334
02:18:20.961 --> 02:18:25.070
the wolf and then the guy gets off the horse and shoots the wolf and being a

2335
02:18:25.071 --> 02:18:25.550
hunter,

2336
02:18:25.550 --> 02:18:30.550
I mean you can immediately spot bullshit like instantly and he throws the wolf

2337
02:18:30.981 --> 02:18:34.280
on it.
It was this wolf that had been shot days ago.

2338
02:18:34.490 --> 02:18:36.480
I mean the thing had rigor mortis.

2339
02:18:36.481 --> 02:18:41.360
It's eyes are sunken and it looked like I just pulled it out of the freezer.
Oh,

2340
02:18:41.660 --> 02:18:44.630
me and my brother were laughing so hard.
He's like supposedly tying it on the

2341
02:18:44.630 --> 02:18:48.940
<v 2>horse and he's just like a stove or oh God,</v>

2342
02:18:48.980 --> 02:18:53.410
this is stupid.
They're pretending.
They just shot it.
Yeah.
Oh,
that's funny.

2343
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:55.760
There was one episode of the Alaska,

2344
02:18:55.761 --> 02:19:00.761
the last frontier a that I watched where they were fishing and it was like this

2345
02:19:01.101 --> 02:19:04.700
really badly acted thing where they're like the bear,
there's a bear.

2346
02:19:04.701 --> 02:19:06.980
I hear a bear like stop freaking out.

2347
02:19:06.981 --> 02:19:09.470
We gotta get out of here and like the bears coming.
There he is.
Look,

2348
02:19:09.471 --> 02:19:13.580
he's right over there and you look over.
The bear is eating a filleted salmon.

2349
02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:15.440
Like they filleted the,

2350
02:19:15.441 --> 02:19:18.650
the the meat off the salmon and let it looks like clearly cut.

2351
02:19:19.330 --> 02:19:24.320
Like you can't get any slice.
Like it was totally from the store.

2352
02:19:24.380 --> 02:19:28.790
They laid this fucking filleted salmon out the bones in the head and everything.

2353
02:19:28.791 --> 02:19:32.570
They laid it out there for the bear to eat so the bear would like get close to,

2354
02:19:32.571 --> 02:19:36.560
they could film it and then they're pretending it's coming after them like,
fuck,

2355
02:19:36.561 --> 02:19:40.690
are you doing,
I can't watch your show now.
Now you got me.
I can't watch it.
Yeah.

2356
02:19:42.020 --> 02:19:46.040
That's one of the thing that's really cool about your show and Rinella operates

2357
02:19:46.041 --> 02:19:50.390
the same way as does Jim Shockey that uncharted show that he has.
Amazing.

2358
02:19:50.391 --> 02:19:51.560
That's an amazing show.

2359
02:19:51.770 --> 02:19:56.770
It's more like it's a more like of a cultural exploration shell than it even is

2360
02:19:57.411 --> 02:20:01.730
a hunting show.
I mean,
he goes to these places and eventually shoots an animal,

2361
02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:05.030
but he's in like the weirdest spots on earth,

2362
02:20:05.690 --> 02:20:10.490
really dangerous war torn areas and he's bow hunting a fucking goat or
something.

2363
02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:15.210
<v 1>That's where it comes into the adventure aspect of it as well because there's so</v>

2364
02:20:15.211 --> 02:20:17.670
many aspects to hunting.
The benefit is the meat,

2365
02:20:17.700 --> 02:20:18.960
but while you're getting your meat,

2366
02:20:18.961 --> 02:20:22.530
you get these rich experiences that you can't get any other way.

2367
02:20:22.770 --> 02:20:26.640
<v 2>Well,
you get a deeper understanding of life itself in,
in,</v>

2368
02:20:27.150 --> 02:20:30.750
in the sense of the actual biological life on earth.

2369
02:20:31.170 --> 02:20:34.470
You get a deeper understanding of not just experiencing it from a video or

2370
02:20:34.471 --> 02:20:35.790
reading an article about it,

2371
02:20:35.791 --> 02:20:39.960
but from actually being there in the environment where these things live,

2372
02:20:40.230 --> 02:20:44.220
<v 1>you get it.
The other thing is you get to be a part of nature,</v>

2373
02:20:44.221 --> 02:20:45.570
not just a watcher of nature,

2374
02:20:45.580 --> 02:20:49.860
not just a bystander like even doing the apex predators show.

2375
02:20:49.861 --> 02:20:53.910
I'm looking at the way an animal lives and then trying to see how humans compare

2376
02:20:53.911 --> 02:20:54.780
and then go do it.

2377
02:20:55.260 --> 02:20:58.230
And that doing it part is completely different than the watching your part.

2378
02:20:58.260 --> 02:21:01.780
I can watch the great blue heron do something and there's it.

2379
02:21:01.860 --> 02:21:04.470
The heroin episode is obviously,

2380
02:21:04.471 --> 02:21:06.510
there's some things that are ridiculous about it.

2381
02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:09.510
Like I decided to go into a river wearing stilts.

2382
02:21:09.870 --> 02:21:13.050
I know that this seems like you're trying to make entertaining television,
but,

2383
02:21:13.610 --> 02:21:16.770
and at first I thought is this is going to be one of those things where it's

2384
02:21:16.771 --> 02:21:20.130
like the filleted Sam and type show.
Now that's a little bit last thing I want.

2385
02:21:20.460 --> 02:21:23.520
So I look at the way the great blue heron haunts and I'm,
you know,

2386
02:21:23.710 --> 02:21:28.710
birdwatching for majority of first part like watching the way these animals do

2387
02:21:28.771 --> 02:21:29.604
something.

2388
02:21:29.760 --> 02:21:33.600
And by watching my thought I understood it and then I went and did it in a

2389
02:21:33.601 --> 02:21:37.860
similar fashion where I'm now putting myself in the experience of dealing with

2390
02:21:37.861 --> 02:21:41.630
things like water,
refraction,
deep water clarity,
uh,

2391
02:21:42.450 --> 02:21:43.890
trying to sneak in and,
and,

2392
02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:47.370
and be on this elevated platform and the experience of doing it.

2393
02:21:47.430 --> 02:21:50.940
I learned something about that bird that I would have never learned otherwise.

2394
02:21:51.600 --> 02:21:55.650
And it was like this light on moment where I thought,
okay,
even in these,

2395
02:21:55.680 --> 02:21:58.140
in the midst of these semi ridiculous things,

2396
02:21:58.500 --> 02:22:03.180
I'm learning something that I can't learn by observing.
I have to learn by doing.

2397
02:22:03.620 --> 02:22:08.510
<v 2>Now were you using a bow or a spear?
Spear.
Spear and light refraction.</v>

2398
02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:10.310
From what I understand it with bow hunting,

2399
02:22:10.550 --> 02:22:15.550
you have to shoot in the water like maybe six inches below where you think the

2400
02:22:16.700 --> 02:22:17.490
fishes.

2401
02:22:17.490 --> 02:22:21.900
<v 1>Yeah.
So it,
it depends.
It varies on water clarity,
angle of the sun,</v>

2402
02:22:21.930 --> 02:22:24.630
depth of the fish.
And there was some,

2403
02:22:25.100 --> 02:22:29.070
some point I realized the fish were so deep that the spear wouldn't even really

2404
02:22:29.071 --> 02:22:32.310
reach them with enough force for penetration.

2405
02:22:32.700 --> 02:22:34.840
So was that like how,

2406
02:22:34.841 --> 02:22:38.530
how much penetration for deep,

2407
02:22:39.820 --> 02:22:41.010
deep.
So it's like three feet,

2408
02:22:41.110 --> 02:22:44.080
<v 2>so three feet.
So by the time the spear,
if you throw the spear,</v>

2409
02:22:44.081 --> 02:22:45.670
by the time it gets down to the fish,
they just

2410
02:22:45.910 --> 02:22:50.710
<v 1>ghost.
Yeah,
they see a common.
So yeah.
Hmm.</v>

2411
02:22:51.160 --> 02:22:54.320
Did you get any of that?
Oh,
don't tell me.
J eight.
Spoiler alert.
Yes.

2412
02:22:54.670 --> 02:22:58.150
Don't do it yet.
You know where you can find that Apex Predator.

2413
02:22:59.380 --> 02:23:03.760
<v 2>Yes.
That's what I hear.
I hear an apex predator.tv channel.</v>

2414
02:23:03.820 --> 02:23:08.820
You can buy the season for 1499 you can't go out or a sportsmans channel every

2415
02:23:09.131 --> 02:23:13.810
Thursday eight my DVR has four of the coyote episodes on it for some reason.

2416
02:23:13.910 --> 02:23:17.610
<v 1>Oh,
something went wacky cause it's got all kinds of,
Harrington is,</v>

2417
02:23:17.611 --> 02:23:21.770
I think it's like a couple of times on Thursday cause it's eight eastern and

2418
02:23:21.771 --> 02:23:24.050
Pacific.
Which I wasn't smart enough to figure that out.

2419
02:23:24.051 --> 02:23:27.290
Somebody had to tell him what that meant.
Like,
oh no,
no.

2420
02:23:27.620 --> 02:23:31.910
If plays it eight,
eight,
yeah.

2421
02:23:31.940 --> 02:23:35.030
Eight over here.
Eight over there.
So,
um,
how am I,

2422
02:23:35.060 --> 02:23:37.910
how many of these things have you done?
Six episodes.

2423
02:23:38.300 --> 02:23:40.520
Do you think you're going to continue to do more?
Yeah,
I hope so.

2424
02:23:40.790 --> 02:23:44.780
Do you really get to determine that is people's involvement in viewing and

2425
02:23:45.020 --> 02:23:48.410
viewership and other things,
which I think it's a,

2426
02:23:48.740 --> 02:23:52.160
this is a show that I've seen a lot of shows and this is a show that I want to

2427
02:23:52.161 --> 02:23:54.740
watch and that's,
I wanted to make a show that I wanted to watch.

2428
02:23:55.040 --> 02:23:58.040
And so this is what we attempted to do here is making sure that I want to watch.

2429
02:23:58.041 --> 02:24:01.850
So it's got one viewer,
me and if other people their works to be like,

2430
02:24:01.851 --> 02:24:03.680
that's not enough.
Okay.
You like it.

2431
02:24:03.681 --> 02:24:06.650
But you know Billy Bob over here has to like it as well.

2432
02:24:06.720 --> 02:24:07.890
<v 2>No,
I enjoyed it.</v>

2433
02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:11.430
I mean I've only seen the one the coyote with the buffalo episode,

2434
02:24:11.431 --> 02:24:13.740
but I really enjoyed it.
I think it's a really well done show.

2435
02:24:13.741 --> 02:24:18.120
Like all the 0.0 shows their grades.
They do Anthony Bourdain's show,

2436
02:24:18.121 --> 02:24:21.150
they do the meat eater show.
It's just,
it's a great company.

2437
02:24:21.151 --> 02:24:22.390
They just know how to do it.

2438
02:24:22.490 --> 02:24:24.860
<v 1>They do it right in production and they,
you know,</v>

2439
02:24:24.861 --> 02:24:28.460
they can take a concept that seems out there and it's just one of those shows

2440
02:24:28.510 --> 02:24:31.130
you,
you have to watch it to understand it.
I mean,
I could talk about it,

2441
02:24:31.131 --> 02:24:34.040
but if you really want to see if you like it or not,
you have to watch it.

2442
02:24:34.250 --> 02:24:38.300
<v 2>I think guys like you are really important in the world of hunting because</v>

2443
02:24:38.301 --> 02:24:42.950
you're this,
you're what you represent is what doesn't fit.

2444
02:24:42.951 --> 02:24:46.130
When these guys have this stereotypical idea of what a hunter is,

2445
02:24:46.490 --> 02:24:50.210
the stereotypical idea of what a hunter is to a person doesn't know any hunters.

2446
02:24:50.211 --> 02:24:53.410
They want to think of them as these loud mouth,
drunken dummies.

2447
02:24:53.411 --> 02:24:58.411
You don't really care these Babak type characters and Rinella flies in the face

2448
02:24:58.461 --> 02:25:01.680
of that as does Jim Shockey as do you.
I think it's,

2449
02:25:01.820 --> 02:25:05.690
it's really important that people don't throw out the baby with the bath water

2450
02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:10.370
because this the,
yeah,
those people are repulsive.
Yeah.

2451
02:25:10.371 --> 02:25:15.320
The people who mean the the assholes that like laugh and mock these animals as

2452
02:25:15.330 --> 02:25:18.760
they're shooting them and people who are drunks are going out there and and

2453
02:25:19.040 --> 02:25:22.940
irresponsible use of firearms and weapons.
He right.
I agree with you as,

2454
02:25:23.140 --> 02:25:24.340
as anybody that's listening,

2455
02:25:24.490 --> 02:25:29.390
someone who disperse disrespects the lives that they're taking,
you know,
and and,

2456
02:25:29.500 --> 02:25:34.500
and does it in this really repulsive way there I am a agree.

2457
02:25:35.260 --> 02:25:39.100
I,
I'm with you if you're an anti hunter because of those people.

2458
02:25:39.130 --> 02:25:42.370
I would probably,
if they were all like that,
I would be like that too.

2459
02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:45.700
But that's not what hunting has been,

2460
02:25:45.890 --> 02:25:50.380
has it as it's been explained to me and as I experienced from guys like Ryan

2461
02:25:50.380 --> 02:25:51.700
Callahan,
from guys like you,

2462
02:25:51.970 --> 02:25:56.970
from all the people out there that I've run into that are real hunters have been

2463
02:25:58.030 --> 02:26:02.770
very respectful,
very fascinated by it,
intrigued,

2464
02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:08.140
constantly curious as to the nature of these animals and super respectful of the

2465
02:26:08.141 --> 02:26:09.940
lives of these animals that they take.

2466
02:26:10.170 --> 02:26:14.280
<v 1>You know,
I think too,
it's because for a long time people,</v>

2467
02:26:14.580 --> 02:26:18.600
I think there's a lot of hunters,
they have very similar views to myself.

2468
02:26:19.020 --> 02:26:23.430
And for a long time they just haven't had necessarily the ability or the pulpit

2469
02:26:23.460 --> 02:26:26.310
to show that there's other people out there like that.

2470
02:26:26.790 --> 02:26:30.420
Because when I first started,
I've always wanted to get into hunting television.

2471
02:26:30.750 --> 02:26:34.560
And when I first started trying to break into it,
uh,

2472
02:26:34.770 --> 02:26:38.280
I got a criticism that I w there,
cause there was this model,

2473
02:26:38.281 --> 02:26:41.340
it was that bubba hunter guy and I wasn't that guy,
you know,

2474
02:26:41.341 --> 02:26:43.290
and so that the person that told me,

2475
02:26:43.291 --> 02:26:46.950
well if you really want to do this then you need to do whatever.

2476
02:26:47.340 --> 02:26:52.340
And I was on a hunt and I shot a deer and it was like I was told that I need to

2477
02:26:52.860 --> 02:26:57.690
celebrate and some extravagant fist pumping type way.

2478
02:26:58.260 --> 02:26:59.130
And I,

2479
02:26:59.370 --> 02:27:03.460
I did it for that moment and I immediately regretted,

2480
02:27:03.480 --> 02:27:08.040
I felt horrible.
I felt like this isn't me and if this is what it is,

2481
02:27:08.041 --> 02:27:12.240
I don't want to do this.
And I got,
it was like,

2482
02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:17.280
and that right there told me like if this is that industry and this is that I

2483
02:27:17.281 --> 02:27:19.770
don't want to be a part of this,
but,
and then my thought was,
you know,

2484
02:27:19.771 --> 02:27:23.730
there's probably other people out there like me that if they had the chance to

2485
02:27:23.731 --> 02:27:26.530
do it,
how just be myself and do it,

2486
02:27:26.531 --> 02:27:30.750
then they would recognize that and maybe change the whole the whole way things

2487
02:27:30.751 --> 02:27:33.150
are going.
And that's my goal.
I mean,

2488
02:27:33.151 --> 02:27:36.780
it'd be awesome to be a part of the people that change the way people see

2489
02:27:36.781 --> 02:27:40.860
hunters because I think there is the ability to make that change because there

2490
02:27:40.861 --> 02:27:44.160
is a lot of us out there that respect nature,
respect the animals,

2491
02:27:44.161 --> 02:27:49.161
see it as a way of life and not just as some crazy bubba guy out there hooting

2492
02:27:51.001 --> 02:27:55.500
and hollering and fist pumping and doing his thing and not respecting what we

2493
02:27:55.501 --> 02:27:56.334
have.

2494
02:27:56.640 --> 02:27:59.580
<v 2>The lack of appreciation for the life that you're just taken.</v>

2495
02:27:59.581 --> 02:28:04.581
And also the lack of understanding of the complexities of the whole situation is

2496
02:28:04.621 --> 02:28:08.490
also,
uh,
one of the disturbing things about the whole quote on quote bubba thing.

2497
02:28:08.540 --> 02:28:12.060
Yeah.
Like,
um,
the,
the,
the show that you put on,

2498
02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:17.180
like we got a good and we got a good,
and jihad like faking it,

2499
02:28:17.340 --> 02:28:18.860
faking it because

2500
02:28:18.890 --> 02:28:22.340
<v 1>there's,
there's,
don't get me wrong,
there's nothing wrong being excited,
right?</v>

2501
02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:25.070
Because,
and it's a different kind of excitement.

2502
02:28:25.340 --> 02:28:30.340
It's an excitement where you're excited for high.

2503
02:28:31.091 --> 02:28:35.510
It's hard to explain the type of excitement because it,
it's,
uh,

2504
02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:37.850
I took an animal,

2505
02:28:37.851 --> 02:28:42.280
but I'm excited because of the challenge and what it represents to me.
Like it,

2506
02:28:42.330 --> 02:28:45.140
it went through this,
it's not always a solemn moment,

2507
02:28:45.141 --> 02:28:50.141
but it's an excitement in this very deep moment where you did take a life of an

2508
02:28:51.021 --> 02:28:54.470
animal and you need to respect that.
And for me,
I always have,

2509
02:28:54.471 --> 02:28:57.050
and I've expected the entire journey to get to that point.

2510
02:28:57.260 --> 02:29:02.260
And so for me to smile behind an animal to me means it's not disrespectful.

2511
02:29:02.820 --> 02:29:03.121
<v 2>Right.</v>

2512
02:29:03.121 --> 02:29:06.510
There's nothing wrong with being with a big animal that you shot the very happy

2513
02:29:06.511 --> 02:29:09.960
it all worked out well and smiling.
Correct.
But people do.
They think,
Oh,

2514
02:29:09.961 --> 02:29:14.760
you've got to be somber.
You've just killed.
You've just taken a life.
Well,
why?

2515
02:29:14.850 --> 02:29:19.410
If you respect the life,
if you're happy that it all worked out well,
you're,

2516
02:29:19.411 --> 02:29:23.370
you're,
you're,
you're happy with your accomplishment and your hard work paid off.

2517
02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:27.840
Why can't you smile?
Is it disrespectful to the life that you've taken to smile?

2518
02:29:28.120 --> 02:29:32.730
It doesn't make the life any less significant if you don't smile or do smile.

2519
02:29:32.920 --> 02:29:34.080
It doesn't change anything.

2520
02:29:34.380 --> 02:29:38.340
But what I think what you bring to the table and what you know,

2521
02:29:38.341 --> 02:29:43.260
guys like Shockey or Rinella bring to the table is a level of,

2522
02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:44.950
<v 1>of</v>

2523
02:29:44.950 --> 02:29:47.950
<v 2>intellectual capability,
uh,
level of,
uh,</v>

2524
02:29:47.980 --> 02:29:52.980
the ability to communicate really complex situations to the average person that

2525
02:29:53.771 --> 02:29:57.730
doesn't ever get involved with taking the life of an animal to fruit to

2526
02:29:57.731 --> 02:30:01.090
communicate that in a way where someone could be listening to this podcast.

2527
02:30:01.091 --> 02:30:03.880
And it's one of the things that I get from people that listen to the podcasts

2528
02:30:03.881 --> 02:30:04.720
that have hunters on the go.

2529
02:30:04.721 --> 02:30:08.860
I never had this opinion of hunting until I listened to these guys in these

2530
02:30:08.861 --> 02:30:11.170
podcasts.
I always had this really negative,

2531
02:30:11.320 --> 02:30:16.090
really stereotypical view of what a hunter is and now I kind of understand it.

2532
02:30:16.091 --> 02:30:19.480
And um,
I've gotten that like guys on my message board,

2533
02:30:19.481 --> 02:30:22.030
there's guys on my message board that have evolved over the time.

2534
02:30:22.031 --> 02:30:25.360
They've been there where they were there years ago and they had this idea like

2535
02:30:25.361 --> 02:30:28.570
all hunters are assholes.
And then as time went on,

2536
02:30:28.600 --> 02:30:32.020
they kind of been exposed to all these different people and all these different

2537
02:30:32.021 --> 02:30:34.920
conversations.
They realize,
oh,
we're,

2538
02:30:34.930 --> 02:30:39.820
we're just involved in this weird culture that has this,

2539
02:30:39.821 --> 02:30:43.480
this compartmentalization of various aspects of life.

2540
02:30:43.630 --> 02:30:46.000
And the big one is where you get your food from.

2541
02:30:46.150 --> 02:30:49.210
So there's people that are criticizing people that do it themselves.

2542
02:30:49.730 --> 02:30:54.730
There's no better way for an animal to die than by a hunter.

2543
02:30:55.240 --> 02:30:56.680
There really is no better way.

2544
02:30:56.950 --> 02:31:01.950
If you shoot a deer or an elk and that animal is dead within seconds,

2545
02:31:02.260 --> 02:31:05.980
that is the most peaceful way it's ever going to die,

2546
02:31:06.370 --> 02:31:08.650
the most pure way you're ever going to acquire me.

2547
02:31:08.860 --> 02:31:13.860
It's so much less struggle and less less suffering.

2548
02:31:13.901 --> 02:31:17.740
Then being a domesticated animal that's raised to be slaughtered,

2549
02:31:17.980 --> 02:31:21.000
it's so much better than killed by a Predator out in the wild.

2550
02:31:21.001 --> 02:31:25.110
It's going to slowly eat you asshole first.
You know?
I mean there's,

2551
02:31:25.260 --> 02:31:29.040
there's no better way.
If you really truly love animals,

2552
02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:33.690
you've got to take into account a few undeniable truths.

2553
02:31:33.960 --> 02:31:37.680
One is that populations need to be controlled and they are controlled through

2554
02:31:37.681 --> 02:31:41.730
the natural way with predators,
but when we live in those environments,

2555
02:31:41.731 --> 02:31:44.790
you have to pick a team.
If you're going to say team people,

2556
02:31:44.880 --> 02:31:47.730
well then you're going to have to control the predators as well and you have to

2557
02:31:47.731 --> 02:31:51.510
control the game animals because look tried living in upstate New York where you

2558
02:31:51.511 --> 02:31:54.510
can't even drive down the road without slamming into a suicidal deer.

2559
02:31:54.810 --> 02:31:57.990
I mean they have some places where they have to control the populations of deer

2560
02:31:58.230 --> 02:32:02.130
so badly that they have,
like in Pennsylvania they don't even have a season.

2561
02:32:02.280 --> 02:32:06.750
This is parts of Pennsylvania where you could just go and just shoot deer all

2562
02:32:06.751 --> 02:32:08.520
the time and he's like suburban areas.

2563
02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:11.910
They did an episode of bone collector on it cause these guys got up in a tree

2564
02:32:11.911 --> 02:32:14.730
stand in the summer and just fucking shooting deer and left and right.

2565
02:32:14.790 --> 02:32:17.610
They're everywhere because they're the people who are running into them.

2566
02:32:17.611 --> 02:32:21.240
They're getting deer ticks.
People are getting,
well Lyme disease because of it.

2567
02:32:21.710 --> 02:32:26.220
There's,
there's a lot more to what hunting is and to what,

2568
02:32:27.930 --> 02:32:32.010
what it represents to the people that are involved in it.
Then the bubba image.

2569
02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:33.990
<v 1>Yeah.
And there's always,</v>

2570
02:32:34.810 --> 02:32:37.310
the thing that always makes me laugh is the people that say,

2571
02:32:37.340 --> 02:32:39.800
oh we'll just release more predators to control.

2572
02:32:40.010 --> 02:32:43.970
Like if you're all about animal population control,
like make it before humans.

2573
02:32:44.300 --> 02:32:48.860
Like before Hume,
they are the,
what did they say?
It was fine before we got here.

2574
02:32:49.100 --> 02:32:51.410
And I always laugh to say when is when we got here,

2575
02:32:51.411 --> 02:32:55.610
you mean white people is a waspy out look on life.

2576
02:32:56.330 --> 02:32:59.780
Like before we got here,
before people came across the land bridge,

2577
02:32:59.781 --> 02:33:02.000
like humans and animals have been,

2578
02:33:02.720 --> 02:33:06.950
especially on an art con on any continent have been coexisting for a very long

2579
02:33:06.951 --> 02:33:10.370
time and humans have been a prime hunter of these animals as a,

2580
02:33:10.430 --> 02:33:13.220
as a Predator in the natural food chain.

2581
02:33:13.510 --> 02:33:16.430
I mean the animals that we didn't hunt no longer exists.

2582
02:33:16.431 --> 02:33:20.320
I haven't seen a t rex in a long time.
So we were in a route for them.
Yeah,

2583
02:33:20.410 --> 02:33:22.100
exactly.
That's the argument to,
you know,

2584
02:33:22.101 --> 02:33:23.900
if you want to really bring it back to the old days,

2585
02:33:23.901 --> 02:33:28.880
let's start bringing dinosaurs.
Exactly how.
Yeah.

2586
02:33:29.090 --> 02:33:32.520
<v 2>Well one of the main arguments with how human beings brains developed as to</v>

2587
02:33:32.540 --> 02:33:34.190
large sizes because of hunting,

2588
02:33:34.191 --> 02:33:37.580
because it's a sophisticated methods that we need to employ to make sure that we

2589
02:33:37.581 --> 02:33:38.590
kept eating food,
mood

2590
02:33:38.660 --> 02:33:38.830
<v 1>and,</v>

2591
02:33:38.830 --> 02:33:43.010
and one of the things that like looking at apex spreader really kind of looks at

2592
02:33:43.011 --> 02:33:45.260
humans and animals.
And,
and what we,

2593
02:33:45.290 --> 02:33:50.220
how we've adapted and learned from nature if you,
if we were out there and,

2594
02:33:50.300 --> 02:33:52.430
okay,
well yeah,
our brains,

2595
02:33:52.490 --> 02:33:57.490
it all comes back to we have every animal out there couldn't possibly beat us in

2596
02:33:58.400 --> 02:34:01.070
certain way or whatever has specialized in certain way,

2597
02:34:01.190 --> 02:34:04.250
but it comes back to our brains.
We can figure out how to do what they do best.

2598
02:34:04.460 --> 02:34:05.840
And that's what the show explores,

2599
02:34:05.930 --> 02:34:09.200
how we figure out how to do what they do best and see how we compare to it.

2600
02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:12.680
And a lot of times we may not compare and in a certain way,

2601
02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:16.940
but it comes back to using our brains and figuring out a way to make up for

2602
02:34:17.140 --> 02:34:20.530
adaptations.
So you did eight episodes this year,
you did the coyote,

2603
02:34:20.531 --> 02:34:25.030
the wolf alligator.
What are the golden mean?
Oh,
six Golden Eagle.

2604
02:34:25.540 --> 02:34:28.090
Yeah.
So is the coyote one was looking at that Kaplan painting,

2605
02:34:28.091 --> 02:34:32.590
but using the coyote skin in that fashion.
So the coyote,
the wolf,

2606
02:34:32.710 --> 02:34:36.850
the Golden Eagle,
the great blue heron,
the river otter,

2607
02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:41.440
and the American alligator.
And if you,
when you're done with all this,

2608
02:34:41.470 --> 02:34:44.800
what are your next ideas?
Ah,
we've got,
I want to do,

2609
02:34:45.160 --> 02:34:49.720
so even it's called Apex Predator,
but sometimes titles of shows,

2610
02:34:49.721 --> 02:34:52.960
maybe Celine,
because I want to also want to look at every aspect of nature,

2611
02:34:52.961 --> 02:34:54.370
not just predators,

2612
02:34:54.610 --> 02:34:57.010
because I think there's a lot of other animals that can teach us things.

2613
02:34:57.011 --> 02:34:59.920
So we're,
we're considering humans as an apex Predator.

2614
02:34:59.921 --> 02:35:03.820
How did we get to this point by learning from nature as well as these changes

2615
02:35:03.821 --> 02:35:04.540
that we've made.

2616
02:35:04.540 --> 02:35:08.110
So one thing that I would like to do is look at camels and the way they carry

2617
02:35:08.111 --> 02:35:09.670
water,
because humans are,

2618
02:35:10.050 --> 02:35:13.480
I at Campbell can carry water and humans are one of the only predators that can

2619
02:35:13.481 --> 02:35:16.480
carry water.
So you think of that as an advantage.
And Hannah,

2620
02:35:16.490 --> 02:35:19.120
how we compare to a camel,
like how much water can camera,

2621
02:35:19.121 --> 02:35:21.310
how long they can go stages of dehydration.

2622
02:35:21.311 --> 02:35:25.440
So I'd like to explore that and hunt in a desert situation for an animal that,

2623
02:35:25.470 --> 02:35:29.970
that necessarily not,
I wouldn't be hunting for camels and quote,

2624
02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:34.290
trust me,
I,
that's not something I want to get into.
But uh,
uh,

2625
02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:38.110
another desert animal,
maybe an AOD at or something.
And in a very arid climate.

2626
02:35:38.680 --> 02:35:40.780
Uh,
what else there was,
um,

2627
02:35:41.350 --> 02:35:44.000
I'd really like to look at the way mountain lions there.

2628
02:35:44.030 --> 02:35:46.480
They're so quiet when they walk and some of these,

2629
02:35:46.630 --> 02:35:50.260
you look at some of these episodes,
you just see it as a 30 minute episodes.

2630
02:35:50.261 --> 02:35:54.390
Some of these episodes I've trained for months to prepare to do this episode.
Uh,

2631
02:35:54.400 --> 02:35:56.470
the wolf episode,
I mean I was training,
running,

2632
02:35:56.471 --> 02:36:00.760
doing a lot of things to prepare myself to be able to attempt to run an elk
down.

2633
02:36:01.240 --> 02:36:05.260
And one of these episodes that we had slated an idea of,

2634
02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:09.070
I was training for is this mountain lion episode where I compare how mountain

2635
02:36:09.071 --> 02:36:12.550
lions,
like the amount of noise they make when they walk is very little.

2636
02:36:12.880 --> 02:36:17.510
I've had them just walk past me,
never heard a thing.
So let's measure it,

2637
02:36:17.680 --> 02:36:22.090
kind of measure how loud it mountain lion is when it's walking and then us with

2638
02:36:22.091 --> 02:36:27.040
our boots on and us with our bare feet and then so and then go and do a hunt

2639
02:36:27.050 --> 02:36:27.883
barefoot.

2640
02:36:28.330 --> 02:36:33.070
And so for months I was training to harden my feet and get 'em tough enough

2641
02:36:33.071 --> 02:36:35.800
where I could go in the desert and hunt an animal barefoot,

2642
02:36:36.310 --> 02:36:37.750
but we ended up not doing that episode.

2643
02:36:37.751 --> 02:36:42.580
So for months I was walking around there but just I think because this is how

2644
02:36:42.630 --> 02:36:45.640
crazy your a toughening my feet so I'm going to have to do that all over again.

2645
02:36:46.030 --> 02:36:49.750
But there's a that that's one of them and we've got a lot.

2646
02:36:49.780 --> 02:36:51.550
You got any crazy ideas because there's a lot of,

2647
02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:54.770
a lot of cool animals out there that I'd like to explore.
We have,

2648
02:36:54.790 --> 02:36:58.170
did you get your feet?
I could walk for a while and,

2649
02:36:58.270 --> 02:37:01.360
and not worry about it but so they just got thickly calloused and yeah,

2650
02:37:01.361 --> 02:37:02.194
they're already,

2651
02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:07.420
I think what I've noticed is it was more of a a sensory thing.

2652
02:37:07.570 --> 02:37:10.270
Your feet don't necessarily get that much tougher.

2653
02:37:10.450 --> 02:37:14.290
You just learn to feel the ground different.

2654
02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:16.430
Will you ever seen that from dual survivor

2655
02:37:16.460 --> 02:37:19.450
<v 0>that walks everywhere barefoot?
Yeah.
He's such a goofball.</v>

2656
02:37:19.720 --> 02:37:24.170
It's like one of those shows where you know these guys like for sure there's

2657
02:37:24.171 --> 02:37:27.910
some fucker going on in the show for sure.
Yeah.
But this guy it,

2658
02:37:27.980 --> 02:37:31.400
whereas no shoes like this,
this,
this idea that you know,

2659
02:37:31.820 --> 02:37:34.070
to really truly survive,
you know,
you get,

2660
02:37:34.071 --> 02:37:37.910
you're going to have to go without shoes because occasionally you find yourself

2661
02:37:37.911 --> 02:37:40.400
with no shoes and then you'd be fucked because your feet are soft.

2662
02:37:40.401 --> 02:37:43.400
So he doesn't want to be in that situation.
So it's fetus,
they're always hard.

2663
02:37:43.430 --> 02:37:47.600
It does tough.
And your feet.
I did before I did,
I did like a lot of research,

2664
02:37:47.601 --> 02:37:48.170
just some,

2665
02:37:48.170 --> 02:37:51.290
there's some crazies out there that are all about this like new shoe thing and

2666
02:37:51.470 --> 02:37:54.700
there's dudes that talk about drawing like a fake sandal on your foot.

2667
02:37:54.701 --> 02:37:58.640
So cause you can't go into place as you know,
like no shoes,
no shirt,
no service.

2668
02:37:58.820 --> 02:38:00.890
So they've got all these like tricks of making like a rope,

2669
02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:04.190
a pair of cord fake Sandal so people don't really notice that you're barefoot

2670
02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:09.170
was and then how to like get into it and start by going on varying terrain and

2671
02:38:09.500 --> 02:38:11.630
actually had to spend,
while I was trying to toughen my feet,

2672
02:38:11.631 --> 02:38:12.800
I had to spend some time in la.

2673
02:38:12.801 --> 02:38:16.580
So I was like cruising down downtown la and your skid row barefoot.

2674
02:38:16.581 --> 02:38:19.080
And I thought this is a good way to pick up a disease.
I'm not saying

2675
02:38:20.600 --> 02:38:22.990
exactly like glass and all kinds of stuff.

2676
02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:27.530
That's probably the biggest training near skid row when the cops pull you over

2677
02:38:27.670 --> 02:38:31.130
weed,
I'm training for a hunting show.
Fuck.

2678
02:38:32.300 --> 02:38:37.190
Exactly.
That's all you're going to jail is.
So there's,

2679
02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:40.370
we've got a lot of,
a lot of things.
Slate,
a lot of different animals.

2680
02:38:40.371 --> 02:38:44.990
I want to look at a trapdoor spider.
They're cool to me.

2681
02:38:45.110 --> 02:38:47.120
Trapdoor,
spiders or spider,
what are they?

2682
02:38:47.140 --> 02:38:51.020
It's a spider that hides and then when something comes by,

2683
02:38:51.110 --> 02:38:53.450
jumps out real fast and grabs it.

2684
02:38:53.690 --> 02:38:58.050
So I wanted to build some kind of hobble and weight in it and tried to grab it,

2685
02:38:58.130 --> 02:38:59.560
a deer or something.
And it comes from,

2686
02:39:00.230 --> 02:39:03.710
so we've got all kinds of fun stuff like that.
Um,

2687
02:39:03.980 --> 02:39:06.920
when you grab the deer or will you try and kind of try to kill it like with a

2688
02:39:06.921 --> 02:39:08.570
knife or something?
And I think,
uh,

2689
02:39:08.620 --> 02:39:13.580
on those type of episodes I probably let it go because I have the opportunity to

2690
02:39:13.581 --> 02:39:17.900
let it go.
And,
and I may,
I,
I don't really know.

2691
02:39:18.170 --> 02:39:19.160
I think I would just let it go.

2692
02:39:19.280 --> 02:39:23.930
How much do you communicate with people that are critics of hunting?
Uh,

2693
02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:28.880
I don't communicate with very many people ever because I'm always out doing

2694
02:39:28.881 --> 02:39:31.610
stuff.
But you mean like in my day to day?

2695
02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:34.730
Do you ever have issues with people that have problems with hunting?
And I don't,

2696
02:39:35.180 --> 02:39:37.610
that's one of the things about hunting that I think is

2697
02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:43.940
kind of weird is there's,
there's not a lot of communication.

2698
02:39:44.510 --> 02:39:47.300
There's like the converted,
like preaching to the choir.

2699
02:39:47.630 --> 02:39:51.440
And then there's these other people that have these misconstrued ideas is

2700
02:39:51.441 --> 02:39:55.670
misconceptions about what hunting is.
And they don't seem,
one of the problems,

2701
02:39:55.671 --> 02:39:58.460
they don't seem to get together and talk that often and I've seen Rinella have

2702
02:39:58.461 --> 02:40:02.450
conversations with people that were kind of anti hunters I guess.
You know,

2703
02:40:02.451 --> 02:40:06.620
actually in my day to day I do have a lot of conversation with people that

2704
02:40:06.770 --> 02:40:07.341
aren't hunters,

2705
02:40:07.341 --> 02:40:10.970
but there they're also people that are close to me and they know it.
Yeah.

2706
02:40:10.980 --> 02:40:14.250
I'm like family members that are hunters.
You,
it's funny as my

2707
02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:17.690
<v 1>brother's girlfriend comes from a family that not hunters,</v>

2708
02:40:17.700 --> 02:40:21.750
like she's the typical Yogi type that would never consider hunting.

2709
02:40:21.751 --> 02:40:23.760
She didn't even like eating very much.

2710
02:40:23.761 --> 02:40:28.050
Meat gave me and now this year she went and got her a hundred safety and is

2711
02:40:28.051 --> 02:40:29.430
going to go hunt elk.
Whoa.

2712
02:40:29.460 --> 02:40:32.490
Because I think when you really sit down and think about it,

2713
02:40:33.450 --> 02:40:38.100
if you're talking to somebody that like myself or you know people that are like

2714
02:40:38.101 --> 02:40:41.970
minded to me,
there's a lot of things that we can pull from that.

2715
02:40:42.570 --> 02:40:46.380
If you just actually had a real conversation and take out all the bullshit of

2716
02:40:46.381 --> 02:40:48.600
the,
I don't even know on both sides.

2717
02:40:48.601 --> 02:40:51.470
I call it like the hunting propaganda and the non hunter propaganda,

2718
02:40:51.490 --> 02:40:54.560
the things that you're told and you think or whatever.

2719
02:40:54.570 --> 02:40:57.600
You just actually have a real conversation about it.
It makes sense.

2720
02:40:57.920 --> 02:40:58.753
I'm saying makes sense.

2721
02:40:59.170 --> 02:41:03.430
<v 2>It makes sense and it's also,
it sounds bizarre and contradictory,</v>

2722
02:41:03.431 --> 02:41:07.690
but it's very spiritual.
Yeah.
There's something.
It sounds cool.
I go,
no,
it's,
no,

2723
02:41:07.691 --> 02:41:10.840
you're taken alive.
I get all the arguments.
I understand the arguments,

2724
02:41:11.260 --> 02:41:13.210
but I'm telling you there's something,

2725
02:41:13.420 --> 02:41:18.420
there's something even psychedelic about going into their world and and hunting

2726
02:41:19.721 --> 02:41:23.560
them,
dipping your toe into the wild,
the true wild.

2727
02:41:23.830 --> 02:41:27.270
There's something like boundary dissolving about that it,

2728
02:41:27.340 --> 02:41:31.810
it changes the way I looked at the whole world.

2729
02:41:32.200 --> 02:41:35.670
It really did.
Like the first time I went deer hunting,
the,

2730
02:41:35.780 --> 02:41:38.650
one of the crazy things about it was looking at this dear look,

2731
02:41:38.700 --> 02:41:43.180
locking eyes with this thing in the wild and understanding the roles that we

2732
02:41:43.181 --> 02:41:43.511
have.

2733
02:41:43.511 --> 02:41:47.800
My role is the Predator that his role is trying to get the fuck away from me and

2734
02:41:47.801 --> 02:41:50.110
then taking his life and killing and eating it.
And I was like,

2735
02:41:50.111 --> 02:41:52.360
this is a spiritual experience,

2736
02:41:52.790 --> 02:41:57.610
a deeply spiritual experience in a weird way that I didn't anticipate.

2737
02:41:57.850 --> 02:42:02.850
I anticipated it being maybe somber and that I would have to get over the

2738
02:42:03.431 --> 02:42:07.240
sadness of it all and then I might not even want to do it again and maybe I just

2739
02:42:07.241 --> 02:42:10.660
become vegetarian.
Those were real considerations that I had,

2740
02:42:10.990 --> 02:42:13.720
but after the event,
I felt like there's,

2741
02:42:13.840 --> 02:42:18.310
there's something that most folks are missing about this experience and I think

2742
02:42:18.311 --> 02:42:23.200
it's because it's been very poorly represented in our culture by media,

2743
02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:27.400
by these,
the,
the,
the stereotypical bubba type by all these different,

2744
02:42:28.260 --> 02:42:32.620
the different pieces of information that have sort of filtered down to the,

2745
02:42:32.621 --> 02:42:37.621
the average urban civilization inhabitant,

2746
02:42:38.350 --> 02:42:41.350
the,
we don't,
we don't have a connection to it.

2747
02:42:41.500 --> 02:42:45.520
So we're basing our opinions on it.
It's just based on stereotypes on,

2748
02:42:45.820 --> 02:42:48.460
on these immediate depictions of what a hunter is.

2749
02:42:49.120 --> 02:42:50.110
<v 1>Yeah,
it's,</v>

2750
02:42:51.150 --> 02:42:55.660
it's those kind of false ideas.
But then when you,

2751
02:42:55.661 --> 02:42:59.800
if you actually got to talk to someone,
but it's also one of the things,

2752
02:43:00.220 --> 02:43:03.070
you talk about it.
We talk about,
we're sitting here talking about it,

2753
02:43:03.250 --> 02:43:04.810
but until you go through that experience,

2754
02:43:04.840 --> 02:43:08.920
you necessarily don't know what it feels like,
what it means,

2755
02:43:08.921 --> 02:43:13.330
what it means to you.
My mom's Stepdad called GRANDPA.

2756
02:43:14.260 --> 02:43:18.880
He loves fishing big out,
like loves nature,

2757
02:43:18.881 --> 02:43:22.390
hiking.
Other things went hunting,
shot a bird,

2758
02:43:23.020 --> 02:43:26.590
felt really sad,
never went hunting,
but that was his experience.

2759
02:43:26.770 --> 02:43:30.250
So everybody has a d maybe experiences it in a different way,

2760
02:43:31.060 --> 02:43:35.170
but you really don't know until you jump in and do that experience.

2761
02:43:35.410 --> 02:43:37.750
I talked to someone who had that similar experience with a deer.

2762
02:43:38.080 --> 02:43:40.560
They've shot a deer and the deer was moaning when it was on the ground,

2763
02:43:40.570 --> 02:43:44.650
like all this crazy noises and never went hunting again.
Right.
Yeah,

2764
02:43:44.651 --> 02:43:48.160
and it just depends on maybe your,
your experience,

2765
02:43:48.161 --> 02:43:52.120
but also I think it depends on how your reason for going out there.

2766
02:43:52.510 --> 02:43:56.350
Like if you are,
I've never hunted before,
and you say to yourself,

2767
02:43:56.560 --> 02:44:01.560
I would like to go hunting because I'd like to eat less meat that I don't know

2768
02:44:02.681 --> 02:44:05.350
where it came from.
Be more involved in that process.

2769
02:44:05.490 --> 02:44:06.430
Like if you went out and said,

2770
02:44:06.431 --> 02:44:10.420
I have a goal that maybe one day I'd like to in my house only eat things that

2771
02:44:10.421 --> 02:44:12.820
I've killed even before you've even killed anything.

2772
02:44:13.540 --> 02:44:16.480
You go out with that mind set up and then it becomes a utility thing.

2773
02:44:16.540 --> 02:44:21.430
It becomes like a part of your process for your life and I think it affects you

2774
02:44:21.431 --> 02:44:25.930
differently because you go,
okay,
there's a reason for this.
There's a like,

2775
02:44:26.270 --> 02:44:30.040
I'm eating animals anyways,
I'm killing animals anyways.

2776
02:44:30.070 --> 02:44:31.750
I might as well be a part of the process.

2777
02:44:32.590 --> 02:44:36.220
You're killing them with your credit card,
your money,
somebody else.

2778
02:44:36.250 --> 02:44:40.850
Maybe you're not seeing it,
but it's happening.
It's not going to not happen.
Okay.

2779
02:44:40.851 --> 02:44:43.120
That's something that has a direct result of your choices.

2780
02:44:43.150 --> 02:44:46.780
That's something that we conveniently try to distance ourselves from.
Yeah.

2781
02:44:47.230 --> 02:44:51.750
So if you can be part of that process,
then it's not something,
I mean it's,

2782
02:44:51.760 --> 02:44:55.240
it's a,
it's a different experience.
It really is.
I don't,

2783
02:44:55.630 --> 02:44:58.160
it's very hard to explain,
but I think we,

2784
02:44:58.190 --> 02:45:02.020
we sit here for however long and try to explain it.
It would take days.
Yeah.

2785
02:45:02.080 --> 02:45:02.913
You just,

2786
02:45:03.070 --> 02:45:08.020
it's very hard for people to get involved too that aren't hunters grates me and

2787
02:45:08.021 --> 02:45:12.030
I don't know what,
because I get a lot of,
a lot of people,
uh,

2788
02:45:12.160 --> 02:45:14.980
on social media or whatever that I've listened to,

2789
02:45:15.370 --> 02:45:17.830
like found me through your podcasts or whatever.

2790
02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:21.130
And a lot of them have now jumped into hunting and there's still a lot of them.

2791
02:45:21.131 --> 02:45:22.420
They're trying to figure out how to do it.

2792
02:45:22.421 --> 02:45:26.140
And I would say the main question I get asked is,
is how I get into,
or how,

2793
02:45:26.500 --> 02:45:28.900
how would someone get into it?
Really?
I mean,

2794
02:45:28.901 --> 02:45:31.660
the first thing you got to take the hunter safety and do the legal requirements

2795
02:45:31.690 --> 02:45:32.530
because once you have that,

2796
02:45:32.531 --> 02:45:36.820
then your barriers to entry are slowly getting less and less.

2797
02:45:37.090 --> 02:45:41.080
And then really just getting hooked up with somebody that hunts.

2798
02:45:41.081 --> 02:45:45.010
And maybe that's through like hunting conservation organizations.

2799
02:45:45.280 --> 02:45:48.900
I think there's a big niche there that could step up and go to the,

2800
02:45:48.901 --> 02:45:52.120
some of these events because I find there's a lot of conservation organizations

2801
02:45:52.121 --> 02:45:52.901
that you can join,

2802
02:45:52.901 --> 02:45:57.340
say wild sheep foundation or elk foundation and you'd go out on these projects

2803
02:45:57.400 --> 02:46:02.290
and do something for a while.
I've like build a water guzzler,
receipt,

2804
02:46:02.291 --> 02:46:03.370
an area that's burnt,

2805
02:46:03.371 --> 02:46:07.810
do all these things are conservation efforts that are done by hunters and you

2806
02:46:07.811 --> 02:46:10.580
meet other people because hunters if you,

2807
02:46:10.581 --> 02:46:14.900
if you meet him in the flesh are probably really willing to help you out if you

2808
02:46:14.901 --> 02:46:15.231
were like,

2809
02:46:15.231 --> 02:46:17.950
I really want to get into this and you've got to find the right type of guy too

2810
02:46:18.140 --> 02:46:20.960
or woman or whatever to to get you into it.

2811
02:46:20.961 --> 02:46:23.240
But that's the easiest way is to have somebody show you like a mentor.

2812
02:46:23.640 --> 02:46:25.860
<v 2>This a place where I hunted Moose,</v>

2813
02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:29.040
I should tell people about this guy cause he's awesome.
Big country outfitters.

2814
02:46:29.041 --> 02:46:33.510
Dot.
Ca uh,
in uh,
northern BC.
Um,

2815
02:46:34.060 --> 02:46:37.310
my cockroach is a guy who is a,
the,
the main guide.

2816
02:46:37.330 --> 02:46:40.290
He's got other gods there as well that work with them.
But,
uh,

2817
02:46:40.291 --> 02:46:42.900
he does that with people that have never hunted before.

2818
02:46:42.901 --> 02:46:44.670
He'll take you through the whole deal,

2819
02:46:44.671 --> 02:46:48.930
take you through the whole explaining to you how to shoot,

2820
02:46:48.931 --> 02:46:52.860
explaining to you how you know how to breathe when you're pulling the trigger.

2821
02:46:52.890 --> 02:46:57.510
How do you know what shot placement aiming,
you know,

2822
02:46:57.511 --> 02:47:02.250
how to do the whole deal.
He'll take you through the whole day,
stalking,
hunting,

2823
02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:05.520
butchering the whole deal.
And um,
he's,

2824
02:47:05.550 --> 02:47:10.130
he's about as real a guy as you can get to.
I,

2825
02:47:10.140 --> 02:47:14.660
I love that dude.
He's fucking awesome.
I had a great time with him and,
uh,

2826
02:47:14.670 --> 02:47:18.600
he's one of the few outfitters that I know that welcomes people that have never

2827
02:47:18.601 --> 02:47:20.430
had an any hunting experience whatsoever.

2828
02:47:20.700 --> 02:47:22.860
And he had some disaster stories because of that.

2829
02:47:23.970 --> 02:47:25.860
People panic and they freak out.
And

2830
02:47:26.030 --> 02:47:29.250
<v 1>those are my favorite people to guide though because they don't come in with an</v>

2831
02:47:29.251 --> 02:47:32.370
expectation of something that there's,
you know,
I mean,

2832
02:47:32.371 --> 02:47:35.460
there are hunters out there,
they have just expectations that I'm not okay with.

2833
02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.550
And so people that are looking for a new experience,

2834
02:47:38.551 --> 02:47:39.660
they're there for the experience.

2835
02:47:39.720 --> 02:47:43.240
Like people that go in with an expectation of a certain size animal.
Yeah.

2836
02:47:43.260 --> 02:47:48.050
Or like,
you know,
I think the,
or,
yeah.

2837
02:47:48.240 --> 02:47:51.630
Like they,
they pay for a hundred.
I don't sell animals.
I'm,
I'm an outfitter.

2838
02:47:51.631 --> 02:47:55.470
I sell and a hunting experience.
I take you hunting.
I don't sell you an animal.

2839
02:47:55.550 --> 02:47:57.960
It doesn't just cause you go hunting doesn't mean you're going to kill
something.

2840
02:47:57.990 --> 02:48:01.900
Yeah.
It's not possible.
No,
it's not.
No one can be there for a tea.

2841
02:48:02.060 --> 02:48:04.020
Like if you're new and you're there for the experience,

2842
02:48:04.021 --> 02:48:05.490
you're learning something.
Whether you kill someone,
you're not.

2843
02:48:05.491 --> 02:48:09.420
Obviously you want to shoot something that's the end goal,
that's the result.

2844
02:48:09.421 --> 02:48:11.040
But it's so much more than that.

2845
02:48:12.070 --> 02:48:15.790
<v 2>It is.
It is so much more than that.
And I hope these conversations do help.</v>

2846
02:48:15.791 --> 02:48:18.970
I think they do.
I think they do.
I think that people learn from them.

2847
02:48:18.971 --> 02:48:23.971
And I think that where we're doing our part to it express what we've learned

2848
02:48:24.701 --> 02:48:28.600
with,
for you,
it's your whole life.
For me,
it's just over the last few years.
But,

2849
02:48:28.601 --> 02:48:31.180
uh,
it's,
it's not what people think it is.

2850
02:48:31.181 --> 02:48:33.670
And if you're tired of these conversations to go fuck yourself,

2851
02:48:34.540 --> 02:48:39.310
I'm tired of you not knowing their,
yeah.
