1
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.680
<v Speaker 1>Four three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.190
<v Speaker 1>one dude.</v>

3
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.843
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what possessed you to want to swim </v>

4
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.510
<v Speaker 2>around the entire UK?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many thousands of miles is that?</v>

5
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.820
<v Speaker 2>2000 miles altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 2>2000 miles of swimming.</v>

7
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:26.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.063
<v Speaker 2>It seemed like a good idea at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then half way round I realized how </v>

9
00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:32.150
<v Speaker 2>big Great Britain was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

10
00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:35.000
<v Speaker 2>you've done some long swims before,</v>

11
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.493
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

12
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.683
<v Speaker 2>not like nothing even remotely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's the longest swim you did </v>

13
00:00:40.361 --> 00:00:41.680
<v Speaker 2>before this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

14
00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

15
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.510
<v Speaker 2>this is a bit of a strange story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

16
00:00:43.511 --> 00:00:44.344
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to swim between Saint Lucia </v>

17
00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:48.240
<v Speaker 2>Martinique to Caribbean islands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

18
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.140
<v Speaker 2>it's only 40 kilometers from point to </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

19
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.670
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for charity,</v>

20
00:00:51.671 --> 00:00:52.504
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to swim from point to point</v>
<v Speaker 2>with 100 pound tree attached to my </v>

21
00:00:56.291 --> 00:00:57.370
<v Speaker 2>trunks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

22
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.240
<v Speaker 2>so I was pulling the hunch of foundry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a six foot waves crashing down and,</v>

23
00:01:01.241 --> 00:01:03.520
<v Speaker 2>and I actually didn't make it from point</v>
<v Speaker 2>to point.</v>

24
00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:07.870
<v Speaker 2>I was like five kilometers from the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I didn't make it,</v>

25
00:01:07.871 --> 00:01:08.704
<v Speaker 2>I decided to swing back the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I ended up swimming over a hundred </v>

26
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.610
<v Speaker 2>kilometers with a hundred pound tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took me 32 hours,</v>

27
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.440
<v Speaker 2>but still didn't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

28
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.210
<v Speaker 2>so what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

29
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.990
<v Speaker 2>what went wrong where you didn't make </v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

30
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Tides currents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

31
00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:22.331
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

32
00:01:22.331 --> 00:01:23.470
<v Speaker 2>you just get swept away.</v>

33
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:26.260
<v Speaker 2>And especially attached to a tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

35
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.060
<v Speaker 2>How big secrets his tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

36
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.470
<v Speaker 2>so a hundred pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

37
00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:31.150
<v Speaker 2>it floats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was more of the drag.</v>

38
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.323
<v Speaker 2>So if there's any influence from tidal </v>
<v Speaker 2>currents and it's pulling you in one </v>

39
00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:35.980
<v Speaker 2>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

40
00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:39.400
<v Speaker 2>I was basically gonna Miss Martinique </v>
<v Speaker 2>know I was heading to Cuba,</v>

41
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere like that.</v>

42
00:01:40.661 --> 00:01:41.494
<v Speaker 2>And then on the way back down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they turned to me again and they </v>

43
00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:45.790
<v Speaker 2>said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to miss St Lucia,</v>

44
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.633
<v Speaker 2>you're going to end up in how to net </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatevers further south than Saint </v>

45
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.710
<v Speaker 2>Lucia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

46
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.010
<v Speaker 2>and I think I realized this as </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically fit as you are.</v>

47
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ocean just,</v>

48
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.180
<v Speaker 2>just doesn't care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't care.</v>

49
00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:00.130
<v Speaker 2>And so after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was last year,</v>

50
00:02:00.131 --> 00:02:02.240
<v Speaker 2>this was November last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

51
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.530
<v Speaker 2>kind of felt I had unfinished business </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the ocean.</v>

52
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came back,</v>

53
00:02:07.211 --> 00:02:08.044
<v Speaker 2>came back to England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rung up from friends of mine at the </v>

54
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Royal Marines.</v>

55
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.371
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

56
00:02:12.371 --> 00:02:13.270
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to sound so,</v>

57
00:02:13.271 --> 00:02:14.200
<v Speaker 2>so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

58
00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:16.510
<v Speaker 2>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to get out of my system.</v>

59
00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:18.730
<v Speaker 2>I just need to see how far I can swim in</v>
<v Speaker 2>48 hours.</v>

60
00:02:18.731 --> 00:02:21.180
<v Speaker 2>So I swan 40 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

61
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.083
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't there and it was 160 </v>

62
00:02:23.051 --> 00:02:23.920
<v Speaker 2>kilometers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

63
00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:24.754
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I finished and I had basically </v>

64
00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:28.550
<v Speaker 2>trench foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So where your,</v>

65
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.550
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your feet and your hands are.</v>

66
00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:32.980
<v Speaker 2>So kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got so much water in.</v>

67
00:02:32.981 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 2>This one was going moldy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

68
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had 21,</v>

69
00:02:36.071 --> 00:02:37.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nursing,</v>

70
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:38.830
<v Speaker 2>nursing my feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

71
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.420
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the offices,</v>

72
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good friend of mine and they came over</v>

73
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.443
<v Speaker 2>and they just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

74
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real English royal.</v>

75
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.780
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you boy.</v>

76
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.093
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

77
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.671
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

78
00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:49.870
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you training for?</v>

79
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.883
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

80
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.753
<v Speaker 2>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm training for a potentially </v>

81
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.950
<v Speaker 2>attempting the world's longest current </v>
<v Speaker 2>neutral swim.</v>

82
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 2>And then just paused and he sits his cup</v>
<v Speaker 2>of tea</v>

83
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 3>and he looked me up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just goes at,</v>

84
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 3>just sounds a bit lame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

85
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you want me to do?</v>

86
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 3>And he pauses and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just need to man up.</v>

87
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.260
<v Speaker 3>We need to man up and swim around Great </v>
<v Speaker 3>Britain.</v>

88
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.090
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

89
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.983
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

90
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't say no once the agency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you swim with me bitch,</v>

91
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.983
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a crazy thing for someone to be </v>

92
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:24.480
<v Speaker 3>asking you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I know,</v>

93
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>

94
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once the idea stuck with me,</v>

95
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

96
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.150
<v Speaker 3>we've got this real history and heritage</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

97
00:03:32.151 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 3>of British eccentric explorers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for me growing up,</v>

98
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:37.264
<v Speaker 3>there's a story of Captain Web.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the first guy to swim across the </v>

99
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:40.324
<v Speaker 3>English Channel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and for those who don't know English </v>

100
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:42.311
<v Speaker 3>Channel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

101
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:43.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tides,</v>

102
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:44.020
<v Speaker 3>they believe what?</v>

103
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.880
<v Speaker 3>We're too strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The water was too cold.</v>

104
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:49.000
<v Speaker 3>They said you just can't make it across.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The English Channel isn't possible.</v>

105
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.630
<v Speaker 3>But captain web refused to listen and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>1875 August across the English Channel,</v>

106
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:56.044
<v Speaker 3>and this is the part I love on a diet of</v>
<v Speaker 3>beef broth and brandy in a woolen </v>

107
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:00.490
<v Speaker 3>wetsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He swam,</v>

108
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 23 hours breaststroke </v>
<v Speaker 3>with his head out of the water because,</v>

109
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:05.284
<v Speaker 3>and I quote front crawl was </v>
<v Speaker 3>ungentlemanly like and there was that </v>

110
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:11.890
<v Speaker 3>element that I just thought that's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

111
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 3>Front crawl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does the front crossbar,</v>

112
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.000
<v Speaker 3>so it's a basically that's front the </v>
<v Speaker 3>regular one.</v>

113
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But way back in 1875 it was like,</v>

114
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:19.294
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's sorrows and gentlemanly the </v>

115
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:23.470
<v Speaker 3>movement itself themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

116
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 3>It was still being developed as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>technique.</v>

117
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:26.074
<v Speaker 3>Whereas you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you are a gentleman and you were a </v>

118
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:28.950
<v Speaker 3>swimmer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you swim breaststroke,</v>

119
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

120
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.550
<v Speaker 3>Head out of the water the whole time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole way.</v>

121
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:34.960
<v Speaker 3>23 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

122
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:35.771
<v Speaker 3>like th the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

123
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:37.350
<v Speaker 3>the support boat was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

124
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.081
<v Speaker 3>get out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>

125
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:39.130
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to make it.</v>

126
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:41.230
<v Speaker 3>And he just refused and 23 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

127
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:44.200
<v Speaker 3>that's part of a night swim as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had out the water just all the way.</v>

128
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.590
<v Speaker 3>Why Brandy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is he getting fucked up or just a little</v>

129
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:49.890
<v Speaker 3>bit of brand?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know?</v>

130
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.733
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it might have been a bit of Dutch </v>

131
00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:52.714
<v Speaker 3>courage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there was certainly back </v>

132
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:56.020
<v Speaker 3>then sports nutrition isn't what it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

133
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.480
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think there was an element,</v>

134
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.190
<v Speaker 3>he was even like lubing himself up in </v>
<v Speaker 3>goose fat,</v>

135
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.043
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is waiting back and make himself </v>

136
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.490
<v Speaker 3>slicker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slicker.</v>

137
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:05.450
<v Speaker 3>And I think there was an element of warm</v>
<v Speaker 3>for that was the,</v>

138
00:05:05.451 --> 00:05:06.430
<v Speaker 3>certainly the belief.</v>

139
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.430
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Tour de France guys,</v>

140
00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:10.264
<v Speaker 3>didn't they drink wine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was like a big thing back in the </v>

141
00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:13.120
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Way Back.</v>

142
00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:14.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it wasn't too long ago.</v>

143
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't be me and Jamie would just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

144
00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:18.370
<v Speaker 3>just talking now about football back in </v>
<v Speaker 3>England and it wasn't till,</v>

145
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.350
<v Speaker 3>you know too long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

146
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.193
<v Speaker 3>maybe a hundred years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used to just keep brandy in the </v>

147
00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:26.310
<v Speaker 3>dressing room in case you needed to warm</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself up real and out.</v>

148
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

149
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 3>So they play soccer drunk there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

150
00:05:30.551 --> 00:05:32.860
<v Speaker 3>kind of just slope with a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>

151
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.890
<v Speaker 3>just turn it over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

152
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.250
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

153
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:41.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't understand that it's taken,</v>

154
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like Captain Web,</v>

155
00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:47.710
<v Speaker 3>maybe me to a smaller extent to just </v>
<v Speaker 3>raise the bar,</v>

156
00:05:47.711 --> 00:05:50.320
<v Speaker 3>push the boundaries and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

157
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:51.663
<v Speaker 3>you've seen that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think our generation have seen that </v>

158
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.250
<v Speaker 3>with the UFC with mixed martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 3>that has evolved so fast.</v>

159
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm always remember</v>

160
00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.023
<v Speaker 2>forrest griffin used the kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>likened himself to the basketball </v>

161
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:04.240
<v Speaker 2>players just shooting three pointers </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the ball between the legs,</v>

162
00:06:04.241 --> 00:06:05.074
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that always resonated with me </v>

163
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:07.281
<v Speaker 2>because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

164
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:08.114
<v Speaker 2>the evolution that we've seen and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of Bruce Lee had the foresight to </v>

165
00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 2>predict is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think in a,</v>

166
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:15.980
<v Speaker 2>in a much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>

167
00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:18.200
<v Speaker 2>much smaller way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

168
00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:20.480
<v Speaker 2>to go back to sort of British athletes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and adventurers.</v>

169
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.860
<v Speaker 2>Roger bannister first nights running a </v>
<v Speaker 2>four minute mile people said couldn't be</v>

170
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was a medical student at the time</v>

171
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.270
<v Speaker 2>leading physicians that he can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your lungs will explode,</v>

172
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 2>your legs will fall off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All sorts.</v>

173
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

174
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.403
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oxford laced up his trainers and ran a </v>

175
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:36.824
<v Speaker 2>four minute mile similar right now to </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I think we're seeing with Kip </v>

176
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.421
<v Speaker 2>Shogi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

177
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the two hour marathon.</v>

178
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.450
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

179
00:06:44.451 --> 00:06:45.830
<v Speaker 2>in a much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much smaller way,</v>

180
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.100
<v Speaker 2>when I had that conversation about </v>
<v Speaker 2>swimming around Great Britain,</v>

181
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.710
<v Speaker 2>everybody said it can't be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

182
00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:55.290
<v Speaker 2>it's 2000 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's giant whirlpools in Scotland</v>

183
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 2>called the Chorea Vecan pentland firth </v>
<v Speaker 2>renowned around the world.</v>

184
00:06:58.911 --> 00:06:59.744
<v Speaker 2>If you get that wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll disappear in backwards at 10 </v>

185
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:02.684
<v Speaker 2>knots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

186
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.460
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you're swimming against </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

187
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:07.010
<v Speaker 2>And 10 us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a dolphin speed.</v>

188
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.870
<v Speaker 2>She was 10 knots in miles per hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A basically 10 miles per hour,</v>

189
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.910
<v Speaker 2>10 miles per hour backwards as you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to go forwards basically.</v>

190
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:18.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Penn versus the top of Scotland,</v>

191
00:07:18.591 --> 00:07:21.950
<v Speaker 2>the currents that go across there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's running at a good clip,</v>

192
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.903
<v Speaker 2>but yo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

193
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we got it good.</v>

194
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.700
<v Speaker 2>We managed to basically predict it so </v>
<v Speaker 2>well that I,</v>

195
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.250
<v Speaker 2>I think that was probably my top speed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I did 8.7</v>

196
00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:32.780
<v Speaker 2>knots is 8.7</v>
<v Speaker 2>miles per hour.</v>

197
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.260
<v Speaker 2>I was basically cruising along the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is wow,</v>

198
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.960
<v Speaker 2>we just like a dolphin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you were having the waves behind you,</v>

199
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.093
<v Speaker 2>pushing you almost and see now that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting because I had the </v>

200
00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:43.514
<v Speaker 2>tides and currents with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily the way I said it wrong </v>

201
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.113
<v Speaker 2>and when you get bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually you made a good point in </v>

202
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:49.244
<v Speaker 2>terms of when you get windover tide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you've got 10 knots going this </v>

203
00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:54.350
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he even got a little bit of wind and</v>

204
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:59.351
<v Speaker 2>waves going this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can get choppy again and again.</v>

205
00:07:59.451 --> 00:08:02.480
<v Speaker 2>Sort of looking at west Scotland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>windover tide,</v>

206
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.900
<v Speaker 2>you can get 40 knots coming straight </v>
<v Speaker 2>down the barrel,</v>

207
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:10.340
<v Speaker 2>but you're trying to swim with the tide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

208
00:08:10.341 --> 00:08:13.310
<v Speaker 2>the wind is coming at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the tide is going the opposite.</v>

209
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.680
<v Speaker 2>And as you can imagine that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

210
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

211
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.070
<v Speaker 2>So how do you predict this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

212
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.340
<v Speaker 2>this tide that you have to get right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

213
00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:24.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in completely in theory.</v>

214
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.760
<v Speaker 2>And this is what I realized when I sat </v>
<v Speaker 2>down and we started sort of plotting the</v>

215
00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:29.780
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this called again?</v>

216
00:08:29.781 --> 00:08:32.060
<v Speaker 2>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the issue that will push you back?</v>

217
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the title.</v>

218
00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:34.340
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it called?</v>

219
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.640
<v Speaker 2>That area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

220
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.980
<v Speaker 2>so you got to get right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

221
00:08:36.981 --> 00:08:41.570
<v Speaker 2>so penn unferth pending for the panel </v>
<v Speaker 2>and for Pendleton for,</v>

222
00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.650
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

223
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:44.330
<v Speaker 2>And that's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

224
00:08:44.331 --> 00:08:46.220
<v Speaker 2>renowned around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But equally,</v>

225
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.440
<v Speaker 2>if you imagine the shape of Great </v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain,</v>

226
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:49.303
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of kind of compression</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the water would just come rushing </v>

227
00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:55.100
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as well as the panel and firth,</v>

228
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 2>you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

229
00:08:55.981 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Speaker 2>six knots around whales.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an island called Scoma.</v>

230
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.860
<v Speaker 2>And if you get that right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are disappearing,</v>

231
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:02.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're winning,</v>

232
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 2>you get it wrong again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going backwards.</v>

233
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:10.230
<v Speaker 2>And for my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me to do a continuous stage swim,</v>

234
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.473
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to start where I was going </v>

235
00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:15.150
<v Speaker 2>backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for me,</v>

236
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.253
<v Speaker 2>getting every single tied right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why so far the team were </v>

237
00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:19.680
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>

238
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:20.803
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Captain Matt was just incredible </v>

239
00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:25.240
<v Speaker 2>that every night the homework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we okay here?</v>

240
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.060
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did we crash?</v>

241
00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.360
<v Speaker 2>All right folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're listening or watching,</v>

242
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:31.523
<v Speaker 2>we had a little technical difficulty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is not streaming live will be </v>

243
00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:34.644
<v Speaker 2>uploaded later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were just going over how you </v>

244
00:09:37.591 --> 00:09:41.670
<v Speaker 2>predicted you had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and your team had to predict how the</v>

245
00:09:41.671 --> 00:09:42.504
<v Speaker 2>tide was coming because if it went wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd get pushed backwards and like 10 </v>

246
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:46.290
<v Speaker 2>miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

247
00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.330
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

248
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.530
<v Speaker 2>and this is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with the great British swim,</v>

249
00:09:49.531 --> 00:09:53.850
<v Speaker 2>we were kind of taking swimming as most </v>
<v Speaker 2>people understand it and we were,</v>

250
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.960
<v Speaker 2>we were removing it and putting it in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>arena that was so different.</v>

251
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:02.600
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's why it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it did so well kind of online as well as</v>

252
00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:05.250
<v Speaker 2>the community around it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously swimmers were interested,</v>

253
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:06.084
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surfers started to get involved because </v>

254
00:10:07.621 --> 00:10:09.200
<v Speaker 2>they understood the waves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

255
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.560
<v Speaker 2>sailors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fisherman,</v>

256
00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:12.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of people started to say,</v>

257
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes in Great Britain it's not safe</v>

258
00:10:15.271 --> 00:10:17.610
<v Speaker 2>to take a boat around the top of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Scotland.</v>

259
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.331
<v Speaker 2>In it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

260
00:10:18.331 --> 00:10:20.280
<v Speaker 2>nevermind a swimmer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

261
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.590
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why it was amazing that,</v>

262
00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:25.470
<v Speaker 2>that on the entire series it became,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

263
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:26.543
<v Speaker 2>a melting pot and exchange of ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>because nobody knew how to get a human </v>

264
00:10:31.441 --> 00:10:35.510
<v Speaker 2>body around the coast of Great Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't just about swimming and,</v>

265
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.590
<v Speaker 2>and that was what was really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

266
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.010
<v Speaker 2>how do they know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when the tides are going one way or</v>

267
00:10:41.011 --> 00:10:42.660
<v Speaker 2>the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do they predict that?</v>

268
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

269
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.280
<v Speaker 2>tied to so predictable.</v>

270
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.950
<v Speaker 2>So in theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they change every six hours.</v>

271
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.440
<v Speaker 2>So in theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we sat down and we looked,</v>

272
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:54.630
<v Speaker 2>and we know that if you do six hours on </v>
<v Speaker 2>six hours off for 157 days,</v>

273
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.520
<v Speaker 2>you'll make it around the coast of Great</v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain.</v>

274
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:57.111
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

275
00:10:57.111 --> 00:10:58.260
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was the theory.</v>

276
00:10:58.261 --> 00:11:01.380
<v Speaker 2>So you do this by phasic sleep and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>swim for 12 hours a day.</v>

277
00:11:01.381 --> 00:11:03.960
<v Speaker 2>But that's all theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's times when,</v>

278
00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:06.330
<v Speaker 2>as I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a giant whirlpools or,</v>

279
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.330
<v Speaker 2>or the tides might not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you imagine sort of,</v>

280
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.193
<v Speaker 2>that's Great Britain there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tides don't necessarily go always </v>

281
00:11:12.991 --> 00:11:14.250
<v Speaker 2>like this or they're not that </v>
<v Speaker 2>predictable.</v>

282
00:11:14.251 --> 00:11:18.840
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes if there's kind of like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's kind of whales there,</v>

283
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.700
<v Speaker 2>the tides will do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

284
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:25.260
<v Speaker 2>you're doing all these different things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people are not going to see instead</v>

285
00:11:25.261 --> 00:11:28.230
<v Speaker 2>of listening to it on audio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just try to just describe it.</v>

286
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.063
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a basically rather than the tides </v>

287
00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.100
<v Speaker 2>just going up and down and working with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

288
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.360
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they cross cross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

289
00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:36.720
<v Speaker 2>So you'll just kind of getting slapped </v>
<v Speaker 2>across the face.</v>

290
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.720
<v Speaker 2>My tides essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not just helping you,</v>

291
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:44.070
<v Speaker 2>you're going to basically zigzag all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way up the coast of Great Britain.</v>

292
00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:44.904
<v Speaker 2>So it was predictable as tides are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We found those so much stuff that when </v>

293
00:11:47.851 --> 00:11:49.080
<v Speaker 2>we're out there we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

294
00:11:49.081 --> 00:11:49.914
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't meant to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or a giant whirlpool wasn't meant to be </v>

295
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.270
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is an,</v>

296
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.760
<v Speaker 2>and that was what was pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

297
00:11:57.761 --> 00:11:59.230
<v Speaker 2>pretty sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sometimes,</v>

298
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.350
<v Speaker 2>you know that when we were out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a whirlpool just decides to appear,</v>

299
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.050
<v Speaker 2>you've got you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not really enough time to say,</v>

300
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:05.591
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hang on,</v>

301
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:07.330
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't on the map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we look at that?</v>

302
00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:09.550
<v Speaker 2>Can we speak to the Met Office and talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

303
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:10.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weather reports?</v>

304
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.373
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

305
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.040
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had to swim through it or,</v>

306
00:12:13.041 --> 00:12:14.800
<v Speaker 2>or try and get out there as quick as you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could.</v>

307
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.500
<v Speaker 2>So when you encounter something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and you get stuck,</v>

308
00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:21.460
<v Speaker 2>do you pull out of the water and try </v>
<v Speaker 2>back again later at the same location?</v>

309
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.920
<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But quite often if it was there,</v>

310
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.380
<v Speaker 2>it's still gonna be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

311
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.440
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is what it is.</v>

312
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes there's this notion and,</v>

313
00:12:29.461 --> 00:12:32.100
<v Speaker 2>and perhaps the best example of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned it for,</v>

314
00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.760
<v Speaker 2>it's called the Chorea Vecan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

315
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:34.883
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of west coast of Scotland and it's </v>

316
00:12:37.211 --> 00:12:38.640
<v Speaker 2>a giant whirlpool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

317
00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.270
<v Speaker 2>and Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the captain turned to me and said,</v>

318
00:12:40.271 --> 00:12:41.104
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ross,</v>

319
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:42.023
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need you to swim and I need you to </v>

320
00:12:42.461 --> 00:12:43.291
<v Speaker 2>swim hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

321
00:12:43.291 --> 00:12:44.124
<v Speaker 2>you need to swim six hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just need to be clear this </v>

322
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:46.810
<v Speaker 2>whirlpool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

323
00:12:46.811 --> 00:12:47.644
<v Speaker 2>so as we were swimming past it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I set my watch and some hard for six </v>

324
00:12:50.351 --> 00:12:51.820
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but about three hours in,</v>

325
00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:52.903
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got stung by jellyfish and I've been </v>

326
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.700
<v Speaker 2>stung by jellyfish a lot before he sees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

327
00:12:57.701 --> 00:12:58.900
<v Speaker 2>it's painful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>

328
00:12:58.990 --> 00:12:59.860
<v Speaker 2>it was bearable.</v>

329
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:01.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this one particular jellyfish,</v>

330
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.150
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was searing into my skin.</v>

331
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.670
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't stop throbbing.</v>

332
00:13:06.671 --> 00:13:07.504
<v Speaker 2>And so I carried on swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three hours passed and it was just </v>

333
00:13:10.181 --> 00:13:11.014
<v Speaker 2>unbearable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I popped my head up and I looked at </v>

334
00:13:11.861 --> 00:13:13.060
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the captain from the boat.</v>

335
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.141
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

336
00:13:14.141 --> 00:13:15.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm so sorry I've been stung and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

337
00:13:15.671 --> 00:13:17.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

338
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.990
<v Speaker 2>I've been stung by a jellyfish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pitched the pain's just not going away.</v>

339
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:21.460
<v Speaker 2>And as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said that to him,</v>

340
00:13:21.461 --> 00:13:22.660
<v Speaker 2>he looked down at me and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

341
00:13:22.661 --> 00:13:24.760
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause the tentacles still wrapped around</v>

342
00:13:24.761 --> 00:13:27.640
<v Speaker 2>your face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'd basically been swimming for three</v>

343
00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:31.540
<v Speaker 2>hours with a jellyfish on your case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wearing a jellyfish.</v>

344
00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:35.300
<v Speaker 2>It wrapped into my goggles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I took my gold,</v>

345
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.580
<v Speaker 2>unpeel this fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tend to call,</v>

346
00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.810
<v Speaker 2>threw it away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

347
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:41.830
<v Speaker 2>and then like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

348
00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:42.940
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you in a minute.</v>

349
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.480
<v Speaker 2>I'll ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a picture where my,</v>

350
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.333
<v Speaker 2>my face sorta change shape and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>goggles wouldn't fit on my face anymore </v>

351
00:13:49.541 --> 00:13:52.400
<v Speaker 2>because my eye sockets were so swelled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

352
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.940
<v Speaker 2>but I knew that again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for all of this happening,</v>

353
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.460
<v Speaker 2>the cory of Eq and the giant Walpole was</v>
<v Speaker 2>still to my left.</v>

354
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.020
<v Speaker 2>So Matt was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still need to swim.</v>

355
00:13:59.021 --> 00:14:01.360
<v Speaker 2>You still need to swim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I ended up paying the goggles over my</v>

356
00:14:01.361 --> 00:14:06.160
<v Speaker 2>face and to try and get them to seal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just punched them into my face.</v>

357
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.530
<v Speaker 2>So you just had these perfect ring and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I managed,</v>

358
00:14:08.531 --> 00:14:09.700
<v Speaker 2>you're a sore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Swollen.</v>

359
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:10.563
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're a push them through the </v>

360
00:14:11.651 --> 00:14:13.300
<v Speaker 2>swelling basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

361
00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.490
<v Speaker 2>John.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you swim.</v>

362
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:16.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made another hour.</v>

363
00:14:16.691 --> 00:14:17.524
<v Speaker 2>We got clear the cory of Atkins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We managed to clear this giant </v>

364
00:14:19.361 --> 00:14:22.810
<v Speaker 2>whirlpool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I collapse onto the boat and um,</v>

365
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:23.703
<v Speaker 2>and this is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was at that point that I collapsed </v>

366
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.260
<v Speaker 2>exhausted face.</v>

367
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Now a different shape to when I started </v>
<v Speaker 2>that particular swim.</v>

368
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:30.423
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

369
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.130
<v Speaker 2>and the team looked at me and they saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>how bad I was,</v>

370
00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:33.973
<v Speaker 2>how be it an upper was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also knew that the sea just </v>

371
00:14:36.791 --> 00:14:37.624
<v Speaker 2>doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in six hours the tide was going to </v>

372
00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:41.920
<v Speaker 2>change and I'm not going to have to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that all over again.</v>

373
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:47.460
<v Speaker 2>And it was that kind of brutal lesson </v>
<v Speaker 2>from nature that,</v>

374
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.440
<v Speaker 2>that from a sports science background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in,</v>

375
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rehab,</v>

376
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:52.521
<v Speaker 2>rest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recovery,</v>

377
00:14:52.521 --> 00:14:54.350
<v Speaker 2>nutrition strategies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this.</v>

378
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:59.180
<v Speaker 2>But with sending around Great Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it very quickly became apparent that the</v>

379
00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:00.014
<v Speaker 2>seed just doesn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't care that you need to </v>

380
00:15:03.021 --> 00:15:03.854
<v Speaker 2>rehab your shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't care that the ligaments and </v>

381
00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:06.074
<v Speaker 2>tendons in your shoulders are hurting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might get impingement from swimming </v>

382
00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:10.760
<v Speaker 2>too much in none of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

383
00:15:10.761 --> 00:15:11.594
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why it went from swimming as I </v>

384
00:15:14.751 --> 00:15:15.584
<v Speaker 2>understood it and how a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand it to something completely </v>

385
00:15:18.411 --> 00:15:20.450
<v Speaker 2>like surviving basically in the water.</v>

386
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.553
<v Speaker 2>So you're swimming schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be six hours on and then you would </v>

387
00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:26.390
<v Speaker 2>try to rest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When would you eat?</v>

388
00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.120
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the swims or,</v>

389
00:15:28.121 --> 00:15:30.140
<v Speaker 2>or between Erin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The swims.</v>

390
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:31.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

391
00:15:31.131 --> 00:15:32.600
<v Speaker 2>I quite often just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

392
00:15:32.601 --> 00:15:37.130
<v Speaker 2>throwing bananas at me and just multi </v>
<v Speaker 2>bananas basically.</v>

393
00:15:37.131 --> 00:15:38.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

394
00:15:38.241 --> 00:15:39.074
<v Speaker 2>Just so deep or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'd eat and while you're in the </v>

395
00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:41.330
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

396
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.991
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

397
00:15:41.991 --> 00:15:42.830
<v Speaker 2>Cause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause again,</v>

398
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.660
<v Speaker 2>going back to what we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the pen and firth,</v>

399
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.700
<v Speaker 2>you could get out and you could get on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the boat,</v>

400
00:15:46.701 --> 00:15:51.701
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes in a really good tide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are just in the water,</v>

401
00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:54.560
<v Speaker 2>you could be making four knots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to swim.</v>

402
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.513
<v Speaker 2>But if you'd get in the freezing cold </v>
<v Speaker 2>water Scotland and you are quite happy </v>

403
00:15:58.491 --> 00:16:01.790
<v Speaker 2>to getting hit in the face by a 10th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you can still make four knots.</v>

404
00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.950
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why so often it became </v>
<v Speaker 2>about something different than swimming.</v>

405
00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.050
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just mental fortitude.</v>

406
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:10.850
<v Speaker 2>It was physical fortitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

407
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>

408
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.430
<v Speaker 2>I always remember actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

409
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.400
<v Speaker 2>First Day of autumn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

410
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:17.510
<v Speaker 2>I got up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was two o'clock,</v>

411
00:16:17.511 --> 00:16:18.200
<v Speaker 2>so it was a night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2:00</v>

412
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.410
<v Speaker 2>AM two o'clock in the morning and I left</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wetsuit out to dry.</v>

413
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:22.303
<v Speaker 2>And I had to scrape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a thin layer of ice off the </v>

414
00:16:25.671 --> 00:16:29.360
<v Speaker 2>wet suit before I could put it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I didn't,</v>

415
00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.910
<v Speaker 2>if I didn't get in and I didn't screw it</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

416
00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:31.850
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way I see it,</v>

417
00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.500
<v Speaker 2>then that would have been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

418
00:16:33.501 --> 00:16:35.900
<v Speaker 2>15 miles potentially that we would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>missed out on.</v>

419
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:36.763
<v Speaker 2>And if you miss those 15 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the window of opportunity to swim </v>

420
00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:42.163
<v Speaker 2>around Great Britain because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>British summer being notoriously </v>

421
00:16:44.031 --> 00:16:46.330
<v Speaker 2>unpredictable and quite short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

422
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:47.623
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't have made it round because </v>
<v Speaker 2>even towards the end there was two </v>

423
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:51.134
<v Speaker 2>storms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a storm elements storm Cali Allien </v>

424
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:54.733
<v Speaker 2>Callum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who kind of stopped us for those two </v>

425
00:16:56.601 --> 00:16:59.450
<v Speaker 2>days where we couldn't swim because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just couldn't swim in a storm.</v>

426
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.430
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you were swimming,</v>

427
00:17:01.431 --> 00:17:03.350
<v Speaker 2>this was all during the summer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

428
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

429
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:04.883
<v Speaker 2>freely the autumn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we finished November the </v>

430
00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:08.510
<v Speaker 2>fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was going into the winter as well.</v>

431
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.360
<v Speaker 2>And you started what month?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

432
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.360
<v Speaker 2>June.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first.</v>

433
00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:12.194
<v Speaker 2>So for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since June you've been swimming </v>

434
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:17.150
<v Speaker 2>basically?</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn,</v>

435
00:17:17.151 --> 00:17:19.520
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>

436
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting too.</v>

437
00:17:21.231 --> 00:17:24.710
<v Speaker 2>You're not built like a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd expect to be doing this.</v>

438
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:25.703
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're building a tank like does not </v>

439
00:17:27.561 --> 00:17:28.394
<v Speaker 2>normal like your big jacked guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look more like an MMA fighter or a </v>

440
00:17:31.811 --> 00:17:33.420
<v Speaker 2>powerlifter even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

441
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:35.540
<v Speaker 2>You don't look like an endurance </v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete.</v>

442
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is,</v>

443
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.390
<v Speaker 2>and we were just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were speaking about it cause I,</v>

444
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:41.100
<v Speaker 2>I love the episode with unct Fletcher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that guy.</v>

445
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.170
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

446
00:17:42.171 --> 00:17:42.930
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

447
00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:43.910
<v Speaker 2>as a big fan of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

448
00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Kathy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>

449
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.660
<v Speaker 2>look at this fucking picture dude.</v>

450
00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.793
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck out of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone said that guys get a swim </v>

451
00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:53.600
<v Speaker 2>around grape Linda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to swim for half an hour and</v>

452
00:17:53.601 --> 00:17:55.900
<v Speaker 2>he's going to have a fucking heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack there.</v>

453
00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:56.901
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

454
00:17:56.901 --> 00:17:58.650
<v Speaker 2>I know I'd probably be inclined to agree</v>
<v Speaker 2>with you.</v>

455
00:17:58.651 --> 00:17:59.484
<v Speaker 2>But what I find interesting is when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>start looking at a strength and stamina </v>

456
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.940
<v Speaker 2>for so often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people believe the two couldn't coexist.</v>

457
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.103
<v Speaker 2>And Robert Hickson and his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his sort of research ran concurrent </v>

458
00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:12.130
<v Speaker 2>training that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

459
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:15.300
<v Speaker 2>basically saying if you train for </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength and stamina,</v>

460
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.590
<v Speaker 2>you dilute the potency of the stimulate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what what I mean by that is if,</v>

461
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went into the gym just now and uh,</v>

462
00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:22.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet me,</v>

463
00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:24.390
<v Speaker 2>you and Jamie walked into the gym and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>

464
00:18:24.391 --> 00:18:24.901
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

465
00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:25.734
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go and see what we're doing on in </v>

466
00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:28.500
<v Speaker 2>the squat rack.</v>

467
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.251
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's strength,</v>

468
00:18:29.251 --> 00:18:30.084
<v Speaker 2>your body's ability to generate force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we trained that and then all of a </v>

469
00:18:31.951 --> 00:18:32.470
<v Speaker 2>sudden it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

470
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.671
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

471
00:18:32.671 --> 00:18:32.881
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

472
00:18:32.881 --> 00:18:35.040
<v Speaker 2>Now let's go over to the rowing machine </v>
<v Speaker 2>or let's go for a swim.</v>

473
00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:35.874
<v Speaker 2>Let's go and swim 10 k.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden our bodies are </v>

474
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:38.581
<v Speaker 2>going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

475
00:18:38.581 --> 00:18:40.920
<v Speaker 2>hang on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which one do you want us to adapt to?</v>

476
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Looking at molecular biology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which one do you want us to adapt to?</v>

477
00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.800
<v Speaker 2>Strength and stamina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

478
00:18:46.801 --> 00:18:48.540
<v Speaker 2>you dilute the potency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stimuli.</v>

479
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:49.703
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the theory that if you separate </v>

480
00:18:51.571 --> 00:18:52.404
<v Speaker 2>them within the laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going off on a little bit of a </v>

481
00:18:54.541 --> 00:18:55.590
<v Speaker 2>tangent here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but please.</v>

482
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:57.900
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good looking at,</v>

483
00:18:57.901 --> 00:18:58.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Verkishanski.</v>

484
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:01.440
<v Speaker 2>So one of the greatest strength and </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditioning coaches to ever exist.</v>

485
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:03.840
<v Speaker 2>He talks about this idea of adaptive </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy,</v>

486
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.900
<v Speaker 2>saying that in any given day you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of adaptive energy and if</v>

487
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:13.320
<v Speaker 2>you are able to fit both a training </v>
<v Speaker 2>session,</v>

488
00:19:13.321 --> 00:19:14.280
<v Speaker 2>that that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

489
00:19:14.281 --> 00:19:16.390
<v Speaker 2>causes your body to adapt to both </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength and stamina.</v>

490
00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:19.200
<v Speaker 2>You separate them under those </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions,</v>

491
00:19:19.201 --> 00:19:22.110
<v Speaker 2>they can coexist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you separated them by how much time?</v>

492
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.110
<v Speaker 2>As much as needed for optimal recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

493
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:25.941
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

494
00:19:25.941 --> 00:19:27.060
<v Speaker 2>if we did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the,</v>

495
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.840
<v Speaker 2>this is what I find fascinating about </v>
<v Speaker 2>mma because you're essentially saying to</v>

496
00:19:30.841 --> 00:19:34.140
<v Speaker 2>an MMA athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need you to be strong fast,</v>

497
00:19:34.141 --> 00:19:36.060
<v Speaker 2>quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need you to be muscular and Jord,</v>

498
00:19:36.061 --> 00:19:38.190
<v Speaker 2>but I also need you to apply a metric </v>
<v Speaker 2>speed,</v>

499
00:19:38.191 --> 00:19:41.360
<v Speaker 2>strength and their body's going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want us to be all of those things.</v>

500
00:19:41.361 --> 00:19:42.240
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

501
00:19:42.241 --> 00:19:43.074
<v Speaker 2>and that's why quite often it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete with a higher work capacity who </v>

502
00:19:45.991 --> 00:19:48.530
<v Speaker 2>can adapt to those looking at like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

503
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.940
<v Speaker 2>the Diaz brothers who just do triathlons</v>
<v Speaker 2>for fun,</v>

504
00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have this insane work capacity.</v>

505
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.033
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body's ability to perform and </v>

506
00:19:57.481 --> 00:20:00.540
<v Speaker 2>positively tolerate training of a given </v>
<v Speaker 2>intensity or duration.</v>

507
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:02.910
<v Speaker 2>So if you have the Diaz brothers and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

508
00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:04.920
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to now do weight training in</v>

509
00:20:04.921 --> 00:20:05.754
<v Speaker 2>the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by the afternoon I also need you to </v>

510
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.750
<v Speaker 2>swim a 10 k their bodies could tolerate </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

511
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:14.090
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you have another athlete who </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps doesn't have that work,</v>

512
00:20:14.091 --> 00:20:14.924
<v Speaker 2>pasty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their body's not going to positively </v>

513
00:20:15.901 --> 00:20:16.960
<v Speaker 2>tolerate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

514
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.440
<v Speaker 2>A person who's used to working out maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>only an hour a day.</v>

515
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:20.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

516
00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:24.060
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's essentially how I would,</v>

517
00:20:24.061 --> 00:20:24.910
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

518
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.020
<v Speaker 2>approach anything like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I found really interesting when</v>

519
00:20:28.021 --> 00:20:28.854
<v Speaker 2>you were talking with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with ct Fletcher was when you look at </v>

520
00:20:32.851 --> 00:20:34.080
<v Speaker 2>strength and stamina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

521
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.930
<v Speaker 2>it's so specific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

522
00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.370
<v Speaker 2>said principle specific adaptation to </v>
<v Speaker 2>impose demands.</v>

523
00:20:38.371 --> 00:20:40.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get good at whatever you continually</v>

524
00:20:40.321 --> 00:20:41.154
<v Speaker 2>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at endurance in </v>

525
00:20:44.641 --> 00:20:45.474
<v Speaker 2>weightbearing sports absolutely know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can argue that that running for </v>

526
00:20:48.731 --> 00:20:49.960
<v Speaker 2>instance is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just,</v>

527
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>power to weight ratio.</v>

528
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:55.450
<v Speaker 2>It's a series of successive jumps and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you start looking at that,</v>

529
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:56.523
<v Speaker 2>there's research that will show adding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we did this with the Royal Marines </v>

530
00:20:58.931 --> 00:20:59.764
<v Speaker 2>back in England.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you just add one keeler of extra </v>

531
00:21:02.051 --> 00:21:05.500
<v Speaker 2>weight in a backpack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's effect on pulmonary ventilation,</v>

532
00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:07.360
<v Speaker 2>lactic threshold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>time to fatigue,</v>

533
00:21:07.361 --> 00:21:08.800
<v Speaker 2>all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just one,</v>

534
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:10.000
<v Speaker 2>one kilogram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

535
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.090
<v Speaker 2>And so that's why when you see tour de </v>
<v Speaker 2>France and people like Chris Froome,</v>

536
00:21:13.091 --> 00:21:16.810
<v Speaker 2>Bradley wiggins unit from team sky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are just looking at the body saying</v>

537
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.340
<v Speaker 2>okay your vo two is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your power to,</v>

538
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.520
<v Speaker 2>your power to weight ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we need to improve.</v>

539
00:21:21.521 --> 00:21:23.410
<v Speaker 2>We need to treat you like a formula one </v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

540
00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.030
<v Speaker 2>We need to take away anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

541
00:21:25.031 --> 00:21:28.190
<v Speaker 2>So when you look at Chris' room in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable athlete and they said,</v>

542
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.490
<v Speaker 2>well you don't need biceps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need triceps.</v>

543
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:33.520
<v Speaker 2>So there we'll remove those controlled </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscular atrophy.</v>

544
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.680
<v Speaker 2>And how do they approach that </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligently?</v>

545
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:39.640
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose looking at anything from,</v>

546
00:21:39.641 --> 00:21:40.474
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a calorie deficits are not to pick </v>

547
00:21:41.451 --> 00:21:43.150
<v Speaker 2>anything up ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of.</v>

548
00:21:43.151 --> 00:21:45.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just exactly,</v>

549
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:47.370
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>

550
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.940
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No triceps.</v>

551
00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:50.320
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they went away.</v>

552
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.390
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean that is,</v>

553
00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.330
<v Speaker 2>that is the perfect example of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

554
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.193
<v Speaker 2>said principle specific adaptation to </v>
<v Speaker 2>impose demands that all he does is he </v>

555
00:21:59.441 --> 00:22:01.780
<v Speaker 2>lives on a bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as a result,</v>

556
00:22:01.781 --> 00:22:02.614
<v Speaker 2>his body is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a byproduct of what he continually </v>

557
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.190
<v Speaker 2>practices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got Bike muscles.</v>

558
00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:07.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

559
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.690
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so looking at that and sorry,</v>

560
00:22:10.691 --> 00:22:13.210
<v Speaker 2>going back to strength and stamina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at running,</v>

561
00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.980
<v Speaker 2>you could argue that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being jacked and,</v>

562
00:22:15.981 --> 00:22:17.620
<v Speaker 2>and being heavier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

563
00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:18.693
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your power to weight ratio is going to </v>

564
00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:21.430
<v Speaker 2>impact you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for instance,</v>

565
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:25.210
<v Speaker 2>I like to run but I don't stand a chance</v>
<v Speaker 2>against some of my friends who are,</v>

566
00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:26.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fell runners and they way,</v>

567
00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 kilos less than me,</v>

568
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.170
<v Speaker 2>however ritual.</v>

569
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:31.650
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

570
00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.670
<v Speaker 2>And lean longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

571
00:22:33.671 --> 00:22:36.280
<v Speaker 2>You look at him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable specimen of a man.</v>

572
00:22:36.281 --> 00:22:36.761
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

573
00:22:36.761 --> 00:22:40.450
<v Speaker 2>you were built for endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as soon as you go in the water,</v>

574
00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:43.810
<v Speaker 2>things might start to change a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit because now it's non weight bearing.</v>

575
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.820
<v Speaker 2>So the power to weight ratio is a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit different.</v>

576
00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:48.730
<v Speaker 2>So then you could not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is all theory for the moment,</v>

577
00:22:48.731 --> 00:22:49.564
<v Speaker 2>but looking at the body shape to swim </v>
<v Speaker 2>around great brim cause no one's ever </v>

578
00:22:52.931 --> 00:22:54.730
<v Speaker 2>done it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can say,</v>

579
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:57.280
<v Speaker 2>okay well what does that body type look </v>
<v Speaker 2>like?</v>

580
00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:00.460
<v Speaker 2>And when writing down a checklist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

581
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:02.650
<v Speaker 2>we need someone who can swim in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

582
00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.050
<v Speaker 2>40 knots of wind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wind over time that we're talking about.</v>

583
00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:07.600
<v Speaker 2>So you're not going to break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on top of that as well.</v>

584
00:23:07.601 --> 00:23:09.190
<v Speaker 2>You can start to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

585
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.580
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden we need someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>never going to take a day off.</v>

586
00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:15.310
<v Speaker 2>So I wasn't sick for out of those 157 </v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

587
00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:18.270
<v Speaker 2>So then you start looking at adaptive </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy and,</v>

588
00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.380
<v Speaker 2>and work capacity there would just spoke</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

589
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:21.873
<v Speaker 2>and then all of a sudden you can start </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting real into the detail of looking </v>

590
00:23:24.101 --> 00:23:24.881
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

591
00:23:24.881 --> 00:23:25.714
<v Speaker 2>someone with a higher muscle mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're able to effectively swim and </v>

592
00:23:29.351 --> 00:23:31.630
<v Speaker 2>the biomechanics are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are on point.</v>

593
00:23:31.631 --> 00:23:32.710
<v Speaker 2>So that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

594
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.200
<v Speaker 2>this muscle mass isn't interfering with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their biomechanics.</v>

595
00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.393
<v Speaker 2>Could it be argued that that's stored </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle glycogen can almost turn them </v>

596
00:23:39.821 --> 00:23:41.680
<v Speaker 2>into a human whale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that.</v>

597
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:42.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

598
00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:44.890
<v Speaker 2>You put me into the pool with Michael </v>
<v Speaker 2>Phelps and he,</v>

599
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.080
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

600
00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.290
<v Speaker 2>he to look at him swim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unbelief.</v>

601
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.630
<v Speaker 2>He looks like a dolphin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful.</v>

602
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.410
<v Speaker 2>But when it comes to something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>seminar in Great Britain,</v>

603
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:56.870
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just an eating competition,</v>

604
00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:57.733
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a little bit of swimming involved </v>

605
00:23:58.551 --> 00:24:01.190
<v Speaker 2>and you just need to make sure you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>break.</v>

606
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:04.190
<v Speaker 2>And that goes back to the tides as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body working with ties.</v>

607
00:24:04.191 --> 00:24:08.360
<v Speaker 2>If you can just keep getting in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water for 157 days,</v>

608
00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:12.240
<v Speaker 2>12 hours a day and not break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll make it wound Great Britain by.</v>

609
00:24:12.241 --> 00:24:14.990
<v Speaker 2>So you think the muscle mass aids you in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that way?</v>

610
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.000
<v Speaker 2>I would argue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

611
00:24:17.001 --> 00:24:17.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

612
00:24:17.661 --> 00:24:18.494
<v Speaker 2>and this is purely anecdotal and I'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>love to actually do more research into </v>

613
00:24:20.841 --> 00:24:21.230
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

614
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.063
<v Speaker 2>but certainly with a lot of athletes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I train with that it's almost like </v>

615
00:24:25.251 --> 00:24:27.500
<v Speaker 2>a bell curve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you can imagine,</v>

616
00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:28.363
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for those listening like a bell curve </v>

617
00:24:30.861 --> 00:24:32.090
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would you describe that?</v>

618
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Just to sort of like a horseshoe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

619
00:24:34.851 --> 00:24:35.684
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can argue that here around </v>

620
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:37.993
<v Speaker 2>endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you've got somebody who's you </v>

621
00:24:39.681 --> 00:24:40.550
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use rich rituals,</v>

622
00:24:40.551 --> 00:24:41.900
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an amazing swimmer,</v>

623
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.943
<v Speaker 2>the over 10 K he's going to be amazing </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's efficiency in </v>

624
00:24:45.081 --> 00:24:45.320
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

625
00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.153
<v Speaker 2>But then pass this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when we start looking at the mileage </v>

626
00:24:48.351 --> 00:24:51.290
<v Speaker 2>that we were covering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it sort of English Channel Swim is 20</v>

627
00:24:51.291 --> 00:24:54.050
<v Speaker 2>miles plus a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At this point,</v>

628
00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.213
<v Speaker 2>this leaner swimmer's going to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>running out of muscle glycogen is </v>

629
00:24:57.681 --> 00:24:58.514
<v Speaker 2>biomechanics might break down because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have the strength to hold that </v>

630
00:25:01.161 --> 00:25:03.410
<v Speaker 2>position continually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of those things,</v>

631
00:25:03.411 --> 00:25:04.244
<v Speaker 2>the waves start crashing and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>starting to swimming to 40 knots of </v>

632
00:25:06.111 --> 00:25:07.730
<v Speaker 2>wind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going to happen?</v>

633
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.570
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you favor the,</v>

634
00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:10.573
<v Speaker 2>the lean a quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more streamlined swimmer or would you </v>

635
00:25:13.041 --> 00:25:16.610
<v Speaker 2>argue that the guy who have more muscle </v>
<v Speaker 2>mass here is going to continue to swim?</v>

636
00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.390
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily at the same pace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but would continue not to break?</v>

637
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:23.450
<v Speaker 2>I think it depends on who the man with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the muscle mass is.</v>

638
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:28.040
<v Speaker 2>Because a lot of guys with muscle mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got that muscle mass are doing very</v>

639
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.050
<v Speaker 2>low reps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high weight.</v>

640
00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:31.453
<v Speaker 2>I mean what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of exercise do you do that </v>

641
00:25:32.481 --> 00:25:34.970
<v Speaker 2>gives you a bill like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>See and that's a good point.</v>

642
00:25:34.971 --> 00:25:38.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean I loved what you did with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Dorian Yates and um,</v>

643
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:39.673
<v Speaker 2>I think when you start looking at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the three mechanisms to build muscular </v>

644
00:25:43.011 --> 00:25:46.580
<v Speaker 2>hypertrophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start looking at metabolic stress.</v>

645
00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.730
<v Speaker 2>So metabolic stress being exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just said.</v>

646
00:25:49.731 --> 00:25:52.220
<v Speaker 2>Lots and lots of reps during yes being a</v>
<v Speaker 2>great example of that.</v>

647
00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.293
<v Speaker 2>That is more muscular hypertrophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bodybuilding centric work and that's </v>

648
00:25:56.691 --> 00:25:58.460
<v Speaker 2>metabolic stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots and lots of reps.</v>

649
00:25:58.970 --> 00:25:59.803
<v Speaker 2>But then you can also look at mechanical</v>
<v Speaker 2>tension to that's more your power </v>

650
00:26:02.451 --> 00:26:03.950
<v Speaker 2>lifters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

651
00:26:03.951 --> 00:26:05.000
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really high weight,</v>

652
00:26:05.001 --> 00:26:06.470
<v Speaker 2>lower volume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just real strength.</v>

653
00:26:06.471 --> 00:26:09.620
<v Speaker 2>Your body's ability to generate force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is what I do.</v>

654
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yes,</v>

655
00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:14.270
<v Speaker 2>it's shown to induce muscular </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypertrophy is to increase muscle mass,</v>

656
00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.340
<v Speaker 2>but arguably more functional than when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be looking at a,</v>

657
00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:20.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bodybuilding,</v>

658
00:26:20.301 --> 00:26:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Mr Olympia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

659
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:25.620
<v Speaker 2>And then you have a muscle damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has more eccentric contraction,</v>

660
00:26:25.621 --> 00:26:30.621
<v Speaker 2>some more arguably sort of crossfit a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodybuilder to achieve their physique.</v>

661
00:26:30.771 --> 00:26:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Besides using steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to use lots of repetitions.</v>

662
00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

663
00:26:36.471 --> 00:26:37.430
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

664
00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.980
<v Speaker 2>so when you say what do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I specifically use,</v>

665
00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 2>it's more mechanical tension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So more power cleans,</v>

666
00:26:44.011 --> 00:26:45.540
<v Speaker 2>deadlifts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things along those lines.</v>

667
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:46.470
<v Speaker 2>He's exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

668
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:47.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

669
00:26:47.461 --> 00:26:49.180
<v Speaker 2>Cause you're not billing a bodybuilder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>

670
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:51.090
<v Speaker 2>you're built like someone was very </v>
<v Speaker 2>strong.</v>

671
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's it where you start.</v>

672
00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:54.930
<v Speaker 2>And that's not to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

673
00:26:54.931 --> 00:26:56.110
<v Speaker 2>when you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

674
00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:59.010
<v Speaker 2>to use you as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we had you in the sports lab,</v>

675
00:26:59.280 --> 00:26:59.881
<v Speaker 2>we would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

676
00:26:59.881 --> 00:27:03.000
<v Speaker 2>what is your strength deficits?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your strength deficit is,</v>

677
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:06.720
<v Speaker 2>is I say we had you on the leg press and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we said,</v>

678
00:27:06.721 --> 00:27:07.554
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to,</v>

679
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:11.610
<v Speaker 2>we want to look at how much force your </v>
<v Speaker 2>legs can generate with you.</v>

680
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:16.610
<v Speaker 2>Just using basically your training </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength training strength is defined as</v>

681
00:27:16.741 --> 00:27:19.590
<v Speaker 2>the strength that you would use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just leg pressing,</v>

682
00:27:19.591 --> 00:27:23.040
<v Speaker 2>not getting you all like to cite of </v>
<v Speaker 2>preworkouts smelling salts,</v>

683
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:23.903
<v Speaker 2>none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would just say Joe gun leg press and </v>

684
00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:28.380
<v Speaker 2>you'd just leg press and that's what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can generate there.</v>

685
00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.900
<v Speaker 2>But then in the sports I back it left </v>
<v Speaker 2>for university,</v>

686
00:27:30.901 --> 00:27:32.190
<v Speaker 2>we would start using,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

687
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.670
<v Speaker 2>basically a lecture basically using </v>
<v Speaker 2>electrical impulses to,</v>

688
00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:41.700
<v Speaker 2>to make the muscles contract beyond what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could generate yourself.</v>

689
00:27:41.701 --> 00:27:42.534
<v Speaker 2>So that is what your body could generate</v>
<v Speaker 2>without you trying to send those </v>

690
00:27:45.121 --> 00:27:45.810
<v Speaker 2>impulses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buddies,</v>

691
00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:48.750
<v Speaker 2>you the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual potential muscle,</v>

692
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.540
<v Speaker 2>the strength of the muscles themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you determine that?</v>

693
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>

694
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:54.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lecture,</v>

695
00:27:54.781 --> 00:27:55.614
<v Speaker 2>cheating their muscles and stimulating </v>
<v Speaker 2>it in voluntarily and through that they </v>

696
00:27:59.251 --> 00:28:01.040
<v Speaker 2>measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>

697
00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:02.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then that measures your,</v>

698
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:03.663
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your maximum output with you not trying </v>

699
00:28:05.431 --> 00:28:06.150
<v Speaker 2>to use it yourself.</v>

700
00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:06.983
<v Speaker 2>It's involuntary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that is something that you wouldn't </v>

701
00:28:08.551 --> 00:28:10.800
<v Speaker 2>have control over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they,</v>

702
00:28:10.801 --> 00:28:14.490
<v Speaker 2>how do they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like essentially electricity cheap.</v>

703
00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.070
<v Speaker 2>What kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does it like electrodes and slap on</v>

704
00:28:17.071 --> 00:28:19.470
<v Speaker 2>your legs and they force you to extend </v>
<v Speaker 2>your legs.</v>

705
00:28:19.471 --> 00:28:20.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would have seen it.</v>

706
00:28:20.521 --> 00:28:21.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

707
00:28:21.271 --> 00:28:23.430
<v Speaker 2>That you lift a weight with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

708
00:28:23.431 --> 00:28:24.600
<v Speaker 2>You can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

709
00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:26.430
<v Speaker 2>So that's what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

710
00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:27.383
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard of such a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would be sitting in a leg press </v>

711
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:34.890
<v Speaker 2>or engineering quad extensions and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and make your legs extend.</v>

712
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.753
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

713
00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:38.190
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they would monitor your strengths.</v>

714
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:41.100
<v Speaker 2>So the difference between that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so all of a sudden they'll say,</v>

715
00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:42.270
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this over here,</v>

716
00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.550
<v Speaker 2>go training strength is what you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

717
00:28:44.551 --> 00:28:45.570
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was just saying,</v>

718
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.770
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lift that right.</v>

719
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:48.000
<v Speaker 2>And it's what you were going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

720
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:48.780
<v Speaker 2>I'll lift it.</v>

721
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:51.270
<v Speaker 2>And then over here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it's involuntary,</v>

722
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:56.400
<v Speaker 2>that is what you could actually do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the potential of the muscles.</v>

723
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:58.470
<v Speaker 2>What's usually the higher number?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

724
00:28:58.471 --> 00:28:59.220
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

725
00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.930
<v Speaker 2>so it's always involuntary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

726
00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:01.741
<v Speaker 2>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

727
00:29:01.741 --> 00:29:02.281
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

728
00:29:02.281 --> 00:29:04.830
<v Speaker 2>How much what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the strength deficits.</v>

729
00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:05.940
<v Speaker 2>So do you see what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

730
00:29:05.941 --> 00:29:07.110
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so over here,</v>

731
00:29:07.111 --> 00:29:08.730
<v Speaker 2>this is what you could generate when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just going,</v>

732
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:09.421
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

733
00:29:09.421 --> 00:29:10.740
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three and I'm lifting it myself.</v>

734
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:11.371
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

735
00:29:11.371 --> 00:29:12.204
<v Speaker 2>That done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And over here is what we do when it's </v>

736
00:29:13.711 --> 00:29:16.980
<v Speaker 2>involuntary now and if there's a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>deficit,</v>

737
00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:19.230
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if there's a huge deficit between the</v>

738
00:29:19.231 --> 00:29:20.460
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means you're a pussy.</v>

739
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.610
<v Speaker 2>It means your worth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

740
00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:29.190
<v Speaker 2>it means if there's a large deficit </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the two,</v>

741
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.850
<v Speaker 2>it means that you have muscle mass but </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not fully using it.</v>

742
00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.760
<v Speaker 2>So you might see a large deficit between</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two.</v>

743
00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:37.270
<v Speaker 2>If you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

744
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:38.143
<v Speaker 2>a bodybuilder for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause they've got a lot of muscle mass </v>

745
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.280
<v Speaker 2>but they're not using,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that make sense?</v>

746
00:29:42.281 --> 00:29:44.800
<v Speaker 2>So why aren't they using it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's,</v>

747
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:47.980
<v Speaker 2>it's strength is functional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they've got all this muscle mass,</v>

748
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:49.053
<v Speaker 2>but they're not recruiting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've not actually trained strength </v>

749
00:29:51.071 --> 00:29:51.904
<v Speaker 2>because strength is neuro muscular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when a bodybuilder does like high </v>

750
00:29:54.911 --> 00:29:55.744
<v Speaker 2>repetitions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what was the type of load that you </v>

751
00:29:57.881 --> 00:29:58.980
<v Speaker 2>were calling that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How they were,</v>

752
00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:03.550
<v Speaker 2>that was causing hypertrophy range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's metabolic stress,</v>

753
00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:07.090
<v Speaker 2>metabolic stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just a sheer number of sets.</v>

754
00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:07.953
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just constant repetitions over and over </v>

755
00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:12.850
<v Speaker 2>and over again with not that high await.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

756
00:30:12.851 --> 00:30:13.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's meant about,</v>

757
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:16.560
<v Speaker 2>but then mechanical tension is when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

758
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.433
<v Speaker 2>it's more powerlifting us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's your difference between the </v>

759
00:30:19.511 --> 00:30:22.030
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the reason being is met.</v>

760
00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.093
<v Speaker 2>So when you start looking at mechanical </v>
<v Speaker 2>tension that might produce an athlete </v>

761
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.320
<v Speaker 2>who has a smaller strength deficit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

762
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:31.630
<v Speaker 2>So when again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>using you as an example,</v>

763
00:30:31.631 --> 00:30:32.464
<v Speaker 2>if there was a smaller strength deficit </v>
<v Speaker 2>between what you could voluntarily leg </v>

764
00:30:38.021 --> 00:30:39.970
<v Speaker 2>press in a leg extension after </v>
<v Speaker 2>extension,</v>

765
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.880
<v Speaker 2>and then involuntary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a smaller deficit,</v>

766
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:45.610
<v Speaker 2>it would like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have likened it to,</v>

767
00:30:45.611 --> 00:30:46.061
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

768
00:30:46.061 --> 00:30:46.894
<v Speaker 2>you have this much muscle mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're using a lot of your </v>

769
00:30:49.001 --> 00:30:50.770
<v Speaker 2>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're using it already.</v>

770
00:30:50.771 --> 00:30:55.300
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like you've got a formula </v>
<v Speaker 2>one car with a huge engine,</v>

771
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.940
<v Speaker 2>but you're using it to its full extent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

772
00:30:57.941 --> 00:30:58.774
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is why I'm going off on a </v>

773
00:31:00.041 --> 00:31:00.874
<v Speaker 2>slight tangent here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is why when you start looking </v>

774
00:31:02.441 --> 00:31:03.274
<v Speaker 2>at bodybuilding centric work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this idea of increasing muscular </v>

775
00:31:06.161 --> 00:31:06.994
<v Speaker 2>hypertrophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be a good thing when you </v>

776
00:31:08.921 --> 00:31:13.921
<v Speaker 2>understand that strength deficit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you might have an athlete who you go,</v>

777
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.090
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a small strength deficits,</v>

778
00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:16.953
<v Speaker 2>very small.</v>

779
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.823
<v Speaker 2>So for the muscle mass that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're using it to its absolute full </v>

780
00:31:21.281 --> 00:31:22.114
<v Speaker 2>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have a very small car but </v>

781
00:31:24.191 --> 00:31:25.024
<v Speaker 2>you are just pushing down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>accelerator so hard and it can't go </v>

782
00:31:27.371 --> 00:31:28.780
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just red line.</v>

783
00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:29.763
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the option that we have is to </v>

784
00:31:31.241 --> 00:31:32.074
<v Speaker 2>increase the size of the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The option we have is increased the </v>

785
00:31:33.671 --> 00:31:34.540
<v Speaker 2>size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your muscle mass.</v>

786
00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.430
<v Speaker 2>In some sense it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

787
00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:37.980
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

788
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.033
<v Speaker 2>what kind of training were you doing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>increase your capacity for work while </v>

789
00:31:43.841 --> 00:31:45.700
<v Speaker 2>maintaining the mass?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

790
00:31:45.701 --> 00:31:46.534
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's that is a bit of a strange </v>

791
00:31:48.071 --> 00:31:48.904
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this goes back to something I always </v>

792
00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:50.920
<v Speaker 2>call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

793
00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horsepower programming,</v>

794
00:31:52.331 --> 00:31:54.760
<v Speaker 2>which I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so often lost now.</v>

795
00:31:54.761 --> 00:31:55.594
<v Speaker 2>I think training is very specific when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to the gym or you're </v>

796
00:31:57.581 --> 00:31:58.450
<v Speaker 2>training for strength,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speed,</v>

797
00:31:58.451 --> 00:31:59.230
<v Speaker 2>stamina.</v>

798
00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:04.110
<v Speaker 2>Whereas horsepower programming I almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>borrowed from Soviet Union principles,</v>

799
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:07.480
<v Speaker 2>you start looking at a general physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>preparedness as it was,</v>

800
00:32:07.481 --> 00:32:08.314
<v Speaker 2>as it was known.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is this just idea of you take </v>

801
00:32:11.051 --> 00:32:11.884
<v Speaker 2>an athlete's only a younger athlete and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to increase their work </v>

802
00:32:15.041 --> 00:32:18.760
<v Speaker 2>capacity by nonspecific movements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'll get at,</v>

803
00:32:18.761 --> 00:32:20.840
<v Speaker 2>you're an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're handed you a magic,</v>

804
00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:22.240
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're young,</v>

805
00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:25.930
<v Speaker 2>a kid just growing up and your parents </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand you to me,</v>

806
00:32:25.931 --> 00:32:26.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm your coach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I say,</v>

807
00:32:26.891 --> 00:32:27.724
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if Joe's going to be big </v>

808
00:32:29.711 --> 00:32:30.544
<v Speaker 2>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's gonna be able to </v>

809
00:32:31.271 --> 00:32:33.190
<v Speaker 2>run far or fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

810
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:34.440
<v Speaker 2>So what we're going to do is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>create,</v>

811
00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:38.230
<v Speaker 2>increase your sort of neuromuscular </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficiency and work capacity.</v>

812
00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:40.190
<v Speaker 2>And so by doing</v>

813
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:41.900
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of jumps,</v>

814
00:32:41.901 --> 00:32:45.140
<v Speaker 3>throws nonspecific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these natural movement patterns,</v>

815
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.210
<v Speaker 3>and we get you to do lots and lots of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

816
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:48.643
<v Speaker 3>What that's doing is work capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body's ability to positively </v>

817
00:32:51.351 --> 00:32:53.510
<v Speaker 3>tolerate training and given an intensity</v>
<v Speaker 3>or duration.</v>

818
00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:58.160
<v Speaker 3>And I think from the great British swim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when a lot of people will say,</v>

819
00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:01.520
<v Speaker 3>how was it that you are able to tolerate</v>
<v Speaker 3>those 12 hours a day?</v>

820
00:33:01.521 --> 00:33:05.000
<v Speaker 3>The jellyfish things and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It it for me,</v>

821
00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.070
<v Speaker 3>one of the biggest things was going back</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

822
00:33:07.071 --> 00:33:09.050
<v Speaker 3>and this is gonna sound so odd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I um,</v>

823
00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.420
<v Speaker 3>I ran a marathon pulling a car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

824
00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.580
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three years ago I think now.</v>

825
00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:14.503
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so that is almost the perfect </v>

826
00:33:16.341 --> 00:33:19.400
<v Speaker 3>embodiment of horsepower programming in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

827
00:33:19.401 --> 00:33:22.880
<v Speaker 3>that shear stress on the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's not a specific skill.</v>

828
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:25.070
<v Speaker 3>When you say you run a marathon behind a</v>
<v Speaker 3>car,</v>

829
00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:27.230
<v Speaker 3>pulling a car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulling a car,</v>

830
00:33:27.290 --> 00:33:28.550
<v Speaker 3>pulling out in front of a car.</v>

831
00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:29.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not behind a car.</v>

832
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:30.621
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

833
00:33:30.621 --> 00:33:33.470
<v Speaker 3>So it was um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you pull the car and ran a marathon.</v>

834
00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:38.680
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck do they said?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

835
00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:43.190
<v Speaker 3>I seem so normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's so confusing to me.</v>

836
00:33:43.191 --> 00:33:44.024
<v Speaker 3>Like if I met you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something about a lot of these </v>

837
00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:48.500
<v Speaker 3>endurance people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well how,</v>

838
00:33:48.501 --> 00:33:50.900
<v Speaker 3>I guess not Courtney Courtney door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Walter,</v>

839
00:33:50.901 --> 00:33:55.901
<v Speaker 3>she's so carefree and silly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your very loose and relaxed.</v>

840
00:33:55.911 --> 00:33:58.190
<v Speaker 3>I always considered like those people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are dark.</v>

841
00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:01.640
<v Speaker 3>There's some darkness to those extreme </v>
<v Speaker 3>endurance athletes.</v>

842
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:02.563
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's darkness that they're running </v>

843
00:34:04.431 --> 00:34:06.800
<v Speaker 3>from some darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

844
00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:07.970
<v Speaker 3>Now I do,</v>

845
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:11.490
<v Speaker 2>I've had this conversation with a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>people cause they said something similar</v>

846
00:34:11.491 --> 00:34:12.690
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

847
00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:13.681
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

848
00:34:13.681 --> 00:34:14.514
<v Speaker 2>to slightly go off on another tangent </v>
<v Speaker 2>here cause I think we've covered the </v>

849
00:34:16.261 --> 00:34:18.990
<v Speaker 2>physical aspect and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and work capacity,</v>

850
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:20.130
<v Speaker 2>the which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I've addressed.</v>

851
00:34:20.131 --> 00:34:20.964
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is one thing I genuine just </v>

852
00:34:23.221 --> 00:34:25.830
<v Speaker 2>wanting to almost quiz you on and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>your thoughts on this is uh,</v>

853
00:34:26.490 --> 00:34:28.980
<v Speaker 2>certainly the Frat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great British swim,</v>

854
00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:34.410
<v Speaker 2>it subjected my body to a fatigue like </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never experienced before.</v>

855
00:34:34.411 --> 00:34:37.620
<v Speaker 2>It was just yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep deprivation,</v>

856
00:34:37.621 --> 00:34:39.750
<v Speaker 2>just ligaments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tendons in my shoulders.</v>

857
00:34:39.751 --> 00:34:41.490
<v Speaker 2>Just wondering what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

858
00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:43.570
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your most developer,</v>

859
00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:44.663
<v Speaker 2>a split personality in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's times when I would quite often </v>

860
00:34:48.331 --> 00:34:50.790
<v Speaker 2>say you need to swim with a smile </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

861
00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.713
<v Speaker 2>it's 157 days if you're stressed or it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a marathon where you grit your </v>

862
00:34:55.081 --> 00:34:56.430
<v Speaker 2>teeth and you try and get through it.</v>

863
00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're very aware that,</v>

864
00:34:58.370 --> 00:34:59.203
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the body is this complex biochemical </v>

865
00:35:00.481 --> 00:35:02.520
<v Speaker 2>organism and if you're stressed cortisol</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels,</v>

866
00:35:02.521 --> 00:35:04.170
<v Speaker 2>spike inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your immune system,</v>

867
00:35:04.171 --> 00:35:06.090
<v Speaker 2>everything's affected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for me,</v>

868
00:35:06.091 --> 00:35:09.330
<v Speaker 2>I was treating it not like a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to treat it,</v>

869
00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:11.580
<v Speaker 2>swim with a smile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

870
00:35:11.581 --> 00:35:13.740
<v Speaker 2>think this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is life now.</v>

871
00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:14.603
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

872
00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then equally there were times when,</v>

873
00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't swim with a smile.</v>

874
00:35:20.191 --> 00:35:21.510
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

875
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:23.340
<v Speaker 2>Korea vet can be being a great example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

876
00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.050
<v Speaker 2>I sent him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't all that happy then.</v>

877
00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:27.090
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for me,</v>

878
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:30.810
<v Speaker 2>it's those times when I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to just get feral.</v>

879
00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:31.943
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've really just got to a good friend </v>

880
00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:33.870
<v Speaker 2>of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

881
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:35.340
<v Speaker 2>back in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in England,</v>

882
00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ses trained,</v>

883
00:35:37.711 --> 00:35:38.610
<v Speaker 2>and he said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ross,</v>

884
00:35:38.611 --> 00:35:40.560
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really nice guy and everything,</v>

885
00:35:40.561 --> 00:35:42.210
<v Speaker 2>but there's gonna be times when you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to,</v>

886
00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:45.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no smiles and just get feral.</v>

887
00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I thinking about it an end,</v>

888
00:35:48.421 --> 00:35:51.960
<v Speaker 2>cause I had 12 hours to think at bay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was mulling this over in my head.</v>

889
00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

890
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.880
<v Speaker 2>it goes back to Tim noakes central </v>
<v Speaker 2>governor theory.</v>

891
00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at how fatigue is,</v>

892
00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:00.324
<v Speaker 2>it is an emotionally driven state that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we use to pull that physiological </v>

893
00:36:02.731 --> 00:36:03.630
<v Speaker 2>handbrake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

894
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.261
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

895
00:36:04.261 --> 00:36:06.690
<v Speaker 2>for those listening sorta 60 miles into </v>
<v Speaker 2>a marathon,</v>

896
00:36:06.691 --> 00:36:08.220
<v Speaker 2>you might be saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no way,</v>

897
00:36:08.221 --> 00:36:09.650
<v Speaker 2>I can't keep putting one foot in front </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>

898
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:10.503
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden 25 miles in </v>

899
00:36:12.661 --> 00:36:13.494
<v Speaker 2>your family and friends are clapping you</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you get that second wind and you </v>

900
00:36:16.021 --> 00:36:17.640
<v Speaker 2>start sprinting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

901
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:20.400
<v Speaker 2>and for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at that,</v>

902
00:36:20.401 --> 00:36:25.401
<v Speaker 2>this sort of central governor theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found that in complete exhaustion,</v>

903
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:28.260
<v Speaker 2>like when when you absolutely have </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing left,</v>

904
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.870
<v Speaker 2>you almost go into this feral state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

905
00:36:30.871 --> 00:36:31.560
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

906
00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.600
<v Speaker 2>like an like an injured dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

907
00:36:33.601 --> 00:36:35.640
<v Speaker 2>where a lot of people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

908
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.533
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember why you started to think of </v>

909
00:36:37.201 --> 00:36:38.340
<v Speaker 2>your family and friends.</v>

910
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:39.241
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

911
00:36:39.241 --> 00:36:39.600
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

912
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.470
<v Speaker 2>I was at a level of fatigue where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't thinking about,</v>

913
00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:44.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>family and friends.</v>

914
00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.380
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking almost,</v>

915
00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maslow's hierarchy of needs,</v>

916
00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:51.450
<v Speaker 2>where it starts with just food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shelter,</v>

917
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:52.343
<v Speaker 2>oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at that sort of level where there </v>

918
00:36:55.411 --> 00:36:57.240
<v Speaker 2>was clcs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

919
00:36:57.241 --> 00:36:59.340
<v Speaker 2>my next kind of healed now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

920
00:36:59.341 --> 00:37:02.260
<v Speaker 2>there was times when chafing on my neck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

921
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.560
<v Speaker 2>my tongue was falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fine now by the way,</v>

922
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:07.650
<v Speaker 2>Jay Thomas fire part my tongue from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>salt,</v>

923
00:37:07.651 --> 00:37:09.120
<v Speaker 2>salt water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

924
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:10.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

925
00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:13.320
<v Speaker 2>and falling apart on the house or it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it's called,</v>

926
00:37:13.321 --> 00:37:14.154
<v Speaker 2>salt tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And after 12 hours in the water every </v>

927
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:17.603
<v Speaker 2>single day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

928
00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:18.483
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your tongue would essentially start to </v>

929
00:37:19.291 --> 00:37:21.160
<v Speaker 2>disintegrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Jesus,</v>

930
00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.013
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

931
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.573
<v Speaker 2>So I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I woke up and there was parts of my </v>

932
00:37:25.111 --> 00:37:28.920
<v Speaker 2>tongue on my pillow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

933
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:29.843
<v Speaker 2>is there any concern of this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>permanent or it was prominent at the </v>

934
00:37:32.221 --> 00:37:32.610
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>

935
00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:34.200
<v Speaker 2>Were you concerned?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

936
00:37:34.201 --> 00:37:38.610
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what goes back to that,</v>

937
00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:39.773
<v Speaker 2>that hierarchy of needs where you're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about family and friends or </v>

938
00:37:42.301 --> 00:37:44.250
<v Speaker 2>what motivates you and what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

939
00:37:44.251 --> 00:37:46.320
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to keep my tongue.</v>

940
00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:47.283
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

941
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.240
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because no one has really,</v>

942
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:54.000
<v Speaker 2>has people have gone on long swims </v>
<v Speaker 2>before?</v>

943
00:37:54.001 --> 00:37:57.450
<v Speaker 2>But has anybody done six months?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

944
00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:59.160
<v Speaker 2>There there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's Ben La,</v>

945
00:37:59.161 --> 00:37:59.994
<v Speaker 2>compton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moment who's going across the </v>

946
00:38:00.481 --> 00:38:03.660
<v Speaker 2>Pacific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he is using a snorkel.</v>

947
00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:06.750
<v Speaker 2>So he kind of cleverly thought about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

948
00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:08.310
<v Speaker 2>Whereas for me I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

949
00:38:08.311 --> 00:38:12.030
<v Speaker 2>this has to be done without properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where you thinking about the guy who was</v>

950
00:38:12.031 --> 00:38:14.910
<v Speaker 2>just doing the restaurant and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if he did it,</v>

951
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:17.100
<v Speaker 2>fuck get done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well and this is it.</v>

952
00:38:17.101 --> 00:38:19.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was wow.</v>

953
00:38:19.201 --> 00:38:22.080
<v Speaker 2>So yes and no that and it was at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>point that I think,</v>

954
00:38:22.081 --> 00:38:24.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you what you are feral,</v>

<v Speaker 2>one arm in front of the other.</v>

956
00:38:28.681 --> 00:38:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep moving.</v>

957
00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:30.773
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That you are soldier pieces of your </v>

958
00:38:32.821 --> 00:38:33.654
<v Speaker 2>tongue.</v>

959
00:38:35.591 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 2>of your tongue.</v>

960
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.320
<v Speaker 4>We're falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

961
00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:42.860
<v Speaker 4>The fact of salt buildup on the tongue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is on Ross's instagram was,</v>

962
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:47.410

<v Speaker 4>Y.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I put it up on my instagram too.</v>

966
00:38:49.391 --> 00:38:51.910
<v Speaker 4>I re retweeted or reposted one of your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

967
00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:54.640
<v Speaker 4>things to let people know about this.</v>

968
00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:57.030
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is so nasty,</v>

969
00:38:57.031 --> 00:38:59.370
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see the taste buds on it.</v>

970
00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.190
<v Speaker 3>That's how so was it fucking with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>taste buds?</v>

971
00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.270
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

972
00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:05.120
<v Speaker 3>The way you tasted things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

973
00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:08.100
<v Speaker 3>And that started to have an impact on </v>
<v Speaker 3>you need the food as well.</v>

974
00:39:08.101 --> 00:39:10.800
<v Speaker 3>Cause I mean like Granola,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was eating so much granola,</v>

975
00:39:10.801 --> 00:39:15.110
<v Speaker 3>but when that happened it's like rubbing</v>
<v Speaker 3>sandpaper on an icon.</v>

976
00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:15.871
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

977
00:39:15.871 --> 00:39:18.480
<v Speaker 3>He's the grit and the the oats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

978
00:39:18.481 --> 00:39:21.300
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was how we had to just adapt on</v>

979
00:39:21.301 --> 00:39:22.590
<v Speaker 3>the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's during that,</v>

980
00:39:22.591 --> 00:39:23.424
<v Speaker 3>that video is great actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was in the cabin and I </v>

981
00:39:25.231 --> 00:39:27.480
<v Speaker 3>remember just thinking like now I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

982
00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>family and friends to,</v>

983
00:39:28.751 --> 00:39:30.990
<v Speaker 3>to talk about those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you just said,</v>

984
00:39:30.991 --> 00:39:32.580
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those darker moments.</v>

985
00:39:32.581 --> 00:39:35.280
<v Speaker 3>I think now it's very easy for me to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>very grateful.</v>

986
00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm warm sitting in the studio view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

987
00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:41.090
<v Speaker 3>there's no jellyfish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's times that where,</v>

988
00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:43.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was dark with my neck as well.</v>

989
00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:46.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean my neck was bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we didn't actually catch that.</v>

990
00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:47.423
<v Speaker 3>The moment was probably the worst on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that where I went to bed with this open </v>

991
00:39:51.061 --> 00:39:53.010
<v Speaker 3>wound from the wetsuit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chafing basically.</v>

992
00:39:53.011 --> 00:39:53.760
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

993
00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.180
<v Speaker 3>as I woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bedsheet had fused to my neck.</v>

994
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:59.620
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just had to rip it off,</v>

995
00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:03.450
<v Speaker 3>put it on the pus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

996
00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:08.163
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you had to get in that salt </v>

997
00:40:09.101 --> 00:40:10.370
<v Speaker 4>water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was the felt great.</v>

998
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.330
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

999
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:15.350
<v Speaker 4>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was it like when you finished?</v>

1000
00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.830
<v Speaker 4>What did it feel like when the last </v>
<v Speaker 4>stroke,</v>

1001
00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:21.380
<v Speaker 4>what did you got out of the water and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

1002
00:40:21.381 --> 00:40:24.500
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just swam for six months.</v>

1003
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:25.300
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1004
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:26.133
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was so strange because when we left </v>

1005
00:40:27.161 --> 00:40:29.590
<v Speaker 3>in June,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we came back obviously to the same point</v>

1006
00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:33.360
<v Speaker 3>and we left in the British summer and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone was on the beach and,</v>

1007
00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.433
<v Speaker 3>and then our came back round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are putting up Christmas </v>

1008
00:40:35.831 --> 00:40:40.480
<v Speaker 3>decorations and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had been gone for so long at sea.</v>

1009
00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:45.550
<v Speaker 3>It was just so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many days was it a total?</v>

1010
00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:48.030
<v Speaker 3>157.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It just is so much change in,</v>

1012
00:40:51.131 --> 00:40:51.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1018
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:07.450

<v Speaker 5>mile race through the mobile APP </v>
<v Speaker 5>mountains.</v>

1051
00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.030
<v Speaker 5>And it's just an insane race.</v>

1052
00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:36.913
<v Speaker 5>Not only did she win it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she wanted it by more than 10 hours </v>

1053
00:42:39.731 --> 00:42:44.080
<v Speaker 5>ahead of the second place guy when she's</v>
<v Speaker 5>just a fucking straight savage.</v>

1054
00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:48.730
<v Speaker 5>So she recently entered a race and she </v>
<v Speaker 5>came in second place and this race,</v>

1055
00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.863
<v Speaker 5>they would run for four miles in an hour</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they would stop when the hour </v>

1056
00:42:54.971 --> 00:42:55.804
<v Speaker 5>was over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would stop and then when the next </v>

1057
00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:00.700
<v Speaker 5>hour started,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would run another four miles,</v>

1058
00:43:00.701 --> 00:43:03.910
<v Speaker 5>like four point something miles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they do it for six days.</v>

1059
00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:05.343
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They did is still like the last man </v>

1060
00:43:06.401 --> 00:43:08.860
<v Speaker 5>standing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then at the very end,</v>

1061
00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:10.540
<v Speaker 5>one person one like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

1062
00:43:10.541 --> 00:43:14.260
<v Speaker 5>who's going to drop out last?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they just kept doing it.</v>

1063
00:43:14.261 --> 00:43:17.690
<v Speaker 5>So the guy who created this race,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see if you can find anything on this guy</v>

1064
00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:18.593
<v Speaker 5>because he's apparently very sadistic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And his idea was that people run these </v>

1065
00:43:22.691 --> 00:43:26.530
<v Speaker 5>100 mile races or a 50 mile race and if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you just finish,</v>

1066
00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:28.180
<v Speaker 5>you feel like a winner.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>

1067
00:43:28.181 --> 00:43:29.440
<v Speaker 5>well bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1068
00:43:29.441 --> 00:43:30.274
<v Speaker 5>there can't be a winner if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if somebody comes in first place and </v>

1069
00:43:34.001 --> 00:43:35.950
<v Speaker 5>then your your second place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not the winner.</v>

1070
00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:37.480
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's one winner.</v>

1071
00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:40.310
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1072
00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.940
<v Speaker 3>He's apparently chain smokes too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's amazing.</v>

1073
00:43:42.941 --> 00:43:44.800
<v Speaker 3>So this is the Berkeley marathons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know about this.</v>

1074
00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:47.680
<v Speaker 3>Did you see last same guy he ran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he created that race.</v>

1075
00:43:47.681 --> 00:43:50.380
<v Speaker 3>And this is another race he created.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's amazing.</v>

1076
00:43:50.381 --> 00:43:52.300
<v Speaker 3>So did you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was last year,</v>

1077
00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:53.940
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it right then?</v>

1078
00:43:53.941 --> 00:43:56.590
<v Speaker 3>It's the Berkeley Marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does the Berkeley Barkley,</v>

1079
00:43:56.591 --> 00:43:58.780
<v Speaker 3>Matt Barkley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Berkley or Barkley,</v>

1080
00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:02.110
<v Speaker 3>the Barkley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one that nobody could figure out how</v>

1081
00:44:02.111 --> 00:44:05.560
<v Speaker 3>to Mark Lee at the Barkley guy with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird one.</v>

1082
00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:08.200
<v Speaker 3>And I think it was if you searched his </v>
<v Speaker 3>jamie's well,</v>

1083
00:44:08.201 --> 00:44:10.600
<v Speaker 3>I think it was last year or the year </v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

1084
00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:11.643
<v Speaker 3>I believe it's the 24 hours or 40 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the guy missed out on finishing it </v>

1085
00:44:15.491 --> 00:44:19.900
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a minute rant and then at</v>

1086
00:44:19.901 --> 00:44:20.734
<v Speaker 3>the end and you see him on the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's absolutely devastated and he </v>

1087
00:44:22.931 --> 00:44:25.420
<v Speaker 3>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he may take a wrong turn somewhere along</v>

1088
00:44:25.421 --> 00:44:28.990
<v Speaker 3>the line cause it's really difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 3>follow that path.</v>

1089
00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>admirably.</v>

1090
00:44:30.521 --> 00:44:32.220
<v Speaker 3>He just got and he shook his hand</v>

1091
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:33.850
<v Speaker 4>and just said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want to thank you.</v>

1092
00:44:33.851 --> 00:44:35.070
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for that he said sometimes,</v>

1093
00:44:35.071 --> 00:44:36.990
<v Speaker 4>you know the Barkley Barkley Marathon </v>
<v Speaker 4>wins,</v>

1094
00:44:36.991 --> 00:44:39.640
<v Speaker 4>but you know that that takes something </v>
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

1095
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:41.033
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely takes something different to </v>

1096
00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:45.840
<v Speaker 4>see a final,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm correct in how they do it.</v>

1097
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:48.690
<v Speaker 4>I retweeted the courtney daughter water </v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

1098
00:44:48.691 --> 00:44:49.524
<v Speaker 4>I retweeted it from Courtney where it </v>
<v Speaker 4>says it's like getting punched in the </v>

1099
00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:56.130
<v Speaker 4>face very softly over and over and over </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

1100
00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly,</v>

1101
00:44:57.241 --> 00:44:58.650
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I compare it to being punched and put it</v>

1102
00:44:58.660 --> 00:44:59.493
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Put the article up version of the </v>

1103
00:45:02.431 --> 00:45:03.880
<v Speaker 4>article.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's the exact one.</v>

1104
00:45:03.881 --> 00:45:04.381
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1105
00:45:04.381 --> 00:45:07.080
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you scroll down,</v>

1106
00:45:07.081 --> 00:45:10.560
<v Speaker 4>you'll see the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the the specifications.</v>

1107
00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:13.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1108
00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:16.373
<v Speaker 4>And this is what I find amazing because </v>
<v Speaker 4>then it becomes about something </v>

1109
00:45:18.751 --> 00:45:19.584
<v Speaker 4>completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we were just talking now about </v>

1110
00:45:21.211 --> 00:45:24.250
<v Speaker 4>Kyc Shogi and the two hour marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like if you pick,</v>

1111
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:27.480
<v Speaker 4>put Kip chokey into this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know who's going to win?</v>

1112
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:32.610
<v Speaker 4>It says they had an hour to complete the</v>
<v Speaker 4>4.1667</v>

1113
00:45:32.611 --> 00:45:33.444
<v Speaker 4>mile loop and then they finished within </v>
<v Speaker 4>15 minutes to spare the bell clangs </v>

1114
00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.930
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's 7:40</v>

1115
00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:43.230
<v Speaker 4>AM they run it again and then at 8:48</v>
<v Speaker 4>AM they run it again.</v>

1116
00:45:43.231 --> 00:45:48.231
<v Speaker 4>At nine 40 they were running again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So every hour you run this 4.1667</v>

1117
00:45:49.411 --> 00:45:50.244
<v Speaker 4>mile loop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the bell just keeps clanging </v>

1118
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:57.270
<v Speaker 4>for forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you,</v>

1119
00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.720
<v Speaker 4>why do you think there's more people </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing these events now?</v>

1120
00:46:00.721 --> 00:46:01.554
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the same thing as </v>

1121
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.823
<v Speaker 4>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The same thing as if you buy a car </v>

1122
00:46:07.981 --> 00:46:10.200
<v Speaker 4>today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wanted to accelerate from zero to 60</v>

1123
00:46:10.201 --> 00:46:11.720
<v Speaker 4>in two and a half seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1124
00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:15.690
<v Speaker 4>A few years ago that was unheard of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you buy a computer today,</v>

1125
00:46:15.691 --> 00:46:20.691
<v Speaker 4>you want it to be 3.8</v>
<v Speaker 4>gigahertz and five terabyte hard drive.</v>

1126
00:46:21.361 --> 00:46:24.330
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the same every year.</v>

1127
00:46:24.331 --> 00:46:25.164
<v Speaker 4>We want improvements.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think when you hear someone's </v>

1128
00:46:28.351 --> 00:46:30.450
<v Speaker 4>going to run a 100 mile race,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go there,</v>

1129
00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:31.353
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's cute.</v>

1130
00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:33.210
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm gonna run 200 miles.</v>

1131
00:46:33.211 --> 00:46:34.430
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not even possible.</v>

1132
00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:36.020
<v Speaker 4>The same as the four minute mile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1133
00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:37.590
<v Speaker 4>Someone runs a 200 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

1134
00:46:37.591 --> 00:46:38.424
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe a guy rants for three </v>

1135
00:46:39.811 --> 00:46:41.160
<v Speaker 4>days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were in 200 miles.</v>

1136
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.890
<v Speaker 4>And then someone like courtney comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>along,</v>

1137
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:43.920
<v Speaker 4>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do it in two days.</v>

1138
00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:46.620
<v Speaker 4>And then she runs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she runs it in two days.</v>

1139
00:46:46.621 --> 00:46:47.454
<v Speaker 4>And then someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're talking about now doing a 500 </v>

1140
00:46:49.771 --> 00:46:53.100
<v Speaker 4>mile ultra marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1141
00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:54.750
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what I find amazing,</v>

1142
00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:56.850
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the athlete look like?</v>

1143
00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.260
<v Speaker 4>Who completes that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what I mean?</v>

1144
00:46:58.261 --> 00:46:59.910
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's very thin.</v>

1145
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:02.520
<v Speaker 4>She's very light and very thin and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1146
00:47:02.521 --> 00:47:06.600
<v Speaker 4>she's not the type of person that would </v>
<v Speaker 4>win a regular marathon.</v>

1147
00:47:06.601 --> 00:47:08.550
<v Speaker 4>This was what it was interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My friend Cam Haynes,</v>

1148
00:47:08.551 --> 00:47:10.510
<v Speaker 4>who also runs these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he ran the,</v>

1149
00:47:10.511 --> 00:47:11.221
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's quite,</v>

1150
00:47:11.221 --> 00:47:12.000
<v Speaker 4>he's pretty Jack.</v>

1151
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:12.833
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he works,</v>

1152
00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.170
<v Speaker 4>he lifts a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he cuts a lot of body weight when he</v>

1153
00:47:16.171 --> 00:47:17.150
<v Speaker 4>does those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1154
00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.620
<v Speaker 4>But the way he does it is he's a hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1155
00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:22.260
<v Speaker 4>He's what I was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the speed have darkness.</v>

1156
00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:23.880
<v Speaker 4>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got some darkness.</v>

1157
00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:27.390
<v Speaker 4>He just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'll burn 3000 calories,</v>

1158
00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:28.253
<v Speaker 4>eat 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he'll force his body to eat </v>

1159
00:47:30.221 --> 00:47:31.100
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1160
00:47:31.101 --> 00:47:34.420
<v Speaker 4>And so he drops down to the hundred and </v>
<v Speaker 4>60 something pound range.</v>

1161
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:35.583
<v Speaker 4>And then that's what he likes to weigh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When he normally walks around like one </v>

1162
00:47:38.381 --> 00:47:39.580
<v Speaker 4>85,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty built.</v>

1163
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:41.103
<v Speaker 4>But then he drops way down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'll lose like 20 pounds of muscle </v>

1164
00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:45.670
<v Speaker 4>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's always lean.</v>

1165
00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:46.713
<v Speaker 4>He's not losing body fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just forcing his body to literally </v>

1166
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:52.540
<v Speaker 4>eat itself just through mental </v>
<v Speaker 4>toughness.</v>

1167
00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:53.393
<v Speaker 4>But he's still quite big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even when he's tending up on the start </v>

1168
00:47:55.091 --> 00:47:55.690
<v Speaker 4>line and he's lost that.</v>

1169
00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:58.240
<v Speaker 4>He's still big for a year for an </v>
<v Speaker 4>endurance athlete.</v>

1170
00:47:58.241 --> 00:47:59.074
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But maybe that's one of the reasons why </v>

1171
00:47:59.711 --> 00:48:02.660
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't win these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He comes in like third fourth you mean?</v>

1172
00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:03.821
<v Speaker 4>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1173
00:48:03.821 --> 00:48:07.000
<v Speaker 4>he hasn't been doing it as long as them </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's 51 years old now,</v>

1174
00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:11.560
<v Speaker 4>but he's an animal man and this is just </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1175
00:48:11.561 --> 00:48:15.910
<v Speaker 4>that kind of mental fortitude that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>takes to do one of those things where to</v>

1176
00:48:15.911 --> 00:48:16.744
<v Speaker 4>do what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very unusual kind of drive and </v>

1177
00:48:20.051 --> 00:48:20.884
<v Speaker 4>people are very excited by that drive </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're very intrigued by it and </v>

1178
00:48:24.761 --> 00:48:27.970
<v Speaker 4>it's very attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very attractive to attempt to do.</v>

1179
00:48:27.971 --> 00:48:28.804
<v Speaker 4>It's very attractive to pay attention to</v>
<v Speaker 4>and watch cause everyone knows how </v>

1180
00:48:31.571 --> 00:48:34.240
<v Speaker 4>difficult he said.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's undeniably difficult.</v>

1181
00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:35.403
<v Speaker 4>Like if someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you talked to someone who doesn't know </v>

1182
00:48:37.121 --> 00:48:38.680
<v Speaker 4>how to run it all does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't do anything.</v>

1183
00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:39.880
<v Speaker 4>They just sit on the couch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You Go,</v>

1184
00:48:39.881 --> 00:48:40.571
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get up,</v>

1185
00:48:40.571 --> 00:48:42.070
<v Speaker 4>get up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to run three miles.</v>

1186
00:48:42.071 --> 00:48:44.680
<v Speaker 4>Like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the end of that three miles,</v>

1187
00:48:44.681 --> 00:48:47.050
<v Speaker 4>they will collapse the lay down their </v>
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

1188
00:48:47.051 --> 00:48:51.820
<v Speaker 4>Their heart would be pounding the chest </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be heaving so they know that's hard.</v>

1189
00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:54.970
<v Speaker 4>Everybody knows that's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody at one point in their life has</v>

1190
00:48:54.971 --> 00:48:55.804
<v Speaker 4>run until they were exhausted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's 500 yards or five miles or </v>

1191
00:48:59.891 --> 00:49:02.620
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was every from when you were</v>
<v Speaker 4>a kid.</v>

1192
00:49:02.621 --> 00:49:04.210
<v Speaker 4>There's always been a moment where we </v>
<v Speaker 4>tested ourselves,</v>

1193
00:49:04.211 --> 00:49:08.890
<v Speaker 4>so we're familiar with that feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 4>not being able to go on.</v>

1194
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:09.783
<v Speaker 4>So when they see a guy like you who went</v>
<v Speaker 4>through that feeling for six fucking </v>

1195
00:49:14.261 --> 00:49:16.060
<v Speaker 4>months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or was it five months total?</v>

1196
00:49:16.061 --> 00:49:17.710
<v Speaker 4>Five months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five months,</v>

1197
00:49:17.711 --> 00:49:21.100
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Five months is an insane amount of time.</v>

1198
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:26.630
<v Speaker 4>It is now upon the June,</v>
<v Speaker 4>July,</v>

1199
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.870
<v Speaker 4>August,</v>
<v Speaker 4>September,</v>

1200
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.870
<v Speaker 4>October,</v>
<v Speaker 4>November.</v>

1201
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:31.810
<v Speaker 4>You're into the sixth fucking month when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you stop.</v>

1202
00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:33.590
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1203
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:35.200
<v Speaker 4>but what you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

1204
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:36.063
<v Speaker 4>do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is again cause I had 12 hours </v>

1205
00:49:37.811 --> 00:49:38.644
<v Speaker 4>to think every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think is unusual or do you think </v>

1206
00:49:43.061 --> 00:49:47.020
<v Speaker 4>that we now think is unusual because </v>
<v Speaker 4>society has got real comfortable,</v>

1207
00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:48.083
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I maintained that stuff that I was </v>

1208
00:49:50.411 --> 00:49:53.260
<v Speaker 4>doing with salt 10 and everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>ancestors.</v>

1209
00:49:53.261 --> 00:49:54.580
<v Speaker 4>Do you not think they would have just </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought,</v>

1210
00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:56.140
<v Speaker 4>yeah that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just Monday.</v>

1211
00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:57.060
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

1212
00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:58.900
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anybody ever thought that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was just Monday.</v>

1213
00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:00.213
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they would have forced </v>

1214
00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:01.564
<v Speaker 4>themselves to do that because there's no</v>
<v Speaker 4>biological or evolutionary need to do </v>

1215
00:50:04.751 --> 00:50:05.584
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like you could swim for 12 </v>

1216
00:50:07.661 --> 00:50:08.494
<v Speaker 4>hours a day and get across the channel </v>
<v Speaker 4>and get to a place where there's better </v>

1217
00:50:10.451 --> 00:50:11.940
<v Speaker 4>fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know that are,</v>

1218
00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:13.450
<v Speaker 4>I don't think our ancestors ever did </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1219
00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:15.430
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely think they did.</v>

1220
00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.690
<v Speaker 4>What does that type of a hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1221
00:50:18.691 --> 00:50:20.800
<v Speaker 4>there's actually a term for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sharon's hunting.</v>

1222
00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:21.663
<v Speaker 4>Well they run an animal down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's called endurance </v>

1223
00:50:24.221 --> 00:50:24.970
<v Speaker 4>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>

1224
00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:27.920
<v Speaker 4>there's another term for it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they will literally,</v>

1225
00:50:27.921 --> 00:50:30.740
<v Speaker 4>like if you take an antelope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have sweat glands,</v>

1226
00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:31.883
<v Speaker 4>so they can run far faster than us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it comes a point in time when they </v>

1227
00:50:33.891 --> 00:50:34.724
<v Speaker 4>overheat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you just stay on them persistence </v>

1228
00:50:37.161 --> 00:50:38.990
<v Speaker 4>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's okay.</v>

1229
00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:40.940
<v Speaker 4>I named it right when you pulled it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>

1230
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:44.900
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>persistence hunting is in,</v>

1231
00:50:44.901 --> 00:50:45.734
<v Speaker 4>you see it in these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of these African men who go on to </v>

1232
00:50:48.681 --> 00:50:51.620
<v Speaker 4>be phenomenal endurance runners.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1233
00:50:51.621 --> 00:50:52.454
<v Speaker 4>they win marathons left and right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and his particular parts of Africa that </v>

1234
00:50:56.181 --> 00:50:59.330
<v Speaker 4>produce incredible runners and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>think a lot.</v>

1235
00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:00.363
<v Speaker 4>There was a really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an cut and run is a fantastic </v>

1236
00:51:04.011 --> 00:51:04.844
<v Speaker 4>episode of radio lab that details these </v>
<v Speaker 4>men from this one certain part in </v>

1237
00:51:09.321 --> 00:51:09.710
<v Speaker 4>Africa.</v>

1238
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:12.020
<v Speaker 4>I forget where it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but see if you pull that up.</v>

1239
00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:13.340
<v Speaker 4>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1240
00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:14.413
<v Speaker 4>this episode detailed the horrific </v>
<v Speaker 4>circumcision rituals that these men had </v>

1241
00:51:19.671 --> 00:51:23.320
<v Speaker 4>to endure where they cut their Dick and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1242
00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:24.163
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they stick a stick through it and then </v>

1243
00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:27.590
<v Speaker 4>they make them crawl through thorns </v>
<v Speaker 4>naked,</v>

1244
00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:28.470
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1245
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:30.260
<v Speaker 4>So I sold it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a guy a back in,</v>

1246
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:31.820
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's at Bruce Paris.</v>

1247
00:51:31.821 --> 00:51:32.654
<v Speaker 4>He's an adventurer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has done everything you can think of </v>

1248
00:51:35.091 --> 00:51:38.330
<v Speaker 4>every tribal initiation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the one that he refused to do</v>

1249
00:51:38.331 --> 00:51:39.164
<v Speaker 4>it for him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keeping Dick tact dealt those crazy </v>

1250
00:51:41.541 --> 00:51:42.374
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cut Your Dick.</v>

1251
00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:43.453
<v Speaker 4>The sand or the oldest inhabitants of </v>
<v Speaker 4>southern Africa where they have lived </v>

1252
00:51:46.221 --> 00:51:47.900
<v Speaker 4>for almost 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

1253
00:51:47.901 --> 00:51:50.600
<v Speaker 4>The term San is commonly used to refer </v>
<v Speaker 4>to a diverse group.</v>

1254
00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:53.290
<v Speaker 4>Diverse group of hunter gatherers living</v>
<v Speaker 4>in South Africa.</v>

1255
00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:54.143
<v Speaker 4>Share historical linguistic connections.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Many now except the term Bushman or </v>

1256
00:51:58.821 --> 00:51:59.330
<v Speaker 4>sand.</v>

1257
00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:00.990
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's bushmen hunting.</v>

1258
00:52:00.991 --> 00:52:04.890
<v Speaker 4>Is that from the radio lab thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they call themselves.</v>

1259
00:52:04.891 --> 00:52:07.190
<v Speaker 4>You see article here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I would imagine,</v>

1260
00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:08.690
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it the same?</v>

1261
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:12.140
<v Speaker 4>But is that the same with the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the horrible circumcision ritual?</v>

1262
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:14.010
<v Speaker 4>I'll double check.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1263
00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:15.470
<v Speaker 4>the hall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking horrible.</v>

1264
00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:17.780
<v Speaker 4>But they were arguing in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1265
00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:21.200
<v Speaker 4>when they were discussing it and one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the guys who was on and who had actually</v>

1266
00:52:21.201 --> 00:52:23.420
<v Speaker 4>been through it and now I believe he </v>
<v Speaker 4>lives,</v>

1267
00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:25.460
<v Speaker 4>he lives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe he lives in America,</v>

1268
00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:28.700
<v Speaker 4>but he was saying he would never have </v>
<v Speaker 4>his children go through that.</v>

1269
00:52:28.701 --> 00:52:31.010
<v Speaker 4>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it made him who he is.</v>

1270
00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:35.780
<v Speaker 4>And the idea was that not only are these</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys physically gifted,</v>

1271
00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:37.093
<v Speaker 4>but they also have unbelievable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unbelievable pain tolerance and mental </v>

1272
00:52:41.931 --> 00:52:42.764
<v Speaker 4>endurance and just mental toughness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that this is one of the reasons why </v>

1273
00:52:45.471 --> 00:52:46.304
<v Speaker 4>they become so successful is that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to push a pace for two plus </v>

1274
00:52:50.781 --> 00:52:51.614
<v Speaker 4>miles or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their marathon time is not just </v>

1275
00:52:53.901 --> 00:52:57.650
<v Speaker 4>dependent upon their physical ability,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also dependent upon their ability to</v>

1276
00:52:57.651 --> 00:53:00.630
<v Speaker 4>endure pain and to force themselves </v>
<v Speaker 4>past,</v>

1277
00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:02.043
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyone could kind of trot along at a </v>

1278
00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:05.780
<v Speaker 4>really leisurely pace and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>painful,</v>

1279
00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:07.840
<v Speaker 4>but if you're going to hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1280
00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.320
<v Speaker 4>you're really going hard.</v>

1281
00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:11.720
<v Speaker 4>This is the radio lab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This Kenya.</v>

1282
00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:12.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the,</v>

1283
00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:13.551
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cut.</v>

1284
00:53:13.551 --> 00:53:15.380
<v Speaker 4>Pogie I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

1285
00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:18.350
<v Speaker 4>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1286
00:53:18.351 --> 00:53:20.060
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before you,</v>

1287
00:53:20.061 --> 00:53:21.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1288
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:23.000
<v Speaker 4>well I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've kind of described it,</v>

1289
00:53:23.001 --> 00:53:25.830
<v Speaker 4>but they describe it even more detail</v>

1290
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:27.520
<v Speaker 2>in the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1291
00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:30.150
<v Speaker 2>that almost crosses over to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1292
00:53:30.151 --> 00:53:30.984
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not advocating what you just </v>

1293
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.900
<v Speaker 2>genitalia mutilation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not advocating that.</v>

1294
00:53:37.901 --> 00:53:41.580
<v Speaker 2>But there's that idea of adversity </v>
<v Speaker 2>training that like if you're ever in the</v>

1295
00:53:41.581 --> 00:53:41.971
<v Speaker 2>gym,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1296
00:53:41.971 --> 00:53:43.290
<v Speaker 2>what you training?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just like strength,</v>

1297
00:53:43.291 --> 00:53:45.300
<v Speaker 2>what you're training speed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is why,</v>

1298
00:53:45.301 --> 00:53:46.134
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge fan of Wim Hoff because so </v>

1299
00:53:47.371 --> 00:53:50.340
<v Speaker 2>often what he's doing when he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>submerged in ice cold,</v>

1300
00:53:50.341 --> 00:53:51.270
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm training my cup.</v>

1301
00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:52.290
<v Speaker 2>Hilary's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1302
00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:53.550
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean you're training your </v>
<v Speaker 2>cup?</v>

1303
00:53:53.551 --> 00:53:55.920
<v Speaker 2>Hillary's and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these were atrophying,</v>

1304
00:53:55.921 --> 00:53:59.400
<v Speaker 2>these age old inbuilt mechanisms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

1305
00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:01.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm not advocating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1306
00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:06.300
<v Speaker 2>what general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do you remember king tolerance,</v>

1307
00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:07.523
<v Speaker 2>teaching tolerance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that I that's maybe </v>

1308
00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:09.570
<v Speaker 2>missing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1309
00:54:09.570 --> 00:54:12.030
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at mma like maybe that you,</v>

1310
00:54:12.031 --> 00:54:13.360
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1311
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.690
<v Speaker 2>whether it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1312
00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:18.120
<v Speaker 2>moo tie and they're like kicking trees </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>

1313
00:54:18.121 --> 00:54:19.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Granted that's,</v>

1314
00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:20.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making denser bones and stuff.</v>

1315
00:54:20.611 --> 00:54:22.740
<v Speaker 2>But do you think there's that element as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well?</v>

1316
00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:24.520
<v Speaker 2>And when you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1317
00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:26.940
<v Speaker 2>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1318
00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:28.523
<v Speaker 2>I forgot what it was now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you just start looking at just </v>

1319
00:54:29.791 --> 00:54:33.780
<v Speaker 2>putting people in high stress situations</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to see how they're going to cope.</v>

1320
00:54:33.781 --> 00:54:37.020
<v Speaker 2>Like John Fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like notorious for letting people</v>

1321
00:54:37.021 --> 00:54:40.590
<v Speaker 2>almost try and submit him and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>tie themselves out.</v>

1322
00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:43.120
<v Speaker 2>He was just completely calm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then</v>

1323
00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:46.840
<v Speaker 5>that really depends on who's choking </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

1324
00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:50.650
<v Speaker 5>Cause Josh Kirkman choked him completely</v>
<v Speaker 5>unconscious.</v>

1325
00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:51.460
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1326
00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:52.031
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1327
00:54:52.031 --> 00:54:54.490
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Berchmans got a hell of a guillotine and</v>

1328
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.863
<v Speaker 5>John Fitch shot in on them and Berkman </v>
<v Speaker 5>caught them and the good team to sleep </v>

1329
00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:00.950
<v Speaker 5>and the first round,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1330
00:55:01.110 --> 00:55:02.170
<v Speaker 5>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1331
00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:04.270
<v Speaker 5>there's guys that can just put you to </v>
<v Speaker 5>sleep.</v>

1332
00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:04.980
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1333
00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:09.010
<v Speaker 5>If you think that you can get away with </v>
<v Speaker 5>that shit with like a Marcello Garcia,</v>

1334
00:55:09.011 --> 00:55:10.780
<v Speaker 5>you're going to wake up going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what happened?</v>

1335
00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:11.990
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1336
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:15.250
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most guys won't be able to choke you.</v>

1337
00:55:15.590 --> 00:55:17.030
<v Speaker 2>So to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1338
00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:19.520
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm catching up on 157 days.</v>

1339
00:55:19.521 --> 00:55:20.354
<v Speaker 2>If you have c in his life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was actually out at sea with the </v>

1340
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:23.690
<v Speaker 2>Mcgregor and could beep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on that note,</v>

1341
00:55:23.691 --> 00:55:26.630
<v Speaker 2>do you think he tapped premature?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think there's not asleep?</v>

1342
00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:28.053
<v Speaker 2>Mcgregor went to sleep.</v>

1343
00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:29.310
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that in that fight,</v>

1344
00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:32.880
<v Speaker 5>I thought you meant John Fishing net </v>
<v Speaker 5>crank,</v>

1345
00:55:32.881 --> 00:55:34.190
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1346
00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.390
<v Speaker 5>he did not tap premature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1347
00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:38.900
<v Speaker 5>he did not defend it though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>K,</v>

1348
00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:40.380
<v Speaker 5>here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was done.</v>

1349
00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.290
<v Speaker 5>He was beaten down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Khabib fucked him up.</v>

1350
00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:46.530
<v Speaker 5>Could be smashed him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there was a lot of people that don't</v>

1351
00:55:46.531 --> 00:55:48.630
<v Speaker 5>train and this was very frustrating to </v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

1352
00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:52.710
<v Speaker 5>Like there are as many people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>train that think that that was something</v>

1353
00:55:52.711 --> 00:55:55.830
<v Speaker 5>that you shouldn't tap to there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're out of their fucking mind.</v>

1354
00:55:55.850 --> 00:55:57.900
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is what's called a fulcrum Cho.</v>

1355
00:55:57.930 --> 00:55:59.060
<v Speaker 5>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1356
00:55:59.061 --> 00:56:02.130
<v Speaker 5>it's not necessarily a choke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it is.</v>

1357
00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:02.993
<v Speaker 5>It chokes you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it really feels like you're fucking </v>

1358
00:56:05.071 --> 00:56:05.904
<v Speaker 5>head's going to pop off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What he's doing is he's wrapping around </v>

1359
00:56:08.551 --> 00:56:11.010
<v Speaker 5>the face and you don't have to even go </v>
<v Speaker 5>under the jaw.</v>

1360
00:56:11.011 --> 00:56:11.844
<v Speaker 5>You can get it on the chin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if you're as strong as could </v>

1361
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:14.300
<v Speaker 5>bead.</v>

1362
00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:18.840
<v Speaker 5>Then you clamp your hands together and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're pressing your forearm against his</v>

1363
00:56:18.841 --> 00:56:19.674
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you've got this and you've got the </v>

1364
00:56:20.941 --> 00:56:23.190
<v Speaker 5>forum against his back and you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

1365
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:27.210
<v Speaker 5>Just leave his fucking head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just like it's,</v>

1366
00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:30.520
<v Speaker 5>and Khabib is so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His Greg,</v>

1367
00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:31.383
<v Speaker 5>he's been grappling since he was a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All of his muscles are designed to </v>

1368
00:56:35.471 --> 00:56:36.304
<v Speaker 5>squeeze and crush smash and he gets a </v>
<v Speaker 5>hold of your neck in that position and </v>

1369
00:56:41.081 --> 00:56:44.020
<v Speaker 5>he's got that forearm pressed against </v>
<v Speaker 5>your back.</v>

1370
00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:47.440
<v Speaker 5>See if you can find an image of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>actual submission.</v>

1371
00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:49.930
<v Speaker 5>You could really clearly see what he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing.</v>

1372
00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.033
<v Speaker 5>And then there was a video where dean </v>
<v Speaker 5>lister and my friend Hans Molan camp </v>

1373
00:56:54.521 --> 00:56:55.354
<v Speaker 5>described it as pulling that up and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>been taken off instagram for that video </v>

1374
00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:59.583
<v Speaker 5>to Hahn's Molin Camp Dean lister video.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well maybe someone to re posted it and </v>

1375
00:57:03.551 --> 00:57:04.930
<v Speaker 5>that link is gone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's so weird.</v>

1378
00:57:11.170 --> 00:57:14.290
<v Speaker 5>Wonder why anybody would take that down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>

1379
00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:19.540
<v Speaker 5>there's guys who could fuck your face up</v>
<v Speaker 5>without even going under the neck.</v>

1380
00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:21.430
<v Speaker 5>A good example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's another good example.</v>

1381
00:57:21.431 --> 00:57:23.190
<v Speaker 5>Just pull this up.</v>

1382
00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:24.580
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1383
00:57:24.581 --> 00:57:25.820
<v Speaker 5>but he's still describing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>who's a world champion,</v>

1387

1391
00:57:41.801 --> 00:57:42.634
<v Speaker 5>Did see how it's forearm is pressed </v>
<v Speaker 5>against the back and the arm is under </v>

1392
00:57:45.881 --> 00:57:46.990
<v Speaker 5>the chin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

1393
00:57:46.991 --> 00:57:49.780
<v Speaker 5>the differences with Dean is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he can't even help himself.</v>

1394
00:57:49.781 --> 00:57:53.530
<v Speaker 5>He's immediately putting his arms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his hands on the arm that's choking him.</v>

1395
00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:54.640
<v Speaker 5>That's what you're supposed to do.</v>

1396
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.250
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you look at what connor did,</v>

1397
00:57:57.490 --> 00:58:01.390
<v Speaker 5>Conard just waited until he couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>take it anymore and tapped.</v>

1398
00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:01.870
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1399
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:05.110
<v Speaker 5>When you see conor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>both of his arms are down,</v>

1400
00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:08.380
<v Speaker 5>he's getting his neck crank and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't do this.</v>

1401
00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:09.573
<v Speaker 5>That's what you're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's supposed to do two on one and then </v>

1402
00:58:11.711 --> 00:58:12.610
<v Speaker 5>you dropped out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1403
00:58:12.611 --> 00:58:14.170
<v Speaker 5>look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see what he's doing there.</v>

1404
00:58:14.171 --> 00:58:16.540
<v Speaker 5>He's tapping.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But see where his left arm,</v>

1405
00:58:16.541 --> 00:58:19.900
<v Speaker 5>his left arm should not this you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't,</v>

1406
00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.011
<v Speaker 5>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

1407
00:58:21.011 --> 00:58:23.980
<v Speaker 5>that is a perfect example of the fulcrum</v>
<v Speaker 5>choke.</v>

1408
00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:27.310
<v Speaker 5>See how he's doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pressing his forearm against the back,</v>

1409
00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.080
<v Speaker 5>squeezing the head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1410
00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:31.270
<v Speaker 5>it's a neck crank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a choke.</v>

1411
00:58:31.271 --> 00:58:34.420
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of shit going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't have to be under the chin.</v>

1412
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:37.210
<v Speaker 5>It could just be on your face and you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to get fucked up.</v>

1413
00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:42.540
<v Speaker 5>So all those folks out there that were </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying that it wasn't a choke need to go</v>

1414
00:58:43.211 --> 00:58:44.044
<v Speaker 5>have someone apply that to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They need to start training Jujitsu and </v>

1415
00:58:47.081 --> 00:58:47.914
<v Speaker 5>stop fucking talking about MMA </v>
<v Speaker 5>submissions cause they don't die that </v>

1416
00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:55.210
<v Speaker 5>you're going to tap bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't say you're not going to tap.</v>

1417
00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:56.490
<v Speaker 5>You get a fucking tap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1418
00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:59.470
<v Speaker 5>Not everybody's going to tap from that </v>
<v Speaker 5>because other people,</v>

1419
00:58:59.471 --> 00:59:00.304
<v Speaker 5>unlike connor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are going to be better at defending </v>

1420
00:59:01.361 --> 00:59:03.790
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're going to get like you get a hold</v>

1421
00:59:03.791 --> 00:59:04.624
<v Speaker 5>of a worldclass Brazilian Jiu Jitsu </v>
<v Speaker 5>black belt who's also an MMA fighter </v>

1422
00:59:07.811 --> 00:59:09.700
<v Speaker 5>like um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like vinny magallanes.</v>

1423
00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:12.700
<v Speaker 5>He's going to grab a hold of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's going to defend properly.</v>

1424
00:59:12.701 --> 00:59:15.280
<v Speaker 5>He's going to adjust.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's going to try to get out of that.</v>

1425
00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:17.740
<v Speaker 5>He might have to tap if someone gets him</v>
<v Speaker 5>in it.</v>

1426
00:59:17.741 --> 00:59:19.630
<v Speaker 5>I mean he people tap,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's,</v>

1427
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:22.610
<v Speaker 5>he's not going to just have one arm </v>
<v Speaker 5>posted.</v>

1428
00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:24.770
<v Speaker 5>That's just not the right way to handle </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1429
00:59:24.771 --> 00:59:26.510
<v Speaker 5>But I think that's because connor had </v>
<v Speaker 5>eaten</v>

1430
00:59:26.610 --> 00:59:29.340
<v Speaker 2>bombs when I was about to I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's all technical.</v>

1431
00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:31.650
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's that almost as a,</v>

1432
00:59:31.651 --> 00:59:32.970
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1433
00:59:32.971 --> 00:59:34.830
<v Speaker 2>like a continuum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's technical,</v>

1434
00:59:35.130 --> 00:59:36.570
<v Speaker 2>which you've just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't bring it.</v>

1435
00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:37.830
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again I should point out,</v>

1436
00:59:37.831 --> 00:59:38.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1437
00:59:38.311 --> 00:59:40.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm a complete layman when it comes to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mixed martial arts,</v>

1438
00:59:40.201 --> 00:59:43.590
<v Speaker 2>but I find it fascinating the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this adversity training aspects.</v>

1439
00:59:43.591 --> 00:59:47.660
<v Speaker 2>So you were just saying he was eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>bombs before that would have,</v>

1440
00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:50.080
<v Speaker 2>would it have helped you know that if he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't,</v>

1441
00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:51.370
<v Speaker 2>do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where,</v>

1442
00:59:51.371 --> 00:59:52.380
<v Speaker 2>where does it cross over from being,</v>

1443
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:57.180
<v Speaker 5>it would help if he wasn't as tired.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like if that choke was applied during</v>

1444
00:59:57.181 --> 01:00:01.080
<v Speaker 5>the first few seconds or minutes of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>first round,</v>

1445
01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:04.470
<v Speaker 5>I think he probably would have had a </v>
<v Speaker 5>good chance to survive.</v>

1446
01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.333
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1447
01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:07.770
<v Speaker 5>What's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put on dean lister as equal.</v>

1448
01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:09.570
<v Speaker 5>Chokan is not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not being done well,</v>

1449
01:00:09.571 --> 01:00:11.460
<v Speaker 5>but this is a diff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not an exact,</v>

1450
01:00:11.461 --> 01:00:13.500
<v Speaker 5>you'll choke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

1451
01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:16.420
<v Speaker 5>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what this is is,</v>

1452
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:20.520
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's kind of an Ezekiel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but see where his hand is.</v>

1453
01:00:20.730 --> 01:00:23.430
<v Speaker 5>You got to really get underneath.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See his left hand.</v>

1454
01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:25.560
<v Speaker 5>That left hand's got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not just there.</v>

1455
01:00:25.561 --> 01:00:26.394
<v Speaker 5>It's got to go under the chin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not good enough for a guy like </v>

1456
01:00:29.041 --> 01:00:29.851
<v Speaker 5>dean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got,</v>

1457
01:00:29.851 --> 01:00:30.684
<v Speaker 5>I'll get now it's pretty fucking tight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it's tight and he's got to get </v>

1458
01:00:33.331 --> 01:00:34.164
<v Speaker 5>further and further.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the further that left arm gets into </v>

1459
01:00:36.571 --> 01:00:37.650
<v Speaker 5>jeans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>neck,</v>

1460
01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:39.450
<v Speaker 5>the more more.</v>

1461
01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.490
<v Speaker 5>There's going to be a possibility of him</v>
<v Speaker 5>choking.</v>

1462
01:00:41.491 --> 01:00:45.030
<v Speaker 5>But Dean has been fucking choked his </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole life,</v>

1463
01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:46.193
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I do have to say that Josh Barnett </v>

1464
01:00:49.081 --> 01:00:49.914
<v Speaker 5>bade him tap and Josh Barnett is like </v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the few guys that's made dean </v>

1465
01:00:53.341 --> 01:00:54.174
<v Speaker 5>lister tap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think the first time he tapped in </v>

1466
01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:59.700
<v Speaker 5>a decade and Josh Barnett got him in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>scarf hold.</v>

1467
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:02.610
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that was in Metamorris.</v>

1468
01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:07.140
<v Speaker 5>And Josh Barnett who is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a catch wrestling specialist.</v>

1469
01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:09.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go to the very end of it here.</v>

1470
01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:13.770
<v Speaker 5>Josh Barnett gets a hold of deans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He gets it.</v>

1471
01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:16.230
<v Speaker 5>C in this position right here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's inside control,</v>

1472
01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:20.310
<v Speaker 5>which is just impressive enough that </v>
<v Speaker 5>Josh was able to do this with a guy like</v>

1473
01:01:20.311 --> 01:01:22.530
<v Speaker 5>dean lister,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then he gets him in.</v>

1474
01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:23.900
<v Speaker 5>What's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

1475
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:26.970
<v Speaker 5>he probably has a different name for it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a,</v>

1476
01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.250
<v Speaker 5>we used to call it judo side control.</v>

1477
01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:32.220
<v Speaker 5>It's quite a bit further down on this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got to keep going,</v>

1478
01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:33.210
<v Speaker 5>keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep going,</v>

1479
01:01:33.211 --> 01:01:38.211
<v Speaker 5>keep going all the way to the end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he gets a hold of his,</v>

1480
01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:41.010
<v Speaker 5>he's got a head and arm choke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here it is.</v>

1481
01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:44.760
<v Speaker 5>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he's got his head and his arm trapped</v>

1482
01:01:44.761 --> 01:01:45.594
<v Speaker 5>together and Josh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's an enormously powerful person is </v>

1483
01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.210
<v Speaker 5>really neck cranking him as much as </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>

1484
01:01:51.211 --> 01:01:52.044
<v Speaker 5>And then dean was forced to tap,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is at the end of a long match </v>

1485
01:01:56.070 --> 01:01:58.800
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it could have been exhaustion,</v>

1486
01:01:58.801 --> 01:02:01.410
<v Speaker 5>might've played a part in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It most certainly was josh.</v>

1487
01:02:01.411 --> 01:02:04.860
<v Speaker 5>His skill and his ability to apply that </v>
<v Speaker 5>technique.</v>

1488
01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:07.950
<v Speaker 5>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is a guy like dean lister,</v>

1489
01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.900
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to tap that guy easy.</v>

1490
01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:11.870
<v Speaker 2>But this is an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1491
01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:15.560
<v Speaker 2>again with sort of holding my hands up </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying I'm so sort of naive,</v>

1492
01:02:15.561 --> 01:02:18.920
<v Speaker 2>a huge fan of Evan May,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not necessarily any of the technical</v>

1493
01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 2>aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I love</v>

1494
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.660
<v Speaker 5>is when you look at someone like you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

1495
01:02:21.661 --> 01:02:23.150
<v Speaker 5>Nick Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all Michael Bisping,</v>

1496
01:02:23.650 --> 01:02:25.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people don't understand his conditioning</v>

1497
01:02:25.801 --> 01:02:26.634
<v Speaker 5>and he will just wear people down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Massive mental toughness to would </v>

1498
01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.700
<v Speaker 5>bisping has is just insane mental </v>
<v Speaker 5>toughness.</v>

1499
01:02:32.970 --> 01:02:35.160
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bisping basically has one eye.</v>

1500
01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.490
<v Speaker 5>If you look at his eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his one of his,</v>

1501
01:02:38.491 --> 01:02:39.324
<v Speaker 5>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I hope he can get surgery on it now </v>

1502
01:02:41.551 --> 01:02:42.384
<v Speaker 5>because he has retired,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he has oil like embedded in his eye to </v>

1503
01:02:48.301 --> 01:02:52.410
<v Speaker 5>protect his retina because it's been </v>
<v Speaker 5>torn so many times been torn.</v>

1504
01:02:52.411 --> 01:02:54.990
<v Speaker 5>He had surgery on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had a repair torn again.</v>

1505
01:02:55.260 --> 01:03:00.210
<v Speaker 5>His right eye is fucked up man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of the reasons why he retired as</v>

1506
01:03:00.211 --> 01:03:03.600
<v Speaker 5>he started to see some irregularities in</v>
<v Speaker 5>his vision in his left eye.</v>

1507
01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:06.810
<v Speaker 5>So as good I was fucking up too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>

1508
01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.020
<v Speaker 5>Michael Bisping is a fucking animal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he is,</v>

1509
01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.760
<v Speaker 5>he is about as tough as it gets.</v>

1510
01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:16.760
<v Speaker 5>And he's not like a spectacularly </v>
<v Speaker 5>physically talented guy like a Jon Jones</v>

1511
01:03:17.221 --> 01:03:20.670
<v Speaker 5>or Yoel Romero who was just this </v>
<v Speaker 5>unbelievable specimen.</v>

1512
01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:21.960
<v Speaker 5>Michael's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1513
01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:26.740
<v Speaker 5>a really good athlete unquestionably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it just taught just fucking tufts.</v>

1514
01:03:26.741 --> 01:03:28.430
<v Speaker 5>So to answer your question,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

1515
01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.273
<v Speaker 5>there's this in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could speak to this because what </v>

1516
01:03:32.521 --> 01:03:33.354
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ability to overcome adversity like </v>

1517
01:03:35.731 --> 01:03:36.564
<v Speaker 5>some people when you were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>that fatigue is an emotionally driven </v>

1518
01:03:42.331 --> 01:03:43.164
<v Speaker 5>thing that there's this feeling that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>get and you can give in to that feeling </v>

1519
01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:48.420
<v Speaker 5>where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

1520
01:03:48.421 --> 01:03:49.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fucking can't do this anymore.</v>

1521
01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:51.023
<v Speaker 5>And some people are more susceptible to </v>
<v Speaker 5>that than others and they give into it </v>

1522
01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:55.500
<v Speaker 5>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1523
01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:56.670
<v Speaker 5>for a person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's,</v>

1524
01:03:56.671 --> 01:03:59.060
<v Speaker 5>here's where you can experience this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what is,</v>

1525
01:03:59.370 --> 01:04:03.240
<v Speaker 5>whether or not your mindset can affect </v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

1526
01:04:03.241 --> 01:04:04.074
<v Speaker 5>your endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get on a treadmill or a stationary bike </v>

1527
01:04:07.471 --> 01:04:09.240
<v Speaker 5>or whatever you want to do for cardio.</v>

1528
01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:14.630
<v Speaker 5>And then listened to a really kick ass </v>
<v Speaker 5>song and put on headphones and that song</v>

1529
01:04:15.451 --> 01:04:18.370
<v Speaker 5>comes on and you just can't fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eh,</v>

1530
01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:21.030
<v Speaker 5>you could just go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's something about that.</v>

1531
01:04:21.031 --> 01:04:24.210
<v Speaker 5>And even if you're tired,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if you're tired and you've put on a</v>

1532
01:04:24.211 --> 01:04:25.380
<v Speaker 5>good song,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like fuck that,</v>

1533
01:04:25.381 --> 01:04:28.380
<v Speaker 5>we're going to keep going like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing has happened.</v>

1534
01:04:28.381 --> 01:04:29.214
<v Speaker 5>You haven't taken in any kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>supplement or any kind of a stimulant </v>

1535
01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:33.953
<v Speaker 5>that you haven't gotten an injection in </v>
<v Speaker 5>your body or you're not sucking on some </v>

1536
01:04:36.541 --> 01:04:39.810
<v Speaker 5>kind of new gas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your body's exactly the same.</v>

1537
01:04:40.050 --> 01:04:43.710
<v Speaker 5>But through the motivation that you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting from this music,</v>

1538
01:04:43.711 --> 01:04:46.560
<v Speaker 5>the emotional stimulation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just like,</v>

1539
01:04:46.561 --> 01:04:48.090
<v Speaker 5>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to keep going.</v>

1540
01:04:48.091 --> 01:04:50.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you can keep going.</v>

1541
01:04:50.641 --> 01:04:52.800
<v Speaker 5>And not only can you keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can go faster,</v>

1542
01:04:52.801 --> 01:04:55.890
<v Speaker 5>you could push harder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can find these reserves.</v>

1543
01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:58.770
<v Speaker 5>So the idea is that these reserves are </v>
<v Speaker 5>always there.</v>

1544
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:59.783
<v Speaker 5>You have to be able to achieve this </v>
<v Speaker 5>state of mind that you achieve when you </v>

1545
01:05:01.921 --> 01:05:04.050
<v Speaker 5>hear a really good song.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1546
01:05:04.110 --> 01:05:06.090
<v Speaker 5>and that's true that I think people </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't understand.</v>

1547
01:05:06.091 --> 01:05:06.924
<v Speaker 5>You are the outcomist of your own body </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you know in terms of </v>

1548
01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.760
<v Speaker 5>neurotransmitter's chemical signals in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the brain,</v>

1549
01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:13.620
<v Speaker 5>you can impact though sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1550
01:05:13.621 --> 01:05:14.454
<v Speaker 5>you need extended liveness his music,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you spoke about sometimes you </v>

1551
01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:18.250
<v Speaker 5>know caffeine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

1552
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.690
<v Speaker 3>when you start to control them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1553
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:23.050
<v Speaker 3>it can be so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people do it naturally,</v>

1554
01:05:23.051 --> 01:05:25.420
<v Speaker 3>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they've just got it in built.</v>

1555
01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:28.200
<v Speaker 3>But when you start to trend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's only now that we're,</v>

1556
01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:30.730
<v Speaker 3>we're going down that route and looking </v>
<v Speaker 3>at that as a,</v>

1557
01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:32.013
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>until previously it was one of those </v>

1558
01:05:32.831 --> 01:05:34.780
<v Speaker 3>intangibles that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1559
01:05:34.781 --> 01:05:38.440
<v Speaker 3>you kind of under appreciate it in any </v>
<v Speaker 3>sport and now we're going,</v>

1560
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:39.303
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1561
01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:39.791
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1562
01:05:39.791 --> 01:05:41.640
<v Speaker 3>that person over there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1563
01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:42.483
<v Speaker 3>that mental fortitude or what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about there is maybe their </v>

1564
01:05:44.591 --> 01:05:47.230
<v Speaker 3>ability to alter their own chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>biochemical reactions,</v>

1565
01:05:47.231 --> 01:05:49.420
<v Speaker 3>the body and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something real that happens,</v>

1566
01:05:49.421 --> 01:05:50.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1567
01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:51.453
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you hear a song and you get </v>

1568
01:05:52.721 --> 01:05:54.620
<v Speaker 3>excited,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like whatever that hair,</v>

1569
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:58.330
<v Speaker 3>whatever that that burst is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like a real,</v>

1570
01:05:58.331 --> 01:06:00.730
<v Speaker 3>like if that was a pill and you took it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you be like,</v>

1571
01:06:00.731 --> 01:06:01.690
<v Speaker 3>oh this works.</v>

1572
01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.033
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is is it's been around </v>

1573
01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:05.523
<v Speaker 3>years when you look at like um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know Marcus Aurelius Meditations </v>

1574
01:06:08.141 --> 01:06:10.180
<v Speaker 3>will stomach philosophy and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about you know,</v>

1575
01:06:10.181 --> 01:06:12.160
<v Speaker 3>dialogue being both external,</v>
<v Speaker 3>internal.</v>

1576
01:06:12.161 --> 01:06:14.320
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the conversations that go on inside your</v>

1577
01:06:14.321 --> 01:06:15.154
<v Speaker 3>own head to just as important as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations that we have with other </v>

1578
01:06:16.691 --> 01:06:19.600
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've understood this for years,</v>

1579
01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:24.310
<v Speaker 3>but it's only just now that we're trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to kind of apply a little bit of science</v>

1580
01:06:24.311 --> 01:06:25.144
<v Speaker 3>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at the psychology in this mind </v>

1581
01:06:26.561 --> 01:06:29.530
<v Speaker 3>body connection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fact is yes,</v>

1582
01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:32.620
<v Speaker 3>some of the greatest ancient stoics they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were trying to figure out as well.</v>

1583
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:36.680
<v Speaker 3>And when you can start to tap into that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where that can become and,</v>

1584
01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:38.920
<v Speaker 3>and it might be a particular song,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1585
01:06:38.930 --> 01:06:40.370
<v Speaker 3>might be a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is something,</v>

1586
01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:41.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get into,</v>

1587
01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:45.580
<v Speaker 3>you're going to a gym or that you've got</v>
<v Speaker 3>a friend that can bring the out of you.</v>

1588
01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:48.760
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you knew my training back home.</v>

1589
01:06:48.761 --> 01:06:49.990
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Andrew Bolton,</v>

1590
01:06:49.991 --> 01:06:50.824
<v Speaker 3>who was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first guy to dead lift a thousand </v>

1591
01:06:52.210 --> 01:06:52.451
<v Speaker 3>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1592
01:06:52.451 --> 01:06:54.460
<v Speaker 3>cheeses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1593
01:06:54.461 --> 01:06:56.380
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean thousand pounds.</v>

1594
01:06:56.410 --> 01:06:57.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

1595
01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.610
<v Speaker 3>the clip when you see it and he pulls a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand pounds per se.</v>

1596
01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:03.190
<v Speaker 3>It's since been being by Eddie Hall who </v>
<v Speaker 3>did a half the time.</v>

1597
01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:04.600
<v Speaker 3>So he did lift off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

1598
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:09.310
<v Speaker 3>Editing isn't a half a ton of thousand </v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds that a little bit less.</v>

1599
01:07:09.311 --> 01:07:12.070
<v Speaker 3>So I think thousand pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's that for?</v>

1600
01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:14.500
<v Speaker 3>I thought a ton was 2000 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

1601
01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:15.391
<v Speaker 3>So yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1602
01:07:15.391 --> 01:07:17.530
<v Speaker 3>Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's a thousand pounds in kilos?</v>

1603
01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.610
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to kill us.</v>

1604
01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:19.781
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The two.</v>

1605
01:07:19.781 --> 01:07:21.310
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was two metrics there.</v>

1606
01:07:21.311 --> 01:07:23.560
<v Speaker 3>So Andy Bolton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was a little bit 0.2</v>

1607
01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:27.340
<v Speaker 3>kilos per pound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No 2.2</v>

1608
01:07:27.341 --> 01:07:29.410
<v Speaker 3>pounds per kilo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1609
01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:30.191
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1610
01:07:30.191 --> 01:07:31.024
<v Speaker 3>and when you see him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is what I love when you </v>

1611
01:07:32.411 --> 01:07:35.140
<v Speaker 3>start looking at Jesus Christ as this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie,</v>

1612
01:07:35.141 --> 01:07:37.270
<v Speaker 3>that's his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's his half a teller fucker.</v>

1613
01:07:37.271 --> 01:07:40.200
<v Speaker 3>His knees staying together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right there you look at is,</v>

1614
01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:43.150
<v Speaker 3>if you look at how big his body is and </v>
<v Speaker 3>how normal sizes,</v>

1615
01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:45.640
<v Speaker 3>knees are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the bones in his knees.</v>

1616
01:07:45.641 --> 01:07:47.380
<v Speaker 3>They look so normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1617
01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:50.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean that dies fucking people I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievable.</v>

1618
01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:54.490
<v Speaker 3>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1619
01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:57.700
<v Speaker 3>So when those guys retire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how fucked up or their bodies,</v>

1620
01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:58.980
<v Speaker 3>how would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know Eddie's law?</v>

1621
01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:02.480
<v Speaker 3>What's brilliant about the bees tattooed</v>
<v Speaker 3>his inside of his arm.</v>

1622
01:08:02.490 --> 01:08:05.490
<v Speaker 3>So he's going to argue with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1623
01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:07.810
<v Speaker 3>you're a fucking beast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's nose was bleeding.</v>

1624
01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:08.861
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

1625
01:08:08.861 --> 01:08:10.690
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His nose started spraying blood while he</v>

1626
01:08:10.691 --> 01:08:14.010
<v Speaker 3>was without him or another guy though I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think you on another video,</v>

1627
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:15.920
<v Speaker 3>Arnold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forgotten his name.</v>

1628
01:08:15.921 --> 01:08:16.060
<v Speaker 3>He was</v>

1629
01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:20.750
<v Speaker 2>Russian and just shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean Eddie against the strength,</v>

1630
01:08:20.751 --> 01:08:23.880
<v Speaker 2>especially with the dead lift such as </v>
<v Speaker 2>simple movement and,</v>

1631
01:08:23.881 --> 01:08:24.714
<v Speaker 2>and you know the dead lift is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength is your body's ability to </v>

1632
01:08:27.291 --> 01:08:30.620
<v Speaker 2>generate force in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's neuro Musculus like what your,</v>

1633
01:08:30.621 --> 01:08:31.454
<v Speaker 2>your brain is telling your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that goes back to that strength </v>

1634
01:08:33.321 --> 01:08:34.154
<v Speaker 2>deficit that we were talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your basically santee or your body </v>

1635
01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:37.873
<v Speaker 2>recruit every single muscle fiber </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible and working conjunctions with </v>

1636
01:08:41.781 --> 01:08:45.590
<v Speaker 2>ligaments and tendons and then let's get</v>
<v Speaker 2>half a ton off the floor.</v>

1637
01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:48.410
<v Speaker 2>Exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you look,</v>

1638
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:50.390
<v Speaker 2>and certainly with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Andy Barnes,</v>

1639
01:08:50.391 --> 01:08:54.230
<v Speaker 2>a thousand pound lift,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had his friend in his face and he's,</v>

1640
01:08:54.231 --> 01:08:55.064
<v Speaker 2>they're going to come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go and he's hitting him in the face </v>

1641
01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:01.060
<v Speaker 2>when we were talking earlier about </v>
<v Speaker 2>against strength deficits is,</v>

1642
01:09:01.061 --> 01:09:01.894
<v Speaker 2>is that sort of deficit between what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can voluntarily contract an involuntary </v>

1643
01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:09.960
<v Speaker 2>contract that was him obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily can drag there.</v>

1644
01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.690
<v Speaker 2>No one was alleged human that pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular one.</v>

1645
01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:12.793
<v Speaker 2>But they're there and you do anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can before you actually step </v>

1646
01:09:15.531 --> 01:09:17.600
<v Speaker 2>out onto that platform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now,</v>

1647
01:09:17.601 --> 01:09:18.434
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would have just been completely </v>

1648
01:09:19.731 --> 01:09:22.550
<v Speaker 2>written off after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of Adrenal dump afterwards.</v>

1649
01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:23.570
<v Speaker 2>He'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1650
01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:25.100
<v Speaker 2>emotionally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1651
01:09:25.101 --> 01:09:27.370
<v Speaker 2>and so you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to think about that.</v>

1652
01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:29.570
<v Speaker 2>Have I forgotten who said it now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might have been prevail,</v>

1653
01:09:29.571 --> 01:09:30.404
<v Speaker 2>but they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1654
01:09:30.530 --> 01:09:31.363
<v Speaker 2>a safe fatigue for competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know you've spoken about that </v>

1655
01:09:33.411 --> 01:09:34.244
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1656
01:09:34.490 --> 01:09:35.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>

1657
01:09:35.901 --> 01:09:39.500
<v Speaker 2>He was speaking to levels are </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating guy with his concepts.</v>

1658
01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:40.880
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1659
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:42.440
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so ahead of the curve,</v>

1660
01:09:42.441 --> 01:09:44.510
<v Speaker 2>and I know you were talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember who it was now,</v>

1661
01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:49.010
<v Speaker 2>talking about farmers strength and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to stop short every single day.</v>

1662
01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:51.500
<v Speaker 2>So never necessarily going to complete </v>
<v Speaker 2>failure,</v>

1663
01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:54.350
<v Speaker 2>but it was for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for us a hobby,</v>

1664
01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:55.220
<v Speaker 2>I think it was.</v>

1665
01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:56.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1666
01:09:56.230 --> 01:09:57.063
<v Speaker 2>talking about continually kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>avoiding that exhaustion phase and </v>

1667
01:10:01.131 --> 01:10:04.790
<v Speaker 2>solely existing in the adaptation phase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1668
01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:05.361
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1669
01:10:05.361 --> 01:10:09.410
<v Speaker 2>this goes back to sell you sort of 1936,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Hungarian physician who found,</v>

1670
01:10:09.670 --> 01:10:11.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you give a,</v>

1671
01:10:11.181 --> 01:10:12.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took some lab rats,</v>

1672
01:10:12.261 --> 01:10:14.390
<v Speaker 2>give them a lethal dose of poison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kill over and die.</v>

1673
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:17.210
<v Speaker 2>But he found by giving them a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>of poison and a little bit more,</v>

1674
01:10:17.211 --> 01:10:19.550
<v Speaker 2>a little bit more that they built up </v>
<v Speaker 2>this intolerance to it.</v>

1675
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:21.800
<v Speaker 2>And that was the general adaptation </v>
<v Speaker 2>syndrome.</v>

1676
01:10:21.801 --> 01:10:22.634
<v Speaker 2>But it was from that that we discovered </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress and stimuli is the key to any </v>

1677
01:10:26.751 --> 01:10:27.584
<v Speaker 2>adaptation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't until the strength and </v>

1678
01:10:28.971 --> 01:10:30.710
<v Speaker 2>conditioning community cottoned on to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1679
01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:31.970
<v Speaker 2>And we started to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1680
01:10:31.971 --> 01:10:32.804
<v Speaker 2>how can we apply stress and stimulate to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the body to bring about a desired </v>

1681
01:10:35.091 --> 01:10:37.910
<v Speaker 2>result.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think certainly now,</v>

1682
01:10:37.911 --> 01:10:40.820
<v Speaker 2>I think that's kind of overlooked in </v>
<v Speaker 2>sport,</v>

1683
01:10:40.821 --> 01:10:42.920
<v Speaker 2>but certainly the Wida fitness industry </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1684
01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:43.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1685
01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:44.513
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy now in very sort of marketing </v>

1686
01:10:46.161 --> 01:10:48.410
<v Speaker 2>driven to say get fit in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1687
01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:51.500
<v Speaker 2>five easy steps or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas the reality is,</v>

1688
01:10:51.650 --> 01:10:53.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's get fit in eight months after a lot</v>

1689
01:10:53.931 --> 01:10:54.764
<v Speaker 2>of stress and stimuli,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then get fit in five easy steps is </v>

1690
01:10:57.861 --> 01:10:58.694
<v Speaker 2>really just for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a gimmick to get people who </v>

1691
01:11:00.951 --> 01:11:03.620
<v Speaker 2>don't actually work out to get involved.</v>

1692
01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:04.701
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1693
01:11:04.701 --> 01:11:04.990
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1694
01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:06.680
<v Speaker 2>and that's why I love what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcast.</v>

1695
01:11:06.681 --> 01:11:08.570
<v Speaker 2>And even with the sober October and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1696
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:10.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge fan of burt,</v>

1697
01:11:10.161 --> 01:11:11.850
<v Speaker 2>but people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know he's,</v>

1698
01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 2>he's so funny and loves Berg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1699
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:16.320
<v Speaker 3>he's a beast as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1700
01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:18.890
<v Speaker 3>when it to rock up and just do a </v>
<v Speaker 3>marathon and again,</v>

1701
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:19.783
<v Speaker 3>that's a power to weight ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What he did was amazing and I've say </v>

1702
01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:25.870
<v Speaker 3>he's really fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying,</v>

1703
01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:29.910
<v Speaker 3>I would never say Oh was okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wink wink.</v>

1704
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:32.650
<v Speaker 3>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

1705
01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.040
<v Speaker 3>He's a burly guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a well built a nice way.</v>

1706
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:39.630
<v Speaker 3>He's a well built mail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody took a picture of my face,</v>

1707

<v Speaker 3>I'm burns body and I was fucking threw </v>
<v Speaker 3>up or what if I were there?</v>

1708

<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he likes</v>

1710

<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

1711
01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:51.183
<v Speaker 5>he is a beast because he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>despite the fact that he doesn't look </v>

1712
01:11:53.771 --> 01:11:57.280
<v Speaker 5>like rich roll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's still can keep going.</v>

1713
01:11:57.370 --> 01:11:57.911
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1714
01:11:57.911 --> 01:11:58.631
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

1715
01:11:58.631 --> 01:12:00.280
<v Speaker 3>he was very entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did the marathon and stuff,</v>

1716
01:12:00.281 --> 01:12:03.700
<v Speaker 3>but I was actually watching that as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sport's scientist in me was like,</v>

1717
01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:06.130
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And no one's talking about that.</v>

1718
01:12:06.131 --> 01:12:07.750
<v Speaker 3>His,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his power to weight ratio and he's still</v>

1719
01:12:07.751 --> 01:12:10.350
<v Speaker 3>running that raffin something that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>

1720
01:12:10.351 --> 01:12:12.590
<v Speaker 3>so first as funny and as entertaining </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1721
01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.320
<v Speaker 3>it was to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I honestly was like Bert,</v>

1722
01:12:14.321 --> 01:12:15.130
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>

1723
01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:18.760
<v Speaker 5>What's more amazing is Ari honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause Ari really didn't work out.</v>

1724
01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:22.990
<v Speaker 5>Ari came in second place and he came in </v>
<v Speaker 5>second place by only a thousand points,</v>

1725
01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:26.680
<v Speaker 5>which is a one day I got a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 5>points in a day.</v>

1726
01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:30.220
<v Speaker 5>So he was really only a thousand points </v>
<v Speaker 5>behind me but it's a crazy day.</v>

1727
01:12:30.221 --> 01:12:34.110
<v Speaker 5>That's like a seven hours of work in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>day or so.</v>

1728
01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:38.230
<v Speaker 5>At least six and a half hours of work in</v>
<v Speaker 5>a day and a lot of it at 80% of your max</v>

1729
01:12:38.231 --> 01:12:39.730
<v Speaker 5>heart rate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he still,</v>

1730
01:12:39.970 --> 01:12:40.803
<v Speaker 5>he wasn't doing anything before this </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing started and he was the first one </v>

1731
01:12:45.191 --> 01:12:46.024
<v Speaker 5>to figure out that you get the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>amount of points for 80% of your Max </v>

1732
01:12:48.671 --> 01:12:49.504
<v Speaker 5>heart rate as you do for 90 I thought </v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd get more for 90 so I was just </v>

1733
01:12:51.911 --> 01:12:52.744
<v Speaker 5>trying to kill myself every day and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was only being able to come out with </v>

1734
01:12:55.931 --> 01:12:59.980
<v Speaker 5>like 230 points and and similar along </v>
<v Speaker 5>those lines,</v>

1735
01:12:59.981 --> 01:13:01.750
<v Speaker 5>because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would max out,</v>

1736
01:13:01.751 --> 01:13:05.200
<v Speaker 5>it was doing like 90% of my max heart </v>
<v Speaker 5>rate for like 30 35 minutes.</v>

1737
01:13:05.201 --> 01:13:06.034
<v Speaker 5>I was like exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then Ari figured out that 80 points </v>

1738
01:13:10.031 --> 01:13:11.460
<v Speaker 5>pays just as much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1739
01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:15.300
<v Speaker 5>And so he started watching movies while </v>
<v Speaker 5>he was on an elliptical machine and that</v>

1740
01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:19.510
<v Speaker 5>that just turned the whole thing into </v>
<v Speaker 5>this sort of steady,</v>

1741
01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:20.733
<v Speaker 5>not fast marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was really fascinating because I </v>

1742
01:13:24.971 --> 01:13:25.804
<v Speaker 5>never exercised like that before and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>changed my endurance radically over a </v>

1743
01:13:29.921 --> 01:13:30.754
<v Speaker 5>month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's interesting is that changed my </v>

1744
01:13:32.561 --> 01:13:35.680
<v Speaker 5>endurance in things that are explosive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like kickboxing.</v>

1745
01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:40.690
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's it say having that aerobic base a</v>

1746
01:13:40.691 --> 01:13:42.590
<v Speaker 3>lot?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did he</v>

1747
01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:45.030
<v Speaker 5>set in?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I would do,</v>

1748
01:13:45.031 --> 01:13:45.864
<v Speaker 5>I would do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>after a while we were doing so much </v>

1749
01:13:48.331 --> 01:13:51.060
<v Speaker 5>exercise and I had to do different </v>
<v Speaker 5>things or I would get bored.</v>

1750
01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:52.223
<v Speaker 5>So I would do a circuit of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>elliptical machine and then I would </v>

1751
01:13:55.081 --> 01:13:57.750
<v Speaker 5>follow the elliptical machine with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1752
01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:58.860
<v Speaker 5>a war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or I would do,</v>

1753
01:13:58.861 --> 01:14:02.310
<v Speaker 5>I would run on Sundays,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd either run elliptical machine,</v>

1754
01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:03.173
<v Speaker 5>kickbox,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and on other days I would do the echo </v>

1755
01:14:05.911 --> 01:14:06.744
<v Speaker 5>bike,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is an airdyne machine that rogue </v>

1756
01:14:08.131 --> 01:14:08.964
<v Speaker 5>makes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I would do the rowing machine </v>

1757
01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.550
<v Speaker 5>and then I would do the versaclimber</v>

1758
01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:16.420
<v Speaker 3>and then I added in that air runner </v>
<v Speaker 3>treadmill,</v>

1759
01:14:16.570 --> 01:14:17.920
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it called?</v>

1760
01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:19.460
<v Speaker 3>Air Assault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1761
01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:20.500
<v Speaker 3>Air Assault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Treadmill.</v>

1762
01:14:20.530 --> 01:14:21.363
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is a treadmill that you power </v>

1763
01:14:22.331 --> 01:14:23.560
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1764
01:14:23.561 --> 01:14:24.394
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your feet pushing on it and pulling it </v>

1765
01:14:27.071 --> 01:14:27.904
<v Speaker 3>is what makes it go fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a treadmill that you keep </v>

1766
01:14:30.101 --> 01:14:32.290
<v Speaker 3>up with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually more difficult than actual</v>

1767
01:14:32.291 --> 01:14:32.911
<v Speaker 3>running.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

1768
01:14:32.911 --> 01:14:33.320
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1769
01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:36.220
<v Speaker 3>13% more difficult and actual running on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the street.</v>

1770
01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:37.653
<v Speaker 3>So I d I was going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do the same things over and </v>

1771
01:14:41.321 --> 01:14:42.154
<v Speaker 3>over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I kept mixing them up and when I </v>

1772
01:14:43.481 --> 01:14:45.790
<v Speaker 3>would mix them up by the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>month,</v>

1773
01:14:46.090 --> 01:14:49.630
<v Speaker 3>my kickboxing was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had way more endurance.</v>

1774
01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:50.793
<v Speaker 3>Like I could do 10 hard rounds going </v>
<v Speaker 3>three minutes each round and then I </v>

1775
01:14:55.211 --> 01:14:56.044
<v Speaker 3>would recover in between rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The one minute in between rounds I'd </v>

1776
01:14:58.301 --> 01:14:59.134
<v Speaker 3>recover quick cause I'm wearing a heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>rate monitor and watching my heart rate </v>

1777
01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:02.913
<v Speaker 3>dip.</v>

1778
01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:03.783
<v Speaker 3>It was dipping really quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I had all this energy and </v>

1779
01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:09.370
<v Speaker 3>madness like everything was changing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my,</v>

1780
01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:12.970
<v Speaker 3>my capacity for work changed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything adapted.</v>

1781
01:15:13.630 --> 01:15:15.610
<v Speaker 3>I got a little dehydrated one time and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>had pissed.</v>

1782
01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:17.500
<v Speaker 3>It looked like ice tea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not good.</v>

1783
01:15:17.501 --> 01:15:22.501
<v Speaker 3>So I started panicking and wondering </v>
<v Speaker 3>about things like rob dough,</v>

1784
01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:23.433
<v Speaker 3>my locis kidney failure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't have anything wrong with </v>

1785
01:15:25.721 --> 01:15:27.910
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just a little bit of penetration.</v>

1786
01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:28.773
<v Speaker 3>But what's interesting to go about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we were talking about that you've </v>

1787
01:15:29.981 --> 01:15:32.590
<v Speaker 3>just perfectly described,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that idea of,</v>

1788
01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.780
<v Speaker 3>of given a clear cellular signal to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

1789
01:15:34.781 --> 01:15:38.260
<v Speaker 3>So polarized training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you know the 80 20 that you do,</v>

1790
01:15:38.261 --> 01:15:39.510
<v Speaker 3>80% of your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1791
01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:40.363
<v Speaker 3>your work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your training in that aerobic realm </v>

1792
01:15:41.981 --> 01:15:43.530
<v Speaker 3>where you can keep doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1793
01:15:43.630 --> 01:15:44.463
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to overtrain there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to avoid that exhaustion </v>

1794
01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:49.180
<v Speaker 3>things he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Salvia indestructable rats,</v>

1795
01:15:49.181 --> 01:15:50.014
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to keel over and die </v>

1796
01:15:50.621 --> 01:15:53.410
<v Speaker 3>from a lethal dose of stress and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stimuli.</v>

1797
01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:54.713
<v Speaker 3>But then over here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you would that 20% it was </v>

1798
01:15:57.371 --> 01:15:58.720
<v Speaker 3>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was kickboxing.</v>

1799
01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:01.120
<v Speaker 3>So there you're working technique but </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fresh.</v>

1800
01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:02.093
<v Speaker 3>So you're drilling motor patterns that </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely fresh and not fatigued </v>

1801
01:16:04.511 --> 01:16:05.344
<v Speaker 3>because you're doing this 80% on an </v>
<v Speaker 3>elliptical trainer while watching a </v>

1802
01:16:08.051 --> 01:16:09.400
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you teach,</v>

1803
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:11.470
<v Speaker 3>you're keeping the two completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>separate.</v>

1804
01:16:11.471 --> 01:16:14.530
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But considering the body in its entirety</v>

1805
01:16:14.531 --> 01:16:15.364
<v Speaker 3>that when it comes together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've created a more powerful version </v>

1806
01:16:18.401 --> 01:16:19.234
<v Speaker 3>of yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it was interesting what you </v>

1807
01:16:20.981 --> 01:16:24.190
<v Speaker 3>just said there about recovery between </v>
<v Speaker 3>bouts as well.</v>

1808
01:16:24.490 --> 01:16:27.220
<v Speaker 3>So when you start looking at a strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>man training,</v>

1809
01:16:27.221 --> 01:16:28.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1810
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:29.223
<v Speaker 3>some of the strongest guys and that one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the strongest guys in the world all </v>

1811
01:16:32.141 --> 01:16:35.530
<v Speaker 3>understood the benefits of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of cardio spiritually training.</v>

1812
01:16:35.531 --> 01:16:37.180
<v Speaker 3>You look at you again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>geoff capes.</v>

1813
01:16:37.390 --> 01:16:38.223
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two time world's strongest man was </v>

1814
01:16:39.191 --> 01:16:43.620
<v Speaker 3>running fell racism marathons at 25.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fillery's fellow races.</v>

1815
01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:44.561
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1816
01:16:44.561 --> 01:16:47.440
<v Speaker 3>it's quite specific to England.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of trail running,</v>

1817
01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:48.783
<v Speaker 3>but we call them fellow running because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to going through bogs and </v>

1818
01:16:51.221 --> 01:16:54.090
<v Speaker 3>marshes and felled trees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>

1819
01:16:54.340 --> 01:16:57.400
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily fell cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just kind of the terrain is a little</v>

1820
01:16:57.401 --> 01:16:59.380
<v Speaker 3>bit different from Troy said he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing that.</v>

1821
01:16:59.381 --> 01:17:02.650
<v Speaker 3>When you look at our Bill Kasman again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the strongest man a power lifter,</v>

1822
01:17:02.651 --> 01:17:03.484
<v Speaker 3>but understood the benefits of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of cardiorespiratory trying to improve </v>

1823
01:17:06.191 --> 01:17:08.710
<v Speaker 3>his recovery between sets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian Shaw as well.</v>

1824
01:17:08.711 --> 01:17:09.411
<v Speaker 3>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1825
01:17:09.411 --> 01:17:10.244
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sort of,</v>

1826
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:11.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1827
01:17:11.361 --> 01:17:14.360
<v Speaker 2>the newest as sort of strong man and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>former basketball player,</v>

1828
01:17:14.570 --> 01:17:15.403
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he had that cardio respiratory </v>

1829
01:17:17.481 --> 01:17:18.314
<v Speaker 2>endurance that base the aerobic base,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he built this incredible </v>

1830
01:17:22.311 --> 01:17:27.311
<v Speaker 2>strength on top of that aerobic </v>
<v Speaker 2>foundation goes back again to whether,</v>

1831
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:29.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they knew it or not,</v>

1832
01:17:29.361 --> 01:17:30.194
<v Speaker 2>they were almost creating an athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they were creating athletes back </v>

1833
01:17:32.721 --> 01:17:33.510
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1834
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:36.350
<v Speaker 2>the sort of Soviet Union era when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were taking athletes going,</v>

1835
01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:37.393
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're giving me a kid and I don't know </v>

1836
01:17:38.751 --> 01:17:40.520
<v Speaker 2>if he's strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick,</v>

1837
01:17:40.521 --> 01:17:42.190
<v Speaker 2>good at running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>running fast or running fight,</v>

1838
01:17:42.191 --> 01:17:43.024
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to build this aerobic </v>

1839
01:17:44.811 --> 01:17:45.644
<v Speaker 2>neuromuscular base and when they show </v>
<v Speaker 2>any sort of genetic potential to be </v>

1840
01:17:49.551 --> 01:17:50.480
<v Speaker 2>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick,</v>

1841
01:17:50.481 --> 01:17:52.130
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to hone in on that.</v>

1842
01:17:52.131 --> 01:17:54.350
<v Speaker 2>And that's only when we're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific.</v>

1843
01:17:54.710 --> 01:17:57.050
<v Speaker 2>And you're almost doing that now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1844
01:17:57.051 --> 01:17:58.610
<v Speaker 2>and certainly Brian Schorr did it again.</v>

1845
01:17:58.610 --> 01:17:59.443
<v Speaker 2>You look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look through all of the best </v>

1846
01:18:01.101 --> 01:18:03.830
<v Speaker 2>athletes in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've all followed this blueprint,</v>

1847
01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:07.100
<v Speaker 2>but it's only now that we're kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dissecting that and saying,</v>

1848
01:18:07.101 --> 01:18:09.140
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm making it a bit more purposeful.</v>

1849
01:18:09.230 --> 01:18:10.520
<v Speaker 2>Who's this gentlemen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we go,</v>

1850
01:18:10.521 --> 01:18:12.380
<v Speaker 2>there's Brian Shore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1851
01:18:12.381 --> 01:18:14.750
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bass run with his legs were all swollen,</v>

1852
01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:18.470
<v Speaker 2>but I mean even now I tell you what </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

1853
01:18:18.471 --> 01:18:19.490
<v Speaker 2>if it's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

1854
01:18:19.491 --> 01:18:22.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean Brian Shore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he accidentally,</v>

1855
01:18:22.761 --> 01:18:25.760
<v Speaker 2>you must have seen this clip set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the indoor rowing record.</v>

1856
01:18:25.761 --> 01:18:28.490
<v Speaker 2>I think it was for a hook in this size </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this mother fucker.</v>

1857
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he rocks.</v>

1858
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Converse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All stars.</v>

1859
01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

1860
01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:37.540
<v Speaker 2>He set the visit visit clip on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That memo man's wearing chucks.</v>

1861
01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:39.253
<v Speaker 2>He sets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a clip on youtube where he sets </v>

1862
01:18:40.731 --> 01:18:42.140
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rowing record,</v>

1863
01:18:42.141 --> 01:18:45.470
<v Speaker 2>the indoor rowing record and it was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he,</v>

1864
01:18:45.471 --> 01:18:46.280
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there we go.</v>

1865
01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:49.880
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know he was setting in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these basically down there,</v>

1866
01:18:49.881 --> 01:18:54.881
<v Speaker 2>he's rowing and it sounds like someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>started an engine like this.</v>

1867
01:18:55.791 --> 01:18:57.920
<v Speaker 2>He go and we're here at this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said this,</v>

1868
01:18:57.921 --> 01:18:59.750
<v Speaker 2>they've just looked at how he rose to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mountain.</v>

1869
01:18:59.830 --> 01:19:00.663
<v Speaker 6>These look the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have to hold it down in the end </v>

1870
01:19:03.191 --> 01:19:06.160
<v Speaker 6>cause he's coming out of the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ.</v>

1871
01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:08.640
<v Speaker 6>These guys are standing on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It sounds like,</v>

1872
01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:11.200
<v Speaker 6>like just an that's a jet engine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1873
01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.150
<v Speaker 6>We're all that power from it.</v>

1874
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well no and he's bad.</v>

1875
01:19:15.301 --> 01:19:16.134
<v Speaker 2>I mean that technique as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I hope Brian doesn't mind me </v>

1876
01:19:18.571 --> 01:19:20.830
<v Speaker 2>saying it's not necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1877
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:21.833
<v Speaker 2>Olympic rowing technique,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't need it cause he's just </v>

1878
01:19:24.361 --> 01:19:25.194
<v Speaker 2>got silly power technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the hundred well there's a catch </v>

1879
01:19:29.461 --> 01:19:30.294
<v Speaker 2>phase and it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're almost treating it more like a </v>

1880
01:19:32.881 --> 01:19:35.730
<v Speaker 2>dead lift where you're using your larger</v>
<v Speaker 2>leg muscles where,</v>

1881
01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:36.370
<v Speaker 2>which is</v>

1882
01:19:36.370 --> 01:19:37.400
<v Speaker 6>look at him go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there you go.</v>

1883
01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:42.840
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck it.</v>

1884
01:19:42.850 --> 01:19:43.683
<v Speaker 6>Savage.</v>

1885
01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:45.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To Watch.</v>

1886
01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:48.360
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable amount of force he can </v>
<v Speaker 2>generate.</v>

1887
01:19:48.361 --> 01:19:50.850
<v Speaker 2>He looks like a very tall man too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's huge.</v>

1888
01:19:51.210 --> 01:19:53.190
<v Speaker 2>How big is this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six eight,</v>

1889
01:19:53.191 --> 01:19:54.050
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine.</v>

1890
01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:55.350
<v Speaker 2>So that helps too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1891
01:19:55.351 --> 01:19:57.040
<v Speaker 2>Cause the long stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolute.</v>

1892
01:19:57.041 --> 01:19:58.770
<v Speaker 2>It's just pure power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

1893
01:19:58.771 --> 01:20:00.480
<v Speaker 2>so they found that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during this session,</v>

1894
01:20:00.481 --> 01:20:01.314
<v Speaker 2>I believe what happened is they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you know a rower shouldn't make </v>

1895
01:20:04.621 --> 01:20:06.900
<v Speaker 2>that sort of noisy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes six ways that he's basically two</v>

1896
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:12.350
<v Speaker 2>put together for what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>401 600 8,425</v>

1897
01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:17.430
<v Speaker 2>that's two big guys strapped together in</v>
<v Speaker 2>one body.</v>

1898
01:20:17.431 --> 01:20:21.960
<v Speaker 2>He's almost 200 pounds above the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight limit.</v>

1899
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:23.423
<v Speaker 2>Deon saying that is UFC heavyweight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>limit it to 65 he's almost 200 pounds </v>

1900
01:20:29.551 --> 01:20:34.551
<v Speaker 2>too heavy to fight heavyweight division </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the UFC motherfucker basketball,</v>

1901
01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:35.950
<v Speaker 2>basketball background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1902
01:20:35.951 --> 01:20:36.870
<v Speaker 2>and he's still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1903
01:20:36.871 --> 01:20:39.180
<v Speaker 2>he didn't know that he was going to set </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world record for rowing.</v>

1904
01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:40.260
<v Speaker 2>So the rowing record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>

1905
01:20:40.261 --> 01:20:41.094
<v Speaker 2>here's one was 12.8</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was 1308 broke the wrong </v>

1906
01:20:44.731 --> 01:20:45.564
<v Speaker 2>record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But because he had that neuro </v>

1907
01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:50.160
<v Speaker 2>neuromuscular background that they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Brian,</v>

1908
01:20:50.161 --> 01:20:52.590
<v Speaker 2>you're big and powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just this is a rowing machine.</v>

1909
01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:53.491
<v Speaker 2>He went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1910
01:20:53.491 --> 01:20:54.151
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1911
01:20:54.151 --> 01:20:54.751
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

1912
01:20:54.751 --> 01:20:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a world record.</v>

1913
01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:00.020
<v Speaker 2>So it's that base that I think so often </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard you speak about,</v>

1914
01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:01.620
<v Speaker 2>and certainly Eddie as well talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1915
01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:03.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breakdancers making great.</v>

1916
01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:05.910
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

1917
01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:08.640
<v Speaker 2>whether you knew or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had that neuromuscular foundation.</v>

1918
01:21:08.641 --> 01:21:11.250
<v Speaker 2>They understood proprioception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the ligaments,</v>

1919
01:21:11.251 --> 01:21:12.660
<v Speaker 2>tendons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything should work.</v>

1920
01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:14.153
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you had someone with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar work capacity or someone at the </v>

1921
01:21:16.291 --> 01:21:18.360
<v Speaker 2>same age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything was the same,</v>

1922
01:21:18.361 --> 01:21:20.670
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't have that neuromuscular </v>
<v Speaker 2>efficiency,</v>

1923
01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:21.600
<v Speaker 2>you'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1924
01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:22.291
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is me.</v>

1925
01:21:22.291 --> 01:21:23.350
<v Speaker 2>So naively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1926
01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:25.500
<v Speaker 2>I certainly don't claim to know anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Bjj,</v>

1927
01:21:25.501 --> 01:21:26.071
<v Speaker 2>but you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1928
01:21:26.071 --> 01:21:26.820
<v Speaker 2>this is an arm bar.</v>

1929
01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:28.080
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they kind of go,</v>

1930
01:21:28.081 --> 01:21:29.970
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me try and figure this out.</v>

1931
01:21:29.971 --> 01:21:31.800
<v Speaker 2>And you can see them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a Rubik's cube.</v>

1932
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:35.220
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to piece it together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you get someone again,</v>

1933
01:21:35.250 --> 01:21:37.020
<v Speaker 2>like Brian and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1934
01:21:37.021 --> 01:21:40.200
<v Speaker 2>this is Bj Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something quite complex that requires</v>

1935
01:21:40.201 --> 01:21:42.990
<v Speaker 2>you and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying he wouldn't even fight.</v>

1936
01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:44.310
<v Speaker 2>It's too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too heavy.</v>

1937
01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:47.100
<v Speaker 2>Then I have to open up the super heavy </v>
<v Speaker 2>division,</v>

1938
01:21:47.450 --> 01:21:49.830
<v Speaker 2>but he was doing a similar movement to </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead lifts,</v>

1939
01:21:49.831 --> 01:21:51.720
<v Speaker 2>which is very common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1940
01:21:51.721 --> 01:21:53.790
<v Speaker 2>And when he's used to that movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1941
01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:54.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1942
01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:57.420
<v Speaker 2>But I suppose where you saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that wasn't actually,</v>

1943
01:21:57.570 --> 01:22:00.510
<v Speaker 2>there was no extension of the back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was bent over.</v>

1944
01:22:00.511 --> 01:22:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Just repeat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's another one again,</v>

1945
01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:04.170
<v Speaker 2>even to use Brian is an example where he</v>
<v Speaker 2>does,</v>

1946
01:22:04.171 --> 01:22:05.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

1947
01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the name of the ward </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1948
01:22:07.170 --> 01:22:08.590
<v Speaker 2>but he went up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1949
01:22:08.850 --> 01:22:09.870
<v Speaker 2>and four as well.</v>

1950
01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:11.770
<v Speaker 2>Another strong man did a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1951
01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:14.490
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might clean and jerk.</v>

1952
01:22:14.491 --> 01:22:15.324
<v Speaker 2>There was a ward that was predominantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>clean and jerk and there's this amazing </v>

1953
01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:21.210
<v Speaker 2>crossfitter technique was beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disappearing under the bar,</v>

1954
01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:22.053
<v Speaker 2>back over his head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing to watch and I think it </v>

1955
01:22:23.911 --> 01:22:27.330
<v Speaker 2>was thor or Brian Shaw went in and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of a clean and jerk and Joe,</v>

1956
01:22:27.331 --> 01:22:30.210
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just basically upright rows,</v>

1957
01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:32.550
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing and complete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>

1958
01:22:32.551 --> 01:22:37.530
<v Speaker 2>well that's not clean and jerk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you just set a record again.</v>

1959
01:22:37.710 --> 01:22:40.920
<v Speaker 2>So there's that element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to use an example as well with,</v>

1960
01:22:40.921 --> 01:22:41.611
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1961
01:22:41.611 --> 01:22:42.720
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

1962
01:22:42.810 --> 01:22:44.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's insane.</v>

1963
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.020
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully it is a crop.</v>

1964
01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:47.520
<v Speaker 2>That is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1965
01:22:47.521 --> 01:22:48.960
<v Speaker 2>There's another strongly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is,</v>

1966
01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:53.400
<v Speaker 2>there's another one of those where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see the crossfit or with this amazing,</v>

1967
01:22:53.401 --> 01:22:54.234
<v Speaker 2>beautiful technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so far from his justice crazy that </v>

1968
01:22:58.561 --> 01:22:59.394
<v Speaker 2>he's doing it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what is that 225 pounds as though I </v>

1969
01:23:03.121 --> 01:23:05.880
<v Speaker 2>don't actually know what everything from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking</v>

1970
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:09.580
<v Speaker 3>shit that is so crazy that he could do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1971
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.900
<v Speaker 3>Look at how he's doing so many reps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1972
01:23:12.190 --> 01:23:14.350
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is insane.</v>

1973
01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.180
<v Speaker 3>But he doesn't have a pause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1974
01:23:16.181 --> 01:23:17.980
<v Speaker 3>but back he said that's meant to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>clean joke.</v>

1975
01:23:18.010 --> 01:23:18.843
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I mean about that neuro </v>

1976
01:23:20.091 --> 01:23:22.210
<v Speaker 3>muscular efficiency that he's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1977
01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:24.790
<v Speaker 3>here's a new sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come and get involved.</v>

1978
01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:25.471
<v Speaker 3>And he's going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1979
01:23:25.471 --> 01:23:26.304
<v Speaker 3>I see the rules of your sport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to do it my way and it </v>

1980
01:23:29.150 --> 01:23:30.550
<v Speaker 3>doesn't count.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1981
01:23:30.551 --> 01:23:31.480
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose,</v>

1982
01:23:31.481 --> 01:23:33.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean if that word is just put the </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight above your head,</v>

1983
01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:34.920
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like duck,</v>

1984
01:23:34.921 --> 01:23:36.960
<v Speaker 3>I did it normal that time right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1985
01:23:36.961 --> 01:23:37.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1986
01:23:37.670 --> 01:23:38.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's,</v>

1987
01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:40.053
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1988
01:23:40.610 --> 01:23:41.470
<v Speaker 2>if you put in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1989
01:23:41.490 --> 01:23:43.190
<v Speaker 2>thor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1990
01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:44.053
<v Speaker 2>versus crossfit there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it will probably come up and you </v>

1991
01:23:45.321 --> 01:23:49.250
<v Speaker 2>get to see an amazing crisp technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then equally,</v>

1992
01:23:49.370 --> 01:23:52.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thor is basically doing what,</v>

1993
01:23:52.121 --> 01:23:54.820
<v Speaker 2>what Brian was doing just there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll you go.</v>

1994
01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:57.440
<v Speaker 2>So this is their keep putting on weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>until one of them.</v>

1995
01:23:57.441 --> 01:23:59.270
<v Speaker 2>I believe that competition as you keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>it or not.</v>

1996
01:23:59.271 --> 01:24:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're your crossfit versus a mountain.</v>

1997
01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:02.930
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing technique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disappears under the bar,</v>

1998
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:04.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible.</v>

1999
01:24:04.101 --> 01:24:05.110
<v Speaker 2>And then I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2000
01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:05.993
<v Speaker 2>thor would eventually come in and give </v>
<v Speaker 2>it a go and basically just I'm upright </v>

2001
01:24:08.841 --> 01:24:09.950
<v Speaker 2>rows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>

2002
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:11.840
<v Speaker 2>So you saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2003
01:24:11.841 --> 01:24:14.240
<v Speaker 2>disappears under the bus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speed of movement.</v>

2004
01:24:14.330 --> 01:24:16.180
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all come,</v>

2005
01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:18.470
<v Speaker 2>come and have a go at this and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what he,</v>

2006
01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:20.330
<v Speaker 2>he produces.</v>

2007
01:24:23.690 --> 01:24:26.990
<v Speaker 3>So there's that neuromuscular </v>
<v Speaker 3>efficiency.</v>

2008
01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.360
<v Speaker 3>There was just mad strength.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

2009
01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:29.880
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

2010
01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:31.800
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could do that too if you just had an</v>

2011
01:24:31.801 --> 01:24:34.080
<v Speaker 5>empty bar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

2012
01:24:34.081 --> 01:24:37.080
<v Speaker 5>Like that kind of person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The kind of person that can do that.</v>

2013
01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:40.950
<v Speaker 5>When you think about him dead lifting a </v>
<v Speaker 5>thousand pounds or any of these guys who</v>

2014
01:24:40.951 --> 01:24:41.784
<v Speaker 5>can deadlift in insane numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just the whole machine can generate so </v>

2015
01:24:46.021 --> 01:24:46.854
<v Speaker 5>much force.</v>

2016
01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2017
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:49.750
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's it though.</v>

2018
01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:50.590
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

2019
01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:53.800
<v Speaker 2>They're able to do that again because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that foundation.</v>

2020
01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:56.980
<v Speaker 2>They body can generate that force and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you say,</v>

2021
01:24:56.981 --> 01:24:57.814
<v Speaker 2>here's a new movement and you can see </v>
<v Speaker 2>them look like for that example of a </v>

2022
01:25:01.121 --> 01:25:02.350
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a clean and jerk.</v>

2023
01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't figure that out.</v>

2024
01:25:03.850 --> 01:25:05.080
<v Speaker 2>I think I've found a way,</v>

2025
01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:06.913
<v Speaker 5>lends credence to the concept that dead </v>
<v Speaker 5>lifts is like the mother of all </v>

2026
01:25:10.071 --> 01:25:10.904
<v Speaker 5>exercises because it really does work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All your muscle groups and if you can </v>

2027
01:25:14.031 --> 01:25:18.020
<v Speaker 5>get really strong at dead lifts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it really does enhance almost any</v>

2028
01:25:18.021 --> 01:25:20.240
<v Speaker 5>single athletic endeavor you participate</v>
<v Speaker 5>in.</v>

2029
01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:21.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2030
01:25:21.171 --> 01:25:22.004
<v Speaker 2>And I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of been lost a little bit </v>

2031
01:25:24.291 --> 01:25:26.630
<v Speaker 2>along the way that they're getting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>joints,</v>

2032
01:25:26.631 --> 01:25:27.291
<v Speaker 2>ligaments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>muscles,</v>

2033
01:25:27.291 --> 01:25:30.800
<v Speaker 2>everything to work cohesively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you do that for your training,</v>

2034
01:25:30.801 --> 01:25:33.830
<v Speaker 2>you can pretty much apply to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's why,</v>

2035
01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:37.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean I again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to swim ages ages ago,</v>

2036
01:25:37.071 --> 01:25:40.170
<v Speaker 2>way back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was never going to make sort of an</v>

2037
01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:42.200
<v Speaker 2>elite standard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm five,</v>

2038
01:25:42.201 --> 01:25:44.360
<v Speaker 2>nine on a good day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm built like a hobbit.</v>

2039
01:25:44.361 --> 01:25:44.860
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2040
01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:49.010
<v Speaker 3>everyone else is just great grace for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2041
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.760
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

2042
01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:50.593
<v Speaker 2>I ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again almost accidentally going into </v>

2043
01:25:52.671 --> 01:25:55.460
<v Speaker 2>strength training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I played water polo in the end,</v>

2044
01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:57.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a fairly good level.</v>

2045
01:25:57.861 --> 01:25:59.960
<v Speaker 2>So I was doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again I just got beaten up.</v>

2046
01:25:59.961 --> 01:26:00.794
<v Speaker 2>I was 16 playing in the senior's league </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you just big guys with beards just </v>

2047
01:26:04.761 --> 01:26:05.594
<v Speaker 2>beating me up.</v>

2048
01:26:06.570 --> 01:26:07.403
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting what you were talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about earlier in terms of mental </v>

2049
01:26:10.741 --> 01:26:14.400
<v Speaker 5>fortitude and your ability to adapt and </v>
<v Speaker 5>your ability to overcome.</v>

2050
01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:18.360
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if we're ever going to figure </v>
<v Speaker 5>out a way to measure that.</v>

2051
01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:19.513
<v Speaker 5>Like to measure in d mental endurance or</v>
<v Speaker 5>measure mental capacity or mental </v>

2052
01:26:24.241 --> 01:26:25.430
<v Speaker 5>stimulation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2053
01:26:25.450 --> 01:26:29.940
<v Speaker 5>you can measure your vo two Max and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know what the body's capable of.</v>

2054
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:35.130
<v Speaker 5>But I wonder if there's a way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when someone does hear a great song</v>

2055
01:26:35.131 --> 01:26:35.964
<v Speaker 5>and it kicks in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's through Fsri or any other </v>

2056
01:26:38.341 --> 01:26:41.360
<v Speaker 5>type of detection device where they can </v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out a way,</v>

2057
01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:46.400
<v Speaker 5>oh this part of your brain is firing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's concentrate on building up the,</v>

2058
01:26:46.711 --> 01:26:49.680
<v Speaker 5>the activation of that part of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>brain of the brain.</v>

2059
01:26:49.681 --> 01:26:51.930
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like muscle when like,</v>

2060
01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:53.753
<v Speaker 5>think of that endurance or think of that</v>
<v Speaker 5>motivation as like maybe even a mantra </v>

2061
01:26:59.071 --> 01:26:59.904
<v Speaker 5>that you can call upon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause he call upon it all the time and </v>

2062
01:27:02.081 --> 01:27:03.750
<v Speaker 5>he can recreate that state.</v>

2063
01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:04.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2064
01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:06.160
<v Speaker 2>I think on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that point,</v>

2065
01:27:06.190 --> 01:27:08.110
<v Speaker 2>certainly over in Britain at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2066
01:27:08.111 --> 01:27:09.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2067
01:27:09.250 --> 01:27:10.050
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2068
01:27:10.050 --> 01:27:13.750
<v Speaker 2>a women for the first time can actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>apply and be in the special forces.</v>

2069
01:27:14.050 --> 01:27:14.883
<v Speaker 2>So at the moment is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting because I'm speaking </v>

2070
01:27:17.591 --> 01:27:19.870
<v Speaker 2>to you certainly the Royal Marines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were saying,</v>

2071
01:27:20.410 --> 01:27:24.640
<v Speaker 2>we've got hundreds of years that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand is 500 young fit men,</v>

2072
01:27:25.090 --> 01:27:27.310
<v Speaker 2>we can say they need to be this weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this tall.</v>

2073
01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:28.593
<v Speaker 2>And if you give as them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got years and years of experience </v>

2074
01:27:30.761 --> 01:27:34.750
<v Speaker 2>of putting them through this training </v>
<v Speaker 2>system of mental and physical fortitude,</v>

2075
01:27:34.751 --> 01:27:36.460
<v Speaker 2>everything down in lympstone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

2076
01:27:36.461 --> 01:27:37.294
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the training center of the Royal </v>

2077
01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Marines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we go on this insurance costs,</v>

2078
01:27:40.061 --> 01:27:41.980
<v Speaker 2>we go on a 30 mile young with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>backpack,</v>

2079
01:27:42.010 --> 01:27:44.320
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the end of 32 weeks,</v>

2080
01:27:44.321 --> 01:27:45.154
<v Speaker 2>that's what it takes to be a royal </v>
<v Speaker 2>marine to get your green baret after 32 </v>

2081
01:27:48.011 --> 01:27:50.740
<v Speaker 2>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can take you from being completely,</v>

2082
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:53.770
<v Speaker 2>not sedan tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but unfit to being a royal marine.</v>

2083
01:27:53.770 --> 01:27:55.270
<v Speaker 2>And that's one thing they pride </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves on.</v>

2084
01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:58.540
<v Speaker 2>But now what they're saying is </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

2085
01:27:58.541 --> 01:28:00.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>females can apply to the special forces.</v>

2086
01:28:00.341 --> 01:28:03.850
<v Speaker 2>And what they find so interesting is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I certainly do as well,</v>

2087
01:28:03.851 --> 01:28:04.684
<v Speaker 2>is what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that look like for a female </v>

2088
01:28:06.821 --> 01:28:07.690
<v Speaker 2>role marine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2089
01:28:07.691 --> 01:28:09.820
<v Speaker 2>what does that look like for the themes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

2090
01:28:09.821 --> 01:28:10.840
<v Speaker 2>to go back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2091
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:13.320
<v Speaker 2>I wrote an article ages ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2092
01:28:13.930 --> 01:28:17.110
<v Speaker 2>run like a girl and I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to run like a girl.</v>

2093
01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:17.711
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them,</v>

2094
01:28:17.711 --> 01:28:20.020
<v Speaker 2>some of my best training partners are </v>
<v Speaker 2>female and they,</v>

2095
01:28:20.290 --> 01:28:23.680
<v Speaker 2>their perception to fatigue is </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable.</v>

2096
01:28:23.681 --> 01:28:25.480
<v Speaker 2>That's purely anecdotal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also as well,</v>

2097
01:28:25.481 --> 01:28:28.690
<v Speaker 2>when you look at the top tier of ultra </v>
<v Speaker 2>marathon runners and swimming as well,</v>

2098
01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Diana Niaid first to go from Florida to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuba to Florida,</v>

2099
01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:34.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible.</v>

2100
01:28:34.511 --> 01:28:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Like she was getting stung by Portuguese</v>
<v Speaker 2>manowar's and stuff.</v>

2101
01:28:37.180 --> 01:28:39.570
<v Speaker 2>Just unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's purely debts,</v>

2102
01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:40.900
<v Speaker 2>but now the saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2103
01:28:41.170 --> 01:28:43.930
<v Speaker 2>w why is it that that certainly my </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes have a,</v>

2104
01:28:43.931 --> 01:28:47.830
<v Speaker 2>a greater tolerance to pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think to your point,</v>

2105
01:28:47.831 --> 01:28:48.664
<v Speaker 2>if we can start to quantify that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are biological </v>

2106
01:28:51.521 --> 01:28:52.990
<v Speaker 2>differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take men,</v>

2107
01:28:53.290 --> 01:28:56.080
<v Speaker 2>high testosterone can have an impact on </v>
<v Speaker 2>high hemoglobin,</v>

2108
01:28:56.081 --> 01:28:57.760
<v Speaker 2>generate muscle force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these things.</v>

2109
01:28:58.490 --> 01:28:59.323
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think if we could quantify why it </v>

2110
01:29:01.861 --> 01:29:01.980
<v Speaker 2>is</v>

2111
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:02.813
<v Speaker 5>that certain female athletes are </v>
<v Speaker 5>dominating the top 10% of ultra </v>

2112
01:29:06.661 --> 01:29:10.770
<v Speaker 5>marathons and an open water swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is it that they're doing that would</v>

2113
01:29:10.771 --> 01:29:14.370
<v Speaker 5>be amazing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the ability to endure pain,</v>

2114
01:29:15.090 --> 01:29:17.190
<v Speaker 5>and this is not my thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>honestly,</v>

2115
01:29:17.191 --> 01:29:20.310
<v Speaker 5>I should just say this has been </v>
<v Speaker 5>theorized before,</v>

2116
01:29:20.490 --> 01:29:24.300
<v Speaker 5>has to do with their ability to endure </v>
<v Speaker 5>the pain of childbirth,</v>

2117
01:29:24.690 --> 01:29:25.523
<v Speaker 5>child labor and childbirth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean just the fact that they're </v>

2118
01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:30.480
<v Speaker 5>forcing a baby out of their vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2119
01:29:30.570 --> 01:29:32.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean that is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2120
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:34.710
<v Speaker 5>we aren't too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever seen the machine?</v>

2121
01:29:34.711 --> 01:29:36.780
<v Speaker 5>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've taken these electrodes,</v>

2122
01:29:36.781 --> 01:29:37.614
<v Speaker 5>they put it on men and recreate the pain</v>
<v Speaker 5>of childbirth Ed and watch these men </v>

2123
01:29:43.231 --> 01:29:45.810
<v Speaker 5>funding to fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like fucking turn it off.</v>

2124
01:29:46.970 --> 01:29:47.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2125
01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:50.790
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean obviously I haven't given birth,</v>

2126
01:29:50.791 --> 01:29:51.624
<v Speaker 5>but it's supposed to be unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 5>painful and women are biologically </v>

2127
01:29:55.021 --> 01:29:56.070
<v Speaker 5>suited to this.</v>

2128
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.903
<v Speaker 5>This is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I think their ability to endure that </v>

2129
01:29:59.221 --> 01:30:02.580
<v Speaker 5>pain is just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's probably just,</v>

2130
01:30:02.610 --> 01:30:07.610
<v Speaker 5>there's an evolutionary advantage to </v>
<v Speaker 5>having this more higher capacity.</v>

2131
01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:08.873
<v Speaker 5>But I also think one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>I learned from teaching martial arts is </v>

2132
01:30:11.881 --> 01:30:15.780
<v Speaker 5>that women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they learned technique better many times</v>

2133
01:30:15.781 --> 01:30:20.370
<v Speaker 5>then men do because one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they listen and two,</v>

2134
01:30:20.371 --> 01:30:21.204
<v Speaker 5>they don't try to muscle things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So women have less of a problem with </v>

2135
01:30:25.141 --> 01:30:29.280
<v Speaker 5>learning something from a person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is also true about archery.</v>

2136
01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:31.470
<v Speaker 5>My friend John Dudley,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who is an archery coach,</v>

2137
01:30:31.471 --> 01:30:35.670
<v Speaker 5>says his favorite students are always </v>
<v Speaker 5>women because they listen better.</v>

2138
01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:37.590
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't have as much of an ego.</v>

2139
01:30:37.591 --> 01:30:39.360
<v Speaker 5>They don't have to pretend they already </v>
<v Speaker 5>know something.</v>

2140
01:30:39.361 --> 01:30:41.640
<v Speaker 5>They don't want to just try it without </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2141
01:30:41.641 --> 01:30:44.280
<v Speaker 5>They follow it to a t better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like generally,</v>

2142
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:45.780
<v Speaker 5>obviously we're speaking in </v>
<v Speaker 5>generalities,</v>

2143
01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:50.600
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they also don't have the uh,</v>

2144
01:30:50.730 --> 01:30:52.650
<v Speaker 5>extra muscle that a man has.</v>

2145
01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:54.420
<v Speaker 5>So men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they're strong,</v>

2146
01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:55.373
<v Speaker 5>we'll try to just force things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>muscle things where women will try to </v>

2147
01:30:58.471 --> 01:30:59.304
<v Speaker 5>follow what's being described to them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's the proper technique and they do </v>

2148
01:31:02.881 --> 01:31:03.714
<v Speaker 5>it properly all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they develop this pattern of </v>

2149
01:31:07.381 --> 01:31:08.214
<v Speaker 5>proper technique.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I noticed this with taekwondo and I </v>

2150
01:31:10.201 --> 01:31:12.020
<v Speaker 5>think my friend John said he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2151
01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:14.430
<v Speaker 5>he noticed this with archery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think this,</v>

2152
01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:15.293
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this benefits them in sports because </v>

2153
01:31:17.701 --> 01:31:21.510
<v Speaker 5>like if you learn Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you really the best people to learn from</v>

2154
01:31:21.511 --> 01:31:25.920
<v Speaker 5>our smaller men or women because they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the smaller people,</v>

2155
01:31:25.950 --> 01:31:29.250
<v Speaker 5>they don't have the physical strength to</v>
<v Speaker 5>pull it off on a big guy.</v>

2156
01:31:29.670 --> 01:31:32.640
<v Speaker 5>So what they have to rely on is correct </v>
<v Speaker 5>technique.</v>

2157
01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:35.820
<v Speaker 5>But if you learn Jujitsu from a big guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2158
01:31:35.821 --> 01:31:40.440
<v Speaker 5>big Guy Jujitsu's weird because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>could just grab your wrist and you can't</v>

2159
01:31:40.441 --> 01:31:41.274
<v Speaker 5>get go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't let go and they can get away </v>

2160
01:31:42.331 --> 01:31:43.320
<v Speaker 5>with things like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2161
01:31:43.321 --> 01:31:45.150
<v Speaker 5>you go risk control and throw the legs </v>
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

2162
01:31:45.330 --> 01:31:46.163
<v Speaker 5>Risk Control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay risk control on who try risk </v>

2163
01:31:49.561 --> 01:31:52.350
<v Speaker 5>control on that big mother fucker that </v>
<v Speaker 5>was rowing the world record.</v>

2164
01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:53.423
<v Speaker 5>You ain't getting shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to go flying through the </v>

2165
01:31:55.411 --> 01:31:56.990
<v Speaker 5>air that was controlling it or work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2166
01:31:57.060 --> 01:31:59.070
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have to go against his </v>
<v Speaker 5>strength.</v>

2167
01:31:59.310 --> 01:32:01.330
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have to figure out a way</v>
<v Speaker 5>to move around it.</v>

2168
01:32:01.331 --> 01:32:02.860
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to go through it.</v>

2169
01:32:03.130 --> 01:32:04.210
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That big guy,</v>

2170
01:32:04.211 --> 01:32:05.044
<v Speaker 5>if he was teaching Jujitsu who I just </v>
<v Speaker 5>grabbed her neck and on your squeeze </v>

2171
01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:09.213
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got the kind of horsepower that a </v>

2172
01:32:11.951 --> 01:32:14.560
<v Speaker 5>man like you know a normal man can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>imagine.</v>

2173
01:32:14.610 --> 01:32:15.443
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that's changing again to </v>

2174
01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:19.510
<v Speaker 5>bring it back to the UFC I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause now,</v>

2175
01:32:19.511 --> 01:32:21.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean with what call me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's doing and,</v>

2176
01:32:21.451 --> 01:32:23.730
<v Speaker 5>and you know John Jones coming back then</v>
<v Speaker 5>the lightweights,</v>

2177
01:32:23.731 --> 01:32:24.940
<v Speaker 5>we're all moving up to heavyweight.</v>

2178
01:32:24.970 --> 01:32:26.080
<v Speaker 5>Do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2179
01:32:26.081 --> 01:32:26.914
<v Speaker 5>gone are the days of the huge dude who </v>
<v Speaker 5>was just a physical phenom and now the </v>

2180
01:32:31.931 --> 01:32:32.764
<v Speaker 5>smaller technical dues is that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 5>thought with the 265 pound weight class </v>

2181
01:32:37.931 --> 01:32:38.764
<v Speaker 5>and the consensus thought seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>that somewhere around 240 pounds is the </v>

2182
01:32:43.841 --> 01:32:46.390
<v Speaker 5>magic number.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what they think.</v>

2183
01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:47.673
<v Speaker 5>They think that 240 pounds is the amount</v>
<v Speaker 5>of weight that you have where you're </v>

2184
01:32:51.371 --> 01:32:54.430
<v Speaker 5>strong enough that you can knock out any</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2185
01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:55.453
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you have more endurance than a man </v>

2186
01:32:57.251 --> 01:33:02.040
<v Speaker 5>that may be ways to 65 or heavier and </v>
<v Speaker 5>cuts down to two 65 okay.</v>

2187
01:33:02.110 --> 01:33:02.943
<v Speaker 5>Now this is not been substantiated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is there hasn't been a </v>

2188
01:33:07.181 --> 01:33:12.181
<v Speaker 5>really super powerful world championship</v>
<v Speaker 5>athlete that weighed 265 pounds.</v>

2189
01:33:13.450 --> 01:33:18.450
<v Speaker 5>There's been brock Lesnar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but brock Lesnar's enhanced,</v>

2190
01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:20.433
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're dealing with a guy who tested </v>

2191
01:33:21.911 --> 01:33:25.570
<v Speaker 5>positive for steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He probably has had things and then this</v>

2192
01:33:25.571 --> 01:33:26.560
<v Speaker 5>is a new world.</v>

2193
01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:30.130
<v Speaker 5>He's also 40 years old now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's impossible to tell what he would</v>

2194
01:33:30.131 --> 01:33:30.964
<v Speaker 5>have been like at 30 if he was clean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you have guys like Francis and </v>

2195
01:33:34.481 --> 01:33:37.870
<v Speaker 5>Ghana who was 265 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>massive knockout artists,</v>

2196
01:33:37.871 --> 01:33:42.871
<v Speaker 5>natural 265 pounds but doesn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrestling base got exposed and his fight</v>

2197
01:33:43.481 --> 01:33:45.580
<v Speaker 5>with Steve Bay Meo church and you can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>knock you out.</v>

2198
01:33:45.581 --> 01:33:48.340
<v Speaker 5>He's kind of doomed and he tired out </v>
<v Speaker 5>after the first round.</v>

2199
01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:49.263
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's hard to say cause there's never </v>

2200
01:33:51.221 --> 01:33:54.280
<v Speaker 5>been a 265 pound version of Cain </v>
<v Speaker 5>Velasquez.</v>

2201
01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:55.630
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cain Velasquez,</v>

2202
01:33:55.870 --> 01:33:56.703
<v Speaker 5>my humble opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I look at all of the different </v>

2203
01:33:59.381 --> 01:34:03.130
<v Speaker 5>heavyweights that I've personally seen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fight cane stands out as the best.</v>

2204
01:34:03.550 --> 01:34:04.383
<v Speaker 5>The reason why Keynes stands out as the </v>
<v Speaker 5>best is because he has super human </v>

2205
01:34:07.061 --> 01:34:08.090
<v Speaker 5>endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2206
01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:13.140
<v Speaker 5>And his ability to put a pace on guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would see these guys just wilt under</v>

2207
01:34:13.451 --> 01:34:16.690
<v Speaker 5>the pressure of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think with cane,</v>

2208
01:34:17.730 --> 01:34:19.210
<v Speaker 5>this is where it gets really </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting.</v>

2209
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:20.343
<v Speaker 5>What did him in is probably what also </v>
<v Speaker 5>brought him to the top is his mental </v>

2210
01:34:23.651 --> 01:34:26.920
<v Speaker 5>toughness because his body started </v>
<v Speaker 5>breaking down.</v>

2211
01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:29.080
<v Speaker 5>He started having all these back </v>
<v Speaker 5>injuries.</v>

2212
01:34:29.081 --> 01:34:31.330
<v Speaker 5>He needed back surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>multiple back surgeries,</v>

2213
01:34:31.331 --> 01:34:32.890
<v Speaker 5>shoulder surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>knee surgery,</v>

2214
01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:34.053
<v Speaker 5>everything was getting fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think it was getting fucked up </v>

2215
01:34:35.981 --> 01:34:36.814
<v Speaker 5>cause he was working through pain and </v>
<v Speaker 5>because he has the ability to tolerate </v>

2216
01:34:39.911 --> 01:34:44.530
<v Speaker 5>pain that most people don't have and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's just a fucking animal.</v>

2217
01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:49.800
<v Speaker 5>But that's also probably what led to him</v>
<v Speaker 5>having this insane endurance is the same</v>

2218
01:34:51.131 --> 01:34:53.620
<v Speaker 5>kind of mental toughness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure there's some genetic advantages</v>

2219
01:34:53.621 --> 01:34:54.454
<v Speaker 5>as well because they would talk about </v>
<v Speaker 5>how he would take months off and come </v>

2220
01:34:56.831 --> 01:35:00.200
<v Speaker 5>back still fuck everybody up because </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's just that good.</v>

2221
01:35:00.201 --> 01:35:01.034
<v Speaker 5>But then also can be attributed to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>cardio base that he had from competing </v>

2222
01:35:05.631 --> 01:35:06.291
<v Speaker 5>for many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>many,</v>

2223
01:35:06.291 --> 01:35:07.124
<v Speaker 5>many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>many years at a high level and being </v>

2224
01:35:09.381 --> 01:35:12.500
<v Speaker 5>known for that insane endurance and </v>
<v Speaker 5>perception to fatigue.</v>

2225
01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:14.510
<v Speaker 5>Going back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you could quantify that,</v>

2226
01:35:14.511 --> 01:35:16.430
<v Speaker 5>you'd put cane up there with one of </v>
<v Speaker 5>those people.</v>

2227
01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:19.170
<v Speaker 5>He has that in abundance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2228
01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:20.073
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyone else in the heavyweights then </v>

2229
01:35:21.471 --> 01:35:24.680
<v Speaker 5>would you say your core?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Me a for sure has tremendous,</v>

2230
01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:26.030
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fatigue,</v>

2231
01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:26.893
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ability to tolerate fatigue and for </v>

2232
01:35:28.071 --> 01:35:30.290
<v Speaker 5>tremendous endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he breaks people,</v>

2233
01:35:30.291 --> 01:35:31.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they call him the king of the grind.</v>

2234
01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:33.500
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but on top of that,</v>

2235
01:35:33.501 --> 01:35:34.334
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what they both have is tremendous </v>

2236
01:35:35.541 --> 01:35:36.850
<v Speaker 5>wrestling technique.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The tree,</v>

2237
01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:39.500
<v Speaker 5>the wrestling technique as well as the </v>
<v Speaker 5>endurance.</v>

2238
01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:43.280
<v Speaker 5>Everything plays a factor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jon Jones fits into that camp as well.</v>

2239
01:35:43.490 --> 01:35:46.040
<v Speaker 5>Jon Jones has tremendous wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 5>technique as well.</v>

2240
01:35:46.041 --> 01:35:48.500
<v Speaker 5>Striking technique,</v>
<v Speaker 5>massive physical skills,</v>

2241
01:35:48.501 --> 01:35:49.334
<v Speaker 5>but also mental toughness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His mental toughness is an </v>

2242
01:35:52.611 --> 01:35:54.220
<v Speaker 5>unchallengeable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You like you,</v>

2243
01:35:54.221 --> 01:35:56.200
<v Speaker 5>you absolutely have to give it up to </v>
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>

2244
01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:59.210
<v Speaker 5>He's had his arm fucked up by Vito </v>
<v Speaker 5>Belfort,</v>

2245
01:35:59.211 --> 01:36:00.044
<v Speaker 5>completely hyper extended,</v>
<v Speaker 5>refuse to tap and then went up tapping </v>

2246
01:36:02.610 --> 01:36:03.920
<v Speaker 5>vietor with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with uh,</v>

2247
01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:04.850
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Americana.</v>

2248
01:36:04.850 --> 01:36:08.620
<v Speaker 5>I believe it was the next round and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>toe against Chael Sonnen.</v>

2249
01:36:08.650 --> 01:36:11.120
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was told was fucked up and even notice</v>

2250
01:36:11.121 --> 01:36:13.430
<v Speaker 5>it until I was interviewing him and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>was interviewing him.</v>

2251
01:36:13.431 --> 01:36:14.180
<v Speaker 5>He looked down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>

2252
01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:15.400
<v Speaker 5>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at my toe.</v>

2253
01:36:15.401 --> 01:36:16.234
<v Speaker 5>And he started going to shock.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was it as bad as it was turned upside </v>

2254
01:36:19.071 --> 01:36:21.320
<v Speaker 5>down?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was completely turned upside down.</v>

2255
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:22.400
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>imagine that.</v>

2256
01:36:22.401 --> 01:36:24.980
<v Speaker 5>I mean if he wound up going into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>next round,</v>

2257
01:36:24.981 --> 01:36:25.814
<v Speaker 5>if he didn't stop Chael Sonnen and his </v>
<v Speaker 5>toe was that fucked up and he wound up </v>

2258
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:31.820
<v Speaker 5>losing to chill son because his toe was </v>
<v Speaker 5>bad.</v>

2259
01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:33.700
<v Speaker 5>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2260
01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:34.573
<v Speaker 5>he also went through that fight with </v>
<v Speaker 5>Alexander Gustafson where he wasn't </v>

2261
01:36:37.521 --> 01:36:38.354
<v Speaker 5>really training very hard for that fight</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Gustafson one the first couple </v>

2262
01:36:42.441 --> 01:36:46.250
<v Speaker 5>rounds and then Jon Jones won the last </v>
<v Speaker 5>two to take it away.</v>

2263
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:47.263
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I watched that back obviously with </v>

2264
01:36:47.781 --> 01:36:49.510
<v Speaker 5>all the promotion at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think it was winkle,</v>

2265
01:36:49.511 --> 01:36:51.960
<v Speaker 5>John Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he starts shouting heart hearts,</v>

2266
01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:52.830
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shout out to,</v>

2267
01:36:52.830 --> 01:36:54.050
<v Speaker 5>and that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was the design.</v>

2268
01:36:54.050 --> 01:36:54.883
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's again an,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that was the deciding factor that </v>

2269
01:36:56.541 --> 01:36:59.380
<v Speaker 5>you come out and you produce that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2270
01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:01.220
<v Speaker 5>Also in Jon Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his favor,</v>

2271
01:37:01.250 --> 01:37:02.083
<v Speaker 5>I believe he has to fucking super </v>
<v Speaker 5>athlete brothers and they used to </v>

2272
01:37:06.110 --> 01:37:06.943
<v Speaker 5>apparently beat the shit out of each </v>
<v Speaker 5>other all the time and his brother's a </v>

2273
01:37:08.781 --> 01:37:09.700
<v Speaker 5>bigger than him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2274
01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:13.910
<v Speaker 5>I think that is a factor because I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there's mental toughness that comes</v>

2275
01:37:13.911 --> 01:37:18.020
<v Speaker 5>from being around that kind of combat in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the household all the time.</v>

2276
01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:19.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2277
01:37:19.191 --> 01:37:20.390
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 5>factors,</v>

2278
01:37:20.810 --> 01:37:22.670
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's Ho you,</v>

2279
01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:26.270
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you can teach that.</v>

2280
01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:27.373
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe that mental toughness is</v>
<v Speaker 5>something that you either have or you </v>

2281
01:37:30.771 --> 01:37:32.360
<v Speaker 5>don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe that.</v>

2282
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:33.343
<v Speaker 5>I think you can teach it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you got to want it and you gotta be </v>

2283
01:37:36.441 --> 01:37:37.274
<v Speaker 5>willing to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to be able to bring yourself to </v>

2284
01:37:39.471 --> 01:37:42.050
<v Speaker 5>a state of mind where you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>unbreakable.</v>

2285
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:44.480
<v Speaker 5>I think it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really do.</v>

2286
01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:48.150
<v Speaker 5>And some people just have that that is a</v>
<v Speaker 5>b.</v>

2287
01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:51.050
<v Speaker 5>And I think they've developed it over </v>
<v Speaker 5>long period of time.</v>

2288
01:37:51.051 --> 01:37:51.884
<v Speaker 5>And once they finally got to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's wrestling or Jujitsu or </v>

2289
01:37:55.350 --> 01:37:56.100
<v Speaker 5>mma,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they</v>

2290
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:58.540
<v Speaker 4>already had it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they accentuated it and,</v>

2291
01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:59.383
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and added onto it and then it got </v>

2292
01:38:00.481 --> 01:38:02.070
<v Speaker 4>stronger and then they become known for </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2293
01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:05.190
<v Speaker 4>Like that guy is just an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just mentally strong.</v>

2294
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:08.790
<v Speaker 4>But I think that mental strength comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>from many life experiences.</v>

2295
01:38:08.791 --> 01:38:09.624
<v Speaker 4>And probably probably the guidance of </v>
<v Speaker 4>their parents or some other role model </v>

2296
01:38:14.521 --> 01:38:15.354
<v Speaker 4>in their life that also showed them </v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible endurance and incredible </v>

2297
01:38:18.511 --> 01:38:19.710
<v Speaker 4>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this,</v>

2298
01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:23.910
<v Speaker 4>this mental fortitude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you can teach it though.</v>

2299
01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:25.850
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2300
01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:26.693
<v Speaker 4>I said I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe that it's something </v>

2301
01:38:28.171 --> 01:38:30.240
<v Speaker 4>that's just either have or you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>

2302
01:38:30.241 --> 01:38:32.760
<v Speaker 4>I think you either have it or you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have it,</v>

2303
01:38:32.761 --> 01:38:34.560
<v Speaker 4>but you can get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I think.</v>

2304
01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:35.880
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2305
01:38:35.881 --> 01:38:38.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm a huge fan of Dan Hardee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've been chatting since the,</v>

2306
01:38:38.171 --> 01:38:43.020
<v Speaker 4>the swim and I always go back to that on</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bob with the George Saint Pierre Ev.</v>

2307
01:38:43.290 --> 01:38:45.630
<v Speaker 4>Everybody would its hat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2308
01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:46.101
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2309
01:38:46.101 --> 01:38:49.410
<v Speaker 4>and I couldn't get my hat and I can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>wait to catch up with Dan about that and</v>

2310
01:38:49.411 --> 01:38:54.000
<v Speaker 4>sort of exchange notes on this idea of </v>
<v Speaker 4>mental fortitude because how he survived</v>

2311
01:38:54.001 --> 01:38:54.840
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2312
01:38:54.870 --> 01:38:56.750
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

2313
01:38:56.790 --> 01:38:59.040
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was cringing watching.</v>

2314
01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:00.510
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dan's a savage.</v>

2315
01:39:00.570 --> 01:39:01.171
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2316
01:39:01.171 --> 01:39:03.930
<v Speaker 4>and he's an intelligent savage and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2317
01:39:03.931 --> 01:39:04.830
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2318
01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:10.040
<v Speaker 4>he's not like a thug or a brutish guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a very well read,</v>

2319
01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:12.930
<v Speaker 4>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thoughtful guy.</v>

2320
01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:14.233
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's also a guy that knows how to </v>

2321
01:39:17.221 --> 01:39:18.750
<v Speaker 4>dig deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2322
01:39:18.751 --> 01:39:22.440
<v Speaker 4>And you know when he fought George Saint</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pierre,</v>

2323
01:39:22.441 --> 01:39:24.150
<v Speaker 4>that was his big shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2324
01:39:24.151 --> 01:39:24.984
<v Speaker 4>His big shot was against a guy who was </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the time was in his prime and it was </v>

2325
01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:31.890
<v Speaker 4>the greatest welterweight arguably of </v>
<v Speaker 4>all time.</v>

2326
01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:34.410
<v Speaker 4>I mean the argument is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's between him,</v>

2327
01:39:34.411 --> 01:39:38.450
<v Speaker 4>Matt Hughes and I believe now tyron </v>
<v Speaker 4>Woodley isn't that camp as well.</v>

2328
01:39:38.450 --> 01:39:40.020
<v Speaker 4>It's like the greatest welterweight </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>

2329
01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:41.213
<v Speaker 4>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you get out of Dan Hardy is a guy </v>

2330
01:39:43.531 --> 01:39:44.364
<v Speaker 4>who's thought things through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it really comes through in his </v>

2331
01:39:46.081 --> 01:39:47.610
<v Speaker 4>commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a very,</v>

2332
01:39:47.611 --> 01:39:48.444
<v Speaker 4>very intelligent guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you say he's the same sort of cut </v>

2333
01:39:50.341 --> 01:39:51.174
<v Speaker 4>from the same cloth as call me a them </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I know Brendan's spoke about </v>

2334
01:39:53.281 --> 01:39:56.880
<v Speaker 4>this recently saying he's the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent fighter on the UFC roster at</v>

2335
01:39:56.881 --> 01:39:57.990
<v Speaker 4>the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Carmia.</v>

2336
01:39:58.140 --> 01:40:01.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in his approach and his approach and</v>

2337
01:40:01.171 --> 01:40:03.630
<v Speaker 4>how he will break people button again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2338
01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:04.473
<v Speaker 4>when you watch he in a UFC embedded in </v>
<v Speaker 4>and stuff like you can't help but love </v>

2339
01:40:07.411 --> 01:40:09.660
<v Speaker 4>calling me such a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2340
01:40:09.850 --> 01:40:12.660
<v Speaker 4>and this goes back to what I suppose you</v>
<v Speaker 4>said about the swim,</v>

2341
01:40:12.661 --> 01:40:13.351
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it was like,</v>

2342
01:40:13.351 --> 01:40:13.751
<v Speaker 4>oh you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2343
01:40:13.751 --> 01:40:16.020
<v Speaker 4>you're very smart and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I see that in call me,</v>

2344
01:40:16.021 --> 01:40:16.854
<v Speaker 4>he's the nicest guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I would never get in the octagon </v>

2345
01:40:19.591 --> 01:40:19.920
<v Speaker 4>with him.</v>

2346
01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:21.660
<v Speaker 4>He don't know fooling anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2347
01:40:21.690 --> 01:40:24.500
<v Speaker 4>he's a sweetheart until you're locked in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a cage.</v>

2348
01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:26.033
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The difference between him and Dan </v>

2349
01:40:28.590 --> 01:40:31.590
<v Speaker 4>Hardee though is that he's a world class</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestler,</v>

2350
01:40:31.770 --> 01:40:32.371
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2351
01:40:32.371 --> 01:40:33.204
<v Speaker 4>he was a two time Olympic team member </v>
<v Speaker 4>and just one of the best wrestlers to </v>

2352
01:40:36.241 --> 01:40:37.074
<v Speaker 4>ever compete in MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you really see that in a lot of his </v>

2353
01:40:39.271 --> 01:40:40.650
<v Speaker 4>fights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the Derrick Lewis fight.</v>

2354
01:40:40.770 --> 01:40:43.140
<v Speaker 4>Derrick had no chance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no chance,</v>

2355
01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:44.213
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Derek just knocked out Alexander </v>

2356
01:40:45.990 --> 01:40:47.490
<v Speaker 4>Volkov,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who in a lot of people's eyes,</v>

2357
01:40:47.491 --> 01:40:48.324
<v Speaker 4>including mine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was one of the dark horses in the </v>

2358
01:40:49.351 --> 01:40:50.184
<v Speaker 4>heavyweight division.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Derek just did not belong in there </v>

2359
01:40:52.921 --> 01:40:54.820
<v Speaker 4>with Cormier who was the light </v>
<v Speaker 4>heavyweight champion.</v>

2360
01:40:54.821 --> 01:40:56.510
<v Speaker 4>And he carries a lot of fat on him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2361
01:40:56.590 --> 01:40:58.580
<v Speaker 4>he's mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think if,</v>

2362
01:40:58.810 --> 01:40:59.643
<v Speaker 4>if he wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if Daniel cormier really dedicated </v>

2363
01:41:02.801 --> 01:41:05.230
<v Speaker 4>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he could drop down to 185 pounds.</v>

2364
01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:08.170
<v Speaker 4>I really believed that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's just,</v>

2365
01:41:08.630 --> 01:41:09.311
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>easy.</v>

2366
01:41:09.311 --> 01:41:11.350
<v Speaker 4>Why would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a fucking heavyweight champion.</v>

2367
01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:14.890
<v Speaker 4>That's the difference between him and D.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's many differences between him and</v>

2368
01:41:14.891 --> 01:41:16.720
<v Speaker 4>Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The success ratio is very different.</v>

2369
01:41:17.150 --> 01:41:19.300
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>courtney has been extremely successful.</v>

2370
01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:20.860
<v Speaker 4>The only guy who lost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is John Jones,</v>

2371
01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:22.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2372
01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:24.040
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I find that with rest,</v>

2373
01:41:24.041 --> 01:41:24.874
<v Speaker 4>and this is on a complete tangent here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you talk about that mind body </v>

2374
01:41:28.121 --> 01:41:30.220
<v Speaker 4>connection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like so often they're seen as separate.</v>

2375
01:41:30.221 --> 01:41:33.430
<v Speaker 4>You're over an intellect or you're just </v>
<v Speaker 4>a physical phenom.</v>

2376
01:41:33.490 --> 01:41:35.950
<v Speaker 4>Like it's rare that you see the two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when again,</v>

2377
01:41:36.010 --> 01:41:37.870
<v Speaker 4>ancient Greek philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at Plato,</v>

2378
01:41:37.871 --> 01:41:40.780
<v Speaker 4>like Plato was an accomplished,</v>
<v Speaker 4>celebrated wrestler.</v>

2379
01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:43.600
<v Speaker 4>I think he said something along the </v>
<v Speaker 4>lines of,</v>

2380
01:41:43.601 --> 01:41:44.434
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should wrestle to find the answers </v>

2381
01:41:45.311 --> 01:41:46.780
<v Speaker 4>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Philosophers seek.</v>

2382
01:41:46.781 --> 01:41:47.920
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was something like that.</v>

2383
01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:50.170
<v Speaker 4>It was such an advocate of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2384
01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:52.850
<v Speaker 4>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again this is coming from a,</v>

2385
01:41:52.870 --> 01:41:53.703
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of my limited background because </v>

2386
01:41:54.581 --> 01:41:57.730
<v Speaker 4>obviously in in Britain we don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have wrestling like over,</v>

2387
01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:00.700
<v Speaker 4>over here and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's something about wrestling it</v>

2388
01:42:00.701 --> 01:42:01.534
<v Speaker 4>seems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or I suppose my question to you is like </v>

2389
01:42:03.191 --> 01:42:07.190
<v Speaker 4>that it just teaches that like mental </v>
<v Speaker 4>fortitude yeah.</v>

2390
01:42:07.210 --> 01:42:08.230
<v Speaker 4>Physically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2391
01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:09.073
<v Speaker 4>Neuromuscular efficiency and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it seems to just produce this breed </v>

2392
01:42:13.271 --> 01:42:16.080
<v Speaker 4>of humans that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2393
01:42:16.130 --> 01:42:16.963
<v Speaker 4>it did you think is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something about being face down </v>

2394
01:42:18.971 --> 01:42:19.804
<v Speaker 4>in a matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody just trying to contort your </v>

2395
01:42:21.791 --> 01:42:23.050
<v Speaker 4>limbs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2396
01:42:23.051 --> 01:42:25.450
<v Speaker 4>so that took to go back to stress and </v>
<v Speaker 4>stimulate,</v>

2397
01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:26.313
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also building up that progressive </v>

2398
01:42:28.991 --> 01:42:30.730
<v Speaker 4>overload and your own head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2399
01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:31.593
<v Speaker 4>That and what you just said there about </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences that that quite often now </v>

2400
01:42:35.801 --> 01:42:37.240
<v Speaker 4>when I go swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2401
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:38.583
<v Speaker 4>it's not the courier Vecan I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 4>wearing the jellyfish tentacle on my </v>

2402
01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:41.080
<v Speaker 4>face.</v>

2403
01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:42.670
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not that bad.</v>

2404
01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:45.880
<v Speaker 4>And I think what did do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where my question is.</v>

2405
01:42:45.881 --> 01:42:48.040
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it's the same with </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling that you like?</v>

2406
01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:51.220
<v Speaker 4>I've been in a worse position than this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think for sure.</v>

2407
01:42:51.310 --> 01:42:55.270
<v Speaker 4>I think there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the strength that they have,</v>

2408
01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:56.133
<v Speaker 4>the intellectual strength and when I say</v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectual strength there is actually </v>

2409
01:42:59.681 --> 01:43:03.340
<v Speaker 4>solving puzzles and whether people </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand it or not,</v>

2410
01:43:03.450 --> 01:43:04.600
<v Speaker 4>you look at wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think,</v>

2411
01:43:04.630 --> 01:43:05.463
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's brute force and strength and </v>

2412
01:43:07.031 --> 01:43:08.800
<v Speaker 4>endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're solving puzzles,</v>

2413
01:43:08.950 --> 01:43:10.390
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's setting traps.</v>

2414
01:43:10.630 --> 01:43:14.770
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to set up techniques and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're doing this under heavy workload,</v>

2415
01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:16.000
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're exhausted,</v>

2416
01:43:16.001 --> 01:43:16.834
<v Speaker 4>their heart's pounding and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>resisting 100% with another person is </v>

2417
01:43:19.781 --> 01:43:20.614
<v Speaker 4>resisting 100% when you see guys tie up </v>
<v Speaker 4>and throwing each other around and </v>

2418
01:43:24.401 --> 01:43:25.234
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking digging their toes into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the mat and wrenching as a tremendous </v>

2419
01:43:29.651 --> 01:43:33.070
<v Speaker 4>amount of force that they have to keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>up for minutes and minutes at a time.</v>

2420
01:43:33.610 --> 01:43:38.020
<v Speaker 4>And I think a lot of that has to do with</v>
<v Speaker 4>your ability to maintain intensity.</v>

2421
01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:39.093
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of that has to do with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to tolerate being exhausted and </v>

2422
01:43:41.981 --> 01:43:42.814
<v Speaker 4>tolerate fatigue and to force yourself </v>
<v Speaker 4>into an in a highly aggressive and </v>

2423
01:43:47.951 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 4>efficient mindset and to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 4>maintain proper technique under</v>

2424
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:53.600
<v Speaker 3>fatigue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>

2425
01:43:53.670 --> 01:43:56.420
<v Speaker 3>Technique and intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe again with the Royal Marines,</v>

2426
01:43:56.421 --> 01:44:01.421
<v Speaker 3>we can be a Wa when training with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find that it's crazy how you,</v>

2427
01:44:02.071 --> 01:44:04.850
<v Speaker 3>you will have the cognitive functioning </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a five year old,</v>

2428
01:44:04.851 --> 01:44:05.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are compliant,</v>

2429
01:44:06.010 --> 01:44:06.843
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in a 30 mile yacht with 50 kg on </v>

2430
01:44:08.751 --> 01:44:09.584
<v Speaker 3>your backpack and somebody asks you some</v>
<v Speaker 3>really complex question and your </v>

2431
01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:12.990
<v Speaker 3>dislikes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2432
01:44:13.010 --> 01:44:14.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2433
01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:17.120
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's certainly going back to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the swim,</v>

2434
01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:19.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's times where I said to the team,</v>

2435
01:44:19.581 --> 01:44:20.361
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please,</v>

2436
01:44:20.361 --> 01:44:21.194
<v Speaker 3>like when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm six hours into a swim through </v>

2437
01:44:23.031 --> 01:44:25.760
<v Speaker 3>the night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need just really clear instructions,</v>

2438
01:44:25.761 --> 01:44:28.670
<v Speaker 3>just like raw swim this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ron's Rosslyn that direction.</v>

2439
01:44:28.671 --> 01:44:31.220
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>purely anecdotal for the moment,</v>

2440
01:44:31.221 --> 01:44:32.054
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love cowboys serone and there's times </v>

2441
01:44:34.071 --> 01:44:37.100
<v Speaker 3>when he's just in his corner and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just having a full on comedy.</v>

2442
01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:38.850
<v Speaker 3>So relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2443
01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:41.810
<v Speaker 3>And it's just like that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could see somebody probably fatigued</v>

2444
01:44:41.811 --> 01:44:45.370
<v Speaker 3>and they're panicking and he's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting on the stool.</v>

2445
01:44:45.371 --> 01:44:47.750
<v Speaker 3>Like he's got great deference to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That helps.</v>

2446
01:44:47.751 --> 01:44:50.720
<v Speaker 3>That certainly helps his ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>recover and rounds.</v>

2447
01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:51.573
<v Speaker 3>And you see his fight this weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to catch up on it was </v>

2448
01:44:54.770 --> 01:44:56.540
<v Speaker 3>sensational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best he's ever looked.</v>

2449
01:44:56.570 --> 01:44:58.910
<v Speaker 3>But he was on the bottom when Perry can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

2450
01:44:58.940 --> 01:44:59.391
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2451
01:44:59.391 --> 01:45:00.800
<v Speaker 3>Perry took him down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he said to me,</v>

2452
01:45:00.801 --> 01:45:01.371
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

2453
01:45:01.371 --> 01:45:02.420
<v Speaker 3>he started taking me down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2454
01:45:02.421 --> 01:45:03.290
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to let him.</v>

2455
01:45:04.010 --> 01:45:05.250
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll let them take me down.</v>

2456
01:45:05.251 --> 01:45:07.770
<v Speaker 3>And then he reversed them immediately </v>
<v Speaker 3>and got him in an arm bar and,</v>

2457
01:45:07.771 --> 01:45:10.790
<v Speaker 3>and broke his arm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He snapped his forum and half he sent me</v>

2458
01:45:10.791 --> 01:45:13.620
<v Speaker 3>the x rays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2459
01:45:15.490 --> 01:45:16.980
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody's seen this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2460
01:45:16.990 --> 01:45:20.610
<v Speaker 3>sorry Donald,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sending us from not supposed to send</v>

2461
01:45:20.611 --> 01:45:21.444
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

2462
01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:23.160
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2463
01:45:23.210 --> 01:45:24.043
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'd been going back and forth and you </v>

2464
01:45:24.981 --> 01:45:25.701
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for him,</v>

2465
01:45:25.701 --> 01:45:29.030
<v Speaker 5>I think it was a matter of rekindling </v>
<v Speaker 5>his excitement.</v>

2466
01:45:29.031 --> 01:45:30.320
<v Speaker 5>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2467
01:45:30.321 --> 01:45:32.840
<v Speaker 5>It was a pretty emotional person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2468
01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:33.733
<v Speaker 5>that hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2469
01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:35.293
<v Speaker 5>Can you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want me to send it to you or I'll </v>

2470
01:45:37.221 --> 01:45:38.054
<v Speaker 5>send it to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie?</v>

2471
01:45:38.450 --> 01:45:42.710
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>also I think with Donald when it comes,</v>

2472
01:45:42.711 --> 01:45:46.070
<v Speaker 5>we were talking about stimulation and </v>
<v Speaker 5>motivation.</v>

2473
01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:47.083
<v Speaker 5>He has a son now is a little baby son.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he brought his son into the octagon </v>

2474
01:45:50.121 --> 01:45:53.510
<v Speaker 5>with him and celebrating with his son.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just seemed different to me.</v>

2475
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:56.780
<v Speaker 5>He seemed different in his poise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>completely in control.</v>

2476
01:45:57.050 --> 01:46:00.290
<v Speaker 5>The guys fighting Mike Perry is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>dangerous.</v>

2477
01:46:00.350 --> 01:46:02.510
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He hits really hard.</v>

2478
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:06.110
<v Speaker 5>He's very aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And a donald just handled them.</v>

2479
01:46:06.270 --> 01:46:07.103
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Perry took him down I think because </v>

2480
01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:10.910
<v Speaker 5>he didn't like what was going on standup</v>
<v Speaker 5>wise.</v>

2481
01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:13.310
<v Speaker 5>He just snapped that shit.</v>

2482
01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:14.910
<v Speaker 3>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you mentioned there as well.</v>

2483
01:46:14.911 --> 01:46:15.744
<v Speaker 3>We saw Bernie talking about his son and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was such an emotional post that he </v>

2484
01:46:17.881 --> 01:46:19.260
<v Speaker 3>posted on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I loved it.</v>

2485
01:46:19.261 --> 01:46:19.710
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2486
01:46:19.710 --> 01:46:24.710
<v Speaker 3>and going back to what you said about </v>
<v Speaker 3>finding something that,</v>

2487
01:46:25.170 --> 01:46:28.800
<v Speaker 3>that alters your biochemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2488
01:46:28.801 --> 01:46:31.380
<v Speaker 3>and now that he's fighting for something</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2489
01:46:31.381 --> 01:46:32.330
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got his kid.</v>

2490
01:46:32.331 --> 01:46:33.480
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you think that's,</v>

2491
01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:36.570
<v Speaker 3>that's what we were talking about music </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

2492
01:46:36.571 --> 01:46:37.800
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about getting his </v>
<v Speaker 3>mindset.</v>

2493
01:46:37.801 --> 01:46:40.410
<v Speaker 3>It may be use caffeine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like whatever it is,</v>

2494
01:46:40.650 --> 01:46:44.100
<v Speaker 3>but something you think is now different</v>
<v Speaker 3>in serone because again,</v>

2495
01:46:44.190 --> 01:46:46.200
<v Speaker 3>it's love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2496
01:46:46.230 --> 01:46:47.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The love of his children,</v>

2497
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:49.750
<v Speaker 3>his children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has something that he,</v>

2498
01:46:49.770 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 3>what</v>

2499
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:51.600
<v Speaker 5>he said was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2500
01:46:51.660 --> 01:46:54.210
<v Speaker 5>I never knew what I was fighting for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

2501
01:46:54.211 --> 01:46:55.044
<v Speaker 5>now I have something to fight for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he was fighting for excitement </v>

2502
01:46:57.271 --> 01:47:00.220
<v Speaker 5>before for thrills cause he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a thrill seek,</v>

2503
01:47:00.221 --> 01:47:01.054
<v Speaker 5>you said wild motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He likes jet skiing and jump and </v>

2504
01:47:04.381 --> 01:47:08.190
<v Speaker 5>snowmobiles off the side of mountains </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's an animal week before a fight.</v>

2505
01:47:08.370 --> 01:47:09.930
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't give a fuck.</v>

2506
01:47:10.050 --> 01:47:12.090
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is a different thing.</v>

2507
01:47:12.290 --> 01:47:16.200
<v Speaker 5>What he's doing in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in this fight in particular,</v>

2508
01:47:16.201 --> 01:47:19.290
<v Speaker 5>I think this is a different thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>because he's fighting for his son.</v>

2509
01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:23.730
<v Speaker 5>I mean he's got this family now and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>means the world to him and he looks over</v>

2510
01:47:23.731 --> 01:47:24.564
<v Speaker 5>at this guy like this guy is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>take food from his family and he just </v>

2511
01:47:28.411 --> 01:47:30.960
<v Speaker 5>wasn't efficient assassin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just,</v>

2512
01:47:31.050 --> 01:47:32.340
<v Speaker 5>it was beautiful to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

2513
01:47:32.341 --> 01:47:34.380
<v Speaker 5>I think the best performance of his </v>
<v Speaker 5>career.</v>

2514
01:47:35.130 --> 01:47:35.963
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe Mike Perry is not as good as </v>

2515
01:47:37.621 --> 01:47:38.454
<v Speaker 5>Darren till or is Hofeld Asan Joe's or </v>
<v Speaker 5>some of the other people that he's </v>

2516
01:47:41.101 --> 01:47:41.934
<v Speaker 5>fought in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's fucking dangerous and he's a </v>

2517
01:47:43.681 --> 01:47:47.970
<v Speaker 5>legit welterweight were Donald's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>donald can fight it 155 pounds.</v>

2518
01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:49.950
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the things Donald said after</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fight,</v>

2519
01:47:49.951 --> 01:47:50.784
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Khabib,</v>

2520
01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:51.840
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm back.</v>

2521
01:47:51.841 --> 01:47:52.674
<v Speaker 5>I'm coming for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he wants to drop down to one 55 and </v>

2522
01:47:54.631 --> 01:47:56.420
<v Speaker 5>fight could be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you think he might know something?</v>

2523
01:47:56.421 --> 01:47:57.254
<v Speaker 5>It's different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think you didn't think he could </v>

2524
01:47:58.411 --> 01:47:59.210
<v Speaker 5>make a taller one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2525
01:47:59.210 --> 01:48:01.140
<v Speaker 5>it was a man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Khabib is the motherfuckers.</v>

2526
01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:02.900
<v Speaker 5>All motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2527
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:05.060
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's going to beat that dude?</v>

2528
01:48:05.061 --> 01:48:05.894
<v Speaker 5>But that dude molly was aspirin maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but aspirin is a different weight Class </v>

2529
01:48:09.811 --> 01:48:14.811
<v Speaker 5>C aspirins 70 and could bebes 55 if </v>
<v Speaker 5>Khabib and ask an agreed to a catch line</v>

2530
01:48:15.430 --> 01:48:16.230
<v Speaker 5>is fine.</v>

2531
01:48:16.230 --> 01:48:17.063
<v Speaker 5>That is absolutely a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And absolutely a possibility that ask </v>

2532
01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:21.493
<v Speaker 5>him could best him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because if someone's going to beat </v>

2533
01:48:22.891 --> 01:48:23.724
<v Speaker 5>Khabib,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be someone who is a </v>

2534
01:48:24.131 --> 01:48:28.380
<v Speaker 5>superior wrestler and ask her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it is a mother fucker of a wrestler.</v>

2535
01:48:28.650 --> 01:48:29.483
<v Speaker 5>But is he better than can be?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We really don't know and we will not </v>

2536
01:48:31.921 --> 01:48:33.090
<v Speaker 5>know until he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2537
01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:34.013
<v Speaker 5>they fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I do have to say that Khabib in the </v>

2538
01:48:36.751 --> 01:48:40.530
<v Speaker 5>training camp at Aka,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is coming straight from [inaudible]</v>

2539
01:48:40.710 --> 01:48:43.710
<v Speaker 5>and a bunch of other people that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>trained with him say that he trains with</v>

2540
01:48:43.711 --> 01:48:46.380
<v Speaker 5>Olympic caliber wrestlers and fucks them</v>
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

2541
01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:50.390
<v Speaker 5>That's how good could be Biz Khabib is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He is.</v>

2542
01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:54.930
<v Speaker 5>He's so God damned good on the ground </v>
<v Speaker 5>when he gets a hold of guys,</v>

2543
01:48:54.931 --> 01:48:55.764
<v Speaker 5>they look perplexed and I always bring </v>
<v Speaker 5>up the Edson Barboza fight cause a </v>

2544
01:48:59.101 --> 01:48:59.934
<v Speaker 5>moment in the Barboza fight in the first</v>
<v Speaker 5>round where he'd that thousand yard </v>

2545
01:49:02.131 --> 01:49:02.964
<v Speaker 5>stare where Khabib had taken him down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was mauling him and he looked over </v>

2546
01:49:05.971 --> 01:49:06.804
<v Speaker 5>the distance like how the fuck am I </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to get through three rounds of </v>

2547
01:49:08.311 --> 01:49:09.144
<v Speaker 5>this shit?</v>

2548
01:49:09.170 --> 01:49:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing with Barboza.</v>

2549
01:49:11.121 --> 01:49:13.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean Terry added that kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just want,</v>

2550
01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:18.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to see that it was just,</v>

2551
01:49:18.741 --> 01:49:21.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean it felt like if I was to do mixed</v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts,</v>

2552
01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:24.140
<v Speaker 2>did you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you spoke about it before,</v>

2553
01:49:24.141 --> 01:49:26.750
<v Speaker 2>you said if somebody doesn't know you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what they're doing like,</v>

2554
01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:29.910
<v Speaker 2>like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like drowning and,</v>

2555
01:49:29.950 --> 01:49:30.783
<v Speaker 2>and that's exactly how I would feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was just humbling and it's </v>

2556
01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:37.133
<v Speaker 2>something that you</v>

2557
01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:38.153
<v Speaker 5>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See the thing of what you've done in my </v>

2558
01:49:40.411 --> 01:49:43.350
<v Speaker 5>eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you've done is so difficult.</v>

2559
01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:46.410
<v Speaker 5>I think you could do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really do.</v>

2560
01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:51.470
<v Speaker 5>I think what you did by forcing yourself</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do that shit for six hours a day,</v>

2561
01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:52.713
<v Speaker 5>take a break six hours again to do 12 </v>
<v Speaker 5>hours of swimming everyday for five </v>

2562
01:49:56.681 --> 01:49:59.230
<v Speaker 5>fucking months.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That kind of mental fortitude,</v>

2563
01:49:59.231 --> 01:50:00.064
<v Speaker 5>if someone just taught you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you obviously you're very </v>

2564
01:50:02.141 --> 01:50:06.130
<v Speaker 5>physically strong and fit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If someone just taught you technique and</v>

2565
01:50:06.131 --> 01:50:08.830
<v Speaker 5>taught you how to grapple and taught you</v>
<v Speaker 5>kickboxing,</v>

2566
01:50:08.831 --> 01:50:09.664
<v Speaker 5>you would be a motherfucker at it </v>
<v Speaker 5>because your mind is so strong like </v>

2567
01:50:12.890 --> 01:50:14.900
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you know,</v>

2568
01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:15.753
<v Speaker 5>there's a different mindset to have that</v>
<v Speaker 5>same kind of mind strength with the </v>

2569
01:50:18.881 --> 01:50:21.080
<v Speaker 5>adversity of another human being.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Trying to kill you.</v>

2570
01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:22.330
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing.</v>

2571
01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:25.450
<v Speaker 5>How well do people deal with other </v>
<v Speaker 5>people's,</v>

2572
01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:26.793
<v Speaker 5>like there's something about a person </v>
<v Speaker 5>breathing down your neck that's trying </v>

2573
01:50:29.141 --> 01:50:31.060
<v Speaker 5>to choke you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's very disconcerting.</v>

2574
01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:34.030
<v Speaker 5>But if you can get past that and I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could,</v>

2575
01:50:34.270 --> 01:50:36.180
<v Speaker 5>you would be a motherfucker at anything </v>
<v Speaker 5>you did.</v>

2576
01:50:36.390 --> 01:50:37.780
<v Speaker 2>And that's actually the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2577
01:50:37.781 --> 01:50:40.720
<v Speaker 2>even at the moment now I'm used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2578
01:50:41.130 --> 01:50:41.963
<v Speaker 2>just training for 12 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So right now I'm still sort of in Bi </v>

2579
01:50:45.821 --> 01:50:48.160
<v Speaker 2>phasic sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've only been on land really a week,</v>

2580
01:50:48.161 --> 01:50:49.970
<v Speaker 2>so that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2581
01:50:49.971 --> 01:50:51.820
<v Speaker 2>So were you sleeping in a boat this </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole time?</v>

2582
01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:53.893
<v Speaker 2>Is Six hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it like to have the ground not </v>

2583
01:50:57.251 --> 01:50:59.470
<v Speaker 2>move the hog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the standing boom?</v>

2584
01:50:59.590 --> 01:51:00.910
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I go on I was,</v>

2585
01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:05.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was doing media interviews and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything was swaying like they said,</v>

2586
01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:07.990
<v Speaker 2>but even even that night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my first night,</v>

2587
01:51:07.991 --> 01:51:08.710
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bed,</v>

2588
01:51:08.710 --> 01:51:11.590
<v Speaker 2>it sounds so weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the bed was just a bit too stable.</v>

2589
01:51:11.591 --> 01:51:13.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a bit too comfy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2590
01:51:13.391 --> 01:51:16.240
<v Speaker 2>I woke up in the middle of the night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was with my girlfriend and I'm looking</v>

2591
01:51:16.241 --> 01:51:17.670
<v Speaker 2>for my goggles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2592
01:51:17.710 --> 01:51:19.990
<v Speaker 2>thinking of the time is about to change </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to jump back in.</v>

2593
01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:22.090
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like go back to bed.</v>

2594
01:51:22.100 --> 01:51:22.933
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly I say it now like sort of </v>

2595
01:51:24.401 --> 01:51:26.320
<v Speaker 2>joking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a real element of,</v>

2596
01:51:26.321 --> 01:51:29.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just that you'd been conditioned and all</v>

2597
01:51:29.711 --> 01:51:32.140
<v Speaker 2>I really cared about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soon as I woke up,</v>

2598
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:34.600
<v Speaker 2>I want to end just to know what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tides were doing.</v>

2599
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:36.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

2600
01:51:36.581 --> 01:51:37.690
<v Speaker 2>where's it running?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

2601
01:51:37.730 --> 01:51:38.620
<v Speaker 2>when does it start?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When does it,</v>

2602
01:51:38.621 --> 01:51:39.454
<v Speaker 2>how have we got good title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad side does it spring tides or neat </v>

2603
01:51:41.171 --> 01:51:42.570
<v Speaker 2>tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So spring ty's been stronger,</v>

2604
01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:45.010
<v Speaker 2>neat type spaces and that was my </v>
<v Speaker 2>currency.</v>

2605
01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:45.993
<v Speaker 2>That's all I cared about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was really strange that you to </v>

2606
01:51:49.951 --> 01:51:53.050
<v Speaker 2>try now and integrate back into society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2607
01:51:53.290 --> 01:51:55.450
<v Speaker 2>even just walking through La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cars,</v>

2608
01:51:55.451 --> 01:51:57.910
<v Speaker 2>everything moves very fast now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2609
01:51:57.911 --> 01:52:01.300
<v Speaker 2>when you kind of come back and it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a bit of a shock.</v>

2610
01:52:01.570 --> 01:52:02.560
<v Speaker 2>It's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real shit.</v>

2611
01:52:02.980 --> 01:52:06.770
<v Speaker 5>You're in an alternate universe or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something like to go through five months</v>

2612
01:52:06.771 --> 01:52:09.740
<v Speaker 5>of one reality and then to come out on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the other end.</v>

2613
01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:11.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>

2614
01:52:11.130 --> 01:52:11.963
<v Speaker 2>So what I almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then even it's an intrinsically or </v>

2615
01:52:15.211 --> 01:52:16.044
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my body's used to work in hard for 12 </v>

2616
01:52:18.541 --> 01:52:21.030
<v Speaker 2>hours a day and just getting battered by</v>
<v Speaker 2>waves with the moment,</v>

2617
01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:22.133
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of sitting here and I've been </v>

2618
01:52:23.581 --> 01:52:25.200
<v Speaker 2>doing media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can spend amazing,</v>

2619
01:52:25.201 --> 01:52:27.410
<v Speaker 2>but there's an element of me just kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of go in,</v>

2620
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:28.583
<v Speaker 2>I need to use this work capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I am sort of training at the </v>

2621
01:52:30.871 --> 01:52:32.130
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first session I did,</v>

2622
01:52:32.131 --> 01:52:35.470
<v Speaker 2>I was in there for like six hours and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours and they were like the gym shut.</v>

2623
01:52:35.471 --> 01:52:36.660
<v Speaker 2>He knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was just like,</v>

2624
01:52:36.690 --> 01:52:37.523
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2625
01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:40.820
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

2626
01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:41.653
<v Speaker 5>There is the element.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So one of the things that we all talked </v>

2627
01:52:43.521 --> 01:52:46.940
<v Speaker 5>about after sober October was none of us</v>
<v Speaker 5>had ever done anything like this before,</v>

2628
01:52:46.941 --> 01:52:47.774
<v Speaker 5>but we're worried now that we're going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to go back to our sedentary ways and </v>

2629
01:52:50.571 --> 01:52:52.520
<v Speaker 5>then we're to lose all this work that we</v>
<v Speaker 5>put in.</v>

2630
01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:53.840
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because at the end of the month,</v>

2631
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:55.910
<v Speaker 5>Ari,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who had never worked out before,</v>

2632
01:52:56.090 --> 01:52:58.760
<v Speaker 5>ran 15 miles road,</v>
<v Speaker 5>five kilometers,</v>

2633
01:52:58.761 --> 01:53:01.700
<v Speaker 5>and then got on the bike for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget what he did on the bike,</v>

2634
01:53:01.820 --> 01:53:03.680
<v Speaker 5>but I think he did at least a mile on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the bike.</v>

2635
01:53:04.190 --> 01:53:09.190
<v Speaker 5>And this was a four plus hour workout.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he had never done anything before.</v>

2636
01:53:10.730 --> 01:53:11.201
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had,</v>

2637
01:53:11.201 --> 01:53:12.820
<v Speaker 5>did you Jitsu?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2638
01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:14.780
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bought him some Jujitsu lessons.</v>

2639
01:53:14.781 --> 01:53:16.660
<v Speaker 5>I bought him a year at 10th Planet Jiu </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jitsu,</v>

2640
01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:21.650
<v Speaker 5>like 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he went for a while and then he hurt</v>

2641
01:53:21.651 --> 01:53:22.484
<v Speaker 5>his knee and stopped going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he was 10 years of nothing and he's </v>

2642
01:53:27.381 --> 01:53:31.820
<v Speaker 5>fucking 40 something years old and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>forced himself through mental fortitude.</v>

2643
01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:32.713
<v Speaker 5>So he's shit.</v>

2644
01:53:32.740 --> 01:53:33.341
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

2645
01:53:33.341 --> 01:53:35.890
<v Speaker 2>so like the human body I find is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>lazy.</v>

2646
01:53:35.891 --> 01:53:36.724
<v Speaker 2>Like we love homeostasis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I habitual level what we're used to </v>

2647
01:53:38.831 --> 01:53:39.700
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2648
01:53:39.701 --> 01:53:43.000
<v Speaker 2>that status quo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then so when you do shift that,</v>

2649
01:53:43.001 --> 01:53:45.580
<v Speaker 2>and it's all relative because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be,</v>

2650
01:53:45.910 --> 01:53:48.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>swimming for 12 hours a day and stuff.</v>

2651
01:53:48.581 --> 01:53:52.120
<v Speaker 2>But it's relative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think when you do shift that,</v>

2652
01:53:52.340 --> 01:53:56.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is hard and I think you have to be so</v>

2653
01:53:56.201 --> 01:53:59.770
<v Speaker 2>conscious of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even now are like for instance,</v>

2654
01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:01.820
<v Speaker 2>my legs at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2655
01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:03.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shrunk,</v>

2656
01:54:03.011 --> 01:54:05.470
<v Speaker 2>but not just my legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I essentially skip leg day,</v>

2657
01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:07.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 157 days,</v>

2658
01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:09.313
<v Speaker 2>your arms must be jacked is kind of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we went into the gym the other day </v>

2659
01:54:13.061 --> 01:54:15.220
<v Speaker 2>and because of the ligaments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tendons,</v>

2660
01:54:15.221 --> 01:54:19.390
<v Speaker 2>but not only just generating force like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a bench press,</v>

2661
01:54:19.690 --> 01:54:22.600
<v Speaker 2>but if you imagine like 40 knots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>wind,</v>

2662
01:54:22.601 --> 01:54:24.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>windover tie that we were talking,</v>

2663
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:29.140
<v Speaker 2>my shoulders are used to being contorted</v>
<v Speaker 2>in ways that they shouldn't be shoulders</v>

2664
01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:30.460
<v Speaker 2>a resisting the winners.</v>

2665
01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:33.700
<v Speaker 2>It's coming towards me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your exactly your shoulders.</v>

2666
01:54:33.730 --> 01:54:34.563
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the amount of times I would take a </v>

2667
01:54:35.441 --> 01:54:36.221
<v Speaker 2>stroke and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2668
01:54:36.221 --> 01:54:37.054
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's times when the waves hit </v>

2669
01:54:38.411 --> 01:54:41.050
<v Speaker 2>me so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I've just hit a boat,</v>

2670
01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:41.973
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hit something and that would be </v>

2671
01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:45.010
<v Speaker 2>pointless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was that resistance as well.</v>

2672
01:54:45.011 --> 01:54:46.190
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2673
01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:49.510
<v Speaker 2>on the bench press it was just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like took one 60,</v>

2674
01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:50.613
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's necessarily just as </v>

2675
01:54:52.991 --> 01:54:53.824
<v Speaker 2>a sort of sports science experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of unlifted and then just took </v>

2676
01:54:55.481 --> 01:54:58.630
<v Speaker 2>one 60 kilos just for a ride and it just</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of felt,</v>

2677
01:54:58.631 --> 01:55:00.630
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the one 60 kilos,</v>

2678
01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:03.900
<v Speaker 2>what does 160 kilos in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry Jamie.</v>

2679
01:55:05.950 --> 01:55:08.350
<v Speaker 2>But then equally my legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2680
01:55:08.351 --> 01:55:10.700
<v Speaker 2>in the Scott Hunt barely lifted my own </v>
<v Speaker 2>body weight,</v>

2681
01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:15.430
<v Speaker 2>53 53 58 reps says he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that,</v>

2682
01:55:15.431 --> 01:55:16.264
<v Speaker 2>that sort of strength and muscle you had</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifted weights in five months and yet </v>

2683
01:55:19.050 --> 01:55:21.120
<v Speaker 2>your upper body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2684
01:55:21.121 --> 01:55:21.954
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2685
01:55:23.010 --> 01:55:24.760
<v Speaker 2>but lower body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2686
01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not even that though.</v>

2687
01:55:26.771 --> 01:55:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2688
01:55:27.611 --> 01:55:28.540
<v Speaker 2>my legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

2689
01:55:28.541 --> 01:55:30.370
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's my feet as well.</v>

2690
01:55:30.371 --> 01:55:31.204
<v Speaker 2>So right now genuinely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of people afterwards were </v>

2691
01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:34.330
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do next?</v>

2692
01:55:34.450 --> 01:55:35.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the next adventure?</v>

2693
01:55:35.371 --> 01:55:37.120
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to learn to walk again.</v>

2694
01:55:37.480 --> 01:55:38.910
<v Speaker 2>And everyone laughed and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2695
01:55:38.911 --> 01:55:39.221
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2696
01:55:39.221 --> 01:55:41.460
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the arches in my foot of collapsed,</v>

2697
01:55:41.461 --> 01:55:44.160
<v Speaker 2>those ligaments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so</v>

2698
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:44.911
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2699
01:55:44.911 --> 01:55:47.190
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of collapse just from not </v>
<v Speaker 3>standing.</v>

2700
01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:47.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2701
01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:48.773
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to think 12 hours in the water </v>

2702
01:55:50.371 --> 01:55:51.930
<v Speaker 3>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even when I was on the boat,</v>

2703
01:55:51.931 --> 01:55:54.690
<v Speaker 3>I was probably eating or sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

2704
01:55:54.691 --> 01:55:57.630
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your load capacity,</v>

2705
01:55:57.631 --> 01:56:01.530
<v Speaker 3>like your ability to like hold your body</v>
<v Speaker 3>weight up as diminished.</v>

2706
01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:02.693
<v Speaker 3>I almost entered into this small group </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people like astronauts where you've </v>

2707
01:56:06.841 --> 01:56:09.930
<v Speaker 3>been in a non weight bearing environment</v>
<v Speaker 3>for so long.</v>

2708
01:56:09.931 --> 01:56:13.170
<v Speaker 3>So I joke and when we watched that video</v>
<v Speaker 3>back and I'll say,</v>

2709
01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:14.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh jazz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2710
01:56:14.041 --> 01:56:16.890
<v Speaker 3>try not to fall over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're genuinely,</v>

2711
01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:19.970
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please don't just fall over with all the</v>

2712
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:20.833
<v Speaker 3>counter and laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the thing that intrigues me is </v>

2713
01:56:23.821 --> 01:56:25.590
<v Speaker 3>you're a young guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2714
01:56:25.591 --> 01:56:26.424
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these endurance guys are old </v>

2715
01:56:28.741 --> 01:56:29.670
<v Speaker 3>angry people.</v>

2716
01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:32.033
<v Speaker 3>They get older and they develop this </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to just fucking fuck the world </v>

2717
01:56:36.210 --> 01:56:36.980
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2718
01:56:36.980 --> 01:56:38.880
<v Speaker 3>and push through things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How old are you?</v>

2719
01:56:39.150 --> 01:56:42.330
<v Speaker 3>33 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very young to do what you did,</v>

2720
01:56:42.450 --> 01:56:43.520
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2721
01:56:43.521 --> 01:56:44.960
<v Speaker 3>And I think you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually.</v>

2722
01:56:44.961 --> 01:56:48.210
<v Speaker 3>I know that that would be a really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>point to make that,</v>

2723
01:56:48.211 --> 01:56:51.480
<v Speaker 3>that I always think when people say I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>too old now to train and stuff,</v>

2724
01:56:51.481 --> 01:56:53.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm like absolutely no when yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>granted,</v>

2725
01:56:53.821 --> 01:56:56.280
<v Speaker 3>when you're younger and plasticity and </v>
<v Speaker 3>your ligaments,</v>

2726
01:56:56.281 --> 01:56:57.510
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Higher Testosterone,</v>

2727
01:56:57.511 --> 01:56:59.670
<v Speaker 3>muscle mass ability to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2728
01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:01.230
<v Speaker 3>increase my semesters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've absolutely,</v>

2729
01:57:01.231 --> 01:57:04.350
<v Speaker 3>but when you're older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and to your point there,</v>

2730
01:57:04.351 --> 01:57:05.550
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you look at these,</v>

2731
01:57:05.551 --> 01:57:06.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>backing the fell running,</v>

2732
01:57:06.871 --> 01:57:10.620
<v Speaker 3>which was talking about you get these </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys who just look like they live in the</v>

2733
01:57:10.621 --> 01:57:11.720
<v Speaker 3>mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2734
01:57:11.730 --> 01:57:14.130
<v Speaker 3>whether they faces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2735
01:57:14.270 --> 01:57:15.103
<v Speaker 3>their carbs are just like this just </v>
<v Speaker 3>thick carves and they have that </v>

2736
01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:22.710
<v Speaker 3>cappelary density that like </v>
<v Speaker 3>mitochondrial efficiency,</v>

2737
01:57:22.711 --> 01:57:24.120
<v Speaker 3>movement efficiency.</v>

2738
01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:24.953
<v Speaker 3>So they're cardio risk spiritually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Durrance has just been built up from </v>

2739
01:57:28.471 --> 01:57:31.950
<v Speaker 3>years and years and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these sorts of people as well there.</v>

2740
01:57:31.970 --> 01:57:34.590
<v Speaker 3>They almost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they loved the mountains and,</v>

2741
01:57:34.591 --> 01:57:35.424
<v Speaker 3>and running so much that they don't care</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're overtraining or like they </v>

2742
01:57:37.981 --> 01:57:40.260
<v Speaker 3>need a rest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That mother Fucker,</v>

2743
01:57:41.670 --> 01:57:42.980
<v Speaker 3>there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honestly,</v>

2744
01:57:42.990 --> 01:57:46.110

<v Speaker 3>getting lapped,</v>

2745
01:57:46.170 --> 01:57:51.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by John Nailer that that's fell running.</v>

2746
01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:54.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>no shorts.</v>

2748
01:58:01.811 --> 01:58:04.830
<v Speaker 3>So you get bed fell running shows you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to wear those shorts.</v>

2749
01:58:05.150 --> 01:58:07.140
<v Speaker 3>They're not compulsory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seems like it is.</v>

2750
01:58:07.141 --> 01:58:08.610
<v Speaker 3>And you've got numbers next to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>deck.</v>

<v Speaker 3>porno movie there.</v>

2754
01:58:17.670 --> 01:58:19.650
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jim and uniform.</v>

2755
01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:20.573
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2756
01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:26.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean if he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he's possibly Jamie,</v>

2757
01:58:26.490 --> 01:58:28.120
<v Speaker 3>there's the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2758
01:58:28.230 --> 01:58:31.980
<v Speaker 3>it's called the Bob Graham.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a famous fowl race going back</v>

2759
01:58:31.981 --> 01:58:32.814
<v Speaker 3>to sort of the bog march.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a famous fell raced back in </v>

2760
01:58:34.351 --> 01:58:36.000
<v Speaker 3>England called the Bob Graham.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2761
01:58:36.330 --> 01:58:38.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>legend has it.</v>

2762
01:58:38.221 --> 01:58:39.240
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bob Graham,</v>

2763
01:58:39.241 --> 01:58:40.320
<v Speaker 3>and he sort of said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2764
01:58:40.321 --> 01:58:41.110
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2765
01:58:41.110 --> 01:58:42.040
<v Speaker 3>I can do 44</v>

2766
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:45.280
<v Speaker 2>peaks in the Lake district and under 24 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours and there were an internet,</v>

2767
01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:46.360
<v Speaker 2>that's not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not possible.</v>

2768
01:58:46.361 --> 01:58:46.751
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2769
01:58:46.751 --> 01:58:49.360
<v Speaker 2>So it was like a bet in a pub.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were like,</v>

2770
01:58:49.361 --> 01:58:50.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sure enough,</v>

2771
01:58:50.411 --> 01:58:51.244
<v Speaker 2>that's what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this race now called the </v>

2772
01:58:53.410 --> 01:58:55.180
<v Speaker 2>Bob Graham,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's amazing and that it's,</v>

2773
01:58:55.420 --> 01:59:00.090
<v Speaker 2>it's steeped in history and heritage is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a hall in Kazic,</v>

2774
01:59:00.091 --> 01:59:01.780
<v Speaker 2>which is a small town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called Moot Hall.</v>

2775
01:59:02.170 --> 01:59:03.660
<v Speaker 2>And if you were standing there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

2776
01:59:03.661 --> 01:59:05.450
<v Speaker 2>and you're in your running gear with </v>
<v Speaker 2>those shorts,</v>

2777
01:59:06.380 --> 01:59:07.213
<v Speaker 2>but you were running though with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>running gear and you had your hand on </v>

2778
01:59:09.701 --> 01:59:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Moot Hall and you were looking at your </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch like that,</v>

2779
01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:14.230
<v Speaker 2>runners would walk past you and just be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2780
01:59:14.260 --> 01:59:14.821
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

2781
01:59:14.821 --> 01:59:16.420
<v Speaker 2>he's about to do is Bob Graham.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2782
01:59:16.421 --> 01:59:18.640
<v Speaker 2>they'd come over and there's that real </v>
<v Speaker 2>solidarity,</v>

2783
01:59:18.641 --> 01:59:20.560
<v Speaker 2>that good luck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good luck.</v>

2784
01:59:21.780 --> 01:59:24.070
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to do it in 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2785
01:59:24.490 --> 01:59:25.840
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>billy bland,</v>

2786
01:59:25.841 --> 01:59:27.730
<v Speaker 2>who was the one who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who set the record,</v>

2787
01:59:27.731 --> 01:59:30.970
<v Speaker 2>which is only just been beaten by Kilian</v>
<v Speaker 2>jewel net who uh,</v>

2788
01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:33.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recently ran up everest as well,</v>

2789
01:59:33.461 --> 01:59:35.970
<v Speaker 2>but I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking Saturday.</v>

2790
01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many savages.</v>

2791
01:59:37.931 --> 01:59:39.340
<v Speaker 2>Our base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>

2792
01:59:39.341 --> 01:59:41.830
<v Speaker 2>and what I love about this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2793
01:59:41.860 --> 01:59:42.341
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

2794
01:59:42.341 --> 01:59:42.880
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2795
01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:43.780
<v Speaker 2>Kilian yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

2796
01:59:43.781 --> 01:59:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Killing and your net.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the guy behind in the blue,</v>

2797
01:59:46.180 --> 01:59:47.013
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>set the record and then it says there I </v>

2798
01:59:48.671 --> 01:59:49.504
<v Speaker 2>needed to suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Kilian join net after breaking the </v>

2799
01:59:51.761 --> 01:59:54.250
<v Speaker 2>record that it stood for 36 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>36 years,</v>

2800
01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:56.030
<v Speaker 2>I needed to suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2801
01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:58.780
<v Speaker 2>but these guys and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it goes back to,</v>

2802
01:59:58.781 --> 02:00:01.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too often it's sports science,</v>

2803
02:00:01.091 --> 02:00:01.841
<v Speaker 2>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition.</v>

2804
02:00:01.841 --> 02:00:03.790
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at your gait analysis,</v>

2805
02:00:03.791 --> 02:00:04.624
<v Speaker 2>running biomechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what footwear are using minimally shoes </v>

2806
02:00:06.990 --> 02:00:07.823
<v Speaker 2>on and everybody.</v>

2807
02:00:08.590 --> 02:00:09.423
<v Speaker 2>Whereas with this with fell running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took 36 years for somebody to get </v>

2808
02:00:13.991 --> 02:00:15.210
<v Speaker 2>close to that record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like,</v>

2809
02:00:15.230 --> 02:00:17.230
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were they doing so far back?</v>

2810
02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Granted you need to know the terrain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you could on this descent,</v>

2811
02:00:21.100 --> 02:00:21.933
<v Speaker 2>on this picture for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could be running down their </v>

2812
02:00:23.051 --> 02:00:25.210
<v Speaker 2>struggling down the rocks and you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>not know that just,</v>

2813
02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:26.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 meters to your right,</v>

2814
02:00:26.741 --> 02:00:30.890
<v Speaker 2>there's a perfect sheep trail and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of the concept of,</v>

2815
02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:31.930
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of fell running.</v>

2816
02:00:31.970 --> 02:00:32.803
<v Speaker 2>So it's just a matter of getting up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>above and over it no matter what path </v>

2817
02:00:35.741 --> 02:00:36.790
<v Speaker 2>you take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2818
02:00:36.791 --> 02:00:37.624
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But certainly efficient if you know of </v>

2819
02:00:38.871 --> 02:00:39.704
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that guy in the front there is </v>

2820
02:00:40.301 --> 02:00:41.134
<v Speaker 2>pacing him basically because it's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>easy to get lost on the duracell know a </v>

2821
02:00:44.661 --> 02:00:47.920
<v Speaker 2>specific path that you have to take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to get over it.</v>

2822
02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:49.570
<v Speaker 2>There's certain points that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get through.</v>

2823
02:00:49.571 --> 02:00:51.940
<v Speaker 2>But then in terms of the terrain and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] no,</v>

2824
02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:52.833
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just point to point to point to </v>

2825
02:00:54.071 --> 02:00:54.904
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how do they mark those points to </v>

2826
02:00:56.231 --> 02:00:58.060
<v Speaker 2>they have a cones and we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this,</v>

2827
02:00:58.061 --> 02:01:00.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll be long established that to do the</v>

2828
02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:01.473
<v Speaker 2>Bob Graham you need to do that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that point and then you come back to </v>

2829
02:01:03.731 --> 02:01:04.870
<v Speaker 2>moot hall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2830
02:01:04.871 --> 02:01:05.704
<v Speaker 2>within hopefully 24 hours and if you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it then you have your have your bob </v>

2831
02:01:09.761 --> 02:01:13.090
<v Speaker 2>grounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys look like a guy that would do</v>

2832
02:01:13.091 --> 02:01:14.350
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas you don't,</v>

2833
02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:15.313
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is my point about you and </v>

2834
02:01:17.081 --> 02:01:19.510
<v Speaker 2>endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how your physique,</v>

2835
02:01:19.930 --> 02:01:23.620
<v Speaker 2>you don't see a guy with your physique </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this kind of stuff.</v>

2836
02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:26.860
<v Speaker 2>You think that you could do this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff running.</v>

2837
02:01:26.861 --> 02:01:27.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2838
02:01:27.380 --> 02:01:28.213
<v Speaker 2>I always say I'm not self deprecating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how much do you think at the moment </v>

2839
02:01:32.651 --> 02:01:35.320
<v Speaker 2>about a hundred kilos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a lot considering our 20.</v>

2840
02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:37.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's about 220 pounds.</v>

2841
02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:38.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

2842
02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:40.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bob Graham is something</v>

2843
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:40.873
<v Speaker 3>complete different than that goes back </v>
<v Speaker 3>to what we were talking about about </v>

2844
02:01:42.141 --> 02:01:44.470
<v Speaker 3>power to weight ratio in a weight </v>
<v Speaker 3>bearing sports.</v>

2845
02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:47.030
<v Speaker 3>It was something like running,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause you're so heavy.</v>

2846
02:01:47.090 --> 02:01:49.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a lot of power.</v>

2847
02:01:49.760 --> 02:01:52.220
<v Speaker 3>Do you think it would be possible if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>put,</v>

2848
02:01:52.370 --> 02:01:55.160
<v Speaker 3>if you added more power to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously not now because you're getting</v>

2849
02:01:55.161 --> 02:01:59.990
<v Speaker 3>off for five months on a boat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you built your legs and your feet</v>

2850
02:01:59.991 --> 02:02:01.850
<v Speaker 3>back up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think you could do this?</v>

2851
02:02:02.110 --> 02:02:03.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And do you think this is possibly,</v>

2852
02:02:03.981 --> 02:02:05.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no way near,</v>

2853
02:02:05.091 --> 02:02:06.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean killing Jeanette.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2854
02:02:06.090 --> 02:02:08.890
<v Speaker 3>He's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean with Kilian he um,</v>

2855
02:02:08.930 --> 02:02:12.860
<v Speaker 3>I believe don't come out that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's almost sort of semi nomadic.</v>

2856
02:02:12.861 --> 02:02:14.930
<v Speaker 3>He grew up in the hills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>semi nomadic.</v>

2857
02:02:15.130 --> 02:02:15.963
<v Speaker 3>Most of for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would run a marathon to go and get </v>

2858
02:02:18.801 --> 02:02:19.790
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2859
02:02:19.791 --> 02:02:20.990
<v Speaker 3>carton of milk in the morning.</v>

2860
02:02:21.110 --> 02:02:22.010
<v Speaker 3>Oh Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2861
02:02:22.011 --> 02:02:23.810
<v Speaker 3>so when you are lining up on a start </v>
<v Speaker 3>line,</v>

2862
02:02:23.811 --> 02:02:24.644
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you're racing at Kenyon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look over and you've got a guy like </v>

2863
02:02:27.021 --> 02:02:28.760
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah,</v>

2864
02:02:28.761 --> 02:02:30.240
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just get a lot.</v>

2865
02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:31.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm out.</v>

2866
02:02:31.730 --> 02:02:33.260
<v Speaker 3>You can't beat that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's,</v>

2867
02:02:33.470 --> 02:02:37.880
<v Speaker 3>but he has built for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my like so you,</v>

2868
02:02:37.881 --> 02:02:39.890
<v Speaker 3>but you don't think that guy built for </v>
<v Speaker 3>swimming.</v>

2869
02:02:39.950 --> 02:02:42.740
<v Speaker 3>Like if that guy had to do what you did </v>
<v Speaker 3>swimming wise,</v>

2870
02:02:42.770 --> 02:02:43.603
<v Speaker 3>he would be at a disadvantage over a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain difference going back to the </v>

2871
02:02:46.611 --> 02:02:47.190
<v Speaker 3>belt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2872
02:02:47.190 --> 02:02:48.023
<v Speaker 3>Somebody like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in my experience when I've raced or </v>

2873
02:02:50.841 --> 02:02:51.674
<v Speaker 3>swum with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know guys who are doing in a 10 </v>

2874
02:02:53.301 --> 02:02:53.860
<v Speaker 3>kilometer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2875
02:02:53.860 --> 02:02:56.210
<v Speaker 3>they will be quicker than me over 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>kilometers.</v>

2876
02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:57.313
<v Speaker 3>But then it gets to a point when we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 30 kilometers in where their </v>

2877
02:03:01.630 --> 02:03:02.463
<v Speaker 3>biomechanics just because of muscle </v>
<v Speaker 3>endurance that starts to break down </v>

2878
02:03:05.210 --> 02:03:05.930
<v Speaker 3>maybe as well.</v>

2879
02:03:05.930 --> 02:03:07.970
<v Speaker 3>And this is so often overlooked </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

2880
02:03:07.971 --> 02:03:10.700
<v Speaker 3>but you've got to train your digestive </v>
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

2881
02:03:10.701 --> 02:03:13.760
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is mainly anecdotal,</v>

2882
02:03:13.761 --> 02:03:14.594
<v Speaker 3>but you know in strength based sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know a lot of guys won't think </v>

2883
02:03:17.991 --> 02:03:21.200
<v Speaker 3>anything about putting away 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>calories a day,</v>

2884
02:03:21.201 --> 02:03:22.034
<v Speaker 3>which is what I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm doing that while you were </v>

2885
02:03:23.781 --> 02:03:25.040
<v Speaker 3>swimming?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2886
02:03:25.041 --> 02:03:26.480
<v Speaker 3>15,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2887
02:03:26.481 --> 02:03:27.590
<v Speaker 3>15,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>calories.</v>

2888
02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:29.833
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were sitting down once you got </v>

2889
02:03:31.011 --> 02:03:32.290
<v Speaker 3>inside the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2890
02:03:32.310 --> 02:03:33.620
<v Speaker 3>What were you eating?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the,</v>

2891
02:03:34.010 --> 02:03:35.330
<v Speaker 3>it was so intuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>

2892
02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:38.660
<v Speaker 3>it was kind of strange because the diet </v>
<v Speaker 3>was calorie dense so you have to make up</v>

2893
02:03:38.661 --> 02:03:41.750
<v Speaker 3>for your category and climates that day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also looking at nutrient dense cause you</v>

2894
02:03:41.751 --> 02:03:44.690
<v Speaker 3>got to care for your immune system but </v>
<v Speaker 3>equally palatability.</v>

2895
02:03:44.691 --> 02:03:47.600
<v Speaker 3>So when my tongue was falling upon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know I needed to look at that.</v>

2896
02:03:47.601 --> 02:03:50.270
<v Speaker 3>And even seasickness you're not really </v>
<v Speaker 3>spoke about it as well,</v>

2897
02:03:50.271 --> 02:03:51.104
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of like you need something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that hits those four points and that's </v>

2898
02:03:53.631 --> 02:03:54.680
<v Speaker 3>15,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>calories a day.</v>

2899
02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:55.513
<v Speaker 3>So for me that was quite often just like</v>
<v Speaker 3>porridge oats in a mixed with honey </v>

2900
02:03:59.601 --> 02:04:02.060
<v Speaker 3>mixed with almond butter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then even looking at,</v>

2901
02:04:02.061 --> 02:04:03.320
<v Speaker 3>oh here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2902
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:05.240
<v Speaker 3>So this is a serious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's that?</v>

2903
02:04:06.610 --> 02:04:09.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there might be on there somewhere.</v>

2904
02:04:09.230 --> 02:04:11.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that in that bowl?</v>

2905
02:04:11.150 --> 02:04:12.860
<v Speaker 3>Beans mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2906
02:04:12.861 --> 02:04:13.694
<v Speaker 3>And this is why I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just got to the point where it was </v>

2907
02:04:14.991 --> 02:04:17.150
<v Speaker 3>like what can you just like what he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to say?</v>

2908
02:04:17.151 --> 02:04:20.390
<v Speaker 3>I was just eating out of the pan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just trying to shove it in your face.</v>

2909
02:04:20.391 --> 02:04:21.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like what,</v>

2910
02:04:21.771 --> 02:04:22.820
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would you eat?</v>

2911
02:04:22.900 --> 02:04:25.190
<v Speaker 3>Like what were the fool?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is probably quite a good one.</v>

2912
02:04:25.191 --> 02:04:25.671
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that play.</v>

2913
02:04:25.671 --> 02:04:26.540
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>

2914
02:04:26.541 --> 02:04:27.374
<v Speaker 3>Like in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so essentially as a nutritional sort of </v>

2915
02:04:30.801 --> 02:04:32.090
<v Speaker 3>in theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the framework you get,</v>

2916
02:04:32.091 --> 02:04:32.924
<v Speaker 3>what was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mass.</v>

2917
02:04:33.610 --> 02:04:35.540
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that was to stop the jellyfish.</v>

2918
02:04:35.630 --> 02:04:36.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2919
02:04:38.940 --> 02:04:40.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't matter.</v>

2920
02:04:40.351 --> 02:04:42.780
<v Speaker 2>Like even the mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause the giant jellyfish have Scott and</v>

2921
02:04:42.781 --> 02:04:44.130
<v Speaker 2>then there'll be a pitch on there </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>

2922
02:04:44.430 --> 02:04:48.690
<v Speaker 2>They're kind of like six feet long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you're swimming at night and you</v>

2923
02:04:48.691 --> 02:04:51.150
<v Speaker 2>can't see them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tentacles will,</v>

2924
02:04:51.180 --> 02:04:52.770
<v Speaker 2>they'll just kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll get you.</v>

2925
02:04:52.771 --> 02:04:54.990
<v Speaker 2>And so I got like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go in your mouth and your ears.</v>

2926
02:04:55.140 --> 02:04:55.973
<v Speaker 2>I've got one in my ear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got like what will lead by a </v>

2927
02:04:57.631 --> 02:04:59.900
<v Speaker 2>jellyfish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she just kind of like got me there.</v>

2928
02:04:59.910 --> 02:05:01.860
<v Speaker 2>So it's like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2929
02:05:01.980 --> 02:05:02.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

2930
02:05:02.630 --> 02:05:04.830
<v Speaker 2>the China find and adapt the same way </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a mass,</v>

2931
02:05:04.831 --> 02:05:06.390
<v Speaker 2>but nutritionally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2932
02:05:06.391 --> 02:05:08.970
<v Speaker 2>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also looking at as a framework,</v>

2933
02:05:08.971 --> 02:05:11.370
<v Speaker 2>you having your protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty stable,</v>

2934
02:05:11.371 --> 02:05:12.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1.7</v>

2935
02:05:12.121 --> 02:05:14.280
<v Speaker 2>grams per kg of body weight per day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2936
02:05:14.281 --> 02:05:17.850
<v Speaker 2>that kind of stays the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then for the rest of the 15,000</v>

2937
02:05:17.851 --> 02:05:18.684
<v Speaker 2>calories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you basically need to make it up with </v>

2938
02:05:19.861 --> 02:05:21.970
<v Speaker 2>your two energy yielding macronutrients.</v>

2939
02:05:21.990 --> 02:05:25.860
<v Speaker 2>So carbs and fats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for me it was very carb dependent</v>

2940
02:05:25.861 --> 02:05:28.650
<v Speaker 2>because when you are swimming for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>giant whirlpool,</v>

2941
02:05:28.830 --> 02:05:30.180
<v Speaker 2>you can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I have some fats,</v>

2942
02:05:30.181 --> 02:05:31.920
<v Speaker 2>which the body has to go a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>

2943
02:05:31.921 --> 02:05:32.760
<v Speaker 2>it's going to take longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2944
02:05:32.761 --> 02:05:36.030
<v Speaker 2>you just need fast acting carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then equally,</v>

2945
02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:37.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at,</v>

2946
02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:38.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>MCTs,</v>

2947
02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:42.450
<v Speaker 2>so a medium chain triglycerides as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are a fat,</v>

2948
02:05:42.451 --> 02:05:44.970
<v Speaker 2>so they have the calorie density of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat,</v>

2949
02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:46.193
<v Speaker 2>but they're treated more like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate rather than long chain </v>

2950
02:05:48.781 --> 02:05:49.860
<v Speaker 2>triglycerides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2951
02:05:50.180 --> 02:05:51.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a certain amount of science.</v>

2952
02:05:51.791 --> 02:05:53.310
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2953
02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:55.440
<v Speaker 2>our 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>calories that mean pizza and everything.</v>

2954
02:05:55.441 --> 02:05:56.274
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2955
02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:58.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes to an extent,</v>

2956
02:05:59.160 --> 02:05:59.993
<v Speaker 2>but then place too much emphasis on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're not caring for your immune </v>

2957
02:06:02.941 --> 02:06:05.520
<v Speaker 2>system as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to get 15,000</v>

2958
02:06:05.521 --> 02:06:06.211
<v Speaker 2>calories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2959
02:06:06.211 --> 02:06:07.044
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always point out that it's using </v>

2960
02:06:08.191 --> 02:06:10.470
<v Speaker 2>things like mcts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you'll find in coconut oil,</v>

2961
02:06:10.780 --> 02:06:12.090
<v Speaker 2>and certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2962
02:06:12.091 --> 02:06:14.580
<v Speaker 2>not to get too much on the science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but capric and caprylic acid,</v>

2963
02:06:14.581 --> 02:06:17.310
<v Speaker 2>which are converted to ATP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adenosine triphosphate.</v>

2964
02:06:17.310 --> 02:06:19.050
<v Speaker 2>It's a molecular energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The muscles,</v>

2965
02:06:19.530 --> 02:06:23.160
<v Speaker 2>when you understand how to use mcts like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2966
02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:26.550
<v Speaker 2>it can be quite easy to make up 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>calories,</v>

2967
02:06:26.670 --> 02:06:30.750
<v Speaker 2>but you try and make up 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>calories of vegetables and fruit,</v>

2968
02:06:30.990 --> 02:06:31.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2969
02:06:32.100 --> 02:06:32.933
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially you like have like protein </v>

2970
02:06:34.771 --> 02:06:35.604
<v Speaker 2>and then fruit and it requires a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different digestive enzyme and then </v>

2971
02:06:37.531 --> 02:06:38.364
<v Speaker 2>you're going to tell me to go and swim </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a giant whirlpool and roll on my </v>

2972
02:06:40.651 --> 02:06:43.550
<v Speaker 2>stomach for 12 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like with seasickness,</v>

2973
02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:44.940
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2974
02:06:44.941 --> 02:06:45.820
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2975
02:06:45.821 --> 02:06:48.480
<v Speaker 2>you must need a lot of regret,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really dense foods.</v>

2976
02:06:48.530 --> 02:06:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2977
02:06:49.160 --> 02:06:51.210
<v Speaker 2>and that's the thing that it goes back </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

2978
02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:51.871
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2979
02:06:51.871 --> 02:06:53.730
<v Speaker 2>this bell curve that I've spoke about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2980
02:06:53.731 --> 02:06:54.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2981
02:06:54.690 --> 02:06:58.170
<v Speaker 2>quite often a lot of endurance athletes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are trained with who were amazing,</v>

2982
02:06:58.171 --> 02:07:00.510
<v Speaker 2>they're unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're sub three hour marathon is,</v>

2983
02:07:00.511 --> 02:07:01.170
<v Speaker 2>they're incredible.</v>

2984
02:07:01.170 --> 02:07:01.591
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2985
02:07:01.591 --> 02:07:03.840
<v Speaker 2>they're the guys that will go and run </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bob Graham,</v>

2986
02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:07.170
<v Speaker 2>but quite often they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Ross can just eat.</v>

2987
02:07:07.230 --> 02:07:09.030
<v Speaker 2>And it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2988
02:07:09.031 --> 02:07:11.790
<v Speaker 2>that's often overlooked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2989
02:07:11.791 --> 02:07:12.611
<v Speaker 2>that my body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2990
02:07:12.611 --> 02:07:13.444
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a sick day for out the </v>

2991
02:07:14.251 --> 02:07:16.110
<v Speaker 2>whole swim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>

2992
02:07:16.111 --> 02:07:17.060
<v Speaker 2>The attribute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I popped,</v>

2993
02:07:17.100 --> 02:07:20.130
<v Speaker 2>I started at 92 kilos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2994
02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:20.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

2995
02:07:20.761 --> 02:07:23.160
<v Speaker 2>when you look at the pictures from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>start to the finish,</v>

2996
02:07:23.161 --> 02:07:26.850
<v Speaker 2>I just look like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like Harrier.</v>

2997
02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:27.773
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But just also just bulk because you are </v>

2998
02:07:30.661 --> 02:07:34.050
<v Speaker 2>asking your body to just swim around </v>
<v Speaker 2>Great Britain.</v>

2999
02:07:34.051 --> 02:07:35.950
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you are,</v>

3000
02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:38.230
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to be in a calorie </v>
<v Speaker 2>deficit.</v>

3001
02:07:38.231 --> 02:07:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine how much microtrauma the</v>
<v Speaker 2>body's going to go through?</v>

3002
02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:44.630
<v Speaker 2>So you're essentially just trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>nurse the body saying,</v>

3003
02:07:44.631 --> 02:07:47.290
<v Speaker 2>look and know this is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's cold.</v>

3004
02:07:47.950 --> 02:07:50.020
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm asking you to swim for 12 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours a day.</v>

3005
02:07:50.021 --> 02:07:52.330
<v Speaker 2>I know there's going to be jellyfish </v>
<v Speaker 2>toxins.</v>

3006
02:07:52.331 --> 02:07:53.164
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not some that off stung like in a 20 </v>

3007
02:07:54.611 --> 02:07:56.920
<v Speaker 2>times in one night in a single tied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3008
02:07:56.921 --> 02:08:01.170
<v Speaker 2>so it got to the point where I talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about my face or changing shape.</v>

3009
02:08:01.210 --> 02:08:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Equally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the toxins in your body,</v>

3010
02:08:02.711 --> 02:08:05.080
<v Speaker 2>your heart would start beating faster </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

3011
02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:08.250
<v Speaker 2>so there was just this idea that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat just to,</v>

3012
02:08:08.310 --> 02:08:09.760
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to look after the body.</v>

3013
02:08:09.940 --> 02:08:14.890
<v Speaker 2>So when it comes to nutrition and were </v>
<v Speaker 2>you taking any supplements or you taking</v>

3014
02:08:14.891 --> 02:08:16.930
<v Speaker 2>vitamins?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3015
02:08:16.990 --> 02:08:17.571
<v Speaker 2>lots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3016
02:08:17.571 --> 02:08:19.000
<v Speaker 2>and that goes to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

3017
02:08:19.001 --> 02:08:22.360
<v Speaker 2>that calorie density,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also to make sure that you're making</v>

3018
02:08:22.830 --> 02:08:24.760
<v Speaker 2>some new system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3019
02:08:24.761 --> 02:08:25.594
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taking everything from super green </v>

3020
02:08:27.341 --> 02:08:29.490
<v Speaker 2>shakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to multivitamins to,</v>

3021
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:30.343
<v Speaker 2>to protein shakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to make sure that you were </v>

3022
02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:35.710
<v Speaker 2>supplementing that calorie density.</v>

3023
02:08:35.710 --> 02:08:36.543
<v Speaker 2>I think it's so often overlooked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The higher turnover of like </v>

3024
02:08:39.250 --> 02:08:40.720
<v Speaker 2>phytochemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enzymes,</v>

3025
02:08:40.721 --> 02:08:43.210
<v Speaker 2>micronutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about fish oil?</v>

3026
02:08:43.220 --> 02:08:44.950
<v Speaker 2>Anything along those lines?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mega threes.</v>

3027
02:08:44.951 --> 02:08:46.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what,</v>

3028
02:08:46.150 --> 02:08:46.983
<v Speaker 2>just anything that you were thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is even to to glutamine to a </v>

3029
02:08:51.071 --> 02:08:54.160
<v Speaker 2>higher turnover of amino acids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So after,</v>

3030
02:08:54.161 --> 02:08:55.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

3031
02:08:55.301 --> 02:08:56.134
<v Speaker 2>after training as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have all the protein in the </v>

3032
02:08:58.391 --> 02:08:59.260
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it has a,</v>

3033
02:08:59.261 --> 02:09:02.800
<v Speaker 2>a low biological value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can't,</v>

3034
02:09:02.801 --> 02:09:04.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try and keep the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at,</v>

3035
02:09:04.691 --> 02:09:06.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately after a workout,</v>

3036
02:09:06.450 --> 02:09:07.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body's basically saying,</v>

3037
02:09:07.721 --> 02:09:08.554
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need protein to repair and regrowth </v>

3038
02:09:09.220 --> 02:09:11.440
<v Speaker 2>protein synthesis and your muscles are </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying please.</v>

3039
02:09:11.740 --> 02:09:14.500
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't have a high </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration of Leucine,</v>

3040
02:09:14.501 --> 02:09:16.270
<v Speaker 2>specifically sub branch chain amino </v>
<v Speaker 2>acids,</v>

3041
02:09:16.271 --> 02:09:17.104
<v Speaker 2>leucine within that is what will trigger</v>
<v Speaker 2>to your motor receptors to basically </v>

3042
02:09:20.321 --> 02:09:21.370
<v Speaker 2>repair and regrow.</v>

3043
02:09:21.790 --> 02:09:24.400
<v Speaker 2>So quite often you can have all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>protein in the world,</v>

3044
02:09:24.401 --> 02:09:29.260
<v Speaker 2>but if it's of a low biological value of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not very good quality protein,</v>

3045
02:09:29.261 --> 02:09:30.094
<v Speaker 2>your body is not going to assimilate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not about the protein that you </v>

3046
02:09:32.711 --> 02:09:34.480
<v Speaker 2>eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about the protein you assimilate.</v>

3047
02:09:34.810 --> 02:09:35.643
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would take branch chain amino </v>

3048
02:09:36.671 --> 02:09:39.340
<v Speaker 2>acids postworkout yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3049
02:09:39.341 --> 02:09:40.840
<v Speaker 2>And specific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said Leucine,</v>

3050
02:09:40.841 --> 02:09:45.580
<v Speaker 2>just to make sure that I was kickstarted</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole recovery process because soon</v>

3051
02:09:45.581 --> 02:09:47.290
<v Speaker 2>as you got out of the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after six hours,</v>

3052
02:09:47.291 --> 02:09:49.270
<v Speaker 2>there's always the temptation just I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to pass out,</v>

3053
02:09:49.540 --> 02:09:50.840
<v Speaker 2>I want to just go to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>

3054
02:09:50.850 --> 02:09:51.671
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just like,</v>

3055
02:09:51.671 --> 02:09:54.190
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got six hours to think.</v>

3056
02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Because when your backend now what about</v>
<v Speaker 2>your protein?</v>

3057
02:09:56.561 --> 02:09:57.394
<v Speaker 2>What you're getting it mostly from a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of whey protein just because of </v>

3058
02:09:59.771 --> 02:10:04.420
<v Speaker 2>efficiency and also as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to think in terms of the boat</v>

3059
02:10:04.421 --> 02:10:08.050
<v Speaker 2>and stocking food that like perishable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3060
02:10:08.051 --> 02:10:09.100
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

3061
02:10:09.101 --> 02:10:12.190
<v Speaker 2>as as much as I love my barbecue ribs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything like that,</v>

3062
02:10:12.191 --> 02:10:15.820
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't going to happen on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>small galley that we had on the boat.</v>

3063
02:10:15.850 --> 02:10:18.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get any fresh food,</v>

3064
02:10:18.131 --> 02:10:19.600
<v Speaker 2>eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything along those lines?</v>

3065
02:10:20.090 --> 02:10:21.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we could stop in a harbor,</v>

3066
02:10:21.940 --> 02:10:22.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the team would go out.</v>

3067
02:10:22.931 --> 02:10:23.764
<v Speaker 2>I'd never touched land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they could go and quit your </v>

3068
02:10:24.751 --> 02:10:27.880
<v Speaker 2>provision from land and bring it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But ultimately,</v>

3069
02:10:27.910 --> 02:10:28.743
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

3070
02:10:28.750 --> 02:10:32.950
<v Speaker 2>it was trying to find a way that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was sustainable as possible,</v>

3071
02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:34.160
<v Speaker 2>but within the</v>

3072
02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:36.550
<v Speaker 3>parameters that we had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3073
02:10:36.551 --> 02:10:38.030
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was what was tricky.</v>

3074
02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:38.953
<v Speaker 3>What about your joints?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine repetitive stress of </v>

3075
02:10:43.671 --> 02:10:46.610
<v Speaker 3>swimming would wreck havoc on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoulders.</v>

3076
02:10:46.700 --> 02:10:48.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why,</v>

3077
02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:50.090
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this goes back to,</v>

3078
02:10:50.660 --> 02:10:51.493
<v Speaker 3>I suppose this goes back and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to rich roll about this actually </v>

3079
02:10:53.420 --> 02:10:54.253
<v Speaker 3>where um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one she developed that sort of </v>

3080
02:10:57.170 --> 02:10:58.003
<v Speaker 3>horsepower program,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that work capacity that was talking </v>

3081
02:10:59.601 --> 02:11:02.420
<v Speaker 3>about before from when I ran the </v>
<v Speaker 3>marathon pulling a car.</v>

3082
02:11:02.450 --> 02:11:03.970
<v Speaker 3>It was um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

3083
02:11:04.040 --> 02:11:06.440
<v Speaker 3>this is such a strange story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I then that again,</v>

3084
02:11:06.441 --> 02:11:08.390
<v Speaker 3>to raise money for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the teenage cancer trust,</v>

3085
02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:10.580
<v Speaker 3>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I climbed a rope,</v>

3086
02:11:10.581 --> 02:11:11.414
<v Speaker 3>but I think it was a 10 meter rope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I repeated the climate until I </v>

3087
02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:16.760
<v Speaker 3>climbed the height of Everest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was a 8,000,</v>

3088
02:11:16.761 --> 02:11:17.594
<v Speaker 3>848 meters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was that that actually taught me </v>

3089
02:11:20.871 --> 02:11:21.704
<v Speaker 3>that movement efficiency play such an </v>
<v Speaker 3>important role in terms of endurance </v>

3090
02:11:25.911 --> 02:11:27.800
<v Speaker 3>because you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could be,</v>

3091
02:11:27.801 --> 02:11:29.510
<v Speaker 3>you could have the best muscular </v>
<v Speaker 3>endurance,</v>

3092
02:11:29.511 --> 02:11:30.080
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cartier,</v>

3093
02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:30.650
<v Speaker 3>spiritual insurance.</v>

3094
02:11:30.650 --> 02:11:32.510
<v Speaker 3>But if you can imagine with a rope </v>
<v Speaker 3>climb,</v>

3095
02:11:33.050 --> 02:11:35.210
<v Speaker 3>if you're solely relying on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>muscles,</v>

3096
02:11:35.211 --> 02:11:37.700
<v Speaker 3>your arms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like your bicep tendon is just,</v>

3097
02:11:37.820 --> 02:11:38.653
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you can be the fittest guy in </v>

3098
02:11:40.011 --> 02:11:42.230
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But within that kinetic chain,</v>

3099
02:11:42.530 --> 02:11:44.940
<v Speaker 3>something's going to give like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>weakest part.</v>

3100
02:11:45.270 --> 02:11:47.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you're right from that I had the,</v>

3101
02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:50.660
<v Speaker 3>the work capacity from the marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then from the rope climb,</v>

3102
02:11:50.661 --> 02:11:53.150
<v Speaker 3>I certainly understood movement </v>
<v Speaker 3>efficiency.</v>

3103
02:11:53.300 --> 02:11:55.590
<v Speaker 3>And so sort of transferring those skills</v>
<v Speaker 3>over to,</v>

3104
02:11:55.690 --> 02:11:56.523
<v Speaker 3>to swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew that you couldn't swim like a </v>

3105
02:11:58.731 --> 02:12:01.040
<v Speaker 3>conventional swimmer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything that had taught you,</v>

3106
02:12:01.041 --> 02:12:01.874
<v Speaker 3>especially in waves and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I ended up developing quite a weird </v>

3107
02:12:04.971 --> 02:12:07.090
<v Speaker 3>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They look really slow and comes from,</v>

3108
02:12:07.100 --> 02:12:08.780
<v Speaker 3>I also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I almost looked to sleep,</v>

3109
02:12:08.781 --> 02:12:09.614
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really rolling and that's why I </v>

3110
02:12:10.971 --> 02:12:13.670
<v Speaker 3>asked you about swimming and even </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at,</v>

3111
02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:14.380
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3112
02:12:14.380 --> 02:12:15.690
<v Speaker 3>Bert again to use him as that.</v>

3113
02:12:15.690 --> 02:12:16.523
<v Speaker 3>But I know he does his triathlon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for everything that is taught about </v>

3114
02:12:20.631 --> 02:12:23.420
<v Speaker 3>swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably for someone who looks like</v>

3115
02:12:23.421 --> 02:12:26.870
<v Speaker 3>you know Michael Phelps or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an amazing specimen at swimming.</v>

3116
02:12:26.871 --> 02:12:31.871
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying births fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was always saying I am silly.</v>

3117
02:12:32.900 --> 02:12:34.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for the record,</v>

3118
02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:36.290
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the record,</v>

3119
02:12:36.300 --> 02:12:41.300
<v Speaker 3>I've heard it as a repeated diapers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I for the record on record,</v>

3120
02:12:44.001 --> 02:12:49.001
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a specimen of a male.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like well listen,</v>

3121
02:12:52.551 --> 02:12:56.150
<v Speaker 3>we are photographic evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That photo of him with his belly hanging</v>

3122
02:12:56.151 --> 02:12:59.390
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the most ridiculous is after he ran</v>

3123
02:12:59.391 --> 02:13:00.224
<v Speaker 3>a marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this pre or post as sober October </v>

3124
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:05.840
<v Speaker 3>cause he's really lost a lot now though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lost 18 pounds during sober October.</v>

3125
02:13:05.841 --> 02:13:08.390
<v Speaker 3>He's the only one that lost weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gained weight but there was that video</v>

3126
02:13:08.410 --> 02:13:10.240
<v Speaker 3>cause he was dancing in his bathroom </v>
<v Speaker 3>recently,</v>

3127
02:13:10.260 --> 02:13:10.940
<v Speaker 3>wasn't it?</v>

3128
02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:12.890
<v Speaker 3>Where they look at this photo denim </v>
<v Speaker 3>pants,</v>

3129
02:13:13.550 --> 02:13:16.160
<v Speaker 3>that's not even the worst one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love.</v>

3130
02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:20.330
<v Speaker 3>Why is Bert Kreischer Chrysler so fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>

3131
02:13:20.630 --> 02:13:25.570
<v Speaker 3>that is a fine specimen of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the one that's one basie,</v>

3132
02:13:25.740 --> 02:13:29.060
<v Speaker 3>because he wore those for the way in is </v>
<v Speaker 3>he got me sober October.</v>

3133
02:13:29.061 --> 02:13:31.430
<v Speaker 3>He has got a bunch of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got more than one spot.</v>

3134
02:13:32.730 --> 02:13:34.560
<v Speaker 3>That's what he wears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love him.</v>

3135
02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:35.573
<v Speaker 3>I love him more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that he ran a marathon with </v>

3136
02:13:37.711 --> 02:13:40.890
<v Speaker 3>that body that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3137
02:13:40.891 --> 02:13:44.250
<v Speaker 3>running Lamont's in a pinto fit neat </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't get enough credit.</v>

3138
02:13:44.251 --> 02:13:45.084
<v Speaker 3>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't get enough credit Karma and </v>

3139
02:13:49.500 --> 02:13:52.380
<v Speaker 3>everything that you have that's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

3140
02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:55.890
<v Speaker 3>It's not that big that's in photoshop or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

3141
02:13:56.720 --> 02:13:57.553
<v Speaker 3>It would be the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be the same with you that if we </v>

3142
02:13:59.041 --> 02:14:01.830
<v Speaker 3>were looking at your swimming technique,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there'd be certain everything that you'd</v>

3143
02:14:01.831 --> 02:14:02.664
<v Speaker 3>probably learn probably wouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 3>applicable to you because of how broad </v>

3144
02:14:04.741 --> 02:14:06.540
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how things that you could actually use.</v>

3145
02:14:06.540 --> 02:14:08.880
<v Speaker 3>So I was basically really engaging the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lats,</v>

3146
02:14:08.890 --> 02:14:10.770
<v Speaker 3>the traps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the larger muscles of the back.</v>

3147
02:14:10.950 --> 02:14:11.780
<v Speaker 3>Going back to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3148
02:14:11.780 --> 02:14:12.613
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the video with Brian Shore when he was </v>

3149
02:14:13.891 --> 02:14:15.650
<v Speaker 3>just ripping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3150
02:14:16.170 --> 02:14:19.060
<v Speaker 3>Was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or ripping out the floor and,</v>

3151
02:14:19.110 --> 02:14:21.540
<v Speaker 3>and I knew that I couldn't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

3152
02:14:21.541 --> 02:14:26.541
<v Speaker 3>Looking at Delta high catch high elbows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to do high elbows for 150 70</v>

3153
02:14:27.631 --> 02:14:28.464
<v Speaker 3>days for Tava right new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everything that I'd learned and </v>

3154
02:14:32.011 --> 02:14:32.844
<v Speaker 3>certainly you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great friends of mine who are in Liam </v>

3155
02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:38.310
<v Speaker 3>tank got 50 meter world record on a back</v>
<v Speaker 3>stroke in a carry on paying double world</v>

3156
02:14:38.311 --> 02:14:41.250
<v Speaker 3>champion 10 k.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are amazing athletes.</v>

3157
02:14:41.730 --> 02:14:45.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm not one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you developed more efficient,</v>

3158
02:14:45.031 --> 02:14:48.480
<v Speaker 3>slower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a style that you could continue for five</v>

3159
02:14:48.481 --> 02:14:51.930
<v Speaker 3>months and you just end up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like moving meditation.</v>

3160
02:14:51.931 --> 02:14:53.730
<v Speaker 3>It just became like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3161
02:14:53.731 --> 02:14:56.430
<v Speaker 3>the limiting factor was just like I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just getting bored.</v>

3162
02:14:56.430 --> 02:15:00.270
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't actually breathing thinking of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the thing,</v>

3163
02:15:00.271 --> 02:15:02.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean you had to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at any given time,</v>

3164
02:15:02.851 --> 02:15:03.684
<v Speaker 3>any tied,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had to think of something that was </v>

3165
02:15:05.491 --> 02:15:06.324
<v Speaker 3>going to be more powerful than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought of stopping or fatigue or clcs </v>

3166
02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:10.913
<v Speaker 3>like getting deeper into your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so sometimes it was real easy </v>

3167
02:15:14.281 --> 02:15:17.250
<v Speaker 3>because you were swimming with dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>minky whales.</v>

3168
02:15:17.550 --> 02:15:20.160
<v Speaker 3>I swam with a basking shark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did they come over to you going,</v>

3169
02:15:20.161 --> 02:15:21.960
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is this dude doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3170
02:15:21.961 --> 02:15:23.160
<v Speaker 3>Like one it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3171
02:15:23.170 --> 02:15:25.010
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a video of the ages ago with the,</v>

3172
02:15:25.011 --> 02:15:25.844
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the main keywell and d I was filming 12 </v>

3173
02:15:27.541 --> 02:15:30.270
<v Speaker 3>hours across the Bristol channel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's kind of England to Wales.</v>

3174
02:15:30.660 --> 02:15:30.941
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3175
02:15:30.941 --> 02:15:31.774
<v Speaker 3>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was without doubt for all the </v>

3176
02:15:33.181 --> 02:15:34.014
<v Speaker 3>hardship that I spoke about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to say there were some </v>

3177
02:15:35.581 --> 02:15:39.150
<v Speaker 3>amazing moments this one particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment swimming across the,</v>

3178
02:15:39.151 --> 02:15:39.984
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Bristol Channel and all of a sudden </v>

3179
02:15:41.191 --> 02:15:42.024
<v Speaker 3>minky well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of about as big as this table </v>

3180
02:15:43.410 --> 02:15:44.730
<v Speaker 3>breaches right next to me.</v>

3181
02:15:44.770 --> 02:15:45.541
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

3182
02:15:45.541 --> 02:15:46.260
<v Speaker 3>like Tom's rise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3183
02:15:46.260 --> 02:15:47.580
<v Speaker 3>I turned to Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the captain,</v>

3184
02:15:47.581 --> 02:15:48.414
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3185
02:15:49.050 --> 02:15:50.670
<v Speaker 3>am I safe?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what's going on?</v>

3186
02:15:50.671 --> 02:15:51.570
<v Speaker 3>Like should I get out of the war?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

3187
02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:51.761
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3188
02:15:51.761 --> 02:15:51.991
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3189
02:15:51.991 --> 02:15:53.130
<v Speaker 3>you're absolutely fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

3190
02:15:53.131 --> 02:15:54.090
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause it's a minky whales,</v>

3191
02:15:54.290 --> 02:15:55.470
<v Speaker 3>the find the friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3192
02:15:55.471 --> 02:15:56.304
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fair enough.</v>

3193
02:15:56.520 --> 02:15:59.100
<v Speaker 3>So I keep swimming and then for the next</v>
<v Speaker 3>five miles,</v>

3194
02:15:59.101 --> 02:16:01.770
<v Speaker 3>the minky whales circling me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was breaching over the top.</v>

3195
02:16:01.771 --> 02:16:03.870
<v Speaker 3>It was coming under me and swimming like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3196
02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:05.840
<v Speaker 3>I turned to him and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matt,</v>

3197
02:16:05.940 --> 02:16:07.640
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

3198
02:16:07.670 --> 02:16:10.020
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been sailing like 40 years.</v>

3199
02:16:10.050 --> 02:16:11.160
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen this.</v>

3200
02:16:11.161 --> 02:16:14.100
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I think is happening is I think</v>

3201
02:16:14.101 --> 02:16:16.230
<v Speaker 3>it's a female,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I tried to fuck you.</v>

3202
02:16:16.350 --> 02:16:17.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3203
02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:19.820
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not mating season is it?</v>

3204
02:16:19.821 --> 02:16:20.181
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3205
02:16:20.181 --> 02:16:20.380
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3206
02:16:20.380 --> 02:16:20.851
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fine.</v>

3207
02:16:20.851 --> 02:16:21.421
<v Speaker 3>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

3208
02:16:21.421 --> 02:16:23.190
<v Speaker 3>what are these hats?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even you for later?</v>

3209
02:16:23.930 --> 02:16:28.930
<v Speaker 3>It was one for four months in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>swatter.</v>

3210
02:16:29.530 --> 02:16:30.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna fuck</v>

3211
02:16:30.210 --> 02:16:32.770
<v Speaker 2>her mating seasons probably right around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the corner.</v>

3212
02:16:32.771 --> 02:16:34.200
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he sticks around,</v>

3213
02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:39.700
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always like,</v>

3214
02:16:39.701 --> 02:16:40.534
<v Speaker 2>you knew what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a concern of mine that was a </v>

3215
02:16:42.550 --> 02:16:44.500
<v Speaker 2>kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no.</v>

3216
02:16:44.501 --> 02:16:45.110
<v Speaker 2>Matt said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3217
02:16:45.110 --> 02:16:45.370
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3218
02:16:45.370 --> 02:16:46.203
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a few more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that she thinks that you're an </v>

3219
02:16:48.281 --> 02:16:49.114
<v Speaker 2>injured seal five miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She basically guided me all the way to </v>

3220
02:16:53.831 --> 02:16:58.480
<v Speaker 2>the shallow water and as I got there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was literally the depth of the water.</v>

3221
02:16:58.481 --> 02:16:59.310
<v Speaker 2>Matt said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

3222
02:16:59.310 --> 02:17:01.160
<v Speaker 2>Yet much shallower water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we turned,</v>

3223
02:17:01.300 --> 02:17:04.960
<v Speaker 2>we were breached one more time and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then swim off as if to say,</v>

3224
02:17:04.961 --> 02:17:05.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're safe now.</v>

3225
02:17:05.890 --> 02:17:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

3226
02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:10.210
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

3227
02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:11.073
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for all of the hardship and </v>

3228
02:17:12.281 --> 02:17:14.960
<v Speaker 2>everything that I described,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were moments and sunsets and,</v>

3229
02:17:14.961 --> 02:17:18.730
<v Speaker 2>and swimming with seals and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was amazing.</v>

3230
02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:20.980
<v Speaker 2>And also that's the basking shark.</v>

3231
02:17:21.220 --> 02:17:23.120
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you encountered?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3232
02:17:23.121 --> 02:17:25.660
<v Speaker 2>So that was in the actual one you </v>
<v Speaker 2>encountered?</v>

3233
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:27.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean also in behind,</v>

3234
02:17:27.860 --> 02:17:29.800
<v Speaker 2>you could swim in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

3235
02:17:30.550 --> 02:17:32.440
<v Speaker 2>I was concerned about that one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't know.</v>

3236
02:17:32.441 --> 02:17:34.000
<v Speaker 2>So that's a basking shark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're friendly.</v>

3237
02:17:34.030 --> 02:17:35.770
<v Speaker 2>But the Mac,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you imagine seeing that?</v>

3238
02:17:35.771 --> 02:17:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Like assuming free Scotland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not mountains,</v>

3239
02:17:38.250 --> 02:17:39.460
<v Speaker 2>either side of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

3240
02:17:39.670 --> 02:17:42.490
<v Speaker 2>so to your point about asking what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about,</v>

3241
02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:43.953
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy to swim when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you know this dolphins and </v>

3242
02:17:46.511 --> 02:17:47.344
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's times when you are lost in </v>

3243
02:17:49.151 --> 02:17:52.750
<v Speaker 2>this moving meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you see something like that and</v>

3244
02:17:52.751 --> 02:17:54.910
<v Speaker 2>you very quickly got to get your wits </v>
<v Speaker 2>about you.</v>

3245
02:17:55.610 --> 02:17:57.550
<v Speaker 2>Cause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause they were killer whales as well,</v>

3246
02:17:57.570 --> 02:17:58.121
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3247
02:17:58.121 --> 02:17:58.954
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming from sort of Iceland around the </v>

3248
02:17:59.591 --> 02:18:01.570
<v Speaker 2>top of Scotland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>

3249
02:18:01.571 --> 02:18:02.470
<v Speaker 2>that was a concern.</v>

3250
02:18:02.500 --> 02:18:05.890
<v Speaker 2>Were they interested in you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thankfully we didn't see any,</v>

3251
02:18:06.040 --> 02:18:07.740
<v Speaker 2>but they wouldn't attack you or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

3252
02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:08.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is it.</v>

3253
02:18:08.681 --> 02:18:11.140
<v Speaker 2>So we were speaking with marine </v>
<v Speaker 2>biologists at the time saying,</v>

3254
02:18:11.141 --> 02:18:13.390
<v Speaker 2>look like what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the situation here?</v>

3255
02:18:13.690 --> 02:18:14.590
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3256
02:18:14.770 --> 02:18:16.270
<v Speaker 2>you know what's really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>

3257
02:18:16.290 --> 02:18:17.710
<v Speaker 2>So intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3258
02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:22.240
<v Speaker 2>killer whales are so intelligent and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've never been known.</v>

3259
02:18:22.390 --> 02:18:23.223
<v Speaker 2>This was what they said to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've never been known in the wild to </v>

3260
02:18:25.901 --> 02:18:27.190
<v Speaker 2>attack a human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

3261
02:18:27.220 --> 02:18:28.180
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fantastic.</v>

3262
02:18:28.240 --> 02:18:29.350
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

3263
02:18:29.860 --> 02:18:30.693
<v Speaker 2>if they're going to attack a human is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably going to be you because no </v>

3264
02:18:32.471 --> 02:18:35.530
<v Speaker 2>one's ever spent that amount of time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the water as well,</v>

3265
02:18:35.860 --> 02:18:36.820
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

3266
02:18:36.821 --> 02:18:37.361
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

3267
02:18:37.361 --> 02:18:40.320
<v Speaker 2>all you need to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

3268
02:18:40.390 --> 02:18:42.430
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they just said,</v>

3269
02:18:42.431 --> 02:18:45.430
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you need to do is make sure that you</v>

3270
02:18:45.670 --> 02:18:46.690
<v Speaker 2>don't look like a seal.</v>

3271
02:18:46.690 --> 02:18:48.910
<v Speaker 2>Cause they might mistake you for a seal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they might bite you.</v>

3272
02:18:49.300 --> 02:18:50.560
<v Speaker 2>But then they will go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh Whoa,</v>

3273
02:18:50.590 --> 02:18:51.550
<v Speaker 2>did that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that intelligent.</v>

3274
02:18:51.551 --> 02:18:51.930
<v Speaker 2>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3275
02:18:51.930 --> 02:18:54.370
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't taste like a seal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they might,</v>

3276
02:18:54.371 --> 02:18:56.650
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was just trying my best not to look</v>

3277
02:18:56.651 --> 02:18:57.484
<v Speaker 2>like a seal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when they have attack people in </v>

3278
02:18:59.021 --> 02:19:02.980
<v Speaker 2>the wild or toys or in captivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always been trainers.</v>

3279
02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:04.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's been an anger,</v>

3280
02:19:04.660 --> 02:19:06.150
<v Speaker 2>frustration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3281
02:19:06.610 --> 02:19:07.443
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was my experience with the </v>

3282
02:19:08.830 --> 02:19:09.970
<v Speaker 2>Minkwon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything it was,</v>

3283
02:19:10.210 --> 02:19:11.740
<v Speaker 2>people said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how'd you swim at night?</v>

3284
02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Because certainly around a west of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Scotland there was,</v>

3285
02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:17.050
<v Speaker 2>it was a debt for 200 meters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just,</v>

3286
02:19:17.170 --> 02:19:18.910
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what's under you.</v>

3287
02:19:21.090 --> 02:19:21.923
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3288
02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:23.313
<v Speaker 2>there was that element but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think having swum with the minky </v>

3289
02:19:26.571 --> 02:19:27.404
<v Speaker 2>well around the Bristol Channel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very aware that in the hierarchy </v>

3290
02:19:30.681 --> 02:19:31.514
<v Speaker 2>of the sea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very low down the pecking order </v>

3291
02:19:33.750 --> 02:19:34.210
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3292
02:19:34.210 --> 02:19:36.350
<v Speaker 2>and if it's comforting in any strange </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

3293
02:19:36.351 --> 02:19:36.891
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3294
02:19:36.891 --> 02:19:39.170
<v Speaker 2>if I was going to be eaten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be eaten in the day just as much as</v>

3295
02:19:39.171 --> 02:19:40.560
<v Speaker 2>I'll be eaten at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3296
02:19:40.970 --> 02:19:43.070
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just one of those things darkness.</v>

3297
02:19:43.310 --> 02:19:44.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3298
02:19:44.061 --> 02:19:44.894
<v Speaker 2>Just like you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't see the hand in front of your </v>

3299
02:19:46.131 --> 02:19:49.040
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the Maury first for instance,</v>

3300
02:19:49.041 --> 02:19:49.874
<v Speaker 2>we will a 40 Mars away from land and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of cutting across this huge </v>

3301
02:19:54.111 --> 02:19:57.010
<v Speaker 2>bay across the top of Scotland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

3302
02:19:57.550 --> 02:19:58.383
<v Speaker 2>it was clouded over so there was not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can even see anything cause there </v>

3303
02:20:00.591 --> 02:20:01.424
<v Speaker 2>was no moonlight or no stars and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a you in that complete sensory </v>

3304
02:20:06.351 --> 02:20:07.370
<v Speaker 2>deprivation.</v>

3305
02:20:07.730 --> 02:20:11.870
<v Speaker 2>You can hear everything and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you hear a noise,</v>

3306
02:20:11.871 --> 02:20:12.860
<v Speaker 2>a reporter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

3307
02:20:12.861 --> 02:20:13.694
<v Speaker 2>I really hope that's not a killer whale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you've then got six hours to </v>

3308
02:20:16.941 --> 02:20:19.070
<v Speaker 2>contemplate whether it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's this,</v>

3309
02:20:19.071 --> 02:20:20.330
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

3310
02:20:20.331 --> 02:20:21.800
<v Speaker 2>Marcus Aurelius,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meditations,</v>

3311
02:20:21.801 --> 02:20:22.634
<v Speaker 2>stoic philosophy that the conversations </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have in your own head are just as </v>

3312
02:20:25.341 --> 02:20:26.174
<v Speaker 2>powerful with other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I certainly found that all the way </v>

3313
02:20:28.161 --> 02:20:29.750
<v Speaker 2>around that you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3314
02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:32.210
<v Speaker 2>there was times when you were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing out here?</v>

3315
02:20:32.260 --> 02:20:33.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously?</v>

3316
02:20:34.130 --> 02:20:37.220
<v Speaker 2>And that comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

3317
02:20:37.310 --> 02:20:38.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3318
02:20:38.091 --> 02:20:41.330
<v Speaker 2>this idea of you have to be doing it for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right reasons.</v>

3319
02:20:41.500 --> 02:20:43.100
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've I again to,</v>

3320
02:20:43.110 --> 02:20:45.920
<v Speaker 2>to bring it back to mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose it's really fascinated me.</v>

3321
02:20:45.921 --> 02:20:48.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some fighters in a ladelle coming out of</v>

3322
02:20:48.111 --> 02:20:50.060
<v Speaker 2>retirement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all tease and certainly,</v>

3323
02:20:50.061 --> 02:20:50.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3324
02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:52.820
<v Speaker 2>Mcgregor is made so much money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3325
02:20:52.821 --> 02:20:53.654
<v Speaker 2>what would get him back out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>retirement to come and fight mayweather </v>

3326
02:20:56.091 --> 02:20:56.930
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

3327
02:20:56.931 --> 02:20:57.764
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been out at sea so I didn't quite </v>

3328
02:20:58.641 --> 02:21:00.500
<v Speaker 2>understand what was going on there with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3329
02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:03.380
<v Speaker 2>his kind of going over to as a Japan </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>

3330
02:21:03.380 --> 02:21:04.880
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does he need?</v>

3331
02:21:04.881 --> 02:21:05.870
<v Speaker 2>He's got so much money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3332
02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:09.160
<v Speaker 4>What would warrant a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether they were the spends money,</v>

3333
02:21:09.650 --> 02:21:13.330
<v Speaker 4>spends money like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was gonna fight tension,</v>

3334
02:21:13.810 --> 02:21:14.643
<v Speaker 4>tension.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you pronounce his last name </v>

3335
02:21:16.021 --> 02:21:17.340
<v Speaker 4>correctly?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Sue Cowell.</v>

3336
02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:18.260
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I've been at a seat,</v>

3337
02:21:18.261 --> 02:21:19.690
<v Speaker 4>so I didn't really see what was going on</v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

3338
02:21:20.050 --> 02:21:20.883
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me see if you find that on my </v>

3339
02:21:22.391 --> 02:21:24.190
<v Speaker 4>instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's out of his fucking mind.</v>

3340
02:21:24.310 --> 02:21:26.210
<v Speaker 4>Would that have been a bad idea?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Horrible.</v>

3341
02:21:26.230 --> 02:21:29.240
<v Speaker 4>He would get head kicked into a coma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you,</v>

3342
02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:30.740
<v Speaker 4>but you kind of ask like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

3343
02:21:30.741 --> 02:21:31.990
<v Speaker 4>what are the reasons?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>

3344
02:21:31.991 --> 02:21:34.690
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he spends a shit ton of money.</v>

3345
02:21:35.350 --> 02:21:38.020
<v Speaker 4>You think they're trying to get it back </v>
<v Speaker 4>on track?</v>

3346
02:21:38.400 --> 02:21:41.920
<v Speaker 4>I said floyd had been duped into </v>
<v Speaker 4>agreeing to the contest.</v>

3347
02:21:42.180 --> 02:21:43.390
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they will do him.</v>

3348
02:21:43.450 --> 02:21:46.390
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are very different if those,</v>

3349
02:21:46.570 --> 02:21:49.120
<v Speaker 4>if this happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe you me,</v>

3350
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:52.010
<v Speaker 4>he's going to get kicked in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to,</v>

3351
02:21:52.330 --> 02:21:53.560
<v Speaker 4>they might say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3352
02:21:53.561 --> 02:21:55.180
<v Speaker 4>no Kiki,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no Kiki,</v>

3353
02:21:55.600 --> 02:21:58.120
<v Speaker 4>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get in the ring with tension.</v>

3354
02:21:58.490 --> 02:22:02.560
<v Speaker 4>He's going to try to roundhouse kick you</v>
<v Speaker 4>into another fucking dimension.</v>

3355
02:22:02.710 --> 02:22:04.080
<v Speaker 4>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a special bounce.</v>

3356
02:22:04.081 --> 02:22:04.914
<v Speaker 4>So there's gonna be no kicking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they agreed to the </v>

3357
02:22:07.601 --> 02:22:09.040
<v Speaker 4>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3358
02:22:09.100 --> 02:22:12.010
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But tension not Sukarno was,</v>

3359
02:22:12.190 --> 02:22:15.700
<v Speaker 4>I think he's 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's 20 years old.</v>

3360
02:22:16.090 --> 02:22:20.020
<v Speaker 4>He's a really fantastic talent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3361
02:22:20.140 --> 02:22:20.951
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3362
02:22:20.951 --> 02:22:21.880
<v Speaker 4>he really is,</v>

3363
02:22:22.250 --> 02:22:23.390
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it fascinates me.</v>

3364
02:22:23.391 --> 02:22:25.140
<v Speaker 2>So I'm catching up on all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

3365
02:22:25.141 --> 02:22:25.980
<v Speaker 2>so I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've missed</v>

3366
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:27.670
<v Speaker 4>all of this for 157.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'd look sad.</v>

3367
02:22:27.710 --> 02:22:30.030
<v Speaker 4>I even missed the mcgregor and </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] and stuff.</v>

3368
02:22:30.031 --> 02:22:33.420
<v Speaker 4>Go do a striking breakdowns on </v>
<v Speaker 4>instagram.</v>

3369
02:22:33.421 --> 02:22:34.254
<v Speaker 4>Lawrence tension has a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's done a bunch of breakdowns as is </v>

3370
02:22:37.351 --> 02:22:40.590
<v Speaker 4>Brendan Dorm has done a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>breakdowns to on tension,</v>

3371
02:22:40.980 --> 02:22:41.813
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3372
02:22:42.150 --> 02:22:42.983
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lawrence Kenshin has this really </v>

3373
02:22:44.431 --> 02:22:48.960
<v Speaker 4>fascinating video of him fighting this </v>
<v Speaker 4>world Moitai champion.</v>

3374
02:22:49.170 --> 02:22:51.600
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wheel kicks him in the head,</v>

3375
02:22:51.630 --> 02:22:54.780
<v Speaker 4>was more like a jump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spinning back kick to the chin.</v>

3376
02:22:54.781 --> 02:22:57.960
<v Speaker 4>But the way he did it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like a really weird angle and you</v>

3377
02:22:57.961 --> 02:22:58.794
<v Speaker 4>could see them setting it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's really creative and he just found </v>

3378
02:23:01.591 --> 02:23:06.591
<v Speaker 4>like a weird opening a for this guy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just kick this guy into oblivion.</v>

3379
02:23:07.980 --> 02:23:08.820
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

3380
02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.670
<v Speaker 4>he's nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's really sneaky,</v>

3381
02:23:11.850 --> 02:23:13.680
<v Speaker 4>like the kind of techniques that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>lands.</v>

3382
02:23:13.681 --> 02:23:14.514
<v Speaker 4>It's very clever with his reads and his </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding of distance and in what's </v>

3383
02:23:18.301 --> 02:23:19.290
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3384
02:23:19.291 --> 02:23:21.780
<v Speaker 4>Do you see it striking breakdowns on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on instagram?</v>

3385
02:23:22.480 --> 02:23:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Might not be the name of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

3386
02:23:25.280 --> 02:23:26.460
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's with this,</v>

3387
02:23:28.450 --> 02:23:29.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much money does he need?</v>

3388
02:23:29.901 --> 02:23:32.690
<v Speaker 4>He can call on spend that much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>

3389
02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:35.870
<v Speaker 4>I think he can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3390
02:23:35.871 --> 02:23:37.340
<v Speaker 4>and this is what I love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

3391
02:23:37.341 --> 02:23:39.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm only just catching up on this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like set out you,</v>

3392
02:23:39.201 --> 02:23:41.360
<v Speaker 4>I should point out I have been at sea </v>
<v Speaker 4>for 157 days,</v>

3393
02:23:41.361 --> 02:23:43.990
<v Speaker 4>but with everything that happened was </v>
<v Speaker 4>treating breakdowns.</v>

3394
02:23:44.270 --> 02:23:44.870
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on that.</v>

3395
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:47.180
<v Speaker 4>I just got to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Striking breakdowns.</v>

3396
02:23:50.380 --> 02:23:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3397
02:23:52.350 --> 02:23:53.200
<v Speaker 1>I typed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3398
02:23:54.380 --> 02:23:55.330
<v Speaker 1>Start coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

3399
02:23:56.990 --> 02:23:59.300
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there's something wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 4>instagram.</v>

3400
02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

3401
02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:05.260
<v Speaker 4>I got it right here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here.</v>

3402
02:24:05.261 --> 02:24:06.550
<v Speaker 4>I'll send you the link.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

3403
02:24:06.610 --> 02:24:08.080
<v Speaker 4>so we could see a,</v>

3404
02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:11.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>

3405
02:24:11.321 --> 02:24:16.321
<v Speaker 1>I'll send you this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're toppy link.</v>

3406
02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Sorry folks.</v>

3407
02:24:20.310 --> 02:24:23.790
<v Speaker 4>But this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how much they were offering</v>

3408
02:24:23.791 --> 02:24:24.690
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3409
02:24:24.691 --> 02:24:27.810
<v Speaker 4>so I don't know how much I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just sent it to you.</v>

3410
02:24:28.590 --> 02:24:31.530
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it has to be millions of dollars.</v>

3411
02:24:31.740 --> 02:24:33.300
<v Speaker 4>That's the only way he'd be willing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do it.</v>

3412
02:24:33.990 --> 02:24:35.460
<v Speaker 4>But if they offer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he also,</v>

3413
02:24:35.461 --> 02:24:40.461
<v Speaker 4>tension is quite a bit smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he weighs one 30 and floyd walks</v>

3414
02:24:41.101 --> 02:24:41.934
<v Speaker 4>around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's fought at one 54 one 50 ish </v>

3415
02:24:44.860 --> 02:24:49.860
<v Speaker 4>and mcgregor was at 55 mm is this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this kid is fucking nasty man.</v>

3416
02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:54.750
<v Speaker 4>But he does a lot of wild shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a,</v>

3417
02:24:54.810 --> 02:24:59.220
<v Speaker 4>there's a video here or the see him </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight this Moy Thai guy and he hits them</v>

3418
02:24:59.280 --> 02:25:02.940
<v Speaker 4>with this crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when he was a little kid.</v>

3419
02:25:03.710 --> 02:25:07.790
<v Speaker 4>Like see how he does shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like sneaky shit under the sip,</v>

3420
02:25:07.810 --> 02:25:10.200
<v Speaker 4>sip and it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was young.</v>

3421
02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:12.450
<v Speaker 4>He was this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got this crank.</v>

3422
02:25:12.660 --> 02:25:15.150
<v Speaker 4>Oh this is the one with the World Moy </v>
<v Speaker 4>Thai champion.</v>

3423
02:25:15.330 --> 02:25:16.163
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Puts that due to sleep but the way set </v>

3424
02:25:19.891 --> 02:25:22.950
<v Speaker 4>it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a weird angle for that kick.</v>

3425
02:25:23.110 --> 02:25:24.370
<v Speaker 4>Very tight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3426
02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:26.950
<v Speaker 4>very tight clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it wasn't around.</v>

3427
02:25:26.951 --> 02:25:30.250
<v Speaker 4>It was straight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was basically like a jump,</v>

3428
02:25:30.251 --> 02:25:33.510
<v Speaker 4>spinning back kick to the chin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is hard to generate force.</v>

3429
02:25:33.590 --> 02:25:34.660
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3430
02:25:34.661 --> 02:25:35.111
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3431
02:25:35.111 --> 02:25:36.880
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This power.</v>

3432
02:25:37.330 --> 02:25:38.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3433
02:25:38.171 --> 02:25:40.810
<v Speaker 4>as long as he can get extension on his </v>
<v Speaker 4>legs,</v>

3434
02:25:40.830 --> 02:25:43.750
<v Speaker 4>it's just he had to jump and talk and </v>
<v Speaker 4>spin.</v>

3435
02:25:43.930 --> 02:25:44.763
<v Speaker 4>But the fact that he chose that angle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like he realized that the guy was </v>

3436
02:25:48.011 --> 02:25:49.870
<v Speaker 4>going to see things that were coming </v>
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>

3437
02:25:50.320 --> 02:25:53.710
<v Speaker 4>So instead of coming around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had it come up and,</v>

3438
02:25:53.711 --> 02:25:55.690
<v Speaker 4>and through the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

3439
02:25:55.691 --> 02:25:58.750
<v Speaker 4>which made it much sneakier but that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3440
02:25:58.940 --> 02:26:01.640
<v Speaker 2>What we're describing now is it never </v>
<v Speaker 2>intangible,</v>

3441
02:26:01.641 --> 02:26:03.140
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Creativity.</v>

3442
02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:04.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3443
02:26:04.551 --> 02:26:05.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3444
02:26:05.100 --> 02:26:05.933
<v Speaker 2>I'm what I find it so interesting when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Mcgregor Diaz and I was just </v>

3445
02:26:11.091 --> 02:26:12.680
<v Speaker 2>say I'm a huge fan of Ido,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor towel.</v>

3446
02:26:12.681 --> 02:26:15.100
<v Speaker 2>So when they use their own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was just like,</v>

3447
02:26:15.101 --> 02:26:16.100
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it was,</v>

3448
02:26:16.101 --> 02:26:17.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think mcgregor was on,</v>

3449
02:26:18.480 --> 02:26:20.180
<v Speaker 2>I want to say Kimmel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it was,</v>

3450
02:26:20.181 --> 02:26:23.530
<v Speaker 2>he was on a chat show and he was talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about that spinning cap aware,</v>

3451
02:26:23.570 --> 02:26:25.700
<v Speaker 2>a crescent kick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he actually did it.</v>

3452
02:26:25.701 --> 02:26:26.810
<v Speaker 2>He performed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3453
02:26:26.811 --> 02:26:28.040
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he lands that,</v>

3454
02:26:28.180 --> 02:26:30.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same way with Aldo,</v>

3455
02:26:30.350 --> 02:26:33.340
<v Speaker 2>it's be like that is the movement is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3456
02:26:33.341 --> 02:26:35.750
<v Speaker 2>you can forget cardiorespiratory </v>
<v Speaker 2>endurance,</v>

3457
02:26:35.751 --> 02:26:37.460
<v Speaker 2>strength,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that we talked about that the</v>

3458
02:26:37.461 --> 02:26:38.800
<v Speaker 2>metric saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3459
02:26:38.810 --> 02:26:39.850
<v Speaker 2>heavy where you gotta be two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

3460
02:26:39.860 --> 02:26:40.491
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3461
02:26:40.491 --> 02:26:41.350
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3462
02:26:41.410 --> 02:26:42.243
<v Speaker 2>it's just movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would have reinvented and again more </v>

3463
02:26:45.010 --> 02:26:47.770
<v Speaker 2>and I could be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we do yet he did try it,</v>

3464
02:26:47.780 --> 02:26:49.700
<v Speaker 2>didn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it missed I think,</v>

3465
02:26:50.750 --> 02:26:52.700
<v Speaker 4>I believe he did look through it through</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3466
02:26:52.730 --> 02:26:54.260
<v Speaker 4>I think he threw it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing,</v>

3467
02:26:54.350 --> 02:26:56.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that technique is a legit technique.</v>

3468
02:26:56.991 --> 02:26:59.600
<v Speaker 4>Obviously we'll kicks most certainly </v>
<v Speaker 4>work,</v>

3469
02:27:00.110 --> 02:27:03.470
<v Speaker 4>but it's not a high percentage technique</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't,</v>

3470
02:27:03.860 --> 02:27:07.430
<v Speaker 4>there's only been a few.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll kick knockouts in in the UFC.</v>

3471
02:27:07.610 --> 02:27:09.800
<v Speaker 4>The first one was Edson Barboza over </v>
<v Speaker 4>Terry.</v>

3472
02:27:09.801 --> 02:27:10.940
<v Speaker 4>Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was number one.</v>

3473
02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:13.290
<v Speaker 4>There's been a few since then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3474
02:27:13.340 --> 02:27:16.460
<v Speaker 4>Vitor Belfort shocked Luke rockhold with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the wheel kick.</v>

3475
02:27:16.461 --> 02:27:17.750
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's happened before.</v>

3476
02:27:17.770 --> 02:27:18.440
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3477
02:27:18.440 --> 02:27:21.740
<v Speaker 4>but it's just not a high percentage kick</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's usually a kick that's,</v>

3478
02:27:22.340 --> 02:27:23.173
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's</v>

3479
02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:24.960
<v Speaker 2>nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't expect it.</v>

3480
02:27:25.050 --> 02:27:26.210
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's a bit,</v>

3481
02:27:26.250 --> 02:27:30.240
<v Speaker 2>but can you tell when someone has it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't cause it's an intangible.</v>

3482
02:27:30.241 --> 02:27:34.950
<v Speaker 2>So if you said if it there started the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Barboza and atom fight,</v>

3483
02:27:34.951 --> 02:27:36.420
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3484
02:27:36.421 --> 02:27:40.710
<v Speaker 2>knock out by timing or creativity you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>st like why would you mean?</v>

3485
02:27:40.711 --> 02:27:41.544
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you could foresee that the same </v>

3486
02:27:43.021 --> 02:27:46.620
<v Speaker 2>way that you could quantify that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental fortitude.</v>

3487
02:27:46.650 --> 02:27:50.360
<v Speaker 2>I think you start opening the door in </v>
<v Speaker 2>sports performance into something that's</v>

3488
02:27:50.370 --> 02:27:54.300
<v Speaker 2>just this whole other realm that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't talk about weight as a metric.</v>

3489
02:27:54.301 --> 02:27:56.390
<v Speaker 2>Strength,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cardiorespiratory endurance.</v>

3490
02:27:56.391 --> 02:27:59.120
<v Speaker 2>You can start talking you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that hard to see again?</v>

3491
02:27:59.380 --> 02:28:01.470
<v Speaker 2>Take well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with creativity,</v>

3492
02:28:01.471 --> 02:28:03.540
<v Speaker 2>especially in regards to striking </v>
<v Speaker 2>technique.</v>

3493
02:28:03.541 --> 02:28:04.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3494
02:28:04.220 --> 02:28:05.053
<v Speaker 4>that's a crazy intangible because you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially deciding when to move and </v>

3495
02:28:09.321 --> 02:28:10.490
<v Speaker 4>what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3496
02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:13.160
<v Speaker 4>Like you can throw a jab,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you throw a front kick,</v>

3497
02:28:13.310 --> 02:28:14.143
<v Speaker 4>you could throw a roundhouse kick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could throw a wheel kick and you </v>

3498
02:28:15.741 --> 02:28:16.574
<v Speaker 4>throw a turning side kick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could throw an ax kick if you're </v>

3499
02:28:18.321 --> 02:28:18.981
<v Speaker 4>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3500
02:28:18.981 --> 02:28:20.660
<v Speaker 4>and this is a lot of different things </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can do.</v>

3501
02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:23.300
<v Speaker 4>So do you decide to do and why do you </v>
<v Speaker 4>say to do it?</v>

3502
02:28:23.410 --> 02:28:24.243
<v Speaker 4>Is it because you have a style like some</v>
<v Speaker 4>people style is like conor likes to hop </v>

3503
02:28:27.921 --> 02:28:30.260
<v Speaker 4>in and out and he throws like a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>front leg sidekick.</v>

3504
02:28:30.500 --> 02:28:33.230
<v Speaker 4>He throws like that for movement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He likes to keep his arms wide.</v>

3505
02:28:33.231 --> 02:28:34.064
<v Speaker 4>It makes his tennis sideways stance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some guys like to hold up like this and </v>

3506
02:28:37.421 --> 02:28:38.254
<v Speaker 4>the Moitai Shell and they move forward </v>
<v Speaker 4>lifting the front leg up and they move </v>

3507
02:28:41.391 --> 02:28:42.224
<v Speaker 4>forward and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and challenge with leg kicks and </v>

3508
02:28:43.731 --> 02:28:44.570
<v Speaker 4>striking technique.</v>

3509
02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:46.530
<v Speaker 4>Some guys just like to wrestle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

3510
02:28:46.540 --> 02:28:47.373
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll pour at you and they look to </v>

3511
02:28:48.441 --> 02:28:50.140
<v Speaker 4>shoot like Ben Aspirin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3512
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:52.040
<v Speaker 4>he's not looking to stand up and strike </v>
<v Speaker 4>with anybody.</v>

3513
02:28:52.041 --> 02:28:53.960
<v Speaker 4>He's looking at taking the ground beat </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fuck out of you.</v>

3514
02:28:54.320 --> 02:28:55.670
<v Speaker 4>That's what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's all,</v>

3515
02:28:55.671 --> 02:28:56.504
<v Speaker 4>and what do you decide to do and why do </v>
<v Speaker 4>you decide to do it and when do you </v>

3516
02:29:00.591 --> 02:29:02.780
<v Speaker 4>decide to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When do you engage?</v>

3517
02:29:03.020 --> 02:29:04.940
<v Speaker 4>You know you're throwing some faints,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3518
02:29:04.941 --> 02:29:08.060
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to be the guy who makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>it obvious that you moving forward.</v>

3519
02:29:08.270 --> 02:29:11.300
<v Speaker 4>Cause then like connor clipped Aldo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get rocked.</v>

3520
02:29:12.060 --> 02:29:13.570
<v Speaker 4>You know it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a crazy,</v>

3521
02:29:13.640 --> 02:29:15.460
<v Speaker 4>crazy sport is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you,</v>

3522
02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:19.470
<v Speaker 4>if you enter into that realm and even </v>
<v Speaker 4>start applying more sweats again,</v>

3523
02:29:19.490 --> 02:29:21.680
<v Speaker 4>we talked about that sort of strength </v>
<v Speaker 4>deficit as well.</v>

3524
02:29:21.681 --> 02:29:23.330
<v Speaker 4>That if you get someone um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3525
02:29:23.350 --> 02:29:24.830
<v Speaker 4>trying to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like John Jones who,</v>

3526
02:29:24.831 --> 02:29:25.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>move up to heavyweight,</v>

3527
02:29:25.821 --> 02:29:26.654
<v Speaker 4>is it going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will it benefit him winning with </v>

3528
02:29:28.020 --> 02:29:30.860
<v Speaker 4>strength training for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember.</v>

3529
02:29:30.860 --> 02:29:32.240
<v Speaker 4>He's dead lift,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's pretty impressive.</v>

3530
02:29:32.241 --> 02:29:33.980
<v Speaker 4>It's an impressive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was 600 pounds.</v>

3531
02:29:34.010 --> 02:29:35.030
<v Speaker 4>Big Dead Lift.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3532
02:29:35.031 --> 02:29:36.920
<v Speaker 4>So when you look at that strength </v>
<v Speaker 4>deficit,</v>

3533
02:29:36.921 --> 02:29:38.030
<v Speaker 4>Jon Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very lean,</v>

3534
02:29:38.031 --> 02:29:41.060
<v Speaker 4>was using neuro muscular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was recruiting voluntarily,</v>

3535
02:29:41.061 --> 02:29:43.040
<v Speaker 4>all of those muscle fibers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was unbelievable.</v>

3536
02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:44.990
<v Speaker 4>But if it means that to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would it be,</v>

3537
02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:47.480
<v Speaker 4>would any more muscle mass be </v>
<v Speaker 4>functional?</v>

3538
02:29:47.660 --> 02:29:51.140
<v Speaker 4>And I think when you start the question </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at when should he do that?</v>

3539
02:29:51.141 --> 02:29:54.020
<v Speaker 4>That's another good question because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're beating your body up to do that.</v>

3540
02:29:54.080 --> 02:29:54.913
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And is that conducive with a high </v>

3541
02:29:58.550 --> 02:30:03.400
<v Speaker 4>aerobic capacity training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like multiple rounds of sparring and bag</v>

3542
02:30:03.401 --> 02:30:04.234
<v Speaker 4>work and pad work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're all the lower back muscles </v>

3543
02:30:07.791 --> 02:30:08.624
<v Speaker 4>that are getting stressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And does that lead to potential </v>

3544
02:30:10.731 --> 02:30:14.390
<v Speaker 4>injuries?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is the potentially damaging his discs,</v>

3545
02:30:14.720 --> 02:30:17.150
<v Speaker 4>his knees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's a lot of a lot of things to</v>

3546
02:30:17.151 --> 02:30:17.690
<v Speaker 4>be considered.</v>

3547
02:30:17.690 --> 02:30:18.523
<v Speaker 4>And when should you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people that you think you </v>

3548
02:30:19.821 --> 02:30:21.730
<v Speaker 4>should do that when you're nowhere near </v>
<v Speaker 4>camp.</v>

3549
02:30:21.760 --> 02:30:22.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3550
02:30:22.460 --> 02:30:24.840
<v Speaker 4>Like you win a fight and then you decide</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

3551
02:30:24.860 --> 02:30:27.210
<v Speaker 4>to build up in between camps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3552
02:30:27.380 --> 02:30:29.770
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's so awful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even a Darren till,</v>

3553
02:30:29.850 --> 02:30:31.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is a huge,</v>

3554
02:30:31.551 --> 02:30:33.620
<v Speaker 4>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>huge currently,</v>

3555
02:30:33.621 --> 02:30:35.270
<v Speaker 4>but he's moving to middleweight and now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

3556
02:30:35.330 --> 02:30:36.163
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's missed weight and his title shot </v>

3557
02:30:37.491 --> 02:30:41.390
<v Speaker 4>against Tyron Woodley and then he got </v>
<v Speaker 4>rocked put away.</v>

3558
02:30:41.450 --> 02:30:43.670
<v Speaker 4>So if you're moving up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you do it?</v>

3559
02:30:43.671 --> 02:30:45.570
<v Speaker 4>Do you do it intelligently?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you?</v>

3560
02:30:45.571 --> 02:30:46.404
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then there are guys who were just </v>

3561
02:30:48.200 --> 02:30:49.033
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they say training is the real </v>

3562
02:30:50.580 --> 02:30:54.140
<v Speaker 4>realization of one's genetic potential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you get someone like,</v>

3563
02:30:54.240 --> 02:30:55.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rumble Johnson,</v>

3564
02:30:55.881 --> 02:30:56.960
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3565
02:30:56.980 --> 02:30:59.540
<v Speaker 4>now you never met.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He fought well tomorrow he made,</v>

3566
02:30:59.541 --> 02:31:00.111
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

3567
02:31:00.111 --> 02:31:02.630
<v Speaker 4>He made weight against Tyron Woodley,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't he?</v>

3568
02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:05.560
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He made waves with it.</v>

3569
02:31:05.561 --> 02:31:07.900
<v Speaker 4>He didn't make weight against Donald </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrone.</v>

3570
02:31:08.180 --> 02:31:09.200
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it was.</v>

3571
02:31:09.230 --> 02:31:11.360
<v Speaker 4>He came in very heavy and sounds around </v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

3572
02:31:11.640 --> 02:31:13.670
<v Speaker 4>He's a big motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What he is,</v>

3573
02:31:13.720 --> 02:31:15.920
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's so big for welterweight.</v>

3574
02:31:16.220 --> 02:31:18.860
<v Speaker 4>I think you'll be way better off at 185 </v>
<v Speaker 4>pounds.</v>

3575
02:31:18.861 --> 02:31:20.040
<v Speaker 4>But I think many of them will.</v>

3576
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:20.873
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a point of diminishing </v>
<v Speaker 3>returns where they are significantly </v>

3577
02:31:23.521 --> 02:31:26.070
<v Speaker 3>depleting themselves to make that </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight.</v>

3578
02:31:26.071 --> 02:31:27.480
<v Speaker 3>And then when they don't have to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3579
02:31:27.481 --> 02:31:30.030
<v Speaker 3>they have more energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we've seen that time and time again.</v>

3580
02:31:30.090 --> 02:31:32.040
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you did rumble Johnson,</v>

3581
02:31:32.041 --> 02:31:33.120
<v Speaker 3>he fought at welter weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3582
02:31:34.430 --> 02:31:38.670
<v Speaker 3>He's so big like gone and then all of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden mood a mood and then,</v>

3583
02:31:38.900 --> 02:31:39.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

3584
02:31:39.301 --> 02:31:40.860
<v Speaker 3>it no guerra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean nowhere.</v>

3585
02:31:40.970 --> 02:31:41.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

3586
02:31:41.911 --> 02:31:43.500
<v Speaker 3>When he just bounced the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heavyweight,</v>

3587
02:31:43.501 --> 02:31:45.900
<v Speaker 3>he did fight heavyweight successfully </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

3588
02:31:45.901 --> 02:31:48.600
<v Speaker 3>in um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Pfl he not,</v>

3589
02:31:48.601 --> 02:31:49.434
<v Speaker 3>he broke Andrea Orlowski his jaw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fucked Andrea Lawsky up as a </v>

3590
02:31:52.621 --> 02:31:53.980
<v Speaker 3>heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3591
02:31:54.180 --> 02:31:55.840
<v Speaker 3>And that's what always fascinates me is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3592
02:31:55.841 --> 02:32:00.841
<v Speaker 3>and I suppose when I see this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that God given kind of power yeah.</v>

3593
02:32:01.860 --> 02:32:05.280
<v Speaker 3>For all of the training it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was someone like,</v>

3594
02:32:05.790 --> 02:32:07.220
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Johnson and he,</v>

3595
02:32:07.230 --> 02:32:08.063
<v Speaker 3>cause he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I right thinking he said he's going </v>

3596
02:32:09.121 --> 02:32:11.550
<v Speaker 3>to come back for heavyweight if DC and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jones go up.</v>

3597
02:32:12.120 --> 02:32:13.650
<v Speaker 3>He's thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3598
02:32:13.680 --> 02:32:14.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's,</v>

3599
02:32:14.851 --> 02:32:16.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's in the weed game right now.</v>

3600
02:32:16.511 --> 02:32:19.650
<v Speaker 3>It's making some money selling weed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is legal now.</v>

3601
02:32:20.420 --> 02:32:22.140
<v Speaker 3>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's doing that.</v>

3602
02:32:22.440 --> 02:32:23.420
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3603
02:32:23.660 --> 02:32:26.130
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the size of him now.</v>

3604
02:32:26.370 --> 02:32:27.660
<v Speaker 3>But he fought hardy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3605
02:32:27.810 --> 02:32:30.060
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fought hardy and um,</v>

3606
02:32:30.150 --> 02:32:31.920
<v Speaker 3>he took him down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was interesting.</v>

3607
02:32:31.921 --> 02:32:33.960
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want to stand with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3608
02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:35.340
<v Speaker 3>Back in the day it was a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3609
02:32:35.341 --> 02:32:36.174
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they kind of made an agreement to stand </v>

3610
02:32:37.171 --> 02:32:39.360
<v Speaker 3>with each other and then he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch.</v>

3611
02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:41.940
<v Speaker 3>And he took him down and he won by </v>
<v Speaker 3>decision,</v>

3612
02:32:42.180 --> 02:32:43.770
<v Speaker 3>but that was a different rumble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Johnson,</v>

3613
02:32:43.771 --> 02:32:47.610
<v Speaker 3>I think the rumble Johnson at one 70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had no fucking energy.</v>

3614
02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.370
<v Speaker 3>He was on death's door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just always exhausted.</v>

3615
02:32:50.371 --> 02:32:51.720
<v Speaker 3>He would lose fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>

3616
02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:54.990
<v Speaker 3>he got choked out by Josh Koscheck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just too tired.</v>

3617
02:32:55.280 --> 02:32:57.300
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait king as well,</v>

3618
02:32:57.301 --> 02:32:57.991
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3619
02:32:57.991 --> 02:33:00.060
<v Speaker 3>there's been certain changes now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even now,</v>

3620
02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:02.220
<v Speaker 3>and I love Max Holloway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3621
02:33:02.410 --> 02:33:03.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3622
02:33:03.430 --> 02:33:04.263
<v Speaker 3>I think it was ufc embedded where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>flew his favorite cupcake's over from </v>

3623
02:33:07.861 --> 02:33:09.720
<v Speaker 3>Hawaii and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3624
02:33:09.721 --> 02:33:10.950
<v Speaker 3>I love cupcakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've made weight.</v>

3625
02:33:10.951 --> 02:33:11.870
<v Speaker 3>And then he was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3626
02:33:12.040 --> 02:33:13.740
<v Speaker 3>nailing cupcakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smart.</v>

3627
02:33:13.840 --> 02:33:14.673
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think there's just that element </v>

3628
02:33:16.230 --> 02:33:20.500
<v Speaker 3>now that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think as much as MMA has,</v>

3629
02:33:20.501 --> 02:33:22.000
<v Speaker 3>has evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3630
02:33:22.001 --> 02:33:22.834
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is someone who doesn't understand </v>

3631
02:33:23.670 --> 02:33:25.920
<v Speaker 3>the technical aspects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as someone who loves,</v>

3632
02:33:26.220 --> 02:33:28.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of sports history,</v>

3633
02:33:28.170 --> 02:33:29.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've watched it and I'm just like,</v>

3634
02:33:29.641 --> 02:33:32.780
<v Speaker 3>that is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's still got so far to get.</v>

3635
02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:34.290
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking earlier about,</v>

3636
02:33:34.291 --> 02:33:36.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>football or soccer isn't in here back in</v>

3637
02:33:36.751 --> 02:33:39.480
<v Speaker 3>England and the warming up of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brandy,</v>

3638
02:33:39.540 --> 02:33:40.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

3639
02:33:40.350 --> 02:33:41.183
<v Speaker 3>in the changing rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think even now it's crazy when you </v>

3640
02:33:44.131 --> 02:33:44.964
<v Speaker 3>have someone so gifted like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they are rehydrating and re carb </v>

3641
02:33:49.351 --> 02:33:51.710
<v Speaker 3>loading on cupcakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3642
02:33:51.790 --> 02:33:52.940
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3643
02:33:53.310 --> 02:33:54.143
<v Speaker 3>there are better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's way better ways you've caught </v>

3644
02:33:56.551 --> 02:33:57.384
<v Speaker 3>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body is basically in fight or </v>

3645
02:33:58.861 --> 02:33:59.750
<v Speaker 3>flight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3646
02:33:59.910 --> 02:34:02.590
<v Speaker 3>you've subjected it to a form of micro </v>
<v Speaker 3>trauma,</v>

3647
02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:04.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bodies kind of sitting there going,</v>

3648
02:34:04.350 --> 02:34:06.870
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going on and um,</v>

3649
02:34:07.080 --> 02:34:09.220
<v Speaker 3>then you're going to get Hago he loves a</v>
<v Speaker 3>cupcake.</v>

3650
02:34:09.221 --> 02:34:10.860
<v Speaker 3>She made weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3651
02:34:10.861 --> 02:34:11.694
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I find that really interesting that </v>

3652
02:34:14.221 --> 02:34:15.670
<v Speaker 3>you see some of the guys who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3653
02:34:15.690 --> 02:34:17.830
<v Speaker 3>was it [inaudible] tobacco?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it,</v>

3654
02:34:17.831 --> 02:34:18.100
<v Speaker 3>who</v>

3655
02:34:18.100 --> 02:34:20.260
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so big.</v>

3656
02:34:20.350 --> 02:34:21.430
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got into,</v>

3657
02:34:21.450 --> 02:34:22.283
<v Speaker 2>it was like he said that he'd weigh in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it would be like he sent his </v>

3658
02:34:24.251 --> 02:34:26.980
<v Speaker 2>older brother in like they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>unrecognizable.</v>

3659
02:34:27.370 --> 02:34:28.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3660
02:34:28.660 --> 02:34:29.493
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's really interesting </v>

3661
02:34:30.071 --> 02:34:32.770
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that physiological puppetry,</v>

3662
02:34:33.010 --> 02:34:35.560
<v Speaker 2>if you know how to do it intelligently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be so powerful,</v>

3663
02:34:35.561 --> 02:34:37.030
<v Speaker 2>but you do it for the wrong reasons,</v>

3664
02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:39.010
<v Speaker 4>but even if you know how to do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligently,</v>

3665
02:34:39.011 --> 02:34:41.860
<v Speaker 4>there's still a demand that it places on</v>
<v Speaker 4>your organs.</v>

3666
02:34:41.861 --> 02:34:44.590
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's there's consequences,</v>

3667
02:34:44.650 --> 02:34:47.560
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And over time your body resists it.</v>

3668
02:34:47.561 --> 02:34:51.460
<v Speaker 4>And this was the thought behind Max </v>
<v Speaker 4>Holloway's last weight cutting fail,</v>

3669
02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:52.713
<v Speaker 4>is that when he was trying to cut down </v>
<v Speaker 4>on short notice to fight Khabib Namaka </v>

3670
02:34:56.400 --> 02:34:57.233
<v Speaker 4>Madoff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was cutting down only to one 55 and </v>

3671
02:34:59.561 --> 02:35:02.620
<v Speaker 4>he couldn't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they pulled him out of that.</v>

3672
02:35:02.621 --> 02:35:05.860
<v Speaker 4>And then he started suffering some </v>
<v Speaker 4>significant problems when he was getting</v>

3673
02:35:05.861 --> 02:35:06.694
<v Speaker 4>ready for Brian Ortega.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they think that when he was ready </v>

3674
02:35:09.731 --> 02:35:10.564
<v Speaker 4>for getting ready for a Tayga,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was going on was his body was </v>

3675
02:35:13.540 --> 02:35:16.330
<v Speaker 4>reacting to the fact that he was trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to cut weight again.</v>

3676
02:35:16.331 --> 02:35:17.890
<v Speaker 4>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you,</v>

3677
02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:19.800
<v Speaker 4>we just got through this man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3678
02:35:19.810 --> 02:35:22.420
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was like really messed up because</v>

3679
02:35:22.421 --> 02:35:22.720
<v Speaker 4>of it.</v>

3680
02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:23.553
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he had to go through a battery of </v>

3681
02:35:24.821 --> 02:35:27.160
<v Speaker 4>tests before they approved him to fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

3682
02:35:27.190 --> 02:35:28.023
<v Speaker 4>So his body had to like fully fully </v>
<v Speaker 4>recover months off and then get back to </v>

3683
02:35:32.201 --> 02:35:33.820
<v Speaker 4>training and now he's okay again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

3684
02:35:33.970 --> 02:35:35.650
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's changing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean now,</v>

3685
02:35:35.651 --> 02:35:37.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean Frankie Edgar was almost the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fest.</v>

3686
02:35:37.091 --> 02:35:38.720
<v Speaker 4>He would wake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to fight like five pounds.</v>

3687
02:35:38.740 --> 02:35:40.780
<v Speaker 4>He wouldn't even cut weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wouldn't cut any weight.</v>

3688
02:35:40.810 --> 02:35:41.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was his way.</v>

3689
02:35:41.980 --> 02:35:43.270
<v Speaker 4>Well there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what they say,</v>

3690
02:35:43.420 --> 02:35:44.253
<v Speaker 4>Frankie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although was the 155 pound champion and </v>

3691
02:35:46.961 --> 02:35:50.170
<v Speaker 4>now competes at 145 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

3692
02:35:50.290 --> 02:35:55.290
<v Speaker 4>He should be fighting at one 35 and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>one 35 is where he could be at his best.</v>

3693
02:35:56.680 --> 02:35:58.180
<v Speaker 4>That's what everybody says.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3694
02:35:58.240 --> 02:35:59.073
<v Speaker 4>Especially people that know like weight </v>
<v Speaker 4>cutting and they look at what he walks </v>

3695
02:36:01.931 --> 02:36:03.100
<v Speaker 4>around and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3696
02:36:03.101 --> 02:36:07.420
<v Speaker 4>20 pounds from 55 ain't shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know those guys do it all the time.</v>

3697
02:36:07.421 --> 02:36:08.254
<v Speaker 4>Especially you get a guy like a George </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lockhart who really knows how to do it </v>

3698
02:36:11.141 --> 02:36:13.210
<v Speaker 4>and put that weight back on you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3699
02:36:13.211 --> 02:36:15.970
<v Speaker 4>and how to do it correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scientifically,</v>

3700
02:36:16.570 --> 02:36:19.450
<v Speaker 2>it's a big W we're seeing that now </v>
<v Speaker 2>across all sports.</v>

3701
02:36:19.451 --> 02:36:21.400
<v Speaker 2>I think this evolution that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding,</v>

3702
02:36:22.260 --> 02:36:24.420
<v Speaker 2>I skin Carlin aisles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's one of my favorite.</v>

3703
02:36:24.421 --> 02:36:26.770
<v Speaker 2>So he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good American sprinter.</v>

3704
02:36:26.800 --> 02:36:27.940
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

3705
02:36:27.941 --> 02:36:29.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>top 50 you know,</v>

3706
02:36:29.111 --> 02:36:30.490
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was amazing,</v>

3707
02:36:30.860 --> 02:36:32.410
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't quite making it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3708
02:36:32.411 --> 02:36:34.360
<v Speaker 2>he's not a Usain bolt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not adjusting Gatlin.</v>

3709
02:36:34.750 --> 02:36:36.400
<v Speaker 2>So they just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Colin,</v>

3710
02:36:36.401 --> 02:36:37.690
<v Speaker 2>here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a rugby ball.</v>

3711
02:36:37.990 --> 02:36:41.140
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll be on youtube some ways like,</v>

3712
02:36:41.141 --> 02:36:41.974
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you regard as the fastest route </v>

3713
02:36:43.051 --> 02:36:44.500
<v Speaker 2>comply?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just handed him,</v>

3714
02:36:44.710 --> 02:36:47.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now there's one of my favorite clips</v>

3715
02:36:47.501 --> 02:36:48.334
<v Speaker 2>because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was one of his first games or </v>

3716
02:36:49.481 --> 02:36:50.314
<v Speaker 2>something and I think it was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australian commentator and he just ran </v>

3717
02:36:53.411 --> 02:36:57.760
<v Speaker 2>like rings around everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scott as score to try.</v>

3718
02:36:57.761 --> 02:36:59.040
<v Speaker 2>And then the commentator was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

3719
02:36:59.150 --> 02:36:59.831
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes,</v>

3720
02:36:59.831 --> 02:37:01.930
<v Speaker 2>I cannot believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you believe?</v>

3721
02:37:02.140 --> 02:37:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Here we go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3722
02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:04.570
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the ball.</v>

3723
02:37:04.720 --> 02:37:05.890
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look at him.</v>

3724
02:37:05.891 --> 02:37:08.650
<v Speaker 7>Go Goodbye.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That is insane.</v>

3725
02:37:08.850 --> 02:37:12.430
<v Speaker 7>This is rugby sevens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh my God,</v>

3726
02:37:12.431 --> 02:37:13.360
<v Speaker 7>they're all quitting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But like,</v>

3727
02:37:14.680 --> 02:37:16.040
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the guy chasing gave</v>

3728
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:17.330
<v Speaker 3>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's more,</v>

3729
02:37:17.331 --> 02:37:18.830
<v Speaker 3>this is absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love corners.</v>

3730
02:37:18.840 --> 02:37:19.673
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he ran past him like the guy was </v>

3731
02:37:21.681 --> 02:37:23.080
<v Speaker 3>ahead of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This new law,</v>

3732
02:37:23.150 --> 02:37:25.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even going to sites that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't,</v>

3733
02:37:25.730 --> 02:37:26.563
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like he doesn't even respect their </v>

3734
02:37:28.011 --> 02:37:28.844
<v Speaker 3>speed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look how much faster he is in those </v>

3735
02:37:30.591 --> 02:37:32.240
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

3736
02:37:32.700 --> 02:37:35.390
<v Speaker 3>Was that all in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3737
02:37:35.391 --> 02:37:39.410
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it like that other guy who broke </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world record by rowing and he'd been</v>

3738
02:37:39.411 --> 02:37:40.244
<v Speaker 3>doing something else and gotten so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>power and energy in his body that he </v>

3739
02:37:45.471 --> 02:37:47.570
<v Speaker 3>could translate that to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to rowing.</v>

3740
02:37:47.600 --> 02:37:48.980
<v Speaker 3>And we're seeing that now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3741
02:37:48.981 --> 02:37:51.240
<v Speaker 3>and that was what was amazing there with</v>
<v Speaker 3>we call him.</v>

3742
02:37:51.260 --> 02:37:51.651
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

3743
02:37:51.651 --> 02:37:52.850
<v Speaker 3>he scored her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got to try.</v>

3744
02:37:52.851 --> 02:37:53.684
<v Speaker 3>And then the commentator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was two commentators talking and </v>

3745
02:37:54.741 --> 02:37:55.574
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe he's only been playing </v>

3746
02:37:56.510 --> 02:37:58.640
<v Speaker 3>in a number of months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that they were like,</v>

3747
02:37:58.641 --> 02:37:58.941
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3748
02:37:58.941 --> 02:37:59.600
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>

3749
02:37:59.600 --> 02:38:01.460
<v Speaker 3>And then the other commentary you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3750
02:38:01.461 --> 02:38:01.731
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3751
02:38:01.731 --> 02:38:02.564
<v Speaker 3>I can believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just tried to give the referee the </v>

3752
02:38:03.681 --> 02:38:04.514
<v Speaker 3>ball and he didn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd scored a try and he was walking </v>

3753
02:38:08.031 --> 02:38:09.610
<v Speaker 3>around and he gave it to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3754
02:38:09.620 --> 02:38:09.860
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3755
02:38:09.860 --> 02:38:10.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kick it.</v>

3756
02:38:10.791 --> 02:38:12.890
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was amazing.</v>

3757
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:14.300
<v Speaker 3>They didn't bother teaching them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

3758
02:38:14.301 --> 02:38:15.770
<v Speaker 3>just listen man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just run.</v>

3759
02:38:16.380 --> 02:38:17.213
<v Speaker 3>But what do I do when I get to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just get to the end and then we'll </v>

3760
02:38:18.861 --> 02:38:21.830
<v Speaker 3>talk and I'll tell you what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll take about three minutes.</v>

3761
02:38:22.970 --> 02:38:24.250
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do.</v>

3762
02:38:24.260 --> 02:38:28.040
<v Speaker 3>And you just run baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're seeing it.</v>

3763
02:38:28.041 --> 02:38:30.620
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You spoke about this not too long ago,</v>

3764
02:38:30.621 --> 02:38:31.454
<v Speaker 3>but I think you might've mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lebron James saying if someone like </v>

3765
02:38:33.411 --> 02:38:34.580
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was taught mma.</v>

3766
02:38:34.610 --> 02:38:36.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody would be dead.</v>

3767
02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:36.913
<v Speaker 3>What would happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think we're seeing that now that </v>

3768
02:38:39.350 --> 02:38:41.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sports now there's more money,</v>

3769
02:38:41.481 --> 02:38:42.314
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in mma and it's evolved to what it is </v>

3770
02:38:44.001 --> 02:38:45.530
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing that if you get,</v>

3771
02:38:45.710 --> 02:38:48.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some unbelievable phenom as a kid,</v>

3772
02:38:48.651 --> 02:38:50.540
<v Speaker 3>you go go into mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3773
02:38:50.541 --> 02:38:51.410
<v Speaker 3>But it's not as</v>

3774
02:38:51.710 --> 02:38:55.600
<v Speaker 5>peeler is basketball and it doesn't pay </v>
<v Speaker 5>as much money as Lebron James makes.</v>

3775
02:38:56.140 --> 02:38:57.280
<v Speaker 5>Lebron James,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does he make?</v>

3776
02:38:57.400 --> 02:39:00.850
<v Speaker 5>$100 million a year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something crazy just from basketball.</v>

3777
02:39:00.851 --> 02:39:04.390
<v Speaker 5>It's like 35 or so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>35 million just from basketball.</v>

3778
02:39:05.190 --> 02:39:08.450
<v Speaker 5>And then sponsorships,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like unless you're conor Mcgregor,</v>

3779
02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:09.313
<v Speaker 5>floyd mayweather,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not gonna make that much money </v>

3780
02:39:10.391 --> 02:39:11.224
<v Speaker 5>from fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can make that much money from </v>

3781
02:39:12.641 --> 02:39:14.170
<v Speaker 5>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're so rare.</v>

3782
02:39:14.710 --> 02:39:15.543
<v Speaker 5>And then connor could only make that </v>
<v Speaker 5>much money from fighting if he box </v>

3783
02:39:18.131 --> 02:39:21.760
<v Speaker 5>floyd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like even though the fight with Kobi was</v>

3784
02:39:21.761 --> 02:39:24.940
<v Speaker 5>the number one mma paper view of all </v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

3785
02:39:24.941 --> 02:39:25.774
<v Speaker 5>the number two paper view in the history</v>
<v Speaker 5>of paper views just behind a floyd </v>

3786
02:39:29.801 --> 02:39:33.400
<v Speaker 5>mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3787
02:39:33.430 --> 02:39:37.510
<v Speaker 5>It got more paper view bys then floyd </v>
<v Speaker 5>mayweather versus conor Mcgregor,</v>

3788
02:39:37.540 --> 02:39:40.150
<v Speaker 5>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe that's true.</v>

3789
02:39:40.450 --> 02:39:41.650
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look that up.</v>

3790
02:39:42.100 --> 02:39:42.933
<v Speaker 5>I think it was 2.2</v>
<v Speaker 5>million for floyd mayweather versus </v>

3791
02:39:45.970 --> 02:39:46.803
<v Speaker 5>conor Mcgregor and then 2.4</v>
<v Speaker 5>million for floyd mayweather versus </v>

3792
02:39:51.191 --> 02:39:54.280
<v Speaker 5>Khabib neurohacker grumet off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was number two of all time.</v>

3793
02:39:54.300 --> 02:39:55.133
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just behind the floyd mayweather or </v>

3794
02:39:56.621 --> 02:39:58.540
<v Speaker 5>manny Pacquiao fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is just incredible.</v>

3795
02:39:58.900 --> 02:40:02.050
<v Speaker 5>So they must've made a shit ton of money</v>
<v Speaker 5>from that.</v>

3796
02:40:02.200 --> 02:40:05.650
<v Speaker 5>But how many times can connor do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't,</v>

3797
02:40:05.790 --> 02:40:06.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean look,</v>

3798
02:40:06.791 --> 02:40:07.624
<v Speaker 5>the Irish support him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people thought he had a chance of </v>

3799
02:40:09.761 --> 02:40:12.610
<v Speaker 5>winning that fight and then once he gets</v>
<v Speaker 5>smashed like that,</v>

3800
02:40:13.350 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they're</v>

3801
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:14.813
<v Speaker 2>going to think he has a chance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>winning again unless he does something </v>

3802
02:40:16.920 --> 02:40:18.360
<v Speaker 2>significant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3803
02:40:18.510 --> 02:40:19.440
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3804
02:40:19.470 --> 02:40:23.640
<v Speaker 2>He has to beat somebody like he has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight like Kevin Lee and fuck him up.</v>

3805
02:40:24.180 --> 02:40:26.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you fought Kevin Lee or Tony Ferguson</v>

3806
02:40:26.401 --> 02:40:29.130
<v Speaker 2>and fucked him up and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said look,</v>

3807
02:40:29.131 --> 02:40:31.380
<v Speaker 2>I had two years off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't ready for could be,</v>

3808
02:40:31.381 --> 02:40:32.214
<v Speaker 2>but I'm ready now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck the mayweathers and he said </v>

3809
02:40:33.941 --> 02:40:35.880
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

3810
02:40:36.090 --> 02:40:37.680
<v Speaker 2>he's got to have some success though.</v>

3811
02:40:38.690 --> 02:40:41.240
<v Speaker 8>Floyd Connor was 6.7</v>
<v Speaker 8>million.</v>

3812
02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:42.343
<v Speaker 8>Floyd manny was 4.4</v>
<v Speaker 8>million and then it would have been </v>

3813
02:40:45.171 --> 02:40:47.450
<v Speaker 8>right around the next one,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which has been Oscar and floyd,</v>

3814
02:40:47.451 --> 02:40:49.850
<v Speaker 8>which is 2.4</v>
<v Speaker 8>so he has to say 2.5</v>

3815
02:40:49.851 --> 02:40:51.180
<v Speaker 8>2.4</v>
<v Speaker 8>so I've been right around number.</v>

3816
02:40:51.181 --> 02:40:53.630
<v Speaker 8>So it was number three then number three</v>
<v Speaker 8>overall,</v>

3817
02:40:53.631 --> 02:40:54.830
<v Speaker 8>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 8>mma,</v>

3818
02:40:54.960 --> 02:40:55.793
<v Speaker 2>number one mma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But number three overall it could be </v>

3819
02:40:57.331 --> 02:40:58.164
<v Speaker 2>tied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what would the one of the boxing </v>

3820
02:40:59.071 --> 02:40:59.570
<v Speaker 2>numbers again,</v>

3821
02:40:59.570 --> 02:41:00.710
<v Speaker 8>what was it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>6.7</v>

3822
02:41:00.711 --> 02:41:02.660
<v Speaker 8>for the floyd conner,</v>
<v Speaker 8>4.4</v>

3823
02:41:02.810 --> 02:41:04.100
<v Speaker 8>for floyd.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Manny.</v>

3824
02:41:04.190 --> 02:41:05.360
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is so crazy.</v>

3825
02:41:05.361 --> 02:41:08.090
<v Speaker 2>6.7</v>
<v Speaker 2>for floyd connor wide.</v>

3826
02:41:08.091 --> 02:41:08.924
<v Speaker 2>My numbers off big time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the amount of money that that will </v>

3827
02:41:13.430 --> 02:41:16.490
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so interesting that you know,</v>

3828
02:41:16.491 --> 02:41:19.520
<v Speaker 2>with that phone around this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>extrinsic motivation,</v>

3829
02:41:19.521 --> 02:41:23.360
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>media fame versus intrinsic motivation.</v>

3830
02:41:23.361 --> 02:41:23.991
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in a,</v>

3831
02:41:23.991 --> 02:41:26.970
<v Speaker 2>in a strange way with the swim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3832
02:41:27.170 --> 02:41:29.270
<v Speaker 2>when we got around John Groups at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top,</v>

3833
02:41:29.271 --> 02:41:30.260
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone was like,</v>

3834
02:41:30.350 --> 02:41:30.751
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3835
02:41:30.751 --> 02:41:32.960
<v Speaker 2>you just set the land's end to John </v>
<v Speaker 2>O'groats record,</v>

3836
02:41:32.961 --> 02:41:34.040
<v Speaker 2>well done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those cameras.</v>

3837
02:41:34.041 --> 02:41:34.874
<v Speaker 2>And it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I was just swimming across the </v>

3838
02:41:36.441 --> 02:41:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Murray firth getting hit by jellyfish </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

3839
02:41:38.331 --> 02:41:39.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six degree water.</v>

3840
02:41:39.570 --> 02:41:40.580
<v Speaker 2>It was just horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3841
02:41:40.581 --> 02:41:41.414
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>

3842
02:41:41.960 --> 02:41:46.220
<v Speaker 2>I think right now as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Khabib fascinates me that,</v>

3843
02:41:46.850 --> 02:41:48.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know the logistics again,</v>

3844
02:41:48.681 --> 02:41:49.514
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been at sea so I'm still trying to </v>

3845
02:41:50.541 --> 02:41:52.370
<v Speaker 2>catch up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was offered so much money for the</v>

3846
02:41:52.371 --> 02:41:55.070
<v Speaker 2>rematch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I believe he turned it down.</v>

3847
02:41:55.170 --> 02:41:59.600
<v Speaker 2>It could be no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was talk of a rematch,</v>

3848
02:41:59.601 --> 02:42:02.650
<v Speaker 2>but the UFC did not offer him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3849
02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:05.060
<v Speaker 2>Financial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of those rumors,</v>

3850
02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:06.073
<v Speaker 2>they hadn't even talked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to figure out what to </v>

3851
02:42:07.611 --> 02:42:08.444
<v Speaker 2>do next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact the UFC said that most </v>

3852
02:42:10.191 --> 02:42:12.260
<v Speaker 2>likely next was Tony Ferguson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3853
02:42:12.410 --> 02:42:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

3854
02:42:13.251 --> 02:42:14.084
<v Speaker 2>that's the current,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last time they talked about someone </v>

3855
02:42:16.671 --> 02:42:19.760
<v Speaker 2>fighting for the title again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a while ago now again,</v>

3856
02:42:19.820 --> 02:42:22.400
<v Speaker 2>it might be UFC embedded when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it was when,</v>

3857
02:42:22.401 --> 02:42:25.970
<v Speaker 2>could be years ago now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>met George Saint Pierre and could be,</v>

3858
02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:26.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

3859
02:42:26.790 --> 02:42:30.170
<v Speaker 2>oh I'd lovely to meet you and then just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it could be with smiling and he</v>

3860
02:42:30.171 --> 02:42:31.004
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3861
02:42:31.250 --> 02:42:33.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad has always said that he'd love to</v>

3862
02:42:33.081 --> 02:42:33.914
<v Speaker 2>see me fight George St Pierre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me that was really interesting </v>

3863
02:42:36.291 --> 02:42:37.124
<v Speaker 2>because it could be some motivation </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to be intrinsic and putting his </v>

3864
02:42:42.351 --> 02:42:43.760
<v Speaker 2>skills against the best people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

3865
02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:45.230
<v Speaker 2>You could offer more than money in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

3866
02:42:45.410 --> 02:42:47.840
<v Speaker 2>but he just wants to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he talks about his dad,</v>

3867
02:42:47.841 --> 02:42:50.420
<v Speaker 2>his family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a different beast.</v>

3868
02:42:50.660 --> 02:42:52.850
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I find really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

3869
02:42:52.880 --> 02:42:53.960
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3870
02:42:53.961 --> 02:42:54.794
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not saying different as in </v>

3871
02:42:56.121 --> 02:42:56.931
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worse,</v>

3872
02:42:56.931 --> 02:42:57.764
<v Speaker 2>good or bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because ultimately mayweather's never </v>

3873
02:42:59.391 --> 02:43:00.224
<v Speaker 2>lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you see someone like </v>

3874
02:43:00.681 --> 02:43:02.150
<v Speaker 2>mayweather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think easy,</v>

3875
02:43:02.180 --> 02:43:04.740
<v Speaker 2>just an extrinsically motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he's saying it,</v>

3876
02:43:04.741 --> 02:43:06.380
<v Speaker 2>if it doesn't make money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't make sense.</v>

3877
02:43:06.620 --> 02:43:08.150
<v Speaker 2>You kind of look at him going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3878
02:43:09.020 --> 02:43:11.410
<v Speaker 2>you're extrinsically motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arguably.</v>

3879
02:43:11.411 --> 02:43:12.040
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've</v>

3880
02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:13.420
<v Speaker 4>never met the guy and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you,</v>

3881
02:43:13.421 --> 02:43:14.254
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're extrinsic motivator but you'd </v>

3882
02:43:15.251 --> 02:43:17.620
<v Speaker 4>never lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So which one's more powerful?</v>

3883
02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:20.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he's completely </v>
<v Speaker 4>extrinsically motivated.</v>

3884
02:43:20.921 --> 02:43:24.400
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a lot of it is an act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think he's too good,</v>

3885
02:43:25.150 --> 02:43:25.983
<v Speaker 4>too good?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

3886
02:43:26.050 --> 02:43:26.411
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

3887
02:43:26.411 --> 02:43:27.244
<v Speaker 4>there has to be some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some deep emotional connection to his </v>

3888
02:43:30.851 --> 02:43:31.684
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's gotta be some connection to his </v>

3889
02:43:33.341 --> 02:43:34.174
<v Speaker 4>legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What he's been able to do the way he's </v>

3890
02:43:35.861 --> 02:43:39.370
<v Speaker 4>been able to retire undefeated as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>professional boxer,</v>

3891
02:43:39.371 --> 02:43:41.020
<v Speaker 4>which is almost unheard of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3892
02:43:41.080 --> 02:43:43.920
<v Speaker 4>Cause I want to believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I hope that's true because,</v>

3893
02:43:43.930 --> 02:43:44.763
<v Speaker 4>because you're almost taught like </v>
<v Speaker 4>intrinsic motivation did it for the </v>

3894
02:43:47.051 --> 02:43:47.920
<v Speaker 4>love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3895
02:43:47.921 --> 02:43:51.370
<v Speaker 4>in sort of unit the sweet science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to believe that may wave is there</v>

3896
02:43:51.371 --> 02:43:53.320
<v Speaker 4>and he's studying it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it may be,</v>

3897
02:43:53.321 --> 02:43:54.940
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't want you to see that side.</v>

3898
02:43:55.350 --> 02:43:56.800
<v Speaker 4>He's too good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3899
02:43:57.160 --> 02:43:59.980
<v Speaker 4>He's too good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's kind of have a love of boxing.</v>

3900
02:44:00.010 --> 02:44:05.010
<v Speaker 4>There's no way he's too good the way he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's artistically taking guys apart.</v>

3901
02:44:05.411 --> 02:44:09.520
<v Speaker 4>Like you go to the Canelo Alvarez fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way he was like it was slipping away</v>

3902
02:44:09.521 --> 02:44:13.060
<v Speaker 4>from Canelo was big shots and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>popping them with the jabs like pitch.</v>

3903
02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:14.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Today.</v>

3904
02:44:15.010 --> 02:44:17.530
<v Speaker 4>Not Today man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good enough for this.</v>

3905
02:44:17.820 --> 02:44:18.653
<v Speaker 4>And it was intelligent in his approach </v>
<v Speaker 4>to that fight too cause he made canelo </v>

3906
02:44:21.381 --> 02:44:24.640
<v Speaker 4>drain himself to get down to 150 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

3907
02:44:24.641 --> 02:44:25.474
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a different thing cause he </v>

3908
02:44:26.590 --> 02:44:30.790
<v Speaker 4>forced Canelo to cut a lot of weight to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get down to his weight class.</v>

3909
02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:32.193
<v Speaker 4>But it'd been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>floyd really realistically is 147 pound </v>

3910
02:44:34.391 --> 02:44:35.224
<v Speaker 4>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's only fighting in these </v>

3911
02:44:35.951 --> 02:44:37.690
<v Speaker 4>higher weight classes cause the money's </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

3912
02:44:38.280 --> 02:44:40.510
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking wizard man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a wizard.</v>

3913
02:44:40.511 --> 02:44:42.850
<v Speaker 4>But that's what I mean about like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that will start,</v>

3914
02:44:43.210 --> 02:44:45.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's playing with everybody's head.</v>

3915
02:44:45.280 --> 02:44:47.290
<v Speaker 4>You talk about like psychological </v>
<v Speaker 4>warfare,</v>

3916
02:44:47.291 --> 02:44:49.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the art of war and everything like that.</v>

3917
02:44:49.270 --> 02:44:53.590
<v Speaker 4>And he's doing it on a mass scale like </v>
<v Speaker 4>we've probably never experienced before.</v>

3918
02:44:53.620 --> 02:44:54.453
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was fascinating was connor was </v>

3919
02:44:55.241 --> 02:44:58.240
<v Speaker 4>doing it to him and was screaming in his</v>
<v Speaker 4>face with a hard on,</v>

3920
02:44:58.241 --> 02:44:59.630
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the way in.</v>

3921
02:44:59.640 --> 02:45:01.370
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know how he generated a </v>
<v Speaker 4>harder one,</v>

3922
02:45:02.020 --> 02:45:03.280
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3923
02:45:03.281 --> 02:45:05.410
<v Speaker 4>he must have played with his deck before</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got out there.</v>

3924
02:45:05.700 --> 02:45:06.533
<v Speaker 4>It took some Viagra or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really think that might've been part </v>

3925
02:45:08.861 --> 02:45:13.000
<v Speaker 4>of the psychological motivations that </v>
<v Speaker 4>just screaming in his face,</v>

3926
02:45:13.001 --> 02:45:15.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna fucking kill you a little puke</v>
<v Speaker 4>you piece of shit.</v>

3927
02:45:15.970 --> 02:45:19.290
<v Speaker 4>And flow is just like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just dead face staring at them.</v>

3928
02:45:19.320 --> 02:45:20.153
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't scream back dead face stayed </v>

3929
02:45:21.611 --> 02:45:26.611
<v Speaker 4>comms like tomorrow I am going to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>you up and there ain't no god damn thing</v>

3930
02:45:26.771 --> 02:45:27.230
<v Speaker 4>in the world.</v>

3931
02:45:27.230 --> 02:45:28.510
<v Speaker 4>It's going to change there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

3932
02:45:28.540 --> 02:45:29.373
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well Connor was like the first guy that </v>

3933
02:45:30.821 --> 02:45:34.090
<v Speaker 4>floyd ever fought that could fuck him up</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a real fight though.</v>

3934
02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:34.840
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the,</v>

3935
02:45:34.840 --> 02:45:35.673
<v Speaker 4>there was a different element of danger </v>
<v Speaker 4>there because there was an agreed upon </v>

3936
02:45:38.621 --> 02:45:41.050
<v Speaker 4>rule set where connor wasn't going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>kick,</v>

3937
02:45:41.051 --> 02:45:42.910
<v Speaker 4>wasn't going to take them down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's going to strangle them.</v>

3938
02:45:43.210 --> 02:45:46.210
<v Speaker 4>So because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>floyd knew he could win,</v>

3939
02:45:46.630 --> 02:45:51.550
<v Speaker 4>but he also knew without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they were just going to fight,</v>

3940
02:45:51.551 --> 02:45:53.770
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there was no gloves,</v>

3941
02:45:53.880 --> 02:45:56.590
<v Speaker 4>if they just put the gloves aside and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just had a street fight,</v>

3942
02:45:56.920 --> 02:46:01.920
<v Speaker 4>connor would fucking kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's not a question on my mind</v>

3943
02:46:03.100 --> 02:46:06.160
<v Speaker 4>is not that not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not a doubt to be had.</v>

3944
02:46:06.550 --> 02:46:10.100
<v Speaker 4>Connor would kick him from a distance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would probe him with</v>

3945
02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:11.750
<v Speaker 5>front kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kick his legs,</v>

3946
02:46:12.410 --> 02:46:15.180
<v Speaker 5>floyd would start to limp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Connor would step in,</v>

3947
02:46:15.290 --> 02:46:17.210
<v Speaker 5>tie him up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>elbow him,</v>

3948
02:46:17.211 --> 02:46:20.030
<v Speaker 5>take him down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>smash his face into a bloody pulp,</v>

3949
02:46:20.031 --> 02:46:22.310
<v Speaker 5>do whatever you want it to him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>strangle him,</v>

3950
02:46:22.490 --> 02:46:25.910
<v Speaker 5>rip his knees apart with leg locks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can do whatever he want it to them.</v>

3951
02:46:26.120 --> 02:46:27.680
<v Speaker 5>If they were going to just fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fight,</v>

3952
02:46:28.310 --> 02:46:30.050
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he said that to him and he's like,</v>

3953
02:46:30.051 --> 02:46:34.010
<v Speaker 5>if this was a fight at fucking kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just looked right at him.</v>

3954
02:46:34.011 --> 02:46:36.380
<v Speaker 5>And he's saying that to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Floyd had to just eat it,</v>

3955
02:46:36.890 --> 02:46:38.360
<v Speaker 5>but it didn't matter because it wasn't a</v>
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>

3956
02:46:38.361 --> 02:46:40.250
<v Speaker 5>It was a boxing match and he didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 5>a chance.</v>

3957
02:46:40.470 --> 02:46:42.630
<v Speaker 2>But do you think that worked with Aldo </v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance?</v>

3958
02:46:42.631 --> 02:46:43.890
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

3959
02:46:43.920 --> 02:46:45.710
<v Speaker 2>this is me kind of just talking more on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3960
02:46:45.711 --> 02:46:49.410
<v Speaker 2>the mental warfare side and not really </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding the technical aspect.</v>

3961
02:46:49.710 --> 02:46:54.640
<v Speaker 2>But that world tour was fascinating to </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch and the whole way round.</v>

3962
02:46:54.641 --> 02:46:55.474
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

3963
02:46:55.560 --> 02:46:56.393
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is me not understanding all that </v>

3964
02:46:58.081 --> 02:47:00.660
<v Speaker 2>much about him and maybe being </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinated with a mental aspect that,</v>

3965
02:47:00.950 --> 02:47:01.621
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

3966
02:47:01.621 --> 02:47:03.450
<v Speaker 2>George Saint Pierre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he fought Nick Diaz and,</v>

3967
02:47:03.451 --> 02:47:04.260
<v Speaker 2>and they were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3968
02:47:04.260 --> 02:47:06.510
<v Speaker 2>we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to talk to you and he's going</v>

3969
02:47:06.511 --> 02:47:08.130
<v Speaker 2>to talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to walk you down.</v>

3970
02:47:08.580 --> 02:47:09.870
<v Speaker 2>Don't be effected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And George St Pierre,</v>

3971
02:47:09.871 --> 02:47:10.591
<v Speaker 2>was that across?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3972
02:47:10.591 --> 02:47:11.424
<v Speaker 2>I won't be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he was talking so much that I </v>

3973
02:47:13.380 --> 02:47:14.213
<v Speaker 2>even said it just invoked again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually going back to what we were </v>

3974
02:47:16.471 --> 02:47:17.510
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3975
02:47:17.520 --> 02:47:18.353
<v Speaker 2>our bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much as we like to think about it as </v>

3976
02:47:19.621 --> 02:47:23.910
<v Speaker 2>black and white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the complex biochemical organisms.</v>

3977
02:47:24.030 --> 02:47:26.130
<v Speaker 2>So when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying that,</v>

3978
02:47:26.131 --> 02:47:28.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Diaz brothers necessarily think like</v>

3979
02:47:28.291 --> 02:47:28.640
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

3980
02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:31.510
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to talk to you and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to mess with your mechanic.</v>

3981
02:47:31.540 --> 02:47:32.373
<v Speaker 2>Do you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chemical reactions within your body </v>

3982
02:47:34.051 --> 02:47:36.690
<v Speaker 2>neurotransmitters and making you fought</v>

3983
02:47:37.080 --> 02:47:38.750
<v Speaker 5>the mind?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck you.</v>

3984
02:47:39.380 --> 02:47:40.550
<v Speaker 5>They're doing it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're dumb.</v>

3985
02:47:40.610 --> 02:47:43.060
<v Speaker 5>They're not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When Nick's doing that too,</v>

3986
02:47:43.070 --> 02:47:43.940
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what bitch?</v>

3987
02:47:43.970 --> 02:47:46.010
<v Speaker 5>Which going to a bitch?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's fucking with your head,</v>

3988
02:47:46.011 --> 02:47:48.440
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember the first time he did that to</v>

3989
02:47:48.441 --> 02:47:49.274
<v Speaker 5>Robbie lawler.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Robbie was like 2021 years old and nick </v>

3990
02:47:51.681 --> 02:47:53.630
<v Speaker 5>was young too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're both standing to the,</v>

3991
02:47:53.870 --> 02:47:57.740
<v Speaker 5>they moved into the cage and they closed</v>
<v Speaker 5>it and nick has just started saying,</v>

3992
02:47:57.741 --> 02:48:00.320
<v Speaker 5>stockton motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stoughton bribee Laura was like,</v>

3993
02:48:00.321 --> 02:48:02.600
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's like standing in front of them.</v>

3994
02:48:02.810 --> 02:48:03.643
<v Speaker 5>That's against Carlos condit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He drops the best one was against </v>

3995
02:48:06.291 --> 02:48:07.124
<v Speaker 5>Anderson Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He fell to the ground and pretended he </v>

3996
02:48:09.291 --> 02:48:10.124
<v Speaker 5>was sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He put his hands together like he's </v>

3997
02:48:11.600 --> 02:48:15.230
<v Speaker 5>taking a nap and laid down and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>couldn't stop laughing.</v>

3998
02:48:15.231 --> 02:48:17.600
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this mother fucker is so crazy.</v>

3999
02:48:18.170 --> 02:48:21.680
<v Speaker 5>He just like right there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>drop down instead of relaxing,</v>

4000
02:48:21.681 --> 02:48:24.290
<v Speaker 5>go to the back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go back.</v>

4001
02:48:24.320 --> 02:48:25.400
<v Speaker 5>That one's better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4002
02:48:25.570 --> 02:48:29.870
<v Speaker 5>So when you see him lay down and leaned </v>
<v Speaker 5>on his head like,</v>

4003
02:48:29.880 --> 02:48:32.390
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to take a nap here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what are you doing bitch?</v>

4004
02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:35.360
<v Speaker 5>Anderson Silva did forrest Griffin and </v>
<v Speaker 5>has done all his career,</v>

4005
02:48:35.390 --> 02:48:40.390
<v Speaker 5>but he's doing this to a guy who's the </v>
<v Speaker 5>187 85 pound rather best ever.</v>

4006
02:48:41.831 --> 02:48:44.780
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's not even 185 pounder.</v>

4007
02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:47.540
<v Speaker 5>He's really a one 55 pounder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4008
02:48:47.541 --> 02:48:48.374
<v Speaker 5>Nick Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he was a champion in strike force </v>

4009
02:48:50.210 --> 02:48:52.190
<v Speaker 5>or lead xc lead XC,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

4010
02:48:52.490 --> 02:48:54.980
<v Speaker 5>He was a 155 pound champion.</v>

4011
02:48:55.300 --> 02:48:56.133
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's amazing here is everything that </v>

4012
02:48:57.111 --> 02:48:59.480
<v Speaker 2>we talked about in terms of intangibles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>

4013
02:48:59.481 --> 02:49:03.320
<v Speaker 2>body connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nick is imposing his mind,</v>

4014
02:49:03.321 --> 02:49:05.390
<v Speaker 2>body connection on Anderson in that he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to,</v>

4015
02:49:05.391 --> 02:49:07.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to mess with y'all fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>with head for sure.</v>

4016
02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:08.170
<v Speaker 2>What</v>

4017
02:49:08.170 --> 02:49:09.450
<v Speaker 4>will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was he the champ?</v>

4018
02:49:09.451 --> 02:49:10.284
<v Speaker 4>Why am I not remembering it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it elite Xc or strike force that </v>

4019
02:49:13.081 --> 02:49:16.200
<v Speaker 4>Nick Diaz was the champion of?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might've been strike force.</v>

4020
02:49:17.180 --> 02:49:18.013
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4021
02:49:18.060 --> 02:49:19.500
<v Speaker 4>Why can't I remember?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

4022
02:49:19.980 --> 02:49:20.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

4023
02:49:20.940 --> 02:49:22.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why did I think a leader Xc,</v>

4024
02:49:22.310 --> 02:49:23.760
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4025
02:49:23.940 --> 02:49:25.680
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll use the fought elite xc.</v>

4026
02:49:25.681 --> 02:49:26.970
<v Speaker 4>Did he?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4027
02:49:27.060 --> 02:49:29.250
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I remember because,</v>

4028
02:49:30.460 --> 02:49:31.010
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

4029
02:49:31.010 --> 02:49:34.610
<v Speaker 4>That was because mayhem Miller and uh,</v>

4030
02:49:37.240 --> 02:49:42.240
<v Speaker 4>jake shields had a brawl in elite xc and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nick Diaz was a part of the brawl.</v>

4031
02:49:44.440 --> 02:49:47.110
<v Speaker 4>They're all piled on each other and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>was chaos.</v>

4032
02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:49.690
<v Speaker 4>But Stripe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was him pull daily,</v>

4033
02:49:50.170 --> 02:49:55.170
<v Speaker 4>that knock out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But also just kind of like fell and,</v>

4034
02:49:55.211 --> 02:49:56.170
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's,</v>

4035
02:49:56.650 --> 02:50:00.310
<v Speaker 4>it's so strange that this intangible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this thing that I'm now fascinated.</v>

4036
02:50:00.311 --> 02:50:02.050
<v Speaker 4>We've liked men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kj noons elite XC.</v>

4037
02:50:02.051 --> 02:50:03.550
<v Speaker 4>So he did fight him in a next,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see?</v>

4038
02:50:03.850 --> 02:50:04.683
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he finally Dixie and then became </v>

4039
02:50:05.891 --> 02:50:07.870
<v Speaker 4>strikeforce champion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I'm confused.</v>

4040
02:50:08.290 --> 02:50:09.123
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4041
02:50:09.570 --> 02:50:13.120
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that whatever mayweather did differently</v>

4042
02:50:13.121 --> 02:50:16.750
<v Speaker 4>to Aldo might have been granted </v>
<v Speaker 4>different sports granted,</v>

4043
02:50:16.751 --> 02:50:19.060
<v Speaker 4>but there was something that mcgregor </v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

4044
02:50:19.061 --> 02:50:21.490
<v Speaker 4>it's not working the way that when he </v>
<v Speaker 4>pinched,</v>

4045
02:50:21.730 --> 02:50:23.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>de has neck and shoulder,</v>

4046
02:50:23.301 --> 02:50:25.330
<v Speaker 4>I turn around and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

4047
02:50:25.331 --> 02:50:27.040
<v Speaker 4>without understanding the technical </v>
<v Speaker 4>element there was,</v>

4048
02:50:27.041 --> 02:50:29.470
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was so fascinating watching the two.</v>

4049
02:50:29.470 --> 02:50:30.303
<v Speaker 4>And like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mayweather stood there completely stoic </v>

4050
02:50:33.570 --> 02:50:38.570
<v Speaker 4>Aldo was not comfortable with it and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>lost his composure and he attacked,</v>

4051
02:50:38.980 --> 02:50:42.460
<v Speaker 4>he attacked connor in a way that exposed</v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

4052
02:50:42.500 --> 02:50:44.530
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got exposed to a counter shot.</v>

4053
02:50:44.560 --> 02:50:46.210
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't patient.</v>

4054
02:50:46.450 --> 02:50:47.283
<v Speaker 4>He was very emotional and he just wanted</v>
<v Speaker 4>to fuck that dude up and he just got </v>

4055
02:50:49.841 --> 02:50:50.710
<v Speaker 4>clipped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

4056
02:50:50.740 --> 02:50:51.311
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4057
02:50:51.311 --> 02:50:52.144
<v Speaker 4>and look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>connor played in perfectly played them </v>

4058
02:50:53.801 --> 02:50:54.880
<v Speaker 4>like a fiddle.</v>
