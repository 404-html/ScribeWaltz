00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.620
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.621 --> 00:00:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Everybody like as far as I'm concerned,</v>

3
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:03.540
<v Speaker 1>like mom,</v>

4
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.830
<v Speaker 1>I got my daily problems.</v>

5
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:04.931
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

6
00:00:04.931 --> 00:00:05.764
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

7
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't the government and the clamp down the internet,</v>

8
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:09.060
<v Speaker 1>fuck the Internet.</v>

9
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.950
<v Speaker 1>I honestly told her,</v>

10
00:00:09.951 --> 00:00:10.561
<v Speaker 1>I've said many,</v>

11
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 1>many times if I could get rid of one thing,</v>

12
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:16.170
<v Speaker 1>like I think for every great thing the Internet's done and there's a thousand</v>

13
00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:16.651
<v Speaker 1>slimy,</v>

14
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:19.500
<v Speaker 1>he's coming fucking awful rotten things about it.</v>

15
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.011
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

16
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:20.731
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

17
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:23.170
<v Speaker 1>I look at it a completely opposite I think for everyone.</v>

18
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean it changed my,</v>

19
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.410
<v Speaker 1>it changed the trajectory of a whole business depended on to,</v>

20
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:28.820
<v Speaker 1>you know what man?</v>

21
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I think Dan took the carpet enabled on delivery on levels that I never would</v>

22
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:38.541
<v Speaker 1>have imagined in like 1995 it thievery meaning people to illegally downloaded</v>

23
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:39.444
<v Speaker 1>songs.</v>

24
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

25
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:40.191
<v Speaker 1>Not only that.</v>

26
00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:40.471
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

27
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>And then let's just go with the,</v>

28
00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:42.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:43.020
<v Speaker 1>just small things like,</v>

30
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:43.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:43.561
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

32
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:43.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:47.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe in the 90s if there was a guy who liked fucking pigs,</v>

34
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

35
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.390
<v Speaker 1>He'd be alone fucking wolf somewhere that,</v>

36
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.130
<v Speaker 1>would never really act on it or anything.</v>

38
00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:53.910
<v Speaker 1>Now there's probably,</v>

39
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.750
<v Speaker 1>you could probably find a website dedicated to that gap.</v>

40
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Speaker 1>This most certainly if people gather and they fuck pigs,</v>

41
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>that's bad.</v>

42
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.520
<v Speaker 1>That's bad for society.</v>

43
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Why is it okay to eat pigs?</v>

45
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>But it's not okay to fuck them.</v>

46
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.950
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to know.</v>

47
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

48
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.030
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you dude podcast might be over after that.</v>

49
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like,</v>

50
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I have any response to that legitimately.</v>

51
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:17.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like that makes any sense.</v>

52
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.891
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

53
00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.720
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

55
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.340
<v Speaker 1>if you will fuck people and we didn't eat and them's wrong,</v>

57
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.081
<v Speaker 1>well site and wrong.</v>

59
00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:29.790
<v Speaker 1>If you trapped car crashed in the Andes mountains and just eating a person,</v>

60
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>well people have done it.</v>

61
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

62
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 1>the whole bond or party,</v>

63
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>those people that got stuck in the Rockies,</v>

64
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.960
<v Speaker 1>people done it.</v>

65
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.750
<v Speaker 1>But it's under notoriously bad story.</v>

66
00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not cool.</v>

67
00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:41.721
<v Speaker 1>They're accepted.</v>

68
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:44.160
<v Speaker 1>It's not like things you should do on a regular basis.</v>

69
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

70
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.540
<v Speaker 1>if someone can,</v>

71
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.901
<v Speaker 1>pigs,</v>

72
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 1>let's just apply the same,</v>

73
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.360
<v Speaker 1>probably the same logic.</v>

74
00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 1>How about you're stuck on an island and there's no people to fuck,</v>

75
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>but you got a pig and they come back after all these years and the,</v>

76
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:54.120
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

77
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

78
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.961
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

79
00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:55.081
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

80
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>I raised pigs and a and I killed them for food.</v>

81
00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.371
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

82
00:01:58.371 --> 00:01:58.651
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

83
00:01:58.651 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

84
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 1>What would you do for sex?</v>

85
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:01.110
<v Speaker 1>He just beat off lot.</v>

86
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

87
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 1>fuck my pigs.</v>

88
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.721
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>

89
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:04.830
<v Speaker 1>whoa and cool.</v>

90
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Not Cool.</v>

91
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.250
<v Speaker 1>He did something.</v>

92
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 1>She just kept that to yourself,</v>

93
00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:08.831
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

94
00:02:08.831 --> 00:02:09.664
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

95
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.040
<v Speaker 1>That's really what it is.</v>

96
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Would it be worse if he made love to the pig?</v>

97
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't think either one is bad.</v>

98
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.131
<v Speaker 1>I think honestly,</v>

99
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to kill an animal,</v>

100
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.900
<v Speaker 1>fucking it,</v>

101
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.240
<v Speaker 1>as long as you don't like fuck it to death.</v>

102
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.870
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a crazy way to kill something and we'd just go anal with the pig</v>

103
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:25.704
<v Speaker 1>or vagina.</v>

104
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>She'd have to see the setup.</v>

105
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.590
<v Speaker 1>You have to see what you deal with,</v>

106
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

107
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.641
<v Speaker 1>condom,</v>

108
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:30.301
<v Speaker 1>no condom.</v>

109
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:31.134
<v Speaker 1>It's about a question.</v>

110
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Internal organ lies.</v>

111
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Pigs are supposed to be very similar to us,</v>

112
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 1>so you don't,</v>

113
00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>you definitely don't want to go aina without a little cleanup.</v>

114
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:37.831
<v Speaker 1>First.</v>

115
00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

116
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>you get some pig shit through the tip of your Dick for sure.</v>

117
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.020
<v Speaker 1>That can be a problem at home clubs.</v>

118
00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

119
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.460
<v Speaker 1>It's nice to have a spot.</v>

120
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.620
<v Speaker 1>So like we're standing.</v>

121
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 1>Hope is out in Bisbee.</v>

122
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:47.580
<v Speaker 1>There's no fucking club.</v>

123
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.800
<v Speaker 1>So that crazy asshole.</v>

124
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Just do a show in his back yard.</v>

125
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.100
<v Speaker 1>Set up some speakers,</v>

126
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.450
<v Speaker 1>plugged the Mike and</v>

127
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.290
<v Speaker 1>he did a show in Vegas and some dude's backyard.</v>

128
00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy in Vegas,</v>

129
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:03.580
<v Speaker 1>some kid who was hiring comedians do shows in his yard and have his friends come</v>

130
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 1>over and uh,</v>

131
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>has to be a great gig.</v>

132
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.110
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

133
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Can you say about it right?</v>

134
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Standup said it was awesome.</v>

135
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.341
<v Speaker 1>Like we got it.</v>

136

<v Speaker 1>Got It got shut down by like city ordinances or something.</v>

137
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

138
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have the proper permits.</v>

139
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.333
<v Speaker 1>Let a bummer.</v>

140
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.830
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is that one with the proper [inaudible].</v>

141
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>Well then you could shut down lemonade stands.</v>

142
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:20.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

143
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.161
<v Speaker 1>so you don't,</v>

144
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:21.994
<v Speaker 1>and you don't have a permit.</v>

145
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

146
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 1>But you don't want anybody throwing like crazy late night parties in the</v>

147
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:27.370
<v Speaker 1>backyard next to you.</v>

148
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.420

<v Speaker 1>I've Seen Pa's do it for 100 bucks.</v>

307
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.730

<v Speaker 1>Can't train for that.</v>

317
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.150
<v Speaker 1>The kidney is insurmountable that you have to control what you can control.</v>

318
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
