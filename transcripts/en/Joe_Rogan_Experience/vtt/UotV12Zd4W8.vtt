00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches like,</v>

2
00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:03.601
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

3
00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:03.781
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4
00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:06.750
<v Speaker 1>you pulled the string back and then you let the Arrow fly.</v>

5
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Pretty straightforward,</v>

6
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.760
<v Speaker 1>like I think that's most people's idea of what archery is,</v>

7
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.090
<v Speaker 1>but then when you really pay attention to the technical aspects of all the</v>

8
00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 1>different stuff that's going on and all the different things you think about and</v>

9
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:25.920
<v Speaker 1>how you literally can not have anything on your mind other than all the</v>

10
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:26.461
<v Speaker 1>technique,</v>

11
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:28.080
<v Speaker 1>involve your foot placement,</v>

12
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:28.891
<v Speaker 1>your technique,</v>

13
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:29.730
<v Speaker 1>and standing,</v>

14
00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:32.460
<v Speaker 1>your breathing where how you're drawing it back,</v>

15
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:33.990
<v Speaker 1>the position of your front shoulder,</v>

16
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>the position of your rear elbow,</v>

17
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>how you're pulling,</v>

18
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:37.240
<v Speaker 1>where it,</v>

19
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.490
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

20
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.860
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

21
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>how do you respond after the arrows released?</v>

22
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.590
<v Speaker 1>There's so much going on that like when you put it all together like it,</v>

23
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.211
<v Speaker 1>it has.</v>

24
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.940
<v Speaker 1>It leaves no room for homework.</v>

25
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.190
<v Speaker 1>There's no room for relationship bullshit.</v>

26
00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:51.450
<v Speaker 1>There's no room for taxes.</v>

27
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.440
<v Speaker 1>There's no room in there.</v>

28
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

29
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 1>If you want to make a nice shot like that,</v>

30
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.710
<v Speaker 1>like I guarantee you,</v>

31
00:00:55.711 --> 00:01:00.690
<v Speaker 1>if we could have a brain scan of your head the second you release that Arrow at</v>

32
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:02.940
<v Speaker 1>a hundred yards to go in that two inch gap,</v>

33
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.140
<v Speaker 1>there would be nothing in there other than what you did.</v>

34
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>There would be no other.</v>

35
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.170
<v Speaker 1>No other cells would be fired up.</v>

36
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.840
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

37
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.171
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

38
00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:11.951
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing.</v>

39
00:01:11.951 --> 00:01:16.420
<v Speaker 2>And actually like yesterday when we were shooting there,</v>

40
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.190
<v Speaker 2>towards the end of the day,</v>

41
00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:21.190
<v Speaker 2>you got to the point where you're almost.</v>

42
00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Your mind was clear.</v>

43
00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:24.160
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like for me,</v>

44
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

45
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.290
<v Speaker 2>your family came home,</v>

46
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.940
<v Speaker 2>like things are winding down.</v>

47
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.780
<v Speaker 2>You knew that like work was over and it was like right before dark.</v>

48
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.531
<v Speaker 2>And like for me,</v>

49
00:01:32.531 --> 00:01:36.850
<v Speaker 2>I love shooting it at first light and it lasts light because it seems like</v>

50
00:01:36.851 --> 00:01:38.470
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm not really worried about.</v>

51
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Someone texting me or calling me.</v>

52
00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:45.361
<v Speaker 2>I'm not worried about problem at home and I shoot with a clear mind and I am way</v>

53
00:01:45.491 --> 00:01:49.480
<v Speaker 2>more efficient in my practice and it is a form of meditation.</v>

54
00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:49.781
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

55
00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:51.370
<v Speaker 2>it's like you said,</v>

56
00:01:51.371 --> 00:01:55.930
<v Speaker 2>it's an art and if you're clouded than you,</v>

57
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.180
<v Speaker 2>it will reflect that on the target.</v>

58
00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:02.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like if your arrows are in one spot,</v>

59
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.640
<v Speaker 2>then you know you have a single focus and it's almost like the more those arrows</v>

60
00:02:06.641 --> 00:02:07.331
<v Speaker 2>are spread,</v>

61
00:02:07.331 --> 00:02:12.331
<v Speaker 2>that's a representation of how many other thoughts and distractions you have</v>

62
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.570
<v Speaker 2>going in your mind.</v>

63
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.811
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

64
00:02:13.811 --> 00:02:16.150
<v Speaker 2>and I look at it that way when I shoot,</v>

65
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to narrow everything down to just a movement and you look at good</v>

66
00:02:21.911 --> 00:02:22.720
<v Speaker 2>golfers,</v>

67
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.190
<v Speaker 2>the ones that swing easy and it just literally looks like flow.</v>

68
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.900
<v Speaker 2>There's such good strikers and there's so much more efficient when you see</v>

69
00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:34.090
<v Speaker 2>people that are trying to be robotic and,</v>

70
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.910
<v Speaker 2>and almost like hack something.</v>

71
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Then it's like too systematic.</v>

72
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.731
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

73
00:02:39.731 --> 00:02:43.030
<v Speaker 2>you see someone like that does professional karate or something.</v>

74
00:02:43.031 --> 00:02:44.740
<v Speaker 2>If they're in a forms competition,</v>

75
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.230
<v Speaker 2>if they're like real rigid going around.</v>

76
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.120
<v Speaker 2>It's just not what it's meant to be.</v>

77
00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:50.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's supposed to be a dance.</v>

78
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.010
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be like literally a mental musical that's planned and if your</v>

79
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.180
<v Speaker 2>mind is clear,</v>

80
00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.043
<v Speaker 2>then it's.</v>

81
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 2>It's a form of meditation.</v>

82
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>

83
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever have male instincts to like buy a girl's neck when you're having sex</v>

84
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:06.350
<v Speaker 2>with her like that?</v>

85
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 2>That kinda seems like you'd be somebody that would be like a neck bite or you'd</v>

86
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 2>be really into it and just do not want you beaten off.</v>

87
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:13.270
<v Speaker 2>Thinking about how I felt,</v>

88
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.210
<v Speaker 2>so I will stop this conversation right here.</v>

89
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

90
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.230
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

91
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 2>It's different with different girls,</v>

92
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.403
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

93
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.121
<v Speaker 2>With different girls.</v>

94
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:22.954
<v Speaker 2>You dated.</v>

95
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 2>Some girls get choked.</v>

96
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 2>They just do.</v>

97
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 2>I hit all that.</v>

98
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 2>When a girl tells me to slap them or choke them,</v>

99
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:29.884
<v Speaker 2>that's the worst.</v>

100
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.873
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it.</v>

101
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to beat you up.</v>

102
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to get that from somebody else.</v>

103
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.790
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to call Ari.</v>

104
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 2>Do you think the daddy thing?</v>

105
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:38.411
<v Speaker 2>There's something there.</v>

106
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:39.250
<v Speaker 2>When girls are like,</v>

107
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:39.971
<v Speaker 2>fuck me harder,</v>

108
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:40.451
<v Speaker 2>Daddy,</v>

109
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:41.590
<v Speaker 2>when it's the whole daddy thing,</v>

110
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 2>do you think there's more to it?</v>

111
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:43.560
<v Speaker 2>It's a dirty,</v>

112
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 2>dirty,</v>

113
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 2>dirty.</v>

114
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 2>They don't mean their dad.</v>

115
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Speaker 2>They mean you.</v>

116
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.960
<v Speaker 2>They want you to be their daddy in that moment.</v>

117
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 2>Not even like a father,</v>

118
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

119
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.490
<v Speaker 2>like the data that's given the Dick,</v>

120
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

121
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 2>they don't even think it's like a different word.</v>

122
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 2>It's a different use of the word Daddy,</v>

123
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.820
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

124
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean the same thing.</v>

125
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you call someone kept him sub captain.</v>

126
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 2>You don't really think that guy has a boat,</v>

127
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.600
<v Speaker 2>but what if they're following?</v>

128
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

129
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:08.610
<v Speaker 2>I totally know.</v>

130
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 2>But they say there's one girl says it as a kid though and she doesn't talk like</v>

131
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 2>a kid in any other times except when she's having sex and she said that she</v>

132
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

133
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.990
<v Speaker 2>she regresses into like tolerable.</v>

134
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

135
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Well she's dating you.</v>

136
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.003
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

137
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.390
<v Speaker 2>some dark shit happened Bro.</v>

138
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

139
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.561
<v Speaker 2>but see,</v>

140
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:27.550
<v Speaker 2>I go deeper in it.</v>

141
00:04:27.551 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

142
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.340

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.230
<v Speaker 2>while you're fucking her seat leave for school.</v>

146
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean like I'm going to try to go down that path.</v>

147
00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:40.031
<v Speaker 2>If she brings it up,</v>

148
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:41.310
<v Speaker 2>I'll see if she plays along.</v>

149
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.980
<v Speaker 2>If she plays along,</v>

150
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:42.551
<v Speaker 2>it's like fun.</v>

151
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:45.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like trying to learn more about this person that I'm fucking,</v>

152

155
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.550

<v Speaker 2>That is God.</v>

158
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.843
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

161
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 2>You need to find better people,</v>

162
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

163
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:05.860
<v Speaker 2>you gotta work on yourself,</v>

164
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

165
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.000
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

167
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't make a noise.</v>

168
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.230
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know.</v>

169
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.260
<v Speaker 2>Breathe.</v>

170
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.700
<v Speaker 2>I slobbered in their hair and I</v>

171
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.453
<v Speaker 2>don't do anything.</v>

172
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.560
<v Speaker 1>I remember just being in awe and there was a bunch of other comedians that were</v>

173
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:20.951
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

179
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.961

00:05:25.961 --> 00:05:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Vini.</v>

181
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Me and Kevin James.</v>

182
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.010
<v Speaker 1>We're sitting around after the show and we're shaking.</v>

183
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:30.731
<v Speaker 1>Her head were like,</v>

184
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:31.181
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>

185
00:05:31.181 --> 00:05:31.900
<v Speaker 1>he's good.</v>

186
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

187
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>He apparently did two different hours on a Friday night.</v>

188
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.800
<v Speaker 1>He did two shows in eight and a 10 to two completely different hours,</v>

189
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.980
<v Speaker 1>completely top to bottom.</v>

190
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.790
<v Speaker 1>And they were like,</v>

191
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.050
<v Speaker 1>both of them were slaughtering his,</v>

192
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.150
<v Speaker 1>just a destroyer,</v>

193
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:47.140
<v Speaker 1>brilliant writer.</v>

194
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.520
<v Speaker 1>I remember feeling like what he,</v>

195
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.180
<v Speaker 1>he could take premises that you didn't think there was anything there and you</v>

196
00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:53.920
<v Speaker 1>can turn them into like one of your favorite bits,</v>

197
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 1>like you did a premise about buying a corvette and the guy trying to talk them</v>

198
00:05:57.441 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 1>into all sorts of stuff in the corvette.</v>

199
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.890
<v Speaker 1>And I remember thinking while he was doing this.</v>

200
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

201
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 1>how is this Guy gonna make this funny?</v>

202
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

203
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 1>It's talking about buying an expensive sports car and he's going to figure out</v>

204
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 1>how to make this funny number.</v>

205
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:08.691
<v Speaker 1>The ref thing.</v>

206
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:09.310
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>

207
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I had a bunch of the football,</v>

208
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.871
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

209
00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:11.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

210
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 1>we have problems seminar.</v>

211
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 1>And it really was because of him and let's say.</v>

212
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:19.080
<v Speaker 1>And they couldn't it because he's dead now.</v>

213
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>But what happened was we were getting different things at the same time,</v>

214
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

215
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 1>like different competitive with each other.</v>

216
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Well he was competitive with me and I think because people pitted us against</v>

217
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:32.240
<v Speaker 1>each other purely because we're short Italians.</v>

218
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:32.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

219
00:06:32.731 --> 00:06:33.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm a short Italian as well,</v>

220
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.090
<v Speaker 1>but you've never been anything but supportive.</v>

221
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.973
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

222
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:37.813
<v Speaker 1>Joseph,</v>

223
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

224
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.750
<v Speaker 1>not one time I said to him,</v>

225
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:41.950
<v Speaker 1>because somebody was struggling.</v>

226
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.201
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

227
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:43.460
<v Speaker 1>why don't we go out on the road together?</v>

228
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.001
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

229
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:44.960
<v Speaker 1>we'll fill up theaters.</v>

230
00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:45.381
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

231
00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:46.340
<v Speaker 1>why would I want to do that?</v>

232
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.420
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

233
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

234
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Make money to have fun.</v>

235
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.521
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

236
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 1>he didn't understand the concept.</v>

237
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

238
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:52.760
<v Speaker 1>He said to me one time,</v>

239
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:53.040
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

240
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Montreal comedy festival.</v>

241
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 1>You think I should go there?</v>

242
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:56.750
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

243
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.330
<v Speaker 1>go with the idea that you're going to meet beautiful girls.</v>

244
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Go to great restaurants and if you happen to get a deal,</v>

245
00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:02.144
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>

246
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.961
<v Speaker 1>but have fun.</v>

247
00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 1>And he was fun.</v>

248
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.461
<v Speaker 1>He looked at me like,</v>

249
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:04.591
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

250
00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:05.424
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean for fun?</v>

251
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:06.181
<v Speaker 1>This isn't fun.</v>

252
00:07:06.181 --> 00:07:07.014
<v Speaker 1>This just,</v>

253
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.023

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.043
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

257

258
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:15.140
<v Speaker 1>He was seeing never knew how good he was or he never enjoyed how good he was.</v>
