00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:54.800
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to go grab it</v>

00:00:58.791 --> 00:00:59.031
<v Speaker 1>Bert,</v>

47
00:00:59.031 --> 00:00:59.241
<v Speaker 1>Bert,</v>

48

<v Speaker 1>Try to change it.</v>

51
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.950
<v Speaker 1>That's not a bad idea because people probably can't spell crusher</v>

52
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.240

58
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

59
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Because then everyone knows how to spell cards should be a crutch for us.</v>

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.480
<v Speaker 1>You mean like Rogan?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Talking about this allows me to keep in shape.</v>

240
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.390
<v Speaker 2>If you're like me and you don't have the time to get to the gym or the view will</v>

241
00:05:33.391 --> 00:05:34.230
<v Speaker 2>enjoy this view</v>

242
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.193
<v Speaker 2>type</v>

243
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.653
<v Speaker 2>vaginal muscle,</v>

244
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:40.190
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

245
00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.710
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

246
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.730
<v Speaker 2>it's a stupid product,</v>

247
00:05:41.731 --> 00:05:43.080
<v Speaker 2>but I bet she's going to make $1 billion.</v>

248
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.470
<v Speaker 2>Every time I see another plastic thing with belts or police or leavers,</v>

249
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:47.250
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

250
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.450
<v Speaker 2>I gotta come up with the next one and I go,</v>

251
00:05:48.451 --> 00:05:50.250
<v Speaker 2>there's no more ways to do a crunch.</v>

252
00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:52.290
<v Speaker 2>And then some asshole comes up with the,</v>

253
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.850
<v Speaker 2>here's the device you strap on,</v>

254
00:05:53.851 --> 00:05:54.331
<v Speaker 2>lay down,</v>

255
00:05:54.331 --> 00:05:55.320
<v Speaker 2>and it works your core.</v>

256
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.370
<v Speaker 2>They always keep coming up.</v>

257
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.230
<v Speaker 2>There's one that's just a spring with a stick and he'd go like that.</v>

258
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:00.840
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen that one?</v>

259
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

260
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 2>It's like sticks between your life looks so stupid.</v>

261
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 2>Like a shock absorber.</v>

262
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.270
<v Speaker 2>And he pushed down like my dad believed in the weight belts.</v>

263
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 2>That would shock you like a little ad belts.</v>

264
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

265
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.390
<v Speaker 2>My Dad's big old gut.</v>

266
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:14.810
<v Speaker 2>So he went and got two of the most powerful ones you could get and he would put</v>

267
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:16.820
<v Speaker 2>them on you supposed to be like lose your belly with Kay white jelly or</v>

268
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:18.980
<v Speaker 2>something like that so it doesn't conduct right to the skin.</v>

269
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.061
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't do that.</v>

270
00:06:20.061 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 2>He's giant in Portuguese and angry.</v>

271
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:22.670
<v Speaker 2>So He'd wear two belts,</v>

272
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.700
<v Speaker 2>like sit there for like four hours and just watch Jerry Springer and then he's</v>

273
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:28.480
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

274
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.350
<v Speaker 2>He would have either played,</v>

275
00:06:29.351 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 2>connect the dots on his belly,</v>

276
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.560
<v Speaker 2>but he was just shocking his gut to some ways that didn't work.</v>

277
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:34.461
<v Speaker 2>It didn't work.</v>

278
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:35.510
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't work well,</v>

279
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:39.140
<v Speaker 2>electrical muscle stimulation they use in rehab so it has some sort of an</v>

280
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:39.501
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>

281
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:39.740
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

282
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.190
<v Speaker 2>but it's more grainy nine plastic belt that you're getting at 4:00 AM is not</v>

283
00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:45.020
<v Speaker 2>going to be the same of stem you're getting from,</v>

284
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.820
<v Speaker 2>but if just chiropractors crank them up,</v>

285
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.530
<v Speaker 2>have the same effect at times,</v>

286
00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:49.970
<v Speaker 2>make noises,</v>

287
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.260
<v Speaker 2>but 23 does that.</v>

288
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:52.120
<v Speaker 2>When he moves in bout</v>

289
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.060
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

290
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:55.491
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>

291
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:55.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

292
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.030
<v Speaker 2>bad muscle pull my leg wants to put me on that shit.</v>

293
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.870
<v Speaker 2>Electrical muscular stimulation and try to revive the area that was torn.</v>

294
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.330
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting to work.</v>

295
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

296
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:05.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

297
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

298
00:07:05.231 --> 00:07:06.400
<v Speaker 2>everything heals up in time.</v>

299
00:07:06.401 --> 00:07:08.140
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to say what exactly made heal up.</v>

300
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.561
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

301
00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:09.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

302
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.420
<v Speaker 2>they had,</v>

303
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.253
<v Speaker 2>they were selling them on,</v>

304
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.640
<v Speaker 2>on TV for bodybuilders,</v>

305
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:12.580
<v Speaker 2>but if that shit worked,</v>

306
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.200
<v Speaker 2>there'd be due to her addicted to that.</v>

307
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.460
<v Speaker 2>I do think maybe wearing right now it was actually a place in oh wow.</v>

308
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.490
<v Speaker 2>Or a member and there was a place back in Boston,</v>

309
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:23.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

310
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.460
<v Speaker 2>when I body by design,</v>

311
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.540
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was called,</v>

312
00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:27.021
<v Speaker 2>it might be,</v>

313
00:07:27.021 --> 00:07:28.100
<v Speaker 2>I might have made it the wrong name.</v>

314
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.690
<v Speaker 2>I think it was babied by design though.</v>

315
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.823
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

316
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.720
<v Speaker 2>that might be totally wrong though.</v>

317
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:33.950
<v Speaker 2>Don't sue me on us.</v>

318
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.933
<v Speaker 2>But it was a,</v>

319
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:35.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

320
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.930
<v Speaker 2>a place where all you did was go and get zapped.</v>

321
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.990
<v Speaker 2>You go there and lay down and they would cover you with these electrodes and</v>

322
00:07:41.991 --> 00:07:44.330
<v Speaker 2>they would give you a body by design.</v>

323
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Like that was the idea,</v>

324
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:45.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

325
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.480
<v Speaker 2>and I they couldn't have possibly,</v>

326
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.501
<v Speaker 2>are you sure,</v>

327
00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:49.340
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

328
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.611
<v Speaker 2>and that work,</v>

329
00:07:50.611 --> 00:07:52.280
<v Speaker 2>there would be no 24 hour fitness or la fitness.</v>

330
00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:55.130
<v Speaker 2>I want to make the cheap version of that with the plastic Chinese parts.</v>

331
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.880
<v Speaker 2>And you would just do it wast just be break up in the morning.</v>

332
00:07:58.881 --> 00:07:59.714
<v Speaker 2>I'll swole.</v>

333
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.110
<v Speaker 2>But Bruce Lee was into that shit too.</v>

334
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:03.501
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

335
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:04.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

336
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.893
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

337
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.760
<v Speaker 2>people tend to buy these machines that you stand on and he's cleaned that</v>

338
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:11.030
<v Speaker 2>Russian cosmonauts he was done and it just shakes you and the clean up makes you</v>

339
00:08:11.031 --> 00:08:11.864
<v Speaker 2>and shame.</v>

340
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:12.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

341
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.700
<v Speaker 2>Ryan doesn't make any in shape.</v>

342
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:14.030
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

343
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.890
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't get you in shape like an,</v>

344
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.660
<v Speaker 2>it stimulates your glands.</v>

345
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.880
<v Speaker 2>There's really the Russian cosmonauts wherever those stand space.</v>

346
00:08:19.881 --> 00:08:20.361
<v Speaker 2>We'll talk about it.</v>

347
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:20.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try it.</v>

348
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:21.763
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try it.</v>

349
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:22.980
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

350
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:23.813
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Pereira.</v>

351
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:24.241
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

352
00:08:24.241 --> 00:08:27.330
<v Speaker 2>podcast pitches that everybody know what's up bitches.</v>

353
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:29.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

354
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.100
<v Speaker 2>Like I used to be,</v>

355
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.060
<v Speaker 2>I used to be fat.</v>

356
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.460
<v Speaker 2>I got and then I got crazy the other end of spectrum.</v>

357
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

358
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:34.640
<v Speaker 2>do this.</v>

359
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.473
<v Speaker 2>Just this</v>

360
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:42.870
<v Speaker 2>35 pounds.</v>

361
00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.300
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>

362
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.070
<v Speaker 2>but and using your whole body,</v>

363
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.850
<v Speaker 2>you do two things.</v>

364
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:48.803
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

365
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.150
<v Speaker 2>you made your body work as a unit.</v>

366
00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:52.560
<v Speaker 2>What'd you don't do?</v>

367
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:53.663
<v Speaker 2>Just like,</v>

368
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with any of that stuff that's very isolating stuff.</v>

369
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.183
<v Speaker 2>No bench,</v>

370
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.360
<v Speaker 2>no curls,</v>

371
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.650
<v Speaker 2>no tricep extension.</v>

372
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.300
<v Speaker 2>I think all that stuff is bad for you.</v>

373
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.273
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

374
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.910
<v Speaker 2>I think it gives you an imbalance.</v>

375
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.130
<v Speaker 2>I think the best one you use your body,</v>

376
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.780
<v Speaker 2>it's used at all as one unit.</v>

377
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

378
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:13.171
<v Speaker 2>it probably is though.</v>

379
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:13.890
<v Speaker 2>Like my,</v>

380
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:14.940
<v Speaker 2>with my knee issues,</v>

381
00:09:14.941 --> 00:09:18.240
<v Speaker 2>that's going to limit what exercise blew it out to the slots,</v>

382
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.403
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

383
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:20.521
<v Speaker 2>click.</v>

384
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:22.050
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not spending all this stuff,</v>

385
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.510
<v Speaker 2>but you know he's doing,</v>

386
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

387
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:25.501
<v Speaker 2>he does.</v>

388
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:26.940
<v Speaker 2>But he knows what he's doing for him and he's a,</v>

389
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.200
<v Speaker 2>he's a monster.</v>

390
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.153
<v Speaker 2>I'm a ton of time.</v>

391
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.480
<v Speaker 2>It should be 35 pounds.</v>

392
00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:34.640
<v Speaker 2>His playing weight.</v>

393
00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Is it right to count bass by tapping your penis and other for it?</v>

394
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.830
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that's something that he's just doing.</v>

395
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.910
<v Speaker 2>This is not going to let you cheat.</v>

396
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.980
<v Speaker 2>You didn't do a little newbie.</v>

397
00:09:46.981 --> 00:09:47.814
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

398
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.040
<v Speaker 2>like same thing.</v>

399
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.340
<v Speaker 2>It's still like this clean hold it there like that.</v>

400
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:53.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

401
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.780
<v Speaker 2>Press it up big time.</v>

402

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.920
<v Speaker 2>Hold it down,</v>

405
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.540

<v Speaker 2>Do you remember were there in Phoenix where there's a video game and you could</v>

411
00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:24.830
<v Speaker 2>play like a boss again?</v>

412
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:25.151
