1
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches will probably have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a following of Irish people to,</v>

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.690
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Who gives a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of the Irish speaking,</v>

4
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.290
<v Speaker 1>I've got them right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

5
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.213
<v Speaker 1>Hey listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

6
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>this guy has balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why I respect the fuck out of</v>

7
00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:19.500
<v Speaker 1>conor Mcgregor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just because he's an awesome fighter</v>

8
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:21.750
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lost the Nate Diaz who's also an</v>

9
00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:25.930
<v Speaker 1>awesome fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who the fuck will fight anybody who</v>

10
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.160
<v Speaker 1>will just jump up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The light goes,</v>

11
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Bj.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bj tried it and you know what?</v>

12
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Even though a Bj didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had success once,</v>

13
00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:35.700
<v Speaker 1>at least at one 70 he beat mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

14
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:40.701
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a really good reason why all</v>

15
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:43.080
<v Speaker 1>elite boxers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestlers,</v>

16
00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:47.340
<v Speaker 1>fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight cutting is so massively</v>

17
00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Virtually everybody,</v>

18
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>there are some crazy people out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Anthony Johnson.</v>

19
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 1>That's the exception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but generally there's a really good</v>

20
00:00:56.791 --> 00:01:00.720
<v Speaker 1>reason most people are torturing</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to get as light as possible</v>

21
00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:05.010
<v Speaker 1>because at the elite level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five pounds makes a big fucking</v>

22
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

23
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.440
<v Speaker 1>It makes a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just five pounds,</v>

24
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>10 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 pound different elite level men.</v>

25
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Even the best guys aren't going up</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at half a Mendez.</v>

26
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.260
<v Speaker 1>No doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably pound for pound.</v>

27
00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>The best guy in Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably him and Marcello,</v>

28
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:20.251
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack,</v>

29
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:21.510
<v Speaker 1>they're all up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pam,</v>

30
00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:23.370
<v Speaker 1>pound for pound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many good guys now.</v>

31
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible now.</v>

32
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.370
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

33
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even Marcello Nolan's trying to go up in</v>

34
00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's trying to go,</v>

35
00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:33.480
<v Speaker 1>let me do this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try the weight category</v>

<v Speaker 1>Know everybody's on the craziest died.</v>

37
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 1>They need three months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get serious about it.</v>

38
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.490
<v Speaker 1>They're on instagram posts in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking broccoli every day with chicken.</v>

39
00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Fucking selfies of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their hubs and shit.</v>

40
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 1>You know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're killing themselves because not</v>

41
00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>because it feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like shit.</v>

42
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.150
<v Speaker 1>They all love eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so important.</v>

43
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so everybody knows you just can't go up</v>

44
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:02.250
<v Speaker 1>and goddamn white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bj was,</v>

45
00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Bj was the one that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

46
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.330
<v Speaker 1>He went up to light heavyweight and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

47
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Chino,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five foot eight.</v>

48
00:02:09.491 --> 00:02:10.770
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't even light heavyweight,</v>

49
00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was heavyweight.</v>

50
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Because Leo Machida was like two Oh</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>

51
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

52
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I think that fight was like technically</v>
<v Speaker 1>a heavyweight fight.</v>

53
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Find that out.</v>

55
00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:26.930

<v Speaker 1>That's out of shame.</v>

56
00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:31.280
<v Speaker 1>And did you ever see when he used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight kickboxing fat,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Rewind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should you want to see something again?</v>

120
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 1>And you didn't fast forward it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we thought it was live.</v>

121
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 1>So Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey called me hysterical and he gave it</v>

122
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:14.830
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once he realized he gave it</v>

123
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:16.820
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hung up because Oh shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's how it went down.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I never been in a party where everyone</v>

<v Speaker 1>I never screamed so loud in my</v>

143
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 1>motherfucking life at any fight ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was shocking.</v>

144
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 1>It was the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked like Carla was just had his</v>

145
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>hands down cause I got this</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker,</v>

146
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.130
<v Speaker 1>he was landon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was tagging him.</v>

147
00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:29.720
<v Speaker 1>It looked like you heard him a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

148
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.670
<v Speaker 1>He definitely tag them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

149
00:06:31.671 --> 00:06:32.910
<v Speaker 1>It looked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

150
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was over for nate.</v>

151
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 1>I really did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when he turned it around and the way</v>

152
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:42.920
<v Speaker 1>it finished and when he put that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>rear naked choke and he put that</v>

153
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:46.490
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker and like a Super Ninja,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weight,</v>

154
00:06:46.491 --> 00:06:47.810
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way he mounted,</v>

155
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.650
<v Speaker 1>if you don't do Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would never know the way he fucking</v>

156
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 1>mounted and his balance.</v>

157
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 1>You could see the balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see the beauty in that mound</v>

158
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.840
<v Speaker 1>and the way he was riding him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a professional fucking a champion</v>

159
00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:04.280
<v Speaker 1>Rodeo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking reiner,</v>

160
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.730
<v Speaker 1>all is balanced is all beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when he took his back,</v>

161
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.630
<v Speaker 1>the way he put that fucking Hook in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

162
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.510
<v Speaker 1>it was so efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't no hiccup where he hit the,</v>

163
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:15.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

164
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.920
<v Speaker 1>this jaw and then he had to set up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you got to feel,</v>

165
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.980
<v Speaker 1>it just went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was fucking insanity.</v>

166
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 1>So perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so fucking like that technique was</v>

167
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.060
<v Speaker 1>about is flawless and as beautiful as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get.</v>

168
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was two big points was that we had</v>

169
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:39.020
<v Speaker 1>never seen conor face adversity and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>had never seen him on the ground with a</v>

170
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:41.240
<v Speaker 1>real Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like nate.</v>

171
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Nate's got a nasty ground game man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His ground now.</v>

172
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.330
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are talking in a lot of shit on</v>

173
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:48.164
<v Speaker 1>Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>

174
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 1>I know Connor's digits is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's come to my school.</v>

175
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.910
<v Speaker 1>That guys good just cause he got</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain.</v>

176
00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was already here.</v>

177
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.260
<v Speaker 1>But even if he wasn't her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get mounted by my purple belt</v>

178
00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:03.470
<v Speaker 1>sometimes and I get my bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some shit going on and add</v>

179
00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 1>punches and fucking all this height.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just cause he got mountain and got his</v>

180
00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:10.040
<v Speaker 1>back taking does not mean connor's</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu sucks.</v>

181
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Don't get it twisted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a little hurt.</v>

182
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Nate Diaz is really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

183
00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:17.570
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

184
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Like Nate Diaz could probably do that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

185
00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean I suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

186
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.420
<v Speaker 1>He could probably get my back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean I suck.</v>

187
00:08:23.421 --> 00:08:25.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm a high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

188
00:08:25.011 --> 00:08:27.440
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he got hurt and it's real simple.</v>

189
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:29.480
<v Speaker 1>When you get tagged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way he got tagged and what you're</v>

190
00:08:29.481 --> 00:08:29.990
<v Speaker 1>trying to take.</v>

191
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Nate Diaz down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got hurt.</v>

192
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.000
<v Speaker 1>He probably had no idea what the fuck he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing.</v>

193
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:35.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had an MMA fight,</v>

194
00:08:35.751 --> 00:08:40.040
<v Speaker 1>but sean was telling me about when</v>
<v Speaker 1>Travis Brown hit him and that he was</v>

195
00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:40.491
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

196
00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:42.680
<v Speaker 1>I know how to get out of the mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when travis hit me,</v>

197
00:08:42.681 --> 00:08:44.390
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what I was doing.</v>

198
00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:45.530
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was out of it.</v>

199
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.950
<v Speaker 1>I think that we mustn't get punched in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the face.</v>

200
00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:53.120
<v Speaker 1>You can't judge his Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like judging is walking.</v>

201
00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:55.740
<v Speaker 1>If you get head kicked connor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she jitsu good.</v>

202
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.610
<v Speaker 1>Nate Diaz.</v>

203
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.710
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu is just way better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

204
00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:00.960
<v Speaker 2>If that's all it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sunny punches you in the face and then</v>

205
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:01.980
<v Speaker 2>you walk funny like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

206
00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:03.720
<v Speaker 2>you need to work on your walking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

207
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:09.090
<v Speaker 2>they got memes of connor like it like</v>
<v Speaker 2>him in like a kids Jiu Jitsu class and</v>

208
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:11.370
<v Speaker 2>they put it in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one that's going around.</v>

209
00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:13.740
<v Speaker 2>I think that's hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what he's heard?</v>

210
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:15.030
<v Speaker 2>He is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust me,</v>

211
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.130
<v Speaker 2>connors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu is very,</v>

212
00:09:17.131 --> 00:09:18.840
<v Speaker 2>very standard to Ross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

213
00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:21.570
<v Speaker 2>he's not a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in that first round was nasty</v>

214
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.660
<v Speaker 2>standup look very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's just a look.</v>

215
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.570
<v Speaker 2>First of all is Nate Diaz is not a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

216
00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:30.870
<v Speaker 2>70 all they did fight one 70 twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fought us.</v>

217
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:33.900
<v Speaker 2>Dungan Kim and the fobt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

218
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.040
<v Speaker 2>rory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rory Macdonald,</v>

219
00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:37.530
<v Speaker 2>remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fought those guys at one 70 so he did</v>

220
00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:41.790
<v Speaker 2>have two fights at one 70 but he's a one</v>
<v Speaker 2>55 or he's a big one.</v>

221
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:45.720
<v Speaker 2>55 or he's big and long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he could ever make one</v>

222
00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:49.620
<v Speaker 2>45 I just don't think he could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Connor barely can do it.</v>

223
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>connor barely can do it.</v>

224
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.420
<v Speaker 2>When you see conor at the weigh ins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean those photos from the winds are</v>

225
00:09:54.421 --> 00:09:57.960
<v Speaker 2>pretty legendary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's insane that we do this,</v>

226
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.330
<v Speaker 2>that we let these guys dehydrate</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves like that.</v>

227
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:04.200
<v Speaker 2>I think whatever nate walks around that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what he should fight at.</v>

228
00:10:04.201 --> 00:10:07.680
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if connor really walks</v>
<v Speaker 2>around at one 68 which what he weighed</v>

229
00:10:07.681 --> 00:10:10.410
<v Speaker 2>in and nate raid one 69 they're only one</v>
<v Speaker 2>pound different.</v>

230
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.110
<v Speaker 2>And Nate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know nate had some body fat on him</v>

231
00:10:13.111 --> 00:10:15.210
<v Speaker 2>cause he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't preparing for this at all.</v>

232
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.530
<v Speaker 2>I think connor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think connor could make some noise at</v>

233
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:22.020
<v Speaker 2>one 55 shrink down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you see the two of those</v>

234
00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:22.910
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we do it?</v>

235
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:24.990
<v Speaker 2>Look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the difference between how he</v>

236
00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:27.750
<v Speaker 2>weighed in before and how we wait in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this time.</v>

237
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:28.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my God,</v>

238
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.930
<v Speaker 2>he looks like he has some fucking crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease that like won't let food absorb</v>

239
00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.320
<v Speaker 2>in his body on the top one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know like he's got some crazy</v>

240
00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:42.210
<v Speaker 2>illness and then on the bottom he looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>great full faced.</v>

241
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.660
<v Speaker 2>But you know if he can make one 45 he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to continue to do it.</v>

242
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:52.200
<v Speaker 2>Can you think gets in the ring card?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Girls are like sitting right there.</v>

243
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.780
<v Speaker 2>Is that an accident is perfect for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures.</v>

244
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.240
<v Speaker 2>That's why they stand their ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

245
00:10:57.241 --> 00:10:59.320
<v Speaker 2>It's to balance out that dude in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>underwear.</v>

246
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.870
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's funny.</v>

247
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.500
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an accurate,</v>

248
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:14.420
<v Speaker 2>he could completely dominate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Continue to dominate the one 45 division</v>

249
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:19.610
<v Speaker 2>and I think he could make a lot of epic</v>
<v Speaker 2>fights at one 55 five went beat some big</v>

250
00:11:20.161 --> 00:11:22.020
<v Speaker 2>names but then lose to some other big</v>
<v Speaker 2>names.</v>

251
00:11:22.021 --> 00:11:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Like he'll be one of the top guys at 55</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he'll just clean house</v>

252
00:11:26.161 --> 00:11:30.810
<v Speaker 2>like he did it 45 but I believe if he</v>
<v Speaker 2>stayed at 55 he would do some serious</v>

253
00:11:30.811 --> 00:11:32.460
<v Speaker 2>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

254
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

255
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

256
00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.480
<v Speaker 2>He's saying after the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that perfect ship.</v>

257
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Perfect Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love what he's doing.</v>

258
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.210
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love how he's handling it.</v>

259
00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:42.180
<v Speaker 2>I think he handled it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His laws better than anybody ever,</v>

260
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.800
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said on the right,</v>

261
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.120
<v Speaker 2>she'll in victory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm be humbling defeat.</v>

262
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.230
<v Speaker 2>No matter what happened in that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his next fight,</v>

263
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:51.600
<v Speaker 2>whoever he's fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to get fucked up.</v>

264
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.320
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mean.</v>

265
00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:55.150
<v Speaker 2>What if you faced Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

266
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 2>tough fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to cut them up.</v>

267
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.040
<v Speaker 2>I bet he tags him a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you're right.</v>

268
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:02.950
<v Speaker 2>I bet he tags and I bet you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can tag everybody to hit some people</v>

269
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.500
<v Speaker 2>and just cause he got knocked out.</v>

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.730
<v Speaker 2>half the people get knocked out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the physicality of Dos Anjos who's a lot</v>

306
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but give her a world tour first.</v>

307
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.200
<v Speaker 2>She won one of the greatest victories in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the history of MMA.</v>

308
00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:55.360
<v Speaker 2>Damn down down on the scorecards in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fourth round with two minutes to go.</v>

309
00:13:55.631 --> 00:13:58.690
<v Speaker 2>She hits a takedown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>takes her back,</v>

310
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.540
<v Speaker 2>almost get shook over the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hangs on,</v>

311
00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.730
<v Speaker 2>hangs on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was so dramatic.</v>

312
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.250
<v Speaker 2>That was like the end of the thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So smart.</v>

313
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.280
<v Speaker 2>She fought so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She did everything that all the experts</v>

314
00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:13.780
<v Speaker 2>were saying she was going to need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She did everything she avoided and kicks</v>

315
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.680
<v Speaker 2>in Russian and she had to pull it off</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

316
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:18.970
<v Speaker 2>what was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our minute left.</v>

317
00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.210
<v Speaker 2>Tell me how much dislike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like somewhere around two minutes to go</v>

318
00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:23.980
<v Speaker 2>when she went for the take down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When she,</v>

319
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.580
<v Speaker 2>when she got ahold of her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're down to last round.</v>

320
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.320
<v Speaker 2>Last round edge wasn't winning the</v>
<v Speaker 2>round.</v>

321
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.780
<v Speaker 2>Nothing really had happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like big and significant.</v>

322
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.960
<v Speaker 2>She had a take down 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably lose it on the cards.</v>

323
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.970
<v Speaker 2>Crappy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't look at the cards,</v>

324
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.400
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she won that one round for sure when she</v>

325
00:14:39.401 --> 00:14:41.530
<v Speaker 2>took her down and that went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made everybody go,</v>

326
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.750
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the second?</v>

327
00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Was it the second round that she took</v>
<v Speaker 2>her down?</v>

328
00:14:45.471 --> 00:14:48.190
<v Speaker 2>This was dominating her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

329
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:49.510
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the second.</v>

330
00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.690
<v Speaker 2>Her meesha is wrestling me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her wrestling is a lot better than</v>

331
00:14:53.691 --> 00:14:55.580
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before she's hustling dude.</v>

332
00:14:55.581 --> 00:14:57.000
<v Speaker 2>She hustled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She keeps getting better.</v>

333
00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.510
<v Speaker 2>Holly Holm and easy to take down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take down the fence.</v>

334
00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:01.370
<v Speaker 2>That's like her main shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

335
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.790
<v Speaker 2>she probably works on her takedown</v>
<v Speaker 2>defense more than her Jujitsu.</v>

336
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:05.900
<v Speaker 2>So this is the cards.</v>

337
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.833
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

338
00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:10.260
<v Speaker 2>So what does it say and basically what</v>
<v Speaker 2>are we doing here?</v>

339
00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:13.410

<v Speaker 2>these are confusing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>so it must've been the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hmm.</v>

349
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:36.390
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

350
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.433
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

351
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.270
<v Speaker 2>All three at ten nine for the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

352
00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.490
<v Speaker 2>All three had ten eight for the second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

353
00:15:43.491 --> 00:15:45.950
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all three at ten nine for the third</v>

354
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:49.220
<v Speaker 2>and for the fourth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So does that make it a draw?</v>

355
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:50.840
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means holly was ahead.</v>

356
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do they judge the fourth and then</v>

357
00:15:53.391 --> 00:15:56.630
<v Speaker 2>the fifth she was ahead in the fourth so</v>
<v Speaker 2>holly was ahead by one point,</v>

358
00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:57.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

359
00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.290
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though she'd won three rounds.</v>

360
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.480
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean ten eight if she would have won</v>

361
00:16:02.481 --> 00:16:03.440
<v Speaker 2>that round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would have been a draw,</v>

362
00:16:03.441 --> 00:16:04.670
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

363
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.650
<v Speaker 2>But she was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she wasn't really winning on the round.</v>

364
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm surprised that they all gave him a</v>
<v Speaker 2>ten eight that's good.</v>

365
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.200
<v Speaker 2>That's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

366
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.240
<v Speaker 2>Good job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill.</v>

367
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.710
<v Speaker 2>Today their name's Marcos for solids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good job.</v>

368
00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:16.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

369
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.250
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a real ten eight that's how 10</v>

370
00:16:19.251 --> 00:16:20.720
<v Speaker 2>h should look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone takes it down,</v>

371
00:16:20.721 --> 00:16:21.554
<v Speaker 2>beat the shit out of you.</v>

372
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.500
<v Speaker 2>But just what an what a finish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>

373
00:16:24.501 --> 00:16:27.450
<v Speaker 2>What was amazing about it and you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>holly fought smart,</v>

374
00:16:27.451 --> 00:16:30.650
<v Speaker 2>she used that side kick a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's so good with their movement.</v>

375
00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:32.870
<v Speaker 2>She caught me should with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>punches to man,</v>

376
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:34.970
<v Speaker 2>but she wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she wasn't going after her.</v>

377
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.160
<v Speaker 2>She would catch it with punches and stay</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the outside.</v>

378
00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.130
<v Speaker 2>She was fighting a smart fight and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>got taken down.</v>

379
00:16:40.131 --> 00:16:43.310
<v Speaker 2>She got dominated on the ground by</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meesha and that's when I was like wow.</v>

380
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Neesha's fucking top game is solid as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>rock.</v>

381
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Like our control is excellent and she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking strong man.</v>

382
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:54.770
<v Speaker 2>She's strong cause holly's strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holly Holm is strong.</v>

383
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.730
<v Speaker 2>I was really impressed with their ground</v>
<v Speaker 2>and pound really impressed with your top</v>

384
00:16:58.731 --> 00:17:00.560
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you know what man,</v>

385
00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:04.220
<v Speaker 2>the next round Holly Holm got right back</v>
<v Speaker 2>on her fucking bicycle and,</v>

386
00:17:04.221 --> 00:17:07.820
<v Speaker 2>and and probably in everyone's eyes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when that round right,</v>

387
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.640
<v Speaker 2>all those judges eyes I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it was a,</v>

388
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.730
<v Speaker 2>if that would have wanted a decision</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would have given it to holly.</v>

389
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just based on,</v>

390
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.633
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

391
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.010
<v Speaker 2>depending upon how that feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real damage.</v>

392
00:17:19.011 --> 00:17:21.560
<v Speaker 2>She never knocked me shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She never hurt me.</v>

393
00:17:21.561 --> 00:17:23.440
<v Speaker 2>She right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the shipper I heard,</v>

394
00:17:23.441 --> 00:17:25.640
<v Speaker 2>never heard her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She tagged her a couple times where,</v>

395
00:17:25.641 --> 00:17:27.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she snapped her head back a little bit,</v>

396
00:17:27.351 --> 00:17:29.540
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't anything like was she</v>
<v Speaker 2>alone was wrong.</v>

397
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:30.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Legs giving out.</v>

398
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.000
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>

399
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:33.140
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

400
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:37.970
<v Speaker 2>it was about to be a semi boring</v>
<v Speaker 2>decision overall.</v>

401
00:17:37.971 --> 00:17:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Like who would want to watch that fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>again?</v>

402
00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.600
<v Speaker 2>The second round was kind of cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was going to be one of those fights,</v>

403
00:17:41.601 --> 00:17:44.870
<v Speaker 2>but just like that me shit turned it</v>
<v Speaker 2>into one of the greatest fights ever.</v>

404
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:45.760
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

405
00:17:45.761 --> 00:17:50.250
<v Speaker 2>And I come back that last second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like a grand slam and the bottom</v>

406
00:17:50.251 --> 00:17:53.280
<v Speaker 2>of the ninth in the scramble to get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back.</v>

407
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.920
<v Speaker 2>Her scramble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way she held on as Holly Hollywood</v>

408
00:17:55.921 --> 00:17:58.830
<v Speaker 2>kept moving and changing and adjusting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She kept holding on.</v>

409
00:17:58.831 --> 00:18:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Then finally the Hail Mary Hollie tries</v>
<v Speaker 2>to flip her over the top and she hangs</v>

410
00:18:02.671 --> 00:18:07.020
<v Speaker 2>on and hangs on to the choke and sinks</v>
<v Speaker 2>it in and gets the hooks in and,</v>

411
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:10.080
<v Speaker 2>and when holly goes to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>punching in the air,</v>

412
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.320
<v Speaker 2>you know those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know those old nfl films,</v>

413
00:18:13.321 --> 00:18:18.060
<v Speaker 2>like when you watch those at the super</v>
<v Speaker 2>bowl from 1978 or something and have</v>

414
00:18:18.061 --> 00:18:21.090
<v Speaker 2>that voice in the toddler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing the slow mo and these all</v>

415
00:18:21.091 --> 00:18:22.620
<v Speaker 2>these old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

416
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.880
<v Speaker 2>memorable plays at epic plays in 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

417
00:18:26.881 --> 00:18:31.080
<v Speaker 2>When they look back at that and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have some old like Orson Welles type a</v>

418
00:18:31.081 --> 00:18:33.490
<v Speaker 2>narrator talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

419
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:39.020
<v Speaker 2>about going through all that transition</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was a lot of drama going on</v>

420
00:18:39.241 --> 00:18:40.290
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

421
00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:42.000
<v Speaker 2>She didn't just take her back and choke</v>
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>

422
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.040
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of shit to handle.</v>

423
00:18:44.041 --> 00:18:46.710
<v Speaker 2>So much was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you gotta watch this happening.</v>

424
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was incredible to rear naked choke.</v>

425
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:54.780
<v Speaker 2>The scramble scramble was just so epic</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the drama building up,</v>

426
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:57.630
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's down on the cards most likely you</v>

427
00:18:57.631 --> 00:18:58.890
<v Speaker 2>can't watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were watched.</v>

428
00:18:58.891 --> 00:19:00.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can never watch does.</v>

429
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.420
<v Speaker 2>She's down in the cards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most likely she's about to,</v>

430
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.810
<v Speaker 2>she's about to lose a decision probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

431
00:19:06.811 --> 00:19:08.340
<v Speaker 2>She's got a hold of her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

432
00:19:08.341 --> 00:19:09.870
<v Speaker 2>She's on her back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

433
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:11.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got that joke.</v>

434
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.270
<v Speaker 2>It just kept going and going back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when holly went to sleep,</v>

435
00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.160
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she didn't even tap.</v>

436
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.800
<v Speaker 2>She's went out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She went out punching.</v>

437
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.620
<v Speaker 2>She was throwing punches when she went</v>
<v Speaker 2>out to y'all.</v>

438
00:19:22.621 --> 00:19:25.230
<v Speaker 2>Bad Ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to be to go out throwing</v>

439
00:19:25.231 --> 00:19:28.410
<v Speaker 2>punches and how bad ass that girl is.</v>

440
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.980
<v Speaker 2>She went out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she went out like throwing punches.</v>

441
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.580
<v Speaker 2>She didn't want to tap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

442
00:19:35.581 --> 00:19:37.260
<v Speaker 2>That was a good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>

443
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

444
00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:43.860
<v Speaker 2>Back was the best fight of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was that the biggest UFC ever.</v>

445
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

446
00:19:45.001 --> 00:19:46.500
<v Speaker 2>that was the biggest UFC ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

447
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.440
<v Speaker 2>I would say I the fight of the night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's not the fight of the night.</v>

448
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.440
<v Speaker 2>It's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're both equally insane.</v>

449
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:56.040
<v Speaker 2>There's no like one better finale or one</v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

450
00:19:56.041 --> 00:19:59.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think the conor fight was more</v>

451
00:19:59.731 --> 00:20:02.630
<v Speaker 2>excited because all the way through</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot of damage going on and</v>

452
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.100
<v Speaker 2>it was a lot of fire gone on with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>holly fight.</v>

453
00:20:05.101 --> 00:20:07.470
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of dancing around taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>shots.</v>

454
00:20:07.471 --> 00:20:08.570
<v Speaker 2>It was a Lotta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

455
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.360
<v Speaker 2>definitely what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot less action overall.</v>

456
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you compress those,</v>

457
00:20:13.651 --> 00:20:16.830
<v Speaker 2>if you take out a couple of those rounds</v>
<v Speaker 2>and compress it all into one round,</v>

458
00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:18.390
<v Speaker 2>then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

459
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:22.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you gotta be pleased by it</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the whole thing.</v>

460
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.220
<v Speaker 2>I think what's most important is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

461
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.000
<v Speaker 2>after it ends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have some like definitive conclusion</v>

462
00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.790
<v Speaker 2>that if it takes a while to get that</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitive conclusion,</v>

463
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's going to give a two</v>

<v Speaker 2>so juicy at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

467
00:20:39.601 --> 00:20:42.510

521
00:22:45.011 --> 00:22:46.910
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause she's not the biggest fan of.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and there's a bunch of them out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

527
00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:00.453
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

528
00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:02.930
<v Speaker 2>they didn't really want to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>offensively good at Jujitsu.</v>

529
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:03.820
<v Speaker 2>They didn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

530
00:23:03.821 --> 00:23:04.654
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

531
00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:06.410
<v Speaker 2>they weren't attracted to passing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guard,</v>

532
00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.040
<v Speaker 2>taking the back and choking PPI.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of wrestlers out there</v>

533
00:23:09.041 --> 00:23:11.140
<v Speaker 2>that just want her to keep it on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>feet,</v>

534
00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:12.820
<v Speaker 2>do a little take down the fence.</v>

535
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:16.120
<v Speaker 2>And if you have to take them down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay in half guard and pound them out</v>

536
00:23:16.121 --> 00:23:18.040
<v Speaker 2>and just keep it simple and keep it like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

537
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:19.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

538
00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of wrestlers like that.</v>

539
00:23:22.031 --> 00:23:23.440
<v Speaker 2>Not that she's the restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're strikers.</v>

540
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:26.920
<v Speaker 2>They're strikers like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been a quite a few throughout</v>

541
00:23:26.921 --> 00:23:29.440
<v Speaker 2>the years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>champions that didn't really want to</v>

542
00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:30.970
<v Speaker 2>work on their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you get to the right way,</v>

543
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.790
<v Speaker 2>the right way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is sparring with everybody and not</v>

544
00:23:33.791 --> 00:23:36.100
<v Speaker 2>picking her up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sparring opponents and just jumping in</v>

545
00:23:36.101 --> 00:23:37.730
<v Speaker 2>into the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I know o'connor's good</v>

546
00:23:37.731 --> 00:23:40.150
<v Speaker 2>because connor does that and he's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get way better.</v>

547
00:23:40.151 --> 00:23:42.850
<v Speaker 2>He's actually good at Jujitsu is there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot better.</v>

548
00:23:42.851 --> 00:23:46.580
<v Speaker 2>But I think holly needs to have somehow,</v>

549
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.770
<v Speaker 1>somehow it needs to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how,</v>

550
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.340
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she needs to fall in love with Jujitsu</v>

551
00:23:51.341 --> 00:23:52.610
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

552
00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.150
<v Speaker 1>because I think that's where people</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

553
00:23:56.151 --> 00:23:59.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the spot we already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't really seen her on her back.</v>

554
00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:02.270
<v Speaker 1>We w we haven't seen her react to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu and now we have,</v>

555
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:07.100
<v Speaker 1>and Mischa just exposed her and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to get take that she needs to take</v>

556
00:24:07.101 --> 00:24:10.190
<v Speaker 1>care of that and fall in love with Jiu</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jitsu and started getting on Instagram,</v>

<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>

559
00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.930
<v Speaker 1>She's got to be really happy about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because um,</v>

560
00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:17.930
<v Speaker 1>she needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

561
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:19.520
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a hole right there and that's</v>

562
00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:20.630
<v Speaker 1>what people are going to try to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

563
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just not that hard to take down.</v>

564
00:24:22.191 --> 00:24:25.130
<v Speaker 1>After all I thought she'd be harder to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take down but you know me,</v>

565
00:24:25.131 --> 00:24:27.750
<v Speaker 1>she took her down for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She mixes up or take down times.</v>

566
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:28.680
<v Speaker 1>She goes at the time</v>

567
00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.060
<v Speaker 2>and she goes down low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's Rhonda is like upper body</v>

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:38.420
<v Speaker 2>holly had to do also Rhonda in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight was so insanely aggressive.</v>

570
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.680
<v Speaker 2>Her charging after made it so much</v>
<v Speaker 2>easier for counters me.</v>

571
00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:44.080
<v Speaker 2>She was super crafty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

572
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.280
<v Speaker 2>She liked very patient,</v>

573
00:24:46.281 --> 00:24:49.130
<v Speaker 2>varied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her movement varied or timing didn't do</v>

574
00:24:49.131 --> 00:24:51.950
<v Speaker 2>any like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she didn't continue any patterns</v>

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.090
<v Speaker 2>made holly come after her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>

579
00:25:02.091 --> 00:25:04.340
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a really good counter striker</v>

580
00:25:04.341 --> 00:25:06.980
<v Speaker 2>like holly is for her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best thing is a Rhonda,</v>

581
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:09.290
<v Speaker 2>like someone's gonna run at her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best thing is someone running</v>

582
00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.130
<v Speaker 2>addict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

583
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.610
<v Speaker 2>she's so fleet like her footwork.</v>

584
00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:16.160
<v Speaker 2>So excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She sold light on her feet that she's so</v>

585
00:25:16.161 --> 00:25:19.340
<v Speaker 2>good at just sliding out of the way and</v>
<v Speaker 2>cracking you while you coming in.</v>

586
00:25:19.341 --> 00:25:20.720
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of the things she's best</v>
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>

587
00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:25.730
<v Speaker 2>So if you fight that way against her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the kind of fight that happens.</v>

588
00:25:25.731 --> 00:25:27.020
<v Speaker 2>You look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she looks like a master,</v>

589
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.560
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at her fight in the very</v>
<v Speaker 2>first UFC fight,</v>

590
00:25:30.561 --> 00:25:33.100
<v Speaker 2>we were Raquel Pennington.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wants to split decision.</v>

591
00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:33.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

592
00:25:33.951 --> 00:25:36.320
<v Speaker 2>and that was a fight where were cal</v>
<v Speaker 2>fought more cautious,</v>

593
00:25:36.321 --> 00:25:37.340
<v Speaker 2>a little smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new,</v>

594
00:25:37.341 --> 00:25:40.370
<v Speaker 2>new holly's background coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

595
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:43.970
<v Speaker 2>if you don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't engage with her,</v>

596
00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:46.370
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember when Anderson was in his prime,</v>

597
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.190
<v Speaker 2>if guys came after him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just butchered him.</v>

598
00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.430
<v Speaker 2>But if guys hung back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes a fight was boring,</v>

599
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

600
00:25:53.841 --> 00:25:54.561
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talis,</v>

601
00:25:54.561 --> 00:25:55.920
<v Speaker 2>late tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember tonsillitis,</v>

602
00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:58.160
<v Speaker 2>like hung back and he kind of waited for</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson.</v>

603
00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing with Patrick [inaudible].</v>

604
00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.690
<v Speaker 2>Patrick [inaudible] hung back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just fought smart.</v>

605
00:26:02.691 --> 00:26:04.200
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to charge it and running into</v>

606
00:26:04.201 --> 00:26:04.791
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come,</v>

607
00:26:04.791 --> 00:26:06.140
<v Speaker 2>come get me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come get me.</v>

608
00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.310
<v Speaker 2>And [inaudible] like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

609
00:26:07.311 --> 00:26:10.430
<v Speaker 2>he's had a big right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everybody had to be real careful.</v>

610
00:26:10.431 --> 00:26:11.990
<v Speaker 2>You always had to be careful because a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

611
00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.120
<v Speaker 2>if you're coming at him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could always catch you.</v>

612
00:26:14.121 --> 00:26:17.750
<v Speaker 2>And if a guy like coattail catches you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just had that stupid power in his</v>

613
00:26:17.751 --> 00:26:18.650
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could just knocked.</v>

614
00:26:18.651 --> 00:26:21.140
<v Speaker 2>He knocked out Tito at two oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember that?</v>

615
00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.590
<v Speaker 2>He knocked him out down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knocked him down.</v>

616
00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.490
<v Speaker 2>Tito don't take a shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he knocked him down at two oh five</v>

617
00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.890
<v Speaker 2>and he fights at one 70 now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

618
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:32.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Patrick Code taken crack.</v>

619
00:26:32.721 --> 00:26:34.360
<v Speaker 2>So Anderson never want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember I,</v>

620
00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.980
<v Speaker 2>Patrick blew his knee out in that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

621
00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:38.220
<v Speaker 2>He like went to throw a kick and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>knee just gave out.</v>

622
00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.080
<v Speaker 2>It's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exploded.</v>

623
00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fought a very smart fight too.</v>

624
00:26:42.591 --> 00:26:46.290
<v Speaker 2>And that's that stain when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find a killer counterstrike or like</v>

625
00:26:46.291 --> 00:26:48.660
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big thing is like let them lead.</v>

626
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:50.160
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to lead.</v>

627
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Make it a boring fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let it be boring.</v>

628
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Move around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be patient.</v>

629
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:56.460
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she did everything right man.</v>

630
00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.740
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda.</v>

631
00:26:57.741 --> 00:26:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Me Three would be nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

632
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:00.750
<v Speaker 2>That's probably what it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

633
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.770
<v Speaker 2>It's probably what's gonna happen next</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to,</v>

634
00:27:02.771 --> 00:27:04.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I've led on the internets cause I</v>

635
00:27:04.921 --> 00:27:07.110
<v Speaker 2>was have here I wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what Rhonda would want,</v>

636
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:12.130
<v Speaker 2>would she want a</v>
<v Speaker 2>rematch with her after a loss or I would</v>

637
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:15.590
<v Speaker 2>title shot if I was her out was a tough</v>
<v Speaker 2>choice.</v>

638
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Rather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was her,</v>

639
00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:17.700
<v Speaker 2>I was her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd pure boy.</v>

640
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.140
<v Speaker 2>Tough choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

641
00:27:19.141 --> 00:27:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't be her.</v>

642
00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.380
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was her,</v>

643
00:27:22.381 --> 00:27:26.970
<v Speaker 2>honestly I would probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine if I was her,</v>

644
00:27:26.971 --> 00:27:31.971
<v Speaker 2>I'd want to avenge the loss cause holly</v>
<v Speaker 2>was her first loss and she doesn't feel</v>

645
00:27:32.101 --> 00:27:35.550
<v Speaker 2>like she did her best in that fight and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fight was just,</v>

646
00:27:35.551 --> 00:27:36.660
<v Speaker 2>she had too much going on.</v>

647
00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.490
<v Speaker 2>If you hear her talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like there was,</v>

648
00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.450
<v Speaker 2>she's overwhelmed with obligations and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and just fought wrong.</v>

649
00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.880
<v Speaker 2>Just didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't fight correctly,</v>

650
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:49.620
<v Speaker 2>just had real problems going into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have like her approach like</v>

651
00:27:49.621 --> 00:27:52.800
<v Speaker 2>getting in Holly's face the way in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>try and make it real emotional,</v>

652
00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:55.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fake ass bitch and all that stuff.</v>

653
00:27:55.321 --> 00:27:58.230
<v Speaker 2>And then all that emotions when she</v>
<v Speaker 2>fought in the ranks just running after</v>

654
00:27:58.231 --> 00:28:03.000
<v Speaker 2>holly and holly just fall like a master,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was one of the best performances</v>

655
00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:07.470
<v Speaker 2>you'll ever see of a striker and</v>
<v Speaker 2>negating a person to aggression.</v>

656
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:11.340
<v Speaker 2>Like she just did it so brilliantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Catching her with elbows coming in,</v>

657
00:28:11.341 --> 00:28:15.870
<v Speaker 2>catching it with straight lefts and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucking set up for the head kick</v>

658
00:28:15.871 --> 00:28:19.800
<v Speaker 2>when Rhonda is all stumbling and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>just catches her with that head kick.</v>

659
00:28:19.801 --> 00:28:24.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean just to spectacular mixed martial</v>
<v Speaker 2>arts performance overall,</v>

660
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:28.830
<v Speaker 2>like one of the best like title winning</v>
<v Speaker 2>efforts in any weight class as far as</v>

661
00:28:28.831 --> 00:28:32.060
<v Speaker 2>like a sheer domination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's right up there with Tj dillashaw</v>

662
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.330
<v Speaker 2>Hanan Barao one but more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably more scary.</v>

663
00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.880
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most spectacular</v>
<v Speaker 2>highlight clips ever.</v>

664
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:40.530
<v Speaker 2>She's getting clipped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

665
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.760
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

666
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:43.920
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like she's a bad ass,</v>

667
00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.080
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I think about holly is,</v>

668
00:28:46.081 --> 00:28:48.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holly get back on track and uh,</v>

669
00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.550
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really hope that she takes that advice</v>

670
00:28:50.551 --> 00:28:53.070
<v Speaker 2>that you just gave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that'd be real smart.</v>

671
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.830
<v Speaker 2>He's got to somehow fall in love with</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not fight it no more.</v>

672
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno if she fights it.</v>

673
00:28:57.211 --> 00:28:58.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the deal is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

674
00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:01.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's just so good at kickboxing.</v>

675
00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:02.543
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

676
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.950
<v Speaker 2>she just wants to stay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sharpen that.</v>

677
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.620
<v Speaker 2>And that's what she wants to do to girls</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she feels like she has this big</v>

678
00:29:07.621 --> 00:29:12.510
<v Speaker 2>advantage of them against them in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But obviously she needs a little work on</v>

679
00:29:12.511 --> 00:29:14.040
<v Speaker 2>it and I think she'll get better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

680
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:15.030
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she can,</v>

681
00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:16.980
<v Speaker 2>she could still improve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

682
00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.910
<v Speaker 2>and I think maybe there's also the</v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming pressure that must come</v>

683
00:29:20.911 --> 00:29:23.790
<v Speaker 2>from being a champ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that experience probably takes a</v>

684
00:29:23.791 --> 00:29:25.080
<v Speaker 2>while and they'll learn how to navigate</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

685
00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:27.210
<v Speaker 2>I hope I'm wrong and she's already in</v>
<v Speaker 2>love with it.</v>

686
00:29:27.211 --> 00:29:29.790
<v Speaker 2>That would be awesome if that was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm rooting for Holly.</v>

687
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:31.320
<v Speaker 2>I like holly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think holly,</v>

688
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.390
<v Speaker 2>could you not hallway with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

689
00:29:33.391 --> 00:29:35.460
<v Speaker 2>How could I not like it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just being real.</v>

690
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry if it hurts anybody's</v>
<v Speaker 2>feelings.</v>

691
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:37.750
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

692
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:39.090
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying is important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope,</v>
