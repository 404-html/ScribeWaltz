<v Speaker 1>Francisco to exist to be that far off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the left wing trail.</v>

<v Speaker 1>they're doing that already dumb.</v>

136
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.920
<v Speaker 1>They already have these remote control </v>
<v Speaker 1>cars and they drive around the city and </v>

137
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.740
<v Speaker 1>they drive themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They react to cars coming at them.</v>

138
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.400
<v Speaker 1>They haven't even been getting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>accidents.</v>

139
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:55.450
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking nuts and I still wouldn't </v>

140
00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.450
<v Speaker 1>trust it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

141
00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:55.820
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine sitting in the back </v>
<v Speaker 1>seat,</v>

142
00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.850
<v Speaker 1>but my car driving itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of fucking assholes out </v>

143
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:00.850
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom that drive cars.</v>

144
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:05.771
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of fucking assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw some kid the other day just </v>

145
00:07:05.771 --> 00:07:07.280
<v Speaker 1>weaving in and out of traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speeding.</v>

146
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:11.150
<v Speaker 1>He was flying past people in like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

147
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:16.010
<v Speaker 1>like arrested while he was in the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>place at the right time,</v>

148
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:21.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was doing the wrong thing at the </v>

149
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:21.550
<v Speaker 1>right time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no cops anywhere by him,</v>

150
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 1>but with the way he was driving was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>really crazy aggressive,</v>

151
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 1>like cutting people off and racing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of him.</v>

152
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.380
<v Speaker 1>It was dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was like,</v>

153
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.740
<v Speaker 1>he was cutting like random strangers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like off,</v>

154
00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:35.741
<v Speaker 1>like barely missing their car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of maniacal to walk like </v>

155
00:07:35.741 --> 00:07:36.980
<v Speaker 1>every now and then you just get a person</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

156
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:41.981
<v Speaker 1>It's just really crazy article about </v>
<v Speaker 1>teenagers that their brains aren't fully</v>

157
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:47.651
<v Speaker 1>developed and there's a reason to get in</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many accidents because their </v>

158
00:07:47.651 --> 00:07:49.100
<v Speaker 1>perception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reactions are good physically,</v>

159
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.130
<v Speaker 1>but they make wrong choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrible choices.</v>

160
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.100
<v Speaker 1>I was a terrible driver when I was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>

161
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.670
<v Speaker 1>terrible driver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now see me drive.</v>

162
00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:57.790
<v Speaker 1>Don't even watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could pull it off.</v>

163
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Would you be happy if Google came along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with something that you can say,</v>

164
00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:05.621
<v Speaker 1>take me home and the fucking robot call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's common mind mind.</v>

165
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.670
<v Speaker 1>If I open up a six pack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would definitely.</v>

166
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:09.890
<v Speaker 1>If you're drinking and driving and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>

167
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.140
<v Speaker 1>your car is driving itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you still get arrested?</v>

168
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.840
<v Speaker 1>If it's a very good question because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have to.</v>

169
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.510
<v Speaker 1>It would have to know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know where you're going,</v>

170
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:18.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

171
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.990
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't tell it to,</v>

172
00:08:20.991 --> 00:08:25.991
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go fucking driving the wrong lane of </v>

173
00:08:25.991 --> 00:08:25.991
<v Speaker 1>this street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

174
00:08:25.991 --> 00:08:27.140
<v Speaker 1>we would have to be some sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have to have a.</v>

175
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:31.130
<v Speaker 1>A thing that said it couldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there wouldn't to be.</v>

176
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.890
<v Speaker 1>How does it know when there's a light to</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn green?</v>

177
00:08:33.891 --> 00:08:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Has It?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>

178
00:08:34.551 --> 00:08:39.551
<v Speaker 1>there's a light turns red and it's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have to be plugged into the whole </v>

179
00:08:39.551 --> 00:08:40.700
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's going to be have to be,</v>

180
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really think about it,</v>

181
00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:47.621
<v Speaker 1>it's going to have to be like a wifi </v>
<v Speaker 1>network or something everywhere that </v>

182
00:08:47.621 --> 00:08:50.651
<v Speaker 1>controls these cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they would have to have real </v>

183
00:08:50.651 --> 00:08:53.381
<v Speaker 1>control to to let a car go and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive around with no person touching the</v>

184
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.480
<v Speaker 1>and make sure that it stays on path.</v>

185
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:03.050
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think that would be really hard </v>

186
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:03.050
<v Speaker 1>to trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

187
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:03.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you controlling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand what's.</v>

188
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.780
<v Speaker 1>How's it getting to it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to get there from the cell </v>

189
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:09.210
<v Speaker 1>phone has got to be some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>signal that's reaching the car.</v>

190
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Unless the car is just a robot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a self sufficient robot,</v>

191
00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:16.320
<v Speaker 1>which is even crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means no one is controlling it.</v>

192
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.740
<v Speaker 1>That means it just goes on what it knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what's in front of it with radar </v>

193
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:22.530
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's using sonar.</v>

194
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know when it's using who.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

195
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:28.950
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of nuts at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that happens,</v>

196
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:33.951
<v Speaker 1>that's an APP that you get the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>take download Merera home app and you </v>

197
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:37.350
<v Speaker 1>press that or your phone and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking car just drives you home.</v>

198
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Why is that so weird to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course that's coming,</v>

199
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

200
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Take me home while you hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all,</v>

201
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:43.980
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's coming.</v>

202
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.470
<v Speaker 1>It's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how technology has advanced</v>

203
00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:51.471
<v Speaker 1>so much in the last five years we had </v>
<v Speaker 1>panic attacks.</v>

204
00:09:52.201 --> 00:09:54.720
<v Speaker 1>If we forget our cell phone now I have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>panic attack.</v>

205
00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:56.820
<v Speaker 1>If I forgot my cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

206
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:01.050
<v Speaker 1>and you know it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so valuable for finding shit out.</v>

207
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:06.410
<v Speaker 1>It's so valuable for like going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>websites to read anymore because they </v>

208
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:07.980
<v Speaker 1>can get the answers at their fingertips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slept well.</v>

209
00:10:07.981 --> 00:10:12.981
<v Speaker 1>It's not that you don't have to read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but man information is flowing so much </v>

210
00:10:12.981 --> 00:10:16.611
<v Speaker 1>quicker now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you knew you had a question for </v>

211
00:10:16.611 --> 00:10:18.891
<v Speaker 1>Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be like a really hard thing to do </v>

212
00:10:18.891 --> 00:10:21.591
<v Speaker 1>to research the question and there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of people who developed some </v>

213
00:10:21.591 --> 00:10:24.801
<v Speaker 1>really good bullshit arguments back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>those days and the they don't hold up </v>

214
00:10:24.801 --> 00:10:25.650
<v Speaker 1>anymore because of Google.</v>

215
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Wikipedia is not necessarily always </v>
<v Speaker 1>right over here in the argument.</v>

216
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always a.</v>

217
00:10:30.871 --> 00:10:31.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>

218
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.840
<v Speaker 1>that's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People love to say that there's,</v>

219
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.150
<v Speaker 1>but there's always gonna be people </v>
<v Speaker 1>downplaying it,</v>

220
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.940
<v Speaker 1>but the bottom line is it's no one knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

221
00:10:38.941 --> 00:10:43.410
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible and you could find some </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more things because of this.</v>

222
00:10:43.411 --> 00:10:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is amazing.</v>

223
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.570
<v Speaker 1>This is a great time to be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is your phone.</v>

224
00:10:48.571 --> 00:10:51.390
<v Speaker 1>You fucking pick up your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you talk to him?</v>

225
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Tell him to go to websites for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

226
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:57.030
<v Speaker 1>this is where we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever used that google voice?</v>

227
00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He beat the shit.</v>

228
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.730
<v Speaker 1>You press it and you say dom irrera and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll go right to your website.</v>

229
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Pulls up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the one where you'd go call </v>

230

<v Speaker 1>called Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

00:21:21.791 --> 00:21:26.791
<v Speaker 1>but he was a at a Gig and Vermont once </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we would get,</v>

466
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:32.310
<v Speaker 1>we worked together up there and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he had a little bit of a problem </v>

467
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.220
<v Speaker 1>with his voice.</v>

468
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:37.720
<v Speaker 1>He had a little bit of a cold and so he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was saying to the,</v>

469
00:21:37.721 --> 00:21:38.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>

470
00:21:38.621 --> 00:21:39.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>owner of the club,</v>

471
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:42.790
<v Speaker 1>it was like apologizing for his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

472
00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:47.850
<v Speaker 1>his voice being a fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guy who owned the club said </v>

473
00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:51.350
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

474
00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:53.330
<v Speaker 1>what are you being a Jew or something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

475
00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:58.500
<v Speaker 1>something along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you sound like a Jew because he </v>

476
00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.710
<v Speaker 1>didn't think he was Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something along those lines.</v>

477
00:21:59.711 --> 00:22:01.390
<v Speaker 1>It was like really crude and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

478
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:05.680
<v Speaker 1>and Brian went fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went crazy.</v>

479
00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:10.820
<v Speaker 1>It was a desk between him and the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's probably the only thing that </v>

480
00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:14.641
<v Speaker 1>stopped him from smashing this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was so scary because he was like </v>

481
00:22:14.641 --> 00:22:17.070
<v Speaker 1>really fucking strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember thinking like,</v>

482
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.870
<v Speaker 1>because back then like I didn't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>lift weights,</v>

483
00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:24.900
<v Speaker 1>like I would die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never lifted weights to my window </v>

484
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:24.900
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

485
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty skinny in comparison.</v>

486
00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:27.700
<v Speaker 1>He was like way bigger than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

487
00:22:27.701 --> 00:22:32.701
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I can stop him from </v>

488
00:22:32.701 --> 00:22:32.701
<v Speaker 1>hurting this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

489
00:22:32.701 --> 00:22:33.920
<v Speaker 1>because he's just so much stronger than </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

490
00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:35.650
<v Speaker 1>He could just run right through them </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bowl.</v>

491
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.680
<v Speaker 1>But that one thing the guy said to him </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

492
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:40.480
<v Speaker 1>don't be a Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you being a Jew?</v>

493
00:22:40.481 --> 00:22:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I forget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it was,</v>

494
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.310
<v Speaker 1>but I remember like going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

495
00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:50.610
<v Speaker 1>like that's the moment where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to talk your friend at a doing </v>

496
00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:51.850
<v Speaker 1>something really stupid or the moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

497
00:22:51.851 --> 00:22:54.700
<v Speaker 1>I know how you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know how you feel and your right to be</v>

498
00:22:54.701 --> 00:22:56.710
<v Speaker 1>upset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but please don't do anything.</v>

499
00:22:56.711 --> 00:22:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Let's get the fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do something right now,</v>

500
00:22:59.741 --> 00:23:02.980
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a mistake and it's going to fuck up</v>

501
00:23:02.981 --> 00:23:03.580
<v Speaker 1>your freedom.</v>

502
00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:05.950
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get locked in a cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to do this.</v>

503
00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:11.370
<v Speaker 1>There's now civilized people do keep the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck away from people if you don't like </v>

504
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:11.830
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to beat him up.</v>

505
00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:13.900
<v Speaker 1>You know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gets weird.</v>

506
00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:18.920
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know when you get that look that you </v>

507
00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:18.920
<v Speaker 1>are thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't go into action.</v>

508
00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Remember one night we were drunk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids came up to the pool hall and one </v>

509
00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.580
<v Speaker 1>kid just fucking lit you up and I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at you at the.</v>

510
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:30.720
<v Speaker 1>I know he ain't going to lose it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this kid has no idea that fucking </v>

511
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:30.720
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

512
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.270
<v Speaker 1>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember what you're talking about.</v>

513
00:23:32.271 --> 00:23:34.510
<v Speaker 1>It's just drunk men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

514
00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:40.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean I couldn't imagine what it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a woman and deal with the drunk </v>

515
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:43.681
<v Speaker 1>man wanting to hold you down and fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>you in the same type of like you would </v>

516
00:23:43.841 --> 00:23:45.710
<v Speaker 1>just run into people that are just.</v>

517
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.290
<v Speaker 4>The name did not like that when they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>sober.</v>

518
00:23:48.291 --> 00:23:53.291
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean some people just have a problem </v>

519
00:23:53.291 --> 00:23:53.291
<v Speaker 4>with drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just get weird,</v>

520
00:23:53.291 --> 00:23:54.890
<v Speaker 4>but when you're around him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like aggressive drunk dudes.</v>

521
00:23:54.891 --> 00:23:56.570
<v Speaker 4>It's so unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

522
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.370
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a fucking predicament.</v>

523
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:03.910
<v Speaker 4>This has got to suck to be a check.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they start repeating themselves </v>

524
00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:03.910
<v Speaker 4>and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I always say,</v>

525
00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:05.300
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the law,</v>

526
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:10.780
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't bothers me a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at least it's not threatening like </v>

527
00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.570
<v Speaker 4>it as to a check.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really always think about that when I </v>

528
00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:14.180
<v Speaker 4>see those kind of really drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Douchey guys.</v>

529
00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:19.940
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna be a terrifying thing to have</v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy you know want to hold you down.</v>

530
00:24:20.901 --> 00:24:22.880
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

531
00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.030
<v Speaker 4>It's got to be awful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tell me the story.</v>

532
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:26.570
<v Speaker 4>Tell me the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's terrible.</v>

533
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:31.900
<v Speaker 4>I can't take it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My back's killing me when you were </v>

534
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:31.900
<v Speaker 4>saying that thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

535
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:33.140
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of fucked it that still </v>
<v Speaker 4>around,</v>

536
00:24:33.141 --> 00:24:33.590
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

537
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:34.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

538
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:37.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I with my God daughter living with me,</v>

539
00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.690
<v Speaker 4>I can't sleep unless she's home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

540
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:45.250
<v Speaker 4>And like honestly my Godson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's closed blood.</v>

541
00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.430
<v Speaker 4>If he got blown at a party by the kids' </v>
<v Speaker 4>mother through the Party,</v>

542
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:53.090
<v Speaker 4>I'd go dad that much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tell me about it and don't read it.</v>

543
00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.850
<v Speaker 4>Don't wrap the lady out here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know what I mean?</v>

544
00:24:55.851 --> 00:24:57.530
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so different with girls.</v>

545
00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.960
<v Speaker 4>It's totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's totally different.</v>

546
00:24:59.961 --> 00:25:02.850
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking of something you said </v>
<v Speaker 4>before about when he said he was,</v>

547
00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.960
<v Speaker 4>the guy was Jewish and he didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 4>how you're part of your culture,</v>

548
00:25:05.961 --> 00:25:08.510
<v Speaker 4>your party background.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was married to a Jewish woman,</v>

549
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.720
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I one day I said not meaning it in </v>

550
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.120
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just my own ignorance.</v>

551
00:25:14.121 --> 00:25:14.600
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

552
00:25:14.601 --> 00:25:16.550
<v Speaker 4>maybe we can do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can do the guy down.</v>

553
00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.410
<v Speaker 4>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really insulting.</v>

554
00:25:18.411 --> 00:25:19.970
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

555
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:22.610
<v Speaker 4>And she said she explained it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then I just start saying,</v>

556
00:25:22.611 --> 00:25:25.550
<v Speaker 4>let's Christian that motherfucker down </v>
<v Speaker 4>just to,</v>

557
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.500
<v Speaker 4>just to bring it back on myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's funny.</v>

558
00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:28.410
<v Speaker 4>&lt;Unk&gt; frazier</v>

559
00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:32.130
<v Speaker 1>got mad at me for using that expression </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that guy.</v>

560
00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

561
00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:34.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they get mad at me,</v>

562
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:35.460
<v Speaker 1>like threaten me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

563
00:25:35.461 --> 00:25:36.660
<v Speaker 1>we were friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's like,</v>

564
00:25:36.661 --> 00:25:41.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really a rude thing to say in </v>

565
00:25:41.661 --> 00:25:41.661
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was like,</v>

566
00:25:41.661 --> 00:25:41.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always said it.</v>

567
00:25:41.661 --> 00:25:43.080
<v Speaker 1>I never thought of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think of as a bad thing.</v>

568
00:25:43.081 --> 00:25:44.130
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

569
00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.560
<v Speaker 1>guys got gold chains on always Guinea </v>
<v Speaker 1>and ended up,</v>

570
00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.460
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

571
00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.710
<v Speaker 1>you want to get some money on jus the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy down it.</v>

572
00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.060
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think it was bad to be frugal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No know</v>

573
00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:58.470
<v Speaker 4>I never connected the two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never meant it as a set it.</v>

574
00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.150
<v Speaker 4>And then I saw that it was obvious once </v>
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

575
00:26:01.151 --> 00:26:01.720
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

576
00:26:01.721 --> 00:26:05.860
<v Speaker 4>I guess that is pretty insensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know that they,</v>

577
00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:10.920
<v Speaker 4>they got a guy today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>95 years old who was a Nazi at the one </v>

578
00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.720
<v Speaker 4>of the camps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>95 native rest of them.</v>

579
00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:17.030
<v Speaker 4>I think you think he's gonna get life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

675
00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:33.440
<v Speaker 4>And I think what it really boils down to</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that people have these weird natural </v>

676
00:30:33.791 --> 00:30:38.791
<v Speaker 4>tribal instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have these weird tribal instincts </v>

677
00:30:38.791 --> 00:30:42.421
<v Speaker 4>and they belong to a tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And whether that tribes being a </v>

678
00:30:42.421 --> 00:30:46.171
<v Speaker 4>republican or would that tribe is </v>

<v Speaker 4>wherever the fuck it is that they decide</v>

680
00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:50.170
<v Speaker 4>this is where they draw the line.</v>

681
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:52.990
<v Speaker 4>This is where they stand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a tribal thing.</v>

682
00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:54.200
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

683
00:30:54.201 --> 00:30:57.460
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird deviations of our need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>form groups,</v>

<v Speaker 4>thought about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it with comedians when a </v>

<v Speaker 1>I said the true sign,</v>

1021
00:45:16.981 --> 00:45:19.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't like a person so if I give them </v>
<v Speaker 1>a straight nice intro,</v>

1022
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.520
<v Speaker 1>if I'm being nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just give it.</v>

1023
00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.780
<v Speaker 1>That means I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time for.</v>

1024
00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:30.450
<v Speaker 1>And what people don't understand too </v>
<v Speaker 1>well if we bust each other's balls and </v>

1025
00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:31.620
<v Speaker 1>it's really like a pleasure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1027
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.990

<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1028
00:45:33.991 --> 00:45:36.180
<v Speaker 1>if I say some stupid shit about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we enjoy it.</v>

1029
00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we make each other laugh and some </v>

1030
00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:44.181
<v Speaker 1>people don't see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they see like two comics busting </v>

1031
00:45:44.181 --> 00:45:46.500
<v Speaker 1>his balls and they think like oh they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are asserting dominance and hurting each</v>

1032
00:45:46.501 --> 00:45:47.600
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1033
00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:50.940
<v Speaker 1>they're having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that they can do it to each</v>

1034
00:45:50.941 --> 00:45:52.230
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1035
00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:57.340
<v Speaker 1>and it's part of being a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The busting balls thing is a part of </v>

1036
00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:01.731
<v Speaker 1>being a competent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well when you said something a couple </v>

<v Speaker 4>Is that harder than it looks?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>

1158
00:51:30.381 --> 00:51:32.760
<v Speaker 4>Roll the dice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never brought anybody up after that.</v>

1159
00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:35.720
<v Speaker 4>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1160
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:39.200
<v Speaker 4>it's funny on Hart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>standup really is.</v>

1161
00:51:39.201 --> 00:51:41.120
<v Speaker 4>But then once you get good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how easy it is.</v>

1162
00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:43.760
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's easy because you can take your time</v>

1163
00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:48.850
<v Speaker 4>and you can think like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can literally think when you're </v>

1164
00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:49.400
<v Speaker 4>doing an act,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's wrote,</v>

1165
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:50.240
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1166
00:51:50.290 --> 00:51:51.080
<v Speaker 4>then you're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1167
00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:56.110
<v Speaker 4>if I lose my place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a place so I can't lose my </v>

1168
00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:59.561
<v Speaker 4>place because it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't care if you go off and </v>

1169
00:51:59.561 --> 00:51:59.561
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1170
00:51:59.561 --> 00:51:59.561
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1171
00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:04.750
<v Speaker 4>you gotta you gotTa always have things </v>
<v Speaker 4>to talk about.</v>

1172
00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:06.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I don't know if you don't have like,</v>

1173
00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:11.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't do the exact same act or not </v>

1174
00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:14.210
<v Speaker 4>even close and that makes it so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>easier because then you know,</v>

1175
00:52:14.211 --> 00:52:17.240
<v Speaker 4>you're a freak and that's when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's when I think it gets easy.</v>

1176
00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:19.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is when it gets easier.</v>

1177
00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:22.010
<v Speaker 4>That's why I hate doing the tonight show</v>
<v Speaker 4>and shit like that.</v>

1178
00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:24.920
<v Speaker 4>When they have it scripted of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to say.</v>

1179
00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:28.610
<v Speaker 4>It takes all the fun and spontaneity </v>
<v Speaker 4>away from what's really unfortunate that</v>

1180
00:52:28.611 --> 00:52:31.790
<v Speaker 4>that's still the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those little seven minute conversations.</v>

1181
00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:33.250
<v Speaker 4>Hardest thing I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1182
00:52:33.251 --> 00:52:35.360
<v Speaker 4>Especially because you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing it with a stranger,</v>

1183
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:36.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if they're,</v>

1184
00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:42.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's the closest to who you're friends </v>

1185
00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:42.170
<v Speaker 4>with at all those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Craig Ferguson.</v>

1186
00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:43.950
<v Speaker 4>You mean calling in?</v>

1187
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:45.430
<v Speaker 4>Do you do Conan?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1188
00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:50.120
<v Speaker 4>I do Craig and failing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like even though you see those guys,</v>

1189
00:52:50.121 --> 00:52:50.530
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1190
00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:53.840
<v Speaker 4>maybe every now and again I really liked</v>
<v Speaker 4>buddies with them.</v>

1191
00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.840
<v Speaker 4>It's not like no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sit Down with them and be yourself.</v>

1192
00:52:56.860 --> 00:53:01.860
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I gotta say the thing about </v>

1193
00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:03.041
<v Speaker 4>Ferguson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he never gets to a question and all the </v>

1194
00:53:03.041 --> 00:53:04.070
<v Speaker 4>times I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done a show probably eight times,</v>

1195
00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:09.550
<v Speaker 4>never gets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They asked the head of the preinterview </v>

1196
00:53:09.550 --> 00:53:12.251
<v Speaker 4>and the producers called the segment </v>
<v Speaker 4>producers and they're so worried about </v>

1197
00:53:12.251 --> 00:53:12.251
<v Speaker 4>what you're gonna say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1198
00:53:12.251 --> 00:53:14.210
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't know much about baseball but </v>
<v Speaker 4>he knows about the football and.</v>

1199
00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:15.200
<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alright.</v>

1200
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:18.140
<v Speaker 4>And then never gets to a fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1201
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:23.530
<v Speaker 4>I had one of my most fun moments ever on</v>
<v Speaker 4>television on his show because he asked </v>

1202
00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:24.830
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he plugged the date,</v>

1203
00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:27.630
<v Speaker 4>my denver comedy works and I had already</v>
<v Speaker 4>done it.</v>

1204
00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:32.930
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you've got to really crack staff </v>

1205
00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:32.930
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1206
00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:35.481
<v Speaker 4>I've gotten so hot they have to post,</v>
<v Speaker 4>plug my dates because there'd be a riot </v>

1207
00:53:35.481 --> 00:53:36.600
<v Speaker 4>if they all knew I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1208
00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:38.880
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then he says to me from his desk,</v>

1209
00:53:38.881 --> 00:53:39.780
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll start over.</v>

1210
00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:42.840
<v Speaker 4>I go and starting over and he walks </v>
<v Speaker 4>over.</v>

1211
00:53:42.841 --> 00:53:43.290
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1212
00:53:43.291 --> 00:53:45.780
<v Speaker 4>I got a spot at the lift factory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to get to.</v>

1213
00:53:45.781 --> 00:53:46.210
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1214
00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:47.080
<v Speaker 4>I'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1215
00:53:47.250 --> 00:53:50.040
<v Speaker 4>I'll do my little monkey dance for you </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'll come over and talk to you,</v>

1216
00:53:50.041 --> 00:53:52.590
<v Speaker 4>but I ain't starting over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we had like a fake fight,</v>

1217
00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:55.170
<v Speaker 4>but it was great because the audience </v>
<v Speaker 4>knew it was real,</v>

1218
00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.840
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I went over to the panel and we</v>

1219
00:53:57.841 --> 00:53:58.520
<v Speaker 4>just fucked around.</v>

1220
00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:00.570
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1221
00:54:00.571 --> 00:54:03.750
<v Speaker 1>he's a funny guy and he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He apparently does a lot of standup too,</v>

1222
00:54:03.751 --> 00:54:04.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of standup.</v>

1223
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Does a lot of road gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's been places that I've </v>

1224
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.190
<v Speaker 1>been where I just said he was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1225
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.680
<v Speaker 1>It was going there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1226
00:54:10.681 --> 00:54:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Good for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1227
00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:12.500
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1228
00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:17.560
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see him even more and </v>

1229
00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:17.560
<v Speaker 1>uncensored format for hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1230
00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:19.650
<v Speaker 1>descending guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only worked with him once.</v>

1231
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:21.660
<v Speaker 1>He in Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1232
00:54:21.661 --> 00:54:23.700
<v Speaker 1>when I really became a fan of hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1233
00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:26.550
<v Speaker 1>when he was talking about pretty spirits</v>
<v Speaker 1>to remember that.</v>

1234
00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:30.360
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did he say it was,</v>

1235
00:54:30.361 --> 00:54:35.361
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to paraphrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was right around the time when </v>

1236
00:54:35.361 --> 00:54:37.320
<v Speaker 1>she kept running into all these problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was obviously something wrong.</v>

1237
00:54:37.321 --> 00:54:39.900
<v Speaker 1>The truth is fucking tailspin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

1238
00:54:39.901 --> 00:54:41.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1239
00:54:41.350 --> 00:54:44.520
<v Speaker 1>he basically was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does everybody care about this?</v>

1240
00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Like you're talking about a little girl </v>
<v Speaker 1>who needs help,</v>

1241
00:54:47.281 --> 00:54:49.480
<v Speaker 1>like a young girl who needs help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

1242
00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:51.320
<v Speaker 1>it was of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean said little girl,</v>

1243
00:54:51.321 --> 00:54:52.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young lady who needs help.</v>

1244
00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:54.860
<v Speaker 1>And it was really kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1245
00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:57.300
<v Speaker 1>it was refreshing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like he was,</v>

1246
00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:00.600
<v Speaker 1>this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could tell wasn't something that was</v>

1247
00:55:00.601 --> 00:55:05.601
<v Speaker 1>like he was posturing and he was making </v>
<v Speaker 1>an attempt at saying this because he </v>

1248
00:55:07.741 --> 00:55:09.810
<v Speaker 1>just wanted to achieve some moral high </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

1249
00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:14.190
<v Speaker 1>It was a real like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it felt like he has a voice,</v>

1250
00:55:14.191 --> 00:55:16.980
<v Speaker 1>he's on television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see if I can just get this message</v>

1251
00:55:16.981 --> 00:55:18.540
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was so right.</v>

1252
00:55:18.541 --> 00:55:20.970
<v Speaker 1>It was because it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is everybody freaking out about this</v>

1253
00:55:20.971 --> 00:55:25.971
<v Speaker 1>young lady who obviously does have </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems when we're in the middle of </v>

1254
00:55:25.971 --> 00:55:29.250
<v Speaker 1>fucking two different wars and who knows</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else is going on in the world?</v>

1255
00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what the fuck else is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on?</v>

1256
00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:35.310
<v Speaker 1>It was like little Lindsay Lohan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's like she makes the news,</v>

1257
00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:38.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so weird with that man.</v>

1258
00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:43.880
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like to somebody that will knock them </v>

1259
00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:47.001
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird to fixate on individuals </v>

1260
00:55:47.001 --> 00:55:47.820
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird that.</v>

1261
00:55:47.821 --> 00:55:52.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd definitely like to build them up </v>

1262
00:55:52.821 --> 00:55:52.821
<v Speaker 1>and knock them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that,</v>

1263
00:55:52.821 --> 00:55:55.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's weird how people just get </v>
<v Speaker 1>locked into that.</v>

1264
00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1265
00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:03.080
<v Speaker 1>what's Lindsay Lohan up to now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like once she becomes like this </v>

1266
00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.400
<v Speaker 1>side show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just.</v>

1267
00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:06.100
<v Speaker 1>There's a market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It she,</v>

1268
00:56:06.101 --> 00:56:11.101
<v Speaker 1>because it's almost like she becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>infected with fame then that fame but </v>

1269
00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:16.130
<v Speaker 1>fucking sucks onto her and she needs it </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorted to give her money and they need </v>

1270
00:56:16.801 --> 00:56:20.580
<v Speaker 1>her and people like her to fuel the </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1271
00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:22.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little publicity machine.</v>

1272
00:56:22.861 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating stuff</v>

1273
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:26.470
<v Speaker 4>because they also have an incestuous </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship.</v>

1274
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:28.600
<v Speaker 4>A lot of times some of these </v>
<v Speaker 4>celebrities,</v>

1275
00:56:28.601 --> 00:56:31.540
<v Speaker 4>they actually choose to get their photos</v>
<v Speaker 4>taken,</v>

1276
00:56:31.541 --> 00:56:34.250
<v Speaker 4>the sure they asked to set things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

1277
00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:37.780
<v Speaker 4>And their publicists set things up with </v>
<v Speaker 4>to keep them in the,</v>

1278
00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:40.220
<v Speaker 4>in the chatter we have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fascinating.</v>

1279
00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:45.240
<v Speaker 4>We had Justin Bieber at the laugh </v>
<v Speaker 4>factory one night and I knew he was up </v>

1280
00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:45.400
<v Speaker 4>there and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he even said a couple of things to me.</v>

1281
00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:49.030
<v Speaker 4>I was hosting a really cute little chick</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he goes out with her,</v>

1282
00:56:49.031 --> 00:56:52.010
<v Speaker 4>forget she's a singer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's Selena Gomez.</v>

1283
00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:53.900
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sad.</v>

1284
00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.690
<v Speaker 4>I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do beautiful.</v>

1285
00:56:55.691 --> 00:56:57.700
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1286
00:56:57.701 --> 00:56:59.240
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

1287
00:56:59.241 --> 00:57:02.890
<v Speaker 4>his manager came up to Jamie to ask me </v>
<v Speaker 4>to mention that he was there.</v>

1288
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:05.370
<v Speaker 4>I thought that was so unusual because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1289
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:08.070
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times like say Sean Penn comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1290
00:57:08.071 --> 00:57:09.760
<v Speaker 4>it just wears a baseball cap down.</v>

1291
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:10.780
<v Speaker 4>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not a word,</v>

1292
00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:13.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and his kid one,</v>

1293
00:57:13.151 --> 00:57:14.050
<v Speaker 4>the detention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking,</v>

1294
00:57:14.051 --> 00:57:19.051
<v Speaker 4>how much fucking attention do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like one of the most famous famous 16 </v>

1295
00:57:19.291 --> 00:57:20.710
<v Speaker 4>year olds ever.</v>

00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:28.410
<v Speaker 4>like I get a hand for him really well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's probably,</v>

1300
00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:30.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's this thing gets a kick out of doing</v>

1301
00:57:30.761 --> 00:57:35.761
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can just show up places and people </v>

1302
00:57:35.761 --> 00:57:35.761
<v Speaker 4>cheer him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet he could like do that.</v>

1303
00:57:35.761 --> 00:57:37.750
<v Speaker 4>Just show up at a restaurant.</v>

1305
00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:49.530
<v Speaker 4>movie stars and didn't give a fuck about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy who's laying in the alley start,</v>

<v Speaker 4>better than most people would.</v>

1308
00:57:55.330 --> 00:57:56.470
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty unusual.</v>

01:01:14.511 --> 01:01:17.330
<v Speaker 1>The Bernie madoff thing was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

1386
01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:22.460
<v Speaker 1>you know what that showed that showed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is a crazy system because if </v>

1387
01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:25.700
<v Speaker 1>you guys didn't know he was cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it possible?</v>

1388
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:28.510
<v Speaker 1>How is it possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I know where Ms Scheme and there</v>

1389
01:01:28.511 --> 01:01:30.370
<v Speaker 1>are people still collecting money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they were.</v>

1390
01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:32.120
<v Speaker 1>They were teased but constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1391
01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:35.720
<v Speaker 1>they weren't just teased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They benefited and profited immensely.</v>

1392
01:01:35.721 --> 01:01:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Some of them made big profits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's other ones that lost so much</v>

1393
01:01:40.611 --> 01:01:42.020
<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1394
01:01:42.110 --> 01:01:45.440
<v Speaker 1>that guy just went baller on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody just had everybody's money.</v>

1395
01:01:45.441 --> 01:01:48.170
<v Speaker 1>I'll tuck that away and just squirreled </v>
<v Speaker 1>it off.</v>

1396
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Crazy fucking sociopathic asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just.</v>

1397
01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:55.970
<v Speaker 1>What are they trying to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was handed a bad guy.</v>

1398
01:01:55.971 --> 01:01:59.030
<v Speaker 1>He's just a victim of circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably a psychopath,</v>

1399
01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:02.300
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that it's possible for God </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that,</v>

1400
01:02:02.301 --> 01:02:07.301
<v Speaker 1>that was so disheartening for me because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that it was more complicated </v>

1401
01:02:07.301 --> 01:02:10.040
<v Speaker 1>and I thought it was more secure than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I saw that had to do with degree to</v>

1402
01:02:10.041 --> 01:02:12.210
<v Speaker 1>the people to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of wanting to be quick,</v>

1403
01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:15.110
<v Speaker 1>quickly rich or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these are people that,</v>

1404
01:02:15.111 --> 01:02:15.900
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the guy,</v>

1405
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:18.110
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people that I care about</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1406
01:02:18.111 --> 01:02:21.470
<v Speaker 1>but they readily admit they were looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a quick buck.</v>

1407
01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

1408
01:02:22.441 --> 01:02:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what he was promising.</v>

1409
01:02:23.791 --> 01:02:28.791
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's promising big returns to a lot </v>

1410
01:02:28.791 --> 01:02:28.791
<v Speaker 1>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1411
01:02:28.791 --> 01:02:29.400
<v Speaker 1>It's just a shocking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Equity,</v>

1412
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:31.430
<v Speaker 1>how much money he was handling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1413
01:02:31.450 --> 01:02:32.870
<v Speaker 1>It's really shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1414
01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:38.030
<v Speaker 1>And then the wife's trying squirrel </v>
<v Speaker 1>something away and disappear into the </v>

1415
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:41.270
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the husband's locked up in jail for </v>

1416
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:41.270
<v Speaker 1>the rest of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did one of his sons commit suicide?</v>

1417
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:41.640
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1418
01:02:41.641 --> 01:02:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ it tough shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't just changed his name.</v>

1419
01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should have just changed his name.</v>

1420
01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.560
<v Speaker 1>His son made of A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was even that,</v>

1421
01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:55.110
<v Speaker 1>that sun just realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1422
01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

1423
01:02:57.050 --> 01:03:00.620
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're a young man and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1424
01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>probably grow up thinking that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>family is doing really well because your</v>

1425
01:03:06.801 --> 01:03:11.801
<v Speaker 1>father is a hardworking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart man and then he brings you into </v>

1426
01:03:11.801 --> 01:03:15.521
<v Speaker 1>the business and then somewhere along </v>
<v Speaker 1>the line they probably had figured out </v>

1427
01:03:15.521 --> 01:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>somewhere along the line if they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know from the jump and then the guy </v>

1428
01:03:19.810 --> 01:03:20.210
<v Speaker 1>couldn't take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1429
01:03:20.211 --> 01:03:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Or who knows the pressure pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1430
01:03:22.810 --> 01:03:27.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talked about like billions,</v>

1431
01:03:27.350 --> 01:03:27.680
<v Speaker 1>billions and billions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1432
01:03:28.550 --> 01:03:33.550
<v Speaker 1>What was the number was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was definitely in the billions that </v>

1433
01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:34.160
<v Speaker 1>I've heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a known fact.</v>

1434
01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

1435
01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:39.440
<v Speaker 1>It's a known fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so no fact.</v>

1436
01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:44.120
<v Speaker 1>This fucking guy lost more money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm smelling bit ski.</v>

1437
01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:49.610
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there will tell you what Eddie Murphy </v>

1438
01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:53.051
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Griffin was saying after nine </v>

1439
01:03:53.051 --> 01:03:55.271
<v Speaker 1>slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people don't even know that</v>

1440
01:03:56.541 --> 01:04:01.541
<v Speaker 1>they still are gold under the World </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trade Center and the subways kept </v>

1441
01:04:02.481 --> 01:04:04.370
<v Speaker 1>running 24 hours a day.</v>

1442
01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:07.260
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1443
01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:10.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1444
01:04:10.101 --> 01:04:13.820
<v Speaker 1>he would get high and just crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1445
01:04:13.821 --> 01:04:18.821
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he actually thinks he's like a genius </v>

1446
01:04:18.821 --> 01:04:21.220
<v Speaker 1>and I heard him one night at the store </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then who's going to argue with this </v>

1447
01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:21.590
<v Speaker 1>bit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1448
01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:27.070
<v Speaker 1>we got to stop giving our kids and </v>
<v Speaker 1>compton guns and knives and educated </v>

1449
01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:27.260
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1450
01:04:27.261 --> 01:04:28.760
<v Speaker 1>who gives the kids a gun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He come here,</v>

1451
01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:29.840
<v Speaker 1>Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny,</v>

1452
01:04:29.841 --> 01:04:31.490
<v Speaker 1>I want you to have a gun and a knife </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1453
01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to school.</v>

1454
01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:35.510
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to start educating them,</v>

1455
01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:40.570
<v Speaker 1>given pencils and papers and books like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck is not going to agree to </v>

1456
01:04:40.570 --> 01:04:42.890
<v Speaker 1>educate kids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they need education.</v>

1457
01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:48.040
<v Speaker 1>They need guns and knives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Griffin definitely had some crazy </v>

1458
01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:51.401
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen Eddie Griffin fucking </v>

1459
01:04:51.401 --> 01:04:54.641
<v Speaker 1>destroy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw him in his prime when he did his </v>

1460
01:04:54.641 --> 01:04:57.560
<v Speaker 1>first comedy special.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was short set,</v>

1461
01:04:57.561 --> 01:04:58.270
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

1462
01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:01.140
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it was a half an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might've been even less.</v>

1463
01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.930
<v Speaker 1>A lot of confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>

1464
01:05:02.931 --> 01:05:05.360
<v Speaker 1>he crushed down around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fucking crushed.</v>

1465
01:05:05.361 --> 01:05:08.210
<v Speaker 1>He crushed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was scary talent.</v>

1466
01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:11.090
<v Speaker 1>It was a scary level of talent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And energy that he put out.</v>

1467
01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:13.280
<v Speaker 1>And I remember watching him going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1468
01:05:13.281 --> 01:05:16.810
<v Speaker 1>that guy is fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking that.</v>

1469
01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's got a lot of power in his </v>

1470
01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:21.820
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1471
01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:21.820
<v Speaker 1>it's actually scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like boom.</v>

1472
01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:24.610
<v Speaker 1>It was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So dynamic.</v>

1473
01:05:24.611 --> 01:05:25.740
<v Speaker 1>The way he moved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1474
01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:29.230
<v Speaker 1>the way pause expressed himself and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1475
01:05:29.231 --> 01:05:34.231
<v Speaker 1>he had like moments like that that make </v>
<v Speaker 1>me think like a fat guy just really </v>

1476
01:05:34.231 --> 01:05:39.031
<v Speaker 1>dedicated himself to nothing but stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and really went legit and went down </v>

1477
01:05:39.701 --> 01:05:44.701
<v Speaker 1>the path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had moments if you could recapture </v>

1478
01:05:44.701 --> 01:05:44.701
<v Speaker 1>those moments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1479
01:05:44.701 --> 01:05:45.690

<v Speaker 1>I think he had some mental issues to,</v>

1480
01:05:47.330 --> 01:05:50.080
<v Speaker 1>with the fucking busy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's a known fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1482

<v Speaker 1>standup comedian fellows.</v>

1490
01:06:12.431 --> 01:06:16.150

<v Speaker 1>in the bushes outside waiting to fucking</v>

1491

1492
01:06:21.151 --> 01:06:21.520
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know that he has a funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want a warm guy too.</v>

<v Speaker 1>very friendly guy.</v>

1498
01:06:38.170 --> 01:06:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Part of his deal when he goes to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy club is yes to brand new </v>

1499
01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:43.170
<v Speaker 1>sneakers.</v>

1500
01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.120
<v Speaker 1>You ever hear this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1501
01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.890
<v Speaker 1>I've heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard things like this.</v>

1502
01:06:47.891 --> 01:06:52.891
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know it was him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether they're adidas or </v>

1503
01:06:52.891 --> 01:06:57.810
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big company and he has to have a </v>

1504
01:06:57.810 --> 01:06:57.810
<v Speaker 1>brand new pair of white Michael Jordans </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

1505
01:06:57.810 --> 01:06:58.900
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Nike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nike,</v>

1506
01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:03.400
<v Speaker 1>but a fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The man that guy goes,</v>

1507
01:07:03.610 --> 01:07:07.000
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't fucking find them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you write to where,</v>

1508
01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:12.180
<v Speaker 1>if you have a thing where you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wear a brand new sneakers right as you </v>

1509
01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:13.300
<v Speaker 1>walk on stage and that keeps you like </v>
<v Speaker 1>super power,</v>

1510
01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:18.430
<v Speaker 1>that might sound ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you were a young guy and you grew</v>

1511
01:07:18.431 --> 01:07:22.060
<v Speaker 1>up poor when you got a new pair of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sneakers,</v>

1512
01:07:22.061 --> 01:07:27.061
<v Speaker 1>that was like a really exciting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it could be that by not wearing the </v>

1513
01:07:27.061 --> 01:07:29.710
<v Speaker 1>sneakers until he goes on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he liked,</v>

1514
01:07:29.711 --> 01:07:34.711
<v Speaker 1>he liked a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes them feel like with new sneakers </v>

1515
01:07:34.711 --> 01:07:36.961
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it gives them a little extra power </v>

1516
01:07:36.961 --> 01:07:38.670
<v Speaker 1>and it sounds ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember when I was a kid getting </v>

1517
01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:39.040
<v Speaker 1>a new pair of sneakers was like a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>

1518
01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.720
<v Speaker 1>So maybe for him he like kept that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition Joe.</v>

1519
01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:45.070
<v Speaker 1>And it's easier for him if they buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you buy it?</v>

1520
01:07:45.071 --> 01:07:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Because I want to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1521
01:07:46.001 --> 01:07:48.640
<v Speaker 1>right before I go on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked you before it came on the show.</v>

1522
01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Not to be insightful and intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to have any compassion for people.</v>

1523
01:07:53.951 --> 01:07:55.450
<v Speaker 1>And there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

1524
01:07:55.451 --> 01:08:00.451
<v Speaker 1>That's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to have as much compassion for </v>

1525
01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:00.451
<v Speaker 1>people as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even people in the wrap,</v>

1526
01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:00.520
<v Speaker 1>our pool game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dom Irrera,</v>

1527
01:08:01.170 --> 01:08:05.230
<v Speaker 1>people that interrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you fucking serious here</v>

1528
01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.730
<v Speaker 1>dot Merera and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we,</v>

1529
01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:09.670
<v Speaker 1>when we play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we occasionally will joke around,</v>

1530
01:08:09.671 --> 01:08:14.671
<v Speaker 1>but John Plays very good pool and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played pretty good pool and we have </v>

1531
01:08:14.671 --> 01:08:16.330
<v Speaker 1>some fun battles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really fun to get excited.</v>

1532
01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:18.950
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we play more than pretty good not to get</v>

1533
01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:23.980
<v Speaker 1>the same a b player.</v>

1534
01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Now you're consistent like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a regular person.</v>

1535
01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:30.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm an a player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for a regular pool player,</v>

1536
01:08:30.681 --> 01:08:33.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm a b player.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't have enough time.</v>

1537
01:08:33.261 --> 01:08:35.360
<v Speaker 1>While you're more than an a player for </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular person.</v>

1538
01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:36.040
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1539
01:08:36.041 --> 01:08:37.580

<v Speaker 1>It's done on a regular people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played a lot of pull in my life.</v>

1543
01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:51.940
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny when I'm not playing </v>

1544
01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:51.940
<v Speaker 1>against you because I get a chance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot more.</v>

1545
01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:52.530
<v Speaker 1>I play better.</v>

<v Speaker 1>table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can run some packages,</v>

1548
01:08:58.521 --> 01:09:00.920

1572
01:10:02.770 --> 01:10:05.810
<v Speaker 1>A club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first place we went to.</v>

1573
01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.790
<v Speaker 1>That place was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was great.</v>

1574
01:10:07.791 --> 01:10:12.791
<v Speaker 1>That was a a former athletic club and </v>
<v Speaker 1>converted into this giant pool because </v>

1575
01:10:12.861 --> 01:10:17.861
<v Speaker 1>they had the track upstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to play on a Saturday tournament </v>

<v Speaker 1>I made good friends there.</v>

1579
01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:27.170
<v Speaker 1>That Saturday born into the tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was when I first moved here.</v>

1580
01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:32.800
<v Speaker 1>That was a great place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember they had the like the track </v>

1581
01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:32.800
<v Speaker 1>along the top event?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1582
01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:36.971

<v Speaker 1>We took the girls to be and she wasn't </v>

1583
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:38.210
<v Speaker 1>named Jerry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1584
01:10:39.170 --> 01:10:41.290
<v Speaker 1>I only remember it because she was hot </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that said,</v>

1585
01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:42.170
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1587
01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:48.830
<v Speaker 1>pool was a great thing.</v>

1588
01:10:49.050 --> 01:10:54.050
<v Speaker 1>A date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except if a chick beats you check </v>

1589
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:55.520

<v Speaker 1>Very depressing pool,</v>

1590
01:10:55.730 --> 01:10:58.250
<v Speaker 1>but there's a thing about a girl beaten </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet pool.</v>

1591
01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:01.490
<v Speaker 1>That's demoralizing for some dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny to watch.</v>

1592
01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:04.640
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will you shoot my girlfriend because she</v>

1593
01:11:04.641 --> 01:11:08.840
<v Speaker 1>was practicing a lot and she said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to kick your ass.</v>

<v Speaker 1>about fits in.</v>

1601
01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:30.720
<v Speaker 1>And I ran the table and I go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Swimming and kick her ass and pools and </v>

1613
01:11:54.450 --> 01:11:56.580
<v Speaker 1>who kicks your ass and be like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Allison Fisher woman,</v>

1614
01:11:56.581 --> 01:11:57.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she has.</v>

1615
01:11:57.570 --> 01:11:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Of course she would kicked my ass for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

1616
01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:00.840
<v Speaker 1>Easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She kicked my ass.</v>

1617
01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's way better than me.</v>

1618
01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Who's the big blue is like a snicker </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion and she.</v>

1619
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.760
<v Speaker 1>She came over from Europe and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominated woman's pool.</v>

1620
01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:09.880
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the.</v>

1621
01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:11.940
<v Speaker 1>That's the real problem with pools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>popularity.</v>

1622
01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:17.330
<v Speaker 1>This woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allison Fisher is probably the most </v>

1623
01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:20.031
<v Speaker 1>dominant sports person ever in any sport</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any game in women's gender issue and </v>

1624
01:12:21.391 --> 01:12:24.510
<v Speaker 1>it's not like there's only a few women </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing women's billiards.</v>

1625
01:12:24.511 --> 01:12:26.340
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of really good players.</v>

1626
01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:27.070
<v Speaker 1>There was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1627
01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:30.330
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows genetically drag because</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's a beautiful,</v>

1628
01:12:30.331 --> 01:12:35.331
<v Speaker 1>beautiful Asian woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's like a whole gang of like </v>

1629
01:12:35.331 --> 01:12:38.880
<v Speaker 1>top pros that would tour around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country and this woman consistently beat</v>

1630
01:12:38.881 --> 01:12:42.360
<v Speaker 1>all of them on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like player of the year,</v>

1631
01:12:42.361 --> 01:12:43.980
<v Speaker 1>like who knows how many fucking years in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a row.</v>

1632
01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:49.340
<v Speaker 1>She won the US Open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows how many years in a row or </v>

1633
01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:49.340
<v Speaker 1>whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the US Open,</v>

1634
01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:50.520
<v Speaker 1>whatever the W,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pba,</v>

1635
01:12:50.850 --> 01:12:53.520
<v Speaker 1>whatever their version of like their </v>
<v Speaker 1>national championship.</v>

1636
01:12:53.521 --> 01:12:56.910
<v Speaker 1>She would win every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are men better than women?</v>

1637
01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:58.290
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make much sense,</v>

1638
01:12:58.291 --> 01:13:00.390
<v Speaker 1>but any sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a coordination thing.</v>

1639
01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:02.640
<v Speaker 1>It isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't immunity.</v>

1640
01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.800
<v Speaker 1>It can be overcome like women like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Allison Fisher,</v>

1641
01:13:04.801 --> 01:13:07.770
<v Speaker 1>she could beat a man playing pool cue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she.</v>

1642
01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.690
<v Speaker 1>She wouldn't be at the top pros most </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely not in him.</v>

1643
01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:15.390
<v Speaker 1>It's just a few issues with spatial </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

1644
01:13:15.630 --> 01:13:20.630
<v Speaker 1>There's something to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is like really theoretical </v>

1645
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:24.441
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think something to the way the male </v>

1646
01:13:24.441 --> 01:13:25.800
<v Speaker 1>mind interprets three d space that it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1647
01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:30.801
<v Speaker 1>it's beneficial for certain things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pool might be one of them because after </v>

1648
01:13:31.021 --> 01:13:34.200
<v Speaker 1>the break pool doesn't really rely on </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength.</v>

1649
01:13:34.290 --> 01:13:39.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the average woman could easily a </v>

1650
01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:40.290
<v Speaker 1>stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ball about as hard as you need to,</v>

1651
01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:43.140
<v Speaker 1>you really don't ever need to hit it </v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard outside of the brake.</v>

1652
01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:49.010
<v Speaker 1>The brake shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in rotation games or eight </v>

1653
01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:51.441
<v Speaker 1>ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a big issue because if a guy </v>

1654
01:13:51.441 --> 01:13:51.720
<v Speaker 1>can really smash the rack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can make like sometimes you break and</v>

1655
01:13:51.721 --> 01:13:54.230
<v Speaker 1>you make like four balls on the brake </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1656
01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:59.270
<v Speaker 1>There's that Guy Shane van boning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a fascinating character because </v>

1657
01:13:59.270 --> 01:14:01.770
<v Speaker 1>he's the best one of the best pool </v>
<v Speaker 1>player in America.</v>

1658
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:03.710
<v Speaker 1>One of the best players in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1659
01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:08.720
<v Speaker 1>and he's deaf and when he plays he shuts</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hearing aid off and it's not good </v>

1660
01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:11.160
<v Speaker 1>because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it is an added element.</v>

1661
01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:12.880
<v Speaker 1>It's good because he's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

1662
01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:15.730
<v Speaker 1>He practices relentlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy's like super dedicated.</v>

1663
01:14:15.731 --> 01:14:18.490
<v Speaker 1>He's good because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's also got this added element.</v>

1664
01:14:18.850 --> 01:14:22.420
<v Speaker 1>We can shut that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The heat on here.</v>

1665
01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't hear anything.</v>

1666
01:14:23.861 --> 01:14:27.060
<v Speaker 1>So when he's in pro tournaments he goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>into this zone.</v>

1667
01:14:27.370 --> 01:14:28.330
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1668
01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:33.720
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really fascinating because it's a </v>

1669
01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:34.450
<v Speaker 1>form of sensory deprivation and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have actually decided that it,</v>

1670
01:14:34.451 --> 01:14:39.451
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it helps them so much that people </v>

1671
01:14:39.451 --> 01:14:41.581
<v Speaker 1>started wearing like earmuffs and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got Real Strickland and I know strictly </v>

1672
01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:44.290
<v Speaker 1>he's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing player.</v>

1673
01:14:44.291 --> 01:14:47.050
<v Speaker 1>He puts these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things that like the um,</v>

1674
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:52.110
<v Speaker 1>air traffic controllers were giant head </v>
<v Speaker 1>things over his head and he plays pool </v>

1675
01:14:52.331 --> 01:14:53.100
<v Speaker 1>with those lines.</v>

1676
01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Even it off with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1677
01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.430
<v Speaker 1>So the senses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1678
01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:02.310
<v Speaker 1>but he tries to recreate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He puts earplugs into.</v>

1679
01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:07.880
<v Speaker 1>So he puts earplugs in and then he puts </v>
<v Speaker 1>these gigantic fucking ear muffs over </v>

1680
01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:10.860
<v Speaker 1>the earplugs and then he plays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He plays like a man possessed the.</v>

1681
01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Both of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they play scary,</v>

1682
01:15:12.970 --> 01:15:15.280
<v Speaker 1>pulls them at that level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pool is madness.</v>

1683
01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Willie Mosconi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course I've heard of.</v>

1684
01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:23.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure because he was the guy that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big deal in Philly when I read his </v>

1685
01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:23.560
<v Speaker 1>tray pool all time high run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1686
01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:25.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like 580 ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm like,</v>

1687
01:15:25.241 --> 01:15:26.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1688
01:15:26.530 --> 01:15:27.570
<v Speaker 1>He ran it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was on.</v>

1689
01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:30.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a very controversial because he ran</v>
<v Speaker 1>out on a four by eight,</v>

1690
01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:34.200
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a four and a half by nine trips </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a dark I.</v>

1691
01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:35.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1692
01:15:35.710 --> 01:15:37.630
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luther last smart guy.</v>

1693
01:15:37.631 --> 01:15:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ever heard that name.</v>

1694
01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:40.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

1695
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a wimpy,</v>

1696
01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.800
<v Speaker 1>straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1697
01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:43.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1698
01:15:43.781 --> 01:15:45.610
<v Speaker 1>If there was money in pool when I was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>

1699
01:15:45.611 --> 01:15:48.490
<v Speaker 1>I would have become professional pool </v>
<v Speaker 1>player because I was enjoying it.</v>

1700
01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:53.520
<v Speaker 1>There's zero stricken with the earmuffs </v>
<v Speaker 1>on because I was enjoying playing pool </v>

1701
01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:57.841
<v Speaker 1>as much as I was enjoying doing comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't good enough to like we </v>

1702
01:15:58.430 --> 01:16:03.430
<v Speaker 1>talked about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would never have the time because </v>

1703
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:03.430
<v Speaker 1>you're too much of a career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It believe me.</v>

1704
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:05.400
<v Speaker 1>If you were on a law was a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

1705
01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:08.620
<v Speaker 1>you could turn pro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you could play for hours a day,</v>

1706
01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:13.860
<v Speaker 1>it's so much time and so much effort and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys that are playing that are at </v>

1707
01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:18.160
<v Speaker 1>the highest levels of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's several notches better than me.</v>

1708
01:16:18.430 --> 01:16:23.430
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be like an easy thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>even like do battle with those guys who </v>

1709
01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:26.600
<v Speaker 1>would take a long time when some nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>ballgames.</v>

1710
01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:27.370
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

1711
01:16:27.371 --> 01:16:30.720
<v Speaker 1>So that's straight pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy can sit you.</v>

1712
01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:33.880
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just too bad that that game doesn't</v>

1713
01:16:33.881 --> 01:16:36.850
<v Speaker 1>get like it's to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a form of meditation.</v>

1714
01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:41.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like if I can get into the zone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can block everything else out and I </v>

1715
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:44.260
<v Speaker 1>can move the ball exactly where I want </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to go and I know where it's going,</v>

1716
01:16:44.261 --> 01:16:49.261
<v Speaker 1>I know how to hit it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what speed to hit it and it gets </v>

1717
01:16:49.261 --> 01:16:49.870
<v Speaker 1>the right spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a beautiful feeling to that.</v>

1718
01:16:49.871 --> 01:16:50.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

1719
01:16:50.890 --> 01:16:55.890
<v Speaker 1>it's like a a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like enforcing this weird zen </v>

1720
01:16:55.890 --> 01:17:00.541
<v Speaker 1>state enforcing this state where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know exactly how many rotations of </v>

1721
01:17:00.911 --> 01:17:03.130
<v Speaker 1>ball's gonna go for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't play pool.</v>

1722
01:17:03.131 --> 01:17:08.131
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should we shut the fuck up about pool </v>

1723
01:17:08.131 --> 01:17:08.131
<v Speaker 1>already?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan,</v>

1747
01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.190
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I meant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was trying to find out what it was</v>

1748
01:18:19.191 --> 01:18:21.110
<v Speaker 1>and whether or not you incorporated </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretches,</v>

1749
01:18:21.111 --> 01:18:23.540
<v Speaker 1>especially the stretch out your </v>

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:29.630
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

1753
01:18:29.690 --> 01:18:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the,</v>

1754
01:18:30.591 --> 01:18:35.591
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people don't start yoga things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of whatever I learned from the </v>

1755
01:18:35.591 --> 01:18:39.641
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my favorite thing to do before I </v>

1756
01:18:39.641 --> 01:18:39.641
<v Speaker 1>go on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My favorite thing to do,</v>

1757
01:18:39.641 --> 01:18:39.641
<v Speaker 1>I do yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1758
01:18:39.641 --> 01:18:44.330
<v Speaker 1>that's my favorite thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried a bunch of different things </v>

1759
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:46.370
<v Speaker 1>that feel good before I go on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hard cardio is one of them.</v>

1760
01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Hard cardio makes me high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I really do like really hard </v>

1761
01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.860
<v Speaker 1>cardio before you go on stage for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

1762
01:18:53.861 --> 01:18:56.460
<v Speaker 1>I like to do like two hours before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially before,</v>

1763
01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.920
<v Speaker 1>like it was a big show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I want to be thinking about it,</v>

1764
01:18:59.030 --> 01:19:00.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give you energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1765
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:02.570
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it doesn't do,</v>

1766
01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:07.190
<v Speaker 1>it just releases some weird endorphin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with me or like if I do like a real hard</v>

1767
01:19:07.191 --> 01:19:09.140
<v Speaker 1>cardio session where I just feel silly.</v>

1768
01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.990
<v Speaker 1>I just saw it makes me Sillier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relieves me.</v>

1769
01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:17.620
<v Speaker 1>It relieves me of like physical tension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just makes me sillier and I think </v>

1770
01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:22.120
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever I can go on stage and being </v>

1771
01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:24.670
<v Speaker 1>more of a silly mood and the Sillier I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can feel the more funny I think things </v>

1772
01:19:24.670 --> 01:19:26.090
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the more funny and you'll get a</v>

1773
01:19:26.091 --> 01:19:26.990
<v Speaker 1>kick out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1774
01:19:27.190 --> 01:19:29.030
<v Speaker 1>The more funnier deliver it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1775
01:19:29.031 --> 01:19:30.440
<v Speaker 1>When you get a kick out of it and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1776
01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:34.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying it in a way that's a,</v>

1777
01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:40.480
<v Speaker 1>that connects with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it feels like too upset about </v>

1778
01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:43.211
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't understand why it connects </v>

1779
01:19:43.211 --> 01:19:43.211
<v Speaker 1>with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be a and honest,</v>

1780
01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:48.020
<v Speaker 1>an honest balance for why you're pissed </v>
<v Speaker 1>off or why you're happy,</v>

1781
01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:53.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's got to be an island </v>

1782
01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:53.040
<v Speaker 1>balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if sometimes you know,</v>

1783
01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:56.471
<v Speaker 1>that weird feeling when you watch them </v>
<v Speaker 1>on stage and they're acting pissed off </v>

1784
01:19:56.471 --> 01:19:56.471
<v Speaker 1>about something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1785
01:19:56.471 --> 01:19:56.720
<v Speaker 1>they're not really pissed off about it.</v>

1786
01:19:56.930 --> 01:20:01.210
<v Speaker 1>And how that is that mit does this </v>
<v Speaker 1>airplane food.</v>

1787
01:20:01.870 --> 01:20:03.380

<v Speaker 1>like someone like,</v>

1788
01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:08.410

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1792
01:20:16.591 --> 01:20:20.430
<v Speaker 1>when someone's mad for real and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they're mad for real.</v>

<v Speaker 1>too much of an act.</v>

1799
01:20:34.230 --> 01:20:37.530
<v Speaker 1>And I know a lot of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you do it on stage,</v>

1800
01:20:37.531 --> 01:20:38.760
<v Speaker 1>it's like you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't realize that yet or you </v>

1804
01:20:46.641 --> 01:20:47.430
<v Speaker 1>You're out of sorts that night and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just have a bad set.</v>

1805
01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:48.930
<v Speaker 1>You're not in the right groove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1806
01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:53.640
<v Speaker 1>we've all had those over the years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love watching Joey Diaz because of the</v>

1807
01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:56.140
<v Speaker 1>jelly is so fucking real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1808
01:20:56.310 --> 01:21:01.220
<v Speaker 1>There's not a phony bone in his body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That mother fucker now.</v>

1809
01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:04.020
<v Speaker 1>He's just so pure in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1810
01:21:04.050 --> 01:21:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not trying to win anybody over.</v>

1811
01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:11.750
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just trying to be funny to the </v>

1812
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.750
<v Speaker 1>people who love Joey Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he just,</v>

1813
01:21:12.030 --> 01:21:15.640
<v Speaker 1>he realized somewhere along the line </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was.</v>

1814
01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:18.050
<v Speaker 1>He's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He realized he really is.</v>

1815
01:21:18.051 --> 01:21:23.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He realized that he realized that </v>

1816
01:21:23.051 --> 01:21:24.731
<v Speaker 1>himself and he didn't give a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore and when he didn't give a fuck </v>

1817
01:21:24.731 --> 01:21:28.251
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that's when people really </v>

1818
01:21:28.251 --> 01:21:29.880
<v Speaker 1>wanted to hear more and so all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people around him,</v>

1819
01:21:29.881 --> 01:21:33.930
<v Speaker 1>like if he had anyone around him that </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't believe in him at this point,</v>

1820
01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:35.760
<v Speaker 1>they all really have fallen by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wayside,</v>

1821
01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:36.410
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1822
01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:41.420
<v Speaker 1>It's took it a long road for Joey to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like get recognized how funny he really </v>

1823
01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:41.420
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1824
01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:46.620
<v Speaker 1>And along the way a lot of people had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance to work with that guy and they </v>

1825
01:21:46.620 --> 01:21:49.341
<v Speaker 1>didn't believe in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was telling people about Joey Diaz in </v>

1826
01:21:49.341 --> 01:21:49.341
<v Speaker 1>1998.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1827
01:21:49.341 --> 01:21:50.730

<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1828
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:53.640
<v Speaker 1>this guy makes me laugh hard all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1829
01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:55.410
<v Speaker 1>He makes me laugh hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1830
01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:57.330
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he makes me laugh hard.</v>

1831
01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:00.240
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's to this and he's too bad.</v>

1832
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Then this doesn't work and that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work and if you can't be in a sitcom,</v>

1833
01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:07.140
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1892
01:24:10.691 --> 01:24:12.730
<v Speaker 1>place almost every night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really crazy.</v>

1893
01:24:12.731 --> 01:24:17.731
<v Speaker 1>We were out for 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>22 gigs after the exposure he got on the</v>

1894
01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:18.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1895
01:24:18.850 --> 01:24:23.850
<v Speaker 1>after he won half run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one last comic standing and Charlie </v>

1896
01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:24.820

<v Speaker 1>fucking sweetheart of a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as real as they come and a great </v>

1898
01:24:31.271 --> 01:24:32.140
<v Speaker 1>storyteller,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Charlie Murphy kill you in the green </v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

1900
01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:37.540
<v Speaker 1>He'll tell you some stories in the green</v>
<v Speaker 1>room and just kill you.</v>

1901
01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:40.290
<v Speaker 1>He's a natural storyteller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1902
01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:45.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a fun thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to bring people with the and </v>

1903
01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:45.300
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

1904
01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:48.750
<v Speaker 1>But that wasn't my idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was something that maximum and bud </v>

1905
01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:52.141
<v Speaker 1>light put together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all just did it together and became </v>

1906
01:24:52.141 --> 01:24:52.141
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once we did,</v>

1907
01:24:52.141 --> 01:24:56.131
<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know either one of those guys </v>

1908
01:24:56.131 --> 01:24:56.131
<v Speaker 1>before we did the tour.</v>

1909
01:24:56.131 --> 01:24:59.220
<v Speaker 1>So it was so lucky that they're both </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool as fuck because how fraud is cool </v>

1910
01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:02.641
<v Speaker 1>as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so is Charlie Murphy and that's how </v>

1911
01:25:02.641 --> 01:25:03.520
<v Speaker 1>we met Tom Segura too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were at the,</v>

1912
01:25:03.521 --> 01:25:04.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1913
01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:09.320
<v Speaker 1>the celebrity theatre and Phoenix and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sigora was the opening act and look like</v>

1914
01:25:10.091 --> 01:25:13.360
<v Speaker 1>they would do maximum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would hire like a local act,</v>

1915
01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:18.360
<v Speaker 1>like a local pro and they would do like </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes or so before the,</v>

1916
01:25:18.361 --> 01:25:23.361
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the show would start with a half drawn </v>

1917
01:25:23.361 --> 01:25:24.840
<v Speaker 1>and then he would either be me or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Charlie Murphy and I'm the.</v>

1918
01:25:24.930 --> 01:25:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Most of the guys were good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were all good.</v>

1919
01:25:26.890 --> 01:25:28.870
<v Speaker 1>But one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one guy was a deck,</v>

1920
01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:31.120
<v Speaker 1>one crazy guy in Boston was a douche </v>
<v Speaker 1>bag.</v>

1921
01:25:31.570 --> 01:25:33.850
<v Speaker 1>He was crazy drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No his name.</v>

1922
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Every drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes I do.</v>

1923
01:25:36.730 --> 01:25:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you said crazy and they all were </v>

1924
01:25:41.730 --> 01:25:43.450
<v Speaker 1>pretty good but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Segura just really stood out.</v>

1925
01:25:43.630 --> 01:25:44.950
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1926
01:25:44.951 --> 01:25:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went out there.</v>

1927
01:25:46.590 --> 01:25:49.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean the celebrity theater was a weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>place to because it was in the round.</v>

1928
01:25:49.690 --> 01:25:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Those shows are odd if you've never done</v>
<v Speaker 1>that before.</v>

1929
01:25:52.510 --> 01:25:56.500
<v Speaker 1>And I've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went out there and just played it.</v>

1930
01:25:57.190 --> 01:25:58.590
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1931
01:25:59.930 --> 01:26:03.950
<v Speaker 1>And I know he was a tough fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a big fella.</v>

1932
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Not Anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1933
01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:06.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was big.</v>

1934
01:26:06.881 --> 01:26:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Like he's a big man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not anymore.</v>

1935
01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:10.170
<v Speaker 1>No doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Thin,</v>

1936
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:12.520
<v Speaker 1>but he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>

1937
01:26:12.670 --> 01:26:14.900
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't always fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was big though.</v>

1938
01:26:14.990 --> 01:26:17.770
<v Speaker 1>He was when he would fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

1939
01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he might have a little bit of the </v>

1940
01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Yale and his sister before he slugged </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1941
01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:26.140
<v Speaker 1>Those guys were animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys like those cats.</v>

1942
01:26:26.150 --> 01:26:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gavin's,</v>

1943
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:33.550
<v Speaker 1>nox and sox was a little bit later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenny Rogers sin.</v>

1944
01:26:34.130 --> 01:26:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Those guys were savages.</v>

1945
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:38.210
<v Speaker 1>They don't get nearly the credit they </v>
<v Speaker 1>deserve.</v>

1946
01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:43.420
<v Speaker 1>There should've been a time capsule that</v>
<v Speaker 1>really captured that moment in common </v>

1947
01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:45.020
<v Speaker 1>and they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't somebody do a movie about them?</v>

1948
01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1949
01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:49.580
<v Speaker 1>France Palamida did pretty good was when</v>
<v Speaker 1>standups shit out.</v>

1950
01:26:49.670 --> 01:26:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Very good actually mean for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to because it was so close </v>

1951
01:26:54.670 --> 01:26:56.170
<v Speaker 1>to home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was much more impact.</v>

1952
01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:58.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to oversell it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I thought it was really fascinating.</v>

1953
01:26:58.971 --> 01:27:00.830
<v Speaker 1>If you're a fan of comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's brilliant.</v>

1954
01:27:00.890 --> 01:27:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I'll just never forget how they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>bury me in Boston.</v>

1955
01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:05.780
<v Speaker 1>Tried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1956
01:27:05.781 --> 01:27:06.440
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did.</v>

1957
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:11.470
<v Speaker 1>They really like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could tell that they had an </v>

1958
01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:14.410
<v Speaker 1>interesting relationship and Don Gavin </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave me a great intro and nobody tried </v>

1959
01:27:14.410 --> 01:27:19.220
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to burn if that's what </v>

1960
01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:19.220
<v Speaker 1>you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they didn't think you were a dick.</v>

1961
01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:19.220
<v Speaker 1>They all loved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1962
01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:19.460
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

1963
01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:20.220
<v Speaker 1>To me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would.</v>

1964
01:27:20.410 --> 01:27:22.340
<v Speaker 1>They would think some guys were dicks </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1965
01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were green light them.</v>

1966
01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that was like a freight train of</v>

1967
01:27:27.671 --> 01:27:32.671
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't fuck with that if they </v>

1968
01:27:32.671 --> 01:27:32.671
<v Speaker 1>greenlit billy crystal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did that to Richard Lewis.</v>

1969
01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Richard Lewis hid behind the stage for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience left.</v>

1970
01:27:36.270 --> 01:27:37.940
<v Speaker 1>There was these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1971
01:27:37.941 --> 01:27:42.941
<v Speaker 1>and he was one of them that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason they believe that </v>

1972
01:27:42.941 --> 01:27:43.400
<v Speaker 1>generated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

1973
01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:47.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little bit of billy crystal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more Richard Lewis.</v>

1974
01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:50.330
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys generated a lot of hate.</v>

1975
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At a certain certain Comedians,</v>

1976
01:27:53.061 --> 01:27:58.061
<v Speaker 1>like certain community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're like this guy just </v>

1977
01:27:58.061 --> 01:27:58.670
<v Speaker 1>fucking funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not fucking funny.</v>

1978
01:27:59.110 --> 01:28:01.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard like club owners say that.</v>

1979
01:28:01.971 --> 01:28:02.720
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1980
01:28:02.750 --> 01:28:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Like obviously some people like them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he obviously has like an audience,</v>

1981
01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:11.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta like it's from his movies more</v>

1982
01:28:11.091 --> 01:28:11.840
<v Speaker 1>than a stand up.</v>

1983
01:28:11.890 --> 01:28:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that with Richard </v>

1984
01:28:16.890 --> 01:28:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Lewis Lewis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1985
01:28:16.890 --> 01:28:20.410
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were talking about billy </v>

1986
01:28:20.410 --> 01:28:20.410
<v Speaker 1>crystal and Richard Lewis definitely </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up,</v>

1987
01:28:20.410 --> 01:28:22.880
<v Speaker 1>but for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certain people that will love to</v>

1988
01:28:22.881 --> 01:28:27.881
<v Speaker 1>hate that guy or disrespect is comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like everybody's got different </v>

1989
01:28:28.221 --> 01:28:32.540
<v Speaker 1>tastes and that's so hard for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are fans of standup comedy to</v>

1990
01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:34.540
<v Speaker 1>realize that's why there's no best </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup,</v>

1991
01:28:34.870 --> 01:28:36.430
<v Speaker 1>but not always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know best standup.</v>

1992
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:39.320
<v Speaker 1>You're crazy to look for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like don't even look for it.</v>

1993
01:28:39.450 --> 01:28:43.460
<v Speaker 1>It's just just just enjoy what you enjoy</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's subjective.</v>

1994
01:28:43.461 --> 01:28:48.461
<v Speaker 1>It's not objective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if there's the 100 yard dash guy </v>

1995
01:28:48.461 --> 01:28:50.290
<v Speaker 1>because the fastest guy wins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't argue that.</v>

1996
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:55.330
<v Speaker 1>I think that their guy was fast and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some guys that all they want to </v>

1997
01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:59.741
<v Speaker 1>see Gaffigan say anything African says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some guys and gals that Gaffigan</v>

1998
01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:06.200
<v Speaker 1>fucking for whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hits their frequency and for other </v>

1999
01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:06.690
<v Speaker 1>folks it's a towel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2000
01:29:06.691 --> 01:29:10.690
<v Speaker 1>and whatever it is it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can't get upset that some guys I</v>

2001
01:29:10.691 --> 01:29:12.690
<v Speaker 1>could tell like I don't even see it.</v>

2002
01:29:12.690 --> 01:29:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see it relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't concentrate on that.</v>

2003
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:16.190
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2004
01:29:16.191 --> 01:29:18.450
<v Speaker 1>you just relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get angry.</v>

2005
01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:21.480
<v Speaker 1>People love telling me that thing cooks </v>
<v Speaker 1>not funny.</v>

2006
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:22.860
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2007
01:29:22.861 --> 01:29:24.540
<v Speaker 1>relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you.</v>

2008
01:29:24.570 --> 01:29:29.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to think he's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently he made millions of dollars </v>

2009
01:29:29.570 --> 01:29:32.721
<v Speaker 1>because somebody thought he was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I get too much pleasure at other </v>

2010
01:29:32.721 --> 01:29:34.320
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sucking that is a problem.</v>

2011
01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:39.380
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get this weird pleasure out of </v>

2012
01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:41.880
<v Speaker 1>other people sucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

2013
01:29:42.330 --> 01:29:43.980
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2014
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:47.190
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird little side effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little heater side effect.</v>

2015
01:29:47.191 --> 01:29:49.530
<v Speaker 1>It's jealousy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a combination of a lot of things,</v>

2016
01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:54.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's so bad for the person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks that that's what they don't </v>

2017
01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:55.050
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just a massive distraction,</v>

2018
01:29:55.530 --> 01:30:00.530
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it just takes away so much energy </v>

2019
01:30:00.530 --> 01:30:02.280
<v Speaker 1>from your own life because instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrating on this other person,</v>

2020
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:05.190
<v Speaker 1>you should be concentrating on your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and if something bothers you,</v>

2021
01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:08.940
<v Speaker 1>you should find a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if at all possible.</v>

2022
01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:12.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's of course it's some egregious</v>
<v Speaker 1>offense or a crime or some,</v>

2023
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:17.270
<v Speaker 1>some sort of sin against man and nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find some way to turn it into a </v>

2024
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:22.041
<v Speaker 1>motivating factor for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you feel weak because you see some </v>

2025
01:30:22.041 --> 01:30:23.420
<v Speaker 1>guy like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

2026
01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:28.520
<v Speaker 1>name your fucking book Mogul Bill Gates </v>
<v Speaker 1>on TV and he's got a billion dollars in </v>

2027
01:30:28.591 --> 01:30:29.650
<v Speaker 1>his underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2028
01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:33.300
<v Speaker 1>and you feel like you can't even fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay my student loans are figuring out,</v>

2029
01:30:33.301 --> 01:30:37.080
<v Speaker 1>figure out what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck you need to do so that you</v>

2030
01:30:37.081 --> 01:30:39.660
<v Speaker 1>become so successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't worry about Bill Gates anymore</v>

2031
01:30:39.730 --> 01:30:41.370
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have to be as successful of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bill gates,</v>

2032
01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:46.640
<v Speaker 1>but become enough of a person who </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures your way through the net of </v>

2033
01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:51.321
<v Speaker 1>civilization to the point where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to worry when maybe for </v>

2034
01:30:51.321 --> 01:30:55.281
<v Speaker 1>everybody has their own gradient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For some people it might be just making </v>

2035
01:30:55.281 --> 01:30:55.670
<v Speaker 1>a living is good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2036
01:30:55.710 --> 01:30:57.960
<v Speaker 1>for some people it has nothing to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with how much money they make.</v>

2037
01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:00.360
<v Speaker 1>It has to do with getting their fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind right.</v>

2038
01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:03.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into either go into a shrink or doing</v>

2039
01:31:03.271 --> 01:31:08.130
<v Speaker 1>some yoga or going on a mushroom trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out whatever the fuck you need to</v>

2040
01:31:08.131 --> 01:31:13.131
<v Speaker 1>do to get your mind right because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter how much money you make </v>

2041
01:31:13.131 --> 01:31:13.740
<v Speaker 1>or it doesn't matter anything that else </v>
<v Speaker 1>is going on in your life.</v>

2042
01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:16.890
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have your mind right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not thinking about life,</v>

2043
01:31:16.891 --> 01:31:18.420
<v Speaker 1>clearly you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna.</v>

2044
01:31:18.450 --> 01:31:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Make some Shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid decisions.</v>

2045
01:31:20.221 --> 01:31:20.870
<v Speaker 1>So you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna.</v>

2046
01:31:20.890 --> 01:31:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Be annoying to almost everybody around </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2047
01:31:23.190 --> 01:31:25.290
<v Speaker 1>You're going to fuck things up left and </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2048
01:31:26.010 --> 01:31:27.060
<v Speaker 1>Get it together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

2049
01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Hey talking to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that you don't know,</v>

2050
01:31:30.150 --> 01:31:35.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never are you a so you're going to this </v>

2051
01:31:35.150 --> 01:31:35.490
<v Speaker 1>defined sasquatch going to find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we talk about that.</v>

2052
01:31:35.491 --> 01:31:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Yes we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can can't talk too much because it is</v>

2053
01:31:38.131 --> 01:31:41.070
<v Speaker 1>top secret,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for my new Saifai show,</v>

2054
01:31:41.850 --> 01:31:46.850
<v Speaker 1>very soon in the near future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go searching for sasquatch </v>

2055
01:31:46.850 --> 01:31:51.021
<v Speaker 1>and very peculiar and particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>location that has been known for a high </v>

2056
01:31:51.021 --> 01:31:52.070
<v Speaker 1>volume of sasquatch sightings era.</v>

2057
01:31:52.290 --> 01:31:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Was there a particular forest that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequents perhaps is the same?</v>

2058
01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:59.320
<v Speaker 1>I can't say whether I've said too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>

2059
01:31:59.620 --> 01:32:04.620
<v Speaker 1>but we will be camping and will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will be getting our freak out in the </v>

2060
01:32:05.171 --> 01:32:10.171
<v Speaker 1>woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'd want to go camp and </v>

2061
01:32:10.171 --> 01:32:10.171
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2062
01:32:10.171 --> 01:32:11.230
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you when I get back whether or</v>

2063
01:32:11.231 --> 01:32:16.231
<v Speaker 1>not it was worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What didn't you go somewhere with </v>

2064
01:32:16.231 --> 01:32:16.231
<v Speaker 1>Carolyn?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2065
01:32:16.231 --> 01:32:17.550
<v Speaker 1>We went hunting in Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice I said hunting with no gi.</v>

2066
01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:20.650
<v Speaker 1>That's because I'm a hunter.</v>

<v Speaker 1>sitting there and that's his favorite </v>

2077
01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:45.130
<v Speaker 1>thing in the world.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very fun.</v>

2079
01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:52.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people don't want to hear that </v>

2080
01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:52.800
<v Speaker 1>because they don't want you going out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there killing animals.</v>

2081
01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:53.140
<v Speaker 1>They take call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2082
01:32:53.141 --> 01:32:55.660
<v Speaker 1>You can't say it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say that you call that fun man.</v>

2083
01:32:56.020 --> 01:33:01.020
<v Speaker 1>What's rewarding and beautiful and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>connects you to nature and it's very </v>

2084
01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:02.500
<v Speaker 1>humbling and it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2085
01:33:02.501 --> 01:33:05.800
<v Speaker 1>it's a really intense thing like making </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own,</v>

2086
01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:07.720
<v Speaker 1>getting your own food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2087
01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:10.450
<v Speaker 1>going out and hunting your own food is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very intense.</v>

2088
01:33:10.451 --> 01:33:15.451
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think everybody should have to </v>

2089
01:33:15.451 --> 01:33:15.451
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for me it was a,</v>

2090
01:33:15.451 --> 01:33:19.150
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like five star restaurants,</v>

2091
01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:23.050
<v Speaker 1>like being upgraded me to these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these things are good as well.</v>

2092
01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2093
01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:26.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm too lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to like pick up a tent.</v>

2094
01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:29.080
<v Speaker 1>I feel you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel you bro.</v>

2095
01:33:29.170 --> 01:33:32.260

<v Speaker 1>but say you like it,</v>

2096
01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:33.310
<v Speaker 1>but I don't like it.</v>

2097
01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:34.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just do it.</v>

2098
01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Just I just because I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that you went to one </v>

2099
01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:39.930
<v Speaker 1>with Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He must've liked it.</v>

2100
01:33:40.010 --> 01:33:45.010
<v Speaker 1>It was cold as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're camping out in the middle of the </v>

2101
01:33:45.010 --> 01:33:45.820
<v Speaker 1>snow in Montana in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>freezing weather.</v>

2102
01:33:45.821 --> 01:33:47.500
<v Speaker 1>It didn't snow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It did rain one day though.</v>

2103
01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:51.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's miserable.</v>

2104
01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:53.560
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to experience it,</v>

2105
01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:54.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it'd be,</v>

2106
01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:00.000
<v Speaker 1>I think we're so far removed from being </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the wilderness that to have an </v>

2107
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.771
<v Speaker 1>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with like expert outdoorsman </v>

2108
01:34:04.771 --> 01:34:05.080
<v Speaker 1>to go out into the wilderness for five </v>
<v Speaker 1>days and be like,</v>

2118
01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:30.100
<v Speaker 1>monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy fucking fish.</v>

2119
01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't have a quickie or,</v>

2120
01:34:33.450 --> 01:34:38.450
<v Speaker 1>and how hard it must've been to eat fish</v>
<v Speaker 1>back before people figured out rods and </v>

2121
01:34:38.450 --> 01:34:41.020
<v Speaker 1>reels and spears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chili fucking hard to get a fish meal.</v>

2122
01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:44.600
<v Speaker 1>What do you get a deal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta grab it with your hand.</v>

2123
01:34:44.601 --> 01:34:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2124
01:34:45.341 --> 01:34:47.310
<v Speaker 1>the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the them swimming upstream,</v>

2125
01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:49.780
<v Speaker 1>there was so many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could like bad amount of the air.</v>

2126
01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:53.020
<v Speaker 1>So ridiculous that that was the choice </v>
<v Speaker 1>for survival,</v>

2127
01:34:53.050 --> 01:34:58.050
<v Speaker 1>that they would go all the way upstream </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the river or back up the mouth </v>

2128
01:34:58.050 --> 01:34:58.850
<v Speaker 1>of the river at the brightest fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2129
01:34:58.851 --> 01:35:03.851
<v Speaker 1>that's nuts that they live in fresh </v>
<v Speaker 1>water and and they also live in </v>

2130
01:35:03.851 --> 01:35:05.060
<v Speaker 1>saltwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a crazy animal.</v>

2131
01:35:05.061 --> 01:35:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Brackish water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wild fucking animal.</v>

2132
01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Is that a real thing that's been going </v>
<v Speaker 1>around this thing with human like teeth?</v>

2133
01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:15.920
<v Speaker 1>It's called a sheep shed sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said fish.</v>

2134
01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Sheep said fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2135
01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:20.030
<v Speaker 1>It's all over the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2136
01:35:20.031 --> 01:35:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Fisher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weird band.</v>

2137
01:35:21.790 --> 01:35:23.990
<v Speaker 1>They're out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty thin water and shit.</v>

2138
01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Swimming around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched the show today about a </v>

2139
01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:29.150
<v Speaker 1>paddlefish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paddlefish is.</v>

2140
01:35:29.570 --> 01:35:34.570
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have any bones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some weird prehistoric fish that lives </v>

2141
01:35:34.731 --> 01:35:39.731
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there was the ozarks or </v>

2142
01:35:39.731 --> 01:35:41.651
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what they were saying that you </v>

2143
01:35:41.651 --> 01:35:44.471
<v Speaker 1>can't even catch them with like bait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way you catch them is by having a </v>

2144
01:35:44.471 --> 01:35:48.551
<v Speaker 1>line with a bunch of hooks on it and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just drop it down and keep pulling it </v>

2145
01:35:48.551 --> 01:35:48.950
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but keep pulling up,</v>

2146
01:35:48.951 --> 01:35:53.951
<v Speaker 1>trying to snag something and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you snag it and if you snag it then </v>

2147
01:35:54.291 --> 01:35:59.291
<v Speaker 1>you just pull it up to the surface but </v>
<v Speaker 1>you never like legitimately catch </v>

2148
01:35:59.291 --> 01:36:00.210
<v Speaker 1>whenever you just got to snag one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never heard.</v>

2149
01:36:00.210 --> 01:36:02.240
<v Speaker 1>It's still a way to catch them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2150
01:36:02.241 --> 01:36:05.870
<v Speaker 1>they're enormous and they have no bones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so weird.</v>

2151
01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:10.610
<v Speaker 1>There are some sort of weird prehistoric</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish and the way they got them,</v>

2152
01:36:10.611 --> 01:36:13.160
<v Speaker 1>it's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make an incision and then they pull</v>

2153
01:36:13.161 --> 01:36:14.930
<v Speaker 1>out the spinal cord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They eat them.</v>

2154
01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They eat everything.</v>

2155
01:36:16.221 --> 01:36:21.221
<v Speaker 1>They in this row of of these animals is </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently very much likes sturgeon row,</v>

2156
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:29.530
<v Speaker 1>which is what caviar is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is worth a lot of money and so in </v>

2157
01:36:29.530 --> 01:36:33.761
<v Speaker 1>order to make sure that they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow a market for this stuff to </v>

2158
01:36:34.371 --> 01:36:39.371
<v Speaker 1>develop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's legal to kill the </v>

2159
01:36:39.371 --> 01:36:41.741
<v Speaker 1>animal and legal to eat the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only legal to possess it's row on </v>

2160
01:36:42.051 --> 01:36:47.051
<v Speaker 1>the dock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could only either have it on your </v>

2161
01:36:47.051 --> 01:36:49.751
<v Speaker 1>boat or on the dock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you got to either eat that row or </v>

2162
01:36:49.751 --> 01:36:52.781
<v Speaker 1>throw it out because you can't take it </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you because you can develop a </v>

2163
01:36:52.781 --> 01:36:52.781
<v Speaker 1>market for it.</v>

2164
01:36:52.781 --> 01:36:57.070
<v Speaker 1>You can't develop a market for it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because then the animals road would be </v>

2165
01:36:57.070 --> 01:36:58.380
<v Speaker 1>worth too much and they would worry that</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you,</v>

2166
01:36:58.381 --> 01:37:03.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a certain number that you can </v>

2167
01:37:03.381 --> 01:37:03.381
<v Speaker 1>kill and a day and eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they say it tastes good.</v>

2168
01:37:03.381 --> 01:37:05.180
<v Speaker 1>They say it tastes like pork as they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

2169
01:37:05.181 --> 01:37:06.500
<v Speaker 1>When they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They grilled it,</v>

2170
01:37:06.501 --> 01:37:11.501
<v Speaker 1>they said it because like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have an aversion to eating it </v>

2171
01:37:11.501 --> 01:37:11.501
<v Speaker 1>because it's a strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>

2172
01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:16.540
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like they have prejudices </v>
<v Speaker 1>against it because it doesn't have any </v>

2173
01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:18.560
<v Speaker 1>bones and it looks like it's a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion years old.</v>

2174
01:37:18.561 --> 01:37:20.420
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a crazy dime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swordfish.</v>

2175
01:37:20.450 --> 01:37:22.980
<v Speaker 1>It's missing the keep discovering new </v>
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>

2176
01:37:23.050 --> 01:37:28.050
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard of the snakehead </v>

2177
01:37:28.050 --> 01:37:28.050
<v Speaker 1>fish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2178
01:37:28.050 --> 01:37:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Those are a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have snakehead fishes in fishes.</v>

2179

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2184

<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's going on in have water for</v>

2185
01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:43.660
<v Speaker 1>a couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is the scary part.</v>

2186
01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:46.290
<v Speaker 1>They walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they walk the walk?</v>

2187
01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A special about the Congo where I think </v>

2188
01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:53.720
<v Speaker 1>that's where they live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think where they live isn't the Congo.</v>

2189
01:37:54.050 --> 01:37:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the then into Asia and Russia is </v>

2190
01:37:59.050 --> 01:37:59.050
<v Speaker 1>what this says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

2191
01:37:59.050 --> 01:38:00.780
<v Speaker 1>What this article says?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're probably right.</v>

2192
01:38:00.810 --> 01:38:01.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I'm wrong,</v>

2193
01:38:01.801 --> 01:38:04.580
<v Speaker 1>but there's a fish like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might not be the snakehead,</v>

2194
01:38:04.590 --> 01:38:06.330
<v Speaker 1>but this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a video.</v>

2195
01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Let me see if I can pull it up on </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube.</v>

2196
01:38:08.250 --> 01:38:11.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a BBC Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2197
01:38:11.490 --> 01:38:15.900
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really a damn shame that this video</v>

2198
01:38:15.901 --> 01:38:17.530
<v Speaker 1>isn't like one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2199
01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:22.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those mother earth or a planet earth DVD</v>

2200
01:38:22.690 --> 01:38:27.690
<v Speaker 1>setups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're super easy to get </v>

2201
01:38:27.690 --> 01:38:27.690
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows about them.</v>

2202
01:38:27.690 --> 01:38:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

2203
01:38:27.690 --> 01:38:29.910
<v Speaker 1>if you want to see some cool shit on </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of the planet Earth series is,</v>

2204
01:38:29.911 --> 01:38:31.620
<v Speaker 1>is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2205
01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:36.700
<v Speaker 1>the BBC One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Congo one really should be just as </v>

2206
01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:39.150
<v Speaker 1>fascinating to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really sad that a,</v>

2207
01:38:39.210 --> 01:38:42.390
<v Speaker 1>that for whatever reason that that video</v>
<v Speaker 1>is hard to get ahold of.</v>

2208
01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:48.260
<v Speaker 1>But in one of the scenes there's this </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird fish probably similar to snake </v>

2209
01:38:48.311 --> 01:38:53.311
<v Speaker 1>head gets out of water and start to walk</v>
<v Speaker 1>in and you're like,</v>

2210
01:38:53.371 --> 01:38:56.800
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's his walks over to another puddle.</v>

2211
01:38:56.830 --> 01:39:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Then jumps in you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you literally can't believe what I'm </v>

2212
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:04.341
<v Speaker 1>seeing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a dinosaur is fucking </v>

2213
01:39:04.341 --> 01:39:04.341
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just did some dinosaur shit.</v>

2214
01:39:04.341 --> 01:39:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2215
01:39:04.681 --> 01:39:07.910
<v Speaker 1>we're literally seeing life evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>

2216
01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:09.780
<v Speaker 1>That's like the beginning of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2217
01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:13.890
<v Speaker 1>The ability to come out of the water and</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk on the ground to better water.</v>

2218
01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a freak.</v>

2219
01:39:17.151 --> 01:39:19.910
<v Speaker 1>You fucking snake fish thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

2220
01:39:19.911 --> 01:39:21.790
<v Speaker 1>And they call it a snake fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

2221
01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:25.210
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what it's called in the Congo </v>
<v Speaker 1>snake.</v>

2222
01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Snakehead fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2223
01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:34.780
<v Speaker 1>the Congo is apparently like one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>densest,</v>

2224
01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:37.630
<v Speaker 1>densest rain forests in the world.</v>

2225
01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck that,</v>

2226
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:43.490
<v Speaker 1>that fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called naked something else.</v>

2227
01:39:44.810 --> 01:39:47.030
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get a chance to get ahold of that</v>

2228
01:39:47.031 --> 01:39:49.640
<v Speaker 1>documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just called BBC Congo.</v>

2229
01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Let me Google it real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it was called.</v>

2230
01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:56.390
<v Speaker 1>There's something coming up for mystery </v>
<v Speaker 1>fish of the Congo,</v>

2231
01:39:56.391 --> 01:39:58.370
<v Speaker 1>but the video won't play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2232
01:39:58.371 --> 01:40:01.850
<v Speaker 1>there is also those ones that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>already watched a show.</v>

2233
01:40:01.851 --> 01:40:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>river monsters.</v>

2234
01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:05.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy is bad ass.</v>

2235
01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:09.650
<v Speaker 1>He's a fishing motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy went out in the wooden canal.</v>

2236
01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:11.690
<v Speaker 1>I used to think nothing of that show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

2237
01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the guy fishing.</v>

2238
01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:14.810
<v Speaker 1>What's the big deal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2239
01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:19.610
<v Speaker 1>this guy finishes how the locals fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got an this wooden boat.</v>

2240
01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:23.480
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With like a hundred hooks in it and they</v>

2241
01:40:23.481 --> 01:40:25.410
<v Speaker 1>were in this like tipity top one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2242
01:40:25.450 --> 01:40:28.940
<v Speaker 1>and they're dropping these lines in for </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant catfish.</v>

2243
01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:34.180
<v Speaker 1>So at any point in time something could </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking grabbed one of those lines and </v>

2244
01:40:34.180 --> 01:40:38.020
<v Speaker 1>hold those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those fishing lines and who knows how </v>

2245
01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:38.210
<v Speaker 1>many hooks are flying in that guy's </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

2246
01:40:38.211 --> 01:40:43.211
<v Speaker 1>And actually people have died from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the people in this tribe </v>

2247
01:40:43.211 --> 01:40:46.750
<v Speaker 1>died from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got caught on a hook and dragged </v>

2248
01:40:46.750 --> 01:40:46.750
<v Speaker 1>underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that guy is legit.</v>

2249
01:40:46.850 --> 01:40:49.280
<v Speaker 1>And this is the other thing that he said</v>
<v Speaker 1>while he was there,</v>

2250
01:40:49.580 --> 01:40:50.380
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2251
01:40:50.450 --> 01:40:54.820
<v Speaker 1>one of the people are the main people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their tribe that chief disappeared.</v>

2252
01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:00.000
<v Speaker 4>He was gone for a whole day and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were seriously worried and because they </v>

2253
01:41:00.521 --> 01:41:05.521
<v Speaker 4>believe in bad spirits and bad omens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they believe that he had caused the </v>

2254
01:41:06.761 --> 01:41:09.670
<v Speaker 4>chief to disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if the chief didn't come back,</v>

2255
01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:13.330
<v Speaker 4>they were planning on killing him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were going to stone him to death.</v>

2256
01:41:13.850 --> 01:41:17.380
<v Speaker 4>But thankfully the chief came back and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody was elated because like,</v>

2257
01:41:17.650 --> 01:41:20.020
<v Speaker 4>but he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't understand how close I came to</v>

2258
01:41:20.021 --> 01:41:25.021
<v Speaker 4>dying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they would have tried to kill him </v>

2259
01:41:25.021 --> 01:41:25.360
<v Speaker 4>because they felt like he was a bad omen</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he created,</v>

2260
01:41:25.361 --> 01:41:27.820
<v Speaker 4>even if you didn't actively do anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the chief,</v>

2261
01:41:28.090 --> 01:41:33.090
<v Speaker 4>he created the bad luck that made the </v>
<v Speaker 4>chief disappear is fucking canoe,</v>

2262
01:41:33.850 --> 01:41:36.110
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's that joke?</v>

2263
01:41:36.230 --> 01:41:39.370
<v Speaker 4>It was a stupid joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But a guy,</v>

2264
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:43.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is captured by these savages and they're</v>

2265
01:41:43.061 --> 01:41:44.330
<v Speaker 4>going to eat him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2266
01:41:44.530 --> 01:41:47.020
<v Speaker 4>And he said that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to butcher the joke,</v>

2267
01:41:47.050 --> 01:41:49.240
<v Speaker 4>but I just loved the punchline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

2268
01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:50.680
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you going to do with your skin?</v>

2269
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:53.140
<v Speaker 4>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to make a cannula out of it.</v>

2270
01:41:53.580 --> 01:41:54.580
<v Speaker 4>And it grabs a knife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

2271
01:41:54.581 --> 01:41:55.900
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking canoe.</v>

2272
01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:04.570

<v Speaker 4>That's a tough joke.</v>

2273
01:42:04.630 --> 01:42:07.580
<v Speaker 4>That's a tough job.</v>

2361
01:46:11.351 --> 01:46:14.180

<v Speaker 4>He came up to me in Rochester,</v>

2362
01:46:14.181 --> 01:46:18.920
<v Speaker 4>New York we met for and he was so proud </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he was only drinking beer.</v>

2366
01:46:23.661 --> 01:46:28.661
<v Speaker 4>only being an alcoholic kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is such a giant difference between</v>

2367
01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:34.660
<v Speaker 1>those drugs and all the other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The opiates and those are the.</v>

<v Speaker 1>some sort of clinic for opiate </v>

2369
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:40.770
<v Speaker 1>addiction.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2374
01:46:54.930 --> 01:46:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean if there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so dangerous,</v>

2375
01:46:57.780 --> 01:47:00.090
<v Speaker 1>but I love the feeling because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want fucking.</v>

2376
01:47:00.570 --> 01:47:05.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want to be like meth or </v>

<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

2381
01:47:11.761 --> 01:47:14.760
<v Speaker 1>I like to be nodding off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing up.</v>

2382
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:19.580
<v Speaker 1>It was a sense of music all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think already I saw.</v>

2383
01:47:20.610 --> 01:47:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to the root of things.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't trust anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my rule and I don't tell anybody</v>

2388
01:47:34.291 --> 01:47:36.510
<v Speaker 1>what to do ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not true.</v>

2389

<v Speaker 1>The only time I.</v>

2398
01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:02.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm absolutely smoked pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to be before Jujitsu,</v>

2399
01:48:03.010 --> 01:48:08.010

<v Speaker 1>I'm almost always do it before that or </v>

2400
01:48:08.010 --> 01:48:10.050
<v Speaker 1>before writing a lot of time to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before writing.</v>

2404
01:48:19.951 --> 01:48:23.670
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think when you get an opportunity</v>

01:48:23.671 --> 01:48:26.130
<v Speaker 1>to look at things from like coffee </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do that.</v>

2406
01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Coffee sort of inspires movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspires me to act to me,</v>

2407
01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:35.960
<v Speaker 1>to have energy to start things off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for me the best inspiration is like </v>

2408
01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:40.700
<v Speaker 1>a mental inspiration because inspiration</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I could step away from it all and </v>

2409
01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:40.700
<v Speaker 1>see it from a different perspective.</v>

2410
01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:45.740
<v Speaker 1>So that's what a lot of times we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting high does for me allows me to </v>

2411
01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:46.440
<v Speaker 1>just like move over to the next window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2412
01:48:46.490 --> 01:48:50.550
<v Speaker 1>I've been looking at things through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>window of sober sustained reality.</v>

2413
01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Let's move over and look at things from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

2414
01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh look it over here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're kinda high and you relax a</v>

2415
01:48:55.831 --> 01:48:58.000
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize this is kind of funny.</v>

2416
01:48:58.040 --> 01:49:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he start poking holes in things</v>

2417
01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:03.840
<v Speaker 1>instead of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get funnier at all with alcohol.</v>

2418
01:49:03.841 --> 01:49:05.490
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only thing I ever do,</v>

2419
01:49:05.970 --> 01:49:10.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's one Martini will get me funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2420
01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Two martinis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not so funny.</v>

2421
01:49:13.890 --> 01:49:15.940
<v Speaker 1>It's really a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really a bit.</v>

2422
01:49:15.980 --> 01:49:20.980
<v Speaker 1>It really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just slows me down enough where I </v>

2423
01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:21.460
<v Speaker 1>don't feel that fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And keep bottom.</v>

2426
01:49:26.821 --> 01:49:29.950
<v Speaker 1>like a little bit of a buzz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a tiny little bit of a buzz.</v>

2427
01:49:29.951 --> 01:49:32.670
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of Nice to nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get nervous at all?</v>

2428
01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:36.420
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get the only time I get anxious at all</v>

2429
01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.160
<v Speaker 1>is if someone I know is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2430
01:49:38.161 --> 01:49:40.610
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that makes me like usually performed</v>

2431
01:49:40.611 --> 01:49:41.240
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

01:53:38.141 --> 01:53:41.861
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of it is just because people </v>

<v Speaker 1>But I also was able to teach martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts and uh,</v>

2634
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:45.190
<v Speaker 1>because I had taught so many martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts classes,</v>

2635
01:58:45.620 --> 01:58:50.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had like a little bit less fear of </v>

2636
01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:54.121
<v Speaker 1>talking about we should have had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least you're doing public </v>

2637
01:58:54.121 --> 01:58:56.140
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had conducted a class.</v>

2638
01:58:56.141 --> 01:58:57.490
<v Speaker 1>I took many classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2639
01:58:57.491 --> 01:59:00.560
<v Speaker 1>this is what I was doing for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How far did you go and martial arts?</v>

2640
01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:06.540
<v Speaker 1>When I was 19 I was teaching taekwondo </v>
<v Speaker 1>at Boston University.</v>

2641
01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:11.590
<v Speaker 1>I was a black belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was a windows black I think when I</v>

2642
01:59:11.591 --> 01:59:15.010
<v Speaker 1>was 16 or 17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so probably 17,</v>

2643
01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:17.340
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2644
01:59:17.341 --> 01:59:21.220
<v Speaker 1>I won the Massachusetts state </v>
<v Speaker 1>championship like four years in a while.</v>

2645
01:59:21.570 --> 01:59:23.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a couple of other.</v>

2646
01:59:23.590 --> 01:59:26.880
<v Speaker 1>So good for your head to get hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2647
01:59:26.881 --> 01:59:29.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean the emotional head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2648
01:59:29.570 --> 01:59:31.570
<v Speaker 1>it was for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me at the time it was big,</v>

2649
01:59:32.350 --> 01:59:33.550
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the teaching,</v>

2650
01:59:33.790 --> 01:59:36.760
<v Speaker 1>it was really satisfying watching people</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn things.</v>

2651
01:59:36.790 --> 01:59:38.260
<v Speaker 1>That's what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned.</v>

2652
01:59:38.590 --> 01:59:43.590
<v Speaker 1>I really love sharing things and I also </v>
<v Speaker 1>learned that in sharing like teaching </v>

2653
01:59:44.291 --> 01:59:49.291
<v Speaker 1>techniques with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really concentrated on my own </v>

2654
01:59:49.291 --> 01:59:49.291
<v Speaker 1>techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

2655
01:59:49.291 --> 01:59:52.951
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of my kicks and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>my movements got even sharper because I </v>

2656
01:59:52.951 --> 01:59:56.551
<v Speaker 1>was teaching them to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like it was breaking them down and </v>

2657
01:59:56.551 --> 01:59:57.190
<v Speaker 1>showing them how to do them from scratch</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then have like a few people.</v>

2658
01:59:57.190 --> 02:00:02.020
<v Speaker 1>There was this one girl that I trained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she came in as a white belt and then she</v>

2659
02:00:02.021 --> 02:00:05.560
<v Speaker 1>got all the way up to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anybody to get mad at me,</v>

2660
02:00:05.561 --> 02:00:07.480
<v Speaker 1>but I believe it was yellow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>green,</v>

2661
02:00:07.540 --> 02:00:08.530
<v Speaker 1>blue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red,</v>

2662
02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:10.360
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was a thing.</v>

2663
02:00:10.361 --> 02:00:13.630
<v Speaker 1>She got up to blue which was a pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2664
02:00:13.631 --> 02:00:18.631
<v Speaker 1>pretty high and I'm means you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to compete against people that </v>

2665
02:00:18.631 --> 02:00:22.711
<v Speaker 1>are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other dangerous they can kick in the </v>

2666
02:00:22.711 --> 02:00:22.711
<v Speaker 1>fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could get crazy.</v>

2667
02:00:22.711 --> 02:00:23.620
<v Speaker 1>And she won this tournament and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>coaching,</v>

2668
02:00:23.890 --> 02:00:28.890
<v Speaker 1>so I coached her from the time she was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>white path all the way to the till the </v>

2669
02:00:28.890 --> 02:00:28.890
<v Speaker 1>time she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

2670
02:00:28.890 --> 02:00:29.350
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2671
02:00:29.351 --> 02:00:31.090
<v Speaker 1>it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was a young kid.</v>

2672
02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:34.120
<v Speaker 1>She was in high school and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>

2673
02:00:34.121 --> 02:00:35.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was really talented.</v>

2674
02:00:35.261 --> 02:00:38.290
<v Speaker 1>She just knew how to listen and she knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to listen and she knew how to do.</v>

2675
02:00:38.370 --> 02:00:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I explained she could like and she </v>

2676
02:00:43.370 --> 02:00:46.891
<v Speaker 1>was like super focused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really interesting teaching </v>

2677
02:00:46.891 --> 02:00:50.311
<v Speaker 1>someone something and seeing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like someone completely dive into </v>

2678
02:00:50.311 --> 02:00:51.530
<v Speaker 1>something that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you appreciate.</v>

2679
02:00:51.550 --> 02:00:55.660
<v Speaker 1>And watching them get better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So rewarding to be able to pass that on.</v>

2680
02:00:56.500 --> 02:00:59.020
<v Speaker 1>I always used to remember like my </v>
<v Speaker 1>instructor,</v>

2681
02:00:59.220 --> 02:01:04.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when like there was guys that were </v>

2682
02:01:04.220 --> 02:01:04.220
<v Speaker 1>really good in the class and they did </v>
<v Speaker 1>something really good,</v>

2683
02:01:04.220 --> 02:01:08.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it was a sparring demonstration </v>

2684
02:01:08.911 --> 02:01:08.911
<v Speaker 1>or whether they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2685
02:01:08.911 --> 02:01:09.910
<v Speaker 1>did a drill in the bag or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2686
02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:15.400
<v Speaker 1>He had his beam of joy in his eyes when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he saw you do it really well.</v>

2687
02:01:15.401 --> 02:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2688
02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:19.930
<v Speaker 1>like when you really take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know he would get excited and like that,</v>

2689
02:01:19.950 --> 02:01:22.870
<v Speaker 1>like you could see it as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand it then,</v>

2690
02:01:22.871 --> 02:01:25.260
<v Speaker 1>but when I started teaching I realized </v>
<v Speaker 1>like there you,</v>

2691
02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:29.860
<v Speaker 1>you're taking part in someone's joy by </v>
<v Speaker 1>helping them create something by helping</v>

2692
02:01:29.861 --> 02:01:33.430
<v Speaker 1>them create these movements and figuring</v>
<v Speaker 1>out how to do these movements correctly.</v>

2693
02:01:33.700 --> 02:01:36.250
<v Speaker 1>That it's not just like learning how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kick,</v>

2694
02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:41.480
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's like tapping into this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this area where you have control over </v>

2695
02:01:41.631 --> 02:01:46.631
<v Speaker 1>the whole package.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even for just a brief moment and he </v>

2696
02:01:46.631 --> 02:01:50.461
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a phrase that they had </v>

2697
02:01:50.461 --> 02:01:53.320
<v Speaker 1>from the taekwondo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a brochure when you signed up that I </v>

2698
02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:56.900
<v Speaker 1>never forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said that it was a vehicle for </v>

2699
02:01:56.900 --> 02:01:58.480
<v Speaker 1>developing your human potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like that's,</v>

2700
02:01:58.490 --> 02:02:01.070
<v Speaker 1>that's how I thought of it and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>how I would teach it.</v>

2701
02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:04.900
<v Speaker 1>So when you were teaching that you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I had an opportunity,</v>

2702
02:02:04.901 --> 02:02:09.901
<v Speaker 1>I was felt like I had an opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>show somebody something that can change </v>

2703
02:02:09.901 --> 02:02:11.540
<v Speaker 1>their life and I'll show you what </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed my life.</v>

2704
02:02:11.570 --> 02:02:12.980
<v Speaker 1>I'll show it to you and you can do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

2705
02:02:12.981 --> 02:02:17.981
<v Speaker 1>And it'll change your life to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will literally become a different </v>

2706
02:02:17.981 --> 02:02:17.981
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2707
02:02:17.981 --> 02:02:22.930
<v Speaker 4>I taught fourth grade and now those kids</v>
<v Speaker 4>are grown up and that's really cool </v>

2708
02:02:23.150 --> 02:02:25.790
<v Speaker 4>because some of them told me it was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>best year of their lives.</v>

2709
02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:28.190
<v Speaker 4>They come to see me do stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2710
02:02:28.191 --> 02:02:29.270
<v Speaker 4>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very cool.</v>

2711
02:02:29.271 --> 02:02:32.140
<v Speaker 4>Will you teach and what grade to you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know everything but oh,</v>

2712
02:02:32.141 --> 02:02:34.550
<v Speaker 4>fourth grade is different than science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything.</v>

2713
02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:35.210
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2714
02:02:35.211 --> 02:02:40.211
<v Speaker 4>it's different than what you did because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you went to people who had like an </v>

2715
02:02:40.211 --> 02:02:42.820
<v Speaker 4>interest and a love for something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when did the explorer you were,</v>

2716
02:02:42.830 --> 02:02:44.390
<v Speaker 4>you were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But mine is different.</v>

2717
02:02:44.391 --> 02:02:47.740
<v Speaker 4>They had to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my thing was self doubt,</v>

2718
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:52.750
<v Speaker 4>self esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I figured I can't teach these subjects </v>

2719
02:02:52.750 --> 02:02:55.781
<v Speaker 4>are going to come and go in their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but teaching them self esteem and some </v>

2720
02:02:55.781 --> 02:02:57.420
<v Speaker 4>of the most rewarding things where like </v>
<v Speaker 4>I had this one kid who was real shy,</v>

2721
02:02:57.421 --> 02:02:58.340
<v Speaker 4>he was so shy.</v>

2722
02:02:58.430 --> 02:03:00.830
<v Speaker 4>He was real tall and he was embarrassed </v>
<v Speaker 4>by it.</v>

2723
02:03:01.310 --> 02:03:03.110
<v Speaker 4>And he would stay in the car and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cloak,</v>

2724
02:03:03.380 --> 02:03:05.210
<v Speaker 4>cloak room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd call it a,</v>

2725
02:03:05.220 --> 02:03:10.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're all the coats and they just stay </v>

2726
02:03:10.220 --> 02:03:10.220
<v Speaker 4>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It won't come out.</v>

2727
02:03:10.220 --> 02:03:12.671
<v Speaker 4>I go sky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sky King because he was a space cadet </v>

2728
02:03:12.671 --> 02:03:12.671
<v Speaker 4>goes sky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to come out,</v>

2729
02:03:12.671 --> 02:03:14.960
<v Speaker 4>you can't stay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't let a kid just sitting,</v>

2730
02:03:14.990 --> 02:03:19.990
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by the end of me just like work in </v>

2731
02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:22.550
<v Speaker 4>his self esteem and all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was in the middle of the class,</v>

2732
02:03:22.610 --> 02:03:24.500
<v Speaker 4>just what everybody else waving his </v>
<v Speaker 4>hand.</v>

2733
02:03:24.510 --> 02:03:29.510
<v Speaker 4>And his mother came up to me and she was</v>
<v Speaker 4>really touched by it and told me that I </v>

2734
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:31.850
<v Speaker 4>changed his life and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of Shit's cool.</v>

2735
02:03:31.851 --> 02:03:34.790
<v Speaker 4>And now I got a couple of the girls come</v>
<v Speaker 4>to see me and she goes,</v>

2736
02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:40.060
<v Speaker 4>one of the girls goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ms Dot Turner or why did you let us do </v>

2737
02:03:40.060 --> 02:03:40.060
<v Speaker 4>so much stuff?</v>

2738
02:03:40.060 --> 02:03:40.730
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

2739
02:03:40.731 --> 02:03:43.590
<v Speaker 4>because you were smarter than me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said she'd go with me.</v>

2740
02:03:43.591 --> 02:03:44.120
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2741
02:03:44.121 --> 02:03:44.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2742
02:03:44.590 --> 02:03:46.370
<v Speaker 4>I had more knowledge because I was an </v>
<v Speaker 4>adult.</v>

2743
02:03:46.371 --> 02:03:48.680
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids love of you have more brainpower to</v>

2744
02:03:48.681 --> 02:03:51.470

2745
02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:53.240
<v Speaker 4>I was smart enough to know that I </v>

02:07:38.020 --> 02:07:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I was only like 27 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know shit and maybe you should </v>

2840

<v Speaker 1>be clean like that was back in the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>where everybody should be clean,</v>

2841
02:07:43.970 --> 02:07:45.520
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd done some clean sets,</v>

2842
02:07:45.521 --> 02:07:47.160
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he asked me to do what I think I,</v>

2843
02:07:47.180 --> 02:07:49.840
<v Speaker 1>he asked me to do one clean set for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I did a clean set at like,</v>

2844
02:07:49.841 --> 02:07:52.500
<v Speaker 1>catch a rising star.</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fascinating place to live.</v>

2850
02:08:05.140 --> 02:08:07.570
<v Speaker 1>And there was a dude named George Gallo </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you remember him,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this thing where he would do a reverse </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit with a banana to,</v>

2853

<v Speaker 1>I guess he would like put the banana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fully formed on his lips then suck </v>
