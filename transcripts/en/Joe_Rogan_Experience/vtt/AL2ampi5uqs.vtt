WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.210
And boom,
we're live.
What's up?
What's up?
What's up?

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.530
Suddenly like pressure when you said it just like chilling here for a minute.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.890
I should take these off as well.

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.720
You guys don't have mon Jamie and let us know if you can't hear us.

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.790
So a admin and Rhonda,
welcome.
What's up?
Welcome to uh,
humble abode.

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.480
I like the new place.
It's been a minute.
Yeah,
it's been a while.

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.890
The last time we did a podcast you weren't even in the UFC yet.

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.490
I hadn't even fought for us going to fight for the district,

9
00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:32.730
for his title the first time they came on.
Is that really that long ago.
Wow.

10
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:36.870
That's crazy.
Yeah.
I got you the Cognac.

11
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.100
It's mad at Jamie.
It's good.
We're good.
That's right.
That's right.

12
00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:43.680
Armenian Cognac.
It's fucked up.

13
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.820
You guys are a very interesting combination.
Before this even got started,

14
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:54.720
I have to tell her buddy Edmunds over here.
Rhonda is over here.
Get over here.

15
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:59.460
Get closer.
He can't be that far from me.
I don't know why.
It's crazy.

16
00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:01.380
All the hit him at all times.
Is that what it is?

17
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.160
Like my distance with him at all times.
What do you want to touch them?

18
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:07.620
You want them right there?
You guys are very close.

19
00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:11.070
You have a very unusual relationship.
It wasn't always like that though.
No,

20
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.720
it was very like Clint Eastwood,
Hilary Swank in million dollar baby status.

21
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.050
I was like very good chicken or the gym.

22
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.020
Would all the Armenian guys stay away from me?
You know

23
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.810
I love Armenians.

24
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.980
One of the reasons why I love Armenians cause they're unapologetically masculine

25
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.920
ditch,
very few unapologetically masculine cultures left in America.

26
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.900
Like people are like apologizing for being men and Armenians don't play that

27
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:40.920
Shit.
This is a,

28
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:45.480
it's a fun culture that's very interesting masculine but they are not afraid to

29
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:46.320
accessorize

30
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.970
every like I'm not a shiny shit is always like dissolved because of designer

31
00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:06.240
Cologne,
you know?
No socks now.
That's the thing.
Now they wear the shoes.
No socks.

32
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:07.230
They're very fashionable.

33
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:11.910
They had to get me to actually start like cleaning up a little bit.
Really?
Yeah.

34
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:13.710
It was the reverse.
Like they had to like,

35
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.610
they had to make me over when I first started coming.
So what was their advice?

36
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.930
Um,
well I used to be that I had this car,

37
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:26.130
the Fonda was my Honda and it had one working window and no air conditioning.

38
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.430
So I would just sweat all the way home.
So I would just put on my same,

39
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.010
like my clothes I came in with when they're like no shower.

40
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.500
I would just throw it on still sweating,

41
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.660
jump in my car cause I would just want to let homeless the point and Edmunds,

42
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:40.650
first word of advice was he made me shower before I got in the car.

43
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:43.590
Even if I would set all the way home and have the shower again,
that was like,

44
00:02:43.591 --> 00:02:47.070
he was like,
no,
not on the job.
And I know you're know you're a very good girl.
And

45
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.420
she went away.
Like I taught him English.

46
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.690
You speak to high school?
Yeah.
But during the classes like Armenian,

47
00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:00.040
Armenian kids have to grow up.
You know,
the parents loved

48
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.910
<v 1>it because they go to school,</v>

49
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:04.780
speak English and the parents would bring them to the gym after school programs

50
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:08.410
and they would want their kids to speak Armenian so they won't forget where

51
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:12.530
they're from.
You know?
And so teaching for like 10 years,
every day,

52
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.360
four to 10 I was like only speaking Armenian and then I like couldn't speak
well.

53
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:19.510
Like I was like,
well what's happening here?
I forgot my English or something.

54
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.890
<v 0>Yeah,
they brought it back.
He was the one too after.</v>

55
00:03:22.891 --> 00:03:24.840
I like want a couple of fights.
It was like a no,

56
00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:28.130
maybe you should wear look that gets a little pretty some time.
Put some,
make

57
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.270
you bad thing and like,
yeah that was all like,
like hell.

58
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:37.480
Trying to get me to the girly.
I've a little bit cause yeah,

59
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:39.960
I was a lot grungier when I first started coming to the show.

60
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.000
<v 2>That's such a,</v>

61
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.450
you're such a fascinating contradiction in that way because when you clean up,

62
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.170
you know you're beautiful,
you clean up your a 10 but you're,
you're,

63
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.250
you don't give a fuck

64
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.590
<v 0>around.
Like putting like,
you know,</v>

65
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.160
we're going all out all the time because then you can't step it up when it's

66
00:03:56.161 --> 00:03:59.640
time to step it up.
Like,
oh I want to be able to have like my,

67
00:03:59.641 --> 00:04:03.780
she's all that like unveiling moment whenever I feel like it.
Oh I see.

68
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.060
<v 2>And so some girl,
the other girls didn't do it the other way.</v>

69
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.420
Like they're oh they,

70
00:04:08.421 --> 00:04:11.920
they literally can't not be made up when they leave the house.

71
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:15.580
They fucking panic.
I understand that.
Like I like my face.

72
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.840
You have a beautiful face.
I'm saying like I should spend my time like you know,

73
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:21.990
paranoid to show people in the actual face looks like.
Yeah.

74
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.890
That's a weird thing with women.
We've,
with the,

75
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.550
our culture is decided that women have to have like unusual,

76
00:04:27.551 --> 00:04:30.790
unnatural colors over their eyes.
Your lips have to like,

77
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.730
this is where I suck the dirt.

78
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.300
So happening right here,

79
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.280
<v 0>me don't you want to get in there.</v>

80
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.450
How do you see like those contouring videos and stuff like that or like what is

81
00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:44.990
that?

82
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.230
You have to find these contouring things where it starts with a girl with her

83
00:04:48.231 --> 00:04:52.400
face plane and they do all this contour stuff to them and like they're an

84
00:04:52.401 --> 00:04:55.590
entirely different person by the end of it.
That's so weird.
Yeah.

85
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.310
I saw like this one thing,
I dunno,

86
00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.530
it was like an Instagram for so who knows if it wasn't even true,
but some,

87
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.700
some guy sued his wife after they were married because he never saw her without

88
00:05:04.701 --> 00:05:09.620
makeup.
She was totally busted without it.
It doesn't make it.

89
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.600
<v 2>There was one about a Chinese guy who sued his wife because she had a gang of</v>

90
00:05:14.601 --> 00:05:16.550
plastic surgery in the kids came out ugly.

91
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.460
But I don't think that was really there.
I think,
you know,
opened my eyes.

92
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.870
<v 0>Not a lot like whenever like I see people like it's like like a good looking</v>

93
00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:29.400
couple,
but they got butt ugly kids that,
you know,
it's just like the work done.

94
00:05:29.401 --> 00:05:31.470
You know,
you can't,
you can't get your genetics lifted.

95
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.351
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

96
00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:36.700
It is a weird thing were like Koreans have like a real issue in their culture

97
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:40.900
where they get their eyes.
It's so common that a lot of girls,

98
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.250
like there's very few natural eyes left.

99
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.140
It's like everyone gets their eyes done.
It's like shooting.
They graduate,

100
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.420
they get their eyes change.

101
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.330
Koreans have naturally like a thin opening for their eye.
Will they get there?

102
00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:57.980
Like eyelids,
they get surgery done and their eyes

103
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.740
<v 0>are poker and how all that's fucking crazy.
Yeah,
Jamie,
pull it up so he could,</v>

104
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:03.950
she,
you guys can see it

105
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.190
<v 2>strict,
but it's extremely common.</v>

106
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.550
Like as common is probably more common than braces are here.

107
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:11.870
Like look what's going on.

108
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.320
<v 0>It's men.
WHOA character.
Look at those eyes.</v>

109
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.410
<v 2>Look at that.
Okay.
Look at those two.
Well,
one of them looks like she's eight.</v>

110
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.010
That's not fair.
But it's,
it's a very,
very,

111
00:06:29.011 --> 00:06:31.690
very common procedure over there to the point where,
so

112
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.990
<v 0>these girls,
she's in the corners of her eyes.
It looks like it does it yet.
Oh</v>

113
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.320
<v 2>yeah,
yeah.
Oh,
that's exactly what it is.
Oh Jesus.
Oh,</v>

114
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.490
extremely.
Extremely common.
They do all sorts of other weird shit too.

115
00:06:46.491 --> 00:06:50.480
Like they put Chin implants in them.
Look at that girl,
had her chin shaved down.

116
00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:51.890
Like,
okay,
there's perfect.

117
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.730
The one on the left that looks like big foot silver sister and the one on the

118
00:06:55.731 --> 00:07:00.620
right is a 10 so like what happened there?
Well,
they shaved her down.

119
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.480
They uh,
wow.
She looks like a Gnocchi sister.
That's what she looks like.
Oh,

120
00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:10.160
Antonio Enoki the guy who fought Muhammad Ali.
That's what she looks like,
right?

121
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.690
Not,
not in the,
it's a bad thing.
Look,
they fixed it.
So great.
Now congratulations.

122
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.120
I bet that girl went on a dick ramp.

123
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.620
<v 0>Paige after she got that done.
I should probably do,
you know,</v>

124
00:07:20.621 --> 00:07:24.730
because before everyone else like not really interested and then Bam,

125
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.240
the girl on the right.
Holy Shit.
It was

126
00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:33.110
<v 2>Leo swarm,
you know?
But that's super common.
Wow.</v>

127
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.260
It's weird.
It's weird because it's,

128
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.070
it's not in your DNA and so like your children are going to have to deal with

129
00:07:39.071 --> 00:07:42.550
the same issues like your whatever weird jaw structure thing.

130
00:07:42.551 --> 00:07:45.430
No structure thing that you're going to get fixed with a doctor.

131
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.810
I'm going to get your kids snip too.
You know,
I don't know.
I just,

132
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.660
I'm not like a big cosmetic surgery type of person,

133
00:07:55.661 --> 00:08:00.420
you know that is your face and like,
yeah,
cool with it.
Yeah.

134
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.140
But what if you have like some goofy,

135
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.410
you know like there was a girl I went to school with in high school.

136
00:08:05.411 --> 00:08:08.830
She had a big crazy knows she's a nice girl but it was like crazy like wicked

137
00:08:08.831 --> 00:08:09.880
witch of the West type shit.

138
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.240
She had like a crazy hump and then she got it removed.

139
00:08:13.241 --> 00:08:15.970
She got her nose fixed and all of a sudden she was hot as fuck.

140
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:20.140
And everybody was like,
what happened as Susan like damn this is,
it's weird.

141
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.710
<v 0>It's like this way and people,
there's nothing wrong with,</v>

142
00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:24.020
I'm like the chick from dirty dancing.
I was absolutely gorgeous.

143
00:08:24.021 --> 00:08:26.840
You've got her nose dive.
Then it was like no one could recognize her.

144
00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:27.980
She never could get a part again.

145
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.220
That's weird because you become famous for that look.

146
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.340
And then like the other girl who did that recent Renee Zellweger,

147
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.410
she did it recently.
She's unrecognizable.
Yeah,
she is gorgeous.

148
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.860
I think that it feels like a line like you know,

149
00:08:39.861 --> 00:08:43.200
if you have like a cleft lip or something like wrong with you,
you know go,

150
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:44.210
you know,
go for it.

151
00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:48.530
But like if you just self conscious you know about something and then

152
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.470
<v 2>you know,
maybe you should just accept it that that's how he look.
You know,</v>

153
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.890
I think the stars if they're on TV the time,
you know

154
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.120
<v 3>already people get used to that look so they shouldn't be that worried about it.</v>

155
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.900
Well it's also like if you're on television,
that's your currency.

156
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.480
Like your currency is your appearance,
you know,

157
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:09.600
and and just re relinquishing any aspect of that.

158
00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.890
They think like the whole reason they got there is because there looks like

159
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:16.800
there's a lot of people that believe that.
But I mean like when you're a kid,

160
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.560
you went to area high school,
your teenager,

161
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:23.370
you're going to hate everything pretty much about yourself for awhile.
You know,

162
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.130
you're like,
Oh God,
yeah,
you're suddenly super self conscious.
But all of that,

163
00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:27.960
and if it's like so common,
easily accessible,

164
00:09:27.961 --> 00:09:30.570
people are going to end up getting so much work done when they're kids and

165
00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:33.720
they're just being going through that stage when you know you should at least

166
00:09:33.721 --> 00:09:36.780
wait until you're like pass 30 and you're like,
you know,

167
00:09:36.781 --> 00:09:39.480
you've had a good three decades of not being happy with how that looks,

168
00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:43.140
then okay fine,
go for it.
But if you're a teenager and you're like,
oh my God,

169
00:09:43.141 --> 00:09:46.170
my finance and has big boobs and I want to get implants,
like,
no,
don't do it.

170
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:49.320
Okay,
you're 18 you'll,
you'll get over it,
you'll,
you'll,
you'll accept that.

171
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.900
You know,
it'd be a titty committee is pretty cool,

172
00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.400
but you are,
you're,

173
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.040
you're doing something right now with this whole,

174
00:09:59.041 --> 00:10:03.830
don't be a do nothing bitch thing.
Are you aware of like how big this movement,

175
00:10:03.831 --> 00:10:08.100
and I tweeted about it the other day that I was,
I forgot where I was,

176
00:10:08.101 --> 00:10:11.250
but these two girls were arguing about the merits,

177
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.440
pros and cons of being a do nothing bitch.
And it was completely,

178
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:20.460
it was all after your fight.
And it was this completely brought on by you.

179
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.070
Like some girls were like,
well listen,
you know,

180
00:10:23.071 --> 00:10:25.530
like I don't like to fucking work,
you know,
I don't want,
I don't want to,

181
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.470
you know,
what's wrong with being a do nothing bitch.
And the other girl was like,

182
00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:32.290
no,
she's fucking right.
You know,
like too many girls are out there doing his,

183
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.670
he just contributed nothing to society like you are you like all you do is

184
00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:38.040
consume.
If you are do nothing,
bitch,

185
00:10:38.041 --> 00:10:40.950
all you do is spend somebody else's money and try to look pretty.

186
00:10:40.951 --> 00:10:43.200
Like that's all you do is you use stuff up,

187
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.480
you use up resources and you give nothing.

188
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.160
And so you're a pretty much a drain on society.
That's what I think they,

189
00:10:50.161 --> 00:10:51.510
they don't think it that way.

190
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:56.040
They think what they are is something that all of these men want to fuck low.

191
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:59.700
So in,
in working really hard to attain this,

192
00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:05.160
this appearance and all these men want to fuck that.
Uh,
the what they are,

193
00:11:05.161 --> 00:11:08.060
they've,
they've created capital.
They've created like a,

194
00:11:08.061 --> 00:11:13.061
a need for this brought up to think that it wasn't your mission in life to be

195
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:14.011
happy.

196
00:11:14.011 --> 00:11:17.400
It was your mission in life to leave the world better than how you found it.

197
00:11:17.401 --> 00:11:19.350
And by being a comeback at,
you're not going to do that.

198
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.990
It's not your mission in life.

199
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.700
I guess I invented that.
No,
I did it.

200
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.630
That's a fascinating thing to say that it's not your mission in life to be
happy.

201
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.740
So,
but what's the point in leaving the world better?
If no one's happy,

202
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.020
if everybody follows that same principle,

203
00:11:40.021 --> 00:11:42.570
the world just keeps getting better and better and everybody's miserable as
fuck.

204
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.920
I think your,
your happiness,

205
00:11:46.921 --> 00:11:50.580
it's supposed to be a byproduct of actually living a fulfilling life.
You know,

206
00:11:50.581 --> 00:11:52.700
instead of just trying to,
you know,

207
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.540
if I tried to get drunk and party every day and get as happy as I possibly could

208
00:11:55.541 --> 00:11:56.980
every day,
you know,

209
00:11:56.981 --> 00:12:01.300
I'm going to live at a really unfulfilling life and die unhappy,
but does that,

210
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:06.240
where happiness comes from,
like the reality of happiness is happiness comes in,

211
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:07.480
at least in my feeling,

212
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.370
it comes from achieving goals and conquering whatever weird shit you don't like

213
00:12:12.371 --> 00:12:14.730
about yourself.
Like whatever weird,
uh,

214
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.240
discipline issues you might have or behavior issues you might have and

215
00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:21.910
accomplishing goals.
Like there's something about setting goals,

216
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.330
working hard on something and accomplishing those things.

217
00:12:24.331 --> 00:12:28.240
It creates a real happiness.
The other,
the other kind of happened has,

218
00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:32.440
comes from family and friends and loved ones.
That's,
that's the other happiness.

219
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:34.280
I mean,
I,

220
00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.330
I think it's also about not being selfish and thinking about your kids too,

221
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.940
because we could all be as happy as possible.
You know,

222
00:12:39.941 --> 00:12:43.180
this generation burn every resource we have and all of our kids are going to

223
00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:44.530
starve,
you know,

224
00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:48.400
and some post apocalyptic world because everybody before I was just trying to be

225
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:52.660
happy,
you know,
and like that's not really a good way to live either.

226
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.370
Yeah.
I like,
I want my,

227
00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:57.420
I want to know that my kids are going to be all right and they're live in

228
00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:58.840
growing up in a better world than I did.

229
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.910
That's gonna make me happier than knowing that I had a great time and good luck

230
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:06.580
kitties.
So the way you do that is by telling chicks and not be a good nut.

231
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:10.360
Don't be a do nothing bitch.
And definitely don't want my kids to be

232
00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.300
well I don't think that they will be.

233
00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:19.740
It'll be a real issue growing up in the rousy household being your mom wrote a

234
00:13:20.471 --> 00:13:24.850
fucking hilarious blog the other day about sycophants,

235
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:30.040
you know,
did you read that?
My mom is,
she's a blog master.
She's a character.

236
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:34.030
If you know,
he'd be like,
you really know my mother.
You understand?

237
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.140
Most of me cause she is like,
I need to get her in here.

238
00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:41.590
Your mom is so powerful.
She's,
yeah she's,

239
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.280
there's some about your mom like just talking to her,
you go whoa,

240
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:45.700
this is a powerful woman.

241
00:13:45.701 --> 00:13:49.630
Like she's got to think like I was so like laid back and chill and like,

242
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:53.290
you know my mom was like the really just really intense and then I realized this

243
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.580
in comparison to her,

244
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.220
I was really laid back and chill and I'm actually pretty intense.

245
00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.970
I was surprised.
It was like,
you're so intense.
Like what are you talking about?

246
00:14:00.971 --> 00:14:04.040
And that Schuelke who won.
It's all relative.
It's all relative.

247
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:05.770
Hang out with my mom and be like,
whoa.
I'm like,

248
00:14:05.771 --> 00:14:07.510
I don't know how you are as chill as you are.

249
00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:11.920
The standards are set so high in your house that just being like what you

250
00:14:11.921 --> 00:14:14.800
thought was chill in your house.
Everybody else was like,
whoa.

251
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.610
I mean like I was like the black sheep loser in my house for like a long time.

252
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.410
Cause you were a loser.
Yeah.

253
00:14:20.411 --> 00:14:23.770
Cause everybody else is like bachelor's and master's degrees and they're like,

254
00:14:23.771 --> 00:14:27.930
you know,
like average was below like below average.

255
00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.800
Exceptional was average in our family.

256
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.970
The rule was you could pick anything you wanted to do in the world but you just

257
00:14:33.971 --> 00:14:37.540
had to be the best in the world at it.
Just like you don't,

258
00:14:37.541 --> 00:14:39.190
you don't have to pick one specific thing,

259
00:14:39.191 --> 00:14:41.320
but you just have to be the best in the world at it.
Fuck,

260
00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:45.070
that's a lot of pressure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
When you're a kid.
But you know what,

261
00:14:45.071 --> 00:14:48.640
now I'm happy for it because now I'm in high pressure situations all the time

262
00:14:48.641 --> 00:14:49.620
and I can totally deal with it.

263
00:14:49.621 --> 00:14:52.100
I mean now I'm live on the Joe Rogan and I'm sure my

264
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.270
<v 0>heart rate is perfectly fine.</v>

265
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:56.630
Well this is a very low pressure situation to Brazil.

266
00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.720
Well I'm sure it was some people listening right now if they got on,

267
00:14:59.721 --> 00:15:01.310
you know they'd have a hard time relaxing.

268
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:02.960
Like my first time that I came on your show,

269
00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:06.170
I was a little bit like amped up because I would watch it all the time and I was

270
00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:08.720
a fan.
Like I would go to training,
I would come home and I would make,

271
00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.840
I got to the point where I could afford trader Joe's at that point.

272
00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.870
So I was like made myself a sandwich at trader Joe's and I would like sit and

273
00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:18.290
eat my sandwich and listened to you every day.
Well,
if I remember correctly,

274
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.370
<v 2>we might have been medicated at the time as well.
Yeah,</v>

275
00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.050
it might've been some plant burning going on.

276
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.410
Speaking of Brazil,
like dad experience,

277
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.850
to me that was one of the strangest experiences of all my years of calling

278
00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:35.241
fights.

279
00:15:35.241 --> 00:15:39.740
It was one of the strangest experiences because it had sort of transcended just

280
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:43.970
fighting.
It had gotten into this weird cultural place.

281
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.880
Like when we first of all went there,
um,

282
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.390
it was the first time I sat in the audience for Whanau never sat in the audience

283
00:15:50.391 --> 00:15:52.220
for women before.
But when we got there,

284
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.060
they had some dude that was a Brazilian guy that was going to do the weigh ins

285
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.880
because they wanted it to be in Portuguese.
So,
uh,

286
00:15:58.881 --> 00:16:01.190
I sat down in the front row and I got to watch him.

287
00:16:01.191 --> 00:16:04.940
One of the freakiest things about it was it was the first time ever to all the

288
00:16:04.941 --> 00:16:09.650
fights that I've ever called in Brazil where the Brazilian got booed and the

289
00:16:09.651 --> 00:16:12.200
American gut cheered and I was like,

290
00:16:12.201 --> 00:16:16.670
this is a where we've hit some weird tipping point here.
And I was kind of a,

291
00:16:16.671 --> 00:16:19.970
it was a strange to observe that.
I was like,
when you went on stage,

292
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.370
they were cheering you and you know,

293
00:16:22.371 --> 00:16:25.850
she's like got the Brazilian flag and she's getting fucking crazy and she's

294
00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:29.720
tried to get everybody on her side and they were like,
hmm,
that's not,

295
00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.593
we're here for,

296
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.310
<v 0>we're here for the Ronda Rousey show.</v>

297
00:16:32.311 --> 00:16:34.460
She's trying really hard to pull that angle.

298
00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:37.620
She bought the resilient flag everywhere.
She flew with it and the plains,

299
00:16:37.621 --> 00:16:40.100
you've got the plane with it.
I mean,
I'm sure she went to the bathroom with it.

300
00:16:40.101 --> 00:16:43.790
Like I did never saw her without that flag.
But I mean,

301
00:16:43.791 --> 00:16:48.440
they throw it on the ground when you're walking in and her brother like takes

302
00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:52.610
the flag and throws it at my face when I'm walking in and I'm like,
okay,

303
00:16:52.611 --> 00:16:55.100
it's cool for you to be patriotic and proud of your country,
but you're like,

304
00:16:55.101 --> 00:16:57.360
you don't throw your flag on the ground.
Yeah.

305
00:16:57.361 --> 00:17:01.570
That's disrespectful to your country.
Yeah,
exactly.
Oh my God.
So headwinds,

306
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.840
not going to say this,
but like,
okay,
this her brother,
the guy with like her,

307
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.670
she had a brother who was like blue hair.
I don't know,

308
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.800
like he was going to be shit on Instagram for like a month.

309
00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:13.700
He was harassing Edmund all over his Instagram.
Right.
And causing Edwin's like,

310
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.540
just you wait,
when I get done with this,
when you beat her ass,
I'm going to buy,

311
00:17:17.541 --> 00:17:20.900
I didn't have it that wanting to tell him.
I'm like,
okay,
okay.
So yeah,

312
00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.340
cause that's at a mistake.
He like gets riled up.
And,
uh,

313
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:30.220
so,
um,
then we get there and she,
he's like wearing like these,

314
00:17:30.221 --> 00:17:33.290
these pink shirts and he was outside when we're leaving the bus and being like,

315
00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:36.290
you know,
fuck you Dah Dah and like a pink shirt.
And I'm like,
aw,

316
00:17:36.291 --> 00:17:38.570
look at you like,
you know,
saying fucking pink.
That's cute.

317
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.090
So then I'm walking out,

318
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.570
the guy throws the Brazilian flag on my face,

319
00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:48.860
Edmond almost like start something right then,
but I'm about to walk out of the,

320
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.350
I could tell that he's like restraining himself.
He's like,
he's almost just like,

321
00:17:52.351 --> 00:17:54.990
I'm going to see you later kind of thing and like cuts it off,

322
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.470
which I appreciate that self control at the moment.
Yeah.

323
00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.930
So if you watch in the background,

324
00:18:00.931 --> 00:18:04.160
I put like that don't cry like clip on my Instagram.
Right.

325
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:08.010
If you look in the background,
her face hits the mat.

326
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:09.930
Edelman does not celebrate.

327
00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.510
The first thing he does is he turns around and runs straight at that dude.

328
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.740
Her brother,
he doesn't go Yay.

329
00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:19.440
It was almost like he was sitting there the whole time waiting for me to knock

330
00:18:19.441 --> 00:18:21.780
around just so he could go and give this guy shit.

331
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.630
It wasn't like he was waiting for me and for wind,
so it can be happy.

332
00:18:24.631 --> 00:18:28.500
You'd be like,
hurry up.
Not just my job.
I gotta go get after this fucking guy.

333
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.950
He's mine sites.
I'm still talking to watch over and over.

334
00:18:31.951 --> 00:18:35.490
Edmund goes off the chair,
runs straight to the dude,
like not even,

335
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:36.750
you couldn't even smile.

336
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.920
It was whole happiest watch over and over and over do this.

337
00:18:40.921 --> 00:18:42.290
And you see like the little gold drowsy,

338
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.930
like balancing away and he's like running up the fans.
Brazilian.
Yeah.

339
00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.260
<v 3>Fans that loves around there.
Right.</v>

340
00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:49.570
You saw it and their whole family just comes to all the fights and he has,

341
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.380
he's literally standing like right behind that dude.
And he has it recorded.

342
00:18:53.381 --> 00:18:55.930
So they gave me through his phone,
you know,
he gave it to me.

343
00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:59.260
Did you see the flag?
He gets it and throws it on.
I'm like,
you stupid.
Fuck.

344
00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:03.250
Keep your,
you know,
it's your country's flag.
I do.
What happened afterward though,

345
00:19:03.251 --> 00:19:06.820
I only saw you running away towards him.
Like what happened when you got on it?

346
00:19:06.821 --> 00:19:07.870
I want it to grab him at,

347
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:12.760
went in and everybody helped me back called the security that holds the whole

348
00:19:12.761 --> 00:19:14.560
event was so intense when she,

349
00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.440
when she face planted right on the straight outta Compton.

350
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.800
<v 0>Oh my God.
What was that meme</v>

351
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.510
things afterward in data showed it to me.
I'm like,
ah,

352
00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.920
<v 3>you stood over insert and said don't cry.</v>

353
00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.740
Well cause that's what she was saying in the way,
and she's in my face going,

354
00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.730
<v 0>I those guys like she was before,
she knows y'all thing.</v>

355
00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:40.210
<v 3>He's at me and I'd be like,
okay,
you know.
So at the Wayne,</v>

356
00:19:40.211 --> 00:19:41.540
she was speaking English to you.
She's,

357
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:44.110
that's what is the only thing she ever said to me in English was don't cry.

358
00:19:44.111 --> 00:19:45.660
Don't cry over and over and over.

359
00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.350
So then like right when I knocked her out and I like and get to fixed my short,

360
00:19:48.351 --> 00:19:48.670
it sounds like,

361
00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:53.200
<v 0>oh yeah,
don't cry.
What makes you think of those things at that moment?</v>

362
00:19:53.201 --> 00:19:57.580
I don't know.
That's like the most like income came comprehensible moment ever.

363
00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.840
<v 4>That was an intense moment.
When you,</v>

364
00:19:59.841 --> 00:20:03.350
when you walked around the cage after he knocked her out.
It was,

365
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.980
it was one of,
I've seen guys when before,

366
00:20:06.981 --> 00:20:10.770
I've seen women when before I've seen people win before but I never saw anybody

367
00:20:10.771 --> 00:20:14.180
soak it all in the way.
You did when you walked around.

368
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:19.250
When she face planted you said don't cry and then you walked around like you

369
00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:21.740
strutted around the octagon.

370
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:25.220
He likes strutted and looked around at all those people you like,

371
00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:29.480
you took it all in,
you looked around you.
I was like,
wow,

372
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:31.250
this is a crazy moment.

373
00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:35.320
<v 3>Have you had it ever did?
That was the first time I did that actually.
Yeah.</v>

374
00:20:35.321 --> 00:20:37.780
I really like received it because usually it's just like,
okay,

375
00:20:37.781 --> 00:20:40.330
I beat the person and then I have to not say anything stupid.

376
00:20:40.331 --> 00:20:42.440
And then at the drug tests and do I medicals and then I had to do press

377
00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:42.661
conference.

378
00:20:42.661 --> 00:20:45.640
I don't say anything stupid again and then I can eat something and relax.

379
00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:47.920
And that was the first time I took a moment

380
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.870
<v 1>like to just like look at it all right.</v>

381
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:52.290
Because I just probably thinking I wish I fuck her up one more time.

382
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:59.510
<v 0>See what had happened to the crowd because it was interesting,
you know,
like,</v>

383
00:20:59.511 --> 00:21:02.450
cause I was getting booed a little coming in,
you know,
and um,

384
00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.760
<v 1>shot right the fuck up when you're knocked her out they cheer.</v>

385
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:08.630
<v 0>But when it turned,
yeah,
like I was,
I was looking into like,</v>

386
00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:11.870
I was this close to crying and you know,
like I'm a big time crier.

387
00:21:11.871 --> 00:21:14.550
Like I was really,
really close.
Like,
ah,
that,

388
00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:18.020
that one I'm going to remember forever.
It was definitely rocky four for sure.

389
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.080
Yeah.

390
00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.250
<v 4>Well it was also,</v>

391
00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.630
there was so much emotion attached to that because the shit that she had said

392
00:21:24.631 --> 00:21:29.120
about suicide and connecting to your father and all that shit and,

393
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.510
and you know,

394
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:35.020
and knowing you as long as I've had and having daughters and it was,

395
00:21:35.021 --> 00:21:36.330
it was so emotional for me.

396
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:41.360
That was the closest I've ever come to crime while I'm going to cry now and I

397
00:21:41.521 --> 00:21:43.860
was interviewing somebody.
It's cause it was just,

398
00:21:43.861 --> 00:21:47.700
it was so intense and it was also like I really knew that.

399
00:21:47.701 --> 00:21:50.520
I was like seeing history.
It's like it's hard.

400
00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:53.100
I know it's hard for you to probably talk about it because you're living it

401
00:21:53.101 --> 00:21:57.720
right now,
but like you're,
you're in the middle of history.
Like what,
what,

402
00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.570
what happened there and what's going on with you right now?

403
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:04.230
A gear or a part of some crazy movement right now.
It's not,

404
00:22:04.231 --> 00:22:06.480
it's not just sport.

405
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:12.030
It's like you're this very unique example for other women.

406
00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:13.950
Like that's never existed before.

407
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:18.980
There's never been a female combat sports athlete like you and when you went

408
00:22:19.201 --> 00:22:23.700
down to Brazil,
not that girl out like that.
And then we're taking it all in.

409
00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:26.070
It was,
it was so crazy.

410
00:22:26.071 --> 00:22:30.000
I was so happy for you and it was so crazy at the same time.
It was just,

411
00:22:30.001 --> 00:22:34.140
it was nuts.
The whole thing was,
it was such a strange moment.

412
00:22:34.141 --> 00:22:38.880
There was a feeling in the air and there was a recognition of what was
happening.

413
00:22:38.881 --> 00:22:42.140
That was very different for me than any other fight that I've ever called
before.

414
00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.990
<v 1>You know,
it was writing.</v>

415
00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.550
I think people just are starting to recognize how solid she is as a,
you know,

416
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:52.580
human being run.
Then every,
every opponent she's faced,

417
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:57.110
she keeps it very real,
very intelligent,
very professional.

418
00:22:57.111 --> 00:23:01.400
And how an athlete should carry themselves.
A person should carry themselves.

419
00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:06.200
If you watch all the fights,
you know,
Misha didn't behave from the beginning.

420
00:23:06.201 --> 00:23:07.940
You know,
there's a lot of things from the beginning.

421
00:23:07.941 --> 00:23:11.600
She didn't do what she was supposed to do.
Bringing her for it,
you know,

422
00:23:11.601 --> 00:23:15.860
pushing during Wayans,
stuff like that.
It's great building up,
you know,
a fight.

423
00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.620
It's normal,
it's the fight business.

424
00:23:18.621 --> 00:23:23.621
But afterwards coin complaining to the Commission to find somebody when you

425
00:23:23.661 --> 00:23:26.150
fight for living,
it's nonsense.

426
00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:29.840
Why was she saying to find her to complain to the commission so they could touch

427
00:23:29.841 --> 00:23:31.770
her purse to find her was,

428
00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:35.900
she said that she put her forehead on mine our first way in and I pushed her

429
00:23:35.901 --> 00:23:40.130
back and she said the commission should find me for headbutting her.
Yeah.

430
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:43.310
So basically they don't,
they're not real.
You don't do that.

431
00:23:43.311 --> 00:23:46.160
You don't touch somebody's finances when a fighter yourself,

432
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:50.690
<v 3>you know what I mean?
Not,
not in that way.
And every opponent,</v>

433
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.660
how respectful she was against a cat,
you know,

434
00:23:53.661 --> 00:23:55.940
even on the floor when Rhonda submitters said,
you know,

435
00:23:55.941 --> 00:23:59.630
I'll give you another chance.
You know who those two quick and she's done.

436
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:03.950
She's done an amazing job,
man.
Everybody,
I think now after 10 fights,

437
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.310
12 fights,
13,
five,
they're starting to really realize that,
well,

438
00:24:07.311 --> 00:24:08.600
I don't think we're really like,

439
00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:13.601
I don't even think I'm going to really know what is going on right now or

440
00:24:13.731 --> 00:24:17.780
realize what is going on right now until afterward,
you know,
until it's all done.

441
00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.650
And,
um,
I could just try to do the best that I can in the moment,

442
00:24:21.651 --> 00:24:25.550
but I don't really think that any of us really comprehend what's going on right

443
00:24:25.551 --> 00:24:27.350
now until we're looking at it in hindsight.

444
00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.060
And that's the kind of thing I think is kind of funny.

445
00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.630
Just there's so many people that just live to hate me,

446
00:24:32.631 --> 00:24:35.120
but when I'm gone they're going to miss me.

447
00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:38.560
<v 2>Really?
Are</v>

448
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:42.800
You keep it real and you kick everybody's ass.

449
00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.010
How are they ever going to have

450
00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:49.710
<v 3>like,
like a bad guy better than heath ledger as the joker?</v>

451
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:53.640
Like you miss them.
You need like the joker is gone like you,

452
00:24:53.641 --> 00:24:55.230
you're never going to have joker again.

453
00:24:55.950 --> 00:25:00.950
I'm saying that like I am not the protagonist and the antagonist because the

454
00:25:01.591 --> 00:25:06.450
protagonist just reacts.
They do nothing.
The whole storyline,
the whole,

455
00:25:06.451 --> 00:25:09.720
everything that goes on is completely dependent on the antagonist.

456
00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.300
I'm the one that's forcing everybody to do something.

457
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:17.630
And so like I like to think of myself as more of like the heel,

458
00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:22.230
like the bad guy that you somehow like sometimes route for you can't help out a

459
00:25:22.231 --> 00:25:23.700
little bit sometimes.
But sometimes you hate him,

460
00:25:23.701 --> 00:25:28.290
but I think that the fact that you nixed emotions come out is one of the more

461
00:25:28.291 --> 00:25:33.270
interesting things.
You know,
I'm not trying to have everyone like me.

462
00:25:33.271 --> 00:25:35.400
I'm trying to have everybody care about what I'm doing.

463
00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:41.350
<v 2>When when you beat me Hsa and the audience was booing,</v>

464
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:46.810
do remember that.
Yeah,
that Shit's all gone.
Like nobody,
nobody,

465
00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.480
nobody remembers that.
It'll come back.
It'll come back because,

466
00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.320
yeah,
because I wouldn't shake her hand

467
00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.960
<v 3>because it would,</v>

468
00:25:57.961 --> 00:26:02.961
it was a t entirely dis and genuine gesture for her to offer a handshake because

469
00:26:03.541 --> 00:26:06.690
she never would have offered a handshake if she wasn't being watched by millions

470
00:26:06.691 --> 00:26:07.524
of people.

471
00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.920
And I wouldn't have shook her hand if we were alone in the room where we had

472
00:26:10.921 --> 00:26:11.940
millions of people watching.

473
00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:17.240
And the fact that I'm not going to play to the crowd for fee like to have the

474
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.870
light would've been so easy.
You just shake your hand,
have everybody cheer.

475
00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:25.800
But I felt like it would have been dishonest.
And you know,

476
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:31.050
honesty pays,
but it pays very slowly and it doesn't pay very consistently.

477
00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.620
<v 2>Do you think that she was being honest when she shook her head?</v>

478
00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.850
Is it possible that she was being honest when she went to shake your hand?

479
00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:43.380
Is it possible that all the anxiety and all the,

480
00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:44.683
all,

481
00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:49.710
<v 3>all the animosity that she had went away when you guys fought?
No,
not at all.</v>

482
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:50.401
Not Possible.

483
00:26:50.401 --> 00:26:55.401
She insulted and really did some very shady backhanded,

484
00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.050
you know,

485
00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:02.640
backstage things to people that really love and care about without apologizing.

486
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:06.450
I didn't see his older.
Yeah,
they didn't see or what,
like what kind of stuff?

487
00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.950
Like,
um,
one example at the ultimate fighter,

488
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.420
Chris Bill is about to go out and fight and he's all warmed up.

489
00:27:15.421 --> 00:27:17.580
He's ready to go and literally like two minutes before it goes out,

490
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:21.780
Dana walks in and goes,
you're assigned with that promotion.
And he's,
he's like,

491
00:27:21.781 --> 00:27:25.860
what?
And he's like,
your other promoter just called like,

492
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:30.150
we're pulling you out of this fight,
all this stuff to the,
yeah.

493
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.380
And it's a closed set.

494
00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.840
No one's supposed to even know that he's on the ultimate fighter.

495
00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:38.280
And how would this other promoter even know that he was about to fight in two

496
00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:43.281
minutes and who would benefit from that kind of timing and things like that.

497
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.200
Like he would say it to,
he said it to other people in the house,

498
00:27:46.201 --> 00:27:48.450
so they knew and the other team knew that it was at that promoter.

499
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:52.230
But how would the promoter know to call right before he's about to walk out to

500
00:27:52.231 --> 00:27:53.160
mess with them the most?

501
00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:54.980
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

502
00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:58.940
<v 3>because of Misha,
because somebody tipped them off because it was timed.</v>

503
00:27:58.941 --> 00:28:00.620
It was pretty,
I don't believe in coincidences.

504
00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:02.930
There's no way that that was a coincidence.

505
00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:06.900
So he was signed with another promoter and I think like he,

506
00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:10.700
he had a contract,
but like he hadn't fought in so long.
He was supposed to,

507
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:13.850
the contract are supposed to default if they hadn't had him fight within that

508
00:28:13.851 --> 00:28:15.110
amount of time.
So he was out of it,

509
00:28:15.111 --> 00:28:19.460
but it was like some sort of messy contract situation or whatever.
But um,

510
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.440
he like mentioned it to,
you know,

511
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:25.130
to the other kids and it got back to their team and,

512
00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.500
and they called.
And,
um,

513
00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:31.590
set this up so that they would call right at the exact time.

514
00:28:31.591 --> 00:28:35.430
He's not to go out and try to get Chris Beall pulled out or at least mess with

515
00:28:35.431 --> 00:28:38.220
him enough to like have him not be fresh when you went in.

516
00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.820
And so you're pretty sure that that was me.
She's doing who else is,
would it be,

517
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.120
who else would benefit from that?
He's always had access to phones.

518
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:47.910
Was that the only thing [inaudible] that's true.

519
00:28:47.911 --> 00:28:50.970
Who else would have access to a phone?
Right?
Yeah.
That's not the only thing.

520
00:28:50.971 --> 00:28:53.200
That's one small example.
I of very many.
And,
and

521
00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:55.500
<v 6>do you know what?
I just don't even want to like get into it.</v>

522
00:28:55.501 --> 00:28:58.620
I was like moved on with my life.
I just not,
not keeping it real.
You know,

523
00:28:58.621 --> 00:29:01.530
we had during that come in and say,
just leave,
you know,

524
00:29:01.531 --> 00:29:04.950
promise me that everything will be normal and you guys won't be acting up and

525
00:29:04.951 --> 00:29:07.290
you're more distant that and we said,
yeah we will.
And you know,

526
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:10.110
a promise is a promise.
You have to be respectful,
you know what?

527
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.710
And then the next day day do the same shit.

528
00:29:12.711 --> 00:29:17.711
It's like they put like some count Chocula doll in there with uh,

529
00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:23.150
with uh,
like a certificate to like get your eyebrows lacks it said Edmond on it.

530
00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:27.780
Yeah.
The thing is I gave him,
the thing is I could give them my number,

531
00:29:27.781 --> 00:29:30.960
they could always send me anywhere in the street,
you know,
and I told him that,

532
00:29:30.961 --> 00:29:32.160
you know,
there's too many cameras.

533
00:29:32.161 --> 00:29:34.410
Don't act like a little bitch in front of cameras.
You know,

534
00:29:34.411 --> 00:29:36.240
you guys could do that cause you know you don't,

535
00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:39.060
we round doesn't want me to step out of line and kick your fucking ass right

536
00:29:39.061 --> 00:29:41.890
there.
There you going to take me out of there and you know,
I gotta

537
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:46.120
<v 1>do this for all those kids,
you know,
but they don't understand shit like that.</v>

538
00:29:46.121 --> 00:29:48.540
So when a person doesn't,
sometimes you can't fucking,

539
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:49.341
<v 3>well that's the thing,</v>

540
00:29:49.341 --> 00:29:53.900
like if someone is like purposely like trying to like backhanded work against

541
00:29:53.901 --> 00:29:54.351
you do really,

542
00:29:54.351 --> 00:29:57.980
really shady shit and then try to like play sweetheart to everybody else and

543
00:29:57.981 --> 00:30:01.490
then they try to play sweetheart again.
I'm not going to trust you at all.

544
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:04.370
Why would you expect that and why?
It would be an insult.

545
00:30:04.371 --> 00:30:07.370
All the people that I love that you insulted to shake your hand without an

546
00:30:07.371 --> 00:30:10.040
apology to them anyway.
Did you like to in that show?

547
00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:11.270
Because it seemed like you hated it.

548
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:16.550
It was one of the worst experiences I've ever like had to deal with.

549
00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:20.810
What was horrible about it?
Just being around me.
She all the time,
no about being,

550
00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:21.883
um,

551
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:27.070
felt like I was trapped in a situation because the kids needed me so I couldn't

552
00:30:27.081 --> 00:30:31.940
leave,
you know,
so I mean I was,

553
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:32.720
I was kind of trapped.

554
00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.800
They were like using the fact that I needed to be there for these kids so they

555
00:30:36.801 --> 00:30:38.450
would treat it us however they wanted.

556
00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:43.900
And I just felt like I'd never felt like that disrespected in my whole life.

557
00:30:44.121 --> 00:30:46.970
And I had to sit and take it every day and I had to watch the people that I

558
00:30:46.971 --> 00:30:50.150
really love and care about get disrespected every day.

559
00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:53.060
And that was really hard that they were like putting up with it every day

560
00:30:53.061 --> 00:30:57.650
because of me.
And I just felt really,
really responsible for everything.

561
00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:00.770
But,
um,
my,
you know,
I just don't even,

562
00:31:00.771 --> 00:31:03.590
I'm not even supposed to go on about it anymore.

563
00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.220
I get in trouble every time that I taught you about cost.

564
00:31:06.221 --> 00:31:09.560
My fighter who gives you trouble,
Dana,
Danny gets upset,

565
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:11.360
people get upset.

566
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:14.420
I think you could probably say whatever the fuck you want right about now.

567
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:20.270
If I was your manager,
I'd be like,
ah,
just let it go.
Let it out

568
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:24.680
for yourself everywhere.
Everybody knows how I feel about it.

569
00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:28.010
But I'm saying that like,
you know,
because I,
I know the,

570
00:31:28.011 --> 00:31:29.990
all those things happened,
the people watching don't,

571
00:31:29.991 --> 00:31:32.930
all these things happened and it would be very easy to,
to,

572
00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:37.090
to placate to whatever everybody else was seeing.
But I was going to stay at,

573
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:40.870
you know,
do what I felt was God on us,
right thing to do.

574
00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.760
What should we not shake that hand?
And if I want to boost me it fine.

575
00:31:43.761 --> 00:31:46.070
And there's going to be another situation where you know,

576
00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:49.670
everybody else see something one way,
but it's really another way.

577
00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.110
And I could either

578
00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:58.030
prioritize my perception and image above everything and everyone and every moral

579
00:31:58.131 --> 00:32:02.990
that I have or I could try and do the right thing and be honest and have people

580
00:32:02.991 --> 00:32:03.920
hate me for it sometime.

581
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:05.670
<v 1>Cause this is how it is.
If there's cameras,</v>

582
00:32:05.671 --> 00:32:09.270
might as well show everything what happened and people will understand what

583
00:32:09.271 --> 00:32:11.700
really did happen.
Right,
right.
It was just common sense.

584
00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:14.850
But then whenever you have cameras and sometimes you show something and then

585
00:32:14.851 --> 00:32:17.700
don't show the other,
mm,
then name I,
you know,

586
00:32:17.701 --> 00:32:19.320
people might think what the hell just happened?

587
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:21.360
Like my situation with Donaldson Holman,
that guy,

588
00:32:21.361 --> 00:32:23.820
he's looking at me in the parking lot.
He's looking at me,

589
00:32:23.821 --> 00:32:26.910
I'm looking at him like he's looking at me.
Then he turns around and says,
I said,

590
00:32:26.911 --> 00:32:31.050
fucking buy.
I said,
man,
when you say buy,
you don't use the fucking weird fucking,

591
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.710
you know,
have some fucking manners.
You stupid.
You need it.

592
00:32:34.711 --> 00:32:37.470
I'll teach you a fucking manners.
You don't,
you can't talk to me.
There's no way.

593
00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:39.950
There's no cameras.
There's no way you could speak to me.

594
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.920
<v 6>It's impossible.
I want to talk about it anymore.
Yeah.
And then,</v>

595
00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:44.930
and then he comes and then when I go at him,

596
00:32:44.931 --> 00:32:47.870
cause he fucking gets on my nerves and there's the camera's all kinds of

597
00:32:47.871 --> 00:32:48.471
bullshit.
Well,

598
00:32:48.471 --> 00:32:51.800
those reality shows are very problematic when they edit things and they also

599
00:32:51.801 --> 00:32:53.320
like to edit things out of context.

600
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:56.450
I will take the reaction to something else and put it on the one thing.

601
00:32:56.451 --> 00:33:01.451
And that's why we did it was it was a lot of reaction shown without constant

602
00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:06.650
what?
Yeah,
what caused them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I didn't even,
you know,
I just,

603
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:09.230
I just want to put that whole part of my life,
like behind me,

604
00:33:09.231 --> 00:33:10.270
not what we should have known.
Yeah.

605
00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:14.300
You can't take six weeks and put it into an hour a week.
You just can't.

606
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:18.260
It just won't.
It won't be real.
And all the different interactions you have,

607
00:33:18.261 --> 00:33:20.540
they just do their best to make it entertaining.

608
00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:22.340
But there's this one moment where you guys,

609
00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.120
one of the coaches challenges where you,
uh,

610
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:28.070
you beat her and you're hanging from a rope and you go,
fuck.

611
00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:32.430
<v 0>You was like,
God damn,
that girl's fire burns.</v>

612
00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.480
It didn't matter that you,

613
00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:40.350
you wanted a win and say fuck you.

614
00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.170
What I really wanted to do was I wanted to wait and say,

615
00:33:43.171 --> 00:33:44.840
fuck you and I wanted my kid.
Yeah,

616
00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:46.740
<v 6>I'll go home at 1000 bucks.
Right.</v>

617
00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:49.990
That meant a lot to them and the fact that she didn't give a shit that,
that,

618
00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:53.740
that money would have meant a lot to our kids and they all lost it because she

619
00:33:53.741 --> 00:33:56.440
didn't,
you know,
like the fact that it didn't affect her at all.
I was like,

620
00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:00.340
don't give a fuck about them.
I'd been crushed if I lost item in question.

621
00:34:00.341 --> 00:34:04.210
If all those kids that really could use $1,000 didn't go home with $1,000,

622
00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:08.140
you know,
because like,
man,
I love those guys.
I was just,
I just got to,

623
00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:12.820
we've got a video of him thinking about that shows intelligence.
Yeah.

624
00:34:12.890 --> 00:34:14.290
Not Thinking about after the fight,

625
00:34:14.291 --> 00:34:17.650
when you're getting your fucking ass kicked me,
you know,
shake hands.

626
00:34:17.651 --> 00:34:21.160
What the fuck you're fighting.
Yeah.
At that time,
her intensity,

627
00:34:21.161 --> 00:34:22.090
the way she's fighting.

628
00:34:22.091 --> 00:34:26.140
You sticking your hand after being like that and then people boring because of

629
00:34:26.141 --> 00:34:30.220
that.
It makes no fucking sense.
Bu for other things also,
you know,

630
00:34:30.221 --> 00:34:33.970
people will be smarter than that.
People love to boob winners.

631
00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:37.980
There's something about,
and people that win and they don't win like that.

632
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:40.480
They're not good winners like me.
They don't,
they're,

633
00:34:40.481 --> 00:34:42.610
they're still upset at the person they beat.

634
00:34:42.611 --> 00:34:43.810
People have a real problem with that.

635
00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.640
<v 0>Oh my God,
this reminds me of like these stores is here,</v>

636
00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:50.730
but my mom when she is competing like back in the day,
I can only imagine man,

637
00:34:50.731 --> 00:34:55.710
like yeah,
Sue's always pissed.
You get angry leftover.
That's what they is.

638
00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:58.500
They used to say about her,
like her all teammates tell me like yeah,

639
00:34:58.501 --> 00:35:02.760
she would walk on the mat and should be pissed off and she throws and to be the

640
00:35:02.761 --> 00:35:07.230
crowd arm bar and then walk off.
Still pissed off an angry leftovers.

641
00:35:07.231 --> 00:35:11.460
He was still angry and resolved nothing and uh,
oh my God.
Yeah,

642
00:35:11.461 --> 00:35:13.080
that's what I'm telling you.
Like just,

643
00:35:13.081 --> 00:35:17.040
I can only imagine if MMA was around when my mom was completed.
How many,

644
00:35:17.041 --> 00:35:20.190
how many siblings do you have?
You have one semester.
Three,
six,
three sisters?
Yes.

645
00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.500
Are they all crazy too?
Cause everybody crazy.

646
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:25.470
Everybody is their own brand of Casey.
Um,

647
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.200
who's the crate you the craziest,
first

648
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:31.010
<v 6>of all?
The sisters?
Um,</v>

649
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:35.480
well I don't think there's one like the most crazy.

650
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:38.250
I think we just really have our own different of crazy,
but I think

651
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:42.230
<v 3>Julia,
my little sister is probably the least.
The least.
She has the most chill.</v>

652
00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:45.710
Like she was very calm.
Yeah.
Like when whenever we're at fights,

653
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:49.050
like all my sisters are all like,
oh,
they're so amped up.
And like,
you know,
my,

654
00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:54.240
my sister Maria,
I remember at one 68 end up getting a Migraine,
like threw up.

655
00:35:54.241 --> 00:35:56.940
My mom went to the bathroom to cry.
My sister,
Jennifer's like,

656
00:35:56.941 --> 00:36:00.500
I'm never going into a fight again.
And George was like,
I knew she'd win

657
00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:03.280
our,
yeah.

658
00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.280
<v 4>What was,
which one was 68.
Was that Sara Mcmann?</v>

659
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.580
<v 3>Yeah.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.
But Jennifer did ended up,</v>

660
00:36:12.581 --> 00:36:15.100
she said she'd never come to a fight again when she came to Brazil because I was

661
00:36:15.101 --> 00:36:19.810
like,
I'll take you guys.
I'll resorting after if you come into it,
you know,

662
00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:24.220
it's like,
all right,
fine.
Does your little sister,
does she train?
Uh,

663
00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:25.780
she is soccer.

664
00:36:25.781 --> 00:36:28.690
She's like about to go to the college and he's just gonna get a soccer

665
00:36:28.691 --> 00:36:31.320
scholarship.
No judo.
She did judo.

666
00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:34.690
She won't like went up to purple belt but you know,
she wasn't really,
she is,

667
00:36:34.691 --> 00:36:34.990
she's,

668
00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:37.750
there's a different mentality between someone who does individual sports and

669
00:36:37.751 --> 00:36:41.290
some of those team sports and she is very much like a team sport mentality.

670
00:36:41.291 --> 00:36:45.520
I've even brought her to come and do our training with us a little bit and

671
00:36:45.521 --> 00:36:47.170
whenever we have like a team workout,

672
00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.320
she works a lot harder than if it's like individual.

673
00:36:50.321 --> 00:36:52.330
Like she really wants to like,
I dunno,

674
00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:55.240
she's got one of those things where that's,
that's her environment.

675
00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:59.020
Like I need all the pressure to be on me all the time.

676
00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:04.410
Whereas like some kids do better attention and pressure and attention.

677
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:05.570
<v 4>Well you seem,</v>

678
00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:10.840
you seem to be uniquely qualified to handle it and uniquely qualified to handle

679
00:37:11.541 --> 00:37:15.380
the,
the,
the pressure that comes with,
with being famous too.

680
00:37:15.381 --> 00:37:19.130
It's very weird like how you handle it.
Like even your perspective,

681
00:37:19.131 --> 00:37:22.710
like what you said about like you can't,
they like you,
you know,

682
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.130
you don't even know what the fuck's going on while it's happening because it's,

683
00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.460
it's going to take till it's over for you to like look back and kind of

684
00:37:28.461 --> 00:37:29.294
understand it.

685
00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:34.710
That's a very uniquely honest and perceptive view of what you're going through.

686
00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.240
<v 3>Well,
I mean I notice a lot of these girls like they,</v>

687
00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:43.010
they would like to win a UFC belt and have that respect,

688
00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:46.730
but they're not about that life.
They don't want that life.

689
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:51.200
They don't want the attention and scrutiny and pressure and constant work and

690
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:54.380
all those things.
And then they don't want it.
They,
they,

691
00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:56.660
they want one thing without the other,
but I don't,
you know,

692
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:58.400
but it all comes together and that's,

693
00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:03.200
I think one thing that's kind of working against them is when they actually come

694
00:38:03.201 --> 00:38:04.034
in to fight me,

695
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:08.240
they get a taste like a small taste of what that life is going to be like when

696
00:38:08.241 --> 00:38:11.530
they're a contender because it is like way more attention,
way more.

697
00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:16.130
That's when only one that went over that and once doing the bell is just doubled

698
00:38:16.131 --> 00:38:19.640
every single time.
It's more and more and more and more and they know,

699
00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:22.100
I don't think any of them would actually be happy with that lifestyle.

700
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:23.840
I don't think they really truly want it.

701
00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:28.520
<v 4>No,
everybody wants to win.
Everybody wants to be a winner.</v>

702
00:38:28.521 --> 00:38:31.430
Everybody wants to be famous.
But I don't think anybody knows other than you.

703
00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:36.520
Like you have to be there to know what that is like.
I see it from the outside

704
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:40.240
<v 2>and it's,
it looks mind boggling.
The amount of pressure,</v>

705
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:43.000
the media obligations,
the media obligations alone,

706
00:38:43.001 --> 00:38:44.200
which is something nobody considers.

707
00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:48.760
But if you go on youtube or you go on the Internet and look at all the different

708
00:38:48.761 --> 00:38:53.620
interviews that you do up to a fight or any of the world champions do up to a

709
00:38:53.621 --> 00:38:55.810
fight,
it's fucking staggering.
I mean,

710
00:38:55.811 --> 00:39:00.760
you guys are constantly on the radio constantly sitting down and doing TV

711
00:39:00.761 --> 00:39:02.320
interviews constantly.

712
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:07.060
There's articles in rolling stone and in fucking all these different magazines

713
00:39:07.061 --> 00:39:11.080
and the scheduling today was kind of a cluster fuck to be honest.
And now,

714
00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:14.440
and this is just like Monday.
I know.
No,

715
00:39:14.441 --> 00:39:18.310
like he'll fight coming up Holly Holmes.
Not until now.

716
00:39:18.311 --> 00:39:21.070
It's the November card and November card.

717
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.720
And that's going to be the biggest audience ever for a UFC.
The biggest,

718
00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:30.220
yes it is.
GSP is going to be bigger than that.
Oh Wow.

719
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:33.160
Okay.
This will be bigger because this would be overseeing,

720
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:35.690
this one's going to be me.

721
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.340
It's going to be over 60,000 it'd be bigger than the Rogers arena.

722
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:44.590
It's going to be nuts.
So that hasn't ramped up yet.
No,

723
00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:48.460
not really.
So now you're,
but even regular days,

724
00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:51.700
like how the fuck do you relax?
She doesn't,

725
00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.340
she trained me and everyday I have a problem.

726
00:39:54.341 --> 00:39:57.940
He actually forced me to relax after this last camp cause usually I'm like back

727
00:39:57.941 --> 00:40:00.580
in the gym like two days after because I just didn't know what to do with
myself.

728
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:04.690
And um,
he like forced me to have 20 days off of this time,

729
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:09.910
20 whole day.
And then she was like,
why do I need that number?
I like,

730
00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:13.370
I can't get an answer right now,
but make it 20 was the problem here.

731
00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:18.710
What's fascinating is you listened to him.
That's,
that's,

732
00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:22.030
that's what you're saying that you're saying that

733
00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:23.190
<v 1>belief.
You know,</v>

734
00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:28.170
I've trained Vic Darchinyan amazing world champion right from Australia.

735
00:40:28.171 --> 00:40:30.180
He's so stuck that around this fighting there right now.

736
00:40:30.181 --> 00:40:34.860
And you know the personality,
everything.
She's born a fighter that we know.

737
00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:40.340
But what she has is that belief that trust into a trainer.

738
00:40:40.951 --> 00:40:43.440
When I show you something she believes in and she does it.

739
00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:47.070
That belief I think comes with respecting.

740
00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.790
We are working would the love,
the passion,
everything combined.

741
00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:54.630
But her belief is even if you show it wrong to her,

742
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:59.250
she will make it right.
She will make it happen.
You know this the first time,

743
00:40:59.251 --> 00:41:02.910
this last fight,
I put a chest protector on in the locker room.
I said,
champ,

744
00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:04.470
you know why I'm wearing the chest protector.

745
00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:09.410
I want you to hit that body when you angle off.
And she did it.
You know,

746
00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:13.800
she does it.
She believes it.
She doesn't question.
She doesn't doubt.

747
00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.450
<v 2>Well,
you guys have a very unique relationship.</v>

748
00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.480
And one of the things I loves Edmon and every time he sends me a text message,

749
00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:23.950
he doesn't call you Rhonda.
He calls you champ.
He reminded,

750
00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:28.390
you know Shannon Briggs is Shannon the Canon Briggs.
He's crazy here.
Yeah,

751
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:32.770
let's go check out everything he does.
Like every Instagram videos.

752
00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.040
Let's go champ.
It's all

753
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.320
<v 4>he says,
let's go champ.
What are you doing champ?</v>

754
00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:39.530
You can't be drinking them sodas,
champ.
You need the cross.
Everybody chat it.

755
00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:43.980
It's hilarious.
But he's,
he's really fun.
But he called.
It just reminds me that,

756
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.540
cause he only calls you champ.
That's what he calls you.
That's it around title.

757
00:41:47.541 --> 00:41:48.520
I like,
fuck yeah.

758
00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:54.070
<v 0>Someone calling someone and tiger or bud or you know,
whatever.
Yeah.
Kayla Champs.</v>

759
00:41:54.071 --> 00:41:57.750
Sometimes champion Ana's champion.
Yeah.
Oh,

760
00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:02.120
it's easy to trust him because like he's told you a couple of times before like

761
00:42:02.121 --> 00:42:04.020
the fight,
like,
oh,
like remember when Mcmahon,

762
00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.820
he said it was going to be a liver shot.
Yeah.
And I'm with Davis.
He's like,

763
00:42:07.821 --> 00:42:12.440
it's going to be overhand.
Right.
And this last,
um,
look additionally the trip.

764
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:15.800
Yeah.
And then like with,
with uh,
Zingano,
he's like,

765
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:19.100
she's going to come out with something flying right away and you're going to

766
00:42:19.101 --> 00:42:21.770
like,
check your check left and you're going to like,
you know,

767
00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:26.780
it's going to be quick.
And then with this fight he said w with bat,

768
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:30.590
she was like,
she's going to sleep on her face.
He is swear to God.
He said,

769
00:42:30.591 --> 00:42:34.080
you're going to knock her on.
She's asleep on her face.
And I'm like,
yeah,
okay.

770
00:42:34.081 --> 00:42:35.060
All right.
I read about Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

771
00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:38.980
<v 1>It wasn't just that a you out,
but how like it was honor.</v>

772
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:43.970
How are you doing some Armenians?
What are you doing?
Oh,
you know,

773
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.610
you know what it is?
Trust them though,
because every time it's getting crazy.

774
00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.480
It's because of the preparation.

775
00:42:51.481 --> 00:42:55.410
Would you see during training camp and what kind of sparring partners you hire?

776
00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:58.170
I don't do sparrings in my gym for Rhonda.

777
00:42:58.171 --> 00:43:01.320
Rhonda doesn't have that striking experience,

778
00:43:01.321 --> 00:43:05.220
meaning competition experience.
So how can I get that?
I thought of,

779
00:43:05.221 --> 00:43:08.820
I should get that in the gym.
She has competition experience in judo.
She is,

780
00:43:08.821 --> 00:43:12.630
you know,
your competition.
We can't talk about that high,
how high level it is.

781
00:43:12.631 --> 00:43:14.280
But boxing you don't,

782
00:43:14.281 --> 00:43:17.670
she doesn't have any amateur boxing fights or amateur kickboxing fights,

783
00:43:17.671 --> 00:43:19.170
anything like that.
So to get it,

784
00:43:19.171 --> 00:43:23.130
I would get great sparring partners for her in the gym and in the gym.

785
00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:24.690
When I get the great sparring partners,

786
00:43:24.691 --> 00:43:29.691
I see Rhonda knocking out people from the liver shot maybe 2030 people for

787
00:43:31.351 --> 00:43:35.280
training camp.
Those grills are hired.
Sparring partners,
they get paid.

788
00:43:35.281 --> 00:43:37.110
So you know,
what were some of them are here.

789
00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:40.020
Sparring partners in the gym where I,
you know,

790
00:43:40.021 --> 00:43:43.740
helped them and I trained them and I,
you know,
she knows never charged them.

791
00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:47.340
I work with them,
you know,
so I could build them,

792
00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:51.480
give them what they need to be a champion and she drops all of those people in

793
00:43:51.481 --> 00:43:55.530
the gym.
Of course she's going to do it during the fight.
Well,

794
00:43:55.531 --> 00:43:58.380
how could she not a champion Laker,
how could she not?

795
00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:00.120
She gets in there and she does it.

796
00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:03.970
<v 4>That's why you have as much of a belief in her as she has in your,</v>

797
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.500
in your training of her.
You guys had,

798
00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.900
that's why I say you have a very unique relationship,

799
00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:11.600
which is why she wanted you right there.
When you sat down,
you were over there.

800
00:44:11.601 --> 00:44:14.810
Get over here getting the touch.
You can never reach it.

801
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:19.950
<v 1>We would eat dinner at night when she started her career and you feel like</v>

802
00:44:21.371 --> 00:44:24.150
training that we'll talk about boxing.
You know about what?
What?

803
00:44:24.151 --> 00:44:26.380
What are we doing guider about it.

804
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:29.530
You know about the sweet science teacher and she would,

805
00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:32.640
let's go to the gym and start working woodwork until 1:00 AM

806
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:35.870
<v 0>on the mic.
Please take these pictures of like,
yeah,
me,</v>

807
00:44:35.871 --> 00:44:38.870
you and Ronnie were all at the gym at like one o'clock in the morning cause we

808
00:44:38.871 --> 00:44:41.750
all went to dinner and we were so like amped up talking about fighting or like,

809
00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:43.640
fuck yeah,
let's go right now.
Let's go right to lose her.

810
00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:46.780
So like into fighting and you know,
you shouldn't see him go off on a tangent.

811
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:48.210
You'd be like,
makes me want to fight,
you know,

812
00:44:48.211 --> 00:44:50.290
so me and menu or like let's go back,
go,

813
00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:52.700
let me read week when turned around and went straight back to the gym.

814
00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:56.590
<v 1>Makes me want to fight with you can do that.
You just want to do it,</v>

815
00:44:56.591 --> 00:45:00.140
just go do it.
Why not?
Right.
Personality,
personality,
you know,

816
00:45:00.141 --> 00:45:05.140
it has to work in with the trainer.
You know,
it's not only that I'm the best,

817
00:45:05.141 --> 00:45:08.050
it works for her personality and you know,

818
00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:11.100
<v 4>does a video,
you guys that I put up on my Instagram page,
the,</v>

819
00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:15.000
I retweeted a pull that shit up his uh,
I think,
uh,
from,

820
00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:17.320
I think I retweeted it from Dana or the UFC,

821
00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:20.170
but you guys track training in Brazil on the beach,

822
00:45:20.171 --> 00:45:23.170
those one of those workout days.
Oh though and go and uh,

823
00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:28.260
you fucking hit and meds and I was like,
Jesus Christ,

824
00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:32.140
what the fuck is going on in your gym because you're,

825
00:45:32.141 --> 00:45:37.141
your striking has accelerated in these giant jumps like every three or four

826
00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:42.400
months.
When I watch like you hit and meds,
I'm like,
what the fuck are they doing?

827
00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:47.980
It's like,
no,
you don't see that kind of results from other fighters,
these,
these,

828
00:45:47.981 --> 00:45:50.690
these,
these giant leaps from the WWE.

829
00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.920
If you go back to like I saw you guys hitting mitts before the Liz,

830
00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:56.830
Liz Carmouche fight and you go back to before the batch call,
hey,

831
00:45:56.831 --> 00:46:01.040
a fight like fucking [inaudible] is so different.
It's,
it's,

832
00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:03.880
it's shocking.
You're only talking about a few years,

833
00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:07.420
but there's difference between like someone who's like,
you know,

834
00:46:07.421 --> 00:46:11.050
got a decent understanding of how to throw punches to someone who looks like a

835
00:46:11.051 --> 00:46:14.450
fucking world champion.
Kickboxer or this is boxing

836
00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:18.220
<v 1>world champion.
Any giving any given day.
I always say that right now,
you know,</v>

837
00:46:18.221 --> 00:46:19.860
there is a few females out there,
you know,

838
00:46:19.861 --> 00:46:23.160
no disrespect that are in the Olympic Games.
That one Olympic gold medal.

839
00:46:23.161 --> 00:46:26.580
I even told Rhonda about a girl Reza,
you know,
there's uh,
yeah,
she,
she,

840
00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:28.620
she could buck,
she won the Olympic boxing gold metal.

841
00:46:28.621 --> 00:46:30.630
Like a lot of respect to her.
She could definitely box.

842
00:46:30.631 --> 00:46:33.990
You could punch amazing champion and Olympic gold medals,

843
00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:38.190
but a professional boxing her weight class one 35 pounder.

844
00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:41.310
She would destroy them.
Here it is right here on the big screen.

845
00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:43.430
<v 5>Okay.</v>

846
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:47.660
<v 4>This is a,
see what you guys are,
are hitting mets.
Oh,
those pants or in my car.</v>

847
00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:49.323
Ah,

848
00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:53.960
<v 0>I just thought it was,
yeah,</v>

849
00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:58.010
<v 4>it's fucking speed is retarded.</v>

850
00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:00.390
<v 0>Well,
the thing is people forget that.</v>

851
00:47:00.391 --> 00:47:02.970
Like when I won the title the first time it was my,

852
00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:07.650
it was like my fifth profile look good after class just to get started.
Yeah,

853
00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:11.220
just not like hit and spend so much different,
you know?

854
00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:14.720
<v 4>Well you have a lot of striking knowledge is very obvious.</v>

855
00:47:14.721 --> 00:47:17.480
I've seen the work you've done with Ellenberger and with Travis and the

856
00:47:17.481 --> 00:47:17.961
Ellenberger.

857
00:47:17.961 --> 00:47:21.890
There was a big difference between the way he was throwing punches and the way

858
00:47:21.891 --> 00:47:25.960
he was moving after he started working with you.
And I could tell the way you,

859
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:28.790
you coacher and the way you coach fighters,
you,

860
00:47:28.791 --> 00:47:32.380
you know a lot of shit about boxing.
There's a lot going on there with movement,

861
00:47:32.620 --> 00:47:36.720
but it's also,
you're a very unusual athlete.
Rhonda,
you know,
I'm,

862
00:47:36.721 --> 00:47:37.750
I'm sure you know this,

863
00:47:37.751 --> 00:47:42.751
but there's a fucking fire burning inside you that is just so much hotter than

864
00:47:42.941 --> 00:47:46.120
most people.
The intensity that you're bringing to it,

865
00:47:46.121 --> 00:47:48.640
is that come from the way your mom raised you?

866
00:47:48.641 --> 00:47:51.340
Is that something that's always been in you like

867
00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:55.920
<v 3>I think it's a mix between how I was raised and never wanting the Olympics.</v>

868
00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:57.120
Yeah.

869
00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:00.980
That's like the best thing has ever happened to me because it's like now it's

870
00:48:00.981 --> 00:48:05.400
just unlimited motivation forever because it's never going to be satiated.
Yeah.

871
00:48:05.401 --> 00:48:08.940
I grew up as a little kid,
like,
you know,
I even before I did judo,

872
00:48:08.941 --> 00:48:11.220
my dad convinced me music,
you're going to win the Olympics in swimming,

873
00:48:11.221 --> 00:48:14.220
you're going to be didn't champion.
And then it switched in judo.
So I was like,

874
00:48:14.221 --> 00:48:16.350
okay,
I'm going to be Olympic champion and this is my whole life.

875
00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:21.570
That was like my obsession,
you know?
And I went when I was 17 and um,

876
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:22.650
it didn't go my way.

877
00:48:22.651 --> 00:48:27.651
And then when I was 21 like I was so unhappy doing judo that I felt like that

878
00:48:32.131 --> 00:48:34.890
was like my last shot.
Why were you so unhappy doing judo?

879
00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:40.640
Because just it got to a point where it's very old school kind of training or

880
00:48:42.071 --> 00:48:45.300
it's drilled into your head that you have to make yourself absolutely miserable

881
00:48:45.301 --> 00:48:49.320
in order to deserve to win.
And so I was just like,

882
00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:52.560
I was miserable all the time.
Why do you have to make yourself miserable?

883
00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:53.400
What do you mean?

884
00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:58.400
Like constantly overtrained always overtrained like I couldn't like my knee,

885
00:48:59.431 --> 00:49:02.760
I have recovered so much since coming to MMA.

886
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:07.790
Like I was about to retire just because my knee was so bad in judo because like

887
00:49:07.791 --> 00:49:09.630
I could barely walk some days they would,

888
00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:13.230
I would wake up in the morning and it would take me like 20 minutes to maneuver

889
00:49:13.231 --> 00:49:15.990
my knee enough so I could bend it again cause it would lock in place in the

890
00:49:15.991 --> 00:49:16.824
middle of the night.

891
00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:21.780
And you know like just the people that I was around,

892
00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:26.840
like there was some of them that were cool but mostly I had no control over who

893
00:49:27.781 --> 00:49:30.660
I lived with or who I was around all day long.

894
00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:34.200
And so if you're around people that you don't really like constantly,
you know,

895
00:49:34.201 --> 00:49:35.034
it just kind of like,

896
00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:38.010
you're always watching what you say and always looking over your shoulder.

897
00:49:38.011 --> 00:49:42.030
You can have a really relaxed and I didn't like where I lived and it was just

898
00:49:42.031 --> 00:49:43.410
the actual process of training.

899
00:49:43.411 --> 00:49:47.760
Like the training itself wasn't fun at all and it wasn't meant to be fun at all.

900
00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:51.300
And like from when I was a kid from I think from,

901
00:49:53.070 --> 00:49:53.430
I dunno,

902
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:58.430
2003 to 2006 nine 2000 to 2006 I cried every single practice and would lock

903
00:50:01.471 --> 00:50:05.460
myself in the locker room and cry for another half hour afterwards.
Wow.
Yeah.

904
00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:10.170
And it was only like when I got older that was able to shake myself and not

905
00:50:10.171 --> 00:50:14.040
crying during training because if it didn't go exactly my way,
like if I had,

906
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:16.290
if I got thrown once,
you know,

907
00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:20.130
by someone who was 50 pounds heavier and meet with five years more experience,

908
00:50:20.131 --> 00:50:21.150
I would still cry about it.

909
00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:25.320
And like I wouldn't then I'd be embarrassed that I was crying and I would cry

910
00:50:25.321 --> 00:50:28.360
because I was embarrassed because I couldn't stop myself crying and line.

911
00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:32.180
It would just keep going and you know?
Yeah.

912
00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:36.380
So that's the how like Manny and all them knew me when I was a kid is I was
like,

913
00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:39.860
my mom would bring me in there just to get beat up because they were really

914
00:50:39.861 --> 00:50:40.790
tough guys,
you know?

915
00:50:40.791 --> 00:50:43.340
And she would bring me to like four or five different gyms a week to get all the

916
00:50:43.341 --> 00:50:48.050
different styles and they would beat up on me and I would get thrown once first

917
00:50:48.051 --> 00:50:50.540
time I get thrown immediately start crying and I'm getting embarrassed,

918
00:50:50.541 --> 00:50:54.470
crying more and then like,
but they were used to me crying,
you know,

919
00:50:54.471 --> 00:50:57.140
and like I'd be able to finish the whole night and sometimes,
you know,

920
00:50:57.141 --> 00:50:58.960
I'd be able to stop crying when they did the night.

921
00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:03.860
And that was like comfortable with me in a way because I didn't have to be

922
00:51:03.861 --> 00:51:06.950
embarrassed because they were used to me crying all the time.

923
00:51:06.951 --> 00:51:10.040
And so they accepted me like that and they didn't think I was a stupid little

924
00:51:10.041 --> 00:51:13.400
girl because I was crying during training and it,
and then it really sucked,

925
00:51:13.401 --> 00:51:16.270
like moving to a different environment.
And then I don't know,

926
00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.680
all these people don't know that I cry.

927
00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.630
They don't know that it's my thing and now I'm like,

928
00:51:19.631 --> 00:51:22.960
I have to start all over again.
And then it makes you cry even easier.
And Yeah,

929
00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:24.860
let me fight with him before I start crying.

930
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:32.360
It wasn't until I ran away from home and was out on my own that I was able to

931
00:51:32.361 --> 00:51:34.940
like stop myself from crying every night.

932
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:38.270
Then it would be like a couple times a week and then I kinda like got rid of it

933
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:42.830
mostly.
But like since doing MMA,
I haven't cried during training.

934
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:46.590
When did you run away from home?
Like a week after I turned 18.
Wow.

935
00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:49.730
That's not running away from home.
That's like moving out.
Well,
you know,

936
00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:53.900
13 I know,
but no one knew I was leaving

937
00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:58.790
and it was in the middle of the night.
He just couldn't take it anymore.
Um,

938
00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:00.260
you know,
um,

939
00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:06.110
I was at a point where I felt like every second of my day was somebody else's

940
00:52:06.111 --> 00:52:10.310
decision,
you know,
so like I,
I mean,

941
00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:13.670
I am so grateful to my mother.
She's an amazing person.

942
00:52:13.671 --> 00:52:17.710
She had the perfect job raising me and I was kind of a stupid and short sighted

943
00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:20.570
kid.
I didn't realize how much she was doing for me at the time.
And I was,

944
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:25.700
you know,
had like Rapunzel and the castle syndrome.
I thought like,
oh,
woe is me.

945
00:52:25.701 --> 00:52:28.940
I'm locked in the castle and my mom was so mean and now I'm like,
oh my God,

946
00:52:28.941 --> 00:52:33.020
she's a genius.
But you know,
at the time,
yeah it was,

947
00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.360
I was recognized as having a lot of potential,
very,

948
00:52:35.361 --> 00:52:39.740
very young and was treated like,
like that,
you know,

949
00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:43.970
the like I was like the prodigy kid very young and got really intense,

950
00:52:43.971 --> 00:52:48.230
really structured training very early on.
And like it just became a whole life.

951
00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:49.250
Like I didn't have,

952
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.840
I never went to a single like dance or partying school.

953
00:52:53.841 --> 00:52:55.130
I never went on a single date.

954
00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:59.720
Like I trained all the time and then dropped out of school sophomore year so I

955
00:52:59.721 --> 00:53:02.900
could train all the time.
And that was like my life.

956
00:53:02.901 --> 00:53:06.200
And then I felt like my life was like out of my control.
And so I,

957
00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:07.580
I left and was like,
well,

958
00:53:07.581 --> 00:53:10.730
I'm going to win and I'm going to do this stuff on my own and I'm going to show

959
00:53:10.731 --> 00:53:12.350
everybody that actually know what I'm talking about.

960
00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:17.480
And because I felt like my opinion and no one had any respect for what I thought

961
00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.480
and I was always doing what everybody else said I should be doing.

962
00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:25.960
And so I went off and I bounced around a bunch of different clubs is a very

963
00:53:26.041 --> 00:53:29.910
crazy time,
was moving cities like every couple a couple of months.

964
00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:34.940
And then after on 2006 I was like the first American woman in nine years to win

965
00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:42.990
a World Cup in judo with no coach.
I did it with no coach.

966
00:53:42.991 --> 00:53:44.250
And then I also,

967
00:53:44.251 --> 00:53:47.820
I won in Sweden and I meddled in Finland when you know the Americans are getting

968
00:53:47.821 --> 00:53:49.350
their asses kicked,
they weren't meddling,

969
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:50.820
they weren't getting past the first round.

970
00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:54.870
And so like I was kind of my way to get respect from everybody else was,

971
00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:57.820
and then I ended up moving to Canada because I was like,
fuck all of us coaches,

972
00:53:57.821 --> 00:53:59.820
I'm going to do this something on.
And I was just,
I was,

973
00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:03.960
I had to like the national training center there where they couldn't coach me,

974
00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:07.710
but I was beating the girls.
So they were like,
yeah,
we'll come here and we'll,

975
00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:09.510
they'll get used to you and whatever.

976
00:54:09.511 --> 00:54:13.500
So I was just kind of like a body for them and I was like pretty much on my own

977
00:54:13.501 --> 00:54:15.900
training,
on my own with no direction and no coaching.
And I was like,

978
00:54:15.901 --> 00:54:19.170
couldn't coach you because you're a nice state citizen.
So the idea was,
yeah,

979
00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:20.820
yeah.
And um,

980
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:26.340
I was just like so stubborn and not getting enough respect that I felt like I

981
00:54:26.341 --> 00:54:27.660
was going to go win with nobody's help.

982
00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:31.620
And then I ended up getting asked back to one of the gyms I was kicked out of

983
00:54:31.621 --> 00:54:34.170
when I was a kid.
Why were you kicked out?
I was kicked out.

984
00:54:35.410 --> 00:54:37.920
I was kicked out several times.
Um,

985
00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:42.360
I was kicked out like once because like,
I dunno,

986
00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:45.390
my old coaches wife,
like didn't like my mom.
I don't know.

987
00:54:45.391 --> 00:54:47.220
They were having like argument and I'm like,

988
00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:50.370
then like the last time I got kicked out was,
um,

989
00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:56.160
I was at the German super and I lost.
I,

990
00:54:56.161 --> 00:54:56.994
um,

991
00:54:57.270 --> 00:55:01.200
I remember first round I was fighting to go from Finland and I was ahead by

992
00:55:01.201 --> 00:55:01.680
looking Yoko,

993
00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:05.070
which is like a decent score and there's like 40 seconds left and I threw her

994
00:55:05.071 --> 00:55:07.200
with an Occi Gari,
which you don't know where that is,

995
00:55:07.201 --> 00:55:10.200
but I pretty much fall into the guard and my arm is out.

996
00:55:10.201 --> 00:55:13.890
And then I just ended up in the arm Barbara Way I got onboard and,

997
00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:18.360
but my elbow like just located right away.
So this 18 year old little me,
um,

998
00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:22.440
my brain is going and I'm like,
well,
I was about to turn 18.
I was almost there.

999
00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.930
I'm like,
well my elbow is already out,
you know,

1000
00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.090
so I might as well just try to get out.
Right.

1001
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:30.330
And so I tried to get out in my elbow,
goes back in,
and then she pops out again.

1002
00:55:30.331 --> 00:55:33.210
And then I think I'm like,
well,
she'd already popped it out twice,
you know,

1003
00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:36.360
so I might as well,
like I can't just like let her do it twice.

1004
00:55:36.361 --> 00:55:39.450
And then I ended up getting out and run the clock out.
I won the match.

1005
00:55:39.451 --> 00:55:44.310
But then immediately right after I fought,
like,
you know,
this chick,
um,
uh,

1006
00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:48.090
what was it Lucy to cost,
who is a world Olympic champion from France?

1007
00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.610
And I couldn't even lift my arm from my side.

1008
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:54.270
Like I had to pick my hand up to like pull up to my side but like to fight.

1009
00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:56.820
And then,
um,

1010
00:55:56.821 --> 00:56:00.080
then I lost her and then I fought this German girl next and I still like

1011
00:56:00.081 --> 00:56:02.460
couldn't even lift my hand up and I would like to bring my hand up and ended up

1012
00:56:02.461 --> 00:56:03.840
winning that fight against a German girl.

1013
00:56:03.841 --> 00:56:06.750
And then I ended up fighting a earth's quizzle near who was a world and Olympic

1014
00:56:06.751 --> 00:56:10.050
bronze medalist.
And,
um,
it was a closer fight,
but I lost.

1015
00:56:10.051 --> 00:56:15.051
And so I was all bummed out and I was talking to my,

1016
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:19.650
like first boyfriend at the time,
which was like,
um,
you know,

1017
00:56:19.651 --> 00:56:22.380
I never had a date and never had a part,
nothing in,
in high school.
Right.

1018
00:56:22.381 --> 00:56:26.800
And so like,
I'm a 17 year old girl,
about to be 18.
And,
um,

1019
00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:31.450
this guy in his twenties,
it's like on the national team,
like has a thing for me,

1020
00:56:31.451 --> 00:56:33.040
you know what I mean?
Like I thought like,

1021
00:56:33.041 --> 00:56:36.700
I was so cool because like I was talking to this guy and of course,
you know,

1022
00:56:36.701 --> 00:56:39.310
my mom and my coaches are totally against it and they're like,

1023
00:56:39.311 --> 00:56:42.070
you're not allowed to talk to him and Dah,
Dah,
Dah.
You know,

1024
00:56:42.071 --> 00:56:44.790
of course I would talk to him anyway.
And um,

1025
00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:46.210
so we were seeing each other for a while.

1026
00:56:46.211 --> 00:56:49.210
I ended up seeing this guy for like two years actually.
Um,

1027
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:53.410
but I went back to the hotel and it was like,
screw this,
I hate judo.

1028
00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:55.870
And then,
um,

1029
00:56:56.320 --> 00:57:00.200
so I went back and I was hanging out with him and then my coach went down to the

1030
00:57:00.210 --> 00:57:01.000
lobby,

1031
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.960
got the key from my room and came up and walked in the room with me and this guy

1032
00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:09.820
freaked out.
Losses minds is,
you're out,
you're gone.
I'm done with you.

1033
00:57:09.821 --> 00:57:11.980
You're out of the gym,
you're out of everything.

1034
00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:13.720
I'll never want to see your face again.
All that stuff.

1035
00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:18.490
Just because you're having fun with a guy.
Yeah,
I don't get it.

1036
00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:19.953
Why was he so mad?

1037
00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:24.480
Because I was told not to and I disobeyed the,

1038
00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:27.150
they could tell you who to hang out with.
Yeah.

1039
00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:31.150
I could tell you who you could date.
I told you I had no control over my life.

1040
00:57:31.151 --> 00:57:35.470
It was ridiculous.
What kind of crazy that just old school judo mentality.

1041
00:57:35.471 --> 00:57:40.060
I guess so.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Plus,
you know,
I was,
he was,
as you know,

1042
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:40.990
it's sleazy.

1043
00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:46.180
Kind of preying on the young girl that I didn't see that I thought we were in

1044
00:57:46.181 --> 00:57:47.700
love and all this stuff.

1045
00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:52.270
So your coach might have been kind of protecting you and everybody was,
you know,

1046
00:57:52.271 --> 00:57:53.860
in hindsight I'm like,
oh my God,

1047
00:57:53.890 --> 00:57:56.560
how much older there was this car than you like five and a half years.

1048
00:57:56.890 --> 00:58:00.580
And you were like 18 or not quite what we were talking since I was like about to

1049
00:58:00.581 --> 00:58:04.900
turn 16 so it's illegal.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was illegal.
How dare he.

1050
00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:10.810
Oh,
okay.
Well that's different.
That kind of makes sense I guess.

1051
00:58:10.811 --> 00:58:15.040
But still like you,
you were 18 at the time when he was about to turn 18,

1052
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:19.030
it was still illegal.
And then I went home and my mom's like,
you know,

1053
00:58:19.031 --> 00:58:22.420
you're not going to do judo for a year and you better forget the name of

1054
00:58:22.421 --> 00:58:25.210
whatever his name was and you're going to work and you're going to support

1055
00:58:25.211 --> 00:58:28.210
yourself and you're going to pay me this amount of money to live in my house.

1056
00:58:28.211 --> 00:58:29.320
And I'm thinking,
I'm like,
well,

1057
00:58:29.321 --> 00:58:33.130
I want to do judo and if I want to work I'm going to go pay for my rent wherever

1058
00:58:33.131 --> 00:58:37.230
I want.
You know,
this is what I'm thinking.
And so that night I um,
I got social,

1059
00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:41.970
I used to get social security checks because of,
uh,
my dad,
he died.
And so I,

1060
00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:45.640
I went opened a bank account and I rerouted social security checks to go into my

1061
00:58:45.641 --> 00:58:48.220
account.
And then like I had to get dentist stuff done.

1062
00:58:48.221 --> 00:58:50.920
So I scheduled like dentists things.
So I'd still be under my mom's insurance.

1063
00:58:51.130 --> 00:58:52.550
And then I've got myself a plane ticket.

1064
00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:55.240
Was the social security money to be right after my last dentist appointment.

1065
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:59.410
Whoa.
That's intense.
And then like in the middle of the night,

1066
00:58:59.411 --> 00:59:04.411
like I secretly pack my bags and all this stuff and I waited until like two

1067
00:59:04.631 --> 00:59:08.830
o'clock in the morning or whatever to like walk several blocks away from the

1068
00:59:08.831 --> 00:59:12.430
house and then call the taxi several blocks away from the house and then took a

1069
00:59:12.431 --> 00:59:14.650
taxi to the airport.
Wow.

1070
00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:18.520
How long did it take for your mom knew what was going on and the next morning

1071
00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:24.080
did you call her?
Did you tell her where you were now?
When did you let her know?

1072
00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:27.950
She says I left it.
No,
I don't remember if I did to be honest.

1073
00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:31.570
But I went to like my best friend and Lily's house all the way across the,

1074
00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:36.560
the country in New York.
Cause I was like,
I want to work at Stewart's,

1075
00:59:36.561 --> 00:59:38.540
which is like their convenient store.
I was like,

1076
00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:42.110
I'm gonna get a job at a convenience store and I'm going to trade on my own and

1077
00:59:42.111 --> 00:59:44.870
I'm going to do it on my own and I'm going to show everybody that I could do it

1078
00:59:44.871 --> 00:59:48.440
on my own,
you know?
Uh,
no,
I was just,
I was a young,

1079
00:59:48.441 --> 00:59:52.460
dumb kid and just,
I had no like way to rebel,

1080
00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:55.430
so I was like little miss perfect.
And that was like my little,

1081
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:58.460
I suddenly just blew up one day and like took off.

1082
00:59:58.730 --> 01:00:01.850
How long was it before you talked to your mom again?
Like two years.

1083
01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:04.640
You didn't talk to her at all for two years.

1084
01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:07.880
Like anytime we tried to talk it would turn into a huge blow up.
So like,
yeah,

1085
01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:12.440
in like my whole family too.
Like I,
you know,
I,
it was terrible thing that I did.

1086
01:00:12.441 --> 01:00:12.611
I,

1087
01:00:12.611 --> 01:00:16.940
I like took off and I like really hurt my mom and my sisters really resented me

1088
01:00:16.941 --> 01:00:18.350
for it.
And a,

1089
01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:21.230
there were plenty of thanksgivings where like I would sit there and no one would

1090
01:00:21.231 --> 01:00:23.360
talk to me since like,
yeah,

1091
01:00:23.361 --> 01:00:27.720
after that and kind of fucking intense family,
really intense download.

1092
01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:33.050
It took many years for them to actually like forgive me for what I did.

1093
01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:38.000
Wow.
Yeah.
Wow.
That is crazy.

1094
01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:42.950
The world of judo is a lot like the world of wrestling with that overtraining,

1095
01:00:42.951 --> 01:00:47.100
isn't it?
Yeah.
What,
why is that like so caught?
Why?
How come no one's car?

1096
01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:50.390
Have they caught up to that sense of if people figured that out soon?

1097
01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:54.500
It's such an old sport where it's like Bushido martial arts and they're like

1098
01:00:54.501 --> 01:00:57.230
thinking like,
oh,
the way since icon on my name was still this thing.

1099
01:00:57.231 --> 01:00:59.690
I don't know if it was like,
I don't know,
what was it called?

1100
01:00:59.691 --> 01:01:02.630
Something training that this wouldn't kind of training in Japan or the like in

1101
01:01:02.631 --> 01:01:05.720
the winter where they'd opened all the windows and to be frost on the mats and

1102
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:08.210
they would purposely make you freezing cold while you train,

1103
01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:12.080
which is terrible for you.
But it'd be like,
you know,
old school mentality,

1104
01:01:12.081 --> 01:01:13.940
mental toughness,
you know,
that kind of stuff.

1105
01:01:13.941 --> 01:01:17.600
And they would always do like more is more for them or is more and more is more

1106
01:01:17.601 --> 01:01:18.140
and yeah,

1107
01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:22.310
I was so constantly overtrained all the time and constantly cutting weight and

1108
01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:27.230
like not having any way to actually make weight healthily.
No tools,
no education,

1109
01:01:27.231 --> 01:01:27.531
anything.

1110
01:01:27.531 --> 01:01:30.560
Just getting weighed every week and being yelled at for being too heavy.

1111
01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:35.220
Like theirs is so poorly run.
You know it,

1112
01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:38.610
you got yelled at for being too heavy.
Yeah,
I get weighed.

1113
01:01:38.611 --> 01:01:41.450
I used to get weighed every Tuesday and then I would,

1114
01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.540
I would not drink any water after Monday packed is,

1115
01:01:44.541 --> 01:01:47.720
and I wouldn't eat dinner and to try and be lighter and I would still be like

1116
01:01:47.721 --> 01:01:51.400
too heavy and then,
you know,
then I would eat,
you know,

1117
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:55.220
all this kind of fuck with you and give you like body image issues when you're

1118
01:01:55.221 --> 01:01:58.730
young and someone's telling you your shoe heavy and the yelling at you about

1119
01:01:58.731 --> 01:02:01.950
that different long time.
Yeah.

1120
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.790
16 year old girl and being told that you're,

1121
01:02:04.791 --> 01:02:06.200
you're like you're too fat or you're too,

1122
01:02:06.201 --> 01:02:08.810
but you know what should you be eating that all the time?
Constantly.

1123
01:02:08.811 --> 01:02:13.370
I thought if,
unless I wait exactly 63 kilograms.
I was ugly for the longest time.

1124
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:16.130
Yeah,
it took a while to get over.

1125
01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:20.160
That's why like I'm so big and be like doing like Bonnie and miss stuff and and

1126
01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:24.330
<v 6>like the do nothing bitch like shirts.
They all went to Didi Hirsch,
which is um,</v>

1127
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:27.210
it's like free like mental,
like mental health clinic.

1128
01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:30.360
That's like a 52 different schools around La that helps girls with,
you know,

1129
01:02:30.361 --> 01:02:32.580
body image and eating disorders and suicidal,

1130
01:02:32.581 --> 01:02:37.581
like all these different things to give like those kids treatment because I

1131
01:02:37.831 --> 01:02:38.870
didn't have anyone to talk to you.

1132
01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.390
I didn't even really know that I had that much of a problem.
But

1133
01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:47.470
<v 4>that old school mentality does produce mental toughness though.</v>

1134
01:02:47.471 --> 01:02:48.880
It's like such a catch 22.

1135
01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:53.830
It's the dumbest way to train to overtrain people and to make them fight whether

1136
01:02:53.831 --> 01:02:57.940
dehydrated or it's,
the issue with wrestlers is the issue with judo.

1137
01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:00.310
People with a lot of like old school martial arts people,

1138
01:03:00.311 --> 01:03:04.000
but I'm torn on it because on the other hand,

1139
01:03:04.001 --> 01:03:06.190
like who the fuck is tougher than wrestlers?

1140
01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:11.080
Like getting through that they developed this indomitable determination,

1141
01:03:11.350 --> 01:03:14.410
you know,
because they've gone,
they're so used to being uncomfortable.

1142
01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:16.930
They're so used to pushing when they're exhausted,

1143
01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:20.620
pushing when they're dehydrated,
pushing when they're not at their optimum.

1144
01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:21.903
I think there's a

1145
01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:24.260
<v 6>four.
I think when you're in a developmental phase,</v>

1146
01:03:24.261 --> 01:03:28.040
it's a good thing to be due to be overtraining a little bit and we made

1147
01:03:28.041 --> 01:03:31.040
uncomfortable and you know,
to have to run laps when your foot,

1148
01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.170
great personalities.

1149
01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:37.620
When you're a professional level and this is the time you need to perform.

1150
01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:41.630
Whatever personality you've developed is already developed by now.

1151
01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:43.790
Then as time to train professionally,

1152
01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:46.610
like we've had situations and sparring sessions,

1153
01:03:46.611 --> 01:03:50.630
like if one of my good guys or anybody gets cut with a punch,
you know,

1154
01:03:50.631 --> 01:03:53.480
they take a knee,
I didn't relax.
You know,
there's always another day.

1155
01:03:53.481 --> 01:03:57.020
You don't need that extra punishment to the head.
It's not healthy for you.

1156
01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:00.530
But some people don't understand that they pushed their fighters,

1157
01:04:01.070 --> 01:04:03.200
they get dropped and it's happened to,
you know,

1158
01:04:03.201 --> 01:04:07.040
even with champ or opponent get dropped and they keep on pushing and pushing.
Oh,

1159
01:04:07.041 --> 01:04:10.520
she's okay.
Go One more.
Boom,
dropped again.
Go One more.
That's not healthy.

1160
01:04:10.521 --> 01:04:12.860
You know,
you have to know where to push out a push,

1161
01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:15.200
but she's absolutely right about young gates.

1162
01:04:15.201 --> 01:04:18.740
Sometimes you want to create that personality not giving up and the only way to

1163
01:04:18.741 --> 01:04:22.310
do it as you got to be a little bit old school and hard on them,
you know,

1164
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:25.460
and she's had that,
but now it's,
she has that,

1165
01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:28.820
you do it more professional and more structured,
better.
You know?

1166
01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:32.330
Sparrings the right way.
Sparring partners,

1167
01:04:32.331 --> 01:04:35.240
everything is done for her and she loves it.
That's why she loves it.

1168
01:04:35.241 --> 01:04:37.310
That's what she said.
She didn't like that and now she loves it.

1169
01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.450
<v 4>Yeah.
That grind,</v>

1170
01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:43.340
the determination that you developed from that grind is rec irreplaceable?
Yeah.

1171
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:45.080
But once you have it for you,

1172
01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:48.800
is it a matter of just like keeping the sword sharp like,
well,
what do,

1173
01:04:48.801 --> 01:04:50.990
what keeps you or your motivation high

1174
01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:55.530
<v 6>at this point?
Oh,
oh,
just seems like unfinished,</v>

1175
01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:59.400
unfinished your life.
Your career.
Career is more left to do.

1176
01:04:59.401 --> 01:05:03.300
I don't feel like I'm done yet.
And because of what the Olympics is,

1177
01:05:03.301 --> 01:05:07.800
just like you wouldn't Olympic gold metal and you're done right with you have

1178
01:05:07.801 --> 01:05:08.790
seen,
what am I really done

1179
01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:11.940
<v 4>when you say you're done,
you might be done right now.</v>

1180
01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:13.700
He might walk out of here and go,
fuck this sport,

1181
01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:17.990
but I'm not going to go do movies.
Fuck up on the big scale.

1182
01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:22.090
<v 2>I mean you could really do whatever you want at this point,
right?
You're rich,</v>

1183
01:05:22.091 --> 01:05:25.420
you're famous.
You can do whatever you want.
You transcend to the sport or ready,

1184
01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:28.900
you know you can do whatever you want.
It feels unfinished though.

1185
01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:32.890
What would make it feel finished?
Cyborg.
That definitely would,

1186
01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:37.050
that's like she's your,
your Ivan Drago right.

1187
01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:41.740
She never stops off.
You know,
like I'll,
I'll,
I'll know,
you know,

1188
01:05:41.741 --> 01:05:44.760
I'll probably go a little longer waiting for her,
but you know,

1189
01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:47.400
if she showed up sooner rather than later,
you know,

1190
01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:49.900
I don't know how much longer I would go after that.

1191
01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:53.830
Well she seems to want you to fight her to have your weight,

1192
01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:57.700
which is very fascinating to me because,
um,
you know,

1193
01:05:57.701 --> 01:06:01.780
she knows that you're the 135 pound champ and she wants,

1194
01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:03.850
and she knows you fought at one 45 before,

1195
01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:08.130
so she wants you to fight where she is.
But she's clearly,
the thing is

1196
01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:12.440
<v 3>someone who uses stairways and I was kind of things they need that to mentally</v>

1197
01:06:12.441 --> 01:06:15.330
think that they have an advantage that they didn't earn bigger.

1198
01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:16.520
It's a crutch for her.

1199
01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:18.950
<v 2>She needs to feel</v>

1200
01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:24.030
<v 3>like she's somehow has an advantage from the outside because she doesn't think</v>

1201
01:06:24.791 --> 01:06:27.850
she's good enough with just what she has.
That's why.

1202
01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.290
That's why you dope in the first place.

1203
01:06:29.291 --> 01:06:31.360
Cause you feel like the best you have isn't good enough.

1204
01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:35.950
She feels like if we fight fair,
the best she has isn't going to be good enough.

1205
01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:38.710
That's why she wants it to be somehow stacked in our favor.

1206
01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:39.761
<v 2>Well,</v>

1207
01:06:39.761 --> 01:06:43.300
the steroid that she got caught with his story that allows you to keep size,

1208
01:06:43.570 --> 01:06:45.940
he keep your muscle while you're cutting weight.

1209
01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:49.130
It's a one of the best ones for that allows.

1210
01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:52.840
So she's obviously not just concerned with making the weight,

1211
01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:55.800
but concerned with making the weight and being big,
you know?
Yeah.

1212
01:06:55.930 --> 01:07:00.610
That's the thing.
Like if you could make weight and be on steroids,

1213
01:07:00.611 --> 01:07:04.750
even if it's,
uh,
making weight a relatively making weight friendly steroid,

1214
01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.690
you're still like without a,

1215
01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:10.150
you're capable of moving down and you see what happens to people when they

1216
01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:13.090
stopped,
when they get off the steroids,
you see what they look like.

1217
01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:15.520
It's very easy for them to drop down.
They immediately,

1218
01:07:15.521 --> 01:07:18.370
they immediately shrink up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It changes everything.

1219
01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:22.090
It changes everything and it's all like an insecurity thing.
That's all it is.

1220
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:26.680
It's a fascinating time when you see these guys that were on TRT or the people

1221
01:07:26.681 --> 01:07:31.420
that were involved in the urine testing,
which was like they would say,

1222
01:07:31.421 --> 01:07:33.040
is basically an intelligence test.

1223
01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:37.690
If you test after your fight and you're on steroids,
you're a fucking idiot.

1224
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:38.590
It's that simple.

1225
01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:42.470
But you could cycle all the way up until right before your fight.

1226
01:07:42.471 --> 01:07:46.780
If you use and the right stuff,
cycle off of it.
Weigh in,
fight,

1227
01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:47.740
do,

1228
01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:52.680
get your drug test and still test clean and so you're not really clean.
You,

1229
01:07:52.681 --> 01:07:56.350
you were never cleaned.
You would just clean enough to pass that task,

1230
01:07:56.351 --> 01:08:00.370
but your body's still had all the effects of those steroids.

1231
01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:02.050
You can't do that anymore.

1232
01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:06.160
This is Jeff Novitsky guy is not fucking playing games and the testing that

1233
01:08:06.161 --> 01:08:09.020
they're implementing on these athletes is no joke.
I mean,
they're,

1234
01:08:09.021 --> 01:08:11.920
they're going to show up at your fucking house.
The same that I did growing up,

1235
01:08:12.310 --> 01:08:16.250
I was under Messiah testing for now it's 14 years old.
And then when I started

1236
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:21.140
<v 0>doing MMA,
I was like,
really?
They just hand me a cup and say,</v>

1237
01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:24.770
go in this other room and come back with something.
I was a 14 year old girl.

1238
01:08:24.771 --> 01:08:28.310
They're like,
drop your pants,
pull up your shirt,
spin around in a circle.
Okay.

1239
01:08:28.311 --> 01:08:31.160
Make sure I can see it while you're pitting pitting and they're like,
you know,

1240
01:08:31.161 --> 01:08:33.680
it was like the most thorough and I remember the first time I was okay,

1241
01:08:33.681 --> 01:08:36.740
I drink eight bottles of water and be able to do it,
but I was so nervous,

1242
01:08:36.741 --> 01:08:38.870
you know and and I'm like,

1243
01:08:38.871 --> 01:08:43.871
wait a minute to fight for Strikeforce title or UFC title is less strict and you

1244
01:08:47.271 --> 01:08:51.980
know,
less thorough testing.
Then a 14 year old at the junior Miami youth in judo.

1245
01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:54.853
Think about that.

1246
01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:58.920
Crazy 14 year old at the junior Miami youth international and yeah,

1247
01:08:58.990 --> 01:09:02.620
<v 2>judo in Florida.
Well up until a few restrict your testing.</v>

1248
01:09:03.010 --> 01:09:06.520
Then the first couple of times I won the UFC title

1249
01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:11.300
<v 0>now,
now it's the same testing.
When they brought with Sada in to do the testing,</v>

1250
01:09:11.301 --> 01:09:12.740
I was like thank God.

1251
01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:15.890
And you know what's funny at the same chick that like was my auto competition

1252
01:09:15.891 --> 01:09:19.040
testing lady from when I was a kid.
She was like my same lady again.

1253
01:09:19.041 --> 01:09:23.110
She like showed up to the gym.
I was like,
oh my God,
that's hilarious.

1254
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:26.690
Because I was an out of competition testing too.

1255
01:09:26.691 --> 01:09:29.000
Like did it for so long and we're like having to fill out those forms all the

1256
01:09:29.001 --> 01:09:31.430
time was such a pain in the ass and now it's like,
it's really,
really,

1257
01:09:31.431 --> 01:09:35.180
really easy.
Like I'm out of competition testing was,

1258
01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:39.440
I hated it because of the paperwork,
but I was always so happy that they did it,

1259
01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:43.670
you know?
And now I'm like really confident with what the testing is for us now.

1260
01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:48.040
<v 2>It's pretty intense and it will absolutely weed out all the cheaters.</v>

1261
01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.150
It's just going to take time.

1262
01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:52.510
But for these guys that relied on it for the longest time,

1263
01:09:52.511 --> 01:09:55.630
you're seeing a difference in the way they look.
Yeah.
You know,
their,

1264
01:09:55.631 --> 01:09:57.730
their bodies are changing radically.

1265
01:09:58.050 --> 01:10:02.070
And I mean look at the difference in v Tor before and after the Weidman fights.

1266
01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:04.660
The thing like when you look at these people from before,

1267
01:10:04.661 --> 01:10:05.920
when they're using an after,
when they're not,

1268
01:10:05.921 --> 01:10:10.060
they look entirely different and cyber looks and ways exactly the same.

1269
01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:11.770
If she gets off,

1270
01:10:11.771 --> 01:10:14.590
it will be very easy for her to make white from what we've seen from every

1271
01:10:14.591 --> 01:10:17.170
single other person has.
Got It.
So you think she's still on it right now?

1272
01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:21.250
I think that it's possible.
It's very possible.

1273
01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.620
I can't like say the proof anything,
a lot of da.

1274
01:10:23.650 --> 01:10:28.650
But if you look the exact same as you did when you were using and what changed?

1275
01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:32.770
Did you ever see the video of her when she had her first fight?
Oh,

1276
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:36.220
when she's like tiny,
completely different word.
Plenty different body.
Yeah.

1277
01:10:36.330 --> 01:10:39.400
I miss a woman's body.
I mean we were like,
you know,
it was,
it very different.

1278
01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:42.970
I mean she's so thick now.
She's so thick and muscular and yeah,

1279
01:10:42.971 --> 01:10:46.840
I mean you get thick and muscular from hard work,
but boy she's,

1280
01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:51.540
the change is so radical.
It's such a giant difference.
So to see a,

1281
01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:55.270
I mean men can put that kind of size on through power lifting and hard way,

1282
01:10:55.271 --> 01:10:59.320
but see a woman put that kind of size on I kind of thickness this is the size.

1283
01:10:59.321 --> 01:11:00.670
I mean like the shape of your head

1284
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:06.550
and shoulders to the width of her shoulders,
like the whole deal.

1285
01:11:06.551 --> 01:11:10.930
Like when you add testosterone to a woman's body,
so many things change.
It's not,

1286
01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:14.970
I mean it's,
it's even more radical adding it to a man's body.
I mean,

1287
01:11:14.971 --> 01:11:16.530
when the guys were on the juice,
you know,

1288
01:11:16.531 --> 01:11:18.330
they get bigger and thicker and everything like that,

1289
01:11:18.331 --> 01:11:22.200
but they're just bigger and thicker men.
When a woman goes on the juice,
it's,

1290
01:11:22.201 --> 01:11:24.210
you're taking a woman who you,
you know,

1291
01:11:24.211 --> 01:11:28.500
your body only has a certain amount of testosterone that's being produced.

1292
01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:29.281
That's it.

1293
01:11:29.281 --> 01:11:33.870
It's a very small amount and then when you add all this extra tests to it,

1294
01:11:34.050 --> 01:11:37.050
me see what happens with transgender women when women turn into

1295
01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:41.160
<v 3>very,
it's very similar to the hormone therapy that</v>

1296
01:11:41.690 --> 01:11:44.750
<v 2>well,
woman to man transgender goes through.
Yeah,
exactly.
Exactly.</v>

1297
01:11:44.751 --> 01:11:47.570
One thing I'm like,
yeah,
and they'd be,
man,
man.
Yeah.

1298
01:11:47.690 --> 01:11:51.830
You literally do turn into a man.
Everything changes.
Your bone structure changes,

1299
01:11:51.831 --> 01:11:56.510
you get thicker.
You're,
you mean the shoulders,
the face,
everything.
It all,

1300
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:59.540
it's like changes your ability to take punishment as well.

1301
01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:00.890
That's what's really weird.

1302
01:12:00.891 --> 01:12:03.380
Like the different stream guys who are on it and off of it,

1303
01:12:03.650 --> 01:12:05.180
their ability to take a shot.

1304
01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:09.920
Like you see the difference in their ability to absorb punches or they get off

1305
01:12:09.921 --> 01:12:13.070
of it and one punch and did their legs go.
It's,
it's crazy.

1306
01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:17.490
<v 3>It's the confidence too.
It really is.
If you walk in there with confidence,</v>

1307
01:12:17.491 --> 01:12:19.740
like there's no way this person's going to touch me and the hit you,

1308
01:12:19.741 --> 01:12:23.580
you don't care if you walk in there without those,
those,

1309
01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:28.100
it's what it is.
Like doping is,
is a mental handicap.
Mm.

1310
01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:31.560
And when they use,
it's the mental crutch.

1311
01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:35.430
Like when you take that off,
it's not just what they physically lose,

1312
01:12:35.431 --> 01:12:38.190
it's what they mentally lose.
And that's the hardest thing for them to let go.

1313
01:12:38.191 --> 01:12:41.100
You'll use once and you're going to have that forever.

1314
01:12:41.250 --> 01:12:44.080
You're going to have that mental handicap forever and there's no way you can get

1315
01:12:44.081 --> 01:12:45.330
it.
You can fix it.

1316
01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:45.991
<v 2>Right.</v>

1317
01:12:45.991 --> 01:12:50.340
You'll always know that you used and you always know that it helped you and
your,

1318
01:12:50.341 --> 01:12:52.320
and you'll always feel like less without it.
Yeah.

1319
01:12:52.321 --> 01:12:55.080
Because when you have it like the,
the guys that are juiced up,

1320
01:12:55.081 --> 01:12:57.750
they feel like they're fucking superman.
You know,

1321
01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:00.240
like when you go back to the early days of the UFC,

1322
01:13:00.241 --> 01:13:03.420
when you could just do whatever the fuck you wanted.
I go back to the pride days.

1323
01:13:03.450 --> 01:13:08.100
Those are my favorite days.
Fucking like,
I dunno what an Vander lay was doing,

1324
01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:11.670
but I'm assuming everything,
you know,
I don't know.

1325
01:13:11.671 --> 01:13:14.730
But I mean he was like one of my all time favorite fighters to watch cause it

1326
01:13:14.731 --> 01:13:15.960
wasn't even like watching a human,

1327
01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:21.170
it was like watching some rabid hyena that took a human form and learned Moitai

1328
01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:23.490
Ron across the cage,

1329
01:13:23.850 --> 01:13:28.440
the fucking shit out of you and stop your head when you were down.
It was wild,

1330
01:13:28.441 --> 01:13:32.610
crazy shit to watch.
But it was just,
it was a human,

1331
01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:37.920
it was just so far gone off the hormone hormone spectrum.

1332
01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.630
<v 3>And that's the thing I like.
You get into a setting where everyone's doing it,</v>

1333
01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:45.980
then you're hitting and punching harder than a person should write and you're

1334
01:13:45.981 --> 01:13:49.340
taking more damage and more punishment than a person's shoe.

1335
01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:52.370
And that is how someone is going to eventually die.

1336
01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:57.220
<v 2>Hmm.
Well one of the big concerns with me is the lack of,
um,
the,</v>

1337
01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:00.560
when they're trying to take out the ivs and I understand why they're doing it

1338
01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:04.910
because a,
they're trying to stop people from masking doping.

1339
01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:08.750
Like Novitsky came on my podcast and explained it to me that there has been

1340
01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:12.100
instances where people used bags.
Yeah.

1341
01:14:12.101 --> 01:14:17.101
Flushes your system out and somehow or another can mask and also blood doping

1342
01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:19.600
and blood doping is totally legit.

1343
01:14:19.630 --> 01:14:22.930
They've used it in cycling for years where you take your blood out,
you know,

1344
01:14:22.931 --> 01:14:25.570
your body replenishes the blood and you put that blog back in right before you

1345
01:14:25.571 --> 01:14:28.930
fight.
I know that people have done that before.
Was shocking to me.

1346
01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:33.931
Is that the you a UFC in Nevada state athletic commission just like just a few

1347
01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:37.030
years ago.
It wasn't even testing for EPO.
It wasn't that long ago.

1348
01:14:37.031 --> 01:14:41.470
It was like less than a decade.
Like EPO wasn't something that they tested for,

1349
01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:43.570
which is crazy cause it's,

1350
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:48.830
I mean if anything relies on endurance is a critical factor and endurance.

1351
01:14:49.841 --> 01:14:52.810
It's finding,
it's one of the,
the most critical factors.
Cause if,

1352
01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:55.960
if you're running in a race and you're slower because you're tired,

1353
01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.640
you don't get kicked in the face,
you know,

1354
01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:02.710
the differences.

1355
01:15:02.710 --> 01:15:06.970
So giant in the fact that they didn't take that into consideration when all

1356
01:15:06.971 --> 01:15:07.840
those years,

1357
01:15:07.841 --> 01:15:12.841
all those years they had been testing cyclist for it and even testing them,

1358
01:15:13.091 --> 01:15:14.740
they were still doing it.
They're still pulling it off.

1359
01:15:14.741 --> 01:15:17.460
There's still cheating and uh,
the fact that they'll,

1360
01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:21.090
they can test plastics in the blood from the ivy bag.

1361
01:15:21.091 --> 01:15:22.450
That it's fascinating to me.

1362
01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:26.420
<v 3>That's amazing.
I mean I'm,
I'm completely supportive.
Ib like Bam,</v>

1363
01:15:27.050 --> 01:15:30.650
even even just for weight cutting.
Did you ever use them for weight cutting?

1364
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:36.490
Once in 2005 right before the world championships in Egypt and Cairo.

1365
01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:44.060
And it was the worst ever because in judo you have like an hour and a half

1366
01:15:44.061 --> 01:15:45.730
sometimes from when to when you're going to go on,

1367
01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:48.560
then you're in a fight like seven times,
you know,
it's crazy.

1368
01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:53.010
And so I got the opportunity is Geez,

1369
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:56.490
it because a friend of mine had it and it wasn't,
you know,
it was still legal,
uh,

1370
01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:59.030
back then it wasn't,
you know,
it wasn't a thing.
So I wasn't like I was cheating.

1371
01:15:59.031 --> 01:16:00.080
It's just in,
you know,
other people.

1372
01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:02.450
I just didn't have the means to do it and other people did.

1373
01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:06.710
And so I got the opportunity to use it and I was like,
all right,
I'll try it out.

1374
01:16:06.710 --> 01:16:09.350
I had a really,
really bad way cut.
I was,
you know,

1375
01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:11.020
kind of like being a dumb kid and I was,

1376
01:16:11.021 --> 01:16:14.330
this is after I ran away from home and I had a terrible cut.
It was like 2005.

1377
01:16:14.331 --> 01:16:18.860
It was like,
yeah,
that same year.
And um,
I ended up getting chills,

1378
01:16:18.861 --> 01:16:21.710
like my whole body got chills.
Like my whole body was swollen.

1379
01:16:21.711 --> 01:16:25.910
I've never felt that slow in that terrible.
Like it was the worst thing.

1380
01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:29.810
I would have been the ivy from the IV.
Yeah,
I was at a Dema.
Did you have a Dema?

1381
01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:31.530
Was that a yes?

1382
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:33.040
<v 2>Listening to an issue that,
uh,</v>

1383
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:37.970
people get when they have id Ivs for some reason your body does.

1384
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
It just reacts in some sort of a strange way with the water.

1385
01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.980
<v 3>Uh,
no,
but I always remember I got chills.</v>

1386
01:16:42.981 --> 01:16:47.150
Like I couldn't stop myself from shivering and like I was really,

1387
01:16:47.151 --> 01:16:50.660
really slow and sluggish and I absolutely hated it.

1388
01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:54.720
I hated it and never did it again.
When she told me she doesn't do it for Mna,

1389
01:16:54.730 --> 01:16:57.410
when she started her career,
I said,
I love it.
It's so great.

1390
01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.590
That was none of my boxers do it.
Yeah.
And if,
if,

1391
01:17:00.860 --> 01:17:03.310
if you need medical attention from cutting weight shoes,

1392
01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:06.320
you're in the wrong division.
There's a lot of people on the wrong vision.

1393
01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:09.980
You can't,
you just drink normally.
You're not sick where you can,
you know,
raise

1394
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:13.040
<v 6>your hand and drink.
Normal issue is rehydrating the brain.</v>

1395
01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:16.710
That's one of the big ones.
Rehydrating the brain takes a long time all day.

1396
01:17:20.030 --> 01:17:22.090
I was like,
what?
I got 24 hours,

1397
01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:26.990
24 hours and I don't have been out because then you don't have to have an hour

1398
01:17:26.991 --> 01:17:31.010
and a half to three hours and out the wind like four times a month or something

1399
01:17:31.011 --> 01:17:32.360
like that.
I mean that's really like,

1400
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:36.170
I couldn't do that fighting Lind 35 now the difference though is that that

1401
01:17:36.171 --> 01:17:39.960
involves grappling only and even though there are some head impacts me,

1402
01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:43.880
it's not the same.
Joe,
we do training camp before sharp at Lake,
let's say,

1403
01:17:43.881 --> 01:17:47.330
depending on the fight were sharp ed 147 pounds,

1404
01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:50.570
148 pounds,
right?
She's sharp,
she's explosive.

1405
01:17:50.571 --> 01:17:55.040
One 49 let's say you drink gradually and you make that weight during the fight.

1406
01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:59.150
Even heavyweights in boxing,
look at their weight.
It's not in every way.

1407
01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:02.210
You could go up as much as you want and you have to know where you're strong.

1408
01:18:02.211 --> 01:18:05.570
Get right during training,
right,
so you just drink.

1409
01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:08.810
You'd become one 48 four nine you're good to go.
You fight.
What's the problem?

1410
01:18:08.811 --> 01:18:12.290
Why would you do ivy to get boom right away or bloated?

1411
01:18:12.291 --> 01:18:15.860
That's why most of these guys in MMA can't move.
Sometimes they're not as sharp,

1412
01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:19.850
they're young and when they move and I look at them,
I'm like,

1413
01:18:19.851 --> 01:18:22.360
why are they so slow?
Sometimes you,
you know,

1414
01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:25.640
compare it to boxing and you see those guys,
old school fighters,

1415
01:18:25.641 --> 01:18:29.300
they're in their forties there were quick and explosive.
None of them do ivy.

1416
01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:32.660
They don't do ivy boxers don't use ivs.
I don't use it.

1417
01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:36.410
But what about radical weight cuts stuff?
You make it like a guy like Julio,

1418
01:18:36.411 --> 01:18:40.250
Cesar Chavez Jr.
He cuts a lot of wind,
a lot of weight.
Probably.
He uses it.

1419
01:18:40.251 --> 01:18:43.580
That's why he's so slow.
What happened to him?
You see him as being the greatest.

1420
01:18:43.581 --> 01:18:46.430
He's a young guy.
You sometimes you face,
he's like,
cause I'm being,

1421
01:18:46.431 --> 01:18:47.840
I think he's getting too much buzzy.

1422
01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:54.350
Good luck.
Discipline.
Discipline does.
Yeah,
there's definitely a lack of that,

1423
01:18:54.351 --> 01:18:58.460
but I think that's what it ends of that.
But God,
you start handling it,
the sharp,

1424
01:18:58.461 --> 01:19:01.230
I don't think you need that.
You don't need that.
I don't believe in it.
I mean,

1425
01:19:02.090 --> 01:19:03.230
I think you're correct,

1426
01:19:03.231 --> 01:19:06.530
but I think there are a lot of issues where there's just not enough weight

1427
01:19:06.531 --> 01:19:10.370
classes.
I think,
um,
there's a lot of issues where guys are tweeners,
you know,

1428
01:19:10.371 --> 01:19:11.080
they're not,

1429
01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:15.140
if they're not quite gap you're talking about is too much in boxing we have two

1430
01:19:15.141 --> 01:19:18.610
pounds to 10 pounds is so bad,
but there's,

1431
01:19:18.850 --> 01:19:22.300
there's like 85 to two oh five is crazy.
That's a giant jump.
Two,
two,

1432
01:19:22.301 --> 01:19:26.870
two oh five to two 65 is fucking nuts.
I mean that's a nutty one.
Yeah.

1433
01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.750
I think there should be a to 25 for sure.
What you're saying is they,

1434
01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:33.770
it's too much of a difference when they go down so low then they want to gain
it.

1435
01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:37.050
The only way is to stick an IV in there so you can know,
um,

1436
01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:40.520
gained that weight quicker.
But I think 24 hours is enough for you.

1437
01:19:40.521 --> 01:19:42.740
Like if you could raise your hand and drink water.

1438
01:19:42.741 --> 01:19:45.590
I think ivs for people that when they're sick and you know,

1439
01:19:45.591 --> 01:19:49.090
they're throwing up and they can't like move,
they're exhausted.
You,
you know,

1440
01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:52.460
you're right on there.
And so they could recover.
That's the purpose of life,
me,

1441
01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:56.480
right?
It is.
I don't believe it helps it all.

1442
01:19:56.481 --> 01:19:57.560
I think it's a hindrance.

1443
01:19:57.830 --> 01:20:01.490
But if you're having a terrible weight cut and you're really worried about this

1444
01:20:01.491 --> 01:20:05.540
fight,
it's really,
it helps put your mind at ease.
If you think,
oh no,
no,

1445
01:20:05.541 --> 01:20:06.021
it's fine.

1446
01:20:06.021 --> 01:20:09.070
I'll have an IV and like the magical tier and it's like this bad way cut.

1447
01:20:09.071 --> 01:20:11.140
Never happen.
Well they,

1448
01:20:11.141 --> 01:20:15.570
they do think that is the better way to replenish the fluid in the brain.

1449
01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:20.250
It's still takes 70 something hours to fully replenished guys that the guys that

1450
01:20:20.251 --> 01:20:23.070
use it.
What I notice is when they're warming up in the locker room,

1451
01:20:23.071 --> 01:20:24.810
like I see them during training,
right?

1452
01:20:25.010 --> 01:20:28.230
So I know how there's people that sweat more than the others.

1453
01:20:28.231 --> 01:20:31.530
So you know the athlete,
but the guys that use it right in the locker room,

1454
01:20:31.531 --> 01:20:33.990
when they're starting their warm up there sweating,

1455
01:20:33.991 --> 01:20:37.320
you see that the body's not crisp and sharp.
You know,

1456
01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.280
it's something that the normal,
yeah,

1457
01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:43.010
it's something that I don't see usually during training because if you're

1458
01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:45.870
drinking your water,
you're coming to training,
you're normal,
you're fit,

1459
01:20:45.871 --> 01:20:48.690
you're healthy.
Let's add one 50 or whatever it is,
right?

1460
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:51.910
I know that athlete and we're on the pads,
you sharp,
you know,

1461
01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:54.870
wrestling this and that.
He's looking good,
sweating normally.

1462
01:20:54.871 --> 01:20:56.940
And then you see during the fight they were,

1463
01:20:56.941 --> 01:21:01.050
this person hasn't even warmed up and soaking wet.

1464
01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:04.140
There's too much in your body because you're right,

1465
01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:08.250
your body can only absorb water back as fast as it does.

1466
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:11.250
Why does it expel that much and only keep so much?

1467
01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:15.000
Because that's what's best for it.
It does it that way because it's best for it.

1468
01:21:15.001 --> 01:21:17.750
Not because you know,
it's suddenly just,
you know,

1469
01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:20.250
while it was evolving and I was like,
oh this is the best I could do,

1470
01:21:20.430 --> 01:21:22.300
or your body doesn't understand dehydrating.

1471
01:21:22.301 --> 01:21:25.800
And then 24 hours later going into a hand to hand combat situation.

1472
01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:28.570
Nobody understands that.
Like,
you know,
you're living in Africa,

1473
01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.840
there's not that much water.
And you know,

1474
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:34.380
there could only be one day of rain and you know,

1475
01:21:34.381 --> 01:21:37.860
like all dry up the next day and you need to drink as much as possible and then

1476
01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:40.980
your shadow.
I got a water for a while.
You know,

1477
01:21:40.981 --> 01:21:44.820
these kind of situations happen for many,
many,
many years.

1478
01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:49.800
And why do we only,
we hydrate as fast as we do.
Nature never developed an ivy.

1479
01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:53.330
That's why I treated Campbell's.

1480
01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:56.980
Campbell's can rehydrate faster and us,
right.
They can hold a lot more water.
Yes.

1481
01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:58.470
All that stuff.
So it's just like,

1482
01:21:58.471 --> 01:22:00.840
it's physically possible for you to evolve that way.

1483
01:22:00.841 --> 01:22:04.200
So why did we evolve this way?
Well there are people though that are champions,

1484
01:22:04.201 --> 01:22:07.320
like Weidman cuts a lot of weight and I don't know how he's going to do with the

1485
01:22:07.321 --> 01:22:10.050
ivy ban because a,
he's a big boy,
you know?

1486
01:22:10.051 --> 01:22:14.420
Weidman's well over 200 pounds gets down to one 85 I think during the training.

1487
01:22:14.421 --> 01:22:17.220
If they do the training right and they see where he sharp out,

1488
01:22:17.221 --> 01:22:20.040
how they could deal with it.
You know,
if you're mentally tough,

1489
01:22:20.041 --> 01:22:22.650
you could gradually drifted.
It just drink throughout the day.

1490
01:22:22.651 --> 01:22:25.990
100% of you'll be okay.
I think.
I don't believe in it.

1491
01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:28.770
We're also going to get smaller.
They're going to have to get physically smaller.

1492
01:22:28.771 --> 01:22:31.860
They're going to have to not only about being how big,
you know,

1493
01:22:31.861 --> 01:22:34.590
you see these guys are,
you're not bloated,
but they can't move.

1494
01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:38.100
I don't want to be that way either.
Speed kills.
Remember,
we know that.

1495
01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:40.890
Everybody knows that that speeds.
Very,
very important.

1496
01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.770
The problem is with a lot of people there,

1497
01:22:42.771 --> 01:22:45.390
they're worried about being smothered by a bigger guy.

1498
01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:47.200
They're worried about being held and got to learn.

1499
01:22:47.201 --> 01:22:50.300
You learn not to get smothered.
They got to know how to fight.
You know?

1500
01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:53.190
They got to learn not to lie down on their back and let somebody be on top of

1501
01:22:53.191 --> 01:22:55.740
them.
Get out of that position filled the established way.

1502
01:22:55.741 --> 01:22:57.330
The things have been for a long time.

1503
01:22:57.331 --> 01:23:01.760
So now that this breakup and the established way,
exactly it's going to cost.
Just

1504
01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:07.420
like I stopped weightlifting a long time ago and then almost two years ago now

1505
01:23:07.421 --> 01:23:11.180
because weights no strength and conditioning for her bulky.

1506
01:23:11.230 --> 01:23:13.850
If you don't do any strength and conditioning are only two pound dumbbell

1507
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.020
shadowboxing.
Do you worry at all about like injury prevention?

1508
01:23:17.021 --> 01:23:19.840
It's one of the benefits of strength and conditioning they think is injury

1509
01:23:19.841 --> 01:23:24.220
prevention.
They can,
you know,
strengthen up areas,
joints back if I,

1510
01:23:24.221 --> 01:23:24.941
if anything's wrong,

1511
01:23:24.941 --> 01:23:27.490
you know I can go see like a physical therapist and he could not give me stuff

1512
01:23:27.491 --> 01:23:28.420
to do or whatever.

1513
01:23:28.450 --> 01:23:33.400
But I mean I have such a base of doing straight conditioning for so many,

1514
01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:38.860
so many years.
That's like my [inaudible] is balanced the way it is.
You know,

1515
01:23:38.861 --> 01:23:42.040
there's not like an imbalance and I had to make up for it through strength and

1516
01:23:42.041 --> 01:23:43.690
conditioning and yeah,
I don't want to.

1517
01:23:43.691 --> 01:23:48.190
And now it's like I'm worried about being too bulked up where I can't fight the

1518
01:23:48.191 --> 01:23:52.150
way I want to find quicker hens or how explosive combination.
She's fluid.

1519
01:23:52.151 --> 01:23:54.940
She does a stretching.
She does two pound dumbbell workouts,

1520
01:23:54.941 --> 01:23:58.870
which in the 10th round she's averaging in the shadow boxing.

1521
01:23:58.871 --> 01:24:00.870
When she said her works again,
we know if we're on the shadow box,

1522
01:24:00.871 --> 01:24:02.150
she's not going to be fucking Gary.

1523
01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:04.750
I always say she's not gonna just do it so it can look pretty.

1524
01:24:04.751 --> 01:24:06.210
She's really shadowboxing.

1525
01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:10.120
She imagines there's an opponent in front of her and she has to kill them.

1526
01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:12.190
Throws 500 how many?

1527
01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:17.280
Five 75 575 punches in three minutes with a pound pound dumbbell.

1528
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:18.310
That's ridiculous.

1529
01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:23.310
That's automatically strength and conditioning plus 10 plus 10 that you know

1530
01:24:23.651 --> 01:24:27.940
you're going to be fine.
Your hands in the 10th round,
10 rounds of the unit.

1531
01:24:27.970 --> 01:24:30.100
Their boxing.
I always say in their shadow boxing,

1532
01:24:30.101 --> 01:24:34.000
this is not sure of us and as you just loosening up up,
up,
right.
But she does it.

1533
01:24:34.001 --> 01:24:37.780
You're not throws the punches with the weights,
with intention,
with intention.

1534
01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:42.340
And then we go to Santa Monica stairs.
She gets her legs.

1535
01:24:42.370 --> 01:24:45.220
She does her core.
She,
there's 2000 sit ups every day.
Oh,

1536
01:24:45.250 --> 01:24:46.970
so you are doing conditioning is,
yeah,

1537
01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:50.420
but it's not like have years in patio,

1538
01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:55.120
like doing cleans or bench pressing or like do you ever see like Mayweather or

1539
01:24:55.121 --> 01:24:56.110
doing anything like that?

1540
01:24:56.111 --> 01:24:59.830
And did you ever see like any of those great I did was Muhammad Ali,

1541
01:24:59.831 --> 01:25:03.250
like hitting the iron or anything like that.
You know,
none of that word.

1542
01:25:03.251 --> 01:25:05.530
And there's a reason for that fight physical,

1543
01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:08.500
whatever is fighting we and then the time,
right?

1544
01:25:08.530 --> 01:25:12.190
How much you do and what you do and he doesn't know what you're doing.

1545
01:25:12.191 --> 01:25:15.380
It at devil's advocate though,
Hoffeld Dolson Jolson,

1546
01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:19.300
his last fight against Anthony Pettis was that he pushed them all in the most

1547
01:25:19.301 --> 01:25:22.600
ferocious paces I've ever seen for a five round fight.

1548
01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:25.630
And he went through an extensive strength and conditioning program with nick

1549
01:25:25.631 --> 01:25:30.220
curse on one of the guys who was a disciple of mob Marinovich and I had curse on

1550
01:25:30.221 --> 01:25:32.080
the podcast,
explained to me all the different stuff.

1551
01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:33.250
They had to do a lot of pliers,

1552
01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:37.330
a lot of explosive drills and different than lifting though.
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1553
01:25:37.670 --> 01:25:40.730
We do conditioning,
but we don't do like lifting,
right?
Yeah.

1554
01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:45.280
A lot of people think that lifting in fact slows you down and provides you with

1555
01:25:45.281 --> 01:25:48.610
an unknown,
an unnatural workload on your muscles,

1556
01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:51.730
which fucks you up and training because you like your bench.

1557
01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:53.260
Like if you do bench press all the time,

1558
01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:56.740
like your chest is all fucked up and sore,
so that way when you're training,

1559
01:25:56.830 --> 01:25:59.290
you're going to like,
you're going to have this issue.
You're,

1560
01:25:59.291 --> 01:26:02.110
you're sore and you're all ripped up.
Your chest,
as you know,

1561
01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:04.130
is all filled with lactic acid

1562
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:07.640
<v 1>and you're right about,
doesn't use,
did an absolutely great job.</v>

1563
01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:11.510
He was physically amazingly fit.
And I know the guy you're talking about,

1564
01:26:11.511 --> 01:26:14.210
he did a hell of a job,
but it's the training also,

1565
01:26:14.370 --> 01:26:16.070
Rafael Cordeiro done an amazing job,

1566
01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:19.550
hunters tactical approach to it and there is all of it combined,

1567
01:26:19.551 --> 01:26:23.630
but he knew that he needs to win that fight,

1568
01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:26.330
not only with the tactical aspect of it,

1569
01:26:26.331 --> 01:26:30.650
with the physical ability to conditioning.
So he did his job right.

1570
01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:32.480
When you have an athlete,

1571
01:26:32.810 --> 01:26:35.900
you need to know what you need to do to make that athlete.

1572
01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:40.970
Her guild was fastest and the strongest fighter.
Rhonda,

1573
01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:45.440
we're talking about Cyborg gear.
Rhonda with one hand,
we'll toss around Cyborg.

1574
01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:50.500
She will know where she is even at one 45 the problem is it has to be fair,

1575
01:26:50.690 --> 01:26:54.440
a fight,
and we do it pure.
She's never,

1576
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:58.790
you know,
done anything unfair when it comes down to sports.

1577
01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:01.640
And she fought at one 45 like I said before,

1578
01:27:01.670 --> 01:27:05.600
is because she would walk around one 48 people wouldn't want to fight her.

1579
01:27:05.630 --> 01:27:09.410
So we said she could jump in and fight tomorrow for her to get experience

1580
01:27:09.411 --> 01:27:11.990
because she was always training,
but nobody would want to fight her.

1581
01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:16.430
So when they call you one day before for a fight,
would you be willing,

1582
01:27:16.431 --> 01:27:19.700
you're a fighter to fight at one 35 when you're walking around one 48

1583
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:23.990
[inaudible] 45 of course one 45 why would you lose all that weight in one day?

1584
01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:27.320
Right?
And when you know you're a fire is a monster,
she'll beat anybody.

1585
01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:28.430
Of course.

1586
01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:32.870
Fight at one 45 so when you fight at one 35 how much weight are you cutting to

1587
01:27:32.871 --> 01:27:36.950
get down to their 15 pounds?
So he cut 15 pounds in.
How long?

1588
01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:39.643
<v 3>Um,</v>

1589
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:44.830
I mean I get around 10 over like three days before 10 over.

1590
01:27:44.871 --> 01:27:47.870
So it sounds the last three days.
So it's,
is it a,

1591
01:27:47.871 --> 01:27:51.110
just watching your diet and coming back on your water?

1592
01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:55.700
Her pretty much the lightest that I could get with that.
You know,

1593
01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:00.560
that like I can't lose any more fat when I'm at like 43 and then like the last

1594
01:28:00.561 --> 01:28:03.470
like eight pounds has to be water cause that's just,
you know,

1595
01:28:03.650 --> 01:28:05.090
I just can't get any smaller than that.

1596
01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:09.680
That's when you get like super lean like right before the wagons.
And um,

1597
01:28:09.890 --> 01:28:12.680
if you,
if you ever consider,
I mean,

1598
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:16.880
what do you think about the idea of fighters not cutting any weight at all?

1599
01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:21.470
I mean it seems to be almost a necessary evil at this stage of the game,

1600
01:28:21.471 --> 01:28:25.580
but I really wish it weren't and I really would like to see fighters just fight

1601
01:28:25.581 --> 01:28:30.140
at whatever is the healthiest weight for them.
I feel like I'm actually like,

1602
01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:34.460
and my best shape and the best fighter that I possibly can be.

1603
01:28:34.461 --> 01:28:39.461
If I make 35 and then go back up to like 47 48 the next day,

1604
01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:43.760
like why would that be better than if you fought at one 48 if you just felt like

1605
01:28:43.761 --> 01:28:45.230
you just didn't cut any weight at all?

1606
01:28:45.310 --> 01:28:48.620
So much more disciplined in order to to to do that,

1607
01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:53.120
to get to the 45 I could feel a whole lot more.
You know what I mean?

1608
01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:56.480
I can kind of blur the lines of my diet a level.

1609
01:28:56.481 --> 01:28:57.430
I won't have to be so disappointed.

1610
01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.230
Wouldn't have to beat so many ounces at this hour for weeks and weeks and weeks

1611
01:29:00.231 --> 01:29:01.064
ahead of time.

1612
01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:06.080
And so I feel like when I'm at the point where I'm about to actually go fight,

1613
01:29:06.810 --> 01:29:09.420
I don't feel the weight cut from the day before.
Like I,

1614
01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:14.400
it's this crazy feeling where I feel like I'm inhabiting this body that I only

1615
01:29:14.401 --> 01:29:19.110
have for like a day.
Like my,
my,
my fight night body.

1616
01:29:19.111 --> 01:29:22.560
It's like everything is peaked up to that day and it's what I'm finally like

1617
01:29:22.561 --> 01:29:25.980
inhabiting this body that can like,
like I feel like a fucking Ninja dude.

1618
01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:30.390
Me Right now is not right.

1619
01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:34.210
<v 2>You know when you hit the gym right now start training [inaudible] I know we're</v>

1620
01:29:34.330 --> 01:29:38.380
going to go back and show them how it is,
but you don't know like

1621
01:29:38.490 --> 01:29:38.671
<v 3>yeah,</v>

1622
01:29:38.671 --> 01:29:43.110
I can describe to you a Howard feels like after all that work and all of that

1623
01:29:43.111 --> 01:29:46.890
perfect food and perpetrating perfect peaking and it's all like done and it's

1624
01:29:46.891 --> 01:29:48.090
all like been fine tuned.

1625
01:29:48.091 --> 01:29:51.690
So I could be the best that it possibly like is physically possible for the

1626
01:29:51.691 --> 01:29:55.470
human form to be for this 24 hour period that I have.

1627
01:29:55.710 --> 01:29:57.570
Like I'm perfectly peaked.

1628
01:29:58.530 --> 01:30:02.760
It feels fucking amazing and I don't think I could get that feeling without

1629
01:30:02.910 --> 01:30:05.160
cutting the 35 first.
Wow.
That's fast.

1630
01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:07.280
<v 1>And then when you're hungry,
you know your opponent,</v>

1631
01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:09.320
you have to punish them for that.
You know,

1632
01:30:09.450 --> 01:30:13.360
<v 3>you think about it like when you actually get to put on like a four ounce gloves</v>

1633
01:30:13.690 --> 01:30:18.610
and he does like,
um,
his rap,
he does the best rap like ever.
It's,

1634
01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:19.480
it's unbelievable.

1635
01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:23.680
But like this is a fight that day wrap is like different than his training rap.

1636
01:30:23.910 --> 01:30:27.040
Like when I actually have that wrap on and those small gloves on,

1637
01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:29.140
like I feel like I could rob a fucking liquor store

1638
01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.100
<v 2>and we don't need her liquor store.
Something better.</v>

1639
01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:42.000
That's why you started about what will I will tell you.

1640
01:30:42.001 --> 01:30:46.230
I like when you guys first started working together.
I mean,
she was,

1641
01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:49.370
she was describing it like you,
you knew that she was a,

1642
01:30:49.380 --> 01:30:52.290
a judo player and she was getting into MMA.

1643
01:30:52.530 --> 01:30:55.110
Like what was like the first couple of training sessions when

1644
01:30:55.110 --> 01:30:58.410
<v 1>she came in?
I didn't want to train her because I had my hands full and I had,</v>

1645
01:30:58.411 --> 01:30:58.980
you know,

1646
01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:03.980
mm hmm Vantis Marty rose in WBC champion and Olympian and Vic and I was working

1647
01:31:05.041 --> 01:31:07.530
with all of them and I was like,
what is this girl doing?
You know,

1648
01:31:07.531 --> 01:31:10.740
what is she gonna do with this?
Right.
Is she serious?
Is She not?

1649
01:31:10.741 --> 01:31:14.190
And I don't like to jump into things.
I like to wait till it's the right time.

1650
01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:14.611
Timing.

1651
01:31:14.611 --> 01:31:18.390
I feel like for me as the most important thing that I've learned throughout my

1652
01:31:18.391 --> 01:31:18.961
career,
you know,

1653
01:31:18.961 --> 01:31:23.760
I opened up a gym when I was 16 years old and doing all of this,

1654
01:31:23.761 --> 01:31:27.330
I learned that patients sometimes on timing is very important because in my life

1655
01:31:27.331 --> 01:31:30.090
I went through a lot of hard days because I was a kid myself,

1656
01:31:30.091 --> 01:31:32.910
didn't understand what I'm getting into and I've been through a lot of tough

1657
01:31:32.911 --> 01:31:35.850
days.
So I like to stay patient and just watch and see,

1658
01:31:36.030 --> 01:31:39.370
figure out what the person wants to do with their life and then I could guide

1659
01:31:39.371 --> 01:31:44.340
them if I can,
I will.
If I can't,
I'll give him a pointer.
You know,

1660
01:31:44.341 --> 01:31:48.180
you could do it better with this person or you do it this way and some listen

1661
01:31:48.181 --> 01:31:51.150
and some don't.
We know that Ron is an amazing student.

1662
01:31:51.570 --> 01:31:55.770
I figured out right away because within the three,
four months she was in my gym,

1663
01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:57.300
I would tell her,
go ahead,
stay on the bag.

1664
01:31:57.301 --> 01:32:01.060
And she would go hit the bag and really hit the bag until I paid attention to

1665
01:32:01.061 --> 01:32:01.691
her again.

1666
01:32:01.691 --> 01:32:05.440
She would have a lot of patients and she would be understanding and she would

1667
01:32:05.441 --> 01:32:09.670
work very hard.
But after like three,
four months being in the gym,

1668
01:32:09.671 --> 01:32:13.480
I gave her maybe a few pointers and then when they call me he said it was,

1669
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:15.000
they called me literally the day of the,

1670
01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:17.200
the day that they got her an amateur fight.

1671
01:32:17.530 --> 01:32:19.750
So they called me and manager called me and was like,
hey,

1672
01:32:19.751 --> 01:32:21.730
we got fight for Ronda and you know,

1673
01:32:21.731 --> 01:32:26.140
are you in the area you think you could come through?
I just honor what hit me.

1674
01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:29.110
But I was like,
maybe I should respect this girl.
You know,

1675
01:32:29.111 --> 01:32:32.980
she's a Olympic medalist and everybody's talking about Rhonda is a Olympic

1676
01:32:32.981 --> 01:32:36.790
medalist,
you know,
she's,
she's a cool girl,
this and that.
Manny and I was like,

1677
01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:40.420
maybe I should go check this girl out.
I went to the locker room,

1678
01:32:40.450 --> 01:32:43.750
I wrapped her and she will,
I saw,
she was excited that I was there,
you know,

1679
01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:47.830
I wrapped her hands and I said,
hey,
keep your hands up.
You know,
and she,

1680
01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:51.460
I remember she was so squared instead of being in an ag goes and I'm like,
okay.

1681
01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:56.290
Yeah,
like yeah,
yeah.
And then I was like,
you know,

1682
01:32:56.291 --> 01:32:59.020
she's going to kick you.
Doesn't matter.
Kick,
punch,
whatever comes,

1683
01:32:59.021 --> 01:33:02.170
just keep your hands up high and let's just step forward right away,
you know,

1684
01:33:02.171 --> 01:33:05.470
break the distance and get inside a clinch and do what you're best at.

1685
01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:10.870
And right when I told her that her focus,
the way she looked at me and you know,

1686
01:33:10.871 --> 01:33:13.450
I knew that she was a fighter,
but I was like,
let me let her,
let her,

1687
01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:17.370
let her get in there first.
You know what I mean?
It was till I see this girl.
Yes,

1688
01:33:17.380 --> 01:33:19.180
I could see it.
Speed,
power,

1689
01:33:19.181 --> 01:33:24.100
explosiveness without even having that top level of training.

1690
01:33:25.390 --> 01:33:28.160
The way she did it and I knew she was a real athlete,
real fighter shawls.

1691
01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:31.390
I was coming back down.
I text the manager,
I was like,

1692
01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:34.630
give me the name and last name of this girl,
spell it out for me.

1693
01:33:34.631 --> 01:33:36.010
Because I didn't,
I didn't.
But yeah,
besides that,

1694
01:33:36.011 --> 01:33:40.880
I didn't even speak English well,
so how could I write it like that?

1695
01:33:40.930 --> 01:33:45.220
But they're so he,
he texted it to me.
I didn't look that day.

1696
01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:50.110
Next Day was like maybe 3:00 PM I went online and I pressed her name that it

1697
01:33:50.111 --> 01:33:53.920
came amateur debut around the Rousey and it had already like 100,000 views.

1698
01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:56.530
I was like,
what the hell just happened,
you know,
we just fought,

1699
01:33:56.531 --> 01:33:59.470
how is that possible?
A hundred thousand years.
And I was like,
okay,

1700
01:33:59.471 --> 01:34:03.190
this girl has a falling.
Then I started looking at her judo fights,

1701
01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:06.460
all their matches.
And it was interesting.

1702
01:34:06.461 --> 01:34:08.680
I knew that she was a real fighter because of her attitude,

1703
01:34:09.130 --> 01:34:11.350
her approach to fighting.
And you know,

1704
01:34:11.351 --> 01:34:13.690
I don't understand judo at that point and especially that end,

1705
01:34:13.691 --> 01:34:16.090
understand much about it.
But you know,
I have a vision.

1706
01:34:16.091 --> 01:34:21.091
I've done all kinds of martial arts growing up and I knew what's a technical

1707
01:34:21.641 --> 01:34:25.090
fighter only?
What's a fighter that has the attitude to fight?

1708
01:34:25.091 --> 01:34:27.460
What's a fighter that's born to fight?
You know,

1709
01:34:27.461 --> 01:34:30.730
so she had all the pluses,

1710
01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:34.810
but I knew that it could be way better done.
Why?

1711
01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:37.780
Because right away I knew that,
hey,
USA judo,
you know,

1712
01:34:37.781 --> 01:34:41.590
it's amazing when Anna Marie did with Ronda Rousey is phenomenal.

1713
01:34:41.710 --> 01:34:44.260
What being in this country would,
you know,

1714
01:34:44.261 --> 01:34:49.240
judo not being such a strong sport and United States and all the gyms she took

1715
01:34:49.241 --> 01:34:52.810
her to and all that guidance major into something special.

1716
01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:57.970
It's an amazing job then.
But I said it could be done,
you know,
boxing and it's in

1717
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.440
<v 6>in u s boxing.
Xiu Jen.
I said,</v>

1718
01:35:00.441 --> 01:35:04.430
if we train what that concept and keep her judo,

1719
01:35:05.090 --> 01:35:08.270
there's girls who are going to be unreal.
Just started working with her.

1720
01:35:08.570 --> 01:35:12.130
It was amazing.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Then we bumped heads.
Yeah.
You want to say

1721
01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:18.960
<v 0>she?
She said she just started working with her.
No,
I didn't.</v>

1722
01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:22.250
No.
Three amateur fights.

1723
01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:24.650
I remember going home.

1724
01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:28.830
<v 6>I remember going home to,
to,
to my acts,
he was my boyfriend at the time and just</v>

1725
01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:33.940
<v 0>bitching about how Edmund would not spend any time on me at all.</v>

1726
01:35:34.131 --> 01:35:37.810
Even though even though,
yeah,
we already had a blow and he was,
he was spending

1727
01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:43.610
every night,
oh go home every night.
And I'd be like,
he's still,
you know,

1728
01:35:43.611 --> 01:35:47.030
I'm there and Asca and he's just like,
you know,
I don't know.

1729
01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:51.030
He's playing hard to get or like playing hard to get and he's like,
Hey,

1730
01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:55.060
all essentially almost intentionally rubbing my base and he's not paying

1731
01:35:55.061 --> 01:35:57.770
attention.
Me.
And like,
oh my God,
they turned the corner.

1732
01:35:58.130 --> 01:36:03.080
<v 6>It was before my first pro fight.
He started,
um,
actually I had a rider,</v>

1733
01:36:03.090 --> 01:36:05.790
this how it happened.
She says it a bit different talking to this thing,

1734
01:36:06.050 --> 01:36:08.900
she says it a bit differently,
but this is what happened.
I was wearing,

1735
01:36:08.901 --> 01:36:10.310
I don't know what kind of shirt was I wearing,

1736
01:36:10.311 --> 01:36:12.960
but this was before the first amateur fight.
We had this fight.
Yeah,
yeah.

1737
01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:14.840
You tell it.
You tell it.
Yeah.

1738
01:36:14.841 --> 01:36:18.920
I was wearing like a shirt and my fighter had another pound or two pounds to

1739
01:36:18.921 --> 01:36:20.420
drop.
He was fighting on showtime.

1740
01:36:20.450 --> 01:36:25.450
I did a boxer and he was on the elliptical just to break into a quick and she

1741
01:36:25.581 --> 01:36:29.360
came right in front of me when I got out of the locker room and I was Nah

1742
01:36:32.890 --> 01:36:37.230
<v 0>early that morning so I can go to Alberta Cranes,
uh,</v>

1743
01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:39.310
Jim and spar,
they did MMA

1744
01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:43.990
<v 6>borrowing in the morning like eight 30 to like whatever,
nine 30.</v>

1745
01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:48.220
Um,
well they are like eight 30 to 10.
They had a workout,

1746
01:36:48.250 --> 01:36:53.250
but I left early at nine 30 so that I could get to the gym in time at 10 to be

1747
01:36:53.621 --> 01:36:56.430
able to be there to,
to bug admin and to heal holding him.

1748
01:36:56.431 --> 01:36:59.080
It's for me because he wasn't,
uh,
he still hadn't at that point.

1749
01:36:59.081 --> 01:37:00.530
But everyday Howard aspect can hold this to me.

1750
01:37:00.531 --> 01:37:02.200
He's like non Betsy how I miss me and how I got this thing.

1751
01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:04.060
It's being does and every single day,

1752
01:37:04.061 --> 01:37:08.070
like the excuse got like worse and worse and worse.
And I have an excuse me.
Yeah.

1753
01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:11.860
And so that day I left sparring early so that I could be there.

1754
01:37:11.861 --> 01:37:14.700
I'm like my hands,
I'm sitting behind the desk,
I'm all like,
okay.
He's like,

1755
01:37:14.710 --> 01:37:18.220
I'm gonna like pretty much right when it gets in the door,

1756
01:37:18.221 --> 01:37:21.220
I'm gonna ask him again cause that's like my thing now.
Right.
And um,

1757
01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:23.800
he comes to the door and I'm like,
Hey man,
can you let Mr me today?
And he goes,

1758
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:25.210
I don't want to sweat in this shirt.

1759
01:37:27.490 --> 01:37:31.000
<v 0>Yeah.
Like that.
I will do.
I want,</v>

1760
01:37:31.270 --> 01:37:35.350
this is fucking bullshit.
She started like,

1761
01:37:35.370 --> 01:37:39.560
we were always got open,
no

1762
01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:44.710
letters.
It was like,
it was like he pulled the record,
I was like,
oh

1763
01:37:48.370 --> 01:37:50.620
my God,
something's going to happen.

1764
01:37:51.530 --> 01:37:53.420
<v 6>And it was just like,
I can't,</v>

1765
01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:54.320
<v 0>yeah.</v>

1766
01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:58.770
So then like I like I walk up and I'm like going to grab my stuff or whatever

1767
01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:01.560
and I'm walking back across.
He's like,
don't ever leave.
He's like,

1768
01:38:01.561 --> 01:38:04.590
don't ever swear him.
No.
Ever speak to me like that in my gym.
And I was like,

1769
01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:07.950
and I was like,
fuck it,
whatever.
And then like left,
went out the door,

1770
01:38:07.951 --> 01:38:11.100
I grabbed all my stuff,
I was ready to never go back in there again.

1771
01:38:11.130 --> 01:38:13.230
Like I was like,
well I'm not welcome back anymore.

1772
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:16.620
He never even said that I could train there.
He just didn't say,
no,

1773
01:38:16.621 --> 01:38:17.490
you have to leave.

1774
01:38:17.610 --> 01:38:22.020
So I just stayed is not a welcoming environment.

1775
01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:28.320
No.
And then pulling away,
I was like,
Oh God,

1776
01:38:28.321 --> 01:38:30.720
I left my gloves,
you know,
cause I couldn't afford anything.

1777
01:38:30.721 --> 01:38:31.740
Those are gloves that were given to me.

1778
01:38:31.741 --> 01:38:35.550
I think Roman gave me in gloves and I was like off,
you know,
like whatever,

1779
01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:39.600
you know,
find new gloves,
I'll find a gym.
I don't know how I'm afford any of it.

1780
01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:43.170
I don't even know how influenced gets home.
But somehow,
and then like,

1781
01:38:44.010 --> 01:38:47.670
then he uh,
texted me to come back.
He like,
I got a text,

1782
01:38:47.671 --> 01:38:49.920
it was like come back to the gym and I was like,

1783
01:38:49.921 --> 01:38:53.170
well at least I can get my gloves and have excuse,

1784
01:38:53.290 --> 01:38:54.690
walked back in and grab my gloves.

1785
01:38:54.691 --> 01:38:56.250
So I turned back around and go back to the gym.

1786
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:57.540
You can pick it up from here if you want.

1787
01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:00.930
And then when I said I need to talk to you,
could you drop me off at the bank?

1788
01:39:00.931 --> 01:39:03.180
I got to make some deposits.
And she said yeah,

1789
01:39:03.500 --> 01:39:07.390
she was with the Honda and I sit in the car.
I was like,
holy fuck,

1790
01:39:07.530 --> 01:39:10.390
I can't move in here.
Cause it was all messy on the receipt

1791
01:39:12.770 --> 01:39:17.630
cation in change to make rent.
Okay.
If it's that close every month,
a car wash.

1792
01:39:17.631 --> 01:39:19.350
Okay.
What it means free car wash.

1793
01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:25.770
And so like also had a dog that like,
I had a really small apartment,

1794
01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:27.360
I saw his dog Mochi,
she's awesome.

1795
01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:29.580
But like she was like crate train for the car pretty much.

1796
01:39:29.581 --> 01:39:32.460
You know like I would bring her everywhere I could but like not at the gym

1797
01:39:32.461 --> 01:39:35.700
because she wasn't allowed at the gym.
But I'm just showing your car.
Yeah.

1798
01:39:35.701 --> 01:39:37.510
If I like had to go anywhere,
you know,

1799
01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:40.380
like in the evening I wasn't gonna let her like die of heat stroke or anything.

1800
01:39:40.381 --> 01:39:42.810
If it was like the weather was fine,
she would come with me everywhere.

1801
01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:46.590
And then like I had a basket system in my car where I had like I would just

1802
01:39:46.591 --> 01:39:49.950
bring my basket of clean clothes and put it next to an empty basket and then

1803
01:39:49.951 --> 01:39:53.100
after training I would put all the other clothes and all the dirty clothes in

1804
01:39:53.101 --> 01:39:55.200
one basket.
And then when the clean clothes basket was empty,

1805
01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:58.830
I'd wash the other one and like had this rotating basket thing.

1806
01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:02.940
My dog is just obsessed with the smell of my vagina.
I don't know why.

1807
01:40:04.140 --> 01:40:08.000
I don't know why,
but she would just go through all that she owns.
She,

1808
01:40:08.010 --> 01:40:10.560
whenever she was in the back,
she had rip all of the dirty clothes out.
What?

1809
01:40:10.561 --> 01:40:13.860
I'm all over the chair,
just rub my old sweaty underwear.

1810
01:40:13.861 --> 01:40:16.410
I'd been sitting in there like just all over her face.

1811
01:40:16.411 --> 01:40:18.690
Like it was like her favorite thing in the world.
And so it's just,

1812
01:40:18.691 --> 01:40:20.710
there's just this sweaty pants,

1813
01:40:21.210 --> 01:40:24.060
underwear and bras everywhere and dog hair and all this stuff.

1814
01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:28.260
And men is like both CD clean.
You want to know why that pen is straight?

1815
01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:31.400
Because he's probably like that earlier and he already went like that and

1816
01:40:31.410 --> 01:40:33.810
straightened it out and we just didn't realize it.
Okay.

1817
01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:37.260
So he gets in my car and my car,
it looks like,
you know,

1818
01:40:37.261 --> 01:40:41.310
it is a petri just strike trying to find it like the new Kia for like leprosy or

1819
01:40:41.311 --> 01:40:41.970
something.

1820
01:40:41.970 --> 01:40:46.970
And he like levitated like hovering inside the car,

1821
01:40:47.461 --> 01:40:52.461
like a public [inaudible] possible is a really low ride.

1822
01:40:55.391 --> 01:40:55.751
You know,

1823
01:40:55.751 --> 01:41:00.751
you somehow had his feet like at a 45 degree angle but was not touching his ass

1824
01:41:01.241 --> 01:41:03.790
to my chair.
And that's how I drove him to.

1825
01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.630
And did you guys resolve it in the car?

1826
01:41:07.631 --> 01:41:10.880
And I told her that I was thinking about my fighters sweating.
Right.

1827
01:41:11.410 --> 01:41:13.120
But it wasn't a great excuse.

1828
01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:19.630
[inaudible] did is he explained why he was right.

1829
01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:26.170
It
was cutting weight and this is my way

1830
01:41:29.070 --> 01:41:30.550
<v 1>there I,
in my mind I was like,</v>

1831
01:41:30.551 --> 01:41:32.980
there will be a time that you will be in the same position.

1832
01:41:32.981 --> 01:41:35.020
I have to be next to you because I'm a like a,

1833
01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:37.390
<v 0>but you obviously felt bad about it</v>

1834
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:42.190
<v 1>or,
yeah.
So I said come back and then,
but in my mind when I was,</v>

1835
01:41:42.191 --> 01:41:45.090
when I told her to come back,
I was like,
man,
this girl is really wants to

1836
01:41:45.130 --> 01:41:48.760
<v 4>fucking do it.
And this was at a time where the UFC didn't have women's fights.</v>

1837
01:41:48.761 --> 01:41:53.380
Women's fights were an oddity at other than the Gina Carano Cyborg fight.

1838
01:41:53.381 --> 01:41:56.770
There was very little attention whatsoever given to women's fighting.

1839
01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:01.990
So for you it was like this thing that wasn't like a promising proposition.

1840
01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:06.120
<v 1>Exactly.
But I never,
never,
no,
I didn't think about that.
I like to keep it real,</v>

1841
01:42:06.150 --> 01:42:09.510
honestly.
Like she sees a lot of athletes come right now to my gym even.

1842
01:42:09.630 --> 01:42:11.150
I tried to help them,
guide them.
You know,

1843
01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:16.160
I never think about she knows about finances or will they become something

1844
01:42:16.201 --> 01:42:21.120
special.
I want to help all of them out,
you know?
But at a point in life,

1845
01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:23.700
you know,
you have to make sacrifices and understand

1846
01:42:24.210 --> 01:42:25.043
<v 4>what you're doing.</v>

1847
01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:30.270
If fascinating position to be a coach because a coach realize a hundred percent

1848
01:42:30.571 --> 01:42:32.730
on having a quality student.
If you're,

1849
01:42:32.731 --> 01:42:37.020
if you're a great coach and you are around people that don't give a fuck and

1850
01:42:37.021 --> 01:42:40.230
don't train hard and don't care,
your knowledge is like,
it's,

1851
01:42:40.231 --> 01:42:42.000
it doesn't ever get to them.

1852
01:42:42.030 --> 01:42:45.330
It doesn't ever get out there and no one could ever see what you're truly good

1853
01:42:45.331 --> 01:42:49.770
at.
And you and I had this conversation once after her fight and uh,

1854
01:42:49.771 --> 01:42:52.020
you were saying that all my years of training fighters,

1855
01:42:52.090 --> 01:42:56.520
who would have ever thought that it would be this woman that would be like the

1856
01:42:56.521 --> 01:42:57.430
greatest student

1857
01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:01.790
<v 0>man.
He couldn't stand him.
He didn't like doing it,
man.</v>

1858
01:43:02.290 --> 01:43:06.610
He likes trains,
train Manny just because like,
man,
he works so hard.

1859
01:43:06.611 --> 01:43:10.110
He's Armenian,
Mike Round fight.
I train men

1860
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:11.760
<v 1>and all those fight,
but</v>

1861
01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:13.270
<v 4>well the Mike Brown fight was wanting him,</v>

1862
01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:17.380
knocked him out with him and then all of those,
there was a huge win for him.

1863
01:43:17.410 --> 01:43:18.190
Yeah.

1864
01:43:18.190 --> 01:43:20.860
<v 0>But yeah,
other than that,
admin only had men,</v>

1865
01:43:20.890 --> 01:43:25.550
Armenian boxers and that was like his little like soap category.
How

1866
01:43:25.890 --> 01:43:30.390
<v 4>relationship work as far as like you are the striking coach then,</v>

1867
01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:32.190
but you're her overall coach.
Yes.

1868
01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:37.350
<v 1>I give the whole program and I say when we're grappling one I'm doing using her</v>

1869
01:43:38.101 --> 01:43:41.340
judo know when to use the judo,
like speed week,

1870
01:43:41.341 --> 01:43:44.490
when to bring in those sparring partners.
What kind of sparring partners,

1871
01:43:44.491 --> 01:43:48.150
how many days a week she does her strength and conditioning where sparrings you

1872
01:43:48.151 --> 01:43:50.340
know,
but she's boxing and strength and conditioning.

1873
01:43:50.341 --> 01:43:54.050
So she's learning doorways but I see Henner in your corner occasionally.

1874
01:43:55.130 --> 01:43:58.580
Edmund does like the structure of the camp.
So what we do what days,

1875
01:43:59.030 --> 01:44:02.000
but when I do like you know,
Jitsu,
judo,
wrestling,

1876
01:44:02.001 --> 01:44:05.900
you know I'm working with somebody else because like the amount of time or you

1877
01:44:05.901 --> 01:44:10.620
know how like how the intensity or what day it is.
Is that,

1878
01:44:10.630 --> 01:44:14.600
that we're working on specific,
you know,
pony or bike her too.

1879
01:44:14.601 --> 01:44:16.460
Because you're the closest to her.
Exactly.

1880
01:44:16.461 --> 01:44:20.550
I know her mentally what she needs to do to to be dominant.
No.

1881
01:44:20.590 --> 01:44:23.840
So sometimes people that don't have so much experience,

1882
01:44:23.841 --> 01:44:27.740
they will work on certain things during certain time of the training camp that

1883
01:44:27.741 --> 01:44:30.650
it's unnecessary to work on that,
you know,

1884
01:44:30.651 --> 01:44:35.330
because you could do that at times that when she's off off,
uh,

1885
01:44:35.331 --> 01:44:37.400
she doesn't have a training camp,
she doesn't have a fight.

1886
01:44:37.401 --> 01:44:42.401
So I understand that's why sometimes it was so difficult to teach her everything

1887
01:44:42.441 --> 01:44:45.080
in boxing and to progress earlier.

1888
01:44:45.081 --> 01:44:48.830
The reason was Rhonda could have done that is because we had fights in front of

1889
01:44:48.831 --> 01:44:51.080
us.
So when we have fights in front of us,

1890
01:44:51.081 --> 01:44:55.250
we specifically work on that opponent and when she needs to do,

1891
01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:59.450
I didn't show her how to throw an overhand right or anything like that until the

1892
01:44:59.810 --> 01:45:03.560
Alexis Davis fight.
She knocked her out,
you know,
I told her straight shots.

1893
01:45:03.590 --> 01:45:06.350
Those are the best for you to back them up.
Get that clinch,
you know,

1894
01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:09.440
you don't want those big overhead shots.

1895
01:45:09.441 --> 01:45:12.380
And we could stop all of those with what a Great Jab.
You know,

1896
01:45:12.381 --> 01:45:16.010
you work your way inside with a jab in boxing.
You work your way out.

1897
01:45:16.011 --> 01:45:17.480
If you don't want anybody to come inside,

1898
01:45:17.481 --> 01:45:19.760
you keep that job out there and they kicked,
they will have a hard time.

1899
01:45:19.761 --> 01:45:23.600
So it's simple concept.
A lot of footwork,
you know,
utilizing the distance.
Right.

1900
01:45:23.601 --> 01:45:28.460
And you see how she gets to clinch,
you know,
if you watch um,
Liz's fight,

1901
01:45:28.850 --> 01:45:31.580
short,
stocky girl throwing heart short shots,

1902
01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:35.240
the way she maneuvers and uses that Jab kits on that elbow,

1903
01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:38.390
it's,
it's beautiful.
For you.

1904
01:45:38.391 --> 01:45:41.540
Was it a difficult transition becoming an MMA coach?

1905
01:45:41.541 --> 01:45:45.470
Like being in a situation where was a people that don't know?
I was,
I did,

1906
01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:49.850
I have like 40 professional Muay Thai fights,
you know,
after doing,

1907
01:45:49.851 --> 01:45:53.570
we tied the shoot boxing.
I fought in Japan throws,
so I was used to all that.

1908
01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:58.370
I did taekwondo matches,
all those international,
Jimmy came all those fights.

1909
01:45:58.371 --> 01:46:01.110
So I have experienced and all kinds of martial arts.

1910
01:46:01.111 --> 01:46:04.690
But then fell in love with boxing,
you know,
polished my hands and you know,

1911
01:46:04.730 --> 01:46:08.720
trained with the best and putting it all together.
It's not,

1912
01:46:08.850 --> 01:46:12.730
it's a fight is a fight.
Right.
You've got to understand what the,

1913
01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:16.640
it's not only about the fight,
you got to understand what you have as a trainer.

1914
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:19.730
I ain't know what I have.
I know what ability she has.

1915
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:23.840
And you know,
uh,
I know around this personality,

1916
01:46:24.050 --> 01:46:27.500
I know what they're going to be trying to do.
This last fight,
she knows,
I said,

1917
01:46:27.501 --> 01:46:28.670
Rhonda,
the way you're punching,
right,

1918
01:46:28.671 --> 01:46:31.940
not everybody's going to try to push you off them or they're going to be

1919
01:46:31.941 --> 01:46:35.060
desperate for them to clinch before you would want to go clinch,

1920
01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:37.190
but now you're going to clip them so hard.
Guess what?

1921
01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:40.010
They're gonna try to come in,
clinch you.
And when they're doing that,

1922
01:46:40.011 --> 01:46:44.180
you either counter take down,
which you can do or you from,

1923
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:47.390
keep on punching them counter punch or you know,
push him off,

1924
01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:50.970
knock their ass out.
What happened?
She was punching her with that you want to do,

1925
01:46:50.971 --> 01:46:53.980
she couldn't take those shots.
She came to grab around the,
around the push.

1926
01:46:53.981 --> 01:46:56.820
They're neater.
Jumped on her again.
Fight was over.
So,

1927
01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:02.840
but that we understood as we're seeing progress because when I'm seeing the

1928
01:47:02.971 --> 01:47:06.390
spying partners,
we have a boxing world champion spying would run,

1929
01:47:06.391 --> 01:47:09.600
the run is on her hitting here and this goes like holy shit.

1930
01:47:09.601 --> 01:47:13.710
Trying to get insight to close tie her up.
It means it's a big problem.

1931
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:17.590
<v 4>So are you,
are you analyzing this stuff independently of your transactions?</v>

1932
01:47:17.620 --> 01:47:22.620
We absolutely sitting down afterwards and you're going over what that's like

1933
01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:25.560
<v 1>teach group classes.
I can't do group.</v>

1934
01:47:26.190 --> 01:47:31.190
I like to work on an individual's ability and bring out the best from the

1935
01:47:31.351 --> 01:47:32.090
fighter.

1936
01:47:32.090 --> 01:47:36.990
You got to look deep into exactly too much too much yet should I put I,

1937
01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:40.560
I,
you know,
and doing it at this level,

1938
01:47:40.561 --> 01:47:44.950
you have to have that fighter,
you have to love that fighter.

1939
01:47:44.970 --> 01:47:46.160
You have to care about that fighter.

1940
01:47:46.170 --> 01:47:50.910
You have to understand that fighter personality.
So you know,

1941
01:47:50.911 --> 01:47:55.500
that's why she puts me to under the seat,
lets me write the whole structure,

1942
01:47:55.501 --> 01:47:59.940
but I'll tell you,
she is an intelligent why?
Because there hasn't been choices.

1943
01:47:59.941 --> 01:48:02.010
She's made or said,
hey coach,
you know,

1944
01:48:02.011 --> 01:48:05.520
we should go work with Henner and hit on,
you know,

1945
01:48:05.521 --> 01:48:10.521
because just to understand their tactical approach to fighting where they're on

1946
01:48:10.531 --> 01:48:14.040
their back.
I will never write lie down on my back,
you know.

1947
01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:18.720
But getting it was like he did all the striking and I was all of the grappling

1948
01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:24.060
and then I didn't have a Jujitsu or wrestling coach for years.

1949
01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:26.570
And then I brought Martin Barbarian,

1950
01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:30.480
what's an Olympic with a three time Olympian,
bronze medalist,
you know,

1951
01:48:30.481 --> 01:48:33.750
so we added like I added once she added Henry and hit on and she was like,

1952
01:48:33.751 --> 01:48:38.640
just for a minute.
Yeah.
To understand the approach to their style.

1953
01:48:38.850 --> 01:48:40.860
And then now when we go,

1954
01:48:40.861 --> 01:48:43.950
she understands that when they're on their back and being passive,

1955
01:48:44.130 --> 01:48:46.380
she judo Kai's not going to lie down on their back.

1956
01:48:46.381 --> 01:48:49.830
Kids who don't know you lose that way.
So,
but they do their,
you know,

1957
01:48:49.831 --> 01:48:52.620
Jujutsu doesn't just for her to be aware of that.
And I said,
Rhonda,

1958
01:48:52.621 --> 01:48:56.730
you're brilliant.
Let's go to them and we'll do it once a week,
twice a week.

1959
01:48:56.731 --> 01:49:00.060
So you could understand their approach to,
you know,

1960
01:49:00.061 --> 01:49:04.050
grappling and then we'll know how to take advantage of that.

1961
01:49:04.150 --> 01:49:06.220
<v 4>Well,
it's a ever evolving game.</v>

1962
01:49:06.221 --> 01:49:10.510
Grappling unlike anything else is constantly evolving and adding new techniques

1963
01:49:10.511 --> 01:49:12.910
to it and like have you paid attention to Abu Dhabi?

1964
01:49:12.911 --> 01:49:16.660
Like the world championships?
It's all leg locks now.
It's crazy.

1965
01:49:16.661 --> 01:49:20.830
There's so the leg lock game and grappling has changed so much over the last few

1966
01:49:20.830 --> 01:49:22.900
years.
Everybody's attacking with leg locks,

1967
01:49:22.901 --> 01:49:27.040
using leg locks for sweeps using establish other transitions.

1968
01:49:28.250 --> 01:49:33.170
<v 1>When you bring striking into it is it's very different because it's very risky</v>

1969
01:49:33.171 --> 01:49:36.670
in that when you go for a leg lock up doesn't work out,
you lose position.
I May,

1970
01:49:36.690 --> 01:49:41.640
yeah,
I don't think a lot more about about risk and that's why I feel like like,

1971
01:49:42.750 --> 01:49:46.460
uh,
armbars works so well is because if it doesn't work out,
I'm still,

1972
01:49:46.461 --> 01:49:48.130
I'm still on top.
I could still

1973
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:51.520
<v 6>be somewhere positive,
you know,
instead of if I go for a leg lock,</v>

1974
01:49:51.550 --> 01:49:54.550
I'm suddenly on the bottom,
you know?
That's why I don't do doubles.

1975
01:49:54.551 --> 01:49:56.260
I don't shoot it for devil's is what if it doesn't work?

1976
01:49:56.980 --> 01:50:00.730
Then you're on the bottom here in the worst year in a worst place.
It's so risky.

1977
01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:02.270
<v 4>Do you know what Eddie Commons is?</v>

1978
01:50:03.140 --> 01:50:08.140
Top Level Brazilian Jujitsu competitor right now trains other John Danaher and

1979
01:50:09.141 --> 01:50:14.141
John Danaher apparently has a very complex and comprehensive system involving

1980
01:50:14.661 --> 01:50:18.230
attacking legs and leg locks.
He's one of Hanzo Gracie's black belts,
really,

1981
01:50:18.231 --> 01:50:22.760
really respected Jujitsu guy.
And uh,
Eddie was talking about uh,

1982
01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:23.301
he was,

1983
01:50:23.301 --> 01:50:28.220
he just competed in Abu Dhabi and he was talking about bringing leg locks to MMA

1984
01:50:28.221 --> 01:50:32.570
and that you are seeing many more leg locks in MMA now because guys are learning

1985
01:50:32.810 --> 01:50:36.550
the like at the highest level that the transitions,

1986
01:50:36.551 --> 01:50:39.500
it's like a lot of times we have these looks at things and we go,

1987
01:50:39.501 --> 01:50:41.390
well that's not going to work because of this.

1988
01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:44.840
And people might have said that about all sorts of different aspects of MMA

1989
01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:47.570
before someone came along and figured out a way to do it successfully.

1990
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:50.360
I think we're kind of seeing that as counting like leg locks,

1991
01:50:51.690 --> 01:50:52.840
<v 6>the risky.
And then again,</v>

1992
01:50:52.841 --> 01:50:56.060
I said there is the ability of the fighter would have built you have you what

1993
01:50:56.061 --> 01:50:57.500
you've done,
like you know what I'm saying?

1994
01:50:57.501 --> 01:51:01.040
Like when she does Henry and hit on and you know,

1995
01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:03.890
during training camp she's not going to one month before to fight,

1996
01:51:03.891 --> 01:51:07.550
lie down on her back and try to do triangles.
Right.
That's not her.
Right.

1997
01:51:07.551 --> 01:51:11.630
You know what I mean?
So we need to be dominant in certain areas.
Do you train

1998
01:51:11.730 --> 01:51:12.660
<v 4>those things like,</v>

1999
01:51:12.661 --> 01:51:16.170
like do you learn like specific skills outside of a training camp?

2000
01:51:16.171 --> 01:51:18.130
So like when training camp's over,
you know,

2001
01:51:18.131 --> 01:51:22.140
you knock out Batchko hey a and you go,
ah,
I'd like to learn how to do this.

2002
01:51:22.170 --> 01:51:24.010
Or I'd like to add a little bit of that.
Yeah,

2003
01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:26.430
<v 6>yeah.
She's just,</v>

2004
01:51:26.470 --> 01:51:30.670
do you learn stuff for a particular direction when you're outside of camp and

2005
01:51:30.671 --> 01:51:34.680
camp is what directs it towards something specific.
But is it crazy because MMA,

2006
01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:36.190
there's so many skills,

2007
01:51:36.191 --> 01:51:39.200
there's so many things you get adhere to or so many styles you get.

2008
01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:43.390
It's like you had Kinda kinda figure out where to focus your thing and you're,

2009
01:51:43.391 --> 01:51:45.520
you're focusing your thing on boxing.

2010
01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:48.670
You're judo and your arm bar and because of that it's,

2011
01:51:48.671 --> 01:51:52.690
you've been so successful because everything is just razor sharp.

2012
01:51:52.930 --> 01:51:54.970
When you start adding things,

2013
01:51:55.330 --> 01:51:58.930
sometimes what happens is you're putting too much attention to these other

2014
01:51:58.931 --> 01:52:01.720
things you can add.
But no,
went wet.
That's the thing.

2015
01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:04.620
No one that we got Justin floors,
you know,
he comes into judo,

2016
01:52:04.630 --> 01:52:05.650
the explosive throws.

2017
01:52:05.651 --> 01:52:09.280
We know that judo is all about timing and explosive and she loves it when she

2018
01:52:09.281 --> 01:52:11.950
uses that,
knowing when to do that,
you know what I mean?

2019
01:52:11.950 --> 01:52:16.150
But if she does that right now when we're just starting off and quick explosive

2020
01:52:16.151 --> 01:52:17.770
throws,
her body's not ready.

2021
01:52:17.771 --> 01:52:19.540
Like you were saying about strength and conditioning,

2022
01:52:19.541 --> 01:52:21.880
people do that so they could prevent injuries,
right.

2023
01:52:21.881 --> 01:52:24.670
For you not to have your joints hurting this.
And that's why it's the same thing.

2024
01:52:24.671 --> 01:52:29.020
You have to think of it when to use it.
It's okay to add,
but when to use it,

2025
01:52:29.021 --> 01:52:33.340
when you're fighting,
you have to do what's best of your ability to get the w.

2026
01:52:33.341 --> 01:52:34.210
It's about the w.

2027
01:52:34.220 --> 01:52:39.220
It's not what you make the mistake of trying to memorize certain things like

2028
01:52:40.721 --> 01:52:45.100
separate things that aren't completely disjointed and not related as opposed to

2029
01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:46.310
memorizing concepts.

2030
01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:48.680
<v 3>Like when when I'm grappling,</v>

2031
01:52:49.670 --> 01:52:53.060
I probably make up 15 different moves a night that I've never done before just

2032
01:52:53.061 --> 01:52:55.190
off the top of my head because it makes sense,
right?

2033
01:52:55.500 --> 01:52:58.640
<v 1>Cause you know the concept and now that you're in an unusual position you just</v>

2034
01:52:58.641 --> 01:53:00.020
apply the concept and that concept.

2035
01:53:00.050 --> 01:53:03.380
<v 3>So I'm just applying the concepts to every kind of situation I could end up and</v>

2036
01:53:03.381 --> 01:53:07.550
I don't memorize every single individual move it,

2037
01:53:07.610 --> 01:53:08.750
it doesn't make sense.

2038
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:13.790
I'm not going to memorize a leg lock and then memorize a spinning back elbow and

2039
01:53:13.941 --> 01:53:17.930
then memorize a push kick and memorize.
You know,

2040
01:53:18.170 --> 01:53:20.970
something else is completely a superman punch like that.

2041
01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:23.390
They're completely all over the place and they have nothing to do with each

2042
01:53:23.391 --> 01:53:24.230
other and not connected.

2043
01:53:24.231 --> 01:53:27.030
Why am I spending so many hours of my day on all these different things,
right.

2044
01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:28.153
That they,

2045
01:53:28.310 --> 01:53:33.310
they're not connected to each other and so I spend a lot of my time connecting

2046
01:53:33.561 --> 01:53:38.150
things as opposed to trying to learn individual things that don't have any kind

2047
01:53:38.151 --> 01:53:38.460
of thing.

2048
01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:39.990
<v 1>Yeah.
Their ring generalship where's the ring?</v>

2049
01:53:39.991 --> 01:53:43.550
Generalship is the most important thing.
You see her on the pads.
Watch your,

2050
01:53:43.590 --> 01:53:47.160
every time I'm stepping,
she's one step ahead.
She's,
what is she doing?

2051
01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:48.750
She's controlling me.

2052
01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:52.700
She is controlling you and she's exactly are we building the framework?

2053
01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:57.540
The most important thing in boxing and fighting in general,

2054
01:53:57.930 --> 01:54:00.000
you can be in the middle of doc,

2055
01:54:00.030 --> 01:54:05.030
gone walk 10 steps and hit your back on the cage and then expect to learn a

2056
01:54:05.370 --> 01:54:08.190
superman punch and become something special.

2057
01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:10.290
You got to learn your ring generalship first.

2058
01:54:11.100 --> 01:54:14.490
There's more to fighting people just,
you know.
No,

2059
01:54:14.491 --> 01:54:17.220
I'd have an idea and there's coaches out there that think,
oh,

2060
01:54:17.221 --> 01:54:20.280
they could show a fancy jumping kick or a punch or whatever it is,

2061
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:23.510
or a throw and become something special with that.
No,
no,

2062
01:54:23.511 --> 01:54:26.610
it doesn't work that way.
Positioning is so critical and grappling,

2063
01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:29.100
but it's just as critical and striking.
It's just in critical,

2064
01:54:29.101 --> 01:54:30.450
just as critical and movement,

2065
01:54:30.630 --> 01:54:35.100
just as critical and being in a position where the person literally doesn't have

2066
01:54:35.101 --> 01:54:37.130
the leverage to hit you correctly and that,

2067
01:54:37.131 --> 01:54:39.930
so it's an art and you watch Floyd Mayweather and so one thing he does better

2068
01:54:39.931 --> 01:54:42.540
than anybody,
he's always in pajamas position exact,

2069
01:54:42.690 --> 01:54:46.890
constantly in a good position to avoid damage.
Always.
If he goes on the ring,

2070
01:54:46.891 --> 01:54:50.640
ropes calls you ans takes the impact.
He knows which round he's doing that in.

2071
01:54:50.970 --> 01:54:52.620
You know,
if he knows you're a huge puncher,

2072
01:54:52.621 --> 01:54:54.390
he won't go there the first two rounds,

2073
01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:58.380
he'll you know know exactly when he's calling you in to counter those shots.

2074
01:54:58.381 --> 01:55:01.770
You know on the ring ropes on the ropes,
he knows when to do it.

2075
01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:03.540
It's about when to do it,
how I use it.

2076
01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:07.860
When Rhonda went and clinched Misha in all the second fight around,

2077
01:55:07.950 --> 01:55:11.310
this says she was done and then Michigan mid that she was hurt from that right

2078
01:55:11.311 --> 01:55:13.970
hand.
If you watch your interview at the end,
she's like,
yeah,
I got here,
died.

2079
01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:17.220
That was a good right hand.
Right.
Well it made sense because she was so high.

2080
01:55:17.370 --> 01:55:20.970
She was so high up on your hips.
Oh I remember watching.
I was like,
why is she,

2081
01:55:20.971 --> 01:55:23.210
she's going flying Chabot.
Yeah,

2082
01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:27.630
but as soon as she was clenching you up high like that,
I was like,

2083
01:55:28.130 --> 01:55:30.870
but it's the sense when Rhonda says I clinched her,

2084
01:55:30.900 --> 01:55:34.530
she was already out right around the toss third and did an arm bar.

2085
01:55:35.010 --> 01:55:39.190
But why she did that throw there is because she knew she was out.
Right.

2086
01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:41.160
She could have finished it spending whatsoever

2087
01:55:42.010 --> 01:55:45.870
<v 3>allows the,
the beginning,
the third round and I,
she was out on her feet.</v>

2088
01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:48.690
It's a straight right.
And I knew it because of the way she was breathing.

2089
01:55:48.810 --> 01:55:50.790
When I put her up against the cage,
I felt she was,

2090
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:54.420
she was deflated and she wasn't there anymore.

2091
01:55:54.630 --> 01:55:57.780
So I knew I could do whatever kind of bullshit throw in the world.

2092
01:55:57.781 --> 01:55:58.800
Even I could be on the bottom.

2093
01:55:58.801 --> 01:56:01.260
It's still gonna be still going to work right then cause she's not there.

2094
01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:03.530
And the idea not fight the,

2095
01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:06.420
the structure of the fight that he put out is you're going to break her first

2096
01:56:06.421 --> 01:56:09.660
standing and then the submission will be easier because they're going to be so

2097
01:56:09.661 --> 01:56:10.740
focused on the submission.

2098
01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:14.490
You have to get them their mind somewhere else before you go for it and so at

2099
01:56:14.491 --> 01:56:15.680
that point I,

2100
01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:20.160
I knew that she wasn't there because of like you have to have a feel for the

2101
01:56:20.161 --> 01:56:23.820
other person and know them very well.
You get to know them so intimately.

2102
01:56:23.821 --> 01:56:25.440
You know that if they're breathing differently,

2103
01:56:25.441 --> 01:56:27.990
you know where their mind is at and that's the time I can,

2104
01:56:28.230 --> 01:56:31.470
I can do the shitty assuming guy sheet that you ever seen and be straight on the

2105
01:56:31.471 --> 01:56:33.780
bottom and know that I'm going to finish it from there because she's not

2106
01:56:33.781 --> 01:56:34.800
defensively there at all.

2107
01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:40.390
<v 2>When you,
when you're looking at your future right now,
are you,</v>

2108
01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:45.480
are you planning like when you're going to bail out of this and what your life

2109
01:56:45.491 --> 01:56:47.920
is going to be like after,
because you've,

2110
01:56:47.950 --> 01:56:52.950
you've hit this crazy peak in your life right now that it's likely never going

2111
01:56:53.471 --> 01:56:56.050
to be replicated by anyone else that comes after you.

2112
01:56:56.230 --> 01:57:00.340
You're in this weird crazy position and it can't last.
It may even,

2113
01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:03.220
you can't fight like this when you're 80 you just,
it just can't be done.

2114
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:05.680
So you're not going to be

2115
01:57:09.050 --> 01:57:12.790
doing this in my thirties no,
no,
not when you're 30 no,
not really.

2116
01:57:12.791 --> 01:57:14.100
I don't want to be fighting in my third.

2117
01:57:14.101 --> 01:57:18.540
Dana White's going to call you up on the phone and he's going to listen fucker,

2118
01:57:18.570 --> 01:57:20.270
my captain D's.

2119
01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:24.760
I mean like 31 32 stacks of thousands is going to rifle it through the phone

2120
01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:29.260
by me.
If you're actually 30 years old,

2121
01:57:29.261 --> 01:57:34.261
that's not thirties that's 30 thirty's that's thirties plural.

2122
01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:39.220
How old are you now?
28 28 are you really thinking like a couple of years,
two,

2123
01:57:39.221 --> 01:57:43.080
three years.
Like what are you thinking?
I don't know.
Like I look at it like,

2124
01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:44.180
like exactly

2125
01:57:44.180 --> 01:57:46.790
<v 3>how we were talking about how fighting,
that's how I do everything else.</v>

2126
01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:51.110
I don't look at all these separate disjointed things like I'm not going to go in

2127
01:57:51.111 --> 01:57:53.300
there and I'm not going to try this thing and then try this thing and try that

2128
01:57:53.301 --> 01:57:56.390
thing and then hope something works out.
It's like I follow like,

2129
01:57:56.660 --> 01:57:59.780
like a path train of thought while I'm in,

2130
01:58:00.050 --> 01:58:01.670
I'm in there and while I'm doing everything else.

2131
01:58:01.671 --> 01:58:05.960
So it's just like this is what I want to do right now and these are the possible

2132
01:58:05.961 --> 01:58:06.561
reactions,

2133
01:58:06.561 --> 01:58:10.130
these possible things that could happen and we're going with option three.
Okay,

2134
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:13.070
this is,
these are the possible ray and I and I follow it like,
like,

2135
01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:16.850
like a path from whatever happened from what I'm doing right now that determines

2136
01:58:16.851 --> 01:58:21.290
everything else afterward.
And I just kind of follow it.
And so it's very,

2137
01:58:21.300 --> 01:58:25.280
everything's very organically done and I'm improvising all the time.

2138
01:58:25.310 --> 01:58:28.310
I'm improvising on,
I'm fighting,
I'm free,
I'm improvising with my career.

2139
01:58:28.460 --> 01:58:32.000
I just know the concepts of what I want to accomplish in my career.

2140
01:58:32.210 --> 01:58:34.280
I don't know exactly what I'm going to be doing.

2141
01:58:34.281 --> 01:58:36.860
I don't walk in and know I'm going to arm bar that person.
You know?

2142
01:58:36.861 --> 01:58:39.290
I don't right now know exactly what I'm going to win.

2143
01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:42.060
I'm going to retire and how exactly I want to do it,
but I

2144
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:45.610
<v 6>know what's going to happen at some point.
I know I'm going to be undefeated,</v>

2145
01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:49.270
I want to be undefeated.
I know and I'm going to retire at some point,

2146
01:58:49.510 --> 01:58:54.510
but still I'm still so far away that I can't say exactly how I'm still following

2147
01:58:55.660 --> 01:58:58.600
the path and the train of thought to get there.
And we know when she wins.

2148
01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:03.910
You know wood so quick.
No injuries,
training,
healthy,

2149
01:59:03.911 --> 01:59:07.690
happy,
smart,
intelligent.
Back to back wins.

2150
01:59:07.691 --> 01:59:11.380
We should get fight three fights a year,
you know,
because Wu shoes in there,

2151
01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:15.040
not over a minute for this last three fights,

2152
01:59:15.260 --> 01:59:17.700
how are you going to know when to stop and what,

2153
01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:21.610
what do you think you'll be able to just walk away?
Yeah,

2154
01:59:21.730 --> 01:59:24.310
but that's why I look at fader.
Ah,
that's what I'm doing.

2155
01:59:24.311 --> 01:59:28.450
All this other back to Dick's because what else is there for them to do?

2156
01:59:29.110 --> 01:59:33.640
So using the other stuff will be sufficient and sufficiently exciting.

2157
01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:34.300
Yeah,

2158
01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:38.020
I just want to build it up and nothing to tell but enough where it's ready for

2159
01:59:38.021 --> 01:59:41.740
me to do full time when I want to switch over,
you know,
I,

2160
01:59:43.060 --> 01:59:47.360
I got a lot going on do I?
We're lucky you almost have too much going on.
Well,

2161
01:59:47.370 --> 01:59:48.220
you know,
I was wonder,

2162
01:59:48.221 --> 01:59:52.060
you're doing movies right before your training for fights in the middle of

2163
01:59:52.061 --> 01:59:52.810
things.

2164
01:59:52.810 --> 01:59:57.810
And it's hard like doing expendables and fast and furious back to back right

2165
01:59:59.321 --> 02:00:03.960
before going into cow.
Right.
Tell him why it went to the third round with Misha.

2166
02:00:04.690 --> 02:00:09.070
Joe knows,
you know,
you know why it went to the third round.
Why not only that,

2167
02:00:09.160 --> 02:00:13.060
but I still keep us saying it is because she had the movies,
right.

2168
02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:18.240
So first time going to a big movie or career and dealing with all those big

2169
02:00:18.611 --> 02:00:22.210
actors and she kept her weight very low and she,

2170
02:00:22.211 --> 02:00:27.211
I wasn't there because I had known Etos and Vic's fight don't fight and I

2171
02:00:27.341 --> 02:00:32.020
couldn't go there to help her out during training camp when she came back around

2172
02:00:32.021 --> 02:00:33.760
the,
you know because she always,

2173
02:00:33.761 --> 02:00:37.450
I do her hand wraps and she works on the bag in her hands.

2174
02:00:37.510 --> 02:00:40.690
I don't know how to wrap my own hand.
Her hands are ready to take that impact.

2175
02:00:40.691 --> 02:00:44.560
She messed up her knuckles right away during training camp.
She was in fit,

2176
02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:47.500
you know she was healthy and it took us,
she,

2177
02:00:47.501 --> 02:00:51.100
she couldn't throw punches that fight.
You still hurt her in the third round.

2178
02:00:51.610 --> 02:00:54.650
That's why when I the the other one we thought we were going to fight and show

2179
02:00:54.660 --> 02:00:56.230
the next fed.
I said it's not healthy for her.

2180
02:00:56.770 --> 02:00:59.100
It's not going to be healthy for a mission next time she fights around that,

2181
02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:04.900
you know,
this,
this scar on my knuckle,
the,

2182
02:01:04.990 --> 02:01:08.320
I think it was like nine stitchers or something like that from the Alexis Davis

2183
02:01:08.321 --> 02:01:09.154
fight.

2184
02:01:09.580 --> 02:01:14.580
That is an injury from that mission fight because I lost my cows as while I was

2185
02:01:15.581 --> 02:01:17.740
filming.
And so,
um,

2186
02:01:19.140 --> 02:01:23.710
when I came back all the skin came off my hands right away.
Like bear,

2187
02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:26.080
like my knuckles were like gone.
While you were filming,

2188
02:01:26.081 --> 02:01:28.360
you didn't do any training at all?
No,
I trained a lot,

2189
02:01:28.361 --> 02:01:31.690
but I couldn't do any impact on my hands because I punched you high for my
hands.

2190
02:01:31.691 --> 02:01:34.810
I have the smallest hands in the UFC.
You have tiny,
fragile little hands.

2191
02:01:34.811 --> 02:01:39.350
Like even like my thumb bone like is like,
it's so small.

2192
02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:40.213
Yeah.

2193
02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:42.030
<v 3>And um,
so I,</v>

2194
02:01:42.031 --> 02:01:46.250
I can't hit unless he professionally routes my hands with gauze and tape every

2195
02:01:46.251 --> 02:01:48.710
single training session.
I can't hit any other way.

2196
02:01:48.750 --> 02:01:52.700
My hands will like explode pretty much.
And so I was training really hard.

2197
02:01:52.701 --> 02:01:55.490
I was running up mountains and I was wrestling and I was,
you know,

2198
02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:59.000
doing all these things and um,
everything that I could,

2199
02:01:59.510 --> 02:02:02.150
but I wasn't having any impact on my hands.

2200
02:02:02.151 --> 02:02:04.880
I was shadow boxing with the ways I was doing everything I could.
But yeah,

2201
02:02:04.881 --> 02:02:06.740
I couldn't land anything.

2202
02:02:06.741 --> 02:02:11.390
And so I got home and all the skin comes off my hands then,
but I'm like,
okay,

2203
02:02:11.391 --> 02:02:13.700
I have to leave for fashion for years and a few days,
so fuck it.

2204
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:18.350
I'm just gonna just gonna Punch like this.
And so it was just open wounds.

2205
02:02:18.351 --> 02:02:20.930
I was punching open wounds for five days straight until I,
like,

2206
02:02:20.990 --> 02:02:24.320
I literally had a crater like on this one hand and I'm just like,
okay,

2207
02:02:24.321 --> 02:02:27.710
well it'll heal on that fast,
furious and I'll come back,
I'll be fine because me,

2208
02:02:27.711 --> 02:02:29.440
I'm like,
you know,
I'm thinking,
Oh,

2209
02:02:29.441 --> 02:02:34.441
she just scraped whatever and then I come back and it never heals the whole

2210
02:02:35.001 --> 02:02:39.340
camp.
We just keep putting neosporin and peroxide in it and I just have like,

2211
02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:44.690
like a crater in my hand and it keeps falling off and the whole thing falls off

2212
02:02:44.691 --> 02:02:46.790
and it gets bigger every time.
Every time it falls off,

2213
02:02:46.791 --> 02:02:51.020
it's bigger and it's deeper.
And I started to see like the little,
like the fat,

2214
02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:54.080
like beads because it's like that like deep,

2215
02:02:54.290 --> 02:02:57.770
like I would look at it sideways and there would be a dent inside and then it

2216
02:02:57.771 --> 02:03:00.770
would heal and then there'd be a huge lump and then they would whatever it was

2217
02:03:00.771 --> 02:03:04.670
inside of versus I was getting a ganglion cyst on my knuckle is what it was.

2218
02:03:05.390 --> 02:03:08.600
And um,
so I finally like,

2219
02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:13.400
he healed up enough where I could fight,
you know,
like,

2220
02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:16.640
but I had to like not punch on it really at all.
What else would rip right off?

2221
02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:19.910
And I remember right before I,
if I had told the admin and I was like,

2222
02:03:19.911 --> 02:03:23.870
this knuckle on my right hand,
I'm like,
fucking,
I'm going to plant it round face.

2223
02:03:25.140 --> 02:03:27.950
And I'm like,
and that's why I ended up actually knocking out with the straight.

2224
02:03:27.951 --> 02:03:30.910
Right.
But then I had,
I couldn't get anything done about it.
Um,

2225
02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:34.070
because then I had to go straight to McMahon.
And then real quick man,

2226
02:03:34.071 --> 02:03:35.120
I did two cans back to back.

2227
02:03:35.121 --> 02:03:38.480
Now my knee is fucking up because I'm doing two camps back to back and I can't

2228
02:03:38.481 --> 02:03:39.920
take that much punishment all the time.

2229
02:03:40.130 --> 02:03:45.110
And my knuckle is like still like super fucked up and I'm like whatever.

2230
02:03:45.111 --> 02:03:48.350
And it keeps ripping off and Co and trying to heal it back and ripping off and

2231
02:03:48.351 --> 02:03:51.450
try and hit it back and ripping off and trying to heal it back.
And um,

2232
02:03:52.100 --> 02:03:55.850
so we get through the big man fight hand.
I was going to get surgery,

2233
02:03:55.851 --> 02:03:59.570
I was going to get my hand and my knee worked on.
But then Dana was like,
listen,

2234
02:03:59.571 --> 02:04:03.890
you can fight Gina in February,
in February,
in December.
And I was like,

2235
02:04:03.891 --> 02:04:07.260
well I don't want to wait until December.
I want it.

2236
02:04:07.370 --> 02:04:09.830
I'll be a better fighter in December if I fight in July.

2237
02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:13.880
I don't want to be sitting ring rust that long cause covering rusted for the

2238
02:04:13.881 --> 02:04:16.430
Meesha fight.
I didn't feel good.
So I'm like,
I want,

2239
02:04:16.490 --> 02:04:19.490
I want to stay active and that time,
so like give me a fight right away.

2240
02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:23.000
So I was like,
okay,
I'm going to fight.
Um,
Alexis Davis is just like,

2241
02:04:23.180 --> 02:04:27.530
I just wanna find someone.
So I was like,
Alexis Davis,
you said Gina.
Yeah,

2242
02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:32.060
it was going to be Gina Carano and it ended up not happening.
But um,

2243
02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:37.770
so that was a big deal.
Yeah.
So I wanted to fight in the,
so I was like,
okay,

2244
02:04:37.771 --> 02:04:39.930
can't get surgery and I can't get all these things weren't on.

2245
02:04:39.931 --> 02:04:42.030
Now I'm gonna go to this fight and they'll do it afterward.

2246
02:04:42.420 --> 02:04:45.330
And so then I went and did the Lexus fight and I remember just looking at this

2247
02:04:45.331 --> 02:04:47.700
thing and my knuckle hall,
I was like,
I feel like I could pull it out.

2248
02:04:47.730 --> 02:04:51.210
Like I feel like whatever the fuck is in there,
I could get it out.

2249
02:04:51.211 --> 02:04:54.090
And there were times I was trying to do surgery on it and like pull things out

2250
02:04:54.091 --> 02:04:55.530
and I was pulling things out of my hand.

2251
02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:58.770
But what were you pulling out of their financial beads?

2252
02:04:58.771 --> 02:05:01.560
Like little balls of things.
I don't know what they were like.

2253
02:05:01.561 --> 02:05:04.680
I felt like I was flying with pulling out like balls of fat or scar tissue and

2254
02:05:04.681 --> 02:05:09.420
stuff like out of my hand and I'm Jesus.
But I felt like,

2255
02:05:09.450 --> 02:05:11.700
like even right before the Davis fight,
I was like,

2256
02:05:11.701 --> 02:05:14.010
I feel like I could just rip it off right now and pull it out.

2257
02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:17.160
But I couldn't do it because I was about to fight and I couldn't do that to my

2258
02:05:17.161 --> 02:05:19.740
hand,
but I just,
I just want it.
I just couldn't wait to get this thing out.

2259
02:05:19.741 --> 02:05:22.770
I felt like it was in there.
I was like itchy almost.
And then,
yeah,

2260
02:05:22.771 --> 02:05:26.370
the first overran handwrite ever threw in a fight.
I throw it right on Alexis,

2261
02:05:26.371 --> 02:05:31.290
his head and the whole thing exploded like down to the bone,

2262
02:05:31.291 --> 02:05:33.000
like from the inside of my uncle all the way out.

2263
02:05:33.001 --> 02:05:36.990
They never got good footage of it because I didn't want my mom to see it cause

2264
02:05:36.991 --> 02:05:38.970
she was like all,
you know,
uh,

2265
02:05:39.180 --> 02:05:41.700
really nervous and worried for me when I'm doing MMA.

2266
02:05:42.030 --> 02:05:45.840
And so there's like this tiny bit of footage to Elliott got where I'm like

2267
02:05:45.841 --> 02:05:50.100
holding my hand away from my mother and he's like looking around the corner,

2268
02:05:50.450 --> 02:05:52.440
which then sees like you never saw it.

2269
02:05:52.441 --> 02:05:55.950
It was down to the bone all the way around my hand and the whole thing blew up.

2270
02:05:55.951 --> 02:05:58.890
We saw the rap,
the rap is covered in blood when it fine,

2271
02:05:58.891 --> 02:06:01.740
but that's how you get rid of the ganglion cyst.
You have to like burst it.

2272
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:06.870
And so it was actually gone once we did that and less soda and then as I was

2273
02:06:06.871 --> 02:06:09.840
like,
oh cool.
You know,
that's what,
that's what it was.
I thought my hand here.

2274
02:06:09.841 --> 02:06:12.600
And then I realized a couple days later I broke my phone and I was like walking

2275
02:06:12.601 --> 02:06:15.930
around like with my hand out and I ended up having to have a pin put in and like

2276
02:06:15.931 --> 02:06:18.090
all that stuff.
So like I just had fragile little hands.

2277
02:06:18.120 --> 02:06:21.360
I have a great chin but five's a little hands.
Yeah.

2278
02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:25.200
I'd rather have it that way than the other way around.
But yeah,

2279
02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:28.950
so that's,
that's my,
my knuckle chronicle.

2280
02:06:29.010 --> 02:06:33.180
And then I ripped it open before the last camp because of this stupid,

2281
02:06:33.630 --> 02:06:34.780
was it commercial now?

2282
02:06:34.810 --> 02:06:38.880
The Promo commercial and then I hurt my pinky during the Budweiser commercial.

2283
02:06:39.330 --> 02:06:42.060
I didn't hurt anything else during the,
the camp at all.

2284
02:06:42.061 --> 02:06:46.050
I got hurt doing like the two like commercials right beforehand is one of the

2285
02:06:46.051 --> 02:06:48.450
big problems that people don't think about when they watch fights.

2286
02:06:48.451 --> 02:06:49.770
If they're a casual observers,

2287
02:06:49.771 --> 02:06:54.720
the sword fighters are going into camp with [inaudible].
You know,

2288
02:06:55.120 --> 02:06:59.820
we do it,
but she punches.
It's,
it's natural.
It's normal.
I gotta get Outta here.

2289
02:06:59.910 --> 02:07:03.410
I gotta take my kid to a martial arts class.
I did.
I have a million things to do.

2290
02:07:03.411 --> 02:07:07.680
I just didn't want to know what time it was.
I was like three,
three,
10 top shit.

2291
02:07:07.681 --> 02:07:12.270
I'm so late for everything.
[inaudible] six three Oh six.

2295
02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:26.960
All right.
That's it.

2296
