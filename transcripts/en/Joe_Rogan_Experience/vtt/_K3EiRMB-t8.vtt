00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Did you have amateur fights?</v>

3
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.920
<v Speaker 1>I fought in the amateurs and dude,</v>

5
00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:11.350
<v Speaker 1>there was a time when I thought,</v>

6
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:12.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:12.251 --> 00:00:14.440
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's why I can,</v>

8
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.113
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.100
<v Speaker 1>deal with the fighters and I understand,</v>

10
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:20.290
<v Speaker 1>like dealing with the ultimate fighter,</v>

12
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.990
<v Speaker 1>there was a fucking time in a day when there was,</v>

13
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.600
<v Speaker 1>the only fucking thing I cared about was boxing.</v>

14
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 1>That's why I literally walked out of that place because I loved it so much that</v>

15
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.720
<v Speaker 1>that's all I fucking wanted to do.</v>

16
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.510
<v Speaker 1>The problem is you go out there and you start fucking,</v>

17
00:00:34.511 --> 00:00:36.700
<v Speaker 1>you know that that's what I wanted to do for a living.</v>

18
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.900
<v Speaker 1>And then the reality starts to set in and I'll never forget,</v>

19
00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:42.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've told this story before,</v>

20
00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:46.300
<v Speaker 1>but I was in the gym one day and</v>

21
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.900
<v Speaker 1>there was this dude who was a local fighter.</v>

22
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't say his name.</v>

23
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.960
<v Speaker 1>You would probably fucking know him if I said his name.</v>

24
00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:53.651
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee,</v>

25
00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:54.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.230
<v Speaker 1>cause he was famous in the Boston area,</v>

27
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.700
<v Speaker 1>like a local guy.</v>

29
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.570
<v Speaker 1>And he came in one day and he was like,</v>

30
00:01:01.571 --> 00:01:03.670
<v Speaker 1>he was in his early thirties.</v>

31
00:01:03.671 --> 00:01:05.500
<v Speaker 1>He was like 31 or 32.</v>

32
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.413
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

33
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.500
<v Speaker 1>he was fucked up.</v>

34
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

35
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.750
<v Speaker 1>he was punchy.</v>

36
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.730
<v Speaker 1>He fucking moping around,</v>

37
00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:13.990
<v Speaker 1>kind of throwing fucked.</v>

38
00:01:13.991 --> 00:01:15.610
<v Speaker 1>And I remember the day that I looked at him,</v>

39
00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:15.881
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

40
00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:16.714
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

41
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.250
<v Speaker 1>what if that happens to me?</v>

42
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.550
<v Speaker 1>And then the minute you fucking start thinking like that,</v>

43
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.721
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

44

00:01:23.261 --> 00:01:24.430
<v Speaker 1>you're not the real deal.</v>

47
00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:25.060

48
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.940
<v Speaker 1>no matter how much you think you want it or you think you do.</v>

49
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.160
<v Speaker 1>It was the day I realized that I wasn't,</v>

50
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.840
<v Speaker 1>and it was fucking like,</v>

51
00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:32.674
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

52
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.820
<v Speaker 1>So then you start going,</v>

53
00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:35.890
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck am I going to make a living doing this?</v>

54
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.070
<v Speaker 1>And me and this dude,</v>

55
00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Peter Welsh from Boston started,</v>

56
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:01:47.411 --> 00:01:48.770
<v Speaker 1>Cause the,</v>

60
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.500
<v Speaker 1>the business model wasn't,</v>

61
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.880
<v Speaker 1>if for instance,</v>

62
00:01:51.881 --> 00:01:52.720
<v Speaker 1>like martial arts,</v>

63
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.730
<v Speaker 1>if you want to take a martial arts class,</v>

137
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.133
<v Speaker 1>when you first started,</v>

138
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.490
<v Speaker 1>you started taking some body shots from a guy who knows how to throw him and uh,</v>

148
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

149
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.790
<v Speaker 1>your watch too many fucking movies.</v>

150
00:03:57.791 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>You go in there and you think you're going to spar and you get shit kicked out</v>

151
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:00.941
<v Speaker 1>of you.</v>

152
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:01.774
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>

153
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 1>I went home that night and I remember laying in bed thinking the whole night,</v>

155
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 1>fuck I got my ass whooped that slug,</v>

156
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:08.801
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

157
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

158
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.530
<v Speaker 1>and I went back to the gym the next day and that was it.</v>

159
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Then you start working with you.</v>

160
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Very few people actually want to fight.</v>

161
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.170
<v Speaker 1>They just want to kick someone's ass.</v>

162
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:17.831
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

163
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand that.</v>

164
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:20.020
<v Speaker 1>That kind of kick your ass too.</v>

165
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Like this is not going to be an even exchange.</v>

166
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.890
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not willing to go to war,</v>

167
00:04:23.891 --> 00:04:27.850
<v Speaker 1>if you're not willing to take like big shots and be in pain and push through,</v>

168
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.680
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to do this.</v>

169
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.341
<v Speaker 1>This is you.</v>

170
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:30.660
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

171
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.090
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out somewhere along the line whether or not you willing to</v>

172
00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:34.924
<v Speaker 1>take punishment,</v>

173
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.040
<v Speaker 1>whether it's totally true,</v>

174
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.040
<v Speaker 1>punished by some guys can't.</v>

175
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.890
<v Speaker 1>So that was what our,</v>

176
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 1>what our business was based on.</v>

177
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:41.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

178
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.891
<v Speaker 1>Peter,</v>

179
00:04:41.891 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

180
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.491
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

181
00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:43.324
<v Speaker 1>you could come,</v>

182
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Speaker 1>you could come into the real gym.</v>

183
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 1>We're real fighters trained and you learn how to box just like white collar box.</v>

184
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

185
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 1>So it was like you learn how to box but you didn't get your ass kicked every</v>

186
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.300
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

187
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.081
<v Speaker 1>But some guys,</v>

188
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:53.914
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

189
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 1>start trained for so long and get to the level where they want to start</v>

190
00:04:56.891 --> 00:04:57.724
<v Speaker 1>sparring.</v>

191
00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.170
<v Speaker 1>But you rarely ever have white collar guys that start sparring.</v>

192
00:05:01.171 --> 00:05:02.350
<v Speaker 1>I want to do it a fucking again,</v>

193
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.700
<v Speaker 1>cause you know,</v>

194
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.630
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

195
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 1>you get that first ass whooping and uh,</v>

196
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.851
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

197
00:05:07.851 --> 00:05:10.930
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of times what happens is it breaks and breaks out into fights,</v>

198
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

199
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.561
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

200
00:05:12.561 --> 00:05:13.394
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

201
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.190
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

202
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.760
<v Speaker 1>we had,</v>

203
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.593
<v Speaker 1>we used to,</v>

204
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>we used to bring the inner city kids into,</v>

205
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

206
00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:21.190
<v Speaker 1>we had this idea what we're going to bring in an inner city kids and you know,</v>

207
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.590
<v Speaker 1>in southeast back then it was still very segregated.</v>

208
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.830
<v Speaker 1>So we are going to bring in blacks and Hispanics and all these other kids and</v>

209
00:05:26.831 --> 00:05:28.300
<v Speaker 1>bring them together and you know,</v>

210
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.740
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do all the fuck.</v>

211
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.040
<v Speaker 1>We used to bring these kids in man and we started training them and stuff.</v>

212
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:34.840
<v Speaker 1>And then as soon as guys would start sparring,</v>

213
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

214
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:38.710
<v Speaker 1>how many fucking situations we had were guys would come back and with bats,</v>

215
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.570
<v Speaker 1>like there'd be a bad spar and deal come back with bats or they'd come back with</v>

216
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:47.260
<v Speaker 1>their brothers or some kind of just every fucking day there was.</v>

217
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.393
<v Speaker 1>So that whole,</v>

218
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

219
00:05:48.971 --> 00:05:51.190
<v Speaker 1>let's bring in the inner city kids and fucking tried to work.</v>

220
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.300
<v Speaker 1>It didn't go over well.</v>

221
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

222
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 1>That's playing that experiment and then work to us a lot of work.</v>

223
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to see</v>

224
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.970
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

225
00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:59.840
<v Speaker 2>the attitude,</v>

226
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

227
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:01.420
<v Speaker 2>that used to exist back then,</v>

228
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 2>the boxing gyms.</v>

229
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 2>And now that people are,</v>

230
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.050
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

231
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.740
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing this evolution in mixed martial arts where the beginning,</v>

232
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 2>we saw a lot of like gym wars,</v>

233
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.920
<v Speaker 2>like that would be like a really normal occurrence in gyms where guys would just</v>

234
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:19.530
<v Speaker 2>beat the fuck out of each other.</v>

235
00:06:19.531 --> 00:06:22.160
<v Speaker 2>And you hear about Fido is getting knocked out in the gym left and right and</v>

236
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:22.994
<v Speaker 2>left and right.</v>

237
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 2>But now I think people are starting to realize like,</v>

238
00:06:25.581 --> 00:06:25.701
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

239
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:25.851
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

240
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:26.001

00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:26.121

<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

243
00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.040
<v Speaker 2>There's no fucking benefit in this.</v>

244
00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:29.030
<v Speaker 2>Like what's going on here?</v>

245
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.660
<v Speaker 2>But we're gonna,</v>

246
