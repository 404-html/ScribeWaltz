00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:04.680
Hello freaks.

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.650
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by Squarespace.

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.830
Do you need a website?
If you don't need a website,

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.250
most likely you're fucking lazy and you need to get that thing that you've been

5
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:17.160
thinking about doing and go ahead and fucking do it,
man.
Just do it.

6
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.080
And if you wanted to get a website,

7
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.080
you no longer have to go to a company to get a website.

8
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:24.570
You can make your own website.
When I say you,

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.580
I mean morons like me could make their own website.
It's simple.

10
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.820
Drag and drop interface makes it so that a regular person can make a website

11
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:40.170
super easily.
Now,
this was science fiction just a few years ago,

12
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:44.490
ladies and gentlemen,
but Squarespace has brought it into the 24th century.

13
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.880
First 21st almost like it's a 24th century.

14
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.950
Imagine what website is going to be like 300 years from now.

15
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.900
It's going to be very weird.

16
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.850
It's not going to be a website's going to be a memory.

17
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:57.150
It's going to be on your brain.
By the way,
my website is built by Squarespace.

18
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.380
There you go.
Powerful.
Powerful credits.
dog.com built by Squarespace.
Yeah,

19
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.360
I know a lot of people who's shit is built by Squarespace.
It was fun.

20
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.010
I met with the Squarespace people and they were like,
we got a um,
uh,

21
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.440
what's it called?
A ticket.
What kind of ticket is it?
Support.

22
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:13.910
We've got a support ticket for Duncan Trussell.
We're like Duncan Trussell.
He's,

23
00:01:13.911 --> 00:01:17.920
he's Squarespace.
It's so cool.
It's,

24
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.070
it's a really top notch way to build your own website and you can make a website

25
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:27.390
that's totally uniquely professional and they have a bunch of different options

26
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.400
as far as how to do it.
Um,
that you also use your own images.
I mean,

27
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.250
it couldn't really be any easier and more awesome.

28
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.900
I hear zero complaints about it.

29
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.750
You can make a really good professional looking website.

30
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.840
The ones that we reviewed for the Squarespace a contest,

31
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.080
they were fucking amazing.
That one.
Storm chaser one.

32
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:49.200
I go back to visit that one all the time.
What was that website again?

33
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.070
Do you remember the name of the website?
I have it bookmarked,
but some,

34
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:58.071
some guy made this website with all images of storms like unbelievable fucking

35
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.140
high resolution,

36
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:06.141
beautiful images of storms and just looking at these hurricanes and tornadoes

37
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:10.350
and shit going,
fuck,
looking at the cloud formations,

38
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:14.790
just incredible shit and you can do this now.
I mean,
it's not hard to do.

39
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.820
Anybody can make a website like that.
You wouldn't get the images like that.

40
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:21.000
I mean that was his images.
The images were fucking intense,

41
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.910
but you could do it and you can do it pretty easily.

42
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.910
And they also have a new logo creator where you can create and clean a clean,

43
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:32.650
simple logo design for yourself in minutes.
Squarespace.

44
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.860
Squarespace is trying to get you to open home to your own business.

45
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.933
That's what trying to do.

46
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.630
They're trying to get you to fucking release yourself from the shackles of

47
00:02:39.631 --> 00:02:43.260
employment.
I mean it's the 24th century.
It's time.
Yeah,
you can,

48
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.160
if you have an idea,
if you can sell something,
I wasn't 100 website last night.

49
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:50.790
A guy was making homemade Mongolian Bose.
Okay.

50
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.300
I guarantee you that guy is more happy than someone in a fucking cubicle.

51
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.070
This guy was building bows.

52
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.400
It was beautiful and you know the guy looks so fucking happy.

53
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:07.600
He was like discussing all the different aspects of the bow and how the bone is

54
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:12.040
created and he even put like a measurement on it to see like how much pull it

55
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:15.880
has at various inches.
He was like at 22 inches,

56
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:19.660
35 pounds.
Click,
click 24 inches.
I mean,

57
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:24.310
he's like reading off the technical specifications of these fucking Mongolian

58
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:27.130
bows.
That guy doesn't want to be in a cubicle.

59
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:31.090
He wants to be using Squarespace to make himself a fucking Mongolian Boh
website,

60
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.290
right?
Just sell Mongolian bows all day.
Just get high as Giraffe,

61
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:37.300
pussy on the planet Pluto.

62
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.400
It's still a planet in my world and make a fucking Mongolian Boh website.

63
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:45.130

67
00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.620
Figuring out you can do this.

68
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.310
You don't want to work for somebody man ass Red Van.
It's not fun.

69
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.320
Don't work for people.

Anyway,

70
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.460

That's O.
N.
N.
I.
T.

71
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.610
I need to get Greg Fitzsimmons on it.
Need to get you some.

72
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.570
Would you be interested in a howler monkey kettle bell?
Oh Shit.

73
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.430
Do you work out with us?
We work out with kettlebells.

74
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.630
I know I've always wanted to cause I know that a Brody Stevens does it.

75
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.410
Ryan Callan is works at my gym.
I see him throwing them around.
Yeah he does.

76
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:32.290
Brody Stevens when we work together in Phoenix,
hasn't been its trunk,

77
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.860
kettle bells around in his trucks and we're in the parking lot and he's like,

78
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.860
I like to do cleans before I preform,

79
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.900
knock the rust off and he's doing fucking power cleans in the parking lot with a

80
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:48.901
35 pound Kettlebell and the crowds file and HSE shadow and they see the feature

81
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.630
act,
if I can beat this is back when people didn't even know who Brody was.

82
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.490
This is a long time ago.
Brody used to carry kettle bells around in his trunk.

83
00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.500
I was like,
this is like,
what year was this bright?

84
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.950
It's like 2006 or five maybe even seven years ago,
eight years ago.

85
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.940
It's a long time ago when we were at the Tempe Improv before it closed down and

86
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:08.410
reopened again.
Didn't even close down.

87
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.650
They reopened it up and read it and like remodeled it and everything's really

88
00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:14.770
nice now.
It's one of the greatest clubs of all time.
They fucked up though,
man.

89
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.210
They close that little room,

90
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.770
that little room that a Todd glass used to was the best room.
Yeah,

91
00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:22.210
that was the best room.
I got jealous.

92
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.750
I was doing the 450 room and Todd was doing the other one right next to it and I

93
00:05:25.751 --> 00:05:28.930
went to his show in between.
I was like,
that's the perfect room.

94
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.260
This is the perfect little comedy room.
Like just like the ice house,

95
00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:33.320
the little room with the ISOS.

96
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.570
It's fucking incredible that there's Brody probably work at the kettle bells.

97
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.910
He's fucking legit too.
That's a hard thing to do.
The overhead press like that.

98
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.230
Brody's in real good shape man.
Like he's a silly guy,
but he uh,

99
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.190
he's got good form too.
That's his hump.
Gratitude.

100
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.410
Tempe is he but he fell through baseball.
Yes.
Yes.
And he talks about it on stage.

101
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.730
They didn't know how to take him.
He just broke his foot.
Oh,
getting offstage.

102
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.310
He like,

103
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.030
<v 1>like landed on it wrong or whatever.
Oh,
I know.
Rack.</v>

104
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.870
Did you see a shell on comedy central?
I haven't seen it.
Fucking twisted isn't,

105
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.370
well,
it's produce production of Brody.
Well that's kind of not,

106
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:13.370
it's a follow round documentary,
but then it's got,

107
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.010
it's got little stunts built into it.

108
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.700
Is that Gal Finac is producing with my buddy.
You know Mike Gibbons,

109
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:22.820
my sidekick on my radio show.
They did it together.

110
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.460
<v 0>Zach loves us too.
Yeah,
he loves him like we do.
He loves him like I do.</v>

111
00:06:26.461 --> 00:06:29.430
He sent me a letter when,
when Brody wasn't doing so well,

112
00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.020
he sent me a thank you email.
Zach Galifianakis is cool as fuck.
He's a real deal.

113
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.710
It was a such a legit letter that I feel bad talking about it on the air,

114
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.330
but it was so earnestly kind about that guy about Brody.

115
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.920
How awesome is Brody's just to fucking jam.
I'd love that guy.

116
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.030
Every time I see him it's like I got hit with a drug of happiness.
Like,
Hey,

117
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.600
what's up buddy?
You know you get that.
You're pumped up to see him.

118
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.080
I'm so happy and he's doing well.
Yeah,
so happy the world could see him.

119
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.590
He got to see him live though,
folks.
You got to see him live.

120
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.560
You have to see Brody live.
His show's great.
Him Live is insane.

121
00:07:04.561 --> 00:07:08.240
Him in the main room.
Kinison spot like the last spot of the night,
man.

122
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.100
He did when we were doing the man show with Stan hope and I,

123
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.540
he did the monologue and we,
we would go out and watch him perform every night.

124
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.360
I think you don't usually don't watch the warmup guy.
Right?

125
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.530
You're thinking about your sets,
you thinking about the,
the,

126
00:07:23.531 --> 00:07:24.630
the bits that you're going to do.

127
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.560
But we want to go out there and see Brody cause he's just so Brody.

128
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.240
You so ridiculous.
He's so awesome.
Didn't we put them in a sketch at one point?

129
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.460
I believe so too.
We did a lot of fun shit on that show.

130
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.170
<v 1>I just found I was,
hasn't put mine now we were putting in a,</v>

131
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.630
I had to put a bunch of shit on an old hard drive and I came across some

132
00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:49.560
sketches that we did on it.
And what am I forgot about?
This was called uh,

133
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:50.993
uh,

134
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:56.540
uh ill suitors and it was for a dating service for when you didn't want a long

135
00:07:56.541 --> 00:07:59.160
term relationship,
you're afraid of intimacy.

136
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:02.130
So it pairs up with women that had terminal illnesses.

137
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.090
So when you go to the website and you could pick a disease based on how long you

138
00:08:06.091 --> 00:08:07.120
wanted to date a woman.
Yeah,

139
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.590
<v 0>I remember that.
We should probably just not even play commercials anymore.</v>

140
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.920
Just keep talking.
Forget about the ana.com use the code word.

141
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.730
<v 1>I want to talk about this.
You know,
because it's so,
so the sketch was like,</v>

142
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.610
it was Stan hope and like he's at,
he's at the,

143
00:08:23.611 --> 00:08:27.140
at a bedside of a woman in the ICU and he's like holding her hand and she's

144
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.850
dying and he's like sad.
And then as soon as she goes,
it goes flat line.

145
00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.190
He just turned and he goes,

146
00:08:32.191 --> 00:08:36.570
he's got his phone and just starts clicking back to pack to get ill suited to

147
00:08:36.571 --> 00:08:38.040
get another date for the weekend.

148
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.540
<v 0>I remember that.
Who came up with a sketch about people,</v>

149
00:08:42.541 --> 00:08:46.200
men who were scared to wear hip bags and fanny packs.

150
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:50.310
So they have a decap attack.
It's a fucking head.

151
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.690
I think that those same sounds totally like full sane.
Right.

152
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.650
Then it using that as a,
as a bag,
is that it was it,

153
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:04.220
was it his biggest posts saying,
yeah,
it sounds good.
Fucking staff,
man.

154
00:09:04.221 --> 00:09:07.350
It was a fun fucking look.
We just got hoodwinked.

155
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.830
You know how many people have said to me after that show,
like,

156
00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:15.450
why did that show sock?
And I freely say that it wasn't what we wanted it to be,

157
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.690
but will,
they never should have been the man show.

158
00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:20.610
It's never been Joe and Doug's Shell.
Well,

159
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:24.540
it to then the man show we still would have had troubles.

160
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.010
I learned a lot about like how shows are made doing that.

161
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:33.840
Like you can't just cooperate with a lot of people that have ridiculous ideas

162
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:37.020
and when you get involved with the show and you have an idea of what you want it

163
00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:40.590
to be,
and then you run into people that have a fucking perpendicular idea just

164
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:44.510
crashing into you,
you've got to go,
okay,
we can,

165
00:09:44.511 --> 00:09:46.650
we shouldn't be doing this together.
Right.
We shouldn't be doing,

166
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.500
you gotta be ready to walk away.
Yeah.
Well you can't walk away though.

167
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:51.960
That's the problem.
When you get in,
you locked into a show,

168
00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:55.430
you're locked into a show,
but you're,
you're fighting with producers in the know.

169
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.650
I remember someone crying because we wanted to have Joey Dee has come out naked

170
00:09:59.651 --> 00:10:01.860
and introduce us.
She was crying,

171
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.660
she was clenching her fists and crying at me going,
how is that funny?

172
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.150
And I'm like,
how do you think it's not funny?

173
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.330
How could you think back the first of all,

174
00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:17.170
you don't think Joey Diaz knows how to be funny.
He's one of the funniest guys.

175
00:10:17.171 --> 00:10:20.550
It's ever walked the face of the planet and he thinks it's going to be
hilarious.

176
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.810
Yeah.
And I think it's going to be hilarious.
And you're fucking crying.

177
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:28.740
And it's a statement about the show at defines what the show is that don't give

178
00:10:28.741 --> 00:10:32.630
a fuck.
Exactly.
Yeah.
And which is kind of what the dailies it with the,

179
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.730
with the man show was supposed to be in a way,
but I dunno,

180
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.210
I did with so much baggage with people thinking they're going to reboot a show

181
00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:43.100
that's been on for years that the hosts are,
you know,

182
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.430
very individual guys.

183
00:10:44.431 --> 00:10:47.770
You guys are individual dot guys and it just didn't make sense like terrible

184
00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.590
Todd.
It was a terrible idea.

185
00:10:49.591 --> 00:10:53.100
Also because they didn't get along with the producers when they left,

186
00:10:53.101 --> 00:10:57.750
which was not really explained to me when I was going through the whole process.

187
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.250
I should have probably chased them down and ask them what they felt about it.

188
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.150
But at the time I think I just wanted to do it so bad and do it with Stan hope

189
00:11:06.151 --> 00:11:09.240
that I didn't just chase it down.
Right.
And then I felt bad about a guy.

190
00:11:09.241 --> 00:11:12.750
I had a conversation with Kim on when I came onto a show and I even apologized.

191
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.810
It was like,
we shouldn't done it.
We should've done a show.
Right.

192
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.650
But these guys had a franchise and they thought the best way to maximize his

193
00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:21.270
franchise just carry on with new host,

194
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:23.880
sort of like a lot of people don't realize the daily show did.

195
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.290
The daily show wasn't always John Stewart and it was such a different show.

196
00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:29.160
Totally different show.

197
00:11:29.161 --> 00:11:33.840
It was way more like tongue and cheek and snarky and that was a straight up

198
00:11:33.841 --> 00:11:37.380
parody of the news and it was really just him throwing to pieces.

199
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:42.060
He did very little time at the desk.
Yeah.
It was a different experience,

200
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.020
you know.
And um,
when Jon Stewart took it over,
he just redefined,

201
00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.280
I mean that's happened a bunch of times.

202
00:11:47.281 --> 00:11:50.100
It's happened with it tonight shows it's probably gonna happen again with
Fallon.

203
00:11:50.101 --> 00:11:52.240
We'll talk soup was one of the ones that didn't,
they,

204
00:11:52.241 --> 00:11:54.100
they really did bring in a new guy

205
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.140
<v 2>and do the exact same show and it's worked.</v>

206
00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:59.710
They've gone through three or four hosts and it seems to be still McHale's that

207
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.610
the guy was doing it.
Right.
Right.
It's fucking funny man.
He's fucking funny.

208
00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:07.690
He's good.
He's good.
It's a really good hosts.
That shit.
And he,

209
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.110
he picked up a standup.
I was,
I was talking to him about this.
He's,

210
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:15.220
he was doing talk soup.
He had,
he'd come out of nowhere and he had no,

211
00:12:15.221 --> 00:12:16.350
he had never done standup,

212
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.080
so he just started going to the clubs locally and he'd go out and feature for

213
00:12:20.081 --> 00:12:24.370
guys on the road.
And then within a year and a half of starting,

214
00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:28.930
the guy was headlining fucking theaters because the show was so big.

215
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.840
Oh my God.

216
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:34.240
So what he did was smartly as he showed clips of the shell and he made it more

217
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:38.620
of like a presentation than a standup hour.
That's smart.
And I think,

218
00:12:38.621 --> 00:12:39.880
I don't know if he's still,

219
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.730
I dunno if he's crossed over more into pure stand up now,

220
00:12:42.731 --> 00:12:47.140
but he's one of those guys that's just naturally gifted performer Wa yeah,

221
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:51.070
well he's just a good dude too.
And your round him,
he gives you a good vibe.

222
00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:54.390
You look at Nice Guy,
like when he's on it's set and he's doing his monologue.

223
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:59.050
He's a nice guy.
Right.
I think that comes,
that just works,
you know?

224
00:12:59.051 --> 00:13:01.000
And when he,
when he does stand up,
you know,

225
00:13:01.001 --> 00:13:03.250
just the fact that he's got the balls to do that,

226
00:13:03.251 --> 00:13:06.940
to do theaters after doing standup for a year and a half.
I'm like,
God,

227
00:13:06.941 --> 00:13:10.110
that's crazy.
I know headline,
who's on before you do?

228
00:13:10.111 --> 00:13:12.730
They didn't know how to do comedy at all cause they do.

229
00:13:12.731 --> 00:13:16.960
You might eat fucking plates of Dick's up there.
Have you ever seen that?

230
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:22.260
This very few things that are more disturbing than watching someone who was only

231
00:13:22.541 --> 00:13:25.870
been doing comedy like a year or try to go on after like a Joey Diaz or

232
00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:28.100
something like that when you like when Joe Joey slaying it.

233
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.380
Take some like Michael Richards type dude who's used to have a TV show and

234
00:13:32.381 --> 00:13:35.440
everybody thinks of him as being funny,
which is actually kind of a handicap.

235
00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:38.980
All right.
In that position,
if you're not good,
it's a handicap.

236
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.770
If you're like a really big name firm like Seinfeld,

237
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:45.640
but you're fucking open miker that's a crazy place to be,
right?

238
00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:46.930
Because they want you to fail.

239
00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:50.830
You get money for being funny and this is what you're presenting to us.
Right?

240
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.690
But they don't accept the fact that you're learning.

241
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.940
Nobody wants to see a famous person learning shit.

242
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:58.720
I was the laugh factory this weekend and it was a,
it was a killer lineup.

243
00:13:58.721 --> 00:13:59.810
It was good fucking axe.

244
00:13:59.811 --> 00:14:03.430
And there was this kid who's on a sitcom that clearly has been doing stand up

245
00:14:03.431 --> 00:14:07.270
about as long as he's been doing a sitcom.
And he went up there all cocky,

246
00:14:07.271 --> 00:14:09.580
he spent five minutes,
give me his fucking intro.

247
00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:14.110
And he went up there and his dick was swinging back and forth like a pendulum.

248
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:19.090
If the people were sitting there like dogs just watching him.
Like,
why,

249
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.920
why would you be on this shell?

250
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.990
I've been that guy.
It's the worst feeling in the world,
man.

251
00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:29.320
There's no feeling guy.
I've eaten it before.

252
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:34.410
I've eaten it for for sure a hundred percent many times just fucking flat lines

253
00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.140
just missed it.
Right.

254
00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.740
Just the entry fucked up the approach,
girlfriend problems,

255
00:14:41.741 --> 00:14:44.500
you know,
you know,
whatever it is leading onto that show.

256
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:48.630
Well cause you go all in.
Yeah.
But,

257
00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:52.160
but I mean there's comics that go up and they're likable

258
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:55.670
<v 1>number one before.
They're funny.
So they can't bomb,</v>

259
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.690
which is the saddest thing in the world because the audience doesn't even get

260
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:03.290
that.
They're not even that funny cause they're likable first.
You're not likable

261
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.850
<v 3>if you do well.
It's just cause you're funny.</v>

262
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.580
I can't argue.
I can argue with what you're saying.

263
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.300
I always said that if I didn't know me,
I would swear I was a douchebag.

264
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.250
If I didn't know me,

265
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.670
if I just knew someone who had my characteristics and my job,

266
00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:33.240
<v 1>oh I live fucking most loathsome human in the world.
I get a whiny voice.</v>

267
00:15:33.241 --> 00:15:37.470
I'm fucking,
I think I'm better than people.
Oh you think you're smarter than me?

268
00:15:37.471 --> 00:15:39.300
I'm like,
I really don't.
I think I'm a fucking idiot,

269
00:15:39.301 --> 00:15:41.460
but I seem to have that air about me.

270
00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.810
<v 3>But it's part of what's funny though.
You'd know you're a real comic.</v>

271
00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:47.840
Like if you and I are talking and if we just happen to be on an airplane

272
00:15:47.841 --> 00:15:50.090
together and some really dark shit was going on,

273
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:55.120
we could start cracking each other up.
It doesn't mean,
we mean it mean,

274
00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.080
but you're going for the laugh.

275
00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:01.210
You're like one of the first guys to go for the fucked up laugh,

276
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:05.020
like in the personal conversation.
Like you're just sitting there hanging out,

277
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:08.050
eating lunch,
and then you just,
you'll go for that.

278
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:10.680
But you don't mean that you're a really nice guy.
You know?

279
00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:15.980
Like I don't think people who aren't either immersed in the world of standup

280
00:16:16.281 --> 00:16:19.820
comedy or know a lot of standup comics,
I don't think they appreciate that.

281
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.720
<v 1>Right.
Well,
yeah,
I think that to me it's about,
it's a gear.</v>

282
00:16:23.721 --> 00:16:26.840
You're commenting on a normal conversation.
You're,
you're,
you're,

283
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.750
you're making fun of what a racist would say it anyway.

284
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:34.180
<v 3>Yeah,
exactly.
Exactly.
You know,
and you're being racist to right.</v>

285
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:38.960
Also being racist.
It gets worse.
We are racist.
Are We?
This is what we are.
Okay.

286
00:16:38.961 --> 00:16:42.050
We are judgmental.
It's part of evolution.

287
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.840
We're constantly assessing our or environment.

288
00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.500
And sometimes we know there's shit you're not supposed to say.

289
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.370
So we say it because it's funny and it's also funny because there's some truth

290
00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:55.640
to it,
right?
And it's fucked up that there's some truth to it.
And God,

291
00:16:55.641 --> 00:17:00.020
I wish it wasn't true.
I wish stereotypes weren't true.
Right?
We should Italians,

292
00:17:00.021 --> 00:17:02.780
I wished my own relatives were an apes.

293
00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:07.370
I really wished they weren't savage,
untrustworthy apes,

294
00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.360
but they are.
That's what they have to watch.

295
00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:16.070
Fucking real housewives of New Jersey and we've got an Italian.
What do you see?

296
00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:20.420
My people,
my people are savages.
I wish that wasn't true,

297
00:17:20.421 --> 00:17:21.500
but it's fucking true.

298
00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:22.500
<v 1>Yeah,
it's hard to,</v>

299
00:17:22.501 --> 00:17:26.250
it's hard to fight against the Italian stereotype because here's the problem

300
00:17:26.251 --> 00:17:27.084
with Italians.

301
00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:31.650
There's many is that your unanswered with the fact that you're Italian so you

302
00:17:31.651 --> 00:17:34.260
won't evolve.
Like every Italian guy,

303
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:38.700
you could meet some guy from fucking the a prairie,
prairie land Midwest,

304
00:17:38.701 --> 00:17:43.701
and if he's Italian he'll go and get the pasta fuzzy because they've watched the

305
00:17:43.711 --> 00:17:48.060
godfather and they've watched sopranos and they want to sound like that because

306
00:17:48.061 --> 00:17:50.160
they want to be.
Whereas

307
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.040
<v 0>we're supposed to be all growing away from,
like you're saying,</v>

308
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.670
the barbaric versions of ourselves should be in the past,

309
00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.770
not perpetuated for generations.
I have friends that are back east friends.

310
00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.260
I love him to death and I don't mind when they put it on.
I don't mind when they,

311
00:18:04.261 --> 00:18:08.310
the Da do the Italian talk.
A little piece of me dies.
Right,
right,
right.

312
00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:13.410
<v 4>I'm Irish.
Hey,</v>

313
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.770
your mom is still making a good shit.

314
00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:20.290
<v 0>Be Some,
they'll call me Giuseppe.
That's a big one.
Hey,
just Giuseppe.</v>

315
00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.580
Very rare that that my Jewish friends call me Giuseppe if it might be already

316
00:18:24.581 --> 00:18:28.150
when he was high,
but that's,
I've never seen an Italian guy have a solo fight.

317
00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.900
It's always fucking group jumps in.
Well,

318
00:18:31.901 --> 00:18:35.860
there's a herd mentality involved and being proud of what patch of dirt you're

319
00:18:35.861 --> 00:18:39.340
on.
Right.
That doesn't lend itself to courage.
Yes,
that's not,

320
00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:40.900
that's not the right mentality.

321
00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:45.550
It's the rugged individual that takes on the group and wins.
No,
that's a

322
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.630
<v 4>so there's fucking Bob,
you believe what this guy is saying?</v>

323
00:18:47.631 --> 00:18:52.590
I was Bobby Bobby's Bobby's wearing a wire.

324
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.710
You tired time bobbies in the backseat of the patrol car.
I just waited.

325
00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.660
Testify.

326
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:03.320
What the fuck Bobby with family Ovia this fucking shit go between us.

327
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:06.860
Hey thing.
I was wondering why we call you to rat Bobby

328
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:14.750
and he was with Bobby to rat that fucking cock sucker knew he used to sit on my

329
00:19:15.061 --> 00:19:18.000
mom.
Stable leak Gaga,
Gulu shy.
Think

330
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.840
<v 0>about it.
What is,
who is the number one most famous gangsters of all time?</v>

331
00:19:21.841 --> 00:19:25.630
They're all Italian guys.
They're all braggadocious Gotti types or I've got bone

332
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:32.220
Jimmy Hoffa,
savages.
My people are criminal savages.

333
00:19:32.221 --> 00:19:35.910
Right?
Right.
They make awesome food and know how to fuck.
That's it.

334
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.600
That's his girls.
Oh my God.
And your good luck.
I mean,
girl hot Italian girl,

335
00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.680
the hottest who can make really good food and likes to fuck all the time,

336
00:19:43.681 --> 00:19:47.100
but she might beat you to death in your sleep.
Right?
And you don't mind.

337
00:19:47.101 --> 00:19:50.510
It's worth it.
That's fucking crazy.
The crate.
I love Italian.

338
00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:54.840
I grew up around dark,
dark Italian check I gave up on him last time.
Sugar.

339
00:19:54.841 --> 00:19:59.160
David took a swing at me.
Rarely.
Yeah,
back in the back of the Boston days.
Right.

340
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:04.110
That's it.
I'm good.
I'm good.
Can't date anybody like me fucking animals.

341
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.810
Well that's it too.
You're not supposed to date within your own race.

342
00:20:06.811 --> 00:20:10.350
That's proven.
I married,
well actually she's half Irish,
half Jewish,

343
00:20:10.351 --> 00:20:14.460
but you got to,
you got to get a little way from mom.
Yeah,

344
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:19.230
most likely you have to just,
but it's not just the Italians that are like that.

345
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.560
It's not just a,
and by the way,
of course,

346
00:20:21.561 --> 00:20:24.090
there's a lot of awesome shit about a tire that's,
don't get me wrong,
you know,

347
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.140
and the one quarter Irish I am,
um,

348
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.670
I don't identify with as much because I didn't grow up with the Irish side of my

349
00:20:29.671 --> 00:20:33.120
family.
Oh,
hey,
what are you doing on a Sunday night or you're around?

350
00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:38.030
I'm doing a St Patrick's Day.
Yeah.
What time is it?

351
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.530
Eight o'clock.
Okay.
I'm on.
Awesome.
Beautiful.

352
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:45.020
I'll be flying back from a Texas Jimmy Schubert's doing it.
Ah.
Chimi Schubert.

353
00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.950
Yeah,
I'm a little Irish.
I'm a one quarter Irish.
Uh,

354
00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:51.580
well the Irish were the most racist of all people because we were the fairest

355
00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:55.390
skin.
We look down on everybody.
I don't think so.
Oh fuck man.

356
00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.370
We came to America at the time of the Italians came at basically the same time.

357
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:04.100
So when you go to the Bronx or Boston,
there's so Rachel Sweet,

358
00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:07.450
they fucking hate each other and they hate everybody else because we were the

359
00:21:07.451 --> 00:21:12.370
last ones to come over.
So everybody hated us.
We were the last ones to get jobs.

360
00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:16.120
So we have some,
like the Irish were the last to the first,

361
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:21.190
the first immigrants,
English,
the Dutch Dutch paintings,
Dutch,
English,

362
00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.070
the um,
uh,
you Scandinavians.

363
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:27.490
I know so little about the immigration of different cultures in this country.

364
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.320
Always know about my own family.
Right.
It was the great depression.

365
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:32.820
My grandparents came over during the depression.
Yeah.

366
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:36.790
This is a great book about Cornelius Vanderbilt and it kind of tracks New York

367
00:21:36.791 --> 00:21:40.420
in the 18 hundreds.
And as the waves of people came over and uh,

368
00:21:40.421 --> 00:21:45.130
it's really won the Pulitzer Prize.
You called the first tycoon.

369
00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.760
My Grandmother,
the last tycoon,
my grandmother grew up in the depression.

370
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:50.740
She was kind of insane because of it.

371
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.620
And she used to like hide things all around the house.

372
00:21:53.621 --> 00:21:56.620
Like she hide money in various spots in the house.

373
00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.060
They didn't find it until after she died.
They would shit,
did you hide?
Oh,

374
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:04.310
she had thousands of dollars talk to walls.
But it's just,
but the idea,

375
00:22:04.311 --> 00:22:07.770
it was not just that she had money.
I mean she,
they were very poor.
Yeah.

376
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:12.990
But that she had money that she had squirreled away into these weird spots all

377
00:22:13.661 --> 00:22:16.060
over their house.
Right.
It was really weird.

378
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.980
And did you almost not find it before you,
well,

379
00:22:17.981 --> 00:22:22.610
I didn't have anything to do with it.
His,
his children did the,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,

380
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:26.650
my,
when my grandfather died,
I was over here and I think that's when they,
uh,

381
00:22:26.651 --> 00:22:29.260
they started searching the house.
The people that were living in New Jersey,

382
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.880
they had it,
they had some idea that she was like,
Shit went,
oh,
no,
no,

383
00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:34.810
they didn't know me.
She had this,

384
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:39.790
she had had an aneurysm and she was sick for a long time because of it.
And,

385
00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:40.690
um,
during that time,

386
00:22:40.691 --> 00:22:43.060
my grandfather took care of her and my grandfather took care of her.

387
00:22:43.061 --> 00:22:44.230
That's when I was staying with him.

388
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:48.460
And it was a very fascinating time in my life because,
um,

389
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.730
I had left Boston and I moved to New York,

390
00:22:51.731 --> 00:22:53.800
but I couldn't really afford to live in New York.

391
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.420
I didn't know I had hardly any money.

392
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.960
So I stayed with my grandfather who was living on north ninth street,

393
00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:02.470
which was a really bad neighborhood in Newark.
The next door neighbor,

394
00:23:02.471 --> 00:23:06.820
they got a battering ram broke down his fucking door because he's selling crack

395
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.530
and he had like an Audi like next door.
Like this is fucking Newark,
New Jersey.

396
00:23:11.531 --> 00:23:13.270
It's a shitty spot.
Oh Shit.

397
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:17.830
And my grandfather was taking care of my grandmother and it was just me and my

398
00:23:17.831 --> 00:23:21.520
grandfather and my grandmother.
It was like one of the lowest points in my life.

399
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.470
I had just broken up with my girlfriend.

400
00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:27.220
I had just torn my ACL and I knew that I needed surgery.

401
00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:31.060
I just moved to New York.
I was completely,
totally broke.

402
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.320
And I was,
you know,
taking this big risk,
moving to New York.

403
00:23:35.321 --> 00:23:38.290
I had signed with Sussman and I want to remember that it's trying to get my shit

404
00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:42.730
together and my grandmother like Moans,

405
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:47.600
like she's,
she's hurt so bad,
can't move.
She had an aneurysm 12 years ago,

406
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:52.070
so she's just lying in bed like ah,
the aneurysm on,

407
00:23:52.071 --> 00:23:55.940
she was in just paint a lot the time she does,
she's done from the aneurism on,

408
00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.820
they gave her 72 hours to live.
She lived for 12 years

409
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.590
and it wasn't a good 12 years.
It wasn't a good 12 years.
It's here.

410
00:24:03.591 --> 00:24:07.720
Grandfather was getting zero action.
I'd probably do whatever you want it

411
00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.050
<v 4>exactly what I was saying earlier.</v>

412
00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.250
GRANDPA's coming in,
you hot,

413
00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.630
you can hide the fucking canola eas,

414
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.990
but you're not hiding that fucking Beluga.

415
00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.830
That fucking God gauche could say,
oh,

416
00:24:40.831 --> 00:24:43.700
she got a big fucking juicy guy who she's saying

417
00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.650
that's when you know you're done when you hit the Gaga.

418
00:24:49.651 --> 00:24:52.790
Good on this broad one.

419
00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:55.530
I fucking do inside of her.
My brother,

420
00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.310
I don't know if she's moaning because of the aneurism cause I'm hitting a gun.

421
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:13.170
<v 0>Oh,
it's awful.
Awful,
awful.
Poor Lady.
Oh,
it was rough.
It was rough,
man.</v>

422
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:19.800
<v 4>Where do I get allergies?
This is laughing.
I'm crying too,
man.</v>

423
00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:29.430
<v 0>It's such a douchey thing that a tiny thing is so douchey and I'm more offended</v>

424
00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:32.410
because I know so many of those people.
If I was,

425
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.460
if I was a waspy guy and I grew up in Phoenix,

426
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.920
I wouldn't really be concentrating on these people.

427
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:42.450
But it's like being around like and knowing once you've escaped,
like,
oh,

428
00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:46.470
and then you watch real housewives of New Jersey.
Like I wasn't wrong.
I wasn't,

429
00:25:46.471 --> 00:25:51.450
I didn't miss this.
You people are fucking savages.
They are savages.

430
00:25:51.451 --> 00:25:54.090
And I grew up around,
I grew up in New York,
so I was my town,

431
00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.820
a lot of Italians and they were fucking,

432
00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:01.140
they were just mean to you.
Like this one got George Spag,

433
00:26:01.141 --> 00:26:05.640
Noli and everybody worked at GM,
the GM plant in town,
and he was just like a dis.

434
00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.620
He had big chest and his fucking,

435
00:26:07.621 --> 00:26:12.420
he grew a mustache at like 11 and he used to just beat us up for no reason.

436
00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:16.630
Well,
there's a lot of that is nurture to right.

437
00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.740
A lot of savagery within the Italian community.
Yeah,

438
00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.620
I saw a lot of violence as a kid.

439
00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:26.850
A lot of like my father and mother violence.
Right,

440
00:26:26.851 --> 00:26:28.050
right around that stuff.

441
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.020
And when you were like a really little kid and you see that kind of violence,

442
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.590
that stuff fucks with your head.
It's not good for you.

443
00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.320
It's really bad to see like hardcore,

444
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:41.970
like male on female violence or even male and male.
Like I saw my dad beat him,

445
00:26:41.971 --> 00:26:43.800
my cousin who was like,

446
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.950
<v 3>at the time,
I don't,
I can't,</v>

447
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:52.100
I was five or six and I couldn't imagine him being more than like maybe 11 I'm

448
00:26:52.831 --> 00:26:56.190
thinking 12 or 13 at the most.
13 now.

449
00:26:56.191 --> 00:27:00.720
He was my cousin and my dad beat him up in front of me.
No Shit.
Oh my God.

450
00:27:00.721 --> 00:27:05.700
It was hard to watch.
He picked him up by his hair.
I'll never forget that.

451
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:09.930
He grabbed this kid by his hair and he picked him up and threw him,

452
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:15.620
grabbed him by his hair and he was a little kid and it was over the kid

453
00:27:15.871 --> 00:27:20.760
accidentally hurting me.
Okay.
Like he was older.
He was like,
whatever.

454
00:27:20.761 --> 00:27:22.830
I said 11 something around those rungs.

455
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:27.010
I can't really remember totally because it was so traumatic,
but he was my,

456
00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:30.920
my cousin that I didn't hang out with.
I had my cousin Mikey,
and then Mike,

457
00:27:30.921 --> 00:27:32.970
you had an older brother and the older brother,

458
00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:37.980
somehow now they're hurting my hand and I was crying and so my dad came in and

459
00:27:38.851 --> 00:27:40.320
saw that he and I don't really,

460
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:43.140
I don't remember it being on purpose and I don't think it was,

461
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:47.850
but I can't remember anything other than than my dad grabbing this kid,

462
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:52.880
a little kid by the hair and picking him up and throwing him and just,

463
00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:57.060
I remember some hitting,
I don't remember exactly what happened.

464
00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.930
<v 2>Don't you dad had a reaction?</v>

465
00:27:58.931 --> 00:28:02.860
Probably because of what he'd seen growing up because it was just,
it was dark.

466
00:28:02.861 --> 00:28:06.220
We know it is is when you see a child being hurt you.

467
00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:09.790
I know if I see a child being hurt,
even it's from another kid,
I get,

468
00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:11.380
I get a little ramped up.

469
00:28:11.381 --> 00:28:15.040
But if it's your own kid and you grew up watching violence,

470
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:19.420
your dad was probably hit by his dad most likely.
So he was reacting to that.

471
00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:23.640
My Dad's dad tried to fuck my mom Wa yeah,

472
00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:28.150
he look made moves on my mom.
That's fucking ballsy.

473
00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:31.570
And my mom was like trying to fucking scramble to get away from in the kitchen.

474
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.560
He was this crazy old Irish savage savage.

475
00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.740
You couldn't be alone with him.
If you're a woman,
you alone the metal,

476
00:28:38.741 --> 00:28:42.640
give a fuck if you're married to my son.
Right,
right.
He didn't give a shit.

477
00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:45.730
What is it that he thought he could put a move on her or that he was just going

478
00:28:45.731 --> 00:28:47.830
to physically take her?
It's just trying to fuck her.
I Dunno.

479
00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:52.060
It was just trying to,
somewhere in the middle
one,
my mom was my mom.

480
00:28:52.061 --> 00:28:54.790
Like we had already had kids.
She Tell Your Dad,

481
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:56.460
<v 3>oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,</v>

482
00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.030
<v 2>yeah,
but did he do that fucking asshole?
You know?</v>

483
00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.930
I don't know.
Hey,
you know what I mean?
But it wasn't good.
Whatever it was,

484
00:29:06.931 --> 00:29:11.380
it wasn't good.
So that's like a fireman.
When you think about the Andrea,

485
00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.340
get him to fucking get on the fucking table.
She did.

486
00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:18.120
I don't think he really had an Irish accent.
He was from Ireland though.
Yeah.

487
00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:21.720
I don't remember having an Irish.
Let me leave.
I'm wrong.
It was funny.
Irish,

488
00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.500
I was so young when he died,
but he was just very territorial,
isn't it?

489
00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.190
<v 3>You know what I remember about my grandfather,
my father's side,</v>

490
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.090
this is what I remember.

491
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:33.890
I remember that we would go to his house and he would sit in a dark room.

492
00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.460
He would sit in a room like in front of the television and he would have like a

493
00:29:37.461 --> 00:29:39.440
blanket on or something like that.
Just sit in that room.

494
00:29:39.441 --> 00:29:42.010
And I remember that room being dark.
This is when he

495
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:45.940
<v 2>was old.
Old As fuck.
That's all I remember over the guy.
Cause when I came along,</v>

496
00:29:45.941 --> 00:29:47.080
you know,
by the time I was paying attention,

497
00:29:47.081 --> 00:29:49.840
but I was like five or something like that,
he was already like hitting the wall.

498
00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:50.370
Yeah.
You know,

499
00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:55.370
just probably getting hammered every night and red lined his liver and then

500
00:29:55.480 --> 00:30:00.010
tick,
tick,
tick,
tick,
boom.
You eventually dies.
Yeah.
That's how the IRS still it.

501
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:02.890
It's like the fucking,
it's like the IRA gets into your chest.

502
00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.490
I didn't know when you read line it,
I needed to know some early,
you're close,

503
00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:11.710
you're close,
you're close.
It's not good.
Alcohol is not good.
So I wonder if,

504
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:14.140
I wonder if your mom saw him sitting in that room,

505
00:30:14.141 --> 00:30:17.140
put the blanket on quiet and just walked up and fucking smacked him.

506
00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:20.120
You remember that time you put your hand on me,
asshole.
Nah,

507
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.740
my mom's like the least violent person ever.
She had,
so you know,

508
00:30:23.741 --> 00:30:26.980
that happens with those types of women.
They get involved in those type of men,

509
00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.480
but for some reason,
like they don't,

510
00:30:28.481 --> 00:30:31.690
they don't assume that people are ever going to be mean.
You know?

511
00:30:31.691 --> 00:30:34.630
And so when they get involved with someone,
that's me,
right?
It's violent.

512
00:30:34.631 --> 00:30:35.740
They're like,
where's this coming from?

513
00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:40.120
Like my mom's family is crazy as they were,
they were really nice to each other,

514
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:43.750
right?
Like my,
my grandfather was great with his kids,

515
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.750
just loved his kids and my grandmother,
they weren't great with each other,

516
00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:48.160
but they were great with everybody else.
Yeah.

517
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:52.480
There wasn't any violence growing up in my mom's house.
My Dad never hit anybody.

518
00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:56.620
My Dad,
grandfather,
brother,
my dad used to hit my cousins and my,
uh,
my brother,

519
00:30:56.621 --> 00:30:59.830
I remember one time,
uh,
my uncle,
I won't say his name,

520
00:30:59.831 --> 00:31:03.790
he walked in and he was a fucking,
he helped build the empire state building.

521
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:08.200
He was a fucking bad ass construction dude.
I used to drink like two,

522
00:31:08.201 --> 00:31:09.880
six packs of Schaefer beer every night.

523
00:31:09.881 --> 00:31:13.420
He had this boat out in Long Island and he take it out and he's just fucking

524
00:31:13.421 --> 00:31:16.930
cruise around.
And he came into the kitchen one time and,
uh,

525
00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.650
my end is all of us cousins and we're like,
you know,
probably like 11 or 12.

526
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:25.930
And he comes in and he goes,
uh,
he goes to get it,
get another beer and a,

527
00:31:25.931 --> 00:31:30.400
I'll say,
his name is Uncle Jeff.
And my brother goes,
uh,
hey,
uncle Jeff,

528
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.710
get another beer.
Huh?
And Uncle Jeff just without even looking,

529
00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.020
just fucking smacks.
Muckross ed knocks him down,

530
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:41.680
gets to beer and walks out and we laughed like fucking height.

531
00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:51.160
Those are real consequences.
Right?
Right.
You can't smack kids today.

532
00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.540
No,
it's not good.

533
00:31:52.541 --> 00:31:56.710
I don't think it's good to give a guy like my dad the ability to smack kids

534
00:31:56.730 --> 00:32:00.760
cause he just wasn't a good guy.
Right.
Didn't use it.
Right.
You know?

535
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:01.780
I mean that's,
it is,

536
00:32:01.781 --> 00:32:05.560
it's a shame that that healthy violence has gone because there is definitely a

537
00:32:05.561 --> 00:32:06.191
place for it.

538
00:32:06.191 --> 00:32:10.420
I really believe that if people knew they could get punched in the face without

539
00:32:10.421 --> 00:32:11.380
consequences,

540
00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.950
like people talk about stand your ground and carrying guns and all that shit.

541
00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:20.160
I think punching people in the face is a safer version of you won't behave badly

542
00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:24.520
if there's a chance you're going to get smacked around a little bit.
It's a,

543
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:28.030
it's definitely a deterrent.
It's a deterrent to Douche.
Baggery.

544
00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:32.290
I mean it just is.
If you,
if you think that that's on the menu,
you'll be nicer.

545
00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:36.400
Right.
But really you should just be nicer.
You know it,
she blurred.
It's like,

546
00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:39.700
it's really almost like the gun control argument.
It's like our guns.
You know,

547
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:40.010
we need

548
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.580
<v 0>to get the guns off our streets.
No,
you know what we need to do?</v>

549
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:46.550
We need to make it so people don't ever want to shoot people.
Okay?

550
00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.160
That's way more possible than getting into guns off the street.

551
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:52.580
The only way you can get the guns off the street is some totalitarian thing.

552
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.280
When you come into people's homes and you take their possessions,

553
00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:56.570
violate the constitution,

554
00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:01.130
or you can tell them that they have to give their guns away or there'll be a

555
00:33:01.131 --> 00:33:05.240
criminal.
Those are the two options.
Right,
but you do really,

556
00:33:05.241 --> 00:33:08.150
what we have to make an issue of is not the guns.

557
00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.550
There's so many of them out there.
It's too late for that.

558
00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:12.640
You're going to have people that resist.

559
00:33:12.641 --> 00:33:14.450
You're going to have people that are going to have guns no matter what.

560
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:18.350
But we got to figure out why would anybody want to just shoot people because

561
00:33:18.351 --> 00:33:21.200
there's too many douche bags and I think like,
like with drugs,

562
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:25.370
if we got rid of people's need to take drugs,
you know,

563
00:33:25.371 --> 00:33:29.120
people that are hooked on heroin or crack or whatever,

564
00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:33.650
what is it that's missing?
What trauma happened to them in childhood or what,

565
00:33:33.651 --> 00:33:33.981
you know,

566
00:33:33.981 --> 00:33:36.590
self esteem issues they having that they're getting hooked on drugs cause

567
00:33:36.591 --> 00:33:39.530
there's always going to be another type of drug that they can make and it's a

568
00:33:39.531 --> 00:33:42.530
matter of time until they come up with a gun that's a laser.

569
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:46.640
You don't need fucking gun powder for your right or something better than that.

570
00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:48.560
You know,
who knows some fucking energy weapon.

571
00:33:48.561 --> 00:33:50.030
Who knows what they're going to come up in the future.

572
00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:52.760
If you can have a cell phone app that can kill people and there's not going to

573
00:33:52.761 --> 00:33:54.350
be anybody that's going to be able to stop it,
right?

574
00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:57.410
I mean I'm actually surprised there isn't.
Is it an amazing,

575
00:33:57.411 --> 00:34:00.250
there is not an alternative to a gun at this point.
They can kill us.

576
00:34:00.251 --> 00:34:04.280
I mean he got tasers but I guess you could set those high enough to kill

577
00:34:04.281 --> 00:34:05.990
somebody if you like.

578
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:08.750
If you had like four people and they all taste someone at the same time,

579
00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:12.380
we might overdose them on Taser.
That would be hilarious.

580
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:15.730
It seems like everybody that gets hit with those things goes down too.

581
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.500
[inaudible] you don't really see too many videos that people just shaken that

582
00:34:18.501 --> 00:34:22.790
off.
No.
I feel like when they hit you with that,
I know,
I've seen it.

583
00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:25.490
I've seen it in,
they have this,
uh,
you know the cop,

584
00:34:25.491 --> 00:34:30.140
the mounted cameras inside cop cars and when they got a guy who's jacked up on

585
00:34:30.141 --> 00:34:34.160
Matthys,
PCP,
they can,
can't you?
They take it,
they get up.

586
00:34:34.161 --> 00:34:37.160
They keep fucking hitting him with it that we need to find.
Yeah.

587
00:34:37.161 --> 00:34:38.900
I saw the new commentary on videos.

588
00:34:38.901 --> 00:34:42.470
That dude's getting tased and saw this fat black lady and they could not take

589
00:34:42.471 --> 00:34:45.560
this Willdabeast out.
She kept coming.
Well,
you know,

590
00:34:45.561 --> 00:34:47.420
that was the run you king argument.

591
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:50.720
Like if you watch the Rodney king fight when they're beating the shit out of
him.

592
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.830
I shouldn't say the Rodney king fight.
I should,
you know,
it wasn't a fight.

593
00:34:54.831 --> 00:34:56.900
They'd beat the fuck out of this guy with clubs.
Right,

594
00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:59.720
but when you're watching it on television like you're going,

595
00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:02.730
what would you do if you're a competent?
That guy kept trying to get up.
No.

596
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:03.351
Terrifying.

597
00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:08.060
That would be if you're some scrawny ass fucking white cop was shit genetics and

598
00:35:08.061 --> 00:35:11.390
Rodney motherfucking king is high as a kite on whatever.

599
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:15.230
What was he high on it?
Probably PCP.
Yeah.

600
00:35:15.231 --> 00:35:19.690
Look at this fat white guy with dumpy legs and this and this black guy.

601
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:20.563
<v 5>There's punches.</v>

602
00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.490
<v 0>I like that he takes the shirt off and he's got another shirt</v>

603
00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.810
<v 5>struck hooker for what's he doing?
He's taking his clothes off</v>

604
00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.130
<v 0>his ass.
Crack hanging out.
Yeah.
What do you do</v>

605
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.990
<v 2>if you're this guy and you got to deal with this?</v>

606
00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:43.740
This is a guy who is way bigger than you and you have these two fucking goofy

607
00:35:43.741 --> 00:35:45.810
cops.
Look,
I'll fat.
This cop is in front of us.

608
00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:49.680
Look how fat that guy is there on the yellow line of a road.

609
00:35:49.681 --> 00:35:52.740
So everybody's watching.
That's the worst part is a cop.
But hold on a second.

610
00:35:52.741 --> 00:35:57.090
Look at the size of that cop.
That cop is more bewdley obese.

611
00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:00.180
I mean,
I'm not saying there's anything wrong with being a big fat person.

612
00:36:00.181 --> 00:36:02.670
If you enjoy it,
you know,
do whatever you want to do.

613
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.790
But if you're going to be a fucking police officer,

614
00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:09.510
that guy can't go for five seconds.
Look at the size of him.

615
00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:11.220
Look at the girth on that guy.

616
00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:15.840
You should be given a suspension until you can get down to wait.
Fuck Ya.

617
00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:20.230
That if that guy is a cop,
I mean,
he's pointing a gun.
Okay.
They just,

618
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:24.203
<v 6>okay.</v>

619
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:28.640
<v 2>Quick fighting.
He loves it.
He's actually enjoying it.</v>

620
00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:29.893
<v 6>Oh,</v>

621
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:37.520
<v 2>get on your back.
He's on his back robbing again.
Probably.</v>

622
00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:42.810
It sounds like the deer hunting
and

623
00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:46.810
<v 0>cops surrounding that dude.
Yeah,
they couldn't keep them down.
One guy that's,</v>

624
00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.580
that's so preposterous.
That guy's a law enforcement officer.

625
00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:53.630
But what do you think about women?
What about women being cops?
Women can fight.

626
00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:55.790
Women who know martial arts can protect themselves,

627
00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:58.370
then they can at least defensively themselves.

628
00:36:58.371 --> 00:37:00.470
But what about bringing a guy like that down?

629
00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:03.140
It's not going to happen without weapons.
All right?

630
00:37:03.141 --> 00:37:04.580
Unless there's a threat of violence.
I mean,

631
00:37:04.581 --> 00:37:06.950
unless the guy's going to listen to you because you got a gun pointed at him,

632
00:37:06.951 --> 00:37:09.950
he's not going to do it right.
There's just too many crazy people like that.

633
00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:14.090
I mean,
I guess this upsides to female cops in terms of how they relate to the

634
00:37:14.091 --> 00:37:16.610
community.
But it is,

635
00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.720
it is interesting to think about if she was out alone dealing with a dude like

636
00:37:20.721 --> 00:37:22.400
that,
it's just,

637
00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.980
it forces her to be in a position where she has to shoot somebody.
Well,

638
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.960
it happens,
there was a video of a guy who got indicted for,
uh,

639
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:34.400
assaulting a police officer and it was fucking horrifying to watch because it

640
00:37:34.401 --> 00:37:38.870
was a woman and she pulls this guy over for something,
speeding what have you.

641
00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:43.430
And,
um,
she's in,
she's in front of the camera,
you know,

642
00:37:43.431 --> 00:37:47.870
just got the camera in the car and it's all on film of She's talking to the guy

643
00:37:47.871 --> 00:37:51.680
and telling him to like put his hands behind his back and the guy just whales

644
00:37:51.681 --> 00:37:54.010
are in the face,
drops it to the ground,

645
00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:57.440
she's out cold and he's just punching the shit out of her while she's out cold.

646
00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:02.330
It's so hard to watch because this woman,
she just was,
uh,
you know,

647
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:06.170
I don't,
I don't know how much martial arts training she had.
I don't know.

648
00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:07.820
You know what she knew about fighting,

649
00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:12.530
but she was clearly wrong about assessing the danger level of dealing with the

650
00:38:12.531 --> 00:38:16.340
sky.
Right.
And she got so close to him that he decided to just uncork on her.

651
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:18.800
Right.
So you hear a kid screaming,
Daddy,
stop hitting her.

652
00:38:18.801 --> 00:38:22.460
Daddy stopped in there because the guy who was getting pulled over had his kid

653
00:38:22.461 --> 00:38:26.150
in the car.
So it's kids screaming while he's beating the fuck out of this cop.

654
00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.620
And it was like watching someone get punched while they're unconscious is one of

655
00:38:30.621 --> 00:38:34.760
the creepiest things in the world.
It certainly is.
I've seen in a lot of times,

656
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:38.030
I've seen it many times I've seen it.
Um,
let's see.

657
00:38:38.031 --> 00:38:41.770
In your real life in street fights,
which is really scary and I've seen it in,

658
00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:45.340
I don't know how many UFC fights.
Yeah.
And that's the thing with the refs.

659
00:38:45.341 --> 00:38:48.610
They are really amazing about getting in there.
The second the person is that,

660
00:38:48.611 --> 00:38:52.570
cause the fighter doesn't really know they're seeing red and the fighter will

661
00:38:52.571 --> 00:38:56.260
almost always protest it after it stopped.
Right.
I was fine.
You know,

662
00:38:56.261 --> 00:38:59.260
they'll say I was fine because you,
you are fine like a second later.
Right.

663
00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:02.740
You know,
but right.
Then when the eyes rolled back and start your head,
it's over.

664
00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:06.640
It's really over.
Like if you get hit several more times,

665
00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:10.000
he just compounding damage,
your body might be moving.
All right.

666
00:39:10.001 --> 00:39:13.930
But you've basically,
the game is over.
Like you got your lights shut off,

667
00:39:13.931 --> 00:39:18.580
you can't get your lights shut off and then and then come back in a safe way.

668
00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:21.790
But you may have a concussion at that point.
Most lucky you have a concussion,

669
00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:25.180
but the thing is guys who fought with concussions and one that's it's crazy,

670
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:28.360
guys have gotten concussions in the first round and don't remember the fight.

671
00:39:28.361 --> 00:39:30.490
And then after the fight,
you know,
I'm talking to them,

672
00:39:30.491 --> 00:39:33.670
I'm interviewing them and they don't remember what the fight and they won.

673
00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:36.280
Well then sometimes if it's really bad,

674
00:39:36.281 --> 00:39:41.281
there's even a period where you feel really fine and a day later you you just go

675
00:39:42.251 --> 00:39:45.850
down and die.
Oh yeah.
Well then that can definitely happen.

676
00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.790
Anytime you have a serious concussion,
they want to watch you.

677
00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:52.000
They want to keep you awake,
they actually don't want you to fall asleep.

678
00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:54.100
That's one of the things they say to people when they get knocked out.

679
00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:56.740
So they tried to keep awake for a little bit.
They used to,
yeah.

680
00:39:56.741 --> 00:39:59.590
I don't know if they cheat.
They,
you know,
as a medical science advances,

681
00:39:59.591 --> 00:40:02.620
they started changing a lot of different approaches that they have to head

682
00:40:02.621 --> 00:40:07.060
trauma.
Well,
what is it your,
is it that your brain moves?
Yes,

683
00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:10.060
there's that for sure.
It's just the impact,

684
00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:13.600
the impact of something on your skull and it doesn't have to be on the skull.

685
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.700
The other thing is you can get a concussion from your chest.
Um,

686
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:19.660
you know we were talking about this,
I think it was a big John McCarthy.

687
00:40:19.661 --> 00:40:24.620
He's explaining this to me.
I might be wrong,
but we were talking about is,

688
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:25.870
I think it was big John,

689
00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:30.820
who's a like the gold standard for another may referees who's talking about like

690
00:40:30.821 --> 00:40:33.800
guys kicked concussions and they get hit in the chest.
No,
she's just,
yeah,

691
00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:37.570
cause you get hit in the chest and your brain gets jostled and you can get a

692
00:40:37.571 --> 00:40:42.310
concussion from that lack of oxygen to your brain impact.
Just the impact.

693
00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:46.900
That's why football players like the ability to run at each other with no pads.

694
00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:50.560
It's so dangerous for the brain because the impact,

695
00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.330
it doesn't have to be on the head.

696
00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:57.660
Any impact shakes the body violently and the brain is barely held in there with

697
00:40:58.931 --> 00:41:03.760
like string.
The brain is the most precious part of your fucking body,

698
00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:08.940
and it's surrounded by liquid and it's tied to the walls with fucking string.

699
00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:10.443
And it's like,

700
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:14.830
it's like the shittiest design ever for a power plant for the most complex

701
00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:18.460
neural connections that known known to Earth,
right?

702
00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:22.960
We are as complex as against we were the were the things that are creating

703
00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.360
spaceships and making satellites.

704
00:41:25.361 --> 00:41:30.361
It's the nuttiest fucking Oregon ever created and it's barely hanging in there.

705
00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.100
It's floating around in this fluid attached

706
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.500
<v 3>to this thin bone.
It's like one of the thinnest bones.
Right?</v>

707
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:42.200
But think about how big your elbow bone is.
Why isn't your skull that thick?

708
00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:45.600
Why aren't you fucking like super fattening

709
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:49.030
<v 1>everywhere and the temperature?
You think about it,</v>

710
00:41:49.031 --> 00:41:51.910
if your brain temperature goes up five degrees,

711
00:41:51.911 --> 00:41:56.650
you'll five degrees is your fucking brain dead or whatever it may six or seven

712
00:41:56.651 --> 00:41:57.484
degrees,

713
00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:00.210
<v 3>you're fucked.
If you have the fever,
you can get fucked.</v>

714
00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:04.540
If you go out in the desert,
you get fucked.
You were so fragile.
Yeah,

715
00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:06.210
unbelievably fragile.

716
00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:11.360
But it's almost like that's part of the design because we become so powerful in

717
00:42:12.121 --> 00:42:15.090
our ability to manipulate the very earth itself.
I mean,

718
00:42:15.091 --> 00:42:16.830
we're not making bird nests.

719
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:21.950
We're not making beaver dams or making nuclear weapons were making satellites.

720
00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:26.910
We're making space ships that have already passed Pluto.

721
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:31.570
<v 1>Oh,
that shit.
Deep space right now is trading about how they detected.
Um,</v>

722
00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:36.040
they may have detected a dark matter in the universe finally,
and it's read.

723
00:42:36.041 --> 00:42:37.630
I just like what the fuck is dark matter.

724
00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:42.550
Dark matter is basically an unknown entity that lives in the universe that has

725
00:42:42.551 --> 00:42:47.551
enough gravitational pull that they use it to basically solve different,

726
00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:52.390
uh,
physics issues in how,

727
00:42:52.391 --> 00:42:55.060
how there's gravity on different planets and how the,

728
00:42:55.300 --> 00:43:00.300
how interplanetary movement happens is based on dark matter that we've never

729
00:43:01.061 --> 00:43:04.900
fucking seen.
Like who figured that shit out?

730
00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:08.710
Who figured out that there is a galaxy that's a,
you know,

731
00:43:08.711 --> 00:43:12.220
a thousand light years away when we've never,
like I don't,

732
00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:16.030
here's what I understand is we talk about shit that's a thousand light years

733
00:43:16.031 --> 00:43:16.750
away.

734
00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:21.010
If it's a thousand like then we haven't seen the light from something that's a

735
00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:21.280
thousand.

736
00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:26.020
<v 3>No,
we have,
it just might not be there.
I see.
This is what it is.
If a star,</v>

737
00:43:26.021 --> 00:43:26.950
if you're looking at a star,

738
00:43:26.951 --> 00:43:30.280
what you're seeing when you look up in the night sky is what that star looked

739
00:43:30.281 --> 00:43:34.510
like millions of years ago,
millions,
maybe even billions of years ago,

740
00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:37.060
because that's how long it takes for the light from those stars,

741
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:38.980
especially in distant constellations.

742
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:42.610
That's how it takes the light of those stars to reach us.

743
00:43:42.611 --> 00:43:45.910
So when you look out into the Milky Way,
you know,
and you're looking at,
you know,

744
00:43:45.911 --> 00:43:48.520
who knows how many hundreds of billions of galaxies,

745
00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:51.550
you literally seeing them the further they are apart,

746
00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:53.710
they might be a million light years away.

747
00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:55.510
They might be a billion light years away,

748
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:58.410
but you're seeing the light that came from a million.

749
00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:02.740
<v 1>So all the theory about the universe now is not based on the present.</v>

750
00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:08.020
<v 3>Well,
it's not entirely based on the president,
but it's based on what we know.</v>

751
00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:10.840
We can see so far of the present.
Right.
You know what?

752
00:44:10.841 --> 00:44:15.490
I'm saying like they know that like when you find like a supernova or something

753
00:44:15.491 --> 00:44:17.290
like that and they try to measure these things,
you know,

754
00:44:17.291 --> 00:44:19.090
they'd have these big bursts in the sky,

755
00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:23.530
but how long did it take for the burst hit us.
It could take millions of years.

756
00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:27.550
Like it's really hard for us to wrap our head around the idea of millions of

757
00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:30.580
light years being really close because that's what it is.

758
00:44:30.581 --> 00:44:32.160
And the universe of millions of light years

759
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.730
<v 7>is really close because the universe is probably some,</v>

760
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:39.540
some untold billions and billions of light years across.

761
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:44.600
And it's probably one of untold billions and billions and billions of other

762
00:44:44.611 --> 00:44:47.820
alternative universes that exist inside of these black holes that they're

763
00:44:47.821 --> 00:44:49.800
finding in the center of all these galaxies.

764
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:53.100
Like that's one of the biggest theories that the inside a black hole is a super

765
00:44:53.101 --> 00:44:56.220
superman or inside a,
uh,
galaxies,
the supermassive black hole,

766
00:44:56.221 --> 00:45:00.240
that's one half of 1% of the mass of the galaxy.
Like they shot it down.

767
00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:04.070
<v 1>I think that's where the black matter is concentrated.
Who the fuck?</v>

768
00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:07.550
Cause it's a gravitational pull that,
that,
that that's what it is.

769
00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:10.760
And they discovered this matter was supposed to be all over the place,

770
00:45:10.761 --> 00:45:13.060
like they found constellations of dark matter.
Right.

771
00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:16.790
But I think the black holes are made up at the bottom of them of that which

772
00:45:16.791 --> 00:45:21.330
causes,
but they discovered all this because they put a new um,

773
00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:24.500
uh,
in Chile at the highest point,

774
00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:28.460
which is always where they've put the telescopes because if for whatever reason,

775
00:45:28.461 --> 00:45:32.270
the altitudes thinner the hairstyle,
you get less refraction.
Exactly.
Yeah.

776
00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.840
And so they basically look out and they started,

777
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:40.280
they started perceiving things,
not just with the telescopes,
but it's a,

778
00:45:40.281 --> 00:45:42.410
it's an audio telescope.

779
00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:47.090
So they can now make out colors because of the spectrum that they pick up.

780
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:50.630
And all of a sudden they're looking at galaxies that they'd seen before just as

781
00:45:50.631 --> 00:45:51.260
shape.

782
00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:55.160
And now they're seeing the colors so they know the gasses that are within these

783
00:45:55.161 --> 00:45:58.340
galaxies.
Oh my God.
So incredible.

784
00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:00.870
And someone figures that shit out.
Well,

785
00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:05.720
so baked and just sit together and go,
wait,
we're hearing this.

786
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:10.490
He hear that noise,
man,
that's a color in a different galaxy.

787
00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:15.880
<v 7>Did you guys watch the new cosmos last night?
Yes,
I did.
It was awesome.</v>

788
00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:19.670
It was amazing.
Oh wait,
who's hosting that?
Neil degrasse Tyson.
You're fry.

789
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:23.050
Fucking incredible.
It's so good.
It'll make your toes curl the end.

790
00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:26.890
He's got a speech at the end where he talks about when he was 17 years old,

791
00:46:26.891 --> 00:46:30.760
Carl Sagan picking him up and taking him to his office and showing them around

792
00:46:30.761 --> 00:46:33.580
and talking to them about being an astronomer and then signed a book for him to

793
00:46:33.581 --> 00:46:36.120
future astronomer.
And he's fucking 17 years old.

794
00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:38.560
And he tells this story about Carl Sagan,

795
00:46:38.561 --> 00:46:42.100
his kindness and his welcoming him to the,
the,
you know,

796
00:46:42.101 --> 00:46:44.050
the Brotherhood of scientists.

797
00:46:44.051 --> 00:46:48.760
Like essentially like inspiring him to be who he is today.
One of the greatest,

798
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:52.510
one of our greatest public speakers about signs ever.
Neil degrasse Tyson.

799
00:46:52.511 --> 00:46:54.670
I mean it's,
it's tough to get a more passionate,

800
00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:59.380
engaging guy speaking with a sense of humor,
with a great sense of humor.
So,

801
00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:02.310
and just super brilliant guy too.

802
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:06.870
But his story about Carl Sagan meeting him and sort of mentoring him and giving

803
00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:11.560
him his home phone number.
Wow.
Those bumps,
Matt.
Just flat goosebumps.

804
00:47:11.561 --> 00:47:12.930
Amazing.
That's amazing.

805
00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:18.410
<v 1>It wasn't just a scientist,
he was political.
He was very much about world peace.</v>

806
00:47:18.411 --> 00:47:20.720
He was about stopping nuclear proliferation.

807
00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:23.710
<v 7>Who's about marijuana?
Was He crossing and smoked marijuana?</v>

808
00:47:23.711 --> 00:47:26.080
Virtually every day was alive.
Wow.
Yeah.

809
00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:29.380
Carl Sagan and people you don't know their sure.
Just to.

810
00:47:29.381 --> 00:47:31.570
Great Work of a good man.
No,
look,

811
00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.720
I will tell you a quote that I have on my message board that I use.

812
00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:35.860
This is by Carl Sagan.

813
00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:39.760
I am convinced that there are genuine and valid levels of perception available

814
00:47:39.761 --> 00:47:44.080
with cannabis and probably other drugs which are through the defects of our

815
00:47:44.081 --> 00:47:49.081
society and our educational system unavailable to us without such drugs.

816
00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:54.170
Boom.
I mean that's a very well measured way of saying we'd is awesome.
That's it.

817
00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:57.580
<v 1>Very well.
And other psychedelic drugs,
LSD,</v>

818
00:47:57.581 --> 00:48:00.130
they're bringing back exactly this test.

819
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:03.850
And you've seen that this a real Germany or something?
Well,

820
00:48:03.851 --> 00:48:08.320
there was a recent study here,
LSD study that uh,
maps put up.

821
00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:12.190
But you know who else is producing that cosmos is a Seth macfarlane.

822
00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:15.100
He's the executive producer.
He's the guy who,
he's the guy who reintroduced it.

823
00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:18.190
Good for him because he doesn't have enough to do.

824
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:22.750
He just directed a movie that he wrote,
and while he was doing that,

825
00:48:22.751 --> 00:48:27.751
he wrote a novel based on the movie he's making as he was executive producing

826
00:48:28.361 --> 00:48:31.360
the new cosmos and overseeing family guy.

827
00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:36.790
You gotta be fucking kidding me.
March 4th,
2014 the results.

828
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:40.930
<v 7>So the first study of the therapeutic use of lysergic acid dye,</v>

829
00:48:40.931 --> 00:48:45.360
ethylamine [inaudible] [inaudible],
is that how you say it?
Like ceramic acid?

830
00:48:45.361 --> 00:48:47.920
Diatima made LSD,
that's all anybody ever says.

831
00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:51.980
LSD and humans over 40 years were published online in peer review,

832
00:48:51.981 --> 00:48:54.580
Journal of nervous and mental disease,

833
00:48:55.330 --> 00:49:00.220
sponsored by the nonprofit Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic
Studies.

834
00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:04.360
We had Rick Doblin from there on the podcast.
He was awesome.
Yeah,
really,

835
00:49:04.361 --> 00:49:05.141
really interesting guy.

836
00:49:05.141 --> 00:49:09.070
And they're trying to let people know from all these different psychedelic

837
00:49:09.071 --> 00:49:09.461
studies,

838
00:49:09.461 --> 00:49:13.870
but this double blind placebo controlled pilot study in 12 subject shows to see

839
00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:18.890
statistically significant reductions in anxiety following to LSD assisted

840
00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:20.530
psychotherapy sessions.

841
00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:24.360
<v 1>Yeah.
They talked about specifically fear of mortality,
Lsd,</v>

842
00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:25.361
<v 7>bing you with,
well,</v>

843
00:49:25.361 --> 00:49:29.850
did you ever see Larry Hagman when Larry Hagman talked about that before died?

844
00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.010
Larry Hagman,
uh,
he was on CNN,
I think it was.

845
00:49:33.011 --> 00:49:36.930
It was one of those major network news shows and he said that doing acid,
uh,

846
00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.680
was one of the,
uh,

847
00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:42.820
changing moments of his life because it removed his fear of dying.
I said,

848
00:49:42.821 --> 00:49:44.170
he no longer is afraid to die.

849
00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:47.410
He said to became completely at peace with it because he understands what it

850
00:49:47.411 --> 00:49:48.244
really is now.

851
00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:52.900
<v 1>And that's,
that's what Buddhism is based on.
I mean,
their book is,
you know,
uh,</v>

852
00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:56.070
what is it,
uh,
something about Dodd,

853
00:49:56.071 --> 00:49:59.860
the book of dying because once you accept death and you can start to live,

854
00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:02.020
<v 7>that's a good way of looking at it.</v>

855
00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:05.430
It's certainly not good to be a fearful person.
If something that's inevitable,

856
00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:10.020
I think about it too much.
It's under,
it's hard to not,
we also have to have kids.

857
00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.540
We also don't have a good system.

858
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:17.630
Like our system is like we've inherited a broken system of culture or our system

859
00:50:17.641 --> 00:50:21.030
and the way we set up communities,
our system and law enforcement,

860
00:50:21.031 --> 00:50:24.360
our system and prisons are system and drug enforcement.

861
00:50:24.361 --> 00:50:27.830
All that shit is poorly formed and it's,
it's we're,
we're,

862
00:50:27.831 --> 00:50:32.090
we have been born into the momentum of these shitty ideas and we're stuck with

863
00:50:32.091 --> 00:50:34.490
this two party system or stuck with corruption.

864
00:50:34.491 --> 00:50:36.920
We're stuck with all this really shitty Pete.

865
00:50:36.921 --> 00:50:39.530
It's like everybody being shitty to each other because everybody else is being

866
00:50:39.531 --> 00:50:41.570
shitty to each other and no one knows how to stop it.

867
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:43.370
No one knows how to stop it.
One knows,

868
00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:45.500
no one knows how to stop beating the shit out of your kids.

869
00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:48.590
So you raised monsters that you just released out into the world cause you

870
00:50:48.591 --> 00:50:51.500
fucked their fucking brain up when they were little babies.
We got to,

871
00:50:51.501 --> 00:50:56.130
if we can figure out a way to stop all that and in tasks,

872
00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:00.590
Wifi and institute a more logical way of communicating and dealing with each

873
00:51:00.591 --> 00:51:02.600
other,
we have massive potential.

874
00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:05.630
It's like there's so much potential for the human race right now.

875
00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:09.560
And this is one of the craziest times ever as far as the ability to pass ideas

876
00:51:09.561 --> 00:51:11.570
around,
right?
There's never been a time like this,

877
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:15.710
but yet it's still a time where Russia is in the middle of a fucking war.

878
00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:17.750
What are they going to do again?
They're invading Ukraine.

879
00:51:17.751 --> 00:51:20.120
They're going to take over the United States like Dick Cheney,

880
00:51:20.121 --> 00:51:23.240
but it's fake heart is saying that we should go,
uh,
consider Miller

881
00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:26.670
<v 1>call called war.
He's talking about military action against Russia.</v>

882
00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:31.590
What the fuck was just the chance to call?
It's the chance to call,
uh,

883
00:51:31.591 --> 00:51:34.140
Obama Pussy,
which is all they want.
And if you look at,

884
00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:39.180
I just reading this thing about which conflicts we decided where moral to get

885
00:51:39.181 --> 00:51:43.290
involved in,
whether you're talking about Bosnia or Rwanda or I rack,

886
00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:48.640
you know we are all over the place in when we think it's okay to jump in when a

887
00:51:49.111 --> 00:51:54.090
country is invading another country.
Kuwait.
Yeah,
that's fine.
Rwanda,
no.

888
00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:57.810
Subsahara Africa where the fucking John Jewel weed or cutting people's fucking

889
00:51:57.811 --> 00:52:02.330
arms off from raping women system at.
Nope.
Yup.
Note son.

890
00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:05.820
Cause there's no fucking oil.
North Korea is the best example ever.

891
00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:10.470
North Korea was a horrific place with nuclear weapons.
Not only that,

892
00:52:10.471 --> 00:52:12.180
you talk about human rights abuse.

893
00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:16.800
People are living in fucking prison camps where they're born in a prison camp.

894
00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:22.240
It's a prison camps because of the fucking thought crimes of their parents and

895
00:52:22.291 --> 00:52:26.940
they're being raised to turn their parents in it because they saw their parent

896
00:52:26.941 --> 00:52:31.680
like take a piece of bread.
It's fucking nuts.

897
00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:34.650
<v 7>Someone drew a guy who was a prison guard.</v>

898
00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:38.880
He drew all the various stages of,
of a prisoner.

899
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:39.930
See if you can find that.

900
00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:45.210
He drew North Korean prison guard or it was a prison guard or escaped prisoner

901
00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:47.430
as escaped prisoner.
Yeah,

902
00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:52.550
it was an escaped prisoner and he had drawn all these various stages of a,

903
00:52:53.130 --> 00:52:56.340
might've been the guard of think w but whatever it is,

904
00:52:56.430 --> 00:53:00.330
these images of like how they would decide like when a person was,

905
00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:04.170
when you could kill them,
when you beat them up,
when you starve them.

906
00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:06.990
Like it was like they had broken them down into categories.

907
00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:09.060
Like this is a person that's basically dead.

908
00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:13.410
This is a person that's like less look drawings by North Korean countries.

909
00:53:13.411 --> 00:53:17.370
Can't buy an escaped prisoner.
Yeah.
Okay.
Was a prisoner,

910
00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:20.220
but he was talking about people just essentially starving to death.

911
00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:25.250
The guards would just randomly beat people to death and that this is how they

912
00:53:25.351 --> 00:53:26.190
kept people.

913
00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:29.730
This is like he's talking about the different weights that the people would be

914
00:53:29.731 --> 00:53:32.670
at and how they would stand like there were starving and they would make them

915
00:53:32.671 --> 00:53:33.840
stand in front of the,

916
00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:37.770
all the different generals and soldiers make him stand there.

917
00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:42.100
<v 1>No,
all they eat there is like cabbage soup twice a day.</v>

918
00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:45.610
I look at these bodies all hungry all the time.

919
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:47.290
They got the scarf tied up in.

920
00:53:47.291 --> 00:53:51.250
This guy's just kicking him and other people were watching and waiting to get

921
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:54.720
their next,
they fed people that dogs.
Yeah,

922
00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:57.300
like regularly too.

923
00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:00.030
<v 7>Dogs.
Just wrap your head around that,</v>

924
00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:03.750
wrap your head around starving someone to the point where they just literally

925
00:54:03.751 --> 00:54:06.730
can't defend themselves.
Then pushing them into a bunch of dogs at dogs.

926
00:54:06.731 --> 00:54:10.410
Just tear them apart and then then think about the fact that these people are

927
00:54:10.411 --> 00:54:11.280
living in 2004

928
00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:14.590
<v 1>13 and we know about it.
We weren't doing nothing about it.</v>

929
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:16.540
<v 7>I mean,
I dunno how much it's going on over there.</v>

930
00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:18.150
I don't know if it's an isolated camp.

931
00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:21.750
<v 1>No,
no.
They had a lot of escape people and they all corroborate.</v>

932
00:54:21.751 --> 00:54:25.890
They get them to describe it separately and the stories are consistent that they

933
00:54:25.891 --> 00:54:27.780
live in fucking barracks,

934
00:54:27.781 --> 00:54:31.440
just like a gulag and they work sunup to sundown.

935
00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:34.440
They barely eat and they're,
and deer,

936
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:38.910
they're killed in front of the rest of the community where you have to watch.

937
00:54:38.911 --> 00:54:42.000
If you avert your gaze,
you could be killed.

938
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:44.970
<v 7>Yeah.
Well,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm sure it takes place when I say that.</v>

939
00:54:44.971 --> 00:54:46.890
I don't know what's really going on.

940
00:54:46.891 --> 00:54:48.980
It's because I haven't experienced it personally,
but these,

941
00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:52.640
these stories that we're getting back when I was going to say is they're there.

942
00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:55.950
If they are true,
they're one of the scariest things ever.

943
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:57.750
The country with nuclear weapons.

944
00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:01.050
How about the fact that it just kills his uncle and then kills his uncle's

945
00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:01.913
family?

946
00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:06.480
He killed his uncle's 20 year old kids because he didn't want them growing up to

947
00:55:06.481 --> 00:55:10.890
kill him someday.
He killed everybody and he took the wife and gave her a raise.

948
00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:16.740
Nice Dude.
I mean,
this is 2014 and this is crazy shit.

949
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:20.190
<v 1>And you know what?
The economy of North Korea's,
it's methamphetamine.</v>

950
00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:24.120
It's a ID theft.
Nothing they do is legal.
They,

951
00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:28.650
everything they do is they've got fucking computers hacking all over the place.

952
00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:33.010
There's selling drugs to,
uh,
China and Russia.
Jesus,

953
00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:35.910
they don't have fucking crops.
They don't have shit.

954
00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:42.260
<v 7>But then look at South Korea and it's his booming economy.</v>

955
00:55:42.350 --> 00:55:45.770
They make the best cell phones in the world.
They have awesome televisions.

956
00:55:45.771 --> 00:55:48.140
Their electronics divisions are off the hook.

957
00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:51.560
I mean they have like some of the fastest internet speeds in the world.

958
00:55:51.590 --> 00:55:54.980
<v 1>Those motherfuckers come over here and they kick ass.</v>

959
00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:58.190
They start with the fruit cart and they ended up with a fucking factory.

960
00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:02.010
Will the work ethic in education?
Immunity?

961
00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:06.340
<v 7>It's unbelievable.
Unreal.
My friend,
junk Schick.
I Wa when I was a kid,</v>

962
00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:08.080
when I was doing taekwondo,

963
00:56:08.081 --> 00:56:11.950
there was a friend of mine who's somewhere around my age,

964
00:56:11.951 --> 00:56:12.910
maybe a little bit older.

965
00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:14.410
He might've been like a couple of years older than me who?

966
00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:18.250
He was a national taekwondo champion and he was also a doctor.

967
00:56:18.251 --> 00:56:19.990
He was a trained to be a doctor,

968
00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:23.020
so he was going to medical school and he was still,

969
00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:26.860
and he was on the US Olympic team.
I mean he was on the national taekwondo too,

970
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:28.870
right?
It wasn't the Olympic team at the time.
It was like,

971
00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:32.800
I think it was 86 and he could play the shit out of a cello a,

972
00:56:32.801 --> 00:56:34.210
I don't know if he had any musical talent,

973
00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:38.350
but I never met a dude in my life who worked harder than this guy.

974
00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:43.360
This guy would fucking study all day and then you'd run upstairs who'd run

975
00:56:43.361 --> 00:56:45.280
upstairs like in the dormitory.
And he was like,

976
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:50.430
he had glasses and he was very slight and he wasn't physically very strong man

977
00:56:50.561 --> 00:56:54.280
at all.
He was just really fucking smart and really hard working.

978
00:56:54.281 --> 00:56:58.870
And his father really wanted him to be like a national taekwondo champion as

979
00:56:58.871 --> 00:57:02.620
well as being a doctor.
So he won the fucking nationals.

980
00:57:02.621 --> 00:57:04.960
He was a guy that I trained with on a super regular basis.

981
00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:09.640
Just being around that kid,
like in seeing him go through medical schools,

982
00:57:09.641 --> 00:57:13.030
keep seeing him constantly studying.
When I knew that I would fuck off.

983
00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:17.050
Like I just,
I wouldn't be able to do it.
I would need some,
some,
some blow off.

984
00:57:17.051 --> 00:57:19.810
I would need something.
Right.
But with him it was nothing.

985
00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:23.110
There was no girlfriend.
There's,
we didn't have girlfriends like on,
at the time,

986
00:57:23.111 --> 00:57:25.420
like,
uh,
you know,
uh,
in time rather.

987
00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:30.280
But at the time when I first met him,
when he was training for the national team,

988
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:33.580
there was fucking nothing going on in that guy's life except work.

989
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:35.650
There was barely enough time to sleep.

990
00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:37.360
<v 1>Yeah.
We hear about the market,</v>

991
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:39.860
like my daughter plays the flute and she just had this,

992
00:57:39.861 --> 00:57:42.290
they have to get certified at a certain level.

993
00:57:42.291 --> 00:57:45.280
You go and you test to get certified.
Um,

994
00:57:45.690 --> 00:57:48.440
they did helps you get to the next level in your school band.

995
00:57:48.441 --> 00:57:49.730
I don't know what the fuck it was.

996
00:57:49.731 --> 00:57:52.730
I've taken her to test and I just sit there going on and I didn't care.

997
00:57:52.731 --> 00:57:57.680
She goes in and she comes at and I go,
uh,
Jeff Fun and she's like,
yeah,

998
00:57:57.681 --> 00:58:00.830
I think I screwed up a few times.
I'm like,
all right,
let's go to Starbucks.

999
00:58:00.831 --> 00:58:02.930
I gave you one of those frozen things.
Cheer up.

1000
00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:07.400
I'm watching this fucking Korean mom and I'm reading the paper hanging out out

1001
00:58:07.401 --> 00:58:11.870
front.
She's sitting on a chair waiting and the second the kid comes out,

1002
00:58:12.050 --> 00:58:13.700
how did you do?
How was it?

1003
00:58:13.701 --> 00:58:18.200
And the kid is not in a scary way but like concerned and the kid,

1004
00:58:18.350 --> 00:58:22.040
the kid was in a suit.
My daughter is wearing shorts and a tee shirt.

1005
00:58:22.041 --> 00:58:26.780
Like you just saw the differences culturally and how they have expectations for

1006
00:58:26.781 --> 00:58:29.540
the kids and it's not like authoritarian.

1007
00:58:29.541 --> 00:58:32.960
It really is just like they are all over you.

1008
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:38.070
<v 7>Well they are unbelievable hard workers and very proud of the hard work that</v>

1009
00:58:38.071 --> 00:58:40.440
they've done.
And they want their children to be hard workers too.

1010
00:58:40.441 --> 00:58:42.420
Like my friend's dad wasn't,

1011
00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:44.740
it didn't beat him up but didn't do anything horrible to him.
He was,

1012
00:58:44.890 --> 00:58:47.130
he loved him.
Right.
He expected a lot.

1013
00:58:47.131 --> 00:58:49.770
He knew his kid was exceptional to his kid is exceptionally smart,

1014
00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:51.720
exceptionally tough.
You know,

1015
00:58:51.721 --> 00:58:54.630
he wasn't a physically gifted guy and he won the nationals.
Right.
He was,

1016
00:58:54.690 --> 00:58:55.523
he was amazing.

1017
00:58:55.830 --> 00:59:00.770
But I just remember being like very influenced by him by his work ethic about

1018
00:59:00.771 --> 00:59:02.040
like so impressed with it.

1019
00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:03.940
<v 1>And that's,
it's amazing when you think about it.</v>

1020
00:59:03.941 --> 00:59:08.410
All this anti immigration shit is like without these people coming in with that

1021
00:59:08.411 --> 00:59:13.000
spirit and that,
that edge and that desire,
it helps our kids

1022
00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:17.040
<v 7>tell you what Greg Fitzsimmons,
I don't know what government agency working for.</v>

1023
00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:18.890
You want to talk that communist bullshit,

1024
00:59:18.891 --> 00:59:22.110
but you obviously never worked at the mines.
I worked at because

1025
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:25.850
<v 4>as soon as the Mexicans came over here and start taking our land,
okay,</v>

1026
00:59:25.851 --> 00:59:29.720
you couldn't get a fucking job there and everything went to shit and then math

1027
00:59:29.721 --> 00:59:34.660
came in so you can go talk that fucking east coast liberal bullshit all day and

1028
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:39.170
all I want to do,
sit in the hammock and eat fucking mango.
Lazy,

1029
00:59:39.171 --> 00:59:43.340
Lazy,
get welfare.
It's dead simple.
Come in here Sam.

1030
00:59:43.341 --> 00:59:47.810
Drop a baby,
go back,
get fucked again by some drug.
Lord.

1031
00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:51.350
Come out.
Pop out another little mix again.

1032
00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:55.090
<v 7>Yeah.
How many,
how many jobs is a Jamaican need?
Seriously?</v>

1033
00:59:56.300 --> 01:00:00.500
<v 4>You can't take all the jobs.
You mother fucker making us look bad.</v>

1034
01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:02.430
Fucking up the union hours.

1035
01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:06.480
<v 7>Cause there's all these union rules.
You know like,
like unions.</v>

1036
01:00:06.481 --> 01:00:09.630
Like you get time off during the day,
you get coffee breaks.
They,

1037
01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:13.550
they every good union contract.
Oh we had it scheduled in.

1038
01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:17.130
<v 1>Oh yeah,
I been in a union.
I've been on union jobs.
What did you ever watch?</v>

1039
01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:21.120
TV shows and stuff like that.
Supermarket.
And we used to get breaks.

1040
01:00:21.121 --> 01:00:25.200
Like you work an hour,
you got fucking 12 minutes every three hours,

1041
01:00:25.201 --> 01:00:29.970
you've got a 45 minute lunch break.
It was suede.
Oh they had it set up nice.

1042
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:30.320
Yeah.

1043
01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.730
<v 7>You know,
and there was a,
I had a buddy who worked at a,</v>

1044
01:00:32.731 --> 01:00:36.170
a automotive factory and he was in the automotive Worker's Union and they had a

1045
01:00:36.171 --> 01:00:40.490
bunch of jobs that really could be done easily by one person,

1046
01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:43.700
but they had two people assigned to those jobs just so that the insured,

1047
01:00:43.701 --> 01:00:46.490
there was more jobs,
right.
So they created like a fake job.

1048
01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:49.580
And what these guys would do is they would do a four on four off.

1049
01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:54.110
So like if you and I were partners,
we would,
we'd be working in a a factory,

1050
01:00:54.111 --> 01:00:56.780
but really you could do the job easy by herself.

1051
01:00:56.810 --> 01:00:58.760
And I can agenda job easy by myself,

1052
01:00:58.761 --> 01:01:02.270
but this way you work four hours a day and then I come in and I take over the

1053
01:01:02.271 --> 01:01:05.150
other four hours and you could fuck off for the rest of the day.

1054
01:01:05.151 --> 01:01:08.240
So you have to seek a job for eight hours.
You get paid for eight hours.

1055
01:01:08.241 --> 01:01:11.630
So the job gets done no matter what because someone's always there that you're

1056
01:01:11.631 --> 01:01:11.901
there.

1057
01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:15.440
I'm there were a team and we're pretending that we're working in eight hours a

1058
01:01:15.441 --> 01:01:18.800
day,
but you know,
you're going to the gym,
you fucking go to the post office.

1059
01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:22.080
<v 1>I buddies,
like I was saying,
I grew up in a town that had a GM plant.</v>

1060
01:01:22.081 --> 01:01:26.210
And so a lot of the people there,
and it was like the drug use was rampant.

1061
01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:28.980
These dudes,
if they had a,
if they had a noon shift,

1062
01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:33.330
they were all to fucking do drop in having a couple of shots before they went in

1063
01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.960
all smoking pot.
And you know,
and,
and here's the thing,

1064
01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:41.250
I'm very pro union in the sense that we have big business,

1065
01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:44.250
we have multinational corporations getting bigger and bigger,

1066
01:01:44.251 --> 01:01:48.670
beating down minimum wage,
healthcare benefits.
So they're ha,

1067
01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:53.220
we have to fix the fucking unions.
They're fucked up,
they're bloated.
And they,

1068
01:01:53.221 --> 01:01:55.260
you know,
they cease to function,

1069
01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:59.970
but we got to fix them because without them there's no push back against the

1070
01:01:59.971 --> 01:02:00.804
corporation.

1071
01:02:00.910 --> 01:02:05.020
<v 7>Yeah,
well I agree.
I think that things get out of hand.</v>

1072
01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:09.220
They go back and forth.
That's what it is.
It's like is it important to have them?

1073
01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:10.083
Yeah,
it is,

1074
01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:13.510
but is it important to not let them get out of control and get fucking crazy

1075
01:02:13.511 --> 01:02:16.570
ingredient?
Yeah,
that is too,
right?
Because it's sort of anti competitive.

1076
01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:20.030
I don't think that you should be able to pay person a nickel a day to have

1077
01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:24.810
<v 3>them work in your factory,
but if it is legal to pay a person a nickel a day,</v>

1078
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:29.640
just because they live on this fucking side of the line,
that's,
that's fucked.

1079
01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:32.490
Like what?
What does this company,
what are you selling?
What are you guys selling?

1080
01:02:32.550 --> 01:02:35.430
Okay.
There's only one way to sell things.
Let's just be real clear.

1081
01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:39.300
You have to pay people and you have to pay them like an actual good amount of

1082
01:02:39.301 --> 01:02:42.300
money that they can live on and can't have him living in fucking dormitories.

1083
01:02:42.301 --> 01:02:45.060
We put nets up everywhere because they want to jump off the roof.

1084
01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.790
If you're really an American company,
you're selling shit.

1085
01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:50.400
You shouldn't be fucking running sweatshops.

1086
01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:53.820
You shouldn't be having places in Mexico where someone's making a dollar a day.

1087
01:02:53.950 --> 01:02:55.870
<v 1>Yeah,
no,
that's just it.
Oh,
that's what you're saying.</v>

1088
01:02:55.871 --> 01:02:59.140
On the other side of the line right there that a company has to be

1089
01:02:59.141 --> 01:03:00.460
accountability for,
I mean,

1090
01:03:00.461 --> 01:03:04.060
you hear about these Cambodian fucking sweat shops where the with the building

1091
01:03:04.061 --> 01:03:08.320
goes on fire and 200 people die and it's barely in our newspaper.

1092
01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:12.760
If that shit had,
if one person gets a hangnail at a place in Michigan,

1093
01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:16.930
we all know about it,
but meanwhile they're not human beings over there.

1094
01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:20.520
<v 3>Exactly.
Exactly.
If that was over here,</v>

1095
01:03:20.550 --> 01:03:22.200
it would be horrendous.

1096
01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:25.260
If you had seen any of the things that you're seeing and Foxconn where they're

1097
01:03:25.261 --> 01:03:28.680
trying to make adjustments and alterations to their fucking,

1098
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:33.030
their workers' lives to make it easier to live in the factory where you work,

1099
01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:35.310
it's still,
you're living in the factory where you work.

1100
01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:38.470
It's like there's this new thing that's seaworld is putting out the same black

1101
01:03:38.471 --> 01:03:43.170
fish is propaganda by the activists like these tweets and they're getting

1102
01:03:43.171 --> 01:03:46.530
assaulted online because people are reading these offensive tweets like you guys

1103
01:03:46.531 --> 01:03:50.200
don't understand it.
It's not whether or not black fish was,
you know,

1104
01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:54.780
somehow or another edited to make you guys look more evil than you actually are.

1105
01:03:54.810 --> 01:03:59.610
What you do is inherently evil and now we know that's what's going on.

1106
01:03:59.611 --> 01:04:03.360
Like your job shouldn't exist anymore,
right?
You guys are trying to save slavery,

1107
01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:05.340
you're trying to save orcas.

1108
01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:10.230
These super intelligent things that kill they kill on a regular basis.

1109
01:04:10.231 --> 01:04:13.200
That's the life in the ocean killing fish and surviving.

1110
01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:14.610
You've removed all of that.

1111
01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:18.660
You put them in a fish tank and they can think and they have accents.

1112
01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:21.720
They have different areas where they talk differently.

1113
01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:25.830
They have a full complex language that we don't understand and yet you

1114
01:04:25.831 --> 01:04:30.831
motherfuckers think that blackfish is wrong because they've exaggerated some

1115
01:04:31.051 --> 01:04:33.120
certain points.
Are you crazy?

1116
01:04:33.250 --> 01:04:35.380
<v 1>Yeah.
The spin on both sides.</v>

1117
01:04:35.381 --> 01:04:38.670
Well that's the problem is like we need some kind of a,

1118
01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:42.270
it used to be the New York Times and that kind of got my,

1119
01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:45.160
but what is the news agency that both sides,

1120
01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:48.160
the reasonable part of both sides can go.
All right.

1121
01:04:48.161 --> 01:04:53.160
Let's just say New York Times is not too far in either direction and,

1122
01:04:53.161 --> 01:04:56.200
and pull,
if they do a story,
you can't fucking spin it.

1123
01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:56.911
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1124
01:04:56.911 --> 01:05:01.110
I think there's some people today that are coming up now that are involved in

1125
01:05:01.111 --> 01:05:05.370
internet media that are going to have a way better chance of pulling this off

1126
01:05:05.550 --> 01:05:09.990
then anybody that's a part of CNN or anybody that's a part of,
um,
but there's,
uh,

1127
01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:13.080
uh,
I'm glad you brought that up because there was a thing in the news yesterday

1128
01:05:13.081 --> 01:05:16.110
about pussy riot getting attacked,
puts you right,

1129
01:05:16.111 --> 01:05:18.010
got attacked in Mcdonald's and now

1130
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.710
<v 2>they're saying Russia.
Yeah.
They're seeing,
it's staged.</v>

1131
01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:24.430
They're saying that the attack,
that pussy riot getting attacked by these men,

1132
01:05:24.431 --> 01:05:27.610
like randomly in the Mcdonald's a stage and there's a video of it.

1133
01:05:27.611 --> 01:05:30.580
So Brian pull up the video that they're staging at themselves.
Yeah.

1134
01:05:30.581 --> 01:05:33.490
That it's fake.
I could say that.
Well,
I mean,
they're performance artists.

1135
01:05:33.491 --> 01:05:35.300
That's what they do.
I know,
but they're,

1136
01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.570
but they're making themselves out to be victims.

1137
01:05:37.571 --> 01:05:39.610
Like that's their message they want,
they want a stage,

1138
01:05:39.611 --> 01:05:42.990
someone persecuting them and beating them up because they're losing their,

1139
01:05:42.991 --> 01:05:45.100
they're losing their heat a little bit.
They're not the hot,

1140
01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:47.290
they're not the hot item that people are talking about.

1141
01:05:47.291 --> 01:05:48.460
So they got to get back in there,

1142
01:05:48.490 --> 01:05:50.740
but they just got a horsewhip there are a couple of weeks ago.

1143
01:05:50.770 --> 01:05:54.160
It's almost like they're addicted to the attention.
Yeah,
definitely.

1144
01:05:54.161 --> 01:05:58.450
That one is so fucking hot.
Which holy Shit.

1145
01:05:58.451 --> 01:06:02.170
And she did porn.
You can,
you can see are doing porn for pussy.
Right?

1146
01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:06.370
Do you have the video?
Yeah.
And she's got the most beautiful face.

1147
01:06:06.371 --> 01:06:07.870
Nice rack and excited.
Lou,

1148
01:06:07.871 --> 01:06:12.280
you're moving your hands in your lap and you got us see pussy riot.

1149
01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:15.460
But how gangster are those girls that go to fucking Siberia?

1150
01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:19.690
They locked him up in cages in Siberia and then they're out protesting for gay

1151
01:06:19.691 --> 01:06:23.530
people at the Olympics and they could have got out if all they had to do was

1152
01:06:23.531 --> 01:06:27.430
sign some waiver that they were enemies of the state and they could have walked

1153
01:06:27.790 --> 01:06:30.310
and they were like,
no,
we'll do our time.
So how do you feel about them?

1154
01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.920
I'm very impressed with them for that,
but how do you feel about them?

1155
01:06:32.921 --> 01:06:36.100
If they really did fake this,
their music's horrible.
That's all I know.

1156
01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:40.330
Where's it the one on the right?
Her on the left,
but there's a video,
Brian.

1157
01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:43.640
There's a video of them getting beat up.
That's not it.

1158
01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:49.330
They're performance artists.
I think that by staging that it's the same way that,

1159
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:54.190
you know,
when we sent,
when we sent students w uh,
protesters to Selma,
Alabama,

1160
01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.950
we knew they were going to get beat up when we sent it in Mississippi.

1161
01:06:56.951 --> 01:06:59.590
They were going to get beat up and we were going to get it on camera and it was

1162
01:06:59.591 --> 01:07:03.400
going to prove a point.
Right?
That was all staged.
Yeah.
Well it is in a sense,

1163
01:07:03.401 --> 01:07:07.180
if you know it's going to come right,
you get cameras there is staged.
You know,

1164
01:07:07.181 --> 01:07:10.150
that's a Alex Jones technique.
Is this actually them

1165
01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:14.460
<v 5>the covered with,</v>

1166
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.600
<v 2>oh,
that's a little too convenient getting their hair Patrick's day.</v>

1167
01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:21.510
This is how you know she's fake.
There's no paint in her hair.

1168
01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:24.530
<v 5>Chicks don't want to get their hair painted.
Oh,
here's the girl.</v>

1169
01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:29.390
Yeah,
she looks a little calm.

1170
01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.400
Wait a minute.

1171
01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:41.720
These don't add hitting the pretty ones.

1172
01:07:58.330 --> 01:08:01.420
<v 2>Okay.
So for folks who just listening,
you're like,
what the fuck is going on here?</v>

1173
01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:02.200
Um,

1174
01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:07.200
these girls are sitting there eating and then some guys come over and they start

1175
01:08:07.271 --> 01:08:11.620
fucking with them and everybody says it's fake.
It seems very fake.
It seems fake.

1176
01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:15.830
I mean like the guys are like kind of half smiling.
The ones that attacked and,

1177
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:20.150
<v 0>well,
you know though,
if you really understand Russians,
I don't,</v>

1178
01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:25.190
I'm not convinced this is fake Russian guys or some tough motherfuckers there.

1179
01:08:25.191 --> 01:08:28.850
There are different breed and I think they're used to conflict on a regular

1180
01:08:28.851 --> 01:08:32.120
basis.
So I think the way they interact with each other like,

1181
01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:35.480
like so close to violence and you'll smiling and shit like that.

1182
01:08:35.481 --> 01:08:36.440
I think that's legit.

1183
01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.800
<v 1>Right?
Physical violence over there.
It's not the same common place.</v>

1184
01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:40.760
It's not the same thing.

1185
01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:45.620
But I watched a lot of like found fights on the internet and the Russian ones

1186
01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:46.454
are just there

1187
01:08:46.530 --> 01:08:50.180
<v 0>on a totally different level.
Here's why.
I think it's fake or the,</v>

1188
01:08:50.190 --> 01:08:51.060
I think it's stage.

1189
01:08:51.061 --> 01:08:54.060
At least the girls are just sitting there like are there waiting for it to

1190
01:08:54.061 --> 01:08:56.400
happen and there to calm that.

1191
01:08:56.401 --> 01:08:59.400
Nothing bad is gonna happen while they're getting yelled at by these fucking

1192
01:08:59.401 --> 01:09:02.370
hooligans and there's a lot of cameras.
That's a big one.

1193
01:09:02.610 --> 01:09:07.410
Camera Angle before they even got attacked.
Yeah.
Fun.
The porno of the hot one.

1194
01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:09.870
Don't,
don't,
don't,
don't tell it.
Oh,
you don't put that on your,
no,

1195
01:09:09.871 --> 01:09:11.620
we can't use stream of a pull it off.
Yeah,

1196
01:09:11.850 --> 01:09:14.670
but don't do it because I don't want you to get obsessed.
I look at you,

1197
01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:18.090
look at your face.
It doesn't take away from the good things they do,

1198
01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:20.120
but it's disappointing,
right?
It doesn't it.

1199
01:09:20.121 --> 01:09:22.230
Is that how you feel about seeing something like that?
If it is fake

1200
01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:26.680
<v 1>now,
I think it's about taking a theme and trying to illustrate it through</v>

1201
01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.810
interactions in the,
you know,
that's,

1202
01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:33.010
that's cause you're a god damn liberal politics.
That's true.
Well,

1203
01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:35.560
I think Wallman.
Where's the fucking pants in the house fit?

1204
01:09:35.561 --> 01:09:38.380
Salmons ever since they brought capitalism in Russia.

1205
01:09:38.381 --> 01:09:42.040
They ruined the whole God damn thing.
They had a good thing going socialism.

1206
01:09:42.130 --> 01:09:44.900
These chicks are standing on the edge of a doc.
Is that what that is?
Now?

1207
01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:46.840
This is that the Olympics.
That's a wall behind them.

1208
01:09:46.841 --> 01:09:49.810
I thought that was wonderful though.
That's real.
They whip him with,

1209
01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:53.820
with the horse whips.
Dax.
Yeah,
and they whipped it photographer too.
Yeah.

1210
01:09:53.821 --> 01:09:54.654
That's how you knows.

1211
01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:58.090
<v 0>That's real shit.
No,
I think this was real,
but it might not be.</v>

1212
01:09:58.091 --> 01:10:00.610
It might be bullshit as well.
It'd be funny if it was,

1213
01:10:00.611 --> 01:10:02.770
if they just keep doing these things over and over again,

1214
01:10:02.771 --> 01:10:06.850
staging these things to make the show what assholes.
The uh,

1215
01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.050
the Soviet cops are,

1216
01:10:08.730 --> 01:10:11.040
<v 1>but it really,
it was awful.
God,
that was,</v>

1217
01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:14.550
the Olympics was so fucking what a disaster.

1218
01:10:14.551 --> 01:10:18.330
The money they spent and the fact that Putin,

1219
01:10:18.331 --> 01:10:22.020
the whole time he knew what was going on in the Ukraine and he was going to

1220
01:10:22.021 --> 01:10:24.000
these sporting events and you get to,
you look at his face,

1221
01:10:24.001 --> 01:10:28.020
he was not enjoying himself.
He was very preoccupied with the Ukraine.

1222
01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:31.980
<v 0>Well,
that's an intense thing,
man.
You imagine being that car,</v>

1223
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:36.270
that guy is essentially taken over a country,
right?
I mean,

1224
01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:37.350
they have his photos.

1225
01:10:37.351 --> 01:10:40.620
Did you see all the different people that took photos of the photos of Putin

1226
01:10:40.621 --> 01:10:44.520
shirtless in their hotel rooms when they were staying over there?
No.
Shit.
Yeah,

1227
01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:48.660
shirtless Putin.
It's fly fishing framed on the wall.

1228
01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.030
Like he's a legit dictator.

1229
01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:56.400
Like Putin is a dictator of a giant country with a fucking a space program.

1230
01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:00.350
And the only way to get people down from the space station,
by the way,
you know,

1231
01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:03.990
we don't have a space shuttle anymore.
Oh,
that's like a gravity.

1232
01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:06.570
They had to go to the exact question wanting to get home.
Exactly.

1233
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:09.180
Either going to have to give the Russians or we'd have to go to another country

1234
01:11:09.181 --> 01:11:13.170
that's got a space program that's got a working shuttle.
Wow.
They,

1235
01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:14.040
the space shot a lot

1236
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:18.180
<v 3>of commission.
Could we get a ride?
Do you know how nuts that is,
man?</v>

1237
01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:22.350
I mean people like,
Whoa,
fuck and money.
No,
we read fucking,

1238
01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:26.280
we need to fucking fix this and fix their,
we don't need million fucking sports,

1239
01:11:26.281 --> 01:11:29.430
but I've seen that argument before.
It's such a stupid argument.

1240
01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:32.250
It's one of the dumbest arguments ever.
Amber alert.

1241
01:11:32.251 --> 01:11:34.720
Did you just get an amber alert?
Damn.

1242
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:39.950
It's one of the dumbest arguments ever because we are at our highest level

1243
01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:45.210
capable of doing shit that no racist done before.

1244
01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:48.210
We still have all these social issues,
but our capabilities,

1245
01:11:48.211 --> 01:11:50.220
our technological capabilities are,

1246
01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:53.430
or our abilities to affect our environment,

1247
01:11:53.431 --> 01:11:58.431
our abilities to create these innovative pieces of electronics and machinery and

1248
01:11:58.870 --> 01:12:01.230
it's never existed like this before.
It's never exist.

1249
01:12:01.231 --> 01:12:05.460
This is as high as it gets and we should continue to pursue the highest level of

1250
01:12:05.461 --> 01:12:08.730
that at whenever possible because at some point in time,

1251
01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:13.260
we're going to reach a point where we have such control over our environment

1252
01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:17.880
that we can eliminate all of the bullshit that we go through with pollution and

1253
01:12:17.881 --> 01:12:19.890
overpopulation,
all these different aspects.

1254
01:12:19.891 --> 01:12:22.620
We're going to be able to literally engineered the world.

1255
01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:27.330
<v 1>We'll be able to make food it that feeds everybody and it has no shelf life that</v>

1256
01:12:27.331 --> 01:12:29.010
has shelf life of a hundred years.

1257
01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:32.400
<v 3>It might not be us,
it might not be our grandchildren even.</v>

1258
01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:35.520
But if we stay alive one day,

1259
01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:37.440
we will reach peak efficiency,

1260
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:42.470
will reach some sort of a technological singularity where we figure out a way to

1261
01:12:42.810 --> 01:12:45.150
control everything,
to live in harmony.

1262
01:12:45.151 --> 01:12:47.640
We figured out a way to eliminate violence through technology.

1263
01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:51.660
That sounds preposterous,
but why would we assume that emotions,
you know,

1264
01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:54.680
can't be eventually managed?
Why would,

1265
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:59.370
why wouldn't we assume that we couldn't program minds to be healthier and more,

1266
01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:00.380
more aggressive thing,

1267
01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:03.750
<v 1>but I don't know.
With all the technological advancement we make,</v>

1268
01:13:03.751 --> 01:13:06.630
have we come across any,

1269
01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:11.190
any means of improving people's,
not emotional,
spiritual,

1270
01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:12.253
we'll wealth.

1271
01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:13.350
<v 3>Not yet,
but yes.</v>

1272
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:18.270
The one that allows the vehicle of human interaction to much larger channels,

1273
01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:22.560
that's the internet allows people like there's a lot bad

1274
01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.250
<v 1>still cerebra I'm talking about,
I mean there's,</v>

1275
01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:29.480
<v 3>it's affecting people.
It's cerebral for sure,
but cerebral changes,
mindsets,</v>

1276
01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:34.190
mindsets,
change culture,
right?
I mean it's,
it's the most impactful thing.

1277
01:13:34.191 --> 01:13:35.600
The human race has ever seen.

1278
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:38.450
I think it's just happened right in front of our face and it's like a

1279
01:13:38.451 --> 01:13:41.420
firecracker went off and everyone's like trying to figure out what happened,

1280
01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:42.770
what's going on,
what happened?

1281
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:46.580
Like if somebody threw an mad and a garbage can right there,
boom.

1282
01:13:46.670 --> 01:13:49.190
For the first couple of seconds you're like,
what the fuck is going on?

1283
01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:53.570
I really think that's human beings with the invention of the Internet.

1284
01:13:53.780 --> 01:13:57.380
I think we don't even understand that the the,
the bomb just went off.

1285
01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:00.380
We're just shaking our heads and we're going,

1286
01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:03.800
what the fuck is happening here and we're off.

1287
01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:08.390
This is the beginning of the weirdest connection that an organism has ever made.

1288
01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:12.190
The whole organism is going to become one mind like that really is going to

1289
01:14:12.191 --> 01:14:12.850
happen.
Yeah.

1290
01:14:12.850 --> 01:14:17.850
If you look at what does the trend really clearly is that individuals are going

1291
01:14:18.571 --> 01:14:20.590
to see sort of ceased to be individual.

1292
01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:23.800
The trend seems to be that we're getting close to each other.

1293
01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:25.540
We can communicate with each other better.

1294
01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:28.690
We can share information with each other better.
We could spy on each other.

1295
01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:30.190
We can get into each other's lives.

1296
01:14:30.191 --> 01:14:33.310
We can allow each other to know where each other is all day,

1297
01:14:33.311 --> 01:14:35.710
every day with a gps tracker on your phone.

1298
01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:40.120
We're gonna figure out a way to study everybody's email and study everybody's

1299
01:14:40.121 --> 01:14:43.480
phone calls.
Oh,
we already have it.
And the NSA is doing that right now.

1300
01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:44.440
Like what's going on?

1301
01:14:44.441 --> 01:14:48.400
We're getting closer and closer and closer to some sort of a weird connection

1302
01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:50.900
with each other and we're fucking putting our,
but it's in that,

1303
01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:54.310
<v 1>the access to it,
it's the access to it because they,</v>

1304
01:14:54.311 --> 01:14:57.170
the corporations have already got it.
You know,
they,

1305
01:14:57.171 --> 01:15:00.870
they've already cataloged and are taking every time you clicked.
There's,

1306
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:03.850
there's like five major private,
uh,

1307
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:07.210
information gatherers that are out there,

1308
01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:11.470
but we don't have access.
If you want to ask one of those companies,

1309
01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:15.160
I want to see my patterns of spending.
I want to see my patterns of shopping.

1310
01:15:15.161 --> 01:15:17.680
I want to see where I go.
They've got it.

1311
01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:21.240
<v 3>You can't get it.
Yeah.
Well that's,
that's,</v>

1312
01:15:21.241 --> 01:15:23.100
they get that from credit card information.

1313
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.320
I get all that and I get the idea

1314
01:15:26.490 --> 01:15:29.130
<v 1>Google and through the,
they give it all up,</v>

1315
01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:31.980
<v 3>but what I'm saying is that we're going to come a point,</v>

1316
01:15:32.010 --> 01:15:36.180
there's going to be a point in time where there is no Google,
there is not,

1317
01:15:36.181 --> 01:15:40.860
I mean there's going to be so much connection that you won't really be able to

1318
01:15:40.861 --> 01:15:44.400
have any money.
Like money right now is ones and Zeros.

1319
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:48.480
It's money is his numbers and it's on an account somewhere and numbers that are,

1320
01:15:48.481 --> 01:15:51.360
you know,
they're,
they're in banks.
I've got another amber alert.

1321
01:15:52.230 --> 01:15:53.700
No numbers are in banks.

1322
01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:57.600
Numbers are being traded back and forth on credit cards and they're going to,

1323
01:15:57.601 --> 01:16:01.200
you know,
you could paper notes account for some of it,
but it's all bullshit,

1324
01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:02.940
right?
A certain point in time,

1325
01:16:03.390 --> 01:16:08.390
money's going to be just information and if we have complete total access to

1326
01:16:08.461 --> 01:16:11.700
information right now,
which sort of what we're leaning towards,

1327
01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:13.920
they're going to hit a boundary.
We're going to say,
okay,

1328
01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:15.660
here's what we're going to have to figure out.

1329
01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:20.840
We can either press forward with civilization and abandoned money or we're going

1330
01:16:22.471 --> 01:16:25.680
to have to stick with money and we're going to have to stop innovation right

1331
01:16:25.681 --> 01:16:29.520
here because anything interesting,
any thought about that any further,

1332
01:16:29.521 --> 01:16:30.354
and we can't control this

1333
01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:34.520
<v 1>cause it's kind of a joke as it is you,
it's all,
it's a concept.</v>

1334
01:16:34.521 --> 01:16:39.110
We have credit,
we have credit cards,
we have student loans,

1335
01:16:39.111 --> 01:16:43.340
we have stocks that are going up in price that we don't even know what the fuck

1336
01:16:43.341 --> 01:16:45.630
they are.
It's a number and it,

1337
01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:48.560
it just ebbs and flows in either direction and the government.

1338
01:16:48.561 --> 01:16:53.561
And the corporation's goal is to just keep you a little bit behind and scared so

1339
01:16:54.141 --> 01:16:55.040
you keep working

1340
01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.920
<v 3>well there.
There,
there are organisms,</v>

1341
01:16:57.220 --> 01:17:00.040
corporations are organisms and they're trying to keep themselves alive.

1342
01:17:00.190 --> 01:17:04.090
And if they can spend money to influence laws to make sure they can keep moving,

1343
01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:08.500
they're going to keep moving.
But at a certain point,
time isn't money,

1344
01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:12.350
just information.
And if all information is free,

1345
01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:17.510
we're going to get to this weird sort of area where if it keeps traveling in the

1346
01:17:17.511 --> 01:17:21.380
area that it's,
it's going,
we're innovation and money come to a crosswords,

1347
01:17:21.710 --> 01:17:22.401
a crossroads.

1348
01:17:22.401 --> 01:17:26.270
We're going to be so advanced that we're going to have to think culturally

1349
01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:29.690
whether or not we have to develop some sort of a different reward system than

1350
01:17:29.691 --> 01:17:31.340
money instead of just thinking like,

1351
01:17:31.341 --> 01:17:33.220
this is what it is and this is how it's always been.

1352
01:17:33.221 --> 01:17:34.310
It sounds always going to be.

1353
01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:37.970
It doesn't mean that you shouldn't get reward systems for behavior reward

1354
01:17:37.971 --> 01:17:39.890
systems for putting an effort.

1355
01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:43.070
You should be able to get more things for your effort if you show,

1356
01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:45.890
like if we have freewill and a person can't tell you what to do,

1357
01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:50.410
you should be rewarded for putting in a lot of energy.
There's or not.

1358
01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:55.130
That's creative,
innovative energy or has also got to be task task,

1359
01:17:55.131 --> 01:17:59.510
uh,
responsibilities.
You know,
there's also responsibilities to your community,

1360
01:17:59.511 --> 01:18:02.540
responsibilities for you write your own waste and your own environment.

1361
01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:06.080
There's a lot of things that we were going to have to take into account carbon

1362
01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:08.990
footprint.
Yeah.
But at the end of the day,

1363
01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:13.070
we have this idea that is the way to do it because it's the way we've always

1364
01:18:13.071 --> 01:18:16.730
done it,
but it doesn't take into account possibility.
And there's,

1365
01:18:16.731 --> 01:18:20.660
there's other possibilities of a way that we could manage a bunch of organisms,

1366
01:18:20.661 --> 01:18:22.970
like humans,
human beings interacting with each other.

1367
01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:24.920
It doesn't have to be a fucking credit card.

1368
01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:26.510
So it's almost like we used to be paper,

1369
01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:30.860
so we would have sort of a digital identity that I'm just talking.

1370
01:18:31.730 --> 01:18:35.270
But what I'm saying is if I pay attention to what's happening with,

1371
01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:37.730
with information,
what's happening with technology,

1372
01:18:37.731 --> 01:18:41.040
if you try to like put it into,
if you weren't a person and you were some,

1373
01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:44.210
you know,
being from another planet and you're looking at what we're doing,
like,

1374
01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:45.320
oh,
they're building something.

1375
01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:48.210
They keep getting it better and better every year and they're building
something.

1376
01:18:48.220 --> 01:18:49.760
No,
I mean,
I didn't know what the fuck they're building.

1377
01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:51.110
They don't even know what they're building.

1378
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:53.750
They're just building something and along the line they're getting themselves

1379
01:18:53.751 --> 01:18:55.190
addicted to making new things.

1380
01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:59.900
Like why the fuck would you be so addicted to making new things?
This is laptop.

1381
01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:04.250
They could stay,
keep it like this forever and I don't need a new laptop,

1382
01:19:04.610 --> 01:19:06.200
this laptop.
Perfect.
Right now.

1383
01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:11.270
Why are we making new models like expected to make them every fucking year?

1384
01:19:11.690 --> 01:19:12.523
They have to.

1385
01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:16.790
They have do they have to develop programs that are so complex that utilize the

1386
01:19:16.791 --> 01:19:19.280
processors and these things just to make it,
it doesn't even make sense.

1387
01:19:19.281 --> 01:19:22.700
Why you have a three Gigahertz fucking laptop.
Like what do you,
what do you make?

1388
01:19:22.730 --> 01:19:23.690
What are you doing?
You probably,

1389
01:19:23.691 --> 01:19:26.780
unless you're crushing video and let's see me doing audio editing,

1390
01:19:26.781 --> 01:19:29.540
unless you're doing it a lot of like really heavy tasks where you don't need

1391
01:19:29.541 --> 01:19:29.760
that.

1392
01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:33.740
I need that sheer addicted and they got to make it smaller and smaller every

1393
01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:37.760
year.
Well,
I can carry that thing around easily.
Dude.
We're weird.

1394
01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:41.570
We're weird and we don't realize how weird we are.
Like while we're being weird,

1395
01:19:41.571 --> 01:19:43.490
we don't realize it will.
Well,
let's you know,

1396
01:19:43.491 --> 01:19:47.000
you gotta work on this life to make money.
What the fuck is money?
Who are you?

1397
01:19:47.001 --> 01:19:49.070
What is this?
What are we doing here?

1398
01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:53.750
We're in a giant factory that it just doesn't have,
it doesn't have real walls,

1399
01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:56.870
so we don't,
we forget that it's a factory,
but we're a part of this.

1400
01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:00.620
And if you look at the resources that you have available to you being 24 hours

1401
01:20:00.621 --> 01:20:02.300
in a day and a certain amount of your health,

1402
01:20:02.450 --> 01:20:05.210
I think about what you dedicate most of that resources too.

1403
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:07.560
And what's your reward on that?
What do you got house?

1404
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:10.560
You've got a box where you can fucking pass out every night in front of the

1405
01:20:10.561 --> 01:20:14.120
television.
Is that what you're doing?
You're a part of a fucking factory.

1406
01:20:14.130 --> 01:20:15.120
You're a part of a job

1407
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:16.350
<v 1>dog at night.</v>

1408
01:20:16.351 --> 01:20:20.460
And I look in people's windows and you just see that blue flipping thing and

1409
01:20:20.461 --> 01:20:24.390
people sitting want to dance like you work all fucking day.

1410
01:20:24.391 --> 01:20:25.440
Most people go to a job,

1411
01:20:25.441 --> 01:20:29.940
they do not like they sit in traffic and they have a miserable eight hours if

1412
01:20:29.941 --> 01:20:33.270
not 14 and then they come home after all that work.

1413
01:20:33.271 --> 01:20:37.100
And the payoff is to sit and watch an episode of modern family.

1414
01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:41.730
<v 3>And this is not taking anything away from people that find themselves in that</v>

1415
01:20:41.731 --> 01:20:44.880
position because Greg and I have both been there and it's not taking anything

1416
01:20:44.881 --> 01:20:47.430
away from people that actually enjoy their jobs.

1417
01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:50.340
There's nothing wrong with working if you enjoy your job,
right?

1418
01:20:50.410 --> 01:20:53.970
Like we're working right now.
How about that?
Just as our job,
right.

1419
01:20:53.971 --> 01:20:56.760
And kinda right.
Right,
right.
No,

1420
01:20:56.761 --> 01:20:59.940
I mean do doing podcasts or doing standup when you're doing standup,
your work,

1421
01:20:59.941 --> 01:21:01.530
when you're writing your work,
when you're fucking around,

1422
01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:04.710
joking around and you come up with ideas that's worked for you.
Right.

1423
01:21:04.770 --> 01:21:08.110
But it doesn't feel like work because it's awesome cause it's so fun.
Yeah.

1424
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.140
There's nothing wrong with finding a way to make Mongolian bows and selling them

1425
01:21:13.141 --> 01:21:14.700
online.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1426
01:21:15.090 --> 01:21:18.990
But if you have a problem with what you're doing and you continue to do it,

1427
01:21:18.991 --> 01:21:22.440
you're going to be miserable.
Right?
Doesn't mean that you,
you know,

1428
01:21:22.450 --> 01:21:26.130
you have to do one thing or have to find out what you don't like and don't do

1429
01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:30.450
that first.
Find out what you do like.
And I bet there's more than one option,
man.

1430
01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:34.350
You might funnel your options in one direction because you think it's your best

1431
01:21:34.351 --> 01:21:37.650
chance at success.
But most people that enjoy anything,

1432
01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:41.250
they have a pretty nuanced view of the world.
Like you,
I know you like,

1433
01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:44.430
you like to play golf,
you like to play pool,
you like to write,

1434
01:21:44.431 --> 01:21:46.770
you like to produce shows you like do standup comedy,

1435
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:50.190
you like a lot of different things and you do a lot of different things.

1436
01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:54.690
And if one of those different things opened up some strange path and you decided

1437
01:21:54.691 --> 01:21:58.950
to go down it and,
and,
and form this excellent career,
what,
what does it,

1438
01:21:58.951 --> 01:22:03.450
is it by chance?
Is it because you have more than one option?

1439
01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:06.510
Is it because one thing resonates with you more than it's cause you have
options.

1440
01:22:06.511 --> 01:22:07.740
You could do whatever the fuck you want.

1441
01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:11.600
<v 1>Yeah.
It's a combination of options and abilities.
Yeah.
Well option.</v>

1442
01:22:11.610 --> 01:22:16.220
If we have the abilities then you feel more excited about this thing.
Yeah,

1443
01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:18.990
so I think,
and also I was thinking about this the other day,

1444
01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:23.040
I can't wait to change jobs.
I don't know what the next thing is,

1445
01:22:23.041 --> 01:22:26.670
but I know that I'm going to follow it.
I mean podcasting,
I started out,

1446
01:22:26.671 --> 01:22:31.290
it was a fucking lark that I started doing podcasting us and now I look at it

1447
01:22:31.291 --> 01:22:32.130
like,
man,

1448
01:22:32.131 --> 01:22:36.470
I get a fucking excited every day thinking about what the next podcast is going

1449
01:22:36.471 --> 01:22:39.470
to be,
what guests they got coming up and you know,

1450
01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.280
something happens in my life and I'm like,
oh,

1451
01:22:41.281 --> 01:22:45.390
this is a great fucking narrative piece I can bring onto the podcast and I'm

1452
01:22:45.391 --> 01:22:49.110
going to have more understanding of a by the end of the podcast because I'm not,

1453
01:22:49.111 --> 01:22:51.720
I'm going to think about it in a concentrated way for like,

1454
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:55.510
I don't know what the next thing is,
but there's going to be a next thing and,

1455
01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:58.230
and you just got to say,
I'm going to go with it.
Whatever it is.

1456
01:22:58.510 --> 01:23:01.980
<v 3>Yeah.
Well it's,
you also don't have to stop doing standup,</v>

1457
01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:06.310
which with you and I is always been the main behind the machine.

1458
01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:10.300
<v 0>Right.
Even when you took time off of doing stand up,
you were still stand up.</v>

1459
01:23:10.301 --> 01:23:13.980
Never.
I never took time off.
I mean,
if you've never taken a week off,
I would say.

1460
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:17.410
Yeah.
Yeah.
What's the longest you've ever been offstage?
Probably a month,

1461
01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:21.550
which is rare.
I did three months once.
Did you decide when he came back?

1462
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:26.480
I got injured.
I forget what it was.
The injury was a motor.
It was no nose.

1463
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:28.240
When he carved out your nose mean no,
no,

1464
01:23:28.241 --> 01:23:30.760
I didn't take that much time off then I was on stage like,
uh,

1465
01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:33.610
I think like two weeks after that hair worried.

1466
01:23:33.730 --> 01:23:35.740
Worried that it was gonna not hair plugs with real quick.

1467
01:23:38.410 --> 01:23:39.940
The uh,
the bleeding out of the nose.

1468
01:23:39.941 --> 01:23:42.370
I was worried that people are gonna think it was a coke head.
Right,
right.

1469
01:23:42.450 --> 01:23:43.450
W I really,
I was,

1470
01:23:43.570 --> 01:23:46.990
that was my number one thing that I didn't want to have to explain.
Yeah.

1471
01:23:46.991 --> 01:23:51.460
I got my nose fixed and then I wasn't actually a cokehead please like classic,

1472
01:23:51.461 --> 01:23:53.770
like you're falling apart Hollywood moment.

1473
01:23:53.771 --> 01:23:57.460
You're bleeding out of your nose on stage.
And then if you're bombing as well,

1474
01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:00.520
like what was that blood?
Oh Shit.
And then your,
your act goes into the toilet.

1475
01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:05.440
Can I?
Yeah.
Can I plug my standup dates?
A punchline?
San Francisco,

1476
01:24:05.530 --> 01:24:07.270
March 12th through the 15th.

1477
01:24:07.930 --> 01:24:11.950
And the 16th I will be with the Great Joe Rogan at the Hollywood improv.

1478
01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:17.110
It's the night before Saint Patrick's Day.
We're going to do some fucking jokes.

1479
01:24:17.111 --> 01:24:20.350
We're going to talk about the rage and the violence and the pride that comes

1480
01:24:20.351 --> 01:24:24.510
with the Irish people.
Oh,
hey.
And then I got a bunch of dates.
I'm gone.

1481
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:28.490
I don't know,
go to [inaudible] dot com like Denver,
Fort Lauderdale,

1482
01:24:28.491 --> 01:24:32.170
a bunch of places,
good times my friend.
It's the best times.

1483
01:24:32.171 --> 01:24:35.970
And it's hard because with kids,
you know how it is.
You fucking,
it's bittersweet.

1484
01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:38.860
You walk out that door and it's like,
I'm going to miss you.

1485
01:24:38.861 --> 01:24:43.160
And it's also like I'm going to be alone in a hotel room in the gates.

1486
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:48.100
Yeah.
That's not a bad thing.
Well,
it's,
it's good to have a little breaks,

1487
01:24:48.370 --> 01:24:50.990
you know,
and there's a recharge.
Right.
But,
um,

1488
01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:55.360
I definitely like doing more gigs near home then I used to,

1489
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:59.620
I'd like to travel less,
you know,
like going to Irvine and places like that.
Yeah,

1490
01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:03.310
yeah.
Irvine's great.
You know,
like going Ontario,
it's fun Ice House,

1491
01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:06.790
Ice House to do all the time.
I like going to a comedy magic club.

1492
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:07.623
I'm there on the third.

1493
01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:12.310
I'm you want a lot of Jay Leno spots cause Jay Leno does every Sunday night

1494
01:25:12.330 --> 01:25:14.140
right to her most a beach comedy and magic club.

1495
01:25:14.141 --> 01:25:17.770
Well he's now going to start going on the road.
So Mike,
the Sunday night,

1496
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:20.470
Mike is gonna,
you know,
start handing them out to a bunch of different people.

1497
01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:22.390
So I've done two of them so far.

1498
01:25:22.510 --> 01:25:25.990
I did one and then I'm doing another one on the 30th comedy and Magic Club is a

1499
01:25:25.991 --> 01:25:27.480
fucking gem of a club man.
Dude.

1500
01:25:27.490 --> 01:25:29.620
I'll come down and do a guest spot next time you're there.

1501
01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:34.530
We'll set love that place.
Yeah,
you want to work with me?
It was all right.

1502
01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:38.590
There you go with gentlemen that we did it Sunday the 30th March 30th Greg

1503
01:25:38.591 --> 01:25:41.620
Fitzsimmons and I,
we're going to have some fun.
That'll place is beautiful.

1504
01:25:42.010 --> 01:25:45.190
It's beautiful setup.
It's,
it's,
it's so good.
It's so good.

1505
01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:48.790
It's such a good club and it's got such a great air in it because Mike is like

1506
01:25:48.791 --> 01:25:51.070
the nicest person that's ever walked the face of the earth.

1507
01:25:51.370 --> 01:25:55.150
It's like the whole staff is like friendly and Nice trickles down from him.

1508
01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:59.290
Cores,
the like,
that's like the nicest,
most laid back staff ever.
Right?

1509
01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:02.470
Imagine that guy.
He's your boss.
He's just the sweetest of sweetie pies ever.

1510
01:26:02.650 --> 01:26:05.810
I don't trust him.
He made me learn that Nice.
I'm always like,

1511
01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:09.200
I'm gonna see some angry dude pop out.
But it never happened.

1512
01:26:09.710 --> 01:26:12.010
You made me cry once.
Yeah.
Why?

1513
01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:15.680
Who's telling Brian that he's going to die of cancer and that he cares about?

1514
01:26:15.690 --> 01:26:19.240
Yeah,
because Brian smokes and he telling him,
he's like,
I,

1515
01:26:19.370 --> 01:26:23.780
my wife works with people that are dying of lung cancer.
Death is horrible.

1516
01:26:23.781 --> 01:26:26.870
They have to strap you in and you literally drowning in your own fluid that

1517
01:26:26.871 --> 01:26:28.380
fills your lungs up.
Uh,

1518
01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:31.790
it's unbelievably horrible and it's avoidable and it's avoidable.

1519
01:26:31.791 --> 01:26:34.070
You caused it and that's the other thing is like,

1520
01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:36.860
you're not going to get as much sympathy if you die of that.

1521
01:26:36.861 --> 01:26:40.130
People are going to be like,
well,
it's a good lesson for us.

1522
01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.020
This is illegal for me to smoke this in here,
by the way.

1523
01:26:42.021 --> 01:26:44.640
Now did you know that you're a fucking criminal?
What is it called?

1524
01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:47.660
Trump cigarette inside of it.
Your work deal on those.

1525
01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:52.040
I'm totally uneducated about that.
Is it bad for you or good for you?
Well,

1526
01:26:52.041 --> 01:26:55.040
it's not nearly as bad for you as cigarettes.
That's a fact.

1527
01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:58.700
But the issue is should you be able to do it in public?

1528
01:26:58.701 --> 01:27:01.100
And they just passed a law in la that says you can't do it in public,

1529
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:05.030
but it's ridiculous because you can just do it and no one even knows you're

1530
01:27:05.031 --> 01:27:07.760
doing it.
Like it doesn't smell like anything like that.
You don't need to smoke.

1531
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:09.620
Yeah,
but it's vapor.
It's not really smoking.
You know,

1532
01:27:09.621 --> 01:27:11.870
like one of those blue cigarettes when you buy those things,

1533
01:27:11.871 --> 01:27:14.480
like you'd have that commercial with Jenny Mccarthy and she's like,
you know,

1534
01:27:14.481 --> 01:27:18.080
be being sexy and selling blue cigarettes second east six years.
Yeah,

1535
01:27:18.081 --> 01:27:20.760
you can just get a jolt of nicotine,
but it's the most,

1536
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:23.030
their secondhand smoke though.
None.
Zero.

1537
01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:25.730
So I can inhale his nicotine or you went into hell,
Shit.

1538
01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:28.050
You're just getting vapor.
That's all it is.
It's,

1539
01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:32.240
it's like they're like little electronic vaporizers.
I cook.
You don't smell that.

1540
01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:34.460
See that one's a little different Brian.
I got to tell you,

1541
01:27:34.461 --> 01:27:38.240
cause that looks a lot like more like smoking.
It lingers in the air.
Okay.

1542
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:42.110
Whatever that is.
We're breathing it.
And so we're getting some nicotine.
Yeah,

1543
01:27:42.111 --> 01:27:46.730
I dunno.
We're getting something.
It's vapors.
Okay,
but hold on,

1544
01:27:46.731 --> 01:27:49.220
let's not talk shit.
It would know who's measured that stuff.

1545
01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:52.220
I'm saying that there's actually no tests that they don't really k now I'm

1546
01:27:52.221 --> 01:27:54.710
smelling it,
man.
I'm,
maybe I might be on to this law.
I might,

1547
01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:58.950
I might be down with this law is nick.
Wait a minute.
You're blowing.

1548
01:27:59.190 --> 01:28:02.720
You shouldn't be allowed to do that legal.
And they smell it like shit.

1549
01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:05.030
We already talked about that.
The other podcast cans till my choke.

1550
01:28:05.031 --> 01:28:09.710
You son of a bitch and you butchered it.
Yeah,
you butchered it.
But it's nicotine.

1551
01:28:09.711 --> 01:28:14.180
Not Bad for you.
Uh,
nicotine is not good for you,
but it's not.

1552
01:28:14.181 --> 01:28:16.070
It's really the tar from smoking.

1553
01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:20.620
Nicotine can be good for you in certain situations and it's a good,
uh,

1554
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:21.800
cognitive enhancer.

1555
01:28:21.801 --> 01:28:25.040
And it actually can give you like a little boost cognitively and write like a

1556
01:28:25.041 --> 01:28:28.540
little speed,
you know,
it's like an accelerant.
So I see crazy people smoking.

1557
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:30.770
Well,
people who are very creative,

1558
01:28:30.771 --> 01:28:34.700
like a lot of writers love right cigarettes and they get it from the smoking.

1559
01:28:34.701 --> 01:28:36.710
You get like a little burst of creativity,
right?

1560
01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:39.190
There's a lot of people that believe that.
Um,
but the,

1561
01:28:39.191 --> 01:28:43.310
the bottom line is there's 500 and something chemicals in a cigarette.

1562
01:28:43.311 --> 01:28:46.430
It's not just nicotine.
Like if you just smoked a cigar,

1563
01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:48.620
I guarantee you it's going to be healthier.

1564
01:28:48.650 --> 01:28:52.640
It's probably not healthy when they put these chemicals into this cigarette to,

1565
01:28:52.641 --> 01:28:53.930
in order to make you more addicted.

1566
01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:58.490
There's a documentary or a movie on it called a the,
uh,

1567
01:28:58.491 --> 01:29:02.190
the inside is an insider.
Yeah.
Where he's a

1568
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:04.950
<v 7>chemist and he's talking about all the different things that are done to</v>

1569
01:29:04.951 --> 01:29:07.230
cigarettes to make them more addictive and how they act.

1570
01:29:07.231 --> 01:29:11.340
And it's a fucking terrifying scene because it's just a movie.

1571
01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:13.680
But this shit isn't fiction,
man.
Okay.

1572
01:29:13.770 --> 01:29:16.530
This is a recreation of a real case.

1573
01:29:16.650 --> 01:29:21.650
And so when he's describing the effects of nicotine and the added that they put

1574
01:29:21.811 --> 01:29:23.280
in their 500 plus whatever they are,

1575
01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:27.560
when he's describing that he has to be accurate because this is a movie that's

1576
01:29:27.561 --> 01:29:30.720
shitting on one of the biggest companies,

1577
01:29:30.930 --> 01:29:34.410
corporations on earth,
tobacco,
corporations,

1578
01:29:34.530 --> 01:29:39.510
tobacco corporations make untold trillions of dollars every year.
Worldwide.

1579
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:42.300
You're dealing with one of the biggest monsters ever.

1580
01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:44.210
<v 1>And they're not just tobacco.
They,</v>

1581
01:29:44.350 --> 01:29:48.750
they diversify and they get into buying food groups.
And so you can't,
yeah.

1582
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.960
<v 7>This think of how much money they have.
When you make a movie shitting on them,</v>

1583
01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:56.290
you gotta be,
you gotta Cross your fucking t's.
Dot Your I's.

1584
01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:59.650
So you know that what you're hearing is accurate.
All right?

1585
01:29:59.710 --> 01:30:03.850
You know that what you hearing,
although incredibly terrifying,
is fucking legit.

1586
01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:08.440
Secondhand vapor from e-cigarettes contains nicotine but not other toxins.

1587
01:30:08.530 --> 01:30:12.610
Well that's not cool if it contains nicotine,
you can't be blowing that out.

1588
01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:16.930
You shouldn't be able to affect people with your shit.
Yeah.

1589
01:30:17.110 --> 01:30:18.790
You shouldn't be able to.
So I agree with it.

1590
01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:20.290
And you didn't know why I agree with it.

1591
01:30:20.291 --> 01:30:21.790
Cause you greedy bitches with your fucking wheels

1592
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:24.870
<v 1>barrel's full.
You got a God damn oil can over there that you're,</v>

1593
01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:28.910
you're sucking on.
Yeah,
look at the size of that thing.
Come on.

1594
01:30:28.911 --> 01:30:31.940
That's like a Horse Dick.
But if people didn't use to smoke cigarettes,

1595
01:30:31.941 --> 01:30:34.970
now suddenly they're,
they're doing this vapor stuff right.

1596
01:30:34.971 --> 01:30:37.070
There seems to be like a real attraction.

1597
01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:39.920
And then I heard that they were there trying to market it to kids.

1598
01:30:39.921 --> 01:30:44.390
There's like a watermelon bubblegum flavor.
This is cotton candy.

1599
01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:47.420
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I've been saying this forever.

1600
01:30:47.450 --> 01:30:50.960
The only reason I'm still smoking this now is because it is a lot healthier than

1601
01:30:50.961 --> 01:30:55.370
smoking a cigarette.
Well,
I mean I would imagine so.

1602
01:30:55.371 --> 01:31:00.180
I would want you to know that.
Why wouldn't you just,
well
this is just,

1603
01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:02.840
are you imagining,
so you're just sitting back imagining?

1604
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:04.250
Well I thought your help everybody.

1605
01:31:04.330 --> 01:31:07.610
I think everybody agrees that this is healthier than a cigarette though.

1606
01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:09.560
<v 7>I don't know if everybody agrees on that,
Brian.</v>

1607
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:13.880
I think that it's probably healthier than a cigarette,
but I'm an idiot.
I don't,

1608
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:17.780
I don't even understand how the body works.
I don't understand what the fright,

1609
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.860
I don't understand anything.

1610
01:31:19.310 --> 01:31:22.760
A lot of complex functions going on right now in my body that are critical that

1611
01:31:22.761 --> 01:31:27.170
I have no knowledge of.
Yeah.
You know,
that's,
that's what I know about me.

1612
01:31:27.171 --> 01:31:30.740
I don't know shit.
So when I talked to you,
I know,
you know less than me,
I'm like,

1613
01:31:30.741 --> 01:31:34.610
well,
you're fucked.
You're fucked.
Fuck more than I'm fucked.
I'm fucked.

1614
01:31:34.810 --> 01:31:36.730
<v 1>Yeah.
You're,
you're,
you're,
we're all fucked.</v>

1615
01:31:36.731 --> 01:31:39.910
And everything they find out in these studies seems to reverse itself after a

1616
01:31:39.911 --> 01:31:43.870
while anyway.
So the rules should probably be put less shit in your body.

1617
01:31:44.230 --> 01:31:46.390
I don't drink anything except for water and coffee.

1618
01:31:46.970 --> 01:31:51.560
<v 7>That is the thing.
But there's also that the body adapts and the body changes.</v>

1619
01:31:51.710 --> 01:31:55.700
So we were dealing with a body that's dealing with this current environment.

1620
01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:58.880
But if our environment starts to show changes,

1621
01:31:58.881 --> 01:32:01.630
we're going to show expressions of those changes in the genetics,

1622
01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:05.490
which is really fucking weird.
You know,
there's a doc,
a,
um,
uh,

1623
01:32:05.491 --> 01:32:10.491
a piece that was done recently on Melanin and skin and people getting a darker

1624
01:32:11.141 --> 01:32:14.050
in dark climates like Africa to avoid skin cancer,

1625
01:32:14.051 --> 01:32:17.320
that it was a natural selection issue to deal with the radiation,

1626
01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:19.750
that there was an extreme amount of radiation coming down at them.

1627
01:32:19.751 --> 01:32:22.300
So there's an extreme solution by nature of that turned out to be the most

1628
01:32:22.301 --> 01:32:23.134
successful thing.

1629
01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:26.500
So it's not that all people started black and then became white.

1630
01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:30.760
It's that people were growing up all over the planet and wildly different

1631
01:32:30.761 --> 01:32:34.150
climates and as they were evolving in these wildly different climates,

1632
01:32:34.151 --> 01:32:35.230
different things happen to them.

1633
01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:38.530
They might have all had an original source monkey or whatever the fuck we were

1634
01:32:38.531 --> 01:32:41.920
back then hominid but as we spread out,
until he's different,
we just,

1635
01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:43.780
we just adapt it to our environment.

1636
01:32:44.290 --> 01:32:47.350
This is why reason why Chinese people have like really skinny eyes.

1637
01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:48.220
I don't know what it is,

1638
01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:52.060
but whatever the reason is why they like to develop that,

1639
01:32:52.210 --> 01:32:54.400
that thin slit where you're,
you know,

1640
01:32:54.401 --> 01:32:58.600
you don't have like this big wide eye and to develop like a less hairy body,

1641
01:32:58.601 --> 01:33:02.010
whatever those reasons are.
I don't know what they are,
but that had

1642
01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:07.030
<v 1>thank God for them.
Well,
I'd had what I mean when I look at an Asian woman,</v>

1643
01:33:07.031 --> 01:33:10.390
like every one of those attributes,
the little,
the little slitty eyes,

1644
01:33:10.391 --> 01:33:11.224
so she can't,

1645
01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:15.010
she can't see that I have no hair because she can only see the middle part of my

1646
01:33:15.011 --> 01:33:19.570
face and she's got no hair.
So that,
that's,
that's really nice.

1647
01:33:19.870 --> 01:33:20.740
Beautiful Feet.

1648
01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:22.800
<v 7>A lot of them do.
But there's,</v>

1649
01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:26.200
there's some those women that give their feet bound.
That's an Asian thing too,

1650
01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:28.550
<v 1>but that's how they got so nice.
They were,</v>

1651
01:33:28.670 --> 01:33:31.520
they were bred to have little tiny sweet feet.
They're not,

1652
01:33:31.850 --> 01:33:36.170
they're not like big American women feet with the fucking Bunyan and like,

1653
01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:41.360
and there's like one toe that's longer than the other one doesn't bother me.
No,

1654
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:46.410
<v 7>it doesn't bother me at all.
But the crooked toes bother me.
Yeah.
It shouldn't,</v>

1655
01:33:47.130 --> 01:33:50.140
shouldn't really care.
I'm all broken up.
Why would I get yours?

1656
01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:53.790
Must be all fucked down.
Oh,
they're fine.
I'm kicking people.
That's weird.
Yeah.

1657
01:33:53.791 --> 01:33:58.200
I don't have any,
anything,
uh,
feet,
smell go.
Oh well,
definitely.
Who's don't?

1658
01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:00.750
If you have your feet don't smell,
it means you're not working.

1659
01:34:01.290 --> 01:34:02.100
You're not getting anything done.

1660
01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:03.930
<v 1>I feel like mine smell bad.</v>

1661
01:34:04.290 --> 01:34:07.650
I just foot spray everything and it still comes back to the next,

1662
01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:11.370
maybe it's a health issue.
Yeah.
Maybe you should wear sandals thing,
man.
Well,

1663
01:34:11.371 --> 01:34:12.660
you know when you're on your feet or

1664
01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:15.790
<v 7>it's just sitting in these like polyester cotton socks.
Right.</v>

1665
01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:19.240
And you're sweating and so I'll just brewing funk in there.
I mean,

1666
01:34:19.241 --> 01:34:23.560
when you have a plastic sock.
Okay.
That's what a nylon sockets.
Plastic socks on.

1667
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:26.640
Is it?
Does anybody wear nylon socks?
I guess they do.
Right?
They're kind of nylon,

1668
01:34:26.710 --> 01:34:31.030
right?
Yeah.
Ray on whatever fuck socks made out of.
It's not made out of wool.

1669
01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:32.710
Okay.
And anything other than wool.

1670
01:34:32.830 --> 01:34:35.890
It's not going to accept all that moisture and dry it up very well.

1671
01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:38.170
So things that get soupy in there and like,

1672
01:34:38.171 --> 01:34:39.950
especially if they're like plastic cottons.

1673
01:34:39.970 --> 01:34:44.140
Pretty good about your actual fibers go.

1674
01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:46.150
Those things are exact.
A Mundo

1675
01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:48.510
<v 1>your balls smell Brian?
Uh,</v>

1676
01:34:48.511 --> 01:34:51.270
no but I take like two showers a day but I was thinking they should have like

1677
01:34:51.271 --> 01:34:54.570
ball hats.
You know like where you put your balls and like a little little sock.

1678
01:34:54.750 --> 01:34:56.970
Wouldn't that make call underwear dude?
Yeah,
anywhere.

1679
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:59.990
It doesn't like fuck he talking about wet and like

1680
01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:05.240
they're like smaller than pants and you put them on there like shorter than

1681
01:35:05.241 --> 01:35:07.610
shorts.
Wait a minute,
wait,
I feel you on this.

1682
01:35:08.210 --> 01:35:13.160
What would you call him Greg there under your clothes.
Under the ball.
Socks,

1683
01:35:13.370 --> 01:35:15.290
socks and then they have like an opening.

1684
01:35:15.291 --> 01:35:18.620
What if there was like an opening you can open for your penis to come out of

1685
01:35:18.621 --> 01:35:22.040
like it's there technically,
but the flap is so big

1686
01:35:22.090 --> 01:35:25.900
<v 7>that you actually can't.
I'm,
I'm down dude,
let's invest money.</v>

1687
01:35:26.540 --> 01:35:30.940
That's an interesting thing that certain parts of nature we can't recreate.

1688
01:35:30.970 --> 01:35:33.910
Like wool.
Wool is like one of the best things.

1689
01:35:33.911 --> 01:35:38.170
If you ever outside in the cold and you have clothes on and you sweat and you

1690
01:35:38.171 --> 01:35:41.890
dry off.
When you're wearing wool,
it wicks the water away from your body.

1691
01:35:41.891 --> 01:35:45.610
You don't get cold.
It's amazing water from coming in.
Yeah.

1692
01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:50.640
The difference between wool socks and we'll like a under garments and cotton is

1693
01:35:51.281 --> 01:35:52.770
astounding.
You wear cotton,

1694
01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:56.770
you get sweaty and then shit gets wet and then it sits you and you freeze your

1695
01:35:56.771 --> 01:35:59.110
fucking Dick off.
It's the worst in the world.

1696
01:35:59.111 --> 01:36:01.920
If you hike somewhere and then you sit down like you know,

1697
01:36:01.921 --> 01:36:03.430
like you're hurt yourself maybe and you sit down,

1698
01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:07.330
you will get so fucking cold and he would get so cold if you were in cotton

1699
01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:10.300
because it's all wet.
But not wool.
Wool is amazing.

1700
01:36:10.301 --> 01:36:13.990
We can't figure out a way to recreate that.
What of it and silk,
same thing.

1701
01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:18.730
Silk has that property.
I have worms.
Yeah.
So because of that property as well.
Um,

1702
01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:22.570
silk actually keeps you warmer then.
Uh,

1703
01:36:22.630 --> 01:36:27.430
most other materials,
even though it's thin.
Well it's very like tight knit,
right?

1704
01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:29.650
You know,
it can retain your heat very well.

1705
01:36:29.651 --> 01:36:32.800
And it's like a wet suit or something like that.
Do you wear wool socks?
Yeah.

1706
01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:36.650
Time.
Especially when I go out and cold places are always wear wool socks.

1707
01:36:36.700 --> 01:36:40.390
Oh Shit.
Yeah.
She probably a wool underwear too then.
I'm worried they might come.

1708
01:36:40.391 --> 01:36:44.080
Colony might fester near my asshole.
It doesn't start conference.

1709
01:36:44.081 --> 01:36:47.680
There was a video where a guy um,
was that Nag or this weekend and uh,

1710
01:36:47.681 --> 01:36:50.430
they were doing Naca is the North American grapping association.

1711
01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:55.330
They were doing a match and they were in the middle of it and the guy farted and

1712
01:36:55.331 --> 01:36:56.500
the other guy threw up,

1713
01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:04.690
<v 1>tapped out and he threw up,
pull the video brand.
Cause it's online.</v>

1714
01:37:07.170 --> 01:37:11.380
It's,
it's uh,
how does that get ruled?
Cause if that all the taps,
two taps

1715
01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:17.860
shower so that they have [inaudible] pits,
right.
Writing might be the next,

1716
01:37:18.150 --> 01:37:21.570
<v 7>here it is.
The guy is a Kaizen guard.
Try to pass guard.</v>

1717
01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:25.500
And the guy on the bottom look,
he starts tapping,
tapping and then he throws up.

1718
01:37:25.501 --> 01:37:30.180
But he really did throw up man.
I mean look,
the guy,

1719
01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:33.270
it was tapping for no reason first of all.
And then he threw up.

1720
01:37:34.350 --> 01:37:36.850
Let me see this one more time.
Let me see.

1721
01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:39.050
Here's my problem with the black guy farted.

1722
01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:43.440
I'm looking at the technique that the guys technique it less he gave up right

1723
01:37:43.441 --> 01:37:45.030
away.
Go all the way back to the beginning.

1724
01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:48.030
I'm interested in what's going on here.
Cause the guy in the bottom is,

1725
01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:51.480
is this like blue belts?
These guys will see blue belts

1726
01:37:53.370 --> 01:37:57.780
cause there's a lot of space here.
So that way the guy in the white farther.
Yeah,

1727
01:37:57.781 --> 01:38:00.870
the guy in the white fart in the book and the Black Dude's face.

1728
01:38:01.260 --> 01:38:03.570
And then he said he just had the majors far in my face,

1729
01:38:03.690 --> 01:38:08.460
but he really did throw up,
man.
He really did throw up and the guy's like,

1730
01:38:08.461 --> 01:38:12.030
I'm sorry.
Hey Man,
I'm sorry I fart in your face.
You hear people laughing.
Yeah.

1731
01:38:12.031 --> 01:38:13.980
Well look,
it's,
it happens in class all the time,

1732
01:38:14.170 --> 01:38:16.320
but I mean people fall in your face all the time.

1733
01:38:16.321 --> 01:38:18.750
So don't you think people for matches are going to start eating?

1734
01:38:18.751 --> 01:38:21.660
Fucking let the be have they always have really good people.

1735
01:38:21.661 --> 01:38:25.230
People have gone into matches,
like especially,
uh,
key guys.

1736
01:38:25.410 --> 01:38:29.910
They'll not wash their geek for like fucking days as smell like death and just

1737
01:38:29.911 --> 01:38:31.260
smell like a rotten animal.

1738
01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:33.900
And you've got this covering your body and you're smothering people with his

1739
01:38:33.901 --> 01:38:36.570
rotten animal.
Like if you mount a guy and you,
you,
you know,

1740
01:38:36.571 --> 01:38:37.710
like if you're an a match,

1741
01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:41.670
you could press your geeky up against the guy's face and they can't get away

1742
01:38:41.671 --> 01:38:42.030
from it.

1743
01:38:42.030 --> 01:38:45.900
So you're putting the stinkiest millions rag and he's just thinking about all

1744
01:38:45.901 --> 01:38:50.430
the ringworm he's getting right now.
All this strap infection,
it's so nasty,

1745
01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:52.890
right?
There's dudes that like we've had to yell at like,
man,

1746
01:38:52.891 --> 01:38:54.210
you've got to wash your fucking shit.

1747
01:38:54.270 --> 01:38:57.540
You can't come in here smelling like that because it's also how bacteria gets

1748
01:38:57.541 --> 01:39:00.780
bread and it's how people start getting things like ringworm and things along

1749
01:39:00.781 --> 01:39:02.610
those lines.
A lot of times it's people,

1750
01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:05.250
they'll develop colonies and they're fucking clothes.

1751
01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:07.890
I mean that's the reason your clothes smell bad.

1752
01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:12.150
It's gotten pneumonia or ammonia rather from your body,
from all your sweat,

1753
01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:14.440
all your stinky sweat,
fermenting,
right?

1754
01:39:14.490 --> 01:39:17.460
And sit in the trunk of your car and then you're pulling it out and wearing it

1755
01:39:17.461 --> 01:39:20.160
and shoved it in someone's face.
It's fucking gross.

1756
01:39:20.370 --> 01:39:22.350
<v 1>Yeah.
When I played hockey,
everybody,</v>

1757
01:39:22.351 --> 01:39:25.550
nobody washed their fucking gear and it's all like a,
you know,

1758
01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:29.820
the pads are all absorbing sweat guys to go whole fucking season and not only is

1759
01:39:29.821 --> 01:39:33.750
a sweat and then you stick it in a bag and zip it until the next practice.

1760
01:39:33.850 --> 01:39:38.350
<v 7>I know it go.
Got a staph infection from Thai pads,
like the leather pants,</v>

1761
01:39:38.351 --> 01:39:41.620
like there were so dirty.
This guy's kicking the leather paths.

1762
01:39:41.621 --> 01:39:44.950
He gets this horrible infection all over his shins.
Yeah.

1763
01:39:45.010 --> 01:39:48.290
<v 1>My uh,
my friend just went to Israel and you know,
a lot of the,
uh,</v>

1764
01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:53.320
Orthodox Jews don't really shower very much and apparently you shouldn't fly.

1765
01:39:53.530 --> 01:39:57.860
I think it's ll and I should be careful what I'm saying because this,

1766
01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:02.440
this could really get the,
this is a Jewish,

1767
01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:06.880
a Jewish family.
My friends married to a Jewish woman and her family said,
no,

1768
01:40:06.881 --> 01:40:09.310
you don't fly El Al because it's got a lot of the,

1769
01:40:09.311 --> 01:40:12.850
I don't know if it's acidic or I think it gets it's Hasidic Jews and the plane

1770
01:40:12.851 --> 01:40:13.480
you could say,

1771
01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:18.480
can you imagine sitting next to somebody for 10 hours that has that rank sours?

1772
01:40:20.210 --> 01:40:24.560
<v 7>No,
I can't.
I couldn't.
I mean it busts happen all the time though.
Right.</v>

1773
01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:29.910
<v 1>So I guess there's other airlines that fly though.
There's not as concentrated</v>

1774
01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:32.690
<v 7>too.
God Damn.
What did,</v>

1775
01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:36.570
what kind of a wacky religion would tell you to just smells horrible as you can

1776
01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:38.860
just let yourself just funk of fines,

1777
01:40:38.910 --> 01:40:43.030
your balls and cheesy and we know that you're supposed to be clean.
You right,

1778
01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:44.460
right.
You know what they say though?

1779
01:40:44.490 --> 01:40:48.300
They say you're actually probably better off washing yourself with no soap.

1780
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:53.740
Just washing off all the dirt and all this stuff and like letting the funk a

1781
01:40:53.741 --> 01:40:54.574
little bit

1782
01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:57.790
<v 2>just grow on you and they're like,
you'll develop,
like if you're eating healthy,</v>

1783
01:40:58.090 --> 01:41:02.080
you're develop some sort of a healthy skin flora.
Yeah.

1784
01:41:02.170 --> 01:41:05.470
But the problem that I have with that is,
man,
you're going to look,

1785
01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:09.610
you can be gross.
Like if you wash yourself,

1786
01:41:09.970 --> 01:41:11.820
you're still like you're,
you're,

1787
01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:15.730
you're scrubbing off a lot of the bad stuff and you smell better and you can

1788
01:41:15.731 --> 01:41:18.970
interact with people better.
That's got to count for something.
It does.

1789
01:41:18.971 --> 01:41:23.440
Bill Gates apparently was disgusting.
It was like,
no,
seriously,

1790
01:41:23.441 --> 01:41:26.560
like I read,
I read his biography and nobody wanted to work with them.

1791
01:41:26.561 --> 01:41:30.020
Nobody could stand next to him.
It was,
he was like a real hippie and he,

1792
01:41:30.021 --> 01:41:32.980
he didn't wear shoes and he just,
uh,
you know,

1793
01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:37.390
he had long hair when he was younger and he was just like this disgusting Gross

1794
01:41:37.391 --> 01:41:41.530
Hippie Steve Jobs.
You mean?
What did I say?
No,
you said Bill Gates.
Oh,

1795
01:41:41.531 --> 01:41:45.820
fuck did you mean Steve Jobs?
I met Steve Jobs.
There are different guy.
Fuck,

1796
01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:49.000
that goes to Bill Gates.
Guy's still alive.
He's still getting his feet.

1797
01:41:49.001 --> 01:41:52.210
And then I like the toilet or something.
I can't remember why.
Yeah.
Toilet.

1798
01:41:52.420 --> 01:41:56.680
Why would he put his feet in the toilet to wash.
Dot.
Yeah,
he was gross,

1799
01:41:56.681 --> 01:42:00.490
but Oh God,
I don't use deodorant.
I've never used deodorant.
Really?

1800
01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:03.940
I just don't have that.
My pit smelled like just a little bit,

1801
01:42:04.450 --> 01:42:05.950
but probably about the same as somebody.

1802
01:42:05.951 --> 01:42:09.460
He uses it because the more you used the odor and it clogs up the pores in your

1803
01:42:09.461 --> 01:42:12.700
pits and it actually makes it worse and it can cause cancer.
Why?

1804
01:42:12.701 --> 01:42:17.260
I always felt that people who think they don't smell usually probably smell.

1805
01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:19.960
You want to smell me,
Brian?
No,
don't do it.
Don't do it.

1806
01:42:19.961 --> 01:42:23.170
I won't allow you to is a derailment.
It's going to ruin the show.

1807
01:42:23.350 --> 01:42:25.600
You're going to throw up and we're going to have to clean that guarantee.

1808
01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:32.050
Get in there.
Is it bad?
I you're so full of shit.
It's actually pretty nice.

1809
01:42:32.230 --> 01:42:34.090
It's pretty nice.
We took a shower before you came here.

1810
01:42:34.110 --> 01:42:36.940
He came a couple of days in traffic.
Hey,

1811
01:42:36.941 --> 01:42:39.940
I took the four oh five to the one on one and then into a podcast.

1812
01:42:39.941 --> 01:42:43.000
If I was going to stink,
I would think that would be the time.
That's true.

1813
01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:45.330
That's true.
Probably ever interview someone on a podcast.

1814
01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:47.650
You see their fucking sweating and you're like,
wow,

1815
01:42:47.651 --> 01:42:51.250
people get nervous on these fucking things they do now.
It used to be nothing,

1816
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:54.310
right?
It used to be just go on and talk and no one worries about shit.

1817
01:42:54.490 --> 01:42:57.670
I had to show up at their publicists.
A lot of people did.

1818
01:42:57.671 --> 01:42:59.250
A lot of people show up with the public.
However,

1819
01:42:59.251 --> 01:43:01.670
the publicist asked me questions,
what are you guys going to talk about?

1820
01:43:02.290 --> 01:43:05.920
We're going to talk about you right on necessary.
You are,
well,
your client first,

1821
01:43:05.921 --> 01:43:09.280
your clients can smoke pot and then I'm going to ask them about their balls is

1822
01:43:09.281 --> 01:43:12.790
not going to happen.
We're not going to take direction from you.
Crazy.
Right,

1823
01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:15.250
right.
Fuck out of here with that.
Although it is nice though.

1824
01:43:15.530 --> 01:43:19.540
I fucking hate booking guests and I love it when a publicity like I got a

1825
01:43:19.541 --> 01:43:22.320
relationship with a couple of them that have cool clients.
Oh yeah,
no,

1826
01:43:22.330 --> 01:43:23.530
it's like Jim Jefferies,

1827
01:43:23.531 --> 01:43:27.920
a publicist has got like a bunch of really cool people that he sends me.
No,

1828
01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:29.590
there's definitely cool publicists.

1829
01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:33.970
The problem is when they want to start dictating what the client will and won't

1830
01:43:33.971 --> 01:43:34.870
be willing to do.
Like,

1831
01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:37.630
like I don't ever want to talk about something that one person doesn't want to

1832
01:43:37.631 --> 01:43:39.820
talk about.
I don't want to like pull the dirt on anybody.

1833
01:43:39.850 --> 01:43:41.440
I want you to have a conversation.

1834
01:43:41.441 --> 01:43:44.080
I want to find out what's going on inside your head.
That's what I want.

1835
01:43:44.350 --> 01:43:45.460
So don't worry about it.

1836
01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:47.730
And if you don't want them saying what's going inside there,

1837
01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:51.010
you guys need to talk.
Yeah.
You know,
you guys should talk amongst yourselves.

1838
01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.040
Figure out what the fuck you're doing

1839
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:53.600
<v 7>because you've got to pretend to be somebody else.</v>

1840
01:43:54.050 --> 01:43:56.150
You're gonna have a problem no matter what you do.
Just be yourself.

1841
01:43:56.220 --> 01:44:00.320
<v 1>Yeah.
And a good publicist will only put you on a show that is a good mass.</v>

1842
01:44:00.380 --> 01:44:03.510
You work with Michael O'Brien,
right?
Yeah,
me too.
It's great guy.

1843
01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:07.470
He's the greatest guy in the world and he,
he is all about matches.

1844
01:44:07.471 --> 01:44:12.240
So then when he approaches like the a v Club or the New York Times or whatever,

1845
01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:15.720
he would never bring them a client that's not appropriate for them and vice

1846
01:44:15.721 --> 01:44:18.210
versa.
And that's why he's got such a great reputation.

1847
01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:22.850
<v 7>Well,
he also,
he,
he enjoys what he's doing now.
He enjoys comedians.</v>

1848
01:44:22.851 --> 01:44:25.820
He enjoys the world of standup comedy.
He's a very bright guy.

1849
01:44:25.821 --> 01:44:27.590
So he's got all these good things going for him.

1850
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:28.670
<v 1>Great Roster.</v>

1851
01:44:28.671 --> 01:44:32.910
All his roster are interesting people that are kind of independent thinking and

1852
01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:36.410
<v 7>yeah,
now he's an awesome dude,
man.
He's awesome.
And you know,</v>

1853
01:44:36.411 --> 01:44:38.780
it definitely does help if you want to get on.
I mean,

1854
01:44:38.810 --> 01:44:41.480
if you wanted to just get on the Letterman show,

1855
01:44:41.490 --> 01:44:42.920
are you wanting to do all these different things?

1856
01:44:42.921 --> 01:44:46.220
Like it'd be fucking a pain in the ass for you to organize that shit yourself

1857
01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:48.170
and go chase all that shit down yourself.

1858
01:44:48.430 --> 01:44:51.080
What have you have a publicist doing it?
They do all the leg work for you.

1859
01:44:51.081 --> 01:44:54.110
They have direct connections with all these people.
That book these shows,

1860
01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:56.600
it makes it more convenient.
Right.
You know,

1861
01:44:56.870 --> 01:45:00.500
I think that in today's Day and age,
you know,

1862
01:45:00.530 --> 01:45:05.530
it's all about finding someone who's going to let you express yourself is with

1863
01:45:05.931 --> 01:45:10.550
his little sort of a push as possible.

1864
01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:14.030
As far as the publicist.
Yeah.
As far as anything,
as far as a manager,

1865
01:45:14.031 --> 01:45:17.960
as far as an agent,
because a Ari had a situation where he,

1866
01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:21.710
he dumped his manager because it was managers,
agent,
whoever it was,

1867
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:25.750
because the guy was telling him not to do a poop joke because it was a shit.

1868
01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:30.180
It's a shit joke.
They should stop doing it.
It's a shit show.
Meanwhile,

1869
01:45:30.230 --> 01:45:33.380
the bit destroys and ours,
he's like,
okay,
you don't get it.

1870
01:45:34.110 --> 01:45:37.370
So it gets rid of him,
which is what Ra would typically do.
You know?

1871
01:45:37.371 --> 01:45:40.430
But he's right.
You can't have a guy like that and you were in your lineup.

1872
01:45:40.431 --> 01:45:41.120
You can't,

1873
01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:44.690
you can't have a guy who thinks that one of your best bits ever is not good

1874
01:45:44.691 --> 01:45:47.960
because it's about shitting yourself.
Right.
See what it actually did happen.

1875
01:45:48.050 --> 01:45:50.330
I mean,
he's telling a real story about something that happened to them.

1876
01:45:50.570 --> 01:45:53.330
That bridge,
there's a bridge in Sydney that you walk across,

1877
01:45:53.730 --> 01:45:54.830
it's crazy fucking bridge.

1878
01:45:54.831 --> 01:45:57.980
And once you're committed to walking across that thing,
it's a fucking,
you know,

1879
01:45:57.981 --> 01:46:00.950
it's a half an hour journey,
you know?
And in the middle of it,
he had a shit

1880
01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:06.770
like bad and he shit himself and it's fucking hilarious.

1881
01:46:06.771 --> 01:46:09.680
The story is hilarious.
And this dummy was saying,

1882
01:46:09.681 --> 01:46:11.750
you shouldn't tell it because it's a shit storm,
right.

1883
01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:15.140
It's not like he's got a history of shit stories.
He's got a history stories,

1884
01:46:15.450 --> 01:46:19.150
you know,
art,
he talks about it,
whatever it is that he thinks is funny.

1885
01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:22.380
<v 1>Well,
I remember Louis C K had an agent and he,</v>

1886
01:46:22.381 --> 01:46:27.270
Louie was going to go out to pitch a sitcom idea and the agent goes,
uh,
okay.

1887
01:46:27.271 --> 01:46:30.630
So,
uh,
we're going to set a meeting on Tuesday.
And Louis was like,
okay,
great.

1888
01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:32.490
Who is it with?
And he was like,
you know,
with us,

1889
01:46:32.491 --> 01:46:35.520
so you could come in and pitch to us and we can,
uh,
give you notes.

1890
01:46:35.521 --> 01:46:37.350
And Louis was like,
here's your job.

1891
01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:41.850
You call the network and you set up a meeting.
And I go pitch to them,

1892
01:46:41.851 --> 01:46:46.260
I don't pitch to you,
I don't fucking take notes from you.
And uh,

1893
01:46:46.830 --> 01:46:51.540
and that,
so then he of course went out and sold the shall,
but yeah.
Wow.

1894
01:46:51.570 --> 01:46:54.670
That's ridiculous.
They wanted to be a part of the creative,
the two.

1895
01:46:54.710 --> 01:46:57.330
Some people feel like,
hey,
you know,
I'm not sure about this pitch.

1896
01:46:57.331 --> 01:46:59.250
Maybe you guys know what people are buying,

1897
01:46:59.550 --> 01:47:01.980
but you don't tell the clients come in and do it.
Well,

1898
01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:07.240
<v 7>you're right.
Especially when the guy has a Louis C K but I know of um,
uh,</v>

1899
01:47:07.241 --> 01:47:11.820
an agent that has one particularly needy client where they go over their set

1900
01:47:11.821 --> 01:47:14.410
list,
they go over every bit they do,

1901
01:47:14.590 --> 01:47:17.410
they go over like any idea that they're going to pitch,

1902
01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:21.820
they have like mock pitch meetings and he makes the agent's like be a part of

1903
01:47:21.821 --> 01:47:25.540
all this.
And he calls him up all day,
every day.
Like he calls them up constantly.

1904
01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:30.100
<v 1>Many times guys,
I talked to my agent every couple months and I just say,</v>

1905
01:47:30.110 --> 01:47:33.310
you're working for me.
I,
you know,
I,
I get shit.
And I go,

1906
01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:35.240
but like then I think about the clients that are,

1907
01:47:35.410 --> 01:47:38.800
every time I call the other guys on the other fucking line,

1908
01:47:38.801 --> 01:47:42.850
I realize he's getting more for his 10% that I'm getting from my 10% but the,

1909
01:47:42.851 --> 01:47:45.880
you know,
the guy who woody Allen first work with,
um,

1910
01:47:46.530 --> 01:47:49.370
John Joffey who this manager,

1911
01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:52.480
he had like three fucking clients and it was like Steve Martin,

1912
01:47:52.481 --> 01:47:54.190
Woody Allen and somebody else.

1913
01:47:54.430 --> 01:47:58.630
And this guy would go to every fucking set.
This is early on.

1914
01:47:58.631 --> 01:48:03.220
He'd go to the comedy cellar with Cafe Wha or woody Allen was first working out

1915
01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:07.670
before he had any success.
He knew this guy was brilliant and he sat with,

1916
01:48:07.671 --> 01:48:11.830
he'd go to a coffee shop with them afterwards and they talk about his sat and

1917
01:48:11.950 --> 01:48:14.980
you know how he should maybe write a short stories about it.

1918
01:48:15.730 --> 01:48:18.610
Those days are gone.
Mac,
you imagine,
I mean,
you have that,

1919
01:48:18.611 --> 01:48:21.220
you have that relationship I think with Jeff Sussman where you,

1920
01:48:21.370 --> 01:48:25.870
you trust him creatively and you can have talks about content.

1921
01:48:25.890 --> 01:48:30.330
<v 7>Definitely.
Well,
Jeff is the funniest manager ever.
He could've been a comic.</v>

1922
01:48:30.331 --> 01:48:33.000
He didn't no desire to be a comic,
but he easily could have been calming.

1923
01:48:33.110 --> 01:48:35.130
It's funny,
he says Funny Shit,
right?

1924
01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:38.490
And he doesn't buy into nonsense like you know,

1925
01:48:38.491 --> 01:48:41.310
he's like the first guy to call bullshit on something.
I want to,

1926
01:48:41.311 --> 01:48:44.190
I don't want to mention particular names,
but the guys that he was right about,

1927
01:48:44.510 --> 01:48:47.400
you know,
we like took her husband,
there's nothing happening there.
Stop.

1928
01:48:47.790 --> 01:48:50.130
Just stop it.
Like somebody would try to say that this guy was funny,

1929
01:48:50.131 --> 01:48:52.110
this guy's good and he's like,
this is not going to whack it.

1930
01:48:52.111 --> 01:48:54.210
He's not going to last like he's doing bullshit up there.

1931
01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:56.310
And then everybody's like,
oh I thought he was doing really well.

1932
01:48:56.311 --> 01:48:59.160
I thought he had a good set tonight and then a year later assessments.
Right.

1933
01:48:59.310 --> 01:49:03.900
He's,
he's got a weird sense of comedy.
He's a weird guy,
but he's also like,

1934
01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:06.840
he's like a real old school manager,
you know,

1935
01:49:06.930 --> 01:49:09.930
like he's like involved in the full career.

1936
01:49:09.931 --> 01:49:12.840
It's a project for him like Kevin James,
whether it's me,

1937
01:49:12.841 --> 01:49:15.720
whether it's the other guys that he,
he handles a keys involved.

1938
01:49:15.721 --> 01:49:18.990
Like it's a project like you really are working with them.
It's a,
it's a,

1939
01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:24.060
he's a weird dude,
but he also like trust everybody he works with,

1940
01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:26.820
he knows that,
you know,
if Kevin's gonna do his thing,

1941
01:49:26.821 --> 01:49:28.440
Kevin's going to do it the best that he can do it.

1942
01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:29.670
He knows if I'm going to do something,

1943
01:49:29.671 --> 01:49:32.130
I'm going to do it the best and he knows that we'll bring them in and ask

1944
01:49:32.131 --> 01:49:34.620
questions to them.
Right.
Cause we respect him as a person,

1945
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:39.090
but he'd never feels like it's his job to like tell you to come in and you're

1946
01:49:39.091 --> 01:49:41.450
going to pitch to him and then we're going to go out and you're like,

1947
01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:45.820
<v 1>and also to respect your clients.
I know a lot of managers,
big managers,</v>

1948
01:49:46.090 --> 01:49:49.450
they got clients,
they don't,
they talk shit about them.
And you,

1949
01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:50.920
you're sitting there,
you're like,
okay,

1950
01:49:50.921 --> 01:49:52.900
I get that word t you're making fun of this guy,

1951
01:49:52.901 --> 01:49:56.770
but you represent them that that means he's should be an extension of you.

1952
01:49:57.310 --> 01:49:59.350
<v 7>Well,
the,
this very few people that are like that.</v>

1953
01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:02.290
That's one of the things about saucepan and that makes him so amazing.

1954
01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:04.660
He's just a,
I'm so lucky I'm met that guy,
man.

1955
01:50:04.661 --> 01:50:07.060
I met him when I was an open miker yeah.
You know,

1956
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:11.410
cause I had the same manager for 20 fucking three years or something crazy like

1957
01:50:11.411 --> 01:50:15.430
that.
I mean that was a scrub when that dude found me.
It's amazing.
He's the best.

1958
01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:16.930
He's just a great guy too.
You know?

1959
01:50:16.931 --> 01:50:19.930
It's like the more great people that you have that around you that you really

1960
01:50:19.931 --> 01:50:22.720
love being around.
Like you see him,
like whether we're talking about Brody,

1961
01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:26.110
you see Brody get this big,
I have a lot of people,
people like that in my life.

1962
01:50:26.150 --> 01:50:29.320
Like saucepans one of them.
I see him,
I just get this big burst of happiness,

1963
01:50:29.321 --> 01:50:33.970
you know,
like that guy represents like a longterm friendship,
a great guy.

1964
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.090
Just the more people like that you can have in your life,

1965
01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:38.200
the better your life will be.

1966
01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:41.940
<v 1>Yeah.
I think that,
uh,
you know,
my,</v>

1967
01:50:41.970 --> 01:50:46.490
my circle gets smaller and smaller and it's,
and it's just feels good because it,

1968
01:50:46.890 --> 01:50:50.280
because I just realized like,
I can't possibly,
like you and I,

1969
01:50:50.281 --> 01:50:54.510
we don't spend enough time together shooting pool just,
you know,

1970
01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:57.480
I want to fucking go.
Yeah.
We'll go on the road together.

1971
01:50:57.810 --> 01:50:59.390
And I realized there's so many people that I,

1972
01:50:59.450 --> 01:51:04.450
I have to cause like they're my kids' friends' parents and we'll do a thing and

1973
01:51:04.621 --> 01:51:07.110
it's like,
Oh man,
this is time for my life.

1974
01:51:07.111 --> 01:51:10.830
I could be fucking out with rogue and we're going to be having fun.

1975
01:51:10.831 --> 01:51:14.130
Just laughing like ridiculous.
Right,
right.

1976
01:51:14.260 --> 01:51:18.480
<v 7>Yeah.
There's,
there's definitely that.
There's,
I mean,
it's nice when you run into,</v>

1977
01:51:18.490 --> 01:51:20.230
like,
we have some friends that we,

1978
01:51:20.231 --> 01:51:22.450
our kids are friends with and the really interesting people.

1979
01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:27.140
<v 1>Well you got to find friends that have kids and let your kids become friends.</v>

1980
01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:28.100
Yes.
The order,

1981
01:51:28.170 --> 01:51:30.540
<v 7>that's a good order.
Can I have that with Callan?</v>

1982
01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:32.640
His kids are friends with my kids.
Right.

1983
01:51:33.330 --> 01:51:38.330
But it's just fucking like the random chance of meeting like the parents of one

1984
01:51:40.501 --> 01:51:43.830
of your daughter's friends and you being forced to like have conversations with

1985
01:51:43.831 --> 01:51:48.330
those people and have it be enjoyable.
Hmm.
Oh God,
man.
I have to listen to some,

1986
01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:50.700
first of all,
you see people disrespect each other.
Oh,

1987
01:51:50.770 --> 01:51:52.020
go on dates and you see like the,

1988
01:51:52.190 --> 01:51:55.310
the husband will disrespect of wire for the wife would disrespect the husband

1989
01:51:55.311 --> 01:51:56.430
and they'll do it in front of you.

1990
01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:59.280
It's like until like check each other and you're like,
whoa.

1991
01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:02.520
And you're just around this,
you know that there's some darkness.

1992
01:52:02.521 --> 01:52:05.850
As soon as they get in that car and now it says those doors shut and they know

1993
01:52:05.851 --> 01:52:08.870
they're alone.
You fucking cunt.
He fucking ruin the entire DNF.

1994
01:52:11.070 --> 01:52:14.340
<v 1>Why did you ask him about being a podcaster?
You know,
he's,
you know,</v>

1995
01:52:14.341 --> 01:52:17.760
he's does his own thing.
He's not pot,
you know,
he's on pot,
right?

1996
01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:22.860
All that kind of shit.
But yeah,
I think that there's a certain,
Matt and you,

1997
01:52:22.861 --> 01:52:26.040
you were just,
you expect if I go out to dinner with another couple,

1998
01:52:26.050 --> 01:52:29.400
me and my wife,
we're going to talk about them as soon as the door closes.

1999
01:52:29.401 --> 01:52:30.720
But it's going to be fun.

2000
01:52:30.721 --> 01:52:32.730
It's not going to be like heartgard it's going to be like,
oh,

2001
01:52:32.731 --> 01:52:37.140
did you see when he said that thing?
Right.
You know,
did you see that?

2002
01:52:37.141 --> 01:52:39.780
And you kinda like have your notes as soon as the door closed.

2003
01:52:39.781 --> 01:52:43.980
He both that but it's not mean spirited but,
but with those people,
you just,

2004
01:52:43.981 --> 01:52:46.010
sometimes with the couple you feel

2005
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:49.010
<v 2>like,
man,
they're going out to dinner with us for the wrong reason.</v>

2006
01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:50.660
<v 7>Yeah.
My deal breaker,</v>

2007
01:52:50.661 --> 01:52:54.950
number one deal breaker is someone was rude to the help jol I've had that happen

2008
01:52:54.951 --> 01:52:58.650
a few times.
We'd go out with folks and uh,
you know,
like the,

2009
01:52:58.660 --> 01:53:01.940
the husband's rude to the waiter,
like for no reason.

2010
01:53:01.970 --> 01:53:03.320
Like orders them around or something.

2011
01:53:03.321 --> 01:53:07.430
Or two does something that's gross or tips really shitty.
I get

2012
01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:11.660
<v 2>maybe slipping bell and then you can see how much each is paying on the bill.</v>

2013
01:53:11.740 --> 01:53:15.400
<v 7>Yeah.
Did the tipping Shitty is a fucking,
that's a sign of really bad character.</v>

2014
01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:17.470
Right,
right.
You know the,
the whole,

2015
01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:21.790
that's a very bad exchange because the person is sort of like acquiescing.

2016
01:53:22.030 --> 01:53:26.580
They're serving you.
Nobody wants to serve you,
man.
Someone serving you there.

2017
01:53:26.581 --> 01:53:30.880
They're there at your beck and call trying to do a good job and you don't reward

2018
01:53:30.881 --> 01:53:33.700
them for that.
You're ruining the whole relationship.
Right.

2019
01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:36.700
The whole relationship is artificial.
They don't want to serve you dummy.

2020
01:53:36.850 --> 01:53:39.580
They're serving you because that's how they make a living and you're supposed to

2021
01:53:39.581 --> 01:53:42.550
reward them for it.
Right.
Like,
and it's a good system.

2022
01:53:42.670 --> 01:53:44.200
Like if you're a waiter in another country,

2023
01:53:44.201 --> 01:53:46.840
you don't make as much money as a waiter in America.
If you're a good waiter,

2024
01:53:47.260 --> 01:53:49.750
you know,
because they don't have fucking tipping right now.
You get paid,

2025
01:53:49.780 --> 01:53:52.140
you get paid,
you work for the business.
And maybe they get,
maybe they,

2026
01:53:52.250 --> 01:53:55.560
<v 2>which usually,
well,
it's just how it should be.
By the way.
I don't get,</v>

2027
01:53:55.740 --> 01:54:00.180
why isn't 20% just add it into the Bale and you pass it is.
But here's the thing.

2028
01:54:00.750 --> 01:54:03.280
A lot of people get mad when they see it.
A lot of people went,
oh,

2029
01:54:03.310 --> 01:54:06.690
how come I asked to be 18% who the fuck says I'm gonna tip 18% I want to tell

2030
01:54:06.691 --> 01:54:09.840
you something.
Well,
this guy was just fucking late with the water.
And you know,

2031
01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:13.770
everybody wants what they want.
You know they,
they want control.

2032
01:54:13.771 --> 01:54:15.000
They want judgment.

2033
01:54:15.001 --> 01:54:19.410
If a plumber comes over to my house and he gets there late and maybe he makes a

2034
01:54:19.411 --> 01:54:23.850
mess,
I don't get to pay him less,
right?
He says,
you know,

2035
01:54:23.851 --> 01:54:26.160
he's giving me a service.
He's doing his best.

2036
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:29.280
I can choose somebody else next time.
You know your ideas,

2037
01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:31.670
<v 7>you,
when you go to a restaurant,
it's not,</v>

2038
01:54:31.671 --> 01:54:35.230
it's not like you're going to pick the same waiter and you know,
you don't wanna.

2039
01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:38.660
You don't want to have to like take a chance on someone knowing that you're

2040
01:54:38.661 --> 01:54:39.590
going to tip.
Well.

2041
01:54:39.710 --> 01:54:43.170
You know what you want to do is go to a place and assume that everyone's going

2042
01:54:43.171 --> 01:54:44.990
to tip.
Well.
If you want to work at that place,

2043
01:54:44.991 --> 01:54:47.870
you should assume that everyone that comes in,
it's going to be nice.
Now,

2044
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:49.610
in the perfect world,

2045
01:54:49.670 --> 01:54:52.760
it would all be the guys going to get paid the same amount no matter what,

2046
01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:55.280
but then where would be the motivation to be really nice?

2047
01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:57.980
Like part of what you're getting when you go to a restaurant,

2048
01:54:57.981 --> 01:54:59.160
you deal with the waiter is,
is fake

2049
01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:02.490
<v 2>bullshit.
Yeah.
Paying for that fake bullshit,
sir.</v>

2050
01:55:02.491 --> 01:55:06.750
Would you like the Oregon Pinot Noir?
I recommend it's fruity notes.

2051
01:55:06.751 --> 01:55:10.190
Who are you man?
Who are you?
Why is this interaction happening?

2052
01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:14.130
It's a strange way.
Notes.
You're,
why are you calling me Mister Rogan way?
Call me,

2053
01:55:14.131 --> 01:55:17.670
sir.
This is a beard.
Shit,
man.
You're just a dude.
I'm a dude.
What do you got,
man?

2054
01:55:17.671 --> 01:55:19.380
What's good?
What's good to eat here?

2055
01:55:19.410 --> 01:55:21.600
Why did you ask me three times how things are going?

2056
01:55:21.601 --> 01:55:25.830
I was in the middle of a sentence and you broke it up with,
is everything okay?

2057
01:55:25.860 --> 01:55:29.640
It was too.
You fucking interrupting me.
I'm giving you 20% back off.

2058
01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.240
If the problem is also,
it's like if you get that service,

2059
01:55:33.241 --> 01:55:38.241
it's just as likely that it's because the manager understaffed or the cook is a

2060
01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:41.550
fucking drunk.
So the food's not coming out in time.

2061
01:55:41.730 --> 01:55:44.400
So you're the waiter bearing the brunt

2062
01:55:44.490 --> 01:55:47.850
<v 0>of a bunch of things that could be going wrong.
Right,
right,
right.
Yeah.</v>

2063
01:55:47.851 --> 01:55:51.360
The waiter is definitely the guy who's taken the heat,
but you know,

2064
01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:54.270
they're not all innocent either.
You know,
sometimes you get a shit waiter.
Right.

2065
01:55:54.271 --> 01:55:57.300
And that's,
you should pay them less.
You should tip them less for sure.

2066
01:55:57.690 --> 01:56:00.040
But if you get a really good one should tip the more.
Yeah.
It's,

2067
01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:02.100
I think it's a good system.
I think it's a good system.

2068
01:56:02.101 --> 01:56:05.250
As long as people were cool,
well then we should extend it to other jobs.

2069
01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:06.780
We should.
Yeah.
That's where it gets weird.

2070
01:56:06.781 --> 01:56:11.030
I was talking to this girls at Starbucks and uh,
they would Starbucks,
um,
um,

2071
01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:15.960
at the airport and normally they don't have a tip tip thing.
And I go,
uh,

2072
01:56:15.961 --> 01:56:18.630
I go,
do you guys have a tip thing now?
And she goes,
yeah,

2073
01:56:18.631 --> 01:56:21.600
we're not supposed to but fuck it.
I go,
yeah,
fuck it.
You should have a tip thing.

2074
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:23.850
I go,
how come you guys have a tip thing?
And other people don't?

2075
01:56:23.851 --> 01:56:25.980
Is that what it is that other people don't have a tip thing?

2076
01:56:25.981 --> 01:56:28.290
So they get upset and it was always the bookstore.
That's what it was.

2077
01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:30.450
And she was like,
yeah,
that's exactly what it is.

2078
01:56:30.451 --> 01:56:33.680
Like the people that work like selling books that they don't get tips,

2079
01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:38.050
they get upset that we get tips,
we sell coffee,
I'll be doing it serving coffee,

2080
01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:40.560
but they have a jar that they left the billboard like,
fuck it,

2081
01:56:40.561 --> 01:56:42.690
we're just putting the tip out.
I'm like,
Ooh,
I love it.

2082
01:56:42.691 --> 01:56:46.890
Some interfacing physicists,
they're making minimum fucking wage

2083
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:53.250
starting around Greece all day.
They're dealing with,
you know,
uh,
I mean,

2084
01:56:53.251 --> 01:56:56.680
let's be honest,
people at Mcdonald's are not treat,
are not that.

2085
01:56:56.681 --> 01:57:01.410
The same customer base is Starbucks.
Starbucks.
You got a bunch of,
you know,
well,

2086
01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:06.090
you know well paid people well mannered and they're coming in and then you get

2087
01:57:06.091 --> 01:57:10.740
tips.
Mcdonald's,
you're getting fat,
stupid people that eat McDonald's food.

2088
01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:12.000
You're dealing with them.

2089
01:57:12.001 --> 01:57:15.090
You're dealing with a kitchen that's filled with minimum wage cooks,

2090
01:57:15.091 --> 01:57:18.630
so they fucking suck and you're not getting a tip.

2091
01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:22.170
How does that make sense?
It doesn't make any sense this way.

2092
01:57:22.171 --> 01:57:23.790
Worst jobs in this world,
there's,

2093
01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:26.760
there's like all jobs are not created equal by any stretch of the imagination,

2094
01:57:26.970 --> 01:57:31.230
right?
But those bad ones almost exist to let you know,

2095
01:57:31.231 --> 01:57:34.830
like as an individual,
of course they exist in a system,
a society system,

2096
01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:36.000
but as an individual,

2097
01:57:36.001 --> 01:57:40.020
those jobs almost exist to let you know that you for sure don't want to do that.

2098
01:57:40.470 --> 01:57:43.860
It's like the feeling of it being,
it's like being in a real bad relationship,

2099
01:57:43.861 --> 01:57:47.790
right?
Like what?
What gets you out of a relationship?
It he fucking explode.

2100
01:57:47.791 --> 01:57:50.010
That's what happens.
You get to a certain point where you like,

2101
01:57:50.011 --> 01:57:53.610
will you just shut the fuck up and leave me alone?
I can't take it.

2102
01:57:53.611 --> 01:57:57.660
His negativity anymore.
We're done.
We're done here.
Okay.
We boom,

2103
01:57:57.720 --> 01:57:59.640
like you have to hit this well,

2104
01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:03.090
you gotta hit the bottom 15 order to change and you've got to have that

2105
01:58:03.091 --> 01:58:06.030
Mcdonald's job to appreciate a really good job.

2106
01:58:06.450 --> 01:58:08.970
And it's great to talk about later.
Like you and I,

2107
01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:12.990
we talked about our first jobs.
It gave you the motivation to get up,

2108
01:58:13.020 --> 01:58:15.080
get on your fucking horse and get out of there.
Yeah.

2109
01:58:15.090 --> 01:58:16.650
If you didn't have that motivation.

2110
01:58:16.680 --> 01:58:18.780
And that's where when we're talking about money,

2111
01:58:18.970 --> 01:58:23.220
like our society designed to sort of encourage motivation,

2112
01:58:23.221 --> 01:58:24.390
which encourages success,

2113
01:58:24.391 --> 01:58:29.160
which encourages financial rewards and encourages you more attractive to the

2114
01:58:29.161 --> 01:58:32.760
opposite sex when you're driving a Ferrari to a lot of checks.
That's a fact.

2115
01:58:32.761 --> 01:58:36.660
A lot of people get really mad at that,
but that's a fact.
It's just the fact,

2116
01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:37.051
I mean,

2117
01:58:37.051 --> 01:58:40.770
there's just too many dudes who are ugly and old who have really hot wives,

2118
01:58:40.771 --> 01:58:42.010
right?
I mean,
it's just fact.

2119
01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:43.480
<v 7>Guys get billions of dollars,</v>

2120
01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:46.390
giant yachts and their fucking these hot chicks and it doesn't make any sense.

2121
01:58:46.540 --> 01:58:51.260
But that's a fact.
You can't deny that fact.
Why is that fact exist?
Well,

2122
01:58:51.261 --> 01:58:54.400
it exists because we've got a weird system that a weird system and that's one of

2123
01:58:54.401 --> 01:58:55.300
the holes in the system.

2124
01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:59.470
One of the holes in the system is that achievement as as superseded actual

2125
01:58:59.471 --> 01:59:03.010
physical desire for a lot of these poor gold diggers and they let this wrinkly

2126
01:59:03.011 --> 01:59:05.170
old cock sucker shoot his dry loads

2127
01:59:06.740 --> 01:59:10.860
<v 2>and you got to pretend you love it.
Oh baby.
Oh yeah.
Putting my mouth baby.</v>

2128
01:59:11.160 --> 01:59:14.520
While you're like you like that guy who got his face farted on through up at

2129
01:59:14.521 --> 01:59:15.880
Naga.
That's what you think.

2130
01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:20.160
Thinking this old man fucking creeps on you and he doesn't share on purpose just

2131
01:59:20.161 --> 01:59:23.340
to degrade you further if it's all about the money.
Yeah.

2132
01:59:23.341 --> 01:59:25.710
Why don't you say suck it now baby?
Well,

2133
01:59:25.711 --> 01:59:28.950
there's a lot of guys at definitely have a resentment towards these golden oh

2134
01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:31.380
yeah,
for sure.
Especially once the woman's,

2135
01:59:31.550 --> 01:59:35.410
the fun has worn off of the game of pretending you're attracted to the man.
Hmm.

2136
01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:39.810
Which,
you know,
if you're a guy who's not attractive and

2137
01:59:39.880 --> 01:59:44.290
<v 7>you're successful and you believe in your head that you're something cool,</v>

2138
01:59:44.330 --> 01:59:47.920
there's something special about you.
Look how well I've done.
And this defines me,

2139
01:59:47.921 --> 01:59:51.960
this watch to just watched a $50,000 watch and this is a fucking $20 million

2140
01:59:51.961 --> 01:59:52.450
state.

2141
01:59:52.450 --> 01:59:55.900
And you get that shit in your head and you get a girl and she tricks you with

2142
01:59:55.901 --> 01:59:59.070
your own ego.
She can get baby.
You're just amazing to be a brown.

2143
01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:02.080
I'm just so lucky we met each other.
Meanwhile,
she's perfect.

2144
02:00:02.081 --> 02:00:07.081
Her tits or just melons bobbing gently in this really strange,

2145
02:00:07.481 --> 02:00:12.190
thin material clothes that she wears that clings over her hips and just inches

2146
02:00:12.340 --> 02:00:13.780
lower than her vagina,

2147
02:00:13.900 --> 02:00:18.430
just hanging inches lower than in vagina or bubble ass and perfect clay gap

2148
02:00:18.431 --> 02:00:22.120
under the pussy hose.
Jesus Christ.

2149
02:00:22.210 --> 02:00:25.750
And She just strokes your cock kisses you and you're like,
I'm married.

2150
02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:30.300
<v 2>Betcha.
Wait a man.
Yes,
yes,
yes,
of course.
Ties.
He's like tire.</v>

2151
02:00:30.301 --> 02:00:33.850
She's Thai.
So she gets that shoulder room.
Oh yeah.

2152
02:00:33.900 --> 02:00:35.310
And that's the thing is you realize with her,

2153
02:00:35.311 --> 02:00:39.270
not only am I getting the fucking body,
I'm getting shoulder rubs,

2154
02:00:39.271 --> 02:00:43.890
I'm getting subservient.
The bitch can cook treats the help.
Well,

2155
02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:48.210
she gets it and you can go out with her.
And she knows how to treat your friends.

2156
02:00:48.510 --> 02:00:50.030
She knows how to kiss you on Friday

2157
02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:53.880
<v 7>when you're sleep because she realizes that she's tricked you into having a</v>

2158
02:00:53.881 --> 02:00:57.590
Shitty,
we'll where she gets paid because your kids are your,

2159
02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:01.650
she convinced you the kids would be better off if you didn't give them a safety

2160
02:01:01.651 --> 02:01:03.690
net because that would make them successful like you.

2161
02:01:03.691 --> 02:01:06.600
So she played to your ego and you cut the kids out of the will and gave all the

2162
02:01:06.601 --> 02:01:10.200
money.
It was crazy tie bitch who starts slowly poison in your drink

2163
02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:12.430
<v 2>and she won.
She earned it.</v>

2164
02:01:12.431 --> 02:01:15.730
That's the thing about like Anna Nicole Smith when his fucking stupid kids

2165
02:01:15.731 --> 02:01:19.390
wanted his state.
No,
Anna Nicole was sucking his dick.

2166
02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:23.750
Didn't you just do a bit about this?
Fuck Yo,
my closers.
Well,

2167
02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:27.130
it's a whole thing about them saying like,
oh my God,

2168
02:01:27.131 --> 02:01:29.290
she's taking advantage of him.
She's only been,

2169
02:01:29.320 --> 02:01:33.330
she's the only with him for his money.
I'm like,
don't you think he fucking knows,

2170
02:01:33.340 --> 02:01:36.130
right?
Like I made $1 billion from scratch.

2171
02:01:36.430 --> 02:01:39.980
Chances are he's a tad crafty and it was like this whole thing about like how

2172
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:41.340
<v 7>you want to die,
dude.</v>

2173
02:01:41.350 --> 02:01:44.870
You'd want it to shaking and alone in your hospital bed surrounded by loved
ones.

2174
02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:49.940
Or do you want to get a big Fat Kentucky Fried Hooker and just blow it out?

2175
02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:56.150
And it was all him dying telling her to lick his ass and all the different

2176
02:01:56.151 --> 02:01:57.620
shitty did to her right before he died.

2177
02:01:57.670 --> 02:02:00.510
<v 1>Well,
and the kids have done nothing and they think they deserve.</v>

2178
02:02:00.630 --> 02:02:04.140
You were raised with all that fucking money.
You went to private schools,

2179
02:02:04.141 --> 02:02:08.100
you had tennis coaches,
he probably bought you houses.
Why do you need more?

2180
02:02:08.101 --> 02:02:09.870
What the fuck did you do?
You didn't suck

2181
02:02:10.030 --> 02:02:12.360
<v 7>deck.
You need to get your own money.
Stupid,
right?</v>

2182
02:02:12.361 --> 02:02:17.160
He rode the ride and now it's over.
And I think also in this,
it sounds fucked up,

2183
02:02:17.161 --> 02:02:21.810
but that exists because it's a predatory situation.

2184
02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:25.410
You're,
you're prey.
You know,
if you are vulnerable,
old,

2185
02:02:25.411 --> 02:02:30.270
weak emotional guy who also has $1 billion,
we weren't going to prey on you,

2186
02:02:30.290 --> 02:02:32.100
right?
They're going to pretend to be something they're not.

2187
02:02:32.101 --> 02:02:35.010
And they might need to convince themselves that they are that something that

2188
02:02:35.011 --> 02:02:39.060
they're pretending to be because their instinct to try to acquire your wealth

2189
02:02:39.061 --> 02:02:44.061
and your social status is so strong that they want to be the Trump girl.

2190
02:02:44.460 --> 02:02:47.170
They want to be the new girl that Trump leaves his wife for

2191
02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:51.500
<v 1>black and white.
I mean if you're a woman that grew up in that paradigm,</v>

2192
02:02:51.501 --> 02:02:55.700
maybe your dad had money and your mother was a stay at home mom and maybe she

2193
02:02:55.701 --> 02:02:59.810
had a a a hint of that and then all of a sudden you're involved in charitable

2194
02:02:59.811 --> 02:03:02.360
organizations and you're taking his wealth and you're,

2195
02:03:02.361 --> 02:03:04.460
you're channeling it to positive things.

2196
02:03:04.670 --> 02:03:09.260
So you see it starts to not necessarily be about is see the one I would have

2197
02:03:09.261 --> 02:03:12.860
married just based on his looks and his charisma,

2198
02:03:13.130 --> 02:03:14.810
but it starts to become about like,
well,

2199
02:03:14.811 --> 02:03:18.160
life is pairing up with somebody and being powerful.

2200
02:03:18.290 --> 02:03:19.730
Like you watched house of cards.

2201
02:03:20.020 --> 02:03:20.950
<v 7>No I haven't,
don't,</v>

2202
02:03:20.951 --> 02:03:25.150
don't you fucking spoiler alert me to say the relationship is about power.

2203
02:03:25.180 --> 02:03:28.750
I know that movie,
the show brother is supposed to be amazing.
It's amazing.

2204
02:03:28.780 --> 02:03:29.950
Jumping onto it next,

2205
02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:33.970
but it's basically about how a couple can be together because there are a power

2206
02:03:33.971 --> 02:03:38.770
couple and it's interesting bill and Hillary most likely,
right,
right.
Absolutely.

2207
02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:42.070
Most presidents,
I think probably you have to be,

2208
02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:43.960
I don't think you can do that thing on your own.

2209
02:03:43.990 --> 02:03:45.640
I think that's a nutty fucking job.

2210
02:03:45.641 --> 02:03:48.100
And the first lady has a prominent role in our culture.
I mean,

2211
02:03:48.101 --> 02:03:53.101
she's constantly speaking and doing these things and I think you're dead right?

2212
02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:56.180
I think you're dead right about that.
And I think,
um,

2213
02:03:56.560 --> 02:04:01.560
it's also that we're also talking about just two stops on a broad range of

2214
02:04:01.931 --> 02:04:06.931
possibilities from ultimately totally evil Russian hot prostitute who steals

2215
02:04:07.271 --> 02:04:11.320
your organs when you're asleep at to someone who just doesn't want to work.

2216
02:04:11.321 --> 02:04:14.400
And the guys kind of cool and he treats her good and so she stays with them.

2217
02:04:14.740 --> 02:04:17.380
You know,
I've seen both.
I've seen both.
I've seen,

2218
02:04:17.500 --> 02:04:20.980
I've seen people get victimized and I've seen people that are just in sort of

2219
02:04:20.981 --> 02:04:25.540
these relationship where I wouldn't want it,
but it works for them.
And that's it.

2220
02:04:25.610 --> 02:04:28.040
<v 1>Times they're out in the other way that the woman will tease and be like,</v>

2221
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:31.880
oh honey,
you know,
I wouldn't be with you if it wasn't for the fucking money.

2222
02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:34.660
<v 7>Oh,
it's not even a tea.
He goes,
of course I know that.</v>

2223
02:04:34.690 --> 02:04:37.350
That's a movie that's in a movie.
What was the movie that was in,

2224
02:04:37.351 --> 02:04:41.160
there was a movie that was in where the tin,
well,
no,
the watch,
Schindler's list,

2225
02:04:41.790 --> 02:04:45.420
uh,
terms of endearment.
You can't even help it.
You do it right away.

2226
02:04:45.421 --> 02:04:49.980
You can eat shitty fucking flood tune picture in Oregon's hanging out on,

2227
02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:54.600
on the beach.
Um,
I forget the movie man,
but it was just about,

2228
02:04:55.230 --> 02:04:59.000
about a guy who lost everything and in the scene like his,

2229
02:04:59.001 --> 02:05:02.130
his wife was like laughing about it when everything was going great.

2230
02:05:02.310 --> 02:05:05.440
And then when he did lose all the money,
she did fucking leave them.
Hey,

2231
02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:07.380
well actually it was in the wolf of Wall Street too.

2232
02:05:07.410 --> 02:05:09.750
It's a common theme in the wolf of Wall Street.
Obviously.

2233
02:05:09.751 --> 02:05:12.540
It was a crazy coked up fucking maniac piece of shit.

2234
02:05:12.690 --> 02:05:15.860
But when he was going under and his business is going on it,

2235
02:05:15.861 --> 02:05:18.270
that's when the wife left him.
When he was doing great.

2236
02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:23.010
The wife wanted him when he was married to another woman.
I mean like it was,

2237
02:05:23.011 --> 02:05:27.210
it was a classic story.
So it's not like that's an unfamiliar paradigm to us.

2238
02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:31.310
It's nature.
It's a wounded antelope that gets taken out by the lion.
It's,

2239
02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:34.560
and she needs somebody to provide for her or she doesn't.

2240
02:05:34.650 --> 02:05:38.220
But in that role she does,
if she chooses that role,

2241
02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:43.340
if she chooses the role of fucking the old wrinkly shaky man with his fucking

2242
02:05:44.130 --> 02:05:48.180
Pale translucent dick that he sticks inside of,
we could see as he's coming,

2243
02:05:48.190 --> 02:05:53.190
could see the veins like pump whatever blood of God and it's like a little

2244
02:05:53.971 --> 02:05:58.830
highway going down his fucking Saran wrap skin filled with Viagara.

2245
02:05:58.890 --> 02:06:03.060
Yeah,
and just shooting dust bubbles into her pussy.
Yeah.

2246
02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:07.470
Yeah man.
I mean they changed her nipples.
You can take that choice or you know,

2247
02:06:07.500 --> 02:06:10.620
you could start an art gallery and become a multimillionaire on your own.
I mean,

2248
02:06:10.621 --> 02:06:14.880
you can do that too.
Know it's,
but when you are that girl,
okay,

2249
02:06:14.881 --> 02:06:18.660
if you are that 25 year old girl than Adderall problem,

2250
02:06:18.661 --> 02:06:22.890
that's looking to try to hook up with some old billionaire dude and marry him so

2251
02:06:22.891 --> 02:06:25.680
they'd be taken care of for life.
You're that.
That's your role.

2252
02:06:25.710 --> 02:06:28.380
That's what you've chosen.
You might have more potential than that,

2253
02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:30.300
but it doesn't mean that that's not what you've chosen.
Oh,

2254
02:06:30.301 --> 02:06:33.600
you don't even know baby.
She's so slick.
She's so smart.
I mean,

2255
02:06:33.601 --> 02:06:37.380
that is one of the smartest girls I've ever met in my life when she met him and

2256
02:06:37.381 --> 02:06:40.050
she put out to get,
it doesn't matter if you're talking nonsense,

2257
02:06:40.140 --> 02:06:43.170
she's still that girl.
She's a prostitute.
You can't say no,
no,
no.
Listen,

2258
02:06:43.171 --> 02:06:45.540
you can't say she's a prostitute and I know her and she's powerful.

2259
02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:46.910
And what she did was,
yeah,

2260
02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:50.250
she's really clever and she figured out a way to admit me like guys,
no,
no,
no.

2261
02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:52.470
She's still prostitute.
Right?
You're missing the whole point,
right?

2262
02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:56.280
It doesn't matter if she has all this potential.
She rates 150 bucks a week.
Okay.

2263
02:06:56.370 --> 02:06:58.950
Don't fucking tell me that girl is so goddamn smart.
Oh my God.

2264
02:06:59.070 --> 02:07:01.960
You're saying she's not smart.
Go See.
She's a hooker.
Alright.

2265
02:07:02.070 --> 02:07:03.360
She's playing the role of a hooker

2266
02:07:04.270 --> 02:07:09.270
<v 1>opposite in terms of a female and a male because sometimes women are so hot that</v>

2267
02:07:10.271 --> 02:07:14.440
the guy is getting something out of her and he's putting up with not,

2268
02:07:14.680 --> 02:07:17.500
not having love,
not having respect for her,

2269
02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:22.120
but wanting that pussy so bad or that status of being with somebody that's that

2270
02:07:22.121 --> 02:07:24.280
hot that it is.
Same Way.

2271
02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:28.450
He's a prostitute for what he's getting from her.

2272
02:07:28.820 --> 02:07:30.140
<v 7>Oh yeah,
there's certainly,</v>

2273
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:32.840
I mean there's exchanges other than money that are unfair.

2274
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:36.250
The reason the old man gets the girl in the first place is because of his
fucking

2275
02:07:36.250 --> 02:07:40.300
<v 2>money.
That's it.
So it's honest fo people know what they're getting sort of,</v>

2276
02:07:40.301 --> 02:07:43.750
but it's not because they're playing a game called love in the game is BB.

2277
02:07:43.751 --> 02:07:47.080
I'd love you.
I'm just so happy to be with you.
Oh you love me.
Oh,
come.

2278
02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:49.760
Do you want some Dick?
I thought your tech maybe carpet in the law.

2279
02:07:49.810 --> 02:07:54.520
They're playing a game.
Somebody wins.
He gets pussy,

2280
02:07:55.690 --> 02:07:57.850
pussy is she drugs him?
It's a problem.
Well,

2281
02:07:57.851 --> 02:08:01.300
it's a matter of maintaining that relationship and this allowing her to fuck her

2282
02:08:01.301 --> 02:08:05.470
personal trainer.
Right?
She's going to,
okay,
she's going to look how hot she is.

2283
02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:07.630
She's got this little waste,
this dynamic body.

2284
02:08:07.631 --> 02:08:12.400
She's 25 years old and you're 90 she's going to fuck her trainer.
Just accept it.

2285
02:08:12.490 --> 02:08:15.320
Be happy that you could fuck her and don't ask questions.
Prager

2286
02:08:18.870 --> 02:08:19.810
out.
Open

2287
02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:24.490
<v 7>dose with just a smile.
Yeah.
Rich old man.</v>

2288
02:08:24.670 --> 02:08:27.760
She won't have to worry.
It's fucking Great Eagle's song.

2289
02:08:27.820 --> 02:08:32.800
<v 2>Wow.
Well you can't hide your lying eyes,
man.
It's a fucking jam jam.
See,</v>

2290
02:08:32.801 --> 02:08:35.560
it's gonna be hard for you because when you met your wife,

2291
02:08:35.561 --> 02:08:40.390
you were already very successful.
You had money.
Me,
I had my girl.

2292
02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:44.920
I fucked up because I was single when I met my girl,

2293
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:47.520
my now wife Fucking,

2294
02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:52.660
I had an MTV game shell and I was like,
I met her at the wrong fucking time.

2295
02:08:52.661 --> 02:08:56.890
I could aligned up so much.
But that's not true because you,

2296
02:08:56.950 --> 02:09:00.670
you enjoyed it.
See,
everybody's worried about it,
but you still do.

2297
02:09:00.671 --> 02:09:03.570
But everybody's worried about what they didn't do.
All right,
this is,
ah,

2298
02:09:03.610 --> 02:09:05.570
I should have done this.
No,
you shouldn't have.
Right.

2299
02:09:05.950 --> 02:09:09.430
I've had people in my life to tell me the most important thing that ever

2300
02:09:09.431 --> 02:09:12.790
happened to them was fucking up.
Because if you fuck up,

2301
02:09:12.791 --> 02:09:16.180
then you realize you fucked up and that's what motivates you to get away from

2302
02:09:16.220 --> 02:09:18.190
fucking Mcdonald's.
I should've never done that.

2303
02:09:18.191 --> 02:09:20.650
Of course you should have done it.
I lost everything.

2304
02:09:20.651 --> 02:09:23.470
I fucked up getting that marriage a fucking got married.

2305
02:09:23.471 --> 02:09:26.680
You should've lost everything now,
you know,
right?
You win.
Now you,

2306
02:09:26.681 --> 02:09:28.690
when you got the knowledge,
don't ever let it happen again.

2307
02:09:28.840 --> 02:09:32.230
But don't use it as an excuse to just wallow in your own self.

2308
02:09:32.231 --> 02:09:35.230
Nothing worse than the wallowing fucking divorced guy.
You know,

2309
02:09:35.231 --> 02:09:37.660
he's living in a condo in,
in Marina del Ray,

2310
02:09:37.661 --> 02:09:40.540
and he's fucking go to the same bar every night and the same stuck.

2311
02:09:40.720 --> 02:09:41.980
He's one of those guys were like,

2312
02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:47.040
the woman at Starbucks knows his name because his life has become so simplified

2313
02:09:47.411 --> 02:09:50.860
and dumbed down because he's afraid to move forward after a divorce.

2314
02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:55.420
<v 7>Eddie Bravo used to be a DJ,
a strip club when we first met.
And um,</v>

2315
02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:57.820
Eddie introduced me to the,

2316
02:09:57.830 --> 02:10:02.830
the game of how these girls would go about getting men to buy them things.

2317
02:10:03.250 --> 02:10:06.070
Like I'd be friends with these girls.
I knew him through him,
so they were like,

2318
02:10:06.071 --> 02:10:08.020
there were nice people then,
you know,

2319
02:10:08.050 --> 02:10:10.480
and I didn't have relationships with them so I was just talking to them and they

2320
02:10:10.481 --> 02:10:14.560
would tell me about these guys that they were hooking up with that would buy

2321
02:10:14.561 --> 02:10:18.720
them cars and shit and how they would do it.
So I visited him at work and a,

2322
02:10:18.721 --> 02:10:22.330
I'm like,
what's going on man?
And he's like,
ah,
nothing dude,
check this out.

2323
02:10:23.070 --> 02:10:25.510
You're going to talk to this girl.
And then her,

2324
02:10:25.540 --> 02:10:28.150
one of her clients when she comes in,
like you got it,

2325
02:10:28.151 --> 02:10:30.160
you got to see like this guy just bought her a truck.

2326
02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:33.600
He bought her like a Yukon Denali.
And so the girls hanging out,
you know,

2327
02:10:33.750 --> 02:10:35.930
hanging out with her friends and this guy comes in who was,

2328
02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:40.100
there's a classic story.
It was a wounded gazelle,
55 year old divorced guy.

2329
02:10:40.230 --> 02:10:43.820
Works for the post office coming in with his postal jacket on.
Okay.

2330
02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:48.410
As norm from cheers,
he bought her a $35,000 car man.
This guy,

2331
02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:51.470
he bought her a fucking Yukon Denali,
you know,
it was a nice car,

2332
02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:55.310
maybe $35,000 the wrong number.
I'm just throwing it out there,
whatever it is.

2333
02:10:55.311 --> 02:10:59.680
He bought her a new car,
so she sees him and she goes,
oh my God.

2334
02:11:01.740 --> 02:11:04.350
And she runs over like little baby steps,

2335
02:11:04.351 --> 02:11:07.440
like a girl and she's fucking naked man.
She's naked.
She's in her underwear.

2336
02:11:07.441 --> 02:11:11.160
She got a bikini on and she goes over and gives us guy a hug and you could see

2337
02:11:11.161 --> 02:11:12.960
this guy is defenseless.

2338
02:11:13.170 --> 02:11:17.910
There's no way in the world that a girl that looks like that would ever have

2339
02:11:17.911 --> 02:11:20.550
that kind of reaction to him.
So he's got to pay for that.

2340
02:11:20.650 --> 02:11:23.340
You've got to pay for that and you got to pay for it by buying her a car or

2341
02:11:23.341 --> 02:11:27.570
taking care of her fucking credit problem that she's got or you know,
whatever.

2342
02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:30.630
You got to figure out how to pay for that shit because there's no other way that

2343
02:11:30.631 --> 02:11:33.330
you're going to get that relationship.
But when I watched it,
I was like,

2344
02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:36.300
I looked at Eddie and he was like,
that's shit straight mercenary.
Right.

2345
02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:41.410
And I was like,
this is crazy.
Like they just,
they put a con game on these guides.

2346
02:11:41.780 --> 02:11:43.010
<v 1>I got a friend who's like,</v>

2347
02:11:43.011 --> 02:11:46.610
he seems to like make friends with rich people and now he's a good guy,

2348
02:11:46.611 --> 02:11:50.420
but it's weird.
And uh,
he says that if a few of these guys,

2349
02:11:50.810 --> 02:11:53.810
they'd really do take care of girls.

2350
02:11:53.811 --> 02:11:56.450
They've got like an apartment in New York that she lives in.

2351
02:11:56.750 --> 02:11:58.460
She gets a check every month.
I mean,

2352
02:11:58.461 --> 02:12:03.461
figure it costs them 50 grand a year and these are guys that have fucking $30

2353
02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:07.580
million.
So to have a relationship set up when,
when they come to town,

2354
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:10.850
they don't have to call an escort service and they don't have to go out and try

2355
02:12:10.851 --> 02:12:13.810
to make a straight relationship where they have to send flowers and call every

2356
02:12:13.811 --> 02:12:18.590
day they come to town.
She's fucking gorgeous,
know,
powerful,

2357
02:12:18.710 --> 02:12:19.520
confident.

2358
02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:24.050
It's all on the table and they've got like three city set up and it's,

2359
02:12:24.140 --> 02:12:26.060
and when,
when he comes to town,

2360
02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:31.240
she is a valuable 24 seven whatever the fuck he wants.

2361
02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:35.110
And I bet they have some kind of friendship underneath at all.
Maybe not.

2362
02:12:35.260 --> 02:12:39.320
<v 7>Well that would be great if it all worked out like that.
Right?
If,
if,</v>

2363
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:42.340
if that was the arrangement and it all worked out like that.
Right.

2364
02:12:42.370 --> 02:12:45.370
But the problem with people is there's no,

2365
02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:48.940
there's never really a static state maintains itself for any long periods of

2366
02:12:48.941 --> 02:12:50.440
time when it comes to relationships.

2367
02:12:50.650 --> 02:12:54.610
You're either kind of all in or you're a drift in and out of each other.

2368
02:12:55.210 --> 02:12:56.890
<v 1>She finds another guy,
Huh?
Yeah.</v>

2369
02:12:56.900 --> 02:12:59.840
<v 7>I mean people are weird.
They did.
It's very difficult to make.</v>

2370
02:12:59.841 --> 02:13:04.100
So how are you going to maintain the longterm prostitutional relationships right

2371
02:13:04.150 --> 02:13:07.730
here?
Not most likely.
They want people to begin with.
Yeah,

2372
02:13:07.790 --> 02:13:10.760
most likely mean you're painted out to be awesome and beautiful.

2373
02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:13.700
But the reality is that's not what the girl wants.

2374
02:13:13.701 --> 02:13:16.310
She wants to find a guy either if she wants someone to take care of her,

2375
02:13:16.311 --> 02:13:20.270
she wants to find a guide to take care of her and her lover and her boyfriend or

2376
02:13:20.271 --> 02:13:21.140
her husband or whatever.

2377
02:13:21.590 --> 02:13:24.920
And for this guy that thinks that he's going to like maintain it,

2378
02:13:24.930 --> 02:13:27.110
you're going to have to manage each one of these situations.

2379
02:13:27.380 --> 02:13:29.690
If you're some crazy CEO of some giant corporation,

2380
02:13:29.691 --> 02:13:32.100
you've got like four apartments scattered out across the country with chicks

2381
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:34.620
<v 0>living in them.
You got to maintain these positions.
Yeah.</v>

2382
02:13:34.690 --> 02:13:36.450
Like who's who's fucking her when you're not there,

2383
02:13:36.451 --> 02:13:39.860
what's happening is anybody planning your death,
you better be sure you know,
do,

2384
02:13:39.870 --> 02:13:42.150
what did you sign?
You sign anything crazy,
you know?

2385
02:13:42.151 --> 02:13:45.150
Does she have any photographs of your Dick?
Like give for a credit card?

2386
02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:48.510
Did you give her a credit card?
Well it's like you,
you,

2387
02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:51.810
you'd have to monitor these situations.
This ain't going to be a normal person.

2388
02:13:51.811 --> 02:13:54.900
It's going to be a person's willing to fuck you because you paid for them and

2389
02:13:54.901 --> 02:13:57.870
you know they might be crazy easily,
might be crazy.

2390
02:13:57.960 --> 02:13:58.830
<v 1>I heard this dude,</v>

2391
02:13:58.831 --> 02:14:03.270
I was at the w and a sitting in the lobby waiting and this is dude sitting next

2392
02:14:03.271 --> 02:14:07.520
to me and he's got an accent,
sound Scandinavian and he's going,
uh Oh fuck.

2393
02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:11.010
I get you on the phone.
You've,
it's so hard to reach lately baby.
Uh,
you know,

2394
02:14:11.011 --> 02:14:15.400
you know,
I,
I,
I'm so crazy,
but you're so beautiful.
I can't wait to get you out.

2395
02:14:15.660 --> 02:14:18.720
You need to stop going to college.
You come on,
I'd take care of.

2396
02:14:18.740 --> 02:14:21.210
He never met her and he was talking on the phone,

2397
02:14:21.211 --> 02:14:24.690
clearly met on some kind of high end dating service where you get women that you

2398
02:14:24.691 --> 02:14:25.590
take care of.

2399
02:14:25.830 --> 02:14:29.850
And she was flirting back and they were making plans for her to fly out for a

2400
02:14:29.850 --> 02:14:32.980
week.
He was going to take her to the best restaurants in La,
blah blah.

2401
02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.580
And I was telling her all the things he's going to bribe her with.
Right.

2402
02:14:35.581 --> 02:14:37.650
And he had seen her pictures online.

2403
02:14:37.651 --> 02:14:41.070
They had talked on the phone clearly a few times and he was closing.

2404
02:14:41.100 --> 02:14:43.290
He was making the arrangements to fly her out.
Okay.

2405
02:14:43.291 --> 02:14:45.380
Why do we have a problem with that?
Why does anybody have a pride?

2406
02:14:45.381 --> 02:14:48.240
I don't think anyone should ever shouldn't.
Right?
Eyes are opening up.

2407
02:14:48.241 --> 02:14:49.830
One's eyes are open.
I don't think,

2408
02:14:49.831 --> 02:14:53.250
I think all prostitution should be legalized.

2409
02:14:53.251 --> 02:14:56.310
I think that whorehouses should be legalized.
I think that having,

2410
02:14:56.430 --> 02:15:01.410
having horizontal street or having to go through Craig's list is,
it's horrible.

2411
02:15:01.411 --> 02:15:05.640
The reality is people are going to use Horace,
put it on the table,
legalize it,

2412
02:15:05.790 --> 02:15:10.440
make them get tested for STDs,
make sure they're keeping their money.

2413
02:15:10.441 --> 02:15:13.320
They're not getting fucking beaten up and uh,

2414
02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:15.660
and relationships like this should be fine.
Yeah.

2415
02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:20.180
<v 0>It's unbelievably fascinating that you have something that everybody wants and</v>

2416
02:15:20.181 --> 02:15:23.180
everybody gets for free.
But as soon as you attach money to it,

2417
02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:26.450
it has this massive stigma today.
Right?
Like,
you know,

2418
02:15:26.451 --> 02:15:29.510
saying that these prostitution and relationships aren't stable,

2419
02:15:30.890 --> 02:15:34.370
what relationships are,
you know,
are you,
you hook up with someone,

2420
02:15:34.371 --> 02:15:37.670
is that going to be stable if you just meet people randomly and have sex with

2421
02:15:37.671 --> 02:15:39.530
him?
He agreed to have sex with each other.
Is that going to be stable?

2422
02:15:39.531 --> 02:15:41.420
You sure it might not be stable either.

2423
02:15:41.630 --> 02:15:43.580
You might run into instability every way you turn,

2424
02:15:43.730 --> 02:15:46.610
but the main reason why we have all these negativity,

2425
02:15:47.030 --> 02:15:50.460
negative ideas attached to the idea of prostitution is because

2426
02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:54.170
<v 1>it's illegal.
What if you hookup one night with a cheque?
You bought dinner,</v>

2427
02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:57.290
you bought drinks,
you paid for the cab,
back to the apartment,

2428
02:15:57.320 --> 02:15:59.900
you spent all the money.
You guys,
fuck.

2429
02:16:00.260 --> 02:16:02.930
How is that different than handing a girl money and having sex with her?

2430
02:16:03.030 --> 02:16:05.640
<v 0>How about all those things are just you dating and there's nothing wrong with</v>

2431
02:16:05.641 --> 02:16:08.870
being nice and being nice to someone and taking a friend out or to drive in them

2432
02:16:08.980 --> 02:16:11.100
around taking them to a nice restaurant.
Nothing wrong with that.

2433
02:16:11.490 --> 02:16:14.970
But then what does she says,
I've got this situation,
um,

2434
02:16:15.060 --> 02:16:18.090
I'm three months more than my rent and I don't know what to do.
And you're like,

2435
02:16:18.091 --> 02:16:19.540
look,
I'll just take care of it.
Right?

2436
02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:22.500
And you write her a check and then she sucked your Dick.
What happened there?

2437
02:16:22.650 --> 02:16:25.530
Right?
What happened there?
Did you pay for her to Suck Your Dick?
We don't know.

2438
02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:28.470
She might've talked to Dick Anyway.
It might've been like,
listen baby,

2439
02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:29.590
you know you don't get money from me,

2440
02:16:29.591 --> 02:16:32.830
but you do get Dick and you pull your dick out and then she blows you.

2441
02:16:32.860 --> 02:16:35.680
That's different.
Right,
but most guys can't pull that off.
What about,

2442
02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:41.020
what about a marriage where the wife does that work has never earned a dime.

2443
02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:42.370
She's having sex with you.

2444
02:16:43.330 --> 02:16:46.630
That's prostitution according to some people according to some people.

2445
02:16:46.631 --> 02:16:50.830
It's certainly is.
I mean of to a lot of male feminists it would be.
Right,
right.

2446
02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:54.550
Yeah.
I mean it's,
it's money coming in sex going out.

2447
02:16:54.850 --> 02:16:58.600
I mean if that's what you want to look at,
but it's agreements.

2448
02:16:58.750 --> 02:17:02.080
It's the problem is the idea of money.
It's agreements where you,

2449
02:17:02.140 --> 02:17:04.810
that's where the idea of prostitution sort of,

2450
02:17:04.870 --> 02:17:08.170
it comes down to what it comes down to is are people having sex with people that

2451
02:17:08.171 --> 02:17:11.920
they might not necessarily have been willing to without any benefit,

2452
02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:15.640
but that benefit exists so they are willing to do it.
Is that prostitution?

2453
02:17:15.790 --> 02:17:19.830
Because if it,
if that benefit is only money,
then you're,

2454
02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:24.400
you're defining sex for something as sex for money.
That's prostitution,

2455
02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:25.870
but everything is sex for something.

2456
02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:28.570
Like you were talking about the Ferrari thing before.

2457
02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:33.840
If you're at a club and you see a guy pull up in a Ferrari and you go home with

2458
02:17:34.331 --> 02:17:38.650
that guy,
part of the reason you went home with him is you saw the Ferrari.

2459
02:17:38.651 --> 02:17:40.570
There's not dollars exchanged,

2460
02:17:40.750 --> 02:17:45.750
but there is an implicit understanding this dude's got money and he spends it

2461
02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:49.270
like a fucking lunatic.
Yup.
And you want to be around that.

2462
02:17:49.271 --> 02:17:51.580
That's a good point that he spends it like a fucking lunatic.

2463
02:17:51.581 --> 02:17:54.880
That's a great point because that's really what it is.
A guy who's so flashy,

2464
02:17:54.881 --> 02:17:56.830
he's driving a $250,000 car.

2465
02:17:57.190 --> 02:17:59.650
He's not going to hesitate to give you a couple grand here and there,
right.

2466
02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:01.810
You know,
you want to buy a new pair of shoes.
He's like,
here,

2467
02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:04.130
I don't fucking peels off some hundreds,
right?

2468
02:18:04.150 --> 02:18:06.400
Gives you a kiss on the cheek and goes back to doing business.

2469
02:18:06.490 --> 02:18:11.050
<v 1>Buy,
sell,
buy,
sell
some crazy.</v>

2470
02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:14.420
Right?
Multimillionaire Maniac banker.
Dude in.

2471
02:18:15.070 --> 02:18:17.110
It's a party and you just got invited.

2472
02:18:17.140 --> 02:18:20.950
You're going to be around here as fucking this guy who doesn't give a shit about

2473
02:18:20.951 --> 02:18:21.281
money.

2474
02:18:21.281 --> 02:18:25.090
He knows he's gonna die soon because he's on Adderall and he's chain smoking and

2475
02:18:25.091 --> 02:18:28.510
he's a drunk,
and wherever you go,
you're eating the best steaks.

2476
02:18:28.511 --> 02:18:32.080
You're getting into the best clubs.
Life is fucking good.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

2477
02:18:32.470 --> 02:18:35.800
<v 0>And I'm fucking him.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're,
there's that at the end of the night,</v>

2478
02:18:35.801 --> 02:18:38.860
Ivan's wife and every,
when you show up at the country club,
oh,

2479
02:18:38.861 --> 02:18:42.870
Ms Nick Blevin priests come on in and you've got a little poodle with you and

2480
02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:47.650
you fucking walking your $3,000 shoes and you waddle in there and take your

2481
02:18:47.651 --> 02:18:49.750
tennis lesson,
your tennis player fucking bones,

2482
02:18:49.751 --> 02:18:54.160
you in the locker room and he knows it.
Then the husband says,
bring them over.

2483
02:18:54.190 --> 02:18:58.050
I want to watch.
Oh,
Jesus thanked.
It's ugly.
A lot of guys won't do that,
bro.

2484
02:18:58.180 --> 02:18:59.980
I don't think that's a normal thing.
No,

2485
02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:03.010
I don't think that's a watching a lot of the watch.
That's a weird thing.

2486
02:19:03.011 --> 02:19:07.600
And then the cuckold porn,
just Latino.
Cut The a point.
Where do you find that?

2487
02:19:07.601 --> 02:19:10.930
I haven't really typing cuckold porn.
Don't do it Brian.

2488
02:19:11.350 --> 02:19:14.740
But if he can you tell if it's real or not?
No,
of course not.

2489
02:19:14.770 --> 02:19:18.100
But it's casting couch is fucking real.
I don't care what anybody says.

2490
02:19:18.130 --> 02:19:20.260
Sometimes it's real.
Sometimes it's not.

2491
02:19:20.500 --> 02:19:24.070
The main thing is before they do anything,
they have to sign like agreements,

2492
02:19:24.750 --> 02:19:28.150
STD tests to get tested.
So that's reason why because legally

2493
02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:32.180
<v 2>they have to get a test within 30 days of the book or was that just in</v>

2494
02:19:32.181 --> 02:19:35.240
California and aren't a lot of these done in other states where the water in

2495
02:19:35.241 --> 02:19:37.520
Arizona,
you know,
laws are different all over the country.

2496
02:19:37.670 --> 02:19:40.700
All I know is on just one sir.
There's one certain guy,

2497
02:19:40.701 --> 02:19:44.870
the famous guys got the black leather couch.
He but he blots out his face,

2498
02:19:45.320 --> 02:19:47.690
they come in and it's one shot.
There is,

2499
02:19:47.840 --> 02:19:51.380
you can tell by the way it's cut together,
that conversation,

2500
02:19:51.381 --> 02:19:54.050
that whole sequence of events is not edited.

2501
02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:58.460
There's no fucking missing minutes there.
And,
and I'll tell you right now,

2502
02:19:58.700 --> 02:20:03.700
you could not get a of what you could and love it.

2503
02:20:06.170 --> 02:20:10.940
You could not get the Cate Blanchett to come in and perform in a way that says

2504
02:20:10.941 --> 02:20:12.380
hello in a nervous way,

2505
02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:15.470
gets brought through the various steps of I have to take my clothes off.

2506
02:20:15.500 --> 02:20:18.320
I have to suck your Dick.
I'm telling you,
these women,
you know,

2507
02:20:18.321 --> 02:20:22.620
porn actress can't act right.
This shit is real and it's all I watch.
Well,

2508
02:20:22.621 --> 02:20:27.550
maybe I fucking love it because it's real man.
When you see that,

2509
02:20:27.710 --> 02:20:30.890
when you see the confusion and the slight fear in her eyes when she gets on her

2510
02:20:30.891 --> 02:20:34.670
knees and this guy's office,
I don't know why,
but that appeals to me.
Well,

2511
02:20:34.710 --> 02:20:37.940
it appeals to you because you're a nice guy and because you respect women,

2512
02:20:40.060 --> 02:20:40.731
that's what it is.

2513
02:20:40.731 --> 02:20:43.250
And you know that that experience is never going to happen to you in your life.

2514
02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:47.750
Wish that at one point in time you could be that animal that pulls out his giant

2515
02:20:47.760 --> 02:20:49.460
ticket.
You want to suck it.
You want to suck at.

2516
02:20:49.461 --> 02:20:52.840
Come here once you show me how you suck that Dick.
Oh yeah,

2517
02:20:52.900 --> 02:20:56.780
I wish I could do that.
But you rent the office.
You wouldn't do that.

2518
02:20:56.781 --> 02:21:00.050
If the girl came into your office,
she'd be like,
okay,
you're very beautiful,

2519
02:21:00.110 --> 02:21:02.120
but look,
if you really were going to do porn,

2520
02:21:02.121 --> 02:21:03.770
do you know how bad that would fuck up your life?

2521
02:21:04.290 --> 02:21:07.880
Your parents would be so disappointed if I was your father,
I'd be so upset.

2522
02:21:08.690 --> 02:21:11.150
Please get out of here.
Don't do porn.
That's what you would do.

2523
02:21:11.180 --> 02:21:13.340
You wouldn't be that animal.
Not only that,

2524
02:21:13.341 --> 02:21:17.870
this guy ahead of time rented an office,
bought video,

2525
02:21:17.871 --> 02:21:22.330
cameras them up.
Yeah,
that's the guy and you know it.

2526
02:21:22.410 --> 02:21:25.010
It wasn't like it's Brian.
Don't don't show

2527
02:21:26.570 --> 02:21:31.550
a girl were to come up to you in a hoary way and you took advantage of it.

2528
02:21:31.820 --> 02:21:33.530
That's fucking bad.
But this is,

2529
02:21:33.531 --> 02:21:36.590
it's like the difference between murder and premeditated murder.
Well,

2530
02:21:36.610 --> 02:21:40.460
you know what,
it's just more wounded.
Antelopes man,
ain't nothing wrong with it.

2531
02:21:40.461 --> 02:21:41.840
I mean,
there's nothing wrong with,

2532
02:21:41.841 --> 02:21:46.310
if you're a guy and you have an office and you get some adult female to come

2533
02:21:46.311 --> 02:21:50.540
over and blow you on film because she wants to be a porn star lying and you're

2534
02:21:50.541 --> 02:21:52.690
telling her that you're going to get her work with the,

2535
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:55.850
that's the whole caveat is he says he's going to get them work and he's not

2536
02:21:56.220 --> 02:22:00.350
douchey.
You shouldn't be jerking off to that.
Right.
I know.

2537
02:22:00.650 --> 02:22:05.510
I swear to you.
I try other ones.
I try,
I'm going to try this a,
I'm cuckold porn.

2538
02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:09.410
You don't want to.
Um,
I had a friend who was out,

2539
02:22:09.411 --> 02:22:12.260
he went to this club and a,
or a party rather,

2540
02:22:12.261 --> 02:22:15.820
and he met this guy and his wife and the guy,
uh,

2541
02:22:15.980 --> 02:22:19.100
but like pushed the wife towards him and said,
you know,

2542
02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:22.730
he's your type like talk to him.
And my friend was like,
what the fuck?

2543
02:22:22.731 --> 02:22:25.980
Like thinking of the husband was going to be jealous.
And she was like,
no,
he

2544
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:29.760
<v 7>likes me to hook up with guys.
And he was like,
what?
And she was like,
yeah,
yeah,</v>

2545
02:22:29.761 --> 02:22:31.800
he likes me too.
And he like,
he,
he'll,
he'll,
uh,

2546
02:22:31.830 --> 02:22:33.540
he'll let me blow you in front of him.

2547
02:22:33.870 --> 02:22:38.010
And so they're outside sitting on a porch and his wife starts sucking his dick

2548
02:22:38.190 --> 02:22:41.370
and he's telling his wife had to do it,
like rub his balls,
were always balls,

2549
02:22:41.371 --> 02:22:45.120
maybe go deeper,
go deeper baby.
And he goes,
and I come in this girl's mouth,

2550
02:22:45.300 --> 02:22:49.080
and I was,
he was,
I couldn't have run away.

2551
02:22:49.660 --> 02:22:50.490
<v 1>Correct.</v>

2552
02:22:50.490 --> 02:22:52.920
<v 7>He goes,
I was just so horrified after it was over.</v>

2553
02:22:52.921 --> 02:22:57.300
It's like the creepiness of it all wasn't even,
it wasn't even available to him.

2554
02:22:57.600 --> 02:23:02.190
It's silly.
Nutted in this woman's mouth while the husband is saying,
uh,
you know,

2555
02:23:02.280 --> 02:23:05.550
like,
I think the husband might even said to him,
coming around,
cum in her mouth,

2556
02:23:05.551 --> 02:23:08.790
and he was like,
wait a minute,
what?
You can tell?
Like it was weird,

2557
02:23:09.060 --> 02:23:11.940
I guess when he was telling the woman what to do to him,

2558
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:16.080
but when he told him what to do with the woman calming or mouth,
and he was like,

2559
02:23:16.110 --> 02:23:18.330
oh my God,
this is the craziest fucking experience ever.

2560
02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:21.030
And he said it was like one of those things where,
uh,

2561
02:23:21.060 --> 02:23:23.320
Eddie Bravo has that expression,
uh,

2562
02:23:23.370 --> 02:23:27.870
post nuts syndrome after you come.
It's almost like postpartum.

2563
02:23:27.871 --> 02:23:30.990
Like women get depressed sometimes after they give babies like this guys,

2564
02:23:30.991 --> 02:23:33.180
you get depressed after they come because they realize like,

2565
02:23:33.181 --> 02:23:36.570
what did I let my Dick talk me into?
Oh my God,
I get out of here.
He goes,

2566
02:23:36.571 --> 02:23:41.220
I've never had a worse expression.
Expression of that post nuts syndrome.
Yeah.

2567
02:23:41.660 --> 02:23:45.750
Yeah.
He,
the dude just run away from it.
He's a really good looking young guys,

2568
02:23:45.751 --> 02:23:47.490
an actor and I guess,

2569
02:23:47.640 --> 02:23:52.620
I guess it was probably one of those things where he had never like been around

2570
02:23:52.621 --> 02:23:54.930
anything like that before and he didn't even know it was real.

2571
02:23:55.050 --> 02:23:56.610
And then I'll like,
before he knows it,

2572
02:23:56.640 --> 02:23:59.070
this woman who's really hot and the guy seems really nice,

2573
02:23:59.280 --> 02:24:04.280
is blowing him in front of her husband on a porch party in the dark,

2574
02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:07.380
just nestled into a corner,
you know,

2575
02:24:07.381 --> 02:24:10.830
like chairs turned sideways to the husband's looking out to make sure nobody

2576
02:24:10.831 --> 02:24:15.450
walks down the hallway and she's sucking his deck and he comes in her mouth and

2577
02:24:15.451 --> 02:24:18.000
the guy's giving him instruction,
cum in her mouth coming around.
He's like,
what?

2578
02:24:18.030 --> 02:24:20.370
Wait a minute.
So as he's nutting,

2579
02:24:20.371 --> 02:24:23.100
he's thinking about a guy telling him to come and he was like,
oh,

2580
02:24:23.101 --> 02:24:23.640
I got to get the phone.

2581
02:24:23.640 --> 02:24:27.810
<v 1>Got It.
Here.
I remember my worst one.
My word,
postpartum nut.</v>

2582
02:24:27.870 --> 02:24:31.410
Postnet syndrome.
Eddie Bravo.
Trade Mac.
Trademark word.

2583
02:24:31.830 --> 02:24:34.800
My worst post nuts syndrome does Dave Attell.
Should we take it

2584
02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:39.200
<v 7>powerful.
Take it,
take it,
put it up to the speaker phone.</v>

2585
02:24:39.490 --> 02:24:40.323
<v 1>Hello.</v>

2586
02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:43.273
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2587
02:24:43.390 --> 02:24:45.210
<v 7>It's not,
it's not David Salle.</v>

2588
02:24:45.430 --> 02:24:45.780
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

2589
02:24:45.780 --> 02:24:50.780
<v 1>no,
I hung up.
It's a girl.
He's the only girls.
Oh,
that's it.</v>

2590
02:24:51.420 --> 02:24:54.770
He,
I don't know why he's like the only unknown.
Holly's phone blocked.
Yeah,

2591
02:24:54.860 --> 02:24:58.040
he's crazy.
But my worry.
So I was in Spain,

2592
02:24:58.041 --> 02:25:02.210
I was 18 years old and I was in May,
Orca by myself and uh,

2593
02:25:02.510 --> 02:25:07.220
it was fucking snowing and may arc or for the first time in 40 years.
And so,
uh,

2594
02:25:07.460 --> 02:25:10.280
I'm staying in this shitty hoods.
I had been in Denmark,

2595
02:25:10.281 --> 02:25:14.150
I was traveling around Europe for like six months by myself and uh,
they,

2596
02:25:14.151 --> 02:25:18.050
it was fucking freezing in Denmark and there were these tour packages,
you know,

2597
02:25:18.051 --> 02:25:21.830
like how did you can go to The Bahamas for like no money and includes a hotel

2598
02:25:21.831 --> 02:25:25.930
room.
It was like one of those where it was like 250 bucks to go to New York and

2599
02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:30.460
fucking hotel.
So I go and it's like the sleaziest,
cockroach ridden,

2600
02:25:30.461 --> 02:25:31.180
rundown,

2601
02:25:31.180 --> 02:25:36.130
Moldy hotel and I'm sitting in the bar and I'm just drinking away the sadness

2602
02:25:36.131 --> 02:25:39.610
because I thought I was escaping a Denmark to gets,

2603
02:25:39.650 --> 02:25:42.850
I was going to lay out the sun and it's fucking snowing.

2604
02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:48.120
And so I get drunk and the bartender is this nasty old Spanish wench and I get

2605
02:25:50.141 --> 02:25:51.430
so drunk that I go,

2606
02:25:51.431 --> 02:25:56.380
she's got a room in the hotel and I go in there and it's like this sad sheetless

2607
02:25:56.381 --> 02:26:00.130
mattress and I have just horrible sex with her.

2608
02:26:00.460 --> 02:26:05.170
And then I had that nut that postdocs goes nuts syndrome real because then you

2609
02:26:05.171 --> 02:26:08.920
wake up,
hung over and you wonder do you have a disease?
And then I,

2610
02:26:08.921 --> 02:26:13.900
and then the next night I walked past her room and I hear her going at it with

2611
02:26:13.901 --> 02:26:17.500
another guy and I brought the nuts syndrome back again.

2612
02:26:17.700 --> 02:26:21.870
<v 0>Oh my God.
Did you wash your Dick?
Scrub it?</v>

2613
02:26:22.750 --> 02:26:26.370
Did you catch anything?
No.
Wow.
Amazing that that girl is clean.

2614
02:26:26.490 --> 02:26:30.950
But some 20 year old college girl,
Debbie commedia.
Right.
Oh,
crazy.
Yup.

2615
02:26:31.300 --> 02:26:32.133
We'll be honest.

2616
02:26:32.730 --> 02:26:36.040
<v 2>Have you watched porn with a,
a girl with another girl,
but the girl,</v>

2617
02:26:36.041 --> 02:26:39.930
the other girl has it Dick.
So instead of a guy fucking a girl,
it's uh,
yeah.

2618
02:26:39.931 --> 02:26:43.980
I don't enjoy that transgender woman or that's pretty hot.

2619
02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:48.480
That doesn't sound hot.
Like a woman who had a penis added onto her?
No,
no,
no.

2620
02:26:48.481 --> 02:26:51.060
It's a woman,
a man who's becoming a woman,

2621
02:26:51.061 --> 02:26:55.770
so just got fake tits man with fake tits.
Oh.
Oh God.
It looks like a woman.

2622
02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:59.340
Really,
but with a Dick,
you like that.
What's better than than guy girl?

2623
02:26:59.341 --> 02:27:01.620
Because he could see boobs and it looks like two girls.

2624
02:27:02.700 --> 02:27:06.640
You keep saying this and it's still not great if you looked at that.
No,

2625
02:27:06.660 --> 02:27:09.830
it's not good.
You said this more than once,
so disagrees.

2626
02:27:09.950 --> 02:27:12.150
You would rather see a guy than a ridiculous idea.

2627
02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:15.290
<v 0>You know?
I know what you're trying to</v>

2628
02:27:19.490 --> 02:27:20.323
stop.

2629
02:27:23.170 --> 02:27:26.340
<v 2>Brian.
Brian,
what is it?</v>

2630
02:27:26.410 --> 02:27:31.060
Here's the thing about Brian is you're a fucked up dude,
right?

2631
02:27:31.270 --> 02:27:34.570
You put out,
you put out a lot of fucked up stuff about yourself.

2632
02:27:34.571 --> 02:27:36.010
Like you say things like that,

2633
02:27:36.250 --> 02:27:40.440
and we know your sex life and you get your nicotine thing and he smoked pot and

2634
02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:44.830
and your film.
You're a filthy deviant,
right?
Yeah.
On paper,

2635
02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:46.120
you put that out.

2636
02:27:46.690 --> 02:27:50.590
I think there's a weirder guy underneath it that you're even hiding with this

2637
02:27:50.591 --> 02:27:55.300
persona.
What are you talking to the moon?
Cause I think he's a really dark,

2638
02:27:55.450 --> 02:27:59.560
dark dude.
I pretty much say all the dark shit I do though.
Yeah.
Wait a minute.

2639
02:27:59.561 --> 02:28:01.330
Why do you say that?
He's not dark,
dark.

2640
02:28:01.390 --> 02:28:04.240
You don't think he's that does a sweetheart.
Brian's a sweetheart.

2641
02:28:04.540 --> 02:28:08.950
I just mean sexually.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I don't know Brian.

2642
02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:14.140
He likes porn and he likes girls.
He's like one of the easiest going guys ever.

2643
02:28:14.770 --> 02:28:18.170
Like Brian has.
There's nothing like dark in there.
No,
no.

2644
02:28:18.430 --> 02:28:22.130
It's not going to kill anybody.
Oh No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2645
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:26.320
<v 7>He's saying he doesn't even get mad at him.
He would cry.
He's a crier.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2646
02:28:26.340 --> 02:28:30.100
Sweetheart cried the other day at the comedy store.
He's a sweet guy.
All right,

2647
02:28:30.110 --> 02:28:34.820
I see you in a hall.
Yeah,
you can't think of them that way.
People get,
look,

2648
02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:38.460
he look,
here's what he is.
He's a Weirdo.
You know?
And when,

2649
02:28:38.461 --> 02:28:40.430
when you meet a Weirdo there,

2650
02:28:40.431 --> 02:28:43.280
what they are is something that doesn't fit into your box.
So you'd go,
ah,

2651
02:28:43.281 --> 02:28:45.390
I bet there's something going on there that I'm missing.
Yeah,

2652
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:48.980
I know the dude pretty well.
He's not,
he's just a Weirdo,
but we're all Weirdos.

2653
02:28:49.190 --> 02:28:51.500
But his Weirdo is like,
it's very difficult to categorize.

2654
02:28:51.501 --> 02:28:53.930
It's very difficult to put into a box.
What is Brian?

2655
02:28:53.980 --> 02:28:57.910
<v 1>Well,
here's the crazy thing about Brian is I don't know what your future holds</v>

2656
02:28:58.180 --> 02:29:01.660
because I know you spend all your fucking money and I think you're making decent

2657
02:29:01.661 --> 02:29:01.871
money.

2658
02:29:01.871 --> 02:29:06.460
You're working with rogue and this is a exploding a medium that you guys are

2659
02:29:06.461 --> 02:29:09.730
involved in and it's not a big crew.
And I know Joe's generous,

2660
02:29:09.880 --> 02:29:13.210
so I know you're making decent cash and you saved none of it.

2661
02:29:13.540 --> 02:29:15.460
And I think about your future sometimes.

2662
02:29:15.540 --> 02:29:18.930
<v 7>Why would you have a why?
What's all this negativity?
Think about its future.</v>

2663
02:29:18.960 --> 02:29:23.160
Let's stop and think about this way.
Okay.
Without blowing up anybody spot.

2664
02:29:23.640 --> 02:29:26.370
He does very well.
Yeah.
Like with girls,

2665
02:29:26.460 --> 02:29:31.460
he lives a ridiculous leisure life of comedy and podcasts and laughing and being

2666
02:29:31.681 --> 02:29:35.040
stoned all the time.
Yeah.
He's having sex when he wants it.

2667
02:29:35.650 --> 02:29:38.520
He like,
you can't buy that,
right?

2668
02:29:38.570 --> 02:29:42.170
Like if you wanted to like pay for that subscription and like you wanted to
fill,

2669
02:29:42.190 --> 02:29:44.730
fulfill that lifestyle,
like how,
how would you even work that out?

2670
02:29:45.180 --> 02:29:46.950
It would be really hard to engineer.

2671
02:29:47.220 --> 02:29:51.300
That's a fucking very difficult job to pull up and to be silly like he's been,

2672
02:29:51.780 --> 02:29:53.120
this isn't wrong there.
He just,

2673
02:29:53.121 --> 02:29:55.890
he's not fitting into your one or stand when your standard paradigm.

2674
02:29:55.930 --> 02:29:57.470
<v 1>Yeah,
I'm puzzled by it.</v>

2675
02:29:57.800 --> 02:30:01.990
<v 7>Yeah,
but you shouldn't be Brian.
He's,
he's silly.
He is who he is,</v>

2676
02:30:01.991 --> 02:30:04.900
but there's nothing wrong.
Maybe I'm jealous.
That's exactly what it is.

2677
02:30:04.930 --> 02:30:07.060
He's getting the got jealous,
jealous of him all the time.

2678
02:30:07.150 --> 02:30:08.630
You're like the opposite of May.

2679
02:30:08.740 --> 02:30:11.380
<v 1>You don't have a lot of responsibility.
You're in the moment.
Yeah,</v>

2680
02:30:11.620 --> 02:30:13.930
<v 7>but why is that bad?
Because everyone's going to die.
Dude.</v>

2681
02:30:13.940 --> 02:30:15.310
What's one of the things we talked about earlier?

2682
02:30:15.460 --> 02:30:18.190
Why is it bad for him to be living this way?
You know,

2683
02:30:18.191 --> 02:30:19.450
one of the things that I've always said,

2684
02:30:19.570 --> 02:30:23.410
I have a real issue with people that want to tell me or tell anybody.

2685
02:30:23.411 --> 02:30:25.750
I used to have it before I had kids and I still have it now.

2686
02:30:25.870 --> 02:30:29.680
They want to tell you that you need to do something like you need to grow up or

2687
02:30:29.770 --> 02:30:32.070
you need to have kids.
You had kids you'd understand,
right?

2688
02:30:32.080 --> 02:30:35.500
You don't need to have kids.
Guess what?
You can be a great person without kids.
I,

2689
02:30:35.550 --> 02:30:38.830
uh,
enjoy having kids.
I love my kids.
I love having a family.

2690
02:30:38.831 --> 02:30:42.670
I love the whole process.
But if you don't want to do it,

2691
02:30:42.700 --> 02:30:45.340
there's nothing wrong with that.
Anybody who doesn't want to,

2692
02:30:45.341 --> 02:30:49.990
you can absolutely contribute to society just as much.
If you're not a parent,

2693
02:30:50.200 --> 02:30:52.810
you can put out as much energy as you want,

2694
02:30:52.930 --> 02:30:56.990
put out as much good and love and fun and,
and reach as many David ground road

2695
02:30:57.250 --> 02:30:59.530
<v 1>badness by not having a kid when you shouldn't</v>

2696
02:30:59.630 --> 02:31:03.230
<v 7>or not or not.
You know,
maybe you'd have a kid in your life would change around.</v>

2697
02:31:03.240 --> 02:31:06.440
You'd be a better person and you'd be more giving because you really love this

2698
02:31:06.441 --> 02:31:09.710
kid and it opens up the sort of door of compassion inside your soul.

2699
02:31:09.890 --> 02:31:11.630
That's a possibility too.
And I've seen both.

2700
02:31:11.960 --> 02:31:15.500
But the idea that you need to do anything stupid and people just always telling

2701
02:31:15.501 --> 02:31:18.950
me that you're like,
oh,
you need to grow up.
You need to grow up to do,

2702
02:31:19.260 --> 02:31:23.040
to die to what?
To fall into line to fucking follow a pattern.

2703
02:31:23.160 --> 02:31:25.950
You don't need to do anything.
Nobody to do anything.
You need to breathe.

2704
02:31:26.160 --> 02:31:27.060
You need to eat food.

2705
02:31:27.090 --> 02:31:30.030
The rest of his is the structure that we've sort of invented to sort of give

2706
02:31:30.031 --> 02:31:32.270
ourselves something to do.
When we wake up in the morning,
well,

2707
02:31:32.530 --> 02:31:36.420
I am tying to go to work.
Work's not real.
The car's not real.
Life's not real.

2708
02:31:36.540 --> 02:31:39.030
This is what's real heartbeats.
And when those bitches stop,

2709
02:31:39.060 --> 02:31:44.060
all that shit that you created and stockpiled and worked for means not thing.

2710
02:31:45.240 --> 02:31:48.330
These are objects that don't even exist when you're dead.
When you're dead,

2711
02:31:48.331 --> 02:31:50.940
you're gonna go to another dimension where you can't take this shit with you,

2712
02:31:51.210 --> 02:31:53.130
you know,
or not,
or delights just shut off.

2713
02:31:53.360 --> 02:31:56.510
<v 2>This is why you took LSD and I didn't.
I haven't accepted death.</v>

2714
02:31:56.930 --> 02:32:00.180
You've embraced death.
Well.
Are you working backwards from it?

2715
02:32:00.181 --> 02:32:02.870
Are you willing to do a psychedelic?
I think I am.

2716
02:32:03.570 --> 02:32:06.140
Would you be willing to do I think I would do anything.

2717
02:32:06.170 --> 02:32:09.320
Would you do something under like a clinical setting or would you be willing to

2718
02:32:09.321 --> 02:32:11.510
get dirty and go out to Joshua Tree and take mushrooms?

2719
02:32:11.540 --> 02:32:13.550
I would need to be led by a shaman.

2720
02:32:13.580 --> 02:32:17.750
I'd have to be with somebody like you or I got a few people that I would take it

2721
02:32:17.751 --> 02:32:20.240
with so things go wrong.
They could get me back.

2722
02:32:20.360 --> 02:32:24.110
<v 7>I could take one person through some experiences,</v>

2723
02:32:24.300 --> 02:32:27.440
but it would have to really know that you wanted to do it and I would have to

2724
02:32:27.441 --> 02:32:30.530
really trust you.
You are really trust and I know you can handle shit.

2725
02:32:30.890 --> 02:32:32.780
You know like I trust you implicitly.

2726
02:32:32.840 --> 02:32:34.460
Like I would never worry about you freaking out,

2727
02:32:34.910 --> 02:32:39.860
but you have to be real careful who you introduced these things too because I

2728
02:32:39.861 --> 02:32:43.190
think without a doubt psychedelic experiences should be something that someone

2729
02:32:43.191 --> 02:32:48.020
is chasing and you certainly shouldn't promote it to someone who isn't chasing

2730
02:32:48.021 --> 02:32:50.390
it and try to push it on them.
If they're not chasing,

2731
02:32:50.391 --> 02:32:51.800
you have to be going towards it.
Yeah,

2732
02:32:51.801 --> 02:32:55.790
I joke around about that all the time and I just want to like,
I never,

2733
02:32:55.910 --> 02:32:58.220
I mean I joke around about you,
you know what you need to do.

2734
02:32:58.221 --> 02:33:01.280
You do need to do mushrooms,
mother fucker.
All right,
I'll joke around about that.

2735
02:33:01.400 --> 02:33:04.100
But the reality is you shouldn't do mushrooms unless you want to do mushrooms.

2736
02:33:04.430 --> 02:33:06.950
If you have this desire to try to experience that,

2737
02:33:06.951 --> 02:33:10.100
if you have this intense desire to find out what's on the other side,

2738
02:33:10.550 --> 02:33:12.430
then you do it.
But if you don't,
is it

2739
02:33:12.430 --> 02:33:15.040
<v 2>creative person?
I'm always looking for a way,</v>

2740
02:33:15.041 --> 02:33:18.160
I mean it's like Jim Morrison and the doors were called the door is because it

2741
02:33:18.161 --> 02:33:20.590
was based on a poem by,
uh,
Blake.

2742
02:33:20.830 --> 02:33:25.830
That is that that drugs can be the doorway to knowledge,

2743
02:33:25.990 --> 02:33:29.790
to understanding what we said earlier about Carl Sagan,
Carl Sagan quote,
right?

2744
02:33:29.850 --> 02:33:31.210
I mean,
that's what [inaudible] was saying.

2745
02:33:31.211 --> 02:33:33.670
He found beneficial drugs that don't impede your health.

2746
02:33:33.671 --> 02:33:35.800
That's what he found in marijuana was a big one.
Right.

2747
02:33:35.830 --> 02:33:37.840
He says smoked pot and fucking look through telescopes.

2748
02:33:37.860 --> 02:33:42.860
I mean was it was one of the most influential scientific minds of our generation

2749
02:33:43.090 --> 02:33:45.230
or any generation.
Yeah.
I mean he,

2750
02:33:45.231 --> 02:33:47.620
he was the voice of Science in the 20th century.

2751
02:33:47.650 --> 02:33:51.190
I mean he's a fucking incredible human being.
And he was a pothead.
Yeah.

2752
02:33:51.191 --> 02:33:53.660
And I think cocaine is also something that can be a,

2753
02:33:53.661 --> 02:33:57.100
a pot like I think it's not as,
it's not as addictive as a lot of other drugs.

2754
02:33:57.101 --> 02:34:00.100
And I think for young people to really go out and really have the night of their

2755
02:34:00.101 --> 02:34:03.280
life,
they should.
And like you said,
it shouldn't be forced on them.

2756
02:34:03.430 --> 02:34:06.310
But if you embrace coke on your prom night and say I'm going to fucking,

2757
02:34:06.311 --> 02:34:09.760
I'm going to drink champagne and you're going to have an amazing night and

2758
02:34:09.761 --> 02:34:12.950
you're not,
or you're in jail for fucking murder,
you know,

2759
02:34:12.970 --> 02:34:14.170
that's a possibility too.

2760
02:34:14.171 --> 02:34:17.200
I've been around people that are on coke and I've never done it myself,

2761
02:34:17.230 --> 02:34:18.100
but I don't like it.

2762
02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:22.410
<v 7>I don't like that crazy speedy up thing where they're dangerous.</v>

2763
02:34:22.530 --> 02:34:25.900
<v 2>Well cause a lot of times you're snorting speed is the problem cause it's</v>

2764
02:34:25.901 --> 02:34:29.980
stepped on so many times.
But if you know you're getting real coke,
I mean,

2765
02:34:29.981 --> 02:34:34.330
how many cultures,
uh,
chew on coca leaf.
That's true.
That's true.
And that's it.

2766
02:34:34.380 --> 02:34:37.560
<v 7>Very different psychoactive experience.
And the process cocaine though,</v>

2767
02:34:37.561 --> 02:34:38.730
we should be really clear on that.

2768
02:34:38.731 --> 02:34:41.610
I remember just thinking to try and that cocoa leaves are safe and they're

2769
02:34:41.730 --> 02:34:44.790
addictive.
Might get emotional.
He me get addicted to beaten off.

2770
02:34:44.791 --> 02:34:47.220
You get addicted to anything.
It's just a psychological addiction.

2771
02:34:47.221 --> 02:34:49.350
But as far as physical addiction,
I don't believe it.

2772
02:34:49.351 --> 02:34:52.070
Those coca leaves are addictive.
I think they have a better,
um,

2773
02:34:52.440 --> 02:34:56.400
health profile than,
um,
a lot of things that we take on a regular basis.

2774
02:34:56.790 --> 02:34:59.570
<v 2>We got to think of anything that's growing naturally is better than like,</v>

2775
02:34:59.571 --> 02:35:02.510
you know,
methamphetamine.
Even that they say the,
what's the,

2776
02:35:02.511 --> 02:35:05.770
the active drug in it,
which I guess is,
um,
amphetamine.

2777
02:35:06.200 --> 02:35:10.910
I nothing in front of me is it,
isn't it?
I mean,

2778
02:35:11.310 --> 02:35:15.150
that's what methamphetamine is,
right?
It's a methyl something math.

2779
02:35:15.260 --> 02:35:18.830
So it's like Adderall is basically math.
It's a part of it.
I mean,

2780
02:35:18.831 --> 02:35:21.620
it's a part of the family and amphetamine.
Yeah.
I mean,

2781
02:35:21.650 --> 02:35:25.040
it is most certainly related.
Right.
You know,
okay,
let's,

2782
02:35:25.041 --> 02:35:28.130
let's Google that and find out related to Adderall,

2783
02:35:28.760 --> 02:35:33.420
but I know that whatever it fucking immediate when you,
that's,
you know,

2784
02:35:33.450 --> 02:35:36.830
when you type into Google search immediately knows what you're gonna say.

2785
02:35:37.150 --> 02:35:40.750
The methamphetamine it related to add Durrell no shit.

2786
02:35:40.751 --> 02:35:44.570
It knows because apparently it is.
Yeah.
The,
um,

2787
02:35:45.830 --> 02:35:49.610
whatever,
whatever they're selling has meth now I guess is not,
uh,

2788
02:35:49.660 --> 02:35:54.340
is not so rigid.
And the same thing that ecstasy ecstasy is completely changed.

2789
02:35:54.341 --> 02:35:57.830
I remember when you used to go to a pharmacy or I guess it still is,

2790
02:35:58.280 --> 02:35:59.020
and you have to stop

2791
02:35:59.020 --> 02:36:02.200
<v 7>when you buy cough syrup,
like certain cough medicine,</v>

2792
02:36:02.201 --> 02:36:05.410
coding pills and shit.
You have to assign things,

2793
02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:08.890
give them your address and give them your name.
Like you have to like,

2794
02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:10.110
you have to register that

2795
02:36:10.450 --> 02:36:13.440
<v 2>this cough medicine so you don't make meth with it.
Oh,</v>

2796
02:36:13.441 --> 02:36:16.350
you're talking about over the counter?
Oh,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2797
02:36:16.410 --> 02:36:17.370
Bennett drill I think is yeah.

2798
02:36:17.570 --> 02:36:20.360
<v 7>Different.
Yeah.
Apparently that's how they're,
they're making meth.</v>

2799
02:36:20.600 --> 02:36:23.750
They'll like hijack a giant shipment of the shit.
Yeah.

2800
02:36:23.810 --> 02:36:27.110
You imagine if you're a person who like is a truck driver and you're just

2801
02:36:27.111 --> 02:36:30.290
driving around with Benadryl and you think,
hey man,
you know what,
I'm just,

2802
02:36:30.350 --> 02:36:33.920
you know,
no big deal.
Just driving around with some pharmaceutical company.
Yeah.

2803
02:36:33.921 --> 02:36:36.470
Might as well have tires back there.
I got Benadryl.

2804
02:36:36.560 --> 02:36:39.230
Meanwhile these people are looking at you like you're a fucking target man.

2805
02:36:39.231 --> 02:36:42.830
They start trying to figure out how to hijack you and they pull you over and put

2806
02:36:42.831 --> 02:36:45.590
a fucking gun in your mouth and force you to get out of the car and duct tape

2807
02:36:45.591 --> 02:36:46.790
you.
Cause you got cough drops.

2808
02:36:47.110 --> 02:36:50.510
<v 2>Right,
right.
And that you don't realize he got the gold wagon.</v>

2809
02:36:50.790 --> 02:36:52.590
<v 7>You have one of the key ingredients,</v>

2810
02:36:52.980 --> 02:36:55.890
one of the biggest illegal drugs in the country and one of the most addictive

2811
02:36:55.891 --> 02:36:59.670
illegal drugs.
And one of the,
if you want to have,
I mean,
I'm just guessing,

2812
02:36:59.790 --> 02:37:02.280
but sold by the biggest cons,
you know,
I mean,

2813
02:37:02.281 --> 02:37:05.190
he's not the whole thing about breaking bad.
Everybody's a fucking savage.

2814
02:37:05.191 --> 02:37:06.240
They're all animals.
Yeah.

2815
02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:10.120
<v 2>And that's also what comes out of,
um,
North Korea meth.</v>

2816
02:37:10.350 --> 02:37:14.390
It's a fucking factory.
They said country weed is legal there though.
Is it?
Yeah.

2817
02:37:14.670 --> 02:37:16.160
Good luck.
Good smell,
good shine.
It gives a shit.

2818
02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:19.740
<v 1>You're starving to death.
What would they chewing and did you see,
uh,</v>

2819
02:37:19.760 --> 02:37:21.740
the Tom Hanks movie with the pirate?
Yeah.

2820
02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:25.410
<v 7>Yeah.
It's called cat.
It's a,
it's a,
um,
uh,
it's,</v>

2821
02:37:25.850 --> 02:37:30.560
it's some sort of a stimulant.
It's um,
available in Africa.

2822
02:37:30.561 --> 02:37:34.490
They chew it a lot.
Let's,
let's,
uh,
it's calledK ,
h a t.

2823
02:37:35.030 --> 02:37:39.860
Um,
and it stands for a,
the term is edible cat.
That's the,
uh,

2824
02:37:39.861 --> 02:37:42.680
the actual,
um,
um,

2825
02:37:42.710 --> 02:37:47.170
the pronunciation among communities in these areas are not the punch of that,

2826
02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:50.420
that definition of it.
It's called Kythera,

2827
02:37:50.850 --> 02:37:55.580
like Katha Katha at Julius,
um,
or edible cat.

2828
02:37:55.610 --> 02:37:59.900
It's a flowering plant that's native to the Horn of Africa and it's an

2829
02:37:59.901 --> 02:38:03.770
amphetamine said to cause excitement,
loss of appetite and euphoria.

2830
02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:06.860
So it's just a straight,
straight up amphetamines chew it.

2831
02:38:06.861 --> 02:38:08.270
And it's an amphetamine 1980.

2832
02:38:08.300 --> 02:38:11.660
The World Health Organization classified it as a drug of choice that can produce

2833
02:38:11.661 --> 02:38:16.550
mild to moderate,
moderate psychological dependence less than tobacco or alcohol.

2834
02:38:17.030 --> 02:38:20.720
I used to take Adderall for years.
Yeah,
I know.
I remember you,
uh,
you,

2835
02:38:20.750 --> 02:38:22.670
you were one of the first guys that ever got me interested in that.

2836
02:38:23.110 --> 02:38:25.550
I know I've still yet to experiment with Adderall,

2837
02:38:25.700 --> 02:38:28.340
but I've heard amazing things about God's cleaning up.
Their office

2838
02:38:29.100 --> 02:38:33.370
<v 1>office was fucking clean.
I mean it was real like my,</v>

2839
02:38:33.420 --> 02:38:37.300
my socks.
I got crazy with that shit man.
Don't you stop.
Well,

2840
02:38:37.301 --> 02:38:41.620
I switched to a patch that has a,
a different type of Adderall.

2841
02:38:41.621 --> 02:38:46.270
Makes it spike and I,
you know,
again,
I say this by always saying,

2842
02:38:46.300 --> 02:38:49.840
if you think it might be right for you,
go to a psychopharmacologist,

2843
02:38:50.080 --> 02:38:54.070
get evaluated,
get prescribed,
don't,
don't try shit from your friends.

2844
02:38:54.340 --> 02:38:57.760
Don't self medicate.
Especially you don't know what the dosages is.
Origin,

2845
02:38:57.880 --> 02:39:01.510
you start with five milligrams,
you move up.
So I basically,

2846
02:39:01.511 --> 02:39:04.570
I was writing a book and a,
I realized my whole life,

2847
02:39:04.571 --> 02:39:07.090
I mean you go back and look at my report cards,
everything in my life.

2848
02:39:07.091 --> 02:39:11.050
I couldn't stick with one thing and I was diagnosed with ADHD and it was a

2849
02:39:11.051 --> 02:39:13.990
perfect fit.
I took this shit in my life change.

2850
02:39:13.991 --> 02:39:16.030
All of a sudden I finished the book,

2851
02:39:16.031 --> 02:39:18.220
I was writing on a TV show and I'd been struggling.

2852
02:39:18.221 --> 02:39:22.210
All of a sudden I was getting scripts done.
Um,
my personal life,
it helped.
I was,

2853
02:39:22.211 --> 02:39:25.090
I was more present and it was right for me.
I don't,

2854
02:39:25.091 --> 02:39:28.210
I don't think it's right for everybody because if you take it and you get

2855
02:39:28.211 --> 02:39:32.500
jittery and excited,
you don't have ADHD and you shouldn't take it.
But if you,

2856
02:39:32.501 --> 02:39:35.350
if you calm down then,
then it's right.

2857
02:39:35.410 --> 02:39:38.710
<v 7>I've known more than one person that has an issue with it though I'm sure a lot</v>

2858
02:39:38.711 --> 02:39:39.200
of people do.

2859
02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:43.930
And the W W I know more than one person that has had an issue with overdosing,

2860
02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:45.760
not overdosing,
like having an overdose,

2861
02:39:45.880 --> 02:39:47.590
but taking more than they're supposed to take.
Yeah,

2862
02:39:47.620 --> 02:39:50.230
I'll give you supposed to take one pill.
They took two or whatever,

2863
02:39:50.290 --> 02:39:51.430
whatever it is that they're doing.

2864
02:39:51.610 --> 02:39:54.900
But I've more than one person who I've met that has had an issue in,

2865
02:39:54.920 --> 02:39:55.810
had a hard time quitting it.

2866
02:39:56.560 --> 02:40:00.730
And I think it has a lot of the addictive same addictive properties of meth.

2867
02:40:00.850 --> 02:40:03.610
So in your experience,
what was it like getting off of it?

2868
02:40:04.530 --> 02:40:07.680
<v 1>Well,
I transitioned onto this other thing on,
so there's,
there's no,</v>

2869
02:40:07.710 --> 02:40:10.890
there was no come down now.
I mean every day I felt a crash.

2870
02:40:10.891 --> 02:40:14.220
That's the problem with Adderall.
As you go up and it's over man.

2871
02:40:14.220 --> 02:40:18.660
<v 2>It's a bad hour and that's why I sleep.
And then no,</v>

2872
02:40:18.690 --> 02:40:23.550
you just,
you just kind of crash.
You feel low blood sugar free and you know,
you,

2873
02:40:23.551 --> 02:40:26.970
you,
you lose your momentum completely.
You get it back.
And it's only an hour.

2874
02:40:27.510 --> 02:40:31.800
I used to take another one.
Yeah.
I just take a half a one in the late afternoon.

2875
02:40:31.950 --> 02:40:36.450
Oh Wow.
Yeah.
Wow.
So you had to stay dosed,

2876
02:40:36.690 --> 02:40:41.330
but yeah,
but you know what,
I never felt that way.
It didn't,
I didn't feel right.

2877
02:40:41.580 --> 02:40:45.480
He didn't feel balanced.
Focused may be balanced out.
Yeah.

2878
02:40:45.481 --> 02:40:48.720
I got the energy that you needed to do the things that you're curious about and

2879
02:40:48.721 --> 02:40:50.970
things you're ambitious about it.
And so it gave you,

2880
02:40:50.971 --> 02:40:53.580
it didn't give you ambitious as much as they'll let you pursue your inhibitions

2881
02:40:53.581 --> 02:40:54.450
cause it gives you some energy.

2882
02:40:54.510 --> 02:40:58.500
And let me follow through because I think with Adhd you hit a wall and you don't

2883
02:40:58.501 --> 02:41:02.720
have what it does.
Is it essentially people with Adhd,
their,

2884
02:41:02.721 --> 02:41:06.990
they're their um,
uh,
how do you describe distracted?
Easily?

2885
02:41:07.080 --> 02:41:09.450
They're distracted because they're,

2886
02:41:09.480 --> 02:41:12.320
they're not stimulated in the same way other people are.

2887
02:41:12.370 --> 02:41:15.120
They need to jack it up so they can get in sync.

2888
02:41:15.121 --> 02:41:17.220
Their mind can get in sync with them physically.

2889
02:41:17.280 --> 02:41:21.030
So physically you have to be brought up a little bit.
That's interesting.

2890
02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:24.690
I wonder what the fucking,
what is the origin of all that stuff?

2891
02:41:24.820 --> 02:41:29.420
Hyperactive disorder.
Is it just the fact that,
this is my question on all,

2892
02:41:29.500 --> 02:41:33.060
all these things is this is just the way we're programmed and going to school

2893
02:41:33.061 --> 02:41:34.980
and the resistance of that programming.

2894
02:41:35.190 --> 02:41:38.760
Do people get add and Adhd if they're just allowed to do whatever the fuck they

2895
02:41:38.761 --> 02:41:41.880
want to do?
Does that happen?
Like it has to do with depression.
With me,

2896
02:41:41.881 --> 02:41:45.780
we have a lot of depression in my family.
So it's a biological issue.
Yeah.

2897
02:41:45.781 --> 02:41:49.800
I think that our baseline is extremely low and this was able to bring mine up a

2898
02:41:49.801 --> 02:41:53.250
little bit.
So that I could not,
with depression,
when you fit,

2899
02:41:53.251 --> 02:41:57.630
when you face any kind of pushback or resistance you tend to give into it.

2900
02:41:57.930 --> 02:42:01.770
And this let me push right through it and over it where I barely noticed a lot

2901
02:42:01.771 --> 02:42:04.320
of the things that would have stopped me down before.
But that's interesting.

2902
02:42:04.350 --> 02:42:04.441
Well,

2903
02:42:04.441 --> 02:42:08.700
I'm glad we talked about this because I think it's good to have a nuanced point

2904
02:42:08.701 --> 02:42:12.360
of view on these things and so oftentimes when you talking about any sort of a

2905
02:42:12.361 --> 02:42:16.500
drug that anyone has had a problem with,
you associate the drug with problems,

2906
02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:20.610
right?
Like,
and not with the,
you know,
the full balanced perspective of,
look,

2907
02:42:20.611 --> 02:42:24.960
you know,
it's also good for,
I think it's like we said before,
self medication.

2908
02:42:24.990 --> 02:42:27.130
That's the problem is that people don't,

2909
02:42:27.380 --> 02:42:30.960
you got to trust your doctor and you got to go to a good doctor.
You know,

2910
02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:32.610
I knew a guy who was,

2911
02:42:32.670 --> 02:42:36.420
his family had mental illness issues and he would self medicate because of that.

2912
02:42:36.450 --> 02:42:38.100
He would always just get fucked up because of that.

2913
02:42:38.101 --> 02:42:42.000
But it was almost like he was trying to escape.
His current is his static state.

2914
02:42:42.001 --> 02:42:44.050
He was aware he didn't enjoy,
well,

2915
02:42:44.280 --> 02:42:48.960
there's a huge incidence of ADHD with creative people,
with writers and that,

2916
02:42:48.961 --> 02:42:53.460
and most of them do smoke because smoking is essentially what you're doing with

2917
02:42:53.490 --> 02:42:58.410
Adderall.
It's giving you those bolts,
those jolts of energy and focus.
Yeah.

2918
02:42:58.411 --> 02:42:59.490
That is what it is.
Right?

2919
02:42:59.491 --> 02:43:03.030
That's what Stephen King talked about when he quit smoking his book on writing.

2920
02:43:03.031 --> 02:43:06.630
So one of the most profound changes in his writing was when he stopped smoking.

2921
02:43:06.870 --> 02:43:10.860
He just wasn't getting that same neural synaptic response that he was getting

2922
02:43:10.861 --> 02:43:12.040
when was sucking on those

2923
02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:13.000
<v 7>cigarettes all the time.</v>

2924
02:43:13.280 --> 02:43:16.040
<v 1>Yeah.
I think people also,
creative people live dangerous lives.</v>

2925
02:43:16.041 --> 02:43:19.640
They're trying to shock themselves into a higher state because that's when the

2926
02:43:19.641 --> 02:43:21.080
juices start to flow.

2927
02:43:21.590 --> 02:43:25.010
<v 7>Yeah.
Sometimes when you fire up the furnace of the imagination,
you know,</v>

2928
02:43:25.011 --> 02:43:28.680
you fire it up with emotions or fear or whatever it is,
you know,
you fire it up.

2929
02:43:28.681 --> 02:43:32.870
But sometimes I'm the most creative after like I've eaten so much pot that I'm

2930
02:43:32.930 --> 02:43:34.370
just terrified that I'm going to die.

2931
02:43:34.371 --> 02:43:37.640
I break down my whole life and then when I come out of it,
I'm just,

2932
02:43:37.880 --> 02:43:39.200
I'm just running from the devil.

2933
02:43:39.201 --> 02:43:42.060
I can't believe I'm still alive and I have to like write things down,
you know?

2934
02:43:42.061 --> 02:43:45.600
Is that a good thing?
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
Because there's no health detract.

2935
02:43:45.620 --> 02:43:50.100
Did a detraction.
It's not,
nothing goes wrong with it.
So it's not like

2936
02:43:50.250 --> 02:43:53.580
<v 1>so do you consciously do that?
Yeah.
I'm going to take a lot right now.</v>

2937
02:43:53.581 --> 02:43:54.990
And you'd take a wet early in the day?

2938
02:43:55.040 --> 02:43:57.890
<v 7>No,
it depends on what I don't want to ever do it with my kids are home.</v>

2939
02:43:57.891 --> 02:44:02.060
I do it either on the road or a do it when I know that I have time or do it

2940
02:44:02.300 --> 02:44:04.520
because it's not a functional state.
I used to,

2941
02:44:04.521 --> 02:44:07.760
I like to do it when everyone's asleep,
you know?
That's a good time to do it.

2942
02:44:07.940 --> 02:44:09.260
Take cause you can,
you know,

2943
02:44:09.261 --> 02:44:12.710
it's only an hour or two and like if your adrenaline gets shocked into it,

2944
02:44:12.711 --> 02:44:15.170
like a foreign alarm goes off,
you can function if you're really high.

2945
02:44:15.171 --> 02:44:18.200
It's not like functioning on acid,
right.
DMT or something like that,

2946
02:44:18.380 --> 02:44:20.750
like while it's going on,
well actually DMTs pretty quick,

2947
02:44:21.170 --> 02:44:26.170
but you what you get out of it out of being so terrified and when you get out of

2948
02:44:26.331 --> 02:44:30.710
it about the deep psychological journey and this weird opening of all these

2949
02:44:30.711 --> 02:44:35.330
different portals of the imagination which get out of it is a direct result of

2950
02:44:35.331 --> 02:44:38.090
the fear that it puts into you while you're on it.

2951
02:44:38.420 --> 02:44:42.260
A direct result of the awareness of all the things that you're avoiding,

2952
02:44:42.261 --> 02:44:46.490
like especially your own mortality.
You're temporary time on this life.

2953
02:44:46.491 --> 02:44:47.810
You are finite existence.

2954
02:44:47.811 --> 02:44:51.680
The finite existence of the earth itself to find out an existence of the son.

2955
02:44:51.950 --> 02:44:56.270
The fact that the son didn't even get born until 10 billion years into the

2956
02:44:56.271 --> 02:44:59.740
universe and we go,
well this is all gonna end.
It doesn't matter what you,

2957
02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:01.880
you could live forever.
It's still going to end.

2958
02:45:02.050 --> 02:45:05.920
<v 1>Yeah,
that's my infinity to me is always the one word.
It's the show stopper.</v>

2959
02:45:05.921 --> 02:45:10.180
Every time I talk to like a Ari Shaffir or somebody who's a complete atheist and

2960
02:45:10.181 --> 02:45:15.181
they want to negate any sense you have in in the mysticism or any possibility.

2961
02:45:15.670 --> 02:45:17.470
I always just go,
okay,
so what's infinity?

2962
02:45:17.740 --> 02:45:20.980
They just want to talk about how scientists are eventually going to figure this

2963
02:45:20.981 --> 02:45:22.600
shit out.
It's like,
no they don't.

2964
02:45:22.601 --> 02:45:26.290
Scientists used to think the world was flat and it made perfect fucking sense

2965
02:45:26.291 --> 02:45:29.290
with the,
with the,
with the amount of information they had,

2966
02:45:29.610 --> 02:45:33.430
they had made fucking sense and right now all this stuff I started about like

2967
02:45:33.431 --> 02:45:37.630
dark matter and all that stuff is it's the best we can do with what we got.

2968
02:45:37.780 --> 02:45:40.540
The more we can perceive,
the more questions is going to be,

2969
02:45:40.660 --> 02:45:43.000
you're never going to get to infinity

2970
02:45:43.730 --> 02:45:45.710
<v 7>most likely or maybe they will.</v>

2971
02:45:45.770 --> 02:45:50.120
I mean who knows if human beings can keep going at exponential increasing pace.

2972
02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:53.870
If we keep going for a million years,
who knows what we can do,

2973
02:45:54.300 --> 02:45:56.850
<v 1>but isn't it amazing we wrap our head around when you stop,</v>

2974
02:45:56.880 --> 02:46:01.820
you could literally think about infinity for infinity.
You,
you can't,

2975
02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:03.960
you can't ever get there.
Get there.

2976
02:46:03.961 --> 02:46:07.680
You can't wrap your head around the fact that something cannot,

2977
02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:10.050
<v 7>well,
you know,
even weirder.
It's</v>

2978
02:46:10.050 --> 02:46:13.860
<v 1>not just a,
it cannot end,
but there's infinite versions of it,</v>

2979
02:46:15.970 --> 02:46:16.340
right?

2980
02:46:16.340 --> 02:46:21.130
<v 7>And somehow or another,
the universe is supposed to be a closed system.
Like not,</v>

2981
02:46:21.140 --> 02:46:23.000
not,
not,
I shouldn't say closed system,
but it's,

2982
02:46:23.001 --> 02:46:27.890
it has a shape and you,
you go,
like as you,
you know,

2983
02:46:27.891 --> 02:46:30.510
you go out there and like deep,
deep,
deep into the universe,
it,

2984
02:46:30.530 --> 02:46:34.880
it eventually turns around and you know,
you,
you,
you get to the end somewhere.

2985
02:46:34.980 --> 02:46:37.140
<v 1>Well they say the galaxy has a movement,</v>

2986
02:46:37.141 --> 02:46:40.020
it's spheric and it actually moves up and down.

2987
02:46:40.440 --> 02:46:40.591
<v 7>Well,</v>

2988
02:46:40.591 --> 02:46:43.380
what's even more bizarre is when they start talking about the black holes in the

2989
02:46:43.381 --> 02:46:45.480
center of the galaxies,
meeting other universes.

2990
02:46:45.490 --> 02:46:48.660
Meaning if you go inside of them and there's hundreds of billions of new

2991
02:46:48.661 --> 02:46:51.920
galaxies with black holes and hundreds of billions in new universes,

2992
02:46:51.930 --> 02:46:54.840
like that's the real infinity.
The real infinity isn't just that.

2993
02:46:55.050 --> 02:46:57.090
When you look at it in the space,
it goes on forever.

2994
02:46:57.180 --> 02:46:58.680
It doesn't just go on forever.

2995
02:46:58.800 --> 02:47:03.800
Each one of those lights that you see most likely is a part of another group

2996
02:47:03.930 --> 02:47:08.930
that's also a portal to another place that has a fucking untold,

2997
02:47:09.760 --> 02:47:12.570
the hundreds of billions of other portals,

2998
02:47:12.780 --> 02:47:16.470
and you go through them and there's untold hundreds of billions of other,

2999
02:47:16.560 --> 02:47:18.150
and each one of them is a universe,

3000
02:47:18.300 --> 02:47:20.490
and each one of them is almost essentially infinite.

3001
02:47:20.750 --> 02:47:24.890
<v 1>And within the realm of those things that we can perceive and those universes,</v>

3002
02:47:25.130 --> 02:47:30.130
there are wavelengths and energy levels and spectrums of light that vibrate at a

3003
02:47:30.621 --> 02:47:32.570
different level.
So that's infinity.

3004
02:47:32.750 --> 02:47:36.260
There is no lowest wavelength or highest wavelength.

3005
02:47:36.440 --> 02:47:38.960
They continue in either direction within those states,

3006
02:47:39.020 --> 02:47:43.990
<v 7>and by the way,
it also does the same thing inward.
That's what's even more fuck.</v>

3007
02:47:44.510 --> 02:47:47.200
It goes inward and an infinite direction too,

3008
02:47:47.201 --> 02:47:51.260
to our lowest measurable point where everything acts as if it's on magic.

3009
02:47:51.560 --> 02:47:54.140
The Lowest Measurable Point Being Quantum physics.

3010
02:47:54.141 --> 02:47:58.040
When they started talking about particle theory and they start observing Adams

3011
02:47:58.041 --> 02:48:01.220
in super positions,
subatomic particles and super positions,

3012
02:48:01.370 --> 02:48:05.000
which means they're moving and still at the same time and they blink in and out

3013
02:48:05.001 --> 02:48:09.080
of existence and the lowest measurable point of reality itself,

3014
02:48:09.110 --> 02:48:11.990
it's magic.
Things disappear and they appear like

3015
02:48:12.420 --> 02:48:13.740
<v 1>you bought within that,</v>

3016
02:48:13.741 --> 02:48:17.670
like what Einstein was trying to prove with unified field theory is that within

3017
02:48:17.671 --> 02:48:19.410
all of those systems,

3018
02:48:19.740 --> 02:48:24.740
there is a consistency that there are physical laws that from what we can tell,

3019
02:48:26.010 --> 02:48:28.170
and he could never really put it together,

3020
02:48:28.470 --> 02:48:31.430
but that is from a muscle,

3021
02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:34.320
we can tell the movement within your molecular,

3022
02:48:34.350 --> 02:48:39.350
the molecular level is the same as the macrocosm of the way the planets have

3023
02:48:39.871 --> 02:48:42.960
gravitational force on each other.
It's all unified.

3024
02:48:43.270 --> 02:48:45.220
<v 7>Totally makes sense.
It totally makes sense.</v>

3025
02:48:45.221 --> 02:48:48.490
That inward is outward and that as you look out into the universe,

3026
02:48:48.491 --> 02:48:51.730
essentially where you looking at is a subatomic particles have a fucking Adam

3027
02:48:51.731 --> 02:48:55.030
that exists in another human being,
you know,
and that human being,

3028
02:48:55.031 --> 02:48:56.650
and that's really what infinity is.

3029
02:48:56.710 --> 02:48:59.530
Infinity as that human being is a part of a galaxy.

3030
02:48:59.531 --> 02:49:03.610
And that galaxy is a part of more subatomic particles that are in the cell of

3031
02:49:03.611 --> 02:49:06.310
another beam.
It lives in another galaxy and it never ends.

3032
02:49:06.460 --> 02:49:09.030
And that's when you get high.
You freak out.

3033
02:49:09.170 --> 02:49:10.003
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

3034
02:49:14.010 --> 02:49:17.700
<v 7>It's so hard to take yourself seriously.
You aren't shit man.
No one's shit.</v>

3035
02:49:17.730 --> 02:49:19.710
We're all not in.
We've got to end this podcast.

3036
02:49:19.970 --> 02:49:23.360
I've got another one coming up and you had to get out of here at two 45.
Yeah,

3037
02:49:23.370 --> 02:49:27.160
I can't believe you knew another three hour one.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Rocket.

3038
02:49:27.230 --> 02:49:30.880
So you can eat lunch.
Uh,
no.
I don't need anything.
Uh,

3039
02:49:31.410 --> 02:49:35.430
we're full Greg Fitzsimmons.
You're special.

3041
02:49:38.470 --> 02:49:41.700
My one hour special that was on comedy central this year.
Check that out.

3042
02:49:41.820 --> 02:49:46.820
Glorious past this fits dog radio on iTunes and Greg Fitz show f I t z show is

his Twitter either.
Best brother.
I love you,
man.

3044
02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:54.300
Thanks for having me do this more often.
Let's play some fucking pool.

3045
02:49:54.420 --> 02:49:58.680
I'm putting in a table out here,
dude.
I'm around for like three weeks.
Let's fuck.

3046
02:49:58.710 --> 02:50:02.430
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Fuck man.
Let's do one every other week.
Let's hang out.

3047
02:50:02.460 --> 02:50:05.980
Okay.
All right.
Love you buddy.
All right.
Uh,
Greg Fitzsimmons.
I was very,
uh,

3048
02:50:05.981 --> 02:50:08.300
an enthusiastic,
lovey back,
awkward.

3049
02:50:08.310 --> 02:50:10.680
Both friend does that to you and says they love you.
I love you man.

3050
02:50:11.070 --> 02:50:13.710
That's even weirder.
He looked at me.
Look at me.
Look at me.
Any,
