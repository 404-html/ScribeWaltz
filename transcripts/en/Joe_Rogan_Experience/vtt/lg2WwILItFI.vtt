<v Speaker 1>Because like I can't,</v>

41
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.210
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

42
00:01:55.211 --> 00:01:56.044
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy who was writing for the Newton </v>

43
00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>south high school paper who wrote this </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool thing about the boy scouts.</v>

44
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>And I remember reading this because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was in the boy scouts briefly as a young</v>

45
00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:09.090
<v Speaker 1>teenager and they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the tenants like trustworthy,</v>

46
00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>loyal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrifty,</v>

47
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:11.694
<v Speaker 1>clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reverent and like one of the things </v>

48
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.480
<v Speaker 1>about what the voice boy scouts were </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do is keep your mind pure,</v>

49
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep your thoughts pure.</v>

50
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.070
<v Speaker 1>And this guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wrote this article?</v>

51
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:23.904
<v Speaker 1>And obviously this is in high school in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 1980s guy was pretty brilliant and </v>

52
00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:28.554
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the idea of anyone telling </v>

53
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:31.914
<v Speaker 1>me what I can and can't do with my </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts because sometimes my thoughts </v>

54
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:34.854
<v Speaker 1>are fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

55
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.950
<v Speaker 1>I like to explore the idea of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about and his argument in this newspaper</v>

56
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:41.454
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like grossly paraphrasing him </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause again this is like from 1982 or </v>

57
00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:45.774
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like you like you don't need to </v>

58
00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>know what's going on in my thoughts.</v>

59
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>You just needed to know how I act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how I act is important,</v>

60
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:55.990
<v Speaker 1>not what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tell me to keep my thoughts pure.</v>

61
00:02:55.991 --> 00:02:58.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like my thoughts are mine right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
