00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:02.960
<v Speaker 1>I love dogs too.</v>

3
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I love animals and this,</v>

4
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.870
<v Speaker 1>that's something that people have a weird problem with,</v>

5
00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:09.600
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have a weird problem with loving animals and then feeding their</v>

6
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:09.961
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

7
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:10.381
<v Speaker 1>Animals.</v>

8
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Like I have friends who fucking are vegans and they have cats and I'm like,</v>

9
00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:19.581
<v Speaker 1>do you under fucking stand that cats only eat meat like a dog?</v>

10
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 1>A dog can eat carrots,</v>

11
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:22.470
<v Speaker 1>a dog can eat grains.</v>

12
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Got dogs eat rice.</v>

13
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Like I have a friend who cooks for his dog and he gets his dog ground beef and</v>

14
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>mixes it with potatoes and rice and it's delicious.</v>

15
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.290
<v Speaker 1>You do that for your dog.</v>

16
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh cool.</v>

17
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>It's doesn't eight probably herself,</v>

18
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

19
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.270
<v Speaker 1>but you can't do that with a cat if you can do with the cat.</v>

20
00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:41.550
<v Speaker 1>It has to be just animal protein.</v>

21
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.031
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

22
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 1>That's really the only thing that cat is allowed to eat.</v>

23
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:46.380
<v Speaker 1>You can't feed cats grains.</v>

25
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Cats are not supposed to eat the rice that's supposed to eat carrots.</v>

26
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Catsi fish and they eat chicken and the beef and the liver and they eat.</v>

27
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>They eat animal protein,</v>

28
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.430
<v Speaker 1>they're carnivores.</v>

29
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 1>They're straight carnivores.</v>

30
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.910
<v Speaker 1>So for you to be a Vegan and have a fucking cat living in your house,</v>

31
00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:05.610
<v Speaker 1>like you're involved in the killing of animals,</v>

32
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 1>whether you like it or not.</v>

33
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.201
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

34
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>I guess there's probably some Vegan cat food,</v>

35
00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>but I can't imagine it.</v>

36
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Let's go kill it right now.</v>

37
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Probably kill the cat.</v>

38
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not good.</v>

39
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Vegan cat food bad.</v>

40
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

41
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.560
<v Speaker 1>let's look up that cash.</v>

42
00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:19.394
<v Speaker 1>Where the Dylan?</v>

43
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

44
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.700
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>

45
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>That's one of my two five days cats.</v>

46
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

47
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Vegan cat food.</v>

48
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:25.803
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

49
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.501
<v Speaker 1>I just went up.</v>

50
00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that shit is not good.</v>

51
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 1>That basically mini lines.</v>

52
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh look it.</v>

53
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.083
<v Speaker 1>He says actually,</v>

54
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>and the Vegan cat foods contained adequate amounts.</v>

55
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Is it okay to raise a cat vegan?</v>

56
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.720
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hilarious.</v>

57
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:40.554
<v Speaker 1>Fellow.</v>

58
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Other thing that is bugging Alaris now artists into activists with more than one</v>

59
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 1>field on the family in Ithaca,</v>

00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:46.380
<v Speaker 1>New York.</v>

61
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.520
<v Speaker 1>More in her partner.</v>

62
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Shariah Golding.</v>

63
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:49.561
<v Speaker 1>That means our lives.</v>

64
00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 1>Friends.</v>

65
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.030
<v Speaker 1>What a surprise.</v>

66
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Lesbian vegans with cats,</v>

67
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

68
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 1>You never hear about that.</v>

69
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Relatively small,</v>

70
00:01:56.641 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>but deeply dedicated group of Vegan pet owners who believe their cats and dogs</v>

71
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:01.040
<v Speaker 1>dies.</v>

72
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.150
<v Speaker 1>She reflect their own beliefs.</v>

73
00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>About the treatment of animals and the environmentally sustainable,</v>

74
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 1>sustainable lifestyles.</v>

75
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Is it okay to give your diet of spare me all the Foa,</v>

76
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:13.284
<v Speaker 1>outrage,</v>

77
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.390
<v Speaker 1>outrage of the billions of land,</v>

78
00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>animals and trillions of sea animals tortured and killed each year in the u s</v>

79
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.930
<v Speaker 1>alone for food to feed people and pets?</v>

80
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

81
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

82
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.580
<v Speaker 1>you leave a cat outside that cat's gonna kill a bird.</v>

83
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.151
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

84
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:29.310
<v Speaker 1>that's sweet kitty cat that you have as a murderer.</v>

85
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

86
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>my cat makes these crazy noises.</v>

87
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:33.030
<v Speaker 1>When he looks outside,</v>

88
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>he sees like something like a squirrel.</v>

89
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.140
<v Speaker 1>His whole jaw starts.</v>

90
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.920
<v Speaker 1>He starts,</v>

91
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.930
<v Speaker 1>their jaws start moving up and down.</v>

92
00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Like they can't help it if they're just thinking about biting.</v>

93
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.220
<v Speaker 1>I it.</v>

94
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.840
<v Speaker 1>If you've had fight dreams,</v>

95
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.370
<v Speaker 1>like what you wake up kicking,</v>

96
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.893
<v Speaker 1>you know those dreams.</v>

98
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

99
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>cats have those when they see a fucking animal that they want to kill because</v>

100
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.403
<v Speaker 1>it's like that.</v>

101
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>They have reflex.</v>

102
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>I had cats,</v>

103
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.773
<v Speaker 1>they make noises</v>

104
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 1>so it looks out the window.</v>

105
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever watched them like stalk the stalk?</v>

106
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 1>You stuck your leg and then watch a lion?</v>

107
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>There is very little difference.</v>

108
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 1>You're like a lion crawling through the grass or a cat roll in three a carpet.</v>

109
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

110
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Like they look identical.</v>

111
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

112
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely identical.</v>

113
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:18.371
<v Speaker 1>They're murderers,</v>

114
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:19.140
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

115
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.390
<v Speaker 1>They have fucking murderers apparently.</v>

116
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

117
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 1>what they're saying is for a lot of these,</v>

118
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.550
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these people that are there making these,</v>

119
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:27.791
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

120
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 1>these diets for these dogs,</v>

121
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 1>there's like a big debate whether or not it's healthy for the dogs.</v>

122
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.190
<v Speaker 1>It's about the Vegas.</v>

123
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

124
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.151
<v Speaker 1>You can die.</v>

125
00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:36.571
<v Speaker 1>It's for,</v>

126
00:03:36.571 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 1>for dogs and cats,</v>

127
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it's a matter of,</v>

128
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

129
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>the animal getting all the proper nutrients or just being able to stay alive.</v>

130
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.190
<v Speaker 1>So I don't really understand people's relationships with dogs in that sense.</v>

131
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Like I get the whole,</v>

132
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 1>like men having a dog,</v>

133
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 1>but as people get weird,</v>

134
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.331
<v Speaker 1>like we have,</v>

135
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:53.164
<v Speaker 1>we know a,</v>

136
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.591
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

137
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>a friend of a friend who told us to have a patient who's got munch houses,</v>

138
00:03:58.571 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 1>you know which houses?</v>

139
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

140
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>

141
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Speaker 1>So they basically make up things so that you can get their dog operated on.</v>

142
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just like as an problem so that they have an excuse to get an</v>

143
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 1>operation on the door,</v>

144
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:13.414
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

145
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.500
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like the kid</v>

146
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 1>get away.</v>

147
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Apparently what they're saying is that dogs and cats have a much different</v>

148
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 1>nutritional requirement and human beings and that the,</v>

149
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:24.971
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

150
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 1>they need much higher protein intake than a human does.</v>

151
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 1>So especially dogs can eat a bunch of other shit like yams and potatoes and all</v>

152
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 1>these different things and it's okay as long as they get sufficient amount of</v>

153
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:36.791
<v Speaker 1>protein,</v>

154
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost impossible to get the amount of protein that a dog needs with</v>

155
00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:44.530
<v Speaker 1>just plants and cats to fucking joke.</v>

156
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:45.460

<v Speaker 1>Keep it from being a murderer.</v>

177
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:12.971
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

178
00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:13.810
<v Speaker 1>it's nature.</v>

179

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what the cat does.</v>

183
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.761
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of comedy,</v>

187
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.203
