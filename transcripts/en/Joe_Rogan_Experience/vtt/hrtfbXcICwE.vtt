1
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.230
Ladies and gentlemen,
this,
this is unsuspecting.

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.370
This unsuspecting,
unexpected is the word I was looking for was searching.

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.640
I'm not good when I get up before noon.
Dude.
I know it doesn't work for me.

4
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.210
I made too.
Did you see Emma?
Yes.
It helps you sleep,
right?
Yeah,

5
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:21.180
but it makes it kind of groggy for the first hour or so was pretty groggy.

6
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.130
Gives me hard morning.
Boners yeah,

7
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.590
I find that it really increases my morning wood.
Yeah.

8
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.220
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is sneaking up on bitches.

9
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.960
See,
I'm looking right now.
There's hundreds of people that are alive.

10
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.570
How the fuck did they know this content?
I'm not calling you cuts.
I love it.

11
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.170
They're Ninjas.
I love Ya.
But you ninjas,
you fucking snuck in all 277 of you.

12
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.580
We didn't tell anybody what time we're doing this.

13
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.480
Maybe I told maybe I said like 1230.
And so people just kept their browsers open.

14
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.630
Did you?
I don't know.
I'm sneaky like that.

15
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.950
Yesterday was a big blur.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yesterday,

16
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.250
Brian put together the,
uh,
all the equipment we had all,
well,

17
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.050
let's just fucking do the commercial real quick.

18
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.460
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is sponsored by this episode,
at least,

19
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:10.461
is sponsored by audible.com and a audible has a really fucking bad ass new

20
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:15.360
application called audible,
I believe it's called audible whisper sync.
Yeah.

21
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.980
Yeah.
Whisper.
I don't get it.
Well,
tell me,
explain that isn't beautiful.

22
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:24.150
The idea is with a,
and they sent me one of those kindle fires,

23
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:27.360
which I've yet to a fire up.
I have the regular kindle,

24
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:30.720
the one that looks like paper.
It's really pretty cool.
I got a new one.

25
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:33.960
I actually have two.
I have three of them now because I have the paper one,

26
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.280
but they sent me the fire HD,
which works on Amazon.

27
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.330
It allows you to get movies and,
and what,
what this,
this,

28
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.950
the application that audible has that's native to it or it's built in rather

29
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:51.840
comes with the,
uh,
the kit,
the kindle fire.
It's really amazing.
What it is,

30
00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:52.890
is you read the book,

31
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:55.500
like say if you're at home when you're reading the book and you're like,
oh,

32
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:57.810
I got to get to sleep.
And when you get up in the morning,

33
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.640
you sink the page to your smart phone.
So when you get up in the morning,

34
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:07.641
you plug your smart phone in your car and a companion audible book picks up

35
00:02:08.281 --> 00:02:09.840
where you left off.

36
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.160
So it's a professional audio book with like a real actor reading it.

37
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.010
Don't ever get the ones with Stephen King reading his own shit.

38
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.560
Really see if in case one of my favorite authors,
don't get me wrong,

39
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.220
but it's way better when you have like an actor reading yet he's like sort of

40
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:27.600
flat with his,
his delivery,
but it's writing him up the stairs and we got shy.

41
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.380
He tries,
it's just awkward.
It's awkward,
but he's a fucking brilliant writer.

42
00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:34.920
But it's the audible books with him Kinda of socket.
But um,

43
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.950
I just love that this,
I think this is the future and it,

44
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.840
it makes to me it makes commutes so much better.
I drove over here.

45
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:47.520
I was listening to an audible book.
Uh,
um,
I,
I think that it,
it's,
uh,

46
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.240
it's a great way to make time if you live in any sort of situation,

47
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.410
we have to travel.
You have commuting air,
whether it's airplanes or whether it's,

48
00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.780
uh,
being stuck in traffic every day.
Uh,

49
00:02:57.781 --> 00:03:02.410
an audible book really makes the difference between fucking hating it and

50
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:06.370
actually enjoying your time.
Um,
and,
uh,
the way,
uh,

51
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.120
audible has set up.
They have,
I mean,

52
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.210
I don't know how many fucking thousands of different audio books available,

53
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:20.050
including Steve Martin's,
which is a really cool cause.

54
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.830
Born standing up is actually read by Steve Martin,

55
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:28.570
which is awesome to hear him tell his story of his own life.
It's,
it's really,

56
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.290
and as a comedian,
that one really is,
I'm very motivational to like,

57
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:35.800
you listen to Steve Martin talk about like the glory days and starting out in

58
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:39.070
common.
It makes you want to go on stage.
Starting up here at the ice house,

59
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:40.930
he talks about the ice house alive.
Yeah.

60
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.680
Well this place is fucking super duper historic.
Um,

61
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.940
if you go to audible.com Joe,
um,
audible,

62
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:53.941
we'll give you 30 days free service and they will also give you a,

63

65
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:05.490
They're really cool company.
They've been around a long time and uh,

66
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.930
they've supported a lot of comedians to like a,

67
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.310
I was talking about with proofs the other day.

68
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.030
I know he did some stuff for them and Marmel did some stuff for them.
And it's,

69
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:14.560
um,
just a,

70
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.300
a really a cool and useful product that I think that if you haven't been into

71
00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:22.180
audio books before,
it will really enhance your life,

72
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.840
especially if you're any sort of commuting city in Eddie sort of commuting

73
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:29.130
situation.
So go check it out.
You dirty bitches.
And um,

74
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.410
we were also sponsored by [inaudible] Dot Com uh,
on,

75
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:35.080
it has expanded if you haven't been there in a long time.

76
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:38.920
We started out as essentially just a supplement company and we've worked our way

77
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:43.360
into fitness equipment.
We now sell a Blendtec blenders,
which,
you know,

78
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.460
I'm always talking about a drinking Kale smoothies and Kale shakes make you,

79
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.780
you know,

80
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.390
it's just a massive amount of nutrients that are really makes your body feel

81
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:56.260
fantastic.
Um,
so we started selling the blenders to make those things.

82
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.750
So we started selling Blendtec blenders.
Uh,
um,

83
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.320
I'm a big fan of kettle bells and battle ropes and,

84
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.670
and doing things and exercises which enhance what's called functional strength,

85
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.780
meaning strength that you can use,
uh,
you know,
in an athletic endeavor,

86
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.530
picking things up,
strength that really comes into play instead of like,

87
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.190
there's a lot of like bodybuilding type exercises that just really make you look

88
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:21.100
sexy as fuck,
but they don't do anything.
Um,

89
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.860
they don't really enhance your athleticism.
They,
they,

90
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.490
they enhance your ability to move things in an isolated manner,

91
00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:28.630
which is kind of unnatural.

92
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.440
The way you pick up things really is you use your entire body when you're,

93
00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:34.420
you know,
you're moving things around and carrying things.

94
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:37.630
You're using all your muscles together and coordination as one.

95
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.710
That's what kettle bells are all about.
Uh,

96
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.190
it's my favorite form of exercise as far as weight training.

97
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.540
I think you can get everything in there.

98
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.920
You need your strength training in there.

99
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.580
He can get conditioning and cardio with weights,
uh,
with kettle bells.

100
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.280
And we even sell a,
one of my all time favorite videos for watching,

101
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.670
uh,
for,
uh,
for training with kettlebells.
Um,

102
00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.860
it's the Kettlebell cardio workout by,
uh,
Keith Webber,

103
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.510
extreme kettlebell cardio workout and uh,
it's a fucking,
it's out of stock.

104
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.170
We sold them out already.
They're that good man.
They're fucking tremendous.

105
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.230
They're there.
It's,
it's,
it's one of my favorite all time videos.

106
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.790
He just puts you through the fucking meat grinder and I do it with a 35 pound

107
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:19.490
cattle bouts,
not much weight.
You'd think you could do that all day long.

108
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.360
You can't,
it's fucking brutal.
And it's an amazing cardio workout like that.

109
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.550
It's one of the best as far as I'm doing something for me that translates to

110
00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:32.330
Jujitsu.
This,
uh,
this workout is one of the best.
And so all that shit,

111
00:06:32.331 --> 00:06:34.220
we have it on it,
the supplements,

112
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:38.810
all of them come with a first order of 30 pills,
100% money back guarantee.

113
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.640
You don't have to return the product.
Just no one's trying to sell you anything.

114
00:06:41.641 --> 00:06:44.270
This sucks.
It's all good stuff.
It's not going to fix you,

115
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.240
but if you want to make your life better,

116
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.180
one of the best ways to make your life better is to have a body that works

117
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:54.620
better,
whether it's through exercise and most certainly through nutrition.

118
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.400
Um,
I'm a huge proponent of eating healthy,

119
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.900
of taking a lot of green leafy vegetables,
eating vitamin supplements.

120
00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:07.140
I took a lot of vitamin supplements every day.
I take these a athlete,
pure pack,

121
00:07:07.141 --> 00:07:09.820
so everything's all packed up for me.
Um,

122
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.940
and I take an extra fish oil and I took a lot of different,
um,
uh,

123
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.810
honored supplements like Alpha brain before shows and shroom tech sport before

124
00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:22.430
workouts.
Just too much dimension.
So go,
I'll check it all out on a.com.

125
00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:26.240
And if you use the code name Rogan,

126
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.560

You dirty freaks.
Cue The music,
Brian.
Let's make an official

127
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.260
the Joe Rogan experience.

128
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.130
<v 2>Try my day.
Joe Rogan podcast my night.</v>

129
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.930
<v 1>So Ladies and gentlemen,
as of right now,
as of this moment,</v>

130
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.460
it's just me and my little buddy Brian.
What's up?
Fell.

131
00:07:46.461 --> 00:07:47.650
We don't do enough of these anymore.

132
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.570
<v 3>I know.
I uh,
had a really rough night last night.
What happened?</v>

133
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:53.613
I,
uh,

134
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:59.200
took the Zma and then I went out to eat and I started falling asleep while I was

135
00:07:59.201 --> 00:08:02.770
on the beginning stages of Zma and that stuff hits you hard.

136
00:08:02.771 --> 00:08:04.630
Like I couldn't really drive on the way home.

137
00:08:04.631 --> 00:08:06.970
It was like being drunk driving lesson.
Yeah.

138
00:08:06.971 --> 00:08:11.290
So don't drink or don't Zma before you drive and then go to Denny's.

139
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:17.260
Denny's.
I can't wait a minute.
But zinc is just,
it means Zma rather is just zinc.

140
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.260
Magnesium.
And what else?
Is there anything else in there?

141
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.040
A couple of sleeping pills.
So it's a matter that to me,

142
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.160
it doesn't do that to me at all.
It was,
it was,
I was seeing double.

143
00:08:27.161 --> 00:08:30.330
I did the pirate drive where you had to hold,
have to hold when I,

144
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.470
while you drive,
you know this.

145
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.540
It's weird how weird people's bodies react to different things.

146
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.180
Like people that are allergic to peanuts.
I know it's true,

147
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.970
but I don't believe it.
Like I know it's true,

148
00:08:39.971 --> 00:08:41.500
but I want to like eat that peanut bitch.

149
00:08:41.501 --> 00:08:43.270
You know you can eat that peanut Kimmy though,
so I'll eat them.

150
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.060
This is nothing wrong with peanuts,
woody.
I could that be possible.

151
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.700
We did at a restaurant where a lady eight something,

152
00:08:48.701 --> 00:08:51.460
I don't know if it was peanuts or some kind of fish or were her throat started

153
00:08:51.461 --> 00:08:53.470
getting closed up in the ambulance.
Had to take her away.

154
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.250
Will that happen to a guy on fear?
We didn't know

155
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.770
<v 4>that he was allergic to eating roaches.
Right.
By the way,</v>

156
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:02.190
there was a roach eating contest and Florida and the guy fucking choke to death

157
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:04.720
and died.
Same reason.
Was it the same reason?
Yeah,

158
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.670
<v 5>I think isn't it?
Because if you're allergic to a shelter,</v>

159
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:10.130
<v 4>well that's what it was on fear factor.</v>

160
00:09:10.131 --> 00:09:14.450
But I don't know about this row cheating guy who died eating guy dies.

161
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.680
Roaches.
Have you ever lived in a house that had roaches?
Oh yeah,
definitely.

162
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.420
And the east coast.
It's real problem.

163
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.350
Sometime much of a problem in the in La and not as much of a problem they have

164
00:09:24.351 --> 00:09:24.801
from out here.

165
00:09:24.801 --> 00:09:29.210
Like I saw a big one out here in Pasadena at the icehouse fucking giant one

166
00:09:29.211 --> 00:09:32.150
who's probably alive back when Dean Martin was still with Jerry Lewis

167
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:36.750
<v 5>fucking roach was you like Disney writes is they don't even,
they seem drawn the,</v>

168
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:40.380
the,
the w we have a rat problem at my house,
like just tons of mice and rats.

169
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.830
They don't go in the house,
but they just all live in trees.
Like my tree is,

170
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.700
has like two rats.

171
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:47.580
They're just living up there like fucking kids in a tree house.

172
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.110
<v 4>This guy choked to death on his own vomit.
Oh,
whoops.</v>

173
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.390
Says Edward Archibald choke to death on his own vomit after downing piles of

174
00:09:56.391 --> 00:09:59.060
bugs at a pet store.

175
00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.010
Contest it Pat's store,
how to fucking row cheating contest.

176
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.270
And this guy has a giant mouth full of roaches and he choked to death on his own

177
00:10:08.271 --> 00:10:12.260
vomit.
Wow.
That's weird way to die man.

178
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.800
<v 5>Cause he Roche Pharma,
Ilo has legs and it's half of it's moving.</v>

179
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.010
<v 4>I can't help but feel a little bit responsible for this I think.</v>

180
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.240
<v 5>Oh yeah.
You're somewhat involved.</v>

181
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:27.100
<v 4>Yeah.
I think I contributed to this part of the retarded culture.
No,</v>

182
00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.680
by through fear factor.
I think I definitely contributed to this,

183
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.660
at least part of this.
It's craziness.
Jesus Christ.

184
00:10:35.661 --> 00:10:37.850
That's is just serving thing to read man.

185
00:10:37.851 --> 00:10:42.851
Choke to death on his own vomit during a cockroach eating contest at a pet

186
00:10:44.781 --> 00:10:48.980
store.
Fuck man.
It really is like running man.

187
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.240
Like when you watched the movie running man,

188
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.950
they show you like people going for money and dogs chased him and biting them

189
00:10:54.951 --> 00:10:57.980
and be like,
well that would never happen.
This is just an exaggeration,

190
00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.150
but the more you see shit like that,
he was not really an exaggeration anymore.

191
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:03.320
In fact,

192
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:08.000
it's just as fucked up or more fucked up than fiction than fiction.

193
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:13.690
Like the come drinking part in fear factor when we had people drink com that's

194
00:11:14.061 --> 00:11:17.810
more fucked up than anything you've ever seen in a movie about life being fucked

195
00:11:17.811 --> 00:11:20.720
up.
And it was real.
You know when you have like a movie,

196
00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:23.960
when they have those scenes of like crazy crazy shows all yeah,

197
00:11:23.961 --> 00:11:28.640
like parody things.
Yeah,
it's fucking disgusting.

198
00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.910
Um,
your,
uh,
your Roden problem,

199
00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:36.560
they have a unique way of trying to solve that.
In Chicago.
In Chicago,

200
00:11:36.561 --> 00:11:39.710
they have coyotes that they know where the coyotes are,

201
00:11:39.711 --> 00:11:44.120
they know their nests there in Chicago there's 60 of them and these coyotes are

202
00:11:44.121 --> 00:11:44.930
tracked.

203
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.530
They have collars on them with like RFID devices or whatever the fuck it is.

204
00:11:48.531 --> 00:11:52.640
They use to track them and they follow them around to make sure that,
you know,

205
00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.130
these coyotes are like

206
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.900
<v 5>killing all the rats.
Why don't they just,</v>

207
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.630
that seems dangerous that Lou just released coyotes.
I mean,

208
00:11:58.631 --> 00:12:01.930
they're not dangerous animals really,
but yet they kill animals.

209
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.930
Why don't they just released tons of cats?
All the cats that are in the,
in the,

210
00:12:04.931 --> 00:12:08.780
like the pins or whatever.
I think it's shelters,
first of all,

211
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:13.570
<v 4>cause I think people associate cats with pets.
You know the associated with Aw,</v>

212
00:12:13.571 --> 00:12:14.161
poor little kid.

213
00:12:14.161 --> 00:12:17.260
He'd come to my house and you keep them in your house and then the fucking cat

214
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:18.280
doesn't get to eat the rats.

215
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:24.030
And the other thing is that they spread diseases like that toxoplasma thing,

216
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.960
the one that they know about with rats,

217
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:30.130
there'll be really irresponsible if you want it to have a bunch of cats and a

218
00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:32.290
bunch of rats interacting with people.

219
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.740
<v 5>What if they put give him little outfits.
It shows that they work for the city,</v>

220
00:12:35.741 --> 00:12:38.110
like go orange like outfits and stuff and you're like,

221
00:12:38.111 --> 00:12:41.420
it's illegal if you take them into your house,
people would take them in any way.

222
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.880
Joey d is this cock saga.

223
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.590
He didn't sign up to be working for a fucking DEA over here.
This little guy,

224
00:12:47.591 --> 00:12:51.430
this little buddy,
he's mellow pal.
He ran a fucking chicken littles.

225
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.600
So he gives a tender vittles put trackers just like the coyote pit,

226
00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.010
Lowell fitbit's and the cat's acids.
I don't know

227
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.720
<v 4>that works like that.
I don't think if you do that to cats,</v>

228
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:02.710
people will get mad at you.

229
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.610
If you had a bunch of cats run around with RFID collars on and you were leaving

230
00:13:06.611 --> 00:13:09.610
them in the wild and forcing them to fend for themselves,
but you tell them like,

231
00:13:09.611 --> 00:13:12.370
hey,
or they're going to get euthanized tonight.
Yeah.

232
00:13:12.371 --> 00:13:15.640
But people would want to feed them.
They would want to be interacting with them.

233
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.910
And when people interact with cats,
if it's a feral cat,

234
00:13:18.911 --> 00:13:22.090
that's when you have the risk of that toxoplasma infection.

235
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:23.980
So I think it would be,

236
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.960
<v 5>yeah,
but that's why you just have to make it,</v>

237
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.540
I have a little costume and make it illegal.
Like,
look,

238
00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:31.810
you get three years of jail.
We have trackers and he,
these are working cats.

239
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:34.690
Maybe put a little nights in their hands or something like that.

240
00:13:34.691 --> 00:13:36.230
So you can't touch him.
I don't think.

241
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.230
I don't think that,
um,

242
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:44.280
<v 4>I think Kylie's are better at killing anyway.
Yeah,
I think they're better at it.</v>

243
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.110
You know,
coyotes are creepy fucks.

244
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.740
Just seems like we have would have more cats to get rid of or they're going to

245
00:13:49.741 --> 00:13:53.300
eat the cat.
Cody's going to eat the cat stuff.
They're going to Andrew's,

246
00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:57.090
well the definitely dangerous,
but if they only have 60 of them and they uh,

247
00:13:57.091 --> 00:13:58.950
they keep an eye on,
it's a novel idea.

248
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.680
They know where their dens are and everything.
That's crazy.

249
00:14:01.681 --> 00:14:04.370
It's fucking beyond crazy.
I mean,
they have a,

250
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:08.670
essentially of these wild predators,
just small enough to be manageable.

251
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.610
It's not like a team of polar bears.
It lives in your town.

252
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.570
They're just small enough and they're just hungry enough to keep the rat problem

253
00:14:15.571 --> 00:14:19.230
in check.
Fucking my work dude.
They're testing out drones.

254
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.260
That's drone training.
Yeah.
It's like a drone.
You're right.

255
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:25.270
Coyotes second animal drone.
Yeah.
We,
yeah.
And how do we know that?

256
00:14:25.271 --> 00:14:27.510
Did Not fucking putting chips in those coyotes brains.
Yeah.

257
00:14:27.511 --> 00:14:30.630
Those are Google coyotes.
Remote controlling.
I'm from Florida.

258
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.090
Could be coyote.
Got Mail.
Yeah.
Coyotes are a,

259
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.040
that's a creepy thing to have around children too,
because they will kill a kid.

260
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:38.830
Yeah.

261
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:42.640
<v 5>Well I think cats won't kill,
kill,
kill a kid.
And you just like the whole,</v>

262
00:14:42.641 --> 00:14:46.030
the whole city has tons of cats everywhere.
There's not going to be any mice.

263
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.050
And then yeah,
that's what they do.
If the,
if the,

264
00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.010
the coyotes do keep the

265
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.860
<v 4>rat population in check to the point where there's no more rats.</v>

266
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.290
And how do they get access to the rats?

267
00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.470
How do you ensure that the coyote is get access to the rats?

268
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:04.480
It's almost like you have to bait the rats.
Like how do you get them into like a,

269
00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.150
a spot where the car,
he just like let the coyotes figured it out.
Figured out.

270
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.270
The problem is the county is going to be shy of going near people.

271
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.960
So you're going to be crass,

272
00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.560
but the rats are going to be near people cause that's what the garbages so if

273
00:15:15.561 --> 00:15:18.470
the coyotes go near the rats,
they're going here,
the people.

274
00:15:18.471 --> 00:15:20.990
So the coyote is going to be around people.
That's creepy.

275
00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.870
And it only takes a couple months till we start fucking those coyotes.

276
00:15:23.871 --> 00:15:28.560
And can't you?
No,
not,
not.
Well,
if it was held down,
tied to,

277
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:33.370
tried to kill you,
would you fuck it?
Uh,
if I had to like poodle,

278
00:15:33.371 --> 00:15:37.010
you mother fucker just took your deck in the coyote.
I'm not for dominate them.

279
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.070
Yeah.
Animal Sex.

280
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.200
It doesn't seem as good as like fish stacks and dolphin fish and dolphins fish.

281
00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.240
Well,
fish sex just don't have sex.
It seems cleaner and slang.

282
00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:48.440
They don't even have vaginas.
Do you know that fish?
They don't sex.
Yeah,

283
00:15:48.441 --> 00:15:52.940
but they have very big bow.
The mail.
They're big mouths.
Yeah.

284
00:15:52.941 --> 00:15:55.190
With teeth in them.
Do they have teeth on their tongue?
Yeah.

285
00:15:55.191 --> 00:15:56.600
You just pull out the teeth and fuck it.

286
00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.090
I don't think you can pull out tongue teeth.
Oh,

287
00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.030
have you ever that I've ever seen that fish where um,

288
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.300
there's a parasite that lives inside of its mouth and eats its tongue and

289
00:16:05.301 --> 00:16:10.090
actually replaces its time and it becomes the tongue.
Yeah,
it is the tongue.

290
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:12.400
Like cautious mouth.
I Dunno,

291
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:16.160
it just Google fish with a parasite for tongue,

292
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.590
but it literally doesn't have a tongue anymore.

293
00:16:18.591 --> 00:16:21.350
It has this fucking bug living in its mouth.

294
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:26.360
Nature you scary need to use.
So scary.

295
00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.730
One of the newest things that someone tweeted me is this a combination polar

296
00:16:31.731 --> 00:16:32.390
bear,

297
00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:37.390
grizzly bear hybrid that has been seen a lot in Alaska lately.

298
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:42.590
The tongue,
the tongue is nuts.
Hey guys,

299
00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.820
how are you doing this with the picture we're looking at is a dead fish that has

300
00:16:46.821 --> 00:16:50.480
this larva.
Whatever the fuck it is.
Beetle bug looking thing.

301
00:16:50.481 --> 00:16:55.310
Look living in its mouth that literally replaces the fishes tongue,
takes a spot.

302
00:16:55.311 --> 00:16:56.270
The fish can't get rid of it,

303
00:16:56.271 --> 00:16:59.660
so it just accepts the fact this thing lives in its mouth and the fish keeps

304
00:16:59.661 --> 00:17:02.300
eating and as the fish is eating this,
uh,

305
00:17:02.301 --> 00:17:05.600
this thing living as its tongue gets to feast.

306
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:10.490
This works the Dick and this works the balls.
It takes the same place.

307
00:17:10.491 --> 00:17:12.890
Like it helps get the food down into the hole,

308
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.980
but it also steals a bunch for itself.
I guess.
That's crazy.

309
00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:21.670
The parasite relationship with parasites and organisms is so creepy.

310
00:17:22.011 --> 00:17:26.780
There's so many different weird examples of parasitic relationships.

311
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.900
I been calling your phone,
Bro.
Oh,
they really look at this picture.

312
00:17:29.901 --> 00:17:34.130
This is like a skeleton version of that parent's site animal thing.
Oh,
that was,

313
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:38.270
that was that dude.
Ooh.
See,
fuck.

314
00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.200
Oh,
hey.
How's it going?
Big Guy.

315
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.220
I don't know if I call them back.
Let me see if I can,
I'm going to kiss it.

316
00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.900
You want me to kiss it right now?
Um,

317
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:55.350
<v 6>yeah.
The parasitic relationship.
It's a very strange man.
Parasites.</v>

318
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:59.280
That's a good question.
I have what's inside there?
Hey John,
it's Joe.

319
00:17:59.281 --> 00:18:00.450
Did you get the other number?

320
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:03.953
<v 7>Okay.</v>

321
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.130
<v 6>It's been busy.
That number's busy.</v>

322
00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:07.383
<v 7>Okay.</v>

323
00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:11.370
<v 6>It's still busy.
He's saying.
All right.
Hold on one.
We're,
we're,
we're uh,</v>

324
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.560
we're gonna make sure it's cleared off right now.
Otherwise,

325
00:18:13.561 --> 00:18:18.210
I'll just put you on speaker phone.
Yeah,
let me,

326
00:18:18.211 --> 00:18:21.210
let me hold onto you for a second.
Right here.
We'll figure this out with Ryan.

327
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.350
Try now.
Can you try it now or should I hang up?

328
00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.210
Hang up and try it now and if it doesn't work,
call me back.

329
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:29.463
<v 7>Alright,
he's trying.</v>

330
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:36.080
<v 6>Um,
yeah,
the,
uh,
the aquatic worm,
it's the weirdest one.</v>

331
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:40.130
Grows inside of a grasshopper,
his body,
and then when it's ready to be hatched,

332
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:44.600
it tricks the grasshopper into committing suicide.
Yeah.
Is it coming in?

333
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.823
All right,
here we go.

334
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.690
<v 7>Hello?</v>

335
00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:53.030
<v 6>Hello.
Mr McAfee.
Yup.
It's Joe Rogan.</v>

336
00:18:53.031 --> 00:18:53.864
How are you sir?

337
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:55.270
<v 7>Okay,</v>

338
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:56.490
<v 8>I'm doing good,
sir.
How are you doing?</v>

339
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.960
<v 6>I'm doing great,
man.
We're a,
we're online now.
So,
uh,</v>

340
00:18:59.961 --> 00:19:04.250
I want to thank you first of all,
for,
uh,
taking,
uh,
this,
this,
uh,

341
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.370
conversation with us cause you don't know anything about this podcast and you

342
00:19:07.371 --> 00:19:11.430
took a real chance and,
uh,
and doing this and I,
and I really appreciate that,
uh,

343
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:12.790
cause your story,

344
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:19.530
I'm saying your story is absolutely fascinating and it's a,
it really is a,

345
00:19:19.531 --> 00:19:24.440
a privilege to be able to communicate with you while all this is going on

346
00:19:24.441 --> 00:19:26.060
because it's,
you know,
as you know,

347
00:19:26.061 --> 00:19:30.530
your story has become a bit of a pop culture legend right now.

348
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.400
Um,
and for folks who don't know what the story is,
you,

349
00:19:34.401 --> 00:19:38.930
you founded a McAfee antivirus software,
a tremendously successful company,

350
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.110
but for the last five years you've been living in Belize.

351
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:46.790
So they live in like a character in a hunter s Thompson movie.
And,
uh,

352
00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:51.630
now you're,
uh,
you're in a bit of a hot water and your,
uh,

353
00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:56.510
you're,
you're on the lamb stating your case on your blog,
which is a official,

354
00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.590
what is the,
the blogs name?
The blog,
the uh,
the URL for the blog.

355
00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.173
<v 7>Yeah,</v>

356
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:09.180
<v 8>I'm sorry,</v>

357
00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.580
who is mcafee.com or Twitter is a facial McAfee

358
00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:18.880
<v 6>and who is mcafee.com.
You're updating like on almost a daily basis.</v>

359
00:20:18.881 --> 00:20:21.370
This is all a,
you're writing all this stuff man.

360
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:22.733
<v 7>Okay.</v>

361
00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:26.700
<v 6>So,
um,</v>

362
00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:31.620
that is a very rare situation where a guy's on the lamb and while he's doing it

363
00:20:31.621 --> 00:20:34.360
and he's making a blog,
are you doing this because you don't,

364
00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:38.620
you fear that your story's not going to get out there clearly incorrectly.

365
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:40.783
<v 7>Okay.</v>

366
00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.713
<v 8>Wow.</v>

367
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.020
So for people like Jeff Wise and,
and uh,

368
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:51.910
Joshua Davis of wired magazine,

369
00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:55.030
and so the story was radically incorrect as they portrayed it

370
00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.080
<v 6>sort of off the rails.</v>

371
00:21:00.081 --> 00:21:04.550
Nutter who's living in this beautiful country and uh,

372
00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:09.150
having a big party for your life.
It seemed like you were,
that's what that,

373
00:21:09.151 --> 00:21:10.130
that's how they portrayed it.

374
00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:11.873
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

375
00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.890
<v 8>To
quote specific drugs.</v>

376
00:21:16.891 --> 00:21:20.940
I say I was using like a MDPV,
which is methylenedioxy pyro.

377
00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.040
Velaro uh,
now anybody,

378
00:21:23.041 --> 00:21:27.990
anybody who knows it's about that drug knows it is the most addictive drug on

379
00:21:27.991 --> 00:21:32.190
the planet.
People who started cannot start,
which means that as we're speaking,

380
00:21:32.191 --> 00:21:37.170
I must be taking it.
So,
oh my God,
I'm sorry.
Rats or jumping out of my phone.

381
00:21:37.171 --> 00:21:41.340
So the question is,
um,
do I sound like a demented,

382
00:21:41.341 --> 00:21:42.710
paranoid schizophrenic or not?

383
00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:44.071
<v 6>Wow.
Well,</v>

384
00:21:44.071 --> 00:21:46.980
I would have to be like right next to you and looking in the eyes to answer that

385
00:21:46.981 --> 00:21:48.930
honestly,
because some people,

386
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:53.400
some people are really good at being smooth and keeping it together while

387
00:21:53.401 --> 00:21:56.190
they're all fucked up.
But this,

388
00:21:56.191 --> 00:22:00.420
these patients about this,
let's just say what you're wanting for.
First of all,

389
00:22:00.421 --> 00:22:04.410
your,
your next door neighbor turned up dead and,
uh,

390
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.210
you had to flee for your safety because you don't,
you,
you are,

391
00:22:07.211 --> 00:22:11.430
you're sure rather that there's some sort of a conspiracy and that they're going

392
00:22:11.431 --> 00:22:13.080
to try to not only blame you for that,

393
00:22:13.081 --> 00:22:16.080
but you believe even possibly harm you or kill you.

394
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.423
<v 7>Okay.</v>

395
00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:27.320
<v 8>I barely knew the gentleman.</v>

396
00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:30.520
<v 6>Oh,
okay.
And there was no dispute between you and this gentleman?</v>

397
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:35.560
There was no dispute between you and this gentleman.

398
00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:37.100
<v 7>Okay.</v>

399
00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:41.620
<v 8>Oh absolutely
not like my dogs.</v>

400
00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:50.490
He drank more than than,
than the average person.
Then I just,

401
00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.440
I didn't get along and he did not like the dogs barking at night.

402
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:58.420
Like frankly I didn't like them parking night either.
They ignored me so I,

403
00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:03.600
I understood his complaints but as,
as to being hostile or,

404
00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:05.323
absolutely not.

405
00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:07.960
<v 6>But someone poisoned your dogs.</v>

406
00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:09.600
<v 7>Okay.</v>

407
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.780
<v 8>They did.
And it was the night before.
It could not have been him.</v>

408
00:23:12.781 --> 00:23:16.310
He owned stocks himself or owned dogs.
Any dog love.
Right.

409
00:23:16.311 --> 00:23:18.960
I don't know if whether you have talked to not joke with no dog lover.

410
00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:22.980
No one who has dogs would ever,
ever arm another dog.
Certainly not that way.

411
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:27.270
And the poison us was the most horrible they were.
They were vomiting blood.

412
00:23:27.271 --> 00:23:29.820
They were shitting blood.
I had to put them out of their misery.

413
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.040
No one would do that through a dog that they love dogs.

414
00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:37.220
<v 6>So you feel like someone else was involved and they did it.</v>

415
00:23:37.621 --> 00:23:41.580
And this man is being connected to that because he died.

416
00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.290
Now why are they blaming it on you?

417
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:45.580
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

418
00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:46.220
<v 8>Okay.</v>

419
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.290
<v 6>I'll give you the history then.
The last day of April of this year,
uh,</v>

420
00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:55.030
I woke up at six in the morning,
two 42 armed soldiers in full riot gear,

421
00:23:55.031 --> 00:23:58.990
trying automatic weapons,
storming my property in orange walk on the river.

422
00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:04.450
Um,
though I was held in handcuffs behind my back from the song for 14 hours

423
00:24:04.451 --> 00:24:07.450
without,
without food or water.
I,
at one point,
by the way,

424
00:24:07.451 --> 00:24:10.780
I asked you a guard for food and water,
not just for me,
but for everyone else.

425
00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:15.880
The guards response was,
do I look like a chef to you?
Now,
indeed,

426
00:24:15.881 --> 00:24:20.170
he did not look like a chef.
So it was my mistake,
but it was not a pleasant day.

427
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:21.610
From that moment on,

428
00:24:21.611 --> 00:24:25.510
I've had nothing but problems with the police and government.
The day afterwards,

429
00:24:25.511 --> 00:24:28.950
I demanded an apology from the prime minister.
Um,

430
00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:32.080
and I've been vocal and outspoken opponent ever since.

431
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:36.380
Now they thought that you were running a meth lab.
That was the accusation.

432
00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:36.801
Correct?

433
00:24:36.801 --> 00:24:41.260
Because you actually were doing some legitimate scientific work according to

434
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:45.950
what I've read was that you were trying to work on some new antibiotic that

435
00:24:45.951 --> 00:24:48.980
comes from plants found in the rain forest.
Was that the idea?

436
00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:50.540
<v 2>Okay.</v>

437
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.910
<v 8>Well,
is this a new science called quorum sensing,</v>

438
00:24:52.911 --> 00:24:56.240
which involves communication between bacteria and there's not really an

439
00:24:56.270 --> 00:25:00.500
antibiotic.
It was a topical anti septic,
but the fairly magical one,

440
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:02.800
by the way,
a week after the raid,

441
00:25:02.801 --> 00:25:06.650
the government tried to charge me with Ronnie and antibiotics laboratory without

442
00:25:06.651 --> 00:25:11.620
a license.
Um,
that's sales because it's first of all,
no such logs.
This,

443
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:12.650
uh,

444
00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:16.220
after that they tried to charge me for hiring security cards without a license.

445
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.500
It's been going on nonstop for seven months

446
00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.220
<v 6>and the there now,</v>

447
00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:26.230
the other reason why they would suspect that there was some crazy drugs involved

448
00:25:26.231 --> 00:25:29.820
was because of forum posts that have been attributed to you,
um,

449
00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:32.850
that we're all about purifying w the,

450
00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:37.780
the chemicals known as bath salts and turning them into some crazy,
new,

451
00:25:37.781 --> 00:25:42.640
more concentrated form of something that makes you hypersexual.

452
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.260
And all these blog posts online were attributed to you.

453
00:25:47.261 --> 00:25:49.510
Are these something,
these things you actually wrote?

454
00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:55.970
<v 8>Oh,
absolutely.
I worked you.
This side is blue.
What?
Blue Light.</v>

455
00:25:55.971 --> 00:26:00.920
This is the largest drug form in the world.
Um,
and basically 10 years ago,

456
00:26:00.921 --> 00:26:04.460
a drug called m d t v Tan,
a mythical drug,

457
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:09.690
people claim to have found a with magical properties.
Um,

458
00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:10.400
and the,

459
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.000
the myth continues on my post was claiming to have rediscovered the formula for

460
00:26:15.001 --> 00:26:15.560
it.

461
00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:20.390
Now the chemists online of go about 200 chemists on blue light all said this is

462
00:26:20.391 --> 00:26:22.130
a hoax.
This is total nonsense.

463
00:26:22.131 --> 00:26:24.890
And they wandered off the rank and file follow through with it.

464
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.190
I am a practical jokester.
I have a lot of free time.

465
00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:30.230
And then I just like to have fun.

466
00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:34.160
Some however rediscovered that formula.

467
00:26:34.161 --> 00:26:38.870
I would go to bear bear laboratories in Germany with a formula and a sample and

468
00:26:38.871 --> 00:26:42.350
demand a check for $1 billion.
I mean,
what,
what,
what would I be doing here?

469
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:44.040
<v 6>Um,</v>

470
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.810
<v 8>so you,
you think you would get $1 billion for some drug that,
uh,</v>

471
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:52.240
makes you're hypersexual oh yeah.
Hot Rod.
6,000.
Okay.
Well,
let's,
let's say,

472
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:55.300
what do you think by Agra?
What's he saying that she,
Alice,

473
00:26:55.301 --> 00:26:58.340
what do you think all these sucks drugs are?
They are marital age.

474
00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:03.380
So a marital aid Ariful AIDS that enhance sex?
Yes,
I think so.

475
00:27:03.381 --> 00:27:06.770
I think the president would be doubt about is the president of the company would

476
00:27:06.771 --> 00:27:11.000
be down on his niece handed me the check going,
we now own the world.
Oh yeah,

477
00:27:11.001 --> 00:27:13.430
of course.
So I mean what once you think trucks are all about sir?

478
00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:15.320
<v 6>Well I,
well yeah I think,</v>

479
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:19.100
I think people draw the line with bath salts when you know,

480
00:27:19.101 --> 00:27:22.940
I don't know the actual effects of it physically because I haven't experienced

481
00:27:22.941 --> 00:27:24.200
them.
But when you know,

482
00:27:24.201 --> 00:27:27.350
you see them attributed to people biting people's faces off and shit like that,

483
00:27:27.351 --> 00:27:29.530
which is what we see in the news and the,

484
00:27:29.531 --> 00:27:34.531
the crazy stories on the air with.com if you go or a.org if you go and read the

485
00:27:35.061 --> 00:27:38.240
error,
would a trip reports of people who have taken that stuff.

486
00:27:38.241 --> 00:27:40.280
It doesn't seem like a good experience at all.

487
00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:41.780
So I don't know how that would be like

488
00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:46.120
<v 8>quality profitable posts or when it has nothing to do with bath salts.</v>

489
00:27:46.121 --> 00:27:49.990
It has to do with a drug called MTP v Chan right here.

490
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.520
We'd all of the methodology,
they had nothing to do with that.

491
00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:54.200
It was a purely sexual enhancement.

492
00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.880
<v 6>Okay,
so the bath salts,</v>

493
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:58.630
<v 8>my mind,
it has nothing to you guys.</v>

494
00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:01.050
They just attributed that to quote bath salts.

495
00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:04.080
This is again the mainline press doing what it does best,

496
00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.110
less sensationalized as best speech can.

497
00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:10.720
<v 6>So,
but you know all about these chemicals in pretty intimate a order.</v>

498
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:12.440
You mean you,
you know all the,

499
00:28:12.441 --> 00:28:16.300
the various different chemical names and you know enough to troll these people

500
00:28:16.301 --> 00:28:20.380
effectively.
Like so,
but you,
you,
you don't experience these drugs yourself.

501
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:26.850
<v 8>Of course.
I know a lot of things.
I know a lot about Ip address of rectification.</v>

502
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:30.690
I know not,
not know how to do it.
You know a lot of things that you do or not do.

503
00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:33.150
I read,
I read sir,
I have plenty of time.

504
00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:34.730
<v 6>Oh,
I believe,
you know,
I'm listening.</v>

505
00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.550
<v 8>First thing.
I won't,
I won't have our,</v>

506
00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:40.380
<v 6>I believe you,
you,
I mean,
I'm not,
I'm not,
uh,
saying that I don't believe you.</v>

507
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.090
I have no reason to question you.

508
00:28:42.091 --> 00:28:45.750
I'm just thought it was a very strange thing to do to write this really

509
00:28:45.751 --> 00:28:49.830
elaborate troll about sex.
You know,
about making,
you know,

510
00:28:49.831 --> 00:28:53.010
you wanna jerk off to your Dick Bleeds.
I thought it was hilarious.

511
00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:57.880
<v 8>Okay.
Well I thought it was hilarious too,
but some people did not.
Listen,</v>

512
00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.580
this is how your neck for me,
if you,

513
00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.980
if you search online for a thing called observational Yoga,

514
00:29:02.981 --> 00:29:03.940
let me tell you this story.

515
00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.280
A woman from the village voice running for the woman or the village.
Why?

516
00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:12.290
She called me to make a comment on the potty publicize lawsuit between the

517
00:29:12.371 --> 00:29:16.780
crunchy I'll was ready and a guy named Gregory Muccio and Greg were used to be

518
00:29:16.781 --> 00:29:20.770
one of my yoga is yoga students.
Uh,
she had no sense of humor.

519
00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.290
So she finally said,
what are you doing?
I said,
oh,

520
00:29:23.291 --> 00:29:26.650
I'm running a punch of observational from yoga studios and beliefs.
She goes,

521
00:29:26.651 --> 00:29:29.920
what's that?
I said,
well,
we've discovered that if you sit in an easy chair,

522
00:29:29.921 --> 00:29:33.730
drink wine,
and eat or jurors and watch people do yoga,

523
00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.910
you get exactly the same benefit.
And she said,
really?
So I stretched it on?

524
00:29:37.911 --> 00:29:38.351
I said yes,

525
00:29:38.351 --> 00:29:41.860
and we're still going to start opening up observational weight studios.

526
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.640
And I went on to say that it works for everything except we've had no sex with

527
00:29:45.641 --> 00:29:47.980
observations.
We'll pay the concert pianist.

528
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:51.640
We had people watch people play piano all day long and they still can't play the

529
00:29:51.641 --> 00:29:55.810
piano.
We don't know why.
Now obviously it's a fucking joke.
And what happens?

530
00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:58.380
She published a story,
check it out on the web.

531
00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:02.010
A long story about observational yoga.
I had friends,
fries,

532
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.520
requests from all over the world.

533
00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.233
<v 6>That's hilarious.</v>

534
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:10.750
You did have this chemical lab on your lot is developing this antiseptic.

535
00:30:11.421 --> 00:30:14.390
So that's where the confusion came in where people are like,
oh,

536
00:30:14.391 --> 00:30:17.940
so this guy actually has all this equipment but he's not,
you know,

537
00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:19.970
so you weren't,

538
00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:24.830
you weren't doing any of that stuff that was said in that blog that was all in

539
00:30:24.831 --> 00:30:25.221
humor,

540
00:30:25.221 --> 00:30:30.221
but did they find any of those chemicals and substances when they raided your

541
00:30:30.591 --> 00:30:34.010
place but they found them then they weren't illegal because those,

542
00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.900
those substances aren't illegal.
Technically.

543
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:46.160
<v 8>There was nothing in there,
but herbs that we had picked along the river,</v>

544
00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:51.560
a lot of alcohol because alcohol ethanol in order to extract what we were

545
00:30:51.741 --> 00:30:56.230
looking for microscopes and a bunch of other stuff.
It was me running a mess up.

546
00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.540
What on earth?
How would I sell it?
I would have to be competing with,

547
00:30:59.541 --> 00:31:04.180
this is up in Mexico,
the gang to cut people's heads off just for looking at the,

548
00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:08.700
<v 6>well that's stupid.
Just to play devil's advocate,
if I,</v>

549
00:31:08.701 --> 00:31:12.240
if you were going to be this incredibly rich guy,

550
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.060
which by all reports you are living in this country,

551
00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:17.190
having a 17 year old girlfriend,

552
00:31:17.191 --> 00:31:21.570
which by all reports you do and you were my friend applauds you.

553
00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:24.490
Congratulations.
Sorry.
I applaud you as well.
Um,

554
00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:29.780
and you were trying to have a good time and you were cooking up some stuff and,

555
00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:34.950
and I wouldn't,
I wouldn't necessarily think you would want to take it public.

556
00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:38.250
I would think that that in and of itself,
you know,

557
00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.820
cooking that stuff up and reporting about it online would,
would be enough.

558
00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:46.530
I mean if you were a poor person and it was a,
an amazing business opportunity,

559
00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:50.340
but I feel like a guy like you who moves down to believes with a shitload of

560
00:31:50.341 --> 00:31:53.310
money,
you're already in it for the vacation anyway.

561
00:31:53.311 --> 00:31:54.450
Why would you go back to work?

562
00:31:54.451 --> 00:31:59.350
Why would you really try to pitch some hypersexual meth?
You know,
I,

563
00:31:59.351 --> 00:32:03.360
I could see playing devil's advocate why people would think that that is the

564
00:32:03.361 --> 00:32:06.610
story.
Could you,
could you see white people?
We can tell us the story

565
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.080
<v 8>and
I hate to be cynical</v>

566
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:22.910
of lots of cash that turn some women on.
I'm sorry to say that.

567
00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.710
Then I will get trashed.

568
00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:28.960
<v 6>You're not going to get trashed.
That's honesty.
That's honesty,
man.</v>

569
00:32:28.961 --> 00:32:32.680
From your experience especially,
it's proven to be absolutely factual.

570
00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:35.890
So you are in a sense you're saying,

571
00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:37.323
<v 8>I'm sitting here with some</v>

572
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.040
been following the log and Samantha is probably,
she has,

573
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:48.310
she has more balls than any woman I have ever met and she is a fierce tiger,

574
00:32:48.681 --> 00:32:52.490
like ball of fire and she is looking at me now like she's going to rip one of my

575
00:32:52.491 --> 00:32:54.530
legs off or maybe both of my nuts.
I don't know

576
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:56.730
<v 6>how hot is it</v>

577
00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.750
<v 8>actually I'm talking about just as a,
as a,</v>

578
00:33:07.751 --> 00:33:10.690
as a tiger or someone that you would never ever want to fuck with,

579
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:12.063
<v 6>so</v>

580
00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:14.280
<v 8>she got more balls than me.</v>

581
00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:15.203
<v 6>I see what you're saying.</v>

582
00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:18.240
Well you're trying to say is that even though money's an aphrodisiac,

583
00:33:18.241 --> 00:33:21.810
it's not like you don't have respect for women and you respect women very much.

584
00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:31.630
<v 8>I know what motivates people.
I'd be stupid if I didn't.
Young girls.</v>

585
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.823
Let's face it.

586
00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:41.330
This is grass I'm in.
Dave says he wrote to keep me on the phone a long time.

587
00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:44.340
<v 6>Sure.
I will keep it on the phone as long as you need,
sir.
We'll,</v>

588
00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:47.260
we'll cool it down or down.
Take a deep breath

589
00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:53.213
for a moment.

590
00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:03.210
Hi Samantha.
How you doing?
What's going on?

591
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:07.400
Are you ticklish right?
Settle down.
Sorry.

592
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:11.280
My friend's retarded.
Are you having a,
you're a little bit angry.

593
00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:13.950
Why are you angry?

594
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:20.130
Because of what John just said.
I think what you said was fairly mild.

595
00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.550
He was just saying that you a,
you're a very powerful person.

596
00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:27.690
You've got a strong presence.
You're feisty.
Feisty.
Yeah.

597
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:30.810
I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
You got to give him some slack.

598
00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.260
So how long have you known John?

599
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:42.340
A year over year and a half.
Do you enjoy his company?
Would you,
uh,

600
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:45.760
would you be willing to,
uh,
to endorse his character?

601
00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:48.410
Does he use Norton and buyers?

602
00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.400
That's good.
So you guys have a good relationship.

603
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.710
Excellent.
All right.
You're a fascinating person.
Can I talk to John Again?

604
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:06.980
Thank you Samantha.
Thank you for that.

605
00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:09.533
<v 8>Seems</v>

606
00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:12.880
<v 6>do cheese and natural and radio.
She said she should have her own show.</v>

607
00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.440
<v 8>I want to get her on Howard Stern.</v>

608
00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.450
Howard Stern.
We'd find out what Sam was like in bed and I responded.
Yeah,

609
00:35:26.451 --> 00:35:30.570
we get Sam on.
Howard stern returned to what Howard was like in bed.
Whoa.

610
00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:33.980
<v 6>Jesus.
How dare you sir.</v>

611
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:39.390
You are living that life that everybody would say like one day man.
Fuck it.

612
00:35:39.391 --> 00:35:41.760
I just want to retired some awesome country,

613
00:35:41.761 --> 00:35:45.390
live on the beach and have lots of beautiful women around me.
That's you,
man.

614
00:35:45.391 --> 00:35:46.350
You're really doing that.

615
00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.673
<v 2>Okay.</v>

616
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:56.700
<v 8>Exactly.
Living the life.
Well,
you weren't here no matter where you're living.</v>

617
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:58.210
I swear it has been an improvement.

618
00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:02.830
<v 6>Well,
I,
I believe your situation right now is dire.
Um,
before this though,</v>

619
00:36:02.831 --> 00:36:07.200
you were living this magical life of retirement,
uh,

620
00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.860
fantasies.
What would Ben think of is like the perfect sort of a,

621
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:14.740
a place to live as an ex.
Pat,
why did you decide to move to Belize?

622
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:19.680
<v 8>It's the most beautiful country in the world.
Traveled.</v>

623
00:36:19.681 --> 00:36:23.110
I think there are a few countries I have not visited and beliefs is the most

624
00:36:23.111 --> 00:36:23.944
beautiful.

625
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:28.700
Allows me to have a talk right in front of my house for the boat.

626
00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.450
You can't do that in Florida and New York.
Anywhere on the Pacific.

627
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:36.010
The water is aquamarine blue.
The weather is spectacular.
You are around.

628
00:36:36.011 --> 00:36:39.310
The fishing is great.
The diving is great.
It's a beautiful country.

629
00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:42.590
<v 6>Did you have a bunch of friends that live down there before you moved?</v>

630
00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:45.860
<v 8>No,
I also would not as those here.</v>

631
00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.380
<v 6>Really?
Why is that?
Oh,
you wanted to get away?</v>

632
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:52.350
<v 8>Yeah,
get away.
That's the whole key.</v>

633
00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:56.610
<v 6>Um,
now w w what if anything,
does this have to do with you?</v>

634
00:36:56.630 --> 00:37:00.710
You had a business in America for awhile where you were doing some,

635
00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:02.920
explain what you were doing with airplanes.

636
00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:07.460
It was like some acrobatic sort of a contest you guys were doing with planes.

637
00:37:07.461 --> 00:37:08.294
Like what were you doing?

638
00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:10.253
<v 2>Okay.</v>

639
00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.100
<v 8>It was out of business at all.
I never took the time.
I never made it.</v>

640
00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:18.370
I lost $10 million on that whole affair.
It was just for fun.

641
00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.280
It was for myself and my friends.

642
00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:26.500
We flew these things called wing airplanes,
airplanes,

643
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:32.020
airplane engines,
but they look like motorcycles with wings.

644
00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:36.640
It is a kick in the ass.
My policy,
if you've ever done it,
you will get addicted.

645
00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.550
So for a few years,
that's what I was doing.

646
00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:44.890
<v 6>And then what happened that led you to quit doing it?
Didn't someone die?</v>

647
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:46.490
<v 2>Okay.</v>

648
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:50.450
<v 8>My nephew died and one of his passengers,
or there's a lawsuit from NASA.</v>

649
00:37:50.451 --> 00:37:54.340
The fact that I have,
I have,
I've had more lawsuits than God.
The um,
uh,

650
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:59.090
everything from someone tripping over a log on my property and suing me for $10

651
00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:03.220
million to a wrongful death from the passenger in my,
in my nephew's airplanes.

652
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.991
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

653
00:38:03.991 --> 00:38:07.560
That is an unfortunate aspect of our society that people look at any sort of a

654
00:38:07.561 --> 00:38:12.560
situation where it involves dealing with a rich person as possibly a,

655
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:14.970
an opportunity to hit the lottery.
You know,

656
00:38:14.971 --> 00:38:19.690
whether it's a altercations,
physical altercations,
or,
you know,

657
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.360
when a guy like you,
you know,
you're,

658
00:38:21.361 --> 00:38:24.900
you're obviously a very successful man and you become a target for shysters.

659
00:38:24.901 --> 00:38:25.734
Right.

660
00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:31.420
<v 8>Basically,
let me try,
this is strange.
I bought the house in Florida,</v>

661
00:38:31.421 --> 00:38:35.950
put a down payment down,
changed my mind a few days later and said,
you know,

662
00:38:35.951 --> 00:38:38.140
I'm declining to contract,
keep the down payment.

663
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:40.390
I was sued for half a million dollars.

664
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:44.560
Even though two weeks later they resold the house for hundreds of thousands more

665
00:38:44.561 --> 00:38:48.400
than my contract.
And they sued me.
Uh,
it's like,

666
00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:49.060
<v 2>yeah,</v>

667
00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.970
<v 8>unbelievable.
They had,
they suffered no loss.
In fact,</v>

668
00:38:51.971 --> 00:38:55.300
they suffered a tremendous game by me,
Carrie canceling that contract.

669
00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.800
It's a crazy world,
my friends.

670
00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.490
<v 6>Yeah,
it is a crazy world.
It's a crazy world.</v>

671
00:38:59.491 --> 00:39:03.550
And the legal system is most certainly not the most perfect setup.

672
00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:08.570
But um,
when,
when you moved to Belize,

673
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:12.880
um,
did you,
were you aware of what their legal system was like?
Cause he,

674
00:39:12.881 --> 00:39:16.580
you seem to be having a real hard time with like the powers that be there.

675
00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.970
Did you know that it was like kind of fucking sketchy down there.

676
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:21.420
<v 2>Okay.</v>

677
00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:24.780
<v 8>Oh,
of course.
I knew it was sketchy.
I didn't realize it was this sketchy.</v>

678
00:39:24.781 --> 00:39:28.500
I didn't realize it.
As a rich foreigner,
you are,
are,
you are,

679
00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.870
you are obligated to pay your dues.
That is,
you know,

680
00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:34.080
if you're going to donate money,

681
00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:37.790
I'm told I did more than $7 million worth of stuff in this country.
Uh,

682
00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:41.490
but I did it in a way that the powers that be could not skim anything.
You know,

683
00:39:41.491 --> 00:39:46.000
I bought boots for example,
for every police officer in orange walked history.
Um,

684
00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:50.360
and I put,
I demanded an accounting who can switch boots.
Now what?

685
00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:53.880
I'm going to be able to skim money off of that.
They say,
well,

686
00:39:53.881 --> 00:39:57.890
came up some money and let us fight the foods while they would keep 99% and buy

687
00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.550
two pairs of boots.
This is how it works.

688
00:39:59.551 --> 00:40:02.400
The rest would go to their families and in their own pockets.
Well,

689
00:40:02.401 --> 00:40:04.950
I don't play by those rules that it just is everybody off.

690
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:08.700
So the government says someone in for a donation.

691
00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:13.720
This is prior to the last election.
When I heard what I heard the amount,

692
00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:15.330
I said,
get the fuck off my property.

693
00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:19.440
<v 6>Well,
they are not used to people saying that.
How much are they asking for?</v>

694
00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:20.960
<v 2>Okay,</v>

695
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.960
<v 6>2 million,
$2 million.
Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

696
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:26.720
Well this is for one.
For one.

697
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:29.780
<v 8>We're going to make one day we're going to make my life better.</v>

698
00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.650
They were going to give me all sorts of preferences.

699
00:40:31.651 --> 00:40:34.440
I didn't want to hear the fucking preferences.
Get the fuck off my property.

700
00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.440
There is no argument.
There's no question.
There is no communication here.

701
00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:38.640
Just get the fuck off.

702
00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:40.910
<v 6>Yeah,
it seems to like that.
Just them off.</v>

703
00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:46.270
It seems like it would be nice to give them a little bit of money,
you know,

704
00:40:46.271 --> 00:40:50.550
a nice to if they're really have the altruistic notions in mind of you know,

705
00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:55.540
keeping the community and in good order and,
and governing things.

706
00:40:55.541 --> 00:40:59.860
Well,
but it seems like you're dealing with a and an ancient system of corruption

707
00:40:59.861 --> 00:41:02.260
that's almost unsurmountable when you deal with like,

708
00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:04.540
is that what they call a banana republic?

709
00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:10.700
<v 8>Uh,
if this is way below over that or call the police was founded by talented,</v>

710
00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.890
my pirate Sanders still controlled by pirates

711
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:14.410
<v 6>Saturday by pirates.</v>

712
00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:19.670
<v 8>You will,
you rule through fear and you collect debts through extortion.</v>

713
00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:20.870
This is the way life is,

714
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.140
<v 6>but they can't extradite you to America.
Is that,
is that the case?
Like if you're,</v>

715
00:41:25.141 --> 00:41:26.310
uh,
your lawsuits,

716
00:41:26.311 --> 00:41:30.150
like do you have to go to America to deal with the lawsuits involving the plane

717
00:41:30.151 --> 00:41:30.984
crash?

718
00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:33.243
<v 8>Well,
of course,</v>

719
00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:37.850
<v 6>you know,
you're not,
the legal system works.
If,
if anyone ever did get a judgment,</v>

720
00:41:37.851 --> 00:41:41.120
which no one has at all these lawsuits,
all of them have failed.

721
00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:45.350
I will settle nothing for a dime.
I don't care if it costs me $10 million,

722
00:41:45.351 --> 00:41:46.670
I'll pay it.
I will.

723
00:41:46.671 --> 00:41:51.260
I will find it rather than just someone a single time from suing me.
So,

724
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:54.200
but what if you ever do get a judgment taking collected anywhere?

725
00:41:54.201 --> 00:41:58.430
This is the way the world works.
So if they did find you responsible,

726
00:41:58.431 --> 00:42:00.030
it wouldn't matter.
They would be able to get to.

727
00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:03.030
So it's not that you're in Belize for that reason,
of course,
but

728
00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:08.440
<v 8>oh,
those can anybody I liked to,
they're lawsuit.
The airplane didn't blog to me.</v>

729
00:42:08.441 --> 00:42:13.300
I was not even there at the time.
Right.
Everything was kosher.
Accidents happen.

730
00:42:13.301 --> 00:42:15.910
I am sorry I lost a nephew in the,
in that crash.
So I,

731
00:42:15.911 --> 00:42:18.760
I'm sorry that that someone lost a father and a husband,

732
00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:23.050
but it was an accident for Christ sakes.
No one is going to find me guilty.

733
00:42:23.051 --> 00:42:24.500
It's ridiculous.
They say,

734
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:29.100
and this has been going on for seven years and it's just very down until you pay

735
00:42:29.101 --> 00:42:31.120
me,
but I will never pay.
I will never settle.

736
00:42:31.121 --> 00:42:35.080
I will fight this if it takes 50 years and constantly my last penny because I

737
00:42:35.081 --> 00:42:38.110
will not,
I will not submit to extortion.

738
00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:41.760
<v 6>Well it's,
it's kind of interesting that you would be held responsible for it.</v>

739
00:42:41.761 --> 00:42:45.450
When you think about the fact that who knows how many people die in motorcycle

740
00:42:45.451 --> 00:42:50.160
accidents every year and that's thought to be a respectable normal activity that

741
00:42:50.161 --> 00:42:52.890
although very dangerous when people die in it,

742
00:42:52.891 --> 00:42:56.190
you don't go immediately looking for someone to sue because they were involved

743
00:42:56.191 --> 00:42:59.190
in dangerous activity.
It's a,

744
00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:05.090
<v 8>I guarantee you you would if it was owned by Bill Gates or Steve Jobs or Wazniak</v>

745
00:43:06.711 --> 00:43:10.320
wore me.
Absolutely.
You would go after the person because that's what they do.

746
00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:14.340
<v 6>Exactly.
So now your situation is you,</v>

747
00:43:14.341 --> 00:43:18.540
you're on the run essentially.
Do you have official charges against you?

748
00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:20.050
<v 2>Okay.</v>

749
00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:22.530
<v 8>I have no charges whatsoever.
So you just like,</v>

750
00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:26.420
you know what they want for questioning.
However,
I know how this system works.

751
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:29.570
After the,
after the questioning I empty tanks,

752
00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:33.230
they can legally detain you for ever in this country with no charges.

753
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:37.760
And it's easy to mason jars because there's no law here.
Um,

754
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:40.160
even though even though it's on the books,
there no real law,

755
00:43:40.161 --> 00:43:43.190
the law is ruled by the powers in the party.
And so,
you know,

756
00:43:43.191 --> 00:43:45.540
I'm not turning myself in for questioning.
If you're going to crush him,

757
00:43:45.541 --> 00:43:47.540
he call me on the phone.
I'll be happy to talk to you.

758
00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:48.800
I'll answer anything you want to know.

759
00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.570
<v 6>But yet you still plan on staying in beliefs.</v>

760
00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:52.850
<v 2>Okay.</v>

761
00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:56.240
<v 8>It's my homes or I mean,
maybe you don't understand that,
that when you,</v>

762
00:43:56.510 --> 00:44:00.710
when you love the country and you love the people,
um,
and you love where you are,

763
00:44:00.711 --> 00:44:02.700
it becomes your home.
Um,

764
00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:06.710
so I don't care how bad it gets political Alec or how many nasty people show up

765
00:44:06.711 --> 00:44:10.220
at the top of the government.
I will find it.
I will find it.
I will not leave.

766
00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:15.300
<v 6>Oh,
I understand that.
That's your position.
Um,
and I,
I understand your passion.</v>

767
00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:20.160
It's just very unusual that someone would be willing to deal with such dangerous

768
00:44:20.161 --> 00:44:23.310
situations.
Um,
a lot of people,
uh,

769
00:44:23.311 --> 00:44:27.990
would not have that sort of resolve in committing to a place to live.

770
00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:29.680
<v 2>Okay.</v>

771
00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:33.540
<v 8>Oh,
when you're 67,
you're is very sense or you don't have a lot to risk.</v>

772
00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.560
<v 6>You say that,
man,</v>

773
00:44:35.561 --> 00:44:40.330
but you're going way out of your way to speak to people like myself to speak to

774
00:44:40.331 --> 00:44:42.970
Alex Jones today,
which I know you had a conversation with earlier,

775
00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:46.430
but talking to people at wired,
telling your case,
you,
you,

776
00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:51.440
you obviously have a vested interest in staying alive and invested interest in

777
00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:54.610
and telling the truth about your situation.

778
00:44:54.611 --> 00:44:57.430
You're not a guy that's like looking for at the end,

779
00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:16.420
<v 8>even if they do get their hands on me,
this is the way the system works.</v>

780
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:20.500
This is unjust.
They have been charged with bogus charges.

781
00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:25.240
My website,
which is who is mcafee.com,

782
00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:30.210
who is mcafee.com.
You will find email,

783
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:35.050
email.
The prime minister is listed there.

784
00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:39.010
Demand that these people get released.
This is injustice at the highest order.

785
00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:41.680
I may be an old man,
but they are all young men.

786
00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:45.520
One of them is in his early twenties for the brand new baby.
His wife,
by the way,

787
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:50.260
was arrested and held for a week with a newborn baby before she was released.

788
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:55.090
Um,
you know,
anybody who aids in a,
he was arrested,
a cab driver who helped me.

789
00:45:55.091 --> 00:45:58.780
He was arrested.
Um,
this is utterly,

790
00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:01.600
utterly absurd because you are my friend.

791
00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:04.060
You are therefore arrested and punished.
And by the way,

792
00:46:04.061 --> 00:46:08.590
the prisons here are no joke.
There are no beds.
You have concrete floors,

793
00:46:08.591 --> 00:46:12.040
there are other portlets.
There are no showers,
there is no fucking food.

794
00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:16.180
So please everyone go to my side,
who is mcafee.com.

795
00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:20.050
Look at the form mailed these idiots and asked for something,

796
00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:21.310
released these people.

797
00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:24.410
<v 6>Is there a way to resolve the situation?</v>

798
00:46:24.411 --> 00:46:29.411
Is there a way in the corruption that you're talking about sounds so

799
00:46:30.021 --> 00:46:34.400
overwhelming.
I mean,
it seems like if you go there and fight it,

800
00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:38.660
it's almost like swimming into the ocean and hoping to hit land.

801
00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.760
It's almost like an insurmountable task.

802
00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:42.873
<v 7>Okay.</v>

803
00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:46.900
<v 8>It's 70% of this economy depends upon tourism.</v>

804
00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:52.990
If the outside world gets pissed off and off,
the government will listen.

805
00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:56.710
If 70% of any economy disappears,
that country collapses.

806
00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:00.930
At some point they will have to yield.
I will stay like this.

807
00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:04.540
I will forever and I will continue to ride forever.

808
00:47:04.541 --> 00:47:05.620
Those are the only two options.

809
00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.280
<v 6>Well,
I can certainly tell you this.</v>

810
00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:11.740
Listening to your story has made me not want to go on vacation there.

811
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:14.560
I would never go on vacation because if the shit hit the fan,

812
00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:18.190
it sounds like the places controlled by fucking crazy people.

813
00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.113
<v 7>Okay,</v>

814
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.823
<v 8>well</v>

815
00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:32.620
harass you with law of swap music outside your house for hours.

816
00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.750
<v 6>If you,
I don't understand what you're saying.
If I did it,
you have to.
You have,</v>

817
00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:36.643
he wants you to eat

818
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:44.100
<v 8>blog and then I'm going to come after you and play in front of your house was a</v>

819
00:47:45.101 --> 00:47:48.610
wonderful man and he played some beautiful music.
But I will,
I will.
I will.

820
00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:54.330
Isn't that how they got Noriega out?

821
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:58.500
<v 6>Didn't they play Metallica or something like that?
I think they played,</v>

822
00:47:58.501 --> 00:48:02.890
like I said,
isn't that how they got Noriega to come out of,
uh,
he was,
uh,

823
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:05.590
held up in the house when they finally arrested him

824
00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:07.780
<v 8>three years.</v>

825
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:16.030
<v 6>Right.
Um,
so you,
you're still,</v>

826
00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:20.320
you still believe that this can be resolved and you can go back to Belize and go

827
00:48:20.321 --> 00:48:22.450
back to living your wonderful life in your home.

828
00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:27.780
<v 8>I really am crazy.</v>

829
00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:32.560
<v 6>So you believe that by exposing all this corruption short as it's sort of</v>

830
00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:36.660
shedding a turning a lot of negative publicity on the way the government is

831
00:48:36.661 --> 00:48:36.901
running,

832
00:48:36.901 --> 00:48:40.800
believes this could hurt their economy and it can make them reconsider and

833
00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:44.560
become nicer.
Like what's,
what's,
how's it going to get you back?

834
00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:51.650
I believe,
you know,
I certainly believe you,
but you,

835
00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:55.110
it just seems like you're in this situation where you're dealing with so many

836
00:48:55.111 --> 00:48:56.010
dangerous folks.

837
00:48:56.011 --> 00:48:59.820
I couldn't imagine you not wanting to just get the fuck out of there and maybe

838
00:48:59.821 --> 00:49:03.390
come back to America or our system of laws a little bit more obvious.

839
00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.150
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

840
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:06.890
<v 8>Okay.
Well,
there are a couple of issues.
Number one,</v>

841
00:49:06.891 --> 00:49:08.840
I'm traveling with a young woman whose life

842
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:22.250
threatening,
threatened,

843
00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:28.800
even suggested again.
So

844
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:37.000
<v 6>yeah.
Um,
or,
or don't be around people that are thinking about cutting you.</v>

845
00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:41.170
That's another option.
Figure of speech.

846
00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:45.580
<v 8>Yes sir.
I did not in any way mean to imply that she would ask do it.</v>

847
00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:49.890
<v 6>We know,
we know we were just joking around with you,
but let's listen man,</v>

848
00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:52.200
it's great that you have such a loyal companion.

849
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:56.530
<v 8>Please forgive me.</v>

850
00:49:56.530 --> 00:50:00.880
<v 6>It's great that you have such a loyal companion in this terrible time of crisis.</v>

851
00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:06.760
Now,
how are you,
uh,
I mean,
without giving away your location and you know,

852
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:10.990
giving away your methods of concealment,
can you tell us about how you're,

853
00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:11.860
how you're living?

854
00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:14.733
<v 8>Well,</v>

855
00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:22.130
some warm showers

856
00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:28.940
until you lose everything you have no what's truly valuable to me.

857
00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:32.930
Number one,
other than food of course,
hot showers,

858
00:50:32.931 --> 00:50:36.500
you have no fucking clue what life was like without it.
Um,

859
00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:38.540
so we're living on hog today.

860
00:50:38.541 --> 00:50:42.700
Now you may think we're living in a hovel of a fourth today.
I'm Irene,

861
00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:46.500
I'm in hog heaven.
Uh,
my life has not been exactly pleasant.
Uh,

862
00:50:46.501 --> 00:50:50.960
if I've been moving frequently,
sometimes every four hours,
sometimes once a day.

863
00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:55.550
Um,
again,
my biggest concern is making sure that Sam is safe.

864
00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:59.840
Um,
moving with Sam is a lot more difficult of course,

865
00:50:59.841 --> 00:51:04.280
because people are looking for a,
an elderly white man and a cute young girl.

866
00:51:04.281 --> 00:51:06.530
Well,
Gee Whiz.
Um,
you know,

867
00:51:06.531 --> 00:51:10.600
how hard is that the spot and yet we've managed for almost three weeks through

868
00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:12.140
AGSM already.
So no,
I can,

869
00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:16.190
I plan on continuing to do it until my dying day if necessary.

870
00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:21.650
<v 6>So the idea is not to hold up until you get this resolved.</v>

871
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:24.470
The idea is to just hold up to the end.

872
00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:26.320
<v 9>Okay.</v>

873
00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:29.830
<v 8>Well,
I guess this was all if I get this resolved.
So that is again,</v>

874
00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:34.850
to not go home with me and we go back to swimming and fishing and,

875
00:51:34.851 --> 00:51:36.280
and,
and sitting in the song.

876
00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:37.330
<v 9>Okay.</v>

877
00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:40.180
<v 6>Now you've used a bunch of different elaborate disguises too,</v>

878
00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:43.390
that you were pretty open with different things that you did to,

879
00:51:43.391 --> 00:51:44.590
to hide your appearance.

880
00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:45.930
<v 9>Okay.</v>

881
00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:46.580
<v 8>Yes.</v>

882
00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:47.413
<v 6>What did you do?</v>

883
00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:48.591
<v 8>I actually,</v>

884
00:51:48.591 --> 00:51:53.591
I actually at the Financial Times reporter Adam Thompson came,

885
00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.510
he was actually going to come in and,
and,

886
00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:59.640
and stay with us for a length of time and chronicle our fans.

887
00:51:59.641 --> 00:52:03.050
But she kind of freaked out after he got here and,
and,

888
00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:07.410
and it seriously freaked out the end and beg to leave after four hours.

889
00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:10.580
He didn't get four hours of tapes interview on his,
his,
um,

890
00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:15.140
his story will appear in the London Financial Times on the 7th of December.

891
00:52:15.141 --> 00:52:18.060
It shouldn't be a fascinating story.
Wow.
Um,
I felt,

892
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:21.990
I felt so much from that and I chose him because he wasn't objective wider.

893
00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:24.990
It did not occur to me.
And this is how stupid I am.

894
00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:29.940
Just someone who was a fine answer reporter might not be suited for this life.

895
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:35.240
<v 6>Wow.
So he at least he hung in there for four days,</v>

896
00:52:35.241 --> 00:52:36.920
so he'll get an accurate assessment.

897
00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.800
<v 8>No,
it's not a full decade.
Not even on it.
She hung in here for four</v>

898
00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:42.740
<v 6>Oh,
for four hours.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.</v>

899
00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:47.340
<v 8>I wrote,
I wrote on the block.
At one point,
Sam said,
she really,
I mean,</v>

900
00:52:47.341 --> 00:52:51.240
he really railed on,
she says,
I'm a girl.
I'm small.

901
00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:54.300
I'm 20 years old and I have more balls than you have

902
00:52:56.110 --> 00:52:59.700
before.
Pastor was really taken back and I laughed and said,
don't worry about it.

903
00:52:59.701 --> 00:53:02.490
She's got more balls than me to no,
take it personally.

904
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:05.210
<v 6>There's a,
there's an ebook about you that's,</v>

905
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:07.610
it started off as an article in wired,

906
00:53:07.611 --> 00:53:11.780
but it became so interesting that this writer can construct it.

907
00:53:11.781 --> 00:53:16.070
An ebook and a he,
there's,
they're selling it now,
I believe on Amazon,
right?

908
00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:21.340
<v 8>Oh yeah.
Josh Davis.
Yeah.
Josh is not one of my favorite people.</v>

909
00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.313
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

910
00:53:22.570 --> 00:53:22.910
<v 8>sure.</v>

911
00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:24.180
<v 6>You host do a</v>

912
00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:29.160
<v 8>story of the arrest and,
and the right.
I said,
okay,
I'm under this condition.</v>

913
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:32.520
If it's drifted devolves into a personality piece,

914
00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:35.820
I'm not going to cooperate because that's how people are wired.
Omics,

915
00:53:35.821 --> 00:53:39.780
personality.
I do have an outside environment,
which is interesting,

916
00:53:39.781 --> 00:53:42.570
but people prefer to write about whatever I am.

917
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:44.310
<v 6>Well,
you're an awesome personality.</v>

918
00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:49.110
I believe that you're an awesome personality.
I believe,
first of all,

919
00:53:49.111 --> 00:53:52.170
you're a very successful businessman.
You're obviously a very intelligent person,

920
00:53:52.171 --> 00:53:55.650
but let's be honest,
you're an awesome personality.

921
00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:59.430
You're 67 years old,
you're 67 years old.

922
00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:04.140
You live in the beach and believes in this incredible compound with 11 dogs.

923
00:54:04.350 --> 00:54:09.000
You have really hot girlfriends and the legend is you cook meth.

924
00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:12.720
That's a fascinating story.
People would want to hear that.

925
00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:16.260
Once they chip away at all that and get to who they really are.

926
00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:22.490
<v 8>This will not be a personality rise.</v>

927
00:54:22.491 --> 00:54:27.340
This will be a story about corruption and it ends up being an ebook with

928
00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:35.500
my favorite person.
Halfway through it,
I figured out what was going on.

929
00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.450
<v 6>I understand.
I understand why</v>

930
00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:43.840
<v 8>you can ask him,
listen,</v>

931
00:54:43.841 --> 00:54:47.710
I'm writing a story about you while you're writing a story about mine will come

932
00:54:47.711 --> 00:54:48.544
out first.

933
00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:49.311
<v 6>Well,</v>

934
00:54:49.311 --> 00:54:53.990
I understand that what's really important to you is to get out the reality of

935
00:54:53.991 --> 00:54:57.140
the corruption and believes and that's what was important about.

936
00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:02.600
But do you understand that more people are going to read that piece because they

937
00:55:02.601 --> 00:55:04.730
got a picture of you naked with a shotgun?

938
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:09.200
It's really hard to find pictures of me naked with a shotgun

939
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:10.460
<v 8>corruption.</v>

940
00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:13.910
<v 6>No,
but I disagree sir.
And this is why,</v>

941
00:55:13.911 --> 00:55:16.040
because I think it turns eyes on it.

942
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:21.190
And your amazing personality is making people aware of this corruption.

943
00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:23.120
That's how I'm becoming aware of it.

944
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:26.350
I wouldn't become aware of it if it wasn't for the fact that it makes for this

945
00:55:26.351 --> 00:55:30.620
sensational story,
whether or not most of the aspects of it are true or not.

946
00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:33.560
You have to understand that that's why people are paying attention.

947
00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:38.680
People love a crazy train wreck and a billionaire who's shirtless holding guns.

948
00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:40.610
That's the kind of shit people want to see.

949
00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:45.200
When a guy is 67 years old and he lives in a beautiful paradise with hot chicks

950
00:55:45.201 --> 00:55:47.810
and he's got a fucking gun and he's not wearing a shirt.

951
00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:52.900
That's the kind of shit people want to see through that you can get your story

952
00:55:53.571 --> 00:55:58.310
and your information and what's really important for you to to reveal this

953
00:55:58.311 --> 00:56:02.120
corruption,
but you have to understand that that makes it appealing.
That's,

954
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:04.520
that's what's exciting about it to people,

955
00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:15.700
<v 8>human
relationships.</v>

956
00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:19.440
<v 6>So Josh violated your trust.</v>

957
00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:24.100
<v 8>Very unjust fashion.</v>

958
00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:28.170
<v 6>So Josh violated your trust by,
by making it a personality piece.</v>

959
00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:29.723
Yeah,
I understand.

960
00:56:30.090 --> 00:56:34.200
So you're just not interested in revealing those aspects of your personal life

961
00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:37.680
and you thought that by having him and having him over in confidence,

962
00:56:37.681 --> 00:56:39.540
he would not make it about that.

963
00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:44.000
<v 8>I totally understand the agreement.</v>

964
00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:48.370
<v 6>I totally understand that sir.</v>

965
00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:52.330
<v 8>That was since it was,
I'm not a stupid person,</v>

966
00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:57.520
but still a little bit clever.
I go,
okay,
this is the way it is.

967
00:56:57.521 --> 00:56:59.800
I'm going to just use you as a springboard,
which I did.

968
00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:03.030
<v 6>Well and I appreciate that you did do that.
So that's how I,</v>

969
00:57:03.130 --> 00:57:07.600
how I found out about your blog and I think that's one of the most beautiful

970
00:57:07.601 --> 00:57:11.350
things about this day and age is that a guy like you really cannot be

971
00:57:11.351 --> 00:57:16.180
misrepresented because you can represent yourself and you can put your own words

972
00:57:16.181 --> 00:57:20.080
down in a blog and have an answer for every question instead of just leaving

973
00:57:20.081 --> 00:57:21.640
things up to your accusers.

974
00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:24.700
Especially in a situation like yours where you're on the run,

975
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:30.000
you still have the opportunity to put up your version of the things word for

976
00:57:30.641 --> 00:57:34.020
word,
exactly how you want it distributed and uh,
that,

977
00:57:34.021 --> 00:57:37.510
that's a rare thing about our time and this conversation that we're having right

978
00:57:37.511 --> 00:57:39.430
now.
Same thing.
You,

979
00:57:39.431 --> 00:57:42.880
you have a rare opportunity to state your case emphatically

980
00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:54.010
<v 8>telling him to fuck off.</v>

981
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:09.790
I'm talking to real time
the resources

982
00:58:11.670 --> 00:58:15.170
and you have the viewership listenership,

983
00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.540
which is completely different.
I can talk to you and you can ask me anything,

984
00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:23.640
my sexual preferences or stolen.

985
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:29.030
I will answer honestly because it comes from my lips.

986
00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.120
If I talk to CNN,

987
00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:35.350
they're going to edit it to the point that I still come off like a raving

988
00:58:35.351 --> 00:58:38.560
lunatic and coming out of the telephone.

989
00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:41.870
<v 6>It's a dying method of getting information.
It just,</v>

990
00:58:41.871 --> 00:58:46.490
it doesn't make sense the way it's broken up in commercials and designed to

991
00:58:46.491 --> 00:58:48.710
sandwich products in between that you don't want.

992
00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:52.130
It's a dying way of distributing information.
It just doesn't,

993
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:54.680
it doesn't hold up in the,
in the the age of the Internet,

994
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:59.950
but I think this is one of the rare cases in as far as like a big news story

995
00:59:00.231 --> 00:59:04.520
like yours where a guy gets to really tell his story to a bunch of different

996
00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:05.691
venues,

997
00:59:05.691 --> 00:59:09.410
whether it's Alex Jones or me or whether it's your blog or whether it's your

998
00:59:09.411 --> 00:59:13.250
Twitter,
you,
you a official macafee Twitter,
you,

999
00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:18.140
you were able to tell your side of things in a way that we've never seen before.

1000
00:59:18.141 --> 00:59:23.030
Like could you imagine when Oj was on the run if Oj a video blog and he got to

1001
00:59:23.031 --> 00:59:27.910
tell his story?
Yes,

1002
00:59:27.970 --> 00:59:29.740
possibly.
Yeah.
I mean,
who knows.
I mean,

1003
00:59:29.830 --> 00:59:32.700
Lee Harvey Oswald could have had a fucking blog.
That would have been a,

1004
00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:34.090
an interesting,

1005
00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:40.600
<v 8>it was Michael Jackson.
Remember that far back?</v>

1006
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:45.080
Michael Jackson and the young boy were headlines and then suddenly everybody

1007
00:59:45.081 --> 00:59:47.620
forgot about him and,
and,
and started looking at Oj.

1008
00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:50.390
So if it had to be a Michael Jackson,

1009
00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:55.540
<v 6>that's hilarious.
Um,
I don't think that's correct,
but,</v>

1010
00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:56.433
uh,

1011
00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:58.690
<v 8>but it was a joke.</v>

1012
00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:02.910
<v 6>I know it was a junk man.
I'm a,
I'm reacting to it as if I'm retarded.</v>

1013
01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:07.920
Bobo killed it.
Where was the monkey mind?
No,
no worries man.
Um,

1014
01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:09.120
do,
do you,

1015
01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:14.210
are you comfortable with this position of being this guy who's on the run and,

1016
01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:15.160
uh,
you know,

1017
01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:20.160
being this guy who's accused of a horrible crime and having this really crazy,

1018
01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:23.550
wild lifestyle?
Is this,
uh,

1019
01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:27.330
are you enjoying this stage of your life other than the fact that you're on the

1020
01:00:27.331 --> 01:00:28.164
run?

1021
01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:40.590
<v 8>Um,
I mean,</v>

1022
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:43.250
I would much rather have the freedom of movement.

1023
01:00:43.251 --> 01:00:47.960
I'd like to jump in my pool and sunlight and sit at the end of this talk and

1024
01:00:47.961 --> 01:00:49.280
throw a fishing line in the water.

1025
01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:52.840
Just getting the boat and Bob around for awhile.
But now this is,

1026
01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:57.100
this is not something I'm comfortable with.
It's something I'm coping with their,

1027
01:00:57.101 --> 01:00:57.900
there's a difference.

1028
01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:01.100
<v 6>How many people have a negative reaction to your lifestyle,</v>

1029
01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.500
to the lifestyle that you were leading before you got into trouble with the

1030
01:01:04.501 --> 01:01:08.430
Belize government?
The older guy with the young chicks partying all the time.

1031
01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:09.883
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1032
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.080
<v 8>Well I would say 90%.</v>

1033
01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:16.040
The partying all the time does not exist.

1034
01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:17.780
Not the way people think there was partying.

1035
01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:18.720
<v 7>Okay,</v>

1036
01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:22.260
<v 6>okay.
So I mean even just hanging out with a 20 year old naked,</v>

1037
01:01:22.261 --> 01:01:24.990
that shit's partying.
That's how I look at it.
I went to party with you.

1038
01:01:24.991 --> 01:01:26.920
I don't mean party and by like the,

1039
01:01:26.921 --> 01:01:30.280
the drugs that you were trolling people on taking,
um,

1040
01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:34.400
I don't mean to imply that,
but I mean to apply that you're living like a,

1041
01:01:34.401 --> 01:01:37.170
a pretty festive lifestyle down there.

1042
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.050
<v 8>I still enjoy that a little bit.
Here</v>

1043
01:01:43.610 --> 01:01:47.120
<v 6>was the,
the was there blow back from like the the locals at all?
Like,</v>

1044
01:01:47.121 --> 01:01:49.830
how do they feel about this older rich guy moving in and,

1045
01:01:49.831 --> 01:01:51.500
and banging all these young hotties?

1046
01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:00.043
<v 8>I hated it.</v>

1047
01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:01.310
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1048
01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:02.143
<v 6>He's,</v>

1049
01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:06.020
<v 8>then they would imagine their husbands in the same situation.</v>

1050
01:02:06.021 --> 01:02:08.870
Then suddenly I was the devil incarnate.

1051
01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:12.410
<v 6>Yeah.
Isn't that funny that people give a shit about what you can pull off,</v>

1052
01:02:12.790 --> 01:02:13.080
you know,

1053
01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:17.120
and shouldn't you be happy when you see a guy who's in his sixties is managed to

1054
01:02:17.330 --> 01:02:20.420
pick up some 20 year old hot chicks?
It everybody be happy.
This is that.

1055
01:02:20.421 --> 01:02:23.270
That's possible.
Why does one man success?

1056
01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:29.630
<v 8>I'm happy when I see anybody enjoying themselves and being happy because my God,</v>

1057
01:02:29.631 --> 01:02:32.620
you know the,
the person next to you,
it's just like yourself.
You know,
we're,

1058
01:02:32.621 --> 01:02:37.310
we're not,
we're not as separate as you think.
We are all each other and so yeah,

1059
01:02:37.311 --> 01:02:40.170
the,
the rational and sane person with a heart,

1060
01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:42.410
it's always happy when I see another person happy.

1061
01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:44.900
That's why we smile when other people smile.

1062
01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:45.461
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1063
01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:49.180
What is it about other people's success that for some reason with weak minded

1064
01:02:49.181 --> 01:02:52.110
people it is somehow or another they feel like it's taking away from them.

1065
01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:55.210
Like they want to attack you,
they won't attack you for your success.

1066
01:02:55.230 --> 01:03:00.190
A 67 year old guy that get bank,
20 year old girls wins everywhere in the world.

1067
01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:04.000
Is there any protection at the u s offers in a situation like this?

1068
01:03:04.001 --> 01:03:07.540
Like can you go to like the embassy or,
or,
or whatever the yeah,

1069
01:03:07.541 --> 01:03:08.374
that's a good question.

1070
01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:11.340
<v 8>Yeah,
of course.
I can go to the embassy.</v>

1071
01:03:11.350 --> 01:03:16.350
The problem is everybody has a false idea of how much power an embassy has.

1072
01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:22.060
It is a tiny little building in a foreign country.
Um,
uh,

1073
01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:24.570
I could go to the embassy,
there are two options afterwards.

1074
01:03:24.571 --> 01:03:27.750
I'd have to stay there forever.
Like Juliana Tsonga,
um,

1075
01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:31.110
or leave the embassy and face of media or the rest.
I mean,

1076
01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:34.590
I'm a see isn't going to go,
hey,
let this man out of prison.

1077
01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:36.180
They're going to say you do

1078
01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:39.600
<v 6>well,
you're a man of considerable resources.
I mean,</v>

1079
01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.300
I would think that a guy with a,

1080
01:03:41.301 --> 01:03:46.020
you're kind of wealth would be at least be able to arrange for some sort of,
uh,

1081
01:03:46.370 --> 01:03:51.300
uh,
uh,
illegal meeting with someone in the United States to help you get back.
Is,

1082
01:03:51.301 --> 01:03:52.400
has that been done at all?

1083
01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.770
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1084
01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:56.830
<v 8>Hello?
Well,
you're assuming I want to get back,
but you know,
as I stated earlier,</v>

1085
01:03:56.831 --> 01:03:57.940
I don't want to get back

1086
01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.810
<v 6>even just to get one belief,</v>

1087
01:04:00.310 --> 01:04:03.610
even just to get to safety mean while you're on the run.
I mean,
you,
you,

1088
01:04:03.611 --> 01:04:06.610
you would rather stay on the run and believes then be like comfortable in

1089
01:04:06.611 --> 01:04:08.740
America and just sort things out.

1090
01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:11.880
<v 8>I do not think I'm going to,
I don't think I'm going to be on the run forever.</v>

1091
01:04:11.881 --> 01:04:15.030
In fact,
I seriously do not think I'm going to be on the one from last longer.

1092
01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:18.420
What's the plan?
The government,
the government is not stupid.

1093
01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:22.830
And I know for a fact that the tourism has to have been impacted by this affair

1094
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:25.440
and not in a positive way,
sir.
Um,

1095
01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:29.570
and given the fact that tourism is 70% of the economy,
uh,

1096
01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:33.090
I believe that eventually common sense will prevail.
I really do.

1097
01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.630
And some accommodation will be reached.

1098
01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:37.090
<v 9>Okay,</v>

1099
01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:42.090
<v 6>so that's they have other suspects or do you know what's going on with the case</v>

1100
01:04:42.731 --> 01:04:43.720
of the guy who was murdered?

1101
01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:49.930
<v 8>Well,
if they have other suspects,
I pumped into pursuing them.
Um,
you know,</v>

1102
01:04:49.931 --> 01:04:51.940
they still have not named to me is the suspect.

1103
01:04:51.941 --> 01:04:54.940
They just named me as someone they want to talk to you.
But this is Felice.

1104
01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:57.470
The last person who gave him sit off in for,

1105
01:04:57.471 --> 01:05:00.100
for talking was a guy named Arthur Young.

1106
01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:04.810
They hand trust his hands behind his back and shot him 14 times in a police fan

1107
01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:07.990
because they claim with his hands handcuffed behind his back.

1108
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:12.940
He attempted to wrestle a weapon away from one of the 10 officers in there with

1109
01:05:12.941 --> 01:05:14.890
him.
Oh,
please get a clue.
People.

1110
01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:16.010
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1111
01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:19.200
<v 6>But yet you still want to there,
this is amazing that you,</v>

1112
01:05:19.201 --> 01:05:20.950
you think that this can be worked out.

1113
01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.390
<v 8>The average police policemen has,</v>

1114
01:05:31.391 --> 01:05:36.391
it has a decent person dollar an hour for Christ's sakes.

1115
01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:40.630
So obviously they're going to be corrupt,
corrupt to the point that they have to,

1116
01:05:40.631 --> 01:05:44.170
they have to augment their income in some fashion.
It's not the police.

1117
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:47.830
It's a very few,
highly,
very powerful.

1118
01:05:47.831 --> 01:05:50.010
How these place officials who are very powerful,

1119
01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:54.460
who have bled for this country dry.
This is the problem,
sir.

1120
01:05:55.550 --> 01:05:59.230
The people can,
people,
people can be removed from office.

1121
01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.950
<v 6>That's what I was just gonna say.
You're such a bad mother fucker.</v>

1122
01:06:02.951 --> 01:06:06.610
Why don't you just run beliefs?
You love it.
It's a great place.

1123
01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:10.890
<v 8>I don't want to run the voice.
I don't want any power.
I want to fish and play</v>

1124
01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.850
and enjoy my friendships

1125
01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:16.110
<v 6>and do it as the king of beliefs.</v>

1126
01:06:18.730 --> 01:06:19.563
You can run it.

1127
01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:23.260
<v 8>You have
a</v>

1128
01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:30.370
political person.
Good Lord.
I don't want that responsibility,

1129
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:31.690
<v 6>Mr. Magnesium.
I'm joking.</v>

1130
01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:34.280
I don't really think that you could ever be the king of beliefs.

1131
01:06:34.770 --> 01:06:35.603
It's just joking,
sir.

1132
01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:39.100
<v 8>No,
I understand that.
But keep in mind for my is nice humor.</v>

1133
01:06:39.110 --> 01:06:42.410
Maybe stress a little 10 due to my circumstances and lack of sleep.
Oh,

1134
01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.273
absolutely.

1135
01:06:43.850 --> 01:06:47.170
<v 6>Uh,
you,
you have been an amazing interview and,
uh,</v>

1136
01:06:47.330 --> 01:06:49.840
your character holds strong and,
uh,

1137
01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:53.140
in this terrible situation that you find yourself in,
you,
uh,

1138
01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:56.260
you can keep it together.
Admirably is very good talking to you.

1139
01:06:56.261 --> 01:07:01.261
I really appreciate you taking the time and using your cell phone credits and

1140
01:07:01.301 --> 01:07:02.410
uh,
you know,

1141
01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:05.970
<v 8>and
who is,</v>

1142
01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:11.920
who is mcafee.com and our Twitter side official McAfee

1143
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.560
<v 6>and McAfee for folks who don't know is spelled m c a f e,</v>

1144
01:07:16.561 --> 01:07:18.540
e m.
C,
a.
F.

1145
01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:23.100
I thought it was McAfee all this,
all these years.
I really,

1146
01:07:23.101 --> 01:07:26.490
I called it macafee over and over again.
It's McAfee.
Sorry about that.

1147
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:29.223
<v 8>That's what I believe.</v>

1148
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:31.850
<v 6>Well listen,
it was a,
it's an honor to talk to you sir.
Uh,</v>

1149
01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:34.490
I wish you all the best of luck down there and uh,

1150
01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:38.180
I hope you can find safety and security and everything works out.

1151
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:42.010
<v 8>Thank you very much.
Joe Official McAfee</v>

1152
01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:46.420
<v 6>on Twitter and who is mcafee.com.
Thank you sir.</v>

1153
01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:50.290
Ride like the wind,
my friend and,
and keep living that dream life,

1154
01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:55.150
Paula.
Well,
that's,
what was that like Brian?

1155
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:58.700
<v 5>Um,
that was interesting.
Fascinating.
Right?
Yeah.</v>

1156
01:07:58.701 --> 01:08:02.900
I think it's really silly that he wants to stay there though.
I,
if I was him,

1157
01:08:03.050 --> 01:08:04.910
I'd get the fuck out of there.

1158
01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:10.060
Deal with it from afar using lawyers or would like some other kind of way and

1159
01:08:10.431 --> 01:08:15.140
then return there when you can because it seems like it just doesn't seem smart

1160
01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:16.050
to what

1161
01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:20.450
<v 1>was very,
it was like conflicted because he would tell you that it's so corrupt,</v>

1162
01:08:20.451 --> 01:08:23.330
it's fucked up and the murder people and you turn yourself in,

1163
01:08:23.331 --> 01:08:27.050
they shoot you in the van.
Right.
And then he's like,
but it is my home and this,

1164
01:08:27.051 --> 01:08:29.310
those people,
I make a dollar an hour and it's like,
like,

1165
01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:32.630
I'm going to get dollar an hour so it's okay.
They shoot people in a fucking van,

1166
01:08:32.631 --> 01:08:35.660
like what's going on here?
Like he's all over the road.

1167
01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:37.790
<v 5>And if that could really say,
he was just gonna slice her throat,</v>

1168
01:08:37.791 --> 01:08:41.720
she probably murdered the guy,
you know?
She's like,
well,
this is money.

1169
01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:43.910
I'm not letting anyone get involved with this guy.
Yeah.

1170
01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:46.820
<v 1>Right.
Like he poisoned his dogs.
All right bitch.
I'll go.</v>

1171
01:08:46.830 --> 01:08:47.910
But shooting in the fucking head

1172
01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:50.900
<v 5>and poison like I want to know the dog.</v>

1173
01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:52.960
I don't believe that the girl did it though.
Yeah,
I don't eat it,

1174
01:08:53.050 --> 01:08:56.770
but I want to know like the dog being poisoned and like this guy that that has

1175
01:08:56.771 --> 01:09:01.680
been shot.
Is there any DNA going on?
Is there any,
well actually a good point.

1176
01:09:01.690 --> 01:09:02.720
Is there an answer that,
okay,

1177
01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:07.430
<v 1>what?
What is one way to tell is they actually,
when the guy was shot,</v>

1178
01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:12.110
they have a ballistics on the bullet and then when the dogs were poisoned,

1179
01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:16.430
McAfee had to put the dogs down.
So they actually dug up,
the dog's cut,

1180
01:09:16.431 --> 01:09:20.480
the dog's heads off,
and they took the dogs' heads to forensics labs.

1181
01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:24.800
So they were trying to prove that the bullets that killed the guy or the same,

1182
01:09:24.801 --> 01:09:26.900
the killed the dogs,
which would mean that McAfee,

1183
01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:28.910
but they haven't been able to do that.

1184
01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:32.600
And if they did that would be like big news.
You know,
they can't see,

1185
01:09:32.601 --> 01:09:36.590
they can't fake that kind of science.
If McAfee has the gun,
you can't,

1186
01:09:36.591 --> 01:09:40.550
that's ballistics.
You couldn't,
you couldn't rig ballistics.
People would say,

1187
01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:43.970
well,
can we see the bullet?
What did you do?
Like,
let's see the physical evidence.

1188
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:47.930
<v 5>Is there one hair of his at this guy's house while they,
well,
it</v>

1189
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:49.880
<v 1>could be that he visited the guy.
That doesn't mean anything either.</v>

1190
01:09:49.890 --> 01:09:52.850
They're their neighbors and they did have a dispute.
So they did communicate.

1191
01:09:53.270 --> 01:09:55.010
But you know,
the other thing that I didn't buy was,

1192
01:09:55.011 --> 01:09:57.950
so when he said that people who are dog lovers would never poisoned a dog.

1193
01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:01.730
There's some sociopathic assholes out there.
That's not true.
That's crazy.

1194
01:10:01.731 --> 01:10:03.560
There's people that want their sleep and they're like,
fuck it.

1195
01:10:03.561 --> 01:10:04.490
I'm going to poison his dogs.

1196
01:10:04.890 --> 01:10:09.390
There's definitely people who have dogs who will poison your dogs.
That I didn't,

1197
01:10:09.490 --> 01:10:12.230
that I didn't.
Uh,
but the other,
the other thing is like,

1198
01:10:12.231 --> 01:10:16.530
he knows way too much about drugs.
I've never done drugs.
Right.
That was nuts.

1199
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:19.320
What he's telling us,
all the different compounds and the,
the,

1200
01:10:19.321 --> 01:10:23.420
the sexual hype stuff,
if you read the stuff online,
folks,

1201
01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:27.170
if I think he said,
it's blue light.com.
Let me,

1202
01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:31.570
let me Google it for you on blue light.
It's fun.

1203
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:35.930
I don't know if it's true,
but it is fucking fascinating,

1204
01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:41.180
the story of this guy cooking this shit up.

1205
01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:46.250
I mean him,
he says it's just horse shit.
He says he was fucking around.
Um,

1206
01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.233
and trolling,

1207
01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:52.280
that dude could probably hack our computers if he McAfee.

1208
01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.230
And by the way,
he's,
you know,
he obviously has a troll a little bit like,

1209
01:10:57.231 --> 01:11:01.700
you know,
he does fuck around with people like the whole idea yoga thing.
No,

1210
01:11:01.701 --> 01:11:05.090
I don't think it is that they're really looking for him.
But the yoga thing,

1211
01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:09.880
you know,
like if it was a troll,
it's a brilliant way to,
uh,
to start up,
uh,

1212
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:12.470
like maybe just a blog.
I'd like to get people to read,

1213
01:11:12.471 --> 01:11:14.430
listen to and read his blog up and millions

1214
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:16.470
<v 4>of people reading this fucking blog.
Yeah.</v>

1215
01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:21.270
But voodoo chicken is the first guy who turned me onto it and he put it on the

1216
01:11:21.271 --> 01:11:25.410
Rogan board and I read his,
uh,
his take on it and I was like,

1217
01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:29.910
this is fucking bananas.
Like this,
this guy,

1218
01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:31.980
if he was really was doing that,

1219
01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:35.790
was hyper concentrating this drug,

1220
01:11:35.791 --> 01:11:40.440
whatever the fuck it is that makes you ridiculously hypersexual,
you know,

1221
01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.950
and then taking it and fucking this 17 year old girlfriend.

1222
01:11:45.570 --> 01:11:47.970
But the thing is,
he does have a 17 year old girlfriend.

1223
01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:50.760
He at least he did have a 17 year old girlfriend when he was doing this.

1224
01:11:50.761 --> 01:11:52.870
Now he's got a 20 year old,
you know,
she's tiny.

1225
01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:56.430
She's the one who was on wanting to cut them and asleep.
She's 20.
Wow.

1226
01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:59.960
Just joked about cutting them in his sleep rather.
Um,
so he,

1227
01:11:59.961 --> 01:12:04.860
he is obviously a little twisted just period,
sir.

1228
01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:09.720
Just yet sir.
Nothing wrong with it.
Nothing wrong with it.
Nothing wrong with it.

1229
01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:14.370
I mean,
but he's,
you know,
he's acting as if he's all respectable and everything,

1230
01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:17.760
but you still banging 17 year olds,
like he's not,

1231
01:12:17.761 --> 01:12:19.260
I'm not saying that he's doing those drugs,

1232
01:12:19.530 --> 01:12:22.050
but at least he knows a shitload about those drugs.

1233
01:12:22.230 --> 01:12:26.910
He knows enough to talk about it and he's banging a 17 year old

1234
01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.970
<v 5>and if you're really rich and your neighbor's dogs,
right.</v>

1235
01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:34.460
<v 4>Barking a lot.
Yeah.
Well see that.</v>

1236
01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:39.050
That's just speculation.
Who knows what the fuck,
you know,

1237
01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.820
who knows when it comes to that?

1238
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:46.000
Who knows whether or not the guide poisoned his dog.
But I do know that,
you know,

1239
01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:49.760
McAfee's he's,
he's out in,
they're having a great fucking time.

1240
01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:52.850
I don't think he's being completely honest.
Brought that whole drug thing.

1241
01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:56.020
He knows too much about that shit.
I don't know.
I don't know.

1242
01:12:57.190 --> 01:12:58.500
<v 5>Maybe he is just trying to make boner</v>

1243
01:12:58.570 --> 01:13:02.290
<v 4>pills.
Um,
I don't think that's what he's saying.
No,</v>

1244
01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:04.010
it doesn't give you a bonus.

1245
01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:08.660
It just makes you a really horny and likes you rub yourself and know,

1246
01:13:08.670 --> 01:13:10.360
like people were rubbing themselves raw.

1247
01:13:10.361 --> 01:13:12.820
He was saying that was his description of it,
which again,

1248
01:13:12.821 --> 01:13:16.930
could be fucking trolling.
It could be trolling.
I wish it wasn't though.

1249
01:13:16.931 --> 01:13:21.160
It's much more fun to think that it's just some nutty,
true story.

1250
01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:26.950
No,
I don't know,
man.
The guy is a,
he's quite a character.

1251
01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:30.790
But it's funny because he's not willing to,
you know,

1252
01:13:30.791 --> 01:13:35.560
like he was upset that this guy had written this piece about him that made him

1253
01:13:35.561 --> 01:13:39.130
out to be this wild fucking maniac.

1254
01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:42.970
But yet he's walking around shirtless with a fucking shotgun while they're

1255
01:13:42.971 --> 01:13:43.870
taking pictures.

1256
01:13:44.230 --> 01:13:47.800
Like it's really hard to find pictures of you shirtless with a shotgun

1257
01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:51.360
<v 5>shirtless just per period.
Yeah.</v>

1258
01:13:51.361 --> 01:13:55.440
But shirtless with his shotgun I take,
I keep my shirt on in the shower.

1259
01:13:56.490 --> 01:13:57.390
It's impossible

1260
01:13:57.450 --> 01:14:01.980
<v 4>to find a photo of you shirtless with a shotgun and less you're shirtless with a</v>

1261
01:14:01.981 --> 01:14:02.590
shotgun.

1262
01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:05.070
<v 5>Yeah.
And you own a shotgun.
Yeah.</v>

1263
01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:08.540
<v 4>Well he does live in living in Belize,
man.
And I thank you.
Would</v>

1264
01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:12.190
<v 5>silly if you're living anywhere where you need a shotgun,
you're probably</v>

1265
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:15.250
<v 4>not.
It's probably not the most amazing place.
Like what?
I,</v>

1266
01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:16.840
I have a doc in front of my house.

1267
01:14:16.841 --> 01:14:19.630
Well you can have a dock in front of your house in Ohio,
you know,

1268
01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:23.180
in front of a lake,
whatever.

1269
01:14:24.010 --> 01:14:29.010
So my Internet problem over at my office sucks of Fatty Dsl.

1270
01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:31.930
This is all I can get there privately.
No,

1271
01:14:31.931 --> 01:14:34.510
you can definitely get some kind of cable.
I don't know.

1272
01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:36.010
Solutions team like they have,

1273
01:14:36.011 --> 01:14:39.520
it might have to get something else like a t three or some shit.

1274
01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:42.610
I didn't even know how those work.
I have to get those installed.

1275
01:14:42.790 --> 01:14:46.640
I don't know what it is or expensive.
Uh,
stupid.
Stupid.
I've been,

1276
01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:49.240
I'm in a bad spot.
No,
you can get,
you can get cable.

1277
01:14:49.241 --> 01:14:54.241
I'm sure there's a time Warner or charter with four g internet you can't do like

1278
01:14:54.671 --> 01:14:58.110
from cell phones and shit.
It's too,
that's silly.
Not Strong enough.
No.

1279
01:14:58.111 --> 01:15:01.440
And you'll run out of bandwidth immediately,
right?
They would.

1280
01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:02.680
They would fuck you with that too.

1281
01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:05.590
Isn't it funny how like you can use all the bandwidth you want if you have an

1282
01:15:05.591 --> 01:15:08.080
internet connection,
but if you have a cellular Internet connection,

1283
01:15:08.081 --> 01:15:12.430
that Shit's cap motherfucker.
Yeah,
it's not ready yet.
It's,
well,

1284
01:15:12.431 --> 01:15:14.920
you're just sharing it with too many.
If you,
if everyone was doing that,

1285
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:18.730
no one would have so many people.
If they don't have access for that many people,

1286
01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:22.150
uh,
they don't have access for people streaming Netflix.

1287
01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:25.250
Like if everyone was streaming Netflix and doing video conferencing and that'd

1288
01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:28.300
be just reading.
I don't think they should give you an open ended device,

1289
01:15:28.330 --> 01:15:32.020
like a phone that has internet access on it and say you could only use it a

1290
01:15:32.021 --> 01:15:35.260
certain amount other than that's stupid.
I think that's that,
that,

1291
01:15:35.261 --> 01:15:38.470
that to me and if everybody uses it at the same time,
it doesn't work,

1292
01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:41.740
then you're selling too many phones because you don't have the backbone to deal

1293
01:15:41.741 --> 01:15:44.770
with it.
Well,
most of the time,
most people aren't using it,

1294
01:15:44.771 --> 01:15:46.540
so they'll tell we have it set up.
No,
no.

1295
01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:50.650
That's like saying that you're going to put all your money in the bank and then

1296
01:15:50.651 --> 01:15:53.080
the bank only has like half your money there.

1297
01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.510
And then when people want it all at once,
so while we don't have it,

1298
01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:59.620
well that's stupid.
What'd you do with my fucking money?
You can't,
they don't.

1299
01:15:59.650 --> 01:16:03.040
That's a bad analogy.
But point stands,

1300
01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:08.100
you shouldn't be selling a fucking cell phone with Internet on it until you have

1301
01:16:08.651 --> 01:16:12.160
the backbone to give everybody Internet.
If they use it all at once.

1302
01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:13.900
That's how it should be.

1303
01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:17.080
It should be that everyone with a fucking cell phone can use it and in time,

1304
01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:18.370
all day long,

1305
01:16:18.430 --> 01:16:21.970
every fucking cell phone could be downloading something big at the same time.

1306
01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:24.160
That's when you're ready.
That's when you're ready to sell it.

1307
01:16:24.161 --> 01:16:26.770
You fuck heads there.
They're selling it when it's not ready.

1308
01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.580
They're selling you some shit that's not quite there.
It's like,
well,

1309
01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:33.010
we kind of experimental.
It's almost there.
Well,
we call it four G,

1310
01:16:33.011 --> 01:16:37.060
but everybody can't use it at the same time.
Give it to us at all.

1311
01:16:37.630 --> 01:16:40.740
I'd rather them get their shit together.
Motherfuckers.

1312
01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:45.700
This guy's a McAfee's down there.
I guess he's using,
I don't know.

1313
01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:49.330
What kind of phone is your bank?
Robber phones.
Yeah,
those,
those portable ones.

1314
01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:52.120
That dude's get when they,
well wait.
He probably has satellite.

1315
01:16:52.330 --> 01:16:54.160
He's probably got the deed from virgin.

1316
01:16:54.161 --> 01:16:57.040
Probably dropped him on creative satellite phones.
Well,

1317
01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:58.660
I wonder if he has any friends down there.

1318
01:16:58.690 --> 01:17:02.800
That's what's really interesting and powerful.
He's doing it.
It's a,
it seems,

1319
01:17:02.801 --> 01:17:05.170
I mean I did want to ask him how he's hiding,

1320
01:17:05.171 --> 01:17:09.070
but he was pretty open about certain aspects of it and other interviews.

1321
01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:14.310
Color in his face like with shoe Polish and shit and,
and you know,

1322
01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:17.420
putting stuff in his mouth to make it look he's fat.
Well,

1323
01:17:17.421 --> 01:17:20.330
I'm thinking that he was just straight up dressed up as a girl,
you know,

1324
01:17:20.331 --> 01:17:23.900
I was doing that too.
That's a good mood.
But that will be obvious.
Not really.

1325
01:17:23.901 --> 01:17:28.580
I mean his girlfriend has balls,
she just has balls in her personality.

1326
01:17:28.581 --> 01:17:31.610
Brian,
he fucking 12 year old.
How dare you.

1327
01:17:32.170 --> 01:17:33.860
That would be funny if she had real ball.

1328
01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:38.120
That's got to suck though to be like almost 70 years old and fucking hiding.

1329
01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:43.350
<v 5>Yeah,
but it's also,
come on man,
just get out of there.
Are you being silly?</v>

1330
01:17:43.351 --> 01:17:46.020
If you're living in a country that has those kinds of laws,

1331
01:17:46.021 --> 01:17:48.480
like the laws where they can arrest you for life.

1332
01:17:48.510 --> 01:17:49.970
You don't want to live in that country because he's like,

1333
01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:52.500
if you do one thing wrong,
what you're going to go to prison.
You have that.

1334
01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:56.400
It might be pretty outside,
but you have to live in some kind of sick,
safe,

1335
01:17:56.490 --> 01:18:00.480
like no bullshit kind of government thing that there has to be laws.

1336
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:02.390
<v 4>Yeah,
I couldn't rock that.
I couldn't,</v>

1337
01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:06.020
I couldn't live down there where you got to worry about being when you get up,

1338
01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:09.110
it's almost ego for him staying there.
Well,
he's obviously got a big ego.

1339
01:18:09.111 --> 01:18:10.880
He's super successful guy.
All of those,

1340
01:18:10.881 --> 01:18:14.270
all super successful billionaire characters,
they all have strong egos.

1341
01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:16.820
They all think they're bad motherfuckers.
That's they are.

1342
01:18:16.821 --> 01:18:19.220
That's how they got to be where they are and then they see all these monkeys

1343
01:18:19.221 --> 01:18:21.380
that are asking them for millions of dollars and I'm like,
bitch,

1344
01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:24.440
you ain't running me out of town.
It's where I live.
He's got his house there.

1345
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:27.110
That's where he lives.
When you live somewhere for five fucking years,

1346
01:18:27.111 --> 01:18:30.620
that is where you live.
Um,
but 2 million bucks,
man,

1347
01:18:30.621 --> 01:18:32.060
they're asking for 2 million bucks.

1348
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:37.790
That's gotta suck some knocks on your door and ask you for $2 million.
Like what?

1349
01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:41.120
$2 million?
A lot of fucking money.

1350
01:18:41.121 --> 01:18:46.121
Even for a billionaire to give to some political douche rag in a crazy little

1351
01:18:46.641 --> 01:18:51.020
island that was founded by pirates or wonder what's going to happen here when

1352
01:18:51.021 --> 01:18:54.750
you know,
you do that ice house game where you,
uh,
you watch the video,
pause it,

1353
01:18:55.090 --> 01:18:56.720
you pause it and say what happens next?

1354
01:18:57.170 --> 01:19:00.920
And then you do a bunch of really fucked up endings to videos.

1355
01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:02.900
What if you had to do that with this?

1356
01:19:02.930 --> 01:19:05.120
If you had a pause this right now and say what happens next?

1357
01:19:05.121 --> 01:19:06.160
What would be your guests?

1358
01:19:06.930 --> 01:19:11.640
<v 5>Uh,
he gets arrested.
You think so?
Yeah.
Why do you think so?</v>

1359
01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:16.400
Well,
I mean it's just getting sloppy for him.
I think I like,
I mean like if you,

1360
01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:19.650
and unless beliefs has like,
you know,
a,
a donkey in their,

1361
01:19:19.651 --> 01:19:23.230
in their government office,
you know,
just sitting there with a bucket and like,

1362
01:19:23.250 --> 01:19:26.670
you know,
a donkey and they're like,
all right,
let's find this guy.
You know,
like,

1363
01:19:26.671 --> 01:19:29.040
I don't know how,
like,
like is this place high tech at all?

1364
01:19:29.041 --> 01:19:31.710
Do they have a real government?
Do they have a real,
you know,

1365
01:19:31.711 --> 01:19:35.100
like FBI type thing going on there?
That's a good question.

1366
01:19:35.101 --> 01:19:38.100
I don't even know how big believes is.
Yeah.
Like it could be like the whole,

1367
01:19:38.101 --> 01:19:40.440
the whole,
the whole,
you know,
people looking for them.

1368
01:19:40.441 --> 01:19:42.540
It could be like two guys in a jeep,
you know?

1369
01:19:42.710 --> 01:19:47.330
<v 4>Yeah,
that's true.
Right.
It could be like the Iraqi army before we invaded.</v>

1370
01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:52.310
<v 5>Yeah,
because I mean like it,
just listening to this whole interview,
you know,</v>

1371
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:54.770
I heard sounds in the background,
the sound,

1372
01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:58.390
at one point it sounded like somebody was tapping at bowl out.
Uh,

1373
01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:01.100
I heard what sounded like a dog at one point.

1374
01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:04.490
And so like if there was a guy really looking for this person,

1375
01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.680
I'm sure they could probably,
you know,

1376
01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:11.400
the decipher background noises and interviews and,
and Ip addresses.

1377
01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.001
And like,

1378
01:20:12.001 --> 01:20:16.860
they're really that phone number that he called from has to have a IP address or

1379
01:20:16.861 --> 01:20:19.660
some kind of like,
you know,
it's using a cell phone tower.
They've,

1380
01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:20.800
and this place isn't,

1381
01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:25.440
<v 4>he's a clever guy though.
I'm sure he's masking it somehow.
It must be satellite.</v>

1382
01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:29.340
Well,
he's on the ball as far as like technology's concerned.

1383
01:20:29.410 --> 01:20:33.310
I bet he being a virus,
uh,

1384
01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:36.120
the manufacturer of virus software,

1385
01:20:36.450 --> 01:20:39.930
the biggest one of the biggest virus software companies on the planet,

1386
01:20:40.050 --> 01:20:44.300
that guy must be so technologically literate.
He must know how to,

1387
01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:46.410
how to mask things and hide things.
And,

1388
01:20:46.450 --> 01:20:47.283
<v 5>well,
what,</v>

1389
01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:52.560
I wonder how much McAfee and Norton created virus in the 90s and 2009 they

1390
01:20:52.751 --> 01:20:56.530
created,
they created a company.
I mean,
if you think about it,
it's like,
hey,

1391
01:20:56.650 --> 01:21:00.760
there's these things called viruses c and then we have the way to stop them.

1392
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:01.623
You know,

1393
01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:04.860
<v 4>I actually never considered that,
but would be good business.
Fuck yeah.</v>

1394
01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:06.660
There'll be smart business.
If you could do that.

1395
01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:10.390
<v 5>He probably is trolling all of us with this virus.
Shit.</v>

1396
01:21:12.630 --> 01:21:16.860
<v 4>He invented viruses.
Yeah.
Came up with virus protection software.
Yeah.</v>

1397
01:21:16.861 --> 01:21:20.490
He's a bad ass mother fucker salts and 17 year olds.

1398
01:21:21.690 --> 01:21:26.580
This,
um,
this truck,
I want to know more about this fucking drug cause,
uh,
I,
I,

1399
01:21:26.670 --> 01:21:28.500
I've never heard of it before this

1400
01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:30.280
<v 10>mmm.</v>

1401
01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:35.110
<v 4>This situation because I had never known that there was anything that that makes</v>

1402
01:21:35.111 --> 01:21:36.520
you like hypersexual

1403
01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:38.443
<v 10>mmm.</v>

1404
01:21:40.650 --> 01:21:44.600
<v 5>Does Dick Pills I,
you know,
I take,
but those,</v>

1405
01:21:44.601 --> 01:21:49.160
they'll just make your dick hard.
Right.
They make it not go away though.
Like I,

1406
01:21:49.210 --> 01:21:53.270
they,
they,
they make you not be able to come.
Oh really?
Yeah.
And it's just like,

1407
01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:55.850
all right,
I have a quiet,
well,
I found it.

1408
01:21:55.851 --> 01:21:57.500
I've been doing a lot of research on him lately.

1409
01:21:57.530 --> 01:22:00.800
And what happens is the first couple of hours you take them,

1410
01:22:00.801 --> 01:22:04.760
you can get hard quick and,
and uh,
it's like,

1411
01:22:04.761 --> 01:22:07.340
it lasts a little long,
but you,
you can come on it.

1412
01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:09.890
But if you've tried to fuck like six hours later,

1413
01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:14.030
it's like you have a morning Boehner that won't go away and you can't come at

1414
01:22:14.031 --> 01:22:17.870
all.
What is in it?
It makes your decor.
I don't know.
I think it's aunts,

1415
01:22:17.871 --> 01:22:21.470
it's something extracted from aunts and it's called hot hot rod.

1416
01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:25.520
A 5,000 or I don't recommend leave work,
but it really works.

1417
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:28.280
I recommend it for special occasions,

1418
01:22:28.281 --> 01:22:32.240
but that Shit's rough when you have a hard on that they won't stop.

1419
01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:34.640
You can't come.

1420
01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:39.470
It's great if you have a 17 year old girl and you're running away doing yoga,

1421
01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:41.540
you're fucking her in a gutter.

1422
01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:45.860
<v 4>Yeah.
I don't know.
See this,
this thing about McAfee,</v>

1423
01:22:45.890 --> 01:22:47.480
I don't know if he,
uh,

1424
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:52.370
I don't know how much of it is really trolling or if he ever did do this stuff.

1425
01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:53.610
<v 10>Yeah.</v>

1426
01:22:53.610 --> 01:22:56.280
<v 5>Yeah.
I mean,
it's pretty funny that it's McAfee.
I mean,</v>

1427
01:22:56.281 --> 01:22:58.500
the whole thing sounds like a humongous troll.
I mean,

1428
01:22:58.501 --> 01:23:01.940
I haven't done any research,
so I have no idea of any of this is true.
I,
you know,

1429
01:23:02.090 --> 01:23:06.130
uh,
but what if it was,
you know,
just dude,
that's a great troll.

1430
01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:10.360
<v 4>Especially.
It's amazing.
What if it's Norton?
Wow.</v>

1431
01:23:12.700 --> 01:23:16.060
Yeah.
I don't know,
man.
The whole thing.
This and MDPV,

1432
01:23:16.061 --> 01:23:20.010
have you ever heard of this before?
Now it's recently banned in the US,

1433
01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:21.400
but it's legal and beliefs.

1434
01:23:21.970 --> 01:23:26.970
It belongs to a class of drugs called Catherine owns a natural source of which

1435
01:23:28.091 --> 01:23:32.740
is the east African plant cat.
You know,
a k h a t is,

1436
01:23:33.010 --> 01:23:36.760
that's that shit that,
um,
those guys take the Somali pirates,

1437
01:23:36.850 --> 01:23:40.630
they chew this stuff called cat and it's a,
it's like an amphetamine.

1438
01:23:40.631 --> 01:23:45.190
They chew it and they fucking go berserker if the fact that it's called cat just

1439
01:23:45.191 --> 01:23:49.360
makes me think this is more of a troll.
No,
no,
no.
The actual drug is a long,

1440
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:51.850
it's not,
it's more of a joke,
right.

1441
01:23:51.851 --> 01:23:54.610
More of more evidence of simulation theory.

1442
01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:58.360
MDPV is serious shit who explain his paranoia.

1443
01:23:58.361 --> 01:24:03.010
And so one of them on the website wrote his paranoid erraticness.

1444
01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:06.280
I've been through that.
I played with MDP be for about two weeks.

1445
01:24:06.281 --> 01:24:10.570
Then I started seeing shadow people in the corner of my eye and what amphetamine

1446
01:24:10.571 --> 01:24:15.430
heads called tree cops.
It's essentially really fucked up math.

1447
01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:19.090
Um,
I forgot to ask him about this.

1448
01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:24.220
He had some thing where he called into a guy from,

1449
01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:26.710
I think it was a guy from wire that he was talking to.

1450
01:24:26.711 --> 01:24:31.570
It might've been this Josh guy that he hates now and told him that the cops were

1451
01:24:31.571 --> 01:24:35.770
outside and that there was like 30 of them standing on the beach outside of his

1452
01:24:35.771 --> 01:24:38.770
condo and he couldn't move cause they would shoot him.

1453
01:24:38.890 --> 01:24:42.940
So he just stood there and they stood there and no one said anything for hours.

1454
01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:45.760
And they went away at like four o'clock in the morning and he's like,

1455
01:24:45.761 --> 01:24:49.870
it was fucking really weird,
really weird.
And so to escape,

1456
01:24:49.871 --> 01:24:54.871
he climbed into his neighbor's balcony and his neighbor found him covered in his

1457
01:24:55.391 --> 01:24:56.950
own urine.
Why?

1458
01:24:56.980 --> 01:25:01.450
That's the official story asleep and it pissed all over himself.
That's the,

1459
01:25:01.451 --> 01:25:02.470
that's the story.

1460
01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:07.150
Now whether or not I wanted to ask him whether or not that was true because if

1461
01:25:07.151 --> 01:25:10.060
he was suffering from extreme paranoia and this,

1462
01:25:10.061 --> 01:25:13.630
this statement that he gave explaining that these cops were out there and they

1463
01:25:13.631 --> 01:25:16.720
were just standing there staring at him and no one said anything and he couldn't

1464
01:25:16.721 --> 01:25:19.450
move.
Cause if he moved they were going to shoot him and he's talking about a

1465
01:25:19.451 --> 01:25:22.870
shoulder's killing him because he was leaning up against it and he dared not

1466
01:25:22.871 --> 01:25:25.990
move.
And then finally at like four 30 in the morning,
they just like went away.

1467
01:25:25.991 --> 01:25:30.700
It was like,
what kind of a Co Raisie story is that?

1468
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:33.250
I forgot to ask him about that one.
Caught.
Dammit.

1469
01:25:34.270 --> 01:25:37.190
I think the dude's might be on the MDPV.
Oh,

1470
01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:40.800
I don't want to be arrested.
He's got some bitch and tattoos.

1471
01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:45.260
I look at that as tribes sexy as fuck.
I don't want to be sued.
Now.

1472
01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:48.310
Would that be ironic if he sued us because we said he's coming.

1473
01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:51.280
It might be on it.
Yeah,
he did.
Did warn me.

1474
01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:53.590
I don't really believe he's on that shit.
I don't know.

1475
01:25:53.591 --> 01:25:55.270
I don't know what MDPV actually does,

1476
01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:58.900
but he was saying that you can't do it and not get addicted to it,

1477
01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:02.200
but apparently that's not necessarily true.

1478
01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.190
Like this guy was that he did it for two weeks

1479
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:06.110
<v 1>and he stopped doing it and he was writing a report on it.</v>

1480
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:10.130
There's a lot of reports in this shit.
Um,
he,

1481
01:26:10.750 --> 01:26:13.400
a Guy Paul early,

1482
01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:18.610
his a a addiction specialist and he warns about the dangers of NPV MDPV.

1483
01:26:19.731 --> 01:26:20.960
He says a hour experience,

1484
01:26:20.961 --> 01:26:25.820
clearly warrants of the psychiatric and medical dangers of this drug.

1485
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:31.000
We have cared for multiple patients who have abused MDPV and they report intense

1486
01:26:31.101 --> 01:26:35.000
and unpleasant visual hallucinations after a short bench.

1487
01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:38.000
That drug feels nontoxic with its first use.

1488
01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:43.100
But following moderate binge users suffer from mild to moderate paranoia.

1489
01:26:43.101 --> 01:26:46.610
And about 10% of them,
end of individuals who have,
who use higher doses.

1490
01:26:46.611 --> 01:26:51.611
We have observed a sustained psychotic state with intense anxiety lasting three

1491
01:26:52.611 --> 01:26:53.630
to seven days.

1492
01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:55.540
<v 11>Wow.</v>

1493
01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:01.360
<v 1>So this guy is just outright saying on Gizmodo that he used this stuff.</v>

1494
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:03.623
<v 11>MMM.</v>

1495
01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:06.790
<v 1>Even though McAfee is saying that it's all a troll,</v>

1496
01:27:06.791 --> 01:27:08.920
I think even if you don't know what to troll,

1497
01:27:09.250 --> 01:27:12.470
you have to say that McAfee says as a troll.
Right,
don't you?

1498
01:27:12.630 --> 01:27:17.510
<v 5>Uh,
yeah.
I,
I'm more,
I don't know.
I have no idea.</v>

1499
01:27:18.450 --> 01:27:20.010
I want to believe this guy,

1500
01:27:20.011 --> 01:27:24.750
but it's why it just makes no sense.
Like WWE,

1501
01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:25.711
like here's a lot of,

1502
01:27:25.711 --> 01:27:29.190
there's a lot of things in his story that just like a common sense person would

1503
01:27:29.191 --> 01:27:31.920
be like,
okay,
no,
I'm going to the u s embassy.
No,

1504
01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:35.160
I'm going to escape and figure this out.
You know,

1505
01:27:35.190 --> 01:27:38.820
I am not going to be living in wherever he's living in.

1506
01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:39.691
<v 1>Yeah.
You would say,</v>

1507
01:27:39.691 --> 01:27:42.360
I've got to get in the boat and I'm going to fucking go to Cuba.
Right.

1508
01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:45.000
Or whatever's close.
I mean,
if I believe where's bleach?

1509
01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:49.530
I don't know how far away that shit.
I don't know it just South America.

1510
01:27:49.650 --> 01:27:53.580
I have no idea.
Each son of a bitch.
I'll tell you what in the bellies picture,

1511
01:27:53.610 --> 01:27:56.790
if you go to [inaudible] dot com it's all just white people,

1512
01:27:56.820 --> 01:28:00.180
white people holding hands.
My other bull barefoot with their feet up.

1513
01:28:00.210 --> 01:28:02.010
Isn't it having a time of their life like people

1514
01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:05.310
<v 5>both the least connected to United States in a way like,</v>

1515
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:07.410
isn't that like are they are buddies?
Yeah.

1516
01:28:07.411 --> 01:28:11.520
Like isn't it supposed to be like we were like a Puerto Rican kind of thing?
No.

1517
01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:15.890
Or Am I thinking of somewhere there?
Oh Wow.
Wow.

1518
01:28:15.970 --> 01:28:18.180
$199 flight to Billy's

1519
01:28:21.050 --> 01:28:22.400
$149.

1520
01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:26.100
<v 1>It's very cheap.
It is cheap.
Where the fuck is believes?</v>

1521
01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:29.640
It says that specific properties of the drugs that he was attempting to isolate.

1522
01:28:29.641 --> 01:28:34.590
This is all in the Gizmodo article by the way.
I take no credit for this.
Um,

1523
01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:39.000
the specific properties of the drugs he was attempting to isolate also fit in

1524
01:28:39.001 --> 01:28:43.710
well with what those closest to him have reported that he is an enthusiastic

1525
01:28:43.711 --> 01:28:48.711
amateur pharmacologist with a long standing interest in drugs that induce sexual

1526
01:28:48.721 --> 01:28:51.310
behavior in women.
Indeed,

1527
01:28:51.450 --> 01:28:56.450
former friends of McAfee have said he could be extremely persistent and devious

1528
01:28:58.261 --> 01:29:02.370
and trying to coerce women who rebuff his advantage,

1529
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:06.030
<v 6>his advances to have sex with him.
Okay.
With us.
See that's just like when you,</v>

1530
01:29:06.031 --> 01:29:09.690
when you see an article like that,
it written about something like that.

1531
01:29:09.870 --> 01:29:12.570
Like that seems to me like you have to have examples.

1532
01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.820
You can't just say that because you can say anything about anybody.

1533
01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:17.520
I can say that about,
you know,
you,
I could say like,
you know,

1534
01:29:17.521 --> 01:29:21.620
Brian Red Ban has been known to be extremely vindictive and women who ignores

1535
01:29:21.630 --> 01:29:24.900
advances and he's an amateur pharmacologist.
But where's your,

1536
01:29:25.050 --> 01:29:28.140
you have to have evidence to say some creepy shit like that,
don't you?
Well,

1537
01:29:28.141 --> 01:29:31.170
I mean he did have a chemical lab in his house when they raided it didn't there.

1538
01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:35.610
But if he's telling the truth that he was using it to make an antiseptic,

1539
01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:40.250
a natural antiseptic,
I mean,
I don't know who the fuck knows what the grant does.

1540
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:43.560
Who does that?
Oh No,
not me.

1541
01:29:43.561 --> 01:29:46.560
But whoever invented antiseptics in the first place.
I mean,
who,
who,

1542
01:29:46.710 --> 01:29:50.790
who has a lab that does anything if you're living in the rain forest,
which,
uh,

1543
01:29:50.791 --> 01:29:55.170
I think believes in like a rain forest,
all of the medical,
uh,

1544
01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:57.480
like modern medical breakthroughs.
Not all of them,

1545
01:29:57.481 --> 01:30:02.250
but a big percentage of them come from plants that are discovered in remote rain

1546
01:30:02.251 --> 01:30:03.230
forest.
I mean,

1547
01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:06.870
he did say that he was just walking around and picking out plants by the creek

1548
01:30:06.871 --> 01:30:10.640
and stuff.
There's a lot of people that fucking trip on plants,
you know,
they,

1549
01:30:10.650 --> 01:30:15.420
they,
they love botany.
You know,
Terence Mckenna was a botanist.

1550
01:30:15.690 --> 01:30:18.720
They,
I think there's a lot of people that become in love with the idea of these

1551
01:30:18.750 --> 01:30:22.530
different fascinating plants.
Plants are really,
I mean,

1552
01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:25.350
if we found them on other planets,
we'd be shitting her fucking pants.

1553
01:30:25.530 --> 01:30:29.370
There's so many weird plants on this planet.
You know,
somebody straight.

1554
01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:33.180
There's a a flower that just bloomed recently.

1555
01:30:33.181 --> 01:30:36.600
I guess it doesn't bloom very often,
but it's the world's largest flower.

1556
01:30:36.810 --> 01:30:41.280
She'd get a picture of it.
I think it's an Australia.
It looks crazy.

1557
01:30:41.281 --> 01:30:45.480
It looks like some fucking alien thing from a little shop of horrors,

1558
01:30:45.481 --> 01:30:49.380
one of those little,
uh,
things that eats people.
Yeah.

1559
01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:53.070
It doesn't even look real.
And apparently it's smells like rotting flesh.

1560
01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:59.830
<v 4>Oh really?
Yeah.
Plants are creepy as fuck,
man.
There's plants that eat things.</v>

1561
01:30:59.831 --> 01:31:03.280
There's plants that trick rats into fallen in them and then they close up on the

1562
01:31:03.281 --> 01:31:06.610
rats and digest them.
No,
that's not,

1563
01:31:06.611 --> 01:31:10.930
it is the world's largest flower blooms.
If he just,
uh,

1564
01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:14.680
just Google world's largest flower blooms.
Yeah.

1565
01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:19.630
That's not blooms
on yesterday.
Nope.

1566
01:31:19.690 --> 01:31:23.980
That's not it.
It was really three.
Sorry.
Yeah,
that was really recent.

1567
01:31:25.150 --> 01:31:29.050
Yes.
That's it.
Look at the size of that thing.
It's that,
it's,
it's Switzerland.

1568
01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:34.180
Look at the size of that thing.
It's insane.
Cause like corn on the cob cock.
Yeah.

1569
01:31:34.181 --> 01:31:39.060
It does look like a corn on the cob.
Exactly.
Look at the size of it though.

1570
01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:43.120
It's an amazing holy shit.
And it grows like a deck.

1571
01:31:43.460 --> 01:31:45.310
It's sprouts and the,
the,

1572
01:31:45.311 --> 01:31:49.120
the deck pops out and the flowers underneath that mean it is,
when I say huge,

1573
01:31:49.121 --> 01:31:54.010
I mean how many feet is that is?
Well,
it's taller about looks like 12 feet maybe.

1574
01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:57.850
At least.
Yeah.
It's,
its towering over these people that are looking at it.

1575
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Does it say there how it is a 2.27 meters tall.

1576
01:32:03.670 --> 01:32:07.000
Okay.
So it's only like six feet a meter.
Three feet,
right?

1577
01:32:07.810 --> 01:32:12.490
2.2 yeah,
I think a meter.
Three feet.
Wow.
Amazing though.

1578
01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:16.060
So it must be on a platform so it makes it look even bigger,
but it's God,

1579
01:32:16.061 --> 01:32:20.890
it's fucking incredible.
The variations to seven meters.

1580
01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:26.110
Oh,
did you ask Siri?
Siri doesn't know shit.
Watch Siri.
Fuck this up.

1581
01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:31.230
Looking like you confuse bitch.
This might answer your question.
It's,
yeah,

1582
01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:35.620
it's 7.4 feet.
Finally Siri,
Sherri got something right.

1583
01:32:35.650 --> 01:32:37.760
<v 5>Siri's been upgraded a lot lately.
I don't know if you really,</v>

1584
01:32:37.810 --> 01:32:40.060
you could even buy movie tickets now.
He'd just be like,

1585
01:32:40.061 --> 01:32:42.340
I want real estate's tickets now by them.

1586
01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:45.700
<v 4>Do you have to have an APP that it connects you to do that?
I don't know.</v>

1587
01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:49.240
Does it have to have your cell phone,
your credit card stored on your phone?

1588
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:52.270
I don't know.
You don't know?
I haven't done it.
How do you know it works?

1589
01:32:52.630 --> 01:32:55.410
I just saw it on,
cause you're an apple fan boy

1590
01:32:57.930 --> 01:33:00.300
<v 5>by the way.
Just to get that new phone soon.
Oh cool.</v>

1591
01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:04.410
I got the first time I ever got one of those.
A hard drives to SSD hard drives.

1592
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:08.190
That's the only way to go in the future.
Just they're beautiful 10 times faster

1593
01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:12.150
on a rendering audio that I'm doing on it

1594
01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:16.280
<v 4>and they're supposed to be more,
um,
more reliable.
Look,
they don't break as easy.</v>

1595
01:33:16.610 --> 01:33:19.310
I've had a bunch of hard drives fail.
Yeah.
Shit's annoying.

1596
01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:20.510
And all of a sudden your,
your,

1597
01:33:20.511 --> 01:33:24.110
your beach balls just spinning on your desktop and like the fuck's going on.

1598
01:33:24.150 --> 01:33:27.870
<v 5>If there was a machine and you were held down and strapped in and uh,</v>

1599
01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:32.530
they're the answer,
the real answer to this guy,
McAfee,
you know,
you know,

1600
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:35.940
is he guilty or not guilty?
And if you had to choose one,

1601
01:33:35.970 --> 01:33:39.600
and if you choose wrong and he's black date goes shoved into your mouth and he

1602
01:33:39.601 --> 01:33:43.020
comes in you,
uh,
which one would you pick?
I don't think he killed anybody.

1603
01:33:43.170 --> 01:33:44.003
You don't think he killed anyway?

1604
01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:47.690
<v 4>It might be wrong.
So that would be your answer,
not give it.</v>

1605
01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:51.270
If I had to make an answer of not guilty or guilty,
I would say not guilty,

1606
01:33:51.450 --> 01:33:56.310
but I don't.
Um,
I don't have a,
you know,

1607
01:33:56.610 --> 01:34:00.640
I don't know.
It's a stupid answer.
I don't have any information.
I don't know,

1608
01:34:00.930 --> 01:34:05.930
like to be connected to yes or no is to me it seems a silly choice.

1609
01:34:06.870 --> 01:34:09.630
Like there's a lot of people that make choices about shit,
you know,

1610
01:34:09.631 --> 01:34:12.750
like whether someone was guilty or not guilty and they get all and Nancy grace

1611
01:34:12.751 --> 01:34:16.140
on things and you know,
and sometimes they're fucking wrong.

1612
01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:20.300
Like Nancy grace was with the Duke Lacrosse case,
you know,
there,

1613
01:34:20.301 --> 01:34:22.250
those guys were innocent and they,

1614
01:34:22.251 --> 01:34:27.251
there was a rape and Nancy grace like for days was on TV accusing them of doing

1615
01:34:27.811 --> 01:34:30.790
it.
I mean,
while they were set up,
they didn't do shit.
It was,

1616
01:34:30.810 --> 01:34:34.170
it was all false accusation and eventually the,
the charges were dropped,

1617
01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:39.560
but Nancy grace was committed to it on her show because it's salacious because

1618
01:34:41.971 --> 01:34:43.560
it's,
it looks like that's the,

1619
01:34:44.490 --> 01:34:48.900
that's a good thing to be upset about this.
Too much fuckery in this world.

1620
01:34:48.930 --> 01:34:51.780
Too much fuckery to know what,
what exactly what's going on.

1621
01:34:51.781 --> 01:34:52.620
Unless you were there.

1622
01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:57.030
You got to really look at all the parts and for this guy who the fuck knows

1623
01:34:57.170 --> 01:35:00.800
happened?
Who knows what he's doing?
If he really was doing that MDPV

1624
01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:05.500
<v 5>and then somebody killed your dog and you're high on fucking boner.
Hold on</v>

1625
01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:06.470
<v 4>right there.
Okay.</v>

1626
01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:11.740
If that guy really was doing MDPV and all those people on Gizmodo or telling the

1627
01:35:12.021 --> 01:35:15.170
truth,
or the guy,
uh,
about,
you know,
on Gizmodo is telling the truth,

1628
01:35:15.171 --> 01:35:17.270
but all the people you talked to,
then Dan,

1629
01:35:17.271 --> 01:35:21.230
the guy's a liar and everything he says has to be questioned.
Everything.
He says,

1630
01:35:21.231 --> 01:35:25.580
if he really never has done that mdpv right then,
you know,

1631
01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:28.310
then we could look at him and go,
wow,
maybe this guy's being set up,

1632
01:35:28.311 --> 01:35:31.580
but if he has done it and he lied about that just on the show,

1633
01:35:31.581 --> 01:35:35.000
if he told that false version of himself for any reason.

1634
01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:36.933
<v 12>Yeah.</v>

1635
01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:38.550
<v 5>You know,</v>

1636
01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:41.820
and you've got to say you can't trust them the way he doesn't want to leave.

1637
01:35:41.821 --> 01:35:46.010
Like,
no,
I will not pay to like he's got this,
you know,
you know,

1638
01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:50.550
edge to them where it makes me think that if he was high on some kind of fucking

1639
01:35:50.551 --> 01:35:55.110
drug where whatever,
and somebody killed your dogs,
you know,

1640
01:35:55.170 --> 01:35:58.110
and you're a guy that has a machine gun and,
and,

1641
01:35:58.140 --> 01:36:01.980
and you don't like shirts much and you're high on this shit.

1642
01:36:02.010 --> 01:36:05.280
I could see him just raging going like,
no,
you don't know who you fuck with.

1643
01:36:05.281 --> 01:36:10.140
You know?
Maybe,
but who knows if he's,
if he's telling the truth,

1644
01:36:10.141 --> 01:36:14.980
then I don't know.
Hmm.
Yeah.
It's killing your dogs.
It makes,

1645
01:36:15.110 --> 01:36:17.160
will make people rage.
That's like a child.
Oh yeah,

1646
01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:22.370
<v 4>yeah,
yeah.
Who knows?
Who knows?
If I had to guess though,</v>

1647
01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:27.290
I would guess a,
apparently he knew a lot of bad people down there.

1648
01:36:27.710 --> 01:36:30.110
He hung out with a lot of gangsters and believes,

1649
01:36:30.111 --> 01:36:34.300
which is probably a smart move your rich guy,
surround yourself with uh,
you know,

1650
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:35.360
thug life

1651
01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:36.980
<v 5>because it seemed like he would hang out with thugs.</v>

1652
01:36:36.981 --> 01:36:38.960
He seems like would hang on the yoga dude's,
well,

1653
01:36:38.961 --> 01:36:41.690
at least in that one photo that we were showing during the thing,

1654
01:36:41.691 --> 01:36:44.450
but then that other fully where he has the gun,
he kind of looks like,
okay,

1655
01:36:44.451 --> 01:36:45.440
that guy is craziness.

1656
01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:48.100
<v 4>I bet he would have been a fun dude to hang around with before all this shit</v>

1657
01:36:48.101 --> 01:36:52.270
with Doug.
But he's shy,
but he still is.
But who knows,
man.

1658
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:55.550
I want to know what this a airplane thing is.
Uh,

1659
01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:59.440
that looks like a look like a motorcycle.
Is that what he said?

1660
01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:04.840
Like a little like a kite.
What does it,
what the fuck did he call it?

1661
01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:08.830
Mcafee.
Mcafee plane.
But yeah,
no,
don't look upset.

1662
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:10.343
<v 12>Hmm.</v>

1663
01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:13.510
<v 5>Airplane.</v>

1664
01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:15.470
<v 12>Okay.</v>

1665
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:19.530
<v 4>Accident it.
Done.
It's,
um,</v>

1666
01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:22.290
it sounds like,
like wild,
nutty,

1667
01:37:22.291 --> 01:37:27.291
fun to get on some kind of a fucking motorcycle like kite.

1668
01:37:27.930 --> 01:37:29.400
<v 5>Yeah.
Or I wouldn't do it</v>

1669
01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:34.440
<v 4>with you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What is it?</v>

1670
01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:36.480
I wonder what the fuck it is.

1671
01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:40.070
<v 12>Hmm.</v>

1672
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:44.570
<v 4>Yeah.
Plagued by lawsuits.
Even like way before this in 2010,</v>

1673
01:37:45.050 --> 01:37:47.720
it talked about him a hiding and Billy's,

1674
01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:55.520
and now he hopes to give something back by deriving antibiotics from plants in

1675
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.903
<v 1>Belize.</v>

1676
01:37:59.090 --> 01:38:03.290
<v 4>Seems like it's like,
he's definitely a dude who likes attention.
I like,</v>

1677
01:38:03.291 --> 01:38:06.590
it was pretty easy to get him to come on the podcast and talk.

1678
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:11.120
There must be part of him that's enjoying a little bit of this notoriety he's

1679
01:38:11.121 --> 01:38:16.121
experiencing here or he just wants to make us and everybody know about it.

1680
01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:20.960
Kind of like a news type thing because you know,

1681
01:38:20.961 --> 01:38:23.150
in the more people know about it,
if he does get caught,

1682
01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:28.310
people are going to like be like,
oh yeah,
no doubt.
No doubt that too.
No doubt.

1683
01:38:28.311 --> 01:38:30.040
That to the whole thing is,

1684
01:38:30.050 --> 01:38:35.000
I mean the fact that he wouldn't see how it being a personality piece would lead

1685
01:38:35.001 --> 01:38:37.820
people to um,
pay more attention to it.

1686
01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:42.890
Smiling with this fucking gun in his hand,
looking straight at the camera.

1687
01:38:44.130 --> 01:38:47.540
By the way.
It's not,
it's not just one photo of him like that.

1688
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:52.610
If you look at the photos of him online,
like the first three,

1689
01:38:52.611 --> 01:38:55.250
if you look under his McAfee photo images,

1690
01:38:55.460 --> 01:38:58.490
the first three are of him topless with guns

1691
01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:03.860
is quite a character though.
Man.

1692
01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:06.590
I would've loved to have hung out with him before all this.

1693
01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:11.270
It seems like a fun guy to talk to.
I bet you get a little drunk with him.

1694
01:39:11.271 --> 01:39:12.410
He's got some great stories.

1695
01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:13.493
<v 12>Okay.</v>

1696
01:39:14.830 --> 01:39:18.640
<v 4>W you know,
that's that thing that people talk about,
like doing that.</v>

1697
01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:24.120
Go down to a small island country somewhere and just live out my life.

1698
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:29.230
She's riding my boat around and live in right by the water.

1699
01:39:29.470 --> 01:39:32.560
But how many people actually fucking do that?

1700
01:39:33.330 --> 01:39:34.060
<v 12>Okay,</v>

1701
01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:35.050
<v 4>very few.</v>

1702
01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:39.130
You have to be some special kind of weird motherfucker to actually go through

1703
01:39:39.131 --> 01:39:39.964
with that.

1704
01:39:40.330 --> 01:39:44.710
Become an ex pat and just kick back on the beach and not even know people there.

1705
01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:50.260
I Dunno.
It's kind of cool out.
We got to talk to them.
Yeah,

1706
01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:53.760
<v 1>it was one of the things that I was saying yesterday when we were talking to a</v>

1707
01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:54.150
Shane Smith,

1708
01:39:54.150 --> 01:39:57.870
like one of the selfish reasons for starting this podcast is I want to have

1709
01:39:57.871 --> 01:39:59.940
conversations with these people.

1710
01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:02.880
I want to have conversations with guys like Dave Asprey.

1711
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:06.210
I can't just get them to have a conversation with me,
you know,

1712
01:40:06.270 --> 01:40:09.000
but to have a conversation where you broadcast broadcasted all of a sudden it's,

1713
01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:11.490
you know,
fairly easy to get ahold of people.

1714
01:40:11.491 --> 01:40:13.350
It seems like that would be the opposite.

1715
01:40:13.710 --> 01:40:17.040
Like people would be less likely to talk to you for hours on end if they knew it

1716
01:40:17.041 --> 01:40:19.890
was being broadcast.
But actually that's not the case.

1717
01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:24.660
Dennis Mckenna is coming on the podcast soon.
The brother of a Terence Mckenna,

1718
01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:30.150
he's got a book out about,
uh,
his,
uh,
time with his,
uh,

1719
01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:34.110
with his brother.
And,
uh,
by all accounts,
it's pretty bad ass book.

1720
01:40:34.111 --> 01:40:35.160
And we'll probably have a,

1721
01:40:35.161 --> 01:40:38.880
Mitch Schultz will be joining him who is the producer of Dmt,

1722
01:40:38.881 --> 01:40:40.080
the spirit molecule.

1723
01:40:40.350 --> 01:40:45.090
So we'll talk science psychedelic compounds and uh,
his brother,

1724
01:40:45.091 --> 01:40:49.310
the great Terence Mckenna and Dennis is a fascinating guy to,
um,

1725
01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:54.370
he had,
uh,
well I don't even want to tell the story,
but uh,
there's

1726
01:40:54.370 --> 01:40:59.080
<v 4>uh,
some great accounts of his own psychedelic experiences that maybe he'll get</v>

1727
01:40:59.081 --> 01:40:59.900
into.

1728
01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:04.450
He had some fairly psychotic episode where I don't think he,
uh,

1729
01:41:04.510 --> 01:41:07.660
I think he lost his sanity for a couple of weeks off a DMT?
No,

1730
01:41:07.661 --> 01:41:11.920
for mushrooms in the Amazon.
Yeah.

1731
01:41:11.950 --> 01:41:16.480
It's supposed to be a pretty intense story.
Hopefully he'll tell it to us.
Good.

1732
01:41:16.481 --> 01:41:21.280
Terrance talked about it in depth in some of his books.
Um,
and then,
uh,

1733
01:41:21.281 --> 01:41:25.780
we've got Duncan Trussell uh,
tomorrow and um,

1734
01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:30.250
Eddie Bravo on Thursday and the next to,
hopefully it will be in the new studio.

1735
01:41:30.251 --> 01:41:33.220
If we could figure out a way to work out that fucking shitbag Internet

1736
01:41:33.221 --> 01:41:33.970
connection,

1737
01:41:33.970 --> 01:41:38.060
you would think that in this day and age there would be more options that every

1738
01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:42.100
building there is apps.
I bet you there is options there.
I think.

1739
01:41:42.190 --> 01:41:45.670
I think I'm going to have to get like a t three lines stalls need to call Time

1740
01:41:45.670 --> 01:41:49.840
Warner or the other one.
Hello My,
my business manager saying that they're,

1741
01:41:49.841 --> 01:41:51.580
they're having a hard time falling.
Finding

1742
01:41:51.660 --> 01:41:56.040
<v 5>business manager also acts a Dso got upso well they got me DSL because that was</v>

1743
01:41:56.041 --> 01:41:59.990
the only option available.
But that's,
you can't even do it studio on Dsl.
He,

1744
01:41:59.991 --> 01:42:02.540
I mean he should be like a,
hey look,
he doesn't know what it's dude,

1745
01:42:02.541 --> 01:42:04.110
you know and tails.
How did I know?

1746
01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:06.750
How the fuck are they supposed to know this guy said no.

1747
01:42:07.230 --> 01:42:11.100
Well how was she sells the most?
But if you say a studio,
if it's the fastest

1748
01:42:11.170 --> 01:42:12.730
<v 4>Internet you have,
they'll go,
okay,</v>

1749
01:42:12.731 --> 01:42:15.580
we'll take it and then you get it and it sucks the fat Dick.

1750
01:42:16.270 --> 01:42:19.090
You don't know until you try it.
Like most people have no idea.

1751
01:42:19.091 --> 01:42:22.540
Like I didn't know it wouldn't be adequate if you said three megabytes download,

1752
01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:25.810
I'd be like,
all right,
that sounds good.
Go that.
That's like double a t one line.

1753
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:28.690
A T one is like 1.5 megawatt.

1754
01:42:28.710 --> 01:42:33.350
<v 5>So we have 120 gig download here.
And you had a three?
Yeah,</v>

1755
01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:38.310
our upload here is I think 40 up make upload.
You had

1756
01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:42.780
<v 4>less than one.
Less than one.
Yeah.
That's wack.
Weak ass pictures.</v>

1757
01:42:43.470 --> 01:42:48.470
You got to fix it at t and t Uverse get a fat pipe to my office or heads will

1758
01:42:50.501 --> 01:42:53.860
roll.
No,
actually I'll just cancel.

1759
01:42:54.250 --> 01:42:58.120
I need to find out what all the options are as far as like,

1760
01:42:58.750 --> 01:43:01.690
like dedicated lines.
Like when they do an ISD n line,

1761
01:43:01.691 --> 01:43:05.140
when someone has to uh,
like do the radio.

1762
01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:08.230
I know like people have radio studios,
they have like a dedicated line.

1763
01:43:08.350 --> 01:43:11.350
I'm pretty sure that kind of Shit's not as good as,
no,
it's,
it's terrible.

1764
01:43:11.351 --> 01:43:15.340
But I'm saying I wonder if they can do that with like a t one or a t three and

1765
01:43:15.341 --> 01:43:18.190
not a t one.
Two one's not good enough,
but like a t three line or something.

1766
01:43:18.191 --> 01:43:20.530
Just the fiber.
That's all you need.
They don't have it though.

1767
01:43:20.650 --> 01:43:25.060
They have cable or not.
Will Not in my area,
not in the area of my offices.

1768
01:43:25.570 --> 01:43:30.250
My office is,
he doesn't.
No one does.
How do you know that?
Because they've looked,

1769
01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:32.980
they just sent me an email explaining all the different shit that they don't

1770
01:43:32.981 --> 01:43:34.270
have.
No,

1771
01:43:34.510 --> 01:43:38.470
no cable known this so that they don't expect people to want like anything

1772
01:43:38.471 --> 01:43:40.690
better than this.
In those areas.
Most people,

1773
01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:42.490
they're regular businesses is just involves.

1774
01:43:42.710 --> 01:43:46.700
<v 5>So you're saying that that there for sure there's no cable or there's no fiber</v>

1775
01:43:46.701 --> 01:43:49.010
through eight it's time Warner or any of the other companies.

1776
01:43:49.011 --> 01:43:52.520
Tom Warmer where time Warner or a and t or any,
yeah.

1777
01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:57.280
<v 4>No,
it's not charter.
No.
Those fucks.
That seems impossible.</v>

1778
01:43:57.460 --> 01:44:00.910
It seems like it.
But it's true.
If that's true,
you're screwed.
I'm fucked.

1779
01:44:01.180 --> 01:44:04.270
But cellular four g cellular is not good enough.

1780
01:44:04.650 --> 01:44:06.910
And honey would take it before Jan left at cell phone,

1781
01:44:07.270 --> 01:44:08.860
Ladies and gentlemen out there listening,

1782
01:44:08.890 --> 01:44:13.430
surely you must have some sort of a fucking solution.
Tech.

1783
01:44:13.570 --> 01:44:15.940
I can't,
Shit.
That would suck.

1784
01:44:16.090 --> 01:44:18.580
<v 5>That was the one thing I told you I was like,
before you get it,</v>

1785
01:44:18.581 --> 01:44:21.190
make sure they have fascinating.
And that's the most important thing.
Yep.

1786
01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:25.960
<v 4>They said they did those Fox,
we'll work it out.
Freaks.
We'll work it out.</v>

1787
01:44:25.961 --> 01:44:29.440
Oh my God.
I don't believe Your Business Manager.
It's not their fault.

1788
01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:32.530
I don't believe it.
No,
I don't believe him.
You don't have,
I don't believe.

1789
01:44:32.531 --> 01:44:35.140
I believe that there's,
well,
we'll get off the phone and we'll figure it out.

1790
01:44:35.141 --> 01:44:39.730
Okay.
Um,
we'll get off to the line.

1791
01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:42.280
Anything else you want to add with this?

1792
01:44:42.281 --> 01:44:45.640
This weekend we're going to be in Austin,
Texas.
That should be a fucking blast.

1793
01:44:45.670 --> 01:44:48.940
It's a,
a quick weekend in and out.
You freaks.
Um,

1794
01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.780
and then next weekend I am uh,
the,
the,

1795
01:44:52.781 --> 01:44:57.070
the following weekend we're in Seattle,
uh,
at the,

1796
01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:01.960
what the fuck is the name of the comedy club?
The polar live,
that's it.

1797
01:45:01.961 --> 01:45:03.940
It's in Bellevue,
Washington.
I emailed you about that.

1798
01:45:03.941 --> 01:45:07.690
That you put that on the tall.
I'd have to check my email check emails,
son.

1799
01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:11.620
<v 5>I sub check.
Do you check your email?
I'm starting not to check my email now.</v>

1800
01:45:11.650 --> 01:45:15.250
Like voicemail died recently for me.
I don't like or regular mail.

1801
01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:17.380
I don't do regular mail anymore.
Voicemails.

1802
01:45:17.381 --> 01:45:19.990
I don't like listening to voicemails now.
Like if I have a voicemail on my phone,

1803
01:45:19.991 --> 01:45:24.280
I don't even look at it.
And now recently email,
I just,
I'm like giving up.

1804
01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:28.890
<v 4>Like,
I don't know,
man.
I,
I like email.
It's too much.</v>

1805
01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:33.720
It is too much though.
After a while it gets crazy.
You,
uh,
so much shit.
Too much.

1806
01:45:34.290 --> 01:45:38.670
I don't know.
Yeah,
no,
I know what you're talking about ma'am.
Um,
it's,

1807
01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:44.100
it's just overwhelming how much shit you can get thrown at you that you have to

1808
01:45:44.101 --> 01:45:44.910
pay attention to them.

1809
01:45:44.910 --> 01:45:48.660
That was one of the best things about going camping is that for five days,

1810
01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:52.240
no phone calls,
no emails,
no nothing.
You know?
Yeah.

1811
01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:56.070
It's one of the nicest things that have like a little break,
a little reset.

1812
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:58.710
Like I actually looked forward to getting emails after that.

1813
01:45:58.950 --> 01:46:00.360
<v 5>My new favorite thing on the phone,</v>

1814
01:46:00.361 --> 01:46:04.530
I don't know if you've used this on the iPhone,
is the a do not disturb a,

1815
01:46:04.590 --> 01:46:09.480
so at night you just click on this do not disturb button.
No phone calls,

1816
01:46:09.481 --> 01:46:13.170
no texts,
but you still have like Internet,
you know,
and shit like that.

1817
01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:17.250
But it's just because that would be getting phone calls like,
Oh set my uh,

1818
01:46:17.340 --> 01:46:20.610
alarm to wake me up and they don't get a phone call at like two in the morning,

1819
01:46:20.611 --> 01:46:21.920
you know?
And I'm like,
Oh,
what the fuck?

1820
01:46:21.921 --> 01:46:24.920
And it will wake me up or somebody will send me a stupid text,
you know,

1821
01:46:24.930 --> 01:46:25.890
at six in the morning.

1822
01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:30.070
<v 4>So that's what do not disturb us.
Yeah.
Just turns everything off.
But it's,</v>

1823
01:46:30.190 --> 01:46:34.510
everything's still comes in so it's not like you have it on airplane mode.
Right.

1824
01:46:34.511 --> 01:46:37.290
Because it doesn't ever visit any warnings.
It doesn't,
yeah.

1825
01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:40.650
Just turns all that shit off.
Does it still light up?

1826
01:46:41.130 --> 01:46:42.630
Like does it get brighter?

1827
01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:44.760
<v 5>Um,
I think it just,
it depends on,</v>

1828
01:46:44.761 --> 01:46:48.180
you'd see I have all text messages turned off all notifications,

1829
01:46:48.181 --> 01:46:50.490
turned off on my phone,
everything turned off on my phone.
Now,

1830
01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:54.460
I don't even like a window popping up cause I was just getting like,
you know,

1831
01:46:54.510 --> 01:46:56.640
too in too much trouble when I was a dating,

1832
01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:00.880
you know like there'll be like a text that pop up like,
Hey,

1833
01:47:00.881 --> 01:47:04.260
what are you doing tonight honey in and then right,
oh who,
who is this right?

1834
01:47:04.810 --> 01:47:07.750
Is this getting me in too much trouble?
So do not disturb is a way out of that.

1835
01:47:07.751 --> 01:47:09.880
Yeah.
Well I just turned off all notifications.

1836
01:47:09.881 --> 01:47:13.870
So like if I get a check your fucking phone off,
I know I'm about to or are you,

1837
01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:17.260
are you getting that way at all?
Like I'm,
I'm starting to like,
I don't want,

1838
01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:19.480
like I'm turning into Joey d is like,
I'm going backwards.

1839
01:47:19.490 --> 01:47:20.830
I want to get just a pager.

1840
01:47:21.460 --> 01:47:24.820
<v 1>Well just something to be said for not,
you know,</v>

1841
01:47:24.821 --> 01:47:27.790
when you're constantly interacting with people all day long,

1842
01:47:27.791 --> 01:47:31.260
you have no time to reflect.
Really trying to think for yourself.
Right?

1843
01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:34.840
You just constantly dealing with other people's requests for,
you know,
hey,

1844
01:47:34.841 --> 01:47:37.120
I've got a question.
Hey,
what's up?
Hey,
what's going on?
What are you doing?

1845
01:47:37.121 --> 01:47:40.390
Do you want to do this?
You want to do that?
What's the plan?
And constantly,

1846
01:47:40.391 --> 01:47:45.280
can you call me?
I got this going on and after a while it's like you,
you,

1847
01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:48.880
if you're in the loop of communicating with a bunch of different people all the

1848
01:47:48.881 --> 01:47:52.030
time,
you're constantly responding to things.
Yes.
Text messages.

1849
01:47:52.031 --> 01:47:55.300
Like sometimes I'll get in this like text message thing where like three dudes

1850
01:47:55.301 --> 01:47:56.500
are texting me at the same time.

1851
01:47:56.770 --> 01:48:00.040
And so like you're texting them trying to answer questions or talk to him about

1852
01:48:00.041 --> 01:48:01.090
shit and it's like,

1853
01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:03.390
and then another one comes in from the other guy and then you hit that and like

1854
01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:07.390
how many times do you banter back and forth too?
And it's with school.

1855
01:48:07.450 --> 01:48:08.410
Girls are brutal.

1856
01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:09.820
<v 5>Yeah.
If you got in a fight with a girl</v>

1857
01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:13.730
<v 13>over a text message and writing paragraph after paragraph</v>

1858
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:16.650
<v 5>and you have to like respond to it,</v>

1859
01:48:16.651 --> 01:48:20.520
you have to like go back and read and write and then when you're done she has

1860
01:48:20.521 --> 01:48:22.440
another paragraph we loaded and ready.
Yeah.

1861
01:48:22.510 --> 01:48:24.490
<v 1>At least you could do is email me your crazy fish.</v>

1862
01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:28.690
Writing in a text form is rude and you know,
and by the way,

1863
01:48:28.691 --> 01:48:31.930
that's what you're doing for the next few hours.
Good luck with that.
Yeah.

1864
01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:34.780
You know,
instead of having a phone call or a meeting person,

1865
01:48:34.781 --> 01:48:39.780
the person talking this shit out.
Oh my God.
You said being with me.
Huh?

1866
01:48:40.900 --> 01:48:43.120
Drama for your Mama.
Yeah.

1867
01:48:43.210 --> 01:48:46.360
There's gotta be a way out of this prime gotta be a way to positive beliefs,

1868
01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:51.730
beliefs.
Well the website shows a lot of white people holding hands.

1869
01:48:51.790 --> 01:48:53.110
Perfect.
That's what I want to do.

1870
01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:57.370
I want to hold hands with white people and walk on the beach and no one I have

1871
01:48:57.371 --> 01:49:01.420
no shoes on and be relaxed enough to be staring at the water through my toes

1872
01:49:01.450 --> 01:49:04.720
with my 17 year old Hadi.
Yeah.
While I'm bath salts,

1873
01:49:05.290 --> 01:49:09.350
allegedly according to Gizmodo,
I,

1874
01:49:09.790 --> 01:49:13.420
I feel like I trust John McAfee.
How about that?

1875
01:49:13.690 --> 01:49:16.780
Had a conversation with him.
He was a hell of a nice guy.

1876
01:49:16.781 --> 01:49:21.490
I detected no hint of bath salts in our conversation.
Yeah.
Shit felt legit.

1877
01:49:22.330 --> 01:49:23.680
I felt like he was really there with me.

1878
01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:29.250
And you know why he's got a good point about those cops making a dollar an hour.

1879
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:32.940
Maybe if someone paid him $20 now they wouldn't have shot that guy 14 times in a

1880
01:49:32.941 --> 01:49:35.580
van.
He's just fucking pay all the cops.
It's just,

1881
01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:38.160
well I think he tried to do that.

1882
01:49:38.161 --> 01:49:42.090
I think he had his own sort of an army and I think he had,
uh,
and that's,

1883
01:49:42.210 --> 01:49:42.750
you know,

1884
01:49:42.750 --> 01:49:46.590
one of the things they tried to stop compounds and governments before they
start.

1885
01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:51.850
So when you start seeing a dude accumulate dogs and guns and you want to move
in,

1886
01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:56.560
send a fucking sniff troop into the math lab,

1887
01:49:57.470 --> 01:50:00.660
see what's being cooked up,
their legal or illegal.
All right.

1888
01:50:01.150 --> 01:50:04.990
But this MDPV stuff,
not legal in America anymore,

1889
01:50:05.420 --> 01:50:06.610
but Leah Lind believes,

1890
01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.580
although it doesn't matter because that's not what he was doing,
right?
No,

1891
01:50:10.570 --> 01:50:15.430
he's researching.
Yeah.
So this,
um,
they have a picture of this,
this plane thing.

1892
01:50:16.510 --> 01:50:20.730
It's pretty crazy.
It really does look like a,
um,
like a,

1893
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:23.950
like a motorcycle with a kite on the top of it.

1894
01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:30.680
And his nephew a dive in this thing with a 61 year old passenger.

1895
01:50:31.590 --> 01:50:32.423
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

1896
01:50:32.740 --> 01:50:36.470
<v 1>They had been flying in clean,
smooth air with plenty of altitude.</v>

1897
01:50:36.500 --> 01:50:40.910
Mcafee told me when suddenly they went into a spiral dive and crash into the

1898
01:50:40.911 --> 01:50:41.510
ground.

1899
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:44.390
The terrain was so rugged that the sheriff's deputies took a helicopter to the

1900
01:50:44.391 --> 01:50:48.350
top of the ridge and hiked down to retrieve the bodies leaving the records where

1901
01:50:48.351 --> 01:50:49.184
it lay.

1902
01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:51.373
<v 2>Wow.</v>

1903
01:50:53.590 --> 01:50:55.060
<v 1>Sounds like it's dangerous as fuck,</v>

1904
01:50:55.061 --> 01:50:57.520
but it's dangerous as fuck to do a lot of shit.

1905
01:50:57.521 --> 01:51:00.820
Skydiving's dangerous as fuck those bodysuits.

1906
01:51:00.970 --> 01:51:04.660
Have you ever seen that video where the guy's on a,
that wingsuit and he crashes?

1907
01:51:05.050 --> 01:51:08.640
Yeah.
Ooh,
that looks horrifying.
It's wings in,
it's,

1908
01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:12.010
that guy was fine with that guy is fucked up too.
I mean,

1909
01:51:12.011 --> 01:51:16.060
I think he broke like every bone in his body.
He lived.
But you're,
you're,

1910
01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:18.760
you're flying.
You know like,
who knows?

1911
01:51:18.761 --> 01:51:22.000
Like it's like a hundred miles an hour or sometimes it's pretty crazy how fast

1912
01:51:22.001 --> 01:51:25.870
those things go.
And you clip the ground and you just go from Matt Tumble.

1913
01:51:26.770 --> 01:51:29.230
But that's legal.
Can't see anything.
Anybody for that.

1914
01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:32.860
Can't sue anybody for hand gliding,
I don't think.

1915
01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:36.730
Unless you rent a fucking hang glide and it snaps in half,

1916
01:51:36.731 --> 01:51:40.210
then maybe your family can sue the rental company for not maintaining it.

1917
01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:44.430
But if you die in a hang gliding accident because of some crazy wind,
you know,

1918
01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:45.273
situation,

1919
01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:49.610
<v 3>you're lucky you're not addicted to video games anymore because I got something</v>

1920
01:51:49.611 --> 01:51:53.420
that you would,
you'd go crazy on what?
It's a suitcase.

1921
01:51:53.450 --> 01:51:56.540
And when you open it up and it's travel approved,
when you open it up,

1922
01:51:56.570 --> 01:52:00.230
there's a 19 inch monitor,
a sound system.
There's lights,

1923
01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:05.440
you put your x box and there your ps three and the star wars Xbox.

1924
01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:10.670
But any it just try,
you travel with it.
The sound is loud.
It's,

1925
01:52:10.671 --> 01:52:12.800
it's got light like blue lights all around it.

1926
01:52:12.801 --> 01:52:17.480
So at night it's glows and it's 10 80 P it's a games,

1927
01:52:17.630 --> 01:52:22.580
uh,
Feliks incredible.
What is it called?
It's a games a all in one.

1928
01:52:22.581 --> 01:52:26.450
I have a youtube video of it.
See the problem with all that

1929
01:52:26.510 --> 01:52:30.260
<v 1>shit is that if you're going to play a fucking game,</v>

1930
01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:32.690
he should have the most accurate input devices.

1931
01:52:32.960 --> 01:52:34.580
And when you're playing games and you have

1932
01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:37.850
<v 3>works for the games that you're used to playing.
Yeah,
but,</v>

1933
01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:40.640
but see these games are designed not for mouse and keyboard.

1934
01:52:40.641 --> 01:52:44.540
They're designed for the controller,
but you don't get as much accuracy.

1935
01:52:44.930 --> 01:52:47.750
Why would you not want a mouse and a keyboard once you play with a mouse and a

1936
01:52:47.751 --> 01:52:50.930
keyboard.
Oh,
you have it there.
Is that it?
Yeah.
This is it right here.

1937
01:52:50.931 --> 01:52:52.760
They send you one of these things?
No,
I bought it.

1938
01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:57.530
I bought it for the studio because we do so many video game podcast at death

1939
01:52:57.531 --> 01:52:58.364
squad that I was like,

1940
01:52:58.470 --> 01:53:01.670
we should have a unit here so we can play video games and show people you have

1941
01:53:01.671 --> 01:53:04.160
it here right now.
No,
I didn't bring it today.
What the fuck?

1942
01:53:04.590 --> 01:53:09.320
It was a video of you playing with it.
So,
um,
how many games did you play on this?

1943
01:53:09.590 --> 01:53:12.440
I've only been playing call of duty and I haven't even been doing playing much

1944
01:53:12.441 --> 01:53:16.370
because I've been busy.
And how's it look?
It's awesome.
It looks great.
It's great.

1945
01:53:16.371 --> 01:53:19.910
It's got two headphone jacks in the front of it.
So you can,
you know,

1946
01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:24.740
play online and you know,
have your own headphones plugged in and uh,
it's,

1947
01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:28.280
it's great that it has an htmi port in it.
So like if you wanted to,

1948
01:53:28.281 --> 01:53:32.990
you can also hook like a ps three or a Nintendo wi or whatever.
Uh,

1949
01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:37.330
you could hook it up to a television.
Yeah.
And they have a 15 inch version,
uh,

1950
01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:38.930
that they sell,
like at best buy and stuff.

1951
01:53:38.931 --> 01:53:42.380
This is the third new 19 inch Halos special edition version is the first time

1952
01:53:42.381 --> 01:53:46.060
they have 19 inch monitor in it,
stuff like that.
But I have a video showing it.

1953
01:53:46.110 --> 01:53:47.820
If you go to youtube.com backslash,

1954
01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:52.870
let's find Jesus and let's find Jesus is just all my tech review shit.

1955
01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:57.110
Do you know I'll do the team phone surveys.

1956
01:53:57.260 --> 01:54:01.040
Does anybody ever get pissed at your youtube name?
Let's find Jesus.
No,

1957
01:54:01.041 --> 01:54:04.250
but I think there were more pissed at,
let's find jesus.com.
Why?

1958
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:10.390
Because it was a website that's a website that sells a religious things that I

1959
01:54:12.201 --> 01:54:15.920
made a long time ago when me and McAfee's to troll people.

1960
01:54:16.700 --> 01:54:20.240
Let's find jesus.com does it sell things?
Yeah.

1961
01:54:21.550 --> 01:54:26.110
Like Jesus his hair.
Yeah.
Jesus's hair from the barber shop.
This is black.
Jesus.

1962
01:54:26.450 --> 01:54:30.070
Uh,
Jesus stealing a baby drawing that it's a,

1963
01:54:30.310 --> 01:54:33.940
it's a painting of Jesus is stealing a baby.
No,

1964
01:54:34.420 --> 01:54:38.060
I've never sold one actually,
but it's been on.
Oh,
they actually for sale though.

1965
01:54:38.310 --> 01:54:41.240
I it somebody bought it.
Oh No,
they're not for sale.
No.

1966
01:54:41.770 --> 01:54:46.090
Fuck you don't say that as the mix CD.
Jesus has mixed CD.

1967
01:54:46.430 --> 01:54:50.360
A bunch of songs that I wrote about

1968
01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:56.630
time ago about Jesus and Mary and Noah.
Is this?

1969
01:54:57.710 --> 01:54:58.543
<v 2>No.</v>

1970
01:55:05.110 --> 01:55:09.820
<v 3>Oh,
this is uh,
this is,
uh,
don't forget to bring the love birds on the boat.</v>

1971
01:55:09.821 --> 01:55:10.700
Noah for Mary.

1972
01:55:15.070 --> 01:55:16.230
<v 2>Oh,</v>

1973
01:55:30.110 --> 01:55:32.090
<v 3>and there's a lot,
like there's a remix,</v>

1974
01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:35.720
there's tons of real next version or other songs or is that same song?

1975
01:55:36.220 --> 01:55:40.310
It's remix versions of that same theme.
Yeah.

1976
01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:48.433
<v 14>Birds,</v>

1977
01:55:49.990 --> 01:55:51.520
<v 4>it says to,
you know,
by the way,</v>

1978
01:55:51.521 --> 01:55:56.521
that's not any more ridiculous than any of the songs I hear on one of those

1979
01:55:56.681 --> 01:56:01.600
serious XF Xm,
like the coffee house.
Oh,
right,
right.
No,

1980
01:56:01.601 --> 01:56:03.760
half of those fucking really emo songs.

1981
01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:06.530
<v 5>Check this out.
This is a,
another thing I just reviewed a,</v>

1982
01:56:06.531 --> 01:56:11.230
this is a biologic tech,
uh,
Wifi,
um,
webcam.

1983
01:56:11.290 --> 01:56:15.130
And what it does is it connects to your wifi network and then you have a

1984
01:56:15.131 --> 01:56:19.510
wireless Webcam and it has a button on it that you push that automatically

1985
01:56:19.511 --> 01:56:23.920
starts streaming the use stream.
So you stream has partnered with these guys,

1986
01:56:23.921 --> 01:56:27.420
I guess if somehow,
but it's,
it's like this is,
it has a,
uh,

1987
01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:31.000
a tripod with a magnet on it so you can rotate it all around,
which is,

1988
01:56:31.060 --> 01:56:34.060
it's also a case,
but it's just a wireless web cam.

1989
01:56:34.061 --> 01:56:37.660
So if you're on the same wifi network,
if you're on a wifi network,

1990
01:56:37.661 --> 01:56:40.840
you can carry this whole thing around your whole house and you have a wireless,

1991
01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:44.670
a Webcam,
and it's got like a three hour battery life.
Does it have an a?

1992
01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:48.540
I'm a microphone.
It's got a microphone.
It's got a light on the front of it.
It's,

1993
01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:52.600
it's,
it's carrying case,
which I'm showing right now.
Uh,
it,

1994
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:57.340
you take it out and it makes,
it's a doubles as a tripod and uh,

1995
01:56:57.490 --> 01:57:01.840
it also has a magnet on it.
So the magnet is for the tilting and stuff like that.

1996
01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:06.130
You could also has a hook so you can screw it onto a tripod and it's got really

1997
01:57:06.131 --> 01:57:10.250
good quality.
It's a HD Webcam.
That's amazing.
What is it called?
Uh,

1998
01:57:10.270 --> 01:57:14.470
it's the Logitech,
a broadcast or Wifi and it's,
you know,

1999
01:57:14.471 --> 01:57:17.140
it's Super Mac friendly.
It's actually designed more for Mac.

2000
01:57:17.141 --> 01:57:21.700
Almost a piece socket windows.
Yeah.
And so I have a video.

2001
01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:24.190
So on the,
let's find Jesus Youtube Channel.
Dude,

2002
01:57:24.191 --> 01:57:27.250
that sounds like something we need to get ahold of.
I have one right there.

2003
01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:31.450
We need to use that shit.
Well I think for what we do it wouldn't really benefit.

2004
01:57:31.451 --> 01:57:33.640
I know now I'm still playing with it cause we already have,

2005
01:57:33.641 --> 01:57:37.720
we have video cameras and mixers here,
so yeah,
but not here.
I mean like at shows.

2006
01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:41.500
Oh yeah.
For shows if we can get on the wifi network or bring a hot spot maybe.

2007
01:57:41.501 --> 01:57:42.170
Yeah,

2008
01:57:42.170 --> 01:57:44.820
<v 4>yeah.
We should start doing that.
Maybe we should do that this weekend in Austin.</v>

2009
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:47.880
They,
we should broadcast and Oscar from the green room before the show.

2010
01:57:48.150 --> 01:57:52.070
It's going to you,
me and Dunkin and a Aubrey from ana.com.
Yeah.

2011
01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:56.550
Oh snap.
We're going to have a good time.
Yes.
Oh,

2012
01:57:56.551 --> 01:58:00.720
snappy dirty bitches.
I forgot that.
We're in Austin this weekend,
man.

2013
01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:04.960
Saturday night.
Well I forgot Aubrey was,
he lived there.
Yeah.
That's cool.
Yeah,

2014
01:58:04.980 --> 01:58:06.670
we're going to have a good fucking time.
Yeah.

2015
01:58:06.930 --> 01:58:10.410
And then we got to go to this barbecue place that everybody waits in line all

2016
01:58:10.410 --> 01:58:12.330
day for supposed to be ridiculous.

2017
01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:15.750
Abi said they would hire someone to go wait in line.

2018
01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:17.940
But the problem with that is,
and you don't get it fresh,

2019
01:58:18.420 --> 01:58:22.470
you want to get it like right as it comes off the grill.

2020
01:58:23.010 --> 01:58:25.410
The only way to do that as you have to wait in line for like an hour and a half.

2021
01:58:25.710 --> 01:58:27.810
Oh fuck that.
No,
I don't want that crazy way.

2022
01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:30.840
Let's go eat her own this and make our own.
No,
you don't know what you're doing.

2023
01:58:31.050 --> 01:58:31.820
I don't care.

2024
01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:34.340
Your barbecue and still waiting an hour and a half are from barbecue.

2025
01:58:34.341 --> 01:58:35.370
It's supposed to be unbelievable.

2026
01:58:35.371 --> 01:58:38.040
Ari Shaffir said it was so good after you waited in line,
an hour and a half,

2027
01:58:38.041 --> 01:58:38.270
it was

2028
01:58:38.270 --> 01:58:40.490
<v 5>worth it.
Anything is good.
If you wait in line for an hour and a half.</v>

2029
01:58:40.491 --> 01:58:43.060
That's why anytime you,
oh,
your wife cooks for you,

2030
01:58:43.061 --> 01:58:45.820
it's always good because you had to sit there and wait two hours instead of two

2031
01:58:45.821 --> 01:58:48.490
minutes for putting a lien pocket in the microwave.
You were like,
all right,

2032
01:58:48.491 --> 01:58:51.460
I just had to sit here and smell the whole cooking process of the food.

2033
01:58:51.461 --> 01:58:52.930
Of course I'm going to love your food.

2034
01:58:53.260 --> 01:58:57.930
I don't know what I'm talking about about yeah,
definitely.
Of course.

2035
01:58:58.300 --> 01:58:59.133
Poor fool.

2036
01:58:59.470 --> 01:59:03.250
<v 1>Uh,
so,
uh,
we'll see you guys tomorrow.
We have nothing else to say to each other.</v>

2037
01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:04.940
We will be doing a,
a,

2038
01:59:04.970 --> 01:59:09.970
a just Brian and Joe only podcasts though to celebrate our 300th podcast.

2039
01:59:11.410 --> 01:59:13.810
I think we've done that with every 100,
right?
Everyone.
Oh No.

2040
01:59:13.811 --> 01:59:17.590
We tried to do one with dunk and then we did one with Duncan last time.
Yeah.
Um,

2041
01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:22.780
but the um,
the 100th and now the 300th,
it's kind of crazy.

2042
01:59:22.781 --> 01:59:26.190
This is our third year doing this,
this month.
Next month.
Uh,

2043
01:59:26.260 --> 01:59:29.950
Mark's our third year of doing this podcast.
Yeah,
it's crazy.
Ridiculous.

2044
01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:34.960
[inaudible] how the fuck that happened?
Time just flew up.

2045
01:59:35.060 --> 01:59:39.550
Remember when you were like back in the day.
We would make fun of December 21st,

2046
01:59:39.550 --> 01:59:42.430
2012 dudes can be the underworld.
Cause it didn't seem like it was real.

2047
01:59:42.670 --> 01:59:46.030
It didn't seem like that date was ever going to come.
That shits this month,
son.

2048
01:59:46.660 --> 01:59:50.740
It's almost December 1st,
December 1st on Saturday,
20 days later.

2049
01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:55.360
End of the Mayan calendar.
Are you ready?
You ain't shit.
You ain't ready.

2050
01:59:56.200 --> 01:59:59.860
You're not ready for doomsday.
You Ain't a prepper.
Did you watch prepping?

2051
01:59:59.930 --> 02:00:03.460
You ever watch that day prepping?
No.
It's a good shot of watch.

2052
02:00:03.780 --> 02:00:04.571
It's one of my new things.

2053
02:00:04.571 --> 02:00:08.140
I watched these nutty bitches canning peaches and fucking stuffing them under

2054
02:00:08.141 --> 02:00:12.550
their bed.
One Guy,
he shot his thumb.
He had a fucking his,

2055
02:00:12.551 --> 02:00:16.780
his gun misfired and it's to stumps.
Started bleeding and he fainted.

2056
02:00:17.650 --> 02:00:19.450
Mike,
you fucking pussy.

2057
02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:24.550
You think you're going to last through the fucking apocalypse and you can't even

2058
02:00:24.551 --> 02:00:29.110
deal with a little blood loss.
You faint like a bitch,
cause your thumbs bleeding.

2059
02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:33.850
How dare you,
how dare you be on Doomsday preppers with that bitch ass attitude.

2060
02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:37.420
There was one couple that was really religious and they were buying a lot of

2061
02:00:37.421 --> 02:00:39.790
alcohol and like,
we don't even drink alcohol,

2062
02:00:39.791 --> 02:00:41.380
but we're going to need it for bartering.

2063
02:00:41.620 --> 02:00:45.910
And also would construct Molotov cocktails and case were attacked.

2064
02:00:46.180 --> 02:00:49.460
And so then they were practicing with the Molotov cocktails.
Like they uh,

2065
02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:53.350
had like this,
uh,
these rocks and they would,
uh,
light the fucking,

2066
02:00:53.740 --> 02:00:55.660
the thing you know when a Molotov cocktail is folks,

2067
02:00:55.661 --> 02:01:00.661
it's the take a thing of high proof alcohol and you stuff like a rag in it and

2068
02:01:01.210 --> 02:01:05.260
get it all wet with the alcohol and then you light the rag and throw it and

2069
02:01:05.261 --> 02:01:07.810
explodes and flames.
So he's fucking dumb.

2070
02:01:07.811 --> 02:01:12.090
He's just standing there throwing glasses of vodka at the rocks and burst them

2071
02:01:12.091 --> 02:01:15.850
into flame view.
This is a good weapon.
Meanwhile,
they have fucking guns.

2072
02:01:15.970 --> 02:01:18.850
They have like huge caches of guns,

2073
02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:21.160
huge safes filled with machine guns.

2074
02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:25.420
They have like ankle holsters on and they'll lose was right next to my dick or

2075
02:01:25.421 --> 02:01:28.170
keep it going next to my deck on next to my ankle.
Like they,

2076
02:01:28.171 --> 02:01:32.950
they're like completely prepped and every month they go to the supermarket and

2077
02:01:32.951 --> 02:01:37.150
they go to like Costco's and places like that and stock up on supplies so that

2078
02:01:37.151 --> 02:01:40.460
can be better prepared.
Like they have a budget of every month

2079
02:01:40.490 --> 02:01:45.380
<v 4>where they'll buy like guns and bullets and water and fucking bananas.
Man.</v>

2080
02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:50.570
Bananas to watch when the apocalypse comes.
You've got to really,

2081
02:01:51.550 --> 02:01:54.260
you've got to really wonder whether or not you want to make it through.

2082
02:01:56.750 --> 02:02:01.750
Someone had to do that in the past because everything was the apocalypse when we

2083
02:02:01.941 --> 02:02:05.930
were monkeys.
Okay.
Every day was the apocalypse.
You know,

2084
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:09.440
you had to fucking go out and scrounge for food.
There was no supermarkets,

2085
02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:12.920
there's no internet,
there's no electricity.
It's essentially mad.

2086
02:02:12.921 --> 02:02:17.840
Max was way better than the way the monkeys lived.
Least Mad Max had a car.

2087
02:02:18.110 --> 02:02:21.110
Okay.
The apocalypse,
you know,

2088
02:02:21.111 --> 02:02:23.660
being like that road warrior type scenario,

2089
02:02:23.690 --> 02:02:26.000
that ain't shit compared to what it definitely used to be.

2090
02:02:26.210 --> 02:02:29.360
And somebody had to get through that to get to here.

2091
02:02:29.810 --> 02:02:31.580
They had to get through that to get to here.

2092
02:02:32.420 --> 02:02:34.490
But the problem is once you're already here,

2093
02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:38.240
fairly tough to go back to caveman days.

2094
02:02:38.990 --> 02:02:41.150
Very tough to scrounge out of living,

2095
02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:45.260
eating dead people that you find under a fucking overpass cause that's the only

2096
02:02:45.261 --> 02:02:49.350
meat he can bring home to your family.
Jesus Christ.
You got to,

2097
02:02:49.351 --> 02:02:51.650
you got to wonder whether or not you want to make it through that.

2098
02:02:51.651 --> 02:02:54.350
Like what's the end game and that sort of scenario.

2099
02:02:54.920 --> 02:02:59.540
If an asteroid hits you really want it to hit you like it just land right on.

2100
02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:03.080
Yen's fucking let's try this again.
Right?

2101
02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:05.510
What are you doing over there?
Surfing the web.

2102
02:03:05.630 --> 02:03:10.160
<v 5>No,
I'm looking,
I just reading that pour or a pour.</v>

2103
02:03:10.190 --> 02:03:12.350
The porn industry is uh,

2104
02:03:13.390 --> 02:03:18.110
suing Verizon for protecting pirates and I was just like,
wow.

2105
02:03:18.111 --> 02:03:20.990
Verizon standing up for the pirates.
That's crazy.

2106
02:03:21.270 --> 02:03:23.750
<v 4>Huh?
The porn industry is a PR.</v>

2107
02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:27.180
What are they saying that people are stealing them like on bit torrent and stuff

2108
02:03:27.181 --> 02:03:28.380
like that.
Stealing their videos.

2109
02:03:28.490 --> 02:03:32.120
<v 5>They're saying that Verizon has refusing to comply with court ordered subpoenas</v>

2110
02:03:32.180 --> 02:03:36.200
and the porn studio c it is more than a,
you were there just the,

2111
02:03:36.530 --> 02:03:40.520
they just want the names of people that are torrenting as shit and for I guess

2112
02:03:40.521 --> 02:03:41.630
for reasons not playing along.

2113
02:03:41.670 --> 02:03:45.050
<v 4>That's funny because they play on along with the record industry.
Right.
Uh,</v>

2114
02:03:45.270 --> 02:03:47.910
does Verizon play along with them?
I don't know.
I mean some people don't,

2115
02:03:47.911 --> 02:03:51.420
some people send out messages but they won't.
Um,
they won't actively see.

2116
02:03:51.421 --> 02:03:54.600
I don't just don't listen to hot.
Not a lot for them.
You know,

2117
02:03:54.601 --> 02:03:59.010
the Internet companies and going after people that are pirates,
it's almost like,

2118
02:03:59.011 --> 02:04:01.590
yeah,
you gotta you gotta figure that shit out on your own.

2119
02:04:02.060 --> 02:04:04.380
Cause they're in the business of providing Internet service.

2120
02:04:04.381 --> 02:04:06.540
And one of the things that people want to do with that insurance services

2121
02:04:06.570 --> 02:04:08.190
download shit,
you know,

2122
02:04:08.191 --> 02:04:10.740
for you to like start peering into what they're downloading.

2123
02:04:10.741 --> 02:04:15.280
And you know that a mega upload scenario,
you know what's going on with that,

2124
02:04:15.281 --> 02:04:18.540
that that Guy kim.com who said,
uh,

2125
02:04:18.660 --> 02:04:21.090
he was like famous in the early days of the Internet.

2126
02:04:21.091 --> 02:04:25.830
It used to be a hacker and a then became a computer security is expert and

2127
02:04:25.831 --> 02:04:30.390
apparently made a fuck load of money and he takes all these,

2128
02:04:30.391 --> 02:04:33.540
used to have this blog and he takes all these crazy pictures of him in front of

2129
02:04:33.541 --> 02:04:38.070
his yacht and you know,
chilling in Brazil and flying in private jet to this

2130
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:41.040
<v 1>place and he's got this ridiculous mansion house where he lives in,</v>

2131
02:04:41.041 --> 02:04:45.500
in New Zealand and he's embroiled in this huge,
uh,

2132
02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:49.560
legal battle because of mega upload.com which was his,

2133
02:04:49.561 --> 02:04:54.360
a website that was accused of,
uh,
hosting pirated material.

2134
02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:59.270
And apparently the,
the,
the government,
like they,

2135
02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:00.970
they like according to Kim Dotcom,

2136
02:05:00.990 --> 02:05:04.920
like he complied with every request the government have for taking things down

2137
02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:09.480
and that they actually asked him to not take these certain files down.

2138
02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:13.560
And those are the ones that they wind up charging him for.
Cause they were,

2139
02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:13.980
you know,

2140
02:05:13.980 --> 02:05:16.530
they want asked him to not do it because they were trying to track it or

2141
02:05:16.531 --> 02:05:19.620
something like that.
So He's saying that they acted in bad faith in,

2142
02:05:19.621 --> 02:05:24.270
in organizing their,
their evidence against him is,
I,
as I understand it,

2143
02:05:24.271 --> 02:05:25.860
I might have fucked that,
that argument up,

2144
02:05:25.980 --> 02:05:28.230
but it's kind of interesting that this,
uh,

2145
02:05:28.231 --> 02:05:33.231
this guy is like the super rich geek who is trying to keep file sharing alive

2146
02:05:35.100 --> 02:05:40.100
and keep these upload sites alive and now he's a making one where everyone else

2147
02:05:40.591 --> 02:05:44.760
can contribute,
download that you can contribute bandwidth and storage.

2148
02:05:45.150 --> 02:05:46.980
So somehow or another end,

2149
02:05:46.981 --> 02:05:51.981
they're offering a one click encryption on the fly for free for all data.

2150
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:54.691
So it's a,

2151
02:05:54.691 --> 02:05:59.100
it's really going to be interesting to see where this goes because if this guy

2152
02:05:59.101 --> 02:06:03.810
can figure out how,
how to do that,
um,
you know,

2153
02:06:03.820 --> 02:06:06.690
what,
what,
what,
what can these,
uh,

2154
02:06:06.750 --> 02:06:10.800
record industry people and what can these movie industry people do about that?

2155
02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:14.250
Because what he's saying is that there's,
um,

2156
02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:19.280
there's data on his site that shows that when mega upload was,

2157
02:06:20.430 --> 02:06:24.060
was a shutdown,
that it actually hurt box office numbers.

2158
02:06:24.600 --> 02:06:28.640
That it doesn't hurt movie like huge blockbuster movies like,
you know,

2159
02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:31.350
mission impossible type shit.
It doesn't hurt them,

2160
02:06:31.530 --> 02:06:36.110
but it hurts the box offices of more obscure movies who would be heard about and

2161
02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:38.460
transferred and uh,
and,

2162
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:41.970
and talked about through the Internet and that people would hear about it

2163
02:06:41.971 --> 02:06:43.290
because of other people downloading them.

2164
02:06:43.290 --> 02:06:46.590
And that would actually cause more people to go out and buy it and see it,

2165
02:06:47.820 --> 02:06:49.520
which is,
you know,
sort of the,

2166
02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:55.080
that's the attitude that most comics take is that having anything of yours

2167
02:06:55.801 --> 02:06:58.710
that's out on the Internet,
it's the,
the more that's out there,

2168
02:06:58.711 --> 02:07:03.420
the better because then people will hear about you and there'll be able to uh,

2169
02:07:03.630 --> 02:07:04.710
go out and get your stuff.

2170
02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:09.330
That's why very few comics remove like mp3s for copyright violation.

2171
02:07:09.331 --> 02:07:12.450
It's like they're happy if anybody's listening because then more people listen

2172
02:07:12.451 --> 02:07:16.350
to the your future shit.
Yeah.
It's an interesting argument,
you know,

2173
02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:19.650
as far as what's copywritten and what's not and what hurts and what doesn't.

2174
02:07:21.150 --> 02:07:23.370
When someone's got a fucking movie theater in their house though,

2175
02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:25.290
that's when shit hurts.
Like you have a,

2176
02:07:25.291 --> 02:07:27.070
you have essentially have a movie theater in your house.

2177
02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:29.580
<v 5>Yeah.
My New Shit is a movie theater in my house.</v>

2178
02:07:29.581 --> 02:07:34.581
I've been watching so much shit on that thing and like I could see it being like

2179
02:07:35.201 --> 02:07:38.020
I saw a wreck it Ralph the other day and I went to one of those movie theaters

2180
02:07:38.170 --> 02:07:41.470
where like it was in a small room where the,
the,

2181
02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:43.800
the screen was about the same size as that.

2182
02:07:43.801 --> 02:07:47.320
The screen that now I have in my house,
I just take,

2183
02:07:47.321 --> 02:07:51.160
took one wall of my living room and pretty much made it a movie theater screen.

2184
02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:53.950
And the projectors are so good nowadays that,

2185
02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:58.240
that they're HD that it,
it's like you don't need,

2186
02:07:58.750 --> 02:08:01.870
uh,
this,
this projector screen was $200.

2187
02:08:01.871 --> 02:08:04.690
The projector with $700 and that right there is better.

2188
02:08:04.930 --> 02:08:07.240
I don't have any reason to go to a movie theater now.

2189
02:08:07.690 --> 02:08:12.530
<v 4>Yeah,
if you could just get the movies directly.
What,
why can't they do that?</v>

2190
02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:16.820
Why can't they just charge?
Like how about I iTunes,
you know,

2191
02:08:16.821 --> 02:08:20.020
do it through them.
Think about this.
Like if you go to the movies,

2192
02:08:20.030 --> 02:08:22.910
like how much does it cost to go to the movies?
It's like 10 bucks an hour.

2193
02:08:22.911 --> 02:08:26.750
So that's like 13 bucks there.
10 Bucks.
Where are you gonna charge me?
50.
Yeah,

2194
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:29.520
they charged me 50,
so I can watch it with the whole family.
Right.

2195
02:08:29.570 --> 02:08:30.590
Charge me 50 bucks.

2196
02:08:30.860 --> 02:08:34.810
<v 5>Well they,
they do that kind of like,
like,
uh,
uh,
bobcat's movies and,</v>

2197
02:08:34.811 --> 02:08:38.800
and Kevin Smith's movie,
right state.
You,
you could,
you could,
uh,

2198
02:08:38.830 --> 02:08:41.200
get the odd before it even came out in movie theaters.

2199
02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:44.140
<v 4>Yeah.
Well,
Kevin Smith,
it was beautiful.
Yeah.
That was the right way to do it.</v>

2200
02:08:44.290 --> 02:08:49.270
That's very smart.
You know,
he's a aware of his sort of,
uh,
his community.

2201
02:08:49.630 --> 02:08:52.860
You know,
he can,
he can do something like that.
I hope he made money off that.
Oh,

2202
02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:56.290
of course he did.
It's good fucking movie.
Yeah,
it's a good fucking movie.

2203
02:08:56.291 --> 02:08:57.910
That movie was really well done.

2204
02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:02.920
And a Stephen King or a Steve route rather was amazing in it.
He was,

2205
02:09:02.970 --> 02:09:04.680
he's amazing in that boardwalk empire.

2206
02:09:04.690 --> 02:09:09.070
Just started watching that dude that shows fucking,

2207
02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:13.210
that's chose good dude.
Yeah.
There's too many God damn good shows.

2208
02:09:13.570 --> 02:09:16.770
Everybody's like,
you gotta Watch mad men.
Fuck you.
I do.
I do.
Why?

2209
02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:19.000
I do want to watch madmen.
That's on my list of things.

2210
02:09:19.001 --> 02:09:23.230
A little watch mad men just for that girl with the big tits and she had some big

2211
02:09:23.231 --> 02:09:27.370
too.
Those are all totally,
she's a real woman,
Huh?
Yeah.

2212
02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:30.220
That's rare that you see like a big voluptuous,

2213
02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:34.750
sexy plumped one.
The one with the red head.
Yes.

2214
02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:39.480
She's plump as fuck.
Just one up.
Yeah.

2215
02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:44.620
There you go.
Tell me.
Those are redonkulous,
right?
Yeah.
That's a,

2216
02:09:44.621 --> 02:09:47.320
is that what women ever looked like?
No.
You can't say that.

2217
02:09:47.350 --> 02:09:50.650
That's a rare specimen.
You can't call claim that.
That's how they,

2218
02:09:50.860 --> 02:09:54.970
that's how they all looked like in the 20s but you can't that show breaking bad.

2219
02:09:55.540 --> 02:09:59.470
You know which game of Thrones coming back?
Walking dead,
walking dead.

2220
02:09:59.471 --> 02:10:02.200
I keep hearing that too.
That's a problem.
Walking dead.

2221
02:10:02.201 --> 02:10:06.550
Only first couple episodes.
It was good,
but dude,
there's not that much time.
Oh,

2222
02:10:06.551 --> 02:10:08.710
that's the other thing.
I started watching his fucking homeland.

2223
02:10:09.580 --> 02:10:13.210
I started that with season one do.
That's good.
That shows good.

2224
02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:16.780
It's not what I thought it was either.
I thought it was like CSI type.

2225
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:21.670
She's at the titanic bitch girl,
Claire Danes.
No,
no,
no,
no,

2226
02:10:21.671 --> 02:10:25.210
no,
no.
I think you're thinking of a different girl.
I think so.

2227
02:10:26.350 --> 02:10:29.410
Yeah.
Think what is her name?
Is that her name?
Claire Danes.

2228
02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:30.880
Claire Danes is the titanic girl.

2229
02:10:30.910 --> 02:10:33.040
I thought she was in that or maybe I'm thinking of somebody else.

2230
02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:35.420
I don't think Claire Danes is a titanic girl.

2231
02:10:35.421 --> 02:10:39.450
The titanic girl was a little plumper.
No,
that's Claire Danes.
You know.

2232
02:10:39.710 --> 02:10:44.150
Are you sure?
Titanic?
Uh,
yeah.

2233
02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:48.980
Let's see.
Yep.
No,
no,
no.
Yeah.
No,

2234
02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:53.840
I don't think so.
Kate Winslet.
Yes.
There you go.
Claire Danes.

2235
02:10:53.841 --> 02:10:56.330
Just the one who was in this fucking this new show though.

2236
02:10:57.270 --> 02:10:58.860
<v 5>She Claire Danes.
I was thinking of Romeo and Juliet.</v>

2237
02:10:58.861 --> 02:11:01.170
She was in Clara dance with Leonardo Dicaprio thing.

2238
02:11:01.190 --> 02:11:02.340
It was a good movie back in the day.

2239
02:11:02.420 --> 02:11:06.200
<v 4>Yeah.
She's been in a bunch of movies.
She's good man.
She,
she plays a good,</v>

2240
02:11:06.201 --> 02:11:10.500
crazy bitch too.
She's in les Miserables wheels.

2241
02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:14.180
I say that lays and misery.
Les Miserables,

2242
02:11:15.410 --> 02:11:20.030
she was in that,
she's a serious actress that,
uh,
she's good at homeland.

2243
02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:23.600
It's good.
Fuck a trail dude.
Disturbing though.
It makes you wonder,

2244
02:11:24.100 --> 02:11:28.370
but how much of this is ripped from the headlines based on a true story,

2245
02:11:28.730 --> 02:11:31.760
but he,
uh,
that guy's a bad ass actor.
Who the fuck he is?

2246
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:36.470
Who plays the other guy?
Um,
whatever,
whatever.

2247
02:11:38.210 --> 02:11:43.200
And again,
should we bring this bitch home?
That's why it's coming to San Diego.

2248
02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:48.210
12,
12,
12.
Who,
who are these people?
I don't know yet.
I know as your coming here,

2249
02:11:48.420 --> 02:11:50.730
<v 5>Sarah Tiana is going to be on there.
Tony Hinchcliffe.</v>

2250
02:11:50.750 --> 02:11:53.220
You know there's been a few other people that said that they want to come by.

2251
02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:55.380
I haven't really,
I'm reschedule it this week.

2252
02:11:55.490 --> 02:11:57.560
<v 4>December 12th is still a couple of weeks away.</v>

2253
02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:00.950
So what you need to do is just prepare yourself for that night.

2254
02:12:01.250 --> 02:12:04.250
Keep checking Twitter.
We will build the anticipation.
Yes.

2255
02:12:04.370 --> 02:12:07.690
Hopefully I can make it down there for that one.
Uh,
I yeah,
it's a great round.

2256
02:12:07.691 --> 02:12:11.470
Yeah.
I got a lot of shit going on right now.
There's a,
well,

2257
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:14.860
I can't really talk about them in the air.
Good stuff though,
folks.
Um,

2258
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:19.850
so this weekend,
that's it.
Moody Theater,
Austin,
Texas.
Next week,

2259
02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:24.920
um,
Paul or live in Bellevue,
Washington with powerful Sam Tripoli.
And then,

2260
02:12:24.921 --> 02:12:29.630
um,
the Wiltern theater,
December 21st,
2012,
the end of the world show with honey,

2261
02:12:29.631 --> 02:12:31.190
honey,
Doug,
Stan hope,

2262
02:12:31.370 --> 02:12:35.300
Joey motherfucking Diaz and Wa and uh,

2263
02:12:35.420 --> 02:12:38.320
that should be pretty crazy.
That's going to be a fun show and no,

2264
02:12:38.321 --> 02:12:41.870
the f the world's not gonna end.
Relax.
We're going to be fine.
Hopefully.

2265
02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:45.350
Who knows?
It might not be real.
My now be real.
Right Brian?

2266
02:12:45.530 --> 02:12:48.590
I feel like it's not real.
It's definitely not real simulation theory.
You are,

2267
02:12:48.591 --> 02:12:53.480
you're 100% on board now.
Yeah.
Super simulation theory.
What became,

2268
02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:56.750
what was the tipping point that really made you think this to this world's not

2269
02:12:56.751 --> 02:12:57.550
real?

2270
02:12:57.550 --> 02:12:57.701
<v 5>Well,</v>

2271
02:12:57.701 --> 02:13:01.270
if you think of it as if it is a simulation theory and then you start going,

2272
02:13:01.300 --> 02:13:03.070
all right,
this is hilarious.
You know,

2273
02:13:03.130 --> 02:13:07.310
somewhere I'm playing on an iPhone 77 and this is just like,

2274
02:13:07.470 --> 02:13:09.190
because there's just too many things that are like,
all right,

2275
02:13:09.191 --> 02:13:11.200
that's ridiculous that that just happened.

2276
02:13:11.380 --> 02:13:15.100
That's ridiculous that that just happened.
I think so.
I,
I'm,
I'm,

2277
02:13:15.310 --> 02:13:18.790
I don't believe in it,
but I'm acting like I do believe in it.
And just,

2278
02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:22.870
just looking at life through that,
that perspective.
And it really does seem,

2279
02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:27.340
if you just spend like the next week acting like everything's a simulation,

2280
02:13:27.341 --> 02:13:30.070
like don't jump in front of building the art cars or buildings.

2281
02:13:30.071 --> 02:13:32.520
You could jump in front of buildings but don't jump in front of cars.

2282
02:13:32.521 --> 02:13:35.580
But if you think of it as it's a simulation,
it's ridiculous.

2283
02:13:35.581 --> 02:13:39.840
And then so what I've been also adding to it that Asians are the ones that are

2284
02:13:39.900 --> 02:13:43.920
like kind of babysitting us in the Sim simulation.
So if you,

2285
02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:46.830
if you talk about the simulation too much,

2286
02:13:46.860 --> 02:13:50.010
you'll see you're out of nowhere in Asian will come around the corner and just

2287
02:13:50.011 --> 02:13:51.780
stare at you like,
oh,

2288
02:13:51.860 --> 02:13:56.630
<v 4>wait a minute.
That's why are the Asians,
I don't know.
The Asians aliens.
Huh?</v>

2289
02:13:56.690 --> 02:13:58.730
Do you think Asians are alien?
I think Asians are like,

2290
02:13:58.731 --> 02:14:01.370
are like the babysitters that lessen the simulation.

2291
02:14:01.371 --> 02:14:04.070
I think you gotta be very careful when talking about any race.

2292
02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:07.730
Isn't it funny like Asian people can get pissed off at that,
that you'd be like,

2293
02:14:07.731 --> 02:14:11.870
what the fuck do you know?
Yeah.
Because their,
their security,
they're mad.

2294
02:14:12.020 --> 02:14:14.840
You're not supposed to talk about this simulation.
Is that what it is or is it,

2295
02:14:14.841 --> 02:14:16.340
you're not supposed to talk about any,

2296
02:14:16.610 --> 02:14:20.210
you're not supposed to talk about any race at all.
All right.
Even,
you know,

2297
02:14:20.211 --> 02:14:21.560
even if you're saying positive things,

2298
02:14:21.770 --> 02:14:25.370
like the aliens might be more advanced than us and the,
you know,
they,
they,

2299
02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:29.150
they have more uh,
alien DNA in Asian people.

2300
02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:31.550
Like you can't say that cause that's making Asian people better,

2301
02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:34.640
but they'll still get upset.
Like you're not even allowed to talk about them.

2302
02:14:35.420 --> 02:14:37.550
People are so fucking sensitive.
Brian,

2303
02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:40.200
<v 5>I had something weird happened to me the other day.
I have you ever had,</v>

2304
02:14:40.201 --> 02:14:44.490
were like,
I was laying down,
you might have this in the isolation tank,

2305
02:14:44.491 --> 02:14:48.600
but maybe I was laying down and I had my eyes closed and I was looking at the

2306
02:14:48.601 --> 02:14:51.980
images in my,
I like on my eyelids and you know,

2307
02:14:51.990 --> 02:14:53.640
sometimes you see little things floating around.

2308
02:14:53.641 --> 02:14:56.250
Sometimes you might see like little things moving and stuff,

2309
02:14:56.400 --> 02:14:59.070
but I had full on motion video,

2310
02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:02.190
like a person talking somewhere like to somebody else,

2311
02:15:02.191 --> 02:15:05.370
like full on like movement,
like a hundred frames per second.

2312
02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:08.760
Like it was like I was watching somebody talk.

2313
02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:13.650
It wasn't a memory because of memory you think of something and you're like,

2314
02:15:13.651 --> 02:15:15.900
oh yeah,
we were sitting there and then we were talking.

2315
02:15:16.050 --> 02:15:20.340
This was actually watching somebody talk like in full video,

2316
02:15:20.341 --> 02:15:24.510
but it was like just the outline in my eyelid.
I found that trippy

2317
02:15:28.580 --> 02:15:32.730
so
I found that trippy.
Well,

2318
02:15:32.731 --> 02:15:34.470
I mean are you saying you were hallucinating?

2319
02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:37.140
I was [inaudible] your eyes closed but it was,

2320
02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:41.160
it was like always wa it wasn't like the guy was tripping and melting and

2321
02:15:41.190 --> 02:15:42.690
turning into a snake or anything.

2322
02:15:42.691 --> 02:15:45.390
It was like somebody just sitting there having a conversation with somebody.

2323
02:15:45.540 --> 02:15:49.350
But it was full motion.
Like as if it was our was watching somebody,

2324
02:15:49.351 --> 02:15:52.370
like if I were to open my eyes and it was somebody standing there doing it and

2325
02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:53.700
then I'd be like,
okay,
that makes sense.

2326
02:15:53.701 --> 02:15:56.690
But there was no one there and it was like,
you don't think like,

2327
02:15:56.730 --> 02:15:57.990
like I don't dream like that.

2328
02:15:57.991 --> 02:16:00.870
I don't like if I think about somebody you know running,

2329
02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:05.070
I can kind of see them running in my head,
but this was like full on motion.

2330
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:06.190
Like it was weird.

2331
02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:09.380
<v 4>You've done enough drug so you've broken your brain.
Okay maybe that's it.</v>

2332
02:16:09.470 --> 02:16:10.300
Is that possible?

2333
02:16:10.300 --> 02:16:15.300
<v 5>Or I was somehow spying on a different part in the world of the simulation I was</v>

2334
02:16:15.881 --> 02:16:17.230
hacking through the firewalls.

2335
02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:22.320
<v 4>That could be it too.
That could be it too.
You never will.
Yeah.</v>

2336
02:16:22.330 --> 02:16:26.200
You have to figure out like what real is and what's not real.
Right.

2337
02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:27.820
What if you know,

2338
02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:32.140
they were like the reality that we exist in,

2339
02:16:32.170 --> 02:16:37.170
you know the one of the more attractive parts of the simulation theory thing is

2340
02:16:38.710 --> 02:16:43.710
that I do think that thoughts and I do think that a intention can move life in a

2341
02:16:46.121 --> 02:16:47.890
certain way.
I think it's flexible.

2342
02:16:48.070 --> 02:16:50.800
I think the world that we live in is a lot more flexible and then we'd like to

2343
02:16:50.801 --> 02:16:55.420
thank and our rigid interpretation of things as being like the only things that

2344
02:16:55.421 --> 02:16:58.270
are real or things you can weigh or measure and knock on.

2345
02:16:59.740 --> 02:17:04.330
I don't think so man.
I think there's some,
uh,
some fucking weirdness to it all.

2346
02:17:05.050 --> 02:17:09.130
So the idea of a simulation theory sorta comes into play it because there's

2347
02:17:09.131 --> 02:17:12.370
certain things that do get manifested with the mind.

2348
02:17:12.670 --> 02:17:17.550
There's certain people that sorta almost are like extras in a movie and there's

2349
02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:22.390
certain events that almost are like peripheral non events that you could choose

2350
02:17:22.391 --> 02:17:26.080
to pay attention to,
are not paying attention to in the background,
but your,

2351
02:17:26.170 --> 02:17:31.060
your main focus,
your,
your life,
the things that that's going on in your world.

2352
02:17:31.061 --> 02:17:33.040
You have a little bit of control over it.

2353
02:17:33.310 --> 02:17:37.630
You got a little bit of wiggle room there.
It's not as simple as,
you know,

2354
02:17:38.020 --> 02:17:42.110
uh,
drive one mile and you're a mile away from where you wear it.
It.

2355
02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:44.510
It has to do more with what,
what,

2356
02:17:44.700 --> 02:17:48.070
where you are is in your head a little bit and where you're,

2357
02:17:48.130 --> 02:17:51.640
when you're traveling and when you're,
when you're going places,
you're still,

2358
02:17:51.641 --> 02:17:56.440
you're,
you're bringing your world to these other places and influencing it.

2359
02:17:56.810 --> 02:17:59.680
When you,
when you go to Starbucks,
when you,
when you get in your house,

2360
02:17:59.681 --> 02:18:03.910
you're bringing your world everywhere you go and I don't know how much of what

2361
02:18:03.911 --> 02:18:06.340
goes on outside your world really involves you.

2362
02:18:06.730 --> 02:18:10.030
There might be a bunch of different parallel worlds intersecting with each other

2363
02:18:10.031 --> 02:18:10.481
all the time.

2364
02:18:10.481 --> 02:18:14.200
We're just only able to perceive the shit that we consider to be our world.

2365
02:18:14.500 --> 02:18:18.520
We're told Deja Vu is our mind thinking of something before it's actually dying.

2366
02:18:18.521 --> 02:18:20.140
Like,
like if you go into our room,

2367
02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:24.340
your brain actually thinks of something like a micro micro micro second before

2368
02:18:24.341 --> 02:18:26.530
you actually think of it.
Instead it feels like Deja Vu.

2369
02:18:26.531 --> 02:18:29.650
That's what scientists are saying.
But what if that is something like,
no,

2370
02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:31.780
we've been in this simulation before.

2371
02:18:31.860 --> 02:18:35.050
We've been in the city with wasting before about last time we died in a fucking

2372
02:18:35.051 --> 02:18:38.200
motorcycle accident and this time we're doing it again.
You know,

2373
02:18:38.260 --> 02:18:42.340
like it could be this.
There's also the idea is that every thought that you make,

2374
02:18:42.370 --> 02:18:42.881
there's this,

2375
02:18:42.881 --> 02:18:46.840
this is one of the weirdest theories that I've ever heard about reality.

2376
02:18:47.130 --> 02:18:49.090
That every decision you make,

2377
02:18:49.091 --> 02:18:54.091
every direction you choose to go and branches you off into a completely separate

2378
02:18:54.371 --> 02:18:57.820
area of the universe and it creates an entirely new universe with new

2379
02:18:57.970 --> 02:19:00.880
possibilities and new probabilities.

2380
02:19:01.060 --> 02:19:03.880
It's like one of the things that he used to say about time travel is you can

2381
02:19:03.881 --> 02:19:05.860
never really go back in time because if you did,

2382
02:19:05.861 --> 02:19:10.120
you could affect the reality of just by existing in the past,

2383
02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:13.630
you could affect the future so much that you might never have been born.

2384
02:19:13.780 --> 02:19:17.170
You could,
you could really fuck up the possibilities for everything.

2385
02:19:17.171 --> 02:19:21.340
Like you could throw a ripple into the wave.
Well,
the idea is that you,

2386
02:19:21.370 --> 02:19:26.140
you sort of do that with every decision you make and every direction you move

2387
02:19:26.141 --> 02:19:28.130
in.
And that not only

2388
02:19:28.130 --> 02:19:32.000
<v 1>is that possibility a reality,</v>

2389
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:36.950
but that all the other possibilities are alternate realities that you don't

2390
02:19:36.951 --> 02:19:40.400
experience.
But you could have made every wrong choice,

2391
02:19:40.401 --> 02:19:44.550
every possible choice and they all branch off into completely new universes and

2392
02:19:44.551 --> 02:19:46.670
that all these things are going on together at the same time.

2393
02:19:46.671 --> 02:19:48.470
And then when you are having a Deja Vu,

2394
02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:53.680
you're almost like criss crossing with your possible worlds and you have like a

2395
02:19:53.691 --> 02:19:58.010
blip in the matrix,
a blip.
And yeah,
we just,

2396
02:19:58.011 --> 02:20:00.110
we know what we can measure and we know,

2397
02:20:00.111 --> 02:20:02.480
we know that when you get in the car and you hit the gas,

2398
02:20:02.481 --> 02:20:05.390
you know exactly how fast you go and you look at the speedometer.

2399
02:20:05.780 --> 02:20:09.980
But what we don't know is what we're not measuring weird feelings between
people.

2400
02:20:09.981 --> 02:20:11.900
You think about someone they call,

2401
02:20:12.140 --> 02:20:16.040
there's a weird shit that we don't understand that we don't measure.

2402
02:20:16.040 --> 02:20:18.180
And so we kinda like push it under the mattress.

2403
02:20:18.650 --> 02:20:21.350
But that shit is tangible.

2404
02:20:21.351 --> 02:20:24.080
The feeling that you get when someone doesn't like you.
You know,

2405
02:20:24.081 --> 02:20:25.700
like if you ever been around someone,
like,

2406
02:20:25.730 --> 02:20:30.710
especially if you around like a girl and her friend doesn't like you and you

2407
02:20:30.711 --> 02:20:34.530
don't even have to like say a word,
you just feel it.
Yeah.
You'll feel it.
Go.

2408
02:20:34.900 --> 02:20:37.730
What the fuck's going on here?
That that's a real,

2409
02:20:37.970 --> 02:20:42.440
that's a real energy being passed back and forth and that can really affect your

2410
02:20:42.441 --> 02:20:44.540
life if that person's in your life,

2411
02:20:44.600 --> 02:20:48.080
that gross feeling now becomes a part of your reality.

2412
02:20:48.290 --> 02:20:52.430
That it actually shapes your possibilities.
I Dunno.

2413
02:20:53.330 --> 02:20:56.420
I think,
I think,
um,
we're,

2414
02:20:56.421 --> 02:21:01.421
we're learning a lot about reality about what you can and can't do to influence

2415
02:21:01.611 --> 02:21:03.620
it,
what you can and can't do to shape it.

2416
02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:05.930
We are learning a lot about it by doing this fucking show.

2417
02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:10.370
We're changing reality.
Brian,
do you know a lot of people,

2418
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:13.130
the realities are being changed because of the show?

2419
02:21:14.630 --> 02:21:17.900
They get access to different ideas now.
They don't exist.
They don't exist.

2420
02:21:17.930 --> 02:21:21.380
I think they do.
I think we don't exist.
How about that?
Oh,
how about that?

2421
02:21:21.950 --> 02:21:23.030
How about we,
uh,

2422
02:21:23.090 --> 02:21:26.510
we have been created by other people's imaginations to rescue them from South

2423
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:31.010
Dakota.
How about that could be in their world.

2424
02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:35.450
You don't exist,
right?
The fuck kind of hippy bullshit is this folks,

2425
02:21:35.451 --> 02:21:40.451
this is no way to end a sensible podcast with the great John McAfee on the run

2426
02:21:41.091 --> 02:21:46.091
and believes this has been a wonderful experience.

2427
02:21:46.300 --> 02:21:49.070
I'm glad you came along with us on this little magical mystery tour.

2428
02:21:49.430 --> 02:21:53.150
We will be back tomorrow.
Uh,
it looks like we got to do tomorrow fairly early.

2429
02:21:53.180 --> 02:21:56.300
Like noonish with the Great Duncan Trussell.

2430
02:21:56.750 --> 02:21:59.870
I got some shit I got to do in the afternoon.
Uh,
so,
uh,

2431
02:21:59.900 --> 02:22:01.310
that will be tomorrow's podcast.

2432
02:22:01.311 --> 02:22:04.730
And then Thursday the one and only Eddie motherfucking bravo.

2433
02:22:04.731 --> 02:22:06.770
And that will also be around the same time,

2434
02:22:07.250 --> 02:22:11.510
which is a 12 ish pm Pacific time.

2435
02:22:11.810 --> 02:22:16.070
You fucking freaks.
And uh,
both of those will be done with shitty Internet.
So,
uh,

2436
02:22:16.370 --> 02:22:18.020
good luck trying to watch it on Ustream,

2437
02:22:18.530 --> 02:22:21.560
but we'll have it up on iTunes and we'll eventually get that internet thing

2438
02:22:21.590 --> 02:22:22.310
figured out.

2439
02:22:22.310 --> 02:22:25.980
Even if I have to call our congressman and I have to get Joe Biden on the phone,

2440
02:22:25.981 --> 02:22:29.280
we're going to straighten this out.
If I need to make a donation,

2441
02:22:29.730 --> 02:22:32.130
we're going to work it out,
folks.
We're going to keep it together.

2442
02:22:32.220 --> 02:22:36.150
We're going to make it grow.
We're all in this freak ride together.

2443
02:22:36.660 --> 02:22:40.230
Anything saying,
Brian,
anything to add all these beautiful people out there.
Um,

2444
02:22:40.650 --> 02:22:43.530
it's not.
Get Hollywood improv.
December 20th,

2445
02:22:43.980 --> 02:22:48.660
American Comedy Club in San Diego,
12,
12,
12.
Okay.
You,

2446
02:22:48.661 --> 02:22:51.300
you heard it all there.
You fucks.
And we'll see you.

2447
02:22:51.301 --> 02:22:55.320
Brian will be with me and the Great Duncan Trussell this Saturday night in

2448
02:22:55.321 --> 02:22:58.340
Austin,
Texas at the Moody Theater.
All right.
You fucks.
Uh,

2449
02:22:58.380 --> 02:22:59.400
we love the shit out of you.

2450
02:22:59.670 --> 02:23:03.150
We never anticipate any of this happening and we're enjoying every step of the

2451
02:23:03.151 --> 02:23:08.100
way.
And,
uh,
we love the fuck out of you and we'll see you soon.

2452
02:23:08.790 --> 02:23:09.623
Bye.
Bye.

2453
02:23:28.150 --> 02:23:28.200
<v 7>Okay.</v>
