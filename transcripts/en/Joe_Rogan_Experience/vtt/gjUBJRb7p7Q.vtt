00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.520
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.350
Adam Carolla's here.

3
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:05.101
Did you do too much?

4
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:05.820
Shit,

5
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.840
I do too much shit.

6
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:09.030
But you do too much shit compared to the shit that I do.

7
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.100
You did just did a fucking movie.

8
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.090
How do you have time to do a movie?

9
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:13.410
You do 85 podcasts.

10
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:14.970
He'd do a TV show on spike,

11
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.490
got a family grown a beard,

12
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.710
drive cars.

13
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.371
The beards.

14
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:21.450
Easiest part.

15
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.373
But keep going.

16
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.030
Tell you what's in pubes.

17
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.230
Do standup comedy.

18
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:26.570
You do a lot of podcasts.

19
00:00:26.571 --> 00:00:26.940
Yes.

20
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.810
What the fuck dude?

21
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.760
Well I,

22
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.790
you know,

23
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.303
I,

24
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.051
I I,

25
00:00:32.051 --> 00:00:32.431
you know,

26
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:37.431
a couple of things I started realized like after I had my twins that what I did

27
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.420
was radio podcasting,

28
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:45.540
but I felt like it was all just floating up into the ether,

29
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.553
you know,

30
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.310
and I thought I want some sort of permanent record,

31
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.930
like some sort of legacy,

32
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.410
you know,

33
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.861
books,

34
00:00:52.861 --> 00:00:53.694
movies,

35
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.410
the stuff that gets passed around.

36
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.550
You know,

37
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.810
what I'm saying is,

38
00:00:57.811 --> 00:01:00.240
is over Christmas time,

39
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.400
me and my eight year old twins,

40
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.480
we watched planes,

41
00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:03.841
trains,

42
00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:05.850
and automobiles and loved the shit out of it.

43
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.330
And that movies like 30 years old now.

44
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.990
Great.

45
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.220
It's great fucking movie,

46
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:12.300
but you want to feel old.

47
00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:14.280
It's like how long has John Candy Been Dead?

48
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:15.120
Like six years now.

49
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.880
15 years or 20 years like,

50
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.050
but the point is is that thing and John Hughes too,

51
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.940
so they didn't,

52
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.370
we weren't listening to you know,

53
00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:31.371
ass crack and backsack in the morning from 1984 we were watching a movie for

54
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.450
that era and I just sort of had this feeling at a certain point like yeah,

55
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.870
I like doing the podcast.

56
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:42.810
I liked doing radio and TV shows and stuff like that,

57
00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:46.230
but doing a movie for some reason,

58
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:51.231
those are the ones that get passed on versus the podcast and look,

59
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.410
I'm sure someone long after will be,

60
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.100
we're gone or going to be listening to our archives,

61
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.770
but not what the rate year olds,

62
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.120
right?

63
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.391
No,

64
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:00.901
definitely not.

65
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:04.140
What they're eight year olds and they might be listening to our archives or our

66
00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:06.330
archives might all be lost out in the ether.

67
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.770
That's possible too.

68
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.131
That's,

69
00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:13.131
that's kind of what I felt like all I ever did was talk and all it ever did was

70
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:16.440
just float up and just go up into the,

71
00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:21.300
into the atmosphere and blow away maybe maybe into Canada and caused them acid

72
00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:21.660
rain.

73
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.620
So that was really your,

74
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:24.350
your motivation was just a leaves,

75
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.440
a solid legacy.

76
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.701
Who's this?

77
00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:28.230
Like I,

78
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.213
I read,

79
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.581
it was,

80
00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:32.070
it was two things for me and movies.

81
00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:34.380
It was a whole bunch of people sort of saying,

82
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:34.591
well you,

83
00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:35.850
you can't do movies.

84
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:38.970
You do radio and the radio guy or you know,

85
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:41.370
you can't do this just for me.

86
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.430
Not,

87
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.990
not,

88
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.130
not saying you can't,

89
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:46.170
but not being taken seriously.

90
00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:47.700
Like you can go do this.

91
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.400
And then the other thing is like I had an idea for a movie,

92
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:51.870
which I don't have that often,

93
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.790
but what I want to have an idea,

94
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:55.260
I want to execute the idea.

95
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.360
Right.

96
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.200
You probably wired that way.

97
00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.850
Yeah.

98
00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:59.080
Yeah.

99
00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.913
Once I have,

100
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.161
it's almost like a,

101
00:03:01.161 --> 00:03:01.481
yeah,

102
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.100
you get like a seed is growing.

103
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.810
It starts poking out through the dirt and you're like,

104
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:05.021
all right,

105
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:05.920
we got to do something here.

106
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:06.340
This is,

107
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.173
this is moving.

108
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.841
Right.

109
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:11.530
So I made a movie called the hammer like eight years ago and I didn't make any

110
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:12.161
more movies.

111
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:14.890
And then I had this idea like two years ago and I was like,

112
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:15.340
let's,

113
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.173
let's do it.

114
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.770
And the hammer was about a boxer,

115
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:18.490
right?

116
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.230
He had the hammer was about a boxer and this is more about a road hard is more

117
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:28.231
about just comedians and the road and getting old and how the road is getting

118
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:31.150
old for a lot of these guys.

119
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.140
Cause I started seeing all these guys passing through my studio.

120
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.380
Like you see him to write and they're like going,

121
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:38.621
hey,

122
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:39.940
it's going to be down at hilarity.

123
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.541
And Addison,

124
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:41.374
Texas,

125
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.221
that's one show.

126
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:44.060
And then to Friday to Saturday.

127
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.460
And then he'd go like,

128
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:45.611
yeah,

129
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:48.180
I got to blow in a day early to do local radio.

130
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.840
I need you think to yourself,

131
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:50.111
God,

132
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:52.530
I used to watch that guy on in living color.

133
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.540
I used to watch that guy on a sitcom or something and now he's back on the road

134
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.610
and I know he ain't happy about it,

135
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.600
but he's on the road and I just kind of wanted to tell that story about taking a

136
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:06.190
step backward in life.

137
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.820
So this is a story is about a guy who was a sitcom actor who has to do standup

138
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.970
again to make a living,

139
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.000
got divorced,

140
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:13.990
work dried up.

141
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.750
It all became reality shows,

142
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:17.711
you know,

143
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:20.080
he used to remember that holding deals,

144
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:23.320
development deals free money if they don't exist anymore,

145
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:23.770
right?

146
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.981
No,

147
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:25.000
those deals,

148
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.190
you know those deals.

149
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.710
I mean they took all,

150
00:04:29.711 --> 00:04:29.981
you know,

151
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:34.981
soon as Roseanne and Seinfeld and Tim Allen and Ray Romano had success doing

152
00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:39.220
sitcoms.

153
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.020
Hollywood was like,

154
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.360
who's the next Ray Romano going to be?

155
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.870
And so they started bringing guys in and throw in tons of cash,

156
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.050
Adam just to spit ball ideas and just whatever.

157
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:50.980
And there was a lot of God.

158
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.280
And so the guys who immediately got off the road because they're like,

159
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:54.911
screw that,

160
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:55.960
I'm moving to Hollywood.

161
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.660
And some of them had some success.

162
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.860
Some of them had some difficulties in marriage rehab,

163
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:03.701
things like that.

164
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:06.930
The point is is now they're all knocking on the door,

165
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.750
50 divorced and ready to hit the road.

166
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:11.584
Again.

167
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.000
They don't want to hit the road,

168
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.980
but how else are you going to make a living?

169
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.260
It's all reality.

170
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.940
It's all reality show.

171
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:19.301
Interesting.

172
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:19.750
So this guy,

173
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.210
this idea got in your head because of dealing with all these people that come

174
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:23.044
into your studio?

175
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:24.580
No.

176
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.070
I mean yes it was snowing combination.

177
00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:27.221
No,

178
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:32.221
I started seeing like you know that thought where the guys explaining the club

179
00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:34.750
he's going to and you're like,

180
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.700
I know that club and then you start,

181
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.080
your next thought is that's kind of a,

182
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.610
that's kind of a shitty club.

183
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:40.773
And then you think,

184
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.411
wait a minute,

185
00:05:41.411 --> 00:05:42.730
this guy kind of a name.

186
00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:44.800
Like this guy's a little bit of a household name.

187
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.830
Why is he playing that Shitty club?

188
00:05:47.831 --> 00:05:50.140
And then you start feeling sort of bad for him,

189
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:53.680
even though you shouldn't cause Roofer,

190
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.210
cop,

191
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.990
fireman,

192
00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.980
all all real jobs versus going to hilarides and getting paid for,

193
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.370
you know,

194
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.710
standing up on stage and holding a beer in your hand.

195
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:06.440
But you're feeling bad for this guy because you know,

196
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:07.910
he doesn't really want to go there.

197
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.140
And you know,

198
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.910
he has other friends.

199
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.511
You know,

200
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:13.040
I'd have David Allen Greer say,

201
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:13.940
I got to go to Addison,

202
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:17.870
Texas and I know Jamie Foxx doesn't have to go to Addison,

203
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:19.820
Texas raw.

204
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.880
And at some point he was probably telling Jamie Foxx,

205
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:26.300
here's how comedy works,

206
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:27.134
rather sit down.

207
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.573
You know what I mean?

208
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.480
So yeah,

209
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.100
it was,

210
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:36.100
it was telling the story of stepping backwards and,

211
00:06:36.101 --> 00:06:36.950
and for me,

212
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.661
uh,

213
00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:38.961
you know,

214
00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:40.880
I had to live it myself.

215
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.600
I live that story in my,

216
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.961
you know,

217
00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:45.440
about,

218
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.990
uh,

219
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.660
when in 2009 when I got fired from my radio job,

220
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.270
there were no jobs and there's no,

221
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:58.570
there was no radio jobs and there was no television jobs,

222
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:00.020
far as I could tell.

223
00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:00.261
I mean,

224
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:01.610
like the phone wasn't ringing.

225
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.601
And,

226
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:03.434
uh,

227
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.580
the only way,

228
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.580
and I had young twins and I just had to hit the road and I didn't have an act.

229
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.870
All I had was Adam Carolla's coming to your town and that was good enough to

230
00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:19.130
sell a few tickets and I was just coming to your town and I just told the

231
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:19.964
booker,

232
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:20.570
you know,

233
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:21.381
wherever,

234
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:22.214
whenever,

235
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.690
how many shows,

236
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:24.560
it doesn't matter.

237
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.490
I'm there.

238
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:26.323
Wow.

239
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.500
And I spent a year being like humbled,

240
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:30.891
you know,

241
00:07:30.891 --> 00:07:31.581
six years ago.

242
00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:32.414
That's not very long ago.

243
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:32.901
No,

244
00:07:32.901 --> 00:07:34.130
it's not that long ago.

245
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:39.131
And it was a lot of southwest flights and red roof inns and a lot of like,

246
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.860
I didn't know the road so I didn't know about what you get an opener so you

247
00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:45.500
don't have to do a full 90 minutes set or whatever.

248
00:07:45.501 --> 00:07:49.190
I was doing three 95 minutes sets in a row by yourself,

249
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.150
just find myself.

250
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.650
You're doing three shows on Friday,

251
00:07:51.651 --> 00:07:52.461
like that kind of deal.

252
00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:53.570
It's three shows on Saturday.

253
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.300
When when I,

254
00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.260
when I started a really like started to crack

255
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:02.773
is uh,

256
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.410
we did,

257
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:04.220
we are,

258
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:04.971
our gig was,

259
00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:08.150
we're a book a night at cop Thursday,

260
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.310
Thursday night at cobb's in San Francisco.

261
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.050
It's a pretty good sized club.

262
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.400
So Thursday night,

263
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.641
you know,

264
00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:15.470
it's like I don't 500 seats or something.

265
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.610
So it's a Thursday night.

266
00:08:16.611 --> 00:08:17.750
We'll do a show in cobb's,

267
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.610
then we'll go to Kirkland,

268
00:08:19.611 --> 00:08:21.740
Washington and we'll do two shows Friday,

269
00:08:21.741 --> 00:08:22.730
two shows Saturday.

270
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:23.420
I said,

271
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.253
all right,

272
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.270
so I get the call.

273
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.390
The first show was sold out.

274
00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:27.590
You want to add a second show,

275
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.440
second show added,

276
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:31.970
sold out.

277
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.560
You want to add a third show.

278
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.340
Now I know that third shows going to be miserable,

279
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.880
but I'm only going to San Francisco to try to get some money and bring it back.

280
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:46.130
And the nicer of the flight and the nicer the hotel,

281
00:08:46.131 --> 00:08:48.110
the less money that comes back.

282
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.000
And I used to say to someone,

283
00:08:50.001 --> 00:08:50.211
look,

284
00:08:50.211 --> 00:08:54.140
I'm just going to wake up Friday morning in San Francisco one way or the other.

285
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.500
If I do one show,

286
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:59.850
two shows or three shows at some point I'm going to wake up that next day and

287
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:01.140
I'll just be in a hotel bed.

288
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:06.300
Maya's we'll have an extra whatever amount of grand in my pocket.

289
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:06.840
Right?

290
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.400
So just go for it.

291
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.713
So I did it.

292
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.990
And then the same thing happened in Kirkland,

293
00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:13.824
Washington,

294
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.750
three shows for a show,

295
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:16.291
second show,

296
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:17.490
third year they all sold out.

297
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:18.510
So they kept adding them.

298
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.290
And before you knew it I was like disoriented,

299
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.440
like up on stage and I thought 90 minutes,

300
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:27.450
what's the minimum amount I could do?

301
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:33.320
So I do like 95 a hundred minutes of show and I didn't know about the opener or

302
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.890
the local guy or the anything.

303
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.570
So never brought anybody with you at all?

304
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:37.260
No.

305
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:37.661
See that.

306
00:09:37.661 --> 00:09:38.381
That's that.

307
00:09:38.381 --> 00:09:39.600
That the problem with the road would,

308
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.320
when you do that,

309
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.280
it gets really lonely.

310
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:42.323
It gets weird.

311
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.530
I always had Mike August with me who was,

312
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.700
who was booking all this stuff and was,

313
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.451
you know,

314
00:09:48.451 --> 00:09:52.140
it was fun to see him in the green room eating every time to see what he ate.

315
00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:52.660
You know,

316
00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:53.051
I just,

317
00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:54.510
the remnants of what he ordered,

318
00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:57.570
like I'm set the Matsu Mozzarella sticks or the chicken fingers,

319
00:09:57.571 --> 00:09:57.840
Mike.

320
00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.673
I got them both.

321
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.920
He'd just be watching college football the whole time on the sofa.

322
00:10:01.921 --> 00:10:03.630
That's way too big for the room that it's in.

323
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:04.290
Right.

324
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:05.123
And,

325
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.330
but we just went for it.

326
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:07.590
Like that was it.

327
00:10:07.591 --> 00:10:11.430
So I got this weird crash course on the road,

328
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:12.691
you know,

329
00:10:12.691 --> 00:10:17.490
at age 43 or 44 and I was like,

330
00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:18.031
wow,

331
00:10:18.031 --> 00:10:18.864
man,

332
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.160
this is rough.

333
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:20.851
I mean,

334
00:10:20.851 --> 00:10:22.620
it would've been cool at 27.

335
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:23.640
Yeah.

336
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.780
Single and whatnot.

337
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:25.141
Well,

338
00:10:25.141 --> 00:10:25.471
it's also,

339
00:10:25.471 --> 00:10:26.490
you didn't have an act,

340
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:30.660
so you just have an app ideas that you would just talk about on stage for 90

341
00:10:30.661 --> 00:10:31.320
minutes.

342
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.153
Um,

343
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:33.743
how did it go?

344
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:35.260
It went,

345
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.110
went surprisingly well.

346
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.250
They're happy to see you.

347
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:39.450
They're happy to see me,

348
00:10:39.451 --> 00:10:39.811
but that's,

349
00:10:39.811 --> 00:10:41.640
that's not going to last 95 minutes.

350
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.050
You had some ideas.

351
00:10:43.051 --> 00:10:46.140
He must've had some stuff do you were planning on talking about when you got up

352
00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:46.530
there?

353
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:51.530
What I would do is I would the first like hour or 45 minutes or something would

354
00:10:52.711 --> 00:10:53.220
just be,

355
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.870
what can Adam complain about it and people just shout out shit from the audience

356
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.030
and I would have to riff on it,

357
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.980
but it would be kind of a calorie burner because I have to,

358
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:06.150
you know,

359
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.990
come up with this material and then my head would start swimming.

360
00:11:09.991 --> 00:11:10.171
Like,

361
00:11:10.171 --> 00:11:11.400
did I do this already?

362
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.840
I couldn't remember if I did it in first.

363
00:11:12.841 --> 00:11:15.840
The guy yelled out kittens that he yelled at in this show or is that the third

364
00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:16.920
show or the second show?

365
00:11:16.921 --> 00:11:19.530
Like start floating a little up there.

366
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:20.460
Um,

367
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:21.630
but eventually

368
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.060
what I would do is you,

369
00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:25.510
you know,

370
00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:26.820
I'd walk through Kirkland,

371
00:11:26.821 --> 00:11:27.900
Washington and I'd see,

372
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:28.230
oh,

373
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:32.430
they have little flags that they use that go into a little receptacle.

374
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:32.880
And when they,

375
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.050
when you cross the street,

376
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.200
even at a signal and the crosswalk,

377
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:40.110
you hold the little flag up and then you go set it back down.

378
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.690
And the receptacle on the other side of the street,

379
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.200
everyone,

380
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.033
Washington,

381
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:44.521
well,

382
00:11:44.521 --> 00:11:49.170
they provide them for everybody that you have to have a flag to cross the

383
00:11:49.171 --> 00:11:49.620
street.

384
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.570
You're not going to get penalized by it.

385
00:11:51.571 --> 00:11:54.430
It's just a courtesy that the town of Kirkland,

386
00:11:54.431 --> 00:11:55.960
Washington offers.

387
00:11:55.961 --> 00:11:57.100
What's the benefit of the flag?

388
00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.350
You not being run over?

389
00:11:59.410 --> 00:11:59.591
Well,

390
00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:01.810
they don't see you if you don't have a flag or they've,

391
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:03.520
you're more visible.

392
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:05.790
Well,

393
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:09.790
what the Fuck Joe Rogan Fuck is wrong with your eyesight up in Kirkland wa how

394
00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:10.840
cloudy is it up there?

395
00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:15.580
I haven't saying however visible visible Joe Rogan is,

396
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.900
he's at least 35% more visible with an orange flag over his head.

397
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:20.913
Wow.

398
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:21.401
Yeah.

399
00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:22.540
How bizarre.

400
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:23.950
Well prompted that.

401
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:24.641
I don't know,

402
00:12:24.641 --> 00:12:26.320
but there's my first 15 minutes.

403
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.183
Oh yeah,

404
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.140
I could see you going on for an hour about that.

405
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:30.310
Yeah.

406
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:32.770
So I would blow into every town and just,

407
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.960
you'll look around with a buck slip and go like flag window.

408
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.611
So we're there.

409
00:12:36.611 --> 00:12:37.040
Okay.

410
00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:37.481
What's going on?

411
00:12:37.481 --> 00:12:38.680
And by the half of it was,

412
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:39.140
oh,

413
00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.290
the last lascon airline flight out here,

414
00:12:41.291 --> 00:12:41.421
blah,

415
00:12:41.421 --> 00:12:41.900
blah blah.

416
00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:42.460
You know,

417
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.300
just anything,

418
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.180
just anything.

419
00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.580
And then once I hit the stage,

420
00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:46.120
I could,

421
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.320
I could riff on it.

422
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:48.821
But after,

423
00:12:48.821 --> 00:12:49.180
you know,

424
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.790
obviously after,

425
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:52.690
uh,

426
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:53.030
what,

427
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:54.820
what started happening is then,

428
00:12:54.821 --> 00:12:55.240
you know,

429
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.680
next week in Phoenix,

430
00:12:56.681 --> 00:12:57.371
I'd go a,

431
00:12:57.371 --> 00:12:58.840
you guys got a nice town,

432
00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:00.040
but let me tell you about Kirkland,

433
00:13:00.041 --> 00:13:00.641
Washington.

434
00:13:00.641 --> 00:13:02.170
They got flax to cross,

435
00:13:02.171 --> 00:13:02.511
you know,

436
00:13:02.511 --> 00:13:05.080
and then I could do the same 10 minutes again.

437
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.680
And that's the how the act was built during the course of the experience on the

438
00:13:12.221 --> 00:13:12.990
road.

439
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.070
That there's a lot of guys who wind up doing that,

440
00:13:15.071 --> 00:13:15.281
that,

441
00:13:15.281 --> 00:13:15.570
uh,

442
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:20.570
are Sitcom actors that wound up doing stand up after they became a sitcom actor.

443
00:13:20.681 --> 00:13:22.390
Like screech from saved by the bells,

444
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:23.920
particularly famous for it.

445
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:24.200
Well,

446
00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:24.500
yeah,

447
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.540
it just got a name.

448
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:26.180
Yeah.

449
00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:26.480
Yeah.

450
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.570
Danny Bonaduce wouldn't do an act like,

451
00:13:28.571 --> 00:13:30.730
it's just like you don't have an act,

452
00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:32.500
but you do have a currency.

453
00:13:32.501 --> 00:13:33.191
The currencies,

454
00:13:33.191 --> 00:13:35.920
we recognize your name on the marquee.

455
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.203
Uh,

456
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:42.480
so folks who weren't formally standups are now going to have to be fake standups

457
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.770
if and they want to eat.

458
00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:45.430
Yeah.

459
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.200
Do you remember skippy from family ties?

460
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.010
Sure.

461
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.080
He used to do that skippy from family ties.

462
00:13:50.081 --> 00:13:51.520
Like when I was first starting out,

463
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:55.090
he was hitting the road skippy though.

464
00:13:55.091 --> 00:13:57.880
I mean to give the skippy is due.

465
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:58.600
He was,

466
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.190
he was doing it like when he was doing it or while she was gone.

467
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:04.990
He was even before or after.

468
00:14:04.991 --> 00:14:06.370
I mean somebody can research this,

469
00:14:06.371 --> 00:14:11.170
but I remember doing two things.

470
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.070
I remember doing an open mic at the Improv,

471
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.070
the Melrose improv about,

472
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:18.820
you know,

473
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:23.820
1985 maybe 1986 and skippy was there.

474
00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:25.620
So it was,

475
00:14:25.621 --> 00:14:26.260
it wasn't like,

476
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.680
oh that show got cancelled and now he's trying his hand at stand up like he was

477
00:14:29.681 --> 00:14:30.670
banging away at it.

478
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:35.970
I also think the guy went up missing recently and maybe dead went out in like

479
00:14:36.421 --> 00:14:38.020
the wilderness and like killed himself.

480
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.140
Someone's going to have to do some skippy research.

481
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:44.710
I think you might be confused and skippy with the guy who killed the a,

482
00:14:44.711 --> 00:14:47.050
the development deal that we were talking about earlier,

483
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.070
it's chicken.

484
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.060
Do you know that story?

485
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:49.930
No.

486
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.620
You don't know what killed the development deal?

487
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.370
<v 1>No,</v>

488
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:53.720
they're the Montreal.

489
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:58.400
Specially the Montreal comedy festival was this big event where all the industry

490
00:14:58.401 --> 00:15:02.540
would go there and it was really kind of an excuse to go drink and uh,

491
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:03.260
been there.

492
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.540
They would go and have a great time,

493
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:09.260
but they would hand out these development deals and some of them were pretty big

494
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:14.200
and a really big one was given to this guy that called himself chicken and

495
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.220
chicken would,

496
00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.130
it was a young,

497
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.800
cute guy and he would go wacky on stage,

498
00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:23.801
sort of Jim Carrey ask and the less aware of the industry,

499
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.440
like you know those people that you talk to and they're just kind of,

500
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.600
they're kind of like a metal filings getting pulled towards the magnet.

501
00:15:32.601 --> 00:15:34.370
They don't necessarily have their own compass.

502
00:15:34.371 --> 00:15:37.940
They don't necessarily have their own opinion on things that they formulated.

503
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:39.380
They might be young,

504
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.150
they might be impressionable,

505
00:15:41.151 --> 00:15:42.080
but they kind of go with,

506
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.261
oh,

507
00:15:42.261 --> 00:15:43.010
he's amazing.

508
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:44.120
He's so talented.

509
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.200
He's so good.

510
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.490
You should see his energy.

511
00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:47.324
It's incredible.

512
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:51.300
And Ralph had had about a million people and then you meet the guy or you see

513
00:15:51.301 --> 00:15:52.400
his act or you're whatever,

514
00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:53.180
and you're like,

515
00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.710
what am I missing?

516
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.220
This was that times a hundred this was that.

517
00:15:58.221 --> 00:15:59.510
This was like every comic.

518
00:15:59.511 --> 00:15:59.811
I mean,

519
00:15:59.811 --> 00:16:01.190
every comic was like,

520
00:16:01.191 --> 00:16:02.120
what the fuck?

521
00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.480
Like you'll get comics that'll defend the most undependable,

522
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:06.470
you know what you mean?

523
00:16:06.471 --> 00:16:08.060
There's a lot of comics that you know,

524
00:16:08.061 --> 00:16:08.361
love,

525
00:16:08.361 --> 00:16:10.520
all sorts of weird marginal acts,

526
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:12.020
but this guy was off the charts,

527
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.210
off the charts bad or off the charts bad,

528
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.670
but got a giant development deal,

529
00:16:16.671 --> 00:16:20.270
like a half a million dollars and it just went south.

530
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:21.620
He came to Hollywood,

531
00:16:21.621 --> 00:16:22.251
can act,

532
00:16:22.251 --> 00:16:22.941
can't do anything.

533
00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:23.774
Started bombing.

534
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:24.831
They realized like,

535
00:16:24.831 --> 00:16:25.431
what did we do?

536
00:16:25.431 --> 00:16:29.450
We gave a half million dollars to a crazy person and literally that was the end

537
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.350
of the development deal.

538
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.360
It just stopped with this one guy.

539
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:36.080
He wound up hanging himself in front of a school somewhere.

540
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:36.691
That's the,

541
00:16:36.691 --> 00:16:36.910
the,

542
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:38.000
the urban myth.

543
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.481
Oh really?

544
00:16:38.481 --> 00:16:39.170
I don't know.

545
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.100
Urban legend rather.

546
00:16:40.101 --> 00:16:42.380
I'm not sure if that's actually exactly what happened.

547
00:16:42.381 --> 00:16:43.280
I know he killed himself.

548
00:16:43.281 --> 00:16:44.330
Somebody's going to have to,

549
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:44.541
well,

550
00:16:44.541 --> 00:16:44.901
you know,

551
00:16:44.901 --> 00:16:46.280
I was saying the other day,

552
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.630
you know,

553
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:52.630
I think second only to cops in suicide comedians might be,

554
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.330
might be number two in this suicide department.

555
00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.670
I'd like to see the rest of the list.

556
00:16:58.730 --> 00:16:59.630
How many comics do you know?

557
00:16:59.631 --> 00:17:00.231
I know Richard.

558
00:17:00.231 --> 00:17:00.920
Jenny,

559
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:01.753
who else?

560
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.121
Oh,

561
00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:02.541
there's been,

562
00:17:02.541 --> 00:17:03.820
well yeah,

563
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.850
I,

564
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:05.661
there's a,

565
00:17:05.661 --> 00:17:09.890
I was just thinking of a hell is that just thinking of Robin Williams course.

566
00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:10.790
Robin Williams.

567
00:17:10.791 --> 00:17:11.570
Yeah.

568
00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:14.180
I'm trying to think of what other profession that there's not as many,

569
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.010
there's a lot more cops than there are comedians.

570
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:16.641
I mean,

571
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:17.870
at least people you've heard of.

572
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:18.260
Right?

573
00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.700
Probably a bunch of people that never made it,

574
00:17:19.701 --> 00:17:20.480
that did it.

575
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.100
But now I've got to find out what happened is skippy.

576
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.593
Yeah,

577
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.420
Jamie.

578
00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.390
We'll Google that skippy from family ties.

579
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.200
We'll see what happens.

580
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:27.441
Yeah.

581
00:17:27.441 --> 00:17:32.441
So I had to go out and like just tough it out and it was like,

582
00:17:33.591 --> 00:17:34.251
it sucked,

583
00:17:34.251 --> 00:17:34.790
you know,

584
00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:35.623
it was humbling,

585
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:36.430
you know?

586
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:36.760
It was,

587
00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:37.160
it was,

588
00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.620
it was interesting.

589
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:40.910
It was tiring.

590
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.590
It was a little depressing,

591
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.620
but it was like mostly scary and humbling.

592
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.330
Well if you got kids,

593
00:17:47.331 --> 00:17:48.650
it's a tricky situation.

594
00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:49.920
Like you've got a good work,

595
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:50.970
you got to get something done.

596
00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.400
He actually did.

597
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.540
When you left your radio show on your radio show got canceled.

598
00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:56.460
Did you have any sort of a severance package or,

599
00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.001
yeah,

600
00:17:57.001 --> 00:17:57.834
the good news,

601
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.230
the good news is I had until the end of the year,

602
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:05.040
so I had like nine and a half months to get paid,

603
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.130
but the clock was ticking and the phone wasn't ringing.

604
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.090
And so I was like,

605
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:14.150
I got to get out there and then at a certain point I just decided I need to take

606
00:18:16.051 --> 00:18:21.051
this guy and tweak them a little bit and make him make him into a movie.

607
00:18:22.171 --> 00:18:27.150
And so we did the crowd funding thing and raise the money that way and blah,

608
00:18:27.151 --> 00:18:27.361
blah,

609
00:18:27.361 --> 00:18:28.194
blah.

610
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.250
It turned out,

611
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:29.550
uh,

612
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.260
the movie's really good actually.

613
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.150
I'm trying to,

614
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.880
I thought I,

615
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.170
did I get it to you or not?

616
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:34.380
Yeah,

617
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.620
I just haven't had a chance to watch it.

618
00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:36.660
I'll watch it this weekend though.

619
00:18:36.661 --> 00:18:37.500
I'm going to Dallas.

620
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:37.921
Oh,

621
00:18:37.921 --> 00:18:38.970
watch a hand road.

622
00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:39.340
Yeah,

623
00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:39.870
you're gonna.

624
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:40.830
You're gonna like it.

625
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:42.283
Yeah.

626
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:44.010
You recognize a lot of the people in it.

627
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:49.320
I've managed to stifle that sort of a boredom on the road.

628
00:18:49.321 --> 00:18:51.150
One of the things I do is I always bring my friends.

629
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.900
I bring a really funny guys that opened for me and to,

630
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.410
uh,

631
00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:55.771
I,

632
00:18:55.771 --> 00:18:56.040
uh,

633
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.720
I'd mix it up a lot with the UFC.

634
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:58.470
Like I travel,

635
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:02.520
like this weekend I'm doing the majestic theater on Friday night in Dallas and

636
00:19:02.521 --> 00:19:04.170
then Saturday night there's a big UFC event.

637
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:05.970
So for me it mixes things up.

638
00:19:05.971 --> 00:19:06.141
I mean,

639
00:19:06.141 --> 00:19:07.020
it's my family,

640
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.220
I missed my home,

641
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.370
but I like all the people that I work with.

642
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.900
I love working for the UFC.

643
00:19:12.901 --> 00:19:13.680
I love doing standup.

644
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:13.980
So it's,

645
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.310
it's,

646
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:17.400
the road is not bad for me and I only do it for like a couple days.

647
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.410
I know guys who go out for like 20,

648
00:19:19.411 --> 00:19:22.680
30 days in a row and you just come back and you're a shell.

649
00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:23.121
You know,

650
00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:26.680
you have to fucking drink orange juice for a month just to get your fucking Eei.

651
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:27.660
I don't lights back.

652
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:27.941
Yeah,

653
00:19:27.941 --> 00:19:28.261
that's,

654
00:19:28.261 --> 00:19:31.260
that's my whole thing is I've just go out for two days,

655
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:34.080
work really hard for like two days and then come back two,

656
00:19:34.081 --> 00:19:34.741
three days.

657
00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:39.600
I try to keep it to that with the family and podcasting and all that stuff.

658
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:40.433
But um,

659
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:41.040
and yeah,

660
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.810
variety and mixing it up.

661
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.250
That's,

662
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:43.620
that's,

663
00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:44.670
that's the other key.

664
00:19:44.671 --> 00:19:45.420
So now,

665
00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.410
half the time,

666
00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:47.490
Nah,

667
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:48.180
now I,

668
00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:48.480
I,

669
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.460
for me it's like seven,

670
00:19:50.461 --> 00:19:52.590
eight at the time I'm just doing a live podcast.

671
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.490
I brought you something.

672
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:54.790
Ooh,

673
00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:55.623
those yours,

674
00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.630
you recognize those reading glasses.

675
00:19:57.631 --> 00:19:58.530
Do you recognize those?

676
00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:58.891
No,

677
00:19:58.891 --> 00:19:59.450
I don't.

678
00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:00.283
You sure?

679
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.110
Yes.

680
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:04.590
I think you left those bitches at my house and like 2009,

681
00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:06.533
uh,

682
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:08.710
I think Lisa Loeb left.

683
00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:13.230
It's your house and 2009 no confused.

684
00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:14.723
Sure.

685
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.900
I'm pretty sure.

686
00:20:15.901 --> 00:20:16.260
Yeah,

687
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.100
they worked for me.

688
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.143
It's weird.

689
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:18.980
I started using them,

690
00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:19.341
but I'm pretty,

691
00:20:19.341 --> 00:20:19.560
I,

692
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.580
it might be yours dude.

693
00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.530
They don't work aesthetically for you,

694
00:20:22.531 --> 00:20:22.981
but no,

695
00:20:22.981 --> 00:20:23.850
they don't work aesthetically.

696
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:24.601
But what they do,

697
00:20:24.601 --> 00:20:25.061
because I,

698
00:20:25.061 --> 00:20:26.700
I liked things like fanny packs.

699
00:20:26.701 --> 00:20:27.690
I like shit that doesn't work.

700
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:28.110
Aesthetic.

701
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.040
Oh my God,

702
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.870
I'm so glad I'm,

703
00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:33.120
I'm looking to get that fanny pack going man.

704
00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:33.540
Listen,

705
00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.410
I've been bringing it back.

706
00:20:34.411 --> 00:20:35.011
I sell them.

707
00:20:35.011 --> 00:20:35.791
I have one for you.

708
00:20:35.791 --> 00:20:36.624
Do we have one form?

709
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.493
Go get him one.

710
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:38.500
Don't real good one.

711
00:20:38.501 --> 00:20:40.660
Don't dangle that pack in front of me unless,

712
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.820
unless I'm taking it home.

713
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.601
Taking it home,

714
00:20:42.601 --> 00:20:43.110
sir.

715
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.040
I've got one for you.

716
00:20:44.041 --> 00:20:44.731
It's leather.

717
00:20:44.731 --> 00:20:45.630
It's a nice routes.

718
00:20:45.631 --> 00:20:46.261
Fanny pack.

719
00:20:46.261 --> 00:20:47.560
Very sturdy construction.

720
00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:48.550
I don't travel without it.

721
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.473
I listen.

722
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:54.570
I just got back from the east coast and it was blue snow in New York.

723
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:56.980
Snow in the whole time.

724
00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.150
Look at that.

725
00:20:58.150 --> 00:20:58.331
Oh,

726
00:20:58.331 --> 00:20:59.200
I'm pumped man.

727
00:20:59.201 --> 00:20:59.770
Look at that.

728
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:00.603
And by the way,

729
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:02.770
this doesn't say,

730
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.071
you know,

731
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:06.310
a lot of fanny packs say not getting laid.

732
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.990
Definitely checking out some comic books on a,

733
00:21:10.991 --> 00:21:11.950
on a Saturday night.

734
00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.080
This says may have a gun

735
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.390
and I liked with,

736
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:20.020
I like with this is projecting to the world a little better than the average

737
00:21:20.021 --> 00:21:20.710
fanny pack.

738
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:21.190
Wow.

739
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:23.200
I sold out of those three times.

740
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:24.550
This is nice.

741
00:21:24.551 --> 00:21:26.980
If you go to higher primate.com I sell those.

742
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:29.830
It's got the higher primate logo in the pocket with a zipper in it.

743
00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:30.664
But that's roots.

744
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:31.361
Wow.

745
00:21:31.361 --> 00:21:32.194
It's really nice.

746
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.340
Well dice clay had one,

747
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.330
he came in and he's got the sweat pants.

748
00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.740
I got the phone and I was like I'm so happy that you wear a fanny pack cause I

749
00:21:38.741 --> 00:21:41.680
wear them all the time and people give me a hard time if you're not trying to

750
00:21:41.681 --> 00:21:42.400
get laid,

751
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.030
it's really the way to go because like convenience wise a like you go to the

752
00:21:46.031 --> 00:21:46.720
airport,

753
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.070
I unstrapped that sucker.

754
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:50.080
I drop it in that Bin and I'm done.

755
00:21:50.081 --> 00:21:52.150
I'm not fishing in my pockets were coins.

756
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:57.180
I just made the proclamation because I just got back from the east coast where

757
00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:02.250
there was a blizzard going on and in New York I said it's so nice wearing a big

758
00:22:02.411 --> 00:22:07.411
jacket with the inside pockets and the flaps and the things like finally I can

759
00:22:08.081 --> 00:22:12.130
put my cell phone and my wallet somewhere cause I'm so tired of the t shirt and

760
00:22:12.131 --> 00:22:13.270
the jeans out here.

761
00:22:13.271 --> 00:22:15.130
Whether you're always sitting on your phone and whatnot.

762
00:22:15.131 --> 00:22:15.550
Like I was,

763
00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.130
I was happy just to be wearing the big Parker that had all the,

764
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:19.023
all the,

765
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:20.260
all the pockets in it,

766
00:22:20.261 --> 00:22:22.420
but that wouldn't work around La.

767
00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.430
They think you're homeless freak.

768
00:22:24.431 --> 00:22:26.260
So now I'm going fanny pack.

769
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:27.191
Yeah,

770
00:22:27.191 --> 00:22:28.024
they love it.

771
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:28.720
I love it.

772
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.530
I'm a big fan.

773
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:29.940
It's just,

774
00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:34.940
it became one of those things that got mocked and guys just abandoned it because

775
00:22:34.961 --> 00:22:36.220
they didn't want to look like losers.

776
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:36.611
But I say,

777
00:22:36.611 --> 00:22:37.330
fuck that.

778
00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:37.481
No,

779
00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:38.314
but this,

780
00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.270
but hold on a second.

781
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.240
This is like a lot more Holtz.

782
00:22:43.241 --> 00:22:45.850
Their holster than it is fanny pack.

783
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.240
I wouldn't be,

784
00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.970
I wouldn't even classify this.

785
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.180
I wouldn't call this a fanny pack roots sells.

786
00:22:52.181 --> 00:22:54.820
It routes the luggage company from Canada,

787
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.890
they don't call it a fanny pack.

788
00:22:56.891 --> 00:22:59.170
They call it like a waste bag or something.

789
00:22:59.171 --> 00:23:00.160
Fucking stupid.

790
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:01.010
Which is,

791
00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:01.420
you know,

792
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.140
yeah,

793
00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:02.470
yeah.

794
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:03.303
But there's a,

795
00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.830
there's a negative connotation to fanny pack.

796
00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.000
Not In my world.

797
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:07.481
All right,

798
00:23:07.481 --> 00:23:08.350
well not with that bed.

799
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.113
I'm excited.

800
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:13.510
So dice clay came in with one of those on and I saw that.

801
00:23:13.511 --> 00:23:13.811
I'm like,

802
00:23:13.811 --> 00:23:17.010
that is a pretty good damn sweet fanny pack and a,

803
00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:17.321
he's like,

804
00:23:17.321 --> 00:23:17.561
yeah,

805
00:23:17.561 --> 00:23:18.394
I love these.

806
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:19.121
I love them.

807
00:23:19.121 --> 00:23:19.601
I'm women,

808
00:23:19.601 --> 00:23:20.470
I'm all the time.

809
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:21.363
Oh.

810
00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:22.450
So I uh,

811
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:23.200
I uh,

812
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.900
contacted roots and had them make one with my logo on it.

813
00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:28.030
I was thinking about dice the other day.

814
00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:32.440
I was thinking who invented him smoking the cigarette from around the backs of

815
00:23:32.441 --> 00:23:34.300
the round rock wrong side of his head.

816
00:23:34.301 --> 00:23:36.370
And then how did that work?

817
00:23:36.371 --> 00:23:41.030
And then who decided that was part of the comedy like this,

818
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.550
it's a weird thing to do.

819
00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.100
Like it's like I,

820
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:50.500
it's a way to stave off lung cancer cause it's like I can barely can't quite,

821
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:55.490
or if I get too fat I can't smoke because I can't get my hand around my back of

822
00:23:55.491 --> 00:23:56.450
my neck areas.

823
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:57.783
Oh,

824
00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:03.980
well he got to a point I think where he was kind of mocking himself.

825
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:04.581
Was that it?

826
00:24:04.581 --> 00:24:04.750
You know,

827
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:05.600
that was a character,

828
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:06.740
but the dental that right?

829
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:07.551
Yeah.

830
00:24:07.551 --> 00:24:07.791
No,

831
00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:08.031
I've,

832
00:24:08.031 --> 00:24:10.610
I've talked to the guy quite a bit about it.

833
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:10.821
No,

834
00:24:10.821 --> 00:24:12.170
he's really just an actor.

835
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:13.010
Well see people don't,

836
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:17.210
his name is Andrew Silverstein and this dice character was one of several

837
00:24:17.211 --> 00:24:18.320
characters that he does.

838
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.251
He did in his act,

839
00:24:19.251 --> 00:24:20.480
he's do John Travolta,

840
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.610
he's do Sylvester Stallone.

841
00:24:22.611 --> 00:24:27.611
When he would do this dice man and the dice man became easily the most popular

842
00:24:27.681 --> 00:24:28.481
part of his Zach.

843
00:24:28.481 --> 00:24:32.540
So then he kind of morphed into being in him and then like everywhere he goes

844
00:24:32.541 --> 00:24:34.190
would dress like the dice man.

845
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.141
Well it's,

846
00:24:35.141 --> 00:24:40.141
it's this weird trap Larry the cable guy stand up.

847
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:40.711
It wasn't,

848
00:24:40.711 --> 00:24:40.860
yeah,

849
00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:45.540
<v 0>getting any traction just became this guy on the radio and Tampa or something.</v>

850
00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:50.370
And next thing you know the club would rather book Larry the cable guy and Dan

851
00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:50.550
Whitney.

852
00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:51.450
Then Dan Whitney.

853
00:24:51.451 --> 00:24:53.700
So they go with Larry the cable guy.

854
00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:55.890
I started off doing Mr Birch,

855
00:24:55.891 --> 00:24:58.530
him the shop teacher out here.

856
00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:03.950
And at a certain point when it came time to take over on Loveline k rock,

857
00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.250
the mother station was like,

858
00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:12.060
we'd like you to host love line is Mr Birch,

859
00:25:12.061 --> 00:25:14.280
him the woodshop teacher.

860
00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.293
And I was like,

861
00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.040
how's that going to work?

862
00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.480
And they were like,

863
00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:19.853
well,

864
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:22.380
we know Mr Bertram is funny,

865
00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:24.510
but we're not sure if you're funding,

866
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.680
which is a weird thing to say to the same guys doing both of them.

867
00:25:28.681 --> 00:25:29.514
But I said,

868
00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:30.601
if I do,

869
00:25:30.601 --> 00:25:31.540
Mr Birch,

870
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:32.110
I'm,

871
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:33.330
I love line.

872
00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.040
I'm going to blow my voice out,

873
00:25:35.041 --> 00:25:36.090
but I'm also,

874
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:37.171
that's just not going to,

875
00:25:37.171 --> 00:25:38.120
why would you pull your voice?

876
00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:38.660
What was the care,

877
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:39.493
how'd it go?

878
00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:40.373
Um,

879
00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:45.570
Mr Birch them was a 60,

880
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:49.320
whatever year old Vietnam veteran who taught,

881
00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:50.483
um,

882
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.290
he taught woodworking.

883
00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:53.400
He taught remedial.

884
00:25:53.401 --> 00:25:56.340
Would a Louie pass your middle school in Monrovia?

885
00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:57.380
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

886
00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:58.670
it's pretty specific.

887
00:25:58.740 --> 00:25:59.573
Yeah.

888
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.710
<v 0>And he hated his kids.</v>

889
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:03.571
He,

890
00:26:03.571 --> 00:26:03.930
he,

891
00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:04.540
he hate,

892
00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.040
he hated all his kids.

893
00:26:06.041 --> 00:26:06.874
And he would,

894
00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.450
every Monday he would call in to Kevin and being,

895
00:26:10.451 --> 00:26:13.060
because he got into another accident in the garage,

896
00:26:13.061 --> 00:26:13.301
you know,

897
00:26:13.301 --> 00:26:14.590
with the band saw or something.

898
00:26:14.591 --> 00:26:16.180
And he wasn't going to be making it in.

899
00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.520
But so you'd say,

900
00:26:18.521 --> 00:26:18.701
well,

901
00:26:18.701 --> 00:26:23.701
why is this guy calling Kevin and being to tell him he's not coming in to do his

902
00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.850
teachers shop class that day?

903
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:33.300
And what I had figured out is that all of his kids who tended to class,

904
00:26:35.681 --> 00:26:36.880
cause it was junior high,

905
00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:38.620
they all listened to k rock.

906
00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:44.160
So he would use k rock is like his own PA system to speak to his kids like at

907
00:26:47.191 --> 00:26:51.090
seven 30 in the morning cause they're all heading in and you know,

908
00:26:51.091 --> 00:26:51.901
he'd be like,

909
00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:52.734
uh,

910
00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:53.653
um,

911
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:55.780
and I listen and I,

912
00:26:55.781 --> 00:26:57.240
and I know you love all the,

913
00:26:57.241 --> 00:27:00.900
the smashing dumplings and Nervosa and all that shit.

914
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:02.850
Got K rock plays,

915
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:03.481
uh,

916
00:27:03.481 --> 00:27:04.314
that Quimby,

917
00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.080
Mr [inaudible] Ponzi is going to be taken over for me today.

918
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.280
So here's the deal.

919
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:09.540
You're all going to show up.

920
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.650
We're going to put blood on the band saw on and then you put your head down and

921
00:27:13.651 --> 00:27:15.600
nobody messes with my drill index.

922
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.730
Nobody messes with my Makita posers.

923
00:27:17.731 --> 00:27:22.731
And then he'd get into like his one student that he liked because all assholes

924
00:27:24.411 --> 00:27:29.411
shop teachers always overcompensate with the one kid and they're like their

925
00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:34.540
total dickheads to 26 kids and super nice to one kid for some fucking reason.

926
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.270
Like Super Douche bags.

927
00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.680
Starlets are super like an incredible with their dog,

928
00:27:40.681 --> 00:27:41.071
you know,

929
00:27:41.071 --> 00:27:43.620
and then super shitty with all the human beings around them.

930
00:27:43.621 --> 00:27:44.160
Right.

931
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.600
It all gets channeled into the one terrier or something.

932
00:27:48.601 --> 00:27:49.620
So He'd go,

933
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:53.850
he's one guy was a Brad Higgins staller and he's like,

934
00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:57.240
Brad been thinking about that Kayak over the weekend.

935
00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.133
Ah,

936
00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:02.050
I don't want to go with a butt joint and I don't want to go with a date.

937
00:28:02.051 --> 00:28:02.580
Oh,

938
00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.080
I don't want to go the rabbit join.

939
00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:04.870
Um,

940
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:05.200
let's,

941
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:05.520
you know,

942
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.050
let's go with a finger joint.

943
00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:07.381
Oh no,

944
00:28:07.381 --> 00:28:08.101
that's go that date.

945
00:28:08.101 --> 00:28:08.651
I'll put the date.

946
00:28:08.651 --> 00:28:08.711
Oh,

947
00:28:08.711 --> 00:28:10.300
set up on the contractor Shaw,

948
00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.340
you know,

949
00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.220
and I just go through all the super specific,

950
00:28:14.221 --> 00:28:16.770
whatever that I knew from home building.

951
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.600
And this guy became this like overnight sensation because they didn't know if Mr

952
00:28:21.601 --> 00:28:24.630
Birch him was a real guy or not.

953
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.470
Cause he,

954
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:26.610
he make a lot of jokes,

955
00:28:26.611 --> 00:28:31.020
but then he'd get super specific with Shit and nobody knew who he was.

956
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:33.960
So then he got so popular,

957
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.540
they wanted him to host love line.

958
00:28:36.541 --> 00:28:38.280
But I was like this,

959
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.320
I ended up doing that show for a decade.

960
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:40.770
Yeah.

961
00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.380
I couldn't do it as Mr Birch him.

962
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.240
So when you came in and you did it as Adam Corolla,

963
00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:45.751
like,

964
00:28:45.751 --> 00:28:46.411
was it like,

965
00:28:46.411 --> 00:28:46.741
boy,

966
00:28:46.741 --> 00:28:47.550
I don't know Adam,

967
00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:49.170
do you think you could do a little Mister Bertram,

968
00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:51.030
you think we can get to like half Mr Birch?

969
00:28:51.031 --> 00:28:51.370
I'm half.

970
00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:53.370
Adam can see you at them.

971
00:28:53.371 --> 00:28:54.860
Could you say Adam and Mr Bertram,

972
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:59.070
could you go like Phil Hendrie style to both voices back and forth?

973
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:01.970
So we wearing a condom.

974
00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:02.221
Hey,

975
00:29:02.221 --> 00:29:03.930
what are you asking about his cock for?

976
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.720
Yeah.

977
00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:06.553
Uh,

978
00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:07.381
I just said,

979
00:29:07.381 --> 00:29:07.900
look,

980
00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:08.733
this is,

981
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.140
this is not going to work.

982
00:29:10.141 --> 00:29:10.921
Big Picture.

983
00:29:10.921 --> 00:29:13.230
Like I could do one episode this way,

984
00:29:13.231 --> 00:29:16.920
but you don't want Mr Birch from two hours a night every night.

985
00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:18.203
And uh,

986
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.840
plus we were just starting syndication.

987
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:27.440
So we're only in one city that kind of knew Mr Birch and then the rest of the

988
00:29:27.951 --> 00:29:29.730
cities didn't know Mr Birch him.

989
00:29:29.731 --> 00:29:30.280
So would,

990
00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.560
it wouldn't have made sense.

991
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:33.060
You would have to start from scratch again.

992
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:34.710
I wouldn't want it to.

993
00:29:34.711 --> 00:29:36.750
So we ended up in over a hundred city.

994
00:29:36.751 --> 00:29:39.330
So that's probably probably best.

995
00:29:39.331 --> 00:29:39.751
But yeah,

996
00:29:39.751 --> 00:29:40.140
that's,

997
00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:40.973
that's how it all,

998
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.700
that's how it all got started

999
00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.240
<v 2>when you started your podcast,</v>

1000
00:29:44.241 --> 00:29:44.781
when you,

1001
00:29:44.781 --> 00:29:45.140
uh,

1002
00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:46.220
I did it like way,

1003
00:29:46.221 --> 00:29:49.100
way back in the day back when you were still sitting on that couch and you had

1004
00:29:49.101 --> 00:29:50.570
to clip on microphones,

1005
00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.793
you went through,

1006
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:56.390
you went through all the different versions of how to set it up sort of the way

1007
00:29:56.391 --> 00:29:57.590
everybody kind of does.

1008
00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:59.360
Like my friend Steve Rinella,

1009
00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.540
he's got this great podcast now and he's doing it.

1010
00:30:02.541 --> 00:30:04.580
He's the host of the show meat eater.

1011
00:30:04.581 --> 00:30:06.410
He's a professional hunter and an author,

1012
00:30:06.411 --> 00:30:08.240
and they're doing a podcast now.

1013
00:30:08.241 --> 00:30:09.320
It's an amazing podcast,

1014
00:30:09.321 --> 00:30:11.810
but they have these headset microphones on,

1015
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:12.610
so they got the,

1016
00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:14.360
the earphones and the microphone on it.

1017
00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.370
And every time someone moves it's clunky.

1018
00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:17.000
Yeah,

1019
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:17.833
right.

1020
00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:19.340
It's fucking maddening.

1021
00:30:19.341 --> 00:30:19.701
And I'm like,

1022
00:30:19.701 --> 00:30:21.140
you can't have the headset,

1023
00:30:21.141 --> 00:30:21.411
Mike.

1024
00:30:21.411 --> 00:30:23.690
You've got to have us a Mike that just sits there.

1025
00:30:23.691 --> 00:30:24.770
Condenser mic.

1026
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:25.550
Yeah.

1027
00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:26.570
The more people touch it,

1028
00:30:26.571 --> 00:30:27.710
the more it's going to suck for.

1029
00:30:27.711 --> 00:30:29.000
If you have ear buds on,

1030
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:30.290
they gotta take my earbuds out.

1031
00:30:30.291 --> 00:30:30.501
I'm like,

1032
00:30:30.501 --> 00:30:30.830
this is,

1033
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:31.730
I'm going to go crazy.

1034
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:32.451
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1035
00:30:32.451 --> 00:30:32.790
I,

1036
00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:33.470
uh,

1037
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.831
God,

1038
00:30:33.831 --> 00:30:38.831
I remember a million years ago when I was doing Bill Simmons podcast from his

1039
00:30:39.501 --> 00:30:40.340
garage,

1040
00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:45.790
he was set up but like only set up with one microphone or that's all they could

1041
00:30:47.121 --> 00:30:47.930
do.

1042
00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:49.880
So I had to call into the show,

1043
00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.530
but I was there.

1044
00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:54.320
So I literally got his phone,

1045
00:30:54.321 --> 00:30:59.321
like his home phone and dialed in and then stood out in the driveway.

1046
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:02.270
That's hilarious.

1047
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:02.481
Well,

1048
00:31:02.481 --> 00:31:05.300
I couldn't call him through the room cause he'd hear me through the mic,

1049
00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:06.770
but fuck it.

1050
00:31:06.771 --> 00:31:07.800
Believed through the mic.

1051
00:31:07.801 --> 00:31:10.520
Kind of the Gardner started coming around with the leaf blower and it's like,

1052
00:31:10.521 --> 00:31:11.630
I'm calling it up,

1053
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:12.873
you know,

1054
00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:14.173
no podcast.

1055
00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:15.080
Yeah,

1056
00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:15.530
no,

1057
00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:16.960
he didn't understand what a podcast was.

1058
00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:17.870
One did back then.

1059
00:31:17.871 --> 00:31:22.160
It was like standing out in his driveway talking on his,

1060
00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:22.571
not,

1061
00:31:22.571 --> 00:31:24.770
not even his cordless,

1062
00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:25.101
you know,

1063
00:31:25.101 --> 00:31:25.760
it's home phone.

1064
00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:26.160
Right.

1065
00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.380
Just the cordless one.

1066
00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:28.243
That's hilarious.

1067
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.730
Yeah.

1068
00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:29.120
Yeah.

1069
00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:29.451
So,

1070
00:31:29.451 --> 00:31:29.810
uh,

1071
00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:30.021
yeah.

1072
00:31:30.021 --> 00:31:32.510
Everyone get some decent equipment,

1073
00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:32.930
please.

1074
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:34.520
What year did you start?

1075
00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:37.160
Uh,

1076
00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:37.971
I started,

1077
00:31:37.971 --> 00:31:38.750
uh,

1078
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:39.530
an oh nine,

1079
00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:39.950
oh nine.

1080
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:40.820
I started at the beginning.

1081
00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.440
I started in February,

1082
00:31:42.441 --> 00:31:42.780
sorry.

1083
00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:43.460
<v 2>Oh No.</v>

1084
00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:44.010
Yeah,

1085
00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:45.270
that's when this started to,

1086
00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:46.650
this started in no nine too,

1087
00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.270
but I started after you,

1088
00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.030
I think I started you and first woman.

1089
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.903
I started it,

1090
00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.980
I was doing it on a Ustream.

1091
00:31:52.981 --> 00:31:55.230
Brian and I were just to sit in front of a,

1092
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:56.610
just the laptop,

1093
00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:57.660
just fucking around.

1094
00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:58.201
It wasn't,

1095
00:31:58.201 --> 00:31:59.700
the idea wasn't to do a podcast.

1096
00:31:59.701 --> 00:32:01.500
The idea was just to fuck around on Ustream.

1097
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.450
Then as we started doing it was like,

1098
00:32:03.451 --> 00:32:03.661
wow,

1099
00:32:03.661 --> 00:32:04.494
this is like,

1100
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:04.921
and then,

1101
00:32:04.921 --> 00:32:06.090
but doing yours.

1102
00:32:06.091 --> 00:32:06.390
I was like,

1103
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:06.691
Ooh.

1104
00:32:06.691 --> 00:32:08.700
Adam's got like a whole garage.

1105
00:32:08.701 --> 00:32:08.881
Like,

1106
00:32:08.881 --> 00:32:09.481
look at this.

1107
00:32:09.481 --> 00:32:10.500
He's got a cool setup.

1108
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:11.400
And then,

1109
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:11.760
um,

1110
00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.890
Anthony [inaudible] from opie and Anthony,

1111
00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.410
he's got some crazy fucking set up in his basement.

1112
00:32:16.411 --> 00:32:20.430
He was like the big inspiration because he had a green screen and a full studio

1113
00:32:20.431 --> 00:32:21.960
with production cameras.

1114
00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:25.200
Just a lot of money in a single guy and Lexa drink.

1115
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:25.891
So he was like,

1116
00:32:25.891 --> 00:32:26.461
fuck this.

1117
00:32:26.461 --> 00:32:28.260
Let's just build a studio in the basement.

1118
00:32:28.261 --> 00:32:29.460
So he built like a full,

1119
00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:30.780
which now he uses,

1120
00:32:30.781 --> 00:32:32.370
cause when he got fired from opie and Anthony,

1121
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.170
he just set up and went online with it and now he has his full online thing with

1122
00:32:37.171 --> 00:32:38.340
the green screen behind him.

1123
00:32:38.341 --> 00:32:40.220
He shows images and videos

1124
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.390
<v 1>and all kinds of crazy shit.</v>

1125
00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:42.261
And then we'll just,

1126
00:32:42.261 --> 00:32:42.620
uh,

1127
00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:43.330
I just did,

1128
00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:45.220
but I just called into a show last,

1129
00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:45.680
uh,

1130
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.401
last week,

1131
00:32:46.401 --> 00:32:48.770
but I just did a Opie's show.

1132
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:52.450
I've just in New York going fucking running in a circle.

1133
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.560
Jesus Christ,

1134
00:32:54.561 --> 00:32:55.394
man,

1135
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:55.821
you,

1136
00:32:55.821 --> 00:32:56.300
uh,

1137
00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.350
you had that lawsuit.

1138
00:32:57.351 --> 00:32:59.120
I don't know how much you want to talk about this if at all.

1139
00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:01.340
But you had that lawsuit with the dude that you started out with.

1140
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:02.900
That all got settled.

1141
00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:04.220
That's all done now.

1142
00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:04.970
Yup.

1143
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:06.810
It's all a year full of lawsuits.

1144
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:07.693
Had the,

1145
00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:10.760
had that had the Pan Turtle,

1146
00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:12.320
the patent thing.

1147
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.170
It was Jesus Christ that wind up costing you money.

1148
00:33:15.171 --> 00:33:15.921
The patent troll thing.

1149
00:33:15.921 --> 00:33:17.330
I know we raised some money for that,

1150
00:33:17.331 --> 00:33:19.100
but how did that work out?

1151
00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.153
<v 0>Um,</v>

1152
00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:21.323
the,

1153
00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:24.870
the bill was over 500 grand.

1154
00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:26.710
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1155
00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:27.610
What the fuck?

1156
00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:29.650
Oh my God.

1157
00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:32.890
Explain what the lawsuit was about cause you if people want to pull their

1158
00:33:32.891 --> 00:33:34.150
fucking hair out in traffic,

1159
00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.830
this is so,

1160
00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:40.990
it's so crazy that someone could actually pull you into court for this.

1161
00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:46.660
<v 0>Well not only pull you into court but pull you into their court in eastern</v>

1162
00:33:47.661 --> 00:33:48.410
Texas.

1163
00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:48.920
Yeah.

1164
00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.820
Where nobody has a podcast and nobody even knows what it is.

1165
00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.760
It's just a nice place to do business for these guys.

1166
00:33:55.761 --> 00:33:58.100
For those guys because of they have creepy laws.

1167
00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.110
Well they have judges,

1168
00:34:00.111 --> 00:34:03.020
they have relationships and you know,

1169
00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:07.640
first off when you just step back and you look at the entire picture,

1170
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.680
who,

1171
00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:10.940
who are the judges?

1172
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.800
Judges aren't,

1173
00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:13.190
you know,

1174
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.300
x fireman,

1175
00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.400
x podcasters,

1176
00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:17.930
you know,

1177
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:19.640
they're not carpenters,

1178
00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:20.810
they're lawyers.

1179
00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:26.650
The judges were lawyers and then the congressmen were judges and lawyers and the

1180
00:34:27.021 --> 00:34:29.000
senators were judges and lawyers.

1181
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:34.450
There's a little good old boys club going on and it's going on in Washington d

1182
00:34:35.081 --> 00:34:35.340
scene.

1183
00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.820
It's going on and,

1184
00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:41.860
and all the places that the tentacles reach out to and it's not there to upset

1185
00:34:41.961 --> 00:34:43.340
their own apple cart.

1186
00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:44.203
You know what I mean?

1187
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:48.890
Like in terms of reform and rules and righting a wrong and all that kind of

1188
00:34:48.891 --> 00:34:49.724
stuff.

1189
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:52.070
How much you want to piss off the guy,

1190
00:34:52.071 --> 00:34:55.010
you're going to cut the country club with this.

1191
00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.320
You'll see him at the country club on Saturday.

1192
00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:57.771
You know,

1193
00:34:57.771 --> 00:34:58.000
it's like,

1194
00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:58.231
it's,

1195
00:34:58.231 --> 00:34:58.920
it's like,

1196
00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.753
you know what it is?

1197
00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.610
It's like divorce attorneys,

1198
00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.110
divorce attorneys.

1199
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:03.561
You Think,

1200
00:35:03.561 --> 00:35:03.711
oh,

1201
00:35:03.711 --> 00:35:06.020
it's your side and his side and they're battling.

1202
00:35:06.021 --> 00:35:06.860
And she said,

1203
00:35:06.861 --> 00:35:07.694
and she said,

1204
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:09.200
not the attorneys.

1205
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:10.513
They love it.

1206
00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:11.803
They're both,

1207
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:14.060
they're basically the relationship.

1208
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:14.930
It's like,

1209
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:15.763
it's like saying,

1210
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:21.290
you know the guys walking through the park with the stick and the nail in the

1211
00:35:21.291 --> 00:35:21.681
end of it,

1212
00:35:21.681 --> 00:35:22.880
picking up garbage,

1213
00:35:22.881 --> 00:35:23.930
picking up trash.

1214
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:26.030
That guy must really hate litters.

1215
00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:26.780
And it's like,

1216
00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:27.021
no,

1217
00:35:27.021 --> 00:35:27.590
he doesn't.

1218
00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:28.080
That's,

1219
00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.270
that's how he has a job.

1220
00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:33.890
The attorneys are the ones that all end up just at the end.

1221
00:35:33.891 --> 00:35:34.161
I mean,

1222
00:35:34.161 --> 00:35:35.150
I've not been divorced,

1223
00:35:35.151 --> 00:35:36.380
but I've certainly heard enough,

1224
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.570
and I talked to Dr Drew's not been divorced,

1225
00:35:39.571 --> 00:35:43.320
but he's heard enough and it's like at the end,

1226
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:46.110
the people that win are both side's attorneys.

1227
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:46.840
They just,

1228
00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.920
they just keep going until everything's cleaned out and they do it on purpose.

1229
00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:51.330
They drag things out.

1230
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.200
It's symbiotic.

1231
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:53.070
And they have the,

1232
00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.020
the pilot fish and the shark or whatever.

1233
00:35:55.021 --> 00:35:55.411
You know,

1234
00:35:55.411 --> 00:35:55.891
you think,

1235
00:35:55.891 --> 00:35:56.101
oh,

1236
00:35:56.101 --> 00:35:56.581
this guy,

1237
00:35:56.581 --> 00:35:57.990
this attorney hates this other turn.

1238
00:35:57.991 --> 00:35:58.141
No,

1239
00:35:58.141 --> 00:35:59.550
he tells him that's how he gets rich.

1240
00:35:59.620 --> 00:35:59.741
<v 2>Well,</v>

1241
00:35:59.741 --> 00:36:00.251
not only that,

1242
00:36:00.251 --> 00:36:02.380
if you're a person who's getting divorced,

1243
00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:03.340
understand this.

1244
00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:05.230
If you're going to go through mediation or whatever,

1245
00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:09.250
even if you get along well with your ex wife and you guys are both like,

1246
00:36:09.251 --> 00:36:09.461
look,

1247
00:36:09.461 --> 00:36:10.181
we love each other,

1248
00:36:10.181 --> 00:36:11.380
but this is not working out.

1249
00:36:11.381 --> 00:36:12.214
Let's just break up.

1250
00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:17.370
The attorneys will try to get your wife to ask for some really unreasonable shit

1251
00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:20.770
so that you can settle on some reasonable shit.

1252
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:23.500
And so you're going to get angry at her unreasonable shit.

1253
00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:23.801
Like,

1254
00:36:23.801 --> 00:36:23.951
no,

1255
00:36:23.951 --> 00:36:26.560
you can't have my fucking collection of,

1256
00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:26.831
you know,

1257
00:36:26.831 --> 00:36:27.664
whatever.

1258
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:28.140
You know,

1259
00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.550
like I know like sugar,

1260
00:36:30.551 --> 00:36:32.830
Shane Mosley had to give up his fucking championship belt.

1261
00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:37.150
He understand that he lost his fucking championship belt to a girl that he used

1262
00:36:37.151 --> 00:36:38.830
to have naked hugs with.

1263
00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:39.490
You know,

1264
00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:42.520
they used to get together and they used to touch each other and make each other

1265
00:36:42.521 --> 00:36:43.150
feel good.

1266
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:44.410
So the judge decided,

1267
00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:44.831
well,

1268
00:36:44.831 --> 00:36:45.251
you know what,

1269
00:36:45.251 --> 00:36:47.950
you need to give up that belt that you got punched in the head for,

1270
00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.900
to this woman that used to touch you.

1271
00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:53.990
I would have gone like Jake lamata before he went to the pawn.

1272
00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:56.530
Chapeau picked out everything out of that belt.

1273
00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:01.560
This her fanny pack was shit any fucking thing to a tree and shot holes in it

1274
00:37:02.261 --> 00:37:03.130
until it was worthless.

1275
00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:03.770
Well,

1276
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:04.041
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1277
00:37:04.041 --> 00:37:04.221
it's,

1278
00:37:04.221 --> 00:37:04.401
you know,

1279
00:37:04.401 --> 00:37:05.930
you know how all this shit starts,

1280
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.350
all that.

1281
00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:08.270
I think all this shit starts like this.

1282
00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:09.403
You know,

1283
00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:10.430
you say,

1284
00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:11.120
look,

1285
00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:13.610
let's just as focused on the kids.

1286
00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:15.410
Let's focus on what's fair.

1287
00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:16.230
Mommy,

1288
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:17.510
daddy shouldn't be arguing.

1289
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.610
Let's not give all the money to the attorneys.

1290
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:21.410
We're both reasonable people.

1291
00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:22.790
And then at some point,

1292
00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:27.500
your ex wife has some country friend who's been through a divorce says,

1293
00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.750
you should just talk to my guy.

1294
00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.700
Just talked to my guy.

1295
00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.400
And then your ex wife says,

1296
00:37:34.401 --> 00:37:34.911
you know what?

1297
00:37:34.911 --> 00:37:36.830
I talked to Joe or I talked to Adam.

1298
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:41.480
We're just going to handle this and try to be reasonable about it and she'll go,

1299
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:42.950
you don't understand.

1300
00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:44.150
You could be burned.

1301
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:47.090
You're going to need to be just meet with him.

1302
00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:47.990
I'm just saying,

1303
00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.030
just meet with him.

1304
00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.320
Just just meet with the guy.

1305
00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:51.981
That's all I'm saying.

1306
00:37:51.981 --> 00:37:52.910
Just talk to the guy.

1307
00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:54.380
Next thing you know,

1308
00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:57.020
she's sitting in an office in century city.

1309
00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:02.470
This guy of course just sees a big old slab of bacon come in his way and he's

1310
00:38:02.721 --> 00:38:02.900
like,

1311
00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:03.733
oh listen,

1312
00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:05.660
he says this and he says that,

1313
00:38:05.661 --> 00:38:07.550
but what about 10 years from now or here?

1314
00:38:07.551 --> 00:38:08.030
You know,

1315
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:09.380
he could agree to do this,

1316
00:38:09.381 --> 00:38:12.050
but if he just agrees to it and you guys just have a handshake,

1317
00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:16.190
he pulled the plug the next day on child support and what bubba alimony,

1318
00:38:16.191 --> 00:38:16.490
Buh Buh,

1319
00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:16.731
Buh.

1320
00:38:16.731 --> 00:38:17.810
And you worked real hard.

1321
00:38:17.811 --> 00:38:20.180
And then next thing you know she's got an attorney.

1322
00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:25.360
Now it's time to lawyer up and now it's time for these two to see how much

1323
00:38:25.701 --> 00:38:29.600
fucking money they can make before you guys go your separate ways.

1324
00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:34.760
Phil Hartman before his wife shot him and then kill herself was going through

1325
00:38:34.761 --> 00:38:35.500
this.

1326
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.160
And uh,

1327
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.260
<v 2>we had a conversation about it where the,</v>

1328
00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.830
he had a really bad relationship with his wife real bad.

1329
00:38:41.831 --> 00:38:43.210
Like she would insult them in public.

1330
00:38:43.211 --> 00:38:45.910
Like they would be at a party and she wanted a shot him the one who shot him.

1331
00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:46.330
Yeah.

1332
00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:47.560
Well I did that math.

1333
00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:48.693
Yeah,

1334
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:49.570
I did the,

1335
00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:50.403
I did the,

1336
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:50.861
I did.

1337
00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:52.720
There was a little friction between the two,

1338
00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.370
some of that,

1339
00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:57.310
a little bit of an issue cause she killed him in his sleep,

1340
00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:58.660
shot him in the head while I was sleeping.

1341
00:38:58.690 --> 00:38:59.950
He said take cough syrup,

1342
00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.440
cough syrup and conk out cause we just so stressed out.

1343
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:03.341
And he had just,

1344
00:39:03.341 --> 00:39:06.890
apparently the story was that he had finally told her that it was,

1345
00:39:06.891 --> 00:39:07.431
this is it,

1346
00:39:07.431 --> 00:39:09.400
this is how I'm going to pull the trigger I'm getting out of here.

1347
00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:10.000
Right.

1348
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.800
And then she shot him when he was sleeping.

1349
00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:12.760
Um,

1350
00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.860
but when he was talking about it,

1351
00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:15.480
I go,

1352
00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:19.810
I was the one who is trying to tell him to get divorced a long time ago.

1353
00:39:19.811 --> 00:39:23.770
Like he had gone through these breakups where he'd moved out and then move back

1354
00:39:23.771 --> 00:39:24.790
in and you know,

1355
00:39:24.791 --> 00:39:26.770
they'd fight like cats and dogs and like,

1356
00:39:26.771 --> 00:39:27.191
fuck this,

1357
00:39:27.191 --> 00:39:27.751
I'm done.

1358
00:39:27.751 --> 00:39:28.190
And uh,

1359
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:29.023
and you know,

1360
00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:30.700
a few people were saying,

1361
00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:30.911
you know,

1362
00:39:30.911 --> 00:39:32.170
you should try to work it out.

1363
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:33.041
And I was like,

1364
00:39:33.041 --> 00:39:33.371
man,

1365
00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:33.911
you got to get,

1366
00:39:33.911 --> 00:39:34.930
she's evil.

1367
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.490
Like this lady's crazy.

1368
00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.190
You can't fix crazy.

1369
00:39:39.191 --> 00:39:39.431
No,

1370
00:39:39.431 --> 00:39:43.300
you can't fix crazy and you can't fix that broken actress thing.

1371
00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:44.551
Do you know the,

1372
00:39:44.551 --> 00:39:47.260
the type of person that desperately wants to be famous?

1373
00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:48.610
And then they're medicated.

1374
00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.020
So she was on Zoloft.

1375
00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:51.910
And then on top of the Zoloft,

1376
00:39:51.911 --> 00:39:52.810
she's doing cocaine,

1377
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:55.000
which literally makes you psychotic.

1378
00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:56.800
They want a settlement through Zoloft.

1379
00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.000
The family want to settlement.

1380
00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:58.450
Oh,

1381
00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:01.150
Raylea Zoloft apparently,

1382
00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:01.481
you know,

1383
00:40:01.481 --> 00:40:02.680
obviously I'm talking about in my ass.

1384
00:40:02.681 --> 00:40:03.311
I'm not a doctor,

1385
00:40:03.311 --> 00:40:04.144
I'm not a scientist.

1386
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:05.320
But the,

1387
00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:05.710
the,

1388
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:09.760
the word from people that have taken it is that if you take Zoloft and you mix

1389
00:40:09.761 --> 00:40:11.260
it with some other chemicals,

1390
00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:13.870
you can just lose your fucking marbles.

1391
00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.790
And one of the big ones is cocaine.

1392
00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:17.920
If you do Zoloft and cocaine together,

1393
00:40:17.921 --> 00:40:19.330
you're just off the rails.

1394
00:40:19.331 --> 00:40:20.111
Fucking crazy.

1395
00:40:20.111 --> 00:40:22.750
And that's when she shot him and then wound up shooting herself.

1396
00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:24.430
But when I was talking to him about it,

1397
00:40:24.431 --> 00:40:24.731
I was like,

1398
00:40:24.731 --> 00:40:24.911
man,

1399
00:40:24.911 --> 00:40:25.510
just get out.

1400
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:26.410
Just give her half.

1401
00:40:26.411 --> 00:40:27.161
Just give her half.

1402
00:40:27.161 --> 00:40:27.910
Fuck it man.

1403
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:28.870
You're going to make more money.

1404
00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:29.830
And he goes,

1405
00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:30.760
that's not half.

1406
00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:31.301
He goes,

1407
00:40:31.301 --> 00:40:32.380
it's a fucking third.

1408
00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:33.430
He goes to third,

1409
00:40:33.431 --> 00:40:34.480
goes to the lawyers,

1410
00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:34.850
right.

1411
00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:36.520
Those two thirds you give to them,

1412
00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:37.690
a lawyer,

1413
00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:38.231
a third,

1414
00:40:38.231 --> 00:40:38.940
the wife gets it.

1415
00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.690
It's a fucking third to the lawyers.

1416
00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:41.591
And he was going,

1417
00:40:41.591 --> 00:40:42.281
he was going crazy,

1418
00:40:42.281 --> 00:40:43.360
but it's a fucking scam.

1419
00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.040
Like you could see his eyes were red,

1420
00:40:45.041 --> 00:40:46.210
his face was sweaty.

1421
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:49.000
And he was just thinking about all the years that this guy,

1422
00:40:49.001 --> 00:40:49.181
I mean,

1423
00:40:49.181 --> 00:40:51.130
he didn't make it like really make it.

1424
00:40:51.131 --> 00:40:53.830
I don't think he got on Saturday night live until he was in his late thirties.

1425
00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:55.660
He was a graphic artist.

1426
00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:56.500
Yeah,

1427
00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.060
he was on peewee's playhouse.

1428
00:40:58.061 --> 00:41:02.710
Peewees you know that TV show that he had and he wrote peewee's big adventure,

1429
00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:04.360
who's one of the writers of that.

1430
00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.040
And Yeah,

1431
00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:09.520
did some albums for like some rock bands and the well just to,

1432
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:10.383
um,

1433
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:11.320
not to,

1434
00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.153
not to,

1435
00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:12.760
you know,

1436
00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:16.090
pull the conversation away from people that are dead or missing.

1437
00:41:16.091 --> 00:41:19.150
Where skippy by the way did you find him?

1438
00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:21.083
Um,

1439
00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:22.383
so

1440
00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:25.370
the,

1441
00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:27.940
the pod cast community along,

1442
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:32.500
especially with guys like Joe got together and we stood up to these guys because

1443
00:41:32.501 --> 00:41:34.310
they know how much litigation

1444
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:35.180
<v 0>costs.</v>

1445
00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:39.710
The problem with the country we're living in is everybody has this thing where

1446
00:41:39.711 --> 00:41:41.540
they go just set,

1447
00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:41.841
you know,

1448
00:41:41.841 --> 00:41:46.841
like I've had people who bought a house for me 10 years ago and are like,

1449
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:49.100
uh,

1450
00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:49.910
hey man,

1451
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:53.750
there's a crack in the foundation and we need 25 grand.

1452
00:41:53.751 --> 00:41:54.410
And you're like,

1453
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:55.040
no,

1454
00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.150
what are you talking about?

1455
00:41:56.151 --> 00:41:56.460
And the,

1456
00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:59.660
and then at some point some lawyers gonna say to you,

1457
00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:02.810
it's a lot cheaper just to give him,

1458
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:03.530
you know,

1459
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:04.910
probably come down to 17,

1460
00:42:04.911 --> 00:42:06.770
five to skim the money.

1461
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:10.430
It's going to be a lot easier than and cheaper by the way then.

1462
00:42:10.431 --> 00:42:10.881
And by the way,

1463
00:42:10.881 --> 00:42:13.730
do you have the time to go down to downtown and sit in the,

1464
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:18.980
it'd be so much easier just to pay that move on and you'll go,

1465
00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.030
but what the fuck?

1466
00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:20.471
I mean,

1467
00:42:20.471 --> 00:42:21.500
I know what they're talking about.

1468
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:21.651
Yeah,

1469
00:42:21.651 --> 00:42:22.011
I know.

1470
00:42:22.011 --> 00:42:22.311
I know,

1471
00:42:22.311 --> 00:42:22.581
I know.

1472
00:42:22.581 --> 00:42:24.800
But it's going to be a lot easier and a lot cheaper.

1473
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:29.780
And so that's what businesses do because businesses or businesses,

1474
00:42:29.781 --> 00:42:30.680
they just want to make money.

1475
00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:32.480
They're not there to take a moral stand.

1476
00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:33.980
This is what I get the hell out of there.

1477
00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.120
Apple gave these pot,

1478
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:36.110
these same guys at sued.

1479
00:42:36.111 --> 00:42:37.250
You gave them millions,

1480
00:42:37.251 --> 00:42:37.900
right?

1481
00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.010
I have something like that.

1482
00:42:40.011 --> 00:42:40.191
Yeah,

1483
00:42:40.191 --> 00:42:40.780
but I don't,

1484
00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:43.460
I think they took them to court and I think they won millions.

1485
00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:45.110
But either way

1486
00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:47.361
I was just like,

1487
00:42:47.361 --> 00:42:48.194
look,

1488
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:53.650
it's not an option for me to cut you a check for 300 500 whatever you're asking

1489
00:42:56.151 --> 00:42:56.571
for that.

1490
00:42:56.571 --> 00:42:57.530
That's not an option.

1491
00:42:57.531 --> 00:42:59.660
So the only option is to stay in fight,

1492
00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:03.590
but the amount of money it costs to stay fight is insane.

1493
00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.020
But $500,000 no.

1494
00:43:06.021 --> 00:43:07.460
Over more.

1495
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:08.180
Yes.

1496
00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:09.370
God Damn it.

1497
00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:14.980
But here's the deal and this is where I think your listeners and my listeners

1498
00:43:16.641 --> 00:43:16.960
and,

1499
00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:17.660
and every,

1500
00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:18.080
every,

1501
00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:18.770
every,

1502
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:19.750
every podcast,

1503
00:43:19.751 --> 00:43:21.980
there's listeners should be proud.

1504
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:27.500
Sony and apple and whoever they're going after and they'll just go,

1505
00:43:27.501 --> 00:43:28.071
whoever,

1506
00:43:28.071 --> 00:43:28.590
whenever,

1507
00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:29.060
doesn't,

1508
00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:29.930
doesn't matter.

1509
00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.550
Paramount doesn't matter.

1510
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:33.140
They don't have a microphone.

1511
00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:33.801
You know,

1512
00:43:33.801 --> 00:43:34.370
they've got,

1513
00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:37.700
they've got millions in the bank and they've got a big corporation,

1514
00:43:37.701 --> 00:43:39.110
but they don't really have a microphone.

1515
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:40.910
We have a microphone.

1516
00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:46.130
So I use my microphone and your microphone,

1517
00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:48.110
Chris Hardwick's microphone.

1518
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:53.470
And we all started talking and they didn't like the talk really.

1519
00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:58.190
And then wanted to talk to stop and to know this specifically from talking to

1520
00:43:58.191 --> 00:43:58.850
them,

1521
00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:00.050
like what did they say?

1522
00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:00.680
Shh.

1523
00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:01.280
Stop,

1524
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:02.061
stop talking.

1525
00:44:02.061 --> 00:44:02.894
Shit.

1526
00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:04.190
Really cause you,

1527
00:44:04.191 --> 00:44:04.431
you,

1528
00:44:04.431 --> 00:44:04.611
you,

1529
00:44:04.611 --> 00:44:06.320
they put some sort of a gag order.

1530
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:07.640
Like it was part of the agreement.

1531
00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:07.870
Like,

1532
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:08.660
well what,

1533
00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.430
what they did is they said,

1534
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.550
what they found was,

1535
00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.133
you know,

1536
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:15.531
and I've,

1537
00:44:15.531 --> 00:44:16.670
I've had this happen,

1538
00:44:16.671 --> 00:44:17.504
but it's like,

1539
00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:18.291
you know,

1540
00:44:18.291 --> 00:44:18.510
it's,

1541
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:19.640
it's this weird thing where it's like,

1542
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:20.361
hey man,

1543
00:44:20.361 --> 00:44:21.680
what's with all the shit talking?

1544
00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:22.370
And it's like,

1545
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:22.821
hey man,

1546
00:44:22.821 --> 00:44:24.080
what's with all the suing?

1547
00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:28.250
Like they were upset talking shit while you have a little decor.

1548
00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:29.271
That's hilarious.

1549
00:44:29.271 --> 00:44:31.950
What we trying to steal money from you still while we sue you,

1550
00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:33.570
I have a microphone.

1551
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:38.630
Explain what the lawsuit was about because it doesn't seem like people that

1552
00:44:39.181 --> 00:44:39.451
don't,

1553
00:44:39.451 --> 00:44:40.740
maybe there's some merit to this.

1554
00:44:40.741 --> 00:44:41.750
Maybe there's a maritime zone.

1555
00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:45.600
It was about something on the Internet in a serialized form.

1556
00:44:45.601 --> 00:44:46.260
It was that.

1557
00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.330
It was unbelievably ridiculous.

1558
00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:50.220
I to this day,

1559
00:44:50.221 --> 00:44:55.221
I couldn't really explain it other than to say if you made a playlist,

1560
00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.490
somehow they had some sort of proprietary technology.

1561
00:44:59.491 --> 00:45:03.720
Have a list or playlist and that's all I know.

1562
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:04.270
That's amazing.

1563
00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:04.831
It's all I know.

1564
00:45:04.831 --> 00:45:06.930
So it's amazing.

1565
00:45:06.931 --> 00:45:11.931
We crowdfunded everything and the whole community got together and I wasn't out.

1566
00:45:14.041 --> 00:45:18.030
We raised enough money to pay the lawyers,

1567
00:45:18.031 --> 00:45:18.940
but what you'll,

1568
00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:19.680
you know,

1569
00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:22.250
the most precious commodity is time.

1570
00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:23.101
You know?

1571
00:45:23.101 --> 00:45:25.050
That's the part you'll never get back,

1572
00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:27.390
but don't you think you got a lot of good publicity for it?

1573
00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:31.260
There was a lot of interest and probably generated a lot of interest towards

1574
00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:32.094
your podcast.

1575
00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:32.990
He,

1576
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.161
yeah,

1577
00:45:33.161 --> 00:45:33.511
I mean,

1578
00:45:33.511 --> 00:45:34.201
I imagine,

1579
00:45:34.201 --> 00:45:34.391
ah,

1580
00:45:34.391 --> 00:45:34.681
you know,

1581
00:45:34.681 --> 00:45:35.640
but I imagine if I have,

1582
00:45:35.641 --> 00:45:36.930
I got no plane crash,

1583
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:39.390
I probably could get some interest too,

1584
00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:43.320
but it's still not the kind of thing I'm going to cross my fingers for.

1585
00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:43.710
Right.

1586
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:44.520
I mean,

1587
00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.353
but it is,

1588
00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.830
it is the kind of thing where it's like,

1589
00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:47.161
yeah,

1590
00:45:47.161 --> 00:45:47.311
yeah,

1591
00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:47.640
there's,

1592
00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:48.540
there's a side where,

1593
00:45:48.541 --> 00:45:48.841
okay,

1594
00:45:48.841 --> 00:45:49.710
you're getting out there,

1595
00:45:49.711 --> 00:45:51.870
you're talking about it and all that,

1596
00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:52.830
and that's fine.

1597
00:45:52.831 --> 00:45:57.831
But it's just this sort of thing where as an atheist with x amount of hours on

1598
00:45:59.251 --> 00:46:00.084
the planet,

1599
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:03.270
reading emails from lawyers,

1600
00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:05.580
from eastern Texas,

1601
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:06.830
it's just not on my,

1602
00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:07.350
you know,

1603
00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:08.790
getting phone calls,

1604
00:46:08.791 --> 00:46:09.151
you know,

1605
00:46:09.151 --> 00:46:11.850
I'm shooting a show for spike and the phone's ringing.

1606
00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:13.530
It's an update out of Texas,

1607
00:46:13.531 --> 00:46:13.831
you know?

1608
00:46:13.831 --> 00:46:14.664
It's like,

1609
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:16.260
I'm trying to do this other thing.

1610
00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:18.930
Did you have to physically go and sit in court in Texas?

1611
00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:20.281
Well,

1612
00:46:20.281 --> 00:46:21.720
that's where,

1613
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:23.010
that's what it was coming too,

1614
00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:24.480
but I didn't get to that point.

1615
00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:30.050
So you've spent $500,000 plus before you even had to get to the actual court in

1616
00:46:30.661 --> 00:46:31.494
Texas.

1617
00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:34.800
If you get to the actual court,

1618
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:37.770
it's probably between one,

1619
00:46:37.771 --> 00:46:39.160
two and one five.

1620
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:43.890
Fuck is wrong with this world a lot.

1621
00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:44.880
Where is that?

1622
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:46.410
Where's that money going?

1623
00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:46.830
Look,

1624
00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:50.010
it's a conversation about a fucking serialized podcast.

1625
00:46:50.011 --> 00:46:55.011
The first 50 grand went to try to get a change of venue because we're not in

1626
00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:59.970
Lubbock or wherever the fuck it was in Texas as a first 50 grand.

1627
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.510
Just got trying to move it to where we are.

1628
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:06.180
That didn't go over very well.

1629
00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:07.230
Wow.

1630
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:08.190
So you get through that,

1631
00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:09.900
then you get sued by your ex partner,

1632
00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:12.770
your ex friend or however that works,

1633
00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:14.760
whatever designation you want to give him.

1634
00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:16.793
Um,

1635
00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.590
how much do you hate the law right now?

1636
00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:21.900
Where are you an anarchist now?

1637
00:47:21.901 --> 00:47:23.160
You were going to go to the other side.

1638
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.960
No,

1639
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:25.500
but I've,

1640
00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:25.950
I've,

1641
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:26.310
I,

1642
00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:28.110
I've realized that

1643
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.010
I was thinking about it and I thought,

1644
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:34.743
you know,

1645
00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:36.310
the,

1646
00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:37.360
the amount of,

1647
00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:39.130
of businesses,

1648
00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:39.730
you know,

1649
00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:40.300
let's,

1650
00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.133
let's just pick a,

1651
00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:41.973
pick a time.

1652
00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:44.200
1952,

1653
00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:48.580
the average business that was semi successful,

1654
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:52.710
or the average person that was semi successful,

1655
00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:58.080
how often do they get sued versus 2015 I don't think there's such a thing is

1656
00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:04.760
being successful in business or,

1657
00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:09.220
or as a personality and not having people coming after you.

1658
00:48:09.221 --> 00:48:10.060
Now I don't think,

1659
00:48:10.061 --> 00:48:12.100
you know how many,

1660
00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:17.130
I'm sure Kanye West is 13 lawsuits going simultaneously along,

1661
00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:19.390
uh,

1662
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:20.051
along with,

1663
00:48:20.051 --> 00:48:20.440
um,

1664
00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:21.970
Chris Brown and whoever else.

1665
00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.430
I don't think a lot of them don't make the light of day,

1666
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:30.270
but I just think there's no such thing as being Pepsi or Coca Cola or Beatrice

1667
00:48:31.901 --> 00:48:32.770
or Nabisco.

1668
00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:37.890
They probably have 47 to 147 lawsuits going all year every year.

1669
00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:44.260
<v 2>So this is like underlying almost economy of people suing to get the settlements</v>

1670
00:48:46.011 --> 00:48:46.530
like the,

1671
00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:46.791
you know,

1672
00:48:46.791 --> 00:48:48.410
the UFC is going through that right now.

1673
00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:50.990
[inaudible] class action lawsuits,

1674
00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:51.501
several,

1675
00:48:51.501 --> 00:48:52.550
four of them at the same time.

1676
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:54.263
X fighters.

1677
00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:54.890
Well,

1678
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:57.470
most of them fighters that weren't that successful,

1679
00:48:57.471 --> 00:48:58.160
like weren't,

1680
00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:00.920
weren't like championship caliber or you know,

1681
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:03.440
got to a point in their career where they realized,

1682
00:49:03.441 --> 00:49:03.771
you know,

1683
00:49:03.771 --> 00:49:04.160
hey,

1684
00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:08.150
I'm not really ever going to get rich off of this and then start suing and

1685
00:49:08.151 --> 00:49:10.970
became a part of this class action lawsuit.

1686
00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:12.410
Four of them that are going on

1687
00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:13.230
<v 0>La.</v>

1688
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:14.063
It,

1689
00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:14.351
it,

1690
00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:14.980
look,

1691
00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:15.280
it's,

1692
00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:17.760
there's a bigger ECE.

1693
00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:18.723
It's all,

1694
00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.050
it's all trickled down

1695
00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:22.060
in the,

1696
00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:23.110
in this sense,

1697
00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:28.360
I've always said there was a time in this country when,

1698
00:49:28.361 --> 00:49:32.910
if you saw a guy driving a brand new Cadillac and you know the,

1699
00:49:32.911 --> 00:49:36.490
that father and son were walking down the street and here comes Mr. Johnson,

1700
00:49:36.491 --> 00:49:39.010
his big black Cadillac going up to the top of the hill.

1701
00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:43.960
There was a time when the father would look at the sun and say,

1702
00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:45.460
you study hard.

1703
00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:46.570
You work hard,

1704
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:47.890
you get it done.

1705
00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:52.510
And one day you can have big shiny Cadillac and live up at the top of the hill.

1706
00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:58.210
Now smash cut to 2015 the sun's looking at the dad going,

1707
00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.130
what the fuck does he have that Cadillac?

1708
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:03.670
And we're driving a III Zuzu trooper.

1709
00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:04.870
This is bullshit.

1710
00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:05.990
Let's go throw a rocket.

1711
00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:10.270
That guy's Cadillac or let's go see what we can get from Mr. Johnson C.

1712
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:10.730
There's tea,

1713
00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:14.800
there's a mentality of you and I have the mentality of,

1714
00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:15.121
and,

1715
00:50:15.121 --> 00:50:18.190
and it's what this country was basically settled on,

1716
00:50:18.191 --> 00:50:20.080
which is go get some for yourself.

1717
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:24.430
We have a larger and larger group looking around going,

1718
00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:25.330
wait a minute,

1719
00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:29.330
what are they doing and can I get some of what they got?

1720
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:30.290
You know,

1721
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:32.450
this whole country is,

1722
00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:35.360
but there's a whole mentality.

1723
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:35.931
I mean,

1724
00:50:35.931 --> 00:50:36.001
it,

1725
00:50:36.001 --> 00:50:36.170
it,

1726
00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:36.411
it's,

1727
00:50:36.411 --> 00:50:38.420
it's trickling down from the government.

1728
00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:39.111
It's,

1729
00:50:39.111 --> 00:50:39.561
it's not,

1730
00:50:39.561 --> 00:50:41.750
it's a sort of a slow poisoning.

1731
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:42.321
You know,

1732
00:50:42.321 --> 00:50:42.501
it's,

1733
00:50:42.501 --> 00:50:42.701
it's,

1734
00:50:42.701 --> 00:50:43.280
it's sort of,

1735
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:43.910
you know,

1736
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:45.350
income inequality.

1737
00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:45.831
Yeah.

1738
00:50:45.831 --> 00:50:47.000
Why does that guy need three?

1739
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:48.800
Joe Rogan's got a bunch of cars.

1740
00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:50.720
You try them all at the same time.

1741
00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:53.360
You can't drive all those cars at the same time.

1742
00:50:53.361 --> 00:50:54.830
I go on vacation house.

1743
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:56.270
You got two houses.

1744
00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:57.163
What?

1745
00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:58.010
How many?

1746
00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:59.720
How many bathrooms in your house?

1747
00:50:59.721 --> 00:51:00.554
Joe Rogan,

1748
00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:05.973
<v 2>you used to have five.</v>

1749
00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:06.660
I got rid of one,

1750
00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:07.410
four,

1751
00:51:07.410 --> 00:51:07.860
four.

1752
00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:09.120
How many assholes do,

1753
00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:11.460
how many assholes do you have a,

1754
00:51:11.461 --> 00:51:11.851
well,

1755
00:51:11.851 --> 00:51:13.470
I live with three other people.

1756
00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:15.840
So you call your kids and why?

1757
00:51:15.841 --> 00:51:18.410
But ansul they have butts.

1758
00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:19.421
What do you need?

1759
00:51:19.421 --> 00:51:23.010
All those bathrooms and cool cars for you don't need all that.

1760
00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:24.480
Yeah,

1761
00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:25.290
so,

1762
00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:26.490
so it should be equal.

1763
00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:27.630
Everybody should it out.

1764
00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:29.980
Well that's what people that don't have anything thing.

1765
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:31.560
They think that everything should be

1766
00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:32.390
<v 0>socialism.</v>

1767
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:34.790
Well also it's like none of your fucking business.

1768
00:51:34.791 --> 00:51:37.010
What I have or what I do,

1769
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:39.350
there's always going to be someone above me.

1770
00:51:39.351 --> 00:51:41.150
There's always going to be people below me.

1771
00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:42.590
And by the way,

1772
00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:44.810
Hey Joe Rogan,

1773
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.610
where are you going to be this weekend?

1774
00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:49.250
Dowse okay.

1775
00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.100
Ask Adam Carolla where he's going to be this week or this weekend.

1776
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:53.420
Portland and Seattle.

1777
00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:55.250
Not On my sofa.

1778
00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:55.880
Right?

1779
00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:57.290
Not with a beer in my hand.

1780
00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.160
Not playing.

1781
00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:58.551
Not throwing.

1782
00:51:58.551 --> 00:51:58.640
Yeah.

1783
00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:00.230
<v 2>Both my kids in the backyard.</v>

1784
00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:02.690
So you're trying to say that people don't have things in this world.

1785
00:52:02.691 --> 00:52:03.411
They don't work hard.

1786
00:52:03.411 --> 00:52:04.160
Adam Corolla.

1787
00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:08.630
Do you not understand that this is a builtin inequality in our system right now

1788
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:10.040
is because of capitalism.

1789
00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.960
And capitalism is the real issue here.

1790
00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:14.090
The people that work and pay for things,

1791
00:52:14.091 --> 00:52:14.780
by the way,

1792
00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:15.591
that's capitalism.

1793
00:52:15.591 --> 00:52:17.140
You fuck people that like you.

1794
00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:19.580
You'd go to the store and you buy food.

1795
00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:20.630
That's capitalism.

1796
00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:21.591
Work for a job.

1797
00:52:21.591 --> 00:52:22.160
They pay you.

1798
00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.420
That's also capitalism.

1799
00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:25.790
Don't say capitalism doesn't work because it's not,

1800
00:52:25.791 --> 00:52:26.541
that's not the issue.

1801
00:52:26.541 --> 00:52:27.980
Just because you're not successful,

1802
00:52:27.981 --> 00:52:29.390
it doesn't mean that capitalism is,

1803
00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:29.991
well,

1804
00:52:29.991 --> 00:52:30.741
they do this shit.

1805
00:52:30.741 --> 00:52:31.690
They go cronyism.

1806
00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:32.091
They go,

1807
00:52:32.091 --> 00:52:32.301
oh,

1808
00:52:32.301 --> 00:52:34.130
you don't think that guy who's

1809
00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:36.790
<v 0>humping dry wall on a construction site.</v>

1810
00:52:36.791 --> 00:52:39.010
You don't say he's not working hard.

1811
00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:40.533
And I'm like,

1812
00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:41.111
yeah,

1813
00:52:41.111 --> 00:52:42.190
he's working hard.

1814
00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:45.130
Everybody historically has worked hard,

1815
00:52:45.131 --> 00:52:46.810
but he's not working smart.

1816
00:52:47.110 --> 00:52:50.830
He's not doing what he's got to do to get the extra car

1817
00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:53.610
<v 2>I have because I used to carry the drywall.</v>

1818
00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:53.821
Yeah,

1819
00:52:53.821 --> 00:52:54.061
I did.

1820
00:52:54.061 --> 00:52:54.370
Now,

1821
00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:55.203
now I don't,

1822
00:52:55.210 --> 00:52:55.601
and by the way,

1823
00:52:55.601 --> 00:52:56.650
he doesn't have to do that.

1824
00:52:56.830 --> 00:52:57.700
He could do other things.

1825
00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:57.940
If you,

1826
00:52:57.940 --> 00:52:59.440
if you think that job is too hard,

1827
00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:00.401
you don't have to do it.

1828
00:53:00.401 --> 00:53:01.390
Nobody is forcing you to do it.

1829
00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:04.540
And if you do do it temporarily and you don't enjoy the hard labor,

1830
00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:06.310
find another way.

1831
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:07.570
There's other ways to do it.

1832
00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:09.610
But this idea that somehow or another,

1833
00:53:09.611 --> 00:53:13.480
everything's supposed to be equal is fucking unbelievably ridiculous because

1834
00:53:13.481 --> 00:53:14.590
there's no equality.

1835
00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:17.110
There's no equality in this world when it comes to look.

1836
00:53:17.111 --> 00:53:19.000
Some people speak five languages.

1837
00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:19.893
You don't,

1838
00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:21.250
if you don't speak five languages,

1839
00:53:21.251 --> 00:53:22.210
you're not fucking equal.

1840
00:53:22.270 --> 00:53:22.840
That guy.

1841
00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:23.980
If that guy goes to France,

1842
00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:25.000
he can communicate.

1843
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.030
There's no equality in that.

1844
00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:30.570
It's no like how come these French people don't just accept my language?

1845
00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:32.100
It doesn't work like that.

1846
00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:33.060
You have to work hard.

1847
00:53:33.061 --> 00:53:35.160
If you want to learn how to speak five fucking languages,

1848
00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:39.680
like the amount of effort you put in is directly proportionate to the,

1849
00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:39.920
the,

1850
00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:41.580
the reward you get out of it.

1851
00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:43.160
Or if you do it intelligently,

1852
00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:44.110
<v 0>it's the right.</v>

1853
00:53:44.110 --> 00:53:46.990
But what the people would say,

1854
00:53:47.110 --> 00:53:52.110
who we vehemently disagree with is that guy on the construction site can't get

1855
00:53:55.210 --> 00:53:59.410
to the next level and can't get off that construction site because his dad

1856
00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:04.600
carried dry wall and he's poor and he's a product of the system and he's a

1857
00:54:04.661 --> 00:54:06.760
product of the education around him.

1858
00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:08.650
And he's a product of that environment,

1859
00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:13.930
which may not help as obviously much better.

1860
00:54:14.290 --> 00:54:14.860
You know,

1861
00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:19.860
Dr Drew's dad was a physician and it definitely helped Dr drew become a

1862
00:54:20.291 --> 00:54:21.124
physician.

1863
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:25.690
But my dad didn't do shit and I got more money than doctor.

1864
00:54:25.691 --> 00:54:26.524
True.

1865
00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:29.770
So what math shall we do here?

1866
00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:30.191
<v 2>Well,</v>

1867
00:54:30.191 --> 00:54:30.461
you,

1868
00:54:30.461 --> 00:54:30.950
you,

1869
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:31.390
you know,

1870
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:32.890
people figure things out.

1871
00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:35.560
There's a lot of people that figure things out in this world.

1872
00:54:35.561 --> 00:54:40.120
They figure out a way and some people don't figure it out.

1873
00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:42.820
And that's the same with playing games.

1874
00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:45.400
Like there's some people that are really good at playing chess.

1875
00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:46.810
Why are they really good at playing chess?

1876
00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:47.111
Well,

1877
00:54:47.111 --> 00:54:49.750
they study it and they figure it out and they get better at it.

1878
00:54:49.930 --> 00:54:51.790
And then other people fucking suck at it.

1879
00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:53.590
But they're also playing chess,

1880
00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:55.780
but they're playing chess and they're not thinking ahead.

1881
00:54:55.781 --> 00:54:56.531
They're not focusing,

1882
00:54:56.531 --> 00:54:57.460
they're not concentrating.

1883
00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:00.760
They might be distracted while they're playing that chess life.

1884
00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:02.470
When it comes to capitalism,

1885
00:55:02.471 --> 00:55:02.861
when it comes to,

1886
00:55:02.861 --> 00:55:05.170
I mean for forget capitalism when it comes to trying to,

1887
00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:06.183
let's use that,

1888
00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:06.881
that phrase,

1889
00:55:06.881 --> 00:55:07.714
get ahead.

1890
00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:08.693
That they get,

1891
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:09.543
it's a game.

1892
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:10.503
It's a game.

1893
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:12.370
And what you decide to do,

1894
00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:16.330
whether you decide to build houses or you decide to make paintings or you

1895
00:55:16.331 --> 00:55:17.530
decided to fix cars,

1896
00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:19.480
wherever the fuck you decide to do,

1897
00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:21.400
you're essentially playing a game.

1898
00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:22.600
The game is,

1899
00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:25.690
I will try to get really good at this and hopefully I'll get some money along

1900
00:55:25.691 --> 00:55:26.260
the way.

1901
00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:28.480
And if you do not play the game and you saw it,

1902
00:55:28.481 --> 00:55:31.090
I'm just going to stick to this whole digging thing.

1903
00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.050
And uh,

1904
00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:33.460
why don't have a Cadillac?

1905
00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:34.121
I'm not,

1906
00:55:34.121 --> 00:55:35.090
I'm fucking digging this thing.

1907
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:36.550
I'm working all day,

1908
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:38.120
<v 0>but by the way,</v>

1909
00:55:38.121 --> 00:55:43.010
what if first off and then the next thing they do is,

1910
00:55:43.011 --> 00:55:44.330
the next thing out of their mouth is,

1911
00:55:44.331 --> 00:55:44.541
you know,

1912
00:55:44.541 --> 00:55:45.770
money doesn't buy happiness,

1913
00:55:45.771 --> 00:55:46.280
don't ya?

1914
00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:46.611
It's like,

1915
00:55:46.611 --> 00:55:46.911
good.

1916
00:55:46.911 --> 00:55:47.960
Then shut the fuck up.

1917
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:51.980
Have Funding Your Zuzu trooper like okay,

1918
00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:54.460
then why are we saying look,

1919
00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:55.940
you have a family.

1920
00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:56.960
You know,

1921
00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:58.130
when I was poor,

1922
00:55:59.390 --> 00:56:00.890
I fucked hot chicks.

1923
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:01.783
Did you really?

1924
00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:02.420
Yeah.

1925
00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:02.720
Wow.

1926
00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:05.440
Well not supermodels and you know,

1927
00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:07.450
there were little uh,

1928
00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:12.080
refractory periods would go on sometimes months on end.

1929
00:56:12.110 --> 00:56:13.190
But yeah,

1930
00:56:13.191 --> 00:56:14.180
I drank beer,

1931
00:56:14.181 --> 00:56:15.014
I fucked,

1932
00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:16.273
I ate out.

1933
00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:18.230
I had fun when you were poor.

1934
00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:18.750
Yeah.

1935
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:20.360
I always had a different kind of fun.

1936
00:56:20.361 --> 00:56:23.020
It was light enough children back then to know it's like get in,

1937
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:23.831
are kind of fun.

1938
00:56:23.831 --> 00:56:24.010
Was

1939
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.410
<v 1>getting the back of a F-150 pickup.</v>

1940
00:56:26.411 --> 00:56:30.490
We're going to Baja and we're going to buy some roadside fireworks and shoot

1941
00:56:30.491 --> 00:56:34.510
them off throughout the back of the pickup truck and camp on the beach and surf

1942
00:56:34.511 --> 00:56:35.530
naked and you know,

1943
00:56:35.531 --> 00:56:38.830
that could start a bonfire and drink mezcal Tequila.

1944
00:56:38.831 --> 00:56:39.910
It didn't cost anything.

1945
00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:40.510
I like it,

1946
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:41.590
but it was still fun.

1947
00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:42.310
Yeah.

1948
00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:44.080
I mean half the Shit I did,

1949
00:56:44.081 --> 00:56:44.501
you know,

1950
00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:46.060
I was in costs,

1951
00:56:46.061 --> 00:56:47.230
anything we just had fun.

1952
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:47.651
Yeah.

1953
00:56:47.651 --> 00:56:49.420
Money does not buy happiness.

1954
00:56:49.421 --> 00:56:50.171
It's absolutely true.

1955
00:56:50.171 --> 00:56:54.610
And there's a lot of people that only focus on money and they wind up being rich

1956
00:56:54.611 --> 00:56:56.230
and miserable and that is a fact.

1957
00:56:56.470 --> 00:57:00.820
But that doesn't mean that you can't get freedom from money.

1958
00:57:00.821 --> 00:57:03.790
That relieves pressure and that's where people are mistaken.

1959
00:57:03.791 --> 00:57:05.290
This idea that it's one or the other,

1960
00:57:05.291 --> 00:57:06.190
it's either or.

1961
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:10.090
Either you are enjoying your life as a poor person and you're happy and

1962
00:57:10.091 --> 00:57:15.091
wonderful and loving or you're a wealthy mizer who fucking hates his life and

1963
00:57:15.401 --> 00:57:19.450
lives in depression and drink himself to death or it takes pills to afford

1964
00:57:19.451 --> 00:57:20.200
reality.

1965
00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:21.190
That's not true either.

1966
00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:22.520
Like you what,

1967
00:57:22.521 --> 00:57:22.840
what,

1968
00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:26.170
what money does do the big thing that it did for me when I,

1969
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:28.260
when I first got my first developed,

1970
00:57:28.261 --> 00:57:29.440
I got one of those development deals.

1971
00:57:29.441 --> 00:57:30.880
I got a few of those back in the day,

1972
00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:32.590
but I got one before the fucking,

1973
00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:34.660
the water ran out and uh,

1974
00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.760
all of a sudden I didn't worry about my bills.

1975
00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:37.751
All of a sudden,

1976
00:57:37.751 --> 00:57:39.970
all of a sudden I had this huge feet,

1977
00:57:39.971 --> 00:57:41.760
like a physical feeling of like,

1978
00:57:41.790 --> 00:57:43.570
like you have a different workout with a weight vest.

1979
00:57:44.350 --> 00:57:45.670
I like working out with weight vests.

1980
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:48.010
I like doing weighted fanny pack.

1981
00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:50.110
That's good to my new thing.

1982
00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:51.400
Um,

1983
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:54.150
the thing about a weight vest is you take that sucker off and he's,

1984
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.760
ah,

1985
00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:55.660
he feels so good.

1986
00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:56.380
Yeah.

1987
00:57:56.380 --> 00:57:59.560
And that's how I felt when I first got my first check.

1988
00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:00.371
I was like,

1989
00:58:00.371 --> 00:58:00.671
wow,

1990
00:58:00.671 --> 00:58:03.040
now I know that I can pay my rent this month.

1991
00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:07.150
Now I know that I could go to dinner and I can order what I want to order

1992
00:58:07.151 --> 00:58:07.751
instead of order.

1993
00:58:07.751 --> 00:58:09.220
Like the cheapest thing on the menu.

1994
00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:09.491
Yeah.

1995
00:58:09.491 --> 00:58:10.810
I always tell people it doesn't,

1996
00:58:11.290 --> 00:58:12.820
it doesn't make you happy.

1997
00:58:12.850 --> 00:58:13.330
It,

1998
00:58:13.330 --> 00:58:17.350
what it does is it stops you from worrying about shit that makes you unhappy.

1999
00:58:17.351 --> 00:58:17.951
Yes.

2000
00:58:17.951 --> 00:58:18.430
Like,

2001
00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:19.180
yes.

2002
00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:21.730
A parking ticket would ruin my week.

2003
00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:22.931
I mean,

2004
00:58:22.931 --> 00:58:27.931
I remember getting 60 bucks out of the ATM once and leaving it into the a and

2005
00:58:28.891 --> 00:58:31.900
the ATM and then coming back 10 minutes later and it was gone and I was like

2006
00:58:31.901 --> 00:58:35.410
devastated for the entire weekend because I was at the 60 bucks.

2007
00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:35.930
Right,

2008
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:36.280
right.

2009
00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:39.280
Little Shit like that just fucks you up.

2010
00:58:39.281 --> 00:58:40.114
You know,

2011
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:41.201
there's always the,

2012
00:58:41.201 --> 00:58:43.810
you know when you're going out to eat and it's like,

2013
00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:45.310
should you,

2014
00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:46.600
should you order a cocktail?

2015
00:58:46.601 --> 00:58:47.890
She'd order glass wine.

2016
00:58:47.891 --> 00:58:48.940
It's going to be eight bucks.

2017
00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:50.440
More like don't do it.

2018
00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:51.190
Yeah.

2019
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.820
Yeah.

2020
00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:53.320
He already ordered an appetizer.

2021
00:58:53.321 --> 00:58:54.220
Don't get greedy.

2022
00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:58.300
And is the thinking to the resources that are required to constantly be thinking

2023
00:58:58.301 --> 00:58:59.134
about your bills?

2024
00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:01.270
Like when I was a broke comedian,

2025
00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:05.290
I remember just always wondering like how it was going to pay for this.

2026
00:59:05.291 --> 00:59:05.530
Like,

2027
00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:05.831
oh,

2028
00:59:05.831 --> 00:59:06.670
this is coming up,

2029
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.210
this goddamn bill is going to be on the 15th and I don't have that money.

2030
00:59:10.211 --> 00:59:13.390
And I got to figure out that money and making phone calls and trying to get gigs

2031
00:59:13.391 --> 00:59:15.610
and trying to figure out how to pay that bill.

2032
00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:17.050
All that goes away,

2033
00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:20.890
but the whole point is you never looked around and went,

2034
00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:23.150
who can do this for me now?

2035
00:59:23.151 --> 00:59:26.750
You just found a mirror and when I got to get after it a little harder.

2036
00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:27.051
Yeah,

2037
00:59:27.051 --> 00:59:28.340
you can't think like that.

2038
00:59:28.341 --> 00:59:28.701
That's a,

2039
00:59:28.701 --> 00:59:29.360
that's a,

2040
00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:30.170
that's a trap.

2041
00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:30.351
The,

2042
00:59:30.351 --> 00:59:35.210
don't you think when we're constantly hitting everyone over the head,

2043
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:39.590
I can't stand when I hear the politicians go.

2044
00:59:39.591 --> 00:59:41.360
It's not a level playing field.

2045
00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:43.730
I'd like to tell you it was a level playing field,

2046
00:59:43.731 --> 00:59:44.690
but it's just not,

2047
00:59:44.810 --> 00:59:44.961
well,

2048
00:59:44.961 --> 00:59:46.220
it's not neither his life.

2049
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:47.720
Can you see a beautiful woman?

2050
00:59:47.970 --> 00:59:51.560
We see a beautiful woman and then you see some woman with unfortunate genetics.

2051
00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:53.270
What the fuck did that beautiful woman did?

2052
00:59:53.271 --> 00:59:54.020
She earned that.

2053
00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:54.470
No,

2054
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:55.260
this is not,

2055
00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:56.210
this is not even,

2056
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:57.390
it's not even that good.

2057
00:59:57.410 --> 01:00:00.200
Some women are born with perfect bone structure and that's just,

2058
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:03.410
that is just something you're going to have to deal with in this life.

2059
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:03.741
You know,

2060
01:00:03.741 --> 01:00:04.580
I'm five foot eight.

2061
01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:05.091
If,

2062
01:00:05.091 --> 01:00:05.841
what if I was a,

2063
01:00:05.841 --> 01:00:07.340
what if I love playing basketball?

2064
01:00:07.341 --> 01:00:09.050
What if I wished I was seven feet tall?

2065
01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:09.890
You know,

2066
01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:12.650
I've met giant basketball players and I'm like fuck.

2067
01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:14.090
Like this is not even,

2068
01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:14.953
this is not,

2069
01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:19.160
we're not born with the same chips where the same deck of cards.

2070
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:20.510
We're just not how,

2071
01:00:20.511 --> 01:00:21.231
by the way,

2072
01:00:21.231 --> 01:00:22.250
could you ever,

2073
01:00:22.251 --> 01:00:24.470
and then how's the government going to figure that out?

2074
01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:25.221
And Yeah,

2075
01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:29.450
you can make the school system is even as you can and you can make the law is

2076
01:00:29.451 --> 01:00:30.470
even as you can.

2077
01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:35.000
But the chick who six one who has got the,

2078
01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:35.301
you know,

2079
01:00:35.301 --> 01:00:40.301
it looks like Heidi Clume still going to have a quite quiet,

2080
01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:41.600
you know,

2081
01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.340
client advantage over Alex Borstein.

2082
01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:43.881
Yeah,

2083
01:00:43.881 --> 01:00:45.020
there's no way around that.

2084
01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:49.430
But the Alex Borstein and she's a dear friend.

2085
01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:50.870
I don't even know who that is.

2086
01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:51.913
Okay.

2087
01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:53.121
She does.

2088
01:00:53.121 --> 01:00:53.954
Let's see.

2089
01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:55.490
Living color.

2090
01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:55.971
Oh,

2091
01:00:55.971 --> 01:00:56.920
she's not living color.

2092
01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:57.430
Uh,

2093
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:58.041
the Fox.

2094
01:00:58.041 --> 01:00:59.240
A telephonic shows.

2095
01:00:59.480 --> 01:00:59.830
Okay.

2096
01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:00.410
Yeah.

2097
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:03.110
You'll know she the lowest on I get a family.

2098
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:04.880
Let's go with the blossom.

2099
01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:06.050
Oh,

2100
01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:06.690
from blossom.

2101
01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:07.550
Who was on the Big Bang?

2102
01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.150
Maya?

2103
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.610
My Mba.

2104
01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:10.130
Alec forcing is better,

2105
01:01:10.131 --> 01:01:10.650
but all right.

2106
01:01:10.650 --> 01:01:11.350
All right.

2107
01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:12.050
The point is,

2108
01:01:12.050 --> 01:01:12.883
well,

2109
01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:14.241
you should know she is,

2110
01:01:14.241 --> 01:01:15.080
you work in this business.

2111
01:01:15.081 --> 01:01:15.321
I know.

2112
01:01:15.321 --> 01:01:15.920
Barely.

2113
01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:20.920
The point is this because she doesn't look like Ooma Thurman.

2114
01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:26.440
She went to work hard developing a bunch of other skills other than looking good

2115
01:01:27.831 --> 01:01:31.190
on a Saturday night and now makes a nice living.

2116
01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:32.383
Right.

2117
01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:33.253
That's fine.

2118
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:35.890
That's fine that it's,

2119
01:01:35.891 --> 01:01:36.980
it's the way it should be.

2120
01:01:36.981 --> 01:01:41.981
It's just let's not convince that person that they can't do anything.

2121
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:46.580
Let's just say you won't be doing any runway or catalog work and,

2122
01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:47.090
but there's others,

2123
01:01:47.090 --> 01:01:48.440
but you can do a lot of voiceovers.

2124
01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:52.790
The what if the government comes along and figures out a way to turn everybody

2125
01:01:52.791 --> 01:01:55.670
into whom Thurman would if they cut and then people like,

2126
01:01:55.671 --> 01:01:55.881
you know,

2127
01:01:55.881 --> 01:01:59.780
the government should be making you look like Guma Thurman and here you are who

2128
01:01:59.781 --> 01:02:01.850
you are stuck with this normal body.

2129
01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.010
There's Heidi Klum running around out there.

2130
01:02:04.011 --> 01:02:07.730
Why isn't the government put resources to turn you into Ooma Thurman and create

2131
01:02:07.731 --> 01:02:09.590
jobs while they're at it this second?

2132
01:02:09.591 --> 01:02:10.550
By the way,

2133
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:13.430
everyone becomes Ooma Thurman,

2134
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:15.440
Huma Thurman becomes a five

2135
01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.010
guys would adjust.

2136
01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.753
Hmm.

2137
01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:21.091
Yeah.

2138
01:02:21.091 --> 01:02:21.631
That would be something.

2139
01:02:21.631 --> 01:02:23.850
Maybe it was really fun.

2140
01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:28.380
First six months and then she'd come down to a five.

2141
01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:28.561
Well,

2142
01:02:28.561 --> 01:02:30.090
don't you think that's going to happen anyway?

2143
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:33.750
I'm 100% convinced that we're going to be able to manipulate people's bodies to

2144
01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:36.690
the point where within a hundred years we're going to be able to create,

2145
01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.170
you know,

2146
01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:37.921
whatever you want.

2147
01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:40.830
You could look like the thing from fantastic four,

2148
01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.900
you know they're going to be able to do things to your body.

2149
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.230
W W people are already doing weird body modifications,

2150
01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:46.651
you know,

2151
01:02:46.651 --> 01:02:49.940
putting like bolts in their heads and cutting the tips of their fucking noses

2152
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:53.010
off and weird shit just to look weird and interesting.

2153
01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:57.680
Tattooing their face up and get Bruce Jenner or something about the tip people

2154
01:02:57.681 --> 01:02:58.990
who are doing a lot of weird shit right now.

2155
01:02:59.080 --> 01:02:59.913
So listen,

2156
01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:00.510
look,

2157
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:05.510
if you can go from Wheaties box to just brand new box,

2158
01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:13.200
you can do anything.

2159
01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:18.230
We can do anything because there's no greater chasm between Wheaties box and

2160
01:03:18.481 --> 01:03:20.820
freshly minted box and old woman.

2161
01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:22.310
It's very or no me,

2162
01:03:22.311 --> 01:03:23.640
an old woman to difference.

2163
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:24.061
Not Wait.

2164
01:03:24.061 --> 01:03:25.290
What happened to skipping now?

2165
01:03:25.291 --> 01:03:25.710
Now,

2166
01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:28.650
now we know to know he was on some show recently.

2167
01:03:28.651 --> 01:03:29.550
He's out there alive.

2168
01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:31.050
He's still doing standup boy.

2169
01:03:31.051 --> 01:03:32.010
He looks like he drinks.

2170
01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.310
Look at that face.

2171
01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:36.300
What is skipping TV for stand up?

2172
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.811
Um,

2173
01:03:36.811 --> 01:03:38.640
I don't think that's exactly what's going on.

2174
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:41.490
Previously known as skippy from family ties.

2175
01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.360
When you say skipping TV that he's been skipping it for 20 years.

2176
01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:47.730
Making waves as a comic.

2177
01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:47.911
Oh,

2178
01:03:47.911 --> 01:03:52.120
this is like one of those weird like local newspapers bullshits down.

2179
01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:56.460
Even so he was a contestant on last comic standing in 2006 no,

2180
01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:56.670
right.

2181
01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:58.920
Well at least he didn't go to the woods and kill himself.

2182
01:03:58.921 --> 01:03:59.460
That's all.

2183
01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:00.390
That's all I'm saying.

2184
01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:00.811
It's out there.

2185
01:04:00.811 --> 01:04:01.410
Hoofing it.

2186
01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:02.910
So back to my movie Joe.

2187
01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:03.301
Yeah.

2188
01:04:03.301 --> 01:04:06.870
Back to your moving the government creating jobs for you.

2189
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:08.880
Giving you a movie deal.

2190
01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:09.351
You,

2191
01:04:09.351 --> 01:04:11.850
you know why don't other people don't have a movie Adam Carolla.

2192
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:12.150
Yeah.

2193
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:13.190
Why do I come to make it?

2194
01:04:13.191 --> 01:04:14.340
Why do you get to make a movie?

2195
01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:15.660
Because I raised the money.

2196
01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:15.871
No,

2197
01:04:15.871 --> 01:04:15.940
no,

2198
01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:16.111
no,

2199
01:04:16.111 --> 01:04:16.260
no,

2200
01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:16.501
no.

2201
01:04:16.501 --> 01:04:18.840
Because your white privilege to cause your CIS gender.

2202
01:04:18.841 --> 01:04:21.690
White privileged shitlord out there.

2203
01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:26.550
I should have back when I was cleaning up garbage on the construction side,

2204
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:29.220
I should have played the white privilege card.

2205
01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:30.270
We're still white privileged.

2206
01:04:30.271 --> 01:04:33.420
Even back then the other Mexicans that you were working with back then clean up

2207
01:04:33.421 --> 01:04:33.720
garbage.

2208
01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:34.553
Where are they now?

2209
01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:37.230
I'll tell you why they aren't where they are because they didn't have the white

2210
01:04:37.231 --> 01:04:37.890
privilege.

2211
01:04:37.890 --> 01:04:38.220
Uh,

2212
01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:38.850
that's right.

2213
01:04:38.850 --> 01:04:40.740
There weren't systems certain point.

2214
01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:41.401
I remember,

2215
01:04:41.401 --> 01:04:46.401
well it was like 1985 I was picking up garbage on a construction site in Granada

2216
01:04:47.431 --> 01:04:52.431
hills and helicopter landed and Donald Trump got out and he like you,

2217
01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.490
you're white.

2218
01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:53.940
It's amazing.

2219
01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:55.290
Get in here right now.

2220
01:04:55.650 --> 01:04:56.880
What do you think you're doing?

2221
01:04:57.150 --> 01:05:00.060
And we jumped in a helicopter with retractable landing gear.

2222
01:05:00.061 --> 01:05:00.391
By the way,

2223
01:05:00.391 --> 01:05:01.950
that's how you really know you've arrived.

2224
01:05:01.951 --> 01:05:05.610
When we flew right to Trump tower and he gave me an ascot,

2225
01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:06.930
and from that day on,

2226
01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.490
I didn't know about white privilege.

2227
01:05:08.491 --> 01:05:11.160
Evidently he'd been keeping tabs on me the whole time.

2228
01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:11.760
That's nice.

2229
01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:14.580
And that he was able to then give me the money to make road heart.

2230
01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.230
He got in with the cronies.

2231
01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:17.261
Yeah.

2232
01:05:17.261 --> 01:05:18.130
That's what happens.

2233
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:19.031
People,

2234
01:05:19.031 --> 01:05:21.520
we all conspire together to keep white people rich.

2235
01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:22.250
He,

2236
01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:24.190
while nobody sues white people more than white people.

2237
01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:24.730
Right.

2238
01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:25.450
That's true.

2239
01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:26.410
Being sued by white people,

2240
01:05:26.411 --> 01:05:27.160
I'm sure.

2241
01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:27.640
Ah,

2242
01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:28.210
I would,

2243
01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:29.043
I would say,

2244
01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:30.700
I would say white people are the,

2245
01:05:30.701 --> 01:05:31.210
uh,

2246
01:05:31.210 --> 01:05:32.740
do the lion's share,

2247
01:05:32.741 --> 01:05:34.870
the white lion share of the ceiling?

2248
01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:35.291
Yeah.

2249
01:05:35.291 --> 01:05:36.640
It's a lot of white on white.

2250
01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:38.260
It's a little more blue collar.

2251
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:40.200
We like to keep it a little more blue car.

2252
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:42.880
We don't like to see our victims mostly through email.

2253
01:05:42.881 --> 01:05:44.860
But does the people that we're suing you?

2254
01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:45.950
No,

2255
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:46.630
no,

2256
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:47.463
no.

2257
01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:48.460
They just got,

2258
01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:49.600
they got tired.

2259
01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:50.860
But did you know their names?

2260
01:05:51.470 --> 01:05:52.040
No.

2261
01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:52.873
No.

2262
01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:53.831
I'm a,

2263
01:05:53.831 --> 01:05:54.390
you know,

2264
01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:54.620
uh,

2265
01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:57.790
they didn't like you talking shit about their corporation,

2266
01:05:57.791 --> 01:05:58.630
their entity,

2267
01:05:58.631 --> 01:06:01.180
their LLC that imagine if you got some,

2268
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:05.260
some actual physical dudes you could put their faces up on your website.

2269
01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:05.830
<v 0>He,</v>

2270
01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:06.663
you know,

2271
01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:07.530
my,

2272
01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:08.580
my thing was,

2273
01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:09.901
you know,

2274
01:06:09.901 --> 01:06:11.640
as soon as everybody,

2275
01:06:12.090 --> 01:06:12.871
not just me,

2276
01:06:12.871 --> 01:06:15.930
but the community sort of band together,

2277
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:17.880
I was like,

2278
01:06:18.930 --> 01:06:19.763
I could,

2279
01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:22.290
as soon as they wanted me to stop,

2280
01:06:22.291 --> 01:06:27.291
I realized it was sorta like punching a guy in the stomach and watching wins.

2281
01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:28.711
You know,

2282
01:06:28.711 --> 01:06:30.090
like when you're sparring and go,

2283
01:06:30.210 --> 01:06:30.690
oh,

2284
01:06:30.690 --> 01:06:31.380
okay,

2285
01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:32.010
I get it.

2286
01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:32.551
He's getting that.

2287
01:06:32.551 --> 01:06:33.660
He's getting punched there again.

2288
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:37.230
And so I doubled down.

2289
01:06:37.290 --> 01:06:39.360
And at a certain point they were like,

2290
01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:40.080
you know,

2291
01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.100
make it all go away,

2292
01:06:41.101 --> 01:06:41.934
Mr Wizzard.

2293
01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:43.470
And that was it.

2294
01:06:43.830 --> 01:06:44.250
But,

2295
01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:45.083
um,

2296
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.621
it was,

2297
01:06:46.621 --> 01:06:47.454
uh,

2298
01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:48.241
you know,

2299
01:06:48.241 --> 01:06:48.481
it's,

2300
01:06:48.481 --> 01:06:49.170
it's,

2301
01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:50.010
it's tough,

2302
01:06:50.070 --> 01:06:50.760
you know,

2303
01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:50.990
and,

2304
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:52.350
and I understand it's,

2305
01:06:52.351 --> 01:06:52.591
it's,

2306
01:06:52.591 --> 01:06:53.610
it's sort of like,

2307
01:06:55.350 --> 01:06:58.080
it's a lot like going through a divorce without getting divorced.

2308
01:06:58.081 --> 01:06:59.070
It's just a lot of,

2309
01:06:59.670 --> 01:07:00.330
you know,

2310
01:07:00.330 --> 01:07:02.490
why am I wasting all my time with this?

2311
01:07:02.491 --> 01:07:02.701
You know,

2312
01:07:02.701 --> 01:07:03.534
why?

2313
01:07:04.050 --> 01:07:04.500
You know,

2314
01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:05.041
there's a lot,

2315
01:07:05.041 --> 01:07:09.210
I'll tell you what's going on sort of on a micro and macro level.

2316
01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:14.240
I think in this country it's essentially being punished for being successful.

2317
01:07:16.110 --> 01:07:19.680
Like I talked to my guys at work all the time and I go,

2318
01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:23.460
don't ever be successful because you'll just get the shit kicked out of here

2319
01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:24.181
really.

2320
01:07:24.181 --> 01:07:26.520
So you really tell them that I do.

2321
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.990
And,

2322
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.300
and,

2323
01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:29.580
and I do the reason joking,

2324
01:07:29.581 --> 01:07:30.360
obviously,

2325
01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:31.081
well then I go,

2326
01:07:31.081 --> 01:07:32.400
I know there's no chance of that,

2327
01:07:32.401 --> 01:07:34.890
but even if you get a wild hair up your ass,

2328
01:07:34.891 --> 01:07:35.401
but I mean,

2329
01:07:35.401 --> 01:07:36.390
you think about,

2330
01:07:37.170 --> 01:07:38.730
you think about the relationship,

2331
01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:40.790
even I'll talk to a lot of successful guy,

2332
01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.390
talk to successful guys.

2333
01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:42.800
Like I,

2334
01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:43.633
I'll,

2335
01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:44.640
I'll give you,

2336
01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.420
I'll give you this.

2337
01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:46.253
Okay.

2338
01:07:46.290 --> 01:07:46.741
Uh,

2339
01:07:46.741 --> 01:07:49.050
I go to the Mexican Lady Barber,

2340
01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.000
$12 haircuts.

2341
01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:54.390
I don't give a shit and she has no idea who I am.

2342
01:07:54.391 --> 01:07:56.740
And we always chat when she cut my hair.

2343
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:57.081
And you know,

2344
01:07:57.081 --> 01:07:57.780
I asked her like,

2345
01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:58.381
how you doing?

2346
01:07:58.381 --> 01:08:00.660
And I know she goes to her sister's house a lot.

2347
01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.460
She's like 55,

2348
01:08:02.461 --> 01:08:03.241
60 years old,

2349
01:08:03.241 --> 01:08:06.510
but still like had sleepovers and stuff and her and her other sister go there

2350
01:08:06.511 --> 01:08:08.880
and they have card night and shit like that.

2351
01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:10.440
And uh,

2352
01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:12.780
whenever you find like,

2353
01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:16.250
especially in a just male or female,

2354
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:21.250
<v 1>but you start talking to that successful celebrity dude and he start talking to</v>

2355
01:08:21.981 --> 01:08:26.981
him about his sister or his sisters or his brother starts scratching around a

2356
01:08:28.251 --> 01:08:29.084
little bit,

2357
01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:31.070
ask how that relationship's going.

2358
01:08:31.310 --> 01:08:35.510
Find out about the time that they sucked you into this business deal.

2359
01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:37.430
Never gave you your money back.

2360
01:08:37.431 --> 01:08:38.270
And by the way,

2361
01:08:38.271 --> 01:08:39.290
are pissed at you.

2362
01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:42.710
Find about that time when your sister needed a borrow,

2363
01:08:42.711 --> 01:08:43.730
a little whatever,

2364
01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:47.870
or you paid for kid's private school for like three years.

2365
01:08:47.871 --> 01:08:48.950
And then when you finally said,

2366
01:08:48.951 --> 01:08:50.270
I can't pay for it anymore,

2367
01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:52.520
she called you an asshole and stormed out of the room.

2368
01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:53.720
Like just,

2369
01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:55.010
just in general,

2370
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:57.560
see how those relationships are going.

2371
01:08:58.480 --> 01:08:58.990
You know,

2372
01:08:58.990 --> 01:08:59.190
that's,

2373
01:08:59.190 --> 01:09:00.590
have a great relationship with my sister.

2374
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:01.943
Get along great.

2375
01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:03.500
She's really,

2376
01:09:03.670 --> 01:09:04.700
Yeah Shit.

2377
01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:05.563
She's cool.

2378
01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:07.610
She must be doing her own shit.

2379
01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:09.020
She's always done her own shit.

2380
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:10.310
She's just not that type.

2381
01:09:10.311 --> 01:09:10.911
She's just,

2382
01:09:10.911 --> 01:09:11.540
uh,

2383
01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:12.373
she's cool.

2384
01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.240
She's just down to earth.

2385
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:15.890
You don't have a brother.

2386
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:16.280
Nope.

2387
01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:17.780
I guarantee if we had a brother,

2388
01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:18.873
I'd beat his ass.

2389
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:19.390
Yeah,

2390
01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:20.090
he'd be fine.

2391
01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:21.200
He'd be coming after you.

2392
01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:22.431
He'd be like,

2393
01:09:22.431 --> 01:09:23.150
hey man,

2394
01:09:23.150 --> 01:09:25.580
I got this idea for a frozen yogurt place.

2395
01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:27.560
Or I'd love him when we'd be great friends.

2396
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.861
You know,

2397
01:09:27.861 --> 01:09:28.910
if he got his shit together,

2398
01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:29.271
it's all,

2399
01:09:29.271 --> 01:09:29.780
you know,

2400
01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:32.780
I have friends that have brothers and they have the worst relationship with

2401
01:09:32.781 --> 01:09:33.201
their brothers.

2402
01:09:33.201 --> 01:09:36.530
Like they fought when they were young and now they're adults and one of them was

2403
01:09:36.531 --> 01:09:37.670
successful and one of them's not.

2404
01:09:37.671 --> 01:09:38.401
It's usually like,

2405
01:09:38.401 --> 01:09:41.810
well that's what I'm saying is the successful one

2406
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:48.920
asks the successful one how good the relationship is with the brother that's not

2407
01:09:48.921 --> 01:09:53.921
successful and see if it's not based on a lot of shit that the brother was

2408
01:09:54.831 --> 01:09:59.831
asking from them from the point when they see the guys name on the collar id

2409
01:10:00.501 --> 01:10:03.380
that they don't even want to pick up anymore that say no.

2410
01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:05.240
It's just gonna be him asking for something.

2411
01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:05.990
That's a weird,

2412
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:09.620
the weird uncomfortable thing about certain friendships when people want to drag

2413
01:10:09.621 --> 01:10:10.820
you into did business deals.

2414
01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:11.960
But I just don't,

2415
01:10:12.230 --> 01:10:13.250
I don't do any of that anymore.

2416
01:10:13.251 --> 01:10:14.450
I did it all when I was younger.

2417
01:10:14.451 --> 01:10:15.890
I got into a lot of a loan.

2418
01:10:15.891 --> 01:10:17.180
You money situations.

2419
01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:21.230
You know how many people paid me back at zero zero,

2420
01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:21.860
zero,

2421
01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:22.370
zero.

2422
01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:22.551
No.

2423
01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:23.030
I always,

2424
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:24.890
I always say it's hilarious.

2425
01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:30.040
It's like giving someone money except for when you give someone money,

2426
01:10:30.230 --> 01:10:31.970
at least you fucking get thanked.

2427
01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:33.673
This is,

2428
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:37.850
I gave you some 10 grand or 50 grand and I never got thanked,

2429
01:10:38.090 --> 01:10:39.260
but I never got my money.

2430
01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:40.233
Yeah.

2431
01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:41.390
So it's like lose,

2432
01:10:41.391 --> 01:10:42.080
lose.

2433
01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.270
I'm out the money and didn't even get the thank you.

2434
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:46.430
At least want to give a bum five bucks.

2435
01:10:46.431 --> 01:10:46.701
He goes,

2436
01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:47.534
God bless you.

2437
01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:50.930
Well people feel like they're just one deal away.

2438
01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:54.350
There's a friend that I have that I talked to every now and then and I called

2439
01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:58.850
him up and I talked to him recently and I called him up and I was like,

2440
01:10:58.851 --> 01:10:59.481
what's up man?

2441
01:10:59.481 --> 01:10:59.961
How you doing?

2442
01:10:59.961 --> 01:11:01.610
And I wanted it to be,

2443
01:11:01.611 --> 01:11:02.444
hey,

2444
01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:03.530
everything's good.

2445
01:11:03.531 --> 01:11:04.450
You know Bubba Blah,

2446
01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.220
he's just doing this and doing that.

2447
01:11:06.221 --> 01:11:06.620
And,

2448
01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:09.650
but immediately it was a fucking sales pitch for some new business that he wants

2449
01:11:09.651 --> 01:11:10.191
to start.

2450
01:11:10.191 --> 01:11:11.360
And if I get involved,

2451
01:11:11.361 --> 01:11:14.070
we're going to make this amount of money and it can't go wrong cause it's this

2452
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.520
<v 2>and that.</v>

2453
01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:17.760
And I mean this guy has just ear beating the fuck out of me for like five

2454
01:11:17.761 --> 01:11:18.360
minutes on the phone.

2455
01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:18.541
I go,

2456
01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:18.811
dude,

2457
01:11:18.811 --> 01:11:19.140
dude,

2458
01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:19.860
dude,

2459
01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:22.350
I'm not getting involved in anything where you don't even have to get involved.

2460
01:11:22.351 --> 01:11:22.661
You have a little,

2461
01:11:22.661 --> 01:11:22.921
a little,

2462
01:11:22.921 --> 01:11:23.430
a little Whoa,

2463
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.850
nope,

2464
01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:24.683
I'm not doing it.

2465
01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:24.931
I go,

2466
01:11:24.931 --> 01:11:25.411
listen man,

2467
01:11:25.411 --> 01:11:27.120
I'm fucking crazy busy.

2468
01:11:27.121 --> 01:11:27.954
I'm not getting it.

2469
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.950
I just wanted to call it to say,

2470
01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:29.480
hi.

2471
01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:29.880
Look,

2472
01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:31.290
I'm telling me you barely,

2473
01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:32.430
you don't even have to know about this.

2474
01:11:32.431 --> 01:11:32.671
I go,

2475
01:11:32.671 --> 01:11:33.504
I'll know.

2476
01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:37.050
I'll know and it will fuck with my head and I'll know that it's out there,

2477
01:11:37.051 --> 01:11:37.471
but listen,

2478
01:11:37.471 --> 01:11:39.060
you're going to be making money free money.

2479
01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:39.781
It's easy.

2480
01:11:39.781 --> 01:11:40.520
I'm going to do all the work.

2481
01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:41.311
Do you do stop.

2482
01:11:41.311 --> 01:11:41.970
Stop.

2483
01:11:41.970 --> 01:11:42.241
Okay.

2484
01:11:42.241 --> 01:11:42.990
I gotta go.

2485
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:43.980
<v 0>I'll give you a fuck.</v>

2486
01:11:44.010 --> 01:11:47.460
I'll give you a perfect concrete example.

2487
01:11:47.461 --> 01:11:49.560
Literally a concrete example.

2488
01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:55.520
If you buy and I did a warehouse and anywhere near your old neighborhood,

2489
01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:03.570
your phone will start to rank like guy.

2490
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:04.423
Hey Man,

2491
01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:08.570
I got a Catamaran boat and I'm going through a pretty bad divorce right now to

2492
01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:09.360
buy it.

2493
01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.530
Oh No,

2494
01:12:10.890 --> 01:12:12.170
I just need to start.

2495
01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:16.290
Can I just put it in a parking lot for just a couple of days or maybe a couple

2496
01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:16.320
of weeks?

2497
01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:16.771
I don't know.

2498
01:12:16.771 --> 01:12:17.070
I'm just,

2499
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:21.270
I'm staying over at the oakwoods right now and there's no place to park it and

2500
01:12:21.271 --> 01:12:23.030
then the phone will ring again.

2501
01:12:23.031 --> 01:12:24.330
It'll be another one of your friends.

2502
01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:25.080
Listen,

2503
01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.420
I got a new pickup truck but the old one,

2504
01:12:27.630 --> 01:12:31.200
it's got the Denver boot on it so I can't really drive it,

2505
01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:33.930
but I'm still making payments on it.

2506
01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:35.310
Could I just,

2507
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:36.450
I could flat,

2508
01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:39.780
I could flatbed it over to the warehouse,

2509
01:12:39.781 --> 01:12:41.190
but I'm just looking for a place.

2510
01:12:41.191 --> 01:12:42.390
I mean I'm going to get to Denver,

2511
01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:44.790
booed off and then I'm going to sell it back to the,

2512
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:50.750
your warehouse will immediately fill up with everyone's shit because you got the

2513
01:12:53.671 --> 01:12:55.500
warehouse and they don't,

2514
01:12:55.501 --> 01:13:00.501
and the warehouse is sorta the concrete metaphor for you having the position,

2515
01:13:02.191 --> 01:13:03.660
the name and the checkbook.

2516
01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:04.260
Right.

2517
01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:06.540
So you try it cause that's what happened.

2518
01:13:06.541 --> 01:13:06.830
Right.

2519
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:09.550
<v 2>How do you feel like that you feel like that trickles down from the government?</v>

2520
01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:11.590
Like how do you feel like that trickled down from the government?

2521
01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:14.140
I think does she think that the government is just sort of responding to people

2522
01:13:14.141 --> 01:13:16.690
that don't necessarily know how to become successful?

2523
01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:18.010
And that's like the,

2524
01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:19.520
this is the desire,

2525
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:20.130
the government,

2526
01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:22.630
like this idea that the government creates jobs,

2527
01:13:22.631 --> 01:13:24.340
the government is creating jobs.

2528
01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.260
Like what does that mean?

2529
01:13:26.710 --> 01:13:27.360
<v 0>I don't know.</v>

2530
01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:27.970
I don't know.

2531
01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:28.791
What I'm saying is,

2532
01:13:28.791 --> 01:13:31.580
is I don't think that the Gov,

2533
01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:33.520
I don't think that it trickles down,

2534
01:13:34.090 --> 01:13:34.480
you know,

2535
01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:35.920
directly from the government.

2536
01:13:35.921 --> 01:13:36.820
What I'm saying is,

2537
01:13:36.821 --> 01:13:41.821
is first off there's a mentality and the message should be pick yourself up by

2538
01:13:45.161 --> 01:13:47.410
your own fucking boot bootstraps.

2539
01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:49.450
That's what this whole country's been about.

2540
01:13:49.870 --> 01:13:54.790
Everybody has a story about a grandparent coming over here with three nickels in

2541
01:13:54.791 --> 01:13:57.730
his pocket working hard and getting his shit together.

2542
01:13:57.731 --> 01:13:59.530
So that should be the message.

2543
01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:00.071
Number one,

2544
01:14:00.071 --> 01:14:03.680
not well the playing field's not level and there's a wealth,

2545
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:05.300
wealth and income in,

2546
01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:06.153
you know,

2547
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:07.263
fuck that.

2548
01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.240
So the first office,

2549
01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:11.080
the message gets shit together and work hard.

2550
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:11.973
You'll be fine.

2551
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:13.780
It doesn't matter what your ethnicity is,

2552
01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:15.400
doesn't matter what your religion is,

2553
01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:17.170
doesn't matter what your background is.

2554
01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:20.680
Just put it together and work hard and you know you're going to be working

2555
01:14:20.681 --> 01:14:21.850
harder than Heidi Klum.

2556
01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:24.550
But English wasn't her first language either.

2557
01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.470
She figured it out along the way.

2558
01:14:26.890 --> 01:14:28.930
Now she figured out how to make millions of dollars.

2559
01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:30.220
But first off,

2560
01:14:30.270 --> 01:14:32.350
the the message from the government should be that.

2561
01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:36.580
The second thing that's more direct that the government could do is let's not

2562
01:14:36.581 --> 01:14:41.581
make it so easy for everyone to sue anyone or take anything.

2563
01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:42.730
I mean,

2564
01:14:42.730 --> 01:14:43.091
I'll give you a,

2565
01:14:43.091 --> 01:14:43.924
for instance,

2566
01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:49.840
if you have a house and you're renting it out and some guy moves in and just

2567
01:14:49.841 --> 01:14:51.880
decides to stop paying his rent,

2568
01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:55.030
it's good luck getting the money from him.

2569
01:14:55.210 --> 01:14:56.043
You'd good luck to you.

2570
01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:57.400
Good luck getting them out of your house.

2571
01:14:57.401 --> 01:14:58.840
So it takes a long time.

2572
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:59.140
Right?

2573
01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:02.680
So the government could definitely help in that department.

2574
01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:06.190
That's your parcel of land that you pay taxes on.

2575
01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:08.740
This guy stopped paying you,

2576
01:15:09.250 --> 01:15:10.720
but they're siding with him.

2577
01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:13.870
Well sometimes people just move into people's houses and changed the locks and

2578
01:15:13.871 --> 01:15:16.870
squat and they say it's their house that's,

2579
01:15:17.530 --> 01:15:18.580
that's even worse.

2580
01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:24.060
And what the government is quietly saying is chose got his own house with,

2581
01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:26.200
used to have five toilets,

2582
01:15:26.201 --> 01:15:27.400
now he's got four,

2583
01:15:27.401 --> 01:15:29.320
she's got a couple of Nice cars up there.

2584
01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:30.730
Does he really need the,

2585
01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.170
I mean he's doing out Ryan,

2586
01:15:32.171 --> 01:15:33.004
isn't he?

2587
01:15:33.370 --> 01:15:35.470
As long as he's paying taxes on that other house,

2588
01:15:35.471 --> 01:15:36.430
there's really nothing we're going to,

2589
01:15:36.431 --> 01:15:37.211
is that what I'm saying?

2590
01:15:37.211 --> 01:15:37.780
Or is it,

2591
01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:38.560
or they're saying,

2592
01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:38.921
look,

2593
01:15:38.921 --> 01:15:41.440
we're so fucking overwhelmed with all sorts of other shit.

2594
01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:43.720
We're just going to let the lawyer sort this out.

2595
01:15:43.721 --> 01:15:45.760
And the lawyers being the predatory concept,

2596
01:15:45.761 --> 01:15:47.080
they are say look,

2597
01:15:47.081 --> 01:15:50.230
this is what I got a lot of money to be made and keeping this conflict going.

2598
01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:53.020
Cause that's what pays lawyers off conflict.

2599
01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:57.580
The more conflict they can somehow or another right down in books,

2600
01:15:57.730 --> 01:16:02.730
the more they can make it easier to sort of manipulate clauses and sue people

2601
01:16:04.451 --> 01:16:08.080
for things like a serialized podcast on the Internet.

2602
01:16:08.890 --> 01:16:12.250
Well not only that but all the stuff.

2603
01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:17.460
I mean think about just the f you just take your car.

2604
01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:24.480
Every new car you buy has a bunch of warning stickers that are,

2605
01:16:25.530 --> 01:16:25.840
you know,

2606
01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:28.300
hot glued to the sun visor,

2607
01:16:28.570 --> 01:16:31.480
bunch of buzzers and backup things and a bunch of,

2608
01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:31.731
you know,

2609
01:16:31.731 --> 01:16:33.710
deactivate the airbag buttons in a,

2610
01:16:33.711 --> 01:16:37.210
but how much does that add to the average price of a car?

2611
01:16:37.450 --> 01:16:42.450
How much to the average flight is added to the ticket for just all the shit that

2612
01:16:43.450 --> 01:16:48.070
all the insurance that the airline has to cover or that the car manufacturer has

2613
01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:52.000
to cover or all the shit that's going to get people sued.

2614
01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:57.360
Think about just how much cheaper everything would be if everyone wasn't

2615
01:16:57.671 --> 01:17:02.671
completely lawyered up and completely trying to save themselves and,

2616
01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:03.080
and,

2617
01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:08.080
and think about all the stupid conversations and all the paperwork and,

2618
01:17:08.371 --> 01:17:11.510
and how we've completely lost our humanity.

2619
01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:12.440
You know,

2620
01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:12.941
when the,

2621
01:17:12.941 --> 01:17:16.070
the warehouse that I do my podcast from,

2622
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:17.720
when I bought that warehouse,

2623
01:17:17.721 --> 01:17:22.550
there was a guy in it and he sold flooring and I bought it,

2624
01:17:22.551 --> 01:17:24.020
but he had like nine,

2625
01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:25.910
10 months left on his lease.

2626
01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:27.650
And I said to him,

2627
01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:28.431
like,

2628
01:17:28.431 --> 01:17:30.830
if you just bought a new warehouse and you're thinking,

2629
01:17:31.190 --> 01:17:31.461
Hey,

2630
01:17:31.461 --> 01:17:32.294
I'd like to move.

2631
01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:34.580
It turns out my friends moved all their shit in,

2632
01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:38.720
but I'd like to move some of my shit in or make a studio or something like that.

2633
01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:41.360
But a guy had Elise for like nine months.

2634
01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:44.150
So I talked to the guy and the guy said,

2635
01:17:44.151 --> 01:17:45.800
well you know I am thinking about,

2636
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:47.630
I am kind of looking for another place.

2637
01:17:47.631 --> 01:17:48.980
I'm thinking about buying a place.

2638
01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.120
And I said,

2639
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:52.640
well as soon as you can find that place,

2640
01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:53.750
tell me,

2641
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:58.430
cause I'm anxious to get in here with my boys and get going and start building

2642
01:17:58.431 --> 01:17:59.264
this place out.

2643
01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:01.160
And about three months later,

2644
01:18:01.161 --> 01:18:01.551
he's like,

2645
01:18:01.551 --> 01:18:02.930
I found another place.

2646
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:03.831
And I said,

2647
01:18:03.831 --> 01:18:04.430
fine,

2648
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:08.510
consider yourself out of your lease and have fun.

2649
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.771
And he said,

2650
01:18:09.771 --> 01:18:11.120
I'll be out by the 30th I said,

2651
01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:12.193
absolutely.

2652
01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:13.130
And he said,

2653
01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:14.840
I need you to sign this piece of paper.

2654
01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:15.951
And I said,

2655
01:18:15.951 --> 01:18:16.161
what?

2656
01:18:16.161 --> 01:18:17.030
What piece of paper?

2657
01:18:17.031 --> 01:18:17.341
And he said,

2658
01:18:17.341 --> 01:18:21.380
the piece of paper that's releasing me from this,

2659
01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:22.580
from my lease.

2660
01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:23.713
And I said,

2661
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:24.950
we don't need a piece of paper.

2662
01:18:25.010 --> 01:18:28.310
I just looked in the eye and told you you can leave and when you're ready to

2663
01:18:28.311 --> 01:18:29.630
leave you tell me.

2664
01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:30.890
And that's my word.

2665
01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:31.491
And he said,

2666
01:18:31.491 --> 01:18:31.641
yeah,

2667
01:18:31.641 --> 01:18:32.680
but signed the paper.

2668
01:18:33.190 --> 01:18:33.920
I should.

2669
01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:34.970
What do we need to pay for four?

2670
01:18:34.971 --> 01:18:35.840
We're two adults.

2671
01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.300
And I just told you one adult to another,

2672
01:18:38.301 --> 01:18:39.530
I can't wait to get in here.

2673
01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:40.460
I'm not going to let you.

2674
01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:43.460
It's not like you're going to leave and then I'm going to sue you for the next

2675
01:18:43.461 --> 01:18:44.570
four months that you didn't.

2676
01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:45.890
I'm not that guy.

2677
01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:47.600
I'm the one that told you you could leave.

2678
01:18:47.601 --> 01:18:49.310
And I shook your hand and you can leave.

2679
01:18:49.311 --> 01:18:50.144
And he said,

2680
01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.250
you need to sign this release.

2681
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.941
And I said,

2682
01:18:52.941 --> 01:18:53.774
I'll tell you what,

2683
01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:55.640
I'm not going to sign a release.

2684
01:18:56.180 --> 01:19:00.290
So you can either take my word as a man or you can just stay here for another

2685
01:19:00.291 --> 01:19:01.124
four months,

2686
01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:02.690
but I'm not signing a release.

2687
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:03.590
Wow.

2688
01:19:03.650 --> 01:19:04.483
And the guy said,

2689
01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:05.320
fine.

2690
01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:06.153
He just split.

2691
01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.033
Whoa.

2692
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:09.390
But I'd like to,

2693
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:10.303
I'd like to get,

2694
01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:15.470
what legally could have happened is I could have been many of the Douche bags

2695
01:19:15.471 --> 01:19:20.471
I've dealt with and I could have taken over the warehouse and then went and

2696
01:19:21.681 --> 01:19:23.930
sentence sent this guy a letter and said,

2697
01:19:23.931 --> 01:19:24.764
hey man,

2698
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:29.890
you still have five months left on your lease and it's 3,300 or whatever.

2699
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:32.840
That's a 16,000,

2700
01:19:32.841 --> 01:19:34.070
$500.

2701
01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:35.510
If we got to go to court,

2702
01:19:35.511 --> 01:19:36.830
this is going to get expensive.

2703
01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:37.520
You know what,

2704
01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:38.480
I'll settle for 10

2705
01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:42.290
and his lawyer probably would have said,

2706
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:44.240
you didn't get him to sign a release.

2707
01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:45.830
What are you an Emba Saul?

2708
01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:46.461
You know what,

2709
01:19:46.461 --> 01:19:47.211
just give him the 10.

2710
01:19:47.211 --> 01:19:49.370
It's going to be a lot cheaper than paying me and going to court.

2711
01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:49.640
<v 2>Well,</v>

2712
01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:52.320
what about okay to play devil's advocate or the,

2713
01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:52.661
you know,

2714
01:19:52.661 --> 01:19:53.710
the argument against it?

2715
01:19:53.711 --> 01:19:54.670
Like what about things like,

2716
01:19:54.671 --> 01:19:54.941
you know,

2717
01:19:54.941 --> 01:19:56.230
the serious situation,

2718
01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:58.360
I believe it was Chevrolet had,

2719
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:59.223
um,

2720
01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:02.800
some ignition issues that they knew about where cars were cutting out and it

2721
01:20:02.801 --> 01:20:07.560
caused a bunch of deaths and a lot of people were aware of issue,

2722
01:20:07.561 --> 01:20:11.820
but they knew that a recall would be incredibly expensive and they drag their

2723
01:20:11.821 --> 01:20:15.160
heels and they didn't do anything about it for a long time and now it's such,

2724
01:20:15.170 --> 01:20:18.630
just a fucking complete disaster and they're getting sued like crazy.

2725
01:20:19.150 --> 01:20:20.400
What about that kind of situation?

2726
01:20:20.401 --> 01:20:22.020
Like it's kind of important to have wars.

2727
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.721
I mean,

2728
01:20:22.721 --> 01:20:22.850
yeah,

2729
01:20:22.850 --> 01:20:25.790
<v 0>obviously the balance,</v>

2730
01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:27.103
it's like,

2731
01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:29.540
do you have an army?

2732
01:20:29.690 --> 01:20:30.523
Yes.

2733
01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:32.390
Do you invade Canada?

2734
01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:33.613
No.

2735
01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:35.420
Do you have police?

2736
01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:36.403
Yes.

2737
01:20:36.650 --> 01:20:40.550
Do they shoot every person darker than them walking down the sidewalk?

2738
01:20:40.910 --> 01:20:41.743
No.

2739
01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:43.610
Do you have lawyers?

2740
01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:44.533
Yes.

2741
01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:47.420
Do you have shitloads of lawyers that are suing everyone?

2742
01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:48.590
All the time?

2743
01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:49.431
No.

2744
01:20:49.431 --> 01:20:50.720
Like so there's,

2745
01:20:50.721 --> 01:20:52.220
you know the balance.

2746
01:20:52.221 --> 01:20:53.330
There's reasons to sue.

2747
01:20:53.410 --> 01:20:53.770
Yeah.

2748
01:20:53.770 --> 01:20:53.940
You,

2749
01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:54.741
you know the,

2750
01:20:54.741 --> 01:20:55.574
uh,

2751
01:20:55.670 --> 01:20:56.960
Ford Pinto,

2752
01:20:57.110 --> 01:21:02.110
I had two of my best friends died about three miles from here in a pinto station

2753
01:21:07.191 --> 01:21:10.460
wagon that was in an accident and burst into flames.

2754
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.880
Yeah.

2755
01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:14.100
<v 2>Does the classic story that we had all heard?</v>

2756
01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:14.580
Yeah.

2757
01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:15.750
You actually knew people like

2758
01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:18.930
<v 0>Robert [inaudible] from way back,</v>

2759
01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.000
fuck going to Csun,

2760
01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:26.400
God damn car pooling together crazy like 18,

2761
01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:29.940
just rear ended,

2762
01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:32.760
two cars banged up next to him,

2763
01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:33.720
like couldn't get out.

2764
01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:35.340
The whole car just went up.

2765
01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.353
Fuck.

2766
01:21:36.450 --> 01:21:37.283
Yup.

2767
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:38.401
It's crazy.

2768
01:21:38.401 --> 01:21:39.234
Right?

2769
01:21:39.810 --> 01:21:41.070
He always wonder like,

2770
01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:41.690
what,

2771
01:21:41.690 --> 01:21:44.220
what would have those guys gone on to,

2772
01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:46.020
what could they have done?

2773
01:21:46.410 --> 01:21:51.410
And it's also weird that even though they died when they were 18,

2774
01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:53.190
they're still always my age,

2775
01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:54.600
whatever age I am.

2776
01:21:55.050 --> 01:21:57.120
Which is a weird thing.

2777
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:58.360
It,

2778
01:21:58.360 --> 01:21:59.193
it,

2779
01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:01.530
it was in,

2780
01:22:01.570 --> 01:22:02.730
and it's one of those,

2781
01:22:02.731 --> 01:22:03.960
in that case,

2782
01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:08.340
there needed to be lawyers and Ford knew about it.

2783
01:22:08.341 --> 01:22:09.180
And for dot,

2784
01:22:09.210 --> 01:22:10.043
you know,

2785
01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:11.560
let Robert and Lenny died,

2786
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:13.980
it'll be cheaper than recalling,

2787
01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:14.843
you know,

2788
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.500
2.7 million units

2789
01:22:16.730 --> 01:22:18.170
<v 2>or whatever whenever it was.</v>

2790
01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:19.513
And outfitting them.

2791
01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:21.051
Yeah.

2792
01:22:21.051 --> 01:22:21.884
There's a balance.

2793
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.640
Right.

2794
01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:23.141
And I,

2795
01:22:23.141 --> 01:22:23.750
I,

2796
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:26.390
I agree with you that there's definitely,

2797
01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:27.253
uh,

2798
01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:27.610
the,

2799
01:22:27.610 --> 01:22:31.470
the mentality of going after successful people and you know,

2800
01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:34.220
but obviously there's some successful people that are cons and there's some

2801
01:22:34.221 --> 01:22:38.870
successful people that have gotten there by ripping people off or by using slave

2802
01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:43.090
labor in third world countries and charging them pennies on the dollar or two

2803
01:22:43.670 --> 01:22:46.880
things that could have been done in America with a reasonable wage.

2804
01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:48.410
There's a balance to all of it.

2805
01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:49.251
And it's,

2806
01:22:49.251 --> 01:22:50.000
uh,

2807
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:50.440
for,

2808
01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:52.220
for people that are listening to this,

2809
01:22:52.221 --> 01:22:54.830
that are trying to form their own identity and carved their own path,

2810
01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:58.940
the key is to not concentrate on other people and go why them?

2811
01:22:59.370 --> 01:23:01.850
The key is to look at your own self and go,

2812
01:23:01.851 --> 01:23:03.800
what do I want to do and how do I get there?

2813
01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:04.960
Right?

2814
01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.793
Because

2815
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:09.790
<v 0>you could be Heidi Clume or Donald Trump,</v>

2816
01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:14.440
or you could be Robert and Lenny who never saw their 19th birthday.

2817
01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:16.930
I'm guessing you're somewhere in between.

2818
01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:20.470
So if you're somewhere in between,

2819
01:23:20.650 --> 01:23:25.650
you're just joined a huge pool called America and it's time to get to work,

2820
01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:27.790
get to work pitches,

2821
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:29.110
get to work,

2822
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:30.280
and try to be happy along the way.

2823
01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:31.390
Getting hurt.

2824
01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:32.081
You're out of time,

2825
01:23:32.081 --> 01:23:32.380
man.

2826
01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:33.460
You only have like 90 minutes,

2827
01:23:33.461 --> 01:23:33.641
right?

2828
01:23:33.641 --> 01:23:34.031
You've got to pull.

2829
01:23:34.031 --> 01:23:34.350
Yeah,

2830
01:23:34.350 --> 01:23:38.860
I've had a crazy go to [inaudible] dot com hit the banner.

2831
01:23:38.861 --> 01:23:40.060
I'm going to watch it this weekend.

2832
01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.320
I've hear great things about it.

2833
01:23:41.321 --> 01:23:42.610
I read a great review about it.

2834
01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:43.240
Well,

2835
01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:45.160
Joe promised me this.

2836
01:23:45.190 --> 01:23:46.540
If you see it,

2837
01:23:46.541 --> 01:23:48.430
you like it and you identify with it.

2838
01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:49.810
Next podcasts,

2839
01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:51.000
say how much he loved.

2840
01:23:51.010 --> 01:23:52.900
I will absolutely 100% do that.

2841
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:54.680
<v 2>I'm Corolla,</v>

2842
01:23:54.681 --> 01:23:55.580
ladies and gentlemen,

2843
01:23:55.581 --> 01:24:00.581
triumphant victor over podcast suing cons of America.

2844
01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:01.660
That's it.

2845
01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:02.240
Alright,

2846
01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:03.770
listen to the Adam Carolla podcast.

2847
01:24:03.771 --> 01:24:05.180
There's about a thousand of them,

2848
01:24:05.530 --> 01:24:05.860
uh,

2849
01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:09.170
various subjects and even fucking one with Dennis Miller.

2850
01:24:09.171 --> 01:24:10.730
Now you're doing a podcast one.

2851
01:24:11.150 --> 01:24:12.100
He does too much.

2852
01:24:12.101 --> 01:24:13.730
He makes me look like a lazy bitch.

2853
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:14.151
All Right,

2854
01:24:14.151 --> 01:24:14.780
ladies and gentlemen,

2855
01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:15.590

2856
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.921
Thanks.

2857
01:24:15.921 --> 01:24:16.754
Yeah.

2858
01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:26.510
