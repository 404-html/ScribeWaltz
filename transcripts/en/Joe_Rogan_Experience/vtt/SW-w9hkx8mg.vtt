00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.050
<v Speaker 1>What's your take on this?</v>

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Trump versus the intelligence community jazz that seems to be going on right now</v>

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.830
<v Speaker 1>because I couldn't wait to get you in here to get an insider's perspective on</v>

5
00:00:14.831 --> 00:00:17.170
<v Speaker 1>this because I've never seen anything like it.</v>

6
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.041
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7
00:00:18.041 --> 00:00:19.810
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anything like what he was,</v>

8
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.120
<v Speaker 1>he was talking shit about flu shots today.</v>

9
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.210
<v Speaker 1>He's like flu shots in the biggest scam ever.</v>

10
00:00:25.211 --> 00:00:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

11
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.820
<v Speaker 1>are you sure you've done research?</v>

12
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Are you a doctor?</v>

13
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

14
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

15
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.141
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

16
00:00:30.141 --> 00:00:30.801
<v Speaker 2>I know that whole,</v>

17
00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:31.101
<v Speaker 2>and he's,</v>

18
00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:32.680
<v Speaker 2>and he's kind of a point that not appointed,</v>

19
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.900
<v Speaker 2>but he's brought somebody in as an advisor on that who is,</v>

20
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

21
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.550
<v Speaker 2>against vaccinations,</v>

22
00:00:37.551 --> 00:00:38.540
<v Speaker 2>whatever that term is.</v>

23
00:00:38.541 --> 00:00:40.730
<v Speaker 2>And not that the Intel thing.</v>

24
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.243
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

25
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.300
<v Speaker 2>there's so many ways you can take this.</v>

26
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.811
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

27
00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:45.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

28
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

29
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.690
<v Speaker 2>basically it was a self inflicted wound.</v>

30
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.890
<v Speaker 2>It was unnecessary.</v>

31
00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:50.360
<v Speaker 2>There was no reason for him,</v>

32
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

33
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.250
<v Speaker 2>in the early stage of this,</v>

34
00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:53.660
<v Speaker 2>when that narrative started to build about,</v>

35
00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:53.781
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

36
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:56.360
<v Speaker 2>there's this rift building between Trump and the intel community.</v>

37
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.950
<v Speaker 2>It was because of his tweets,</v>

38
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

39
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.680
<v Speaker 2>And it was because of him questioning the,</v>

40
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

41
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.750
<v Speaker 2>the intelligence about Russian meddling in our election system.</v>

42
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.350
<v Speaker 2>And now to talk about that just for a second,</v>

43
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.310
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

44
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.370
<v Speaker 2>the fucking Russians were meddling.</v>

45
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.080
<v Speaker 2>The Russians had been meddling in US politics and campaigning over here in a</v>

46
00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:18.291
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

47
00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:20.870
<v Speaker 2>since they've been around as have the Chinese,</v>

48
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.740
<v Speaker 2>as have the Chinese,</v>

49
00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:22.640
<v Speaker 2>you could go back to,</v>

50
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:23.121
<v Speaker 2>and people should,</v>

51
00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:28.121
<v Speaker 2>this was a fascinating period of time in history back to like 1941 go back to</v>

52
00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:31.970
<v Speaker 2>when the Russians were still in an alliance and a pact with the Nazis.</v>

53
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.270
<v Speaker 2>And so from the Russian perspective,</v>

54
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.380
<v Speaker 2>their goal,</v>

55
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.730
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

56
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.460
<v Speaker 2>their point was to keep the US out of the war.</v>

57
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.720
<v Speaker 2>And so what did they do?</v>

58
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.320
<v Speaker 2>There's an isolationist wing in the States and Roosevelt was under a lot of</v>

59
00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:45.651
<v Speaker 2>pressure.</v>

60
00:01:45.651 --> 00:01:46.700
<v Speaker 2>Roosevelt was,</v>

61
00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:48.230
<v Speaker 2>was becoming very close to Churchill.</v>

62
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.700
<v Speaker 2>They understood the threat.</v>

63
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.350
<v Speaker 2>He was one of the few people that did at the time.</v>

64
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:54.290
<v Speaker 2>He understood how important it was going to be for America to get into this</v>

65
00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:55.124
<v Speaker 2>battle.</v>

66
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.080
<v Speaker 2>The UK was about ready to fall.</v>

67
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.250
<v Speaker 2>And so the British were actually running their intelligence operations out of</v>

68
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:04.520
<v Speaker 2>New York and they had a place over in Rockville Rockefeller Center.</v>

69
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.420
<v Speaker 2>And because they were worried they would have island was going to be run over by</v>

70
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:08.921
<v Speaker 2>the Nazis.</v>

71
00:02:08.921 --> 00:02:13.100
<v Speaker 2>So you have this going on in the dynamic with the Russians was that they were</v>

72
00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:13.970
<v Speaker 2>still in this pact,</v>

73
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

74
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.320
<v Speaker 2>with the Nazi.</v>

75
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.520
<v Speaker 2>Stalin didn't see this common.</v>

76
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:20.870
<v Speaker 2>He didn't see that on the Nazis were running a very large propaganda campaign,</v>

77
00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:23.780
<v Speaker 2>a diversion effort to ensure that the Russians wouldn't know that they were</v>

78
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.680
<v Speaker 2>about to invade.</v>

79
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.690
<v Speaker 2>So the Russians spent a great deal of time and money and resource here in the u</v>

80
00:02:28.691 --> 00:02:33.260
<v Speaker 2>s influencing us public opinion about staying out of the war.</v>

81
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.280
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason to be in the world.</v>

82
00:02:34.281 --> 00:02:35.930
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want to get into another war in Europe?</v>

83
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.990
<v Speaker 2>And they bought journalists and,</v>

84
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.690
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

85
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.100
<v Speaker 2>placed,</v>

86
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

87
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.370
<v Speaker 2>newspaper articles.</v>

88
00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:41.270
<v Speaker 2>They paid off journalists.</v>

89
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.110
<v Speaker 2>They were setting up associations that were supposedly independent,</v>

90
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.750
<v Speaker 2>but we're run by the Soviets.</v>

91
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.760
<v Speaker 2>They were influencing unions,</v>

92
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.230
<v Speaker 2>dumping money into unions and bribing basically day to get them to steer their</v>

93
00:02:54.231 --> 00:02:55.810
<v Speaker 2>membership to isolationists,</v>

94
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

95
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.511
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

96
00:02:56.511 --> 00:02:57.344
<v Speaker 2>agenda.</v>

97
00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:58.761
<v Speaker 2>So to say that,</v>

98
00:02:58.761 --> 00:02:58.881
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

99
00:02:58.881 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 2>I know if the Russians were meddling,</v>

100
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 2>of course they'd been doing it.</v>

101
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 2>That's the w and then all the way through the Cold War,</v>

102
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

104
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 2>this is what they do.</v>

105
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.513
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

106
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.353
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

107
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 2>but it it the narrative because it always has to be simplified.</v>

108
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 2>I think as far as the media is concerned,</v>

109
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 2>the narrative was that they influenced the election.</v>

110
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 2>We'll know they were meddling,</v>

111
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't hacking into election systems.</v>

112
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 2>They weren't hacking into the voting booths and changing these things.</v>

113
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.310
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

114
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.230
<v Speaker 1>so when you say metal and what they were doing is essentially they were getting</v>

115
00:03:28.231 --> 00:03:32.550
<v Speaker 1>information that was private that was being distributed between the democratic</v>

116
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.481
<v Speaker 1>right convention.</v>

117
00:03:33.481 --> 00:03:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

118
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.040
<v Speaker 1>They were definitely involved in,</v>

119
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.840
<v Speaker 1>in the DNC hacking for instance.</v>

120
00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:38.910
<v Speaker 1>They were definitely involved in thinking how were they involved?</v>

121
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:39.481
<v Speaker 1>Were they involved?</v>

122
00:03:39.481 --> 00:03:39.661
<v Speaker 1>Were they,</v>

123
00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:44.661
<v Speaker 1>did they directly did the hacking to the Democrats or were they privy to the</v>

124
00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:47.820
<v Speaker 1>information because someone sold it to them or got it to them?</v>

125
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.190
<v Speaker 2>As with most of these things that usually there's cutouts,</v>

126
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.451
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

127
00:03:50.451 --> 00:03:50.781
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

128
00:03:50.781 --> 00:03:51.200
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

129
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.790
<v Speaker 2>there's a pla plausible deniability and so,</v>

130
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

131
00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.430
<v Speaker 2>but the Russians have been very,</v>

132
00:03:58.431 --> 00:03:58.611
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

133
00:03:58.611 --> 00:03:59.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

134
00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.660
<v Speaker 2>No worries.</v>

135
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.460
<v Speaker 2>The Russians have been very,</v>

136
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

137
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.160
<v Speaker 2>adept over the years at,</v>

138
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

139
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 2>creating,</v>

140
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

141
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.980
<v Speaker 2>mayhem,</v>

142
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.340
<v Speaker 2>creating chaos around democratic institutions.</v>

143
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.570
<v Speaker 2>Their whole goal is to chip away at public trust in,</v>

144
00:04:14.571 --> 00:04:16.550
<v Speaker 2>in a democracy and not just here in the west,</v>

145
00:04:16.551 --> 00:04:17.060
<v Speaker 2>but everywhere.</v>

146
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.331
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

147
00:04:17.331 --> 00:04:17.571
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

148
00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:20.000
<v Speaker 2>and obviously that played out in proxy wars out in Africa.</v>

149
00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:21.590
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>

150
00:04:21.591 --> 00:04:22.010
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

151
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.490
<v Speaker 2>I guess what I'm trying to say is it should have shocked no one that the</v>

152
00:04:25.491 --> 00:04:27.260
<v Speaker 2>Russians would be engaged in this sort of thing.</v>

153
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.340
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

154
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

155
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.923
<v Speaker 2>Trump,</v>

156
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:31.330
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

157
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.360
<v Speaker 2>a self inflicted wound,</v>

158
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.900
<v Speaker 2>he hadn't gotten the full briefing shit.</v>

159
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.600
<v Speaker 2>He hadn't seen the intelligence about this.</v>

160
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

161
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.310
<v Speaker 2>and prior to that,</v>

162
00:04:40.311 --> 00:04:42.140
<v Speaker 2>then he sending out a handful of tweets saying,</v>

163
00:04:42.141 --> 00:04:42.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

164
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.190
<v Speaker 2>I questioned it.</v>

165
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.300
<v Speaker 2>It didn't make any sense.</v>

166
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.250
<v Speaker 2>You have all the opportunity in the world to question the intelligence and the</v>

167
00:04:49.251 --> 00:04:49.971
<v Speaker 2>time to do that.</v>

168
00:04:49.971 --> 00:04:50.151
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

169
00:04:50.151 --> 00:04:50.721
<v Speaker 2>you're sitting there,</v>

170
00:04:50.721 --> 00:04:52.850
<v Speaker 2>you're getting the briefings from the heads of the agencies,</v>

171
00:04:52.851 --> 00:04:53.750
<v Speaker 2>which happened.</v>

172
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.810
<v Speaker 2>And then if you notice after that briefing,</v>

173
00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.790
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

174
00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.960
<v Speaker 2>his tone changed completely.</v>

175
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.480
<v Speaker 2>And he came out and you know,</v>

176
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.050
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

177
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.640
<v Speaker 2>well the Russians were involved,</v>

178
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:05.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

179
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

180
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.760
<v Speaker 2>and it didn't make it.</v>

181
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.930
<v Speaker 2>Now I had to walk that back.</v>

182
00:05:08.931 --> 00:05:11.210
<v Speaker 2>So then he goes out to the agency and he has a meeting,</v>

183
00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:12.410
<v Speaker 2>which I think was a great thing.</v>

184
00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.330
<v Speaker 2>I was really happy to see that he did that.</v>

185
00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 2>And so soon in the administration goes out to,</v>

186
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.710
<v Speaker 2>to our headquarters out out there in Virginia.</v>

187
00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.053
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

188
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.800
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

189
00:05:21.801 --> 00:05:22.780
<v Speaker 2>he got sidetracked,</v>

190
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.560
<v Speaker 2>but that's his personality.</v>

191
00:05:24.561 --> 00:05:27.080
<v Speaker 2>He starts talking about the inauguration numbers.</v>

192
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.180
<v Speaker 2>You start talking about the media,</v>

193
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

194
00:05:29.511 --> 00:05:30.530
<v Speaker 2>the unfair media.</v>

195
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:31.101
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

196
00:05:31.101 --> 00:05:31.640
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

197
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.620
<v Speaker 2>you could just go out there.</v>

198
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.180
<v Speaker 2>Thank [inaudible] people say you're looking forward to working with them to</v>

199
00:05:35.181 --> 00:05:36.710
<v Speaker 2>protect national security interests.</v>

200
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.880
<v Speaker 2>Shake some hands and leave,</v>

201
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.050
<v Speaker 2>but it's not in his nature.</v>

202
00:05:39.051 --> 00:05:39.321
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

203
00:05:39.321 --> 00:05:41.810
<v Speaker 2>So he's going to get sidetracked and he's got to talk about other things,</v>

204
00:05:41.811 --> 00:05:43.400
<v Speaker 2>and then that becomes the story.</v>

205
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.480
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

206
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.201
<v Speaker 2>That's I guess what I'm saying,</v>

207
00:05:45.201 --> 00:05:46.034
<v Speaker 2>a balanced perspective.</v>

208
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.320
<v Speaker 1>How did it happen?</v>

209
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Because this is what was confusing to me.</v>

210
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.370
<v Speaker 1>How did the FBI in,</v>

211
00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:51.204
<v Speaker 1>and now originally,</v>

212
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 1>eventually the FBI came around to the CIA's conclusions,</v>

213
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 1>but there for a long time the FBI was disagreeing with CIA</v>

214
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.100
<v Speaker 2>about whether or not the Russians had anything to do with hacking the DNC.</v>

215
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

216
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:02.600
<v Speaker 2>the big,</v>

217
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 2>I think the big disagreement was really over motivation,</v>

218
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:06.111
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

219
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:06.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

220
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 2>was that what it was a big part.</v>

221
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 2>It was an evidence based thing that they didn't see any evidence that the</v>

222
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:11.564
<v Speaker 2>Russians were involved,</v>

223
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 2>which eventually became clear and now there was a rest.</v>

224
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 2>There was an arrest and unprecedented arrest a couple of days ago.</v>

225
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

226
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

227
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.051
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

228
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

229
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 2>but you're also talking about two different groups.</v>

230
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 2>So the bureau is the FBI as a law enforcement.</v>

231
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.860
<v Speaker 2>So when they look at something,</v>

232
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:26.630
<v Speaker 2>they're looking at it from a law enforcement perspective.</v>

233
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:29.600
<v Speaker 2>They're looking at gathering sufficient evidence to prove a case.</v>

234
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:29.991
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>

235
00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:31.720
<v Speaker 2>that's how they look at the agencies,</v>

236
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.870
<v Speaker 2>an Intel operation.</v>

237
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.380
<v Speaker 2>And so they're gab and pieces of information.</v>

238
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:35.601
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

239
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:37.160
<v Speaker 2>it's not an evidentiary chain thing,</v>

240
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

241
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.481
<v Speaker 2>So let's just get,</v>

242
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

243
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:39.950
<v Speaker 2>the preponderance of Intel.</v>

244
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.320
<v Speaker 2>Let's see where it leads as some of it's going to be conflicting.</v>

245
00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 2>Some of it's not well,</v>

246
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.090
<v Speaker 2>well sourced,</v>

247
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.920
<v Speaker 2>but let's all see what it tells us.</v>

248
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:46.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

249
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.800
<v Speaker 2>and so part of it is how they approach,</v>

250
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

251
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.810
<v Speaker 2>reaching a conclusion.</v>

252
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.240
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

253
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.420
<v Speaker 2>they were both going to get to the same place because he eventually there they</v>

254
00:06:56.421 --> 00:06:58.190
<v Speaker 2>sit down and they compare notes.</v>

255
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

256
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.230
<v Speaker 2>but part of it was the difference of opinion over the motivation and motivation</v>

257
00:07:03.231 --> 00:07:04.064
<v Speaker 2>is the toughest thing.</v>

258
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.040
<v Speaker 2>One of the toughest things approved in this business.</v>

259
00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:07.874
<v Speaker 2>And intelligence,</v>

260
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

261
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.141
<v Speaker 2>you can say,</v>

262
00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:09.351
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

263
00:07:09.351 --> 00:07:09.951
<v Speaker 2>they did this,</v>

264
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:10.610
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

265
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.590
<v Speaker 2>unless you've got a sore sitting in the tent,</v>

266
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:13.251
<v Speaker 2>who was there?</v>

267
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:15.050
<v Speaker 2>And part of the conversation when somebody says,</v>

268
00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:15.560
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

269
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:15.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

270
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:16.790
<v Speaker 2>this is why are,</v>

271
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:16.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

272
00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:17.870
<v Speaker 2>this is how we're going to do this.</v>

273
00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:22.240
<v Speaker 2>And this is a reason it without that sort of sourcing or intercepts,</v>

274
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:22.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

275
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.060
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

276
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.560
<v Speaker 2>it's tough to prove motivation.</v>

277
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.100
<v Speaker 2>So it took a while to kind of get around to that notion and it's still,</v>

278
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.113
<v Speaker 2>to be honest,</v>

279
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

280
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.270
<v Speaker 2>it's still a little bit up near,</v>

281
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.180
<v Speaker 2>we're probably never going to get,</v>

282
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:32.810
<v Speaker 2>unless again,</v>

283
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.210
<v Speaker 2>we get our hands on a really quality good source.</v>

284
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:35.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

285
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.430
<v Speaker 2>that may still be a little bit up in the air,</v>

286
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:38.500
<v Speaker 2>but the bottom line is Russian.</v>

287
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.030
<v Speaker 2>She had the Russians were engaged in doing what they always do,</v>

288
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.370
<v Speaker 2>the covert action propaganda campaigns,</v>

289
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.510
<v Speaker 2>whatever it may be.</v>

290
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.660
<v Speaker 2>There's the 30,000 foot view was always the same.</v>

291
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:48.440
<v Speaker 2>They want it,</v>

292
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:48.771
<v Speaker 2>they want to,</v>

293
00:07:48.771 --> 00:07:50.360
<v Speaker 2>so a sense of,</v>

294
00:07:50.361 --> 00:07:50.931
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>

295
00:07:50.931 --> 00:07:51.980
<v Speaker 2>of mistrust.</v>

296
00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:53.390
<v Speaker 2>They want to create some chaos.</v>

297
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:53.950
<v Speaker 2>They want to,</v>

298
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:54.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

299
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.730
<v Speaker 2>kind of chip away at the belief that,</v>

300
00:07:55.731 --> 00:07:55.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

301
00:07:55.921 --> 00:07:57.170
<v Speaker 2>at democracy is a great thing.</v>

302
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:58.123
<v Speaker 2>And they did.</v>

303
00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 2>And look how much time was spent talking about the integrity of the election</v>

304
00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:03.890
<v Speaker 2>system and whether we actually had a legitimate president or not.</v>

305
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:04.910
<v Speaker 2>That's a win.</v>

306
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.130
<v Speaker 2>So you've got a couple of colonels in the FSB,</v>

307
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.360
<v Speaker 2>which was the old KGB,</v>

308
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

309
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.930
<v Speaker 2>who undoubtedly have been promoted as a result of that operation.</v>

310
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.930
<v Speaker 2>And who got fo someone got arrested from the FSB,</v>

311
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.093
<v Speaker 2>who was that guy?</v>

312
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

313
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:17.120
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get arrested.</v>

314
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't have those details in front of me.</v>

315
00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:18.641
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

316
00:08:18.641 --> 00:08:20.330
<v Speaker 2>just some token got a pissed off Putin.</v>

317
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:22.930
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

318
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.490
<v Speaker 2>Throw him in the fucking wall for awhile.</v>

319
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.970
<v Speaker 2>He just sent the wrong thing,</v>

320
00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:26.390
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

321
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:27.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

322
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.670
<v Speaker 2>but that's unprecedented.</v>

323
00:08:28.671 --> 00:08:28.881
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

324
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:31.680
<v Speaker 2>Then they never have luckily arrest there guys like,</v>

325
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:32.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

326
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.333
<v Speaker 2>well they,</v>

327
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.180
<v Speaker 2>they have for certain things,</v>

328
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.320
<v Speaker 2>for corruption issues.</v>

329
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:36.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

330
00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.120
<v Speaker 2>if they get sideways,</v>

331
00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:38.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

332
00:08:38.391 --> 00:08:40.190
<v Speaker 2>from a internal arguments,</v>

333
00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:40.461
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

334
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:40.850
<v Speaker 2>then you'll,</v>

335
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:41.290
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>

336
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:41.650
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

337
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.390
<v Speaker 2>it usually doesn't make the news because nobody really gives a shit outside of</v>

338
00:08:44.391 --> 00:08:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Russia.</v>

339
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.220
<v Speaker 2>And they do now because of this,</v>

340
00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:48.410
<v Speaker 2>because of not because people want to talk about it.</v>

341
00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:49.990
<v Speaker 2>And what bothered me about this,</v>

342
00:08:49.991 --> 00:08:50.500
<v Speaker 2>sorry to interrupt.</v>

343
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:50.870
<v Speaker 2>You're willing to,</v>

344
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.230
<v Speaker 2>what bothered me about this was the narrative because the narrative was Russia</v>

345
00:08:54.231 --> 00:08:55.064
<v Speaker 2>hacked the,</v>

346
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 2>that's what everybody kept</v>

347
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.780
<v Speaker 1>saying and that's what all these Democrats,</v>

348
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.800
<v Speaker 1>these left wing people were saying to try to pump up this idea that Trump was</v>

349
00:09:01.801 --> 00:09:02.760
<v Speaker 1>not a legitimate president.</v>

350
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Russia hacked the election.</v>

351
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 1>Russia hacked the election.</v>

352
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Well know someone,</v>

353
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.213
<v Speaker 1>maybe Russia,</v>

354
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.150
<v Speaker 1>whoever it was,</v>

355
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:14.220
<v Speaker 1>put that information out that the DNC had sent through private emails,</v>

356
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.600
<v Speaker 1>but the information was what they sent you there.</v>

357
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:16.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

358
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:17.550
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>

359
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.930
<v Speaker 1>they didn't hack anything.</v>

360
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

361
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.020
<v Speaker 1>They didn't get into any election machines.</v>

362
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:22.650
<v Speaker 1>They didn't,</v>

363
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.180
<v Speaker 1>they didn't get into the voting machines.</v>

364
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:28.410
<v Speaker 1>They didn't do anything other than release information that was supposed to be</v>

365
00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:31.620
<v Speaker 1>private that indicated a bunch of really shady shit.</v>

366
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

367
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:32.550
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

368
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.383
<v Speaker 1>I mean all those,</v>

369
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.440
<v Speaker 1>all those Bernie Sanders,</v>

370
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:35.720
<v Speaker 1>how pissed off unless you be,</v>

371
00:09:35.721 --> 00:09:35.890
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

372
00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:39.180
<v Speaker 1>if you're a Bernie Sanders supporter and you're Bernie himself fucked over.</v>

373
00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:39.541
<v Speaker 1>He got,</v>

374
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:39.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

375
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.040
<v Speaker 1>Well he seemed to have made peace.</v>

376
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:41.501
<v Speaker 1>I guess he's,</v>

377
00:09:41.501 --> 00:09:43.650
<v Speaker 1>he's a politician that even though he says he's not,</v>

378
00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:44.484
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

379
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.940
<v Speaker 1>it's just a weirdly principled one.</v>

380
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

381
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:48.841
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

382
00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:49.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean I hit a wide eyed,</v>

383
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.420
<v Speaker 1>Bernie would have been a better candidate.</v>

384
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.610
<v Speaker 1>I think Bernie would have been Joe Biden would have been a better candidate.</v>

385
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.460
<v Speaker 1>I'll let you know.</v>

386
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.810
<v Speaker 1>You always like the person sitting on the bench and then they get in the race</v>

387
00:09:57.811 --> 00:09:58.230
<v Speaker 1>and they're not,</v>

388
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.280
<v Speaker 1>you know that's true too.</v>

389
00:09:59.281 --> 00:09:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

390
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 1>They might have dug up some shit about both of those guys,</v>

391
00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:05.310
<v Speaker 1>but Bernie was an interesting guy and he was not a whole lot of people that are</v>

392
00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:08.460
<v Speaker 1>in his position for as long as he is that have the kind of principles he has.</v>

393
00:10:08.461 --> 00:10:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Like when he was able to say,</v>

394
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:10.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

395
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.650
<v Speaker 1>why don't you release the transcripts of all these different speeches you gave</v>

396
00:10:13.651 --> 00:10:16.050
<v Speaker 1>to all these banks that you got paid a quarter million dollars.</v>

397
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:16.621
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

398
00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:19.230
<v Speaker 1>I'll happily release mine because I don't have any,</v>

399
00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:20.940
<v Speaker 1>cause I wouldn't take a penny from those people.</v>

400
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.480
<v Speaker 1>I was on a whole lot of people who could say stuff like that in a big debate.</v>

401
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:25.501
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

402
00:10:25.501 --> 00:10:26.370
<v Speaker 1>they rallied,</v>

403
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.170
<v Speaker 1>they got together and they,</v>

404
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.980
<v Speaker 1>they decided to rig the primaries and they've rigged it.</v>

405
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:32.843
<v Speaker 1>They really did.</v>

406
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.440
<v Speaker 1>That was what the Russians exposed.</v>

407
00:10:34.441 --> 00:10:34.800
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>

408
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Debbie Wasserman Schultz,</v>

409
00:10:35.851 --> 00:10:37.820
<v Speaker 1>she was a real piece of work credible.</v>

410
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:39.550
<v Speaker 1>So I think there's,</v>

411
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:40.331
<v Speaker 1>and you're right,</v>

412
00:10:40.331 --> 00:10:41.010
<v Speaker 1>and I guess what,</v>

413
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:41.671
<v Speaker 1>you know what obviously,</v>

414
00:10:41.671 --> 00:10:41.841
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

415
00:10:41.841 --> 00:10:42.550
<v Speaker 1>what people on that,</v>

416
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

417
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:42.951
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

418
00:10:42.951 --> 00:10:43.261
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

419
00:10:43.261 --> 00:10:45.900
<v Speaker 1>on the far left side are saying is,</v>

420
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.351
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

421
00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:47.011
<v Speaker 1>but without that,</v>

422
00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:48.990
<v Speaker 1>if they hadn't released that information,</v>

423
00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:50.380
<v Speaker 1>then it would have been a different ballgame.</v>

424
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:51.250
<v Speaker 1>And you know that,</v>

425
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:51.750
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

426
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Because we wouldn't know how fucking corrupt she was.</v>

427
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

428
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:54.871
<v Speaker 1>But we wouldn't know the,</v>

429
00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Debbie Wasserman Schultz had done what she'd done and Debbie Wasserman Schultz</v>

430
00:10:57.571 --> 00:11:00.630
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have gotten fired from the DNC and then immediately got hired by</v>

431
00:11:00.631 --> 00:11:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Hillary's campaign.</v>

432
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

433
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

434
00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:04.440
<v Speaker 1>they picked her up in a couple of minutes while she,</v>

435
00:11:04.441 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 1>obviously they want to keep her happy.</v>

436
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.190
<v Speaker 1>You know how when somebody walking out of that organization with,</v>

437
00:11:09.191 --> 00:11:10.990
<v Speaker 1>with a chip on their shoulder talking.</v>

438
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.620
<v Speaker 1>So especially after what she did for you.</v>

439
00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

440
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:14.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

441
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.020
<v Speaker 1>they rigged the primaries.</v>

442
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:16.890
<v Speaker 1>They really did.</v>

443
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.860
<v Speaker 1>And people should be upset about that way more than anything else.</v>

444
00:11:19.861 --> 00:11:21.450
<v Speaker 1>It's id that Russia did something.</v>

445
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.060
<v Speaker 1>When you expose something that you should,</v>

446
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.050
<v Speaker 1>that we should have known,</v>

447
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.000
<v Speaker 1>we should have known about it because it's a crime.</v>

448
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:27.421
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

449
00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:29.460
<v Speaker 1>that kind of corruption is essentially collusion.</v>

450
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:30.323
<v Speaker 1>It's a crime.</v>

451
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:31.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a conspiracy.</v>

452
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a real conspiracy to they're there,</v>

453
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.920
<v Speaker 1>they're interrupting democratic process and that's what they're doing.</v>

454
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

455
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:38.710
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

456
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:39.790
<v Speaker 1>Well then that was yeah.</v>

457
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Far More so then an outside force doing what you expect them to do anyway.</v>

458
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Frankly,</v>

459
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:46.890
<v Speaker 1>the Russians did.</v>

460
00:11:46.891 --> 00:11:47.724
<v Speaker 1>They always do.</v>

461
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.730
<v Speaker 1>So I think it would have been a great,</v>

462
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:51.961
<v Speaker 1>how interesting.</v>

463
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.240
<v Speaker 1>With those big conversations in,</v>

464
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:54.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

465
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:54.930
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

466
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:55.763
<v Speaker 2>in the Kremlin,</v>

467
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

468
00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.220
<v Speaker 2>or at FSB headquarters where they're talking about this.</v>

469
00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:00.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

470
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:00.911
<v Speaker 2>And they're,</v>

471
00:12:00.911 --> 00:12:01.691
<v Speaker 2>they're thinking about,</v>

472
00:12:01.691 --> 00:12:02.550
<v Speaker 2>and they're planning it.</v>

473
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.580
<v Speaker 2>Someone had to write a note,</v>

474
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:03.731
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

475
00:12:03.731 --> 00:12:04.600
<v Speaker 2>Someone had to sit and say,</v>

476
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:05.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

477
00:12:05.021 --> 00:12:06.430
<v Speaker 2>I got an idea for an operation.</v>

478
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.361
<v Speaker 2>And they had,</v>

479
00:12:07.361 --> 00:12:07.600
<v Speaker 2>cause they,</v>

480
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:07.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

481
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:09.670
<v Speaker 2>it their bureaucracy like everything else.</v>

482
00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:13.210
<v Speaker 2>And so they would have had to sit and figure this out and then,</v>

483
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:13.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

484
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.240
<v Speaker 2>it would have made its way to Putin cause you know,</v>

485
00:12:16.241 --> 00:12:19.510
<v Speaker 2>this obviously the concern over the blow back and the publicity of it all.</v>

486
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.990
<v Speaker 2>So Putin clearly knew what was going on.</v>

487
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:23.711
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

488
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:24.221
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

489
00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:25.540
<v Speaker 2>that's just the way it works.</v>

490
00:12:25.541 --> 00:12:28.090
<v Speaker 2>Stalin new back in the day and know exactly what they were doing,</v>

491
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.750
<v Speaker 2>trying to influence public opinion here back during the early world war one or</v>

492
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:32.021
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

493
00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:33.480
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

494
00:12:33.481 --> 00:12:33.680
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

495
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.040
<v Speaker 2>there's no surprise to Chinese do the same thing every,</v>

496
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:36.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

497
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.280
<v Speaker 2>every nation that's got the resources.</v>

498
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:38.501
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

499
00:12:38.501 --> 00:12:38.710
<v Speaker 2>hell,</v>

500
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.861
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

501
00:12:38.861 --> 00:12:39.700
<v Speaker 2>of course we do it too.</v>

502
00:12:39.701 --> 00:12:40.151
<v Speaker 2>People always say,</v>

503
00:12:40.151 --> 00:12:40.331
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

504
00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:40.631
<v Speaker 2>but wait,</v>

505
00:12:40.631 --> 00:12:40.871
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

506
00:12:40.871 --> 00:12:41.021
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

507
00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:41.291
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

508

<v Speaker 2>of course we do it,</v>

509
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:42.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

510
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:43.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying we don't.</v>

511
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

512
00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.201
<v Speaker 2>they all do it.</v>

513
00:12:44.201 --> 00:12:47.890
<v Speaker 2>It's half of the weird competition that's going on and you better hope we do it.</v>

514
00:12:47.891 --> 00:12:48.551
<v Speaker 2>And in a sense,</v>

515
00:12:48.551 --> 00:12:49.480
<v Speaker 2>I always say the San people say,</v>

516
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.291

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.000
<v Speaker 2>given how aggressive and how nasty the world is out there and how we're</v>

<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

538

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

539
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.170
<v Speaker 2>if people knew how often,</v>

540

<v Speaker 2>how consistently and constantly,</v>

541

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

542
00:13:16.931 --> 00:13:21.931
<v Speaker 2>our commercial and a public sector infrastructure is probed and tested and</v>

543
00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:23.950
<v Speaker 2>attacked on a daily basis,</v>

544
00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:24.970
<v Speaker 2>people wouldn't sleep at night,</v>
