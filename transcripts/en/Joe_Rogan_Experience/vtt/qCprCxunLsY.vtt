63
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was like taking a shower for</v>
<v Speaker 2>your butthole.</v>

64

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just smearing.</v>

66
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:22.300

<v Speaker 2>you just smearing the show over your</v>

67
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:22.961
<v Speaker 2>hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

68
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if I took some shit and it just</v>
<v Speaker 2>rubbed into the top of your head.</v>

69
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.401
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>

72
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.050
<v Speaker 2>But if I had to get in the shower and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would clean your asshole there,</v>

73
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.790
<v Speaker 2>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

<v Speaker 2>row,</v>
<v Speaker 2>toilet paper,</v>

76
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 2>I'd take a show there and get in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shower.</v>

77
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You've got to watch this fucking thing.</v>

82
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 2>You got to get it in the washing</v>
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>

83
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.630
<v Speaker 2>It needs hot water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sons.</v>

104
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 2>scientific research that's being done in</v>
<v Speaker 2>genetic engineering and changing?</v>

107
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.600
<v Speaker 2>like they've been able to identify the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gene that causes dwarfism and this</v>

108
00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:19.720
<v Speaker 2>debate has gone on as their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the technology keeps getting closer</v>

109
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:21.160
<v Speaker 2>to the point where we could actually do</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

110
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.100
<v Speaker 2>But there's some debate going is if we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can remove that gene,</v>

111
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.810
<v Speaker 2>if we can prevent your child from having</v>
<v Speaker 2>dwarfism,</v>

112

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:33.420
<v Speaker 2>It's playing God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's stumped.</v>

115
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.470
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm there going,</v>

116
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should absolutely remove it.</v>

117
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want your kid to go</v>

118
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:42.220
<v Speaker 2>through?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

119
00:05:42.221 --> 00:05:43.730
<v Speaker 2>granted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been lucky at like,</v>

120
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only had one surgery and I made a</v>

121
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.770
<v Speaker 2>good career with the hand that I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>dealt.</v>

122
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.110
<v Speaker 2>But there's a lot of little people I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that,</v>

123
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.590
<v Speaker 2>that haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't that and then get constantly</v>

124
00:05:56.591 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 2>made fun of their entire lives are</v>
<v Speaker 2>hidden away by their parents.</v>

125
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want your kid to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>through that and as a dwarf,</v>

126
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:05.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what struggles that you had growing up?</v>

127
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 2>Why would you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you intentionally put those</v>

128
00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 2>pains on your child?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that.</v>

129
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

130
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.430
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to understand a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions that people make.</v>

131
00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of rationalizations that people</v>

132
00:06:17.441 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 1>may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

133
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.733
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

134
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.310
<v Speaker 2>like one reason that I'm able to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian and sort of have this sense of</v>

135
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:26.030
<v Speaker 2>humor about it is because my dad was</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing,</v>

136
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:27.190
<v Speaker 2>is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

137
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.020
<v Speaker 2>like when I was born,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he found out that I was going to be a</v>

138
00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:33.140
<v Speaker 2>dwarf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he would go to these,</v>

139
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>LPA,</v>

140
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.050
<v Speaker 2>little people of America meetings and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>would find out about it and he was like,</v>

141
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my kid's going to get made fun of a lot.</v>

142
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:45.560
<v Speaker 2>Like his life is going to be weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his philosophy was when I was growing</v>

143
00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:47.270
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would make fun of me first,</v>

144
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.670
<v Speaker 2>but he would do it in like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in like a supportive way.</v>

145
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Like he would fuck with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then say,</v>

146
00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:52.190
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just insulted you,</v>

147
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:54.690
<v Speaker 2>hit me back with something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit me back and then get,</v>

148
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.420
<v Speaker 2>cause th this is going to happen to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>

149
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.670
<v Speaker 2>Bye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like training you.</v>

150
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by the time I got to kindergarten I</v>

151
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.950
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember kindergarten walking in in a</v>

152
00:07:04.951 --> 00:07:07.010

153
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:08.480

<v Speaker 2>And I looked at him and went,</v>

154
00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:09.950
<v Speaker 2>ha ha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mom doesn't live with your dad</v>

<v Speaker 2>like hurting this kid's feelings.</v>
