<v Speaker 1>There's two different speeds to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>water shoots in your asshole totos.</v>

53
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.240

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.280
<v Speaker 2>Do you went to Joseph Cao?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went to Japan.</v>

58
00:02:54.281 --> 00:02:57.280
<v Speaker 2>I just sat there for seriously for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>half hour with the one shooting in my</v>

59
00:02:57.281 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 2>asshole because it just felt so because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hit like the back wall,</v>

60
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.590
<v Speaker 2>but hold that long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to do it to feel like I was</v>

61
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.220
<v Speaker 2>getting clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still have to do paper afterwards.</v>

62
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.163
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

63
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 2>You didn't walk out with worried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so clean.</v>

64
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was like taking a shower for</v>
<v Speaker 2>your butthole.</v>

65
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty meticulous.</v>

66
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 2>You not doing as good a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

67
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 2>you're just mirroring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're using baby wipes,</v>

68
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 2>you just smearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show over your hair.</v>

69
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if I took some shit and I just</v>

70
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 2>rubbed into the top of your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You like,</v>

71
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a baby wipe.</v>

72
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 2>But if I had never you would never</v>
<v Speaker 2>accept that.</v>

73
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Speaker 2>But if I get in the shower and you would</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean your asshole here,</v>

74
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.790
<v Speaker 2>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

75
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.050
<v Speaker 2>But if you told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you told me I had 70 baby wipes and a</v>

76
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:43.730
<v Speaker 2>roll of toilet paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take a shoulder again,</v>

77
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 2>shower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

78
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.450
<v Speaker 2>That was a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This fork and shit all day too.</v>

79
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rubbed it with 70 baby wipes.</v>

80
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 2>I be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not enough.</v>

81
00:03:56.681 --> 00:04:00.130
<v Speaker 2>You've got to watch this fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to get it in the washing</v>

82
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:02.420
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't these hot water and Sun.</v>

83
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.830
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say baby wipes and paper,</v>

84
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.110
<v Speaker 2>just trying to get my method approved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still shit.</v>

85
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 2>Pick shower after the shower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

86
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.780
<v Speaker 2>unfair to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

87
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't go out for the day though,</v>

88
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 2>until I shower after I stand up or to</v>
<v Speaker 2>wipe or sit down,</v>

89
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.120
<v Speaker 2>stand up and sitting down even a</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility.</v>

90
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.630
<v Speaker 2>Fuck wipes or asked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sitting down.</v>

91
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:28.070

<v Speaker 2>Cuffs.</v>

92
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does.</v>

93
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.200
<v Speaker 2>I wanted you to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

94
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 2>I stayed in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find a target.</v>

95
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.203
<v Speaker 2>Stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up.</v>

96
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Stand up or sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

97
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.220
<v Speaker 2>there's people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people sit in their sleeves,</v>

98
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.480
<v Speaker 2>smelled or watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guarantee you.</v>

99
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.040
<v Speaker 2>One more quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my buddies told me he goes from</v>

100
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 2>the front between his smell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his balls.</v>

101
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ.</v>

102
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.820
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to have some.</v>

103
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you pay attention to all of the</v>

104
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 2>scientific research that's being done in</v>
<v Speaker 2>genetic engineering and changing?</v>

105
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.780
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

106
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.540
<v Speaker 2>Like um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually identified the dwarf gene,</v>

107
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 2>like they've been able to identify the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gene that causes dwarfism.</v>

108
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.410
<v Speaker 2>And this debate has gone on as their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the technology keeps getting closer</v>

109
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:21.130
<v Speaker 2>to the point where we can actually do</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

110
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.090
<v Speaker 2>but there's a debate going is if we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>remove that gene,</v>

111
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.780
<v Speaker 2>if we can prevent your child from having</v>
<v Speaker 2>dwarfism,</v>

112
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.973
<v Speaker 2>should we.</v>

113
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.570
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of dwarves were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

114
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:33.010
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's playing God,</v>

115
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:34.190
<v Speaker 2>it's stump up and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>

116
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm there going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

117
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.700
<v Speaker 2>you should absolutely remove it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

118
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.350
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want your kid to go</v>

119
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:42.220
<v Speaker 2>through?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

120
00:05:42.221 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 2>granted I've been lucky at like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

121
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:49.321
<v Speaker 2>I've only had like one surgery and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>made a good career with the hand that I</v>

122
00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:52.600
<v Speaker 2>was dealt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of little people I</v>

123
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:54.280
<v Speaker 2>know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that haven't,</v>

124
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 2>that don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then get constantly made of their</v>

125
00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 2>entire lives are hidden away by their</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>

126
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want your kid to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>through that and as a dwarf,</v>

127
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what struggles that you had growing up,</v>

128
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 2>why would you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you intentionally put those</v>

129
00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 2>pains on your child?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that.</v>

130
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

131
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.400
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to understand a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions that people make,</v>

132
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.650
<v Speaker 1>a lot of rationalizations that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>may.</v>

133
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

134
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.733
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

135
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.310
<v Speaker 2>like one reason that I'm able to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian and sort of have this sense of</v>

136
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:26.030
<v Speaker 2>humor about it is because my dad was</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing,</v>

137
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 2>is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I was born he found out that I</v>

138
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:34.511
<v Speaker 2>was going to be a dwarf so he would go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to these LPA little people of America</v>

139
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.050
<v Speaker 2>meetings and he would find out about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was like,</v>

140
00:06:39.051 --> 00:06:41.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my kid's gonna get made fun of a lot.</v>

141
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:45.560
<v Speaker 2>Like his life is going to be weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his philosophy was when I was growing</v>

142
00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:47.270
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would make fun of me first,</v>

143
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.780
<v Speaker 2>but he would do it in a supportive way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he would fuck with me,</v>

144
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:51.411
<v Speaker 2>but then say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

145
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.150
<v Speaker 2>I just insulted you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit me back with something,</v>

146
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.060
<v Speaker 2>hit me back and then get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because this is going to happen to you</v>

147
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:57.660
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bye.</v>

148
00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:58.670
<v Speaker 2>Was like training you.</v>

149
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by the time I got to kindergarten I</v>

150
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.020
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember kindergarten walking in in a,</v>

151
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.960
<v Speaker 2>a kid just laughing at me going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>

152
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.480
<v Speaker 2>you're little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I looked at him and went,</v>

153
00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:09.950
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mom doesn't live with your dad</v>

154
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:13.530
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And kindergarten and kindergarten and</v>

155
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.620

<v Speaker 2>I got sent to the principal's office for</v>

156
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:17.750
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hurting this kid's feelings.</v>

157
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.240
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

158
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:19.950
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.310
<v Speaker 2>and they call my deadline like we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to call your father.</v>

160
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:23.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking do it.</v>
