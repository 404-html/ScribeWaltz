so easy that I can make a website me and you can too.

14
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.520

15
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.850
wanky ask program that would make you want to pull your hair out if you have

27
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.940
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
In a way.
It shouldn't be waiting there.

28
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:55.880
If there's not,
we're fucked.
Figure it out.
We'll go.
So want,

29
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.690

57
00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:48.460
Wednesday night,
10:00 PM.
I haven't booked any people on the show yet,

58
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.030
but it will be me and a bunch of people from town.
So it's always great comics.

59
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:54.670
We have a lot of people that are funny shit that live in this area.

60
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.990
So go there and get your freak on.
Um,

61
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.060
higher primate.com is a restocked.
So all the new shit,

62
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.950
uh,
the,
uh,
run jre shirts that you see me wearing on Joe Rogan,
questions,

63
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:12.910
everything.
And,
uh,
and you know,
all the ones that have worn on the show as well.

64
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.660
The gas,
my gas mask,
monkey chimp shirt,
all that stuff.

65
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.240
Higher prime is my a tee shirt company.

66
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.080
It's all just monkeys and psychedelics.

67
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.600
The things I'm interested in most other than you,

68
00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:29.080
people I love the fuck are you guys were also brought to you by [inaudible] dot

69
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:33.460
com.
That's o.
N.
N.
I.
T.
If you haven't been there awhile,
we have,
uh,
the new,
uh,

70
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.470
Carrillo kettle bells in,
uh,

71
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.830
we also have an orangutan on the way that I just got.
I got it at home.

72
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.970
It's fucking dope.
Alicia's,
we got to this primal bell company.

73
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:47.360
We're expanding this line,
but it's,
uh,
it's quite complicated because we've,
uh,

74
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.610
decided to make these really dope looking kettle bells with these designs in

75
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:56.470
them that are also functional and balanced.
So,
um,
if you get like,

76
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.860
uh,

77
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.590
I know there's other companies that have designs that they put in Kettlebells,

78
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:03.130
but what they didn't do is make it so that the kettle bell is perfectly
balanced.

79
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.160
I think it's a very important thing.
If you're swinging around these big,

80
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:07.420
heavy fucking iron things,

81
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.900
you want to make sure that there's not some imbalance in the way you use it.

82
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.320
That would kind of defeat the purpose of having a kettle bell.

83
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.120
It should be not just a functional or not just beautiful,
but functional as well.

84
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.590
Uh,

85
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.650
so if you go there and you can check out all the different fitness equipment we

86
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:27.940
have battle ropes,
steel maces,
steel clubs,
ab wheels,

87
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
so you can get yourself a sexy six pack like Tj Dillashaw bitch we got,

88
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.620
we got medicine balls,

89
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.620
all that good shit as well as a a fuck load of supplements,

90
00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:41.710
including of course Alpha brain and shroom tech sport.

91
00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:44.410
You ever used the shroom tech sport,
right,
sir?
That's the shit.

92
00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:48.580
I love all that stuff.
T plus to get your pecker all ready for action,

93
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
go to [inaudible] dot com use the code name or Rogan and save yourself 10% of

94
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:58.010
any and all supplements.
And then it's a beautiful too.
It's fucking

95
00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.380
<v 1>lot.
A lot of cool shit there does give you a boners right?
Fucking it does.</v>

96
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.640
Absolutely increases testosterone and you're,

97
00:06:03.641 --> 00:06:05.930
you're allowed to drink on this cause I've noticed you can't do boner pills and

98
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:10.160
alcohol lately.
So I've been having a bad no,
why not?
I don't know.

99
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.610
We even something bad for your heart I think because it takes all your blood and

100
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:15.800
takes it,
puts it in your Dick and then like your heart's like,
Hey,

101
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:20.090
I don't have enough blood group to deal with this Jack Daniels science by Red

102
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.530
Band.
Yeah.
Well see red band doing a ted conference.

103
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:26.500
Basically it takes all the blood and puts it in your deck.

104
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.650
You picking your heart just explodes or something.
I don't know.

105
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.360
I just read it so I kind,
I kind of freaked out because that's what,

106
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.140
that was like the best Combo Ever Jack and you can still do it.

107
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.770
You want a lot of shit that's bad for you,
right.

108
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.180
I'll call itself is fucking terrible for you.
It's not like as a vitamin.
No,

109
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.470
he drinking until you black out four nights a week and you're worried about what

110
00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:46.910
boner pills are going to add to the equation.

111
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.330
I just wanted to have teeth will give me the same kind of rock hard boner.

112
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.100
I don't know what you did in a past life,

113
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:55.400
but you're almost fucking 40 you look like you're 12 and you're getting hammered

114
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:58.040
every night.
He got great genes.
Don't worry about it.

115
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:00.020
Just take a multivitamin every now and then.

116
00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:03.260
If you remember and keep riding until the fucking wheels fall off.

117
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.660
Don't worry about it.
Pitch.
We're here for a long time.
Don't worry.

118
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.920
Did I talked to Ray Kurzweil?
It's all gonna work out.
Alright.
Freaks.

119
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.670
Duane Ludwig,
Tj Dillashaw.
Both are in the building right now.

120
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.050
Enough with the commercials.

121
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.040
We're trying to shorten them down for your amusement.
So there,
that's the end.

122
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.400
And there's one more.
Dwayne Bang,

123

Hit it

all day.

127
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.290
It's actually better if you ever have anything to promote if you promoted after

128
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:50.300
the music because that's when it goes on.
Serious,

129
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.720
serious takes all this shit before the music and just puts it out there.

130
00:07:53.721 --> 00:07:56.060
So I don't want to do with it.
Serious secret.
They throw it away.

131
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.060
Sometimes our best work was done before we even get started.

132
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.820
So then where do they go for us?
We got shirts are wearing,

139
00:08:26.481 --> 00:08:30.920
fighter to being a professional coach.
And a for folks who don't know,
Dwayne,
uh,

140
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.670
for a long time had fastest knockout in UFC history was tried.

141
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.920
They tried to deny you,
but we would not let them.

142
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.260
We forced that shit down their throat.
They will.

143
00:08:39.261 --> 00:08:42.500
They were trying to give it to a,
to Todd Duffy who had a very fast knockout,

144
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.370
no doubt about it was pretty close,
but you still had them.
You edge them.

145
00:08:46.371 --> 00:08:49.820
But the referee fucked up,
you know,
they gave it to you like 10 seconds,

146
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:53.390
but it's really like six right on the clock is at four.

147
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.940
But there for the duration of the balance from the bell sounds to the rest of

148
00:08:57.941 --> 00:09:02.370
the start or a fight and then told one of the refs or to the ref touches one of

149
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:06.720
the opponents.
Right.
So from start to touch,
that's what we count.
Correct.
Okay.

150
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:11.060
So even if the bell rings before,
so they start just the bell ringing,

151
00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.550
the beginning boxing it used to,
it doesn't,
but then my may.
Right.

152
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:17.930
And just say fine.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't even know how the fuck do I not know.

153
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.470
Why don't we hear him?
I don't hear if Tj [inaudible].
Here we go.
Try it again.

154
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.660
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm,
we usually too amped up to even hear a bell.

155
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.530
Do you hear when you're out there,
do you hear Dwayne in your corner cheering it?

156
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.870
Yeah,
I can hear him.
I can hear Justin buckles usually the most,

157
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:33.840
cause he's real loud and he's always in my corner.
And then Duane as well.
Yeah.

158
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.910
So that's all you hear.
Just that.

159
00:09:35.911 --> 00:09:38.610
And then the rest is just noise for the most part.

160
00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:41.250
I mean you can hear like when the crowd gets excited,
you kind of hear that.

161
00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:42.720
But you know,
you don't pay attention to it.
You know,

162
00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:45.540
you just kinda try to focus in what you're supposed to.

163
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:50.040
Have you ever been in a fight where they booed?
No,
that's a weird moment,
right?

164
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.370
When when dudes are not doing anything and you know that they can hear it,

165
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:57.500
you know,
because there's never a boo during a wild scramble.
Right.

166
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.250
And the wild scrambles,

167
00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:02.430
I would imagine the ones where you have the least memory of what the fuck is

168
00:10:02.431 --> 00:10:05.520
going on,
like sound wise,
just saw.
So like tuned into it.
Right.

169
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.580
So it was what you asked me if we hear them booing.
Yeah.
Oh yeah,
I have.

170
00:10:08.581 --> 00:10:11.790
I've heard both for sure.
100%.
Do you,

171
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.700
do you feel responsibility when you hear that?
Like what's your feeling?

172
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.310
A little bit.
Just depends on the game plan on the fight and what's going on.

173
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.481
Yeah.
And you know,

174
00:10:18.481 --> 00:10:21.960
cause sometimes the game plan couldn't be to just sit back and let him come to

175
00:10:21.961 --> 00:10:24.900
us and you know,
let her go,
you know,
and I go fuck Lynn.
Right,
right,
right.

176
00:10:24.901 --> 00:10:27.690
Kind of me running into some stupid,
that's sweet.
So it could be like,

177
00:10:27.691 --> 00:10:29.810
like who's who's going to crack first?

178
00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.150
Like who's going to give to these Bu's and do something stupid that gets off of

179
00:10:33.151 --> 00:10:33.840
their game.

180
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.960
That's the main thing with these fires of myself is to control our own emotions.

181
00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:38.640
Cause if you don't control us,
how are we going to control them?

182
00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.100
And that's just one of those things.
If the crowd's going to boo and you know,

183
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.510
make this guy make a stupid mistake or to finally come in or you know,

184
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:48.490
coming to our game plan or whatever the scenario may be,
then sweet.
No,

185
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:50.190
let the crowd dictate what he's going to do and the,

186
00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:52.740
hopefully he makes a mistake,
let him run to us.
We keep our composure,

187
00:10:52.741 --> 00:10:55.890
we stick to the game plan and adjust on the fly.
We make things happen.
You know,

188
00:10:55.891 --> 00:11:00.510
I'm an unusual MMA fan and that I've probably seen like live,

189
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.560
I've seen,
you know,
more than a thousand fights and had to call them.

190
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.010
So I've been involved in so many different scenarios,

191
00:11:08.011 --> 00:11:12.900
so many fights watching it play out like classic all time,
great MMA fights.

192
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.960
I've had the honor to call,
but I,
I,

193
00:11:15.961 --> 00:11:18.990
I'm different in that I like boring styles,
man.

194
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:24.230
I like a dude who takes no damage and smothers guys and just imposes his will.

195
00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:28.470
Like a lot of people used to give John Fitch a hard time.
I swear to God,

196
00:11:28.471 --> 00:11:31.590
John Fitch to one of my favorite fighters to watch and people will yell at me,

197
00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:35.190
they're like,
you're the fucking idiot.
He's ruining MMA or Ben Aspirin,

198
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.950
same thing Ben asking is one of my favorite fighters to watch,

199
00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:42.420
gives Ben aspirins a fucking glove.
He just wraps a hold of you.

200
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.740
That's real.
Okay.
He's stifling,
really exciting,

201
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.320
energetic strikers.
I mean like who is it is a,

202
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.090
was that fucking guy that he fought the fucking hardcore striker

203
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:54.933
<v 0>recently.</v>

204
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.170
He fought this Russian dude and then before it he fought that guy that vice did

205
00:11:59.171 --> 00:12:03.100
a piece on him,
a line.
Lyle,
what the fuck is,
he says,
I have no idea.

206
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.700
God Damn and I'm not up on Bella tour too much to pay attention.

207
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.120
I'll find the gentleman's,
the aspirins gotta be so strong,
man,

208
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.540
that guy's got to be unbelievably strong,
strong.

209
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.010
He seems to always be in the right place.
Yeah.

210
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.440
You know like these positioning is,
and it's also,
his paths are so weird.

211
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.360
Like usually when I'm watching a guy rolled,

212
00:12:22.361 --> 00:12:25.450
like say like here's a real easy example of the guy's like a blue belt on the

213
00:12:25.451 --> 00:12:29.140
ground and I'm watching this transition from like take down to like make an

214
00:12:29.141 --> 00:12:31.960
amount of trying to make a mount or trying to get site control.

215
00:12:31.961 --> 00:12:35.200
I can see what he's doing and I see it real obvious but with,
and I'm like,

216
00:12:35.201 --> 00:12:38.800
why is he grabbing?
Oh,
that arm,
oh,
what the fuck?
How did he get there?

217
00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.720
It's like he's doing this weird shit.

218
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.170
He's like going behind guys and getting under hooks on their back arm and

219
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.000
fucking wrenching them in weird ways that tying their legs up and he's,

220
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:50.770
he's always in a weird spot.

221
00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:53.890
So you can't have this mother fucker off you if you watch any of his wrestling

222
00:12:53.891 --> 00:12:58.360
matches 100% that he was like,
nothing like super technical but a funky guy.

223
00:12:58.361 --> 00:12:59.380
Like he'd everything funky.

224
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.950
Well I think in his technical it's just technical in his way.
Exactly.

225
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.940
And so it's not like he doesn't know what he's doing.

226
00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:06.520
He's like super successful at it.

227
00:13:06.521 --> 00:13:09.730
It's not like he's just this guy that's sort of making up karate,
you know,

228
00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:13.120
like we've all seen those kung fu videos where dudes are just making shit up.

229
00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.120
You know,
I've gotten the mad at me before shit all the time,

230
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:17.990
but I mean this is a different kind of making shit up.

231
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:19.900
Like the guy throws a punch walk right here.

232
00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:22.570
I tacked the liver with a monkey paws,
you know,

233
00:13:22.571 --> 00:13:25.030
and they're like talking about different techniques that they do where you can

234
00:13:25.031 --> 00:13:28.230
tell literally while they're doing it,
they're making it up as they go up.

235
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.800
You said it then,
the show on that,
Joe,

236
00:13:29.801 --> 00:13:32.080
I can't believe you didn't do a fake Kung Fu big conflict.

237
00:13:32.081 --> 00:13:34.870
That would have been fun.
As Fun.
I think if we did a second season,

238
00:13:34.871 --> 00:13:38.080
that is one I would want to do those,
those dudes who do the crazy touches,

239
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.430
like if you ever seen the videos of the Kung Fu masters who just throw people

240
00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:46.120
through the air with your hands,
there's a ghetto one where this,
this uh,

241
00:13:46.121 --> 00:13:49.030
this dude and he,
I don't know what it is,
but it's,
it's a very,

242
00:13:49.031 --> 00:13:52.000
he's a very ghetto looking character.
I mean,
not just because he's black,

243
00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.420
but just the way he's black,
you know,
I'm talking about,
I mean,

244
00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:59.170
the whole thing is it's a ghetto environment.
I mean,
he's not an Idaho.
Okay.

245
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:00.190
And he's,

246
00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:05.190
he's the row in these Kung Fu moves to these people and he's got them shaking

247
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.100
like,
like exaggerated,
like wobbling back and forth.

248
00:14:09.101 --> 00:14:12.760
Like they're hit getting hit by a pulse from a movie.
And you're like,

249
00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:17.740
what is going on here is,
are they crazy?
Like,
is this a,
is this massive doses?

250
00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:21.400
Is this just a big scam or z really have magic power?

251
00:14:21.401 --> 00:14:22.750
Like those are the possibilities.

252
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:26.650
I had a guy on this week's episode of Joe Rogan questions.

253
00:14:26.651 --> 00:14:30.580
Everything who said that he can make people fart in church is that he,

254
00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:34.180
he reverses the net.
He was hilarious.

255
00:14:34.181 --> 00:14:36.770
He's the guy was fucking hilarious.
Um,

256
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
but he stood there and at one point in time he said he could get me to move back

257
00:14:42.491 --> 00:14:45.760
and forth with his mind.
And he like tried to get me to,

258
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.640
I'm not going to tell you if it worked or it didn't work.
It didn't fucking work.

259
00:14:48.641 --> 00:14:52.220
Of course didn't work.
Fuck is wrong with you.
Jesus Christ.

260
00:14:52.221 --> 00:14:56.330
I couldn't lie to you like that.
Uh,
but the dude was convinced that he and I was,

261
00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.410
while he's doing,
I was like,

262
00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.890
what am I just given his guy and start moving and I can't believe I'm doing it?

263
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.850
Like what if I had to like stand firm?
I had to make sure,
I'm like,

264
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.120
I'm not fucking going anywhere.
This shit is not working on me.

265
00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.750
But if you were like a person who is easily led,

266
00:15:11.751 --> 00:15:13.160
like maybe the type of person who would be,

267
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:17.930
who join a cult type of person who like loses themselves and another person's

268
00:15:17.931 --> 00:15:21.860
influence,
which is a real psychological dilemma.
Like the reason why cults work.

269
00:15:21.861 --> 00:15:24.140
Like if you look,
look in the newspaper and you hear about some crazy,

270
00:15:24.141 --> 00:15:27.120
call it where the,
the guy's fucking all the girls and you know,

271
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.230
it's got 13 year old wives and shit and 50 of them.
You Go,

272
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:33.890
how the hell did that happen?
It we don't know.
But it happens.

273
00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:36.480
There's people that just fall under the spell.

274
00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:41.120
So when you see someone doing that fucking crazy cheese shit and making people

275
00:15:41.121 --> 00:15:45.460
fly through the air,
it's like,
wow,
like what's happening here?
Yeah,

276
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.830
it gets going back to like job pitch and aspirin.
Just have x,
you know,
all,

277
00:15:49.831 --> 00:15:51.320
you know,
we all know we don't know everything,

278
00:15:51.321 --> 00:15:54.480
but you got a lot more Marshall's information.
You understand what's going on,

279
00:15:54.481 --> 00:15:57.910
you understand the scenario.
People are still stuck in the mind frame to see him.

280
00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.730
Bloody wars.
So bossy.
I mean,
I admit that I'm,
I'm,
I'm,

281
00:16:01.731 --> 00:16:06.320
I'm very unusual and then I'm more than willing to watch some boring shit if it

282
00:16:06.321 --> 00:16:10.490
has a potential of getting exciting,
even if it gets through the entire fight.

283
00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:11.960
And then like in the third round,

284
00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:16.400
dude figures out how to stuff to take down and lands a big shot.
Oh,
shadow or,

285
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.650
or Fitch gets his back and starts to put them away.

286
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:23.540
If it takes all this like 50% punches for three fucking rounds until there's an

287
00:16:23.541 --> 00:16:28.280
explosive moment.
I liked that.
I liked that because I know that that guy,

288
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.700
the guy in the bottom does not want that to be happening,
but yet it's happening.

289
00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.560
So that's real.
That's why I fucking hate standups.
And people be like,
you know,

290
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.330
man stood up to fucking,
you know,

291
00:16:37.331 --> 00:16:40.280
you're going to fucking protect the sports sports socks if everybody's just

292
00:16:40.281 --> 00:16:44.470
going to blink and hump.
No,
no,
that guy doesn't want to get blanket hop.

293
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.550
Do you understand that?
Like that is real.

294
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:50.120
You can't deny that that dude is holding that motherfucker down.

295
00:16:50.121 --> 00:16:54.170
You can't deny it.
You can't just make them stand up if it's boring.
Tough Shit.

296
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.260
Tough Shit.
Get off the bottom.
I'm in favor of standups.
I should've saved me

297
00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:03.930
if it wasn't for that.
[inaudible]
so I'm off for the standup

298
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:10.250
world.
Moy Thai champion,
one of the most technical strikers ever in MMA.

299
00:17:10.251 --> 00:17:14.220
So of course you love the stand your ground games,
no joke,
but you're,
you're,

300
00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.590
you're,
you know,
obviously you have a big advantage.
We have a big advantage.

301
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.410
You always had a big technical advantage.
Like,
um,
um,

302
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:26.420
Amir from tough Marcella.
Yeah.
He,

303
00:17:26.421 --> 00:17:30.110
he's a very like,
very good,
more tie fighter.

304
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:34.580
And that fight that you had with him was amazing because it was a perfect

305
00:17:34.581 --> 00:17:36.500
example of your technical,

306
00:17:36.501 --> 00:17:41.501
like he fought you in your world and there was just this clear technique

307
00:17:41.631 --> 00:17:44.510
advantage,
like,
like the stuff that you were trying to show me today,

308
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:49.540
you like about movement and about throwing punches and closing distance and

309
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.370
being in the right ear and about really small spaces.
You leave the littlest,

310
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:56.440
one of the things you kept saying put your hands by your face.
If you don't,

311
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.830
then my hands would be at your face.
Which one would you like more?

312
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.530
It's like really simple,
really simple,
but very tactical.

313
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:05.550
And that like showed itself in that fight.
Cause a mirror is a very competent,

314
00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:08.340
he's a very good fighter,
you know?
But you caught them early.

315
00:18:08.341 --> 00:18:09.240
I think it was a left hook.

316
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.900
You heard him with a left hook and then you opened it up and then from that on

317
00:18:12.901 --> 00:18:15.720
he was like,
you were just taking your shots.
It was your fight.

318
00:18:15.721 --> 00:18:20.370
You were dictating the dance.
I love watching that man.
I,
you know,
I don't,

319
00:18:20.371 --> 00:18:23.850
I don't need a knockout.
I appreciate knockouts.
Absolutely.

320
00:18:23.851 --> 00:18:26.550
But I also appreciate people shutting people down.

321
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:31.230
I appreciate when a guy is like,
you know,
a mighty mouse,

322
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.000
you know,
used to get that rap,

323
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:37.380
but it was really just because he was fighting guys like Ian Mccall or because

324
00:18:37.381 --> 00:18:41.160
he was fighting guys like Benevidez if fighting really fucking tough guys,

325
00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:43.890
you're not going to put these guys away.
But you know,

326
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:45.550
we saw in his last fight against Moraga,

327
00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:50.310
he's still trying to finish it like always.
And so like that fight,

328
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:54.300
like he beat Moraga for four rounds before he finished him,

329
00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.030
but he's still finished.
I'm like,
he was,
he was beating him clearly,

330
00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.760
but he still took them out.
If the finished didn't happen,

331
00:18:59.761 --> 00:19:02.340
there'd be a lot of people that say,
oh,
I don't like watching mighty mouse fight.

332
00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:05.520
You know,
it's fucking boring.
But no,
that's not boring at all.
It's awesome.

333
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.800
You just got to understand what you're watching art.
Right?

334
00:19:07.801 --> 00:19:10.510
They're educated though.
Yeah.
I got hit once.
Yeah.

335
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.510
I mean literally got caught once,

336
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:16.890
one big shot in the fourth round and worked his way through it with no problem.

337
00:19:16.891 --> 00:19:19.650
It's knows as fucking bleeding mean Maraca can bang.

338
00:19:19.651 --> 00:19:21.210
And he caught that dude right on the chin.

339
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.630
So when you're dealing with is like he's a perfect specimen,
he's got everything,

340
00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.330
he's got technique,
he's got heart,
he's got intelligence,

341
00:19:27.331 --> 00:19:30.180
he always comes in and shape and he tries to finish the fight.

342
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.010
It's a fucking champion.
I mean mighty mouse is a fucking champion.
Great.

343
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.820
But I've heard people say,
oh,

344
00:19:35.821 --> 00:19:38.890
you're going to work watching those little guys food and we don't even finish.

345
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.740
You said you don't even want to know what you're talking about.

346
00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:42.960
You're just watching the best guys go at it.

347
00:19:42.961 --> 00:19:46.260
And a lot of times they neutralize each other because the level of technique is

348
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:50.160
so fucking high at one 25 and one 35 Tj,

349
00:19:50.161 --> 00:19:53.700
where you fight that fucking level of technique is through the roof.
A man

350
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:56.520
<v 2>[inaudible] that's what,
that's a fun thing here at tema familiar here,</v>

351
00:19:56.521 --> 00:19:58.650
but they're in Timothy Medal.
You know,

352
00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:01.110
everyone's been pointing finger me like come the secret pill and everything.

353
00:20:01.111 --> 00:20:04.500
But I have world class athletes,
hundred percent world class athletes.

354
00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.340
They don't get any better than these guys.
You know,

355
00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.670
now they have what I feel is the proper information.

356
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.730
So here he got proper proper information with world class athletes.

357
00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.370
They really have no choice but to get better.
It's pretty simple stuff,
you know,

358
00:20:14.371 --> 00:20:17.810
and just like you did over the private today,
just simple,
basic stuff.
Newtown,

359
00:20:17.811 --> 00:20:20.640
they understanding what they're doing and why they're doing it so they can

360
00:20:20.641 --> 00:20:21.331
branch off from there.

361
00:20:21.331 --> 00:20:23.970
But I'm definitely making sure that I'm tailoring to the athlete.

362
00:20:23.971 --> 00:20:25.200
I'm not going to make them Duane Ludwig.

363
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:27.510
I want to make them better athletes from themselves,
you know?
But here's,

364
00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.240
here's the correct way.
Okay,
you can make that way work.
Okay?

365
00:20:30.241 --> 00:20:31.950
You can make it work.
Okay,
good.
Let's make it work.

366
00:20:31.951 --> 00:20:34.680
Then add that to the system that that's your style.
Cool.
I'll adapt to you.

367
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.280
But just something like mighty mouse.
Can you teach somebody to be mighty mouse?

368
00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:41.550
Some of the aspects,
but not all of it.
He's got to be as on athlete.

369
00:20:41.551 --> 00:20:43.440
We're all individual athletes.
Just like your sidekick today,

370
00:20:43.441 --> 00:20:45.690
and he's spinning kicks who are world class,
you know?

371
00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.010
And that can be taught because we would take a million reps,

372
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.670
<v 1>but correct reps as well and pay attention.</v>

373
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.940
People have to know what they're doing and don't have to do it.

374
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.850
It's one of the things that Eddie Bravo is stresses about certain guard

375
00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:57.550
techniques.
They're like,
well,
I keep doing it.
People keep breaking out of it.

376
00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:59.830
Well,
when you learn like a wheel kick,

377
00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.350
you don't learn how to nail people with it every time.

378
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.540
Most of the time you're gonna miss you going,
oh,
this doesn't work.

379
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.240
And then you'll get in there with Uriah hall or somewhere that level and then

380
00:21:07.241 --> 00:21:10.700
we'll kick you in the face.
You Go,
oh my God,
this is the craziest technique ever.

381
00:21:10.701 --> 00:21:12.500
It's a guaranteed knockout.
Me,

382
00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.820
you literally hitting a guy with your whole fucking body behind a heel.

383
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.650
They go hard.
You goddamn he'll is.
I mean,

384
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:19.270
people break their knuckles all the time.

385
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.510
You ever break a heel now you don't break your healed.

386
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.660
So God damn hammer at the bottom of your foot and it's carrying your body wait

387
00:21:25.661 --> 00:21:27.910
around all day and the amount of force it you could fuck.

388
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.910
But I ain't going to work right away.
You've got to learn how to do it.

389
00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:31.900
It's like everything else,

390
00:21:31.901 --> 00:21:35.530
like you got to do the reps until you get to that black belt level it,

391
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.460
and they're like,
there's some techniques that guys can do a in Jujitsu,

392
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.870
and the reason they can do it,
the reason why I think it,

393
00:21:41.871 --> 00:21:43.660
like if a guy gets a nasty Darce,

394
00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:46.750
like some people get Darcy and their arms a burnout and I never finish them.

395
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.880
But then there's those dudes that have that fucking razor Darce,
you know?

396
00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:52.140
Oh yeah.

397
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.700
And they clamp that pitch down and you'd know you're not getting out of that

398
00:21:54.701 --> 00:21:57.910
motherfucker because they put insane amount of reps into it.

399
00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:02.440
And so even though the movement may look similar to someone who's not educated

400
00:22:02.441 --> 00:22:04.420
in it,
when you're watching it,
if you know,

401
00:22:04.421 --> 00:22:08.020
like a guy who really closes off something really good,
you go,
oh shit.
Like,

402
00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.920
like Marcello Garcia.
If you were watching them roll with his gay teen,

403
00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:12.850
I didn't know anybody could close off again,

404
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:17.070
taking that quick until I saw him do it like you're riot faber has on Nassy Gat,

405
00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:21.110
so it's been a veto as all you guys at team Alpha male have sicky teens.

406
00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:26.130
It's like you're known for it but there's like a 16th of a second quicker that

407
00:22:26.291 --> 00:22:28.960
Marcella was slap it on than anybody.
You know what I mean?

408
00:22:28.961 --> 00:22:32.800
Where it's like you recognize like Uriah has a worldclass guillotine and that

409
00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:33.643
that shit is,

410
00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:38.530
it's like vice grip but like you watch him do and you watch Marcello and he's

411
00:22:38.531 --> 00:22:40.150
like,
oh he's on another level,

412
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:44.020
but this is one of the fucker's got a like a 16th of a second quicker closure or

413
00:22:44.021 --> 00:22:48.460
something like that.
There's like just,
just a little bit of it,
lock it up.

414
00:22:48.461 --> 00:22:51.040
Like he,
he taps guides and I'd never see good tab.

415
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.300
Like we're talking about aspirin.

416
00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:56.320
There's a fantastic video of Marcello rolling with aspirin and just manhandling

417
00:22:56.321 --> 00:22:59.920
them.
Just tapping and tapping and tapping and tapping them.
Like he would tap,

418
00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:01.180
you know,
like anybody.

419
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.050
And it's crazy when you know how good a wrestler aspirin is.

420
00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.730
There's so many weird levels to this.
That's the thing,

421
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.800
especially with this level of athletes in the UFC,

422
00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.350
we're dealing split seconds and fractions of an inch,
you know,

423
00:23:11.351 --> 00:23:13.960
like shit's got to be perfect but perfect.
It's just making,

424
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.010
having you land that striking that could hit you hit and don't get hit.

425
00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.380
We're good,
you know,
but we're dealing split fucking seconds.

426
00:23:19.381 --> 00:23:24.270
So that's just the way it's got to be.
What a crazy,
exciting job you act
like,

427
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.140
you know,
going from,
you know,
I've been,
you know,

428
00:23:26.141 --> 00:23:30.130
training full board since I was 15 I'm 35 so it's been 20 years,
you know,
career.

429
00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.290
But I've been training people it since I was 19 anyway.

430
00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.590
And I've always understood the game,
kind of broke it down as I,

431
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:37.210
it's been self taught a lot.
Although like Trevor Whitman went,

432
00:23:37.211 --> 00:23:38.880
boxing coach showed me a lot.
Bas Rutten,

433
00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:41.620
he's been my main contributor to my arts as well.

434
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.710
And then I've trended on Mike Winkeljohn and Greg Jackson to cross paths with

435
00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.180
million.
You know a lot of people,
Japan,

436
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.530
<v 2>Thailand,
Holland,
right turn,</v>

437
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.870
Ramon Dekkers for two weeks and I cross paths with a lot of people.

438
00:23:50.871 --> 00:23:54.260
But a lot of my stuff is just self taught from DVDs and Youtube and the
Internet.

439
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:57.560
So I've been able to break things down my stuff because I had to learn it
myself.

440
00:23:57.561 --> 00:23:59.070
And then teaching people,
like I took,

441
00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:02.450
I took the pads game and Trevor Whitman until I'm like,
this is,

442
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.410
I know how to hold pads for me.
This is what it needs you to look out for.

443
00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:09.950
So I taught him to train me.
So because of that and that he's,
he's an artist,

444
00:24:09.951 --> 00:24:12.320
the guy can draw.
He just very detailed,
very analytical.

445
00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.080
So that transferred back over to me.
So we were just a good relationship.

446
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.000
And then I had another guy,
Christian Allen,

447
00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.670
and that guy is the best met hoarder I've ever seen,
ever worked with.

448
00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:23.480
That guy can hold some fricking miss and he is a Ninja.
If he had,

449
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.960
if he believed in himself a bit more,

450
00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:30.170
he could be the UFC champion 100% it's just some guys just have it physically,

451
00:24:30.171 --> 00:24:32.790
just not so much mentally.
And that's a good thing here too.
My phone.

452
00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.810
These guys are all world class athletes.
The wrestling mentality,

453
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.490
I don't have to babysit anybody.
Do they come in?

454
00:24:37.491 --> 00:24:40.430
They put in the Rick that putting in the work,
the quality reps,

455
00:24:40.431 --> 00:24:42.710
they help each other because Tony today we,
we're drilling,
you know,

456
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:45.410
we're building the counter,
I looking for the openings before,

457
00:24:45.411 --> 00:24:47.850
during and after there's openings.
Where are they at?
Let's register them.

458
00:24:47.851 --> 00:24:50.210
They see the idiosyncrasies.
What are they doing?
They're nervous.

459
00:24:50.211 --> 00:24:52.160
What does their position?
It's one,
keep them get positioned.

460
00:24:52.161 --> 00:24:54.920
So they're just a bunch of little small things.
It's not,
it's nothing.

461
00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.660
No magic pill.
Just simple basic stuff.

462
00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:00.110
Reiterating a million times correctly from the get go.

463
00:25:00.111 --> 00:25:02.350
So that's one thing I've learned from boss,
from Trevor Women,

464
00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.480
from all my travels is to break things down cause I'm not a super athletic guy.

465
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:08.600
So I've had to learn things from tentacle aspect and breaking them down.

466
00:25:08.601 --> 00:25:10.940
So that they've worked for,
he said,
Take Eddie Bravo story.
Say he's not,
you know,

467
00:25:10.941 --> 00:25:12.860
a great athlete so you can kind of break things down.

468
00:25:12.861 --> 00:25:17.330
But that's another thing too with Jujitsu and Thai boxing you just do is slower.

469
00:25:17.331 --> 00:25:20.530
It's a slower pace thing.
And then also the mental aspect,
you know,
you're not,

470
00:25:20.531 --> 00:25:22.670
I can punch in the face,
you can relax a little bit.
You know,

471
00:25:22.671 --> 00:25:24.470
if you get caught an armbar triangle,
you're going to tap,

472
00:25:24.471 --> 00:25:27.920
you have more seconds to respond.
You know,
you're not going to die in striking.

473
00:25:27.921 --> 00:25:29.740
People still freak out.
People don't like to get punched.

474
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:30.980
I don't like to get punched in the face,

475
00:25:30.981 --> 00:25:33.680
but it takes a certain human being to go ahead and relax it.
But that composure,

476
00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.120
so I can take a guy and a technique or a jor combination and then he could spar

477
00:25:38.121 --> 00:25:40.070
with it.
Well,
how about between the,

478
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.680
the myths and the sparring that that's a pretty big gap.

479
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:43.820
How are we going to do with that gap?

480
00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.460
We're going to do this drill with a little bit of sparring.
Okay,

481
00:25:46.461 --> 00:25:49.220
now you can punch,
but uh,
you can't kick things like that.

482
00:25:49.221 --> 00:25:50.510
Would it break it down into pieces.

483
00:25:50.511 --> 00:25:52.520
We're adding a little bit of heat to the flame,
you know,

484
00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:54.230
little bit more slower and slower.

485
00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:57.210
And that's what these guys have great fucking technique and great control is

486
00:25:57.211 --> 00:25:58.250
nothing.
Why wrestling get,
you know,

487
00:25:58.251 --> 00:26:00.710
people get so good at resting cause they can relax,

488
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.450
they can relax that I can punch in the face.

489
00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.250
Well let's not punch him in the face so hard.

490
00:26:04.251 --> 00:26:06.830
So I have a million drills for these guys to work with and it's just,

491
00:26:06.831 --> 00:26:09.140
it's simple,
easy,
basic stuff man.
I just,
and again,

492
00:26:09.141 --> 00:26:12.620
I love my job and the add kicks in and I jumped around a conversation.
So it's a,

493
00:26:12.621 --> 00:26:13.454
it's good magic.

494
00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.430
<v 0>Those donor stand,
what you're talking about as far as Mitt work,</v>

495
00:26:16.431 --> 00:26:17.550
what meant work is,

496
00:26:17.551 --> 00:26:21.140
is when a guy holds the pads for you and you get the pads correct.
And uh,

497
00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:25.710
there's all a lot to it.
There's a lot to getting a guy to do it correctly.

498
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:28.860
There's a lot to getting a guy that does it in,
you know,

499
00:26:28.861 --> 00:26:33.060
like making you throw combinations that are like realistic combinations at work.

500
00:26:33.061 --> 00:26:34.200
Good or work with you.

501
00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:38.220
A guy who can take power shots to the arms cause you know when you're kicking

502
00:26:38.221 --> 00:26:40.710
the shit out of a fucking pads guys get bad elbows.

503
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.980
I mean after awhile ago you have be strong as shit.

504
00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:45.990
<v 1>That's what the,
I had two is the hyperflex is from uh,</v>

505
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.520
just being relaxed and receiving kicks in.

506
00:26:47.521 --> 00:26:50.040
I have my elbows just come back to far and that I cross body and half card.

507
00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:51.250
You know,
how am I on my arm?

508
00:26:51.251 --> 00:26:54.660
Just going to switch my last few fights I couldn't spark cause if a punch came

509
00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:57.860
and hyperflex mobiles they would just swell up and it would just hurt like the

510
00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.540
timing and things like it would just slip the demission cause I'm not actually

511
00:27:00.541 --> 00:27:02.070
doing the live drilling,
the life sparring.

512
00:27:02.071 --> 00:27:05.340
So things just kind of doing what the way in my few last few fights and just

513
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.920
wasn't able to perform to the way I want it to.
Plus,

514
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:10.470
like the passionate sash wasn't really there for fighting,

515
00:27:10.471 --> 00:27:13.270
so it's just perfect timing and you know,
blessed the knee and you know,
you're,

516
00:27:13.271 --> 00:27:14.610
I had text me,
you want to come train us.

517
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:17.770
And it was a situation where you just done it for so long.

518
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.040
I don't have the enthusiasm for this anymore.

519
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:24.540
You still have the enthusiasm for the creative aspect of developing a fighter.

520
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.630
Yeah.
I love,
I'm a martial arts.
This is what I've done my whole life.
I love it.

521
00:27:27.631 --> 00:27:31.200
I love living through these guys now.
It's just,
it's a rebirth for me.
It's just,

522
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.600
it's,
I'm loving my life,
embracing it too.

523
00:27:33.601 --> 00:27:36.540
I think it's really cool when a fighter or find something that he can do that's

524
00:27:36.541 --> 00:27:40.140
equally exciting like right after their careers because that's always been

525
00:27:40.141 --> 00:27:43.380
traditionally I'll real problem for all sorts of professional fighters,

526
00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.690
whether it's boxers or MMA fighters.

527
00:27:45.691 --> 00:27:49.230
There's always been those stories of guys who like live this crazy high life and

528
00:27:49.231 --> 00:27:52.540
then afterwards like do you know how many boxers get hooked on cocaine?
No,

529
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:57.480
it's a lot,
man.
It's a fucking lot.
I'm obviously,
they're partying and obviously,

530
00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:01.080
you know,
a lot of these guys are coming from lower income backgrounds,

531
00:28:01.081 --> 00:28:02.930
so when all of a sudden they're making millions of millions of dollars,

532
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.990
they did tend to get a little crazy.
But the after effects of,

533
00:28:06.991 --> 00:28:10.440
of like losing all that excitement,
like it's gone from your life.

534
00:28:10.441 --> 00:28:14.910
Like there's very few guys that will transfer from that into becoming like

535
00:28:14.911 --> 00:28:17.530
really good trainers.
Yeah,
that's a different scenario than me.
I don't,

536
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:21.750
I've never made millions of dollars and I sold drive a fucking 2006 scion xb

537
00:28:21.751 --> 00:28:23.610
with windshield on a hole in the seat.
You know,

538
00:28:23.611 --> 00:28:26.700
I never made $1 million in the last few fights.
I was contract the FC,

539
00:28:26.701 --> 00:28:28.650
it was like 15 and 15 you know,
so it was making,

540
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:30.370
I didn't win the last couple fights,
so I walked away.

541
00:28:30.371 --> 00:28:33.240
We don't have to sponsors like 20 grand and then,
you know,
pat my percentages.

542
00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:36.030
So I had never made good money.
I've never broken six figures.

543
00:28:36.031 --> 00:28:37.940
So it's a different scenario.
But that's,

544
00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.350
I'm going to have the passion and I could live to these guys,
you know,

545
00:28:40.351 --> 00:28:42.470
in the cage and just watching them and,
you know,

546
00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.440
having them when it makes me feel like,
excuse me,
he's still relevant in life,

547
00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.960
even mean necessarily the,
I mean,
part of it was the,

548
00:28:48.961 --> 00:28:51.440
their success making the money,
but it was also just,
uh,
you know,

549
00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:52.590
they're wild dudes.

550
00:28:52.591 --> 00:28:56.740
And then once they lose that ability to get that crazy fix every few months
from,

551
00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:58.250
uh,
a fight,
it's,

552
00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:01.800
it's really hard for a fighter to find something that they can throw their

553
00:29:01.801 --> 00:29:05.070
passion into that makes them feel like their life is still,
you know,

554
00:29:05.071 --> 00:29:06.870
there's still like living their lives in the hills.

555
00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.630
That's what I think about Duane duty a,
he'll be a passion about anything.

556
00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.840
I don't care if it's walking down the street,
he's going gonna be the best at it.

557
00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.450
He's,
do you hear,
um,
Mike,
uh,

558
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:19.890
passenger air from Mike's gym when he was talking about my training?
Uh,
Allister,

559
00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:20.813
Allister Overeem.

560
00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:23.350
One of the things he said that I thought it was really interesting and like the,

561
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:27.080
the pre fight a,
you know,
ream,
he does those documentaries,
those are sweet.

562
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.860
They're bad ass.
Whoever does those are an artist.

563
00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.730
The music's great scenes are really artistically scene.

564
00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:37.410
But Bet Mike said,
you know,
champion and he say fuck champion.

565
00:29:37.411 --> 00:29:41.040
No matter what he does when he's tying his shoes,
he's a champion.
He's champion.

566
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:41.950
When he gets out of bed,

567
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.790
<v 0>he's a jumping in when he brushed his teeth.
But exactly.
It's right.
You know,</v>

568
00:29:45.791 --> 00:29:50.380
like that mentality,
like t to really hit the highest levels of something,

569
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:54.280
you know,
you have to be like,
that's,
that's all you accept or not alive.

570
00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:57.420
<v 2>That's I am.
I'm very black and white.
I tried to do anything.
I don't try.</v>

571
00:29:57.421 --> 00:29:59.580
I do everything to my full potential with whatever I do.

572
00:29:59.581 --> 00:30:02.610
It's just the way I'm wired.
It's how I've been at ever wasn't really taught.

573
00:30:02.611 --> 00:30:06.000
This is just how I am so know who to think.
I guess our creator who are May,

574
00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:09.810
whatever it is.
But I mean,
I love everything that I do.
It's good times,
man.

575
00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:14.210
<v 0>Well,
it's also you,
you've become successful as a martial artist and you,</v>

576
00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.950
you were very successful as a kickboxer and very successful as an MMA fighter.

577
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:21.490
So you know,
after all these years of competition,

578
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:25.000
exactly what fighters are going through,
you know,
you know what I mean?

579
00:30:25.001 --> 00:30:26.560
You're not guessing it.
You're not in like,

580
00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.720
you know like putting together game plans based on intelligence decisions but,

581
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.560
but you haven't been there yourself.
You've got both going on.

582
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.470
<v 2>Yeah.
That's what I think helps to hear it too off most of these guys,</v>

583
00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:37.930
they know I've done it.
They and they know I'm passionate.

584
00:30:37.931 --> 00:30:39.730
I'm there for these motherfuckers like hundred percent.

585
00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:41.380
I watch film like a mother fucker.

586
00:30:41.381 --> 00:30:43.990
I make sure that I went to Duquesne plants or do drills in the class.

587
00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:48.100
It's for this specific a specific guys.
We have no class at 2030 people.

588
00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.380
I make sure in our hour and a half class,
you know,

589
00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:52.990
four or five rounds is for this guy for five rounds of this for this guy.

590
00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:54.970
And to make sure that I gained plan planet,
tailor things.

591
00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.390
And then also we do our private lessons is specifically for their fight based on

592
00:30:58.391 --> 00:31:01.480
what they're already good at.
Cause they say,
okay Tj as good at,
you know,

593
00:31:01.481 --> 00:31:03.340
these 10 things,
you know,
his opponent's grip,

594
00:31:03.341 --> 00:31:04.960
these 10 things we've gotta be aware of these.
Okay,

595
00:31:04.961 --> 00:31:07.090
five of t J's things going to work perfect for this guy.

596
00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.040
Well let's draw the fuck out of those five things.

597
00:31:09.041 --> 00:31:10.150
So that's one of the things too.

598
00:31:10.151 --> 00:31:13.570
Like for me specifically when Bas Rutten would give me information or a

599
00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:15.050
technique or cowboy had told me to do something,

600
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.820
I took it to heart 100% just like the Goulay fight I went to that fight with my

601
00:31:18.821 --> 00:31:21.130
left shoulder is blown out.
So only thing I had was my right hand.

602
00:31:21.131 --> 00:31:23.910
So that's why it kind of worked out for my favor.
That's the fossils,

603
00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.250
the fast enough count.
Yeah.
And UFC.
So it just,
just the story behind it.

604
00:31:27.251 --> 00:31:29.260
It was just a two week notice.
File wasn't training at all.

605
00:31:29.261 --> 00:31:30.700
She's up in the mountains doing electrical work.

606
00:31:30.701 --> 00:31:33.580
My mantra call me spin and he's like,
Hey,
you want to do a fight?
And I was like,

607
00:31:33.581 --> 00:31:36.070
yeah,
sure,
what are they paying for?
And Four.
And I was like,
fuck man,

608
00:31:36.071 --> 00:31:38.560
that's like a,
you know,
two months with the work,
you know,
let's go do the fight.

609
00:31:38.561 --> 00:31:42.520
So I flew out and trip boss and it was actually trapped to tip plat bomb squad.

610
00:31:42.521 --> 00:31:43.480
They would bomb squad,
you know,

611
00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.000
and I was just want to take down a fence and Connor human,

612
00:31:46.001 --> 00:31:49.010
actually I got double end hooks on a shot and he took me over his back and blew

613
00:31:49.011 --> 00:31:51.850
out my left shoulder.
So I'm all,
I could draw all the keys up,

614
00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.560
dropped kicks and knees still,
but just as the right hand.

615
00:31:53.561 --> 00:31:55.450
So it's all I was looking for.
And the boss was like,
okay,

616
00:31:55.451 --> 00:31:58.000
he's going to come in and just took off to the side right hand.
I was like,
okay,

617
00:31:58.001 --> 00:32:01.780
cool.
Dang.
Bell comes to boom.
And I'm like,
Holy Shit.
Did you see that?

618
00:32:01.781 --> 00:32:03.640
And it goes up,
there's a photo,
there's a funnel.

619
00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.520
Like I'm punching him and he's looking away and I'm like looking at boss,

620
00:32:06.521 --> 00:32:07.171
not looking at Boston.

621
00:32:07.171 --> 00:32:09.720
I'm looking off to the side just because it happened so fast.
But I mean there's,

622
00:32:09.721 --> 00:32:10.690
there's two things to that too.

623
00:32:10.691 --> 00:32:13.360
I don't think you like took the best punch and I can hit hard.

624
00:32:13.361 --> 00:32:16.120
So it was a couple of things to that and then it was go and I,

625
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.073
Jordan and Lillian,

626
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.830
<v 0>do you have any regrets?
Like when you look back on your career?</v>

627
00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:25.460
<v 2>Yeah,
I definitely have regrets.
My dream from a child was to be not from Charlie.</v>

628
00:32:25.461 --> 00:32:29.270
I guess when I was 1516 I was first start time boxing was to fight for k one be

629
00:32:29.271 --> 00:32:33.110
the heavyweight champion to k one and I never grew that big.
So then,

630
00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:34.760
and then the student Thai boxing,

631
00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.700
jumping back and forth to an Mua and Thai boxing cause just have boxing,

632
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.680
you can't stay busy in America.
He couldn't anyway.

633
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.180
And then k one created the Max,
the midway or you know,
70 kilos,

634
00:32:44.181 --> 00:32:46.840
one 54 and then actually have it on the table.

635
00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:50.220
Same time was a Cuban contract and UFC contract after I fought gangs,

636
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.880
that was actually one fight deal.
And they offered me a three fight deal.

637
00:32:52.881 --> 00:32:54.290
And then Kate went off for me to deal as well.

638
00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:58.430
Marjorie was always go to k one and I went to k one just cause that was my

639
00:32:58.431 --> 00:33:00.740
childhood passion.
But looking back on it now,

640
00:33:00.741 --> 00:33:03.830
I wish I would have to stay with the UFC from the get go.
But you know,

641
00:33:03.831 --> 00:33:07.190
just being stuck in my ways and wanting to do k one and go visit Japan.

642
00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.230
It was just one of those things.
But going back,

643
00:33:09.231 --> 00:33:12.610
I wish it would have rolled and Russell Moore and then just definitely stayed in

644
00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.660
the UFC.
I do making more money now.
I'd be more well off.

645
00:33:14.661 --> 00:33:17.390
It probably wouldn't be having an autistic PSI on and I'd probably own a house

646
00:33:17.391 --> 00:33:20.060
right now.
So,
but on the flip side of that as well,
you know,

647
00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:22.270
if I did own a house I could rent that of course.
Um,

648
00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:26.450
I probably wouldn't have taken the job here at team Alpha male and live it to

649
00:33:26.451 --> 00:33:28.130
these guys.
So it's,
you know,

650
00:33:28.131 --> 00:33:31.610
I learned the hard lesson of being a 10 99 subcontractor employee and I blew my

651
00:33:31.611 --> 00:33:34.460
knee out and had like three months with their pay in a year long injury.

652
00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:37.220
So I'm like,
fuck,
you know,
I was,
I kind of figured out what am I going to do?

653
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:39.080
And then you're,
I had just texts me,
he's like,
hey,

654
00:33:39.081 --> 00:33:41.360
you want to come out and you know,
be our head trainer.
And I was like,

655
00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:44.240
look at that and let's try it one more surgery to go through.
And I'm like,

656
00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:47.810
fuck man.
Yeah.
Hey am I am I start with Jay Mills.

657
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:51.350
The first 10 seconds he did an outside trip and blew my knee out like the first

658
00:33:51.351 --> 00:33:52.190
10 seconds of the fight.

659
00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:56.180
So ACL was completely gone and a bucket handle tear of the meniscus.

660
00:33:56.390 --> 00:34:00.080
So if that was gone,
so like I'm actually still not 100% healed.

661
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:03.080
Well I suppose to be hundred percent in a year and,
and it's almost a year now.

662
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.240
So it may be,
it's happening but still swells up.

663
00:34:05.241 --> 00:34:06.380
So I'm not even training or anything.

664
00:34:06.381 --> 00:34:08.510
I just started holding mitts for these guys about two months ago.

665
00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.940
<v 0>So you got a patellar tendon graft,
right?
I,
yeah,
he's my patella tendon.
Yeah.</v>

666
00:34:11.941 --> 00:34:15.090
Tell by the scar.
I've had both of those done.
The regular,

667
00:34:15.091 --> 00:34:16.490
the cadaver one and the battalion.

668
00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:21.240
<v 2>Oof.
I was statistically speaking,</v>

669
00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:24.650
you're supposed to use your own body parts to the lower percentage of rejection.

670
00:34:24.651 --> 00:34:24.820
Yeah.

671
00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:27.250
<v 0>Yeah.
There's a bunch of different minds.
Great.</v>

672
00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:29.920
But there's a bunch of different schools of thought on that.
I wonder if it's,

673
00:34:29.921 --> 00:34:31.390
you know,
the quality of the doctor.
I don't,

674
00:34:31.391 --> 00:34:35.140
I'm not smart enough or educated enough about medicine to make a real comment

675
00:34:35.141 --> 00:34:39.140
about that.
But for me,
um,
they're both great.
They both work right?

676
00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:41.560
There was no problems.
I had meniscus taken out of the left knee.

677
00:34:41.561 --> 00:34:46.000
That's the only difference.
It's a little,
do you run much though?
No,
no I don't.

678
00:34:46.001 --> 00:34:49.690
I do elliptical machines.
I like to do sprints on elliptical machines.

679
00:34:49.691 --> 00:34:53.080
Like put out,
let's crank it up really heavy.
Like put it on like,
you know,

680
00:34:53.081 --> 00:34:55.660
depending on whatever it is like,
like right below the,

681
00:34:55.661 --> 00:34:59.560
the highest level and to just do 30 minute wild man sprints.

682
00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:03.100
Like that's what I do.
Or 30 seconds around wild man sprints.
That's what I do.

683
00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:05.150
It give him a hotel room and I can't,
you know,

684
00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:07.300
if there's not a gym there to just have one of those elliptical machines,

685
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:09.640
you can still get a bad work as a kill your legs man.

686
00:35:09.641 --> 00:35:11.020
Just gotta go nutty with it.

687
00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:16.050
I just do it like fucking dragons chasten me 30 seconds and then I take 30

688
00:35:16.391 --> 00:35:20.400
seconds of just breathe and all.
I'm moving but I'm just breathing and then wow,

689
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:25.210
I just warm up for 10 minutes and then do that hotels or wherever you're at.

690
00:35:25.211 --> 00:35:27.490
And then people are just looking and you're like,
what the hell's this guy doing?

691
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:29.980
He's like,
it's just an elliptical man.
Chill out.

692
00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.420
You're watching training for a fight.

693
00:35:31.421 --> 00:35:34.240
Just yelling on the machine or sprinting as hard as you can on the treadmill.

694
00:35:34.241 --> 00:35:37.440
You know,
he makes me shy when we go work.
Cause that guy I like,

695
00:35:37.441 --> 00:35:38.040
I'm like if somebody

696
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.340
<v 3>is having sex next,
that's what it's gotta do.
You gotta go gotta do it.</v>

697
00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:44.820
I'm not even preparing for anything.
I was just scared.
There's a lot of lines.

698
00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:48.260
I'm scared like dragons chasing.
Yeah.
Fuck it.

699
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:51.630
If I'm lifting weights I'm lifting like I might die if I don't get this weight

700
00:35:51.631 --> 00:35:52.464
up,
I'm going to die.

701
00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.260
<v 2>Different mentality though,
guys know,</v>

702
00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.490
you know they're literally putting their last one line when there is a

703
00:35:57.491 --> 00:35:58.600
possibility of course,

704
00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:01.210
cause it's a possibility you can hit by cars across the street as well.

705
00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:04.590
But credibly dates just one of those things.
But I,
you know,
I love it man.

706
00:36:04.591 --> 00:36:06.420
It's say,
you know,
I loved it when I was fighting.
You know,

707
00:36:06.421 --> 00:36:09.130
passion is trying to kind of dwindling away.
So it's just perfect timing.

708
00:36:09.131 --> 00:36:11.860
Like you know,
things work out for you.
What happened for a reason,
whatever.

709
00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:15.070
I'm learning to believe and understand that this the my own path of my own

710
00:36:15.071 --> 00:36:17.500
career.
Although I know there are some things that you know,

711
00:36:17.501 --> 00:36:20.380
whatever you believe and conceive you can achieve kind of thing.

712
00:36:20.381 --> 00:36:24.360
So that kind of thing.
I think that's 100 fucking percent true.
I feel so

713
00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:28.950
<v 0>well it certainly is.
It certainly is with me.
I always wonder when,</v>

714
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:30.490
what the fuck is really going on with that?

715
00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:34.480
Whether or not you just got lucky and you're just looking back on being lucky

716
00:36:34.481 --> 00:36:38.860
gone.
Well,
you know,
it's just uh,
the,
the,
the world works out for itself.

717
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:41.290
Does it really work out for itself or does it,

718
00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.780
is it just you capitalize on whatever the fuck you,

719
00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:46.600
you balance yourself out and you get through it no matter what.

720
00:36:46.601 --> 00:36:48.100
It's not that everything happens for a reason.

721
00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:51.460
It's just that if you have the correct attitude and you don't get hung up on

722
00:36:51.461 --> 00:36:53.680
things,
you can succeed.
You just keep pushing forward.

723
00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.620
You find your opportunities eventually and you jump through him.
I mean,

724
00:36:56.621 --> 00:37:00.940
who's to say that opportunities couldn't have come up that were even better a

725
00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.520
year ago or 10 years ago or five years ago?
They could have,
but when they,

726
00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:08.050
it's a matter of when they do or when you create them capitalize.
Yes.

727
00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:11.620
So you were in the perfect position to do that.
Like it was perfect.

728
00:37:11.621 --> 00:37:13.740
It was a good Gig,
you know,
so it's,

729
00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:16.840
it's smart to jump on it and perfect for you.

730
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.110
<v 2>Yeah.
For me,
you know,</v>

731
00:37:18.111 --> 00:37:21.170
spiritually and anything just living through these guys now it's another rebirth

732
00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:23.720
and I am the crack guy for this job.

733
00:37:23.721 --> 00:37:26.810
Make we're were vibe and fucking a hundred percent perfect man.
It's awesome.

734
00:37:26.811 --> 00:37:29.380
It's a great mix with these guys.
They have no problem John.

735
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:31.640
I don't have to babysit these motherfuckers.
They show up on time,

736
00:37:31.641 --> 00:37:32.990
they show respect that they're to get better.

737
00:37:32.991 --> 00:37:34.130
They help you with any help each other.

738
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:35.420
Even when they don't have fights coming up,

739
00:37:35.421 --> 00:37:38.660
they still come in and help the train partner cause I'm like okay look today you

740
00:37:38.661 --> 00:37:40.250
need to be this guy.
Can you need to be cleaned?

741
00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:43.400
Waited for for 10 minutes and then he'll mimic like Whitney and watch the film

742
00:37:43.401 --> 00:37:45.200
and come in and he'll dance around and do his thing.

743
00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.650
Just to give us to look for our next step.

744
00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:50.520
<v 3>Right.
That's the way it's gotta be.
That's so important.
I don't have 100%.</v>

745
00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:53.050
I don't really have training camps and you're,
you know,
I have to get help.

746
00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:56.230
I've been training for the last two months helping,
you know,
you're,
I get ready.

747
00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:00.320
Chad's fighting next week and Josias fight in September 4th Danny just fought a

748
00:38:00.321 --> 00:38:03.650
in Seattle,
you know,
so I've been helping everyone get ready.

749
00:38:03.651 --> 00:38:06.170
I've been in shape for the last,
who knows how long,
you know,

750
00:38:06.171 --> 00:38:08.810
and so I'm always ready to take a fight as long as I'm not an injured.

751
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.340
So crazy young man there.

752
00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:12.780
<v 2>Yeah.
That's why I worked out good for his last fight.
You know,
he was turning,</v>

753
00:38:12.781 --> 00:38:15.520
I was fine with Hugo Vianna.
Yeah.
Was that's too,
yeah,
that's right.

754
00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:18.300
His last two fights were showing those fights,
but he's always training.

755
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:21.180
<v 0>Oh,
he's insurance so it doesn't matter.
Yeah,
that's a,
it's a,</v>

756
00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.480
you guys have a really cool camp.

757
00:38:23.481 --> 00:38:26.510
And one of the things that's really important is that what you said about that

758
00:38:26.511 --> 00:38:27.500
wrestler mentality.

759
00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.980
There's like when they were trying to take wrestling out of the Olympics,

760
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:35.150
there was so many people were really frustrated and really angry and people

761
00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:36.190
never wrestled.

762
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:38.710
<v 1>Don't understand this.
I only wrestled for one season.</v>

763
00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.510
Solando I'm just talking out of my ass,

764
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:45.160
but I know what it did for me and just in one season.
Yeah,
I remember working.

765
00:38:45.161 --> 00:38:48.640
I remember doing that one season of wrestling and thinking,

766
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:52.850
that's probably the hardest I've ever worked at anything in my fucking life for

767
00:38:52.851 --> 00:38:57.040
sure.
And I had done martial arts from a much earlier than that I had,

768
00:38:57.041 --> 00:39:00.730
I'd been involved in physical things.
I played sports,
but I was like this,

769
00:39:00.731 --> 00:39:01.900
I played soccer.
I'm like,

770
00:39:01.901 --> 00:39:06.901
this is the nuttiest most soul crushing shit when you're exhausted and then make

771
00:39:07.571 --> 00:39:12.220
you fucking doing sprints,
carrying guys on your back and you're just nutty Shit,

772
00:39:12.221 --> 00:39:16.960
man.
Down and go,
motherfucker.
I'm like running stairs.
And they broke you.

773
00:39:16.961 --> 00:39:20.560
You would show up every day.
Everything in your body would be fucking sore.

774
00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.150
But if you can get through that,

775
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:26.590
it'll make you an incredibly strong persa and that's the advantage that the

776
00:39:26.591 --> 00:39:29.430
wrestler mentality has.
Like I always say that the,

777
00:39:29.431 --> 00:39:33.160
if the pyramid of mixed martial arts techniques was ever established,

778
00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.000
in my opinion,
at least wrestling is the base group.

779
00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:38.090
And it's not just because of the,

780
00:39:38.091 --> 00:39:40.780
the actual ability to control where the fight takes place,

781
00:39:40.781 --> 00:39:43.150
where they're standing up or to take it to the ground and whether you're using

782
00:39:43.151 --> 00:39:46.420
it chocolate,
Dell style or whether you're,
you know,
Ben Aspirin in it though,

783
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:50.590
the most important aspect of it is the mentality that comes with that training.

784
00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:54.850
It's not like Jujitsu.
It's not like kickboxing and nobody else works at heart.

785
00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:56.850
We,
when we weigh in every week,
we,

786
00:39:56.851 --> 00:40:00.280
we compete every weekend and you're always hungry.
Oh,
always.
You have to be,

787
00:40:00.281 --> 00:40:01.750
you know what I mean?
If you're not,
you're getting beat,

788
00:40:01.751 --> 00:40:05.440
you're not going to be the best in the world,
you know?
Yeah.
You have to be,

789
00:40:05.441 --> 00:40:07.210
you have to have the mentality of,
you know,

790
00:40:07.211 --> 00:40:10.720
pushing harder than that next guy in that sport because it's just a one on one

791
00:40:10.721 --> 00:40:13.270
muscle versus muscle.
Like,
you know,
it's,
it's tough.

792
00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:16.540
I think the weight cutting aspect of it is a huge tragedy.
In high school though.

793
00:40:16.541 --> 00:40:18.810
I really,
really do.
I have a friend,
um,

794
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:22.270
who was a really good wrestler in high school and uh,

795
00:40:22.271 --> 00:40:27.271
he tried to stay at one 28 through his entire career and he was a fucking Zombie

796
00:40:28.451 --> 00:40:29.284
and his senior year,

797
00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:32.680
the kid always had bad breath because the mouth is always wide open.

798
00:40:32.681 --> 00:40:36.910
He looked like a Zombie and he was,
he was five,
six,
all of his brothers,

799
00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:40.810
six feet tall or taller than his girlfriend.
He just fucking crushed himself.

800
00:40:40.811 --> 00:40:43.850
He ruined his body wrestling.
That was me at 55,
man,
I'll just kill myself.

801
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:44.860
I didn't know how to cut weight.
Right?

802
00:40:44.861 --> 00:40:48.400
I was just always running Abilene on rubber suit running and just like trending

803
00:40:48.401 --> 00:40:51.820
Thai style,
just running a lot and just killing my body.
So I think not,

804
00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.500
I don't think I definitely fucking,
no 100% that killed me.
That coastal,

805
00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.160
my passion as well,
and then was able to receive punches as well,

806
00:40:57.161 --> 00:40:59.770
either just draining my body,
hydrate it correctly.

807
00:40:59.771 --> 00:41:02.190
So I just didn't understand the game until I got what Mike Dolce and I,

808
00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.210
motherfucker,
he's got his shit down.

809
00:41:04.211 --> 00:41:07.000
He definitely knows how to make the human body lose weight correctly and then

810
00:41:07.001 --> 00:41:10.400
come back also.
But it's all a journey.
I've learned a lot to lessen that.

811
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:13.300
I find out,
I know exactly what the fuck do I lead with is now.
That's for sure.

812
00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.160
And that's what wrestling or anything and he,
you know,

813
00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.860
you know what he's capable of and definitely know exactly what the fuck I'm

814
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:19.690
comfortable.
Yeah.
You know your limitations.

815
00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:22.450
I mean there comes a point in time when you literally can go no further.

816
00:41:22.451 --> 00:41:25.960
You can take no steps.
You can lift your body up,
you're done.

817
00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:27.880
Can you get there though?

818
00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:31.210
Do you get there or do you decide that 10 steps before that was there?

819
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:34.010
Because that could be the difference to a fight and losing it

820
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.640
<v 0>for,
right.</v>

821
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:38.990
The difference between being able to keep those rpms up just a little while

822
00:41:38.991 --> 00:41:40.040
longer than the next guy.

823
00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:44.900
And that's what wrestling teaches you because there's wrestling is a,

824
00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.140
is a strange martial art in that,
you know,

825
00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:51.980
you look at a guy like aspirin who is not like the physically the most like

826
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:57.170
Kevin Randleman [inaudible] physically impressive fighter I think I've ever

827
00:41:57.171 --> 00:42:01.700
seen.
And he's just a super alpha male mesomorphic build.
But you look at Ben,

828
00:42:01.701 --> 00:42:04.040
ask her and you don't see that.
But if you,
if you said like,

829
00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:05.370
who's the better recipes?
Well,

830
00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:09.290
didn't back better dynamic athlete is Kevin Randleman for sure.
But man,

831
00:42:09.291 --> 00:42:12.530
as far as wrestling accomplishments,
Ben aspirins more accomplished.

832
00:42:12.531 --> 00:42:16.490
And that's pretty incredible because in wrestling you engage,

833
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:19.070
there's going to be an engaging and if you don't engage,

834
00:42:19.071 --> 00:42:20.030
you're going to lose points for it.

835
00:42:20.031 --> 00:42:22.280
And so you're going to tie up and you're gonna find out what the fuck is up.

836
00:42:22.281 --> 00:42:25.280
Once you do that.
And there's a,
there's a difference in that.

837
00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.580
And in the fact that it's going to go down.

838
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:30.830
Whereas like kickboxing man,
there's,

839
00:42:30.831 --> 00:42:33.200
we've all seen bouts where almost nothing happens.

840
00:42:33.201 --> 00:42:36.340
There's a lot of fucking move and they both decided to coast that shit

841
00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.500
<v 3>can happen in the brain.
Then you talking about like boring fights and such.</v>

842
00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.270
How about when a,
what was it?

843
00:42:41.271 --> 00:42:45.800
The dance [inaudible] you liked that one Mr Rogan?
Where are you at?

844
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:49.510
No,
that one I was like,
yeah,

845
00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:51.650
but I think through that

846
00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.870
<v 0>look I would have hated to watch it but I think we had to go through it as,</v>

847
00:42:55.871 --> 00:42:58.740
as martial arts,
like as a,
as a martial art,

848
00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:01.950
like which mixed martial arts is essentially,
I mean is it,

849
00:43:01.951 --> 00:43:04.590
is the sport most realistic to fighting?

850
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:09.000
And I think we had to know that that can happen at these two fucking guys can

851
00:43:09.001 --> 00:43:11.670
just circle each other going do nothing.
I mean we have to know,

852
00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.170
we've seen a bunch of fights like that.

853
00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:15.430
<v 3>So then that's when instead of encouraging the standup,</v>

854
00:43:15.431 --> 00:43:18.490
you encourage like a shot.
Motherfuckers don't encourage shit man.

855
00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.610
<v 0>Say,
if a guy like Craig,</v>

856
00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:24.780
we'd can run away from gray Maynard for three rounds then so be it.
So he can,

857
00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:28.590
you know,
look,
I get it.

858
00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:33.300
I know what you're saying.
You would like him to try to win,
but he's not gonna.

859
00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.030
Yeah.
Okay.
So that's possible too.
So here,

860
00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:39.060
here's the guy just decides to stay alive.
Okay.
He's not trying to win the fight.

861
00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:43.030
There's nothing wrong with that.
I mean I think there is,
there is in watching it,

862
00:43:43.031 --> 00:43:43.681
I don't want to watch it,

863
00:43:43.681 --> 00:43:47.010
but then the market will dictate whether you watched that guy again.
You know,

864
00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.650
if you're going to watch a guy like Michael Chandler is a good example.

865
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:53.550
A lot of guys don't know who he is and he's one of the best one 55 hours in the

866
00:43:53.551 --> 00:43:57.030
world and he's a fucking animal.
He's awesome.
He comes after afternoons.

867
00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.700
And so when you get a guy like that or a,
you know,

868
00:43:59.701 --> 00:44:04.350
a guy like Melvin Manhoef as a kickboxer,
you'd get these wild Berzerker dudes.

869
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:06.560
You met Vandelay Silva you want to watch.

870
00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:09.510
And so they're worth more money and you know,

871
00:44:09.511 --> 00:44:11.610
and they were going to get booked more and they're going to get higher plate.

872
00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:15.150
I mean,
people are gonna want to see that shit.
So I think that when,

873
00:44:15.151 --> 00:44:19.290
if you have a boring style,
you ultimately pay for it in your career.

874
00:44:19.291 --> 00:44:23.130
And that's how it should be.
The market,
I think should dictate,
you know,

875
00:44:23.131 --> 00:44:27.450
how how you do with that style.
But if you're a dude,
like if Ben Looks,

876
00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:30.990
let's say Ben asking gets to the UFC,
okay.
Which is entirely possible.
Now I,

877
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:31.973
he's a free agent

878
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:34.420
<v 2>and he just mugs,
GSP.
Yeah.</v>

879
00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:39.540
Just gets all the GSP and just sticks his fucking chest on its face for five

880
00:44:40.471 --> 00:44:43.560
rounds and,
and punches him in the head to,
I believe he could do it.

881
00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:46.410
He might look what?
But what if he does then what the fuck do we do?

882
00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.020
What if he can do that day?
Everybody?

883
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.580
What if Ben bad her and just monkey fucks everybody.

884
00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:55.850
And every middle weight fight from here on out is,
is like in a lot of fans,

885
00:44:55.851 --> 00:44:59.790
size is,
is uneventful and boring.
Guess what?
That shit's real.

886
00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:01.770
Somebody has to figure it out.
Stuff to take down.

887
00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:06.290
Somebody has to figure out how to either hit him coming in or you got a Marcella

888
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:06.330
Garcia,

889
00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:09.300
you got to get someone who's so high level on the ground that he can't stay in

890
00:45:09.301 --> 00:45:12.300
this position.
That's when it comes,
you know you're watching the film and he say,

891
00:45:12.301 --> 00:45:15.030
okay he does this.
So when he does that,
I'm going to make him do that.

892
00:45:15.031 --> 00:45:18.090
By me doing this,
you take the what if game.
What if games,

893
00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:20.910
I don't want to give away any game plants case any your boys fight him.

894
00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:25.470
But without specific for any particular fighter.
If someone was gonna Fight Ben,

895
00:45:25.471 --> 00:45:27.420
ask her.
And how would you talk about some films?

896
00:45:27.421 --> 00:45:30.070
I don't even watch them to be honest.
I'd have to say.
Okay.
How about fish?

897
00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:31.050
I know you watched it.

898
00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:35.250
I've watched fit fitches similar watching a lot of ways I'd have to watch a film

899
00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.040
with the mindset of coaching against him because there's a difference.

900
00:45:38.041 --> 00:45:39.440
Cause I watch film and I'll,

901
00:45:39.441 --> 00:45:41.850
I'll take a film and it depends because sometime I can watch her,

902
00:45:41.851 --> 00:45:42.441
I just go off memory.

903
00:45:42.441 --> 00:45:44.700
I already know how to beat the guy or how I feel like he can beat the guy,

904
00:45:44.701 --> 00:45:45.150
you know.

905
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:50.150
So I get crazy with fucking watching film and so I'll take a film.

906
00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:53.670
I used to,
anyway,
I just take a film,
watch it sober,
boom.

907
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:56.580
I used to take it and watch it high just to give me an honest approach because I

908
00:45:56.581 --> 00:45:58.270
am very biased and I come there,

909
00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:01.110
I'm there for my fucking guy's 100% so all I saw,

910
00:46:01.111 --> 00:46:03.870
I noticed that I'll watch fights.
I'm like,
fuck man,
I know my guys to do this,

911
00:46:03.871 --> 00:46:07.710
this,
this,
and I realize I'm not watching this with the honest,
open mind.
So,

912
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:10.480
and then I watch it on Alpha brain as well on it,

913
00:46:10.481 --> 00:46:12.270
round for brain just to get different looks on things.

914
00:46:12.271 --> 00:46:14.430
I have another guy in Colorado,
Mike Tempo,
who watched it,
the fights,

915
00:46:14.431 --> 00:46:16.380
asked the fighters to watch the fights.
I get a whole bunch of film,

916
00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.080
I'll make notes,
compare the notes,
see what we need to work with.

917
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:22.980
But some guys I can just watch the film and break it down.
No right off the bat.

918
00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:28.340
But I'd have to watch Fitch to answer your question with the Crick Mindset of me

919
00:46:28.351 --> 00:46:29.520
being coaching,
it's like me right now.

920
00:46:29.521 --> 00:46:32.940
Like I'm hyped up and again like the Roman God,
this is fucking awesome for me.

921
00:46:32.941 --> 00:46:33.774
Like I love this shit.

922
00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:37.830
I've learned so much from the Rogan podcasts and from you and your guests,

923
00:46:37.831 --> 00:46:41.340
you know like Mike Dolce,
Alex Grey,
Graham Hancock,
you [inaudible] like,

924
00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:44.460
you know Joey Coco Diaz,
like a lot of guys have been on here.
Man,
I fucking,

925
00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:47.250
I've learned more from this fucking podcast and it had,
you know,

926
00:46:47.251 --> 00:46:50.940
in school or my life trials for sure 100%.
So this has done a lot for me,
for me.

927
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:54.300
So for me to be on this manic,
it's fucking cool.
And it's food stuff like,
um,

928
00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:56.760
you know,
like I'm still relevant.
I'm doing things in life like Yo,

929
00:46:57.150 --> 00:47:00.000
like boss written stories on here,
you know like Boston back man.
I love that guy.

930
00:47:00.001 --> 00:47:04.640
So where's my black belt?
Boston.
Was it that much?
No,
no.

931
00:47:04.641 --> 00:47:09.200
Listen to podcasts.
Mr [inaudible] keep interrupting me.
Oh yeah,

932
00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:14.640
good,
good,
good.
Carry on.
I have as well,
like it's not a one way street,

933
00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:17.760
but having these conversations with people like you and you know,

934
00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:19.980
I mean being able to pick people's brains,
being able to,

935
00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:24.230
well it's these exchanges,
that energy.
Yeah.
The exchange is like,

936
00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:27.030
what's a cool fucking journey for me,

937
00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:29.290
it's for me to like create a combo or a technique,
you know,

938
00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.540
and show it to somebody.
You're going have them drill.

939
00:47:31.541 --> 00:47:34.180
It brought up this point and then when the fucking fight with that same exact

940
00:47:34.181 --> 00:47:38.070
technique,
that shit is fucking nuts.
That's who,
that's fucking cool man.

941
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.100
You know what's really cool about it?

942
00:47:39.101 --> 00:47:43.000
It's like really is artistic and so like everything is an art and especially

943
00:47:43.001 --> 00:47:47.110
considering the fact that there's really no established protocol to do it like

944
00:47:47.111 --> 00:47:49.510
this,
everybody has their own way.
If you went to Greg Jackson,

945
00:47:49.511 --> 00:47:52.840
he would have one method to train a fighter and you went to Matt Hume.

946
00:47:52.841 --> 00:47:54.460
He would have a different way of training a fighter.

947
00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:58.480
That's why I think I've trained it.
Greg,
I haven't tried my have shown great.

948
00:47:58.481 --> 00:48:00.880
He's got great stuff.
He's awesome stuff.
That's again,

949
00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.090
I'm making sure I'm adjusting to the athlete.
I'm not trying to,
you know,

950
00:48:04.091 --> 00:48:06.820
make them me.
I'm trying to,
you know,
just like Chai Mendez,

951
00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:09.010
he hits me at Spi does certain things a certain way.

952
00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:11.740
Tj does things a certain way.
I need to adjust to these guys.

953
00:48:11.741 --> 00:48:13.800
I need to give them my ideas and my opinions might my,

954
00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:17.230
my little bits of information while they're doing what they feel comfortable

955
00:48:17.231 --> 00:48:20.950
doing.
Because if you can pull that off,
what I would feel technically incorrect.

956
00:48:20.951 --> 00:48:23.140
But if you can make that work,
you can make that work.
What the fuck can I say?

957
00:48:23.141 --> 00:48:26.110
I can't argue with success.
If you're landing there.
My hand on that Hook,
I mean,

958
00:48:26.111 --> 00:48:28.390
I'd say,
you know,
you're lunging in your heater Chin's up.
You know,
you're,

959
00:48:28.391 --> 00:48:30.430
you're out of position,
you're making it work.
You're making it work.

960
00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:32.200
But how about let's keep our position.

961
00:48:32.201 --> 00:48:33.550
How about let's set that up a different note.

962
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:35.580
Another way you can just give it another look at things.

963
00:48:35.581 --> 00:48:36.650
So to answer the question,

964
00:48:36.651 --> 00:48:40.090
as far as I encourage my guys to get other pieces of information,
know go,

965
00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:42.370
go train over there,
go get different looks.
I want to bring people in.

966
00:48:42.371 --> 00:48:44.860
I wanna start working,
hopefully Boston coming to [inaudible] and do a seminar.

967
00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:47.770
I'm hoping to bring leaster Boeing doesn't take away your value.

968
00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:50.340
It adds to interrupted me.
Yeah.

969
00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:55.090
But then I hung up on our conversation so I told us,
I just,

970
00:48:55.091 --> 00:48:55.800
I just love it man.

971
00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.470
I definitely want to have as much input cause I don't want it to be,
you know,

972
00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.970
stubborn and set in my ways when making these guys do one thing.

973
00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:03.250
I want these guys to be the best martial arts that can be.

974
00:49:03.251 --> 00:49:04.770
So does that means being the other guys?

975
00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.440
I mean it's visiting other James Man and fucking do it.

976
00:49:06.441 --> 00:49:08.770
So I know I'm not here for me.
I'm here for these fucking guys.

977
00:49:08.771 --> 00:49:11.920
So I just want to go to Spain.
You have to bring in other people?

978
00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:15.310
I think so 100% and isn't that,
that was a real problem with some trainers,

979
00:49:15.311 --> 00:49:18.010
some and worried about other people coming in and we're going to take their

980
00:49:18.011 --> 00:49:20.280
thunder.
You know what was really cool?
So I was just,
sorry,

981
00:49:20.281 --> 00:49:21.430
I was just in Boston for a year.

982
00:49:21.431 --> 00:49:24.670
I his fight and Marcela grotty hand me out for a seminar and there's open doors.

983
00:49:24.671 --> 00:49:27.850
Then we cheat just to instant and it's the way,
you know his energy and shit.
Man,

984
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:30.910
that was fucking awesome.
He's a true martial artist man.
I love that dude.

985
00:49:30.911 --> 00:49:32.770
He's very,
very fucking cool.
And,
and he,
uh,

986
00:49:32.771 --> 00:49:35.350
he did a technique of the week video just like you did as well for my bank and

987
00:49:35.351 --> 00:49:37.300
we tie series.
So you know that,
that was awesome.

988
00:49:37.301 --> 00:49:40.390
I got a great group of people around me like Mr Rogan and you know,

989
00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:45.370
the team Alpha male and my art design guy.
Aaron,
you're earning Colorado.
And,

990
00:49:45.371 --> 00:49:47.650
um,
my,
my highlight guy,
James Blair who just do my recent,

991
00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:50.400
my new highlight with the team,
like that mother Fucker,
he can,

992
00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:52.540
he can edit some fucking video.
And what's the name of that?

993
00:49:52.541 --> 00:49:54.760
If people want to find out,
pull that shit up.

994
00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:57.850
Cause this is this newest one and these are the latest uploader.

995
00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.400
Second to pull it on my youtube channel being with youtube channel,

996
00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:03.970
but I just made it a,
uh,
a video and a heart attack.
I mean two fl,

997
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:06.460
two to do three things.
We're in Sacramento to do three things,

998
00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:09.340
take care of my family and I get these motherfuckers world titles.

999
00:50:09.341 --> 00:50:11.500
And then to push my bank with Thai brand cause I'm,
you know,

1000
00:50:11.501 --> 00:50:13.900
I need to take my art information and monetize it.

1001
00:50:13.901 --> 00:50:16.690
I need to make money off that now.
I mean I ain't making no fucking money.

1002
00:50:16.691 --> 00:50:19.250
I couldn't be 100%.
I'm not,
I'm not rich man.
Like for real,
I'm about,

1003
00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:21.910
I'm trying to be real.
I want to own a house,
I want to have my shit paid off.

1004
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:23.920
I want to,
you know,
live a comfortable life.
My family.

1005
00:50:23.921 --> 00:50:26.570
And I am not going to be the martial artists who's not gonna make it any mother

1006
00:50:26.571 --> 00:50:28.410
fucking money.
Right.
Well,
yeah,

1007
00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:32.990
I know too much not become successful is that they become successful and then

1008
00:50:32.991 --> 00:50:36.340
it'll,
you know,
took it down to me,
which is cool.
If they become,
they are.

1009
00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:39.200
These motherfuckers are very,
see that's the thing too.
Like before I came,

1010
00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:41.900
look how successful they've been without me.
Like I'm not trying to change.

1011
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:42.890
I'm going to try and tighten them up.

1012
00:50:42.891 --> 00:50:45.080
We're not trying like I'm fucking doing that.
I'm tightening them up.

1013
00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.630
It is because they're listening to me and just because they know I'm there for

1014
00:50:47.631 --> 00:50:47.940
them.

1015
00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:51.260
So there's a couple layers to this onion of why of our success is not just me.

1016
00:50:51.261 --> 00:50:52.520
It's their belief in me as well.

1017
00:50:52.521 --> 00:50:55.220
It's why I carry myself is the way they carry themselves and I'm adapting to

1018
00:50:55.221 --> 00:50:56.720
them.
They're trying to make them Duane Ludwig,

1019
00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.940
I making them the best martial arts that can help them be.

1020
00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:01.310
Is there a danger of keeping the name Alpha male?

1021
00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:06.230
Has it hit the radical douche point yet?
I'm not sure.
I worry about,

1022
00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:08.750
I worry about the Alpha brain.
I'm like man,

1023
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:12.270
you know it's it bros out at bros out at about a team.

1024
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:15.070
The Bang would tie a smash.
I know,
he know.

1025
00:51:15.090 --> 00:51:18.380
I feel like I feel like fucking splinter from the Ninja turtles and like these

1026
00:51:18.381 --> 00:51:19.420
are my Ninja Turtles.
Just like,

1027
00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:23.090
cause like in San Hosea on the April 20th is rolled in and had that fucking Tj

1028
00:51:23.091 --> 00:51:24.970
Dillashaw Benevides and Mendez.

1029
00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:26.900
I'll just come and just smashed her post and just leave.

1030
00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:29.480
It was like we just wrote it to the town smashed him and the belts.

1031
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:33.710
That was the fucking coolest shit ever.
I wish people could experience that same,

1032
00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:37.860
that same energy that does all that.
It's just fucking cool man above it.

1033
00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:40.460
Your absolute limit shit.
I fucking love him.

1034
00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:45.320
Like real technical improvement.
He taught you brought up Chad Mendez before.

1035
00:51:45.321 --> 00:51:47.090
God Damn is that due to fucking athlete.

1036
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:50.270
He is on another level how Mike Tyson stuck out in the boxing world.

1037
00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:54.390
This is Chad Mendez.
He is this successful are very,
very dynamic.
Um,

1038
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:58.610
if we can just super athletic athletes.
I know he lost to Aldo,

1039
00:51:58.611 --> 00:52:01.640
but I believe that was before you guys started working together,
right?
Correct.

1040
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:03.350
Yeah.
I've seen big leaps.

1041
00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:06.690
I just came to the team in January is when I move out of their general,

1042
00:52:06.691 --> 00:52:11.440
not one of those freaky abilities to cover distance with punches is an explosive

1043
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:15.530
fast.
He's fast.
He's on another level.
100%.

1044
00:52:15.531 --> 00:52:17.180
That's the same thing when I was talking about Marcello,

1045
00:52:17.181 --> 00:52:19.940
like finishing up gay teens.
Yeah.
Got It.
There's guys like Mendez.

1046
00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:22.890
It hit takedowns.
I hit doubles and you're like,
Jesus Christ,
his,

1047
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:25.430
his take down as a missile,
it's impossible to stop.

1048
00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:28.850
That's what's so crazy about Aldo,
that all those stuff,
I think,

1049
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:33.500
I think Chad gave them to introspect.
You know what I mean?
I think Chad just fed,

1050
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:36.080
gave him too much respect on some stuff too,
though.

1051
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:39.380
They mean you have to give him respect,

1052
00:52:39.381 --> 00:52:41.750
but not to the point where it's hindering your own ability.

1053
00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:44.990
That's the thing I do when I felt Ramon Dekkers,
you know,
like,
I mean you can't,

1054
00:52:44.991 --> 00:52:47.210
I mean,
you got to give her home decors all the respect in the world.

1055
00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:50.570
I looked up to nudge one of the greatest Moyie Thai fighters all time.

1056
00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.990
It's very arguable.
The greatest cause.
Yeah,
100%.
And I just didn't,

1057
00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:57.530
I just looked up to him too much and I just didn't perform to my full ability

1058
00:52:57.650 --> 00:53:00.710
and that was disrespectful to him.
I felt so lost.
You know,

1059
00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:03.580
that was one of the things too,
but you know,
I mean,
he socked me up and you know,

1060
00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:05.030
he won and he'd probably do it again,

1061
00:53:05.031 --> 00:53:07.400
but I just didn't perform to my full potential.
But I mean,

1062
00:53:07.401 --> 00:53:09.380
he'd probably beat my ass no matter what,
man.
I love that dude here.

1063
00:53:09.381 --> 00:53:12.200
And in all fairness,
she also fought him.
He was pretty late in his career,
right?

1064
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:15.660
Yeah.
Late in his career.
And he still talks to me about bullshit.
Dammit.
Yeah,

1065
00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:19.130
he's good man.
I'm one of the fucker.
I got man,
much respect for that guy.

1066
00:53:19.131 --> 00:53:23.930
He has bad ankles now.
Something we passed now.
He died recently.

1067
00:53:23.931 --> 00:53:26.270
Bike riding.
I you had a heart attack.
So yeah.

1068
00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:29.820
<v 1>Fucking crazy.
Yeah,
but he used to have really bad ankles.
Right?</v>

1069
00:53:29.821 --> 00:53:33.450
Like you had like towards the end,
just from speaking elbows.
I mean he hit,

1070
00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:36.060
he hit too hard for his,
his weight and his body.
You know,

1071
00:53:36.061 --> 00:53:39.050
like the guy was a powerhouse meals.
The doors that the,
the,

1072
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:41.220
the Dutch windmill or something,
I forgot his,
you know,
one of his,

1073
00:53:41.410 --> 00:53:43.920
one of his nicknames.
But Ramon Dekkers as bad ass.

1074
00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:48.270
<v 4>We found one of the videos but we couldn't,
when we went to the youtube page,

1075
00:53:48.410 --> 00:53:50.340

1081

Yeah,

Yeah,

1082
00:54:10.331 --> 00:54:13.000

It says bang more time team Alpha male.</v>

1084
00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:18.710
Put it up so we could see it.

1085
00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:23.620
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1086
00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:26.050
<v 4>You fucked up Brian.
Now when we had the TVS off,</v>

1087
00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:28.040
it turns off the display monitor,
so,

1088
00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:31.630
<v 1>oh,
okay.
So here we go.
Back on.
Hold on.</v>

1089
00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:36.680
Anyway,
powerful incident anywhere.
What a cool motherfucker.

1090
00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.950
We did like a one o'clock in the morning and I heard that.

1091
00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:42.110
I listen to all kinds of podcasts,
man.
I love this guy.
He's cool.

1092
00:54:42.111 --> 00:54:44.750
So that was so cool.
It was like him and chuck just sitting here chatting.

1093
00:54:44.751 --> 00:54:47.300
That's gotta be cool,
man.
Talking about the old days,

1094
00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:50.960
helping out with the Fukushima sash.
Man.
That's cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They said that.

1095
00:54:50.961 --> 00:54:52.490
Doesn't that seem like it's getting worse and worse?

1096
00:54:52.491 --> 00:54:57.140
They're starting to see a radiation and tuna.
Wow.
Showed elevated radiation.

1097
00:54:57.141 --> 00:55:01.340
3% elevation and radiation of tuna for the Kachin and California.
Yeah.

1098
00:55:01.341 --> 00:55:03.110
This is the highlight.
Put that show on full screen.

1099
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:05.870
It's just highlighting chills,

This just got done today.
Thank you,

1100
00:55:05.871 --> 00:55:09.140

1101
00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.750
He's been hooking me up for a long time.
He does all kinds of bad ass videos.

1102
00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:21.360
<v 5>What the fuck is my lens?
You're going
to have such a technical stride.</v>

1103
00:55:21.361 --> 00:55:23.490
You're like Twain luck.
Powerful promotion.

1104
00:55:23.491 --> 00:55:26.310
Your head coach and I'm filling for my pump my stuff man.

1105
00:55:26.311 --> 00:55:28.510
Or you know saying I'm promoting.

1106
00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:31.410

I think that's the Rogan.
Thank you sir.
You're welcome.</v>

1107
00:55:31.411 --> 00:55:34.800
Appreciate it.
Yeah.

1108
00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:39.170
Whoever edited this is fucking glare.
That guy's bad ass.
Oh,

1109
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:43.210
he did an awesome job,
Ben,
to be taking everything we get is hey kid,

1110
00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:47.580
I wanted to ask you about that too.
Kicks to the back of the head.

1111
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:49.770
<v 1>Well,
well what?
Let this play out first.</v>

1112
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:53.440
<v 6>Wait,

Fucking bad ass.
There's the next year.</v>

1113
00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:58.030
See champion Benevidez a well,
it's physically get the shopper.
It's highly,

1114
00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:00.440
Mandy has a beat both of them there,
but I think it's gonna be chat.

1115
00:56:00.441 --> 00:56:02.990
It's closer to the title shot just for the rankings situation.

1116
00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:05.480
Benevidez is also getting better,
man.
Yeah.
Fucking

1117
00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:09.650
<v 1>animal.
It's delish Dillashaw booth.
Where you at?
Oh,
I love that fight,</v>

1118
00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:15.050
dude.
That was the first Friday where I said,
wow,
you just,
you hit another level.

1119
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:18.800
You were clearly on an the level technically like the way you were moving.

1120
00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:22.430
Appreciate that cousin Leonard Garcia doing things correctly.

1121
00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:26.520
That kids are wild motherfucker.
So is this one?
Yeah.

1122
00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:31.120
Benevidez Tornado rings and shifts.
Tornado of punches,
man.
Dude.

1123
00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:36.010
Ways they wouldn't.
Nipple rings on.
He's a savage.
Oof.
Yeah.

1124
00:56:36.011 --> 00:56:36.590
That was great.

1125
00:56:36.590 --> 00:56:41.100
<v 6>If
you were an animal,</v>

1126
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:44.390
this soundtrack sounds like you're walking through a door and your TV shows,

1127
00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:50.280
there's not enough screeching
wolf's calling.

1128
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:53.730
What a wild highlight.

1129
00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:59.150
Helping my bandwidth high system.

1130
00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:02.130
<v 2>What I do is I have a,
each week I sent out 20 affiliates.</v>

1131
00:57:02.131 --> 00:57:05.430
I have four to 10 detailed veto curriculums showing them exactly what drill or

1132
00:57:05.431 --> 00:57:07.670
techniques to do that week and each week I take my phone.
That's,

1133
00:57:07.671 --> 00:57:08.371
that's what it is.
Like.

1134
00:57:08.371 --> 00:57:11.010
I'm not just trying to sell you a banner of my name and put on your gym.

1135
00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:15.020
I take my fucking iPhone,
like we recorded the video today.
I take my phone.

1136
00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:17.130
I said,
okay,
I have my curriculum,
I have my structure Crick them,

1137
00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:21.120
whatever we do this week we do that same class in three or six months from now,

1138
00:57:21.121 --> 00:57:24.300
depending on if it's the intermediate or fundamental curriculum.
By take my film,

1139
00:57:24.301 --> 00:57:28.440
my,
my phone,
I record the videos.
My mainly with Tj Dillashaw recorded like,

1140
00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:30.980
this is the drill that you do.
Boom,
here's life.
Boom.

1141
00:57:31.290 --> 00:57:33.900
Now you're going to do this drill five for five or one four rounded piece.

1142
00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:35.430
Depends on what it is and what we could just as well,

1143
00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:38.820
but I send them exactly what fucking droves and Columbus to do that week.

1144
00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:41.890
Each and every week.
I send that shit out and I'm very proud of that.
Come on.

1145
00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:43.740
I know too much not to teach them and I love it.

1146
00:57:43.741 --> 00:57:47.160
I wish I had this for me when I was coming up and I'm like,
I'm,
I just,

1147
00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:51.510
I love life now.
It's fucking,
it's fucking cool.
I have you on Adderall,
right?
No,

1148
00:57:51.570 --> 00:57:54.930
I'm on my [inaudible].
I got whatever.
What's this?

1149
00:57:54.931 --> 00:57:58.590
Coffee bulletproof and I took four Alpha brains battle.
Dude.
I'm telling you man,

1150
00:57:58.591 --> 00:57:59.900
like this is fucking,
I love the Po.

1151
00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:01.890
<v 1>Good Times for Alpha brain.</v>

1152
00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:05.370
I think you can get away with by far the way I was only joking about the Alpha

1153
00:58:05.371 --> 00:58:06.930
brain or how of a male thing.

1154
00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:10.170
You can get away with it because people call us death squad,

1155
00:58:10.171 --> 00:58:13.900
which is way do sheer right.
As long as you act cool man,
the name,

1156
00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:14.753
they'll be all right.

1157
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:18.210
<v 2>It's making your heart pound.</v>

1158
00:58:21.350 --> 00:58:24.490
It's like we're trending like I'm passionate and I love that.
You didn't know.

1159
00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:26.640
I mean,
I fucking,
I love life man.
I love it.
I mean I have,

1160
00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:29.730
I kept through so much bullshit as a child to come.

1161
00:58:29.731 --> 00:58:32.050
I'm happy I could do what the fuck I wanted to do right now.
You know,

1162
00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.570
I love life,
man.
It's fucking cool.

1163
00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:36.930
I get to make the decisions that I want to fucking make as an adult now and
well,

1164
00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:39.450
most of the decisions anyway,
so it,
you know,
it's good man.
That's good.

1165
00:58:39.451 --> 00:58:40.920
I'm living through these guys.
You know,

1166
00:58:40.921 --> 00:58:42.950
they're going to get the fucking world title.
It's going to be Benevides.

1167
00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:45.270
Are Chad first upon who?
You know,
what shot we get first.

1168
00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:47.100
I'm a game plan the fuck out of that and,

1169
00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:50.250
but I'm going to get painted in there and makes sure that there I'm going to

1170
00:58:50.251 --> 00:58:53.010
have,
ask them to do what I feel they need to do for the fight.

1171
00:58:53.010 --> 00:58:54.680
I'm not trying to make them me.
I mean you're,

1172
00:58:54.681 --> 00:58:57.870
and you're just enjoying watching fucking boy this shit.
Yeah,
man.

1173
00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:01.740
Like I mean I'm learning to the point now that when I have a good time,

1174
00:59:01.741 --> 00:59:03.810
like this Rogan podcast where we train or I'm in the fights,

1175
00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:07.200
I'm learning to embrace that shit a hundred fucking percent as much as I can.

1176
00:59:07.350 --> 00:59:09.330
And then when I have a problem or a difficult time,

1177
00:59:09.450 --> 00:59:11.430
I'm stepping away and looking at that from the sites.

1178
00:59:11.431 --> 00:59:12.840
I didn't want to be wrapped up in the problems.

1179
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:15.600
I want to look at the site at the problems from the distance and we have a good

1180
00:59:15.601 --> 00:59:15.841
time.

1181
00:59:15.841 --> 00:59:18.450
When I'm in that cage and I'm walking these guys out and I'm fucking holding

1182
00:59:18.451 --> 00:59:19.530
myths and all the podcasts.

1183
00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:23.000
I'm trying to enjoy this shit to the full potential I can cause I know I'm going

1184
00:59:23.001 --> 00:59:25.370
to be on this fucking earth for however,
however long I'm going to be.

1185
00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:26.780
Knock your shit off Tj.

1186
00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:33.560
I fucking,
I just,
I love this shit man.
I do like said I love it.

1187
00:59:35.250 --> 00:59:38.950
You're mad.
Like I love it man.
It's like,

1188
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:44.810
well I want to make sure other motherfuckers love their life too.

1189
00:59:44.811 --> 00:59:47.930
So they need to make the decision that they needed to make fucking happy doing

1190
00:59:47.931 --> 00:59:50.750
something that people enjoy and doing something that you can,

1191
00:59:50.751 --> 00:59:53.180
you can help people with is one of the keys to happiness.

1192
00:59:53.181 --> 00:59:54.980
That's one of the things too.
I'm seeing these guys know,

1193
00:59:54.981 --> 00:59:57.920
get better human beings at martial artist that is making me feel good.

1194
00:59:57.970 --> 00:59:59.090
Why isn't it an interesting thing?

1195
00:59:59.091 --> 01:00:02.780
It's like being a fighter and being a training partner are two very different

1196
01:00:02.781 --> 01:00:06.470
things and then being a trainer or as another very different thing and a lot of

1197
01:00:06.471 --> 01:00:10.100
people don't understand that like to be a good training partner you have to,

1198
01:00:10.101 --> 01:00:12.540
first of all,
you have to know where a fighter is in the,

1199
01:00:12.541 --> 01:00:14.600
in their development unit that got,
I'm not taking advantage of them.

1200
01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.910
You got to not hit him when,
when you know they're fucking,

1201
01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:21.350
they're doing five fresh guys in a row.
Don't be a dick head.
Just make them work.

1202
01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.330
Make the guy work and that's what you're supposed to be doing.

1203
01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:26.600
I asked the guys at the gym,
I tell him,
you know,
I ask them,

1204
01:00:26.610 --> 01:00:29.420
you interrupted me now bitch.
Yes I did.
You ready to go?
What the hell?

1205
01:00:29.421 --> 01:00:34.300
It's beat him up there.
What I was going to start carry on.

1206
01:00:34.570 --> 01:00:38.820
I'm just kidding.
To carry on.
It's being trainers another,

1207
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:39.710
that's the next thing.

1208
01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:43.820
It's a completely different thing and in that your benefiting entirely on other

1209
01:00:43.821 --> 01:00:46.230
people benefiting from you and you,

1210
01:00:46.231 --> 01:00:50.000
you take your pride in molding them as fighters,
you know?
Sure.

1211
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:53.140
It's a very different experience though,
right?
It is different experience in it,

1212
01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:56.000
but it's something I've been doing since I 1990 way is just,
you know,

1213
01:00:56.001 --> 01:00:59.090
helping press athletes training.
There's this cause I need to train the partners.

1214
01:00:59.091 --> 01:01:00.470
I'm trying to get to know them.
What if I'm doing this,
you know,

1215
01:01:00.471 --> 01:01:03.470
look out for this and just helping people break things down,

1216
01:01:03.471 --> 01:01:06.470
help them to help coach me as well.
So it's been a give and take.

1217
01:01:06.471 --> 01:01:09.650
And now for me to do it full time man.
And again,
I'm not going to say it,

1218
01:01:09.651 --> 01:01:12.820
but I love it.
Are you,
are you,
do you think you're happier as a trainer then?

1219
01:01:12.821 --> 01:01:17.420
You were as a fighter as I was too stressed and I'm,
you know,
I understood,
um,

1220
01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:20.330
that,
you know,
you know,
when,
when the fight,
I'm going to make so much.

1221
01:01:20.331 --> 01:01:22.140
If I didn't want to fight,
I'm gonna make this much.
And that was,

1222
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:25.640
that was a hard thing for me.
And I've,
I've reached my,
um,
like in 2004,

1223
01:01:25.641 --> 01:01:28.910
after I won my second world title,
I'll kickboxing though.
It was tough.

1224
01:01:28.911 --> 01:01:30.380
First of all,
the time.
It was MMA with chance.

1225
01:01:30.381 --> 01:01:33.420
And then my second world title was a tight box will title.
So once I made,

1226
01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.020
once I did that,
I completed the goals that I set in my life.

1227
01:01:36.021 --> 01:01:37.870
And then from there things changed.
We could look at that,

1228
01:01:37.871 --> 01:01:40.780
just the statistics and my record.
It was blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
boom.
Maybe,

1229
01:01:40.781 --> 01:01:43.880
you know,
lost your tooth.
Baboom baboom kicking everybody's ass,
but doing good.

1230
01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.940
And then at 2004,
my one or my second world title,
it just went bump,
bump,
bump,

1231
01:01:46.941 --> 01:01:49.170
bump,
bump up.
You just lost your enthusiasm again.
Yep.

1232
01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:53.030
Was it just a matter of just not being able to keep up and needed our PM's or

1233
01:01:53.031 --> 01:01:55.560
was it the training environment?
Uh,
you know,

1234
01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:57.560
I'm not quite sure where to push the blame,

1235
01:01:57.561 --> 01:02:00.410
but the main thing for me to say blame,
well,
you know,

1236
01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:02.510
it's supposed to really look at it obviously right life.

1237
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:06.860
But I just had a goal to win the world title,
kickboxing world title.

1238
01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.710
When I was a child,
my first world title is anyway,
we'll title.

1239
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:10.880
I didn't complete my goal,

1240
01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:15.080
so I went for the world that kickbox won't title came around and I finally got

1241
01:02:15.081 --> 01:02:16.520
it.
So then that just changed things for me.

1242
01:02:16.530 --> 01:02:18.920
I should've said I set my goals too low.
Basically I think title,

1243
01:02:18.921 --> 01:02:20.130
did you have an MMA?
Uh,

1244
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:23.550
when I fought Jens Pulver and UCC in the candidate when I'll just first,

1245
01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:25.410
I think his first fight and once he left he left the UFC.

1246
01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:31.550
That was a quick knockout to right.
Correct.
Yeah,
yeah.
That was,
yeah,
that was,
um,

1247
01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:35.160
when you were,
you know,
you were really super fucking sharp back then.

1248
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:38.460
Really Super Sharp,
especially what you're striking.
Yep.
Correct.
Yeah.
Oh,
you know,

1249
01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:40.380
I was healthy,
I was enthusiastic and then you're good.

1250
01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:42.600
But when it went to one of my second world title,

1251
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:45.480
you had to set my goals too low.
And then I started like searching for,
okay,

1252
01:02:45.481 --> 01:02:47.700
I need certain opponent to motivate me,
or I need a,
you know,

1253
01:02:47.701 --> 01:02:50.160
a certain train to get me.
I need to go train here.
Starts searching for things.

1254
01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:52.440
Maybe,
maybe Monday is going to motivate me and I started looking,

1255
01:02:52.441 --> 01:02:54.300
searching for things to motivate me because it was just,

1256
01:02:54.301 --> 01:02:57.180
I'm just very black and white and I'm going to win a world title.
I set my goal,

1257
01:02:57.181 --> 01:03:00.990
I went to,
I got this and I was Kinda like,
now what?
Do you ever stop and go,
damn,

1258
01:03:00.991 --> 01:03:03.810
I wish I had somebody like meet training me.
I say that 100% man.

1259
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:05.790
That's why I tell these fucking guys to like,
you know,

1260
01:03:05.791 --> 01:03:08.920
I'm there coaching them like I'm there for them.
Like pay attention.

1261
01:03:08.921 --> 01:03:12.000
Like don't waste my fucking time.
Don't show up play.
Don't do,
don't do the drill.

1262
01:03:12.001 --> 01:03:14.130
Halfass we're doing split seconds and fractions of an inch.

1263
01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.200
It's got to be fucking done.
Right or don't fucking do it.

1264
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:19.170
And there's more money in MMA now.
There's more money in a way now for sure.

1265
01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:21.180
Back when you were in king in the cage.
Yeah.

1266
01:03:21.181 --> 01:03:24.990
My first couple of my first two fights.
Can the kids,
you've got zero money.
Yeah,

1267
01:03:24.991 --> 01:03:28.260
the,
the king of the cage.
When,
when you pulled off the karate kid.
Oh.
Storytime.

1268
01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:30.950
All right,
here we go.
Range.
And so,
um,
it was uh,
you know,

1269
01:03:30.951 --> 01:03:32.260
I was nervous for the fight.
We'll still,

1270
01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:36.030
apparently the promoter told me that that fight or wanted to,

1271
01:03:36.031 --> 01:03:38.970
he asked to fight me.
So I took that personal,
let's go.
Okay.
Right.
Mother fucker.

1272
01:03:38.971 --> 01:03:42.460
He wanted to fight me.
So I'm backstage,
I'm a little know,
not little,

1273
01:03:42.461 --> 01:03:43.530
I'm nervous as fuck for the fight.

1274
01:03:43.531 --> 01:03:46.380
And so boss sees that I'm nervous and he wants me to relax.
He goes,
Hey Dwayne,

1275
01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:49.650
if you want throw him off,
do the credit kit.
And I'm like,
hey.
I'm like,

1276
01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:52.320
I look back at it now,
I see what he's trying to do to relax me.

1277
01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:55.380
But at the time when like fuck boss and I'm nervous as fuck him,
go find like,

1278
01:03:55.381 --> 01:03:56.214
you know,
knocking off.

1279
01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:59.110
So I got to the point of the fight where I was just talking him up.
I,
you know,

1280
01:03:59.120 --> 01:03:59.791
I had my wings,

1281
01:03:59.791 --> 01:04:02.700
I was doing what I wanted and then it just came to me just to kind of little

1282
01:04:02.701 --> 01:04:04.560
tribute to boss to do that.
You credit the kid and then,

1283
01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:07.530
then I went back to fighting and then they,
uh,
you know,
they stopped about,

1284
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:10.620
but so,
you know,
I took that.
That's what my angel logo.

1285
01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:13.440
It was a couple pieces to that.
You know,
it's doing the credit kid as far as I,

1286
01:04:13.441 --> 01:04:14.310
it should be two boss.

1287
01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:17.400
It's got the wings because I feel like I always make the right decisions.

1288
01:04:17.401 --> 01:04:20.970
I don't screw people over.
Give an angel watching over.

1289
01:04:20.971 --> 01:04:24.660
You well know that it's just,
you know,
yeah.
For me you are.
It's just,
it's,

1290
01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:28.140
it's part of me is I feel like I always do the right things and the heads bowed

1291
01:04:28.141 --> 01:04:30.000
down as far as the,
you know,
show I'm not above people.

1292
01:04:30.001 --> 01:04:32.670
I'm just doing what I feel is right in life.
That's,
go get yourself some wings.

1293
01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:35.800
I gave myself some nice yes,
yes.
Trademark and my shit or cons.

1294
01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:40.980
Do you know that shit is fucking nastiest animals self like puppy ears?

1295
01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:46.800
No welcome.
Everybody wants to be an eagle.
Nobody wants to be a puppy.

1296
01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:51.600
Puppies are like way sweeter than Eagle,
Eagle Eda,

1297
01:04:51.601 --> 01:04:54.380
puppy mother fucker.
Right out of your hands.
Flat.
We'll see.

1298
01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.930
Took him off to a tree top and it probably is going to work.
His footwork,

1299
01:04:56.970 --> 01:04:59.610
you know,
he's basically,
he's got to be moving on the fucker.
Let's go.

1300
01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:01.870
That's rude.
He's a baby.
You know,
we got to,

1301
01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:03.960
the parents should have been watching the fucking kid.
Right.

1302
01:05:03.961 --> 01:05:08.820
It's true little bangs always training middle.
Yeah.
For Real.
If he sees the logo,

1303
01:05:08.821 --> 01:05:11.550
like he's watching the highlight video this morning that just got finished
today.

1304
01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:14.970
He sees the angel local.
He goes,
that's me.
So it's awesome.
My little boy,

1305
01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:17.980
his name is Dwayne Bang,
led my low boy.
So his mast and

1306
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.920
<v 1>have a third baby on the way.
And uh,
his middle name is going to be boss,</v>

1307
01:05:20.921 --> 01:05:22.300
so that's going to be okay.
I was going to say,

1308
01:05:22.301 --> 01:05:27.280
you can't name him Dwayne to go go.
It's Duane.
Bang,
Bang,
Bang,

1309
01:05:27.281 --> 01:05:31.870
Bang.
Like George who are forming,
I guess they bought his kids George.

1310
01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:37.150
He did.
Yeah,
he did.
I remember that.
He was a bad motherfucker.
Yeah,
for sure.

1311
01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:40.810
It was just too bad to have other kids like to have kids without his name.

1312
01:05:40.811 --> 01:05:44.480
He's like,
nope,
nope,
nope,
nope.
I like George.
You can't name them all with George.

1313
01:05:44.481 --> 01:05:47.980
Yeah.
Well,
yes I can.
I can.
I will bitch.

1314
01:05:47.981 --> 01:05:51.250
You know who I am exactly.
Like I'm not a regular dude.

1315
01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:55.090
Like he feels like he can get away with shit that other people can't and he's

1316
01:05:55.091 --> 01:05:56.560
right.
You know,

1317
01:05:56.770 --> 01:06:00.580
I mean into people that try to stop that he's going to cause kids George,

1318
01:06:00.581 --> 01:06:03.590
and you're going to have to fucking deal with it.
That's life.

1319
01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:08.190
That means you're a bad man.
No,
we positioned for the fast and I got to come,

1320
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:11.110
you know,
around like they said no,
but you kept help pushing for me.

1321
01:06:11.111 --> 01:06:13.990
And then the fans and the finally Dana white stepped in is like,
okay,
no,

1322
01:06:13.991 --> 01:06:15.370
it's official with the UFC.
So,

1323
01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:19.240
but it's only a faster by 10 hundredths or the salmon,
amateur MMA historian.

1324
01:06:19.330 --> 01:06:21.460
So for me it was like,
that's,
you know,

1325
01:06:21.461 --> 01:06:24.250
I have all these details sort of stored in my head.

1326
01:06:24.610 --> 01:06:26.920
I don't really carry it around on a computer.

1327
01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:30.610
Like I literally have all these details because I love MMA.

1328
01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.920
So for me it was always a travesty.
It was like,

1329
01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:37.420
we're going to bring up the record that you got to bring back a Bang Ludwig.

1330
01:06:37.421 --> 01:06:39.400
So someone will bring up the record.
I'll go,
well,

1331
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:41.140
but it's not the real record cause Twain Ben Lowe,

1332
01:06:41.141 --> 01:06:42.640
which should have the fucking record.
That sounds cool.

1333
01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:45.580
That's just the fact that I appreciate that.
But as an a story in,

1334
01:06:45.581 --> 01:06:49.720
as an MMA historian,
every fight has an asterick and Jon Jones has one lot,
okay,

1335
01:06:49.721 --> 01:06:50.554
you can call it that.

1336
01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:53.560
But he beat the fuck out of Matt Hamill and he was a smashing him.

1337
01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:56.470
And the only reason why that 12 to six elbows illegals,

1338
01:06:56.471 --> 01:06:59.350
because when the athletic commission met with big John McCarthy,

1339
01:06:59.530 --> 01:07:02.770
they were concerned about those dudes on ESPN at six o'clock in the morning,

1340
01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:06.490
they're smashing bricks from your elbows feel like you can't do that brick

1341
01:07:06.491 --> 01:07:10.060
smashing move.
That shit's too powerful.
And so everybody's like,
all right.
But me,

1342
01:07:10.061 --> 01:07:14.080
while like maybe it's arguable that this elbow is more powerful than the

1343
01:07:14.081 --> 01:07:14.920
downward elbow,

1344
01:07:14.921 --> 01:07:18.040
like the downward elbow doesn't seem to have as much weight behind it as like

1345
01:07:18.041 --> 01:07:21.600
the,
uh,
a straight elbow.
How's it any more dangerous,
you know what I mean?

1346
01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:24.310
Exactly.
Doesn't make any sense,
but we're stuck with it.

1347
01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:26.530
We're like totally completely stuck with it.

1348
01:07:26.531 --> 01:07:30.010
That's legal and Thai boxing come down totally.
Should be legal.
It's an elbow.

1349
01:07:30.250 --> 01:07:32.830
I mean if you can hit a guy with a knee,
the face,
you're telling me you can't,

1350
01:07:33.010 --> 01:07:36.490
you're not fucking hard and needs the face.
You can hit them with that,

1351
01:07:36.491 --> 01:07:37.900
but you can't hit him with an elbow like that.

1352
01:07:37.901 --> 01:07:41.350
That is ridiculous and need might be three times harder than an elbow.

1353
01:07:41.650 --> 01:07:45.850
You know like what you see what Allister did to Travis Brown's body like God

1354
01:07:45.970 --> 01:07:49.720
damn nobody throws needs to the fucking body.
Like the Rheem.

1355
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:53.110
He can crack some for sure.
Watching it in real life.

1356
01:07:53.111 --> 01:07:54.850
It's like he's doing something totally different.

1357
01:07:54.851 --> 01:07:57.040
Like everybody's doing one thing,
but when he's doing,

1358
01:07:57.060 --> 01:08:00.790
it's like he's going through your fucking body.

1359
01:08:01.030 --> 01:08:04.240
But that Travis Brown,
you can't teach that kind of heart.

1360
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:08.500
You can't teach that shit.
That dude has zero give up in him.

1361
01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:09.640
It is nothing.

1362
01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:14.080
If he had 1% give up in him and if I show the percent the fights over,

1363
01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:16.700
he literally weathered the craziest

1364
01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:21.290
<v 0>nuclear fucking winter storm,
you know,
solar fucking flares.</v>

1365
01:08:21.291 --> 01:08:25.880
He weathered the craziest shit ever.
But because he didn't take it to the head,

1366
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:29.420
it was all just about him having the guts and the heart to power through it.

1367
01:08:29.690 --> 01:08:33.110
If Alster hit him with those shots in the head,
his body would just shut off.

1368
01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.120
But because he took him to the body,

1369
01:08:35.270 --> 01:08:39.800
like his heart got him through one of the craziest beatings I have ever

1370
01:08:39.801 --> 01:08:44.060
witnessed,
anybody survived and then overcome in the same fucking Brown.

1371
01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:48.200
I mean that's one of the greatest come from behind rounds of all time.

1372
01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:51.140
I actually missed that fight.
It's gonna come back.

1373
01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.230
We were walking back through,
right?

1374
01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.070
<v 2>It was in and we were walking back to the riots fight cause you were,</v>

1375
01:08:58.071 --> 01:08:59.120
I was on the car.
You ride favor.

1376
01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:02.180
So we were walking back through the tunnel after his fight.
As they are fighting,

1377
01:09:02.181 --> 01:09:04.670
we're doing this doctor check and such.
So I was backstage,

1378
01:09:04.671 --> 01:09:06.500
but as we're walking through one of the rooms they here.
Oh.

1379
01:09:06.501 --> 01:09:08.840
And I'm like fuck it's ever went through it.
People ahead to the window.

1380
01:09:08.841 --> 01:09:10.210
And then I see Allister just dropping.

1381
01:09:10.570 --> 01:09:12.620
<v 0>What's the craziest fight ever?
I got to watch that.</v>

1382
01:09:12.621 --> 01:09:14.870
One of the craziest fights ever.
I wonder if we could show it.

1383
01:09:14.871 --> 01:09:17.770
I need to get permission from Dana white if we could just show these things.

1384
01:09:17.771 --> 01:09:20.840
Cause sometimes they pull youtube video for folks who don't know,

1385
01:09:20.841 --> 01:09:22.340
like if shit gets pulled off a youtube,

1386
01:09:22.341 --> 01:09:25.880
a lot of times there's a Bot that just searches for certain names.

1387
01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:29.480
Like if you write UFC in a title,
I'll just Yank our shit.

1388
01:09:29.481 --> 01:09:32.370
They'll just take it offline.
So you know,
why are you,

1389
01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:36.310
and there's a lot of videos that have me online that had been the,
they,

1390
01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:39.800
they put advertisements on,
there's a company does that.
They'll do it,

1391
01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:41.960
they'll do it for you.
Like if it's your content,
they,

1392
01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:45.470
they put your content online,
you put an advertising and you'd get like,

1393
01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.970
I'm just like a penny oh adsense account or something.
It's,
it's,

1394
01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:51.920
it's a fascinating thing.
But for the UFC they don't play.

1395
01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:55.700
So if it says UFC anywhere in the video they just yank it,
just pull it off.

1396
01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:59.270
<v 4>Is there a law that if their TVs in the background and you're filming like with</v>

1397
01:09:59.271 --> 01:10:00.440
your cell phone it,

1398
01:10:00.441 --> 01:10:05.060
that that's legal because that seems like when you ever like you searched Miley

1399
01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:09.470
Cyrus from like a MTV last night and it's only the ones that are like people

1400
01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:10.700
like filming their TV.

1401
01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:14.000
And that's why I always wondered if people always had like a TV behind him to

1402
01:10:14.001 --> 01:10:17.000
show him like video clips and stuff like that.
Cause that's kind of like

1403
01:10:17.290 --> 01:10:21.460
<v 0>that's a,
well I know,
I do know that one thing that if you have a video,</v>

1404
01:10:21.461 --> 01:10:22.660
like say if you have a video,

1405
01:10:22.661 --> 01:10:26.680
like a scene from a movie that that scene from a movie has a digital signature

1406
01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:29.710
that they can find that digital signature on like youtube.

1407
01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.480
So like a song as well.

1408
01:10:31.481 --> 01:10:35.440
Like a song has a digital signature and so they can do a search on that digital

1409
01:10:35.441 --> 01:10:38.410
signature.
So if this stays,
there's a Paul Mccartney band on the run,

1410
01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:40.120
the plan band on the run in a video,

1411
01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:43.390
they can find that that has band on the run in it somehow or another,

1412
01:10:43.391 --> 01:10:44.224
they can do that.

1413
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:49.470
If you take it and you fill it with your phone and obviously I'm an idiot to not

1414
01:10:50.021 --> 01:10:53.560
listen to me here.
I'm speculating nothing about computers,

1415
01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.930
but from my idiot perspective,

1416
01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.390
I would imagine that it would have a different digital signature.

1417
01:10:58.390 --> 01:11:00.590
It'd be a different length.
The sound quality would be,

1418
01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:03.040
we would be different if you were doing it from my phone,

1419
01:11:03.041 --> 01:11:05.270
you'd have the ambient noise of the room that you're doing in.

1420
01:11:05.271 --> 01:11:06.850
You might have your breathe,
you might Fart,

1421
01:11:07.050 --> 01:11:08.920
and maybe a lot of shit that's on the video.
It's not in there.

1422
01:11:09.010 --> 01:11:11.430
So I might not recognize it,
but that's just,
I don't even know why.

1423
01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.560
Speculate like fucking wasted all your time.

1424
01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:19.280
People out there going,
oh yeah,
Joe Rogan says it's just

1425
01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:26.590
keep on questioning everything.
You can't stop on that show the question again.

1426
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:30.120
The one I,
I'm done questioning things with the one with,
with the,

1427
01:11:30.121 --> 01:11:33.270
with chem trails that like,
I don't know either way,
I'm not fucking up there,

1428
01:11:33.271 --> 01:11:36.480
but there is a difference between the ones that that do dissipate.
Correct.

1429
01:11:36.481 --> 01:11:39.620
You know right away and the ones that stick around.
Well

1430
01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:46.160
absolutely not a scientist nor in anything that I will say on any,

1431
01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:51.030
whether it's about fucking air travel or space exploration.

1432
01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:52.410
Anything that I'll say on anything,

1433
01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:56.300
the caveat that must be stated is I don't know what the fuck I'm talking.
Yeah.

1434
01:11:56.610 --> 01:11:57.600
I have no education.

1435
01:11:57.601 --> 01:12:00.960
These subjects that I'm merely reiterating things that I've heard people say

1436
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.810
online.
If you were to say that everyone would think so though.

1437
01:12:03.811 --> 01:12:06.290
You know what I mean?
You still confident about the problem problem?

1438
01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.113
Well it's just,

1439
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:12.330
especially if I'm wrong and I'm super confident that that's how cold it gets

1440
01:12:12.331 --> 01:12:16.170
started.
The um,
yeah,
people are confident people want to listen to him,

1441
01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:18.690
but I'm super honest about what I know and I don't know.

1442
01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.150
I'm fucking as honest as,
as humanly possible,

1443
01:12:21.151 --> 01:12:24.600
even if it makes it look like an asshole.
But in in that situation,

1444
01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:26.850
I do know for a fact that when,

1445
01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:31.320
when Khan trails or more likely there's a map on the NASA website,

1446
01:12:31.530 --> 01:12:35.460
you can go to the NASA website and they'll show you where countries will linger

1447
01:12:35.461 --> 01:12:37.890
in the sky and where they won't.
In fact,

1448
01:12:37.891 --> 01:12:42.120
in 1942 the government was doing a research project on what they called

1449
01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:44.340
persistent condensation trails.

1450
01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:48.480
And what they discovered is during various atmosphere conditions,

1451
01:12:48.481 --> 01:12:51.930
whether there's a lot of moisture in the atmosphere or less moisture,

1452
01:12:52.170 --> 01:12:54.180
depending on what the conditions are,

1453
01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:57.240
it will change the length of the controls that appear behind jets.

1454
01:12:57.510 --> 01:13:00.210
And when you burn jet fuel,
it creates moisture.

1455
01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:03.360
And when you create moisture out of that burning jet fuel and it changes the

1456
01:13:03.361 --> 01:13:05.430
temperature of the air as it passes through like that,

1457
01:13:05.431 --> 01:13:06.720
you literally create a cloud.

1458
01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:09.270
And so when people are looking at that and thinking,
oh,

1459
01:13:09.271 --> 01:13:11.280
the government's spraying us with thick clouds,

1460
01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:14.160
it's very easy to think that it's very easy.

1461
01:13:14.161 --> 01:13:19.161
And this does not mean that they haven't done tests and really unethical things

1462
01:13:20.461 --> 01:13:23.430
with spraying aerosols from planes.
We know they have.

1463
01:13:23.431 --> 01:13:27.360
We know that pesticides are sprayed from planes.
Okay,
so we were,
we're familiar.

1464
01:13:27.361 --> 01:13:29.670
We have that archetype in our head of spraying poison.

1465
01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:33.840
We've seen the footage from Vietnam when they sprayed agent orange to defoliate

1466
01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:36.660
vast parts and jungles.
We've seen all that shit.

1467
01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:40.770
So we're wary of things that are sprayed from planes and you should be,

1468
01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:45.180
but you should also know that there is a huge difference between that and what

1469
01:13:45.181 --> 01:13:49.080
you're seeing in the sky on a regular basis.
And when you start saying that,

1470
01:13:49.081 --> 01:13:51.780
what you're seeing this guy on a regular basis is the government's spraying

1471
01:13:51.810 --> 01:13:52.643
chemicals.

1472
01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:56.880
You really throw a monkey wrench into the whole idea of them actually spraying

1473
01:13:56.881 --> 01:13:59.120
chemicals because first of all,
if they,
the,

1474
01:13:59.121 --> 01:14:02.250
the argument is they're spraying a aluminum and Barium.
Again,

1475
01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:04.680
I'm not a scientist,
I'm half retarded.
Again,

1476
01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:07.140
it took a lot of shots to the head as a youngster.

1477
01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:11.070
But the reality is if they did spray aluminum and Barium,

1478
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:13.450
the sky wouldn't linger like a cloud.

1479
01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.270
It's a lingering like a cloud because it's a cloud.

1480
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:21.490
And I know a lot of people have invested a long amount of their life wanting to

1481
01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:23.440
think that what they're seeing is chemicals.

1482
01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:27.130
And so it fucks with you because it's hard to admit you're wrong.

1483
01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:31.600
It's hard to change gears and we all know that.
Correct,
but in this situation,

1484
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:33.820
we have to look at it.

1485
01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:37.030
There might be times when someone's spraying something from the sky,

1486
01:14:37.150 --> 01:14:41.860
but the majority of what you're seeing is just a byproduct of a jet engine going

1487
01:14:41.861 --> 01:14:44.800
through condensation.
And then there's the reality.
People say,
well,

1488
01:14:44.801 --> 01:14:48.310
are they geoengineering?
No,
but yes.
So here's the reality.

1489
01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:53.400
The reality is even though it's just an accidental byproduct of jet travel,

1490
01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:58.960
it does change the environment and it is geoengineering,
but it's not on purpose,

1491
01:14:58.961 --> 01:15:01.930
not on purpose.
It's just a part of flying.
If we're going to have,

1492
01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:06.130
there's 93,000 fucking flights a day worldwide a day,

1493
01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.760
so they're burning jet fuel in the sky above your head.

1494
01:15:09.761 --> 01:15:14.761
They're taking toxic fuel in fucking hundred gallon wings full of this shit.

1495
01:15:14.981 --> 01:15:19.540
Your wings are filled up with fucking fuel and they're burning that shit up in

1496
01:15:19.541 --> 01:15:23.260
the sky.
And creating clouds.
Fuck yeah,
it changes the environment,

1497
01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:26.680
but it's just like pollution changes the environment.

1498
01:15:26.681 --> 01:15:28.270
In La when you're driving on the highway,

1499
01:15:28.271 --> 01:15:31.780
it's not the government's sprang pollution.
Okay.
It's fucking pollution.

1500
01:15:31.810 --> 01:15:36.730
It's just a byproduct of human civilization and a byproduct of air travel is a,

1501
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:38.740
they're burning jet fuel in the sky and be,

1502
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:43.330
it creates persistent condensation trails under certain atmospheric conditions.

1503
01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:48.340
This is the best that I could discern after research and talking to real
experts,

1504
01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:49.960
but this does it and this is where he'll go,

1505
01:15:49.961 --> 01:15:52.390
you're a fucking Douche or permission urgent Joe Rogan's working for the

1506
01:15:52.391 --> 01:15:53.150
government.

1507
01:15:53.150 --> 01:15:57.760
You got to stop and look at this shit rationally if you're wrong about the

1508
01:15:57.761 --> 01:16:01.600
majority of what you see in the sky,
you discredit the possibility,

1509
01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:04.750
the very real possibility that things have been done.

1510
01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:08.470
Like there's a study about Saint Louis,
I think it was Saint Louis.
Hold on,
let,

1511
01:16:08.471 --> 01:16:10.240
let me,
let me pull this up.
St Louis.

1512
01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:14.590
There was a something that was in the news really recently that they discovered

1513
01:16:14.591 --> 01:16:17.740
radiation.
I think Kim trouser,
just an excuse for pansies.

1514
01:16:17.741 --> 01:16:21.470
I'm just like to look at clouds and there want something like a reason.

1515
01:16:22.690 --> 01:16:26.140
I'm just curious on what,
why,
why some stick around and white and why some don't.

1516
01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:29.380
Okay,
so they're here.
Well,
this is because of atmospheric conditions.

1517
01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.870
It's a difference between,
sometimes it rains and sometimes it doesn't.

1518
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:34.180
Sometimes there's clouds,
sometimes there's nothing in this guy.

1519
01:16:34.410 --> 01:16:38.800
The conditions apparently when it's right before a crowd,
like it's Kinda hazy.

1520
01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:42.040
Those are the conditions that are best for creating these persistent

1521
01:16:42.041 --> 01:16:45.220
condensation trails and people have to understand these are fucking southwest

1522
01:16:45.221 --> 01:16:48.520
airlines flights you're looking at.
Sometimes people will either,
these are,

1523
01:16:48.521 --> 01:16:51.220
you know,
unmarked government planes,
man.
Do you really know that?

1524
01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:53.440
What kind of fucking Eric,
what kind of telescope do you have?

1525
01:16:53.441 --> 01:16:55.900
How much research have you actually done?
Or are you like me?

1526
01:16:55.901 --> 01:17:00.220
Do you just reiterate sure that you learn online doing this show and doing the

1527
01:17:00.221 --> 01:17:04.420
show on chem trails.
More people got fucking mad at me because of chem trails.

1528
01:17:04.421 --> 01:17:07.270
Then anything,
and I take part of the blame for that.

1529
01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:10.490
One of the reasons why is because I think they did a shitty job of editing it

1530
01:17:10.491 --> 01:17:13.520
and this is no disrespect,
but the way that people edit that show,

1531
01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:16.970
they have eight hours of footage.
They have to slam down to 44 minutes.

1532
01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:17.803
It's sit to them.

1533
01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:22.350
It wasn't important to totally completely explain what what causes a chemistry.

1534
01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:25.430
I didn't have 100% say or a contrail rather.

1535
01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:28.310
I didn't have 100% say as to how the show got edited.

1536
01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:32.050
I had say after the fact,
I would voice my opinion.

1537
01:17:32.051 --> 01:17:34.430
He would get overruled or they would listen to me.
It was,
it would,

1538
01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:39.020
it varied and in this I lost and in this I think we created a bad product.

1539
01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:43.400
I don't think it represented fully the the correct full explanation of what

1540
01:17:43.401 --> 01:17:46.520
controls are.
I think because it's such a complex issue,

1541
01:17:46.670 --> 01:17:50.030
I think we owed a very complex and scientific explanation,

1542
01:17:50.031 --> 01:17:52.280
but the problem is people think that Shit's boring.

1543
01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.810
Like what I just said right now,

1544
01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:57.190
the majority of people listening that would watch American idol would go pull.

1545
01:17:57.210 --> 01:18:00.860
What the fuck they just stopped.
Podcast is not for everybody.
You know,

1546
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:03.860
and this conversation is not for everybody,
but if you want to make a TV show,

1547
01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:07.490
it kind of has to be for everybody for the network to acceptance until it

1548
01:18:07.491 --> 01:18:10.670
becomes really successful or find its niche.
And then people,

1549
01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:13.490
you know like South Park,
they can do whatever the fuck they want.
You know,

1550
01:18:13.491 --> 01:18:16.160
cause it's a proven product.
If you had another show,

1551
01:18:16.161 --> 01:18:20.150
we tried to make a cartoon where a gay Guy Stuffing Paris Hilton up his ass and

1552
01:18:20.151 --> 01:18:23.660
winning a sloughed off,
they would go,
that's the fuck are you talking about?

1553
01:18:23.661 --> 01:18:24.830
No you can't do that.

1554
01:18:24.831 --> 01:18:29.270
But South Park is so successful and it is so proven in the market that they do

1555
01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:31.370
that well when you shows,
not proven,
you really can't.

1556
01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:34.220
It's hard to like have your say as to how things get done.

1557
01:18:34.221 --> 01:18:37.380
It's a complex dance and I don't think we pulled it off,
but it's,

1558
01:18:37.381 --> 01:18:40.430
it's part of the thing of creating something,
like when you try to create a show,

1559
01:18:40.730 --> 01:18:44.690
I feel personally responsible for it though because a lot of people got angry

1560
01:18:44.691 --> 01:18:47.120
and I think a lot of that anger could have been avoided.

1561
01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:50.810
When I first started looking at chem trails,
uh,
online,

1562
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:54.020
I too believe that it was a possibility.

1563
01:18:54.050 --> 01:18:56.510
Like is it possible to just pulling this off right in front of our face?

1564
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:59.650
They just spraying this guy.
But then the more you look into it,
you go,
no,

1565
01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:03.860
there's photos from 1980 that show these controls like long ones that lingered

1566
01:19:03.861 --> 01:19:07.910
in the sky.
People say,
when we were younger,
they didn't linger.
Actually they did.

1567
01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:10.550
You just don't remember.
Pay Attention.
How much the fuck do you pay attention to?

1568
01:19:10.551 --> 01:19:13.030
Clouds are created by Jen when you're eight,
you know,

1569
01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:15.230
can you really tell me exactly what the fuck do you saw?

1570
01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:18.470
I barely remember shit I did last week.
I mean,
I'm being honest.

1571
01:19:18.471 --> 01:19:22.820
I barely remember important shit.
I get like shows that I did that were great.

1572
01:19:22.821 --> 01:19:24.620
I got a standing ovation at Bailey.
Remember them?

1573
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.110
And you tell me you remember this fucking,
these,
these,

1574
01:19:27.111 --> 01:19:29.330
these con trails from when you were eight years old.

1575
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:31.790
Do you remember the football field that we did to fucking remember that Shit,

1576
01:19:31.791 --> 01:19:35.750
dude,
I learned,
I learned some stuff from Duane bank.com today,
man,

1577
01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:38.090
Dwayne Wade went to forget it either,
man.
But these,

1578
01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:39.950
these people that I'm talking to,

1579
01:19:39.951 --> 01:19:42.540
there's a problem with doing this show and this is why I don't know if I'm going

1580
01:19:42.541 --> 01:19:45.560
to continue doing it.
I mean,
first of all,
Scifi hasn't asked me to do it again,

1581
01:19:45.561 --> 01:19:47.690
but even if they do,
I have to really think about how it's,

1582
01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.940
I don't think I'm doing what I want to do.

1583
01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:53.240
I don't think it's coming out the way I want it to come out.
It's,
um,

1584
01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:56.210
there's part of it that is like,
there was an episode we did on transhumanism.

1585
01:19:56.211 --> 01:19:59.090
It's all like complicated the science of extending human life.

1586
01:19:59.110 --> 01:20:03.470
And I love that because I got to talk to all these super intelligent people and

1587
01:20:03.471 --> 01:20:07.710
pick their brain and ask really important to me questions.
I'd love that,

1588
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:10.530
but talking to people that are telling me they're seeing bulletproof wolves and

1589
01:20:10.531 --> 01:20:13.710
goes,
shit that pops out of the reserve,

1590
01:20:13.730 --> 01:20:18.450
a worm hole and out came a bulletproof wolf.
Oh,
that sure happened.

1591
01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:20.530
I'm sure you didn't have a camera and you,

1592
01:20:20.531 --> 01:20:23.930
why would you while you're out there hunting for bulletproof walls.
I just,

1593
01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:24.780
I got tired of it.

1594
01:20:24.810 --> 01:20:28.740
I got tired of talking to people that are just crazy people or silly people or

1595
01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:32.100
people that need a fucking hug.
There's a lot of that out.
That's true.

1596
01:20:32.101 --> 01:20:36.630
100% and there's also a lot of people that really believe what they are saying

1597
01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:38.850
and it's not because they're assholes,

1598
01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:42.690
it's because they lack critical thinking skills,

1599
01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:45.510
whether no one's taught it to them,
whether they've ignored them,

1600
01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:46.890
whether it's the way they were raised,

1601
01:20:46.891 --> 01:20:48.360
whether it's the environment they grew up in,

1602
01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:50.790
whether it was the idea that they were exposed to as a young person.

1603
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:53.490
I don't know what has caused the situation that we're talking about,

1604
01:20:53.491 --> 01:20:57.360
but there's a lot of people out there that are thinking in a very piss poor way

1605
01:20:57.361 --> 01:20:58.950
and I had been one of them in the past.
Man,

1606
01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:02.260
I bet I've believed in a lot of stupid shit in the past.
You know that I,

1607
01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:04.470
I was convinced probably was real.

1608
01:21:04.471 --> 01:21:07.730
There's a thing I was talking about this thing called rods.
These,
this,

1609
01:21:07.770 --> 01:21:08.610
this fucking,

1610
01:21:08.611 --> 01:21:11.270
they look like jellyfish that fly through the air faster than you could see.

1611
01:21:11.271 --> 01:21:12.990
There's a whole video on them.
Roswell,
bronze.

1612
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:15.390
Then I watched a show called monster quest would,

1613
01:21:15.391 --> 01:21:18.210
they showed what they really aren't.
System of video auto fact.

1614
01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:20.580
Like when you have a camera and it's going on slow motion,

1615
01:21:20.581 --> 01:21:23.940
it's something flies past in front of it,
stretches the image out and make it,

1616
01:21:23.941 --> 01:21:25.350
it's a blur.
It's fucking blur.

1617
01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:28.740
So I was convinced that these things were flying through the air all around us

1618
01:21:28.741 --> 01:21:31.330
cause I'd seen this video and I was like looking for him.

1619
01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:36.810
The guy who made this video does not want to admit that they don't,

1620
01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:38.610
they don't exist.
Not only that,

1621
01:21:38.611 --> 01:21:42.870
he actually showed up at the UFC expo when I was doing a Q and a and he asks,

1622
01:21:42.871 --> 01:21:46.320
he got in line and and said he needed to talk to me about Roswell rods and he's

1623
01:21:46.321 --> 01:21:48.570
coming on my podcast because they are real.

1624
01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:53.070
And a though those people on monster quest fucked him.
And they,
they had,

1625
01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:54.810
I don't know how they could have fucked him because they,

1626
01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:57.610
they basically showed the same scene.
There was a,

1627
01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:01.380
a campfire or a light and a bunch of bugs were flying in front of light and they

1628
01:22:01.381 --> 01:22:02.550
set two cameras in front of it.

1629
01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:06.280
One of them was an HD super fast camera that they use for like super slow Mo.

1630
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:09.310
And the other one was like a regular video camera with a regular video camera

1631
01:22:09.311 --> 01:22:12.360
show.
These rods there are flying across because it's an artifact.

1632
01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:16.680
And if you look at how it's flying across the video,
it's not flying that fast.

1633
01:22:16.681 --> 01:22:19.470
Like I can see it.
So how can I not see it with my eyes,

1634
01:22:19.471 --> 01:22:22.860
but I can see it on camera.
And then the other one just showed this just bugs.

1635
01:22:24.150 --> 01:22:28.460
Did you see the underwater ones and the choice?
Don't be real.

1636
01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:33.630
There is without a doubt.
Um,
information to government has been hiding.

1637
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:36.570
Dude,
what you're doing right now is called you.

1638
01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:40.650
You're making a plea to ridicule rods are just tiny chem trails.

1639
01:22:41.650 --> 01:22:46.500
Nice.
Yeah,
they,
they,
they might as well be,
you know,
I thought they were real man.

1640
01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:47.820
I really did.
You know,
I,

1641
01:22:47.821 --> 01:22:51.240
I saw a video once it showed that there were fucking buildings on the moon,

1642
01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:55.410
like display this lucky guy had he like had these images.
Oh,

1643
01:22:55.411 --> 01:22:58.380
even worse than that.
How about the face of Mars?
How about that motherfucker.

1644
01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:02.610
You ever see the face on Mars?
But there's images that people will swear to you.

1645
01:23:02.611 --> 01:23:06.700
The government is basically doctor does.
Second more high resolution images.

1646
01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:10.030
There was some photos they took a long time ago of Mars,

1647
01:23:10.031 --> 01:23:13.660
and as they flew over Mars,
it shows what looks like a five sided pyramid,

1648
01:23:13.661 --> 01:23:16.540
I think,
and a face,
a face on Mars.

1649
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:19.780
Even my own friend who I loved dearly,

1650
01:23:19.930 --> 01:23:23.320
Graham Hancock wrote a dumb ass book about all this.

1651
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:27.670
I love this friend dearly dumb.
It's dumb ass,
but he admits it was a mistake.

1652
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.710
He admits it,
but shit,
that shit's important,
man.

1653
01:23:32.130 --> 01:23:35.980
Clearly it's a faith if you look at the shape,
but it does not appear in nature.

1654
01:23:36.190 --> 01:23:38.110
This is are two [inaudible] pitch.

1655
01:23:38.111 --> 01:23:40.330
You don't know what the fuck you're looking at,
okay?

1656
01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:44.140
You're looking at a spot that you decide that that's like looking at the clouds

1657
01:23:44.141 --> 01:23:46.260
and thinking that you see in dragons.
You know,

1658
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:51.130
you also could be seen a fucked up cloud because cloud's aren't perfect

1659
01:23:51.190 --> 01:23:54.070
symmetrical squares.
You shithead.
All right,

1660
01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:56.020
and you're looking at some things that you barely tell.

1661
01:23:56.021 --> 01:23:58.750
What the fuck you're looking at.
Clearly used to faith on Martha,

1662
01:23:58.930 --> 01:24:02.470
and there's a dude who has these videos where he measures like these arbitrary

1663
01:24:02.471 --> 01:24:03.070
distances.

1664
01:24:03.070 --> 01:24:08.050
Like if you measure from the nose to the Left Front Center of that pyramid,

1665
01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:12.070
it is the exact same distance as the spanx to the pyramid of Giza.

1666
01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:16.220
And you're like,
how the fuck did you come to that?
Yes.

1667
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:20.290
If you look at it from the White House and a 44 inch television in the corner

1668
01:24:20.291 --> 01:24:23.620
where Clinton used to get his blow jobs from that room,

1669
01:24:23.621 --> 01:24:26.140
clearly the pyramid has a face on it that looks like numbers on Mars.

1670
01:24:26.170 --> 01:24:31.170
I rest my case and people fucking buy the DVD and call each other on the phone

1671
01:24:31.511 --> 01:24:34.750
and do this some shit.
You got to see there's a man who's dropping some truth,

1672
01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:38.320
some mad truth about the pyramid and the next thing you know you're getting

1673
01:24:38.321 --> 01:24:42.490
fucking email blasts.
Have you seen this about the pyramid?
Like you motherfuckers

1674
01:24:44.050 --> 01:24:47.860
not a fucking face on the Mars.
They might be,
but that's not it.

1675
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:50.380
I mean there might be some other shit.
It doesn't mean there's not some Osha.

1676
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:51.221
It matter of fact,

1677
01:24:51.221 --> 01:24:55.150
the pyramid shapes on Mars are way more interesting than the um,

1678
01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:58.690
the face because the face when they show the high resolution image of the face,

1679
01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:00.940
these are,
I've been doctored,
clearly doctored.

1680
01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:03.220
These are not high resolution photograph.

1681
01:25:03.221 --> 01:25:06.100
In fact they are less than half of the gigabytes.

1682
01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:11.101
And it would be if it was a true 85 gallon pickle fucking picture.

1683
01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:17.050
But there are some like symmetrical objects that exist that do look like five,

1684
01:25:17.051 --> 01:25:19.660
sorry pyramids like you pull up that cause that was kind of images.

1685
01:25:19.661 --> 01:25:20.660
I want to see that.
Yeah.

1686
01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:24.190
But it's also possible that those things exist naturally.

1687
01:25:24.191 --> 01:25:28.630
There's a lot of weird shapes that exist naturally.
Like there's a,
there's this,

1688
01:25:28.631 --> 01:25:32.980
um,
I forgot what it's called.
A giant something giant's causeway,

1689
01:25:32.981 --> 01:25:36.220
I think in Ireland.
Let me think if that's it.
Let me see if that's it.

1690
01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:39.820
But it's this crazy rock formation that's totally natural.

1691
01:25:41.410 --> 01:25:45.790
Ireland I our wind,
I think that's what it is.
I need to get the images here.
Yeah,

1692
01:25:45.791 --> 01:25:47.320
that's it.
Go there.

1693
01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:52.740
Go go to giants causeway in Ireland and tell me this shit doesn't look like some

1694
01:25:53.531 --> 01:25:55.990
mother fuckers were building a building,
but it's not.

1695
01:25:56.380 --> 01:26:00.130
It's not at all to some weird,
crazy natural formation.

1696
01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:04.070
If you saw this on an image of Mars,
if someone sent you this,

1697
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:08.210
clearly these are cobblestones on a I a Martian street.

1698
01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:11.660
They have cars like ours.
They're probably shaped like us.

1699
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:16.250
Go to that.
If you find it,
look at these images.
Look at the shit.
Look at that.

1700
01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:20.060
Where is this now?
This is in Ireland.
Oh,
tell me if you saw that on Mars,

1701
01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:24.800
you wouldn't start shitting your pants.
Clearly,
sophisticated civilization,

1702
01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:27.260
that's just natural shit for apps.

1703
01:26:27.261 --> 01:26:31.550
Aliens came down and real in them took their women.

1704
01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:36.500
Look at that.
I mean that Shit looks so wow.
That looks so unnatural.

1705
01:26:36.670 --> 01:26:41.210
Hundred percent it looks like someone made a cool ass cobblestone streets,

1706
01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:44.660
but it's just a natural formation when these,

1707
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:48.560
I don't know what the fuck causes a stones to be shaped in these weird patterns,

1708
01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:50.690
but look at that.
If you look at that,

1709
01:26:50.691 --> 01:26:55.310
you would swear that has to be made by somebody.
But it's not,

1710
01:26:55.670 --> 01:27:00.290
it's totally natural,
you know,
and there's varying stages of it.

1711
01:27:00.290 --> 01:27:02.900
They can actually see like how it's developed.
I don't know.

1712
01:27:02.901 --> 01:27:06.200
I'm not obviously not a,
what are they called?
What's the geologist?

1713
01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:11.150
Someone who understands rocks.
Those dudes,
they look at it and like there's a,

1714
01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:14.460
another disagreement that Graham Hancock has with some of the people.
Um,

1715
01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:17.450
Graham Hancock has his famous dude who wrote this book called fingerprints of

1716
01:27:17.451 --> 01:27:19.580
the Gods,
brilliant,
brilliant guy,

1717
01:27:19.581 --> 01:27:24.581
and he's exposed a lot of really fascinating shit about ancient civilizations.

1718
01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.800
And he's headed right now to go Beckley tap.

1719
01:27:26.820 --> 01:27:29.780
He's going to be back on the podcast in November.
He's going to go back.

1720
01:27:29.781 --> 01:27:34.540
Lee Typically live to check this out because go Beckley teply is essentially a,

1721
01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:37.850
um,
a structure that affirms all of his beliefs.

1722
01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:42.950
He believed that there was an ancient civilization that lived far earlier than

1723
01:27:42.951 --> 01:27:46.700
we're giving monitored civilization of credit for that they were capable of very

1724
01:27:46.701 --> 01:27:47.840
sophisticated things,

1725
01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:52.010
but something happened and they were most likely wiped out by like meteors or

1726
01:27:52.011 --> 01:27:56.090
something like that.
Well,
two things have happened since he wrote that book.
One,

1727
01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:59.330
the discovery,
we'll go back.
Lee tappy,
four towns,
14,000 years old,

1728
01:27:59.331 --> 01:28:01.310
it's as old as 14,000 years old.

1729
01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:06.460
Fucking massive stone pillars with animals carved in them back when they thought

1730
01:28:06.861 --> 01:28:10.410
that people were just like riding on horseback,
barely,
you know,
hunting,

1731
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:13.460
gathering.
Like that's all they did.
Meanwhile,
they're building these insane,

1732
01:28:13.490 --> 01:28:14.900
huge complicated structures.

1733
01:28:15.170 --> 01:28:18.260
And the discovery of the impact of the Clovis comment,

1734
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:23.390
they know for a fact that most likely all of the life in North America,

1735
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:28.220
like all the people that live in North America were wiped out about 12,000 plus

1736
01:28:28.221 --> 01:28:32.300
years ago.
Oh,
I didn't know that.
A huge comet hit.
It's called the Clovis comment.

1737
01:28:32.450 --> 01:28:36.440
And it was like a recent discovery about a recent article that was published

1738
01:28:36.441 --> 01:28:39.320
about it.
So they know that there's been some shit that went down.

1739
01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:40.340
So because of that,

1740
01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:45.190
Graham has this like eager searching I and occasionally even he gets fooled,

1741
01:28:45.191 --> 01:28:48.110
like he'll look at something and he'll think that this thing can't be,

1742
01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:49.910
can't be a natural formation.

1743
01:28:50.090 --> 01:28:52.640
But then you look at something like the giants because when you go,

1744
01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:57.570
it might be like,
there's this thing in Japan off of a,
the coast edge yama,

1745
01:28:57.571 --> 01:29:01.000
Gucci.
I think it's an all,
I forget,
I forget the name of the place.
Go underwater.

1746
01:29:01.130 --> 01:29:01.963
Yeah,

1747
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:05.610
<v 1>really interesting shit.
But it could,
it could be natural.</v>

1748
01:29:05.730 --> 01:29:08.670
If you look at this giant's causeway thing,
it could be natural too.

1749
01:29:08.671 --> 01:29:13.590
It could be weird.
But go to go to,
I'm Graham hancock.com and pull the images,

1750
01:29:13.591 --> 01:29:17.550
the underwater images of these structures.
So if you see these structures,

1751
01:29:17.551 --> 01:29:21.660
you can kind of see why someone could say,
man,
this is manmade.

1752
01:29:21.661 --> 01:29:24.120
This is definitely manmade.
But it doesn't necessarily have to be,

1753
01:29:24.210 --> 01:29:26.400
but that's like what's really important.

1754
01:29:26.401 --> 01:29:28.170
Whenever he was searching for information,

1755
01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:30.870
you gotta be open to all fucking possibilities.

1756
01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:35.010
You can't be married to something being real.
And where I think a lot like this,

1757
01:29:35.011 --> 01:29:38.480
they think this is,
he thinks this is like a ring of sir.
It might be.
It might,

1758
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:41.340
but it's not as,
it's not a symmetrical as giant's causeway,

1759
01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:46.260
which we know fucking for sure is artificially is a naturally created rather.

1760
01:29:46.650 --> 01:29:50.640
So it's like when you come across things like this or things like chem trails,

1761
01:29:50.641 --> 01:29:52.830
like you gotta be really sure what the fuck you're saying.

1762
01:29:53.010 --> 01:29:55.380
And a lot of times people aren't,
they're just not.

1763
01:29:55.980 --> 01:29:57.600
One of the guys we interviewed for the show,

1764
01:29:57.620 --> 01:30:00.660
so really nice guys name is Michael Murphy and he wrote these documentaries.

1765
01:30:00.690 --> 01:30:03.900
It made his document is called what are the what in the world they sprang and

1766
01:30:03.901 --> 01:30:06.420
why in the world they sprang and they realize how crazy it was stressing your

1767
01:30:06.421 --> 01:30:10.800
show.
He's going to say crazy nutty dude.
But yeah,

1768
01:30:10.850 --> 01:30:14.460
we're on the same wavelengths I do.
He's just a little high strung.

1769
01:30:14.490 --> 01:30:17.460
You're a little high strung.
So many listen to this podcast.

1770
01:30:18.190 --> 01:30:22.320
All pet fucking kettle.
That should be a warning not to drink caffeine,

1771
01:30:23.170 --> 01:30:25.280
coffee or coffee.
Is this bulletproof?
Yeah man.

1772
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:30.780
These people flying off their treadmills.
[inaudible]

1773
01:30:30.810 --> 01:30:32.960
fuck yeah,
I know you.
I don't have to,

1774
01:30:32.970 --> 01:30:35.790
I don't even have to drink caffeine for practice or anything cause he gets me

1775
01:30:35.791 --> 01:30:40.440
going.
Some of
this stuff is awesome too.

1776
01:30:40.441 --> 01:30:43.320
This bulletproof stuff.
A lot of people saying like they give you heart attacks,

1777
01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:47.470
whatever bitch,
what are you a pussy?
I drink it to heart attack.

1778
01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:49.440
I don't know if it gives you,

1779
01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:54.030
I think that cholesterol most certainly is probably bad for you if you live the

1780
01:30:54.031 --> 01:30:56.580
average American life.
But you know what's really bad for you?

1781
01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.540
The average American lives.
Zach,
that's what's bad for you.
I on the other hand,

1782
01:31:00.541 --> 01:31:03.680
I can drink this shit all day long cause I work out like a terrorist.
Right.

1783
01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:06.180
Wait a sec.
Did you hear that?
Uh,

1784
01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:11.360
Uber is a purchasing 2,500 of those driverless cars.

1785
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:16.350
And can you imagine now like just being on your phone and like pick me up and

1786
01:31:16.351 --> 01:31:19.870
it's like,
you know,
car with no person in it picks you up that's coming,

1787
01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:23.610
that's coming for sure.
Those called taxis.
Well,
you know,
my car,

1788
01:31:23.611 --> 01:31:28.260
I got an infinity and it recognizes the distance between the car in front of me

1789
01:31:28.261 --> 01:31:31.620
and slows down.
And then when the car goes further,
it speeds up.

1790
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:33.870
Like say if you set your,
your set your speed limit,

1791
01:31:33.871 --> 01:31:37.320
you set it to 65 and the cruise control and it knows where you're going.
Wow.

1792
01:31:37.470 --> 01:31:38.430
It slows you down.

1793
01:31:38.490 --> 01:31:41.400
Like you could just let your foot off the pedal and just chill.
And it like,

1794
01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:43.170
you know,
you have to have your foot ready to break.

1795
01:31:43.470 --> 01:31:46.890
Some deer runs across actually not supposed to break.
Right.

1796
01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:51.210
But here goes in front of you just [inaudible].
Sure.
That sucks man.

1797
01:31:51.211 --> 01:31:53.400
It's hard to do for each.
Have a nice car.

1798
01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:56.280
Free dear me fucking deer's going right through your windshield.

1799
01:31:56.340 --> 01:32:00.120
Especially if a Miata or some shit.
You an elk.
I

1800
01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:03.790
<v 0>might want it to break.
Yeah,
I mean Yada stopped pretty quick.
Yeah.</v>

1801
01:32:04.180 --> 01:32:06.760
You don't want to hit a fucking eloquently when our surroundings for sure.

1802
01:32:06.850 --> 01:32:11.050
There was a,
um,
a show that I watched called pig man.
You ever watch that show?

1803
01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:14.290
This motherfucker.
First of all,
the reason why I brought this up,

1804
01:32:14.291 --> 01:32:18.400
did they have these trucks with these giant grills in the front of them because

1805
01:32:18.401 --> 01:32:22.900
there's so many wild deer and wild pigs in Texas that they just run into those

1806
01:32:22.901 --> 01:32:25.990
bitches on the highway all the time and they will fuck your car up.

1807
01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:30.970
So dudes have special bumpers on their car just designed to smash into it.

1808
01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:33.670
It's like some Mad Max shit.
Like see,

1809
01:32:33.671 --> 01:32:38.080
you have this gigantic pickup truck would just fucking battle battering ram that

1810
01:32:38.081 --> 01:32:41.680
has it.
Literally like cuts like a v straight towards the F.

1811
01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:45.790
I mean these are crazy fucking bumper.
The show they were,

1812
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:51.390
it's called a pork lips 2013 pull the video up cause I put it on Twitter.

1813
01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:54.190
This is the nuttiest fucking Shit I've ever seen in my life.

1814
01:32:54.430 --> 01:32:57.180
Nadeer then this is a Buddhist,

1815
01:32:57.181 --> 01:33:01.210
a area of Japan where they feel that deer sacred and is a video that I tweeted

1816
01:33:01.211 --> 01:33:04.700
about all these deer everywhere.
This is not the important trips in it.

1817
01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:06.910
Really cute.
They're delicious.
I'll shoot those fuckers.

1818
01:33:08.110 --> 01:33:09.760
I would shoot him right there.
Everybody went to sleep.

1819
01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:13.240
Pull out a bow and Arrow shooting.
I'm opening the UFC,

1820
01:33:13.241 --> 01:33:16.300
goes back to Japan and when these guys found in the car and I'm Mr Pan going on

1821
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:18.610
with another one of those trips where I could actually eat food and relax and

1822
01:33:18.611 --> 01:33:21.550
not stress about my own fight.
Yeah,
that'd be good.
Pull that.

1823
01:33:21.551 --> 01:33:24.880
Pull that on the video up.
Cause it's,
it's a crazy thing to look at.
Okay.

1824
01:33:25.650 --> 01:33:28.330
The heat,
they're shooting pigs from helicopter.
Okay.
Oh,

1825
01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:32.500
I see a new one though.
This is a two parter.

1826
01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:36.460
They did it last year and uh,
it was uh,
let there be pork I think.

1827
01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:41.050
But this is a pork lips 2013 and there's,
it's a two parter.

1828
01:33:41.230 --> 01:33:43.870
And when one of them,
he shooting bows and arrows,

1829
01:33:44.110 --> 01:33:48.550
he shooting bows and arrows out of a fucking helicopter and pigs,
yes.
Way.

1830
01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:51.910
And killing him.
He said it's the only time it's ever been done.
Yeah,
for sure.

1831
01:33:51.911 --> 01:33:53.980
It killed three pigs with a bone.

1832
01:33:53.981 --> 01:33:56.560
Now listen to this because this is fucking crazy.

1833
01:33:56.561 --> 01:33:58.090
It's hard enough to shoot a bow and Arrow made ground.

1834
01:33:58.091 --> 01:34:01.600
This is the craziest thing the sportsman channel has ever done coast to coast

1835
01:34:02.910 --> 01:34:07.390
across the hardware.
They're sending it up like saint these pigs are dangerous,

1836
01:34:07.870 --> 01:34:11.260
which is true.
But look at this

1837
01:34:14.370 --> 01:34:18.640
pig man and Ted Nugent.
This might be one of the greatest,

1838
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:21.430
I mean look,
I'm not,
I'm not a fucking heartless person,

1839
01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:26.320
but there is a reality that they have a real problem with these wild pigs and

1840
01:34:26.321 --> 01:34:28.990
there is a problem with feeding hungry people as well.

1841
01:34:29.210 --> 01:34:33.580
They absolutely donate all of that meat to hunters for the handling of that.

1842
01:34:33.790 --> 01:34:34.250
That yeah,

1843
01:34:34.250 --> 01:34:37.270
I shouldn't have fucking bow and Arrow with a pig from a helicopter hunters for

1844
01:34:37.271 --> 01:34:39.310
the hungry.
They uh,
they donate all this meat.

1845
01:34:39.311 --> 01:34:42.160
So this meat goes to needy families.
It's really good wild game.

1846
01:34:42.250 --> 01:34:43.600
It's very healthy for you.

1847
01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:47.020
And these people are very fortunate to be able to get free meals like this.
Yup.

1848
01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:51.030
Yeah.
That's sad.
They're not hunting.
Okay.
There are rattling.

1849
01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:52.210
Just shot it with a bow and arrow.

1850
01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:57.560
They're eradicating what they consider to be problem animals and say,
well,

1851
01:34:57.561 --> 01:35:01.220
humans are fucking problem animals like this or this one animal rights activist.

1852
01:35:01.221 --> 01:35:04.460
When fuck had bananas when I posted this video.
It was really interesting.

1853
01:35:04.461 --> 01:35:05.960
I watch this,
read his timeline.

1854
01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:11.440
He was calling for a Ted Nugent to a fight him at a bar fight to you was calling

1855
01:35:12.261 --> 01:35:15.410
him to either kill himself or die like over and over again,

1856
01:35:15.411 --> 01:35:19.040
calling from to die or you years to meet me.
You want to kill a person.

1857
01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:23.720
But meanwhile you like this,
this animal killing bothers you.

1858
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:25.810
So you want to commit violence and the person you,

1859
01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:28.760
you're protecting the animals by also acting violently.

1860
01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:29.101
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1861
01:35:29.101 --> 01:35:32.910
Did I got so much crap on Twitter for when I went bear hunting and got a giant

1862
01:35:32.911 --> 01:35:37.710
bear
grizzly?
Uh,
no brown black bear.

1863
01:35:37.770 --> 01:35:41.890
So de jete it.
Uh,
so we donated all the meat to the local Indians.
I hunted on a,

1864
01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:45.090
the crow Indian reservation in Montana and the bear that I killed,

1865
01:35:45.091 --> 01:35:47.580
I don't it to the local Indians there.
Cause I mean,

1866
01:35:47.581 --> 01:35:49.770
you mean you should see this Indian reservation,
how they're living,
you know,

1867
01:35:49.771 --> 01:35:51.060
it's,
it's pretty bad.

1868
01:35:51.061 --> 01:35:55.800
And a giant bear and posted it on Twitter and people were eating me up over it.

1869
01:35:55.801 --> 01:35:58.620
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
They don't realize that by me doing that,

1870
01:35:58.621 --> 01:36:02.580
I'm actually helping out the population of other animals in the bear at that

1871
01:36:02.581 --> 01:36:05.490
time.
The bears,
they'll kill their own cubs so that they can meet again.

1872
01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:06.270
You know what I mean?

1873
01:36:06.270 --> 01:36:10.140
<v 0>Yes.
Yeah.
Well,
if they're in a bad situation where there's low resources,</v>

1874
01:36:10.410 --> 01:36:10.861
you know,

1875
01:36:10.861 --> 01:36:15.240
people don't like the idea that the resources have to be maintained and that if

1876
01:36:15.241 --> 01:36:17.400
you really study it and it's so hard to do,

1877
01:36:17.550 --> 01:36:22.530
but try to talk to someone who really understands game conservation and try to

1878
01:36:22.531 --> 01:36:26.670
study it from an objective perspective because there is a certain amount of

1879
01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:29.940
predators that can exist in an environment and there's a certain amount of prey

1880
01:36:29.941 --> 01:36:33.870
that can exist in an environment and they know what that number is and they know

1881
01:36:33.871 --> 01:36:36.030
how to manage that and they're very diligent about it.

1882
01:36:36.031 --> 01:36:38.040
They changed the limits all the time.

1883
01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:40.740
Like they do it with the salmon population in Alaska.

1884
01:36:40.741 --> 01:36:43.080
They monitor it very closely with salmon weirs.

1885
01:36:43.230 --> 01:36:44.880
They make sure that the populations are healthy.

1886
01:36:44.881 --> 01:36:47.940
Then you're good numbers running through.
So you know,
people can or can't fish.

1887
01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:50.550
They open seasons,
close seasons on a whim.
If they go,
look,

1888
01:36:50.551 --> 01:36:53.490
you was on a fish coming through this,
we're boom,
they shut the season down.

1889
01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:56.580
And that's,
that's called responsible management.

1890
01:36:56.820 --> 01:36:59.430
If you don't have responsible management for wildlife,

1891
01:36:59.431 --> 01:37:00.660
especially when it comes to deer,

1892
01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:02.790
you get overpopulation and you get fucking disease.

1893
01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:05.940
They get a lot of wasting disease.
You get Lyme disease,

1894
01:37:05.941 --> 01:37:07.860
which spreads throughout the east coast.

1895
01:37:07.861 --> 01:37:12.861
There's people that are fucked up from Lyme disease and Lyme disease comes from

1896
01:37:12.961 --> 01:37:17.070
deer ticks.
And people have to understand like there's more,

1897
01:37:17.071 --> 01:37:21.030
and I read this recently,
no,
Ted Nugent told me this recently,
not me.

1898
01:37:21.031 --> 01:37:24.090
I mean he doesn't like me,
but if you can talk,
probably thinks I'm a liberal.

1899
01:37:24.750 --> 01:37:27.750
But if even if you talked,
you know,
he a on his show,

1900
01:37:27.751 --> 01:37:32.751
he was talking about how there is more wildlife as far as deer and as far as

1901
01:37:33.541 --> 01:37:37.830
coyotes and as far as like whatever wild game and this country now than when

1902
01:37:37.831 --> 01:37:42.000
Christopher Columbus came here.
Oh whoa.
How fucking crazy.
First of all,

1903
01:37:42.001 --> 01:37:45.780
how the fuck do you know
to count back then?
But second of all,

1904
01:37:45.781 --> 01:37:49.020
if he's right and the idea is that with less,
um,

1905
01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:51.570
less forest than they used to be back then,

1906
01:37:51.630 --> 01:37:55.470
like before it was like fucking forest everywhere.
The deforestation is created,

1907
01:37:55.480 --> 01:38:00.000
larger areas like agriculture has created much more opportunity for dirty.

1908
01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:02.190
So there's more deer now than ever before.

1909
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:05.610
They're more successful because there's less like mountain lions around shit

1910
01:38:05.611 --> 01:38:07.650
because there's people around,
they hear the cars and shit,

1911
01:38:07.950 --> 01:38:11.070
they're not loose like running to the,
yeah.
So they like,

1912
01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:13.980
they're getting to breed more and you got to manage that population because if

1913
01:38:13.981 --> 01:38:18.060
you don't,
you have deaths on the road.
Not just the deer,
but people.
I mean,

1914
01:38:18.061 --> 01:38:21.000
if you've ever googled dear through windshield,
you know,

1915
01:38:21.001 --> 01:38:23.370
you want to see some horrific fucking scenes of destruction.

1916
01:38:23.371 --> 01:38:27.120
People die every year because deer go through their windshield and a lot of

1917
01:38:27.121 --> 01:38:27.811
folks don't know that,

1918
01:38:27.811 --> 01:38:32.811
but a deer is a fucking hundred and 80 pound hunk of bones and steak and you hit

1919
01:38:33.211 --> 01:38:36.300
it with your car and you're a fucked man.
You know,
stop trying to be cute.

1920
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:41.370
I'll show you some cows to bitch eat cheeseburgers like a motherfucker had.

1921
01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:44.130
People don't realize either the money you pay for those tags to go kill that

1922
01:38:44.131 --> 01:38:47.490
animal to your donating that money to the wildlife federation.
You know,

1923
01:38:47.790 --> 01:38:50.940
like I just spent over 400 bucks on a deer tag in the route for the Ruby

1924
01:38:50.941 --> 01:38:52.230
mountains.
In fact,

1925
01:38:52.490 --> 01:38:57.150
punters donate more money for conservation and have more impact on conservation

1926
01:38:57.151 --> 01:39:01.890
because of the amount of money they spend on tax then any pro animal rights

1927
01:39:01.891 --> 01:39:02.591
group.
Absolutely.

1928
01:39:02.591 --> 01:39:06.000
Then Annie and the amount of money that you get from tags and from management,

1929
01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:10.440
you can't just leave them alone like people be like,
let go,

1930
01:39:10.441 --> 01:39:14.920
let them go low.
You have to understand that you're a fucking animal too,
right?

1931
01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:18.720
There's a delicate game that's going on between us and all the other and yes,

1932
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:23.460
as the highest intellectual animal with thumbs on the planet earth,

1933
01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:24.780
not in the ocean.
You know,

1934
01:39:24.810 --> 01:39:26.940
it's debatable whether or not we're smarter than dolphins.

1935
01:39:26.970 --> 01:39:28.950
If we can't understand the language and they can understand us,

1936
01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:31.370
I think it's debatable,
but as the smartest the most,

1937
01:39:31.470 --> 01:39:35.820
and the one who's looking like,
what's the best case scenario for mankind?
Well,

1938
01:39:35.821 --> 01:39:38.130
no more war.
Love your brother.
Everybody gets along.

1939
01:39:38.131 --> 01:39:40.740
We have the perfect civilization in a hundred years and we all get our shit

1940
01:39:40.741 --> 01:39:41.250
together.

1941
01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:45.510
We all agree that you can't show cruelty to animals and make that happen.

1942
01:39:45.630 --> 01:39:49.680
You can't be stopping people's cats shooting people's dogs.

1943
01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:54.900
And so we associate our dogs and our pets who we love very much our cats and

1944
01:39:54.901 --> 01:39:59.580
what have you.
We associate that with wild animals,
but that's some baby shit,

1945
01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:03.480
okay?
Because wild animals will fucking eat your ass hole.

1946
01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:07.770
If you go out there and you go wandering around and you fall down,

1947
01:40:07.771 --> 01:40:11.460
you sprain your ankle and a fucking bunch of wolves find you.
Guess what?

1948
01:40:11.461 --> 01:40:13.170
Fuck face.
That's a wrap.

1949
01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:17.130
And the only thing that keeps those wolves from doing that is they know we have

1950
01:40:17.131 --> 01:40:21.210
the bank sticks and the cars and all this shit that they're scared of misplaced.

1951
01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:25.140
Stay the fuck away.
That's it.
It's not.
The wolves aren't beautiful man.

1952
01:40:25.141 --> 01:40:30.060
I fucking love wolves.
I think they're majestic.
I watched documentaries on boils.

1953
01:40:30.061 --> 01:40:32.730
I bet.
I've watched a hundred documentaries on walls.

1954
01:40:32.731 --> 01:40:35.280
I watched the documentary about the dude who live with the wolves and it's

1955
01:40:35.281 --> 01:40:36.900
gigantic wildlife containment,

1956
01:40:36.901 --> 01:40:40.440
and he would actually stuff a liver into the carcass so that he could prove that

1957
01:40:40.441 --> 01:40:44.070
he was the Alpha deliver first and it was loud.
All the other boys,
I guess.

1958
01:40:44.071 --> 01:40:47.010
Crazy fascinating.

1959
01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.770
I think they're amazing and I'm so glad they're alive,

1960
01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:54.010
but if one of them is following me,
I'll shoot it right in the deck.
Oh yeah.
In a

1961
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:57.400
<v 1>heartbeat.
If I had gone in a wolf was following me,
I'd be like,</v>

1962
01:40:57.401 --> 01:41:00.970
are you fucking crazy?
I have kids.
You fucking punk.

1963
01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:04.390
Most of the information I know that you're talking about is actually coming from

1964
01:41:04.391 --> 01:41:07.820
the podcast.
Might fuck it.
Up.
Dot,
dot,
dot,
dot,
dot.

1965
01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:10.510
It doesn't mean I don't love wolves.
I do love walls,

1966
01:41:10.511 --> 01:41:13.390
but if I thought a wolf is going to eat me,
I would fucking kill it.

1967
01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:16.540
Like you have to do that and people have to understand that.

1968
01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:21.190
That used to be a really common occurrence.
People Killed Wolves all the time.

1969
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:25.090
Between 15 something of 250 year period in Paris,

1970
01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:29.710
wolves killed 3000 people in France.
Wow.

1971
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:34.930
Wrap your fucking dude.
That's a lot of fucking people.

1972
01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:38.260
They're smart.
Sneaky things that eat meat.
Okay.

1973
01:41:38.290 --> 01:41:42.010
What are we stupid lazy fucks that get drunk and were made out of meat.

1974
01:41:42.500 --> 01:41:46.810
All right.
It's pretty fucking simple,
but everybody wants to look at them.

1975
01:41:46.811 --> 01:41:50.050
It's like beautiful and that's when they said,
you know,
if he amazing.
Yes.

1976
01:41:50.051 --> 01:41:54.310
Amazing.
Yes.
Also they have to be managed.
If I had a,
if I had a home I own me,

1977
01:41:54.311 --> 01:41:58.110
I probably wouldn't have to kind of harder to say that you have wireless.

1978
01:41:58.140 --> 01:41:58.973
I got to the point.
Yeah.

1979
01:41:59.690 --> 01:42:04.240
The kids were starving and it was wintertime and you gotta fuck.
Yeah,
you would.

1980
01:42:04.241 --> 01:42:08.370
I know you are.
You kidding me?
You just kind.

1981
01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:10.420
If you don't have to be mean to the point.
Yeah.
Then yeah,

1982
01:42:10.421 --> 01:42:13.800
things have changed for sure.
I wouldn't do it right now for fine.

1983
01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:18.500
She never do it for fun and that's why it's fucked up to watch this pig man

1984
01:42:18.501 --> 01:42:22.480
thing because on one hand I agree that they have to do what they're doing.

1985
01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:25.630
Like those,
those pigs cause devastation to wildlife.

1986
01:42:25.631 --> 01:42:29.410
They caused aro accidents left and right.
They want across the roads,

1987
01:42:29.530 --> 01:42:30.360
they're fucking,

1988
01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:35.080
they've fucking devastate farms and cost people who have these lands,
this land,

1989
01:42:35.081 --> 01:42:38.800
their family banks on it costs them a lot of fucking money.
That is reality.

1990
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:40.900
And then there's also reacted.
They're alive for them,

1991
01:42:41.110 --> 01:42:44.080
their life or maybe maybe they shouldn't be shot in the head with machine guns

1992
01:42:44.081 --> 01:42:47.110
from a helicopter terrorizing it.
Also making money off it,

1993
01:42:47.111 --> 01:42:50.350
but like making it seem cool to kill animals and stuff.
You're right,

1994
01:42:50.410 --> 01:42:53.330
you're right.
But then again,
the food goes to the,

1995
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:57.520
they have to be killed because they do the our problem.
There's so many,

1996
01:42:57.610 --> 01:43:00.140
I don't know if it's true,
but I read this so let's just repeat it.

1997
01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:05.760
There's almost as many pigs in taxes as there are people wrap your fucking head

1998
01:43:06.041 --> 01:43:08.650
around that.
There's almost as many,
let's just Google that.

1999
01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:12.820
Texas is a big ass place too.
There's a lot of pigs there

2000
01:43:15.150 --> 01:43:18.790
and we're not talking about women dare you.
How dare you shame those women.

2001
01:43:18.791 --> 01:43:22.260
You're fat shaming,
shaming assholes.

2002
01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:27.730
Very nice.
Fat Shamer I bet you slept shame to you.

2003
01:43:27.731 --> 01:43:30.730
Asshole.
Slut shaming.
Fat Shame.

2004
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:32.830
I'm numbering in the millions.

2005
01:43:32.831 --> 01:43:37.831
These shockingly destructive and invasive wild hogs wreck havoc across the

2006
01:43:37.931 --> 01:43:38.920
southern United States.

2007
01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:44.100
Well there's so fucking like strong and tough wild pigs that what happens is

2008
01:43:45.881 --> 01:43:48.850
domestic pigs get out and it's a weird thing,

2009
01:43:48.851 --> 01:43:52.080
but within three weeks of being out in the wild,
fending from their self,

2010
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:53.630
<v 0>their body actually starts changing.</v>

2011
01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:58.130
The hair grows coarser than extends the tusks grow.
It's nuts,
man.

2012
01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:01.670
Quick evolution.
And they are not shy about fucking,

2013
01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:06.210
they fuck up warm.
And then they just had,
they start dominating.

2014
01:44:06.230 --> 01:44:10.400
They just start taking over land and they don't have very many natural
predators.

2015
01:44:10.730 --> 01:44:11.960
So there's,

2016
01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:16.380
there's apparently they do 400 million in damages annually.
Well

2017
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:22.730
God damn,
that's a lot.
That's good.
They also,

2018
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:27.620
they also cause fish kills because they fuck with ponds.

2019
01:44:27.621 --> 01:44:30.290
So monthly stomp around in them that they get the ponds.

2020
01:44:30.291 --> 01:44:34.970
So muddy from running around in them that they,
uh,
they,
they choke off the fish.

2021
01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:37.670
They're nuts,
man.

2022
01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:41.480
Dad raised pigs growing up to sell for four h for auction and a dude,

2023
01:44:41.481 --> 01:44:42.530
they're a pain to deal with.
I mean,

2024
01:44:42.531 --> 01:44:45.200
they mess up everything to tear down your fences.
They,
you know,

2025
01:44:45.201 --> 01:44:49.070
they cause more problems than,
than they are to take care of for sure.
Okay.

2026
01:44:49.071 --> 01:44:52.570
There's,
this might not be right.
Um,
what I said might not be right about it,

2027
01:44:52.571 --> 01:44:55.860
the numbers of people because apparently,
but the number of this are,

2028
01:44:55.861 --> 01:45:00.861
the other article which is on NBC says that they cause one point $5 billion in

2029
01:45:00.951 --> 01:45:03.740
damages nationwide each year,
which is,
you know,

2030
01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:08.030
the other ones just Texas and there's currently more than 5 million wild hogs,

2031
01:45:08.060 --> 01:45:08.721
the United States.

2032
01:45:08.721 --> 01:45:13.721
And within a few years they're saying that the number of feral hogs is going to

2033
01:45:14.091 --> 01:45:16.250
triple five years in Texas,

2034
01:45:16.251 --> 01:45:20.630
triple fucking triple the Nydia hunting.

2035
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:24.260
So they ha,
they literally almost have to do this with a,

2036
01:45:24.270 --> 01:45:25.370
shooting them out of helicopters.

2037
01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:30.320
They carry crazy amounts of diseases and unless you want to just start fucking

2038
01:45:30.321 --> 01:45:34.010
reintroducing wolves to Texas,
you gotta take care of these mother fuckers.
You,

2039
01:45:34.030 --> 01:45:37.160
there's something's got to eat them.
You can't just have these things.

2040
01:45:37.220 --> 01:45:38.120
You have an imbalance.

2041
01:45:38.150 --> 01:45:41.210
The reason why these millions of wild hogs running through these fields is

2042
01:45:41.211 --> 01:45:43.160
because there's nothing killing them.
They're not supposed to be there.

2043
01:45:43.161 --> 01:45:44.780
Like if there's a problem.

2044
01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:49.960
And so you have to figure out a really extreme method of solving his problem,

2045
01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:51.550
then there's no more extreme method.

2046
01:45:51.551 --> 01:45:56.551
Did Ted Nugent and the pig man in a fucking helicopter with machine guns and yes

2047
01:45:57.291 --> 01:46:00.890
and no.
Yes.
It's cruel.
Yes.
It's horrible.
Yes.
I'm an animal lover.
Yes.

2048
01:46:00.891 --> 01:46:05.180
I have two cats and two dogs,
but I fucking saved this shit on my DVR.

2049
01:46:05.610 --> 01:46:07.430
I'm going to watch it again.
I need to watch.

2050
01:46:07.431 --> 01:46:10.130
I can't live this shooter with a bow.
That's insanity.
Well,

2051
01:46:10.131 --> 01:46:11.770
he misses the first shot because there's a,

2052
01:46:11.780 --> 01:46:15.140
he asked to actually a factor for the wind coming in with a helicopter.

2053
01:46:15.210 --> 01:46:19.010
Imagine pushing the Arrow down so it's shot like low.

2054
01:46:19.130 --> 01:46:22.410
So yes to like sort of lead it fucking fascinating.

2055
01:46:22.410 --> 01:46:24.590
And you don't have sites for that.
That's a judgment,
you know what I mean?

2056
01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:28.160
Meanwhile he misses the first shot.
Second shot,
hot shot,

2057
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:30.750
hot shot may just in scale is thing.

2058
01:46:30.830 --> 01:46:33.950
Oh he's been fucking super deadly accurate in the yeah.
Yeah.
And again,

2059
01:46:34.190 --> 01:46:36.730
horrible and sad that these poor animals have to die.
But there,

2060
01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:39.560
there is an imbalance.
And as the stewards of the land,

2061
01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:43.850
I think either there's a good argument that humans are supposed to maintain that

2062
01:46:43.851 --> 01:46:46.550
shit.
You know what,
get more rip better ratings though.

2063
01:46:46.610 --> 01:46:50.040
If they just had like a big one of the big guys shots and they just put

2064
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:53.220
<v 1>pigs and tried to see how far they could flip them.</v>

2065
01:46:53.670 --> 01:46:55.230
Well it's hard to catch the pigs.

2066
01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:00.060
They do a catch the pigs and knife them on.

2067
01:47:00.061 --> 01:47:02.580
Some of the episodes they catch the pigs with dogs,

2068
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:04.470
they have to substance separate types of dogs.

2069
01:47:04.471 --> 01:47:09.390
One dog finds the pigs and bathe them and then the pit bulls come in and then

2070
01:47:09.391 --> 01:47:12.270
the pit bulls have like leather vests on so the hog can't rip them apart.

2071
01:47:12.271 --> 01:47:15.060
And they just lock on him and hang on and then they come and kill him with a

2072
01:47:15.061 --> 01:47:19.020
knife.
Oh Wow.
That's a process.
It's fucking gang teamwork.
Yeah.

2073
01:47:19.021 --> 01:47:22.320
And it's crazy to watch because it is as primal as it get.

2074
01:47:22.530 --> 01:47:25.770
And I think the only reason why people aren't watching it is because it's on the

2075
01:47:25.771 --> 01:47:29.880
sportsmans channel.
I mean,
who goes to Chels six oh five on direct TV.

2076
01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:33.570
You gotta be looking for some weird porn.
Did that high up on,
you know,

2077
01:47:34.050 --> 01:47:37.110
that's like right after it was like porn in Spanish.

2078
01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:42.120
It's like those are those weird channels.
Like how'd you get over there?
You know?

2079
01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:45.320
Except like fuel fuel's in that range,
right?
Yeah.

2080
01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:46.890
There's a lot of great advice for hundreds of years.

2081
01:47:47.130 --> 01:47:51.170
That's like the fucking UFC network,
man.
I didn't even know that they had new a,

2082
01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:55.950
that's the network.
The Fox one.
Fox sports one.
Oh,
it's incredible.

2083
01:47:56.090 --> 01:47:59.880
The ratings for Spock's Fox sports one were off the charts for the first UFC

2084
01:47:59.881 --> 01:48:02.820
card.
That's why they put together that insane card.

2085
01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:07.770
I mean that car that was a good car.
Nasty jail son and versus Shogun.

2086
01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:12.420
Crazy.
Before that Alastair versus Travis Brown.

2087
01:48:12.421 --> 01:48:16.440
I mean there was Matt Brown versus,
Oh yeah,
Jesus Christ.

2088
01:48:16.530 --> 01:48:20.030
There's so many good fights.
My pile.
Yeah,
quicksand.

2089
01:48:20.190 --> 01:48:21.660
There's so many good fights on that card.

2090
01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:23.490
It was like one good fight after another good fight.

2091
01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:26.850
It was like a paper view where the cars,
yes,
for sure.
I mean,
you know,

2092
01:48:26.851 --> 01:48:30.720
a lot of people were upset about the son who AFI both are a little bit past her

2093
01:48:30.721 --> 01:48:32.490
prime.
She has lost a couple of fights in a row,

2094
01:48:32.491 --> 01:48:36.330
but what a fucking great fight it turned out to be.
You know,
and you know,

2095
01:48:36.331 --> 01:48:39.690
you've got to see the child can still finish guys.
People sleep on that Shit,
man.

2096
01:48:40.230 --> 01:48:43.170
That guy is a beast.
It's a whole your neck man.
He's going to,

2097
01:48:43.230 --> 01:48:46.740
he knows how to finish guys too,
just because he hasn't done a lot of guys.

2098
01:48:46.890 --> 01:48:50.250
If you watch the way he closed off,
Brian Stann dad is not a dude.

2099
01:48:50.251 --> 01:48:51.720
He's just doing that for the first time.

2100
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:53.880
That's a dude who's really good at finishing people.

2101
01:48:53.881 --> 01:48:57.750
He just hasn't been doing it.
Yeah,
that's the thing.
Tough dudes,
man.
Absolutely.

2102
01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:00.960
Absolutely.
Really tough guys.
He's been fighting the top of the food chain guys.

2103
01:49:00.961 --> 01:49:03.180
It's like,
well we went back to,
when we're talking about mighty mouse,

2104
01:49:03.390 --> 01:49:06.930
like people say mighty mouse is boring,
bitch you crazy.
He's exciting as hell.

2105
01:49:06.931 --> 01:49:09.000
He's like one of the most exciting guys ever.
It's just,

2106
01:49:09.001 --> 01:49:12.480
he's fighting guys who are almost a mirror image of him when he's fighting

2107
01:49:12.550 --> 01:49:17.340
Benevidez and when he's fighting,
uh,
Ian Mccall,
those guys are so fucking good.

2108
01:49:17.341 --> 01:49:19.470
You know,
you're just in the mix with this,
you know,

2109
01:49:19.471 --> 01:49:23.850
the techniques are like jai shot in each other off and pulled.
Got Yeah,
exactly.

2110
01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:26.760
I can't wait until benefited us and no mighty mouse.
Right.
Again,

2111
01:49:26.761 --> 01:49:27.594
that's going to be good.

2112
01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:31.770
This with September 4th cause for Miga in Brazil and then hopefully get the

2113
01:49:31.771 --> 01:49:35.130
title shot after that.
How old is he now?
88.

2114
01:49:35.810 --> 01:49:39.600
Do you think that um,
it used to be that,
uh,
the lighter weights,

2115
01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:42.510
like where they were much better when they were in the youngest?
Yeah,

2116
01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:45.690
the youngest age.
Like how old are you?
I'm 27.
Yeah.

2117
01:49:45.691 --> 01:49:47.980
Like that's like a perfect time to be developing

2118
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:52.980
<v 0>between like 22 and he's like 29 30 but like with a heavyweight guys are sort of</v>

2119
01:49:53.441 --> 01:49:57.700
coming into their prime when they're hitting like 30 and 31 like it seems like

2120
01:49:57.701 --> 01:50:01.910
the larger men learn how to move their body better later in life.
Okay.

2121
01:50:01.990 --> 01:50:03.580
Whereas like younger guys,

2122
01:50:03.610 --> 01:50:07.270
they seem to like hit the threshold of where they kind of peak and fade off

2123
01:50:07.630 --> 01:50:10.570
earlier.
Do you feel that that's accurate?
I'm not even lighter.

2124
01:50:10.571 --> 01:50:12.750
Guys have to start watch this.

2125
01:50:12.810 --> 01:50:14.980
I feel like I've gotten stronger now that I've gotten older.
You know,

2126
01:50:14.981 --> 01:50:17.340
I feel like I've got a little more man to man muscle and stuff,
you know?

2127
01:50:17.610 --> 01:50:20.530
I feel like I've gotten stronger that way.
You just got,
Brian's got a hard on

2128
01:50:23.220 --> 01:50:25.210
<v 3>more boner pills.
What age?</v>

2129
01:50:26.010 --> 01:50:29.580
<v 0>What is the most successful older,
lightest weight fighter?
Because you know,</v>

2130
01:50:29.581 --> 01:50:31.890
obviously have Randy,
who's the most successful,

2131
01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:36.540
the oldest like high level fighter was Randy because Randy was like world title

2132
01:50:36.541 --> 01:50:40.800
fights at 46 he was fighting Machida at 48 you know,

2133
01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:43.950
finding very high level.
Shoot your eyes,
fill him pretty good.
And he's what?

2134
01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:48.180
34 34 35 yeah,
so he's probably the oldest of the,

2135
01:50:48.181 --> 01:50:51.050
the high level and I'm lighter weight guys.
Yeah,

2136
01:50:51.370 --> 01:50:54.350
and hasn't lost a step is it's getting better.

2137
01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:57.300
The whole team is just kicking ass,
man.
It's fucking,

2138
01:50:57.330 --> 01:50:58.640
it's fun as hell for me to be there,
man.

2139
01:50:58.650 --> 01:51:01.530
Do you have an alternative name if Alpha males,
the whole team,
if what?

2140
01:51:01.531 --> 01:51:03.060
If it becomes to bank zillions.

2141
01:51:05.290 --> 01:51:09.230
<v 3>I got that from actual UFC mags and I didn't create that.
I like it.</v>

2142
01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:11.690
<v 0>That's,
I like that.
We go with that bank zillions.
Yep.</v>

2143
01:51:11.691 --> 01:51:13.710
You're going to need some sort of a Brazilian element.

2144
01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:15.390
You got to bring in zone yet

2145
01:51:15.530 --> 01:51:19.890
<v 3>Ben Zillions and Zillions zillion.
Do you guys,</v>

2146
01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:24.280
you train with zero there now at the professor Fabio brought,

2147
01:51:24.850 --> 01:51:28.270
we're an American bank.
American Bank.
Some banks.

2148
01:51:34.090 --> 01:51:36.790
Can you get the bank going to be secondary?
It can be a team effort.

2149
01:51:36.791 --> 01:51:40.540
It can be bang,
Bang.
I see.
I understand.

2150
01:51:41.110 --> 01:51:42.380
Tweeting that I've just had a great bang.

2151
01:51:43.190 --> 01:51:48.190
Their tweets or [inaudible] that doesn't help the do Schellman [inaudible] does

2152
01:51:50.841 --> 01:51:53.760
that for sure.
Everybody wants to bang,
but if you just say,
yeah,

2153
01:51:53.761 --> 01:51:56.980
I'm going to go bang.
My girlfriend was like huge fuck.
Strange,
huge.

2154
01:51:57.130 --> 01:51:59.820
It's like there's a fine line between what everybody,
right.

2155
01:51:59.870 --> 01:52:03.320
<v 0>Once in what everybody talks about and you gotta be real careful about that</v>

2156
01:52:03.321 --> 01:52:05.040
because everybody wants to fuck.
But if you talk about fucking,

2157
01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:11.510
<v 3>she's scared to admit it.
Ridicule,
Bang with girlfriend twice,
Bro.</v>

2158
01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:16.460
Man,
put that on Twitter,

2159
01:52:16.461 --> 01:52:18.440
man.
You're putting it on Twitter and you just going to get

2160
01:52:21.310 --> 01:52:22.143
cool

2161
01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:25.050
<v 0>as if that's not what everybody wants.
You know,
I don't mind it.</v>

2162
01:52:25.051 --> 01:52:27.000
I got three kids now.
Hold one on the way though.

2163
01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:29.640
It's like one of those things where it's like if you were really rich and you

2164
01:52:29.641 --> 01:52:33.060
start bragging about it,
people like there's a lot of people are poor.

2165
01:52:33.180 --> 01:52:38.180
So if you're like captain fucks a lot and hustling and Dick like a Ninja,

2166
01:52:38.620 --> 01:52:39.570
uh,
you know,

2167
01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:43.310
having sex with Jessica Biel and putting pictures of her ass on Twitter,
right?

2168
01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:46.010
<v 3>Tall.
It bothers</v>

2169
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:48.440
<v 0>people.
Like there's a photo,
like,
let's be honest,</v>

2170
01:52:48.590 --> 01:52:52.680
there's a photo of Jenny McCarthy with a Donny Walberg and we saw it on,

2171
01:52:52.900 --> 01:52:55.850
see it,
whatever the fuck it was.
CNN breaking news.

2172
01:52:55.851 --> 01:52:58.550
Donnie Wahlberg put his penis inside of Jenny McCarthy.

2173
01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:02.240
I wonder if they got vaccinated before they did it.
But you look at the picture,

2174
01:53:02.241 --> 01:53:05.770
we like look at,
Oh,
he gets bang her.
Oh Shit.
What are your thoughts?

2175
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:12.440
Vaccines.
My kids are in the backseat.
I think some vaccines are very important.

2176
01:53:12.650 --> 01:53:15.850
I think there's a lot of vaccines for sure.
And there's a,

2177
01:53:15.860 --> 01:53:17.900
there's different protocols that people follow.

2178
01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:20.710
There's some doctors that have a protocol where you,
uh,

2179
01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:24.280
slowly vaccinate your children instead of giving them a gigantic amount of,

2180
01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:28.430
and I think that is,
look,
you're not supposed to give babies peanut butter man.

2181
01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:32.570
You know,
Peter,
if you give peanut butter to babies that you know,
you,

2182
01:53:32.571 --> 01:53:35.780
you'd never know if your kid's allergic to peanuts.
So you have to find out,

2183
01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:40.070
like babies are super sensitive and very delicate and they're very fragile.

2184
01:53:40.460 --> 01:53:44.720
That said,
the human immune system without a doubt has benefited from vaccines.

2185
01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:49.490
You know,
I just don't know if we have too many of them or if in the past,

2186
01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:52.970
I know for a fact and I'm a supporter of vaccines without a doubt.

2187
01:53:52.971 --> 01:53:54.560
I don't want to be even blurry about this.

2188
01:53:54.561 --> 01:53:59.561
I think vaccines have changed this world and have made society safe for us from

2189
01:54:00.410 --> 01:54:03.590
a lot of different ailments that said nothing is perfect.

2190
01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:06.260
And for sure without without doubt,

2191
01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:09.890
there have been people that have been harmed by vaccines.
The question is,

2192
01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:14.420
is it worth that risk,
um,
to,
to continue vaccinating people?

2193
01:54:14.421 --> 01:54:18.650
Is it worth the risk that the one out of x people have received damage?

2194
01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:20.150
I personally think,
yes,

2195
01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:23.090
I've personally think yes and I personally think you should proceed with caution

2196
01:54:23.091 --> 01:54:23.924
and I think you should.

2197
01:54:24.340 --> 01:54:28.910
I mean there should be a lot of different things that you read about from very

2198
01:54:28.970 --> 01:54:33.380
educated people about the subject.
And the reality is at educated people,

2199
01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:36.250
for the most part,
agree that vaccines are important bullet,

2200
01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:39.770
but through objective ones are willing to admit that people have been damaged by

2201
01:54:39.771 --> 01:54:40.604
vaccines before.

2202
01:54:40.730 --> 01:54:44.630
I have a friend and her fucking dad has Lyme disease and he got it from a

2203
01:54:44.631 --> 01:54:48.580
vaccine and he got it from a vaccine they don't even use anymore because some

2204
01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:53.620
people had a genetic predisposition to being adversely affected by this vaccine.

2205
01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:55.820
So we're fucking,
dad has Lyme disease man,

2206
01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:59.030
and he took a vaccine so that he wouldn't get Lyme disease because he was scared

2207
01:54:59.031 --> 01:55:01.520
of it.
His wife took the same vaccine,
nothing.

2208
01:55:01.670 --> 01:55:04.550
She actually got vaccinated from Lyme disease and it works.
But for him,

2209
01:55:04.551 --> 01:55:05.900
he got Lyme disease from it.

2210
01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:11.040
So that's that is inaction benefit and and a detraction and a negative effect of

2211
01:55:13.070 --> 01:55:16.460
vaccines.
I think that for the most part though,
look man,

2212
01:55:16.490 --> 01:55:19.820
there's a lot of fucking diseases we've eradicated like polio.

2213
01:55:20.090 --> 01:55:23.720
There's a lot of shit that we've removed but now like means those are starting

2214
01:55:23.721 --> 01:55:25.190
to come back.
You know,
people are,

2215
01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:27.650
there's certain diseases that we thought we got rid of the people starting to

2216
01:55:27.651 --> 01:55:31.310
get and one of the blame for that is that people aren't vaccinating their kids

2217
01:55:31.311 --> 01:55:33.110
for measles.
There's certain,

2218
01:55:33.170 --> 01:55:36.500
there's like a lot of people were afraid because the word was that it was the

2219
01:55:36.501 --> 01:55:40.760
measles,
mumps and rubella IA.
That was the one that was the,
the vaccine.

2220
01:55:40.761 --> 01:55:45.180
It was giving people,
you know,
all sorts of health and there's been lawsuits,
man.

2221
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.960
That's what other people,

2222
01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:49.830
a lot of people don't realize is a lot of money has been given out in vaccine

2223
01:55:49.831 --> 01:55:54.150
court for damage that was caused by vaccines.
Doesn't mean the vaccines are bad.

2224
01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:54.901
It's again,

2225
01:55:54.901 --> 01:55:59.850
it's one of those really complicated nuanced issues where it's not a fucking

2226
01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:04.880
grand design of Eugenics by the elite to control the population and dumb us

2227
01:56:06.290 --> 01:56:07.123
down.
It's not,

2228
01:56:07.320 --> 01:56:11.890
it's doctors trying to solve pandemic diseases can we were being serious six

2229
01:56:11.910 --> 01:56:16.190
civilization.
It was one of the more interesting things,
uh,
about my show was,
uh,

2230
01:56:16.230 --> 01:56:20.750
to me getting to talk to these a disease specialists and scientists and doctors

2231
01:56:20.751 --> 01:56:22.730
that we're talking about various pandemic diseases,

2232
01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:26.670
how many people are affected by tropical diseases that we're talking about.

2233
01:56:26.671 --> 01:56:31.020
People in pour like Africa and tropical environments where like everyone has

2234
01:56:31.050 --> 01:56:31.883
parasites,

2235
01:56:32.250 --> 01:56:37.250
everyone has certain diseases and like sexual diseases that are super dangerous.

2236
01:56:37.771 --> 01:56:41.670
Like the type of syphilis that you can't cure.
And then all these morphing,

2237
01:56:41.671 --> 01:56:42.930
changing diseases,

2238
01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:46.250
they're trying to constantly stay on top of these fucking things and they're

2239
01:56:46.290 --> 01:56:49.040
there.
There's diseases like mirrors.
You ever heard of Merced?

2240
01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:53.070
There's some disease called murs that kills literally half the people that it

2241
01:56:53.071 --> 01:56:56.210
gets infected by or half the people that didn't get infected with it.
There's,

2242
01:56:56.340 --> 01:57:00.030
there's nutty shit out there and there's doctors that are sticker rambling to

2243
01:57:00.031 --> 01:57:03.130
try to procure these things and try to come up with vaccines and,

2244
01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:07.890
but in the process,
sometimes there's damage.
You know,

2245
01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:10.680
you said you talked about this,
I'm one of your shows that came out.
Yeah.

2246
01:57:10.710 --> 01:57:15.300
On the Joe Rogan questions,
everything show aired.
Yes.
Yeah.

2247
01:57:15.301 --> 01:57:18.990
That was like,
uh,
let's,
let's find this out payouts.
That was a,

2248
01:57:18.991 --> 01:57:22.680
I think it was two weeks ago.
Then last week everybody got mad at me again.

2249
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:25.950
That was it.
Okay.
One,
nobody got mad at me,
but then last week was aliens.

2250
01:57:25.951 --> 01:57:29.640
It never was like,
dude,
you did not provide the,
I got all these,

2251
01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:33.270
how come you didn't show this video and this,
that puts this on my message board.

2252
01:57:33.270 --> 01:57:36.980
Clearly there's a wormhole like pitch that's someone's headline that's

2253
01:57:37.050 --> 01:57:38.130
headlights on a dark.

2254
01:57:38.131 --> 01:57:42.080
Meanwhile it's like you barely can see what the fuck that is,
man.
So,

2255
01:57:43.650 --> 01:57:48.340
oh my God,
I really imagine this stuff you've got to deal with.
Oh God.

2256
01:57:49.590 --> 01:57:54.240
The amount of fucking people that have been paid out in vaccine court.

2257
01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:59.190
There's a lot of pans.
Yeah.
It's like it happens all the time apparently.

2258
01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:00.181
Well not all the time,

2259
01:58:00.181 --> 01:58:02.730
but it's been millions of dollars to new cases are pretty here.

2260
01:58:02.850 --> 01:58:07.470
Vaccine Court awards,
millions to two children with autism.
Wow.

2261
01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:11.850
So that's the thing that people say that no vaccines don't cause autism.

2262
01:58:11.851 --> 01:58:14.630
And that's the argument.
Like some say it does and some say it doesn't.
It's,

2263
01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:18.210
it's the,
I don't know,
man.
I'm not a fucking doctor.
That's a real problem.

2264
01:58:18.211 --> 01:58:21.900
When I look at this kind of data is I have the saying that it's terrifying when

2265
01:58:21.901 --> 01:58:24.780
you're too stupid to know who's dumb.
You know?
That's,

2266
01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:27.510
that's how I feel about this stuff because when I read that,

2267
01:58:27.810 --> 01:58:32.810
that a court awarded millions of dollars to two children with autism vaccine

2268
01:58:33.091 --> 01:58:36.150
court awards,
millions to two children with.
Awesome.
I read that and I say,
okay,

2269
01:58:36.151 --> 01:58:38.430
well that means vaccines cause autism.
Is that what that means?

2270
01:58:38.710 --> 01:58:40.770
I didn't list that.
Had a couple of shots with autism in it,

2271
01:58:42.190 --> 01:58:47.140
but they don't have autism in a shot.
As far as I know.
We've got the autism.

2272
01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:51.310
Hannah poling developed an autistic condition after receiving nine vaccines in

2273
01:58:51.311 --> 01:58:56.311
one day following the u s government because seating or case in 2008 her damages

2274
01:58:56.711 --> 01:59:01.660
are awarded over her lifetime reported to be $20 million.
Oh my God.

2275
01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:06.220
Hmm.
May mean what does that mean then?
I don't,
I don't know what that means.

2276
01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:09.310
Does that mean that vaccine cause autism?
Cause that's what it sounds like.

2277
01:59:09.850 --> 01:59:12.070
How did they know that she didn't have autism before she got the shots?

2278
01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:14.230
That's a good question.
That's a very good question.

2279
01:59:14.350 --> 01:59:17.740
And if that's the case and how the fuck did they award,
how did that,

2280
01:59:18.550 --> 01:59:20.290
how'd that work out?
They gave her a $20 million.

2281
01:59:20.650 --> 01:59:24.970
Like is it just then the question is,
is it just bad court decision?

2282
01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:29.860
Is it just an uninformed,
is that what it is?
I don't understand.

2283
01:59:30.340 --> 01:59:31.660
Well,
this is,
listen,
listen to this.

2284
01:59:31.780 --> 01:59:36.780
Since 1989 and as of January of 2013 over two point $5 billion have been paid

2285
01:59:38.951 --> 01:59:43.360
out from this vaccine caused injury and death compensation fund.

2286
01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:49.260
So two point $5 billion had been paid out from the vaccine caused injury and

2287
01:59:49.991 --> 01:59:52.360
death competition.
When these are numbers that I'm,

2288
01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:56.860
I'm reading off of like these are legitimate websites,
this isn't,

2289
01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:59.160
this isn't like,
we're not just making things up.
This is,

2290
01:59:59.210 --> 02:00:01.720
these are not propaganda websites and the,

2291
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:06.750
they're not trying to hide this 9,785 claims have been dismissed and of those

2292
02:00:08.231 --> 02:00:08.591
claims,

2293
02:00:08.591 --> 02:00:13.591
3,982 claimants were paid $52 million to cover their attorney's fees and other

2294
02:00:16.751 --> 02:00:20.560
legal costs.
So they were paid.
Even the people were there,
the,

2295
02:00:20.561 --> 02:00:23.980
the claims were dismissed.
They paid their legal fees.

2296
02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:27.130
Like what are they doing there?
They just saying,
listen bitch,

2297
02:00:27.131 --> 02:00:29.590
I know you a lot of legal money and just let it go.

2298
02:00:29.650 --> 02:00:31.720
I know you're trying to fight in this,
you know,
we're gonna win.
I don't know,

2299
02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:35.770
but it's,
it is fascinating.
I don't understand it,

2300
02:00:35.860 --> 02:00:40.150
but I know that like when Jenny Mccarthy talks about vaccines and causing your

2301
02:00:40.151 --> 02:00:43.660
kid autism,
I have heard dudes were like the most progressive,

2302
02:00:43.930 --> 02:00:47.710
like male feminists,
like really like kind towards women.

2303
02:00:47.860 --> 02:00:52.860
Say some of the most nasty fucking evil shit to Jenny McCarthy because,

2304
02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:58.300
because you're allowed to because she expresses a very specific opinion about

2305
02:00:58.301 --> 02:01:02.350
vaccines and she's obviously not a fucking doctor and they think that what she's

2306
02:01:02.351 --> 02:01:07.120
doing is scaring people into not having vaccines and into a,
you know,

2307
02:01:07.150 --> 02:01:11.590
creating death and illness.
I maybe,
yeah,
maybe,

2308
02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:12.190
I don't know,

2309
02:01:12.190 --> 02:01:15.700
but maybe you need to pay attention to what the fuck I just read that seems like

2310
02:01:15.701 --> 02:01:17.260
it's,
that seems real new.

2311
02:01:17.261 --> 02:01:21.700
Jersey girl gets four point $7 million for vaccine injuries.

2312
02:01:21.730 --> 02:01:25.450
Here's another one.
This is from 2002 in New Jersey.

2313
02:01:25.451 --> 02:01:29.350
Girl who's mental development was stopped at two months old after a routine

2314
02:01:29.351 --> 02:01:33.430
immunization has received a four point $7 million settlement from a national

2315
02:01:33.431 --> 02:01:37.240
trust one.
I mean,
what the fuck is going on,
man?
What does that mean?

2316
02:01:37.450 --> 02:01:41.210
I don't know if that means that,
I mean in my dumb mind,

2317
02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:44.870
I read that and I,
you know,
it doesn't that,
what's that expression?

2318
02:01:44.871 --> 02:01:48.710
Causation does not equal something else.
What does that expression,

2319
02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:52.040
how's it going?
No,
causation doesn't.
If you want to seem smart on the Internet,

2320
02:01:52.041 --> 02:01:56.400
you have to repeat this because it does not look at that.
Jenny McCarthy.
Cool.

2321
02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:00.000
Okay.
Does not imply correlation.
So,

2322
02:02:00.250 --> 02:02:03.470
so just because something was caused,
it doesn't mean it was,

2323
02:02:03.580 --> 02:02:05.600
it's correlated with what you're blaming it on.

2324
02:02:05.630 --> 02:02:10.160
Like there's a lot of other factors involved,
but millions of fucking dollars,

2325
02:02:10.161 --> 02:02:14.900
man,
billions even given out.
So that's my opinion about vaccines.

2326
02:02:14.930 --> 02:02:16.520
I think they're very,
very important.

2327
02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:21.760
I think the people that are working on vaccines and that are fighting against

2328
02:02:22.071 --> 02:02:26.030
pandemic diseases are doing an amazing job of keeping people safe and they've

2329
02:02:26.031 --> 02:02:30.110
eradicated some really fucking dangerous,
horrible pandemic diseases.
That said,

2330
02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:33.680
obviously some people it fucks up or it seems to at least,

2331
02:02:34.190 --> 02:02:36.020
and I think it's not an either or situation.

2332
02:02:36.021 --> 02:02:38.240
I think people have to be really careful about that because if you're,

2333
02:02:38.241 --> 02:02:41.810
if you're rallying against these people that are talking badly about vaccines,

2334
02:02:41.811 --> 02:02:45.770
but then these facts are real and are available,
what are you doing?

2335
02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:49.640
Like what are you saying?
It's not an either or.
It's it's this,

2336
02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:53.830
there's a lot of complication there.
A lot of chance,
Huh?
It seems like it.
Yeah.

2337
02:02:53.930 --> 02:02:58.280
I mean,
from my uneducated perspective,
when I read that,
and again,

2338
02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:02.610
causation does not equal correlation known how smart I am.
Um,

2339
02:03:02.930 --> 02:03:05.360
I think that,
uh,
you got to say that there's,
you know,

2340
02:03:05.361 --> 02:03:09.650
there's obviously it's not that cut and dry.
It's not like I'm going to the,
uh,

2341
02:03:09.651 --> 02:03:13.300
the supreme court because I believe that a wizard made by Dick's mom,
you know,

2342
02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:16.100
and then the supreme court gives me $1 billion.
That seems,

2343
02:03:17.090 --> 02:03:19.790
that seems like how the white balls are fucking evidence.
I have a small deck.

2344
02:03:20.130 --> 02:03:24.230
Shouldn't miss.
So there you go.
I mean,
there you talking about,
you know,

2345
02:03:24.231 --> 02:03:26.600
it's not that it's not that fucking stupid.

2346
02:03:28.990 --> 02:03:31.810
That's the,
that's the answer.
That's my answer on chem trails.

2347
02:03:31.811 --> 02:03:35.300
And it's my answer on vaccines to very complicated issues that a lot of people

2348
02:03:35.301 --> 02:03:40.160
get real fucker.
We don't have the tinfoil.
So yes or no,
it might be that,

2349
02:03:40.161 --> 02:03:42.940
but it's also that people attach themselves to the ship.

2350
02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:45.530
They believe they want something to be fill a part of and have something to

2351
02:03:45.531 --> 02:03:49.280
fight for that.
Yeah.
And if they said something,
if like you say,

2352
02:03:49.310 --> 02:03:51.620
you know the fucking rainbows are created by Gremlins Bro.

2353
02:03:52.250 --> 02:03:55.100
And then you start telling people that and you make a video and you put it on

2354
02:03:55.101 --> 02:03:57.120
Youtube,
man,
you're committed to that shit.

2355
02:03:57.470 --> 02:04:01.400
And there's a lot of people out there committed to some really iffy ideas.
Like,

2356
02:04:01.401 --> 02:04:05.510
why are you coming?
Are you sure?
Are you fucking sure?
Shouldn't be sure man.

2357
02:04:05.780 --> 02:04:10.580
Not a lot of fuckery to this world.
Like when you said that you think that,
um,

2358
02:04:10.610 --> 02:04:13.610
you create your own destiny.
Everything happens for a reason.
You might be right.

2359
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.600
You know,
anybody says you're not right.
It's crazy.
If you say,
if you believe it,

2360
02:04:17.601 --> 02:04:20.930
you can achieve it.
Well,
you have so what the fuck do they know?
Maybe.

2361
02:04:20.931 --> 02:04:22.370
Maybe that is how the world works.

2362
02:04:22.610 --> 02:04:26.600
Maybe the world works by your imagination manifesting reality.

2363
02:04:26.750 --> 02:04:30.440
Maybe the world works by your intention and your focus literally changing the

2364
02:04:30.441 --> 02:04:31.310
world around you,

2365
02:04:31.311 --> 02:04:35.780
creating things and opportunities that would not have existed or been in front

2366
02:04:35.781 --> 02:04:39.120
of you if you didn't do that work.
If you didn't experience the those,

2367
02:04:39.121 --> 02:04:41.910
those revelations and evolutions of your spirit,

2368
02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:44.670
maybe you don't fucking know that's possible too,

2369
02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:46.890
because the world's not that fucking simple.

2370
02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:50.880
There's a God damn reason why when you hear a certain song,

2371
02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:55.140
it reminds you of a certain time in your life or a certain person you knew and

2372
02:04:55.141 --> 02:04:59.490
you have this intense emotional create a reaction to it.
And the,
the,

2373
02:04:59.510 --> 02:05:02.880
the beats of the music change your body.
You know,

2374
02:05:02.940 --> 02:05:06.120
there's certain times where you're by yourself and sweet home.

2375
02:05:06.121 --> 02:05:10.890
Alabama comes on the radio at just the right time.
And when it says turn it up,

2376
02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:14.040
don't,
don't,
I know.
And it changes your body.

2377
02:05:14.430 --> 02:05:19.380
It's the world is not just made out of numbers and it's not just made at a hard

2378
02:05:19.381 --> 02:05:21.990
surfaces and it's not just made it a things you can way.

2379
02:05:22.170 --> 02:05:26.160
There's also some weird spiritual aspect to this world,
you know,
and I don't,

2380
02:05:26.220 --> 02:05:28.260
I don't,
I think you,

2381
02:05:28.261 --> 02:05:31.860
you manifest a lot of it with your attitude and your behavior and your actions.

2382
02:05:31.980 --> 02:05:35.130
And I don't know how much of it would have been there without that.
I don't know.

2383
02:05:35.970 --> 02:05:39.600
I think it's both.
You know,
I think it's both.
If a brick drops in your head,

2384
02:05:39.601 --> 02:05:44.460
it will fucking kill you.
That's true too.
You know,
sometimes shit happens,

2385
02:05:44.461 --> 02:05:49.320
man.
Look,
the fucking war,
the dinosaurs asking for that big asteroid hit.
Not,

2386
02:05:49.380 --> 02:05:53.670
no,
probably not.
You know,
I don't know if that,
I don't know if it's that simple.

2387
02:05:53.850 --> 02:05:58.380
I think it's both.
It's both.
You create your reality and shit happens.

2388
02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:01.950
That too.
Shit fucking happen.
You didn't ask to break your ankle in that fight.

2389
02:06:02.580 --> 02:06:06.180
Why did that happen?
That's some shit happens.
Right.
So I'm wondering,
you know,

2390
02:06:06.181 --> 02:06:09.780
things are predetermined for some point that that just kind of led me to make

2391
02:06:09.781 --> 02:06:12.630
the decision.
Okay,
55 is too low of a weight class.

2392
02:06:12.631 --> 02:06:15.270
I'm just destroying my body in the knee.
Injuries is just coming too easy.

2393
02:06:15.660 --> 02:06:18.120
Maybe if I was at 70 million,
my ankle would have rolled a bit differently.

2394
02:06:18.121 --> 02:06:20.110
You know,
we have more stability.
Just cutting to wait,
you know,

2395
02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:21.540
depleting the body too much.

2396
02:06:21.660 --> 02:06:25.410
So that was my last fight at 55 which made me go up to 70 so yeah.
You know,

2397
02:06:25.411 --> 02:06:25.890
who knows.

2398
02:06:25.890 --> 02:06:29.160
It could have been or it could have been that you realized after that that you

2399
02:06:29.161 --> 02:06:30.750
needed to make a change and being the winner,

2400
02:06:30.751 --> 02:06:34.710
that you are felt the right path and went down it and it succeeded because

2401
02:06:34.711 --> 02:06:36.090
that's what you do.
You dust yourself off,

2402
02:06:36.091 --> 02:06:39.240
you figure out what went wrong and you move forward and that's what you did do.

2403
02:06:39.330 --> 02:06:42.870
So it could have been things happen for a reason or it could have been the

2404
02:06:42.871 --> 02:06:45.350
reason things happen is because you're a winner.
Yeah.

2405
02:06:45.410 --> 02:06:48.180
It makes the role that one you can control.

2406
02:06:48.650 --> 02:06:51.390
See that what I like about that one is that one,
you can control.

2407
02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:54.420
And that one seems to make more sense because everybody that I know that has

2408
02:06:54.421 --> 02:06:57.240
ever succeeded in things,
they're winners.
They're winners.
They have,

2409
02:06:57.241 --> 02:06:59.970
they have that ability to fucking figure out how to get up when they don't want

2410
02:06:59.971 --> 02:07:02.910
to get up.
They have that ability to do the things that they have to do,

2411
02:07:02.970 --> 02:07:05.280
putting the work that they have to put in,
get shit done.

2412
02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:06.390
And the people that don't,

2413
02:07:06.820 --> 02:07:11.070
we all know super talented fighters that never made it.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that's true.

2414
02:07:11.310 --> 02:07:14.100
That's true.
There's a lot of guys out there shot yet.

2415
02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:17.070
There's a lot of guys out there that had that special something and it never

2416
02:07:17.071 --> 02:07:17.904
could put it together.

2417
02:07:18.090 --> 02:07:22.740
There's a few guys that shown so greatly in like preliminary fights and you're

2418
02:07:22.741 --> 02:07:24.300
like,
this motherfucker's a world champion.

2419
02:07:24.530 --> 02:07:27.190
Now you're looking at it and be like this guy and you hear from the people,
Oh,

2420
02:07:27.210 --> 02:07:30.690
in the gym,
he dominates everybody.
There's so many fine or something like that.

2421
02:07:30.850 --> 02:07:33.850
How many,
how many times you heard that about Joe rigs.
Oh,
that's right.

2422
02:07:33.851 --> 02:07:36.050
You had to hear about the drover.
Exactly.
He's a bad

2423
02:07:36.050 --> 02:07:39.760
<v 1>ass.
A Joe raise used to dominate rich Franklin and the gym that they would be</v>

2424
02:07:39.761 --> 02:07:42.250
sparked and Joe Briggs just be lightened rich Franklin up,

2425
02:07:42.690 --> 02:07:45.610
but in competition can put it really well.

2426
02:07:45.611 --> 02:07:48.490
He had some great fights and he had some great results and he had a long career

2427
02:07:48.491 --> 02:07:51.160
and he's a,
he's still a bad motherfucker and a great professional fighter,

2428
02:07:51.161 --> 02:07:53.020
but if you listen to people talk,

2429
02:07:53.021 --> 02:07:55.720
they said they make Joe rigs out to be Anderson Silva.

2430
02:07:56.020 --> 02:07:58.570
They make Joe rigs out to be some magic man.
You know,
some,

2431
02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:01.570
some dude that on perfect moments on the right moments.

2432
02:08:01.780 --> 02:08:04.870
Like I remember talking to Billy Rush before he died and uh,

2433
02:08:05.080 --> 02:08:08.140
Billy Rush was training those guys and he,
and he said to me,
he goes,

2434
02:08:08.380 --> 02:08:10.600
he's one of the greatest talents I've ever seen.
He said,

2435
02:08:10.601 --> 02:08:14.690
this fucking kid can do it all.
And he does it all like perfect in,

2436
02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:18.830
in spurts in the gym and you know,
and when he's his head's right,
you know,

2437
02:08:18.850 --> 02:08:22.600
and then shit happens.
And that crazy world of,
of,

2438
02:08:22.601 --> 02:08:26.690
of chaos and sometimes it doesn't come together for you.
You know,

2439
02:08:26.780 --> 02:08:29.980
if it's the reason that everything happens for a reason,

2440
02:08:30.010 --> 02:08:31.870
then there's some people that got some dealt some shitty cards,

2441
02:08:31.871 --> 02:08:34.450
you know what I mean?
If everything happened for reasons,

2442
02:08:34.460 --> 02:08:36.160
like there's a lot of things you can't explain,
you know,

2443
02:08:36.850 --> 02:08:38.590
and in the world of prize fighting,

2444
02:08:38.650 --> 02:08:43.650
I think that shit manifests itself in such a strange and dramatic way because

2445
02:08:43.691 --> 02:08:47.050
the difference between winning and losing is so much more extreme than golf or

2446
02:08:47.051 --> 02:08:49.570
tennis or anything else.
So we have our options.

2447
02:08:49.750 --> 02:08:53.230
It's not just so many more options.
It's so much more devastating results.

2448
02:08:53.530 --> 02:08:57.190
You know,
you can lose a tennis match and you'd go home and you're fine.
You know,

2449
02:08:57.191 --> 02:08:59.800
like if you lose an MMA fight,
your health can change.

2450
02:08:59.890 --> 02:09:03.220
The structure of your face looks different.
You have to get plates in your face,

2451
02:09:03.221 --> 02:09:05.320
you have to get your,
you know,
your face stitched up.

2452
02:09:05.321 --> 02:09:06.310
Can't breathe out of my nose.

2453
02:09:08.350 --> 02:09:10.860
I'm sure almost everybody has that right?
Yeah.

2454
02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:14.170
I had mine operated on a few years.

2455
02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:18.010
You sweetest thing I've ever done all my life.
I was a mouth breather.

2456
02:09:18.011 --> 02:09:19.900
I broke my nose when I was like five.

2457
02:09:19.901 --> 02:09:24.010
I fell down a flight of stairs and it was always like,
I'll just,
I nasal,

2458
02:09:24.011 --> 02:09:27.370
I had a nasal sound to my voice and I mouth breathed every practice.

2459
02:09:27.371 --> 02:09:29.590
Everything I ever did was mouth breathing.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2460
02:09:30.250 --> 02:09:32.710
These guys and make sure their bite down on their mouthpiece ratio.

2461
02:09:32.711 --> 02:09:35.130
If you do end up receiving the shot and with the mouth closed and couldn't,

2462
02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:38.120
you know,
holding it together.
That's one of the main things for sure.

2463
02:09:38.121 --> 02:09:40.060
It would make sure that they're buying into the mouth piece so we get them out

2464
02:09:40.061 --> 02:09:42.790
of pieces that you can breathe through the center of the hole right from

2465
02:09:42.791 --> 02:09:44.440
unbreakable Hector and the Victorville.

2466
02:09:44.650 --> 02:09:46.270
I think it makes the best mouthpieces I'm breaking down.

2467
02:09:46.740 --> 02:09:48.870
He makes a double an upper and lower.

2468
02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:52.360
When you breathe out on the top of the bottom of your teeth through dollar does

2469
02:09:52.361 --> 02:09:54.010
lock into place.
But for mine specifically,

2470
02:09:54.011 --> 02:09:56.920
I blow air child through the center and I think Tina,
do you have yours?
No.
Yeah,

2471
02:09:57.010 --> 02:09:58.830
it's not a double.
It's a single mouse,

2472
02:09:59.350 --> 02:10:02.140
but it's got like a little like a gap underneath that where you can breathe with

2473
02:10:02.141 --> 02:10:05.080
your mouth shut.
Oh that's very smart.
Bottom teeth just don't connect.
Okay.

2474
02:10:05.090 --> 02:10:08.200
That's very smart.
The devils that are payment.
Yeah,
the doubles are weird.

2475
02:10:08.201 --> 02:10:11.050
You can't talk to them and they used to have that power.

2476
02:10:11.051 --> 02:10:13.870
One member that was there were saying that it makes you like whips or something

2477
02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:18.220
like that makes you stronger,
makes you like less.
That's what I need.

2478
02:10:18.230 --> 02:10:23.230
That balance or something that they actually say that your draw alignment does

2479
02:10:25.661 --> 02:10:28.600
have some impact on what,
how strong you are.

2480
02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:31.120
Like I think there's a science behind it.
Like if you have your mouth open,

2481
02:10:31.121 --> 02:10:34.280
he tried dead lifts,
tried dead lift,
like oh I think

2482
02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:37.130
<v 0>literally you're not as strong as if you fucking clamped down.</v>

2483
02:10:37.131 --> 02:10:39.330
I don't think I've ever dead lift with her mouth open and maybe you should try

2484
02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:41.480
it.
Be Interesting to find out that works.

2485
02:10:41.481 --> 02:10:46.220
It might be bullshit and you know it might be,
but I think I read that.
I think.

2486
02:10:46.580 --> 02:10:49.700
How long did it take for your nose to heal when you got that long?
Man,

2487
02:10:49.701 --> 02:10:53.480
I was rolling six weeks later.
I had a great doctor,
his name was Dr Feinberg.

2488
02:10:53.481 --> 02:10:56.450
He retired unfortunately use out here in California,

2489
02:10:56.630 --> 02:10:59.480
but he did an amazing job and they use foam now.

2490
02:10:59.481 --> 02:11:02.630
So it used to be the nightmare was getting the packing out that pulling the

2491
02:11:02.631 --> 02:11:04.310
packing.
I was incredibly painful.

2492
02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:07.270
Like Lorenzo Fertitta had it that way and he said that he was like,

2493
02:11:07.420 --> 02:11:12.170
like someone was like raking his brain really intensely painful when they pull

2494
02:11:12.171 --> 02:11:13.490
the packing out,
when it's over,

2495
02:11:13.780 --> 02:11:16.370
they keep it in your nose for like a couple of days or something or a week or

2496
02:11:16.371 --> 02:11:17.204
whatever the fuck it is.

2497
02:11:17.380 --> 02:11:20.750
I actually think it changed the structure and I know they made it wider because

2498
02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:22.970
they'd put the cut the inside of it,

2499
02:11:22.971 --> 02:11:27.610
the the tuber with a fucking things call those turbinate or terminate turf

2500
02:11:27.850 --> 02:11:29.710
terminators,
whatever things inside.

2501
02:11:29.711 --> 02:11:32.810
So they scraped them down and then he put these splints in that like,

2502
02:11:32.811 --> 02:11:35.300
why didn't my opening,
I kept the splints in for like,

2503
02:11:35.810 --> 02:11:38.540
I dunno like a couple of weeks or whatever,
but after it was open,

2504
02:11:38.541 --> 02:11:41.030
after he cut out the scar tissue and terminators,

2505
02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:42.650
what are those things where some trim that down?

2506
02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:46.640
It was actually like a wider passage.
I want to get to.
It's great.

2507
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:49.220
I feel like bill,
my cardio would be better.

2508
02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:52.550
[inaudible] hundred percent there's no doubt about it.
It will be,

2509
02:11:52.670 --> 02:11:55.110
but then you've got to realize you're gonna get hit in the nose.
Yeah,
that's,

2510
02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:58.040
I wouldn't talk to a doctor and he,
I actually got something done on my nose.

2511
02:11:58.280 --> 02:11:59.210
I don't know exactly what he's called,

2512
02:11:59.211 --> 02:12:00.740
but he scraped it like you're talking about.

2513
02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:02.900
And then he shocked with radio frequency.

2514
02:12:02.901 --> 02:12:06.650
Electricity is supposed to shrink to tissue and it takes like six weeks for it

2515
02:12:06.651 --> 02:12:10.760
to work.
That's interesting.
My nose is a little bit better,
I guess,
you know,
but,

2516
02:12:10.761 --> 02:12:12.410
uh,
I want to get like the full thing done.

2517
02:12:12.420 --> 02:12:13.730
I think I need to do after the next fight.

2518
02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:16.400
I've seen pictures of people that did that,

2519
02:12:16.401 --> 02:12:19.610
did it online where they showed all the meat that they cut out of their nose.

2520
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:22.370
The scar tissue gets fucking crazy.

2521
02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:24.560
Do you think it will mess with the structural integrity of your nose?

2522
02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:27.740
Your nose is still a strong yes.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Yeah,
it does.

2523
02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:29.150
It's one of the doctors was saying that he,

2524
02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:32.480
I mean obviously it's the doctor's opinion from different,
from different,
uh,

2525
02:12:32.930 --> 02:12:35.240
but he was saying that he thinks of the structural integrity of nose would be

2526
02:12:35.241 --> 02:12:38.840
worse.
I don't think so.
I mean I think,
look,
you know,
this week anyway,

2527
02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:42.270
this little fucking thing,
you get shinned in that thing.
It's not,
I mean,

2528
02:12:42.810 --> 02:12:46.100
whether it's strong,
I mean when it's in perfect condition,
it's weak.
It's fuck.

2529
02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:50.420
So go on it from there and then also go on it from like the goal is to not get

2530
02:12:50.421 --> 02:12:51.290
hit in the face,
so let's,

2531
02:12:51.291 --> 02:12:54.710
let's have an extra incentive and then now your cardio is going to be like a

2532
02:12:54.711 --> 02:12:56.930
good percentage better,
which is way more important.
That's,

2533
02:12:56.950 --> 02:13:00.440
you just don't do what Vandelay did.
Randall,
he got his homeboy,

2534
02:13:00.710 --> 02:13:01.990
he had to get his whole fucking,

2535
02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.510
that was a perfect example of a guy who had to get his whole face reconstructed.

2536
02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:05.060
Yeah.

2537
02:13:05.060 --> 02:13:07.970
He had to get his eyebrows scraped down because I was told him different cots

2538
02:13:07.990 --> 02:13:11.690
had massive scar tissue.
They had to remove it and that.
Yeah.

2539
02:13:11.780 --> 02:13:15.500
But next was not nearly as extreme extreme.
Yeah.
Nick got his,
his uh,

2540
02:13:15.501 --> 02:13:18.240
his shit shaved down,
but they would put it back together again.

2541
02:13:18.241 --> 02:13:22.770
He still looked like normal Vandelay they had to like Rome.
I'm a normal guy.

2542
02:13:22.771 --> 02:13:25.160
Yeah.
I mean just saying they um,

2543
02:13:26.150 --> 02:13:30.140
with Vandelay they had to actually take a chunk of his ribs and create a piece

2544
02:13:30.141 --> 02:13:32.040
of cartilage and the rebuild his

2545
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:36.630
<v 1>nose,
his nose was flat.
Dude,
that's the,
that's from not moving your head</v>

2546
02:13:37.350 --> 02:13:41.770
<v 2>rolling and not moving your hand forward.
That was one of things.</v>

2547
02:13:41.771 --> 02:13:44.810
I actually have a cauliflower into my note cause he's just how I went to my

2548
02:13:44.820 --> 02:13:48.120
buddy in the belly one time when he need and my nose is swollen up and it went

2549
02:13:48.121 --> 02:13:50.430
in with the center of it just put up with blood hard.

2550
02:13:50.490 --> 02:13:53.160
They're hard and yet just like your ear at cauliflower ear,
it's the same.

2551
02:13:53.190 --> 02:13:56.280
They went in Atlanta and all this blood just came rushing out and then they

2552
02:13:56.281 --> 02:13:58.860
filled it with look like a shoelace and it was up.

2553
02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:01.980
They stepped up in there to suck up the blood and you know,
a little gaps.

2554
02:14:02.670 --> 02:14:05.040
And that was for one of my Q one fights,
you know,
however long ago that was,

2555
02:14:05.041 --> 02:14:08.640
you know,
I don't know,
six,
seven years ago,
and then I should say recently,

2556
02:14:08.641 --> 02:14:10.830
but about three years ago,
I haven't know,
scraped down.

2557
02:14:10.830 --> 02:14:14.430
Actually they went in there and then he said that the sermon nose was like a

2558
02:14:14.431 --> 02:14:16.130
snowball in my nose,
so he,

2559
02:14:16.131 --> 02:14:18.270
he was scared to take more out and my nose would collapse,

2560
02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:22.620
which they put on a little luck.
Okay,
cool.
Plastic,
orange,
orange,

2561
02:14:23.070 --> 02:14:27.030
orange slice on.
I'm up in there to keep it structurally sound while it healed.

2562
02:14:27.031 --> 02:14:30.460
Yeah.
And then they pulled him out.
It's coming out of my brain.
I was nice.
Yeah.

2563
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:33.960
I got to have it done against my nose.
I still can't breathe through one nostril.

2564
02:14:34.170 --> 02:14:36.210
The other one's good though,
so you can make sure I have the map.

2565
02:14:36.250 --> 02:14:39.340
<v 1>It's this shitty design.
Yeah.
I mean,
why is it a week?</v>

2566
02:14:39.450 --> 02:14:40.490
It's on the front of your face.

2567
02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:45.380
It's not designed to get punched in the head like man,
like a lot of accidents.

2568
02:14:45.381 --> 02:14:48.980
I don't know for designers,
well,
I broke mine without,

2569
02:14:48.981 --> 02:14:51.860
I broke mine when I was five I fell down a flight of stairs and I just smashed

2570
02:14:51.861 --> 02:14:54.380
my nose on the stair and from then on it was locked.

2571
02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:57.320
I guess that's why we have the option of be dry mouth as well I guess.

2572
02:14:57.321 --> 02:15:00.230
But what a shit design.
Yeah,
because once it got,

2573
02:15:00.231 --> 02:15:03.590
I didn't realize how important it wasn't till I got it fixed and then once I got

2574
02:15:03.591 --> 02:15:06.380
to fix like the idea of being able to breathe my mouth shut,

2575
02:15:06.381 --> 02:15:07.550
it was impossible to me.

2576
02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:11.470
I'd never known it might wake up with dry mouth in the morning.
Wow.

2577
02:15:11.700 --> 02:15:16.110
And all of a sudden I'm like,
this is awesome.
Nice.
Yeah.

2578
02:15:16.130 --> 02:15:18.290
I could be like that for awhile.
Then it came back again,

2579
02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:20.540
like I would go to yoga class and they would tell me I'm doing it wrong.

2580
02:15:20.570 --> 02:15:23.110
Like you have to breathe in through your nose,
out through your mouth.
I can't,

2581
02:15:23.150 --> 02:15:25.700
it doesn't work.
The shit doesn't work.

2582
02:15:25.790 --> 02:15:28.970
<v 2>Yeah.
I was racing my wife with blown up balloons with half for one of our,</v>

2583
02:15:28.971 --> 02:15:31.910
one of our kids' birthdays and she was just smashed me and I couldn't figure out

2584
02:15:31.911 --> 02:15:34.550
why I was opening my mouth.
I was breathing,
you know,

2585
02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:38.540
breathing the air through my nose.
So just slowing down the process by half.

2586
02:15:38.690 --> 02:15:39.750
So she was just smashed me on that,

2587
02:15:40.050 --> 02:15:41.710
<v 1>blown up until I'm blown up drill.</v>

2588
02:15:41.980 --> 02:15:45.880
I had to take it out of did I just one I had to figure in adapt.

2589
02:15:45.940 --> 02:15:49.920
What do you think about all these new technologies that are coming along that

2590
02:15:49.930 --> 02:15:54.200
are,
we had Ian Mccall on,
he was talking about some shit.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2591
02:15:54.220 --> 02:15:57.160
I was talking about,
well some,
some altitude thing.
It's,

2592
02:15:57.640 --> 02:16:01.960
it's what it does is it mimics sounded crazy man.
Yeah.

2593
02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:03.880
Sounded really,
it mimics,

2594
02:16:03.881 --> 02:16:08.830
it's a c Vac pod is what it's called and it does something with like changing

2595
02:16:08.831 --> 02:16:11.220
the altitude inside the container and it just like,
uh,

2596
02:16:11.390 --> 02:16:16.390
it makes a massive difference in your body's ability to assimilate oxygen other

2597
02:16:16.401 --> 02:16:18.370
than I'm going to up for trying anything.
You know what I mean?

2598
02:16:18.371 --> 02:16:20.950
If it's someone says it works like,
oh,
I need to try this out.

2599
02:16:20.980 --> 02:16:25.000
You know what I mean?
Well,
Ian's no bullshit or he's crazy,
but he's no bullshit.

2600
02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:28.420
And when he's talking about,
he said it was better than a hyperbaric chamber,

2601
02:16:28.421 --> 02:16:31.870
which is,
I know the hyperbaric chamber man.
Yeah,
I hurt my shoulder.

2602
02:16:31.871 --> 02:16:36.550
Nothing on my cardio.
Like I did it for injury.
I got better faster,

2603
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:40.210
but my cardio was insanely good when I started sitting in the hyperbaric
chamber.

2604
02:16:40.211 --> 02:16:42.640
Like I noticed a big difference.
Yeah,
I've,

2605
02:16:42.641 --> 02:16:45.310
I've heard amazing results as far as like the ability to heal.

2606
02:16:45.730 --> 02:16:48.280
I wish I could afford to be in it all the time.
Really.
Dude.

2607
02:16:48.281 --> 02:16:51.040
I would do it if I could do it once a week,
if not more.
I would do it.

2608
02:16:51.130 --> 02:16:53.790
Just don't they make them,
well,
you can get it for the gym.
They know they're,

2609
02:16:53.791 --> 02:16:56.050
they're not,
they're not the heart chambers.
They're the soft chambers.

2610
02:16:56.051 --> 02:16:56.920
They don't work as well.

2611
02:16:57.580 --> 02:17:01.630
You can't get as much hundred like the heart chambers is 100% oxygen and they

2612
02:17:01.631 --> 02:17:04.870
can put you down to like two atmospheric pressures to be low.
You know,
and,

2613
02:17:05.130 --> 02:17:08.530
and the soft chambers,
they can't do that.
So it doesn't work as well.
It works,

2614
02:17:08.860 --> 02:17:11.350
but not as well as the heart chambers.
What is the variation?

2615
02:17:11.710 --> 02:17:15.790
What do you mean between how much better the heart chamber works so much better.

2616
02:17:15.791 --> 02:17:16.810
I don't even know exactly,

2617
02:17:16.811 --> 02:17:20.470
but I've done a little bit of a soft chambers in the heart.

2618
02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:22.660
I can tell big difference when I'm sitting in the heart chamber.

2619
02:17:22.710 --> 02:17:26.710
And where would you go to do that if you go to a chiropractor?
No,
I uh,

2620
02:17:26.711 --> 02:17:29.580
there's a place,
there's places to do hyperbaric chambers.
That's what they do.

2621
02:17:29.620 --> 02:17:33.310
They just only do,
have very chambers and uh,
it was in Sacramento.

2622
02:17:34.090 --> 02:17:37.240
Um,
I got prescribed through it from my physical therapist.

2623
02:17:37.241 --> 02:17:40.120
He's the one that told me about it on the stupid expensive.
Oh yeah,

2624
02:17:40.210 --> 02:17:43.260
like a hundred grand or something crazy.
Oh,
he had to buy one of them.
Yeah,

2625
02:17:43.310 --> 02:17:44.680
maybe a couple hundred thousand dollars.

2626
02:17:44.980 --> 02:17:46.960
And then you got to fill the oxygen all the time.
So for me,

2627
02:17:46.961 --> 02:17:48.490
if I went and go and do an hour and a half dive,

2628
02:17:48.730 --> 02:17:53.140
I found the cheapest place to do it and it's still 200 bucks per hour and a
half.

2629
02:17:53.560 --> 02:17:55.840
Wow.
That was always good about Colorado at the high altitude.

2630
02:17:56.330 --> 02:17:59.470
Going to go your pressure though.
That was the pressure.

2631
02:17:59.471 --> 02:18:02.410
So it's 100% oxygen and the pressure is supposed to be like speeds up the

2632
02:18:02.411 --> 02:18:05.800
molecules of healing and then all the way your body absorbs the oxygen.

2633
02:18:05.801 --> 02:18:07.480
I can't even tell you the science behind it,

2634
02:18:07.660 --> 02:18:10.690
but all's I know is that it works dude and it's supposed to be great for your

2635
02:18:10.691 --> 02:18:13.210
brain.
Wow.
Yeah.
I've heard nothing but amazing.

2636
02:18:13.211 --> 02:18:15.030
I felt like my handwriting got better when I was sitting there.

2637
02:18:16.450 --> 02:18:18.100
I started signing so I was like,
Oh Dang my hand.
Right.

2638
02:18:18.101 --> 02:18:22.280
I mean it could just be coincidence can use.
That
sucks.
Yeah,

2639
02:18:22.420 --> 02:18:26.290
but this is supposed to be according to at least Corny Ian.
This is even better.

2640
02:18:26.500 --> 02:18:30.310
It's called cyclical cyclical variations in adaptive conditioning.

2641
02:18:30.311 --> 02:18:33.640
See Vac and it's some crazy pod that you,

2642
02:18:33.670 --> 02:18:37.660
you lay in and using proprietary patterns,
sequences,

2643
02:18:37.690 --> 02:18:42.690
pressure is increased and decreased to simulate low altitudes in high altitudes.

2644
02:18:42.791 --> 02:18:43.960
And as pressure increases,

2645
02:18:43.961 --> 02:18:48.430
the volume of oxygen in the air and naturally increases is thicker and warmer

2646
02:18:48.790 --> 02:18:53.110
and as pressure decreases,
the volume of oxygen naturally diminishes.

2647
02:18:53.111 --> 02:18:54.280
And the air is thinner and cooler.

2648
02:18:54.550 --> 02:18:57.760
And they hypothesize that these changes simulate,

2649
02:18:57.790 --> 02:19:01.450
stimulate an individual's natural adaptation response to environment.

2650
02:19:01.810 --> 02:19:04.060
And the experience is unique to the individual,

2651
02:19:04.061 --> 02:19:08.230
but it's apparently has massive effects on a healing.

2652
02:19:08.380 --> 02:19:12.350
And there's even scientific findings that were published and a in,

2653
02:19:12.351 --> 02:19:17.170
in medical literature.
So it's not like just crazy nonsense that some wacky dude,

2654
02:19:17.290 --> 02:19:20.170
let's try that.
Very many places to do this,
right?
I don't think so.

2655
02:19:20.171 --> 02:19:23.440
I think there's only a few.
Um,
he was saying that there's,
let's look,
okay,

2656
02:19:23.441 --> 02:19:24.750
well it looks like locations.

2657
02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:29.330
Clearly there's only one way to survive chem trails.

2658
02:19:29.331 --> 02:19:31.720
You have to get into machine.

2659
02:19:32.450 --> 02:19:36.260
This is what the elites were using to protect themselves from the barium being

2660
02:19:36.261 --> 02:19:37.610
sprayed.
Whoa.

2661
02:19:38.510 --> 02:19:41.960
It's crunching and it doesn't seem like it's a good idea.

2662
02:19:42.170 --> 02:19:46.670
Well that's cause you're not a doctor.
You sick.
We'd given out fucking advice.

2663
02:19:46.730 --> 02:19:48.880
I hope your body's stronger than that water.
So there's,

2664
02:19:48.881 --> 02:19:53.400
there's several of these things in North America,
there's nine locations,
uh,

2665
02:19:53.450 --> 02:19:56.930
in the California area.
Oh Wow.
Anything in northern,

2666
02:19:57.560 --> 02:20:02.060
I'm trying to find it.
This,
this website sucks.
A fat one boy,

2667
02:20:02.061 --> 02:20:05.570
you have terrible website.
You fuck heads and you locations.

2668
02:20:05.570 --> 02:20:10.070
How much is his list phone numbers instead of having this stupid map that you

2669
02:20:10.071 --> 02:20:12.220
have to zoom in and out of.
This is terror.

2670
02:20:12.221 --> 02:20:15.080
When there was the websites you've fuckheads you should go.

2671
02:20:15.081 --> 02:20:18.480
You guys should go to Squarespace shit together.

2672
02:20:19.220 --> 02:20:22.280
So there's one in a private residence in Redmond,
Washington.

2673
02:20:22.281 --> 02:20:24.790
Why would you say that?
He will tell us where this dude lives.

2674
02:20:24.791 --> 02:20:28.670
So you're knocking on his door.
Yo Bro.
My fucking ankle.
Heart easy machine.

2675
02:20:28.671 --> 02:20:32.420
Can I borrow your shit side?
It says nine,

2676
02:20:33.080 --> 02:20:37.340
nine locations here.
Zoom in for details.
I don't always do the man bitch,

2677
02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:38.801
why isn't it not?
Let me,

2678
02:20:38.801 --> 02:20:42.980
he's gonna man cause it sucks cause your website sucks with that one.

2679
02:20:43.010 --> 02:20:46.940
Oh now I'm in Spain.
I zoomed in and I'm experience.
How about fuck you?

2680
02:20:47.460 --> 02:20:50.240
How about fuck?
Fuck you dummies.
I don't really believe that.

2681
02:20:50.270 --> 02:20:53.910
I don't mean fuck you.
I'm just saying that for effect through macro effective,

2682
02:20:53.920 --> 02:20:56.120
they'll listen to this.
He was talking really great about our product,

2683
02:20:56.121 --> 02:20:59.600
but then we started criticizing our website and it really hurt my feelings.

2684
02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:04.040
If those MMA guys,
I think they get aggressive when they get together.

2685
02:21:04.700 --> 02:21:07.010
Definitely MMA guys,
product of your surroundings.

2686
02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:11.120
Like we were a train at the gym.
I felt like I was gangster.
I'm pretty relaxed.

2687
02:21:11.180 --> 02:21:15.140
Yeah,
well you get gangster when you teach it.
I love it.
Yeah,
he does,
man.

2688
02:21:15.470 --> 02:21:18.430
You gotta watch out this stuff.
Well you obviously love it,
you know,

2689
02:21:18.500 --> 02:21:22.910
and that's exactly what you need.
It's,
I think it's such a amazing thing.

2690
02:21:22.940 --> 02:21:27.940
The ability to sort of mold young fighters and that for a guy like me who loves

2691
02:21:28.340 --> 02:21:32.150
martial arts as an art,
you know,
as an art form,
I'm real good.

2692
02:21:32.151 --> 02:21:35.750
It really is an art form.
I know people go when you're injuring people,

2693
02:21:35.830 --> 02:21:39.740
it smells like water color asshole.
Yeah,
but you're good enough to do it.

2694
02:21:39.741 --> 02:21:41.270
To not injure people too.
You know what I mean?

2695
02:21:41.560 --> 02:21:44.480
Good enough at the art to where you could do it without injuring someone.

2696
02:21:44.481 --> 02:21:47.720
You could,
you could defense defend yourself without hurting someone.
Well,
sure,

2697
02:21:47.721 --> 02:21:48.830
if a dork attacked you,

2698
02:21:49.140 --> 02:21:52.030
like say if some dude who was like really good at dungeons and dragons and it

2699
02:21:52.250 --> 02:21:56.840
fucking went spazz on you and rushed you,
I'm going to bite him.

2700
02:21:57.260 --> 02:21:59.480
Having in my head,
if you know,
if it ever came to the point,
you know,

2701
02:21:59.481 --> 02:22:01.570
outside of the gym or the cage or something,

2702
02:22:01.580 --> 02:22:04.460
I had a fight in the street or defend myself,
chuck them out,
choked my,

2703
02:22:04.500 --> 02:22:05.450
or just punched him in the gut.

2704
02:22:05.451 --> 02:22:07.800
Like how many normal people actually get punched in the gut.
You know,

2705
02:22:07.850 --> 02:22:10.640
just knocked the wind out of him.
You'd would have to be really diligent.

2706
02:22:10.830 --> 02:22:14.540
Like you don't want to just tee off on some asshole because he started a fight

2707
02:22:14.541 --> 02:22:17.810
with you.
It's so hard to repress that.

2708
02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:21.530
But we've all been in a situation where some drunk dude is clearly fucked up,

2709
02:22:21.550 --> 02:22:23.480
was talking so much shit.
And you're like,

2710
02:22:23.780 --> 02:22:27.240
I could just uncork one on this guy's face and you know he's not going to see it

2711
02:22:27.241 --> 02:22:30.540
coming,
but you can't do that the best way to,
I mean you,
you'll get in trouble.

2712
02:22:30.541 --> 02:22:33.140
I'll get in trouble man.
Yeah,
of course.
Not only that and they,

2713
02:22:33.600 --> 02:22:38.600
I just fucking pulled up the mma.com and fucking mixed martial arts.com and

2714
02:22:38.700 --> 02:22:42.430
ceremonies in trouble for that.
He had kicked some do it on a dot.
Oh,

2715
02:22:42.920 --> 02:22:45.990
I got stupid with them.
There was some,
uh,
throw a head kick.
Yeah,

2716
02:22:45.991 --> 02:22:49.860
apparently shitting them.
That's the rumor I'm talking Shit Donald,

2717
02:22:49.861 --> 02:22:51.720
I'm sorry if I got the details wrong,

2718
02:22:52.020 --> 02:22:54.930
but I think Brian Collin told me head kicked somebody.

2719
02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:57.510
Maybe if somebody else called me,
I tried to put myself in those scenarios.

2720
02:22:57.511 --> 02:22:59.070
You know,
I'm just even the around the element of that.
I mean,

2721
02:22:59.071 --> 02:23:01.550
if you're beating someone up on the street and you said do a habit,
what else?

2722
02:23:01.740 --> 02:23:05.730
Huge fucking mistake out of all the people to fuck with on a dock.

2723
02:23:05.970 --> 02:23:10.230
You look at this skinny dude with a cowboy hat,
man,

2724
02:23:10.500 --> 02:23:14.220
fuck you and your fucking boat faggot and next thing you know

2725
02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:17.820
man,
that shit,
it bounces off the side here.

2726
02:23:17.930 --> 02:23:20.550
We're going to do something pretty bad too.
It's,
he's pretty cool,
dude.

2727
02:23:20.840 --> 02:23:21.900
He had pissed him off pretty bad,

2728
02:23:21.940 --> 02:23:26.460
but this is all a lot of Douche bags up for sure.
It's very unfortunate.

2729
02:23:26.850 --> 02:23:29.640
It's really hard to develop a human being.

2730
02:23:29.641 --> 02:23:34.560
I think you know that and I know that it's how much it's changed me.
You bullet.

2731
02:23:34.650 --> 02:23:37.770
It absolutely does,
right?
I've had to hold this guy back a couple of times,

2732
02:23:37.771 --> 02:23:42.570
you know what I mean?
He's almost always get into fights.
Holy Do,
oh,
anywhere.

2733
02:23:43.250 --> 02:23:43.560
It was just,

2734
02:23:43.560 --> 02:23:46.110
I just feel people should respect one another and help each other out and when

2735
02:23:46.111 --> 02:23:48.840
it doesn't happen,
I'm just like,
this guy's kind of a dick face.

2736
02:23:48.850 --> 02:23:52.770
Then I'll speak up about it and then people get mad sometimes.
Yeah.

2737
02:23:52.830 --> 02:23:55.020
Well there's a lot of Dick faces out there and they don't like to hear that.

2738
02:23:55.470 --> 02:23:58.580
People don't like to be criticized.
It's hard.
Did someone calls you a,

2739
02:23:58.940 --> 02:24:03.600
they may be a dick face that lady and you're like,
yeah,
you're right.
You know,

2740
02:24:03.601 --> 02:24:08.430
it's fucking hard.
It's like admitting you know something you know about Rod's,

2741
02:24:08.550 --> 02:24:10.860
it's like,
it's like so many things like being wrong sucks.

2742
02:24:10.890 --> 02:24:12.880
People don't like being wrong.
So the argue,

2743
02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:17.070
like there's a guy named Michael Shermer is his famous skeptic who has this very

2744
02:24:17.071 --> 02:24:20.680
interesting quote about smart people defending dumb ideas.
And it,

2745
02:24:20.690 --> 02:24:21.421
the smart people,

2746
02:24:21.421 --> 02:24:24.150
there's a lot of very intelligent people that believe really stupid things.

2747
02:24:24.330 --> 02:24:27.360
And the reason being is that they're smart enough to convince themselves that

2748
02:24:27.361 --> 02:24:30.420
they're right.
Okay.
Yeah.
And this smart enough to defend that stupid thing.

2749
02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:35.220
And it's kind of an interesting point of view,
but it makes sense.

2750
02:24:35.250 --> 02:24:38.850
It's fucking hard for people to say they're wrong.
So as something that's good,

2751
02:24:38.851 --> 02:24:40.530
uh,
a good talent for an athlete as well,

2752
02:24:40.740 --> 02:24:43.770
whether you have the skills or not believe that you have the skills to win the

2753
02:24:43.771 --> 02:24:45.540
fight to win the world title,
to put yourself through that.

2754
02:24:45.630 --> 02:24:47.640
When I think also as a fighter,

2755
02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:51.300
it's super important to be absolutely objective about your skillset.
You can't,

2756
02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:54.690
like we were talking about observing fights and watching fights and you have to

2757
02:24:54.691 --> 02:24:57.960
be objective,
yet you can't say,
you know,
hey,
I'm watching Tj Dillashaw.

2758
02:24:57.961 --> 02:25:01.110
I love that dude.
So I'm looking at him in a way that's not,

2759
02:25:01.140 --> 02:25:03.030
I'm just looking at everything's perfect,
it's beautiful.

2760
02:25:03.180 --> 02:25:06.930
I'm just loving watching him win,
Eh,
that's not the right way to do it.

2761
02:25:06.931 --> 02:25:09.270
And you know that.
So you'd have to step back and you,
okay,
is there,

2762
02:25:09.330 --> 02:25:12.180
what is he doing wrong and how do I get my,

2763
02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:15.490
my friendship out of the way and then look at this subjectively.
That's why,

2764
02:25:15.500 --> 02:25:18.060
you know,
I do have the fighters watch the film.
I am abundant Colorado.

2765
02:25:18.061 --> 02:25:20.770
Mike Tempo watches the film and it actually kind of happened by accident.

2766
02:25:20.790 --> 02:25:24.070
Said I watched the film,
I'll make notes.
And then the same fight again

2767
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:27.370
<v 2>while I was high and it realized that I made notes.
So I made notes again.</v>

2768
02:25:27.580 --> 02:25:30.010
And then I looked at the notes.
I had two sets of notes.
One.

2769
02:25:30.011 --> 02:25:33.010
I remember being high and one I remember not being high and realized there was a

2770
02:25:33.011 --> 02:25:33.550
difference.

2771
02:25:33.550 --> 02:25:36.270
Now was there a difference because they just watch it the second time or the

2772
02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:39.010
third time or whatever time it was or was the difference because of wheat.

2773
02:25:39.250 --> 02:25:41.110
So I was like,
well fuck man,
maybe there's something to this.

2774
02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:44.280
So I started watching the fights while sober walls,
Highland school,

2775
02:25:44.290 --> 02:25:47.320
fuck man on sponsors me,
it ticks him off for brain ticks.

2776
02:25:47.321 --> 02:25:50.170
My friend watched it again,
just to compare notes just to make sure it is.

2777
02:25:50.171 --> 02:25:52.210
I mean I want to make sure I'm making the best decisions for them.

2778
02:25:52.290 --> 02:25:55.380
<v 1>Can you also make this,
whether you're awake or whether you're tired?</v>

2779
02:25:56.260 --> 02:25:59.640
Many elements that could change my view,
my perspective on that particular fight,

2780
02:25:59.641 --> 02:26:01.740
everything.
Right.
Whether you enjoy a song,

2781
02:26:01.870 --> 02:26:03.990
like you have to be in the right mood for the right kind of stuff.

2782
02:26:03.991 --> 02:26:06.930
There's a lot of different kinds of music that I'm sure we all like you were

2783
02:26:06.940 --> 02:26:10.110
looking at.
Yeah.
It's like it's not even a good,

2784
02:26:10.140 --> 02:26:13.770
it's like now's a good time for that.
Like sometimes I don't wanna watch fights.

2785
02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:18.150
Sometimes I want to watch a fucking curbing enthusiasm.
Hey,

2786
02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:21.720
<v 2>sometimes I'll leave a fuck.</v>

2787
02:26:21.870 --> 02:26:25.380
He's like talking about professionals and split second opening with this fuck

2788
02:26:26.540 --> 02:26:27.750
they got to really be on your toe.

2789
02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:31.680
One thing I do believe weed has a lot of benefits to it and I started because I

2790
02:26:31.681 --> 02:26:34.500
had was getting nature injuries and I didn't want to actually take the pain

2791
02:26:34.501 --> 02:26:37.220
pills I was being prescribed for my surgeries.
So that's what I started,
you know,

2792
02:26:37.290 --> 02:26:39.870
investigating weed and marijuana and I would help that to calm me down.

2793
02:26:39.970 --> 02:26:41.560
<v 1>I want her to talk to you about that.
Yes,</v>

2794
02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:44.380
because that's another issue that I think is really important.
The good dogs,

2795
02:26:44.381 --> 02:26:47.530
I keep hearing about fighters that are having problems with payment.

2796
02:26:47.990 --> 02:26:50.600
<v 2>I think a hundred percent people are just thinking,
oh,
I had back to back,</v>

2797
02:26:50.601 --> 02:26:53.990
major fucking surgeries lined up and then I broke my job or my ankle tore up my

2798
02:26:53.991 --> 02:26:56.690
knee.
I had my neck surgery,
I had like a couple of good ones,

2799
02:26:56.691 --> 02:27:00.500
woke my hand a couple of times.
So I've had multiple fucking surgeries.
One here.

2800
02:27:00.501 --> 02:27:03.500
A good one actually it's this long time ago is when bosses training for Kendall,

2801
02:27:03.560 --> 02:27:05.590
Kevin Randleman.
He came to Colorado for health,

2802
02:27:05.591 --> 02:27:08.530
the two training and that was one of his main sparring partners and I'm like I'm

2803
02:27:08.531 --> 02:27:12.480
not one one 55 we were just scrapping it.

2804
02:27:12.890 --> 02:27:13.910
I'm trading with my other guy.

2805
02:27:13.940 --> 02:27:16.820
My other buddy killed Tucker Komatsu who's a Japanese kitchen,

2806
02:27:16.850 --> 02:27:19.790
kitchen karate black belt and I was sparring.

2807
02:27:19.791 --> 02:27:22.850
I threw around kicking he to a front kick while it's in the round kick.

2808
02:27:23.390 --> 02:27:27.950
The issue was I was not wearing my cup.
Oh my right ball actually broke.

2809
02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:31.580
So I had my buddy Oscar Martinez throw me in the car.
I didn't go down on this.

2810
02:27:31.590 --> 02:27:34.040
I still stood my ground.
I got in the car,

2811
02:27:34.041 --> 02:27:37.520
I'm having my buddy Oscar take me like going opposite directions of one ways and

2812
02:27:37.521 --> 02:27:40.040
stuff and got me to the hospital and they did like an emergency or emergency

2813
02:27:40.041 --> 02:27:43.460
surgery.
So lesson learned here.
Where a cup gentlemen,

2814
02:27:44.010 --> 02:27:45.110
I know what I do is I take it,

2815
02:27:45.111 --> 02:27:47.900
you were talking about the cup issue on stuff and the fights.
I take a one,

2816
02:27:47.901 --> 02:27:51.320
it was tie cups is still tie cup and they put that in a regular envelope,

2817
02:27:51.321 --> 02:27:54.710
like a shock doctor envelope cup and just put that on and I put tight shorts

2818
02:27:54.711 --> 02:27:58.540
over that,
the hold it in place,
the shorts that warm my Kim,

2819
02:27:58.550 --> 02:28:01.370
the cage fight would say little boss on them.
I still wore those for every fight,

2820
02:28:01.371 --> 02:28:03.770
kickboxing and MMA.
He was like my lucky shorts.

2821
02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:07.370
So I put my still cup in my shock doctor envelope and then put that on and then

2822
02:28:07.371 --> 02:28:09.850
have my pet shorts over that and then in my fight shorts.
So it's what I always,

2823
02:28:10.070 --> 02:28:13.650
<v 1>she ever tried diamond dude,
they're awesome.
They're awesome diamonds.
Incredible.</v>

2824
02:28:13.820 --> 02:28:18.380
And they just released a new improved version of it for folks who never heard of

2825
02:28:18.381 --> 02:28:22.190
it.
If you're,
if you're doing Jujitsu or anything,
I seriously this they,
it's

2826
02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:26.660
<v 0>a compression short that they have this really well designed cop that fits in</v>

2827
02:28:26.810 --> 02:28:29.480
this videos on the website of the dude take and tie kicks,
then nuts.

2828
02:28:29.690 --> 02:28:32.500
And so really?
Yeah.
For me it's a,

2829
02:28:32.501 --> 02:28:34.700
it's a made a huge difference in Jujitsu.

2830
02:28:34.850 --> 02:28:36.920
It took my boss completely out of the equation.
Yeah.

2831
02:28:36.921 --> 02:28:40.070
You can't even finish armors if you're not wearing a cup most of the time.
Yeah,

2832
02:28:40.110 --> 02:28:41.540
they fucking hurts.
Yeah,
that's true.

2833
02:28:41.580 --> 02:28:42.390
<v 2>So one of the things,</v>

2834
02:28:42.390 --> 02:28:45.300
I started getting major injuries and then getting surgeries and I didn't want to

2835
02:28:45.301 --> 02:28:48.330
take the pain pills,
although I did take some of them and I had broke my jaw.

2836
02:28:48.450 --> 02:28:51.390
I was taking a liquid,
some kind of liquid pain pill.
I know what it was,

2837
02:28:51.570 --> 02:28:53.310
but that's what started my venture in the wheat.

2838
02:28:53.460 --> 02:28:55.380
So it was just to get through the night so I could sleep.

2839
02:28:55.680 --> 02:28:57.800
But it does fuck in my memory man.

2840
02:28:57.810 --> 02:29:00.450
Like I was having like the next day have an issue like holding combinations for

2841
02:29:00.451 --> 02:29:02.880
these guys and stuff and just not remembering dates and stuff.

2842
02:29:02.881 --> 02:29:04.470
So it did fuck with me personally.

2843
02:29:04.471 --> 02:29:07.500
I call it my memory and I don't think it's for everybody cause I'm very,

2844
02:29:07.800 --> 02:29:10.910
very high strong and tried to get shit done all it not try and get shit done on

2845
02:29:10.980 --> 02:29:12.000
all the fucking time.

2846
02:29:12.240 --> 02:29:15.990
So I think if somebody always already can predisposed to be a slight bit lazy,

2847
02:29:16.140 --> 02:29:18.470
this is not for you.
100% hey,
like we,
it's not free.
Right.

2848
02:29:18.490 --> 02:29:20.540
<v 3>I mean it affects him differently though.
Like he'll,
he'll,</v>

2849
02:29:21.570 --> 02:29:26.260
he can enjoy five time.
Yeah.
I'm not kidding you.
It does it sometimes.
Yeah Dude,

2850
02:29:26.261 --> 02:29:27.250
it's like a reverse effect.

2851
02:29:27.251 --> 02:29:30.090
Like most people get stoned though the sit on the couch so get hungry,

2852
02:29:30.110 --> 02:29:31.840
not want to go start doing combos and shit.

2853
02:29:32.110 --> 02:29:35.770
This guy's shadow boxing and really tight.
But you know what?
I figured

2854
02:29:35.860 --> 02:29:37.810
<v 0>things out about my body when I'm high.</v>

2855
02:29:37.900 --> 02:29:41.580
I figured out certain stretches that I need.
Like I've,
I feel like I'll be like,

2856
02:29:41.650 --> 02:29:44.590
Ooh,
you know what?
I'm tight right here.
Look I've,
I've figured shit out.

2857
02:29:44.591 --> 02:29:47.680
And then as you're like,
you're feeling your body more,
I'd like,
you know what?

2858
02:29:47.710 --> 02:29:50.590
I got to incorporate that more.
And then like certain techniques,

2859
02:29:50.591 --> 02:29:51.640
like kicking techniques,

2860
02:29:51.641 --> 02:29:55.570
like I've gone over them high and I like feel the weight transfer better because

2861
02:29:55.571 --> 02:29:58.270
you know how like when you shit in a bag,
when you,
when you,

2862
02:29:58.271 --> 02:30:02.260
when you really whip your hip into it,
there's certain times you get it perfect.

2863
02:30:02.261 --> 02:30:04.900
And there's certain times where it's a little off,
a little weird,

2864
02:30:05.050 --> 02:30:08.460
but then there's times when you just feel it and you just shoot.

2865
02:30:08.900 --> 02:30:09.733
You just got that one.

2866
02:30:10.250 --> 02:30:11.080
<v 3>Yeah,
it felt different.</v>

2867
02:30:11.080 --> 02:30:16.080
I felt that you today you can fucking kids were dickens kicks in with awesome.

2868
02:30:16.140 --> 02:30:18.850
We're doing a like some basic footwork drills and stuff and it's not what you

2869
02:30:18.851 --> 02:30:22.360
typically would do for you personally.
So we get to play a girl was like,

2870
02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:26.800
can we do some kicks?
All right,
fucking while.
I'm like,
Holy Shit,

2871
02:30:26.801 --> 02:30:29.030
why am I say fuck you couldn't fricking kicked me.

2872
02:30:29.031 --> 02:30:31.560
And I already know this from like this making videos and stuff that I got it.

2873
02:30:31.561 --> 02:30:31.870
I got it.

2874
02:30:31.870 --> 02:30:36.040
<v 2>Video also demonstrating the,
the,
the sponge cake.
So that was,
that was awesome.</v>

2875
02:30:36.041 --> 02:30:36.850
Thanks man.

2876
02:30:36.850 --> 02:30:39.790
<v 0>Please.
Thank you man.
It was for fun.
But yeah,
I've been doing,</v>

2877
02:30:39.791 --> 02:30:40.624
I've been kicking shit.

2878
02:30:40.750 --> 02:30:43.210
<v 3>Yeah,
it was a big fucking awesome.</v>

2879
02:30:43.560 --> 02:30:45.430
You could fucking kick your an athlete for sure.

2880
02:30:45.490 --> 02:30:47.970
<v 0>Well it's just that spot my body developed doing that.
I mean I didn't,</v>

2881
02:30:48.250 --> 02:30:51.610
I was a boy when I learned how to kick so I might,
I was all like,
yeah,

2882
02:30:51.640 --> 02:30:53.380
that's what I was talking about.
Like the dexterity,

2883
02:30:53.620 --> 02:30:55.450
the ability to move your body and assurance.

2884
02:30:56.770 --> 02:30:59.580
<v 3>You are an amazing kicker,
but you are having a hard time.</v>

2885
02:30:59.581 --> 02:31:03.090
Like when I was trying to show you acts kicks or I was trying to spin kicks.
Yep.

2886
02:31:03.180 --> 02:31:04.950
It's an awkward way for you to move.

2887
02:31:05.130 --> 02:31:09.720
That's my body's done that since I was a child.
Ballet Dwayne Bang.

2888
02:31:09.870 --> 02:31:11.850
If he's laying down and don't start slapping,

2889
02:31:11.851 --> 02:31:16.851
I mean not a hard like [inaudible] army.

2890
02:31:18.870 --> 02:31:20.010
So cool man.
I come already

2891
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:21.710
<v 1>training him to do what he wants.
You know,</v>

2892
02:31:22.050 --> 02:31:24.830
people always asking me is dwindling going to be a fighter.
I lived way Megan.

2893
02:31:24.850 --> 02:31:27.070
I'm like,
if you choose the two,
whatever's passion is going to be,
I'm like,

2894
02:31:27.071 --> 02:31:29.930
I'm going to support him.
He tap dances.
That's good.
That's beautiful.
I see.

2895
02:31:29.940 --> 02:31:33.030
Even if he's going to be best,
I would have had if I had a gay son,

2896
02:31:33.031 --> 02:31:34.020
as long as he was happy,

2897
02:31:34.021 --> 02:31:39.021
I would way rather have a gay happy song than a dead daughter or depressed

2898
02:31:39.541 --> 02:31:42.150
straight son or wa happy.

2899
02:31:42.151 --> 02:31:45.030
So you can really give a fuck about like if your kid,

2900
02:31:45.031 --> 02:31:48.360
like I joke around about my daughter being a lesbian and my wife gets upset.

2901
02:31:48.520 --> 02:31:52.560
It's like,
don't say that.
I go,
why?
I go,
what if she likes Batman?

2902
02:31:52.750 --> 02:31:55.860
She likes wrestling.
She wrestles all the time.
She's super aggressive.

2903
02:31:56.700 --> 02:32:00.630
Two daughters,
one of them is like really very girly and a the other one,

2904
02:32:00.631 --> 02:32:05.430
I have a 17 year old as well,
but he's much more creative and artistic.

2905
02:32:05.710 --> 02:32:09.450
That's my daughter.
The youngest one is a fucking brute man.

2906
02:32:09.570 --> 02:32:14.270
She's hyper aggressive.
She like leaps off the bed and like she takes my back,

2907
02:32:14.300 --> 02:32:18.660
right?
And she's three and I'm like,
she's a lesbian and my wife's like,

2908
02:32:18.661 --> 02:32:23.170
stop it.
But I'll be like,
look,
if you,
if you love lesbians,
okay,
I,
I,

2909
02:32:23.410 --> 02:32:25.320
I have zero problem with people being gay.

2910
02:32:25.380 --> 02:32:29.670
So why would I care and lesbian like it's really kind of like not even

2911
02:32:29.680 --> 02:32:32.340
criticizing society,
little by assholes,

2912
02:32:32.341 --> 02:32:34.410
but it's not like being a gay man when you get beat up.

2913
02:32:34.411 --> 02:32:37.440
Who gets beat up for being a lesbian does.
I mean I'm sure someone has been,

2914
02:32:37.441 --> 02:32:40.180
so I apologize if you have fuck fucking household,

2915
02:32:42.060 --> 02:32:45.780
but the reality is even straight guys love lesbians.
You know,

2916
02:32:45.781 --> 02:32:48.810
everybody loves lesbians.
Lesbians can kiss in public.
Nobody gives a shit.

2917
02:32:48.811 --> 02:32:52.260
They go,
whoa.
You know it's a few country girls like and like it damaged.

2918
02:32:53.940 --> 02:32:57.000
You can't tell she's a lesbian this early.
That's far as I can.

2919
02:32:57.001 --> 02:33:00.330
I'm just joking dude.
But it's a lot of shit.
I say that's not true.

2920
02:33:00.331 --> 02:33:03.320
You understand that.
You say it a lot though.
You don't say it in front of herb.

2921
02:33:03.340 --> 02:33:06.490
You fire like specific cheeses.

2922
02:33:06.820 --> 02:33:10.400
He's just telling her just you're going to be a lesbian.
You're going to be,

2923
02:33:10.550 --> 02:33:13.740
he loves mermaids and flowers.
It's a joke.

2924
02:33:13.770 --> 02:33:15.630
I'm very curious to see what my children were going to,

2925
02:33:15.690 --> 02:33:17.280
they're going to turn it to become or what they,

2926
02:33:17.470 --> 02:33:20.010
what they are now and if they're going to have expressed that as an adult,

2927
02:33:20.130 --> 02:33:22.040
like I'm pretty sure it loads when it makes going to be a fighter.

2928
02:33:22.050 --> 02:33:24.810
He's already had his gloves and,
and was training in the gym all the time.

2929
02:33:24.811 --> 02:33:27.510
Him and Tj are best buddies.
He knows that.
He knows favor.

2930
02:33:27.510 --> 02:33:31.620
He goes paper and Tj and buckles and so he knows the fighters of the Jimmy

2931
02:33:31.620 --> 02:33:33.800
Lesbian at the gym.
He loves the martial arts.
He's got his own little mouthpiece.

2932
02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:37.950
He's a little bit OCD bus things already.
You know,
from my daughter,

2933
02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:41.370
my daughter at j,
she's an artist.
She's just drawing and coloring all the time.

2934
02:33:41.371 --> 02:33:43.790
So that's,
as I tell her,
we a,
we're all artists,
you know,
she's,

2935
02:33:44.430 --> 02:33:47.280
we're martial artists and she's an actual artist,
so,
you know,
it's good.

2936
02:33:47.281 --> 02:33:49.790
I want to,
hopefully when they get older they can express,

2937
02:33:49.791 --> 02:33:52.620
it can be who they want to be and I'd be stuck in some shitty job that that's

2938
02:33:52.621 --> 02:33:54.850
her unhappy with.
Yeah.
That's why I'm always fucking happy with,

2939
02:33:54.890 --> 02:33:57.860
I get to basically do what I want every day.
You know,

2940
02:33:57.870 --> 02:34:00.160
finding something that you can express yourself in what?

2941
02:34:00.180 --> 02:34:04.020
And it's whatever you gravitate towards.
If it's fucking flower arrangements,

2942
02:34:04.050 --> 02:34:05.640
I mean,
whatever the fuck it is,
man.

2943
02:34:05.790 --> 02:34:08.730
I don't know what makes someone like a certain kind of music.

2944
02:34:08.731 --> 02:34:12.900
Like I don't like the grateful dead man.
I,
I don't,
I've tried.
I don't like it.

2945
02:34:12.930 --> 02:34:15.450
It doesn't mean I hate people.
I love a lot,
lot of love,

2946
02:34:15.451 --> 02:34:19.150
a lot of friends who love the grateful dead.
That's fine,
but it's for whatever.

2947
02:34:19.210 --> 02:34:22.420
It doesn't fucking work with me.
You know,
like,
I like Dwight Yoakam.

2948
02:34:22.640 --> 02:34:26.350
I'm like a lot of shit.
If you,
Fran of the dental is a friend of mine,

2949
02:34:26.650 --> 02:34:27.850
I'll be high.
Um,

2950
02:34:27.910 --> 02:34:31.240
they actually played that on the helicopter ride that I went on in Maui and I

2951
02:34:31.241 --> 02:34:34.850
was like,
are you doing this to me?
Fuck,
that was good.

2952
02:34:34.880 --> 02:34:38.680
I was actually a podcast fan,
so shout out to our driver who was kind of weird.

2953
02:34:38.710 --> 02:34:39.910
How about a podcast fan?

2954
02:34:39.970 --> 02:34:44.770
Flies around and Allison talk about the podcast at the helicopter.
I was awesome.

2955
02:34:44.771 --> 02:34:48.910
The,
oh it's in say Maui.
We were,

2956
02:34:48.911 --> 02:34:52.210
I was in Maui last week.
That's why there was no a podcast.
But uh,

2957
02:34:52.330 --> 02:34:53.680
me and my family went on a,

2958
02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:58.900
a flight on a helicopter over Malakai and Malakai only has like a couple

2959
02:34:58.900 --> 02:35:01.690
thousand people on the whole island.
And a lot of them are like campers.

2960
02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:04.360
They just go there and camp cause they can live there for free and they live off

2961
02:35:04.361 --> 02:35:04.870
the land.

2962
02:35:04.870 --> 02:35:08.980
They fish and they hunt and there's this fresh guava and mangoes and all these

2963
02:35:08.981 --> 02:35:12.620
different plants are just growing there.
And they hunt,
excuse me,

2964
02:35:12.621 --> 02:35:16.330
how wild pigs and there's wild sheep and all these sorts of different animals

2965
02:35:16.331 --> 02:35:20.780
that you can like the hunt and fish and eat fresh fruits everywhere.

2966
02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:25.270
And apparently people go there and they take a boat and they just stay there for

2967
02:35:25.271 --> 02:35:27.190
months and months at a time.
And it's legal.

2968
02:35:27.240 --> 02:35:30.520
Well I should have an affiliate in Hawaii so hopefully I get to go there and a

2969
02:35:30.580 --> 02:35:33.400
good to my seminar,
Mike Vickers.
So I got,
I feel like talk throughout the U.

2970
02:35:33.401 --> 02:35:36.080
It's actually have an affiliate in Thailand also.
So that's,

2971
02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:41.960
that's a photo that I took from a on my incident when we were flying up or

2972
02:35:42.150 --> 02:35:47.050
malice.
Right.
Tahanto almost.
Yeah,
that's the way,
like different islands.

2973
02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:50.380
That was,
I think,
I'm pretty sure that was when we were,
we got to Malakai.

2974
02:35:50.590 --> 02:35:53.980
We flew over Maui and then we went to Malakai.
And this is,
this is in Maui.

2975
02:35:54.220 --> 02:35:58.660
This is um,
one of the craters that you fly over.
It's fucking insane.

2976
02:35:58.990 --> 02:36:02.890
It's insane because like Hawaii looks incredibly beautiful from the ground.

2977
02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:05.920
You know,
you just get out of your car and you're like,
wow,
it was amazing.

2978
02:36:06.130 --> 02:36:08.830
But when you're above it and you realize how weird it is,

2979
02:36:09.130 --> 02:36:11.530
like did this thing just popped up out of them,

2980
02:36:11.531 --> 02:36:14.420
but ocean and that really what it is,
the volcano,

2981
02:36:14.620 --> 02:36:18.310
it's like one of the biggest mountain in the world by volume.

2982
02:36:18.310 --> 02:36:21.700
It just happens to be in the middle of the ocean and it's just fucking volcano.

2983
02:36:21.701 --> 02:36:26.701
Just jot it out in the middle of the 5,000 miles to five hours by plane from

2984
02:36:26.711 --> 02:36:31.060
everywhere.
Like there's nowhere to go,
like you eat and he's crazy.
Polynesian.

2985
02:36:31.090 --> 02:36:35.770
Motherfuckers got there on boats.
Crazy.
That's why they're so tough.
Gangster.

2986
02:36:35.790 --> 02:36:40.320
Yeah,
it's probably just part of it for sure.
They got their 1500 years ago,
man.

2987
02:36:40.420 --> 02:36:42.340
Wow.
1500 years ago.

2988
02:36:42.341 --> 02:36:44.740
These fucking guys got there by bus and they did it more than once.

2989
02:36:44.800 --> 02:36:49.800
They knew how to navigate the ocean back then 1500 fucking years ago and they

2990
02:36:51.001 --> 02:36:52.510
made these boats,
dude,

2991
02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:56.200
they have like there's a an aquarium and Maui where you can go see the boats

2992
02:36:56.201 --> 02:37:01.050
that they created.
Like they have a replica of them.
It's a fucking log.
Wow.

2993
02:37:01.051 --> 02:37:02.370
Fucking law.

2994
02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:07.030
It's a hollowed out logs and they had like a like gnats that they created that

2995
02:37:07.031 --> 02:37:10.000
they made themselves and they would just,
and they would take a year,

2996
02:37:10.030 --> 02:37:13.750
I took a year to make a fucking net and they would like set these nets and just

2997
02:37:13.751 --> 02:37:17.210
just go out there and hope that they would catch enough fish to keep their

2998
02:37:17.211 --> 02:37:20.150
fucking children alive.
Because it took you a year to build that knit,

2999
02:37:21.380 --> 02:37:24.800
go 1500 miles.
By canoe.
I mean,

3000
02:37:24.801 --> 02:37:28.340
could you even cover 10 miles a day?
How many miles are you covering?

3001
02:37:28.341 --> 02:37:31.910
A day canoeing.
Yeah.
What do you think?
How much you think,

3002
02:37:32.600 --> 02:37:36.340
forget the place in Ohio used to be,
I think like seven.
I mean she should be,

3003
02:37:36.500 --> 02:37:38.480
you should be able to canoe more than you can walk.

3004
02:37:38.481 --> 02:37:42.430
And I just last last five days,
walked 120 miles up in the rubies,
right?

3005
02:37:42.431 --> 02:37:45.770
That's right.
He was just saying that you're deer hunting experience.
So how many,

3006
02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:48.380
how many miles do you think you can canoe?
Should we say?

3007
02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:50.870
If you're really going gangster a hundred miles a day,

3008
02:37:52.940 --> 02:37:56.070
I'm not quite sure what it's going to be.
Tired.
I mean,
do you mean touch it?

3009
02:37:56.071 --> 02:37:59.220
It's like a boat or a bike.
Streambed downstream when dry,

3010
02:37:59.230 --> 02:38:01.910
you've got to deal with those.
So let's say best case scenario,

3011
02:38:01.911 --> 02:38:04.670
you're going gangster and while you're catching fish and feeding your family,

3012
02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.120
you're going a hundred miles a day.
Wow.

3013
02:38:07.170 --> 02:38:10.640
It'll take you 15 fucking days to get all the way out there in the middle of the

3014
02:38:10.641 --> 02:38:11.450
ocean and fun home.

3015
02:38:11.450 --> 02:38:14.420
<v 2>Then how many calories would you need to do that as well and then make it,
oh</v>

3016
02:38:15.980 --> 02:38:18.020
great.
A couple of key factors in that

3017
02:38:18.250 --> 02:38:23.170
<v 1>being sane,
15 days at gangster paddling.
I did five days of it.</v>

3018
02:38:23.380 --> 02:38:27.200
It's like your work,
go hunt with a Steve Rinella for that show meter.

3019
02:38:27.220 --> 02:38:31.090
And we went down the Missouri and we paddled like most of the way.

3020
02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:35.110
Oh it was fucking,
it was a brutal workout.
Great.
Like your shoulders get sore,

3021
02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:38.380
you can,
you could treat it as a workout and really get gangster with it.

3022
02:38:38.381 --> 02:38:41.710
And you know,
really felt like I was treating it as a workout.
I was like,

3023
02:38:41.711 --> 02:38:45.100
I'm just not going to like just paddle our way and enjoy the scenery.
I was like,

3024
02:38:45.101 --> 02:38:47.260
I'm not working out why I'm here,
so let's get a workout in.

3025
02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:49.750
So just like made it a race.
Brian Cowen was

3026
02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:52.830
rushing that full.
Yeah,

3027
02:38:53.020 --> 02:38:57.810
<v 2>yeah.
I'm going to win this shit.
Yeah.</v>

3028
02:38:58.020 --> 02:38:58.853
That's one thing I was,

3029
02:38:58.890 --> 02:39:02.670
the marijuana helped me to relax and we'll be looking at things so many

3030
02:39:02.671 --> 02:39:05.100
different,
you know,
look at things so differently now.
Well not now.

3031
02:39:05.101 --> 02:39:06.420
I actually stopped weed for a while now.

3032
02:39:06.421 --> 02:39:10.320
So it was kind of debating on if I was taking too much or what strand or weapon.

3033
02:39:10.330 --> 02:39:12.660
You know,
it definitely allowed me to appreciate life.

3034
02:39:12.661 --> 02:39:15.310
We're able to relax and you know,
play with the kids a bit more and you know,

3035
02:39:15.370 --> 02:39:17.640
food tastes better,
drinks taste better.
I can relax.

3036
02:39:17.641 --> 02:39:20.160
I'm going to OCD and about shit that I can't control right now.

3037
02:39:20.310 --> 02:39:23.390
So you know how to clean neat it possibly.
You know what man,

3038
02:39:23.391 --> 02:39:24.600
if I'd say the line to the fucking my memory,

3039
02:39:24.601 --> 02:39:27.420
you know what I'm holding myths with these guys and he's Today's modern day

3040
02:39:27.421 --> 02:39:30.510
fucking inches right here.
So if I miss them,
they punched me in the face,

3041
02:39:30.511 --> 02:39:31.530
you know,
that's going to be an issue.

3042
02:39:31.710 --> 02:39:34.350
So I gotta be on point with things for sure.
Even though I tell the guys,

3043
02:39:34.440 --> 02:39:36.060
even if I do all the myths on the wrong side,

3044
02:39:36.180 --> 02:39:38.730
the striker needs to control their strike and that's just the way it has to be.

3045
02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.970
So,
um,
you know,
it's just one of those things,
but I won't tell him that for them.

3046
02:39:42.060 --> 02:39:46.170
I'm a big Fan of light edibles.
Lycos edibles.

3047
02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:48.630
That's what I've been doing lately.
How many milligrams?
Talking crazy.

3048
02:39:49.020 --> 02:39:51.930
See that's the problem man.
You bought these fucking cookies from these assholes,

3049
02:39:51.931 --> 02:39:55.530
you don't know what to call it.
Colorado.
Colorado is pretty consistent on point.

3050
02:39:55.900 --> 02:39:56.600
<v 1>Yeah.
Well it,</v>

3051
02:39:56.600 --> 02:40:00.280
it's consistent and on point with like certain shit like go to la speed weed.

3052
02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:03.790
They have these gummy bears.
You can guarantee where are you ready?
My speed.

3053
02:40:03.791 --> 02:40:04.780
We'd LASP wheeze.

3054
02:40:04.781 --> 02:40:07.450
Gummy bears have a spa and if you know it and you're used to it,

3055
02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:08.890
you might want to bite one in half.

3056
02:40:08.891 --> 02:40:12.040
You might want to eat the whole one based on so many other things other than

3057
02:40:12.041 --> 02:40:15.960
just the content.
How much did you eat your hydration levels?
Edge,

3058
02:40:15.961 --> 02:40:17.900
which was like so many.
I fit factors that yours?

3059
02:40:17.910 --> 02:40:22.410
No way to personal tolerance to personal time.
If you eat it a lot,

3060
02:40:22.440 --> 02:40:24.870
you can do a lot more than a person who doesn't.

3061
02:40:24.900 --> 02:40:26.870
What would you think of this as far as marijuana?
You think that's for now?

3062
02:40:27.330 --> 02:40:29.220
I mean like you're gonna say no,
of course.
Cause that's the correct answer.

3063
02:40:29.221 --> 02:40:30.740
But it's not for everybody like send out,

3064
02:40:30.750 --> 02:40:33.110
which shouldn't be fucking smoking week.
Some people are just dumb fucks you.

3065
02:40:33.170 --> 02:40:35.370
And I'm not the smartest guy either.
I'm not,
you know,
like I'm,
I'm,

3066
02:40:35.610 --> 02:40:37.830
I went to high school and that was it.
Like no college education.

3067
02:40:37.831 --> 02:40:40.770
But I definitely be able to pursue what I felt was quiz correct for me and my

3068
02:40:40.771 --> 02:40:43.680
path being a wash.
Laundry.
You love what you do.
I fucking love what I do.

3069
02:40:43.900 --> 02:40:45.120
How many times have I not said that?

3070
02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:50.790
I think it's nothing's for everybody.
The orange juices for everybody.
Yeah.

3071
02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:54.760
So I think that it means to be a test.
You know,
sweets aren't shoot peanuts is

3072
02:40:56.580 --> 02:40:59.140
people might like orange juice not be able to fucking tolerate it either.

3073
02:40:59.141 --> 02:41:02.070
Exactly.
So that's problem.
I give her an apple juice.
She goes crazy.
She loves it.

3074
02:41:02.130 --> 02:41:05.150
Yeah.
Puts users their favorite porn.
She sucks.
Fucking looks at you.

3075
02:41:05.170 --> 02:41:09.090
Try to figure a shit sandwich.
Yeah.
Look,
it's not for everybody.
Coconuts enough.

3076
02:41:09.091 --> 02:41:11.910
I love coconut water.
I've given it to people and they want to throw up.

3077
02:41:12.060 --> 02:41:14.760
So that's going to be,
that's got to be a thing as far as you know,
legalizing it,

3078
02:41:14.761 --> 02:41:16.770
you know,
for sure.
I think people should be able to make their own decisions.

3079
02:41:16.771 --> 02:41:18.120
But man,
you know there are,

3080
02:41:18.121 --> 02:41:20.450
there are reasons for it for rules and guidelines and such.

3081
02:41:20.451 --> 02:41:23.160
Cause some people just need to be told what to do and what not to do.

3082
02:41:23.800 --> 02:41:27.210
I don't agree with that.
I don't think people are going to run out in guidelines.

3083
02:41:27.211 --> 02:41:30.150
I think there has to be counseling cause some people just don't fucking know

3084
02:41:30.151 --> 02:41:33.870
right or wrong.
Well I think there should be for special occasion for sure.

3085
02:41:33.980 --> 02:41:36.330
And I know sort of education.
Do we look,

3086
02:41:36.331 --> 02:41:39.630
we're dealing with very complicated issues where you're altering human

3087
02:41:39.680 --> 02:41:42.810
neurochemistry through,
through psychedelics.
Whether it's,

3088
02:41:42.850 --> 02:41:45.360
you mean people don't want to think of marijuana as a psychedelic.

3089
02:41:45.361 --> 02:41:48.810
It is without a doubt a psychoactive substance.
And if you eat it in large doses,

3090
02:41:48.811 --> 02:41:50.340
it's as psychedelic is anything.

3091
02:41:50.640 --> 02:41:54.270
If you don't believe that you're fucked because if you do take it and you,

3092
02:41:54.271 --> 02:41:57.990
you're not ready,
you're going to get an experience very unlike,
you know,

3093
02:41:58.020 --> 02:42:00.840
very unlike like a regular like chicks get high smoke a joint.

3094
02:42:01.020 --> 02:42:05.250
So I think that anything like that can fuck you up and anything that could fuck

3095
02:42:05.251 --> 02:42:07.800
you up mentally we should tread with caution.

3096
02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:10.680
And because of the fact that we don't have education,

3097
02:42:10.681 --> 02:42:13.320
we don't have centers where someone can go and they can say,

3098
02:42:13.321 --> 02:42:16.410
well just trolled environment,
you and your friends.

3099
02:42:16.411 --> 02:42:18.210
What we'd like to do is we're going to bring you in here.

3100
02:42:18.211 --> 02:42:21.270
We have a very specific level of marijuana we're going to give you and when a

3101
02:42:21.271 --> 02:42:23.100
work you up to where we think you can handle it.

3102
02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:25.830
So you could be in a comfortable,
safe environment.

3103
02:42:25.831 --> 02:42:29.070
Like have you guys gone to the marijuana on fucking treatment center?
Yeah.

3104
02:42:29.080 --> 02:42:32.880
One of the fucking is,
yeah.
It's turns out I'm good with one gummy bear.

3105
02:42:33.090 --> 02:42:36.120
One gummy bears.
Perfect.
You know,
I found out what it is,
you know,

3106
02:42:36.121 --> 02:42:39.060
we went too far one day and I started thinking about my childhood and it was a

3107
02:42:39.061 --> 02:42:41.610
little fucked up.
But I think I learned from that too.

3108
02:42:42.210 --> 02:42:46.170
But this way at least you would get an educated experience and we don't,

3109
02:42:46.180 --> 02:42:49.200
now we're like figuring it out for ourselves.
Whereas if you buy Tylenol,

3110
02:42:49.260 --> 02:42:52.080
you know what the fucking doses,
it's real simple.
It's right there on the label.

3111
02:42:52.320 --> 02:42:54.810
I take four Advils when I got a headache,
you know,

3112
02:42:54.811 --> 02:42:58.050
you know what the fuck you're supposed to take 800 milligrams.
Some people don't.

3113
02:42:58.051 --> 02:43:01.400
Some people are just retarded.
Anything can be abused.
You know,
I've,
I've,

3114
02:43:01.770 --> 02:43:04.620
I've trained too much.
Like I,
I didn't really know my reserve.

3115
02:43:04.621 --> 02:43:07.840
I was pushed too hard and broke my own body down.
Like I have low test.

3116
02:43:07.841 --> 02:43:09.900
We were talking about,
I have like,
I have my testosterone checked.

3117
02:43:09.901 --> 02:43:12.620
I was one o one o five or one or three I forgot,
like super fucking loud.

3118
02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:15.030
That's crazy.
That's just from,
you know,
from,
I understand if you're not,

3119
02:43:15.031 --> 02:43:18.070
was totally in ways that,
you know,
head trauma,
you know,
severe weight,
cutting,

3120
02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:21.430
red lining your body.
And then of course,
uh,
steroids or team to my steroids.

3121
02:43:21.430 --> 02:43:24.550
We need to,
I've got three of the four fucking symptoms right there.
Head trauma,

3122
02:43:24.700 --> 02:43:28.710
severe way cutting and red lining your body.
So and jerking off like a maniac.

3123
02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:34.070
Paul shooting off a zoo monkey on heroin.
Yeah,
that could do it too.

3124
02:43:34.071 --> 02:43:36.880
I will drain your balls,
your ball park.

3125
02:43:37.780 --> 02:43:40.510
It's the thing that's 10 minutes,
10 minutes,

3126
02:43:40.511 --> 02:43:42.860
10 minutes to turn into a Pumpkin Kale.
Nice.
Can I plug my,

3127
02:43:42.900 --> 02:43:45.190
can I plugged my affiliate real quick?
Fuck yeah.
Oh Man.
Okay.

3128
02:43:45.191 --> 02:43:48.220
So Wayne bang.com so where they can go and find [inaudible] dot com yes.

3129
02:43:48.221 --> 02:43:51.220
Then I got some affiliates.
I just didn't have my,
my buddy Alberto crane,
Burbank,

3130
02:43:51.250 --> 02:43:51.551
you know,

3131
02:43:51.551 --> 02:43:55.390
Alberta to become an affiliate and they got benched sister in Westminster,

3132
02:43:55.391 --> 02:43:59.230
Colorado.
We've got and who kept Thailand,
Mike Vickers in Hawaii.

3133
02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:01.030
Brian Boma and Yuma,
Arizona,

3134
02:44:01.180 --> 02:44:04.600
Jeff Fairbanks and Alaska and at James Henry and Radford,
Virginia.

3135
02:44:04.810 --> 02:44:07.720
I got James Johnson.
Okay.

3136
02:44:07.721 --> 02:44:10.450
What does the.com [inaudible] dot com go check it out.

3137
02:44:10.451 --> 02:44:14.740
yang.com and they have all of your affiliates up there and like you said before,

3138
02:44:14.741 --> 02:44:16.780
I think it's really interesting you,
you set up your,

3139
02:44:16.781 --> 02:44:20.290
your your structure for your lessons every week and then they poured that shit,

3140
02:44:20.291 --> 02:44:24.380
sent it out to them.
You've got to fill up their
belts and shit.

3141
02:44:24.580 --> 02:44:27.490
You don't have a ranking structure colored red,
white,
blue,
purple,
Brown,

3142
02:44:27.810 --> 02:44:29.080
black belt in Dwayne,
Bang.

3143
02:44:29.081 --> 02:44:33.310
Only one guy while the Mcdonald's and my a west coast east coast headquarters.

3144
02:44:33.430 --> 02:44:35.950
He said he's that Chris Herzog as well and they're a tough plan affiliate.

3145
02:44:36.690 --> 02:44:40.730
[inaudible] Tj Dillashaw.
He's actually going to blue belt.
Oh yeah.

3146
02:44:41.090 --> 02:44:45.880
So maybe soon maybe.
Then you're going to go brown,
black,
white,
Brown,
black.

3147
02:44:45.970 --> 02:44:48.040
Nice.
Yeah.
I got my shield laid out,
man.

3148
02:44:48.041 --> 02:44:49.690
I broke it down to a science and a structure.

3149
02:44:50.140 --> 02:44:52.540
That's a big thing about the hololens style,

3150
02:44:52.541 --> 02:44:55.750
the Dutch style of a Muy Thai panic.

3151
02:44:56.420 --> 02:44:59.500
I trained with rob came and a bunch of times.
Yeah.
Nice.
Yeah.
Robertson man.

3152
02:44:59.501 --> 02:45:03.220
I learned a lot from his actual VHS tapes they got from web century or whatever.

3153
02:45:03.310 --> 02:45:06.430
I used to watch those fuckers all the time.
I was really impressed at like,

3154
02:45:06.670 --> 02:45:10.210
like the way he structures his combinations.
It's very technical.
It's like,

3155
02:45:10.420 --> 02:45:13.960
you know,
left hook,
right leg kick this position.
That was the question.

3156
02:45:15.100 --> 02:45:16.180
The way you like,

3157
02:45:16.181 --> 02:45:20.170
you sort of picture it and then once you train with a guy who was explaining

3158
02:45:20.171 --> 02:45:23.000
that stuff to you,
then you watch a fight.
You could see it take place.
You know,

3159
02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:24.730
we watched like Remy one Joshkey Ski,

3160
02:45:24.731 --> 02:45:27.790
your wife's like certain time fighters and you go,
oh,
I see what he just did.

3161
02:45:27.791 --> 02:45:31.930
They're like,
there's a Ernesto hoost highlight reel where he,
to me,

3162
02:45:32.080 --> 02:45:36.430
he had the best left hook,
right leg combo ever.
He will just slap,

3163
02:45:36.880 --> 02:45:40.990
you know,
he would just set that up.
So beautiful.
Perfect.
Oh that was,

3164
02:45:41.280 --> 02:45:45.580
that was a good guy too.
He's cool.
I like it.
Very nice.
Very friendly.
But that,

3165
02:45:45.610 --> 02:45:49.240
that fucking leg kick highlight.
Pull that shit up.
We'll,
we'll close with this.

3166
02:45:49.270 --> 02:45:50.260
Pull that up on Youtube.

3167
02:45:50.380 --> 02:45:54.880
It's cool for me to Ernesto hoost leg kick highlight was cool for me is to be

3168
02:45:54.881 --> 02:45:57.880
such a fan of Ernesto and then with time in Japan and seen him and then he knew

3169
02:45:57.881 --> 02:46:02.470
who I was.
I was like,
Oh fuck man.
That's bad.
Yeah.
He knew who I was too.

3170
02:46:02.471 --> 02:46:06.010
I was like,
Holy Shit.
Yeah,
but I'm still a,

3171
02:46:06.011 --> 02:46:07.600
I'm a kickbox Dork.

3172
02:46:10.600 --> 02:46:13.350
<v 6>Fuck yeah.
You get,
watch this.
You Watch</v>

3173
02:46:14.010 --> 02:46:15.760
<v 1>these fucking leg kicks man.</v>

3174
02:46:17.020 --> 02:46:19.080
<v 6>That's not it.
Oh yeah it is.
This is,</v>

3175
02:46:20.230 --> 02:46:23.440
this is just the beginning of it before it actually shows the video.

3176
02:46:23.441 --> 02:46:26.830
This is just a showing the highlight and then it goes into this

3177
02:46:27.050 --> 02:46:28.870
<v 1>part word.
Skipping ahead a little.</v>

3178
02:46:28.880 --> 02:46:33.560
<v 6>Here it is.
Watch these miracle.
Yeah.
He found Marco a couple of times.</v>

3179
02:46:34.300 --> 02:46:37.700
Yeah,
it was cute.
One gets off on each other.
Yeah.
Basis man.

3180
02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:41.420
Jeez US backing up though,
Dude.

3181
02:46:41.421 --> 02:46:43.580
There's so Allie though really get hit with a baseball bat.

3182
02:46:43.940 --> 02:46:48.800
There's so Allie the in the way he chops town with it,
man.
Yeah.

3183
02:46:48.930 --> 02:46:53.870
Three quarters dropped and it's so like whip like,
I mean he would,
he was like,

3184
02:46:53.871 --> 02:46:56.600
he was hitting you with a fucking mace or something.

3185
02:46:57.460 --> 02:47:01.310
Here it is like Bernardo,
that fucking left hook,

3186
02:47:01.311 --> 02:47:06.311
right leg combo is so nasty and so beautiful to watch.

3187
02:47:06.800 --> 02:47:11.090
Like you want to talk about martial arts?
That mother fucker is a ballerina.
Yes.

3188
02:47:11.091 --> 02:47:15.170
I mean that shit is like way cooler than I think Barista cops ever done.

3189
02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:20.200
Look at that big bell cause this Cofina a big dude too many fast and that Combo

3190
02:47:22.761 --> 02:47:25.460
is so gorgeous.
The left hook,

3191
02:47:25.461 --> 02:47:30.220
right leg kick always over again with that Combo.
It's,

3192
02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:35.150
and he was shut mother fuckers down like Filo.
Look at him here.
He's like,

3193
02:47:35.300 --> 02:47:39.320
Jesus just sucked.
When that pops that beat him.
I was like,
I broke my heart man.

3194
02:47:39.740 --> 02:47:42.560
Well he got bum rushed by gorilla.
Yeah,
that's true.

3195
02:47:43.700 --> 02:47:44.970
Have you never seen that fight?

3196
02:47:45.380 --> 02:47:50.020
<v 1>Sab didn't even look like a human being.
He was the biggest,
any fires there been.</v>

3197
02:47:50.060 --> 02:47:53.570
Oh he was on everything that ever existed he was on,

3198
02:47:53.990 --> 02:47:57.650
he was 370 pounds of Mexican supplements just stacked into a man.

3199
02:47:58.490 --> 02:48:01.520
It's a beautiful thing though.
Again.
I mean I don't,

3200
02:48:01.521 --> 02:48:03.800
I don't think that it's good that Bob Sapp did that,

3201
02:48:03.801 --> 02:48:06.980
but I think that it's good that we got to see what happens when a guy that big

3202
02:48:07.310 --> 02:48:09.850
can do that can hit,
you know,
even a guy like Ernesto who is,

3203
02:48:09.860 --> 02:48:13.340
you can't stop that bum rush,
that big crazy fuck.

3204
02:48:13.370 --> 02:48:17.560
It was just going to fucking donkey Kong.
You went to the ground,
he did it.

3205
02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:21.050
He did it.
They did it with very little MMA experience.

3206
02:48:21.051 --> 02:48:25.070
Very little kickboxing you,
that's what,
that's what sucks with thousand breaks.

3207
02:48:25.071 --> 02:48:27.440
My heart man look up through it and that's because so much,
you know,

3208
02:48:27.441 --> 02:48:29.610
and then for him to get beat from somebody who's,
you know,

3209
02:48:29.640 --> 02:48:32.240
tend to get on paper not as good,
like that just sucks.

3210
02:48:32.270 --> 02:48:36.260
It shows you how gangster cro cop is a cop cause Krakoff finished him.

3211
02:48:36.261 --> 02:48:37.970
Especially back then.
Yeah,
I mean accuracy.

3212
02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:40.920
But he was also physically strong enough to keep the dude away,
push him off,

3213
02:48:40.970 --> 02:48:44.870
just pushed him.
And he was had this like aggressive style cro cop was also like,

3214
02:48:45.170 --> 02:48:48.500
he's like a sniper like leaps in and cracks you with shit.

3215
02:48:48.501 --> 02:48:51.860
Whereas like Ernesto would be more technical and would block shit.

3216
02:48:52.010 --> 02:48:54.650
You can't stand in front of that dude.
You just can't stand in front of us.

3217
02:48:54.700 --> 02:48:59.330
So a style like Morocco's will you like leap in with a head kick or leaping in

3218
02:48:59.331 --> 02:49:03.770
with one punch or one kick?
Just full block power blast.
Not as technical,

3219
02:49:03.960 --> 02:49:08.340
you know?
So when he fought,
he fought Ernesto.
It wasn't right style for Nesta

3220
02:49:08.370 --> 02:49:10.470
<v 0>when he's like Bob Sapp is a better style.</v>

3221
02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:14.580
I think there's also the fact that Bob had already fought a bunch of guys and

3222
02:49:14.940 --> 02:49:17.580
how long can you really keep that much supplements?

3223
02:49:19.410 --> 02:49:20.700
You know me and couple of elements,

3224
02:49:20.710 --> 02:49:25.140
there's never been a human that big inside of a ring show them show the picture

3225
02:49:25.141 --> 02:49:27.210
of Bob Sapp if you've never seen it.

3226
02:49:27.240 --> 02:49:31.860
So he's a sweetheart of a guy guy and it's really unfortunate.

3227
02:49:31.861 --> 02:49:34.590
And watching them fight now because it seems like he just goes down.
Oh,

3228
02:49:34.591 --> 02:49:35.424
he's still fighting.

3229
02:49:35.490 --> 02:49:38.700
He's lost like some insane amount of fights in a row that they made may get a

3230
02:49:38.701 --> 02:49:40.500
good chunk of change.
Now.
I don't think he did.

3231
02:49:40.540 --> 02:49:42.950
I think he also had a lot of problems.
Well,

3232
02:49:43.010 --> 02:49:45.450
I think he was making good money in Japan for a while,

3233
02:49:45.451 --> 02:49:47.640
but then I think he rented some problems with them.

3234
02:49:47.641 --> 02:49:50.320
And remember there was at one k one event where he wouldn't come out and fight.

3235
02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:55.260
They didn't prepare him or sent him to sign a contract before he fought.
Well,

3236
02:49:55.261 --> 02:49:57.880
yeah.
You know,
there was some Lukey fuck.

3237
02:50:01.050 --> 02:50:04.440
Are you kidding me?
Is that the biggest guys ever been inside the ring?

3238
02:50:04.730 --> 02:50:06.840
A human being right there.
It's the same for sure.
Three,

3239
02:50:06.841 --> 02:50:11.841
three 70 with abs three 73 70 with ABS.

3240
02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:18.180
God dammit.
Anyway,
look man.

Has just learn shit so quick,

3247
02:50:34.590 --> 02:50:37.620
like showing you one thing and watching you duplicate it and then two or three

3248
02:50:37.621 --> 02:50:41.280
times later it's like 50,
60% better.
Like that's beautiful to say.
