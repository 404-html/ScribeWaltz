6
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm very irresponsible.</v>

7
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.740
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to be really cool is when we get something right back here.</v>

8
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.433
<v Speaker 2>That's the next step.</v>

9
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.690
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to figure out what to put right back there.</v>

10
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.780
<v Speaker 2>Most likely is going to be a green screen cause I'm looking at this right now.</v>

11
00:00:20.781 --> 00:00:23.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm like how dope would it be if we were in fucking space right now?</v>

12
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:23.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.700
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.600
<v Speaker 4>so Adderall give you clarity.</v>

15
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.640
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

16
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.310
<v Speaker 4>Cause my kids are trying to get me off it.</v>

17
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.590
<v Speaker 4>Why you're trying to get math.</v>

18
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.240
<v Speaker 4>My fucking kids like that.</v>

19
00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:45.500
<v Speaker 4>I put through Rehab,</v>

20
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.120
<v Speaker 4>give me shit about my fucking hair all tell me it's like no,</v>

21
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.120
<v Speaker 4>it's not like I've never done math except for,</v>

22
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

23
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.220
<v Speaker 4>two times guys married to Tom Arnold.</v>

24
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.960
<v Speaker 4>But aside from that,</v>

25
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.650
<v Speaker 4>you know I've never,</v>

26
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.600
<v Speaker 4>I would never get into math.</v>

27
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.780
<v Speaker 1>It would be very strange if one day it was proven that we are really living in</v>

28
00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:05.430
<v Speaker 1>some sort of self created reality.</v>

29
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.300
<v Speaker 1>It would be like a really traumatizing for a lot of people that have fucked it</v>

30
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:09.830
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

31
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

32
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.123
<v Speaker 1>this is what I made.</v>

33
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.671
<v Speaker 1>But it's like,</v>

34
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 1>remember when you were in school and like there was a project and you had to use</v>

35
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:16.880
<v Speaker 1>your hand and make a Turkey and you put your hand down.</v>

36
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.990
<v Speaker 1>He drew around and then you know,</v>

37
00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>everybody did their own little Turkey painted it and then the teacher would put</v>

38
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:22.191
<v Speaker 1>him up in the,</v>

39
00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 1>and I'll look at them and some people's,</v>

40
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Turkey's looked like dog shit.</v>

41
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.441
<v Speaker 1>I looked,</v>

42
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what the fuck a Turkey looked like.</v>

43
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even know how to draw around their hand.</v>

44
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Like everything was a disaster.</v>

45
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.710
<v Speaker 1>And other people that beautiful darkies well your life is a work of art.</v>

46
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

47
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.250
<v Speaker 1>your life is like a hand Turkey that you make in grade school.</v>

48
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.030
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

49
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.510
<v Speaker 1>you could do whatever you want with that thing.</v>

50
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.700
<v Speaker 1>You can make it super dope.</v>

51
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

52
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.720
<v Speaker 1>You know you can,</v>

53
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.360
<v Speaker 1>you can make it so it looks really cool if you put the effort and time into it.</v>

54
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:46.380
<v Speaker 1>If you really focus on it.</v>

55
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.390
<v Speaker 1>John Travolta met a single handedly,</v>

56
00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:53.280
<v Speaker 1>made more men gay just from this music and from singing and dancing and getting</v>

57
00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:54.114
<v Speaker 1>people to dance.</v>

58
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.320
<v Speaker 1>He probably personally,</v>

59
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 1>it was probably his total overall goal,</v>

60
00:01:57.781 --> 00:01:59.920
<v Speaker 1>which is to say nothing of his bath house work.</v>

61
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you mask your farts when you should shit in a public restroom?</v>

62
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.430
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

63
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.720
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

64

<v Speaker 1>Let it out.</v>

65
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.340
<v Speaker 1>You gotta do what you were going to hold up to the left girl.</v>

66
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.053
<v Speaker 1>An idiot.</v>

67
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.841
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

68
00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:10.830
<v Speaker 1>You have it on your phone.</v>

69

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

71
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.711
<v Speaker 1>40 year old man.</v>

72
00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 1>He's got it on his phone.</v>

73
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

74
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

75
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Anybody who says it doesn't go in your asshole shut it.</v>

76
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.060
<v Speaker 2>He's clearly looking at that and just being like,</v>

77
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:24.331
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

78
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:25.040
<v Speaker 2>you fucking,</v>

79

<v Speaker 2>it's well,</v>

80
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:27.840
<v Speaker 2>you know it doesn't always go in.</v>

81
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it just hits the taint.</v>

82
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's just the that would hurt.</v>

83
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:32.291
<v Speaker 2>That would hurt.</v>

84
00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:35.730
<v Speaker 2>You got a good grip on the upper deck and it doesn't actually get in the</v>

85
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.613
<v Speaker 2>asshole.</v>

86
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.010
<v Speaker 2>He's just calling the lit up,</v>

87
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 2>pulling the lit up on the macaroni and cheese container.</v>

88
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.530
<v Speaker 2>Just get the steam out.</v>

89
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

90
00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:46.020
<v Speaker 2>just Tupperware in that motherfucker.</v>

91
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 2>But sometimes it goes in the asshole freakiest</v>

92
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.130
<v Speaker 1>thing is you know how to rope off everything at a Times Square when uh,</v>

93
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.510
<v Speaker 1>when the ball is going to drop or whatever.</v>

94
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 1>And there's a certain time you can't go past the barricades.</v>

96
00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>One night I was there and</v>

97
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 5>the guy said,</v>

98
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 5>well you remember the Church of Scientology?</v>

99
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>

100
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.873
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

101
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 5>and he let me in through the barricade.</v>

102
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.451
<v Speaker 5>Real Story.</v>

103
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:07.900
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

104
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.733
<v Speaker 5>real story.</v>

105
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.660
<v Speaker 5>He probably just wanted to fuck you</v>

106
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] handsome guy.</v>

107
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.420
<v Speaker 2>But that's what they told me.</v>

108
00:03:23.421 --> 00:03:27.020
<v Speaker 2>So like that would probably be like 7% or something like that.</v>

109
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 2>If I was,</v>

110
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:28.551
<v Speaker 2>I was super,</v>

111
00:03:28.551 --> 00:03:32.990
<v Speaker 2>super lean but not doing compared to these guys with these guys are doing,</v>

112
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

113
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.880
<v Speaker 2>I was working out with these guys are doing is like getting real close to death</v>

114
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.500
<v Speaker 2>while keeping giant muscles.</v>

115
00:03:39.501 --> 00:03:41.090
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking madness.</v>

116
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.970
<v Speaker 2>Like this is the nuttiest fucking sport of all time.</v>

117
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

118
00:03:44.131 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 2>It's performance art.</v>

119
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.930

125
00:04:01.371 --> 00:04:02.204
<v Speaker 2>She can't move.</v>

126
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.800
<v Speaker 2>She had an aneurysm 12 years ago,</v>

127
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.450
<v Speaker 2>so she's just lying in bed like that.</v>

128
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.333
<v Speaker 3>Hello.</v>

129
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.281

00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:09.920
<v Speaker 2>She was in just paying the one time.</v>

131
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.790
<v Speaker 2>She does.</v>

132
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.110
<v Speaker 2>She's done from the aneurism on.</v>

133
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.790
<v Speaker 2>They gave her 72 hours to live.</v>

134
00:04:13.791 --> 00:04:15.020
<v Speaker 2>She lived for 12 years.</v>

135
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

136

151
00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:05.820

<v Speaker 6>what I fucking do,</v>

155
00:05:09.651 --> 00:05:10.970
<v Speaker 6>you should say of her,</v>

156
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.073
<v Speaker 6>my brother,</v>

157
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.000
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if she's moaning because of the aneurism.</v>

158
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.910
<v Speaker 6>Gogo Kellogg</v>

159
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.470
<v Speaker 2>from Kellogg cereal.</v>

160
00:05:24.471 --> 00:05:25.304
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

161
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.203
<v Speaker 2>He had a thing.</v>

162
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.133
<v Speaker 2>He was very,</v>

163
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.233
<v Speaker 2>you ever see that?</v>

164
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.700
<v Speaker 2>People who masturbate you gotta thing about that.</v>

165
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean the whole thing with the corn flakes,</v>

166
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.540
<v Speaker 2>the reason corn flakes were invented was to stop boys from masturbation.</v>

167
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.111
<v Speaker 2>How was it?</v>

168
00:05:39.111 --> 00:05:40.460
<v Speaker 2>How was the idea behind that?</v>

169
00:05:40.461 --> 00:05:42.340
<v Speaker 2>We do that explained this to us before then.</v>

170
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.580
<v Speaker 2>The idea is that spicy foods excite the sensibilities and so if you eat</v>

171
00:05:46.581 --> 00:05:47.960
<v Speaker 2>something that tastes interesting,</v>

172
00:05:47.961 --> 00:05:48.890
<v Speaker 2>you're going to want to come.</v>

173
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.203
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

174
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.760
<v Speaker 2>they embed and also Graham crackers.</v>

175
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Graham was another,</v>

176
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 2>these big ante masturbation evangelizers so invent these really</v>

177
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 6>intentionally bland foods.</v>

178
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.140
<v Speaker 6>They like to keep the teenage boys from jerking off so that when they finger,</v>

179
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 6>they're assholes.</v>

180
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 6>They immediately calm.</v>

181
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:11.743
<v Speaker 6>Exactly</v>

182
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.933
<v Speaker 6>veal.</v>

183
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 6>Keep them in the dark.</v>

184
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.260
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

185
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.870
<v Speaker 6>cow could milk itself.</v>

186
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 6>That would be bad.</v>

187
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.370
<v Speaker 7>And she goes,</v>

188
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.203
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

189
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.220
<v Speaker 7>I'm not the problem with money anymore.</v>

190
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.740
<v Speaker 7>Your father's the one who spends all the money now.</v>

191
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.791
<v Speaker 7>And then she pointed my,</v>

192
00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:31.390
<v Speaker 7>Dan goes,</v>

193
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.050
<v Speaker 7>tell him,</v>

194
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.370
<v Speaker 7>tell him what you spend your money on.</v>

195
00:06:33.371 --> 00:06:34.840
<v Speaker 7>And I've already clicked what this won't be.</v>

196
00:06:34.841 --> 00:06:35.440
<v Speaker 7>And I've gone,</v>

197
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.230
<v Speaker 7>oh wait,</v>

198

200
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:38.590
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to know.</v>

201
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.520
<v Speaker 7>And then it goes,</v>

202
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.440
<v Speaker 7>your father gets prostitutes</v>

203
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:44.523
<v Speaker 7>and I've gone,</v>

204
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:45.790
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

205
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.960
<v Speaker 7>just shut up.</v>

208
00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.810
<v Speaker 7>And then my dad went,</v>

209
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.550
<v Speaker 7>not every Wednesday.</v>

210
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.530
<v Speaker 6>Do you have a catch phrase when you hunt,</v>

211
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:06.923
<v Speaker 6>when you hit one?</v>

212

228
00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:02.030
<v Speaker 6>The Sun would come</v>

229
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.550
<v Speaker 6>up a black hole.</v>

230
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.170
<v Speaker 6>We don't know what to do about a black hole.</v>

231
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.750
<v Speaker 6>We can get an infinite amount of Dunkin's to come in it.</v>

232
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:10.001
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

233
00:08:10.001 --> 00:08:10.211
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

234
00:08:10.211 --> 00:08:10.740
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

235
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.890
<v Speaker 6>mass broken down to the smallest,</v>

236
00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:13.724
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

237
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.620
<v Speaker 6>It's not going to stop an infinite amount of come.</v>

238
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:16.723
<v Speaker 6>Trust me,</v>

239
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.730
<v Speaker 6>there's a whole other universe inside.</v>

240
00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:22.420
<v Speaker 6>They're still not big enough for infinite amounts of calm.</v>

241
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.353
<v Speaker 6>Sorry.</v>

242
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:24.470
<v Speaker 6>The black hole is like,</v>

243
00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck?</v>

244
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:28.770
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

245
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.910
<v Speaker 9>this is one of the things,</v>

246
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.820
<v Speaker 9>especially talking to college students that I love bringing up,</v>

247
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.781
<v Speaker 9>which is that,</v>

248
00:08:33.781 --> 00:08:34.690
<v Speaker 9>and I'm the first to a minute,</v>

249
00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:36.480
<v Speaker 9>like I have no fucking clue what I'm doing.</v>

250
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:37.950
<v Speaker 9>99% of the time,</v>

251
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:39.540
<v Speaker 9>especially when I got started,</v>

252
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.590
<v Speaker 9>I still don't know.</v>

253
00:08:40.591 --> 00:08:40.891
<v Speaker 9>And I've,</v>

254
00:08:40.891 --> 00:08:42.150
<v Speaker 9>I've come to realize like,</v>

255
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:43.980
<v Speaker 9>and I've got,</v>

256
00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:44.231
<v Speaker 9>I've got,</v>

257
00:08:44.231 --> 00:08:45.960
<v Speaker 9>I've been lucky enough to meet some pretty like successful,</v>

258
00:08:45.961 --> 00:08:46.621
<v Speaker 9>impressive people.</v>

259
00:08:46.621 --> 00:08:48.390
<v Speaker 9>But like you dig under the surface,</v>

260
00:08:48.391 --> 00:08:49.260
<v Speaker 9>we're all just hacking it.</v>

261
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.720
<v Speaker 9>Like we're all just expertise,</v>

262
00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:51.080
<v Speaker 9>experience,</v>

263
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:51.930
<v Speaker 9>those things all help.</v>

264
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.420
<v Speaker 9>But like every one of us is a fallible human,</v>

265
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:59.540
<v Speaker 9>all the and rules and status quo we know were created by other fallible humans.</v>

266
00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:00.421
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

267
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 9>And there's no reason not to look at that and go,</v>

268
00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:02.730
<v Speaker 9>Huh,</v>

269
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:03.810
<v Speaker 9>does it have to be that way?</v>

270
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 9>Or why is it that way?</v>

271
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:06.360
<v Speaker 9>And if the reason why is,</v>

272
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:07.380
<v Speaker 9>well that's the way it is.</v>

273
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:08.700
<v Speaker 9>Well that's a terrible reason,</v>

274
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:09.661
<v Speaker 9>you know?</v>

275
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:10.494
<v Speaker 9>And,</v>

276
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.720
<v Speaker 9>and when you see the world as being that hackable,</v>

277
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.583
<v Speaker 9>so to speak,</v>

278
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:14.790
<v Speaker 9>like you start to realize,</v>

279
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:15.001
<v Speaker 9>all right,</v>

280
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:15.421
<v Speaker 9>well let's just,</v>

281
00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:16.650
<v Speaker 9>let's actually question stuff.</v>

282
00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.673
<v Speaker 10>Tell,</v>

283
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.230
<v Speaker 10>did you see a special roadwork?</v>

284
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:19.981
<v Speaker 10>I heard it's awesome.</v>

285
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:20.640
<v Speaker 10>So funny.</v>

286
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.001
<v Speaker 10>But he,</v>

287
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:21.240
<v Speaker 10>um,</v>

288
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.240
<v Speaker 10>I was sitting at the table with my dissing rounds of venture female comics and</v>

289
00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 10>we were like eating dessert.</v>

290
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.750
<v Speaker 10>It was like a really like,</v>

291
00:09:27.751 --> 00:09:28.360
<v Speaker 10>sad moment.</v>

292

00:11:02.571 --> 00:11:03.321
<v Speaker 10>But here's the other thing.</v>

367
00:11:03.321 --> 00:11:03.630
<v Speaker 10>I mean,</v>

368
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:03.900
<v Speaker 10>I,</v>

369
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.510
<v Speaker 10>I don't even know if the word is trick and I'll,</v>

370
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:06.690
<v Speaker 10>I mean I totally fell for him.</v>

<v Speaker 10>I feel like,</v>

373
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:11.060
<v Speaker 10>I guess it is trek,</v>

374
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:12.650
<v Speaker 10>but it's also once he was like,</v>

375
00:11:12.651 --> 00:11:14.270
<v Speaker 10>why would I question that in my life?</v>

376
00:11:14.271 --> 00:11:16.580
<v Speaker 10>No one's ever lied about where they went to school that I knew of.</v>

377
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:17.210
<v Speaker 10>Right.</v>

378
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.240
<v Speaker 10>These are not lies that in society we're told to look out for.</v>

379
00:11:20.241 --> 00:11:21.380
<v Speaker 10>It'd be one like everyone's like,</v>

380
00:11:21.381 --> 00:11:22.250
<v Speaker 10>does he have another family?</v>

381
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.800
<v Speaker 10>I wouldn't even think about like your school.</v>

382
00:11:24.801 --> 00:11:25.431
<v Speaker 10>Like who cares?</v>

383
00:11:25.431 --> 00:11:26.620
<v Speaker 10>It's like lying about your blood type.</v>

384
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:30.920
<v Speaker 11>Disruption in a competitive market is actually very,</v>

385
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.650
<v Speaker 11>very enticing to the,</v>

386
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.190
<v Speaker 11>to the second and third tier players because they don't have an advantage.</v>

387
00:11:37.191 --> 00:11:39.230
<v Speaker 11>There are too small to compete against the big guys.</v>

388
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.390
<v Speaker 11>But if they see this disruptive technology,</v>

389
00:11:41.391 --> 00:11:41.631
<v Speaker 11>I think,</v>

390
00:11:41.631 --> 00:11:45.410
<v Speaker 11>well maybe if I hit your ride on that I'm going to overtake everybody.</v>

391
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.490
<v Speaker 11>Um,</v>

392
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:47.510
<v Speaker 11>and you know,</v>

393
00:11:47.511 --> 00:11:50.930
<v Speaker 11>I can be the blockbuster or it can be the Netflix.</v>

394
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.530
<v Speaker 11>I can be the tower records</v>

395
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.420
<v Speaker 5>or I can be the iTunes.</v>

396
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.050
<v Speaker 5>And we've seen this happen in technology racist before of course,</v>

397
00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:01.690
<v Speaker 5>but I meant like when you're not doing this and you said five hours,</v>

398
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.100
<v Speaker 5>five hours maybe.</v>

399
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.260
<v Speaker 5>Is that because you all juiced up with nicotine all the time?</v>

400
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.870
<v Speaker 5>I think cause I'm old and my prostate tells me it's time to get up.</v>

401
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.330
<v Speaker 5>I take a leak five hours and you're good.</v>

402
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.140
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

403
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:11.920

407

<v Speaker 6>What is this doctor Oz who gives a shit?</v>

408
00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:23.810
<v Speaker 6>It's like we were just watching heavy metal and there's like a,</v>

409

413
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.170
<v Speaker 6>Get used to it.</v>

414

449
00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:53.410
<v Speaker 5>What were you saying?</v>

450
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:54.011
<v Speaker 5>I've had sex.</v>

451
00:13:54.011 --> 00:13:58.420
<v Speaker 5>Why life sold after the woman left because he thought I was rational.</v>

452
00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.440
<v Speaker 5>You thought it was rational?</v>

453
00:13:59.620 --> 00:13:59.801
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

454
00:13:59.801 --> 00:14:02.080
<v Speaker 5>cause I remember she was like scratching this area of her body.</v>

455
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.341
<v Speaker 5>When she left.</v>

456
00:14:03.341 --> 00:14:04.650
<v Speaker 5>I was like freaked out so hard.</v>

457
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.070
<v Speaker 5>But I went into my bathroom,</v>

458
00:14:06.071 --> 00:14:09.520
<v Speaker 5>I started Lysol hauling my legs like shape and then dish soap.</v>

459
00:14:09.521 --> 00:14:10.980
<v Speaker 5>And then Lysaght and the next day I,</v>

460
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:12.070
<v Speaker 5>speaking of 12 step meetings,</v>

461
00:14:12.071 --> 00:14:15.970
<v Speaker 5>I went to my first and only sex addicts anonymous meeting.</v>

462
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:16.571
<v Speaker 5>I was just like,</v>

463
00:14:16.571 --> 00:14:17.590
<v Speaker 5>something's got to change.</v>

464
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.600
<v Speaker 6>To look at your face was awesome,</v>

465
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:26.020
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

466
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.571
<v Speaker 6>there's no,</v>

467
00:14:26.571 --> 00:14:27.201
<v Speaker 6>there's very little,</v>

468
00:14:27.201 --> 00:14:27.250
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

469
00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:30.130
<v Speaker 5>the way for you to convince yourself that you're just like a young man swinging</v>

470
00:14:30.131 --> 00:14:30.410
<v Speaker 5>around,</v>

471
00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:31.210
<v Speaker 5>having a good time,</v>

472
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:35.830
<v Speaker 5>engaging in the regular sexuality of all human beings when you're spraying Lysol</v>

473
00:14:35.831 --> 00:14:36.664
<v Speaker 5>on here.</v>

474
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:38.651
<v Speaker 5>And so now,</v>

475
00:14:38.651 --> 00:14:38.931
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

476
00:14:38.931 --> 00:14:40.180
<v Speaker 5>it's still use faggot in the column.</v>

477
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.630
<v Speaker 5>I'm not one of those uh,</v>

478
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:42.940
<v Speaker 5>gay rights activists who,</v>

479
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:43.171
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

480
00:14:43.171 --> 00:14:47.500
<v Speaker 5>when David Spade or Jonah Hill or Alec Baldwin uses Faggot like falls down and</v>

481
00:14:47.501 --> 00:14:48.970
<v Speaker 5>screams and yells and calls for their heads.</v>

482
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:49.931
<v Speaker 5>I've actually,</v>

483
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:50.111
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

484
00:14:50.111 --> 00:14:53.540
<v Speaker 5>I defended David well a million years ago from glad when they were after him.</v>

485
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.420
<v Speaker 5>I think Louis C K does it a hilarious things with faggot.</v>

486
00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.860
<v Speaker 5>So I don't think that it's not a hate word anymore if you can't let straight</v>

487
00:15:00.861 --> 00:15:03.030
<v Speaker 5>people use it when the case,</v>

488
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:03.410
<v Speaker 5>when the,</v>

489
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.060
<v Speaker 5>their intent is clearly not hateful.</v>

490
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:10.300
<v Speaker 5>And so I feel like it shouldn't be a problem for people to use the t word tranny</v>

491
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:12.050
<v Speaker 5>in a non hateful context.</v>

492
00:15:12.051 --> 00:15:15.160
<v Speaker 5>But so many trans people are so invested right now politically in uh,</v>

493
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.960
<v Speaker 5>in stopping its usage at all ever.</v>

494
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.000
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

495
00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:20.541
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

496
00:15:20.541 --> 00:15:22.460
<v Speaker 5>in deference to their delicate sensibilities</v>

497
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.880
<v Speaker 1>stopped Ari Shaffir has so many stories about China.</v>

498
00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:28.610
<v Speaker 1>We talked about so many other things besides his stories about China,</v>

499
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:29.840
<v Speaker 1>which is how we have to keep going.</v>

500
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:32.180
<v Speaker 1>So you have bout to tell some crazy noodle story.</v>

501
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.250
<v Speaker 1>So they had these noodles is treat noodles you can get,</v>

502
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:35.720
<v Speaker 1>I was advised the first day,</v>

503
00:15:35.721 --> 00:15:37.730
<v Speaker 1>like you don't want those and show them this video.</v>

504
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.700
<v Speaker 1>What they would do is they would go to the sewer,</v>

505
00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:46.100
<v Speaker 1>they would take raw sewage out of the sewer and then boil it down the way they'd</v>

506
00:15:46.101 --> 00:15:47.690
<v Speaker 1>make wax hash wax,</v>

507
00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:52.720
<v Speaker 1>they'd boil off the sewage and whatever was left that's cooking oil that they</v>

508
00:15:54.831 --> 00:15:55.664
<v Speaker 1>would use.</v>

509
00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.140
<v Speaker 1>It's super fucking harmful.</v>

510
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.870
<v Speaker 1>And then sell to like a lot of the street noodle guys.</v>

511
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:00.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

512
00:16:00.681 --> 00:16:02.750
<v Speaker 1>That face is what I made that same face.</v>

513
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.580
<v Speaker 1>They were cooking with sewer oil,</v>

514
00:16:04.581 --> 00:16:05.414
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>

515
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:09.950
<v Speaker 1>I think we've been parasitized by an astonishing farm of political correctness.</v>

516
00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean what does Pressa ties lighten there like a parasite that,</v>

517
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:13.213
<v Speaker 1>oh right.</v>

518
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:18.340
<v Speaker 1>So in the same way that I like that word that viruses can enter your body virus,</v>

519
00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.940
<v Speaker 1>viruses of the Mike and also take over your,</v>

520
00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:28.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean religion is an example of a Mima plex form of some people would be upset</v>

521
00:16:28.251 --> 00:16:28.821
<v Speaker 1>by what I'm saying,</v>

522
00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:31.850
<v Speaker 1>but a form of parasite that kind of rewires your thinking.</v>

523
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.340
<v Speaker 1>And so political correctness is a,</v>

524
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:39.670
<v Speaker 1>an astonishing form of parasitic thinking where everything is viewed through the</v>

525
00:16:40.371 --> 00:16:43.310
<v Speaker 1>lens of I should not offend anyone.</v>

526
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:48.290
<v Speaker 1>And so common sense and just reason goes out the window in the pursuit of non</v>

527
00:16:48.291 --> 00:16:48.890
<v Speaker 1>offense.</v>

528
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:50.630
<v Speaker 1>This is not a subject I'm really into,</v>

529
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:52.280
<v Speaker 1>but there is a woman,</v>

530
00:16:52.281 --> 00:16:56.480
<v Speaker 1>this German woman who does shit porn where people shit on her and she's like the</v>

531
00:16:56.481 --> 00:16:57.590
<v Speaker 1>queen of Shit Porn.</v>

532
00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Don't ask me how I know that somebody posted it on my message board and I</v>

533
00:17:00.931 --> 00:17:03.650
<v Speaker 1>followed a fucking all over link hole.</v>

534
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.480
<v Speaker 1>I went from link to link to link to,</v>

535
00:17:05.481 --> 00:17:07.330
<v Speaker 1>I got to her site and watch some of her videos.</v>

536
00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:07.701
<v Speaker 1>Your side.</v>

537
00:17:07.701 --> 00:17:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Good egg.com.</v>

538
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:11.571
<v Speaker 12>Uh,</v>

539
00:17:11.571 --> 00:17:12.500
<v Speaker 12>I feel like,</v>

540
00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:14.300
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

541
00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.680
<v Speaker 12>if you tell me in the past what's the core age,</v>

542
00:17:18.681 --> 00:17:20.150
<v Speaker 12>what's the opposite of courage?</v>

543
00:17:20.151 --> 00:17:24.860
<v Speaker 12>I want to say cowardness because either you tough enough to challenge and to</v>

544
00:17:24.861 --> 00:17:28.280
<v Speaker 12>fight or to or in their new car and then you chicken out.</v>

545
00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:30.130
<v Speaker 12>So that's in the past was like the,</v>

546
00:17:30.131 --> 00:17:30.301
<v Speaker 12>the,</v>

547
00:17:30.301 --> 00:17:30.970
<v Speaker 12>the,</v>

548
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:31.240
<v Speaker 12>the,</v>

549
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.600
<v Speaker 12>the opposite of,</v>

550
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:33.130
<v Speaker 12>of,</v>

551
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:37.790
<v Speaker 12>of courage is very high to measure this in those days.</v>

552
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.640
<v Speaker 12>And I believe the opposite of college should they,</v>

553
00:17:40.641 --> 00:17:41.630
<v Speaker 12>is conformity.</v>

554
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:42.171
<v Speaker 12>You know,</v>

555
00:17:42.171 --> 00:17:43.490
<v Speaker 12>his people get conformed.</v>

556
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:44.031
<v Speaker 12>Oh,</v>

557
00:17:44.031 --> 00:17:44.141
<v Speaker 12>I,</v>

558
00:17:44.141 --> 00:17:46.610
<v Speaker 12>I don't like my wife the way I used to like,</v>

559
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:51.000
<v Speaker 12>but I'm never going to divorce because I'm afraid to lose my house or the</v>

560
00:17:51.001 --> 00:17:52.980
<v Speaker 12>situation is so established so I'm going to keep,</v>

561
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.490
<v Speaker 12>so I don't like this job but I got to keep here because better than he is.</v>

562
00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.130
<v Speaker 12>So [inaudible] not the hands of the few.</v>

563
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.500
<v Speaker 12>If you get caught on that kind of compromise to,</v>

564
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.770
<v Speaker 12>to maintain because you were you afraid to risk,</v>

565
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.800
<v Speaker 12>that's keep you like one step behind from you,</v>

566
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.300
<v Speaker 12>follow your heart,</v>

567
00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:10.440
<v Speaker 12>follow your ambition.</v>

568
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:15.470
<v Speaker 12>So that's kind of pretty much where keep you from be at your best because if you</v>

569
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:19.830
<v Speaker 12>willing to sacrifice,</v>

570
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.060
<v Speaker 12>if you're willing to,</v>

571
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:23.560
<v Speaker 12>to broke new new challenges.</v>

572
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.050
<v Speaker 12>If you really chew you in the stage of liveliness and,</v>

573
00:18:27.051 --> 00:18:29.370
<v Speaker 12>and excitement and unpredictability,</v>

574
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.920
<v Speaker 12>who make you feel like you're in heaven</v>

575
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.180
<v Speaker 13>even though her neck will fuck though she was determined to do nominate people</v>

576

585

<v Speaker 13>through the stern way.</v>

586
00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:03.630
<v Speaker 13>Oh we know I had to jump out to sea in Hola Nica washy drive across the track.</v>

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:11.403
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

593
00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:16.030
<v Speaker 1>What's weird when anybody PR like when a guy is like working in an angle and</v>

594
00:19:16.031 --> 00:19:21.031
<v Speaker 1>trying really hard to like position himself as better than he positioned himself</v>

595
00:19:22.931 --> 00:19:25.510
<v Speaker 1>as being like different than every other guy.</v>

596
00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

597
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:26.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

598
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:26.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

599
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.870
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of guys out there to doing really negative things.</v>

600
00:19:28.871 --> 00:19:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I read this one guy's fucking Twitter page of the day.</v>

601
00:19:31.181 --> 00:19:32.050
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

602
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:33.011
<v Speaker 1>It was just like,</v>

603
00:19:33.011 --> 00:19:33.241
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

604
00:19:33.241 --> 00:19:34.840
<v Speaker 1>he might be the ultimate White Knight.</v>

605
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:36.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give out his Twitter page.</v>

606
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

607
00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:37.480
<v Speaker 1>But he,</v>

608
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.820
<v Speaker 1>he might be like the greatest I if I met him,</v>

609
00:19:39.821 --> 00:19:44.230
<v Speaker 1>he probably has almost no blood in his veins is blood sugar is probably zero.</v>

610
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.850
<v Speaker 1>He'd probably faints all day long.</v>

611
00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:49.420
<v Speaker 1>It was so weak.</v>

612
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.390
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things he said is he said,</v>

613
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.233
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

614
00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:55.930
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

615
00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:58.690
<v Speaker 1>although I still practice feminists,</v>

616
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.700
<v Speaker 1>I still practice feminism.</v>

617
00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:02.350
<v Speaker 1>I no longer,</v>

618
00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:02.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

619
00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:04.750
<v Speaker 1>associate I no longer,</v>

620
00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:04.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

621
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:05.501
<v Speaker 1>what'd he say?</v>

622
00:20:05.501 --> 00:20:10.501
<v Speaker 1>Advertise myself as a feminist because I feel like it's up to women to decide</v>

623
00:20:11.081 --> 00:20:13.360
<v Speaker 1>whether or not I'm doing feminism correctly.</v>

624
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

625
00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:15.693
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

626
00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.820
<v Speaker 1>So I'll still practice feminism,</v>

627
00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:22.360
<v Speaker 1>but I will no longer advertise myself as a feminist.</v>

628
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:23.733
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

629
00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:27.883
<v Speaker 12>That's a,</v>

630
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.870
<v Speaker 12>I actually don't even know what to say about that.</v>

631
00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.120
<v Speaker 12>Male feminism is a very strange thing,</v>

632
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.700
<v Speaker 12>but we would sit up there all night.</v>

633
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:35.810
<v Speaker 12>It would be me,</v>

634
00:20:35.811 --> 00:20:36.351
<v Speaker 12>Norton,</v>

635
00:20:36.351 --> 00:20:37.850
<v Speaker 12>mainly Keith and Patrice.</v>

636
00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:38.650
<v Speaker 12>Just Smith.</v>

637
00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:39.520
<v Speaker 12>Billie birther,</v>

638
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:42.200
<v Speaker 12>fucking Billy comes into the seller,</v>

639
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:43.843
<v Speaker 12>right?</v>

640
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.241
<v Speaker 12>And she says,</v>

641
00:20:44.241 --> 00:20:45.350
<v Speaker 12>I'm going to the world series.</v>

642
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.340
<v Speaker 12>It's when the mets were playing the in the world share.</v>

643
00:20:48.341 --> 00:20:49.174
<v Speaker 12>He's a subway.</v>

644
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:49.901
<v Speaker 12>He goes,</v>

645
00:20:49.901 --> 00:20:50.591
<v Speaker 12>I'm going to the game.</v>

646
00:20:50.591 --> 00:20:50.801
<v Speaker 12>We go,</v>

647
00:20:50.801 --> 00:20:51.251
<v Speaker 12>how the fuck?</v>

648
00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:52.090
<v Speaker 12>How do you get tickets?</v>

649
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.931
<v Speaker 12>He goes,</v>

650
00:20:52.931 --> 00:20:53.031
<v Speaker 12>wow,</v>

651
00:20:53.031 --> 00:20:58.031
<v Speaker 12>these dudes hired me to do a show under a bus on the way and are given and right</v>

652
00:20:58.121 --> 00:20:59.020
<v Speaker 12>when he said that,</v>

653
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.520
<v Speaker 12>everybody's eyes lit up.</v>

654
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.553
<v Speaker 12>We're fucking</v>

655
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:04.783
<v Speaker 12>we.</v>

656
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.280
<v Speaker 12>We did shit like this.</v>

657
00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.660
<v Speaker 12>You guys are a good crowd.</v>

658
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:14.080
<v Speaker 12>And off the bus we beat him to sweat was pouring down Billy's head.</v>

659
00:21:14.081 --> 00:21:14.914
<v Speaker 12>He didn't do it.</v>

660
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.250
<v Speaker 12>He gave the Gig away.</v>

661
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.640
<v Speaker 12>He didn't do it again because we beat them down so hard.</v>

662
00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.770
<v Speaker 12>It just fucking animals.</v>

663
00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:27.561
<v Speaker 5>I tell him,</v>

664
00:21:27.561 --> 00:21:28.394
<v Speaker 5>my daughter,</v>

665
00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:29.001
<v Speaker 5>a couple of,</v>

666
00:21:29.001 --> 00:21:31.170
<v Speaker 5>I made me two months ago about a,</v>

667
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.720
<v Speaker 5>there's an old Spanish proverb that says,</v>

668
00:21:32.721 --> 00:21:33.060
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

669
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:33.560
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

670
00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.840
<v Speaker 5>habits begin is cobwebs and end up as chains.</v>

671
00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.100
<v Speaker 5>Way Easier to break in the beginning than later off.</v>

672
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:39.351
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

673
00:21:39.351 --> 00:21:40.011
<v Speaker 5>Way To put it.</v>

674
00:21:40.011 --> 00:21:40.880
<v Speaker 5>It's a great way to put it.</v>

675
00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:41.600
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

676
00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.440
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

677
00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.460
<v Speaker 5>anyway,</v>

678
00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.150
<v Speaker 5>she just,</v>

679
00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:45.140
<v Speaker 5>she just brought this up,</v>

680
00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:45.321
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

681
00:21:45.321 --> 00:21:45.741
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

682
00:21:45.741 --> 00:21:46.490
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

683
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:48.320
<v Speaker 5>that we were talking about someone she knew and,</v>

684
00:21:48.321 --> 00:21:51.170
<v Speaker 5>and something that she didn't like that they did and she said,</v>

685
00:21:51.171 --> 00:21:51.321
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

686
00:21:51.321 --> 00:21:53.180
<v Speaker 5>but they're still pretty much in the cob web phase,</v>

687
00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:55.430
<v Speaker 5>so they can probably still change it at him.</v>

688
00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:55.850
<v Speaker 5>Was like,</v>

689
00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:56.010
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

690
00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:56.601
<v Speaker 5>I even,</v>

691
00:21:56.601 --> 00:21:57.170
<v Speaker 5>I didn't remember.</v>

692
00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:57.501
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>

693
00:21:57.501 --> 00:21:57.741
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

694
00:21:57.741 --> 00:21:58.970
<v Speaker 5>the cob webs and change things.</v>

695
00:21:58.971 --> 00:22:00.690
<v Speaker 5>Like she really sunk in her and she's like,</v>

696
00:22:00.691 --> 00:22:00.780
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

697
00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.610
<v Speaker 10>five societaly.</v>

698
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:07.590
<v Speaker 10>We're so resistant to looking at mental illness the same way we look at physical</v>

699
00:22:07.591 --> 00:22:08.424
<v Speaker 10>illness.</v>

700
00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:09.241
<v Speaker 10>We're so,</v>

701
00:22:09.241 --> 00:22:10.320
<v Speaker 10>it's so easy.</v>

702
00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:13.830
<v Speaker 10>Paul Gil Martin just made this point when he was on my podcast last week.</v>

703
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:19.410
<v Speaker 10>If you went up to somebody with diabetes type one diabetes and you were like,</v>

704
00:22:19.411 --> 00:22:20.250
<v Speaker 10>what the fuck dude?</v>

705
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:25.170
<v Speaker 10>Why don't you just think more positively so that your pancreas makes insulin?</v>

706
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.340
<v Speaker 10>Like what's wrong with you?</v>

707
00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:28.890
<v Speaker 10>Why can't you just make more insulin?</v>

708
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:29.971
<v Speaker 10>It's like they'd be like,</v>

709
00:22:29.971 --> 00:22:31.140
<v Speaker 10>what are you talking about?</v>

710
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:33.120
<v Speaker 10>It's the same thing with depression.</v>

711
00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.610
<v Speaker 10>People put the onus on you like they,</v>

712
00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.100
<v Speaker 10>they look at it like it's a disease of will,</v>

713
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.240
<v Speaker 10>but it's not.</v>

714
00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:39.631
<v Speaker 10>It's a,</v>

715
00:22:39.631 --> 00:22:44.631
<v Speaker 10>it's a biological illness and that's just very hard for people to understand and</v>

716
00:22:45.541 --> 00:22:48.750
<v Speaker 10>so what you end up doing is carrying around a lot of guilt and shame and a lot</v>

717
00:22:48.751 --> 00:22:49.321
<v Speaker 10>of feelings like,</v>

718
00:22:49.321 --> 00:22:50.041
<v Speaker 10>I'm not good enough.</v>

719
00:22:50.041 --> 00:22:53.190
<v Speaker 10>I can't will myself out of this if I just think more positively.</v>

720
00:22:53.191 --> 00:22:54.330
<v Speaker 10>It's not about that,</v>

721
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.830
<v Speaker 10>and I did that for years,</v>

722
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:57.023
<v Speaker 10>years.</v>

723
00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:58.950
<v Speaker 10>You just deal with it and I destroyed.</v>

724
00:22:59.010 --> 00:22:59.310
<v Speaker 10>Oh,</v>

725
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:00.690
<v Speaker 10>so many relationships.</v>

726
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.260
<v Speaker 1>The feeling of being a self,</v>

727
00:23:02.261 --> 00:23:03.790
<v Speaker 1>the feeling that we call I,</v>

728
00:23:03.791 --> 00:23:08.791
<v Speaker 1>the feeling of being an ego in the head is what it feels like to be thinking</v>

729
00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.540
<v Speaker 1>without knowing that you're thinking.</v>

730
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.021
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

731
00:23:11.021 --> 00:23:13.570
<v Speaker 1>it's the feeling of this next thought,</v>

732
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.610
<v Speaker 1>capturing consciousness.</v>

733
00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:17.530
<v Speaker 1>So when you say that thoughts,</v>

734
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.050
<v Speaker 1>you are identical to thoughts.</v>

735
00:23:19.051 --> 00:23:21.820
<v Speaker 1>So if you're thinking something really fucked up like a,</v>

736
00:23:21.821 --> 00:23:22.601
<v Speaker 1>I'm fat,</v>

737
00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm a loser,</v>

738
00:23:23.501 --> 00:23:24.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm always going to be a loser.</v>

739
00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Like that is identical to who you are because you are sort of framing yourself</v>

740
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:30.130
<v Speaker 1>in this thought,</v>

741
00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.130
<v Speaker 1>these thoughts that you're carrying around your mind there,</v>

742
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.980
<v Speaker 1>what's occupying your consciousness and the,</v>

743
00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:39.670
<v Speaker 1>if those thoughts are on the forefront of your consciousness that they identify</v>

744
00:23:39.671 --> 00:23:40.180
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

745
00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:40.661
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>

746
00:23:40.661 --> 00:23:44.050
<v Speaker 1>that you are those thoughts and you are identical to that idea.</v>

747
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:44.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

748
00:23:44.561 --> 00:23:47.450
<v Speaker 1>And their and their driving behavior and they're driving emotion and they're</v>

749
00:23:47.451 --> 00:23:50.420
<v Speaker 1>driving each subsequent train of thought.</v>

750
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.051
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

751
00:23:51.051 --> 00:23:51.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

752
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.560
<v Speaker 1>it's determining the,</v>

753
00:23:53.561 --> 00:23:53.801
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

754
00:23:53.801 --> 00:23:57.560
<v Speaker 1>the future expressions of your consciousness and your body as well.</v>

755
00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Those guys,</v>

756
00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:00.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not easy if for example,</v>

757
00:24:00.561 --> 00:24:05.360
<v Speaker 1>Brock was furious when Vince told him that he wanted him to beat the undertaker</v>

758
00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:05.721
<v Speaker 1>that day.</v>

759
00:24:05.721 --> 00:24:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Like in real life like Betty was.</v>

760
00:24:07.731 --> 00:24:08.960
<v Speaker 1>And you were there to see it.</v>

761
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.501
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

762
00:24:09.501 --> 00:24:11.030
<v Speaker 1>but I talked to somebody who was,</v>

763
00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.770
<v Speaker 1>but he was honest with you.</v>

764
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:14.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they lie all day.</v>

765
00:24:14.511 --> 00:24:15.344
<v Speaker 1>Every day.</v>

766
00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Tony is going to talk to some people.</v>

767
00:24:17.061 --> 00:24:17.751
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you a little,</v>

768
00:24:17.751 --> 00:24:18.470
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what.</v>

769
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Brock was actually mad.</v>

770
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:21.740
<v Speaker 1>He was really mad.</v>

771
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.090
<v Speaker 1>He read the script and you just like bullshit.</v>

772
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm not picking up.</v>

773
00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:26.521
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

774
00:24:26.521 --> 00:24:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Don't undertake undertaker.</v>

775
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Some of the guys that work,</v>

776
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:33.380
<v Speaker 1>unlike the technical side for the UFC work for the WWE,</v>

777
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:34.130
<v Speaker 1>ARD,</v>

778
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:34.963
<v Speaker 1>Brock was crying.</v>

779
00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.073
<v Speaker 1>That's what I heard.</v>

780
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:39.800
<v Speaker 1>That's went to the hospital with the undertaker.</v>

781
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.721
<v Speaker 1>Cried so hard.</v>

782
00:24:40.721 --> 00:24:42.740
<v Speaker 1>He dehydrated himself for that match.</v>

783
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:43.820
<v Speaker 1>They had to give him an IV</v>

784
00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.790
<v Speaker 6>to replenish his teasing thought he killed the undertaker from that concussion</v>

785
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:49.793
<v Speaker 6>was bad.</v>

786
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.540
<v Speaker 6>Bad.</v>

787
00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:52.141
<v Speaker 6>It was real.</v>

788
00:24:52.141 --> 00:24:53.370
<v Speaker 6>The concussions are real.</v>

789
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:54.643
<v Speaker 6>You can't,</v>

790
00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.030
<v Speaker 6>I don't even buy it was a real concussion.</v>

791
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:58.470
<v Speaker 6>I probably faked a concussion.</v>

792
00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:00.771
<v Speaker 6>Then dot.</v>

793

<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

830
00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:15.570
<v Speaker 6>I was driving,</v>

831
00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.340
<v Speaker 6>I live on the east side and I was driving,</v>

832
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:22.500
<v Speaker 6>I was riding on a TV show for a little while and I was driving to work one</v>

833
00:26:22.501 --> 00:26:27.030
<v Speaker 6>morning and I couldn't get to work because there was so much traffic and I was</v>

834
00:26:27.031 --> 00:26:27.301
<v Speaker 6>just like,</v>

835
00:26:27.301 --> 00:26:28.620
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck is going on?</v>

836
00:26:28.621 --> 00:26:28.860
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

837
00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.830
<v Speaker 6>it's 9:45 AM on Hollywood boulevard.</v>

838
00:26:31.831 --> 00:26:33.060
<v Speaker 6>Why is the show backed up?</v>

839
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:36.930
<v Speaker 6>And then I saw people like walking around with these shirts on that said our</v>

840
00:26:36.931 --> 00:26:38.010
<v Speaker 6>wounds are still open</v>

841
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.880
<v Speaker 6>and I feel like a real,</v>

842
00:26:41.881 --> 00:26:43.830
<v Speaker 6>I know I'm an asshole before say this.</v>

843
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:45.600
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was some kind of record</v>

844
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:46.523
<v Speaker 6>released</v>

845
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.400
<v Speaker 6>and I was getting so mad.</v>

846
00:26:49.401 --> 00:26:50.330
<v Speaker 6>I thought like a rapper,</v>

847
00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:54.510
<v Speaker 6>like a release day is going on.</v>

848
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:57.590
<v Speaker 6>It was still open.</v>

849
00:26:57.591 --> 00:26:58.250
<v Speaker 6>Our mouth,</v>

850
00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.010
<v Speaker 6>I'll close is moving.</v>

851
00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:02.630
<v Speaker 6>I rustled my toes</v>

852
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:06.683
<v Speaker 6>pretty,</v>

853
00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:08.300
<v Speaker 6>my teeth is gold.</v>

854
00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.360
<v Speaker 6>You're trying to buy my album,</v>

855
00:27:11.361 --> 00:27:16.361
<v Speaker 6>but the shit's already sold out on free style 2014 we won much love.</v>

856
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.060
<v Speaker 5>I've been trying to understand this American phenomena is southern Baptists and</v>

857
00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:31.230
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that I think is the key to this is that I think when they talk</v>

858
00:27:31.231 --> 00:27:32.460
<v Speaker 5>about being born again,</v>

859
00:27:32.461 --> 00:27:34.800
<v Speaker 5>originally baptism was just that.</v>

860
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:35.761
<v Speaker 5>I mean no,</v>

861
00:27:35.761 --> 00:27:38.340
<v Speaker 5>you can get this through DMT in five minutes,</v>

862
00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.050
<v Speaker 5>but at the time of John The baptist,</v>

863
00:27:40.051 --> 00:27:42.330
<v Speaker 5>you get it in five minutes through being droned.</v>

864
00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.090
<v Speaker 5>People were lining up on the bank of the Jordan.</v>

865
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:45.930
<v Speaker 5>They go in,</v>

866
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.010
<v Speaker 5>he holds them under.</v>

867
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:48.990
<v Speaker 5>If he held him under just long enough,</v>

868
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:51.810
<v Speaker 5>you could actually induce and near death experience.</v>

869
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:56.250
<v Speaker 5>New Life Review at the drowning man sees his life pass before him,</v>

870
00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:01.050
<v Speaker 5>hold them out of just long enough and they'd have a near death experience almost</v>

871
00:28:01.051 --> 00:28:01.884
<v Speaker 5>guaranteed.</v>

872
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.240
<v Speaker 5>I mean occasionally they might,</v>

873
00:28:03.241 --> 00:28:04.440
<v Speaker 5>he might've done it too long,</v>

874
00:28:04.441 --> 00:28:08.290
<v Speaker 5>but that was before litigation that you might've lost four litigate.</v>

875
00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:12.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

876
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:13.980
<v Speaker 5>Good theory actually.</v>

877
00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.910
<v Speaker 5>And then you see they come back and they said,</v>

878
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.800
<v Speaker 5>I've died.</v>

879
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.820
<v Speaker 5>I've seen the light.</v>

880
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.350
<v Speaker 5>I'd been born again.</v>

881
00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm no longer afraid of death.</v>

882
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.820
<v Speaker 5>My life has been transformed in five minutes.</v>

883
00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:29.160
<v Speaker 5>And the baptists were the people who revived baptism by total immersion in the</v>

884
00:28:29.161 --> 00:28:32.240
<v Speaker 5>16th century and probably know in,</v>

885
00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.153
<v Speaker 5>in America,</v>

886
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:37.020
<v Speaker 5>we don't hold the amount of that long cause this is post litigation now.</v>

887
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:38.190
<v Speaker 5>But you know when,</v>

888
00:28:38.191 --> 00:28:39.930
<v Speaker 5>when the Baptist first got going,</v>

889
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.600
<v Speaker 5>this idea of holding people aren't as long enough.</v>

890
00:28:42.601 --> 00:28:47.250
<v Speaker 5>All their language is the language that relates to near death experiences.</v>

891
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:51.360
<v Speaker 5>And I don't think that to start with baptism by total immersion was just</v>

892
00:28:51.361 --> 00:28:52.194
<v Speaker 5>symbolic.</v>

893
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.580
<v Speaker 5>I think it was drowning.</v>

894
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:54.811
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

895
00:28:54.811 --> 00:28:56.940
<v Speaker 5>It's a beautiful sensual ally.</v>

896
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
<v Speaker 5>And I've had to deny myself that central ally for the last three years because I</v>

897
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.460
<v Speaker 5>abused it because we want to spark up a joint right now.</v>

898
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.133
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

899
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:09.270
<v Speaker 5>want to dive in right now.</v>

900
00:29:09.271 --> 00:29:09.601
<v Speaker 5>Of course,</v>

901
00:29:09.601 --> 00:29:10.201
<v Speaker 5>the Gel,</v>

902

<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

903
00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.930
<v Speaker 5>you're like the serpent in the garden of Eden.</v>

904
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:15.750
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

905

907
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:18.511
<v Speaker 5>Why not?</v>

908
00:29:18.511 --> 00:29:19.620
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to force you into anything.</v>

909
00:29:19.621 --> 00:29:19.951
<v Speaker 5>You're not,</v>

910
00:29:19.951 --> 00:29:20.784
<v Speaker 5>you're not forcing me.</v>

911
00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.320
<v Speaker 5>An interesting mix went na na,</v>

912
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:22.591
<v Speaker 5>na,</v>

913
00:29:22.591 --> 00:29:22.741
<v Speaker 5>na,</v>

914
00:29:22.741 --> 00:29:22.951
<v Speaker 5>na,</v>

915
00:29:22.951 --> 00:29:23.241
<v Speaker 5>na that.</v>

916
00:29:23.241 --> 00:29:24.074
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go,</v>

917
00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.850
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go live on Joe Rogan.</v>

918
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:27.840
<v Speaker 5>Is that bad?</v>

919
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.171
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

920
00:29:28.171 --> 00:29:29.004
<v Speaker 5>that's not bad.</v>

921
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.181
<v Speaker 5>That's the way to do it.</v>

922
00:29:30.181 --> 00:29:31.014
<v Speaker 5>If you want to dive in,</v>

923
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.441
<v Speaker 5>we'll go.</v>

924
00:29:31.441 --> 00:29:32.250
<v Speaker 5>A little baby hit.</v>

925
00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:36.330
<v Speaker 5>So what I was getting into was,</v>

933
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.030
<v Speaker 1>That's made by American scientists and botanists.</v>

934
00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.030
<v Speaker 1>They all drive muscle cars and they do steroids.</v>

935
00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.090
<v Speaker 1>That's so familiar.</v>

936
00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.030
<v Speaker 1>That's such a nice feeling.</v>

937
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:55.120
<v Speaker 1>But do they allow like porn sites like in dorms?</v>

938
00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Can kids get download porn?</v>

939
00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:57.311

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

942
00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Jamie sent me up to go to a site no more.</v>

943
00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:02.561
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

00:30:03.941 --> 00:30:06.700
<v Speaker 1>but you could always just download it right from like a torrent.</v>

947
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Well you could just Google porn and it'll be right there.</v>

948
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

949
00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:10.623
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

950
00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:11.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

951
00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:12.184
<v Speaker 1>But I'm just wondering</v>

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:13.190
<v Speaker 2>Monday giving out tips,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know</v>

958
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:27.423
<v Speaker 2>it's right there.</v>

959
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:28.161
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

960
00:30:28.161 --> 00:30:28.994
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

961
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:32.930
<v Speaker 2>We'll know what to do it again to start all over again with Noah.</v>

962
00:30:32.931 --> 00:30:33.350
<v Speaker 2>Sam,</v>

963
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:34.010
<v Speaker 2>same deal.</v>

964
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:36.290
<v Speaker 2>And he also had all of those animals to fuck to no one.</v>

965
00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.170
<v Speaker 2>We probably couldn't fuck the animals cause he's had a fuck his kids and make</v>

966
00:30:40.171 --> 00:30:41.210
<v Speaker 2>sure it made more kids.</v>

967
00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to make people get saved?</v>

968
00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:44.481
<v Speaker 2>Those loads.</v>

969
00:30:44.481 --> 00:30:45.620
<v Speaker 2>He was 500 years old.</v>

970
00:30:45.621 --> 00:30:48.260
<v Speaker 2>I really felt that that should have been the Russell Crowe movie.</v>

971
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.250
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

972
00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:50.810
<v Speaker 2>And just him fucking his kids.</v>

973
00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:51.763
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

974
00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:56.810
<v Speaker 2>Just two hours of Russell Crowe fucking his daughter while the fucking rock</v>

975
00:30:56.811 --> 00:30:58.190
<v Speaker 2>monster's guard over them.</v>

976
00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:58.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

977
00:30:58.551 --> 00:31:00.020
<v Speaker 2>I liked the Hollywood executive with this guy.</v>

978
00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.940
<v Speaker 2>Like make me one of them kid fucking movies.</v>

979
00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.553
<v Speaker 2>Get a Bible</v>

980
00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:06.523
<v Speaker 2>lesson.</v>

981
00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:08.090
<v Speaker 2>If they have a better explanation,</v>

982
00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:09.980
<v Speaker 2>let them write the script.</v>

983
00:31:09.981 --> 00:31:11.150
<v Speaker 2>Hire a couple of Jews,</v>

984
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:12.570
<v Speaker 2>maybe a kid fucking moving</v>

985
00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.880
<v Speaker 6>the idea of speaking about anything,</v>

986
00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:17.550
<v Speaker 6>anything and everything.</v>

987
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:18.310
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

988
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:22.890
<v Speaker 6>I think it's detrimental to not be able to talk and to have people that want to</v>

989
00:31:22.891 --> 00:31:25.890
<v Speaker 6>shut other people up based on their ideology or,</v>

990
00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:26.963
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

991
00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:28.530
<v Speaker 6>anything that they're saying.</v>

992
00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.900
<v Speaker 6>If you want to take someone off the air of shut them up,</v>

993
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:31.300
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

994
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:31.560
<v Speaker 6>or,</v>

995
00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.120
<v Speaker 6>or fire them from their job,</v>

996
00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.340
<v Speaker 6>I think that's copping out and saying,</v>

997
00:31:35.341 --> 00:31:35.551
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

998
00:31:35.551 --> 00:31:35.940
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

999
00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.850
<v Speaker 6>I can't logically argue or,</v>

1000
00:31:38.851 --> 00:31:40.260
<v Speaker 6>or intelligently argue.</v>

1001
00:31:40.261 --> 00:31:42.090
<v Speaker 6>So I just want them quiet.</v>

1002
00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:42.990
<v Speaker 6>I want them silence.</v>

1003
00:31:42.991 --> 00:31:45.360
<v Speaker 6>Don't they know that by hamstring you,</v>

1004
00:31:45.361 --> 00:31:48.690
<v Speaker 6>they fuck up their product and they open up the door to the Internet.</v>

1005
00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:49.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1006
00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:49.591
<v Speaker 6>Like the Internet.</v>

1007
00:31:49.591 --> 00:31:50.281
<v Speaker 6>It's right there.</v>

1008
00:31:50.281 --> 00:31:51.630
<v Speaker 6>It's the wolf at the door.</v>

1009
00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:52.110
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1010
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.620
<v Speaker 6>it's right there.</v>

1011
00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Right there.</v>

1012
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:54.480
<v Speaker 1>And really,</v>

1013
00:31:54.481 --> 00:31:54.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1014
00:31:54.721 --> 00:31:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I was born deaf on one side without a right or,</v>

1015
00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:58.651
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1016
00:31:58.651 --> 00:31:58.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1017
00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:02.130
<v Speaker 1>in a family that wasn't very supportive.</v>

1018
00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:03.331
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1019
00:32:03.331 --> 00:32:04.164
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1020
00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:09.090
<v Speaker 1>I thought that success was going to be the key to contentment and happiness.</v>

1021
00:32:09.091 --> 00:32:13.860
<v Speaker 1>And like a lot of other people thankfully became successful only to find out</v>

1022
00:32:13.861 --> 00:32:15.600
<v Speaker 1>that didn't change anything.</v>

1023
00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.090
<v Speaker 1>And then the struggle becomes,</v>

1024
00:32:18.091 --> 00:32:18.660
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1025
00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.100
<v Speaker 1>what's it gonna take to be happy?</v>

1026
00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:22.680
<v Speaker 1>The most I ever offered a sex worker was,</v>

1027
00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:23.933
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1028

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:25.703
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't,</v>

1030
00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:27.001
<v Speaker 1>this is a,</v>

1031
00:32:27.001 --> 00:32:28.260
<v Speaker 1>this is some vampire shit.</v>

1032
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:31.020
<v Speaker 1>This is like when someone's not a sex worker.</v>

1033
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1034
00:32:31.441 --> 00:32:31.801

1035
00:32:31.801 --> 00:32:32.220

1039
00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Like I have no desire to fuck you and you're really,</v>

1040
00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:39.980

<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1044
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:42.584
<v Speaker 5>So since,</v>

1045
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:44.360
<v Speaker 5>since I'm not denying any of that,</v>

1046
00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:46.820

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:49.550
<v Speaker 5>Like this isn't a joke.</v>

1049
00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:50.690

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.233
<v Speaker 5>Did you say that to her?</v>

1058
00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.800
<v Speaker 5>So she's doesn't believe me.</v>

1059
00:32:58.340 --> 00:32:59.720

1071
00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.580
<v Speaker 5>She calls me two months later.</v>

1072
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:11.443

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:27.400
<v Speaker 5>I offered you 10 grand when I was horniest.</v>

1089
00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:28.260
<v Speaker 5>Then I was like,</v>

1090
00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.120
<v Speaker 5>I was playing a game and I wanted it that bad.</v>

1091
00:33:30.121 --> 00:33:30.570
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1092
00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:31.440
<v Speaker 5>when you said no,</v>

1093
00:33:31.441 --> 00:33:32.274
<v Speaker 5>it's five grand.</v>

1094
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:33.810
<v Speaker 5>What'd she say that she said,</v>

1095
00:33:33.811 --> 00:33:34.680
<v Speaker 5>go fuck yourself.</v>

1096
00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.000
<v Speaker 5>Then she didn't have no,</v>

1097
00:33:36.001 --> 00:33:39.510
<v Speaker 5>then she called me back and then she came and she fucked me and then she didn't</v>

1098
00:33:39.511 --> 00:33:42.000
<v Speaker 5>take the money and she left and I thought she forgot.</v>

1099
00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:42.271
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

1100
00:33:42.271 --> 00:33:43.104
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1101
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.580
<v Speaker 5>you didn't take the money and still on the thing.</v>

1102
00:33:44.581 --> 00:33:44.911
<v Speaker 5>She said,</v>

1103
00:33:44.911 --> 00:33:45.744
<v Speaker 5>go fuck yourself.</v>

1104
00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:48.660
<v Speaker 5>And then we have a weird,</v>

1105
00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.640
<v Speaker 5>and we still fuck now we have a weird relationship.</v>

1106
00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:54.150
<v Speaker 5>The record at its core is about love.</v>

1107
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:54.840
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1108
00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.150
<v Speaker 5>being like this one universal truth.</v>

1109
00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.060
<v Speaker 5>You get a lot of people look to religion.</v>

1110
00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:03.540
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people look to drugs and I'm not saying you can't get really spiritual</v>

1111
00:34:03.541 --> 00:34:05.100
<v Speaker 5>experiences from all of those things,</v>

1112
00:34:05.101 --> 00:34:10.101
<v Speaker 5>but I think love at the end of the day is the one thing that really I've ever</v>

1113
00:34:10.321 --> 00:34:13.560
<v Speaker 5>found forced me to want to wake up and really try to be a better human being</v>

1114
00:34:13.561 --> 00:34:14.160
<v Speaker 5>every day.</v>

1115
00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:14.940
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1116
00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:18.880
<v Speaker 5>So that was the main point of the album and the turtles thing was just kind of,</v>

1117
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:22.920
<v Speaker 5>it's a way of saying if you get into an argument with somebody and you realize</v>

1118
00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:24.780
<v Speaker 5>it's just pointless and you're going back and forth,</v>

1119
00:34:24.781 --> 00:34:27.690
<v Speaker 5>it's turtles all the way down because like nobody really knows shit,</v>

1120
00:34:27.691 --> 00:34:28.524
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1121
00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.360
<v Speaker 5>And we're all just trying to not kill each other.</v>

1122
00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:33.030
<v Speaker 5>So I don't know,</v>

1123
00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:35.790
<v Speaker 5>I decided it would make a good country song.</v>

1124
00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Didn't you have like plans on being some sort of a marine biologist or something</v>

1125
00:34:40.161 --> 00:34:40.671
<v Speaker 1>at some point?</v>

1126
00:34:40.671 --> 00:34:41.440
