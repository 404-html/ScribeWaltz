<v Speaker 1>He's one of those guys have constantly changes.</v>

23
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Smart businessman.</v>

<v Speaker 1>smart.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Smartest.</v>

28
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.890
<v Speaker 1>He's the best shit talker and the history of combat sports.</v>

29
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.070
<v Speaker 1>Before that it was like chill son and,</v>

30
00:00:46.071 --> 00:00:48.180
<v Speaker 1>and Muhammad Ali and now it's kind of aggressive.</v>

31
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.340
<v Speaker 1>He just knows how to fucking say it.</v>

32
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Stevens starts talking and he goes,</v>

33
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.070
<v Speaker 1>the guy just destroyed them with one sentence.</v>

34
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:00.190
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

35
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>he finds the perfect shit.</v>

36
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.570
<v Speaker 1>The way he looked back.</v>

37
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.920
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

38
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean when he went in there and I related Eddie Alvarez like that,</v>

39
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.613
<v Speaker 1>you just kind of go,</v>

40
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

41
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.233
<v Speaker 1>fuck you man.</v>

42
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

43
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.800
<v Speaker 1>He's any of that style of sliding out and sliding in.</v>

44
00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:20.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a very unusual,</v>

45
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>almost a karate based style.</v>

46
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.080
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

47
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.910
<v Speaker 1>And I went to like sitting down on vicious punches on the end of it,</v>

48
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.681
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

50
00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:27.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.820
<v Speaker 1>his stamps and because she's just softball.</v>

52
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:30.141
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

53
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:30.691
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

54
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:30.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:31.080
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

56
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.950
<v Speaker 1>with the Aldo,</v>

57
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 1>if I was all those coach a year ago already,</v>

58
00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>I would have said we got to tray South Pole and go because there's no way he can</v>

59
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>block those low kicks,</v>

60
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.070
<v Speaker 1>his left low kicks Gump.</v>

61
00:01:41.071 --> 00:01:44.430
<v Speaker 1>There's no way he can block them because his stance is too white and his knees</v>

62
00:01:44.431 --> 00:01:45.880
<v Speaker 1>are pointing inside to the shadow.</v>

63
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 1>The chem 100% of that is the whole game changes the whole game.</v>

64
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.050
<v Speaker 1>And his left low kicked by the way,</v>

65
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.381
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

66
00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:57.180
<v Speaker 1>although could kick the fuck out of you with either low low kicks her right.</v>

67
00:01:57.181 --> 00:01:58.014
<v Speaker 1>Wow Man.</v>

68
00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

69
00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.381
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

70
00:01:59.381 --> 00:01:59.560
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

71
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.140
<v Speaker 1>he always made me think it for Ramon Dekkers that explosive.</v>

72
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.711
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

73
00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:05.380
<v Speaker 1>His law will,</v>

74
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Speaker 1>they'd call the Duchy left to the body and then right leg kick behind it.</v>

75
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.131
<v Speaker 1>Chad Mendez.</v>

76
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:11.461
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

77
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Woo though.</v>

78
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 1>He throws it man.</v>

79
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.320
<v Speaker 1>I think Aldo and Max Holloway a very interesting fight.</v>

80
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>It has to happen.</v>

81
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:25.080
<v Speaker 1>I keep hearing all this crazy shit like all my go up and fight a bead for the</v>

82
00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:26.910
<v Speaker 1>interim title and I'm like,</v>

83
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:27.601
<v Speaker 1>God damn it.</v>

84
00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:28.600
<v Speaker 1>You got to have money.</v>

85
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Why don't I,</v>

86
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.740
<v Speaker 1>well there we go again.</v>

87
00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:31.981
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

88
00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:35.770
<v Speaker 1>The money wait fights everyone already even that talked about</v>

89
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.370
<v Speaker 1>away instead of staying in their way instead of defending the title,</v>

90
00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:42.204
<v Speaker 1>they old.</v>

91
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.070
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously not as big a fight.</v>

92
00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Is Him Fighting Nemo Grumet off in Russia though,</v>

93
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.003
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

94
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Especially if they fight for a 55 pound title.</v>

95
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>If nerveracking Madoff fights in Russia,</v>

96
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.970
<v Speaker 1>they might have to fucking build a new soccer state yet.</v>

97
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people understand.</v>

98
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Anytime I post something on Instagram,</v>

99
00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:03.170
<v Speaker 1>I get 150 fucking Russian dudes who write Habib time and then they just pulled a</v>

100
00:03:03.171 --> 00:03:04.140

102
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:09.630

103
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:10.461
<v Speaker 1>Say Habib time.</v>

104
00:03:10.461 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 1>Habib Tom [inaudible] fucking just for safety when they're building that thing.</v>

105
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:18.961
<v Speaker 1>Make an underground tunnel when he loses Kop we straight to the airport sites.</v>

106
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.023
<v Speaker 1>Connor,</v>

107
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.670
<v Speaker 1>you know what's interesting about the Conor fight man lock Habib Time Habib Tom</v>

108
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.700
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>

109
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.981
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

110
00:03:25.981 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

111
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 1>He's not fucking around.</v>

112
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:27.994
<v Speaker 1>It's all true.</v>

113
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.051
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

114
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

115
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 1>if he fights Connor,</v>

116
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.971
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

117
00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 1>Michael Johnson cracked him and rocked him.</v>

118
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

119
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.250
<v Speaker 1>oh boy.</v>

120
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.193
<v Speaker 1>Did he get it?</v>

121
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.481
<v Speaker 1>He did get angry.</v>

122
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 1>He beat the fuck out of them yet.</v>

123
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.430
<v Speaker 1>But the point is he got hurt.</v>

124
00:03:40.431 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 1>He got hurt.</v>

125
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 1>And if Connor catches you like that,</v>

126
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>you might be fucking Donesville.</v>

127
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

128
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 1>He might drop some hammers on you and that might be the same thing,</v>

129
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.710
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

130
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.430
<v Speaker 1>The uh,</v>

131
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:52.470
<v Speaker 1>we seen caught or as well at times it's just,</v>

133
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.281
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

134
00:03:53.281 --> 00:03:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Ben,</v>

135
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Ben Shahn Habib's defense,</v>

136
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 1>we saw Conor get rocked against Nate and he wound up losing that fight.</v>

137
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Shortly thereafter.</v>

138
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Habib got rocked and it's Michael Johnson back.</v>

139
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Came back stronger.</v>

140
00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

141
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Dominated him.</v>

142
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 1>So it was the only time,</v>

143
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

144
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:07.150
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

145
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.010
<v Speaker 1>when you see a guy who his dominant is a B,</v>

146
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.720
<v Speaker 1>you start looking for weaknesses in his arm.</v>

147
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:12.490
<v Speaker 1>It's the only time we've seen any weakness at all.</v>

148
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.770
