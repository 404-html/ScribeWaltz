<v Speaker 1>I don't get paid for him.</v>

7
00:00:09.331 --> 00:00:10.020
<v Speaker 1>The guy just said,</v>

8
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.690
<v Speaker 1>we live who live ladies and mother fucking gentlemen.</v>

9
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>This is a fight companion podcast.</v>

10
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:16.350
<v Speaker 1>What that means is we're watching the fights.</v>

11
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>This was supposed to be the heavyweight title fight and I was supposed to be in</v>

12
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Vegas.</v>

13
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.830
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be for BC over doom versus Cain Velasquez.</v>

14
00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:24.720
<v Speaker 1>But Cain Velasquez got hurt.</v>

15
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

16
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>and he pulled out of the fight and then steep meo chick replaced him.</v>

17
00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 1>And then [inaudible] said,</v>

18
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>well I'm hurt too.</v>

19
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:31.674
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this.</v>

20
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>And he pulled out,</v>

21
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:34.220
<v Speaker 1>cause I guess he had a couple of injuries.</v>

22
00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:34.831
<v Speaker 1>Smart move.</v>

23
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:36.030
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you're injured,</v>

24
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to fight cane no matter what I guess.</v>

28
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>And then when,</v>

29
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:40.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

30
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>when he found out I was Mijo chickies like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Fuck this smart move.</v>

34
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

35
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.910
<v Speaker 1>because usually you do it.</v>

36
00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:49.190
<v Speaker 1>This is before we go ahead and have it,</v>

37
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.501
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

38
00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:52.530
<v Speaker 1>this is a fight companion podcast is not a regular podcast.</v>

39
00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>So we're watching the fights.</v>

40
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 1>But honestly,</v>

41
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>it's almost never us watching the fights.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's kids funny how guys don't change my son.</v>

73
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.700
<v Speaker 1>I went hiking with him and all he was talking about for two days is I want you</v>

74
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:55.440
<v Speaker 1>to teach me how to chop down a tree.</v>

75
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.061
<v Speaker 1>He's obsessed.</v>

76
00:01:57.061 --> 00:01:57.481
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

77
00:01:57.481 --> 00:01:57.861
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

78
00:01:57.861 --> 00:01:58.070
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

79
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.560
<v Speaker 1>but I need to chop a tree down and constantly go and we call it quote unquote</v>

80
00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:02.480
<v Speaker 1>tropic tree none.</v>

81
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>And I get him a hatchet.</v>

82
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't put that hatchet down.</v>

83
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>You give that kid any kind of a weapon.</v>

84
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.180
<v Speaker 1>My daughter looks at the hatchet like,</v>

85
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.080
<v Speaker 1>what is going to,</v>

86
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe I can decorate it.</v>

87
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 1>She wanted to know.</v>

88
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>She wanted to put sparkles on the handle.</v>

89
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:15.661
<v Speaker 1>And my son was like,</v>

90
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:16.290
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

91
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.101
<v Speaker 1>You know what's interesting?</v>

92
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:19.440
<v Speaker 1>You say gay men can go one of two ways.</v>

93
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.850
<v Speaker 1>They can go towards like girly type stuff or they can go just as manly.</v>

94
00:02:24.851 --> 00:02:25.880
<v Speaker 1>We talked about how to be assigned,</v>

95
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>talking about the beers.</v>

96
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Well there's just not even know.</v>

97
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like two different styles of gay men.</v>

98
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.170
<v Speaker 1>Like I've a gay couple that lives on my street stud.</v>

99
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Nicest fucking dudes.</v>

100
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.570
<v Speaker 1>There's so nice.</v>

101
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.610
<v Speaker 1>And one of them is the man.</v>

102
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.881
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

103
00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 1>he's into trucks.</v>

104
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

105
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.621
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

106
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:40.860
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

107
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>and it makes all the cash.</v>

108
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.740
<v Speaker 1>You can break it down to one,</v>

109
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.430
<v Speaker 1>one to be talked trucks.</v>

110
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.870
<v Speaker 1>You can break it down.</v>

111
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.703
<v Speaker 1>One Guy,</v>

112
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.770
<v Speaker 1>one fox guys and the other doesn't,</v>

113
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.671
<v Speaker 1>well I don't know.</v>

114
00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:54.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that works.</v>

115
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't get personal with them.</v>

116
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.430
<v Speaker 1>They're just the coolest motherfucker.</v>

117
00:02:57.431 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>It'd be the best neighbors.</v>

118
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

119
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Come to wipe that and I get personal with them.</v>

120
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.543
<v Speaker 1>But then there's,</v>

121
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.590
<v Speaker 1>then there's like the twinks who are there.</v>

122
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 1>They're super girly.</v>

123
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Then why would you want to just be with a girl?</v>

124
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:10.181
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

125
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Or like the lesbians.</v>

126
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.970
<v Speaker 1>Well how come some dude's like girls?</v>

127
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>A big acid.</v>

128
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.991
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>

129
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:14.561
<v Speaker 1>some girls,</v>

130
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>dude's like girls are really skinny.</v>

131
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>Everyone likes a girl with a big band.</v>

132
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Like there's some guys that are into like really skinny girls,</v>

133
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.330
<v Speaker 1>like really skinny model type girls with no acid.</v>

134
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I none of my friends,</v>

135
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 1>it's all over the map that it's a good way to put it.</v>

136
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 1>It's all over the map.</v>

137
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.540
<v Speaker 1>He said the truck tried to talk fucking suspension shit.</v>

138
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 1>My heart,</v>

139
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.351
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

140
00:03:36.351 --> 00:03:37.010
<v Speaker 1>see you later.</v>

141
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.250
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

142
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.991
<v Speaker 1>sucks days.</v>

143
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Husband is actually in the trucks too,</v>

144
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 1>so it's weird.</v>

145
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 1>But the point being is like,</v>

146
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 1>they're very different personalities that are gay.</v>

147
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:47.980

<v Speaker 1>just to let you know,</v>

198
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:11.260
<v Speaker 1>most gay guys don't fuck each other in the ass.</v>

199
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Like we're married,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he was being honest.</v>

218
00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:35.141

<v Speaker 2>Well of course you definitely need it when you hit for so long.</v>

274
00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.810
<v Speaker 2>40 and think how long he's been fighting.</v>

275
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.510
<v Speaker 2>He's been fighting for a long time and he's taken some,</v>

276
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:03.530
<v Speaker 2>some hard shots.</v>

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.530
<v Speaker 2>A few other guys too.</v>

281
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.750
<v Speaker 2>He's a tough fucking smart dude though.</v>

282
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 2>He's his skill levels very high,</v>

283
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 2>but you know there's a reality.</v>

284
00:07:16.461 --> 00:07:19.700
<v Speaker 2>This is a goddamn difference between a 21 year old body,</v>

285
00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:22.400
<v Speaker 2>a natural one and a natural 40 year old body.</v>

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:27.710
<v Speaker 2>He's a savage man.</v>

290
00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:32.650
<v Speaker 2>About 10 years ago we did a movie together were extras and it will be called a</v>

291
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.610

292
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.940
<v Speaker 2>We play like I'm 35 years old and I'm playing a fraternity guy and it was</v>

293
00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:41.120
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>

294
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.661
<v Speaker 2>It was terrible.</v>

295
00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:42.550
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

298
00:07:46.731 --> 00:07:48.050
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen anybody.</v>

299
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.460
<v Speaker 2>We went to a club that night.</v>

300
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.380
<v Speaker 2>Afterwards he went into a club,</v>

303
00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.030
<v Speaker 2>We went back to the hotel and he handled business.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've never seen anybody get down like let's be real careful with those kinds of</v>

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.160
<v Speaker 2>You can't say you do that anymore.</v>

321
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.160
<v Speaker 2>It used to be that that was like an old movie trick.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Curls like the giant,</v>

392
00:10:19.681 --> 00:10:21.450
<v Speaker 1>like a guy who's been through some danger.</v>

393
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.580
<v Speaker 1>They don't like a guy who was terrified of danger.</v>

394
00:10:23.581 --> 00:10:25.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural instinctive reaction.</v>

395
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.030
<v Speaker 1>It's to protect your genetics.</v>

396
00:10:27.031 --> 00:10:31.050
<v Speaker 1>A guy who has never experienced danger may very well fall apart in the face of</v>

397
00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:31.800
<v Speaker 1>danger.</v>

398
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.700
<v Speaker 1>So a guy who does crazy shit like does flips in bikes.</v>

399
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think they do that?</v>

400
00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:40.650
<v Speaker 1>They do that because it attracts females because females are attracted to a guy</v>

401
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.060
<v Speaker 1>who's very risky.</v>

402
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.200
<v Speaker 1>The guy who takes chances and does nutty shit because those guys can survive</v>

403
00:10:46.201 --> 00:10:46.980
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>

404
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:47.700
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

405
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying with all the UFC fighters,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the waitress at the,</v>

437
00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:32.791
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

438
00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:35.830
<v Speaker 1>the waiters [inaudible] one of the waitresses at the cottonwood.</v>

439
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.870
<v Speaker 1>How about nothing?</v>

440
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.793
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

441
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.970
<v Speaker 1>what's a 10 Jovan?</v>

442
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:42.721
<v Speaker 1>He's up there.</v>

443
00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Saatchi not lesson.</v>

444
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

445
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.290
<v Speaker 1>you're being kind of chops and a good looking at,</v>

446
00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.280
<v Speaker 1>he's got personality.</v>

447
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Personality means more than two points.</v>

448
00:11:52.321 --> 00:11:53.500
<v Speaker 1>It does an eight.</v>

449
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:53.891
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

450
00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:54.724
<v Speaker 1>Alan Japan.</v>

451
00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:56.140
<v Speaker 1>Lord,</v>

452
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.340
<v Speaker 1>that's not even a real person.</v>

453
00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Tell me he should at least tell me.</v>

454
00:11:58.681 --> 00:12:00.460
<v Speaker 1>It's five [inaudible] eight tall,</v>

455
00:12:00.461 --> 00:12:01.294
<v Speaker 1>six feet.</v>

456
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.180
<v Speaker 1>He just did the campaign for an equinox.</v>

457
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Alan Joe Ban Hater.</v>

458
00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:10.720
<v Speaker 1>You fucking hate people because he's one of the best people I've ever met.</v>

459
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.501
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

460
00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:12.311
<v Speaker 1>Just a great,</v>

461
00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:12.921
<v Speaker 1>great dude.</v>

462
00:12:12.921 --> 00:12:13.960
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking great guy.</v>

463
00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Can't say anything bad about them.</v>

464
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:15.941
<v Speaker 1>If I look like that,</v>

465
00:12:15.941 --> 00:12:17.260
<v Speaker 1>I'd wake up every morning and be like,</v>

466
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.550
<v Speaker 1>this going to be a good day.</v>

467
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.391
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you though.</v>

468
00:12:19.391 --> 00:12:20.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's not a pretty boy.</v>

469
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:25.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean this mother fuckers and scrap some serious fights and he bites down on</v>

470
00:12:25.241 --> 00:12:26.074
<v Speaker 1>that mouthpiece.</v>

471
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.863
<v Speaker 1>Very good fighter.</v>

472
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:32.320
<v Speaker 1>He fought to men off man to man off is a mother fucker dude motherfucker.</v>

473
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.350
<v Speaker 1>I just liked that match up.</v>

474
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.520
<v Speaker 1>His efficiency and his stroke is a tough fight for anybody.</v>

475
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Especially tough fight when you start.</v>

476
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.940
<v Speaker 1>He cut week two weeks but no,</v>

477
00:12:39.941 --> 00:12:40.960
<v Speaker 1>he got knocked out in the first round.</v>

478
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.071
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

479
00:12:41.071 --> 00:12:41.170
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

480
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:41.350
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

481
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying not the result.</v>

482
00:12:43.301 --> 00:12:44.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying on paper.</v>

483
00:12:44.201 --> 00:12:45.370
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough fight to pick.</v>

484
00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:47.230
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have taken it and if I,</v>

485
00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:47.910
<v Speaker 1>if I was in there,</v>

486
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:51.160
<v Speaker 1>if I'm Joe man and I just [inaudible] I wouldn't have taken it.</v>

487
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.830
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have taken it because I don't think,</v>

488
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:54.371
<v Speaker 1>it's not that.</v>

489
00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:55.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he could beat that guy.</v>

490
00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:00.870
<v Speaker 1>I just think right now men off striking is so smooth and efficient and heavy and</v>

491
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.370
<v Speaker 1>down the pipe string.</v>

492
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.490
<v Speaker 1>It's also very fluid.</v>

493
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Like he can go from throwing a jab to throw in a lead up or cut in a straight</v>

494
00:13:11.621 --> 00:13:14.740
<v Speaker 1>right hand and every one of them is perfect and they count,</v>

495
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:15.821
<v Speaker 1>they count,</v>

496
00:13:15.821 --> 00:13:19.720
<v Speaker 1>they're accurate and the mechanics behind them are totally Crary.</v>

497
00:13:19.721 --> 00:13:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

498
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Like there's guys that probably hit harder.</v>

499
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Like Tyron Woodley probably hits harder than anybody.</v>

500
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.370
<v Speaker 1>Tyron Woodley like one shot for one shot.</v>

501
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Like when when he KLJ heroin,</v>

502
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:30.161
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

503
00:13:30.161 --> 00:13:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

504
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.610
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't explode.</v>

505
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Exploder dude,</v>

506
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.850
<v Speaker 1>if he catches you perfectly on that explosion,</v>

507
00:13:36.851 --> 00:13:37.684
<v Speaker 1>he's going to put you away.</v>

508
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.650
<v Speaker 1>And it's not saying that like his efficiency is bad cause efficiencies way</v>

509
00:13:41.651 --> 00:13:46.540
<v Speaker 1>better even now because he's training with Duke Roufus but to Nofx doesn't have</v>

510
00:13:46.541 --> 00:13:48.850
<v Speaker 1>that one shot power that Woodley has,</v>

511
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.980
<v Speaker 1>but his efficiency is perfect.</v>

512
00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Everything is perfect.</v>

513
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.910
<v Speaker 1>You see a guy that hits hard,</v>

514
00:13:54.911 --> 00:13:57.640
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you see almost invariably is there.</v>

515
00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Their body positioning is always perfect.</v>

516
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Like when when a guy's throwing like a ridiculous punch,</v>

517
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.260
<v Speaker 1>you'll see the bend in the legs,</v>

518
00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:06.710
<v Speaker 1>you'll see the term body.</v>

519
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.790
<v Speaker 1>You know when a guy's like a serious power Stryker with two Manav,</v>

520
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.810
<v Speaker 1>everything's in place.</v>

521
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.000
<v Speaker 1>It's all like the knees in the right spot.</v>

522
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:13.990
<v Speaker 1>When the hook,</v>

523
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.830
<v Speaker 1>when he's throwing the hook,</v>

524
00:14:14.831 --> 00:14:15.830
<v Speaker 1>his foot's in the right spots,</v>

525
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.080
<v Speaker 1>waits in the right spot.</v>

526
00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:18.280
<v Speaker 1>There's no like,</v>

527
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:19.460
<v Speaker 1>no bullshit.</v>

528
00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Then he'd come out of the Russian amateur boxing his thing.</v>

529
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.310
<v Speaker 1>He's a master of sports and boxing.</v>

530
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.420
<v Speaker 1>They keep fucking kicked too,</v>

531
00:14:25.421 --> 00:14:25.751
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

532
00:14:25.751 --> 00:14:27.470
<v Speaker 1>He can Kish there was amazing.</v>

533
00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Here's a program.</v>

534
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:28.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

535
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:29.110
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

536
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.750
<v Speaker 1>he's unexpectedly dangerous with his kicks,</v>

537
00:14:31.751 --> 00:14:33.050
<v Speaker 1>but he lost his last fight.</v>

538
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:33.970
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>

539
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:34.151
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

540
00:14:34.151 --> 00:14:36.270
<v Speaker 1>he beat a lark and that's right.</v>

541
00:14:36.271 --> 00:14:37.390
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't a great course.</v>

542
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.700
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a great fight.</v>

543
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.950
<v Speaker 1>I love that fight really so close because they're so dangerous.</v>

544
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.090
<v Speaker 1>We do a fight campaigning for that.</v>

545
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:43.991
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

546
00:14:43.991 --> 00:14:44.870
<v Speaker 1>This was the one with Lorens.</v>

547
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:46.210
<v Speaker 1>Lark was throwing those wheel kits.</v>

548
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:47.351
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

549
00:14:47.351 --> 00:14:48.820
<v Speaker 1>And Feminine Up is fucked up,</v>

550
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 1>but to Nauv hung in there to the</v>

551
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.830
<v Speaker 2>end and one is super close fight.</v>

552
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.800
<v Speaker 2>I honestly thought that Larkin pulled it off,</v>

553
00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.090
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't upset at the decisions are so close.</v>

554
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:01.850
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird.</v>

555
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Those does low.</v>

556
00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:03.201
<v Speaker 2>We'll kicks.</v>

557
00:15:03.201 --> 00:15:04.060
<v Speaker 2>He does all kinds of weird,</v>

558
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.080
<v Speaker 2>skewed is a bad mother fucker dude.</v>

559
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.780
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the dark horses in that division.</v>

560
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:09.740
<v Speaker 2>His take down defense.</v>

561
00:15:09.741 --> 00:15:11.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm till I haven't seen anything like in a long time.</v>

562
00:15:11.601 --> 00:15:13.670
<v Speaker 2>He came up to rain to train with Munios.</v>

563
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.220
<v Speaker 2>Pat comes and myself and his wrestling day.</v>

564
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:16.851
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

565
00:15:16.851 --> 00:15:16.971
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

566
00:15:16.971 --> 00:15:18.260
<v Speaker 2>we're just going to take this full down.</v>

567
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:22.210
<v Speaker 2>Well I don't want to take it up by really large was going to have the Kiki and</v>

568
00:15:22.211 --> 00:15:23.080
<v Speaker 2>advantage in two minutes.</v>

569
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.130
<v Speaker 2>It's going to have the striking advantage and that's how it turned out.</v>

570
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.680
<v Speaker 2>But God damn was a close ass fight.</v>

571
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Laura Larkin actually has braces and during the fight is fucking braces were</v>

572
00:15:32.391 --> 00:15:33.590
<v Speaker 2>sticking into his mouth.</v>

573
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:34.311
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

574
00:15:34.311 --> 00:15:35.990
<v Speaker 2>If something went wrong with his braces,</v>

575
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.570
<v Speaker 2>he was like trying to fix it in between rounds.</v>

576
00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:39.710
<v Speaker 2>Fucking Ufo with brace.</v>

577
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.820
<v Speaker 2>He shouldn't be fighting with braces or Invisalign and he's very good looking</v>

578
00:15:43.821 --> 00:15:44.320

669
00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:47.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

672
00:17:47.991 --> 00:17:49.010
<v Speaker 2>He does everything.</v>

673
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.760
<v Speaker 2>He's big in the IOWASCA.</v>

674
00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.113
<v Speaker 1>Thomas was like,</v>

675
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.393
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

676
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:54.810
<v Speaker 1>I was under the impression.</v>

677
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:55.981
<v Speaker 1>Just started.</v>

678
00:17:55.981 --> 00:17:57.060
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean like,</v>

679
00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.680
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's the week before he did a bunch of uh,</v>

680
00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Wasco and then flop pat.</v>

681
00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.471
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

682
00:18:02.471 --> 00:18:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Molly walked by Pat I had is a mother corner pattern that fight pat Cummings is</v>

683
00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:08.130
<v Speaker 1>a motherfucker.</v>

684
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Look how smart Mike Pilot.</v>

685
00:18:09.351 --> 00:18:10.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like Oh,</v>

686
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:11.820
<v Speaker 1>efficient and smooth,</v>

687
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:12.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

688
00:18:12.571 --> 00:18:14.250
<v Speaker 1>sees the shots he slips him like,</v>

689
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.810
<v Speaker 1>and he's in real good shape.</v>

690
00:18:15.811 --> 00:18:16.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean don't get me wrong,</v>

691
00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:20.340
<v Speaker 1>but that's just a reality about what a 40 year old body can do as far as the way</v>

692
00:18:20.341 --> 00:18:21.330
<v Speaker 1>he pushes himself.</v>

693
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Like that was what recovery and stuff are Nard Hopkins back.</v>

694
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.591
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

695
00:18:25.591 --> 00:18:29.960
<v Speaker 1>like Bernard Hopkins just couldn't keep a pace with a guy like surrogate Kovalev</v>

696
00:18:29.961 --> 00:18:30.070
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

697
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Like he had to go and do like a defensive mode against him.</v>

698
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:33.270
<v Speaker 1>It was tough to watch,</v>

699
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.820
<v Speaker 1>but it was because he was 49 years old.</v>

700
00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.510
<v Speaker 1>If he fought Kovalev when he was 35 Holy Shit.</v>

701
00:18:39.511 --> 00:18:40.870
<v Speaker 1>That would have been an amazing fight.</v>

702
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:41.430
<v Speaker 1>Fight,</v>

703
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.781
<v Speaker 1>amaze.</v>

704
00:18:41.781 --> 00:18:43.650
<v Speaker 1>You see Cole of less white dude.</v>

705
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:44.461
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

706
00:18:44.461 --> 00:18:45.570
<v Speaker 1>He's a murderer.</v>

707
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Him and at him and Andre Ward.</v>

708
00:18:47.641 --> 00:18:48.270
<v Speaker 1>That's the fight.</v>

709
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.500
<v Speaker 1>He killed the guy in the ring.</v>

710
00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:49.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

711
00:18:49.681 --> 00:18:50.460
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>

712
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.170
<v Speaker 1>And it didn't kill the guy.</v>

713
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

714
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.570
<v Speaker 1>It didn't affect him the way it affects most people.</v>

715
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:55.530
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting.</v>

716
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:56.710
<v Speaker 1>I get it hurted Russia.</v>

717
00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:57.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

718
00:18:57.061 --> 00:19:00.240
<v Speaker 1>It didn't take anything off of his desire to compete does not give a fuck.</v>

719
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:00.540
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

720
00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.051
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

721
00:19:01.051 --> 00:19:04.380
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing that happens to fight or sometimes and man,</v>

722
00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:04.900
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

723
00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.840
<v Speaker 1>they're rarely the same after someone dies.</v>

724
00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Zany.</v>

725

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

730
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Emil Griffith's they say was gay and that Benny Perez,</v>

731
00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.840
<v Speaker 1>the guy who was fighting was talking to a lot of shit about him being gay and</v>

732
00:19:18.841 --> 00:19:23.841

<v Speaker 1>he died him to death.</v>

737
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:27.303
<v Speaker 1>They beat him to death.</v>

738
00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:28.863
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

742
00:19:32.251 --> 00:19:33.690
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it was like the 14th round,</v>

743
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.250
<v Speaker 1>there's a documentary on boom,</v>

761
00:19:55.681 --> 00:19:55.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

762
00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.990
<v Speaker 1>his dad was his coach.</v>

763
00:19:58.550 --> 00:19:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

764
00:19:59.010 --> 00:19:59.840
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

765
00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Uh Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

766
00:20:01.711 --> 00:20:02.241
<v Speaker 1>Summer man.</v>

767
00:20:02.241 --> 00:20:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Well that was another extreme.</v>

768
00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Dehydration fight.</v>

769
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Extremely dehydrated.</v>

770
00:20:06.541 --> 00:20:07.540
<v Speaker 1>You get down to one 35.</v>

771
00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:07.650
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

772
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:08.950
<v Speaker 1>shit was on national TV.</v>

773
00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.580
<v Speaker 1>He also had weigh ins the day of the fights.</v>

774
00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:12.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible idea.</v>

775
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.411
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>

776
00:20:13.411 --> 00:20:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Somebody did something I read and I don't know if it's true,</v>

777
00:20:15.241 --> 00:20:19.080
<v Speaker 1>but they said that pretty sure I remember a number of people who've died in the</v>

778
00:20:19.081 --> 00:20:20.640
<v Speaker 1>ring had dad's for their coach,</v>

779
00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:21.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

780
00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.113
<v Speaker 1>don't push themselves.</v>

781
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:23.783
<v Speaker 1>They're not a lot.</v>

782
00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.080
<v Speaker 1>But apparently that's,</v>

783
00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.990
<v Speaker 1>it's very common for guys to push themselves to,</v>

784
00:20:27.991 --> 00:20:30.270
<v Speaker 1>they get really hurt because their dad's in the corner.</v>

785
00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:30.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

786
00:20:30.601 --> 00:20:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Wonderboy Thompson is trained by his dad,</v>

787
00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:33.970

788
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:34.230

791
00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.120
<v Speaker 1>And so sage,</v>

792
00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:36.500
<v Speaker 1>sage,</v>

793
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.240
<v Speaker 1>Northcutts Dad,</v>

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.133
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

795
00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.940
<v Speaker 1>he's been Darren Cruickshank trained by his dad.</v>

796
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.710
<v Speaker 1>You think sage is,</v>

797
00:20:43.711 --> 00:20:44.544
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

798
00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.120
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

799
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.490
<v Speaker 1>all the flak he's getting on the Internet is just,</v>

800
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:49.360
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about that?</v>

801
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:49.661
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

802
00:20:49.661 --> 00:20:50.021
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

803
00:20:50.021 --> 00:20:52.360
<v Speaker 1>I think like if you ask any fighter,</v>

804
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:52.871
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

805
00:20:52.871 --> 00:20:55.390
<v Speaker 1>if Dane off do you 1440 going to take it at 19.</v>

806
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:56.223
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yes.</v>

807
00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.071
<v Speaker 1>It's not his fault.</v>

808
00:20:57.071 --> 00:20:58.060
<v Speaker 1>This whole hype machine.</v>

809
00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Well you know what man,</v>

810
00:20:59.200 --> 00:20:59.980
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

811
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:03.070
<v Speaker 1>it was a good fight for him to experience,</v>

812
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:03.640
<v Speaker 1>to learn.</v>

813
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.770
<v Speaker 1>That's all he needs to learn some,</v>

814
00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:06.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

815
00:21:06.161 --> 00:21:08.380
<v Speaker 1>some ground defense and he needs to learn some Jujitsu,</v>

816
00:21:08.381 --> 00:21:09.700
<v Speaker 1>but that's to be expected.</v>

817
00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:11.880
<v Speaker 1>He's only fucking 19 years old Jim.</v>

818
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:13.280
<v Speaker 1>All the top guys that are good at you get,</v>

819
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:13.960
<v Speaker 1>I get caught.</v>

820
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.250
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the best thing to happen to.</v>

821
00:21:15.251 --> 00:21:19.330
<v Speaker 1>Sky's the limit though as far as he's essential at 19 years of agency to have a</v>

822
00:21:19.331 --> 00:21:20.350
<v Speaker 1>very good attitude.</v>

823
00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.720
<v Speaker 1>He's a smart kid at like athletically.</v>

824
00:21:22.721 --> 00:21:23.680
<v Speaker 1>He's ridiculous.</v>

825
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Fucking,</v>

826
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.100
<v Speaker 1>if you see those flush front flips,</v>

827
00:21:26.101 --> 00:21:26.860
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

828
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Off One off the toe off one toe on the way he does it.</v>

829
00:21:29.591 --> 00:21:30.880
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it looks fake.</v>

830
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.080
<v Speaker 1>It looks like he's on a stick.</v>

831
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:33.040
<v Speaker 1>You're spinning.</v>

832
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm like one of those uh,</v>

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:34.990
<v Speaker 1>foosball tables.</v>

834
00:21:34.991 --> 00:21:35.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

835
00:21:35.081 --> 00:21:38.050
<v Speaker 1>He said he was on antibiotics too in that fight cause he looked like shit.</v>

836
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean we had strep.</v>

837
00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:43.810
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the reasons why apparently he tapped so quickly cause like when it</v>

838
00:21:43.811 --> 00:21:44.860
<v Speaker 1>was clamping on his throat,</v>

839
00:21:44.861 --> 00:21:45.700
<v Speaker 1>he was already swollen.</v>

840
00:21:45.701 --> 00:21:46.750
<v Speaker 1>His throat was already fucked up.</v>

841
00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.613
<v Speaker 1>He had strep.</v>

842
00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:49.030
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be fine.</v>

843
00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:49.811
<v Speaker 1>He gets a lot of,</v>

844
00:21:49.811 --> 00:21:50.410
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.113
<v Speaker 1>Missed the mount.</v>

874
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.800

875
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Bloody wrapping it all.</v>

876
00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

877
00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:29.450
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

878
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:30.303
<v Speaker 1>Mike Pyle,</v>

879
00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.860
<v Speaker 1>he fought rampage Jackson like in 2013 pro fights.</v>

880
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:39.100
<v Speaker 1>It was his first pro fight was rampage Jackson in Tennessee.</v>

881
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Rampage is way bigger than he is.</v>

882
00:22:40.621 --> 00:22:41.020
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

883
00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

884
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:45.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you Mike Pyle and that was one of the reasons that Matt Brown was</v>

885
00:22:45.371 --> 00:22:47.290
<v Speaker 1>like so respectful about him after the fight.</v>

886
00:22:47.291 --> 00:22:47.501
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

887
00:22:47.501 --> 00:22:49.840
<v Speaker 1>people don't know how good Mike Pyle is.</v>

888
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:51.520
<v Speaker 1>I guess in the training room too.</v>

889
00:22:51.521 --> 00:22:52.240
<v Speaker 1>He's even better.</v>

890
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.070
<v Speaker 1>I guess he's up mother fucker right here.</v>

891
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:55.031
<v Speaker 1>They say in the train room,</v>

892
00:22:55.031 --> 00:22:59.050
<v Speaker 1>he's like unstoppable telling the TRT is designed for dudes like this can't do</v>

893
00:22:59.051 --> 00:23:02.050
<v Speaker 1>it anymore and now they have fun.</v>

894
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:03.250
<v Speaker 1>They have testing rates.</v>

895
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

896
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

897
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:07.210
<v Speaker 1>They have a testing HGH that gets you from 21 days out.</v>

898
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Why tell you're really fun.</v>

899
00:23:08.451 --> 00:23:10.180
<v Speaker 1>It used to be like a day.</v>

902
00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:14.953
<v Speaker 1>Gene doping be,</v>

903
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:16.061
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

904
00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:19.540
<v Speaker 1>I told you Novitsky said that they've already at least theoretically have</v>

905
00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:22.840
<v Speaker 1>testosterone that's derived from animals instead of wild yams.</v>

906
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.660
<v Speaker 1>So the carbon isotope tests hasn't work.</v>

907
00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:26.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

908
00:23:26.231 --> 00:23:27.470
<v Speaker 1>it looks like human testosterone.</v>

909
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

910
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Dirty bird shit.</v>

911
00:23:29.381 --> 00:23:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Your names the dirty bird.</v>

912
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:32.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

913
00:23:32.171 --> 00:23:33.940
<v Speaker 1>but it does of course</v>

914
00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Mike Pyle,</v>

915
00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Shawn Spencer throwing down man,</v>

916
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.520
<v Speaker 1>props to Spencer for surviving that.</v>

917
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.860
<v Speaker 1>That exchange just fights in Vegas.</v>

918
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:45.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

919
00:23:45.501 --> 00:23:46.050
<v Speaker 1>This is at the</v>

920
00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:46.821
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] stadium.</v>

921
00:23:46.821 --> 00:23:47.930
<v Speaker 2>Looks empty.</v>

922
00:23:47.931 --> 00:23:48.411
<v Speaker 2>It's empty.</v>

923
00:23:48.411 --> 00:23:50.510
<v Speaker 2>But I'm sure when the main event dropped out,</v>

924
00:23:50.511 --> 00:23:52.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure a lot of people canceled their trips,</v>

925
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.521
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

926
00:23:52.521 --> 00:23:53.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm not mad at for doom.</v>

927
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:54.470
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna tell you about at the beginning.</v>

928
00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:54.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

929
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:57.740
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense because since he's the heavyweight champ,</v>

930
00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.980
<v Speaker 2>the way it works out a lot of times is you get a percentage of paper views,</v>

931
00:24:00.981 --> 00:24:02.570
<v Speaker 2>but you have to hit a certain number.</v>

932
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

933
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.410
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to market steep a verse for Doom on two weeks.</v>

934
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:06.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

935
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:07.570
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to hit those papers.</v>

936
00:24:07.571 --> 00:24:08.404
<v Speaker 2>You numbers.</v>

937
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:09.021
<v Speaker 2>So when he was like,</v>

938
00:24:09.021 --> 00:24:09.171
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

939
00:24:09.171 --> 00:24:09.561
<v Speaker 2>I'm out.</v>

940
00:24:09.561 --> 00:24:09.801
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

941
00:24:09.801 --> 00:24:10.760
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking brilliant.</v>

942
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:11.870
<v Speaker 2>But he's definitely hurt.</v>

943
00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:15.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm the word that I'm hearing from everybody said he's fucking hurt and he's</v>

944
00:24:15.921 --> 00:24:16.110
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

945
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:17.870
<v Speaker 2>He's been having some back problems for a while now.</v>

946
00:24:17.871 --> 00:24:21.510
<v Speaker 2>Apparently he was having it on one side of his back and uh,</v>

947
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:22.580
<v Speaker 2>it would lock up,</v>

948
00:24:22.581 --> 00:24:23.630
<v Speaker 2>but he was working through it and he,</v>

949
00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:25.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>

950
00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:26.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

951
00:24:26.381 --> 00:24:27.214
<v Speaker 2>He got some</v>

952
00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:29.430
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

953
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:31.150
<v Speaker 2>Ow.</v>

954
00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.333
<v Speaker 2>Ow.</v>

955
00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:33.323
<v Speaker 2>Ow.</v>

956
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.233
<v Speaker 2>Stop it.</v>

957
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.073
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

958
00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:37.911
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

959
00:24:37.911 --> 00:24:38.744

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:47.000

963
00:24:47.001 --> 00:24:47.691
<v Speaker 2>Just looked at him.</v>

964
00:24:47.691 --> 00:24:48.310
<v Speaker 2>Stop it.</v>

965
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:49.970
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] he's not defending himself.</v>

966
00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Eve Levine let shit who Talla is,</v>

967
00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.413
<v Speaker 2>but you keep that was,</v>

968
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.200
<v Speaker 2>that was not good.</v>

969
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.033
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

970
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.491
<v Speaker 2>But you don't,</v>

971
00:24:55.491 --> 00:24:56.620
<v Speaker 2>if you've got eve Levina as your rep,</v>

972
00:24:56.621 --> 00:24:56.870
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

973
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:57.051
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

974
00:24:57.051 --> 00:24:58.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm about to get you fucked up.</v>

975
00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:59.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a violent sport.</v>

976
00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:00.940
<v Speaker 2>It is about to happen.</v>

977
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:01.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

978
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.060
<v Speaker 2>but we can prevent bad.</v>

979
00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:07.820
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't know what five of those shots and some of that pressure,</v>

980
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:08.081
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

981
00:25:08.081 --> 00:25:09.290
<v Speaker 2>four or five of those shots,</v>

982
00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.770
<v Speaker 2>he's been a ref for fucking the pressures.</v>

983
00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:13.500
<v Speaker 2>If he would have stopped it early and everyone found no,</v>

984
00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:13.761
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

985
00:25:13.761 --> 00:25:13.980
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

986
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:15.050
<v Speaker 2>What he gave a fuck.</v>

987
00:25:15.051 --> 00:25:15.860
<v Speaker 2>That guy was out.</v>

988
00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:19.580
<v Speaker 2>I guys in trouble rather have it go a little late then we'll know that hurts the</v>

989
00:25:19.581 --> 00:25:19.910
<v Speaker 2>sport.</v>

990
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:20.510
<v Speaker 2>My man,</v>

991
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.681
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

992
00:25:20.681 --> 00:25:21.050
<v Speaker 2>that's a hurdle.</v>

993
00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Fucking sport.</v>

994
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:22.330
<v Speaker 2>I disagree.</v>

995
00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:23.390
<v Speaker 2>How is that hurting the sport?</v>

996
00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:25.160
<v Speaker 2>Are you getting paid little violence?</v>

997
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

998
00:25:25.431 --> 00:25:27.470
<v Speaker 2>but a little late is unnecessary.</v>

999
00:25:27.471 --> 00:25:28.460
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't that late man.</v>

1000
00:25:28.461 --> 00:25:29.670
<v Speaker 2>That was a very entertaining,</v>

1001
00:25:29.671 --> 00:25:34.671
<v Speaker 2>I might be one last fight on [inaudible] is what we pay for theirs.</v>

1002
00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:35.530
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

1003
00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:38.090
<v Speaker 2>It's real subjective Eddie cause you're right in a lot of ways.</v>

1004
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.000
<v Speaker 2>But then again like there's guys that survive it like Frankie Edgar,</v>

1005
00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:41.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1006
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.070
<v Speaker 2>If you stopped every fight with Frankie,</v>

1007
00:25:43.071 --> 00:25:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Edgar was wobbled,</v>

1008
00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.220
<v Speaker 2>you'd be in jail.</v>

1009
00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean he would never be gray Maynard and that second fight by Kao Cause he got</v>

1010
00:25:48.771 --> 00:25:51.760
<v Speaker 2>hurt hard in that first round and a lot of trigger happy would,</v>

1011
00:25:51.761 --> 00:25:52.970
<v Speaker 2>would've pulled the trigger on that fight.</v>

1012
00:25:52.971 --> 00:25:54.410
<v Speaker 2>And there's a shitload of fights like that.</v>

1013
00:25:54.411 --> 00:25:55.490
<v Speaker 2>There was a whole list of them.</v>

1014
00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:56.443
<v Speaker 2>But this one,</v>

1015
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.280
<v Speaker 2>this one is prolonged would,</v>

1016
00:25:58.281 --> 00:25:59.780
<v Speaker 2>this is my problem with this.</v>

1017
00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:02.450
<v Speaker 2>He's not hitting back and he's not defending him.</v>

1018
00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:03.170
<v Speaker 2>How's he going to win?</v>

1019
00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:04.040
<v Speaker 2>He's not doing anything.</v>

1020
00:26:04.041 --> 00:26:05.210
<v Speaker 2>He's just taking shots.</v>

1021
00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:08.560
<v Speaker 2>He's not [inaudible],</v>

1022
00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:10.373
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1023
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:12.470
<v Speaker 2>those last shots,</v>

1024
00:26:12.471 --> 00:26:13.430
<v Speaker 2>he's not moving.</v>

1025
00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.780
<v Speaker 2>He's not moving at all.</v>

1026
00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:16.640
<v Speaker 2>He's just surviving on its [inaudible].</v>

1027
00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.240
<v Speaker 2>Celebrity Rehab was definitive call.</v>

1028
00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.380
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't on the fence.</v>

1029
00:26:21.381 --> 00:26:23.060
<v Speaker 2>It's not because a little over the fence.</v>

1030
00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.340
<v Speaker 2>That's why there's subjective thinking,</v>

1031
00:26:25.341 --> 00:26:25.710
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1032
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.490
<v Speaker 2>how different different points of view.</v>

1033
00:26:28.491 --> 00:26:29.324
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1034
00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:30.290
<v Speaker 2>I see your argument.</v>

1035
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.501
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1036
00:26:30.501 --> 00:26:32.960
<v Speaker 2>we got to realize why are we watching this?</v>

1037
00:26:32.961 --> 00:26:33.794
<v Speaker 2>We're watching,</v>

1038
00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:35.900
<v Speaker 2>we're watching this for brutality.</v>

1039
00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.201
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1040
00:26:36.201 --> 00:26:40.450
<v Speaker 2>but you got to protect the guy when the highlights or I'll buy it from his own</v>

1041
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:41.323
<v Speaker 2>timeline.</v>

1042
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.920
<v Speaker 2>That's a beautiful highlight.</v>

1043
00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:45.843
<v Speaker 2>Highlight,</v>

1044
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:47.343
<v Speaker 2>highlight,</v>

1045
00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:47.910
<v Speaker 2>highlight,</v>

1046
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:48.450
<v Speaker 2>highlight.</v>

1047
00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:49.320
<v Speaker 2>If you stopped it,</v>

1048
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.510
<v Speaker 2>three punches before it still highlight.</v>

1049
00:26:51.511 --> 00:26:51.811
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1050
00:26:51.811 --> 00:26:52.410
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1051
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:53.570
<v Speaker 2>I agree to take on to,</v>

1052
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:54.750
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the worst.</v>

1053
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:55.820
<v Speaker 2>That was up the worst dot.</v>

1054
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.951
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1055
00:26:55.951 --> 00:26:56.730
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>

1056
00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:57.740
<v Speaker 2>Like you know what's worse?</v>

1057
00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.633
<v Speaker 2>You know what was worse?</v>

1058
00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Rockhold and Chris Weidman,</v>

1059
00:27:00.181 --> 00:27:01.290
<v Speaker 2>100% was worse.</v>

1060
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.210
<v Speaker 2>It was a site that should have been stopped 100% when they weren't.</v>

1061
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:05.400
<v Speaker 2>When he was on top of them.</v>

1062
00:27:05.401 --> 00:27:05.941
<v Speaker 2>I was saying,</v>

1063
00:27:05.941 --> 00:27:08.990
<v Speaker 2>what does Luke Rockhold have to do to get a stoppage?</v>

1064
00:27:08.991 --> 00:27:09.780
<v Speaker 2>Cause this is a,</v>

1065
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:10.591
<v Speaker 2>this is terrible.</v>

1066
00:27:10.591 --> 00:27:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Like Chris Weidman is taken damaged.</v>

1067
00:27:12.211 --> 00:27:13.600
<v Speaker 2>It's unnecessary.</v>

1068
00:27:13.601 --> 00:27:14.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just unnecessary,</v>

1069
00:27:14.581 --> 00:27:17.640
<v Speaker 2>but most likely when you take get beaten up like that,</v>

1070
00:27:17.641 --> 00:27:18.450
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to recover.</v>

1071
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:19.950
<v Speaker 2>But really there've been many,</v>

1072
00:27:19.951 --> 00:27:23.970
<v Speaker 2>many fights where they could have easily stopped it and the guy came back to</v>

1073
00:27:23.971 --> 00:27:25.410
<v Speaker 2>rock cars are loud.</v>

1074
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.841
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1075
00:27:25.841 --> 00:27:26.460
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

1076
00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.170
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of fights like that.</v>

1077
00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:31.010
<v Speaker 2>You got to let it go for the fans and pisses depends.</v>

1078
00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:32.940
<v Speaker 2>65 fucking dollars now come on.</v>

1079
00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:33.690
<v Speaker 2>We don't want,</v>

1080
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:35.630
<v Speaker 2>we'd rather have them be taken serious early,</v>

1081
00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:36.973
<v Speaker 2>late low.</v>

1082
00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:38.100
<v Speaker 2>Early is always going to win.</v>

1083
00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:42.630
<v Speaker 2>I think Brock Lesnar Brock Lesnar looked better versus Shane carbon didn't.</v>

1084
00:27:42.631 --> 00:27:43.464
<v Speaker 2>Weidman did.</v>

1085
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh hundred percent there really wasn't any damage.</v>

1086
00:27:45.911 --> 00:27:46.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1087
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:47.520
<v Speaker 2>He's getting hit but covering up,</v>

1088
00:27:47.521 --> 00:27:48.390
<v Speaker 2>but there's no blood.</v>

1089
00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:48.841
<v Speaker 2>But he was,</v>

1090
00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:49.980
<v Speaker 2>he looked like he was there.</v>

1091
00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:50.251
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1092
00:27:50.251 --> 00:27:51.110
<v Speaker 2>he Weidman was calling.</v>

1093
00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:55.920
<v Speaker 2>Thumped on face was literally like someone shot him with the greatest moments</v>

1094
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.120
<v Speaker 2>and made a bunch of peanuts because of that.</v>

1095
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:59.520
<v Speaker 2>That's why the fuck,</v>

1096
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.390
<v Speaker 2>that's why.</v>

1097
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:04.020
<v Speaker 2>That's why hardly nobody's doing MMA.</v>

1098
00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.490
<v Speaker 2>Cause did the brutality.</v>

1099
00:28:05.491 --> 00:28:06.060
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>

1100
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.280
<v Speaker 2>That's why people are paying $65 for it.</v>

1101
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.450
<v Speaker 2>If it was all decisions,</v>

1102
00:28:09.451 --> 00:28:10.380
<v Speaker 2>no one would pay for anything.</v>

1103
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.600
<v Speaker 2>If it was a scroll that regardless,</v>

1104
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:13.740
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't that bad.</v>

1105
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:16.380
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to argue about it.</v>

1106
00:28:16.381 --> 00:28:17.790
<v Speaker 2>I see Eddie's point of view and I,</v>

1107
00:28:17.791 --> 00:28:18.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1108
00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:20.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm leaning more towards your side.</v>

1109
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:22.920
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe it could have stopped it because you're just standing there taking</v>

1110
00:28:22.921 --> 00:28:23.730
<v Speaker 2>shots.</v>

1111
00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:24.690
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't moving.</v>

1112
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:28.500
<v Speaker 2>No head trauma guys just stand there taking shots and he's not moving.</v>

1113
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:30.000
<v Speaker 2>He's waiting for the referee stopped.</v>

1114
00:28:30.001 --> 00:28:31.650
<v Speaker 2>He was standing fully erect.</v>

1115
00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:32.820
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't walking</v>

1116
00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:35.730
<v Speaker 2>stud.</v>

1117
00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:36.481
<v Speaker 2>He's a stud.</v>

1118
00:28:36.481 --> 00:28:39.600
<v Speaker 2>He's in excellent shape but that's how a lot of guys die.</v>

1119
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.570
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of the guys that have died from getting beat up,</v>

1120
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.620
<v Speaker 2>they didn't go down.</v>

1121
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:44.850
<v Speaker 2>They got beaten down.</v>

1122
00:28:44.851 --> 00:28:46.050
<v Speaker 2>They sank into the ropes.</v>

1123
00:28:46.051 --> 00:28:47.520
<v Speaker 2>How many people have died in MMA?</v>

1124
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.710
<v Speaker 2>5,000 about MMA mostly,</v>

1125
00:28:49.711 --> 00:28:50.544
<v Speaker 2>but boxing,</v>

1126
00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:51.570
<v Speaker 2>mostly boxing.</v>

1127
00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:52.561
<v Speaker 2>Well you know,</v>

1128
00:28:52.561 --> 00:28:55.560
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that MMA has going for it is that you could fucking clinch,</v>

1129
00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.540
<v Speaker 2>it's the cruelest shit ever to watch.</v>

1130
00:28:57.541 --> 00:29:01.290
<v Speaker 2>A guy like rocked in a boxing match and the referees like pulling them off and</v>

1131
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:02.190
<v Speaker 2>holding onto the guy.</v>

1132
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:05.760
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that's keeping that guy,</v>

1133
00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:08.760
<v Speaker 2>that's the only thing keeping them alive.</v>

1134
00:29:08.761 --> 00:29:09.001
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1135
00:29:09.001 --> 00:29:09.271
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>

1136
00:29:09.271 --> 00:29:10.170
<v Speaker 2>you can't hang on.</v>

1137
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:11.071
<v Speaker 2>They're going to break up.</v>

1138
00:29:11.071 --> 00:29:11.461
<v Speaker 2>Break it up.</v>

1139
00:29:11.461 --> 00:29:11.760
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1140
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.890
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>

1141
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:14.281
<v Speaker 2>If you don't let go,</v>

1142
00:29:14.281 --> 00:29:15.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to disqualify you.</v>

1143
00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:16.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

1144
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.031
<v Speaker 2>It's the worst.</v>

1145
00:29:18.031 --> 00:29:18.870
<v Speaker 2>It's really dumb.</v>

1146
00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.000
<v Speaker 2>Mike Pyle,</v>

1147
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.250
<v Speaker 2>powerful Mike Pyle is a big win for him.</v>

1148
00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:24.630
<v Speaker 2>Congratulations to him.</v>

1149
00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.340
<v Speaker 2>He's been fighting for ever man.</v>

1150
00:29:26.341 --> 00:29:27.180
<v Speaker 2>40 years old.</v>

1151
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:30.270
<v Speaker 2>I remember the first time I heard his name Ed clay fit.</v>

1152
00:29:30.271 --> 00:29:31.590
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy from Tennessee,</v>

1153
00:29:31.591 --> 00:29:31.771
<v Speaker 2>may,</v>

1154
00:29:31.771 --> 00:29:32.371
<v Speaker 2>Mike Pyle,</v>

1155
00:29:32.371 --> 00:29:33.330
<v Speaker 2>he trains at my gym.</v>

1156
00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:34.680
<v Speaker 2>Watch out for this guy.</v>

1157
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:38.520
<v Speaker 2>This is 2001 or 2000 so long ago.</v>

1158
00:29:38.521 --> 00:29:39.810
<v Speaker 2>He's 40 now.</v>

1159
00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:40.923
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1160
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:43.910
<v Speaker 2>No taller than head.</v>

1161
00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:49.180
<v Speaker 2>I think MMA in a way has a longer lifespan regardless of what you're taking.</v>

1162
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.790
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're taking nothing,</v>

1163
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.340
<v Speaker 2>then boxing desk cause it's not as completely dependent upon reflexes.</v>

1164
00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:56.140
<v Speaker 2>There's so many different skills to learn.</v>

1165
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:56.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

1166
00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:57.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1169
00:29:59.270 --> 00:29:59.700
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

1170
00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:00.533
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:01.573
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>

1172
00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:03.610

1176
00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:05.590
<v Speaker 2>He's still on his feet.</v>

1177
00:30:05.591 --> 00:30:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Guy Wasn't doing shit though.</v>

1178
00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.980
<v Speaker 2>Shaun's was just taking it because I didn't need to take that last name.</v>

1179
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:12.063

1186
00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:18.631
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the worst,</v>

1187
00:30:18.631 --> 00:30:20.140
<v Speaker 2>but just trying to be honest here.</v>

1188
00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:20.890
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1189
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:21.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying.</v>

1190
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:21.750
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying,</v>

1192
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.100

<v Speaker 2>This guys just fought.</v>

1195
00:30:27.551 --> 00:30:28.440
<v Speaker 2>It's harder like,</v>

1196
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:29.681
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1197
00:30:29.681 --> 00:30:30.190
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>

1198
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:32.230
<v Speaker 2>that's what people are paying $65 and they know the,</v>

1199
00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:32.921
<v Speaker 2>they know the game.</v>

1200
00:30:32.921 --> 00:30:33.521
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

1201
00:30:33.521 --> 00:30:34.510
<v Speaker 2>I ain't know the game.</v>

1202
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:35.680
<v Speaker 2>They know it's brutal.</v>

1203
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's well aware they're in a fucking cage,</v>

1204
00:30:38.171 --> 00:30:38.590
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1205
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.841
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

1206
00:30:38.841 --> 00:30:41.650
<v Speaker 2>you're throwing full blown Shin kicks to your skull.</v>

1207
00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.120
<v Speaker 2>No one's trying to stop that.</v>

1208
00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.900
<v Speaker 2>That's what hurt.</v>

1209
00:30:46.901 --> 00:30:48.370
<v Speaker 2>They are trying to stop that.</v>

1210
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:49.990
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole idea behind it.</v>

1211
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:51.460
<v Speaker 2>What would you rather take?</v>

1212
00:30:51.461 --> 00:30:54.190
<v Speaker 2>What he went through against the fence like that with those elbows like that and</v>

1213
00:30:54.191 --> 00:30:58.250
<v Speaker 2>you were kind of standing or Edson Barboza just throwing a straight fucking</v>

1214
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.570
<v Speaker 2>kicking your face.</v>

1215
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:01.463
<v Speaker 2>That switch.</v>

1216
00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:05.280
<v Speaker 2>That switch kicked Kira floating around on the switch.</v>

1217
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.153
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about,</v>

1218
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:08.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about the wheel kick with the heel.</v>

1219
00:31:08.831 --> 00:31:09.780
<v Speaker 2>That'd be the hardest hit.</v>

1220
00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:15.050
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't feel good to take those Mike Pyle elbow all definitely.</v>

1221
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:18.790
<v Speaker 2>His fucking wheel kick is perfect.</v>

1222
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.910
<v Speaker 2>His switch kick in his wheelchair collect the best I've ever seen.</v>

1223
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.780
<v Speaker 2>The fastest to eat.</v>

1224
00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.960
<v Speaker 2>His leg kicks are so God damn fast and everything.</v>

1225
00:31:25.961 --> 00:31:29.300
<v Speaker 2>Barbels is probably the fastest kicker maybe I've ever seen.</v>

1226
00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.380
<v Speaker 2>I think I've ever seen anybody kick his fastest.</v>

1227
00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:32.530
<v Speaker 2>Him Not even close to,</v>

1228
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:33.161
<v Speaker 2>I can't even think.</v>

1229
00:31:33.161 --> 00:31:37.300
<v Speaker 2>A lot of fucking chaos with those wheel kicks over the last five years.</v>

1230
00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.730
<v Speaker 2>Look at Wonderboy Thompson common now.</v>

1231
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.250
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember we used to talk about it and I was like just people don't know</v>

1232
00:31:42.251 --> 00:31:42.810
<v Speaker 2>how to do it.</v>

1233
00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:43.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1234
00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:43.301
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1235
00:31:43.301 --> 00:31:44.140
<v Speaker 2>people know how to do it.</v>

1236
00:31:44.141 --> 00:31:45.040
<v Speaker 2>It's horrific.</v>

1237
00:31:45.041 --> 00:31:45.280
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1238
00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Because of it lands.</v>

1239
00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:50.290
<v Speaker 2>I'd never seen anybody get wheel kicked in the head by a guy who is good and not</v>

1240
00:31:50.291 --> 00:31:51.040
<v Speaker 2>go out.</v>

1241
00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Like when you get healed,</v>

1242
00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:53.560
<v Speaker 2>when a heel hits your head,</v>

1243
00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:56.920
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you catch guys with the toes and those guys are okay,</v>

1244
00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:58.470
<v Speaker 2>but you got to get slapped.</v>

1245
00:31:58.471 --> 00:31:58.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1246
00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:01.990
<v Speaker 2>but when a heel hits you in the head from a guy who really knows how you got</v>

1247
00:32:01.991 --> 00:32:03.460
<v Speaker 2>your boot on and you've got the bulldog,</v>

1248
00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.900
<v Speaker 2>Wonderboy landed.</v>

1249
00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:05.321
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1250
00:32:05.321 --> 00:32:05.471
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1251
00:32:05.471 --> 00:32:05.621
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1252
00:32:05.621 --> 00:32:05.801
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1253
00:32:05.801 --> 00:32:06.041
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1254
00:32:06.041 --> 00:32:08.970
<v Speaker 2>You had your boot on as opposed to like this.</v>

1255
00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:10.241
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1256
00:32:10.241 --> 00:32:10.550
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1257
00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:12.580
<v Speaker 2>the key is it's just like throwing a punch.</v>

1258
00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:13.301
<v Speaker 2>The idea,</v>

1259
00:32:13.301 --> 00:32:14.530
<v Speaker 2>like when you throw in a punches,</v>

1260
00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:17.890
<v Speaker 2>you don't want your hand completely clinched up until you're going to make</v>

1261
00:32:17.891 --> 00:32:22.180
<v Speaker 2>impact because then slows the punch down so you're supposed to punch and then</v>

1262
00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:24.850
<v Speaker 2>tighten your hand up as you're about to hit.</v>

1263
00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:28.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like kind of a timing thing and a lot of ways you want to keep everything</v>

1264
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:31.560
<v Speaker 2>as loose as possible while exploding in the right way.</v>

1265
00:32:31.561 --> 00:32:32.740
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing with a kick.</v>

1266
00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.180
<v Speaker 2>When you throw in that wheel kick,</v>

1267
00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:39.390
<v Speaker 2>you want everything to be almost like ballet until like halfway there and then</v>

1268
00:32:39.501 --> 00:32:42.900
<v Speaker 2>halfway there you're pulling your leg back and you pull it and you put in</v>

1269
00:32:42.901 --> 00:32:45.500
<v Speaker 2>pushing your foot forward and you stick in that heel out.</v>

1270
00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:47.490
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't come into like there.</v>

1271
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:49.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like as you're in the middle of the spin,</v>

1272
00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:51.590
<v Speaker 2>once you get like they're,</v>

1273
00:32:51.591 --> 00:32:54.050
<v Speaker 2>that's when everything hardens up and boom,</v>

1274
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.330
<v Speaker 2>and then you come across with a heel that's of Barboza.</v>

1275
00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:57.920
<v Speaker 2>No MMA fighters.</v>

1276
00:32:57.921 --> 00:32:59.690
<v Speaker 2>We're working on that shit and</v>

1277
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.353
<v Speaker 2>fuck me,</v>

1278
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:03.680
<v Speaker 2>nobody was working on,</v>

1279
00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.330
<v Speaker 2>everyone is now though did PBS to make fun of it.</v>

1280
00:33:06.331 --> 00:33:07.220
<v Speaker 2>She brought it up,</v>

1281
00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:07.851
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

1282
00:33:07.851 --> 00:33:10.190
<v Speaker 2>you know like once people learn how to really throw,</v>

1283
00:33:10.191 --> 00:33:10.761
<v Speaker 2>spinning back,</v>

1284
00:33:10.761 --> 00:33:11.600
<v Speaker 2>kick to the body,</v>

1285
00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:12.111
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1286
00:33:12.111 --> 00:33:13.370
<v Speaker 2>it's like getting hit by a car.</v>

1287
00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.020
<v Speaker 2>It was more really when people,</v>

1288
00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.820
<v Speaker 2>when the people that already know how to do it,</v>

1289
00:33:16.821 --> 00:33:18.980
<v Speaker 2>learn how to wrestle and did you get to,</v>

1290
00:33:18.981 --> 00:33:22.010
<v Speaker 2>so they're not afraid to throw it because everybody that was karate guys and</v>

1291
00:33:22.011 --> 00:33:23.180
<v Speaker 2>taekwondo guys in those times,</v>

1292
00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:25.610
<v Speaker 2>but they were told by their MMA coach,</v>

1293
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.550
<v Speaker 2>don't fucking throw that shit cause these,</v>

1294
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.270
<v Speaker 2>these guys going to take you down to choke you out.</v>

1295
00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:30.530
<v Speaker 2>So they were limited like,</v>

1296
00:33:30.531 --> 00:33:30.891
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1297
00:33:30.891 --> 00:33:31.724
<v Speaker 2>we're going to keep it,</v>

1298
00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:32.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1299
00:33:32.151 --> 00:33:35.300
<v Speaker 2>nice and simple and we're not going to do the spin kicks that we know what to do</v>

1300
00:33:35.301 --> 00:33:36.470
<v Speaker 2>because we suck on the ground.</v>

1301
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:40.040
<v Speaker 2>But once like Stephen Thompson or Wonderboy,</v>

1302
00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:44.670
<v Speaker 2>Wonderboy Ellenberg he's good on blue motherfucker.</v>

1303
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:44.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1304
00:33:44.901 --> 00:33:45.671
<v Speaker 2>you guys after it,</v>

1305
00:33:45.671 --> 00:33:49.370
<v Speaker 2>Helen Burger said that it was a waste of time to throw those things.</v>

1306
00:33:49.371 --> 00:33:49.641
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1307
00:33:49.641 --> 00:33:51.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm not worried about is spinning to said waste of time.</v>

1308
00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:52.671
<v Speaker 2>That's what he said.</v>

1309
00:33:52.671 --> 00:33:56.240
<v Speaker 2>He's like that's a waste of energy in the bend of the review.</v>

1310
00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:57.221
<v Speaker 2>Did he really?</v>

1311
00:33:57.221 --> 00:33:58.130
<v Speaker 2>Not In the preview.</v>

1312
00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:01.850
<v Speaker 2>So Wonderboy moves like a fucking snake.</v>

1313
00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:05.180
<v Speaker 2>That's the future right there like that.</v>

1314
00:34:05.181 --> 00:34:06.140
<v Speaker 2>Like Conor Mcgregor,</v>

1315
00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:07.820
<v Speaker 2>like a Diego Brandao.</v>

1316
00:34:07.821 --> 00:34:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Those guys that just throw every opened.</v>

1317
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:10.873
<v Speaker 2>That's Chris.</v>

1318
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:12.740
<v Speaker 2>He throws a lot of fun.</v>

1319
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:13.700
<v Speaker 2>It's a great striker,</v>

1320
00:34:13.701 --> 00:34:14.021
<v Speaker 2>isn't there?</v>

1321
00:34:14.021 --> 00:34:17.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going back to those to those was a lot of spinning shit you throw,</v>

1322
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:21.150
<v Speaker 2>they throw some wild meat compared to as Joanne in the wild.</v>

1323
00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:22.123
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever,</v>

1324
00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.380
<v Speaker 2>did you ever throw spitting shit and you know what I'm saying?</v>

1325
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

1326
00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.220
<v Speaker 2>Never ever.</v>

1327
00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.500
<v Speaker 2>Why you're super athletic.</v>

1328
00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:31.911
<v Speaker 2>No one really taught me.</v>

1329
00:34:31.911 --> 00:34:32.420
<v Speaker 2>I never had,</v>

1330
00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:35.060
<v Speaker 2>I never had a kickboxing coach or taekwondo coach.</v>

1331
00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:36.470
<v Speaker 2>No one ever said you should.</v>

1332
00:34:36.471 --> 00:34:41.471
<v Speaker 2>Every now and then it's good to have a fucking game over game over a weapon</v>

1333
00:34:41.571 --> 00:34:43.760
<v Speaker 2>right there at said that we'll kick man.</v>

1334
00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.960
<v Speaker 2>It's no one ever told you that,</v>

1335
00:34:44.961 --> 00:34:45.710
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>

1336
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.490
<v Speaker 2>A lot of fighters though or don't throw much.</v>

1337
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:50.210
<v Speaker 2>Most I would say not 80% still don't throw them right,</v>

1338
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.240
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of them can't.</v>

1339
00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:54.040
<v Speaker 2>Totally project thing.</v>

1340
00:34:54.041 --> 00:34:57.140
<v Speaker 2>He's had to learn a lot of time on that shit and it's not exactly if,</v>

1341
00:34:57.141 --> 00:34:58.160
<v Speaker 2>if you're putting it in,</v>

1342
00:34:58.161 --> 00:35:02.930
<v Speaker 2>you know what priorities put spinning wheel kick number 30 is a long term</v>

1343
00:35:02.931 --> 00:35:04.460
<v Speaker 2>project for such a shit.</v>

1344
00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:08.480
<v Speaker 2>That's why it helps if you have a martial arts background star with when you're</v>

1345
00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:09.050
<v Speaker 2>a kid,</v>

1346
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:10.400
<v Speaker 2>you learn that shit first.</v>

1347
00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.390
<v Speaker 2>It becomes normal.</v>

1348
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Like if you see a little four year olds through onside kicks and then we'll</v>

1349
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.481
<v Speaker 2>kicks.</v>

1350
00:35:14.481 --> 00:35:17.840
<v Speaker 2>It's hilarious and it's adorable because their legs are so,</v>

1351
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:19.580
<v Speaker 2>they're so used to throw their legs.</v>

1352
00:35:19.581 --> 00:35:19.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1353
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:20.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1354
00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:23.780
<v Speaker 2>if they throw their legs up in the air and it's normal and then as they get</v>

1355
00:35:23.781 --> 00:35:25.070
<v Speaker 2>older and their legs get heavy,</v>

1356
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.130
<v Speaker 2>their body's used to the dynamic.</v>

1357
00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Habib number,</v>

1358
00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:33.200
<v Speaker 2>Madoff and Tony Ferguson,</v>

1359
00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Agler Hearns and chase.</v>

1360
00:35:34.551 --> 00:35:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Thank God he's going to fight Johnson again.</v>

1361
00:35:36.741 --> 00:35:36.960
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1362
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.370
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this?</v>

1363
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Settle the fuck down.</v>

1364
00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.990
<v Speaker 1>What are the odds that that fight is really gonna take place Xero to not</v>

1365
00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:45.720
<v Speaker 1>hurt all the time.</v>

1366
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:47.130
<v Speaker 1>He's unfortunately,</v>

1367
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.570
<v Speaker 1>he's super talented,</v>

1368
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.100
<v Speaker 1>but he's hurt all the time.</v>

1369
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:51.120
<v Speaker 1>He's going to get hurt again.</v>

1370
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Get you could get hurt again easily.</v>

1371
00:35:54.061 --> 00:35:54.620
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1372
00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:56.260
<v Speaker 1>He's going to hurt the not,</v>

1373
00:35:56.261 --> 00:35:57.094
<v Speaker 1>I'd say.</v>

1374
00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Which sucks.</v>

1375
00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:58.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1376
00:35:58.411 --> 00:35:58.741
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1377
00:35:58.741 --> 00:35:59.574
<v Speaker 1>people get hurt,</v>

1378
00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:00.680
<v Speaker 1>so that's a,</v>

1379
00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:06.110
<v Speaker 1>there's a 50% chance of him getting hurt or 80% let's say 60% that's a lot.</v>

1380
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:07.740
<v Speaker 1>That's a Fox card apparent.</v>

1381
00:36:07.741 --> 00:36:09.900
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot on my calendar.</v>

1382
00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:11.040
<v Speaker 1>At least that's a Fox card.</v>

1383
00:36:11.041 --> 00:36:13.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's going to be an fs one or Fox card.</v>

1384
00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:14.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a,</v>

1385
00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:16.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's an Aka thing.</v>

1386
00:36:16.411 --> 00:36:17.460
<v Speaker 1>How have you guys are getting hurt?</v>

1387
00:36:17.461 --> 00:36:20.880
<v Speaker 1>I think Khabib and cane,</v>

1388
00:36:20.881 --> 00:36:23.940
<v Speaker 1>they just have so much experience with wrestling and doing combat sports.</v>

1389
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.170
<v Speaker 1>They're just getting up there,</v>

1390
00:36:25.171 --> 00:36:25.470
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1391
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:27.930
<v Speaker 1>They trying to train like regular dudes and they're getting hurt while the</v>

1392
00:36:27.931 --> 00:36:28.431
<v Speaker 1>people were like,</v>

1393
00:36:28.431 --> 00:36:28.561
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1394
00:36:28.561 --> 00:36:29.400
<v Speaker 1>that's gay.</v>

1395
00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Habib's young guy.</v>

1396
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:31.540
<v Speaker 1>He has a ton of experience.</v>

1397
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:33.640
<v Speaker 1>Does wasn't,</v>

1398
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:34.650
<v Speaker 1>they're world champions,</v>

1399
00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:38.850
<v Speaker 1>master of sports and it's interesting because when it,</v>

1400
00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:39.723
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1401
00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:44.040
<v Speaker 1>just a wrestler and he beat the brakes off though.</v>

1402
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.520
<v Speaker 1>He looks like when you,</v>

1403
00:36:45.521 --> 00:36:46.800
<v Speaker 1>when you're watching them compete,</v>

1404
00:36:46.801 --> 00:36:47.670
<v Speaker 1>he looks like a wrestler.</v>

1405
00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.450
<v Speaker 1>His wrestling wrestling is outstanding leg lock in people.</v>

1406
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Not really smashing people on the ground.</v>

1407
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.201
<v Speaker 1>Those guys,</v>

1408
00:36:55.201 --> 00:36:57.330
<v Speaker 1>those guys in Russia do a lot of Greco too though.</v>

1409
00:36:57.331 --> 00:36:58.350
<v Speaker 1>When you're Samo guy,</v>

1410
00:36:58.351 --> 00:36:59.790
<v Speaker 1>you're also doing a lot of Greco typically.</v>

1411
00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Well his,</v>

1412
00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:05.160
<v Speaker 1>his clinch is insane is a bit of ability to control from the top is insane.</v>

1413
00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1414
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:06.390
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>

1415
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:08.050
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say about Rockhold the other day.</v>

1416
00:37:08.051 --> 00:37:09.030
<v Speaker 1>It's two fights in a row.</v>

1417
00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Rockhold impressed me in a huge way with his ability to control from the top we</v>

1418
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.310
<v Speaker 1>against Machida and then against Weidman cause Machida was impressive.</v>

1419
00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:17.641
<v Speaker 1>But I was like,</v>

1420
00:37:17.641 --> 00:37:18.261
<v Speaker 1>I think he had,</v>

1421
00:37:18.261 --> 00:37:20.760
<v Speaker 1>but she had a fucked up before they went to the grounds of the temple thing.</v>

1422
00:37:20.761 --> 00:37:21.660
<v Speaker 1>But you don't want to the ground.</v>

1423
00:37:21.661 --> 00:37:22.410
<v Speaker 1>He destroyed them.</v>

1424
00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:23.970
<v Speaker 1>I think Maci was already fucked up,</v>

1425
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:25.950
<v Speaker 1>but Weidman wasn't like,</v>

1426
00:37:25.951 --> 00:37:26.210
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1427
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.641
<v Speaker 1>Why me?</v>

1428
00:37:26.641 --> 00:37:29.430
<v Speaker 1>He just caught a wheel kick in a fight where there was real close fight.</v>

1429
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:30.720
<v Speaker 1>But once he got him on the ground,</v>

1430
00:37:30.721 --> 00:37:30.990
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1431
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:31.823
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>

1432
00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.170
<v Speaker 1>game two,</v>

1433
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:34.711
<v Speaker 1>I think he's,</v>

1434
00:37:34.711 --> 00:37:34.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1435
00:37:34.921 --> 00:37:38.490
<v Speaker 1>he's Wyman was walking around it in one 93 apparently.</v>

1436
00:37:38.491 --> 00:37:42.750
<v Speaker 1>And I mean rock two weeks before the fight with two 16 technique to his</v>

1437
00:37:42.751 --> 00:37:43.830
<v Speaker 1>technique is nasty.</v>

1438
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:45.660
<v Speaker 1>You can't just say size sizes,</v>

1439
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.191
<v Speaker 1>it's conditions,</v>

1440
00:37:47.191 --> 00:37:47.611
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

1441
00:37:47.611 --> 00:37:47.880
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1442
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:48.840
<v Speaker 1>he's also training with,</v>

1443
00:37:48.841 --> 00:37:49.201
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1444
00:37:49.201 --> 00:37:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Cormier and came to Alaska.</v>

1445
00:37:50.651 --> 00:37:52.050
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a huge part of it,</v>

1446
00:37:52.051 --> 00:37:52.650
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1447
00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:54.940
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a huge part of it because like Ledcor me,</v>

1448
00:37:54.941 --> 00:37:56.700
<v Speaker 1>he said when he fought John Jones,</v>

1449
00:37:56.701 --> 00:37:59.640
<v Speaker 1>he didn't have cane is corners that came was all fucked up from surgery and he's</v>

1450
00:37:59.641 --> 00:37:59.731
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1451
00:37:59.731 --> 00:38:00.840
<v Speaker 1>I made a big impact on me.</v>

1452
00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:01.673
<v Speaker 1>I really felt it.</v>

1453
00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not that had anything to do with him blues into Jon Jones.</v>

1454
00:38:05.041 --> 00:38:08.580
<v Speaker 1>You making that face or fights and I want to see if any job I want to see</v>

1455
00:38:08.581 --> 00:38:09.331
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Johnson,</v>

1456
00:38:09.331 --> 00:38:10.164
<v Speaker 1>John Jones fight.</v>

1457
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:10.951
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1458
00:38:10.951 --> 00:38:11.740
<v Speaker 1>I want to see that too.</v>

1459
00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.440
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to call me a,</v>

1460
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:13.741
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1461
00:38:13.741 --> 00:38:17.460
<v Speaker 1>I want to see him with cane in his corner training with him,</v>

1462
00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:18.660
<v Speaker 1>see if that has any impact.</v>

1463
00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:20.730
<v Speaker 1>But I'd like to go going down,</v>

1464
00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:22.740
<v Speaker 1>right canes going through surgery.</v>

1465
00:38:22.741 --> 00:38:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it's going to have back surgery.</v>

1466
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:25.223
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1467
00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:26.400
<v Speaker 1>He already had it.</v>

1468
00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1469
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:27.390
<v Speaker 1>You already had it.</v>

1470
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:28.110
<v Speaker 1>He already had him.</v>

1471
00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:29.400
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about home and tape</v>

1472
00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:32.320
<v Speaker 1>that came back?</v>

1473
00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Surgeries?</v>

1474
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Not An easy thing.</v>

1475
00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Like there's not like a small deal.</v>

1476
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.880
<v Speaker 1>You're taking pieces of,</v>

1477
00:38:36.881 --> 00:38:39.160
<v Speaker 1>your disc is out for a while at a diskectomy,</v>

1478
00:38:39.161 --> 00:38:39.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1479
00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Is that correct?</v>

1480
00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:40.540
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

1481
00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:41.340
<v Speaker 1>That means the,</v>

1482
00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.360
<v Speaker 1>the Gel that separates your discs.</v>

1483
00:38:43.361 --> 00:38:45.940
<v Speaker 1>He had a piece of it removed because it was pressing into his nerve.</v>

1484
00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:46.411
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

1485
00:38:46.411 --> 00:38:49.660
<v Speaker 1>it's very controversial procedure because some people feel like you don't have</v>

1486
00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:50.051
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>

1487
00:38:50.051 --> 00:38:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Like Louie Simmons,</v>

1488
00:38:50.891 --> 00:38:52.540
<v Speaker 1>the guy from west side Barbell,</v>

1489
00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:53.590
<v Speaker 1>they uh,</v>

1490
00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:57.700
<v Speaker 1>wanted to take him and fuse his discs and that's why he created that machine</v>

1491
00:38:57.701 --> 00:38:58.660
<v Speaker 1>that I have outback,</v>

1492
00:38:58.690 --> 00:38:59.441
<v Speaker 1>the hyper,</v>

1493
00:38:59.441 --> 00:39:00.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1494
00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:00.520
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

1495
00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.121
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

1496
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:01.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1497
00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.530
<v Speaker 1>the fuck's it called reverse hyper reverse.</v>

1498
00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:04.423
<v Speaker 1>Reverse hyper.</v>

1499
00:39:04.930 --> 00:39:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1500
00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.170
<v Speaker 1>that's a big glass of wine and not mad at that.</v>

1501
00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Want to try and get,</v>

1502
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.600
<v Speaker 1>I hear setting that's trying to get drums in the background.</v>

1503
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:11.521
<v Speaker 1>My favorite county.</v>

1504
00:39:11.521 --> 00:39:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1505
00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:12.693
<v Speaker 1>Tomahawks</v>

1506
00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:15.611
<v Speaker 1>brought the fire,</v>

1507
00:39:15.611 --> 00:39:16.430
<v Speaker 1>get involved in the case.</v>

1508
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:17.380
<v Speaker 1>What do you do with Kane?</v>

1509
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:18.303
<v Speaker 1>You got to be careful.</v>

1510
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:19.540
<v Speaker 1>You got to rehab that back,</v>

1511
00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:19.781
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1512
00:39:19.781 --> 00:39:19.961
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1513
00:39:19.961 --> 00:39:22.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not necessarily a big fan of cutting your back right away.</v>

1514
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:26.410
<v Speaker 1>I think you got to take some time off a training and really heal that bitch up</v>

1515
00:39:26.411 --> 00:39:27.010
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>

1516
00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:28.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure you already had surgery.</v>

1517
00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Here's my thoughts though.</v>

1518
00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:31.870
<v Speaker 1>If you want to get back into it really quick,</v>

1519
00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:32.883
<v Speaker 1>that's the way to do it.</v>

1520
00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:34.780
<v Speaker 1>But longterm health,</v>

1521
00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm not entirely convinced I need,</v>

1522
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:37.751
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1523
00:39:37.751 --> 00:39:38.980
<v Speaker 1>obviously I'm not a doctor,</v>

1524
00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.540
<v Speaker 1>but I've recovered from bulging discs.</v>

1525
00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:45.250
<v Speaker 1>I had a bulging disc in my back that doesn't exist anymore.</v>

1526
00:39:45.251 --> 00:39:46.630
<v Speaker 1>And a bulging disc in my neck.</v>

1527
00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:47.920
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist anymore.</v>

1528
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:49.060
<v Speaker 1>If you look at it on the Mri,</v>

1529
00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:49.923
<v Speaker 1>it looks different.</v>

1530
00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.150
<v Speaker 1>It's from long term Rehab.</v>

1531
00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:54.160
<v Speaker 1>I had to take a lot of time off a rolling.</v>

1532
00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:58.390
<v Speaker 1>I had to do spinal decompression with a,</v>

1533
00:39:58.391 --> 00:39:59.141
<v Speaker 1>I did it at a,</v>

1534
00:39:59.141 --> 00:40:02.500
<v Speaker 1>an an office with a chiropractor at first and then I got some machines we can</v>

1535
00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.311
<v Speaker 1>strap them up,</v>

1536
00:40:03.311 --> 00:40:04.090
<v Speaker 1>some mechanical sheet.</v>

1537
00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:05.230
<v Speaker 1>You strap your door at your house.</v>

1538
00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:08.290
<v Speaker 1>I went through Regena keen injections.</v>

1539
00:40:08.291 --> 00:40:10.870
<v Speaker 1>I went through a lot of rolfing and uh,</v>

1540
00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:14.070
<v Speaker 1>like breaking apart scar tissue that was pulling on everything and that</v>

1541
00:40:14.071 --> 00:40:16.030
<v Speaker 1>everything was all fucked up and tightened up.</v>

1542
00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:18.700
<v Speaker 1>It was just like years and years of wear and tear.</v>

1543
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.160
<v Speaker 1>But now through that and through yoga,</v>

1544
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:22.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any of those issues anymore.</v>

1545
00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.433
<v Speaker 1>They're gone.</v>

1546
00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:25.750
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what his,</v>

1547
00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.100
<v Speaker 1>how bad his was,</v>

1548
00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:28.121
<v Speaker 1>but I know mine was,</v>

1549
00:40:28.121 --> 00:40:29.410
<v Speaker 1>my fucking hands were numb,</v>

1550
00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:30.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1551
00:40:30.311 --> 00:40:32.770
<v Speaker 1>my left hand was going down my fingers,</v>

1552
00:40:32.771 --> 00:40:33.190
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

1553
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:34.270
<v Speaker 1>my two fingers,</v>

1554
00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:36.580
<v Speaker 1>my ring finger and my pinkie finger were going numb.</v>

1555
00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:37.630
<v Speaker 1>So let me ask you this Joe,</v>

1556
00:40:37.631 --> 00:40:38.950
<v Speaker 1>what do you do with the heavyweight division?</v>

1557
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:40.150
<v Speaker 1>You have their doom fight.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean get your body completely fucking healthy.</v>

1560
00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.340
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that have like severely criticized his strength and</v>

1561
00:40:51.341 --> 00:40:53.020
<v Speaker 1>conditioning videos that are online.</v>

1562
00:40:53.021 --> 00:40:54.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he works with this guy anymore,</v>

1563
00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:57.640
<v Speaker 1>but he was working with a guy that was like the strength and conditioning coach</v>

1564
00:40:57.641 --> 00:40:58.480
<v Speaker 1>and he had him doing these,</v>

1565
00:40:58.850 --> 00:40:59.620
<v Speaker 1>you haven't seen this.</v>

1566
00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:00.430

1571
00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1573
00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:12.360
<v Speaker 1>His form is according to Steve Maxwell and according to a bunch of other</v>

1574
00:41:12.521 --> 00:41:13.960
<v Speaker 1>respected Kettlebell trainers,</v>

1575
00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:15.100

1576
00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:18.970
<v Speaker 1>and this guy's got him lifting this insane weight and doing this completely</v>

1577
00:41:18.971 --> 00:41:19.100
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

1578
00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Almost like a shrug.</v>

1579
00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:21.130
<v Speaker 1>He's 200 pounds.</v>

1580
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:22.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1581
00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.920
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more than 200.</v>

1582
00:41:23.921 --> 00:41:25.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 200 plus here is,</v>

1583
00:41:25.601 --> 00:41:26.800
<v Speaker 1>it's two or three pounds.</v>

1584
00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:31.060
<v Speaker 1>So this is his train and like I'm telling you the reviews on,</v>

1585
00:41:31.061 --> 00:41:33.070
<v Speaker 1>on youtube by people that suited.</v>

1586
00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Know what the fuck they're talking about.</v>

1587
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:35.323
<v Speaker 1>Like watch this.</v>

1588
00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:36.270
<v Speaker 1>He's training it looks like,</v>

1589
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:38.720
<v Speaker 1>but look at this like what he's doing.</v>

1590
00:41:38.721 --> 00:41:39.650
<v Speaker 1>He's doing a shrug.</v>

1591
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:40.640
<v Speaker 1>That's not a swing.</v>

1592
00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:42.140
<v Speaker 1>That's not as swinging on a swing.</v>

1593
00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1594
00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:43.850
<v Speaker 1>No wonder you're back's fucked up.</v>

1595
00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:44.400
<v Speaker 1>You sir,</v>

1596
00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.580
<v Speaker 1>you can totally get fucked up doing this.</v>

1597
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:47.600
<v Speaker 1>The fuck is that.</v>

1598
00:41:47.601 --> 00:41:48.434
<v Speaker 1>It's wrong.</v>

1599
00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.630
<v Speaker 1>And the guy had him doing leg extensions.</v>

1600
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.350
<v Speaker 1>We'll look.</v>

1601
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:54.650
<v Speaker 1>The guy's obviously a big fucking guy himself and didn't mean shipping.</v>

1602
00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.330
<v Speaker 1>This is better than doing nothing.</v>

1603
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.651
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1604
00:41:56.651 --> 00:41:57.230
<v Speaker 1>You disagree,</v>

1605
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:59.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's not optimal.</v>

1606
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:00.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not the best.</v>

1607
00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:01.173
<v Speaker 1>He fighting</v>

1608
00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.180
<v Speaker 1>100% it's a big ass kettlebell.</v>

1609
00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Those bouncy balls that my son has.</v>

1610
00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man,</v>

1611
00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:11.060
<v Speaker 1>he's lost human as swinging and then doing like an upright row row.</v>

1612
00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:11.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1613
00:42:11.391 --> 00:42:11.571
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1614
00:42:11.571 --> 00:42:12.440
<v Speaker 1>well it's a shrug.</v>

1615
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:13.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like he swings,</v>

1616
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.121
<v Speaker 1>he swings,</v>

1617
00:42:14.121 --> 00:42:15.170
<v Speaker 1>he gets to wear his dick is,</v>

1618
00:42:15.171 --> 00:42:17.440
<v Speaker 1>and then he showed a shitty shrug up row.</v>

1619
00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:19.820
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucking nother kettle but not a kettle bell swing.</v>

1620
00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:22.100
<v Speaker 1>And it's probably not good for you.</v>

1621
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:23.300
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look right.</v>

1622
00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:26.660
<v Speaker 1>And Steve Maxwell was furious when Steve Maxwell saw it.</v>

1623
00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:27.831
<v Speaker 1>He was like that.</v>

1624
00:42:27.831 --> 00:42:28.460
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

1625
00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:28.850
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>

1626
00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:30.430
<v Speaker 1>he was like almost essentially calling you.</v>

1627
00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm like malpractice.</v>

1628
00:42:31.401 --> 00:42:32.960
<v Speaker 1>I told them I don't have a degree in it,</v>

1629
00:42:32.961 --> 00:42:34.280
<v Speaker 1>but that looks terrible.</v>

1630
00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.860
<v Speaker 1>So around the weight room I entirely fucking terrible.</v>

1631
00:42:36.861 --> 00:42:39.080
<v Speaker 1>You got with Cain and you've got to fucking super athlete.</v>

1632
00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:41.870
<v Speaker 1>A guy who just do what you tell him and fucking push through everything.</v>

1633
00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1634
00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:44.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's probably one of the reasons why he's been injured.</v>

1635
00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.460
<v Speaker 1>It's cause he's pushed through some,</v>

1636
00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:48.380
<v Speaker 1>some pain that maybe you should lay off of.</v>

1637
00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:49.920
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know.</v>

1638
00:42:49.921 --> 00:42:50.361
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1639
00:42:50.361 --> 00:42:50.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1640
00:42:50.571 --> 00:42:52.730
<v Speaker 1>maybe this can help me for him is perfect.</v>

1641
00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's perfect.</v>

1642
00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a real simple thing like maybe it's only sticking out a little bit on</v>

1643
00:42:56.571 --> 00:42:57.320
<v Speaker 1>one side.</v>

1644
00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.011
<v Speaker 1>If they trim it,</v>

1645
00:42:58.011 --> 00:42:59.180
<v Speaker 1>he'll be back to training four weeks.</v>

1646
00:42:59.181 --> 00:42:59.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1647
00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:04.520
<v Speaker 1>But I know that for a lot of people what you can,</v>

1648
00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:08.990
<v Speaker 1>you can get like real hasty and make a decision to jump into surgery and it's</v>

1649
00:43:08.991 --> 00:43:09.950
<v Speaker 1>not the best decision,</v>

1650
00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.690
<v Speaker 1>but especially when there's a lot of money on the line.</v>

1651
00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.250
<v Speaker 1>We have to fight though.</v>

1652
00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:14.930
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing for a lot of these guys.</v>

1653
00:43:14.931 --> 00:43:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Like they might have to fight in six months so you'd have to get the surgery</v>

1654
00:43:18.021 --> 00:43:21.950
<v Speaker 1>because realistically with six months of therapy you might not be ready again</v>

1655
00:43:21.951 --> 00:43:22.280
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

1656
00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:22.491
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1657
00:43:22.491 --> 00:43:24.020
<v Speaker 1>he has to fight before six months.</v>

1658
00:43:24.021 --> 00:43:25.820
<v Speaker 1>The heavyweight belts on your wait six months.</v>

1659
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:26.361
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1660
00:43:26.361 --> 00:43:29.510
<v Speaker 1>if his health is on the line and going flying arm triangle,</v>

1661
00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.160
<v Speaker 1>if his health is on the line,</v>

1662
00:43:31.161 --> 00:43:31.310
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1663
00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:33.170
<v Speaker 1>this guy's good man would wait.</v>

1664
00:43:33.171 --> 00:43:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Is this,</v>

1665
00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.530
<v Speaker 1>is this heavyweight two oh five this is the main card.</v>

1666
00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:36.971
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1667
00:43:36.971 --> 00:43:37.320
<v Speaker 1>May,</v>

1668
00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:37.611
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1669
00:43:37.611 --> 00:43:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Mischka Serp Serp.</v>

1670
00:43:39.681 --> 00:43:40.160
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

1671
00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:44.720
<v Speaker 1>KNAUF is Russian Guy Hop Russian dud couple of one two bodies on them.</v>

1672
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:47.630
<v Speaker 1>That was pretty brutal.</v>

1673
00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Good hair.</v>

1674
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Good hair on that guy.</v>

1675
00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:50.631
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying,</v>

1676
00:43:50.631 --> 00:43:50.871
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

1677
00:43:50.871 --> 00:43:51.380
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1678
00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:52.370
<v Speaker 1>if he's out six months,</v>

1679
00:43:52.371 --> 00:43:53.204
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna have to have it.</v>

1680
00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1681
00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:54.423
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the title,</v>

1682
00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:55.403
<v Speaker 1>the title,</v>

1683
00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.290
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have somebody else buy a Rothwell.</v>

1684
00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1685
00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:01.280
<v Speaker 1>He would do both of them in that time that it takes him to realistically come</v>

1686
00:44:01.281 --> 00:44:01.970
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

1687
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1688
00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.180
<v Speaker 1>But he's got,</v>

1689
00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:03.861
<v Speaker 1>I don't Dunno.</v>

1690
00:44:03.861 --> 00:44:05.750
<v Speaker 1>He's got to be careful and he's just,</v>

1691
00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:07.130
<v Speaker 1>he's still fairly young.</v>

1692
00:44:07.131 --> 00:44:07.281
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1693
00:44:07.281 --> 00:44:08.091
<v Speaker 1>I think Keynes like what?</v>

1694
00:44:08.091 --> 00:44:11.030
<v Speaker 1>34 34 is a lot of experience.</v>

1695
00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:11.511
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1696
00:44:11.511 --> 00:44:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Like it catches up,</v>

1697
00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:17.240
<v Speaker 1>but he could realistically fight at the highest level for the next three years,</v>

1698
00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:19.160
<v Speaker 1>but these injuries,</v>

1699
00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:19.940
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

1700
00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1701
00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:21.310
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

1702
00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:22.370
<v Speaker 1>It's real controversial,</v>

1703
00:44:22.371 --> 00:44:23.750
<v Speaker 1>but in my experience,</v>

1704
00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:25.310
<v Speaker 1>talking to different doctors,</v>

1705
00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:28.670
<v Speaker 1>there's doctors that say she gets surgery and there's doctors should say,</v>

1706
00:44:28.671 --> 00:44:32.460
<v Speaker 1>you should absolutely not concerned scale until you've exhausted all the</v>

1707
00:44:32.461 --> 00:44:33.030
<v Speaker 1>options.</v>

1708
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1709
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Either way.</v>

1710
00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:36.420
<v Speaker 1>Still in the grace of all time heavyweights easily.</v>

1711
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:36.871
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1712
00:44:36.871 --> 00:44:37.441
<v Speaker 1>Jake shields,</v>

1713
00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:38.610
<v Speaker 1>they were telling him he was fucked.</v>

1714
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:39.031
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

1715
00:44:39.031 --> 00:44:39.990
<v Speaker 1>You're telling him he couldn't,</v>

1716
00:44:39.991 --> 00:44:40.824
<v Speaker 1>couldn't fight again.</v>

1717
00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:43.200
<v Speaker 1>You should stop training started and he was really mad.</v>

1718
00:44:43.201 --> 00:44:43.411
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1719
00:44:43.411 --> 00:44:46.650
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking doctors are so negative fan because first of all they're just</v>

1720
00:44:46.651 --> 00:44:47.451
<v Speaker 1>regular doctors.</v>

1721
00:44:47.451 --> 00:44:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Dee Dee used to dealing with regular people.</v>

1722
00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1723
00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:52.410
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them not you stealing with the elite athletes and guys who are willing</v>

1724
00:44:52.411 --> 00:44:54.900
<v Speaker 1>to go through like the kind of rehab that a guy like Jake shields is willing to</v>

1725
00:44:54.901 --> 00:44:58.770
<v Speaker 1>go through like some serious fucking pain and discomfort.</v>

1726
00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:00.031
<v Speaker 1>But he got through it.</v>

1727
00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:00.864
<v Speaker 1>He's fighting now.</v>

1728
00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:03.300
<v Speaker 1>He just backed out of it.</v>

1729
00:45:03.301 --> 00:45:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Is fighting a world series.</v>

1730
00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it's a contract thing.</v>

1731
00:45:06.241 --> 00:45:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1732
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the full details?</v>

1733
00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:09.423
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1734
00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Apparently what it is is it's,</v>

1735
00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:12.360
<v Speaker 1>it's a title fight.</v>

1736
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:16.170
<v Speaker 1>So if he fights for the title because Paul Harris got stripped this trip.</v>

1737
00:45:16.171 --> 00:45:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Paul Harris after the John Fitch fight.</v>

1738
00:45:18.271 --> 00:45:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Cause they say held it too long.</v>

1739
00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1740
00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:21.830
<v Speaker 1>Was it a Fitch?</v>

1741
00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:22.061
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

1742
00:45:22.061 --> 00:45:23.260
<v Speaker 1>I thought he know</v>

1743
00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.010
<v Speaker 1>his eyes.</v>

1744
00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:26.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1745
00:45:26.221 --> 00:45:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Stripped him after that and then,</v>

1746
00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:29.480
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing about that,</v>

1747
00:45:29.481 --> 00:45:30.314
<v Speaker 1>the eye gouge.</v>

1748
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:33.570
<v Speaker 1>Like you either stop the fight like while it's happening.</v>

1749
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:33.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1750
00:45:33.871 --> 00:45:34.710
<v Speaker 1>You don't let it go.</v>

1751
00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:39.450
<v Speaker 1>I can't see and then to to like to a strip of afterwards for I gouges.</v>

1752
00:45:39.451 --> 00:45:39.781
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

1753
00:45:39.781 --> 00:45:41.190
<v Speaker 1>That's super unprecedented.</v>

1754
00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:41.341
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1755
00:45:41.341 --> 00:45:45.600
<v Speaker 1>maybe they saw tape and realized he was dragging his finger through it.</v>

1756
00:45:45.601 --> 00:45:46.050
<v Speaker 1>He was too.</v>

1757
00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:47.340
<v Speaker 1>He was hiding what he was doing.</v>

1758
00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:47.851
<v Speaker 1>It was different.</v>

1759
00:45:47.851 --> 00:45:48.684
<v Speaker 1>She'll just like,</v>

1760
00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:49.650
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1761
00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:51.510
<v Speaker 1>like transfer on midstream oil and it was very evident.</v>

1762
00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1763
00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Replay through one solid.</v>

1764
00:45:53.071 --> 00:45:53.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1765
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:53.750
<v Speaker 1>They're just like,</v>

1766
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.880
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1767
00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:54.331
<v Speaker 1>you're good.</v>

1768
00:45:54.331 --> 00:45:54.811
<v Speaker 1>Just keep on.</v>

1769
00:45:54.811 --> 00:45:55.381
<v Speaker 1>Keep on.</v>

1770
00:45:55.381 --> 00:45:56.160
<v Speaker 1>One's a cheater.</v>

1771
00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:56.970
<v Speaker 1>He was cheating.</v>

1772
00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:58.920
<v Speaker 1>He was definitely sticking fingers in the eye.</v>

1773
00:45:58.921 --> 00:46:00.390
<v Speaker 1>That was a real bad guy.</v>

1774
00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:02.490
<v Speaker 1>What people got mad about was the Kimora.</v>

1775
00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:03.840
<v Speaker 1>He held the Camorra,</v>

1776
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:06.930
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that was that bad because the referee was in the wrong place.</v>

1777
00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:07.531
<v Speaker 1>The referee,</v>

1778
00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:07.831
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1779
00:46:07.831 --> 00:46:08.520
<v Speaker 1>don't look at it again.</v>

1780
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:09.450
<v Speaker 1>He's tapping his back.</v>

1781
00:46:09.451 --> 00:46:11.610
<v Speaker 1>You're expecting him to recognize that that's a referee.</v>

1782
00:46:11.611 --> 00:46:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Tapping is back in the middle of a ferocious cage fight.</v>

1783
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:16.710
<v Speaker 1>The referee supposed to be in between the two of them.</v>

1784
00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.880
<v Speaker 1>He's supposed to stop it if it was a normal guy known for it.</v>

1785
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:21.300
<v Speaker 1>He's done it so often.</v>

1786
00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.470
<v Speaker 1>If it was a normal guy,</v>

1787
00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:23.431
<v Speaker 1>like if it was you,</v>

1788
00:46:23.431 --> 00:46:25.110
<v Speaker 1>if you had Mitch reone in that same position,</v>

1789
00:46:25.111 --> 00:46:26.580
<v Speaker 1>you hit that Kamora and you held it for that long.</v>

1790
00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Why the referee was tapping you.</v>

1791
00:46:27.751 --> 00:46:29.640
<v Speaker 1>I do not think you'd get the same kind of grief.</v>

1792
00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:30.031
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1793
00:46:30.031 --> 00:46:32.190
<v Speaker 1>I think you would say I was in the middle of the fight.</v>

1794
00:46:32.191 --> 00:46:33.690
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even realize referees tap me.</v>

1795
00:46:33.691 --> 00:46:35.610
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see him cause the referees in the wrong place.</v>

1796
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:36.990
<v Speaker 1>The referee in that position,</v>

1797
00:46:36.991 --> 00:46:38.580
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to get in between the fighters.</v>

1798
00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:41.400
<v Speaker 1>He supposed to be in front so he could look him in the eye.</v>

1799
00:46:41.401 --> 00:46:43.500
<v Speaker 1>We'll pour Horace has that Kimora he was out of place.</v>

1800
00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:44.371
<v Speaker 1>He was over here.</v>

1801
00:46:44.371 --> 00:46:45.240
<v Speaker 1>He's supposed to be over here.</v>

1802
00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:48.420
<v Speaker 1>What about Paul Harris versus Gary telling him,</v>

1803
00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:49.110
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

1804
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:49.943
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

1805
00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Where's that taking preschool gangsters.</v>

1806
00:46:52.681 --> 00:46:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Gary telenet holds.</v>

1807
00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Explain to Gary.</v>

1808
00:46:54.871 --> 00:46:55.704
<v Speaker 1>Tony Blair,</v>

1809
00:46:55.970 --> 00:47:00.180
<v Speaker 1>I hope Carrie is a Jujitsu show,</v>

1810
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.310
<v Speaker 1>the Jujitsu event held in England.</v>

1811
00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:03.630
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda like metamorris.</v>

1812
00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:07.770
<v Speaker 1>They have a bunch of single matches that are submission only and I think if</v>

1813
00:47:07.771 --> 00:47:10.410
<v Speaker 1>there's no submission it ends up being a draw 20 minutes.</v>

1814
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:11.910
<v Speaker 1>It's just like metamorris in that respect.</v>

1815
00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:13.650
<v Speaker 1>I think 1520 minutes.</v>

1816
00:47:13.651 --> 00:47:14.484
<v Speaker 1>I'm like that.</v>

1817
00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:15.870
<v Speaker 1>And they put on great shows,</v>

1818
00:47:15.871 --> 00:47:18.000
<v Speaker 1>great match ups and a man,</v>

1819
00:47:18.001 --> 00:47:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Gary Tonin is taken on.</v>

1820
00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:20.723
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>

1821
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:23.370
<v Speaker 1>That is so fucking gangster.</v>

1822
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:23.950
<v Speaker 1>I agree with.</v>

1823
00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:25.910
<v Speaker 1>I saw scared wants to,</v>

1824
00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:29.010
<v Speaker 1>he's the only guy that's asking for Paul Horez.</v>

1825
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants</v>

1826
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:31.060
<v Speaker 2>Paul Harris.</v>

1827
00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:32.530
<v Speaker 2>Just in general buddy.</v>

1828
00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:34.690
<v Speaker 2>The last five guys that are far powers.</v>

1829
00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:35.800
<v Speaker 2>It's because they just,</v>

1830
00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:39.070
<v Speaker 2>they offered the fucking fight to them and had no one's going after him,</v>

1831
00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:40.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1832
00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:42.520
<v Speaker 2>and then just graphical Horace.</v>

1833
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:44.580
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1834
00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:44.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1835
00:47:44.771 --> 00:47:47.260
<v Speaker 2>it's highly possible that he's going to Eleague luck Paul Harris.</v>

1836
00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.620
<v Speaker 2>But it gives you an idea how good Jake shields was because he was beating Paul</v>

1837
00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Harris up on the ground.</v>

1838
00:47:51.551 --> 00:47:52.870
<v Speaker 2>He was controlling his body.</v>

1839
00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:54.791
<v Speaker 2>He's unbelievable.</v>

1840
00:47:54.791 --> 00:47:55.241
<v Speaker 2>Hey Jake.</v>

1841
00:47:55.241 --> 00:47:57.490
<v Speaker 2>Jake shields is one of the past.</v>

1842
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:58.420
<v Speaker 2>Hey tone in though,</v>

1843
00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.330
<v Speaker 2>when we saw him at your event,</v>

1844
00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.170
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1845
00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:01.330
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1846
00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:03.470
<v Speaker 2>you were talking to of mirror last time I saw something like a motherfucker.</v>

1847
00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:05.330
<v Speaker 2>He was eating these dudes up.</v>

1848
00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:05.921
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

1849
00:48:05.921 --> 00:48:07.750
<v Speaker 2>Then leg lock came that John Danaher,</v>

1850
00:48:07.751 --> 00:48:09.970
<v Speaker 2>her leg lock game is very high level man.</v>

1851
00:48:09.971 --> 00:48:10.804
<v Speaker 2>Him and Eddie,</v>

1852
00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:12.003
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Cummins,</v>

1853
00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:12.201
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1854
00:48:12.201 --> 00:48:14.110
<v Speaker 2>both of those guys are fucking wizards man.</v>

1855
00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:16.240
<v Speaker 2>And Danaher apparently is a wizard to like,</v>

1856
00:48:16.241 --> 00:48:17.530
<v Speaker 2>I never seen Donna her role,</v>

1857
00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:18.850
<v Speaker 2>but everybody says he's just,</v>

1858
00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:19.350
<v Speaker 2>he's sad.</v>

1859
00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:23.230
<v Speaker 2>He's so God damn smart and I'll start it with dean lister Douglas or went to</v>

1860
00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:28.260
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] in like late nineties 2000 2001 and dean lister came into the</v>

1861
00:48:28.541 --> 00:48:30.910
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu world already as a sambal guy.</v>

1862
00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:32.440
<v Speaker 2>So he was always the guy,</v>

1863
00:48:32.441 --> 00:48:33.460
<v Speaker 2>even as a white belt,</v>

1864
00:48:33.461 --> 00:48:35.320
<v Speaker 2>as a blue belt in southern California.</v>

1865
00:48:35.321 --> 00:48:36.154
<v Speaker 2>Dean,</v>

1866
00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:37.150
<v Speaker 2>we grew up together,</v>

1867
00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:37.860
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu.</v>

1868
00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.460
<v Speaker 2>He was always that leg lock dude,</v>

1869
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:42.100
<v Speaker 2>that Samo guy who got into Jujitsu.</v>

1870
00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:45.970
<v Speaker 2>So that dude dean lister goes on to win Abu Dhabi,</v>

1871
00:48:45.971 --> 00:48:50.971
<v Speaker 2>absolute leg lock and fuck and everybody that knee bar that he hits Salo Roberto</v>

1872
00:48:51.251 --> 00:48:56.251
<v Speaker 2>with Holy Shit in 2003 watch that shit to the knee bar.</v>

1873
00:48:56.441 --> 00:48:59.800
<v Speaker 2>He had solid Robero solar barrel was like one of the best ever,</v>

1874
00:48:59.801 --> 00:49:01.780
<v Speaker 2>one of the greatest players ever.</v>

1875
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.660
<v Speaker 2>And doing that.</v>

1876
00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:07.180
<v Speaker 2>That knee bar that he got him with was Gary Tone and I don't want the current</v>

1877
00:49:07.181 --> 00:49:07.690
<v Speaker 2>rank are,</v>

1878
00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:08.590
<v Speaker 2>but as he number one,</v>

1879
00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:09.640
<v Speaker 2>he in person,</v>

1880
00:49:09.641 --> 00:49:13.780
<v Speaker 2>he might be the best I've ever seen real official rankings because there's a</v>

1881
00:49:13.781 --> 00:49:14.614
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>

1882
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:17.320
<v Speaker 2>there's a point game and then there's a submission only game.</v>

1883
00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:17.591
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1884
00:49:17.591 --> 00:49:18.700
<v Speaker 2>but let me finish really quick.</v>

1885
00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:19.571
<v Speaker 2>So that guy,</v>

1886
00:49:19.571 --> 00:49:20.440
<v Speaker 2>dean lister,</v>

1887
00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:25.530
<v Speaker 2>he goes to Hem Zos and Danaher's there Danaher's a a little prodigy and he</v>

1888
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:28.560
<v Speaker 2>leaves an impression with a debt.</v>

1889
00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:28.970
<v Speaker 2>Danner,</v>

1890
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:30.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he left.</v>

1891
00:49:30.131 --> 00:49:30.850
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1892
00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:31.570
<v Speaker 2>he left a couple,</v>

1893
00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:31.931
<v Speaker 2>oh man,</v>

1894
00:49:31.931 --> 00:49:33.000
<v Speaker 2>he's fucked is Jello.</v>

1895
00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:38.680
<v Speaker 2>And the Danaher took what he learned from Dean lister and he just blew that shit</v>

1896
00:49:38.681 --> 00:49:39.190
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1897
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:40.720
<v Speaker 2>And Dan is like a scientist,</v>

1898
00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:43.480
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a physicist or something or so rock.</v>

1899
00:49:43.481 --> 00:49:46.270
<v Speaker 2>Under Armour has her phd in philosophy and something like that.</v>

1900
00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:47.570
<v Speaker 2>Philosophy and Houston,</v>

1901
00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:48.940
<v Speaker 2>hence I used to give him,</v>

1902
00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:49.990
<v Speaker 2>hence her back.</v>

1903
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.890
<v Speaker 2>This is literally,</v>

1904
00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:51.281
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1905
00:49:51.281 --> 00:49:53.020
<v Speaker 2>I've got 2003 or whatever.</v>

1906
00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:57.490
<v Speaker 2>Hansa when somebody come into kind of challenge and somebody who's really good,</v>

1907
00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:00.520
<v Speaker 2>he would kind of casually give John,</v>

1908
00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:01.121
<v Speaker 2>he'd said,</v>

1909
00:50:01.121 --> 00:50:03.100
<v Speaker 2>roll with John for a while and see how you do first.</v>

1910
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.480
<v Speaker 2>And John would just,</v>

1911
00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:08.740
<v Speaker 2>you'd watch him tap these dudes like these really good Samo guys or whoever they</v>

1912
00:50:08.741 --> 00:50:09.490
<v Speaker 2>were and he just,</v>

1913
00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:10.060
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

1914
00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:11.230
<v Speaker 2>he was moving in slow motion.</v>

1915
00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:12.603
<v Speaker 2>He's a minimalist,</v>

1916
00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:13.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1917
00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.940
<v Speaker 2>He's just really smart ones.</v>

1918
00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:19.000
<v Speaker 2>He was a builder or power lifter</v>

1919
00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:25.930
<v Speaker 2>and then just ridiculous as strong and he wanted to learn martial arts to deal</v>

1920
00:50:25.931 --> 00:50:26.764
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1921
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:28.040
<v Speaker 2>like in bouncing</v>

1922
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:28.581
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>

1923
00:50:28.581 --> 00:50:30.080
<v Speaker 1>he realized I should probably have some skills.</v>

1924
00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:30.961
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

1925
00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1926
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:31.941
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea.</v>

1927
00:50:31.941 --> 00:50:32.930
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't look like it now,</v>

1928
00:50:32.931 --> 00:50:33.191
<v Speaker 1>but he's,</v>

1929
00:50:33.191 --> 00:50:34.760
<v Speaker 1>he's still obviously very strong.</v>

1930
00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:35.541
<v Speaker 1>If you look at him,</v>

1931
00:50:35.541 --> 00:50:36.590
<v Speaker 1>he's thick and fit,</v>

1932
00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:39.920
<v Speaker 1>but apparently he used to be like really bad and my summer a UFC event,</v>

1933
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:44.390
<v Speaker 1>he was like at the bar afterwards and he had on a fucking rash guard and some</v>

1934
00:50:44.391 --> 00:50:45.390
<v Speaker 1>jeans tucked in.</v>

1935
00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:46.810
<v Speaker 1>No fucks given me.</v>

1936
00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.320
<v Speaker 1>These guys have Alzheimer's wedding.</v>

1937
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:49.100
<v Speaker 1>That's his thing.</v>

1938
00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:50.410
<v Speaker 1>He was dead.</v>

1939
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.590
<v Speaker 1>So gangster always salmon.</v>

1940
00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:53.120
<v Speaker 1>Her and I,</v>

1941
00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.570
<v Speaker 1>every time he wasn't stop foods.</v>

1942
00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1943
00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:56.750
<v Speaker 1>he's created Eddie Cummings,</v>

1944
00:50:56.751 --> 00:50:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Gary Tonin,</v>

1945
00:50:57.970 --> 00:50:59.860
<v Speaker 1>because Gary Tonin went to hens,</v>

1946
00:50:59.861 --> 00:51:03.050
<v Speaker 1>owes to train with Danner and he didn't have any leg locks.</v>

1947
00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:04.460
<v Speaker 1>He was all rear naked choke.</v>

1948
00:51:04.461 --> 00:51:05.030
<v Speaker 1>He had his,</v>

1949
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1950
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.631
<v Speaker 1>basic.</v>

1951
00:51:05.631 --> 00:51:06.650
<v Speaker 1>He was already a black belt.</v>

1952
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:10.190
<v Speaker 1>He went to Dan or that's when he started learning the leg locks from him and</v>

1953
00:51:10.191 --> 00:51:11.030
<v Speaker 1>through Eddie Cummings.</v>

1954
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.420
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

1955
00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:11.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1956
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:14.480
<v Speaker 1>then him and Eddie come and just became like best friends and training partners.</v>

1957
00:51:14.481 --> 00:51:15.570
<v Speaker 1>I was so impressed with Gary.</v>

1958
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.551
<v Speaker 1>I took,</v>

1959
00:51:16.551 --> 00:51:17.970
<v Speaker 1>I took privates from John Donner.</v>

1960
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:19.820
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1961
00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:21.820
<v Speaker 1>like probably five and that was,</v>

1962
00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:22.581
<v Speaker 1>I got this new guy,</v>

1963
00:51:22.581 --> 00:51:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Gordon Ryan who just got his black belt is fucking amazing as well as the new</v>

1964
00:51:26.481 --> 00:51:26.661
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

1965
00:51:26.661 --> 00:51:27.650
<v Speaker 1>You're going to shuck corn.</v>

1966
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:32.080
<v Speaker 1>She knows another leg lock master the people.</v>

1967
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Forget Dave Terrell.</v>

1968
00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:37.990
<v Speaker 1>You remember Dave to WRAL versus Ricardo Almeida in 2003 in Abu Dhabi.</v>

1969
00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Don't remember that dude.</v>

1970
00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Dave Terrell had some nasty ass fucking leg locks.</v>

1971
00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:45.920
<v Speaker 1>Dave Tarell was so explosive.</v>

1972
00:51:45.921 --> 00:51:48.620
<v Speaker 1>I've heard legendary stories about him in the training room.</v>

1973
00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:49.731
<v Speaker 1>He's the best ever.</v>

1974
00:51:49.731 --> 00:51:50.241
<v Speaker 1>I saw it.</v>

1975
00:51:50.241 --> 00:51:52.760
<v Speaker 1>I was seeing him compete like watching him and Abu Dhabi,</v>

1976
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:56.150
<v Speaker 1>I always expected he was going to be UFC champion because he went into MMA,</v>

1977
00:51:56.151 --> 00:51:57.320
<v Speaker 1>starts smashing people.</v>

1978
00:51:57.321 --> 00:51:59.090
<v Speaker 1>He knocked out Matt Lindland at first round,</v>

1979
00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:04.420
<v Speaker 1>but Evan Tanner got him and he also had a series of catastrophic ear injuries.</v>

1980
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:07.370
<v Speaker 1>He had to have it removed from his head.</v>

1981
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.831
<v Speaker 1>Why can't,</v>

1982
00:52:07.831 --> 00:52:11.810
<v Speaker 1>it's like staff inside his head from his ear.</v>

1983
00:52:11.811 --> 00:52:13.700
<v Speaker 1>His ears were just Gonzo,</v>

1984
00:52:13.701 --> 00:52:14.031
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1985
00:52:14.031 --> 00:52:17.360
<v Speaker 1>They were like these just fucking ash trays on his head.</v>

1986
00:52:17.361 --> 00:52:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Hard as a rock,</v>

1987
00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:19.790
<v Speaker 1>just all cauliflower.</v>

1988
00:52:19.791 --> 00:52:20.001
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

1989
00:52:20.001 --> 00:52:23.240
<v Speaker 1>But apparently like just years and years of hard training yet he got an</v>

1990
00:52:23.241 --> 00:52:26.680
<v Speaker 1>infection inside his ear and they had to take it on his bike,</v>

1991
00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:28.790
<v Speaker 1>his whole fucking ear off his head,</v>

1992
00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:30.170
<v Speaker 1>clean it all out,</v>

1993
00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:34.070
<v Speaker 1>like try to fuse it and swap it and cauterize it.</v>

1994
00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:36.110
<v Speaker 1>She get could get it to stop oozing,</v>

1995
00:52:36.111 --> 00:52:38.350
<v Speaker 1>pus you in,</v>

1996
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:40.190
<v Speaker 1>your ear falls off and it didn't work.</v>

1997
00:52:40.191 --> 00:52:42.540
<v Speaker 1>They had to do it again like he's got he,</v>

1998
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:43.490
<v Speaker 1>he went through like,</v>

1999
00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:45.380
<v Speaker 1>and like when your ears fucked.</v>

2000
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had an earache or can your,</v>

2001
00:52:48.930 --> 00:52:50.360
<v Speaker 1>your equilibrium's off?</v>

2002
00:52:50.361 --> 00:52:51.400
<v Speaker 1>You can't do shit or worse.</v>

2003
00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:53.590
<v Speaker 1>So he's like a mythical creature and uh,</v>

2004
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:54.790
<v Speaker 1>nor nor cal two.</v>

2005
00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:57.900
<v Speaker 1>And there's so many crazy stories about that guy who was Syme compete.</v>

2006
00:52:57.940 --> 00:52:58.341
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2007
00:52:58.341 --> 00:53:02.120
<v Speaker 1>that fucking guy moves like a ghost as fast as fuck.</v>

2008
00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:03.380
<v Speaker 1>And his students,</v>

2009
00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:03.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2010
00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:04.161
<v Speaker 1>one of them,</v>

2011
00:53:04.161 --> 00:53:04.791
<v Speaker 1>Joe Soto,</v>

2012
00:53:04.791 --> 00:53:07.220
<v Speaker 1>they're so good at leg lock defense.</v>

2013
00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Joe Soto,</v>

2014
00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:09.740
<v Speaker 1>when you're generally,</v>

2015
00:53:09.741 --> 00:53:11.900
<v Speaker 1>when you game plan against Eddie Cummings,</v>

2016
00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:17.140
<v Speaker 1>the game plan is stay away from any kind of footsie battles you don't want to</v>

2017
00:53:17.421 --> 00:53:18.380
<v Speaker 1>battle was at.</v>

2018
00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:19.223
<v Speaker 1>Avoid it.</v>

2019
00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Avoid it.</v>

2020
00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Try to do the,</v>

2021
00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:21.420
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2022
00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:24.710
<v Speaker 1>the Super Basic Jujitsu strategy.</v>

2023
00:53:24.711 --> 00:53:25.471
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

2024
00:53:25.471 --> 00:53:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2025
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:26.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2026
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:29.760
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Lucas dupree and Abu Dhabi did a Gary Tonin.</v>

2027
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:31.740
<v Speaker 2>It was either Lucas the pre or Leandra low.</v>

2028
00:53:31.741 --> 00:53:33.530
<v Speaker 2>I kicked those guys mixed up all the time on,</v>

2029
00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:33.860
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2030
00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:37.610
<v Speaker 2>one of those guys that I will dobby when against Gary Tonin and he just straight</v>

2031
00:53:37.611 --> 00:53:38.490
<v Speaker 2>knee slice,</v>

2032
00:53:38.491 --> 00:53:38.911
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>

2033
00:53:38.911 --> 00:53:39.780
<v Speaker 2>Stayed tight,</v>

2034
00:53:39.810 --> 00:53:41.250
<v Speaker 2>stayed in side control,</v>

2035
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.910
<v Speaker 2>top half tight.</v>

2036
00:53:42.911 --> 00:53:45.600
<v Speaker 2>Never let Gary get anywhere near his legs.</v>

2037
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.231
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2038
00:53:46.231 --> 00:53:49.320
<v Speaker 2>that's the game plan against a leg lock guy like Eddie come.</v>

2039
00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:49.740
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2040
00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:50.930
<v Speaker 2>You try to play footsies with them,</v>

2041
00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:51.300
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2042
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:52.133
<v Speaker 2>you're retarded.</v>

2043
00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.610
<v Speaker 2>But Joe Soto,</v>

2044
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:55.440
<v Speaker 2>he went in there in the finals,</v>

2045
00:53:55.441 --> 00:53:56.274
<v Speaker 2>that Ebi three,</v>

2046
00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:57.510
<v Speaker 2>he went in there and just said,</v>

2047
00:53:57.511 --> 00:54:01.530
<v Speaker 2>he sat on his ass and I'm gonna play footsies with Eddie comes and it wore for a</v>

2048
00:54:01.531 --> 00:54:04.410
<v Speaker 2>long time and everybody was just blown away.</v>

2049
00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:04.801
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2050
00:54:04.801 --> 00:54:09.270
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck is he leaving his legs out there for Eddie Cummins grafters legs</v>

2051
00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:13.200
<v Speaker 2>and Joe Soto just displayed just this incredible,</v>

2052
00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:13.811
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2053
00:54:13.811 --> 00:54:14.620
<v Speaker 2>of defense.</v>

2054
00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:15.870
<v Speaker 2>His leg lock defense.</v>

2055
00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.310
<v Speaker 2>I was reffing gone.</v>

2056
00:54:17.311 --> 00:54:18.750
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck dude?</v>

2057
00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Is He really playing?</v>

2058
00:54:19.681 --> 00:54:20.700
<v Speaker 2>Footsies with Eddie coming?</v>

2059
00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:22.380
<v Speaker 2>He ended up getting caught.</v>

2060
00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:23.790
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Cummins did catch him,</v>

2061
00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:28.940
<v Speaker 2>but he showed tremendous fucking savagery for going in there and plan legs with</v>

2062
00:54:31.411 --> 00:54:31.770
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2063
00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:33.240
<v Speaker 2>And I talked to him afterwards and he said,</v>

2064
00:54:33.241 --> 00:54:33.451
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2065
00:54:33.451 --> 00:54:33.720
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2066
00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:37.530
<v Speaker 2>I roll with Dave Tarell all the Goddamn time that guys always after our legs.</v>

2067
00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:38.401
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding me?</v>

2068
00:54:38.401 --> 00:54:42.030
<v Speaker 2>We're used to this shit kill or be killed if you're in a leg lock.</v>

2069
00:54:42.031 --> 00:54:43.230
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of submissions,</v>

2070
00:54:43.231 --> 00:54:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Cummings knees all fucked up.</v>

2071
00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:47.270
<v Speaker 2>How about your boy Rob Barnett and Roswell?</v>

2072
00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:49.200
<v Speaker 2>And so it'll fuck called that insane,</v>

2073
00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:50.123
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>

2074
00:54:50.370 --> 00:54:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Insane.</v>

2075
00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:52.950
<v Speaker 2>Apparently when Rothwell gets a hold of your neck,</v>

2076
00:54:52.951 --> 00:54:53.800
<v Speaker 2>he just knows how to speak.</v>

2077
00:54:53.801 --> 00:54:55.110
<v Speaker 2>He was showing me what he got him in.</v>

2078
00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:55.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2079
00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:56.280
<v Speaker 2>that's horrible.</v>

2080
00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:57.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how his hands are though.</v>

2081
00:54:57.601 --> 00:54:58.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how he's gripping his hand.</v>

2082
00:54:58.730 --> 00:54:59.563
<v Speaker 2>I don't know it is either.</v>

2083
00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:01.680
<v Speaker 2>It's a 10 finger essentially,</v>

2084
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:04.070
<v Speaker 2>but the coach wanted to call it a go.</v>

2085
00:55:04.071 --> 00:55:05.220
<v Speaker 2>Go choke hard because it,</v>

2086
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:06.660
<v Speaker 2>it goes against your throat.</v>

2087
00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:11.550
<v Speaker 2>Sort of like a Google Plata or if there's no one hot on the UFC division</v>

2088
00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:12.540
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight division right now,</v>

2089
00:55:12.541 --> 00:55:13.970
<v Speaker 2>then no Rothwell's the police.</v>

2090
00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:14.830
<v Speaker 2>He's the beast.</v>

2091
00:55:14.830 --> 00:55:15.870
<v Speaker 2>You'd like being that guy right now.</v>

2092
00:55:15.871 --> 00:55:16.581
<v Speaker 2>Their confidence.</v>

2093
00:55:16.581 --> 00:55:17.850
<v Speaker 2>He pays the bees too though.</v>

2094
00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:20.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's real close like well after Steve Bay destroyed Orlowski like</v>

2095
00:55:20.731 --> 00:55:21.300
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2096
00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:22.290
<v Speaker 2>Steve Bay's right in there.</v>

2097
00:55:22.291 --> 00:55:24.930
<v Speaker 2>Man will face Mickey Gal.</v>

2098
00:55:24.931 --> 00:55:29.150
<v Speaker 2>It is year apparently one earlier tonight he did and he's a,</v>

2099
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:32.190
<v Speaker 2>I was hearing a lot of criticisms about a face off.</v>

2100
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.350
<v Speaker 2>Cm punk walked in.</v>

2101
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:36.570
<v Speaker 2>It was the first prelim ever to have a face off.</v>

2102
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:37.470
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like,</v>

2103
00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why he would want to do that.</v>

2104
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:43.200
<v Speaker 2>I feel like if he was smart he would just start fighting and small</v>

2105
00:55:43.201 --> 00:55:44.100
<v Speaker 2>organizations,</v>

2106
00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:45.293
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2107
00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:50.360
<v Speaker 2>I get that you want to get a lot of money because I'm the UFC is where it's at</v>

2108
00:55:50.881 --> 00:55:51.690
<v Speaker 2>with money.</v>

2109
00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:55.350
<v Speaker 2>But I would think like the smart move is what he's already done training wise.</v>

2110
00:55:55.410 --> 00:55:56.370
<v Speaker 2>Go to a real camp.</v>

2111
00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:57.391
<v Speaker 2>He goes to Rufus,</v>

2112
00:55:57.391 --> 00:55:59.670
<v Speaker 2>perfect roof is going to teach him how to uh,</v>

2113
00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:01.710
<v Speaker 2>strike as good as anybody in the world.</v>

2114
00:56:01.711 --> 00:56:02.190
<v Speaker 2>Agree.</v>

2115
00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:04.770
<v Speaker 2>And then you got real good wrestling with Ben Aspirin.</v>

2116
00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:06.240
<v Speaker 2>You got a real good Jujitsu,</v>

2117
00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:07.410
<v Speaker 2>you got everything there,</v>

2118
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:08.130
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

2119
00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:08.940
<v Speaker 2>everything there.</v>

2120
00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:10.050
<v Speaker 2>I heard they offered him,</v>

2121
00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:13.500
<v Speaker 2>I heard they offered him and go through the tough show and he's like,</v>

2122
00:56:13.501 --> 00:56:13.921
<v Speaker 2>Nah man,</v>

2123
00:56:13.921 --> 00:56:14.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to write to the shell.</v>

2124
00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:16.860
<v Speaker 2>So I think tough would have been better for them.</v>

2125
00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:18.270
<v Speaker 2>You get ratings.</v>

2126
00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:19.171
<v Speaker 2>We see how he does.</v>

2127
00:56:19.171 --> 00:56:20.340
<v Speaker 2>He gets warm up and then,</v>

2128
00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:20.731
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2129
00:56:20.731 --> 00:56:21.480
<v Speaker 2>then he goes,</v>

2130
00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:23.440
<v Speaker 2>but for your first fight to be in that octagon,</v>

2131
00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:26.040
<v Speaker 2>good fucking who was Mickey gauzy tough though?</v>

2132
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:26.231
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2133
00:56:26.231 --> 00:56:27.210
<v Speaker 2>he's a newcomer.</v>

2134
00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:30.880
<v Speaker 2>They found them on that looking for a fight show on HBO and a small show or in a</v>

2135
00:56:30.881 --> 00:56:33.460
<v Speaker 2>youtube rather in a small organization.</v>

2136
00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:34.240
<v Speaker 2>We are looking for it.</v>

2137
00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:34.540
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>

2138
00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:36.640
<v Speaker 2>he's a brown belt brown belt.</v>

2139
00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:38.260
<v Speaker 2>Significant that.</v>

2140
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:40.270
<v Speaker 2>That's what I read earlier today after he won,</v>

2141
00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:42.430
<v Speaker 2>he won by submission.</v>

2142
00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:43.600
<v Speaker 2>They said he was a brown.</v>

2143
00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:44.320
<v Speaker 2>I heard,</v>

2144
00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.460
<v Speaker 2>I heard blue and purple.</v>

2145
00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:46.950
<v Speaker 2>The UFC said brown belt,</v>

2146
00:56:46.951 --> 00:56:47.391
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know.</v>

2147
00:56:47.391 --> 00:56:48.224
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2148
00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.290
<v Speaker 2>well we might've gone is brown right before the fight.</v>

2149
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:52.900
<v Speaker 2>You know a little pump me up.</v>

2150
00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:55.780
<v Speaker 2>That's three more belts ahead of cm punk that she goes to the ground.</v>

2151
00:56:56.170 --> 00:56:57.003
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2152
00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:58.060
<v Speaker 2>That's a big difference.</v>

2153
00:56:58.061 --> 00:57:00.820
<v Speaker 2>So who knows what cm punk has been able to do in the,</v>

2154
00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:01.051
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2155
00:57:01.051 --> 00:57:02.320
<v Speaker 2>he's been training for over a year.</v>

2156
00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:05.110
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine if cm punk goes in and she gets murked?</v>

2157
00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:07.060
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like from the waterboy when Michigan,</v>

2158
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:08.740
<v Speaker 2>the water boy water boy,</v>

2159
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:10.430
<v Speaker 2>he certainly could write,</v>

2160
00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:13.180
<v Speaker 2>he could turn to get Merkt.</v>

2161
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:14.920
<v Speaker 2>Who knows if this kid can strike,</v>

2162
00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:16.180
<v Speaker 2>like if he can strike,</v>

2163
00:57:16.181 --> 00:57:16.691
<v Speaker 2>if the kid has,</v>

2164
00:57:16.691 --> 00:57:18.250
<v Speaker 2>you could use it to any good strike.</v>

2165
00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:18.941
<v Speaker 2>Good luck.</v>

2166
00:57:18.941 --> 00:57:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Learn how striking a year she's got doesn't have any striking under him.</v>

2167
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.870
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine?</v>

2168
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:23.191
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2169
00:57:23.191 --> 00:57:24.310
<v Speaker 2>like you're going to harass signs,</v>

2170
00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:25.540
<v Speaker 2>strike some,</v>

2171
00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:28.690
<v Speaker 2>some dude who's got like some serious knockout power and you're going to</v>

2172
00:57:28.691 --> 00:57:29.530
<v Speaker 2>practice for a year.</v>

2173
00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:30.220
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

2174
00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:31.840
<v Speaker 2>I like cm punk as a person,</v>

2175
00:57:31.841 --> 00:57:34.710
<v Speaker 2>but for the sport I think it's best if he gets murked</v>

2176
00:57:36.330 --> 00:57:38.920
<v Speaker 2>was that fucked all the way going to make headlines.</v>

2177
00:57:38.921 --> 00:57:41.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy when anybody says gets marked me too.</v>

2178
00:57:41.201 --> 00:57:43.990
<v Speaker 2>But gets high a style like when you get stuck,</v>

2179
00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:45.093
<v Speaker 2>I forget</v>

2180
00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:48.120
<v Speaker 2>about rumble and Jon Jones go,</v>

2181
00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:49.120
<v Speaker 2>you never know man.</v>

2182
00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:51.670
<v Speaker 2>Rumble could starch him and we said starts at like,</v>

2183
00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:52.720
<v Speaker 2>oh he could.</v>

2184
00:57:52.721 --> 00:57:54.250
<v Speaker 2>He could a good start to anybody.</v>

2185
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Anybody in the world rumble can hit you on the temple and your shit could just</v>

2186
00:57:58.151 --> 00:57:59.310
<v Speaker 2>go born you on your way.</v>

2187
00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:01.000
<v Speaker 2>I think John mops the floor.</v>

2188
00:58:01.050 --> 00:58:03.340
<v Speaker 2>He has the biggest head and long steep I've ever seen.</v>

2189
00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:05.380
<v Speaker 2>I rob could almost head is gigantic.</v>

2190
00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:06.460
<v Speaker 2>It's a big fucking head.</v>

2191
00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:08.200
<v Speaker 2>If he connects against Jon Jones,</v>

2192
00:58:08.201 --> 00:58:08.950
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2193
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:09.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you will though.</v>

2194
00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:10.750
<v Speaker 2>I think John takes him down.</v>

2195
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Where's the mountain?</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's what I say.</v>

2305
01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:11.570
<v Speaker 2>This guy's a scramble.</v>

2306
01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:12.710
<v Speaker 2>What were we're talking about?</v>

2307
01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Are we just talking about</v>

2308
01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:21.530
<v Speaker 2>a rumble and that quick work?</v>

2309
01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.280
<v Speaker 2>Ryan Bader.</v>

2310
01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:22.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2311
01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:23.720
<v Speaker 2>I keep trying to finish that.</v>

2312
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:23.960
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2313
01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Kimora like that's a hard move to pull off on a strong dude as it is.</v>

2314
01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:28.130
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2315
01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:31.910
<v Speaker 2>A guy strong is rumble was on top and you don't even have half panic I think.</v>

2316
01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.010
<v Speaker 2>But he had no control when he was holding on to it.</v>

2317
01:01:34.011 --> 01:01:35.360
<v Speaker 2>He had to do something with his legs.</v>

2318
01:01:35.361 --> 01:01:37.190
<v Speaker 2>He just didn't have the dexterity to get into a position,</v>

2319
01:01:37.191 --> 01:01:41.430
<v Speaker 2>like a half guard or something and then get up to the like to the dog fight,</v>

2320
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:41.840
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2321
01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.381
<v Speaker 2>Rumble said,</v>

2322
01:01:42.381 --> 01:01:44.810
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is thinking at empty half at one point,</v>

2323
01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:45.733
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2324
01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:50.030
<v Speaker 2>Well the problem is he's so fucking strong,</v>

2325
01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:50.760
<v Speaker 2>explosive.</v>

2326
01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.070
<v Speaker 2>The beginning of the round,</v>

2327
01:01:52.071 --> 01:01:55.670
<v Speaker 2>he's 100% he's not even remotely tired.</v>

2328
01:01:55.700 --> 01:02:00.500
<v Speaker 2>I jumped on your back or he's got you on your back and it's not top of you and</v>

2329
01:02:00.501 --> 01:02:03.290
<v Speaker 2>you know one of those punches is going to change your life.</v>

2330
01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:04.483
<v Speaker 2>One Punch.</v>

2331
01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:05.090
<v Speaker 2>Just one.</v>

2332
01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:06.770
<v Speaker 2>You gotta be really good on your back.</v>

2333
01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:07.611
<v Speaker 2>That's all that is.</v>

2334
01:02:07.611 --> 01:02:10.650
<v Speaker 2>You gotta be really fun when you take him to grant.</v>

2335
01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.560
<v Speaker 2>John Jones is going to ram right there.</v>

2336
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:14.930
<v Speaker 2>He tried to take an ankle.</v>

2337
01:02:15.370 --> 01:02:15.710
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2338
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:16.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying to John Jones,</v>

2340
01:02:17.511 --> 01:02:18.110
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>

2341
01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:20.190
<v Speaker 2>I promise he's going to incite</v>

2342
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:20.411
<v Speaker 1>trip.</v>

2343

2345
01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.231

2352
01:02:32.221 --> 01:02:32.881

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:36.301
<v Speaker 1>He's a monster.</v>

2359
01:02:36.301 --> 01:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Advertised.</v>

2360
01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Johnson was Johnson at Juco champion.</v>

2361
01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:40.230
<v Speaker 1>He asked.</v>

2362
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:41.063
<v Speaker 1>He might,</v>

2363
01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:43.951
<v Speaker 1>he might,</v>

2364
01:02:43.951 --> 01:02:45.380
<v Speaker 1>he has the skills to starch.</v>

2365
01:02:45.381 --> 01:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Anyone in the words of Joe Rogan.</v>

2366
01:02:46.711 --> 01:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2367
01:02:48.091 --> 01:02:49.890
<v Speaker 1>he's got the skills to stiffen them all up.</v>

2368
01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:53.490
<v Speaker 1>It's mother whether or not he can apply it against the very best of the best,</v>

2369
01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:56.700
<v Speaker 1>but he's at this edge like I don't think he's done improving.</v>

2370
01:02:56.850 --> 01:02:58.170
<v Speaker 1>So he's had this edge right now.</v>

2371
01:02:58.171 --> 01:02:59.370
<v Speaker 1>We're only a guy like core me.</v>

01:03:01.921 --> 01:03:03.540
<v Speaker 1>everybody gets the fuck beat out of him.</v>

2375
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Gustafson gets the fuck beat.</v>

2376
01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:06.810
<v Speaker 1>David.</v>

2377
01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:08.100
<v Speaker 1>I think it's five and five.</v>

2378
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:11.970
<v Speaker 1>We'll take a flight has been a rumble.</v>

2379
01:03:12.110 --> 01:03:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Johnson's good fight match up.</v>

2380
01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Got this and got headbutted.</v>

2381
01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Actually they had one fight and he starts,</v>

2382
01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.020
<v Speaker 1>he smashed him.</v>

2383
01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:19.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2384
01:03:19.291 --> 01:03:19.830
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2385
01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that doesn't happen every time.</v>

2386
01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:25.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know when they don't know what happens every time you got a good point,</v>

2387
01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:27.193
<v Speaker 1>no one goes,</v>

2388
01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:28.710
<v Speaker 1>it might not happen every time,</v>

2389
01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:31.110
<v Speaker 1>but with the data that we have currently available,</v>

2390
01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:37.660
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] scary guy who knocks everybody dead.</v>

2391
01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:41.070
<v Speaker 1>He knocked him dead.</v>

2392
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:42.090
<v Speaker 1>And so you've got to think,</v>

2393
01:03:42.091 --> 01:03:42.750
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2394
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:43.380
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2395
01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:45.810
<v Speaker 1>the kind of beating that Gustafson took in that fight.</v>

2396
01:03:45.811 --> 01:03:46.890
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to take it again.</v>

2397
01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:50.280
<v Speaker 1>I agree that that was a bad beat about the data when going to see Anthony</v>

2398
01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Johnson Bracey break.</v>

2399
01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:52.280
<v Speaker 1>He broke him.</v>

2400
01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:55.980
<v Speaker 1>He definitely broke guy break John Jones,</v>

2401
01:03:55.981 --> 01:03:56.730
<v Speaker 1>who's broken?</v>

2402
01:03:56.730 --> 01:03:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Everybody including DC DC.</v>

2403
01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:00.593
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>

2404
01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at the data we have here according to the data.</v>

2405
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:06.061
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2406
01:04:06.061 --> 01:04:07.130
<v Speaker 1>but that we're not talking about him.</v>

2407
01:04:07.150 --> 01:04:08.280
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about Gustafson.</v>

2408
01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.291
<v Speaker 1>I know you're talking about,</v>

2409
01:04:09.291 --> 01:04:09.571
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying,</v>

2410
01:04:09.571 --> 01:04:12.130
<v Speaker 1>but you got Jamie pull up that got,</v>

2411
01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:14.100
<v Speaker 1>but that was a monster fucking fight.</v>

2412
01:04:14.101 --> 01:04:18.480
<v Speaker 1>But definitely looks like watch this and everybody can get broken.</v>

2413
01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:19.653
<v Speaker 1>Everybody.</v>

2414
01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:21.293
<v Speaker 1>If a guy says,</v>

2415
01:04:22.310 --> 01:04:23.143

01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:27.150
<v Speaker 1>great ones don't get broke because they're not,</v>

2418
01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:31.800
<v Speaker 1>they don't fight anybody that much better than them at Lombardi said.</v>

2419
01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:32.634
<v Speaker 1>Vince Lombardi said,</v>

2420
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.740
<v Speaker 1>fatigue makes cowards of us all.</v>

2421
01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:37.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's a great shirt.</v>

2422
01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:37.791

2423
01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:38.790
<v Speaker 1>I'll look up fatigue.</v>

2424
01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:41.070

2431
01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

2432
01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:47.160
<v Speaker 1>retired.</v>

2433
01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:47.993
<v Speaker 1>I turned to such.</v>

2434
01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Everyone does cardio shaves motherfucker,</v>

2435
01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:52.830
<v Speaker 1>but you know what man,</v>

2436
01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I've been getting into this straight cardio over the last few months.</v>

2437
01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:59.250
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing like these hardcore cardio workouts just because I hate them.</v>

2438
01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:00.240
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

2439
01:05:00.241 --> 01:05:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of ridiculous sprints?</v>

2440
01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Like not like a Tabata protocol,</v>

2441
01:05:04.561 --> 01:05:07.770
<v Speaker 1>but I do a 32nd on 32nd off on an elliptical machine.</v>

2442
01:05:07.771 --> 01:05:10.710
<v Speaker 1>I I adjusted from 16 which is pretty hard.</v>

2443
01:05:10.711 --> 01:05:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Pretty stiff to 20 which is like you're wrestling this fucking thing and I'll do</v>

2444
01:05:15.241 --> 01:05:17.040
<v Speaker 1>these death sprints.</v>

2445
01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:18.460
<v Speaker 1>30 and 30 that's good.</v>

2446
01:05:18.461 --> 01:05:20.630
<v Speaker 1>Does it for how many 30 offhand?</v>

2447
01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:22.113
<v Speaker 1>It depends on,</v>

2448
01:05:22.690 --> 01:05:23.770
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what I'm trying to do,</v>

2449
01:05:23.771 --> 01:05:24.604
<v Speaker 1>but I do,</v>

2450
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:28.060
<v Speaker 1>I do a 45 minute workout and what I'm doing the 45 minute workout,</v>

2451
01:05:28.061 --> 01:05:29.140
<v Speaker 1>the first 15 minutes,</v>

2452
01:05:29.141 --> 01:05:30.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm just getting everything ramped up.</v>

2453
01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:32.680
<v Speaker 1>So the first 15 minutes was no sprints.</v>

2454
01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:36.850
<v Speaker 1>The first 15 minutes just keep it on 16 and going out at a very fast pace.</v>

2455
01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Then once I get to the first 15 minutes and I'm sweating,</v>

2456
01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:41.950
<v Speaker 1>then it's death runs.</v>

2457
01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:46.900
<v Speaker 1>I go on these 30 segment death runs it for a whole 30 minutes depending upon how</v>

2458
01:05:46.901 --> 01:05:47.110
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

2459
01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:48.490
<v Speaker 1>how long I can last,</v>

2460
01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:49.840
<v Speaker 1>how many death runs I can do.</v>

2461
01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Cause sometimes I can't do the death runs.</v>

2462
01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:55.960
<v Speaker 1>I just have to just pace myself at 16 but then when I feel like I've got my</v>

2463
01:05:55.961 --> 01:05:56.641
<v Speaker 1>heart rate down,</v>

2464
01:05:56.641 --> 01:05:57.190
<v Speaker 1>cause my,</v>

2465
01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:59.020
<v Speaker 1>my elliptical things got a little heart rate thing.</v>

2466
01:05:59.021 --> 01:05:59.741
<v Speaker 1>Kind of just want to go.</v>

2467
01:05:59.741 --> 01:06:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Do you have that heart rate monitor?</v>

2468
01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Beast of a workout?</v>

2469
01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:03.453
<v Speaker 1>You just got to,</v>

2470
01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:04.120
<v Speaker 1>oh they're all,</v>

2471
01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:04.781
<v Speaker 1>they all can.</v>

2472
01:06:04.781 --> 01:06:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Everybody uses elliptical machines.</v>

2473
01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.960
<v Speaker 1>They just kind of go steady.</v>

2474
01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:09.640
<v Speaker 1>But if you go on a death run,</v>

2475
01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:12.010
<v Speaker 1>you got to go on a save your life,</v>

2476
01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:13.150
<v Speaker 1>save your loved one,</v>

2477
01:06:13.151 --> 01:06:16.630
<v Speaker 1>save your mom from fucking I do it.</v>

2478
01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:17.380
<v Speaker 1>I just do it.</v>

2479
01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:17.531
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2480
01:06:17.531 --> 01:06:19.490
<v Speaker 1>but I mean like what makes you a spread?</v>

2481
01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:21.870
<v Speaker 1>My inner insecurity.</v>

2482
01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Like think you're sprinting,</v>

2483
01:06:23.861 --> 01:06:26.290
<v Speaker 1>but you're like during the sprint time you're like,</v>

2484
01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:27.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2485
01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:27.730
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2486
01:06:27.730 --> 01:06:29.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking proud as fast as I can,</v>

2487
01:06:29.711 --> 01:06:30.544
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2488
01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:35.410
<v Speaker 1>There's a number of revolutions per minute and I want to keep it above a certain</v>

2489
01:06:35.411 --> 01:06:35.591
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>

2490
01:06:35.591 --> 01:06:36.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

2491
01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:39.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what it is at at one 80 or at um,</v>

2492
01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:43.240
<v Speaker 1>at 20 but at somewhere where you want your heart rate to be somewhere around one</v>

2493
01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.260
<v Speaker 1>80 and the,</v>

2494
01:06:44.261 --> 01:06:46.600
<v Speaker 1>I forget what the revolutions are because there are different on the one that I</v>

2495
01:06:46.601 --> 01:06:48.700
<v Speaker 1>use at the gym versus the one that I use at home.</v>

2496
01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:51.550
<v Speaker 1>But you could have a number where you could keep it at that number.</v>

2497
01:06:51.551 --> 01:06:53.230
<v Speaker 1>So it's at like one 47 I think.</v>

2498
01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:57.310
<v Speaker 1>So when you hit one 47 and you just got to fucking keep it there for 30 seconds</v>

2499
01:06:58.810 --> 01:06:59.650
<v Speaker 1>and it's big,</v>

2500
01:06:59.651 --> 01:07:01.630
<v Speaker 1>deep Wim Hoff breaths the whole time</v>

2501
01:07:04.050 --> 01:07:05.890
<v Speaker 1>and just wrestle this thing for 30 seconds.</v>

2502
01:07:05.891 --> 01:07:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Do you know it's a nightmare and relax.</v>

2503
01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2504
01:07:07.850 --> 01:07:08.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2505
01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:08.591
<v Speaker 1>it's a nightmare.</v>

2506
01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:10.630
<v Speaker 1>He's setting just a little something.</v>

2507
01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Set the treadmill at 15 incline and it put it at four miles an hour and walk,</v>

2508
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:18.070
<v Speaker 1>walk for for 15 minutes.</v>

2509
01:07:18.071 --> 01:07:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Try to try to stay small pace towards their kill.</v>

2510
01:07:21.010 --> 01:07:21.641
<v Speaker 1>You did.</v>

2511
01:07:21.641 --> 01:07:22.870
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

2512
01:07:22.871 --> 01:07:23.201
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

2513
01:07:23.201 --> 01:07:26.770
<v Speaker 1>I talked about what the cardio I did from Metamora sprinting in the pool.</v>

2514
01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2515
01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2516
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:28.303
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

2517
01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2518
01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Tim Ferriss runs death runs in recovery.</v>

2519
01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:32.091
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's all about.</v>

2520
01:07:32.091 --> 01:07:32.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2521
01:07:32.210 --> 01:07:33.550
<v Speaker 3>Think about the pool thing though,</v>

2522
01:07:33.551 --> 01:07:38.551
<v Speaker 3>is the way I did it was there's a giant clock and every time it hits 12,</v>

2523
01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:41.080
<v Speaker 3>you sprint across the pool.</v>

2524
01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.960
<v Speaker 3>So when you get to the end of the pool,</v>

2525
01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:45.640
<v Speaker 3>whatever's left in that minute,</v>

2526
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:46.503
<v Speaker 3>you get to rest.</v>

2527
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:46.661
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2528
01:07:46.661 --> 01:07:46.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2529
01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:47.531
<v Speaker 3>So when you're,</v>

2530
01:07:47.531 --> 01:07:48.850
<v Speaker 3>when you're doing that,</v>

2531
01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:51.670
<v Speaker 3>no one has to tell you bust ass,</v>

2532
01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:53.760
<v Speaker 3>you're busting ass to rest.</v>

2533
01:07:53.761 --> 01:07:53.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2534
01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:54.611
<v Speaker 3>Cause you know,</v>

2535
01:07:54.611 --> 01:07:55.870
<v Speaker 3>after the first,</v>

2536
01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:56.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2537
01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.230
<v Speaker 3>maybe six laps or easy,</v>

2538
01:07:59.270 --> 01:08:00.820
<v Speaker 3>soon as the clock hits 12,</v>

2539
01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:02.260
<v Speaker 3>you bust ass across the pool.</v>

2540
01:08:02.261 --> 01:08:02.890
<v Speaker 3>Your sprint,</v>

2541
01:08:02.890 --> 01:08:06.370
<v Speaker 3>you get past and it's like you got 35 seconds to rest and then you rest and you</v>

2542
01:08:06.371 --> 01:08:07.204
<v Speaker 3>do it back.</v>

2543
01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:12.330
<v Speaker 3>As soon as it hits the 12 boom after like 12 dad in the pool.</v>

2544
01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 3>And no matter how chaotic it doesn't take long breathing is you got</v>

2545
01:08:16.450 --> 01:08:16.600
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2546
01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:17.930
<v Speaker 2>No matter how tired you are,</v>

2547
01:08:17.931 --> 01:08:21.110
<v Speaker 2>you got to keep your breathing on point because to swim your shit.</v>

2548
01:08:21.111 --> 01:08:21.800
<v Speaker 2>So you got,</v>

2549
01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:23.120
<v Speaker 2>you're like dying.</v>

2550
01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.170
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time,</v>

2551
01:08:24.171 --> 01:08:26.780
<v Speaker 2>there's something in your mind and you're on dude,</v>

2552
01:08:26.781 --> 01:08:27.950
<v Speaker 2>survival mode,</v>

2553
01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:28.731
<v Speaker 2>you're dying,</v>

2554
01:08:28.731 --> 01:08:30.410
<v Speaker 2>but you're breathing's gotta be perfectly,</v>

2555
01:08:30.411 --> 01:08:31.970
<v Speaker 2>you're going to swallow water,</v>

2556
01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:33.770
<v Speaker 2>you're going to swallow water and use.</v>

2557
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:37.880
<v Speaker 2>That to me was super fucking crucial in the grappling.</v>

2558
01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:38.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2559
01:08:38.061 --> 01:08:38.710
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2560
01:08:38.710 --> 01:08:41.720
<v Speaker 2>Wrestling with no matter what you're breathing,</v>

2561
01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:43.790
<v Speaker 2>no matter how chaotic your situation is,</v>

2562
01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:44.300
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2563
01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:44.710
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2564
01:08:44.710 --> 01:08:45.080
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2565
01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:45.440
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2566
01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:45.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2567
01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:48.740
<v Speaker 2>you practice breathing and chaotic situations.</v>

2568
01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:49.753
<v Speaker 2>Cause if you,</v>

2569
01:08:49.790 --> 01:08:51.890
<v Speaker 2>if you a hiccup at all,</v>

2570
01:08:51.891 --> 01:08:52.910
<v Speaker 2>you swallow water.</v>

2571
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:53.670
<v Speaker 2>This is a good fight.</v>

2572
01:08:53.670 --> 01:08:56.690
<v Speaker 2>Allows that Makowski and Joseph Benavidez this is a very good fight.</v>

2573
01:08:56.691 --> 01:08:57.680
<v Speaker 2>I've been looking forward to this.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Benevidez get another title shot.</v>

2575
01:08:59.691 --> 01:09:03.650
<v Speaker 2>You think maybe he's down at muscle farm and he's a training with bang again,</v>

2576
01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:05.150
<v Speaker 2>doing all his training with bang.</v>

2577
01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:05.641
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2578
01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:08.540

2579
01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:09.531

2583
01:09:13.701 --> 01:09:14.391

2584
01:09:14.391 --> 01:09:17.510
<v Speaker 2>Joe Jimenez Palmer had been bouncing all over though to Jackson's and went to</v>

2594
01:09:29.001 --> 01:09:30.470
<v Speaker 2>I think he's in his thirties as well.</v>

2595
01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:31.131
<v Speaker 2>And especially,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

2602
01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.720

2611
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:52.281
<v Speaker 2>It's a real question.</v>

01:09:52.281 --> 01:09:53.114
<v Speaker 2>Opens a gym.</v>

01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ Jesus.</v>

2617

2623
01:10:08.991 --> 01:10:09.171
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2624
01:10:09.171 --> 01:10:09.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2625
01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:10.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like you guys.</v>

2626
01:10:10.251 --> 01:10:11.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like an encyclopedia right now.</v>

2627
01:10:11.811 --> 01:10:12.770
<v Speaker 2>There's too many UFC.</v>

2628
01:10:12.771 --> 01:10:13.190
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2629
01:10:13.190 --> 01:10:14.180
<v Speaker 2>I can barely keep up.</v>

2630
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:15.590
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what the fuck he was,</v>

2631
01:10:15.591 --> 01:10:16.970
<v Speaker 2>but I saw him for the first time today,</v>

2632
01:10:16.971 --> 01:10:18.290
<v Speaker 2>the prelim and I,</v>

2633
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:19.131
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking,</v>

2634
01:10:19.131 --> 01:10:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

2635
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:21.620
<v Speaker 2>I guess Ray Borg,</v>

2636
01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:22.513
<v Speaker 2>because before,</v>

2637
01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:25.310
<v Speaker 2>before the fight started,</v>

2638
01:10:25.311 --> 01:10:29.900
<v Speaker 2>they had mentioned they got Scroggins thinks he has the best movement in MMA.</v>

2639
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:30.620
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

2640
01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:32.120
<v Speaker 2>oh my motherfucking God,</v>

2641
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:34.380
<v Speaker 2>how retarded can this guy be the best</v>

2642
01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:37.790
<v Speaker 2>fucking retard.</v>

2643
01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:39.920
<v Speaker 2>And then after one round I'm like,</v>

2644
01:10:39.921 --> 01:10:40.311
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2645
01:10:40.311 --> 01:10:43.030
<v Speaker 2>he might have here,</v>

2646
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:45.590
<v Speaker 2>can you,</v>

2647
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:46.730
<v Speaker 2>can you keep the pace?</v>

2648
01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:47.540
<v Speaker 2>And then he was,</v>

2649
01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:50.500
<v Speaker 2>he looked really good on the corner is grounded cause he rests,</v>

2650
01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:52.910
<v Speaker 2>his wrestling was very good and it's striking.</v>

2651
01:10:52.911 --> 01:10:54.410
<v Speaker 2>Was this like coming from also,</v>

2652
01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.590
<v Speaker 2>he left and he's fighting right at it.</v>

2653
01:10:56.660 --> 01:11:00.590
<v Speaker 2>He's thrown every kick and spinning everything like Holy Shit.</v>

2654
01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:04.850
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the best guys at standing in that sideways karate style stance and</v>

2655
01:11:04.851 --> 01:11:06.220
<v Speaker 2>using their front leg too.</v>

2656
01:11:06.390 --> 01:11:09.370
<v Speaker 2>He Front Lake side kicks your Thigh Front Lake sidekicks.</v>

2657
01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:12.240
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno if brainless does that mother fucker.</v>

2658
01:11:12.241 --> 01:11:12.891
<v Speaker 2>I'm correct.</v>

2659
01:11:12.891 --> 01:11:13.200
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>

2660
01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.700
<v Speaker 2>but he was talking about how,</v>

2661
01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:15.451
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know,</v>

2662
01:11:15.451 --> 01:11:15.901
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

2663
01:11:15.901 --> 01:11:17.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about Scroggins,</v>

2664
01:11:17.221 --> 01:11:18.001
<v Speaker 2>but Brian,</v>

2665
01:11:18.001 --> 01:11:21.360
<v Speaker 2>Stan was saying that when he fights a southpaw,</v>

2666
01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:22.980
<v Speaker 2>he fights more karate.</v>

2667
01:11:22.981 --> 01:11:24.090
<v Speaker 2>And when he fights ride that,</v>

2668
01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:24.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2669
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Orthodox,</v>

2670
01:11:25.170 --> 01:11:26.070
<v Speaker 2>he's fighting more and more.</v>

2671
01:11:26.071 --> 01:11:27.660
<v Speaker 2>We tire or something like that.</v>

2672
01:11:27.661 --> 01:11:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Like we fighting right hand the style and it's finally left hand this style.</v>

2673
01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:30.901
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2674
01:11:30.901 --> 01:11:31.561
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

2675
01:11:31.561 --> 01:11:32.400
<v Speaker 2>how cool is that</v>

2676
01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.823
<v Speaker 2>style?</v>

2677
01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:35.820
<v Speaker 2>But he changes it up.</v>

2678
01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:36.691
<v Speaker 2>Like right here.</v>

2679
01:11:36.691 --> 01:11:38.640
<v Speaker 2>I feel good when we tie right here.</v>

2680
01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:39.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm a karate guy.</v>

2681
01:11:39.571 --> 01:11:40.870
<v Speaker 2>You know why be fucked?</v>

2682
01:11:40.871 --> 01:11:41.490
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

2683
01:11:41.490 --> 01:11:41.910
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

2684
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:45.060
<v Speaker 2>his sideways stance allows them to use that front leg.</v>

2685
01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:48.420
<v Speaker 2>So if you're finding a guy that doesn't know like that style,</v>

2686
01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:49.710
<v Speaker 2>you can get away with a lot of shit.</v>

2687
01:11:49.711 --> 01:11:52.050
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're used to a guy who's fighting Moy Thai style,</v>

2688
01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.150
<v Speaker 2>would that light front leg and the more of a,</v>

2689
01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:55.470
<v Speaker 2>like a closed off stance,</v>

2690
01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.690
<v Speaker 2>you can get away with that with a Moy Thai guy,</v>

2691
01:11:57.691 --> 01:11:58.740
<v Speaker 2>but with a karate guy,</v>

2692
01:11:58.741 --> 01:12:00.210
<v Speaker 2>he'll stand sideways.</v>

2693
01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Like what standards.</v>

2694
01:12:01.981 --> 01:12:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

2695
01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:02.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2696
01:12:02.671 --> 01:12:06.150
<v Speaker 2>He'll stay on sideways and throw those fucking front leg sidekicks.</v>

2697
01:12:06.151 --> 01:12:07.260
<v Speaker 2>And you don't know what to do.</v>

2698
01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.630
<v Speaker 2>Like he throws him from way outside.</v>

2699
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:12.150
<v Speaker 2>He's like a lot of these Moyie Thai style guys.</v>

2700
01:12:12.150 --> 01:12:15.000
<v Speaker 2>They're standing right in front of each other for Zach.</v>

2701
01:12:15.001 --> 01:12:15.421
<v Speaker 2>What's north?</v>

2702
01:12:15.421 --> 01:12:15.820
<v Speaker 2>South?</v>

2703
01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:17.040
<v Speaker 2>He's all over the place.</v>

2704
01:12:18.130 --> 01:12:19.190
<v Speaker 2>It's still trained.</v>

2705
01:12:20.490 --> 01:12:22.260
<v Speaker 2>Anybody describe a fighter like that?</v>

2706
01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever heard of that before?</v>

2707
01:12:24.670 --> 01:12:25.030
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2708
01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:26.910
<v Speaker 2>Goggins probably told him that,</v>

2709
01:12:26.911 --> 01:12:27.121
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2710
01:12:27.121 --> 01:12:30.170
<v Speaker 2>he probably had a conversation with them about the different then before.</v>

2711
01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:30.690
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard?</v>

2712
01:12:30.690 --> 01:12:32.010
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard that before,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They look good and there's nothing that has nothing to do with stretching.</v>

3002
01:20:57.121 --> 01:20:59.750
<v Speaker 1>It's just you just haven't thrown a sidekick in a while.</v>

3003
01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:00.993
<v Speaker 1>It's a little rusty.</v>

3004
01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:03.593
<v Speaker 1>You can do it.</v>

3005
01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:06.850
<v Speaker 1>You gotta put your socks on before he came back and people ask him,</v>

3006
01:21:06.851 --> 01:21:08.070
<v Speaker 1>why do you want to put your socks on?</v>

3007
01:21:08.071 --> 01:21:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Does that help your kicking?</v>

3008
01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:10.680
<v Speaker 1>You want to put a shoe on?</v>

3009
01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3010
01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:12.330
<v Speaker 1>you like to kick with shoes on?</v>

3011
01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you still wear those shiny shoes so that you could throw a roundhouse kicks</v>

3012
01:21:18.751 --> 01:21:19.830
<v Speaker 1>quicker cause he pivots.</v>

3013
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:24.500
<v Speaker 1>If you have a shiny sol like that's terrible.</v>

3014
01:21:25.730 --> 01:21:27.210
<v Speaker 1>You got to pick your knee up.</v>

3015
01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:28.860
<v Speaker 1>You have no,</v>

3016
01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.930
<v Speaker 1>see it's not bad,</v>

3017
01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:34.500
<v Speaker 1>but you have a inherent flaw in your technique that probably was never,</v>

3018
01:21:34.530 --> 01:21:37.740
<v Speaker 1>never explained to you for 49 million.</v>

3019
01:21:37.741 --> 01:21:38.574
<v Speaker 1>Ain't bad.</v>

3020
01:21:39.450 --> 01:21:40.283
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty good.</v>

3021
01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:41.213
<v Speaker 1>Not Right.</v>

3022
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:42.900
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to get hit by that.</v>

3023
01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:45.553
<v Speaker 1>Get hit hidden.</v>

3024
01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Riding your shower.</v>

3025
01:21:47.550 --> 01:21:48.510
<v Speaker 1>That's where you would get hit.</v>

3026
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:50.423
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

3027
01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I washed my hands still spinning kicks.</v>

3028
01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:56.073
<v Speaker 1>Right</v>

3029
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.301
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3030
01:21:57.301 --> 01:21:58.520
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong though.</v>

3031
01:21:58.521 --> 01:21:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Sounds those genes or Helen.</v>

3032
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:03.630
<v Speaker 1>I used to being serious there.</v>

3033
01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:04.261
<v Speaker 1>Are you being serious?</v>

3034
01:22:04.261 --> 01:22:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Show me what?</v>

3035
01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Show me a real front lake side for real.</v>

3036
01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:07.680
<v Speaker 1>All Bullshit.</v>

3037
01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:08.513
<v Speaker 1>All Bullshit.</v>

3038
01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3039
01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:10.980
<v Speaker 1>just this from here and just throw it.</v>

3040
01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Let me see the spinning one.</v>

3041
01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:15.481
<v Speaker 1>Show him spinning.</v>

3042
01:22:15.481 --> 01:22:16.314
<v Speaker 1>One kick.</v>

3043
01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3044
01:22:17.530 --> 01:22:18.990
<v Speaker 1>that's my favorite that he does.</v>

3045
01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:22.240
<v Speaker 1>It's my favorite two old tear you.</v>

3046
01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.760
<v Speaker 1>You just all you have to do different.</v>

3047
01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:24.720
<v Speaker 1>The all you're doing wrong.</v>

3048
01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:25.920
<v Speaker 1>You're coming up.</v>

3049
01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:30.030
<v Speaker 1>You're foot is going up from the ground like an almost like a half moon,</v>

3050
01:22:30.031 --> 01:22:30.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3051
01:22:30.650 --> 01:22:31.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3052
01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:33.060
<v Speaker 1>You want to get your knee up higher.</v>

3053
01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.100
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the cool things about those jeans.</v>

3054
01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:35.993
<v Speaker 1>Way Higher than that.</v>

3055
01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:37.770
<v Speaker 1>You cool things about those June.</v>

3056
01:22:37.771 --> 01:22:38.011
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3057
01:22:38.011 --> 01:22:38.640
<v Speaker 1>There's genes.</v>

3058
01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:39.900
<v Speaker 1>These genes that were wearing,</v>

3059
01:22:39.901 --> 01:22:40.830
<v Speaker 1>they're like sweat pants,</v>

3060
01:22:40.831 --> 01:22:41.520
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3061
01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:42.420

3063
01:22:42.491 --> 01:22:43.020
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3064
01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Don't throw the kick until your knee is up.</v>

3065
01:22:45.570 --> 01:22:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Get your knee up first and then throw the kick.</v>

3066
01:22:47.851 --> 01:22:49.680
<v Speaker 1>The problem is you're doing both at the same time.</v>

3067
01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:49.821
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3068
01:22:49.821 --> 01:22:49.920
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3069
01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:50.430
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3070
01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Don't throw the kick into your knees up hot.</v>

3071
01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Lift your knee up way high past your waist and then throw the kick.</v>

3072
01:22:56.130 --> 01:22:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3073
01:22:56.940 --> 01:22:59.790
<v Speaker 1>me up first and then don't look over your stomach.</v>

3074
01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:00.840
<v Speaker 1>Look over your shoulder.</v>

3075
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3076
01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.260
<v Speaker 1>but knee first here.</v>

3077
01:23:04.261 --> 01:23:05.094
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

3078
01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:06.730
<v Speaker 1>This fucking hysterical.</v>

3079
01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:08.140
<v Speaker 2>This is ridiculous.</v>

3080
01:23:11.230 --> 01:23:12.310
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm drunk.</v>

3081
01:23:12.370 --> 01:23:13.203
<v Speaker 2>I can't watch.</v>

3082
01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:19.820
<v Speaker 2>Watch Joe is going to go off.</v>

3083

3093
01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:37.130
<v Speaker 2>Look over your shoulder like this.</v>

3094

<v Speaker 2>That's how you look.</v>

3096
01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:39.340
<v Speaker 2>I know that's not yet.</v>

3097

3104
01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:56.230
<v Speaker 2>I still think John Claude van Damme beats the fuck out of both of you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3116
01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:14.890
<v Speaker 2>I know John Claude van Damme would be proud.</v>

3117
01:24:15.670 --> 01:24:16.590
<v Speaker 2>Are you calling your shoulder?</v>

3118
01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

3119

3120
01:24:20.370 --> 01:24:21.203
<v Speaker 2>I'm like this.</v>

3121
01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:22.240

3123
01:24:23.261 --> 01:24:24.094

3124
01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:26.080
<v Speaker 2>it's just looking at it.</v>

3125
01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:26.920
<v Speaker 2>Don't look,</v>

3126
01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:27.671
<v Speaker 2>don't look at the foot.</v>

3127
01:24:27.671 --> 01:24:28.600
<v Speaker 2>He has a set of [inaudible].</v>

3128
01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Look at the foot honeydews on them,</v>

3129
01:24:30.250 --> 01:24:31.480
<v Speaker 2>right into the glutes.</v>

3130
01:24:31.530 --> 01:24:33.100
<v Speaker 2>Looking deeply into them.</v>

3131
01:24:33.970 --> 01:24:34.271
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:53.110
<v Speaker 2>Just fundamentally a little off a little bit.</v>

3143
01:24:53.111 --> 01:24:53.561
<v Speaker 2>He's been here.</v>

3144
01:24:53.561 --> 01:24:54.394
<v Speaker 2>So you get there,</v>

01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:56.120
<v Speaker 2>that span.</v>

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:57.820
<v Speaker 2>everybody fucks that up.</v>

3149
01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:58.870
<v Speaker 2>Everybody fucks that up.</v>

3150
01:24:58.871 --> 01:25:01.990
<v Speaker 2>It's a number one thing about the side kick that people get wrong and it changes</v>

01:25:01.991 --> 01:25:02.824
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

3152
01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:04.030
<v Speaker 2>If you learn to do it right,</v>

3153
01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:05.200
<v Speaker 2>you learned to get that knee up high.</v>

3154
01:25:05.201 --> 01:25:07.890
<v Speaker 2>The power differences fucking substantial.</v>

3155
01:25:09.010 --> 01:25:09.843
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You just gotta do it right with Rogan's help.</v>

3158
01:25:14.771 --> 01:25:16.090
<v Speaker 2>You could be the best</v>

<v Speaker 2>You can't be happy with the scoop</v>

3166
01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:37.120
<v Speaker 2>and the scoop doesn't exist.</v>

3167
01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:37.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3168
01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:38.140
<v Speaker 2>You can't do it.</v>

01:25:48.770 --> 01:25:49.570
<v Speaker 2>But it's not,</v>

3175
01:25:49.570 --> 01:25:51.430
<v Speaker 2>it's not a bad sidekick.</v>

3176
01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:53.980
<v Speaker 2>It's just you need to learn how to do it right.</v>

3191
01:26:09.771 --> 01:26:12.720
<v Speaker 2>You either do it right or you don't do it and that's the only way to be a good</v>

<v Speaker 2>I only kicked him in the tie pads but I fucked him up with body shots like body</v>

3223
01:27:29.241 --> 01:27:30.020
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

3224
01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:30.980
<v Speaker 2>They get launched</v>

3225
01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:33.231
<v Speaker 2>back kicks.</v>

3226
01:27:33.231 --> 01:27:33.531
<v Speaker 2>How many,</v>

3227
01:27:33.531 --> 01:27:34.070
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3228
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:37.610
<v Speaker 2>there's a video of me on youtube kicking the guard and he soars.</v>

3229
01:27:37.650 --> 01:27:38.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3230
01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:42.020
<v Speaker 2>he sources the video of me doing that and they took it down because it's too</v>

3231
01:27:42.030 --> 01:27:42.310
<v Speaker 2>dense.</v>

3232
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.981
<v Speaker 2>Too dangerous.</v>

3233
01:27:42.981 --> 01:27:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Makes Sense.</v>

3234
01:27:43.790 --> 01:27:44.690
<v Speaker 2>I slew him.</v>

3235
01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:46.013
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

3236
01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:47.323
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3237
01:27:49.780 --> 01:27:50.660
<v Speaker 2>I told you guys,</v>

3238
01:27:50.661 --> 01:27:52.730
<v Speaker 2>I called it a love that guy.</v>

3239
01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:53.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

3240
01:27:53.631 --> 01:27:54.340
<v Speaker 2>He was right.</v>

3241
01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:56.360
<v Speaker 2>I was playing a lot of games week in this corner.</v>

3242
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:59.540
<v Speaker 2>A kick to the body is always painful because your leg is strong.</v>

3243
01:27:59.570 --> 01:28:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Even if you have a half ass kick,</v>

3244
01:28:01.370 --> 01:28:02.630
<v Speaker 2>he throws a kick to the body.</v>

3245
01:28:02.631 --> 01:28:06.590
<v Speaker 2>It's usually stronger than most people's punches unless you're like some tune</v>

3246
01:28:06.591 --> 01:28:07.220
<v Speaker 2>off type care.</v>

3247
01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:08.960
<v Speaker 2>So your shoulders should take to kick around.</v>

3248
01:28:08.961 --> 01:28:10.970
<v Speaker 2>But when you learn how to kick and you kick,</v>

3249
01:28:10.971 --> 01:28:13.010
<v Speaker 2>good kick to the body is horrific.</v>

3250
01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:13.850
<v Speaker 2>It's horrific.</v>

3251
01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:15.050
<v Speaker 2>I save your shoulders account.</v>

3252
01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:16.670
<v Speaker 2>You should work on your body.</v>

3253
01:28:16.690 --> 01:28:16.970
<v Speaker 2>Stop,</v>

3254
01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:17.750
<v Speaker 2>dedicate your life.</v>

3255
01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:18.590
<v Speaker 2>All I'm doing,</v>

3256
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:19.740
<v Speaker 2>I cannot do the pocket.</v>

3257
01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:21.410
<v Speaker 2>Dedicate your life to kicking.</v>

3258
01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:23.710
<v Speaker 2>I think you can afford to pay.</v>

3259
01:28:24.110 --> 01:28:25.160
<v Speaker 2>Have to fucking,</v>

3260
01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:25.721
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3261
01:28:25.721 --> 01:28:26.760
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to kill him.</v>

3262
01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:29.613
<v Speaker 2>Kill him,</v>

3263
01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:33.073
<v Speaker 2>kill him.</v>

3264
01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:38.480
<v Speaker 2>Dude's will only be able to last like 90 seconds tops with Joe.</v>

3265
01:28:38.690 --> 01:28:39.270
<v Speaker 2>Joe's going to,</v>

3266
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:40.330
<v Speaker 2>he kicks hard,</v>

3267
01:28:40.331 --> 01:28:40.640
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3268
01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:43.610
<v Speaker 2>he's going to need eight guys at 49 he kicks his heart as anybody</v>

3269
01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:46.033
<v Speaker 2>have a few months.</v>

3270
01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:47.960
<v Speaker 2>That's $10,000 you do the kick harder.</v>

3271
01:28:47.961 --> 01:28:49.400
<v Speaker 2>I've been around kicking for a long time.</v>

3272
01:28:49.401 --> 01:28:50.270
<v Speaker 2>You kick harder the name.</v>

3273
01:28:50.340 --> 01:28:50.481
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3274
01:28:50.481 --> 01:28:51.370
<v Speaker 2>I learned it.</v>

3275
01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:52.910
<v Speaker 2>I just said I've been around kicking Toronto.</v>

3276
01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:53.810
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

3277
01:28:53.810 --> 01:28:54.643
<v Speaker 2>That'll feel dated.</v>

01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:55.560
<v Speaker 2>Do that.</v>

3279
01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:58.890
<v Speaker 2>If he kicks hard back in the day and I,</v>

3280

<v Speaker 2>and I was right next to him.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen.</v>

3292
01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:18.900
<v Speaker 2>When I saw him kick the bag of Beverly Hills Jujitsu.</v>

3293
01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:19.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3294
01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:19.940

<v Speaker 2>is just would take one and I'd be over.</v>

3296
01:29:22.170 --> 01:29:24.720
<v Speaker 2>There's no way I would survive if he kicked me once in the leg.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Who?</v>

3300
01:29:27.810 --> 01:29:30.000
<v Speaker 2>Shane Carlin was a gorilla.</v>

3301
01:29:30.130 --> 01:29:30.330
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3302
01:29:30.330 --> 01:29:32.690
<v Speaker 2>but he never threw every easily is too tempted to throw him.</v>

3303
01:29:33.010 --> 01:29:35.280
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't tempt to throw them in the fight because they thought to heavy weights</v>

3304
01:29:35.281 --> 01:29:36.114
<v Speaker 2>get counter.</v>

3305
01:29:36.450 --> 01:29:38.970
<v Speaker 2>He fucked up so many guys legs in the gym.</v>

3306
01:29:39.150 --> 01:29:40.320
<v Speaker 2>They banned them from kicking.</v>

3307
01:29:40.410 --> 01:29:40.531

<v Speaker 2>how am I gonna stop kicking?</v>

01:29:42.450 --> 01:29:42.571
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

01:29:42.571 --> 01:29:43.590
<v Speaker 2>that's terrible idea.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Why didn't they fucking pay people?</v>

01:29:52.110 --> 01:29:53.670

<v Speaker 4>so it was this mother fucker say before the podcast started [inaudible] he got,</v>

3431
01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:17.260
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about this for me.</v>

3432
01:33:17.350 --> 01:33:18.520
<v Speaker 4>I sucked you in.</v>

3433
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:19.623
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you bro.</v>

3434
01:33:20.730 --> 01:33:22.150
<v Speaker 4>I can't handle this on my local</v>

3435
01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:24.740
<v Speaker 4>kitchen.</v>

3436
01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:25.720
<v Speaker 4>About to go into Ketosis,</v>

3437
01:33:26.130 --> 01:33:26.963
<v Speaker 4>emotion,</v>

3438
01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:27.990
<v Speaker 4>emotional cutoff,</v>

3439
01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:28.841
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

3440
01:33:28.841 --> 01:33:30.010
<v Speaker 4>I think it's really easy.</v>

3441
01:33:30.011 --> 01:33:31.300
<v Speaker 4>Meet Misha and Holly.</v>

3442
01:33:31.330 --> 01:33:33.350
<v Speaker 4>I think if if Nisha keys,</v>

3443
01:33:33.351 --> 01:33:34.450
<v Speaker 4>it took Holly down.</v>

3444
01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:36.130
<v Speaker 4>If Meesha can't take Holly down,</v>

3445
01:33:36.190 --> 01:33:37.090
<v Speaker 4>Holly's going to win.</v>

3446
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:41.470
<v Speaker 4>She's easily going to precision or she can be shamed if she could take her down.</v>

3447
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:42.800
<v Speaker 4>If she could take her down.</v>

3448
01:33:43.690 --> 01:33:44.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't think,</v>

3449
01:33:44.350 --> 01:33:47.310
<v Speaker 4>I don't think Holly's Jujitsu is anywhere near me shows</v>

3450
01:33:50.910 --> 01:33:52.330
<v Speaker 4>and she's going to write her up.</v>

3451
01:33:52.331 --> 01:33:52.511
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

3452
01:33:52.511 --> 01:33:53.710
<v Speaker 4>Misha went three rounds.</v>

3453
01:33:55.450 --> 01:33:56.283
<v Speaker 4>Hit the brakes.</v>

3454
01:33:56.290 --> 01:33:59.230
<v Speaker 4>Let's not say she's going to do this because we really don't know.</v>

3455
01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:01.170
<v Speaker 4>I really have a problem when people get that</v>

3456
01:34:04.450 --> 01:34:05.201
<v Speaker 4>he's going to lie to her.</v>

3457
01:34:05.201 --> 01:34:06.034
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

3458
01:34:07.230 --> 01:34:08.140
<v Speaker 4>get her mind her up.</v>

3459
01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:09.670
<v Speaker 4>I don't really think we should say that.</v>

3460
01:34:09.671 --> 01:34:11.200
<v Speaker 4>You don't think that's a fair assessment?</v>

3461
01:34:11.201 --> 01:34:12.240
<v Speaker 4>Just disrespectful.</v>

3462
01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:13.030
<v Speaker 4>Disagree.</v>

3463
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.750
<v Speaker 4>This is what I think.</v>

3464
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:14.590
<v Speaker 4>I think honestly,</v>

3465
01:34:14.591 --> 01:34:16.210
<v Speaker 4>I think Misha Tate is a better grappler.</v>

3466
01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:19.050
<v Speaker 4>I think we should take dominated Sarah McMahon on the ground and flipped her</v>

3467
01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:20.860
<v Speaker 4>over on her back and held her down,</v>

3468
01:34:20.861 --> 01:34:22.180
<v Speaker 4>which is a giant accomplishment.</v>

3469
01:34:22.181 --> 01:34:22.420
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3470
01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:25.990
<v Speaker 4>How grappled her out ground around and showed some bad ass striking against</v>

3471
01:34:25.991 --> 01:34:28.590
<v Speaker 4>Jessica [inaudible] with a Ken strife.</v>

3472
01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:30.520
<v Speaker 4>I man also is not going to be ridiculous.</v>

3473
01:34:30.521 --> 01:34:31.630
<v Speaker 4>She's not going to charge.</v>

3474
01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:35.200
<v Speaker 4>She's not going to be Chin up face first Thompson out.</v>

3475
01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:38.380
<v Speaker 4>All I'm saying is that I don't think it's disrespectful.</v>

3476
01:34:38.381 --> 01:34:39.430
<v Speaker 4>I would never be disrespectful.</v>

3477
01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:40.580

3512
01:35:19.281 --> 01:35:20.210
<v Speaker 2>They send them to me for free.</v>

3513
01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:21.403
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's</v>

3514
01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:25.200
<v Speaker 2>the greatest strikers ever,</v>

3515
01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:27.890
<v Speaker 2>ever for women in MMA.</v>

3516
01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:32.340
<v Speaker 2>MMA you wanna you want to Emj check I signed,</v>

3517
01:35:32.690 --> 01:35:33.650
<v Speaker 2>I would say Holly,</v>

3518
01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:36.370
<v Speaker 2>Holly and Holly.</v>

3519
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Holly and you want to say that to say she would like anybody out for k o power</v>

3520
01:35:42.110 --> 01:35:43.400
<v Speaker 2>but to say that Hollywood line up,</v>

3521
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:44.660
<v Speaker 2>anybody's not disrespectful.</v>

3522
01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:45.500
<v Speaker 2>It's a compliment to Holly.</v>

3523
01:35:45.501 --> 01:35:48.080
<v Speaker 2>It's not a dis this till we were saying she's going to light her up.</v>

3524
01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:48.973
<v Speaker 2>I believe that.</v>

3525
01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:52.460
<v Speaker 2>And that's not being disrespectful or Meesha might take her to the ground to be</v>

3526
01:35:52.461 --> 01:35:55.070
<v Speaker 2>able to dominate her from there cause I've taking her down her take down the</v>

3527
01:35:55.071 --> 01:35:55.400
<v Speaker 2>fences.</v>

3528
01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:56.040
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

3529
01:35:56.040 --> 01:35:56.873
<v Speaker 2>She's never been to,</v>

3530
01:35:57.580 --> 01:35:59.450
<v Speaker 2>she might not be able to get taken down.</v>

3531
01:35:59.451 --> 01:36:00.500
<v Speaker 2>She's never been down before.</v>

3532
01:36:00.501 --> 01:36:01.400
<v Speaker 2>She can,</v>

3533
01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:01.870
<v Speaker 2>if she,</v>

3534
01:36:01.870 --> 01:36:03.410
<v Speaker 2>if we should think DFA,</v>

3535
01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:05.660
<v Speaker 2>I think Misha is going to,</v>

3536
01:36:05.661 --> 01:36:06.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3537
01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:07.460
<v Speaker 2>if she can take her down,</v>

3538
01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:09.280
<v Speaker 2>she's going to be all over on the ground.</v>

3539
01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:13.100
<v Speaker 2>We don't know cause it's really a mystery.</v>

3540
01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Like we haven't seen Holly on the ground except for those brief moments with</v>

3541
01:36:16.641 --> 01:36:16.971
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda.</v>

3542
01:36:16.971 --> 01:36:20.210
<v Speaker 2>What she got out of Ron is armbar attempt and where she took Rhonda down.</v>

3543
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:21.303
<v Speaker 2>All we know,</v>

3544
01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:25.160
<v Speaker 2>it's all I know as far as you might have some inside information from gyms for</v>

3545
01:36:25.161 --> 01:36:26.060
<v Speaker 2>people who trained with her.</v>

3546
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:27.410
<v Speaker 2>I'd always seen,</v>

3547
01:36:27.650 --> 01:36:28.311
<v Speaker 2>I know this,</v>

3548
01:36:28.311 --> 01:36:31.970
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a tougher matchup stylistic wise for Holly then Rhonda.</v>

3549
01:36:32.050 --> 01:36:32.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3550
01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:33.033
<v Speaker 2>what do you know?</v>

3551

3554
01:36:35.570 --> 01:36:38.150
<v Speaker 2>she's not obsessed with Jujitsu.</v>

3555
01:36:38.210 --> 01:36:40.700
<v Speaker 2>She's one of those and there's a lot of MMA fighters like that.</v>

3556
01:36:40.701 --> 01:36:41.420
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't go,</v>

3557
01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:44.180
<v Speaker 2>I could just rattle names off left and right.</v>

3558
01:36:44.181 --> 01:36:45.110
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of guys,</v>

3559
01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:47.730
<v Speaker 2>they just want to stand and bang and work.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'll work to get up.</v>

3562
01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:51.200
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to fucking learn Jiu Jitsu.</v>

3563
01:36:51.201 --> 01:36:52.011
<v Speaker 2>There's so many.</v>

3564
01:36:52.011 --> 01:36:53.000
<v Speaker 2>They're still around.</v>

3565
01:36:53.001 --> 01:36:54.770
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want to work on their back.</v>

3566
01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:56.750
<v Speaker 2>They just want to beat the shit out of people,</v>

3567
01:36:56.900 --> 01:37:01.010
<v Speaker 2>take them fucking down and get on top or not even fucking take them down to stay</v>

3568

<v Speaker 2>in bang and,</v>

3569
01:37:02.331 --> 01:37:03.770
<v Speaker 2>and work on their takedown defense.</v>

3570
01:37:03.771 --> 01:37:04.610
<v Speaker 2>If they get taken down,</v>

3571
01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:05.930
<v Speaker 2>work on getting back up.</v>

3572
01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:06.831
<v Speaker 2>That's sad.</v>

3573
01:37:06.831 --> 01:37:07.520
<v Speaker 2>That tree.</v>

3574
01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:08.690
<v Speaker 2>That's barbarian.</v>

3575
01:37:09.190 --> 01:37:10.023
<v Speaker 2>That's Holly.</v>

3576
01:37:12.130 --> 01:37:12.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3577
01:37:12.290 --> 01:37:13.430
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of guys like that.</v>

3578
01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:14.960
<v Speaker 2>And I hear Holly is one of those guys.</v>

3579
01:37:14.961 --> 01:37:17.330
<v Speaker 2>She just wants to stay in the girl girls.</v>

3580
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:19.100
<v Speaker 2>She's one of those fighters.</v>

3581
01:37:21.330 --> 01:37:22.160
<v Speaker 2>And what,</v>

3582
01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:22.971
<v Speaker 2>what those,</v>

3583
01:37:22.971 --> 01:37:23.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3584
01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:28.420
<v Speaker 2>fighters all have in common that they're generally not known to have a dangerous</v>

3585
01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:32.990
<v Speaker 2>weapons off their back and they usually,</v>

3586
01:37:33.050 --> 01:37:36.020
<v Speaker 2>she gives a fuck up and kitchen kicks bitches in the face,</v>

3587
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:39.830
<v Speaker 2>especially in women's divisions</v>

3588
01:37:41.650 --> 01:37:42.483
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

3589
01:37:42.630 --> 01:37:43.520
<v Speaker 2>does she have to worry about,</v>

3590
01:37:43.521 --> 01:37:44.354
<v Speaker 2>and the women's division,</v>

3591
01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:50.120
<v Speaker 2>she works on takedown defense a lot and she works on getting back up a lot.</v>

3592
01:37:50.121 --> 01:37:50.954
<v Speaker 2>That's what I hear.</v>

3593
01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:51.820
<v Speaker 2>And that then kicking,</v>

3594
01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 2>you can get it through their lesson to be learned that MMA math</v>

3595
01:37:56.130 --> 01:37:58.770
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really work and it styles really match up.</v>

3596
01:37:58.771 --> 01:37:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Weird sometimes.</v>

3597
01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:02.110
<v Speaker 1>And this might be a case like the Misha Tate [inaudible],</v>

3598
01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Holly Holm fight,</v>

3599
01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:04.620
<v Speaker 1>I think a very tough fight.</v>

3600
01:38:05.330 --> 01:38:06.163
<v Speaker 1>She's sneaky,</v>

3601
01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:07.550
<v Speaker 1>she's sneaky and she's tired.</v>

3602
01:38:07.710 --> 01:38:08.910
<v Speaker 1>She does a lot of good.</v>

3603
01:38:09.090 --> 01:38:10.530
<v Speaker 1>She's got a lot of good skills.</v>

3604
01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:11.221
<v Speaker 1>He's got good skills.</v>

3605
01:38:11.221 --> 01:38:13.980
<v Speaker 1>She's handwriting or two fights with their fucking hands up high.</v>

3606
01:38:13.981 --> 01:38:16.710
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't rush in and take crazy chances and she can pop.</v>

3607
01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:18.120
<v Speaker 1>She dropped Jessica.</v>

3608
01:38:18.121 --> 01:38:20.410
<v Speaker 1>I was super game as fuck.</v>

3609
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:21.390
<v Speaker 1>She ain't she,</v>

3610
01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:23.850
<v Speaker 1>she's crying and she's great in the transition.</v>

3611
01:38:24.130 --> 01:38:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Really good trend and like,</v>

3612
01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:26.250
<v Speaker 1>like Holly,</v>

3613
01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:29.230
<v Speaker 1>she's lost and been beaten up before she got beat up by cats and gone,</v>

3614
01:38:29.231 --> 01:38:30.330
<v Speaker 1>oh she's been to the mountain.</v>

3615
01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Just came back strong hundred percent that coming back stronger.</v>

3616
01:38:32.911 --> 01:38:35.190
<v Speaker 1>It's big cause she came back and beat Jessica,</v>

3617
01:38:35.191 --> 01:38:36.300
<v Speaker 1>I and Sarah McMahon.</v>

3618
01:38:36.301 --> 01:38:39.510
<v Speaker 1>I thought like showing more determination show like more grit.</v>

3619
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Like she was her back was against the wall after losing that fight to cat and</v>

3620
01:38:43.171 --> 01:38:44.150
<v Speaker 1>she came back stronger.</v>

3621
01:38:44.190 --> 01:38:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what I've seen from what I've seen with my eye,</v>

3622
01:38:46.410 --> 01:38:47.243
<v Speaker 1>whether I'm right or not,</v>

3623
01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:48.930
<v Speaker 1>it just looks like Holly.</v>

3624
01:38:48.990 --> 01:38:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Holly not only is a higher level striker,</v>

3625
01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:52.800
<v Speaker 1>I think Holly,</v>

3626
01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:53.791
<v Speaker 1>just from what I've seen,</v>

3627
01:38:53.791 --> 01:38:55.520
<v Speaker 1>has much more snap and speed.</v>

3628
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:56.320
<v Speaker 1>No question.</v>

3629
01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:56.740
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

3630
01:38:56.740 --> 01:38:57.990
<v Speaker 1>it just so many fast.</v>

3631
01:38:57.991 --> 01:38:58.990
<v Speaker 1>She's a 19 he shows,</v>

3632
01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:02.690
<v Speaker 1>he shows record is way better than,</v>

3633
01:39:02.710 --> 01:39:03.543
<v Speaker 1>but Maven,</v>

3634
01:39:03.610 --> 01:39:04.111
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>

3635
01:39:04.111 --> 01:39:04.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3636
01:39:04.321 --> 01:39:07.040
<v Speaker 1>But then mainly a striker and not an MMA person.</v>

3637
01:39:07.050 --> 01:39:07.251
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3638
01:39:07.251 --> 01:39:09.690
<v Speaker 1>He sang her boxing is unquestionably better.</v>

3639
01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:10.381
<v Speaker 1>Unquestionably.</v>

3640
01:39:10.381 --> 01:39:14.430
<v Speaker 1>She's arguably going kicked best striking credentials ever in the history of the</v>

3641
01:39:14.431 --> 01:39:15.241
<v Speaker 1>women's division.</v>

3642
01:39:15.241 --> 01:39:15.451
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

3643
01:39:15.451 --> 01:39:16.380
<v Speaker 1>And kicking time,</v>

3644
01:39:16.381 --> 01:39:17.340
<v Speaker 1>world boxing champion.</v>

3645
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:19.290
<v Speaker 1>The only one who comes close as you want her,</v>

3646
01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.840
<v Speaker 1>cause she's six time world more touch him.</v>

3647
01:39:20.890 --> 01:39:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3648
01:39:21.150 --> 01:39:22.410
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to actual champions.</v>

3649
01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:25.620
<v Speaker 1>But Meesha can grapple,</v>

3650
01:39:25.621 --> 01:39:26.580
<v Speaker 1>she can clinch,</v>

3651
01:39:26.581 --> 01:39:29.700
<v Speaker 1>she can avoid striking and she doesn't necessarily have to kickbox with her.</v>

3652
01:39:29.730 --> 01:39:31.470
<v Speaker 1>So it becomes a very different proposition.</v>

3653
01:39:31.590 --> 01:39:32.840
<v Speaker 1>So if they went kickboxing,</v>

3654
01:39:32.850 --> 01:39:33.660
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing,</v>

3655
01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:34.051
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

3656
01:39:34.051 --> 01:39:36.090
<v Speaker 1>If they had an MMA kickboxing match,</v>

3657
01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:37.170
<v Speaker 1>which is where they essentially,</v>

3658
01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:41.400
<v Speaker 1>the Rhonda fight was except for two brief moments if they went kickboxing.</v>

3659
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3660
01:39:41.641 --> 01:39:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Holly's gonna fuck her up,</v>

3661
01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:45.570
<v Speaker 1>but in MMA me Shit's fucking smart.</v>

3662
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:46.170
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

3663
01:39:46.170 --> 01:39:47.100
<v Speaker 1>she's sneaky.</v>

3664
01:39:47.190 --> 01:39:50.730
<v Speaker 1>She knows a lot of shit and she's been there before and she's tough and she</v>

3665
01:39:50.731 --> 01:39:51.570
<v Speaker 1>knows she's tough.</v>

3666
01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:55.590
<v Speaker 1>She knows she can grind it out in a grueling brawl.</v>

3667
01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3668
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:59.100
<v Speaker 1>And she has a real shot.</v>

3669
01:39:59.350 --> 01:40:00.390
<v Speaker 1>She's got a real shot.</v>

3670
01:40:00.391 --> 01:40:00.571
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

3671
01:40:00.571 --> 01:40:01.110
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3672
01:40:01.110 --> 01:40:02.010
<v Speaker 1>I think Misha,</v>

3673
01:40:02.140 --> 01:40:04.170
<v Speaker 1>she's never going to beat Rhonda,</v>

3674
01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:06.270
<v Speaker 1>but Meesha can be Holly to be champion.</v>

3675
01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:07.740
<v Speaker 1>I just think stylistic wise,</v>

3676
01:40:07.741 --> 01:40:08.710
<v Speaker 1>it's a much better match.</v>

3677
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:10.980
<v Speaker 1>The Holly Holly's lateral movement,</v>

3678
01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:12.550
<v Speaker 1>we won't know a lot,</v>

3679
01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:14.070
<v Speaker 1>but I know in mixed martial arts,</v>

3680
01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:17.640
<v Speaker 1>I think stylistic was Misha has a way better chance beating Holly and then she</v>

3681
01:40:17.641 --> 01:40:18.110
<v Speaker 1>does Ron.</v>

3682
01:40:18.110 --> 01:40:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3683
01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:22.890
<v Speaker 1>Also there's a big difference between someone who is fighting off the back leg</v>

3684
01:40:22.891 --> 01:40:24.000
<v Speaker 1>as a counter person,</v>

3685
01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:27.750
<v Speaker 1>which Holly is just ridiculously good at her counters.</v>

3686
01:40:27.751 --> 01:40:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Her timing was fucking spectacular,</v>

3687
01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:32.580
<v Speaker 1>but Rhonda was presenting a predictable target.</v>

3688
01:40:32.730 --> 01:40:34.050
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of ride forward.</v>

3689
01:40:34.051 --> 01:40:35.100
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of aggression.</v>

3690
01:40:35.130 --> 01:40:35.211
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3691
01:40:35.211 --> 01:40:35.401
<v Speaker 1>I'll show,</v>

3692
01:40:35.401 --> 01:40:38.310
<v Speaker 1>you know Holly had to do so all hog it had to do was be patient,</v>

3693
01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:42.540
<v Speaker 1>find the right foot work and catch her coming in cause she knew she was coming</v>

3694
01:40:42.541 --> 01:40:42.820
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

3695
01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:45.150
<v Speaker 1>So it was an exercise and moving back in countering,</v>

3696
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:47.910
<v Speaker 1>she knew exactly what she was preparing for me.</v>

3697
01:40:47.911 --> 01:40:48.900
<v Speaker 1>She's not going to do that.</v>

3698
01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:50.310
<v Speaker 1>He'll remember.</v>

3699
01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 1>But if you remember like there was a a fighters like</v>

3700
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:58.150
<v Speaker 2>most notably Patrick Otay that fought Anderson Silva and he didn't lead and when</v>

3701
01:40:58.151 --> 01:40:58.901
<v Speaker 2>he didn't lead,</v>

3702
01:40:58.901 --> 01:41:00.550
<v Speaker 2>Anderson did not look nearly as good.</v>

3703
01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:01.180
<v Speaker 2>Horrible.</v>

3704
01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:04.630
<v Speaker 2>He's a horrible fight because cat [inaudible] has an iron jaw,</v>

3705
01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:07.270
<v Speaker 2>he's got knockout power and he's smart.</v>

3706
01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:08.350
<v Speaker 2>So what does he do?</v>

3707
01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:10.480
<v Speaker 2>He knows that Anderson is a wizard at countering,</v>

3708
01:41:10.630 --> 01:41:12.580
<v Speaker 2>so he's not his predictable,</v>

3709
01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:14.170
<v Speaker 2>usual aggressive.</v>

3710
01:41:14.171 --> 01:41:16.530
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think those two girls on the same level is no,</v>

3711
01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:17.680
<v Speaker 2>they're not on the same level.</v>

3712

<v Speaker 2>Holly is Holly's on a very high level Shaman for women.</v>

3713
01:41:21.191 --> 01:41:25.900

<v Speaker 2>I think Holly is so much stronger.</v>

3719
01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:37.150
<v Speaker 2>I was amazed at how she looked and so much stronger than Rhonda,</v>

3788
01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Dan Henderson has a bunch of fights left and his contract and I think he still</v>

3789
01:43:11.681 --> 01:43:12.580
<v Speaker 2>thinks that he can do it.</v>

3790
01:43:12.730 --> 01:43:13.563
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Where did he kick him?</v>

01:43:55.110 --> 01:43:56.330
<v Speaker 1>His training camp.</v>

01:44:54.770 --> 01:44:57.500
<v Speaker 1>His foot was completely fucked up like his toe.</v>

3856
01:44:57.501 --> 01:44:59.420
<v Speaker 1>The bone was sticking out of his toe.</v>

3857
01:44:59.830 --> 01:45:00.663
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones,</v>

3858
01:45:00.890 --> 01:45:01.401
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones,</v>

3859
01:45:01.401 --> 01:45:02.480
<v Speaker 1>that was after the fight.</v>

3860
01:45:02.481 --> 01:45:04.180
<v Speaker 1>That was after it was over your Riaa.</v>

3861
01:45:04.190 --> 01:45:06.080
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is he went back to his corner,</v>

3862
01:45:06.081 --> 01:45:09.750
<v Speaker 1>like barely could walk and then when the round started that motherfucker</v>

3863
01:45:09.860 --> 01:45:11.210
<v Speaker 1>completely ignored it.</v>

3864
01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:12.710
<v Speaker 1>He was throwing kicks with it.</v>

3865
01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:16.400
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking toe was hanging off and he's throwing wheel kicks with it.</v>

3866
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.941
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3867
01:45:16.941 --> 01:45:18.950
<v Speaker 1>There's this total like you see how fucked up it is.</v>

3868
01:45:19.250 --> 01:45:22.650
<v Speaker 1>It was broken off to the right and the bone was coming out.</v>

3869
01:45:22.670 --> 01:45:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Like I could see the worst air shows.</v>

3870
01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:27.260
<v Speaker 1>Uriah hall is a bad motherfucker.</v>

3871
01:45:27.410 --> 01:45:28.940
<v Speaker 1>He is a bad motherfucker.</v>

3872
01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:30.163
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't fun awhile,</v>

3873
01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:30.890
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

3874
01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Well he lost a gay guard member.</v>

3875
01:45:33.930 --> 01:45:34.551
<v Speaker 1>Beat gay guard.</v>

3876
01:45:34.551 --> 01:45:35.410
<v Speaker 1>Then he lost two.</v>

3877
01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:36.753
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry dude.</v>

3878
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:37.623
<v Speaker 1>We lost her</v>

3879
01:45:39.190 --> 01:45:39.681
<v Speaker 1>being very,</v>

3880
01:45:39.681 --> 01:45:40.520
<v Speaker 1>very careful here.</v>

3881
01:45:40.521 --> 01:45:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

3882
01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:43.190
<v Speaker 1>The fight we gay guard was spectacular victory for him.</v>

3883
01:45:43.191 --> 01:45:45.720
<v Speaker 1>1:00 AM I getting gate guard still ranked higher than them.</v>

3884
01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:46.581
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

3885
01:45:46.581 --> 01:45:47.414
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

3886
01:45:48.450 --> 01:45:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Fells ladies.</v>

3887
01:45:49.130 --> 01:45:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3888
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.820
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3889
01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3890
01:45:50.270 --> 01:45:50.741
<v Speaker 1>Tail slate.</v>

3891
01:45:50.741 --> 01:45:51.574
<v Speaker 1>This and I haven't seen,</v>

3892
01:45:51.740 --> 01:45:55.250
<v Speaker 1>and this is another one who fought very smart against Anderson Silva.</v>

3893
01:45:55.490 --> 01:45:59.860
<v Speaker 1>He's another one that went five rounds where they're swinging,</v>

3894
01:45:59.861 --> 01:46:00.291
<v Speaker 1>so I'm like,</v>

3895
01:46:00.291 --> 01:46:01.124
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3896
01:46:01.220 --> 01:46:01.971
<v Speaker 1>you had him.</v>

3897
01:46:01.971 --> 01:46:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3898
01:46:02.690 --> 01:46:04.790
<v Speaker 1>You had him look at that look.</v>

3899
01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:05.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

3900
01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:08.450
<v Speaker 1>It looks like he can throw some elbows from the guard and open.</v>

3901
01:46:08.460 --> 01:46:08.730
<v Speaker 1>Same.</v>

3902
01:46:08.730 --> 01:46:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Who's on top right now with a phage?</v>

3903
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:11.623
<v Speaker 1>His guard.</v>

3904
01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:14.180
<v Speaker 1>He's got good left elbow with the card.</v>

3905
01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:18.350
<v Speaker 1>One thing about a guy like phaseout though is it Fazio was a really good striker</v>

3906
01:46:18.530 --> 01:46:21.620
<v Speaker 1>and really good strikers are hard to ground and pound cause they don't panic.</v>

3907
01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:22.400
<v Speaker 1>They don't lock up,</v>

3908
01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:23.150
<v Speaker 1>relax.</v>

3909
01:46:23.150 --> 01:46:24.110
<v Speaker 1>They get used to getting hit.</v>

3910
01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:26.900
<v Speaker 1>They know how to roll with things and they know what's coming.</v>

3911
01:46:27.110 --> 01:46:31.460
<v Speaker 1>You know like their Iq as far as like striking like where the right hand's</v>

3912
01:46:31.461 --> 01:46:31.760
<v Speaker 1>common,</v>

3913
01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:32.740
<v Speaker 1>where the left hand is coming,</v>

3914
01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:35.210
<v Speaker 1>what position you're in to put like real torque behind something.</v>

3915
01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:37.360
<v Speaker 1>You rarely catch some clean like look out,</v>

3916
01:46:37.490 --> 01:46:40.710
<v Speaker 1>see how clever he's moving when he's off his shit.</v>

3917
01:46:42.130 --> 01:46:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Fight Anderson back in the day on and off.</v>

3918
01:46:44.290 --> 01:46:47.540
<v Speaker 1>No he fought king mo and knocked him out and strike force to win the title.</v>

3919
01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:48.590
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

3920
01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah but you know phase</v>

3921
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:50.530
<v Speaker 2>Xiao.</v>

3922
01:46:50.530 --> 01:46:51.490
<v Speaker 2>Is that a tough stint?</v>

3923
01:46:51.660 --> 01:46:52.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3924
01:46:52.020 --> 01:46:53.220
<v Speaker 2>he's had some ups and downs.</v>

3925
01:46:53.221 --> 01:46:54.054
<v Speaker 2>He might've took,</v>

3926
01:46:54.210 --> 01:46:56.610
<v Speaker 2>he might've gotten the UFC like a little later in his career.</v>

3927
01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:56.851
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3928
01:46:56.851 --> 01:46:59.520
<v Speaker 2>it'd be a little late for like him at his best effort.</v>

3929
01:47:02.190 --> 01:47:04.140
<v Speaker 2>Should they be massaging has near right now.</v>

3930
01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:05.573
<v Speaker 2>Do something.</v>

3931
01:47:06.450 --> 01:47:06.811
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3932
01:47:06.811 --> 01:47:07.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's wrong with it.</v>

3933
01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:09.173
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3934
01:47:09.410 --> 01:47:10.200
<v Speaker 2>it's Ashley,</v>

3935
01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:11.520
<v Speaker 2>could it have been a charley horse?</v>

3936
01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:13.410
<v Speaker 2>We know that Sasha is,</v>

3937
01:47:13.411 --> 01:47:14.190
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

3938
01:47:14.190 --> 01:47:14.760
<v Speaker 2>I push.</v>

3939
01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:16.590
<v Speaker 2>It depended upon he's putting a skin patch.</v>

3940
01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:17.673
<v Speaker 2>Might hurt his foot.</v>

3941
01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:18.690
<v Speaker 2>I feel like this a bad idea.</v>

3942
01:47:18.700 --> 01:47:19.950
<v Speaker 2>Put ice before you go out there.</v>

3943
01:47:20.190 --> 01:47:20.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3944
01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:22.170
<v Speaker 2>Might be praying the inflammation down.</v>

3945
01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:25.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3946
01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:27.310
<v Speaker 2>he might've broke his foot when he threw that leg kicks.</v>

3947
01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:28.153
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

3948
01:47:28.850 --> 01:47:29.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3949
01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:31.600
<v Speaker 2>he might've blew his knee out or blue.</v>

3950
01:47:31.601 --> 01:47:32.670
<v Speaker 2>His foot out or something.</v>

3951
01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:34.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3952
01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:34.890
<v Speaker 2>Damn man,</v>

3953
01:47:35.130 --> 01:47:35.701
<v Speaker 2>that's too bad.</v>

3954
01:47:35.701 --> 01:47:35.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3955
01:47:35.921 --> 01:47:36.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3956
01:47:36.121 --> 01:47:37.200
<v Speaker 2>He's having a hard time on it.</v>

3957
01:47:37.201 --> 01:47:38.430
<v Speaker 2>See how it's kind of wobbly.</v>

3958
01:47:39.570 --> 01:47:40.403
<v Speaker 2>Kind of get that win.</v>

3959
01:47:41.250 --> 01:47:42.180
<v Speaker 2>But it's just interesting.</v>

3960
01:47:42.210 --> 01:47:42.481
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3961
01:47:42.481 --> 01:47:44.430
<v Speaker 2>like little variations in someone's gait.</v>

3962
01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:45.533
<v Speaker 2>You could see it.</v>

3963
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:47.521
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3966
01:47:52.531 --> 01:47:57.531
<v Speaker 2>with guys working on this crazy footwork like the Duane Ludwig like camp with</v>

3998
01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:47.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3999
01:48:47.670 --> 01:48:50.360
<v Speaker 2>It would've been nice if he had to like a more like ready</v>

4000
01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:53.490
<v Speaker 2>as zero.</v>

4001
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:54.810
<v Speaker 2>And I think he knows a lot.</v>

4002
01:48:54.811 --> 01:48:55.644
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

4003
01:48:58.960 --> 01:48:59.793
<v Speaker 2>real about it.</v>

4004
01:48:59.820 --> 01:49:04.290
<v Speaker 2>I think he knows a lot about proprioception and some of the things he was</v>

4005
01:49:04.291 --> 01:49:04.771
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>

4006
01:49:04.771 --> 01:49:06.350
<v Speaker 2>about balance and coordination.</v>

4007
01:49:06.610 --> 01:49:07.860
<v Speaker 2>Look like in Carlos fight.</v>

4008
01:49:08.370 --> 01:49:08.990
<v Speaker 2>Listen man,</v>

4009
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.670
<v Speaker 2>he's always wanting to,</v>

4010
01:49:09.670 --> 01:49:10.800
<v Speaker 2>you won that fight anyways,</v>

4011
01:49:10.890 --> 01:49:11.790
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think he moved to,</v>

4012
01:49:11.791 --> 01:49:14.820
<v Speaker 2>well I think he's only been working with them for a short amount of time and you</v>

4013
01:49:14.821 --> 01:49:18.660
<v Speaker 2>know as much as I do that new things you're going to incorporate into like high</v>

4014
01:49:18.661 --> 01:49:19.510
<v Speaker 2>level cage fighting.</v>

4015
01:49:19.511 --> 01:49:21.280
<v Speaker 2>It takes a long time to really apply.</v>

4016
01:49:21.281 --> 01:49:22.530
<v Speaker 2>That's not climb on logs.</v>

4017

<v Speaker 2>They all looked like Jesus.</v>

4022

4062
01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:35.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about your prejudice against Yoga.</v>

4063
01:50:35.891 --> 01:50:36.910
<v Speaker 4>Before you ever did yoga,</v>

4064
01:50:36.911 --> 01:50:37.630
<v Speaker 4>what was it?</v>

4065
01:50:37.630 --> 01:50:38.290
<v Speaker 4>I didn't happen.</v>

4066
01:50:38.290 --> 01:50:38.650
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm open minded bull shit.</v>

4071
01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:49.573
<v Speaker 4>You didn't</v>

4072
01:50:52.150 --> 01:50:52.983
<v Speaker 4>think</v>

4073
01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:56.193
<v Speaker 4>it</v>

4074
01:50:57.780 --> 01:50:59.950
<v Speaker 4>turned out to be way easier,</v>

4075
01:50:59.951 --> 01:51:00.784
<v Speaker 4>way harder.</v>

4076
01:51:01.850 --> 01:51:02.683
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4077
01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:04.270
<v Speaker 4>you didn't think your perception of it was there.</v>

4078
01:51:04.271 --> 01:51:05.590
<v Speaker 4>It was way easier than it actually was.</v>

4079
01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:06.560
<v Speaker 4>Hey baby is way harder.</v>

4080
01:51:06.730 --> 01:51:07.091
<v Speaker 4>Harder,</v>

4081
01:51:07.091 --> 01:51:08.350
<v Speaker 4>but in the middle of training camp,</v>

4082
01:51:08.351 --> 01:51:08.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4083
01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:11.590
<v Speaker 4>thank God for Mrs. Downs in this yoga.</v>

4084
01:51:11.591 --> 01:51:12.670

4085
01:51:12.671 --> 01:51:13.240
<v Speaker 4>Is good,</v>

4086
01:51:13.240 --> 01:51:14.710
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of movement in training,</v>

4087
01:51:14.711 --> 01:51:14.981
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4088

4090
01:51:23.411 --> 01:51:23.770
<v Speaker 4>movements.</v>

4091
01:51:23.770 --> 01:51:24.300
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4092
01:51:24.300 --> 01:51:24.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4093
01:51:24.490 --> 01:51:25.750
<v Speaker 4>There's definitely a lot of movement,</v>

4094
01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:30.280
<v Speaker 4>a lot of payrolls and you to see a degree and he sees some sort of scientific,</v>

4095
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:32.980
<v Speaker 4>hold on a second there because there's people that don't get degrees.</v>

4096
01:51:32.981 --> 01:51:33.880
<v Speaker 4>Like how about,</v>

4097
01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:38.770
<v Speaker 4>how about the a a natural that Hixon Gracie tributes to a lot of its flexibility</v>

4098
01:51:38.771 --> 01:51:41.530
<v Speaker 4>and movement like before these movement coaches.</v>

4099
01:51:41.531 --> 01:51:41.711
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4100
01:51:41.711 --> 01:51:43.060
<v Speaker 4>This is what people that need to understand.</v>

4101
01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:47.560
<v Speaker 4>Back in the fucking early nineties Hickson was like a guy.</v>

4102
01:51:47.561 --> 01:51:48.071
<v Speaker 4>You didn't want it.</v>

4103
01:51:48.071 --> 01:51:49.030
<v Speaker 4>He was like candy man.</v>

4104
01:51:49.070 --> 01:51:49.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4105
01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:50.800
<v Speaker 4>He didn't want to say his name three times.</v>

4106
01:51:53.970 --> 01:51:54.750
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

4107
01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:55.210
<v Speaker 4>He did.</v>

4108
01:51:55.210 --> 01:51:56.190
<v Speaker 4>He was the motherfucker.</v>

4109
01:51:56.250 --> 01:51:57.910
<v Speaker 4>Motherfuckers is heartbeat down,</v>

4110
01:51:57.911 --> 01:51:58.511
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff.</v>

4111
01:51:58.511 --> 01:51:59.470
<v Speaker 4>He was a Yogi.</v>

4112
01:51:59.471 --> 01:52:01.890
<v Speaker 4>He's a legit Yogi and gymnastic natural.</v>

4113
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.770
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

4114
01:52:03.770 --> 01:52:04.540
<v Speaker 4>It was both.</v>

4115
01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:05.020
<v Speaker 4>He come,</v>

4116
01:52:05.020 --> 01:52:05.853
<v Speaker 4>he applied,</v>

4117
01:52:06.610 --> 01:52:08.690
<v Speaker 4>he applied fire broth.</v>

4118
01:52:10.510 --> 01:52:15.510
<v Speaker 4>That's why he's alleging also then he did 40 years of Jujitsu</v>

4119
01:52:17.490 --> 01:52:20.170
<v Speaker 4>it out from all the graces he stood out.</v>

4120
01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:21.033
<v Speaker 4>Hixon Gracie.</v>

4121
01:52:21.070 --> 01:52:22.630
<v Speaker 4>All of them would cause he did the movie.</v>

4122
01:52:23.650 --> 01:52:25.510
<v Speaker 4>This is backwards.</v>

4123
01:52:26.090 --> 01:52:26.923
<v Speaker 4>That's</v>

4124
01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:29.020
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

4125
01:52:29.020 --> 01:52:31.420
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's the maybe had something to do with that.</v>

4126
01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:31.661
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4127
01:52:31.661 --> 01:52:33.640
<v Speaker 4>but here what you're saying here too.</v>

4128
01:52:33.670 --> 01:52:34.420
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4129
01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:34.841
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

4130
01:52:34.841 --> 01:52:36.370
<v Speaker 4>they're not mutually exclusive.</v>

4131
01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:40.480
<v Speaker 4>Exclusive Hex and the reason why he was the greatest ever it was because he was</v>

4132
01:52:40.481 --> 01:52:41.380
<v Speaker 4>the perfect storm.</v>

4133
01:52:41.530 --> 01:52:42.940
<v Speaker 4>He was the guy who was super smart.</v>

4134
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:44.110
<v Speaker 4>He was super tough.</v>

4135
01:52:44.111 --> 01:52:44.680
<v Speaker 4>He was a war.</v>

4136
01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:49.680
<v Speaker 4>He had a warrior mentality and he was intelligent enough to apply a bunch of</v>

4137
01:52:50.151 --> 01:52:53.780
<v Speaker 4>really unconventional training modalities like some serious yoga,</v>

4138
01:52:53.930 --> 01:52:56.690
<v Speaker 4>that fucking video of him on the bars and Santa Monica,</v>

4139
01:52:56.691 --> 01:52:58.520
<v Speaker 4>but before he fought in Japan Valley Tudos,</v>

4140
01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:00.260
<v Speaker 4>he's doing balance beam shit.</v>

4141
01:53:00.380 --> 01:53:04.190
<v Speaker 4>Go into a full split standing there on his fucking bar on the beach.</v>

4142
01:53:04.490 --> 01:53:05.500
<v Speaker 4>He's doing all these real,</v>

4143
01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:06.531
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

4144
01:53:06.531 --> 01:53:08.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying the movement doesn't work.</v>

4145
01:53:08.450 --> 01:53:09.110
<v Speaker 4>It was both.</v>

4146
01:53:09.110 --> 01:53:10.580
<v Speaker 4>It was I.</v>

4147
01:53:10.580 --> 01:53:14.380
<v Speaker 4>Hell you say it doesn't help that he's been doing anyway.</v>

4148
01:53:14.970 --> 01:53:15.950
<v Speaker 4>Positive Jim.</v>

4149
01:53:16.010 --> 01:53:21.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying it was an MMA fighter in the UFC on my list of priorities to become a</v>

4150
01:53:22.011 --> 01:53:23.060
<v Speaker 4>UFC champion.</v>

4151
01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:27.050
<v Speaker 4>Hiring a movement coach who his background is climbing on rocks and climbing</v>

4152
01:53:27.051 --> 01:53:27.884
<v Speaker 4>trees.</v>

4153
01:53:28.170 --> 01:53:29.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to fuck it.</v>

4154
01:53:30.730 --> 01:53:33.150
<v Speaker 4>I can't say it about this foretell guy he had.</v>

4155
01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:34.033
<v Speaker 4>Now he's a god.</v>

4156
01:53:34.230 --> 01:53:35.780
<v Speaker 4>That diary don't diss him cause I'll come out.</v>

4157
01:53:36.020 --> 01:53:39.180
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you ain't gotta give you say only know side kick the fuck out.</v>

4158
01:53:39.190 --> 01:53:41.300
<v Speaker 4>Don't know what his total or one the core can do.</v>

4159
01:53:41.301 --> 01:53:45.750
<v Speaker 4>But I know he has the respect of Carlos condit so he's got my respect and I</v>

4160
01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:47.630
<v Speaker 4>enjoy talking to them and I think he knows a lot.</v>

4161
01:53:47.630 --> 01:53:48.980
<v Speaker 4>So I disagree with you on that.</v>

4162
01:53:49.250 --> 01:53:53.380
<v Speaker 4>But I don't know if he can do what that Edo Portel God can do.</v>

4163
01:53:53.480 --> 01:53:55.820
<v Speaker 4>But we're talking about mindset moves like,</v>

4164
01:53:57.440 --> 01:53:57.621
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4165
01:53:57.621 --> 01:53:57.921
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

4166
01:53:57.921 --> 01:53:59.240
<v Speaker 4>It seems like it's not real Joe.</v>

4167
01:53:59.241 --> 01:54:02.270
<v Speaker 4>All I'm saying is if you're going to dedicate your time to something,</v>

4168
01:54:02.570 --> 01:54:04.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's the way to go.</v>

4169
01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:04.880
<v Speaker 4>Here's why.</v>

4170
01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:07.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure you're right guys like Richard Martinez,</v>

4171
01:54:07.731 --> 01:54:09.860
<v Speaker 4>we brought this up before you.</v>

4172
01:54:09.861 --> 01:54:14.540
<v Speaker 4>He a a fantastic breakdancer and the ability to manipulate his body,</v>

4173
01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:16.010
<v Speaker 4>standing on one hand,</v>

4174
01:54:16.011 --> 01:54:17.420
<v Speaker 4>doing the fucking full lotus,</v>

4175
01:54:17.421 --> 01:54:22.040
<v Speaker 4>all the crazy shit that he could do directly translated to him almost</v>

4176
01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:25.610
<v Speaker 4>immediately being a bad mother fucker in Jujitsu directly.</v>

4177
01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:27.170
<v Speaker 4>Ridiculously.</v>

4178
01:54:27.270 --> 01:54:27.740
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4179
01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:28.940
<v Speaker 4>and not just athletic,</v>

4180
01:54:28.941 --> 01:54:32.690
<v Speaker 4>but the dexterity of one language informs the other</v>

4181
01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:34.521
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4182
01:54:34.521 --> 01:54:35.354
<v Speaker 4>You're wrong.</v>

4183
01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:37.230
<v Speaker 4>Jansen's movement wasn't wild,</v>

4184
01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:39.390
<v Speaker 4>but this is movement.</v>

4185
01:54:39.710 --> 01:54:40.940
<v Speaker 4>This is why I'm saying you're wrong.</v>

4186
01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:43.280
<v Speaker 4>It's all good if it works.</v>

4187
01:54:43.281 --> 01:54:44.780
<v Speaker 4>And how sign up for salsa classes.</v>

4188
01:54:45.890 --> 01:54:46.723

4194
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:56.030
<v Speaker 4>But why did it take ballet or something to do</v>

4195

<v Speaker 4>to get this ham hock and he's tied to</v>

4235
01:56:02.210 --> 01:56:05.430
<v Speaker 1>And I remember I took it home with back when people that actually had DVDs.</v>

4236
01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

4238
01:56:07.540 --> 01:56:09.180
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't unconventional cancer.</v>

4239
01:56:09.181 --> 01:56:10.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not called word unconventional.</v>

4240
01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Like in know fuck on Orthodox dancer.</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4244
01:56:14.581 --> 01:56:14.731
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4245
01:56:14.731 --> 01:56:16.040
<v Speaker 1>no inappropriate dances.</v>

4246
01:56:16.050 --> 01:56:18.240
<v Speaker 1>I think it was great.</v>

4247
01:56:18.340 --> 01:56:19.510
<v Speaker 1>It was a sketch that he,</v>

4248
01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:20.580
<v Speaker 1>it was ridiculous.</v>

4249
01:56:20.910 --> 01:56:22.560
<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculous as a guy just like,</v>

4250
01:56:22.561 --> 01:56:24.150
<v Speaker 1>it's okay to dance on a dance floor.</v>

4251
01:56:24.151 --> 01:56:24.841
<v Speaker 1>A great right.</v>

4252
01:56:24.841 --> 01:56:25.340
<v Speaker 1>We all agree.</v>

4253
01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Give me,</v>

4254
01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:28.000
<v Speaker 1>as long as you step into this arena and you're on the heart,</v>

4255
01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:30.330
<v Speaker 1>it's all to get ridiculous,</v>

4256
01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:32.970
<v Speaker 1>but you can't do that shit when you're waiting in line to rent a car.</v>

4257
01:56:34.110 --> 01:56:34.660
<v Speaker 1>Brian said,</v>

4258
01:56:34.660 --> 01:56:35.493
<v Speaker 1>sounds great.</v>

4259
01:56:36.150 --> 01:56:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

4260
01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:37.060
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>

4261
01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

4262
01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:41.170
<v Speaker 1>I just remember there was some inappropriate dancing when I slapped the gambler.</v>

4263
01:56:41.190 --> 01:56:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I slap that Bob thing and I would jump out and that sounds hilarious.</v>

4264
01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:45.810
<v Speaker 1>I did all kinds of weird stuff like that.</v>

4265
01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:48.360
<v Speaker 1>We were doing ballet and then about two days into it,</v>

4266
01:56:48.361 --> 01:56:51.690
<v Speaker 1>so it was like we should probably go catch him flip balls.</v>

4267
01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:52.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4268
01:56:52.111 --> 01:56:52.944
<v Speaker 1>no shit,</v>

4269
01:56:53.580 --> 01:56:54.413
<v Speaker 1>no shit.</v>

4270
01:56:55.130 --> 01:56:57.600
<v Speaker 1>And that's where all this movement dancing stuff.</v>

4271
01:56:59.350 --> 01:57:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you think lunges are essentially in a lot of ways,</v>

4272
01:57:03.151 --> 01:57:06.210
<v Speaker 1>especially dumbbell lunges are very much a movement exercise cause it's all</v>

4273
01:57:06.211 --> 01:57:08.730
<v Speaker 1>about balance and rigidity and keeping your core straight.</v>

4274
01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:09.210
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

4275
01:57:09.210 --> 01:57:11.160
<v Speaker 1>there's something about like double Dumbbell lunges,</v>

4276
01:57:11.310 --> 01:57:13.890
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines that they were you,</v>

4277
01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:17.810
<v Speaker 1>they help you go balls as it was no heavy stuff.</v>

4278
01:57:17.811 --> 01:57:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4279
01:57:18.130 --> 01:57:18.700
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4280
01:57:18.700 --> 01:57:22.320
<v Speaker 1>like if you're going to apply like an explosive movement to a martial art,</v>

4281
01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:24.000
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt about lifting weights.</v>

4282
01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:24.361
<v Speaker 1>Helps.</v>

4283
01:57:24.361 --> 01:57:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4284
01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:25.583
<v Speaker 1>No doubt about it.</v>

4285
01:57:25.710 --> 01:57:26.371
<v Speaker 1>No doubt about it.</v>

4286
01:57:26.371 --> 01:57:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Like lifting weights.</v>

4287
01:57:27.271 --> 01:57:28.620
<v Speaker 1>If there was no weight restrictions,</v>

4288
01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:31.190
<v Speaker 1>you can do whatever you wanted and lift as much weight as you want it.</v>

4289
01:57:31.290 --> 01:57:35.340
<v Speaker 1>There's a big difference from one 70 and 200 you mean there's a big difference.</v>

4290
01:57:35.341 --> 01:57:38.400
<v Speaker 1>You get like way stronger if you get way more explosive,</v>

4291
01:57:38.401 --> 01:57:38.940
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>

4292
01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:41.970
<v Speaker 1>it's beneficial in a applied situation.</v>

4293
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:42.580
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4294
01:57:42.580 --> 01:57:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Agreed.</v>

4295
01:57:43.110 --> 01:57:43.943
<v Speaker 1>That's movement.</v>

4296
01:57:44.150 --> 01:57:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4297
01:57:44.740 --> 01:57:46.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not much different.</v>

4298
01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:50.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're talking about movement with weights or movement with Moitai</v>

4299
01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:50.821
<v Speaker 1>like people.</v>

4300
01:57:50.821 --> 01:57:53.370
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that say training boy ties helped a Jujitsu.</v>

4301
01:57:53.550 --> 01:57:54.360
<v Speaker 1>I believe it.</v>

4302
01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:55.290
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense,</v>

4303
01:57:55.460 --> 01:57:56.730
<v Speaker 1>but just kind of shit.</v>

4304
01:57:56.731 --> 01:57:59.010
<v Speaker 1>You have to do all this motions you have to do in Moy Tai.</v>

4305
01:57:59.130 --> 01:58:00.150
<v Speaker 1>That's movement too.</v>

4306
01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:02.590
<v Speaker 1>I would also say timings with gymnastics.</v>

4307
01:58:06.330 --> 01:58:06.931
<v Speaker 1>What leads,</v>

4308
01:58:06.931 --> 01:58:08.250
<v Speaker 1>what leads one person,</v>

4309
01:58:08.251 --> 01:58:12.840
<v Speaker 1>like what with Hixon would lead him into the other disciplines is that mindset</v>

4310
01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:16.200
<v Speaker 1>that that comprehensive minded mindset constantly get better.</v>

4311
01:58:16.700 --> 01:58:19.320
<v Speaker 1>This foundation is so fucking good insane,</v>

4312
01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:22.740
<v Speaker 1>but also he was a student of the Great Japanese Samurai.</v>

4313
01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4314
01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Their philosophy.</v>

4315
01:58:24.271 --> 01:58:27.960
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sure he read the book of five rings and one of the things about the book</v>

4316
01:58:27.961 --> 01:58:31.500
<v Speaker 1>of five rings in and emphasize was like taking in all sorts of different,</v>

4317
01:58:31.650 --> 01:58:32.461
<v Speaker 1>be soft,</v>

4318
01:58:32.461 --> 01:58:33.840
<v Speaker 1>like taking calligraphy,</v>

4319
01:58:33.841 --> 01:58:37.560
<v Speaker 1>do painting because the flexible and the reason for that,</v>

4320
01:58:37.590 --> 01:58:39.300
<v Speaker 1>if you look at any great innovator,</v>

4321
01:58:39.630 --> 01:58:41.160
<v Speaker 1>they started with one discipline,</v>

4322
01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:42.760
<v Speaker 1>they started with one discipline and then they,</v>

4323
01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:44.650
<v Speaker 1>when they studied other disciplines,</v>

4324
01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:48.500
<v Speaker 1>they were able to appropriate those disciplines and come up with a new style.</v>

4325
01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:51.910
<v Speaker 1>They really will revolutionize a new style by studying that style.</v>

4326
01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:54.430
<v Speaker 1>You branch out a young Hixon might be,</v>

4327
01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:56.800
<v Speaker 1>might be Alan Jobe in a young,</v>

4328
01:58:56.960 --> 01:58:57.390
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

4329
01:58:57.390 --> 01:58:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Hanson is shot.</v>

4330
01:58:58.570 --> 01:58:59.403
<v Speaker 1>Good shot.</v>

4331
01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:02.080
<v Speaker 1>So he's from the long goal essentially.</v>

4332
01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:02.490
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

4333
01:59:02.490 --> 01:59:02.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4334
01:59:02.750 --> 01:59:03.670
<v Speaker 1>from South America</v>

4335
01:59:07.250 --> 01:59:10.810
<v Speaker 1>twist head plus to have a real problem.</v>

4336
01:59:11.380 --> 01:59:13.900
<v Speaker 1>The real problem with that Pussy Hickson was getting,</v>

4337
01:59:14.290 --> 01:59:14.980
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

4338
01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:15.731
<v Speaker 1>please bring him up.</v>

4339
01:59:15.731 --> 01:59:16.564
<v Speaker 1>I like to look at his,</v>

4340
01:59:16.630 --> 01:59:17.970
<v Speaker 1>he's getting supermodels.</v>

4341
01:59:18.350 --> 01:59:18.820
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

4342
01:59:18.820 --> 01:59:19.570
<v Speaker 1>let's look again.</v>

4343
01:59:19.570 --> 01:59:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Let's like,</v>

4344
01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:21.940
<v Speaker 1>let's not bring up specific instance.</v>

4345
01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:26.370
<v Speaker 1>I think your a Jujitsu helps your music and I think your music helps you</v>

4346
01:59:26.371 --> 01:59:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>

4347
01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:28.930
<v Speaker 1>And I think as your Jujitsu has gotten better,</v>

4348
01:59:28.931 --> 01:59:31.000
<v Speaker 1>you music's gotten better and as your music's gotten better,</v>

4349
01:59:31.001 --> 01:59:31.540
<v Speaker 1>your Jujitsu,</v>

4350
01:59:31.540 --> 01:59:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Scott,</v>

4351
01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:33.380
<v Speaker 1>I think it'd be a coach.</v>

4352
01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:34.460
<v Speaker 1>I think they're all too,</v>

4353
01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:36.720
<v Speaker 1>cause you'd be red hot too.</v>

4354
01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:41.860
<v Speaker 1>When you get great at things like especially like you specifically,</v>

4355
01:59:41.861 --> 01:59:45.560
<v Speaker 1>you're a guy who like one of the best things about you creating 10th plaids</v>

4356
01:59:45.570 --> 01:59:46.780
<v Speaker 1>judges ever since I've known you,</v>

4357
01:59:47.020 --> 01:59:49.120
<v Speaker 1>like if you have an idea in your mind,</v>

4358
01:59:49.121 --> 01:59:52.600
<v Speaker 1>like there's a point you have to get to like okay there's a spot over there</v>

4359
01:59:52.601 --> 01:59:53.050
<v Speaker 1>you've got to get.</v>

4360
01:59:53.050 --> 01:59:54.700
<v Speaker 1>So you have this crazy tunnel vision.</v>

4361
01:59:54.850 --> 01:59:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Well you'll figure out unconventional paths to get to a point.</v>

4362
01:59:58.120 --> 01:59:58.611
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

4363
01:59:58.611 --> 02:00:03.460
<v Speaker 1>you can block out a lot of like external shit that a lot of other people don't.</v>

4364
02:00:03.530 --> 02:00:03.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4365
02:00:03.870 --> 02:00:05.500
<v Speaker 1>they can't block out the can't fat.</v>

4366
02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:08.470
<v Speaker 1>They can't like tune in to the finish line the way you can.</v>

4367
02:00:08.710 --> 02:00:11.980
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting to see because I think that applies to your music as</v>

4368
02:00:11.981 --> 02:00:12.370
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

4369
02:00:12.370 --> 02:00:14.290
<v Speaker 1>I think it applies to everything you do.</v>

4370
02:00:14.530 --> 02:00:16.720
<v Speaker 1>And I think it comes for a lot of us.</v>

4371
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:19.810
<v Speaker 1>I think it comes from like some fucked up place where you didn't get enough when</v>

4372
02:00:19.811 --> 02:00:22.320
<v Speaker 1>you were a child and then you detention or what?</v>

4373
02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:22.841
<v Speaker 1>Anything.</v>

4374
02:00:22.841 --> 02:00:23.291
<v Speaker 1>Love,</v>

4375
02:00:23.291 --> 02:00:24.124
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>

4376
02:00:24.840 --> 02:00:25.673
<v Speaker 1>praise,</v>

4377
02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:26.540
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] ship,</v>

4378
02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:27.373
<v Speaker 1>Camaraderie.</v>

4379
02:00:27.730 --> 02:00:28.181
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

4380
02:00:28.181 --> 02:00:30.260
<v Speaker 1>what's really important is like I said this to him the other day,</v>

4381
02:00:30.261 --> 02:00:30.640
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

4382
02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:31.060
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

4383
02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:31.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4384
02:00:31.241 --> 02:00:31.511
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

4385
02:00:31.511 --> 02:00:32.344
<v Speaker 1>don't spar.</v>

4386
02:00:32.410 --> 02:00:35.740
<v Speaker 1>You know why it's parked is it terrifies me now I'm not good as far as you turn</v>

4387
02:00:35.741 --> 02:00:36.860
<v Speaker 1>this in to you and I was talking to,</v>

4388
02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:37.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to explain to him.</v>

4389
02:00:38.130 --> 02:00:38.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4390
02:00:38.300 --> 02:00:38.440
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4391
02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:39.820
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is that you listen,</v>

4392
02:00:39.821 --> 02:00:40.061
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

4393
02:00:40.061 --> 02:00:40.361
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

4394
02:00:40.361 --> 02:00:41.040
<v Speaker 1>son of no,</v>

4395
02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:41.890
<v Speaker 1>this is the point I'm making.</v>

4396
02:00:41.891 --> 02:00:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

4397
02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:45.190
<v Speaker 1>when you do something that you're afraid of or that puts you on,</v>

4398
02:00:45.220 --> 02:00:46.450
<v Speaker 1>makes you uncomfortable.</v>

4399
02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:48.160
<v Speaker 1>I end up writing I think.</v>

4400
02:00:48.161 --> 02:00:51.550
<v Speaker 1>I think like when you do another discipline that maybe you're not even good at,</v>

4401
02:00:51.551 --> 02:00:52.211
<v Speaker 1>that scares you.</v>

4402
02:00:52.211 --> 02:00:56.500
<v Speaker 1>It'll open up channels in your original discipline.</v>

4403
02:00:56.530 --> 02:00:59.830
<v Speaker 1>It will jumble your brain so you come at things in a different way.</v>

4404
02:01:00.010 --> 02:01:02.620
<v Speaker 1>If you stay comfortable in and stuff,</v>

4405
02:01:02.950 --> 02:01:03.280
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

4406
02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:04.111
<v Speaker 1>you're most likely,</v>

4407
02:01:04.111 --> 02:01:05.080
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to create a field,</v>

4408
02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:08.350
<v Speaker 1>it's harder to branch out and become more creative.</v>

4409
02:01:08.351 --> 02:01:11.470
<v Speaker 1>If you do things you're not that good at that maybe you're scared of.</v>

4410
02:01:11.590 --> 02:01:12.241
<v Speaker 1>They churn that.</v>

4411
02:01:12.241 --> 02:01:14.350
<v Speaker 1>That caused you to stretch in other areas,</v>

4412
02:01:14.351 --> 02:01:14.891
<v Speaker 1>and this is the,</v>

4413
02:01:14.891 --> 02:01:16.360
<v Speaker 1>this is the argument for movement coaches.</v>

4414
02:01:16.690 --> 02:01:18.100
<v Speaker 1>When you do things you're not that good.</v>

4415
02:01:18.100 --> 02:01:19.510
<v Speaker 1>I had to put you in an in your,</v>

4416
02:01:19.590 --> 02:01:21.370
<v Speaker 1>in your step out of your comfort zone.</v>

4417
02:01:21.550 --> 02:01:23.290
<v Speaker 1>You'll probably get better at your original,</v>

4418
02:01:23.291 --> 02:01:24.560
<v Speaker 1>better be good at everything else.</v>

4419
02:01:24.570 --> 02:01:25.640
<v Speaker 1>We'll probably hire a movement coach.</v>

4420
02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:26.513
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

4457
02:02:21.151 --> 02:02:22.290
<v Speaker 1>And Susan Silva,</v>

4460
02:02:23.731 --> 02:02:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Shaye Anderson.</v>

4461

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4462
02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:27.840
<v Speaker 1>it's a very good fight at this time and both of their careers,</v>

4463
02:02:27.841 --> 02:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>it becomes interesting,</v>

4464
02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>whereas like Anderson,</v>

4465
02:02:30.181 --> 02:02:31.170
<v Speaker 1>when he was dominating,</v>

4466
02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:31.861
<v Speaker 1>when he was like,</v>

4467
02:02:31.861 --> 02:02:33.380
<v Speaker 1>like right after he smashed jail son in,</v>

4468
02:02:33.390 --> 02:02:34.223
<v Speaker 1>in the second fight,</v>

4469
02:02:34.350 --> 02:02:35.080
<v Speaker 1>you would think like,</v>

4470
02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:35.271
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

4471
02:02:35.271 --> 02:02:35.761
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

4472
02:02:35.761 --> 02:02:37.430
<v Speaker 1>that's a tough fight for Bisping.</v>

4473
02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:39.060
<v Speaker 1>The Andersons just in the matrix.</v>

4474
02:02:39.300 --> 02:02:41.430
<v Speaker 1>But Anderson comes off of,</v>

4475
02:02:41.670 --> 02:02:41.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4476
02:02:41.941 --> 02:02:46.080
<v Speaker 1>like psychologically there's two v brutal losses in a row.</v>

4477
02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:47.430
<v Speaker 1>One a loss for sure.</v>

4478
02:02:47.431 --> 02:02:48.780
<v Speaker 1>What a catastrophic injury.</v>

4479
02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Then he just fell off.</v>

4480
02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:50.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4481
02:02:50.881 --> 02:02:52.110
<v Speaker 1>And then he gets by Nick Diaz,</v>

4482
02:02:52.111 --> 02:02:53.910
<v Speaker 1>but he gets humiliated.</v>

4483
02:02:54.210 --> 02:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Like Nick Diaz lies on his back and puts his hands on his head and mocks him.</v>

4484
02:02:58.170 --> 02:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>He's talking to him.</v>

4485
02:02:59.011 --> 02:03:00.090
<v Speaker 1>He's calling him a bitch.</v>

4486
02:03:00.570 --> 02:03:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

4487
02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz was super respectful right up until the moment they got in that cage.</v>

4488
02:03:05.821 --> 02:03:07.530
<v Speaker 1>And then he was Nick Diaz.</v>

4489
02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4490
02:03:07.970 --> 02:03:08.850
<v Speaker 1>It was all gone.</v>

4491
02:03:08.910 --> 02:03:09.743
<v Speaker 1>He's never fucking,</v>

4492
02:03:09.750 --> 02:03:12.330
<v Speaker 1>it's like that old fable about the Scorpion and the frog.</v>

4493
02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:15.840
<v Speaker 1>The frog wants to get across the pond and the Scorpion says,</v>

4494
02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:18.060
<v Speaker 1>or the Scorpion wants get across the frog,</v>

4495
02:03:18.250 --> 02:03:19.230
<v Speaker 1>the pond and the frog,</v>

4496
02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:19.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4497
02:03:19.540 --> 02:03:21.090
<v Speaker 1>is in the water and his corporate says,</v>

4498
02:03:21.091 --> 02:03:22.050
<v Speaker 1>let me ride on your back.</v>

4499
02:03:22.530 --> 02:03:22.961
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

4500
02:03:22.961 --> 02:03:23.551
<v Speaker 1>the frog says,</v>

4501
02:03:23.551 --> 02:03:25.260
<v Speaker 1>I won't do that if I do that,</v>

4502
02:03:25.261 --> 02:03:26.130
<v Speaker 1>you'll sting me.</v>

4503
02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:26.550
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

4504
02:03:26.550 --> 02:03:26.731
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4505
02:03:26.731 --> 02:03:27.451
<v Speaker 1>if I did that,</v>

4506
02:03:27.451 --> 02:03:28.500
<v Speaker 1>we would both die.</v>

4507
02:03:28.530 --> 02:03:29.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm not stupid.</v>

4508
02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:32.520
<v Speaker 1>So the Scorpion rides on the frog's back and halfway across the water,</v>

4509
02:03:32.670 --> 02:03:35.400
<v Speaker 1>he stings him and the frogs like what the fuck?</v>

4510
02:03:35.700 --> 02:03:36.720
<v Speaker 1>And the Scorpion is like,</v>

4511
02:03:36.721 --> 02:03:37.201
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

4512
02:03:37.201 --> 02:03:38.100
<v Speaker 1>It's in my nature.</v>

4513
02:03:38.250 --> 02:03:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4514
02:03:38.610 --> 02:03:39.031
<v Speaker 1>Damn dog.</v>

4515
02:03:39.031 --> 02:03:40.890
<v Speaker 1>What kind of childhood stories that you haven't heard?</v>

4516
02:03:40.940 --> 02:03:42.090
<v Speaker 1>The famous story.</v>

4517
02:03:42.091 --> 02:03:42.761
<v Speaker 1>They also use it.</v>

4518
02:03:42.761 --> 02:03:43.594
<v Speaker 1>They'll use it.</v>

4519
02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:46.130
<v Speaker 1>They'll see is in connection with that 20 stings.</v>

4520
02:03:46.131 --> 02:03:46.964
<v Speaker 1>Him and a guy.</v>

4521
02:03:48.220 --> 02:03:49.053
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

4522
02:03:50.870 --> 02:03:51.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the score.</v>

4523
02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:52.470
<v Speaker 1>That's a great,</v>

4524
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:53.310
<v Speaker 1>that's a great allegory.</v>

4525
02:03:53.340 --> 02:03:53.551
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4526

4528
02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:01.540
<v Speaker 1>that your children in the words and you legitimately had to worry about them get</v>

4529
02:04:01.541 --> 02:04:02.430
<v Speaker 1>eaten by wolves.</v>

4530
02:04:02.530 --> 02:04:03.310

<v Speaker 1>It's vegans are retarded.</v>

4533
02:04:06.980 --> 02:04:07.320
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

4534
02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:09.750
<v Speaker 1>that's the story of these motherfuckers [inaudible] everywhere</v>

02:04:11.370 --> 02:04:12.840
<v Speaker 1>because stay the fuck out of the woods.</v>

4536
02:04:12.841 --> 02:04:13.674
<v Speaker 1>Stay out of the woods.</v>

4537
02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:14.310
<v Speaker 1>The words,</v>

4538
02:04:14.310 --> 02:04:15.330
<v Speaker 1>there's a fucking wolf.</v>

4539
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:17.223
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4540
02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:19.560
<v Speaker 1>And then don't trust strangers actually.</v>

4541
02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4542
02:04:20.010 --> 02:04:22.890
<v Speaker 1>Well also number Numero Uno mentally for sure,</v>

4543
02:04:22.891 --> 02:04:25.800
<v Speaker 1>because the person inside the house and pretended to be his grandmother,</v>

4544
02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:29.850
<v Speaker 1>but the reason why they were always wolves where there's little red riding hood</v>

4545
02:04:29.851 --> 02:04:30.601
<v Speaker 1>of three little pigs.</v>

4546
02:04:30.601 --> 02:04:31.530
<v Speaker 1>It was always wolves.</v>

4547
02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Wolves legitimately ate a lot of fucking people and people seem to have forgot</v>

4548
02:04:35.401 --> 02:04:35.821
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

4549
02:04:35.821 --> 02:04:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Now we're all these assholes.</v>

4550
02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:38.640
<v Speaker 1>We need to bring back the wolf.</v>

4551
02:04:38.850 --> 02:04:42.770
<v Speaker 1>We need to make sure the Walter like wolves will kill everyone.</v>

4552
02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:43.613
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4553
02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:45.350
<v Speaker 1>they don't eat a lot of,</v>

4554
02:04:46.150 --> 02:04:47.660
<v Speaker 1>they eat some of what they killed.</v>

4555
02:04:48.050 --> 02:04:48.781
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

4556
02:04:48.781 --> 02:04:53.700
<v Speaker 1>wolves are so prey driven that they will kill whole herds of elk and not eat</v>

4557
02:04:53.701 --> 02:04:54.534
<v Speaker 1>half the meat.</v>

4558
02:04:54.600 --> 02:04:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I'll slap the fuck doing about German German fairytales like Hansel and Gretel.</v>

4559
02:04:59.070 --> 02:04:59.903
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>

4560
02:04:59.940 --> 02:05:02.250
<v Speaker 1>A lady and old lady takes him and she's a witch.</v>

4561
02:05:02.460 --> 02:05:05.580
<v Speaker 1>She puts them in a cage and starts feeding them too.</v>

4562
02:05:05.581 --> 02:05:06.120
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

4563
02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Plump them up so she can eat them more or less stories don't trust even old</v>

4564
02:05:10.921 --> 02:05:11.580
<v Speaker 1>ladies.</v>

4565
02:05:11.580 --> 02:05:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Germans are like,</v>

4566
02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:13.193
<v Speaker 1>you're a stranger.</v>

4567
02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:13.680
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

4568
02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

4569
02:05:14.130 --> 02:05:17.190
<v Speaker 1>let's be honest about like a long time ago,</v>

4570
02:05:17.310 --> 02:05:22.310
<v Speaker 1>a thousand years ago in rural areas where food was scarce and people had</v>

4571
02:05:23.401 --> 02:05:25.410
<v Speaker 1>suffered through a lifetime,</v>

4572
02:05:25.500 --> 02:05:30.500
<v Speaker 1>you weren't going to survive the winter and chaos and seeing murders and seeing</v>

4573
02:05:30.631 --> 02:05:32.760
<v Speaker 1>assault and rape and constant,</v>

4574
02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:34.530
<v Speaker 1>just the programming of person.</v>

4575
02:05:34.650 --> 02:05:36.360
<v Speaker 1>How much cannibalism was going on back then?</v>

4576
02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:38.260
<v Speaker 1>A lot according to Steven Rinella,</v>

4577
02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:39.240
<v Speaker 1>like in this country.</v>

4578
02:05:39.270 --> 02:05:40.103
<v Speaker 1>I mean Steve,</v>

4579
02:05:40.260 --> 02:05:43.290
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about the other day with the native Americans and Nez Perce.</v>

4580
02:05:43.390 --> 02:05:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Steve or Noah has the best native American stories.</v>

4581
02:05:46.771 --> 02:05:47.041
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

4582
02:05:47.041 --> 02:05:47.460
<v Speaker 1>he does,</v>

4583
02:05:47.460 --> 02:05:49.380
<v Speaker 1>he's a legit scholar almost.</v>

4584
02:05:49.381 --> 02:05:49.561
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4585
02:05:49.561 --> 02:05:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he would call himself that,</v>

4586
02:05:50.791 --> 02:05:55.791
<v Speaker 1>but he's incredibly knowledgeable on American history and like what the Nez</v>

4587
02:05:55.801 --> 02:05:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Perce Indians did in the,</v>

4588
02:05:56.911 --> 02:05:57.181
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

4589
02:05:57.181 --> 02:05:58.014
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

4590
02:05:58.370 --> 02:05:59.550
<v Speaker 1>like the Great Lakes area.</v>

4591
02:05:59.580 --> 02:06:01.140
<v Speaker 1>They would eat a lot of cannibalism,</v>

4592
02:06:01.141 --> 02:06:01.310
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4593
02:06:01.310 --> 02:06:02.820
<v Speaker 1>a lot and filed the teeth down.</v>

4594
02:06:02.910 --> 02:06:03.780
<v Speaker 1>That was a crazy guy,</v>

4595
02:06:03.781 --> 02:06:04.620
<v Speaker 1>right in the history</v>

4596
02:06:06.270 --> 02:06:07.530
<v Speaker 1>of the missionaries.</v>

4597
02:06:08.580 --> 02:06:09.960
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of documented evidence.</v>

4598
02:06:09.961 --> 02:06:10.890
<v Speaker 1>What that all was like,</v>

4599
02:06:10.891 --> 02:06:11.011
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4600
02:06:11.011 --> 02:06:12.180
<v Speaker 1>we got this from an Indian.</v>

4601
02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:13.260
<v Speaker 1>They were cannibals.</v>

4602
02:06:13.480 --> 02:06:16.180
<v Speaker 1>We have to kill them all because there are cannibals won't,</v>

4603
02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:17.860
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

4604
02:06:17.950 --> 02:06:19.110
<v Speaker 1>any problem might be honest.</v>

4605
02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes stories.</v>

4606
02:06:19.980 --> 02:06:21.270
<v Speaker 1>The ETJ they're going to eat.</v>

4607
02:06:21.940 --> 02:06:22.531
<v Speaker 1>We love that.</v>

4608
02:06:22.531 --> 02:06:23.650
<v Speaker 1>All the native Americans,</v>

4609
02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:24.713
<v Speaker 1>the hippies,</v>

4610
02:06:24.780 --> 02:06:25.680
<v Speaker 1>they were human beings.</v>

4611
02:06:25.681 --> 02:06:26.514
<v Speaker 1>Just like all of us.</v>

4612
02:06:26.830 --> 02:06:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Like all of us weren't any more noble.</v>

4613
02:06:29.510 --> 02:06:31.350
<v Speaker 1>They were no more noble than anybody else.</v>

4614
02:06:31.620 --> 02:06:33.000
<v Speaker 1>They were good people and bad people.</v>

4615
02:06:33.001 --> 02:06:34.170
<v Speaker 1>They were just as violent as,</v>

4616
02:06:34.410 --> 02:06:34.591
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

4617
02:06:34.591 --> 02:06:36.150
<v Speaker 1>the most violent people arguably could be,</v>

4618
02:06:36.151 --> 02:06:36.990
<v Speaker 1>could be white people.</v>

4619
02:06:36.991 --> 02:06:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Like what the Germans did.</v>

4620
02:06:38.210 --> 02:06:38.491
<v Speaker 1>It didn't.</v>

4621
02:06:38.491 --> 02:06:39.031
<v Speaker 1>White people,</v>

4622
02:06:39.031 --> 02:06:39.390
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4623
02:06:39.390 --> 02:06:39.541
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4624
02:06:39.541 --> 02:06:42.800
<v Speaker 1>I think also like when you're dealing with people in the Great Lake States,</v>

4625
02:06:42.990 --> 02:06:44.900
<v Speaker 1>the lights and fucking wipe it.</v>

4626
02:06:44.940 --> 02:06:46.590
<v Speaker 1>That's a horrific knockout mice,</v>

4627
02:06:46.760 --> 02:06:48.900
<v Speaker 1>the Roy Nelson Minataro knockout.</v>

4628
02:06:49.140 --> 02:06:49.800
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

4629
02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:52.170
<v Speaker 1>you know those people were living in a horrible,</v>

4630
02:06:52.171 --> 02:06:53.840
<v Speaker 1>horrible climate like the,</v>

4631
02:06:53.860 --> 02:06:58.380
<v Speaker 1>the Great Lakes before the invention of heat and it must have been so fun.</v>

4632
02:06:58.420 --> 02:06:59.253
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4633
02:07:00.030 --> 02:07:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4634
02:07:00.270 --> 02:07:02.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean people got desperado like,</v>

4635
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4636
02:07:02.580 --> 02:07:04.380
<v Speaker 1>we know about the Donner Party in Colorado.</v>

4637
02:07:04.381 --> 02:07:05.340
<v Speaker 1>They get trapped in the mountains.</v>

4638
02:07:05.340 --> 02:07:06.210
<v Speaker 1>They had to eat each other.</v>

4639
02:07:06.630 --> 02:07:08.520
<v Speaker 1>That shit probably happened all the time.</v>

4640
02:07:08.521 --> 02:07:09.354
<v Speaker 1>And the Great Lakes,</v>

4641
02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:10.560
<v Speaker 1>they just didn't talk about it.</v>

4642
02:07:10.561 --> 02:07:13.020
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about 15 below zero recently,</v>

4643
02:07:13.230 --> 02:07:13.471
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4644
02:07:13.471 --> 02:07:14.880
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what part you eat first.</v>

4645
02:07:15.240 --> 02:07:17.100
<v Speaker 1>The legs just go right to the asshole.</v>

4646
02:07:17.150 --> 02:07:18.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the worst part first for you.</v>

4647
02:07:18.811 --> 02:07:19.644
<v Speaker 1>I take the chest,</v>

4648
02:07:19.730 --> 02:07:20.431
<v Speaker 1>I hit your chest.</v>

4649
02:07:20.431 --> 02:07:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Say Listen,</v>

4650
02:07:21.210 --> 02:07:22.990
<v Speaker 1>worst case scenario meeting someone's asshole.</v>

4651
02:07:23.460 --> 02:07:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm a scoop it out with a sharp,</v>

4652
02:07:24.901 --> 02:07:25.800
<v Speaker 1>that's the last thing.</v>

4653
02:07:25.801 --> 02:07:27.330
<v Speaker 1>You Ain't a file a spoon with a,</v>

4654
02:07:27.331 --> 02:07:27.990
<v Speaker 1>with a fucking,</v>

4655
02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:29.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even going to pass on the shit.</v>

4656
02:07:29.221 --> 02:07:31.100
<v Speaker 1>You don't even want to like the shit you have to hold on to,</v>

4657
02:07:31.210 --> 02:07:31.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4658
02:07:31.550 --> 02:07:32.550
<v Speaker 1>I need to eat their shit.</v>

4659
02:07:32.670 --> 02:07:33.810
<v Speaker 1>I would eat their bowls in there.</v>

4660
02:07:33.811 --> 02:07:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>

4661
02:07:34.200 --> 02:07:34.481
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4662
02:07:34.481 --> 02:07:37.480
<v Speaker 1>why take first testosterone?</v>

4663
02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:40.480
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what the raccoons and the squirrels go after first.</v>

4664
02:07:40.481 --> 02:07:41.314
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason.</v>

4665
02:07:41.500 --> 02:07:42.333
<v Speaker 1>Think about that.</v>

4666
02:07:43.570 --> 02:07:44.403
<v Speaker 1>Now the ball,</v>

4667
02:07:45.340 --> 02:07:47.170
<v Speaker 1>that's how wolves determine who's the alpha.</v>

4668
02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:48.520
<v Speaker 1>The alpha gets to eat the liver.</v>

4669
02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:50.140
<v Speaker 1>That's why there was a,</v>

4670
02:07:50.340 --> 02:07:50.501
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4671
02:07:50.501 --> 02:07:51.410
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy who did a,</v>

4672
02:07:51.411 --> 02:07:52.330
<v Speaker 1>a a whole,</v>

4673
02:07:52.331 --> 02:07:53.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4674
02:07:53.020 --> 02:07:53.531
<v Speaker 1>this whole,</v>

4675
02:07:53.531 --> 02:07:57.800
<v Speaker 1>like he's a documentary where he lived with wolves and he,</v>

4676
02:07:57.801 --> 02:08:00.190
<v Speaker 1>he lived amongst them and he had to fake it.</v>

4677
02:08:00.191 --> 02:08:00.820
<v Speaker 1>Kill.</v>

4678
02:08:00.820 --> 02:08:04.270
<v Speaker 1>He would have a kill there and he would pack a liver inside of it and he would</v>

4679
02:08:04.271 --> 02:08:05.104
<v Speaker 1>pull the liver out.</v>

4680
02:08:05.230 --> 02:08:08.020
<v Speaker 1>He didn't in front of them and he had to eat it in front of them and then we let</v>

4681
02:08:08.021 --> 02:08:08.430
<v Speaker 1>them eat.</v>

4682
02:08:08.430 --> 02:08:09.263
<v Speaker 1>But he's like,</v>

4683
02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:09.861
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4684
02:08:09.861 --> 02:08:09.981
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4685
02:08:09.981 --> 02:08:10.131
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4686
02:08:10.131 --> 02:08:10.391
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4687
02:08:10.391 --> 02:08:11.224
<v Speaker 1>This fucking van.</v>

4688
02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:12.730
<v Speaker 1>It's terrifying.</v>

4689
02:08:12.750 --> 02:08:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4690
02:08:12.890 --> 02:08:13.651
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking terrifying.</v>

4691
02:08:13.651 --> 02:08:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Cause then here's,</v>

4692
02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:15.491
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>

4693
02:08:15.491 --> 02:08:16.120
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

4694
02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:19.550
<v Speaker 1>He had a farm nearby that was having problems with wolves and he,</v>

4695
02:08:19.560 --> 02:08:20.770
<v Speaker 1>this guy was a wolf scientist.</v>

4696
02:08:20.980 --> 02:08:22.330
<v Speaker 1>And so he would uh,</v>

4697
02:08:22.390 --> 02:08:26.320
<v Speaker 1>go there with these big gigantic speakers that play wolf sounds.</v>

4698
02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Cause he had a scare off this one pack of wolves with a new pack of wolves that</v>

4699
02:08:30.620 --> 02:08:32.350
<v Speaker 1>invade us instead of make it,</v>

4700
02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:33.880
<v Speaker 1>he had to make it scary enough.</v>

4701
02:08:33.881 --> 02:08:34.750
<v Speaker 1>So these worlds backed off.</v>

4702
02:08:34.751 --> 02:08:35.470
<v Speaker 1>It's all on video.</v>

4703
02:08:35.470 --> 02:08:37.030
<v Speaker 1>The scary thing is when the Alpha,</v>

4704
02:08:37.031 --> 02:08:37.631
<v Speaker 1>when there's a thing,</v>

4705
02:08:37.631 --> 02:08:38.464
<v Speaker 1>he came back,</v>

4706
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:40.770
<v Speaker 1>the guy came back after a month and the,</v>

4707
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:44.830
<v Speaker 1>there was a new wolf had taken over and so the new wolf wanted to kill him.</v>

4708
02:08:45.070 --> 02:08:45.970
<v Speaker 1>So he had a whimper.</v>

4709
02:08:45.980 --> 02:08:47.650
<v Speaker 1>She had a whimper in front of this wall.</v>

4710
02:08:48.050 --> 02:08:50.400
<v Speaker 1>So he was recognized as the,</v>

4711
02:08:50.430 --> 02:08:53.110
<v Speaker 1>the old alpha and to avoid being killed,</v>

4712
02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:54.190
<v Speaker 1>which is standard.</v>

4713
02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:55.353
<v Speaker 1>It's normal.</v>

4714
02:08:55.540 --> 02:08:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Like a wolf would challenge and they would fight to the death and the new alpha</v>

4715
02:08:58.211 --> 02:09:00.010
<v Speaker 1>would kill the or try to kill the old alpha.</v>

4716
02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:03.360
<v Speaker 1>He came back close to die because he was in his face growl.</v>

4717
02:09:04.090 --> 02:09:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Human involved in all that fucking shit.</v>

4718
02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:08.873
<v Speaker 1>The off the wall.</v>

4722
02:09:12.430 --> 02:09:13.570
<v Speaker 1>It's called living with wolves.</v>

4723
02:09:13.571 --> 02:09:14.404
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

4724
02:09:14.550 --> 02:09:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing about it,</v>

4725
02:09:15.401 --> 02:09:15.850
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4726
02:09:15.850 --> 02:09:18.010
<v Speaker 1>they don't understand that he's an unusual,</v>

4727
02:09:18.011 --> 02:09:19.240
<v Speaker 1>because they'd been with him since he was,</v>

4728
02:09:19.330 --> 02:09:20.163
<v Speaker 1>they were a baby.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I go the way that works.</v>

4731
02:09:22.091 --> 02:09:23.110
<v Speaker 1>He didn't just walk in.</v>

4732
02:09:23.140 --> 02:09:27.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a gigantic wildlife preserve and this guy lives in the wildlife preserve</v>

<v Speaker 3>according to this documentary that could be full of shit on Netflix.</v>

4895
02:13:06.350 --> 02:13:08.150
<v Speaker 3>but it cleanses itself.</v>

4896
02:13:08.210 --> 02:13:09.260
<v Speaker 3>You can still drink it.</v>

4897
02:13:09.261 --> 02:13:10.071
<v Speaker 3>You can be down in the river.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

4906
02:13:27.460 --> 02:13:29.260
<v Speaker 1>I used to have Eddie about the guy who's the,</v>

4907
02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:30.250
<v Speaker 1>they got killed in a boat.</v>

4908
02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:31.201
<v Speaker 1>There was a boat.</v>

4909
02:13:31.201 --> 02:13:32.670
<v Speaker 1>There was food diet with the Tigers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4911
02:13:32.911 --> 02:13:36.720
<v Speaker 1>They swam out to the boat and killed these guys individually one by one and</v>

4912
02:13:36.721 --> 02:13:37.830
<v Speaker 1>dragged him back to the shore.</v>

4913
02:13:38.100 --> 02:13:39.600
<v Speaker 1>The tiger swam out to the boat.</v>

4917
02:13:48.450 --> 02:13:50.080
<v Speaker 1>They love the taste of humans.</v>

4918

<v Speaker 1>Slobber off while they say,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He knocked out Nogueira like he was a fucking paper cutout.</v>

5001
02:16:14.080 --> 02:16:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Is he the hardest guy that's ever hit you?</v>

02:16:21.350 --> 02:16:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Like Rochelle Rochelle,</v>

5007
02:16:23.260 --> 02:16:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Rochelle can take it.</v>

5008
02:16:24.340 --> 02:16:24.641

<v Speaker 1>fuck you bitch.</v>

5010
02:16:25.750 --> 02:16:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Rochelle was about to get knocked down.</v>

5011
02:16:26.860 --> 02:16:29.050
<v Speaker 1>The grow shock isn't wrestler.</v>

5014
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:30.620
<v Speaker 2>mistake.</v>

5015
02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:30.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5016
02:16:30.940 --> 02:16:31.773
<v Speaker 2>National Champ,</v>

5017
02:16:32.470 --> 02:16:33.850
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight heavyweight match jam.</v>

5018
02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:35.500
<v Speaker 2>It's similar as sumo wrestling.</v>

5019
02:16:37.300 --> 02:16:38.770
<v Speaker 2>He can be shitty about it.</v>

5020
02:16:39.010 --> 02:16:40.770
<v Speaker 2>It really is really,</v>

5021
02:16:40.780 --> 02:16:43.890
<v Speaker 2>really until Brock Lesnar's in your division brought,</v>

5022
02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:46.250
<v Speaker 2>that was 20 years ago now,</v>

5023
02:16:46.300 --> 02:16:47.250
<v Speaker 2>but the whites that,</v>

5024
02:16:47.310 --> 02:16:50.470
<v Speaker 2>what's the difference between now and then like a Brock Lesnar was around today.</v>

5025
02:16:50.530 --> 02:16:51.363
<v Speaker 2>Is He rebelling?</v>

5026
02:16:52.750 --> 02:16:56.970
<v Speaker 2>There's no proxies out there and I don't know what's the exact college</v>

5027
02:16:56.980 --> 02:16:57.730
<v Speaker 2>wrestling?</v>

5028
02:16:57.730 --> 02:16:58.830
<v Speaker 2>I watched the finals</v>

5029
02:17:00.750 --> 02:17:01.150

5031
02:17:01.950 --> 02:17:03.100
<v Speaker 2>a blonde silver back.</v>

5032
02:17:03.890 --> 02:17:04.700
<v Speaker 2>Is it evolution?</v>

5033
02:17:04.700 --> 02:17:07.000
<v Speaker 2>Are we seeing the last of the Viking DNA?</v>

5034
02:17:07.001 --> 02:17:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Cause he is a regular sized wife.</v>

5035
02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:09.550
<v Speaker 2>Guys are growing straight.</v>

5036
02:17:09.551 --> 02:17:10.120
<v Speaker 2>Emo Now.</v>

02:17:10.390 --> 02:17:11.980
<v Speaker 2>probably he has a regular size wife.</v>

5039
02:17:11.981 --> 02:17:14.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure his children would be fucking gigantic.</v>

5040
02:17:14.081 --> 02:17:15.610
<v Speaker 2>But while Amy was a pro wrestler,</v>

5041

02:17:17.380 --> 02:17:17.881
<v Speaker 2>She was a,</v>

5045
02:17:17.881 --> 02:17:18.670

<v Speaker 2>He did well.</v>

5049
02:17:24.370 --> 02:17:25.203
<v Speaker 2>He did well for himself.</v>

5050
02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:27.610
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] to jack off to middle school.</v>

02:17:27.611 --> 02:17:28.740
<v Speaker 2>How dare you say that?</v>

5052
02:17:29.550 --> 02:17:29.740
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

02:17:37.661 --> 02:17:37.841
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

5060
02:17:37.841 --> 02:17:39.040
<v Speaker 2>if you met him in an alley,</v>

5061
02:17:39.041 --> 02:17:40.910
<v Speaker 2>he's like one of the worst people you could run into it for him.</v>

5062
02:17:40.930 --> 02:17:42.400
<v Speaker 2>He would rate me a brief exchange.</v>

5063
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.661
<v Speaker 2>Let's be real.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The guy who was born with a deformity.</v>

5141
02:19:43.700 --> 02:19:45.140
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about the launch with share.</v>

5142
02:19:45.290 --> 02:19:45.840
<v Speaker 2>We share.</v>

5143
02:19:45.840 --> 02:19:47.080
<v Speaker 2>That's mask</v>

5144
02:19:50.340 --> 02:19:51.100
<v Speaker 1>fair guy.</v>

5145
02:19:51.100 --> 02:19:53.710
<v Speaker 1>The Bear Guy Meets Sulu the bear man.</v>

5146
02:19:53.980 --> 02:19:54.281
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5147
02:19:54.281 --> 02:19:54.710
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

5148
02:19:54.710 --> 02:19:57.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a new bear guy and his face got ripped off too.</v>

5149
02:19:58.300 --> 02:19:59.133
<v Speaker 1>Did he get killed?</v>

5150
02:19:59.750 --> 02:20:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>

5151
02:20:00.490 --> 02:20:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Do you know Jamie are yet?</v>

5152
02:20:01.630 --> 02:20:03.820
<v Speaker 1>You guessing they kind of deserve it though?</v>

5153
02:20:03.821 --> 02:20:04.654
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5154
02:20:05.020 --> 02:20:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Find out if he got killed.</v>

5155
02:20:06.101 --> 02:20:08.020
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like the bearing number B watermelon,</v>

5156
02:20:08.021 --> 02:20:08.440
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

5157
02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:08.651
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5158
02:20:08.651 --> 02:20:09.610
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing about bears,</v>

5159
02:20:09.611 --> 02:20:09.881
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5160
02:20:09.881 --> 02:20:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Bears can be a lot like dogs if they're like really taken care of.</v>

5161
02:20:14.560 --> 02:20:16.180
<v Speaker 1>If you feed them and loved them,</v>

5162
02:20:16.181 --> 02:20:18.760
<v Speaker 1>like people have lived with bears where they like swim with bears,</v>

5163
02:20:18.970 --> 02:20:20.680
<v Speaker 1>would you gotta be with them for the time they were a baby?</v>

5164
02:20:20.681 --> 02:20:21.250
<v Speaker 1>They can never be,</v>

5165
02:20:21.250 --> 02:20:22.270
<v Speaker 1>never be feral.</v>

5166
02:20:22.540 --> 02:20:22.891
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

5167
02:20:22.891 --> 02:20:25.060
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be able to raise them and give them love.</v>

5168
02:20:25.061 --> 02:20:25.750
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

5169
02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:28.660
<v Speaker 1>they sort of have to identify with you.</v>

5170
02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:30.210
<v Speaker 1>They have to give a precise date,</v>

5171
02:20:30.220 --> 02:20:31.330
<v Speaker 1>but the imprint on you,</v>

5172
02:20:31.540 --> 02:20:32.440
<v Speaker 1>but they're like a dog.</v>

5173
02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:33.070
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of ways,</v>

5174
02:20:33.070 --> 02:20:33.791
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you,</v>

5175
02:20:33.791 --> 02:20:37.240
<v Speaker 1>it's always a risk because you're dealing with something that like one</v>

5176
02:20:37.241 --> 02:20:39.910
<v Speaker 1>generation removed was completely wild.</v>

5177
02:20:40.180 --> 02:20:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Like you could easily have a grizzly bear where you are.</v>

5178
02:20:42.790 --> 02:20:43.630
<v Speaker 1>You're the mother.</v>

5179
02:20:43.631 --> 02:20:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Grizzly bear had a fight for its life against a mountain lion that was trying to</v>

5180
02:20:47.381 --> 02:20:48.220
<v Speaker 1>kill this baby.</v>

5181
02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:48.611
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5182
02:20:48.611 --> 02:20:49.960
<v Speaker 1>that's totally possible.</v>

5183
02:20:49.961 --> 02:20:51.310
<v Speaker 1>And then here it is,</v>

5184
02:20:51.340 --> 02:20:54.400
<v Speaker 1>like one generation later you got the pop and it's living in your house.</v>

5185
02:20:54.420 --> 02:20:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Tell you write this cup.</v>

5186
02:20:55.540 --> 02:20:59.290
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather chill with those grizzly bears than the sum of those chimpanzees and</v>

5187
02:20:59.291 --> 02:21:00.124
<v Speaker 1>Shit in my house.</v>

5188
02:21:00.520 --> 02:21:00.851
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

5189
02:21:00.851 --> 02:21:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Call chimpanzees might decide to fuck you.</v>

5190
02:21:06.450 --> 02:21:08.270
<v Speaker 2>These are beers.</v>

5191
02:21:08.271 --> 02:21:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Just gonna rip my throat out.</v>

5192
02:21:10.070 --> 02:21:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Fucking shit wants to bust that.</v>

5193
02:21:12.741 --> 02:21:13.341
<v Speaker 2>None of my ass.</v>

5194
02:21:13.341 --> 02:21:14.091
<v Speaker 2>He's going to do it.</v>

5195
02:21:14.091 --> 02:21:14.281
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5196
02:21:14.281 --> 02:21:15.830
<v Speaker 2>it's on the verge of suicide.</v>

5197
02:21:15.831 --> 02:21:17.120
<v Speaker 2>If you want to commit suicide,</v>

5198
02:21:17.760 --> 02:21:19.250
<v Speaker 2>then that might be a good idea.</v>

5199
02:21:19.430 --> 02:21:19.941
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

5200
02:21:19.941 --> 02:21:20.960
<v Speaker 2>Since you're going to kill herself,</v>

5201
02:21:21.020 --> 02:21:23.610
<v Speaker 2>why not go fucking live with lions saying that he,</v>

5202
02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:24.171
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

5203
02:21:24.171 --> 02:21:24.921
<v Speaker 2>See what happens.</v>

5204
02:21:24.921 --> 02:21:25.760
<v Speaker 2>And then if they kill you,</v>

5205
02:21:25.761 --> 02:21:27.050
<v Speaker 2>whatever you were going to kill yourself.</v>

5206
02:21:27.051 --> 02:21:27.690
<v Speaker 2>Anyways.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Everyone did that.</v>

5428
02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:29.230
<v Speaker 2>Everyone has the same on the fucking time.</v>

5429
02:27:29.231 --> 02:27:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Generally,</v>

5430
02:27:29.890 --> 02:27:33.580
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do with that block every day when you break it all down,</v>

5431
02:27:33.581 --> 02:27:34.720
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do with that block?</v>

5432
02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:35.913
<v Speaker 2>If you say,</v>

5433
02:27:35.980 --> 02:27:40.300
<v Speaker 2>why don't you save all that time for shit that works on the big guys?</v>

5434
02:27:40.540 --> 02:27:41.590
<v Speaker 2>If it works on the big guys,</v>

5435
02:27:41.591 --> 02:27:42.540
<v Speaker 2>it's going to work on the small guys,</v>

5436
02:27:42.660 --> 02:27:43.930
<v Speaker 2>so let's just work on that.</v>

5437
02:27:44.140 --> 02:27:46.990
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with that at motherfucking all.</v>

5438
02:27:47.140 --> 02:27:48.160
<v Speaker 2>That's really it.</v>

5439
02:27:48.250 --> 02:27:49.240
<v Speaker 2>That's genius.</v>

5440
02:27:49.540 --> 02:27:50.530
<v Speaker 2>Me Personally,</v>

5441
02:27:50.740 --> 02:27:55.740
<v Speaker 2>I like working on everything that works on guys that have like 15 pounds on you.</v>

5442
02:27:58.180 --> 02:27:59.013
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

5443
02:27:59.170 --> 02:28:01.690
<v Speaker 2>Because you're going to be rolling out a lot with guys that are your uh,</v>

5444
02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:05.230
<v Speaker 2>your size and maybe as long as it works on guys that have a little weight on</v>

5445
02:28:05.231 --> 02:28:05.860
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

5446
02:28:05.860 --> 02:28:06.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm into those most.</v>

5447
02:28:06.991 --> 02:28:08.410
<v Speaker 2>To me that's a legit move.</v>

5448
02:28:08.530 --> 02:28:11.530
<v Speaker 2>If that works on a guy that's around your size at a high level,</v>

5449
02:28:11.890 --> 02:28:15.100
<v Speaker 2>I want that in my character actually just talking about that.</v>

5450
02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:16.240
<v Speaker 2>He would work on chokes.</v>

5451
02:28:16.270 --> 02:28:18.280
<v Speaker 2>He said Tokes always work,</v>

5452
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:19.720
<v Speaker 2>whereas other stuff,</v>

5453
02:28:19.750 --> 02:28:21.070
<v Speaker 2>but there's a difference between,</v>

5454
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:23.300
<v Speaker 2>there's a difference between a arm in chokes,</v>

5455
02:28:23.301 --> 02:28:27.200
<v Speaker 2>like Darcy is Japanese like tires arm and give teens and then straight net</v>

5456
02:28:27.201 --> 02:28:30.440
<v Speaker 2>trucks like Marcella teens and all these weird little fucking things like</v>

5457
02:28:30.500 --> 02:28:31.221
<v Speaker 2>Rothwell on,</v>

5458
02:28:31.221 --> 02:28:32.054
<v Speaker 2>on Barnett.</v>

5459
02:28:32.420 --> 02:28:34.220
<v Speaker 2>There's all these Ninja chokes and shit.</v>

5460
02:28:34.400 --> 02:28:39.400
<v Speaker 2>There's about 23 motherfucking ways to squeeze the neck to make a motherfucker</v>

5461
02:28:40.071 --> 02:28:40.904
<v Speaker 2>tat,</v>

5462
02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:41.601
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

5463
02:28:41.601 --> 02:28:46.130
<v Speaker 2>So all those take special time to get good at.</v>

5464
02:28:46.190 --> 02:28:50.960
<v Speaker 2>Just because you're good at one of the 23 makes it has nothing to do with are</v>

5465
02:28:50.961 --> 02:28:52.570
<v Speaker 2>you good at this one or are you going to that one?</v>

5466
02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:55.430
<v Speaker 2>You got to spend the same amount of time on that shit.</v>

5467
02:28:55.610 --> 02:28:56.870
<v Speaker 2>It might give you a little boost.</v>

5468
02:28:56.871 --> 02:28:58.690
<v Speaker 2>If you're really good this one then you'll really,</v>

5469
02:28:58.730 --> 02:29:02.160
<v Speaker 2>you'll get really good at this one quicker than a guy who's not good at that</v>

5470
02:29:02.161 --> 02:29:02.690
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

5471
02:29:02.690 --> 02:29:07.690
<v Speaker 2>But generally you've got to spend time and all these chokes to master any,</v>

5472
02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:08.511
<v Speaker 2>let me ask this for,</v>

5473
02:29:08.511 --> 02:29:09.620
<v Speaker 2>I forget who was that.</v>

5474
02:29:09.660 --> 02:29:12.320
<v Speaker 2>There was one choke that I saw only once in the UFC.</v>

5475
02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:17.510
<v Speaker 2>It was a choke like Gogo Plata by a kid who was a tiger showmen student.</v>

5476
02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:21.320
<v Speaker 2>Nick Nick something or another it the UFC.</v>

5477
02:29:21.350 --> 02:29:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5478
02:29:21.860 --> 02:29:26.720
<v Speaker 2>He had some crazy choke and he said that he invented it while it was going on.</v>

5479
02:29:26.930 --> 02:29:27.231
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

5480
02:29:27.231 --> 02:29:28.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm venting it in the fight.</v>

5481
02:29:28.950 --> 02:29:29.783
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5482
02:29:30.110 --> 02:29:31.610
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what that is.</v>

5483
02:29:31.611 --> 02:29:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I'm talking about?</v>

5484
02:29:32.451 --> 02:29:33.960
<v Speaker 2>I know what I'm talking about but I don't remember.</v>

5485
02:29:33.970 --> 02:29:34.820
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't show you.</v>

5486
02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:38.230
<v Speaker 2>I showed him techniques all the Goddamn time.</v>

5487
02:29:38.440 --> 02:29:39.320
<v Speaker 2>None of my shit.</v>

5488
02:29:39.500 --> 02:29:41.660
<v Speaker 2>I should have videotaped that cause that shit gone</v>

5489
02:29:44.350 --> 02:29:46.370
<v Speaker 2>take new shit.</v>

5490
02:29:46.880 --> 02:29:47.713
<v Speaker 2>Nick Pace.</v>

5491
02:29:48.250 --> 02:29:49.083
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5492
02:29:49.230 --> 02:29:50.260
<v Speaker 2>He did some crazy.</v>

5493
02:29:50.420 --> 02:29:53.200
<v Speaker 2>See if you can find a submission because there was some weird legs and Michigan</v>

5494
02:29:53.360 --> 02:29:53.680
<v Speaker 2>Trump,</v>

5495
02:29:53.680 --> 02:29:54.513
<v Speaker 2>I can show you.</v>

5496
02:29:54.650 --> 02:29:59.650
<v Speaker 2>Well I remember it was something to zoo with a Shin across the neck by the</v>

5497
02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:01.430
<v Speaker 2>guests.</v>

5498
02:30:01.430 --> 02:30:02.091
<v Speaker 2>It was a joke.</v>

5499
02:30:02.091 --> 02:30:06.120
<v Speaker 2>It was some weird choke that had to do with some weird like Alma Plata type set</v>

5500
02:30:06.121 --> 02:30:09.650
<v Speaker 2>up and he wound up in some position with his Shin underneath this guy's choke</v>

5501
02:30:09.880 --> 02:30:13.340
<v Speaker 2>and underneath this guy's neck in an unconventional way that I don't necessarily</v>

5502
02:30:13.341 --> 02:30:14.174
<v Speaker 2>remember.</v>

5503
02:30:14.510 --> 02:30:15.343
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to see it again.</v>

5504
02:30:15.350 --> 02:30:19.310
<v Speaker 2>But I remember saying if you done that before and he said that was the first</v>

5505
02:30:19.311 --> 02:30:19.711
<v Speaker 2>time he did it,</v>

5506
02:30:19.711 --> 02:30:20.210
<v Speaker 2>ever did it.</v>

5507
02:30:20.210 --> 02:30:20.541
<v Speaker 2>Is there,</v>

5508
02:30:20.541 --> 02:30:22.340
<v Speaker 2>is there a huge difference between guys?</v>

5509
02:30:22.341 --> 02:30:23.030
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

5510
02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:23.863
<v Speaker 2>Is there a huge difference?</v>

5511
02:30:24.350 --> 02:30:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Really good guys now and 10 years ago.</v>

5512
02:30:26.780 --> 02:30:27.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5513
02:30:27.270 --> 02:30:27.950
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu wise,</v>

5514
02:30:27.950 --> 02:30:28.880
<v Speaker 2>like all different techniques.</v>

5515
02:30:29.240 --> 02:30:34.240
<v Speaker 2>That's like saying is there a difference in standup comedy now in general as in</v>

5516
02:30:35.061 --> 02:30:38.590
<v Speaker 2>the 80s come on in the 80s of his co there's really got them right.</v>

5517
02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:39.673
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

5518
02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:41.000
<v Speaker 2>Same Day,</v>

5519
02:30:41.120 --> 02:30:41.953
<v Speaker 2>same</v>

5520
02:30:43.980 --> 02:30:44.781
<v Speaker 2>look up behind you.</v>

5521
02:30:44.781 --> 02:30:47.230
<v Speaker 2>That's the choke nick pace going to show us to it.</v>

5522
02:30:47.231 --> 02:30:48.080
<v Speaker 2>Why is it looks so crappy,</v>

5523
02:30:48.081 --> 02:30:48.914
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>

5524
02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:50.270
<v Speaker 2>See you look at this.</v>

5525
02:30:50.270 --> 02:30:51.320
<v Speaker 2>He grabs it like this.</v>

5526
02:30:51.321 --> 02:30:52.790
<v Speaker 2>He throws the leg over the neck,</v>

5527
02:30:53.410 --> 02:30:57.410
<v Speaker 2>shoots under like this and he grabs his ankle gun show control.</v>

5528
02:30:57.560 --> 02:30:58.161
<v Speaker 2>That's called gun,</v>

5529
02:30:58.161 --> 02:30:59.240
<v Speaker 2>but he chokes him from here.</v>

5530
02:30:59.300 --> 02:30:59.750
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

5531
02:30:59.750 --> 02:31:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

5532
02:31:00.470 --> 02:31:01.303
<v Speaker 2>I got a guy,</v>

5533
02:31:01.360 --> 02:31:02.860
<v Speaker 2>Ben Eddy who does this ship.</v>

5534
02:31:03.570 --> 02:31:04.403
<v Speaker 2>So all the time</v>

5535
02:31:05.970 --> 02:31:10.540
<v Speaker 2>Dan came up with this on the fly in the UFC dam and um,</v>

5536
02:31:10.830 --> 02:31:11.140
<v Speaker 2>how many,</v>

5537
02:31:11.140 --> 02:31:11.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5538
02:31:11.540 --> 02:31:12.640
<v Speaker 2>he calls it the pace choke.</v>

5539
02:31:12.820 --> 02:31:13.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

5540
02:31:13.350 --> 02:31:14.690
<v Speaker 2>I hair is great.</v>

5541
02:31:14.750 --> 02:31:15.760
<v Speaker 2>I do want to do that.</v>

5542
02:31:15.770 --> 02:31:17.390
<v Speaker 2>Eve Joe's cow.</v>

5543
02:31:17.600 --> 02:31:19.060
<v Speaker 2>Now check out.</v>

5544
02:31:19.070 --> 02:31:23.640
<v Speaker 2>He always has really legit whose style is based off.</v>

5545
02:31:23.641 --> 02:31:24.720
<v Speaker 2>That said it looks nice,</v>

5546
02:31:25.150 --> 02:31:26.550
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to show control.</v>

5547
02:31:27.510 --> 02:31:28.440
<v Speaker 2>Spend a lot of times.</v>

5548
02:31:28.700 --> 02:31:29.190
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

5549
02:31:29.190 --> 02:31:30.480
<v Speaker 2>that's an atomic green.</v>

5550
02:31:30.510 --> 02:31:33.020
<v Speaker 2>Those guys taught Tiger Schulman for a lot of children.</v>

5551
02:31:33.540 --> 02:31:34.373
<v Speaker 2>Those guys were</v>

5552
02:31:34.420 --> 02:31:37.210
<v Speaker 1>giant karate chain in um,</v>

5553
02:31:37.390 --> 02:31:39.010
<v Speaker 1>the east coast in New York all the time.</v>

5554
02:31:39.011 --> 02:31:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Like you both vehicles.</v>

5555
02:31:40.060 --> 02:31:41.710
<v Speaker 1>They didn't think of him as legit,</v>

5556
02:31:41.950 --> 02:31:43.750
<v Speaker 1>like necessarily because they thought,</v>

5557
02:31:43.751 --> 02:31:44.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5558
02:31:44.050 --> 02:31:46.060
<v Speaker 1>most giant karate schools aren't legit.</v>

5559
02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5560
02:31:46.420 --> 02:31:47.170
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

5561
02:31:47.170 --> 02:31:48.010
<v Speaker 1>they are legit.</v>

5562
02:31:48.230 --> 02:31:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Me Think Uriah Hall,</v>

5563
02:31:49.540 --> 02:31:50.373
<v Speaker 1>this fucking kid,</v>

5564
02:31:50.380 --> 02:31:51.730
<v Speaker 1>nick pace came from there.</v>

5565
02:31:51.731 --> 02:31:54.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm that guy who won last,</v>

5566
02:31:54.881 --> 02:31:55.870

02:32:18.550 --> 02:32:19.211
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

5580
02:32:19.211 --> 02:32:20.260
<v Speaker 1>And this nick paste kid,</v>

5581
02:32:20.680 --> 02:32:24.310
<v Speaker 1>it's like they were one of the few like big name schools.</v>

5582
02:32:24.400 --> 02:32:28.120
<v Speaker 1>That was a whole chain that became like a real legit gym.</v>

5583
02:32:28.270 --> 02:32:29.103
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

5584
02:32:29.610 --> 02:32:33.730
<v Speaker 1>Karate chain number one karate chain.</v>

5585
02:32:33.731 --> 02:32:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's others that did it.</v>

5586
02:32:34.811 --> 02:32:35.411
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there are.</v>

5587
02:32:35.411 --> 02:32:40.411
<v Speaker 1>But Tiger shellmans was a straight dominant karate chain and when they saw the</v>

5588
02:32:42.040 --> 02:32:42.873
<v Speaker 1>unfold,</v>

5589
02:32:43.380 --> 02:32:43.960
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

5590
02:32:43.960 --> 02:32:44.291
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5591

<v Speaker 1>we adopt,</v>

5592
02:32:46.060 --> 02:32:46.900
<v Speaker 1>we need some of that.</v>

5593
02:32:46.901 --> 02:32:47.950
<v Speaker 1>We need someone that's a tiger.</v>

5594
02:32:47.951 --> 02:32:49.660

<v Speaker 1>openminded modern.</v>

5596
02:32:51.540 --> 02:32:52.373
<v Speaker 2>Another way to look at it.</v>

5597
02:32:53.020 --> 02:32:55.310
<v Speaker 2>Do you want me to look at as you have it that big of school and they're always</v>

5598
02:32:55.311 --> 02:32:57.290

5605
02:33:03.380 --> 02:33:06.530
<v Speaker 2>most of the traditional martial arts associations didn't evolve.</v>

5606
02:33:06.800 --> 02:33:08.480
<v Speaker 2>Tiger shellmans was all about evolution.</v>

5607
02:33:08.750 --> 02:33:09.440

02:35:37.961 --> 02:35:38.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5712
02:35:38.530 --> 02:35:42.280
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine if Conor McGregor has a contract that would allow him at a</v>

5713
02:35:42.281 --> 02:35:44.320
<v Speaker 1>certain time to no longer be with the UFC,</v>

5714
02:35:44.500 --> 02:35:46.600
<v Speaker 1>he could do whatever the fuck he can take the spar with him,</v>

5715
02:35:46.780 --> 02:35:47.950
<v Speaker 1>but here's the question.</v>

5716
02:35:48.190 --> 02:35:49.023
<v Speaker 1>Why would he,</v>

5717
02:35:49.090 --> 02:35:49.571
<v Speaker 1>why would,</v>

5718
02:35:49.571 --> 02:35:50.200
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

5719
02:35:50.200 --> 02:35:51.930
<v Speaker 1>It's those last two fights on that main event.</v>

5720
02:35:52.600 --> 02:35:53.433
<v Speaker 1>Ghost him.</v>

5721
02:35:53.650 --> 02:35:57.210
<v Speaker 1>What would you say that command Nunez is?</v>

5722
02:35:57.220 --> 02:35:57.910
<v Speaker 1>No girl.</v>

5723
02:35:57.910 --> 02:35:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Let's not talk about that right now.</v>

5724
02:35:59.130 --> 02:36:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Let's let's what?</v>

5725
02:36:00.620 --> 02:36:04.360
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying about Connor is that Connor is a fucking legit superstar,</v>

5726
02:36:04.361 --> 02:36:06.010
<v Speaker 1>but the UFC made him a superstar.</v>

5727
02:36:06.370 --> 02:36:08.440
<v Speaker 1>Like the UFC is the perfect vehicle.</v>

5728
02:36:08.590 --> 02:36:09.610
<v Speaker 1>They've got everything down.</v>

5729
02:36:09.700 --> 02:36:10.660
<v Speaker 1>The promotion,</v>

5730
02:36:10.810 --> 02:36:11.643
<v Speaker 1>the management,</v>

5731
02:36:11.710 --> 02:36:12.910
<v Speaker 1>the way it's all set up.</v>

5732
02:36:13.120 --> 02:36:14.860
<v Speaker 1>The way the fuck the marketing is on point.</v>

5733
02:36:14.861 --> 02:36:15.970
<v Speaker 1>It's on another level.</v>

5734
02:36:15.971 --> 02:36:17.830
<v Speaker 1>If you go to some other organization,</v>

5735
02:36:18.130 --> 02:36:20.650
<v Speaker 1>good luck running a smooth ship.</v>

5736
02:36:20.890 --> 02:36:22.330
<v Speaker 1>What happened to affliction?</v>

5737
02:36:22.450 --> 02:36:23.590
<v Speaker 1>What happened to elite x,</v>

5738
02:36:23.591 --> 02:36:23.950
<v Speaker 1>Z,</v>

5739
02:36:23.950 --> 02:36:26.950
<v Speaker 1>what happened and strife for bottom line.</v>

5740
02:36:27.160 --> 02:36:29.260
<v Speaker 1>The bottom line is Grier calm.</v>

5741
02:36:29.290 --> 02:36:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Conor McGregor would be unknown to the world and Ireland training in a boxing</v>

5742
02:36:33.821 --> 02:36:34.390
<v Speaker 1>gym.</v>

5743
02:36:34.390 --> 02:36:37.420
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't for the u s 100% of remember that she ever sent,</v>

5744
02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:39.370
<v Speaker 1>he's got the UFC made him famous.</v>

5745
02:36:39.420 --> 02:36:39.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5746
02:36:39.520 --> 02:36:41.470
<v Speaker 1>green [inaudible] deserves the money.</v>

5747
02:36:41.500 --> 02:36:43.330
<v Speaker 1>It was a cooperative venture.</v>

5748
02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:44.800
<v Speaker 1>There's no either or.</v>

5749
02:36:44.801 --> 02:36:46.630
<v Speaker 1>They're not mutually exclusive in their,</v>

5750
02:36:46.631 --> 02:36:46.931
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

5751
02:36:46.931 --> 02:36:48.190
<v Speaker 1>their amount of success.</v>

5752
02:36:48.460 --> 02:36:50.080
<v Speaker 1>That was dependent upon their actions.</v>

5753
02:36:50.081 --> 02:36:51.730
<v Speaker 1>They both benefit from no,</v>

5754
02:36:51.731 --> 02:36:51.881
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5755
02:36:51.881 --> 02:36:52.390
<v Speaker 1>but no.</v>

5756
02:36:52.390 --> 02:36:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Make no mistake about it.</v>

5757
02:36:53.470 --> 02:36:54.011
<v Speaker 1>The UFC,</v>

5758
02:36:54.011 --> 02:36:54.940
<v Speaker 1>would it always be big?</v>

5759
02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

5760
02:36:55.430 --> 02:36:56.410
<v Speaker 1>but always be big.</v>

5761
02:36:56.440 --> 02:36:57.790
<v Speaker 1>If there was never a Connor,</v>

5762
02:36:57.880 --> 02:36:59.440
<v Speaker 1>the UFC would be just as been,</v>

5763
02:36:59.500 --> 02:37:01.660
<v Speaker 1>but never as big as with a guy like that.</v>

5764
02:37:01.810 --> 02:37:03.910
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be as big as what that guy is,</v>

5765
02:37:03.911 --> 02:37:04.920
<v Speaker 1>you need econom McGregor.</v>

5766
02:37:04.930 --> 02:37:05.920
<v Speaker 1>So the only way it happened,</v>

5767
02:37:05.921 --> 02:37:06.910
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it.</v>

5768
02:37:06.970 --> 02:37:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Or Rodney?</v>

5769
02:37:07.540 --> 02:37:08.200
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>

5770
02:37:08.200 --> 02:37:09.033
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>

5771
02:37:09.660 --> 02:37:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5772
02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:14.020
<v Speaker 1>I've always been fascinated with Connor.</v>

5773
02:37:14.050 --> 02:37:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Maybe GSP today,</v>

5774
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 1>maybe GSP today.</v>

5775
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:19.550
<v Speaker 2>Why would he says I think the UFC today is bigger than it's ever been.</v>

5776
02:37:19.570 --> 02:37:22.220
<v Speaker 2>I think she has a young GSP today.</v>

5777
02:37:22.221 --> 02:37:23.120
<v Speaker 2>If he was a champion,</v>

5778
02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:24.290
<v Speaker 2>goddammit,</v>

5779
02:37:24.290 --> 02:37:24.951
<v Speaker 2>girls would be there.</v>

5780
02:37:24.951 --> 02:37:29.150
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking damp panties would be filling up 100,000 seat arenas.</v>

5781
02:37:29.180 --> 02:37:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5782
02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:30.583
<v Speaker 2>he's a stud.</v>

5783
02:37:31.420 --> 02:37:34.820
<v Speaker 2>He's CSP was in his prime,</v>

5784
02:37:34.850 --> 02:37:39.260
<v Speaker 2>like when he was like when he beat Bj Penn for defending his title when he was</v>

5785
02:37:39.261 --> 02:37:40.130
<v Speaker 2>in his prime.</v>

5786
02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:40.791
<v Speaker 2>If Bj,</v>

5787
02:37:40.791 --> 02:37:41.750
<v Speaker 2>if the UFC was,</v>

5788
02:37:41.810 --> 02:37:43.880
<v Speaker 2>I think the UFC is probably,</v>

5789
02:37:43.881 --> 02:37:46.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't know how many more people watch it now than then,</v>

5790
02:37:46.940 --> 02:37:48.710
<v Speaker 2>but as far as like being well known,</v>

5791
02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:49.850
<v Speaker 2>it's way more well known.</v>

5792
02:37:49.910 --> 02:37:51.140
<v Speaker 2>I agree way more.</v>

5793
02:37:51.530 --> 02:37:53.390
<v Speaker 2>What about Bj Penn coming back?</v>

5794
02:37:53.391 --> 02:37:54.260
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

5795
02:37:54.261 --> 02:37:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

5796
02:37:54.920 --> 02:37:55.641
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

5797
02:37:55.641 --> 02:37:55.791
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

5798
02:37:55.791 --> 02:37:56.624
<v Speaker 2>Part of me.</v>

5799
02:37:56.900 --> 02:37:58.400
<v Speaker 2>He went to fucking Greg Jackson.</v>

5800
02:37:58.410 --> 02:37:59.243
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

5801
02:37:59.510 --> 02:38:00.530
<v Speaker 2>he thought about it.</v>

5802
02:38:00.620 --> 02:38:05.090
<v Speaker 2>He's sitting there and fucking on Hilo chill on the volcanoes outside the</v>

5803
02:38:05.091 --> 02:38:05.960
<v Speaker 2>fucking window.</v>

5804
02:38:06.050 --> 02:38:07.640
<v Speaker 2>He thought about it and he knew it.</v>

5805
02:38:07.670 --> 02:38:08.570
<v Speaker 2>He came back.</v>

5806
02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:09.680
<v Speaker 2>What did he fucking do?</v>

5807
02:38:09.770 --> 02:38:11.300
<v Speaker 2>He goes to Greg Jackson.</v>

5808
02:38:11.660 --> 02:38:11.931
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5809
02:38:11.931 --> 02:38:13.610
<v Speaker 2>he did the best fucking thing possible.</v>

5810
02:38:13.700 --> 02:38:13.941
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5811
02:38:13.941 --> 02:38:15.010
<v Speaker 2>he could have went to Aka can.</v>

5812
02:38:15.011 --> 02:38:15.420
<v Speaker 2>I went to trial.</v>

5813
02:38:15.420 --> 02:38:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Tracy has a fight attention,</v>

5814
02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:17.653
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

5815
02:38:18.850 --> 02:38:21.860
<v Speaker 2>he decided to go to the one of the top fucking schools.</v>

5816
02:38:21.920 --> 02:38:24.230
<v Speaker 2>But Jackson is not a bad goddamn choice.</v>

5817
02:38:24.231 --> 02:38:25.064
<v Speaker 2>The best choice.</v>

5818
02:38:25.260 --> 02:38:25.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5819
02:38:25.460 --> 02:38:27.560
<v Speaker 2>it's one of like five best choices.</v>

5820
02:38:27.890 --> 02:38:28.371
<v Speaker 2>Eric Holt,</v>

5821
02:38:28.371 --> 02:38:30.110
<v Speaker 2>Delfi Arrow down in the lions.</v>

5822
02:38:30.140 --> 02:38:33.830
<v Speaker 2>That's a best choice you've got for Rasa Hobby,</v>

5823
02:38:33.831 --> 02:38:35.480
<v Speaker 2>who is probably my first choice,</v>

5824
02:38:35.481 --> 02:38:39.200
<v Speaker 2>or one of them would be my number one him or least her bowling as a striking</v>

5825
02:38:39.201 --> 02:38:39.471
<v Speaker 2>coach.</v>

5826
02:38:39.471 --> 02:38:44.471
<v Speaker 2>You mean everything coach or a mastermind mastermind</v>

5827
02:38:46.250 --> 02:38:47.660
<v Speaker 2>though I think.</v>

5828
02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:51.200
<v Speaker 2>I think that working number one mighty mouse is coach,</v>

5829
02:38:52.300 --> 02:38:53.133
<v Speaker 2>so you're right.</v>

5830
02:38:53.710 --> 02:38:54.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm mad human.</v>

5831
02:38:54.561 --> 02:38:54.891
<v Speaker 2>For us,</v>

5832
02:38:54.891 --> 02:38:56.330
<v Speaker 2>a hobby to me are commensurate.</v>

5833
02:38:56.660 --> 02:38:58.040
<v Speaker 2>I think they're exactly the same level.</v>

5834
02:38:58.070 --> 02:38:59.090
<v Speaker 2>They're both wizards.</v>

5835
02:38:59.350 --> 02:39:00.620
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about those guys.</v>

5836
02:39:00.650 --> 02:39:01.483
<v Speaker 2>They're masters.</v>

5837
02:39:01.610 --> 02:39:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Matt Hume had more MMA fights I think for us.</v>

5838
02:39:04.740 --> 02:39:05.100
<v Speaker 2>Had some,</v>

5839
02:39:05.100 --> 02:39:06.260
<v Speaker 2>a lot of kickboxing fights.</v>

5840
02:39:06.500 --> 02:39:10.250
<v Speaker 2>But for us it's like nasty on the ground and he's a super genius when it comes</v>

5841
02:39:10.251 --> 02:39:11.510
<v Speaker 2>to like his analytical mind,</v>

5842
02:39:11.511 --> 02:39:12.500
<v Speaker 2>the way it breaks down fights.</v>

5843
02:39:12.501 --> 02:39:15.470
<v Speaker 2>He breaks down street fights cause youtube videos where he breaks down.</v>

5844
02:39:15.490 --> 02:39:15.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5845
02:39:15.650 --> 02:39:18.200
<v Speaker 2>it breaks down how this guy came out of guy and he got cracked.</v>

5846
02:39:18.201 --> 02:39:19.940
<v Speaker 2>This guy with a left hook and he explains the footwork,</v>

5847
02:39:20.060 --> 02:39:21.140
<v Speaker 2>draws it in a diagram.</v>

5848
02:39:21.141 --> 02:39:24.140
<v Speaker 2>He's also a young smart as fuck.</v>

5849
02:39:24.650 --> 02:39:25.970
<v Speaker 2>He's younger and he's been through it.</v>

5850
02:39:25.971 --> 02:39:27.260
<v Speaker 2>Like he came up with everyone.</v>

5851
02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:29.090
<v Speaker 2>It was the coolest fucking thing he did.</v>

5852
02:39:29.210 --> 02:39:34.210
<v Speaker 2>He just put out a video or he's testing guard work and ground and pound on</v>

5853
02:39:34.851 --> 02:39:35.150
<v Speaker 2>guards.</v>

5854
02:39:35.150 --> 02:39:37.160
<v Speaker 2>What guard works best for granted.</v>

5855
02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:38.930
<v Speaker 2>He did this shit.</v>

5856
02:39:38.931 --> 02:39:40.100
<v Speaker 2>He put it on Youtube,</v>

5857
02:39:40.220 --> 02:39:41.030
<v Speaker 2>he put it up.</v>

5858
02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:42.230
<v Speaker 2>So he had him,</v>

5859
02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:43.333
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

5860
02:39:43.580 --> 02:39:46.430
<v Speaker 2>Gary Tilden and I think Gordon Ryan,</v>

5861
02:39:46.580 --> 02:39:48.860
<v Speaker 2>they had like some dude jumped with,</v>

5862
02:39:48.861 --> 02:39:49.940
<v Speaker 2>with boxing gloves,</v>

5863
02:39:49.960 --> 02:39:52.010
<v Speaker 2>jump in the Gar and start pounding them.</v>

5864
02:39:52.390 --> 02:39:52.721
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

5865
02:39:52.721 --> 02:39:53.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5866
02:39:53.480 --> 02:39:54.530
<v Speaker 2>and in the video,</v>

5867
02:39:54.680 --> 02:39:55.760
<v Speaker 2>the guys on the bottom,</v>

5868
02:39:55.790 --> 02:39:58.490
<v Speaker 2>whether it was for Gary telling him or I think it was Gordon,</v>

5869
02:39:58.491 --> 02:40:00.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't fucking know that third guy was,</v>

5870
02:40:00.550 --> 02:40:01.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5871
02:40:01.310 --> 02:40:04.000
<v Speaker 2>but they were just wrecking the guy on top of leg locks.</v>

5872
02:40:04.430 --> 02:40:04.970
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5873
02:40:04.970 --> 02:40:05.870
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of different things.</v>

5874
02:40:06.050 --> 02:40:10.640
<v Speaker 2>It was like a revolutionary experimentation.</v>

5875
02:40:11.030 --> 02:40:11.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5876
02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:13.560
<v Speaker 2>one of the smartest things you could ever do.</v>

5877
02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:16.200
<v Speaker 3>The only thing I think version two,</v>

5878
02:40:16.710 --> 02:40:17.431
<v Speaker 3>he needs to,</v>

5879
02:40:17.431 --> 02:40:19.230
<v Speaker 3>I think we should add,</v>

5880
02:40:19.620 --> 02:40:19.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5881
02:40:19.980 --> 02:40:22.450
<v Speaker 3>there's different scenarios and ground and pound,</v>

5882
02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:23.310
<v Speaker 3>it's not always,</v>

5883
02:40:23.310 --> 02:40:25.170
<v Speaker 3>it's not always the same ground and pound.</v>

5884
02:40:25.260 --> 02:40:26.940
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes the guys on top,</v>

5885
02:40:27.330 --> 02:40:29.490
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't want even be on the ground.</v>

5886
02:40:29.580 --> 02:40:31.440
<v Speaker 3>So if you're not holding him on the ground,</v>

5887
02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:33.120
<v Speaker 3>he's going to stand up and back out.</v>

5888
02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:34.530
<v Speaker 3>You have to have that,</v>

5889
02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:36.210
<v Speaker 3>that scenario to what happens.</v>

5890
02:40:36.211 --> 02:40:38.460
<v Speaker 3>And that's what God is best for.</v>

5891
02:40:38.461 --> 02:40:40.260
<v Speaker 3>A guy that's on top.</v>

5892
02:40:40.261 --> 02:40:41.070
<v Speaker 3>And your guard,</v>

5893
02:40:41.070 --> 02:40:43.350
<v Speaker 3>you must have pulled guard because he didn't try to take you down.</v>

5894
02:40:43.410 --> 02:40:44.520
<v Speaker 3>He wants to stay on to sleep.</v>

5895
02:40:44.550 --> 02:40:45.960
<v Speaker 3>So as soon as you open your guard,</v>

5896
02:40:45.961 --> 02:40:47.310
<v Speaker 3>he's going to back out and he's gone.</v>

5897
02:40:47.430 --> 02:40:50.370
<v Speaker 3>So what guard is best for that scenario?</v>

5898
02:40:50.490 --> 02:40:51.740
<v Speaker 3>And there's another scenario also,</v>

5899
02:40:51.741 --> 02:40:54.300
<v Speaker 3>you have the scenario where the guy is getting beat.</v>

5900
02:40:54.301 --> 02:40:56.520
<v Speaker 3>Your opponent is getting beat up on his feet.</v>

5901
02:40:56.670 --> 02:41:01.670
<v Speaker 3>So he's taking you down at will and you have to deal with the guy who's trying</v>

5902
02:41:01.981 --> 02:41:03.600
<v Speaker 3>not to let you stand up.</v>

5903
02:41:03.750 --> 02:41:08.750
<v Speaker 3>So I think a version two of those ground and pound experimentation to figure out</v>

5904
02:41:10.621 --> 02:41:11.550
<v Speaker 3>what's the best guard.</v>

5905
02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.340
<v Speaker 3>I think that's my 2 cents.</v>

5906
02:41:14.460 --> 02:41:15.630
<v Speaker 3>But what the fuck do I know?</v>

5907
02:41:15.631 --> 02:41:16.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

5908
02:41:16.230 --> 02:41:21.060
<v Speaker 3>But the fact that for Ross actually did that it he's already experimenting on</v>

5909
02:41:21.061 --> 02:41:23.850
<v Speaker 3>what is the best guard for ground and pound.</v>

5910
02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:24.630
<v Speaker 3>That's brilliant.</v>

5911
02:41:24.630 --> 02:41:25.463
<v Speaker 3>I love it</v>

5912
02:41:25.940 --> 02:41:29.100
<v Speaker 1>for m and an MMA that says Nma,</v>

5913
02:41:29.550 --> 02:41:31.320
<v Speaker 1>he makes his UFC debut,</v>

5914
02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:34.290
<v Speaker 1>but I could've sworn and he's trying to bet on this main event.</v>

5915
02:41:34.291 --> 02:41:35.124
<v Speaker 1>Son.</v>

5916
02:41:35.790 --> 02:41:36.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to,</v>

5917
02:41:36.330 --> 02:41:36.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to,</v>

5918
02:41:36.970 --> 02:41:37.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5919
02:41:37.440 --> 02:41:38.340
<v Speaker 1>you want to break down the garden?</v>

5920
02:41:38.400 --> 02:41:39.181
<v Speaker 1>You make a good point,</v>

5921
02:41:39.181 --> 02:41:39.391
<v Speaker 1>Eddie.</v>

5922
02:41:39.391 --> 02:41:40.440
<v Speaker 1>And you know one another good point.</v>

5923
02:41:40.441 --> 02:41:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Ryan Callahan talked about for Breeshia over dooms guard and he was like none of</v>

5924
02:41:44.221 --> 02:41:46.110
<v Speaker 1>our ground and pound worked on them with King Mo,</v>

5925
02:41:46.140 --> 02:41:49.440
<v Speaker 1>who's a nasty wrestler king most like world class.</v>

5926
02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:54.680
<v Speaker 1>We need more of those films that we need honestly on a consistent basis.</v>

5927
02:41:55.090 --> 02:41:55.771
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing though,</v>

5928
02:41:55.771 --> 02:41:56.041
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>

5929
02:41:56.041 --> 02:41:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I think there's only like five guys who can do that.</v>

5930
02:41:58.110 --> 02:41:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's one of,</v>

5931
02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:01.770
<v Speaker 1>that's how high in regard I hold for us to hobby</v>

5932
02:42:03.330 --> 02:42:04.110
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

5933
02:42:04.110 --> 02:42:06.330
<v Speaker 1>He's just a real martial arts wizard.</v>

5934
02:42:07.470 --> 02:42:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Super Smart Guy.</v>

5935
02:42:09.930 --> 02:42:11.580
<v Speaker 1>You're talked to him and have conversations with them.</v>

5936
02:42:13.620 --> 02:42:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what that slide.</v>

5937
02:42:15.380 --> 02:42:16.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

5938
02:42:16.420 --> 02:42:19.350
<v Speaker 1>he honestly set the blueprint for everyone in Denver.</v>

5939
02:42:19.351 --> 02:42:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Like Shane Carwyn,</v>

5940
02:42:20.281 --> 02:42:20.821
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

5941
02:42:20.821 --> 02:42:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Nate Marquardt in the blueprint for GSP.</v>

5942
02:42:23.251 --> 02:42:25.080
<v Speaker 1>He had them do an all this different stuff.</v>

5943
02:42:25.210 --> 02:42:26.060
<v Speaker 1>A lot of genius.</v>

5944
02:42:26.450 --> 02:42:27.283
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of Shit?</v>

5945
02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Like walking on logs.</v>

5946
02:42:29.160 --> 02:42:29.461
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

5947
02:42:29.461 --> 02:42:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Does he know that shit</v>

5948
02:42:32.940 --> 02:42:34.500
<v Speaker 1>playing when I was a kid,</v>

5949
02:42:34.560 --> 02:42:34.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5950
02:42:34.891 --> 02:42:35.850
<v Speaker 1>aligning with rocks.</v>

5951
02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:37.680
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the drilling a lot.</v>

5952
02:42:37.681 --> 02:42:41.070
<v Speaker 1>He would have George drill a ton more than we would drill instead of just</v>

5953
02:42:41.071 --> 02:42:41.904
<v Speaker 1>sparring.</v>

5954
02:42:42.030 --> 02:42:45.510
<v Speaker 1>No drilling a on the pads and shit to movement started.</v>

5955
02:42:45.511 --> 02:42:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Worst case scenario where we weren't doing that,</v>

5956
02:42:47.700 --> 02:42:49.080
<v Speaker 1>he's a legit genius.</v>

5957
02:42:49.110 --> 02:42:51.540
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the biggest mistakes that people make is too much</v>

5958
02:42:51.541 --> 02:42:52.021
<v Speaker 1>sparring.</v>

5959
02:42:52.021 --> 02:42:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Even in Jujitsu,</v>

5960
02:42:52.980 --> 02:42:56.220
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to a buddy of mine who's a purple belt about this and he's like,</v>

5961
02:42:56.221 --> 02:42:59.970
<v Speaker 1>he hurt his hip and he had to get a hip replacement surgery and uh,</v>

5962
02:42:59.971 --> 02:43:00.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5963
02:43:00.241 --> 02:43:01.110
<v Speaker 1>he's like rh,</v>

5964
02:43:01.290 --> 02:43:03.510
<v Speaker 1>he's like in his late forties and he,</v>

5965
02:43:03.570 --> 02:43:07.320
<v Speaker 1>and he's a very successful businessman and he went from there to going back to</v>

5966
02:43:07.321 --> 02:43:07.920
<v Speaker 1>training again.</v>

5967
02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:09.510
<v Speaker 1>But once he healed up,</v>

5968
02:43:09.660 --> 02:43:11.470
<v Speaker 1>he's doing like drills and he's like,</v>

5969
02:43:11.471 --> 02:43:11.681
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

5970
02:43:11.681 --> 02:43:12.141

5971
02:43:12.141 --> 02:43:13.390

5972
02:43:13.420 --> 02:43:14.740
<v Speaker 1>my Jujitsu has gotten much,</v>

5973
02:43:14.741 --> 02:43:17.380
<v Speaker 1>much better because now he's constantly,</v>

5974
02:43:17.470 --> 02:43:21.170
<v Speaker 1>constantly improving upon his data patterns pattern.</v>

5975
02:43:21.180 --> 02:43:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5976
02:43:21.530 --> 02:43:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5977
02:43:21.750 --> 02:43:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Really the only pattern chunking you were talking about Henner like a good</v>

5978
02:43:25.781 --> 02:43:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Henner Gracie is like pattern chunking this whole life.</v>

5979
02:43:28.421 --> 02:43:30.370
<v Speaker 1>He just understands that way.</v>

5980
02:43:30.380 --> 02:43:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Pal boxing the patterns and mixing them all up and it shows taekwondo.</v>

5981
02:43:34.141 --> 02:43:35.950

<v Speaker 1>Or when they weighed in,</v>

5995
02:43:51.011 --> 02:43:52.090
<v Speaker 1>he was underweight the morning.</v>

5996
02:43:52.091 --> 02:43:53.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the French guy.</v>

5997
02:43:53.290 --> 02:43:54.160
<v Speaker 1>This motherfucker,</v>

5998
02:43:54.161 --> 02:43:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>

5999
02:43:54.910 --> 02:43:55.511
<v Speaker 1>What's his name?</v>

6000
02:43:55.511 --> 02:43:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Francis spins make that larger and go,</v>

6001
02:43:58.450 --> 02:43:59.283
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

02:43:59.350 --> 02:44:00.130
<v Speaker 1>no man.</v>

6003
02:44:00.130 --> 02:44:00.963
<v Speaker 1>He's a beast.</v>

6004
02:44:00.970 --> 02:44:02.500
<v Speaker 1>He's got some serious power.</v>

6005
02:44:02.570 --> 02:44:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6006
02:44:03.220 --> 02:44:04.750
<v Speaker 1>And a good defense on the ground too.</v>

6007
02:44:04.751 --> 02:44:05.850
<v Speaker 1>When he got taken down,</v>

6008
02:44:05.860 --> 02:44:07.030
<v Speaker 1>the dude didn't do shit to them.</v>

6009
02:44:07.050 --> 02:44:07.691
<v Speaker 1>You may be friends,</v>

6010
02:44:07.691 --> 02:44:08.890
<v Speaker 1>but he's west African sir.</v>

6011
02:44:08.950 --> 02:44:09.221
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

6012
02:44:09.221 --> 02:44:10.300
<v Speaker 1>for Shoah.</v>

6013
02:44:10.660 --> 02:44:12.410
<v Speaker 1>He's gigantic to stop doing that.</v>

6014
02:44:13.050 --> 02:44:13.580
<v Speaker 1>And I was,</v>

6015
02:44:13.580 --> 02:44:14.141
<v Speaker 1>I was interviewed.</v>

6020
02:44:17.981 --> 02:44:22.050
<v Speaker 1>I went to interview him and he decided he wanted to walk away and go,</v>

6021
02:44:22.051 --> 02:44:22.320

<v Speaker 1>You do your thing buddy.</v>

6027
02:44:30.910 --> 02:44:31.900
<v Speaker 1>What a man.</v>

6028
02:44:32.230 --> 02:44:33.310
<v Speaker 1>He fucked that dude up.</v>

6029
02:44:33.311 --> 02:44:34.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who the fuck you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got a tiny time.</v>

6032
02:44:35.500 --> 02:44:38.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the guy had fought and I felt like the</v>

6033
02:44:40.030 --> 02:44:42.220
<v Speaker 1>look at Joe Silva book where he comes up to these guys.</v>

6034
02:44:42.220 --> 02:44:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh my Lord.</v>

6035
02:44:44.050 --> 02:44:45.150
<v Speaker 1>But he holds their faith.</v>

6036
02:44:45.250 --> 02:44:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

6037
02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:46.690
<v Speaker 1>he holds there.</v>

6038
02:44:46.690 --> 02:44:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Joe Silva,</v>

6039
02:44:47.500 --> 02:44:48.191
<v Speaker 1>he's a great guy.</v>

6040
02:44:48.191 --> 02:44:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Just needs mushrooms in a fucking reality check by shrubs.</v>

6041
02:44:52.650 --> 02:44:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Are you reality check Brendan?</v>

6042
02:44:55.330 --> 02:44:56.163
<v Speaker 1>I think an ass whooping.</v>

6043
02:44:56.170 --> 02:44:56.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of saying,</v>

6044
02:44:56.970 --> 02:44:57.250
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

6045
02:44:57.250 --> 02:44:57.881
<v Speaker 1>how dare you.</v>

6046
02:44:57.881 --> 02:44:59.470
<v Speaker 1>It was an I like Joe Silva.</v>

6047
02:44:59.471 --> 02:45:02.470
<v Speaker 1>I have never had any ill dealings with Joe Sova.</v>

6048
02:45:02.590 --> 02:45:03.550
<v Speaker 1>He is my friend.</v>

6049
02:45:03.580 --> 02:45:05.110
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy him as a human being.</v>

6050
02:45:05.290 --> 02:45:08.620
<v Speaker 1>I do not know what the fuck went down with you and Joe Silva,</v>

6051
02:45:08.830 --> 02:45:09.663
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

6052
02:45:09.840 --> 02:45:10.600
<v Speaker 1>any fighter.</v>

6053
02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:13.280
<v Speaker 1>You bitches need to work that shit out on your own bad.</v>

6054
02:45:13.281 --> 02:45:13.431
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6055
02:45:13.431 --> 02:45:13.811
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

6056
02:45:13.811 --> 02:45:14.644
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

6057
02:45:15.930 --> 02:45:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Up In another dimension.</v>

6058
02:45:19.390 --> 02:45:22.510
<v Speaker 1>You decide to come back and get a fucking do it and you got to come back one</v>

6059
02:45:22.511 --> 02:45:22.841
<v Speaker 1>more time.</v>

6060
02:45:22.841 --> 02:45:23.650
<v Speaker 1>You're going to make a comeback.</v>

6061
02:45:23.650 --> 02:45:26.740
<v Speaker 1>What camp do you join and what is your strategy?</v>

6062
02:45:27.820 --> 02:45:30.130
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to turn down muscle farm with least her bowling right now,</v>

6063
02:45:30.131 --> 02:45:31.300
<v Speaker 1>but I'd probably go tristar.</v>

6064
02:45:32.900 --> 02:45:34.600
<v Speaker 1>I like muscle farm for a couple of reasons.</v>

6065
02:45:34.601 --> 02:45:34.961
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>

6066
02:45:34.961 --> 02:45:36.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a big new facility.</v>

6067
02:45:36.551 --> 02:45:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Everything's super state of the art and it's got some momentum.</v>

6068
02:45:39.611 --> 02:45:43.480
<v Speaker 1>A lot of dudes are gravitating towards their leaster Elliot Marshall,</v>

6069
02:45:43.570 --> 02:45:43.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6070
02:45:43.901 --> 02:45:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Duane Ludwig is in cahoots.</v>

6071
02:45:46.150 --> 02:45:46.391
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6072
02:45:46.391 --> 02:45:48.580
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of other really good striking coaches.</v>

6073
02:45:48.581 --> 02:45:50.020
<v Speaker 1>You've got Brandon Thatch,</v>

6074
02:45:50.050 --> 02:45:52.640
<v Speaker 1>you've got his click way to there now and the way it's happening,</v>

6075
02:45:54.680 --> 02:45:56.060
<v Speaker 1>it's happening right?</v>

6076
02:45:57.130 --> 02:45:58.720
<v Speaker 1>The guy who's running it now,</v>

6077
02:45:58.930 --> 02:46:00.800
<v Speaker 1>he's a student of mine and he,</v>

6078
02:46:00.900 --> 02:46:02.710
<v Speaker 1>he always wanted to,</v>

6079
02:46:03.130 --> 02:46:04.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6080
02:46:04.090 --> 02:46:06.520
<v Speaker 1>he was very successful in the supplement industry,</v>

6081
02:46:06.521 --> 02:46:06.941
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

6082
02:46:06.941 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 1>very successful and his passion was to build an</v>

6083
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:11.670
<v Speaker 4>MMA two years ago,</v>

6084
02:46:11.720 --> 02:46:12.291
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

6085
02:46:12.291 --> 02:46:12.801
<v Speaker 4>Here you go.</v>

6086
02:46:12.801 --> 02:46:13.131
<v Speaker 4>Here we go.</v>

6087
02:46:13.131 --> 02:46:13.964
<v Speaker 4>We got involved.</v>

6088
02:46:14.370 --> 02:46:18.200
<v Speaker 4>We had a fight with Danny Sanchez and quite who ate it was the craziest part of</v>

6089
02:46:18.201 --> 02:46:18.551
<v Speaker 4>her plan.</v>

6090
02:46:18.551 --> 02:46:19.030
<v Speaker 4>Drinks,</v>

6091
02:46:19.030 --> 02:46:22.310
<v Speaker 4>Hendricks and Thompson is about to start and we got to pay attention to this</v>

6092
02:46:22.770 --> 02:46:23.300
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

6093
02:46:23.300 --> 02:46:24.260
<v Speaker 4>This should support first of all,</v>

6094
02:46:24.261 --> 02:46:24.680
<v Speaker 4>Hendricks.</v>

6095
02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:25.130
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

6096
02:46:25.130 --> 02:46:26.090
<v Speaker 4>Any predictions?</v>

6097
02:46:26.300 --> 02:46:27.440
<v Speaker 4>Hendricks was fantastic.</v>

6098
02:46:28.790 --> 02:46:31.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how if one of always got to solve that wrestling,</v>

6099
02:46:31.061 --> 02:46:32.330
<v Speaker 4>but he never looked like that.</v>

6100
02:46:32.360 --> 02:46:33.260
<v Speaker 4>He looks so fit.</v>

6101
02:46:33.290 --> 02:46:34.460
<v Speaker 4>He's got to solve that wrestling.</v>

6102
02:46:34.490 --> 02:46:34.581
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

6103
02:46:34.581 --> 02:46:36.380
<v Speaker 4>he fucked up in the Tyron Woodley fight.</v>

6104
02:46:36.381 --> 02:46:36.981
<v Speaker 4>He didn't make weight.</v>

6105
02:46:36.981 --> 02:46:38.630
<v Speaker 4>Look at this fucking side stance.</v>

6106
02:46:39.060 --> 02:46:40.970
<v Speaker 4>Stance show unusual.</v>

6107
02:46:40.971 --> 02:46:41.804
<v Speaker 4>So epic,</v>

6108
02:46:41.930 --> 02:46:46.520
<v Speaker 4>and here's the thing about Stephen Thompson is that he's been training a lot.</v>

6109
02:46:48.170 --> 02:46:51.750
<v Speaker 4>Wrestling has gotten a lot better and he's not worried about being taken down.</v>

6110
02:46:52.130 --> 02:46:54.410
<v Speaker 4>He'll get taken down by Johnny Brian Hall.</v>

6111
02:46:54.440 --> 02:46:55.520
<v Speaker 4>He might get taken down,</v>

6112
02:46:55.550 --> 02:47:00.300
<v Speaker 4>but they might not with the right hand caught Ncaa Chana.</v>

6113
02:47:00.300 --> 02:47:01.100
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to deal with it.</v>

6114
02:47:01.100 --> 02:47:01.611
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

6115
02:47:01.611 --> 02:47:02.301
<v Speaker 4>It is hard to deal with.</v>

6116
02:47:02.301 --> 02:47:05.270
<v Speaker 4>You know what else had to deal with 57 and o and kickboxing.</v>

6117
02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:06.770
<v Speaker 4>It's super hard to deal with.</v>

6118
02:47:06.771 --> 02:47:07.041
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

6119
02:47:07.041 --> 02:47:07.281
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>

6120
02:47:07.281 --> 02:47:08.530
<v Speaker 4>I tried to Johnny's wrestling.</v>

6121
02:47:08.531 --> 02:47:09.670
<v Speaker 4>I tried hard Johnny's wrestling.</v>

6122
02:47:09.740 --> 02:47:10.573
<v Speaker 4>So tough</v>

6123
02:47:13.370 --> 02:47:14.203
<v Speaker 4>watching it.</v>

6124
02:47:14.210 --> 02:47:15.260
<v Speaker 4>Let's just watch it.</v>

6125
02:47:15.310 --> 02:47:15.590
<v Speaker 4>We were,</v>

6126
02:47:15.590 --> 02:47:17.030
<v Speaker 4>I know what the fuck is going to happen.</v>

6127
02:47:17.100 --> 02:47:17.933
<v Speaker 4>Talk.</v>

6128
02:47:18.170 --> 02:47:19.080
<v Speaker 4>You might be right,</v>

6129
02:47:19.370 --> 02:47:19.701
<v Speaker 4>but you're,</v>

6130
02:47:19.701 --> 02:47:19.971
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

6131
02:47:19.971 --> 02:47:22.460
<v Speaker 4>you're saying what's definitely going to happen while it's happening.</v>

6132
02:47:22.490 --> 02:47:24.000
<v Speaker 4>That seems really ridiculous.</v>

6133
02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:25.010
<v Speaker 4>Same probability.</v>

6134
02:47:25.011 --> 02:47:25.431
<v Speaker 4>The rest.</v>

6135
02:47:25.431 --> 02:47:26.264
<v Speaker 4>That's how I sound.</v>

6136
02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:27.650
<v Speaker 4>I sound like a wizard.</v>

6137
02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:29.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm a little psychic dude.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I see things.</v>

6139
02:47:31.071 --> 02:47:31.641
<v Speaker 4>I see things.</v>

6140
02:47:31.641 --> 02:47:32.061
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

6141
02:47:32.061 --> 02:47:33.020
<v Speaker 4>One second before that happened.</v>

6142
02:47:33.170 --> 02:47:35.180
<v Speaker 4>This is the worst kind of commentary everyone was saying.</v>

6143
02:47:35.450 --> 02:47:37.390
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if we did commentary like this sale.</v>

6144
02:47:37.430 --> 02:47:40.730
<v Speaker 4>Worse going to have different shit is happening.</v>

02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:56.610
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

6152
02:47:56.670 --> 02:47:58.190
<v Speaker 4>to the face to telling you.</v>

6153
02:47:58.460 --> 02:48:01.430
<v Speaker 4>There's very few guys that could avoid the take down like him and have these</v>

6154
02:48:01.431 --> 02:48:02.264
<v Speaker 4>kinds of skills.</v>

6155
02:48:02.300 --> 02:48:04.270
<v Speaker 4>It's a completely different kind of leg dexterity.</v>

6156
02:48:04.590 --> 02:48:05.690
<v Speaker 4>Nasty dude.</v>

6157
02:48:05.691 --> 02:48:07.310
<v Speaker 4>He used to fight in that Chuck Norris.</v>

6158
02:48:07.530 --> 02:48:08.363
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

6159
02:48:08.690 --> 02:48:10.160
<v Speaker 4>Johnny Hendricks is in a world.</v>

6160
02:48:11.330 --> 02:48:12.470
<v Speaker 4>He's getting lit up.</v>

6161
02:48:12.620 --> 02:48:16.100
<v Speaker 4>He's getting lit up like Thomas Tryna do some shit that Hendricks has not seen</v>

6162
02:48:16.101 --> 02:48:16.910
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

6163
02:48:16.910 --> 02:48:17.960
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to get a sprite.</v>

6164
02:48:18.170 --> 02:48:19.230
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to get a sparring partner.</v>

6165
02:48:19.240 --> 02:48:21.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to find a guy like him now.</v>

6166
02:48:23.950 --> 02:48:28.040
<v Speaker 4>He is one of the elites in American kickboxing freak.</v>

6167
02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:28.671
<v Speaker 4>Look at him,</v>

6168
02:48:28.671 --> 02:48:29.240
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:30.650
<v Speaker 4>He fights like a snake.</v>

6170
02:48:30.710 --> 02:48:31.461
<v Speaker 4>Oh sure.</v>

6171
02:48:31.461 --> 02:48:33.080
<v Speaker 4>To deal with so much taller,</v>

6172
02:48:33.380 --> 02:48:33.950
<v Speaker 4>tall.</v>

6173
02:48:33.950 --> 02:48:35.690
<v Speaker 4>It's not looking so much taller.</v>

6174
02:48:36.480 --> 02:48:37.880
<v Speaker 4>It depends on who you're looking for.</v>

6175
02:48:37.881 --> 02:48:38.691
<v Speaker 4>If you look at for Thompson,</v>

6176
02:48:38.691 --> 02:48:39.620
<v Speaker 4>it's looking excellent.</v>

6177
02:48:39.740 --> 02:48:39.891
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6178
02:48:39.891 --> 02:48:40.724
<v Speaker 4>It's looking great.</v>

6179
02:48:41.700 --> 02:48:45.320
<v Speaker 4>Hundreds is isn't a bad situation.</v>

6180
02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:48.110
<v Speaker 4>Just trying to throw that kick and he's getting caught.</v>

6181
02:48:48.110 --> 02:48:48.890
<v Speaker 4>He's getting timed.</v>

6182
02:48:48.890 --> 02:48:50.270
<v Speaker 4>He's in a terrible situation.</v>

6183
02:48:50.271 --> 02:48:50.601
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>

6184
02:48:50.601 --> 02:48:51.860
<v Speaker 4>Rhonda Rousey Hall.</v>

6185
02:48:51.861 --> 02:48:52.671
<v Speaker 4>Look at the switch,</v>

6186
02:48:52.671 --> 02:48:53.960
<v Speaker 4>kick jumping,</v>

6187
02:48:53.961 --> 02:48:54.381
<v Speaker 4>switch,</v>

6188
02:48:54.381 --> 02:48:56.300
<v Speaker 4>kick jumps with the left and kicks with the right,</v>

6189
02:48:56.360 --> 02:48:57.410
<v Speaker 4>right hand on the chin.</v>

6190
02:48:57.440 --> 02:49:00.870
<v Speaker 4>God Dog to lighten them up and no,</v>

6191
02:49:00.950 --> 02:49:01.783
<v Speaker 4>no relented.</v>

6192
02:49:01.790 --> 02:49:02.840
<v Speaker 4>How tough is Johnny Hendricks?</v>

6193
02:49:02.841 --> 02:49:03.950
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't even look like he's getting hurt.</v>

6194
02:49:04.010 --> 02:49:05.150
<v Speaker 4>He just keeps coming forward.</v>

6195
02:49:05.151 --> 02:49:05.361
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

6196
02:49:05.361 --> 02:49:09.540
<v Speaker 4>one wonder boy comes out to do this to everybody.</v>

6197
02:49:09.541 --> 02:49:10.290
<v Speaker 4>How about that?</v>

6198
02:49:10.290 --> 02:49:11.970
<v Speaker 4>I've said that for a long time.</v>

6199
02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:13.290
<v Speaker 4>I think he beats Robbie Lawler.</v>

6200
02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:14.041
<v Speaker 4>I'll call it now.</v>

6201
02:49:14.041 --> 02:49:19.041
<v Speaker 4>He's learning how to fucking fight MMA the same at the same level that he</v>

6202
02:49:19.771 --> 02:49:21.570
<v Speaker 4>learned to be this elite kickboxer.</v>

6203
02:49:22.080 --> 02:49:23.610
<v Speaker 4>Did I wash them in that Chuck Norris thing?</v>

6204
02:49:23.730 --> 02:49:26.490
<v Speaker 4>Remember the World Combat League with graphite and that bowl?</v>

6205
02:49:26.520 --> 02:49:27.353
<v Speaker 4>He was</v>

6206
02:49:30.110 --> 02:49:30.943
<v Speaker 4>honest,</v>

6207
02:49:30.980 --> 02:49:31.270
<v Speaker 4>tough.</v>

6208
02:49:31.270 --> 02:49:33.240
<v Speaker 4>He thought I was a fan of that.</v>

6209
02:49:33.241 --> 02:49:34.260
<v Speaker 4>Chuck Norris kickbox.</v>

6210
02:49:34.270 --> 02:49:35.103
<v Speaker 4>He was the champion</v>

02:49:38.820 --> 02:49:40.110
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the best guys in it.</v>

6215
02:49:40.200 --> 02:49:41.100
<v Speaker 4>Johnny's covering.</v>

6221
02:49:54.391 --> 02:49:55.350

6222
02:49:55.620 --> 02:49:57.250
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>

6231
02:50:09.690 --> 02:50:10.201

6232
02:50:10.201 --> 02:50:11.920
<v Speaker 4>he's doing the karate kid who he's married to.</v>

6233
02:50:11.940 --> 02:50:12.773
<v Speaker 4>We try to kid.</v>

6234
02:50:16.390 --> 02:50:17.340
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

6235
02:50:17.370 --> 02:50:18.330
<v Speaker 4>He double got me.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Here's his movement.</v>

6243
02:50:30.481 --> 02:50:31.314
<v Speaker 4>His karate,</v>

6244
02:50:31.380 --> 02:50:33.250
<v Speaker 4>he has minimal footwork.</v>

6245
02:50:33.270 --> 02:50:35.220
<v Speaker 4>Movement is just like doing all those movements.</v>

6246
02:50:35.221 --> 02:50:37.420
<v Speaker 4>Drills with karate and you see the way he does hips.</v>

6247
02:50:37.620 --> 02:50:38.600
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee McGregor.</v>

6248
02:50:38.610 --> 02:50:40.270
<v Speaker 4>We'll never say the 70 pound belt.</v>

6249
02:50:40.271 --> 02:50:40.911
<v Speaker 4>This is looking good to me.</v>

6250
02:50:40.911 --> 02:50:41.700
<v Speaker 4>I'll never say that.</v>

6251
02:50:41.700 --> 02:50:43.210
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to fight this guy</v>

6252
02:50:45.660 --> 02:50:47.070
<v Speaker 4>being precision.</v>

6253
02:50:47.340 --> 02:50:48.670
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>

6254
02:50:49.680 --> 02:50:50.640
<v Speaker 4>Appreciation though.</v>

6255
02:50:50.641 --> 02:50:52.690
<v Speaker 4>The precision knew it.</v>

6256
02:50:52.980 --> 02:50:53.813
<v Speaker 4>Bam,</v>

6257
02:50:55.140 --> 02:50:55.441
<v Speaker 4>Bam,</v>

6258
02:50:55.441 --> 02:50:56.580
<v Speaker 4>Bam or Johnny Man,</v>

6259
02:50:56.600 --> 02:50:58.340
<v Speaker 4>this the difference in the giant.</v>

6260
02:50:59.070 --> 02:51:00.090
<v Speaker 4>He nodded at him,</v>

6261
02:51:00.091 --> 02:51:00.331
<v Speaker 4>look at it.</v>

6262
02:51:00.331 --> 02:51:00.601
<v Speaker 4>It's no.</v>

6263
02:51:00.601 --> 02:51:01.291
<v Speaker 4>He nods at them.</v>

6264
02:51:01.291 --> 02:51:01.561
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

6265
02:51:01.561 --> 02:51:01.830
<v Speaker 4>Yup,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you got blue dude.</v>

6267
02:51:02.941 --> 02:51:06.630
<v Speaker 4>He got lit up or take him down.</v>

6268
02:51:06.660 --> 02:51:07.710
<v Speaker 4>He couldn't get taken.</v>

6269
02:51:07.711 --> 02:51:11.760
<v Speaker 4>This is the former champion who's gone through the best camp of his life.</v>

6270
02:51:11.850 --> 02:51:13.650
<v Speaker 4>He's in the best shape he's ever been.</v>

6271
02:51:13.830 --> 02:51:14.491
<v Speaker 4>He comes in,</v>

6272
02:51:14.491 --> 02:51:16.890
<v Speaker 4>they're motivated and he gets torn apart.</v>

6273
02:51:17.620 --> 02:51:21.750
<v Speaker 4>Title shot apart by a gene has to be a title shot.</v>

6274
02:51:21.880 --> 02:51:23.260
<v Speaker 4>We were witnessing this,</v>

6275
02:51:23.310 --> 02:51:24.160
<v Speaker 4>those separately.</v>

6276
02:51:24.400 --> 02:51:25.710
<v Speaker 4>Fuck of evolution.</v>

6277
02:51:25.711 --> 02:51:26.101
<v Speaker 4>First of us,</v>

6278
02:51:26.101 --> 02:51:26.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm a cheetah,</v>

6279
02:51:26.910 --> 02:51:28.140
<v Speaker 4>but we needed another one.</v>

6280
02:51:28.320 --> 02:51:29.340
<v Speaker 4>We needed another one.</v>

6281
02:51:29.341 --> 02:51:30.061
<v Speaker 4>Machida was like,</v>

6282
02:51:30.061 --> 02:51:30.391
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

6283
02:51:30.391 --> 02:51:31.171
<v Speaker 4>it's a special one.</v>

6284
02:51:31.171 --> 02:51:34.980
<v Speaker 4>It's still not karate now we see it for sure.</v>

6285
02:51:35.160 --> 02:51:35.671
<v Speaker 4>The way,</v>

6286
02:51:35.671 --> 02:51:36.504
<v Speaker 4>listen</v>

6287
02:51:38.730 --> 02:51:39.031
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>

6288
02:51:39.031 --> 02:51:39.870
<v Speaker 4>this is one round.</v>

6289
02:51:39.871 --> 02:51:42.240
<v Speaker 4>You can do Woodley in him for the fucking title.</v>

6290
02:51:42.400 --> 02:51:43.260
<v Speaker 4>Hip Robbie Lawler.</v>

6291
02:51:43.261 --> 02:51:46.830
<v Speaker 4>A little bit of a break man through a war with Carlos candidate karate.</v>

6292
02:51:48.090 --> 02:51:53.090
<v Speaker 4>Karate is are those toxin Tom Lawler come on.</v>

6293
02:51:53.491 --> 02:51:53.731
<v Speaker 4>So on.</v>

6294
02:51:53.731 --> 02:51:55.200
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't you want to see him?</v>

6295
02:51:56.820 --> 02:51:58.020
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what I'm saying.</v>

6296
02:51:58.080 --> 02:51:59.850
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to take Woodley's title shot away.</v>

6297
02:51:59.851 --> 02:52:00.684
<v Speaker 4>It's very hard.</v>

6298
02:52:01.390 --> 02:52:02.220
<v Speaker 4>Yossi roles.</v>

6299
02:52:02.220 --> 02:52:03.053
<v Speaker 4>I do,</v>

6300
02:52:03.060 --> 02:52:06.040
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying six in a row in a sense of fairness.</v>

6301
02:52:06.040 --> 02:52:07.270
<v Speaker 1>If we want to get a sense of fairness,</v>

6302
02:52:07.390 --> 02:52:08.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a very difficult,</v>

6303
02:52:08.650 --> 02:52:10.060
<v Speaker 1>he's going to out strike everybody,</v>

6304
02:52:10.090 --> 02:52:10.870
<v Speaker 1>but how would you,</v>

6305
02:52:10.870 --> 02:52:12.580
<v Speaker 1>how much would you like to see him versus Damien?</v>

6306
02:52:12.600 --> 02:52:13.433
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

6307
02:52:13.790 --> 02:52:13.860
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

6308
02:52:13.860 --> 02:52:15.690
<v Speaker 4>he's going to strike everybody.</v>

6309
02:52:15.860 --> 02:52:17.510
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to see him fight.</v>

6310
02:52:17.520 --> 02:52:18.750
<v Speaker 4>Can't take him down.</v>

6311
02:52:18.780 --> 02:52:19.613
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

6312
02:52:20.990 --> 02:52:22.690
<v Speaker 4>wonder if he kicks Damien.</v>

6313
02:52:22.740 --> 02:52:23.573
<v Speaker 4>My</v>

6314
02:52:26.850 --> 02:52:28.400
<v Speaker 4>conduit would be fine.</v>

6315
02:52:28.940 --> 02:52:29.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6316
02:52:29.310 --> 02:52:30.570
<v Speaker 1>I've been predicting the rise,</v>

6317
02:52:30.571 --> 02:52:31.750
<v Speaker 1>the Wonderboy for awhile.</v>

6318
02:52:31.790 --> 02:52:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Karate had won that fight.</v>

6319
02:52:33.380 --> 02:52:34.370
<v Speaker 1>That's all one bad fight.</v>

6320
02:52:34.371 --> 02:52:34.491
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

6321
02:52:34.491 --> 02:52:37.640
<v Speaker 1>he's over two years ago he was overtrained against Matt Brown Brown and since</v>

6322
02:52:37.641 --> 02:52:39.770
<v Speaker 1>then he's been dominant and getting better every time.</v>

6323
02:52:39.771 --> 02:52:40.820
<v Speaker 1>And he was smart.</v>

6324
02:52:40.970 --> 02:52:44.990
<v Speaker 1>He's a one second that he goes and trains the 185 pound champion is one of the</v>

6325
02:52:44.991 --> 02:52:46.610
<v Speaker 1>grittiest fucking wrestlers in the game.</v>

6326
02:52:46.611 --> 02:52:47.960
<v Speaker 1>He goes for Weidman's camp.</v>

6327
02:52:48.020 --> 02:52:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Weidman's a bigger guy and he learns how to survive.</v>

6328
02:52:50.750 --> 02:52:50.901
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Two that we might be looking at the champion right there.</v>

6572
02:58:40.110 --> 02:58:44.910
<v Speaker 1>We really must have been saying what Robbie Lawler's Goddamn ferocious.</v>

6573
02:58:44.911 --> 02:58:46.050
<v Speaker 1>That mother fucker knocked out</v>

6574
02:58:47.660 --> 02:58:49.770
<v Speaker 1>knocked dot Melvin malleable matchup for Robbie.</v>

6575
02:58:49.860 --> 02:58:51.240
<v Speaker 1>You might be right,</v>

6576
02:58:51.390 --> 02:58:54.150
<v Speaker 1>but Johnny Hodges to the worst matchup you might be right.</v>

6577
02:58:54.180 --> 02:58:54.871
<v Speaker 1>But there are,</v>

6578
02:58:54.871 --> 02:58:58.140
<v Speaker 1>I believe there's a difference in the amount of danger that Robbie Lawler we'll</v>

6579
02:58:58.141 --> 02:59:00.870
<v Speaker 1>put himself in versus the amount of danger that Johnny [inaudible].</v>

6580
02:59:01.320 --> 02:59:02.153
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

6581
02:59:02.260 --> 02:59:06.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying the amount of danger he'll put himself in trying to hit him.</v>

6582
02:59:06.720 --> 02:59:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Robbie Lawler would take some crazy ass fucking chances and do some explosive,</v>

6583
02:59:10.980 --> 02:59:12.980
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously aggressive shit.</v>

6584
02:59:12.981 --> 02:59:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Luck.</v>

6585
02:59:13.320 --> 02:59:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Even as a champion,</v>

6586
02:59:14.550 --> 02:59:15.780
<v Speaker 1>he might not land it,</v>

6587
02:59:15.781 --> 02:59:16.231
<v Speaker 1>but dude,</v>

6588
02:59:16.231 --> 02:59:18.630
<v Speaker 1>he knocked Melvin man who have dead.</v>

6589
02:59:18.631 --> 02:59:19.201
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

6590
02:59:19.201 --> 02:59:22.790
<v Speaker 1>He's so indestructable we're man Hook was 10 off on you.</v>

6591
02:59:22.830 --> 02:59:24.330
<v Speaker 1>You treat them like a reaction,</v>

6592
02:59:24.730 --> 02:59:26.910
<v Speaker 1>like a geode just kicking his leg.</v>

6593
02:59:26.920 --> 02:59:28.620
<v Speaker 1>His leg looked like it was like a like on a,</v>

6594
02:59:28.621 --> 02:59:29.760
<v Speaker 1>on a string like war.</v>

6595
02:59:29.950 --> 02:59:31.120
<v Speaker 1>And then he just talked to his head.</v>

6596
02:59:31.450 --> 02:59:33.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll give Wonderboy the title shot.</v>

6597
02:59:33.090 --> 02:59:34.170
<v Speaker 1>Well I believe so.</v>

6598
02:59:34.200 --> 02:59:34.831
<v Speaker 1>I believe so,</v>

6599
02:59:34.831 --> 02:59:35.201
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

6600
02:59:35.201 --> 02:59:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

6601
02:59:35.460 --> 02:59:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I think the Tyron Woodley still has a real good argument that he deserves the</v>

6602
02:59:38.781 --> 02:59:42.420
<v Speaker 1>title shot even though he's not as impressive as this guy because his last fight</v>

6603
02:59:42.421 --> 02:59:43.470
<v Speaker 1>he won by injury.</v>

6604
02:59:43.770 --> 02:59:44.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6605
02:59:44.550 --> 02:59:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Carlos condit kicked fucked up as me.</v>

6606
02:59:46.640 --> 02:59:47.600
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

6607
02:59:47.790 --> 02:59:48.930
<v Speaker 1>he was winning that fight though.</v>

6608
02:59:48.960 --> 02:59:50.160
<v Speaker 1>He definitely wanted the first graph.</v>

6609
02:59:50.310 --> 02:59:51.360
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough argument,</v>

6610
02:59:51.361 --> 02:59:54.660
<v Speaker 1>especially as far as mark and bill saying that he was supposed to be fighting</v>

6611
02:59:54.661 --> 02:59:56.610
<v Speaker 1>Johny Hendricks number one title shot.</v>

6612
02:59:56.611 --> 02:59:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Hendricks had to pull out because he didn't make weight and essentially</v>

6613
02:59:59.341 --> 03:00:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Tyron was promised the title shot.</v>

6614
03:00:01.640 --> 03:00:03.260
<v Speaker 1>You know how the PFC rose thing?</v>

6615
03:00:03.360 --> 03:00:07.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a bad thing if Wonderboy weights out and knock somebody else</v>

6616
03:00:07.621 --> 03:00:10.890
<v Speaker 1>off because I'm telling you my performance like this,</v>

6617
03:00:10.891 --> 03:00:14.790
<v Speaker 1>a performance like this is like some superstar emerging shit.</v>

6618
03:00:15.180 --> 03:00:15.451
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

6619
03:00:15.451 --> 03:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>He looked like a genius tonight.</v>

6620
03:00:17.490 --> 03:00:18.660
<v Speaker 1>A striking genius.</v>

6621
03:00:18.810 --> 03:00:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Look at that spinning back kick to the arm.</v>

6622
03:00:21.060 --> 03:00:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like getting hit by a fucking bat in your arms.</v>

6623
03:00:24.090 --> 03:00:25.320
<v Speaker 1>He's kicking him in the arms.</v>

6624
03:00:25.470 --> 03:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Hendricks was like,</v>

6625
03:00:26.401 --> 03:00:27.310
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

6626
03:00:27.320 --> 03:00:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Getting hit by a machine.</v>

6627
03:00:28.580 --> 03:00:29.413
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

6628
03:00:30.810 --> 03:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>everything he's doing is perfect example.</v>

6629
03:00:33.980 --> 03:00:37.170
<v Speaker 1>This is a direct example of what we were talking about when we were going over</v>

6630
03:00:37.171 --> 03:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>the technique of the kick.</v>

6631
03:00:38.360 --> 03:00:39.091
<v Speaker 1>He throws everything,</v>

6632
03:00:39.091 --> 03:00:40.290
<v Speaker 1>he slides into it,</v>

6633
03:00:40.440 --> 03:00:41.880
<v Speaker 1>he turns his hip over,</v>

6634
03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:44.100
<v Speaker 1>he turns his hip over and he throws punches.</v>

6635
03:00:44.340 --> 03:00:46.650
<v Speaker 1>He's laser beam accurate man,</v>

6636
03:00:46.651 --> 03:00:50.130
<v Speaker 1>like he's on a wire and sees what you're doing before you do it right.</v>

6637
03:00:50.370 --> 03:00:51.330
<v Speaker 1>See all you're going to throw it,</v>

6638
03:00:51.331 --> 03:00:52.110
<v Speaker 1>write it,</v>

6639
03:00:52.110 --> 03:00:52.770
<v Speaker 1>and let me just,</v>

6640
03:00:52.770 --> 03:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>let me just move a little bit back.</v>

6641
03:00:53.941 --> 03:00:55.110
<v Speaker 1>But by the way,</v>

6642
03:00:55.111 --> 03:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>he landed that right kick to the body.</v>

6643
03:00:56.881 --> 03:01:00.310
<v Speaker 1>They're white kick to the body and that exchange before it was extraordinary</v>

6644
03:01:00.310 --> 03:01:01.180
<v Speaker 3>because he's,</v>

6645
03:01:01.390 --> 03:01:02.740
<v Speaker 3>he knows he's on the way out,</v>

6646
03:01:02.741 --> 03:01:06.190
<v Speaker 3>but he also knows where Hendricks left arm is and he sneaks that right kick</v>

6647
03:01:06.191 --> 03:01:08.860
<v Speaker 3>right under it as he was sliding backwards,</v>

6648
03:01:08.920 --> 03:01:11.020
<v Speaker 3>which very few people are going to be able to do crazy.</v>

6649
03:01:11.021 --> 03:01:12.540
<v Speaker 3>You know the crazy guy took my fighting more.</v>

6650
03:01:12.550 --> 03:01:14.680
<v Speaker 3>So what you do in martial arts,</v>

6651
03:01:14.860 --> 03:01:15.280
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

6652
03:01:15.280 --> 03:01:16.091
<v Speaker 3>like I said before,</v>

6653
03:01:16.091 --> 03:01:18.370
<v Speaker 3>we all have a certain amount of time to drill,</v>

6654
03:01:18.640 --> 03:01:19.360
<v Speaker 3>so whatever.</v>

6655
03:01:19.360 --> 03:01:21.580
<v Speaker 3>What ever the cold food,</v>

6656
03:01:21.581 --> 03:01:22.900
<v Speaker 3>the karate guys,</v>

6657
03:01:23.290 --> 03:01:26.890
<v Speaker 3>whatever they were doing during the dark ages when we thought it didn't work,</v>

6658
03:01:27.190 --> 03:01:28.330
<v Speaker 3>whatever they were doing,</v>

6659
03:01:28.331 --> 03:01:30.100
<v Speaker 3>they were getting really good at it,</v>

6660
03:01:30.370 --> 03:01:33.430
<v Speaker 3>at that range and getting fucking the best at that range.</v>

6661
03:01:33.610 --> 03:01:36.040
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they can get taken down easily.</v>

6662
03:01:36.220 --> 03:01:38.110
<v Speaker 3>Maybe though they don't know any Jujitsu.</v>

6663
03:01:38.380 --> 03:01:42.970
<v Speaker 3>But now we gotten to the point where they spent all that time in that range and</v>

6664
03:01:42.971 --> 03:01:46.930
<v Speaker 3>now they added in supplement a wrestling so they can stay in that range.</v>

6665
03:01:47.110 --> 03:01:48.640
<v Speaker 3>The range that they rule,</v>

6666
03:01:48.760 --> 03:01:52.500
<v Speaker 3>the range that they spent all their time and the range that nobody else spent</v>

6667
03:01:52.501 --> 03:01:53.560
<v Speaker 3>that much time on that ranch.</v>

6668
03:01:53.740 --> 03:01:55.930
<v Speaker 3>But they got the wrestling and the surroundings,</v>

6669
03:01:56.110 --> 03:02:00.250
<v Speaker 3>they can stay in that range that they rule in during the dark ages when everyone</v>

6670
03:02:00.251 --> 03:02:01.150
<v Speaker 3>thought that didn't work,</v>

6671
03:02:01.220 --> 03:02:01.571
<v Speaker 3>but hey,</v>

6672
03:02:01.571 --> 03:02:02.320
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>

6673
03:02:02.320 --> 03:02:03.700
<v Speaker 3>Now we're the fucking works.</v>

6674
03:02:03.880 --> 03:02:05.080
<v Speaker 3>Cause I got all that shit.</v>

6675
03:02:05.720 --> 03:02:06.553
<v Speaker 4>I love heavy.</v>

6676
03:02:09.030 --> 03:02:11.930
<v Speaker 4>We just saw karate when he talks.</v>

6677
03:02:11.931 --> 03:02:12.764
<v Speaker 4>He talks.</v>

6678
03:02:13.290 --> 03:02:13.591
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

6679
03:02:13.591 --> 03:02:13.780
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

6680
03:02:13.780 --> 03:02:15.420
<v Speaker 4>we have to end this podcast on that.</v>

6681
03:02:15.421 --> 03:02:16.254
<v Speaker 4>Cause we have</v>

6682
03:02:17.760 --> 03:02:18.550
<v Speaker 4>mark,</v>

6683
03:02:18.550 --> 03:02:19.500
<v Speaker 4>we're at the three hour mark.</v>

6684
03:02:19.510 --> 03:02:19.700
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

6685
03:02:19.700 --> 03:02:20.670
<v Speaker 4>we did we go over yet?</v>

6686
03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:21.361
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

6687
03:02:21.361 --> 03:02:21.921
<v Speaker 4>we have swapped,</v>

6688
03:02:21.921 --> 03:02:23.160
<v Speaker 4>slightly went over three hours.</v>

6689
03:02:23.161 --> 03:02:24.400
<v Speaker 4>So most of this has gone good.</v>

6690
03:02:24.401 --> 03:02:25.740
<v Speaker 4>I'd everybody good long,</v>

6691
03:02:25.800 --> 03:02:26.633
<v Speaker 4>big kiss.</v>

6692
03:02:27.060 --> 03:02:27.330
<v Speaker 4>Eddie,</v>

6693
03:02:27.330 --> 03:02:28.530
<v Speaker 4>you're grabbing me ramble.</v>

6694
03:02:28.590 --> 03:02:28.801
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

6695
03:02:28.801 --> 03:02:29.251
<v Speaker 4>you're great.</v>

6696
03:02:29.251 --> 03:02:32.040
<v Speaker 4>Could you go when it gets dark.</v>
