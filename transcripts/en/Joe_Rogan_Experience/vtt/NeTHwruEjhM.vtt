<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

20
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was out of line.</v>

<v Speaker 2>so a welcome and a house Colin's last </v>

<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

23
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

24
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always describe it.</v>

25
00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:42.031
<v Speaker 2>It's not big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just got this little narrow slice </v>

26
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:42.031
<v Speaker 2>of the Internet and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's attracted,</v>

27
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>videos do 20,</v>

28
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:42.750
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40,</v>

29
00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Speaker 2>50,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>views and I have a good spot.</v>

30
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.760
<v Speaker 2>That's a good place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy with it.</v>

31
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

32
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.750
<v Speaker 2>I have like 4,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>people on Patriot and supporting me and </v>

33
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't serve ads on anything I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just trying to make it organic </v>

34
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 2>and see how far I can take it and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>go from there.</v>

35
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris says his entire podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That way he doesn't have any ads,</v>

36
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.490
<v Speaker 2>which uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's amazing.</v>

37
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cool.</v>

38
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:03.860
<v Speaker 2>Like I have no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

39
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked at ign for a long time,</v>

40
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 2>the video game site and my old company </v>
<v Speaker 2>so we had ads and I have no problem with</v>

41
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:12.350
<v Speaker 2>them but I was trying to just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>say like,</v>

42
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't need more than what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>giving me.</v>

43
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:16.760
<v Speaker 2>This is Brittany and I'm doing fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

44
00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'll do ads on future products but</v>

45
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:21.170
<v Speaker 2>not with us dot well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

46
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean why not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

47
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean just if you're enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

48
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

49
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:26.640
<v Speaker 2>Do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could do different products,</v>

50
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 2>you could do different projects whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do it different ways.</v>

51
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.610
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

52
00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:31.120
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

53
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.140
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting now to try to figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out like what's the best way for people </v>

54
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.680
<v Speaker 2>to put their stuff out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I know a lot of people,</v>

55
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.140
<v Speaker 2>like in the podcast world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people use soundcloud,</v>

56
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 2>some puppies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other things,</v>

57
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:44.190
<v Speaker 2>some people just go straight to youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a,</v>

58
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of experimentation going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on now.</v>

59
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

60
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:48.780
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always fascinated by that particular</v>

61
00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:53.781
<v Speaker 2>thing about how I do a podcast now just </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the side called fireside chats where </v>

62
00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 2>I just have random people into talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about random things.</v>

63
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

64
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.350
<v Speaker 2>it was similar but not nearly as good as</v>
<v Speaker 2>your show.</v>

65
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

66
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm always amazed that people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you put this on Youtube?</v>

67
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.460
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just want to stare at a static image</v>

68
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:06.190
<v Speaker 2>on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like,</v>

69
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.260
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even have it on video.</v>

70
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 2>People just anxious about how people </v>
<v Speaker 2>consume the content.</v>

71
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:12.030
<v Speaker 2>So maybe like a spreadsheet approach is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably the smartest idea.</v>

72
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could hire someone to do images </v>

73
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.701
<v Speaker 2>that represent the conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that would be a reason to have it </v>

74
00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:19.701
<v Speaker 2>on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I hear you.</v>

75
00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:24.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's people just get excited about our </v>

76
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.350
<v Speaker 2>platform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get locked into a platform and then</v>

77
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 2>they just digest everything in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform,</v>

78
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:30.720
<v Speaker 2>whether it's snapchat or instagram or </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube,</v>

79
00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:31.950
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

80
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.220
<v Speaker 2>And it's weird with Jamie and I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been talking about this a lot lately </v>

81
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.370
<v Speaker 2>about like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what makes it through,</v>

82
00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:43.371
<v Speaker 2>like how did youtube become the only one</v>
<v Speaker 2>where people upload videos?</v>

83
00:02:43.441 --> 00:02:48.441
<v Speaker 2>That seems insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like that seems so </v>

84
00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:50.730
<v Speaker 2>straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have it so people can upload videos.</v>

85
00:02:50.731 --> 00:02:53.190
<v Speaker 2>You put ads on those videos and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

86
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean it seems like there would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of those sites.</v>

87
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they were just first and it was </v>

88
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.460
<v Speaker 2>kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

89
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.460
<v Speaker 2>was like ubiquitous</v>

90
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 3>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I find that with a lot of like social</v>

91
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 3>media too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you think about,</v>

92
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like snapchat's really faltering now </v>

93
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.041
<v Speaker 3>because instagram is basically stolen </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's entire platform and it's all about </v>

94
00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 3>like kind of these little monopolies </v>
<v Speaker 3>that exist.</v>

95
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 3>Monopolies were pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>monopolies for video,</v>

96
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:18.421
<v Speaker 3>monopoly for interacting with friends </v>
<v Speaker 3>and family on facebook and stuff like </v>

97
00:03:18.421 --> 00:03:18.421
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no thinking about,</v>

98
00:03:18.421 --> 00:03:19.710
<v Speaker 3>there's no facebook competitor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

99
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

100
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook seems to me to be more </v>

101
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.590
<v Speaker 3>indulgent medium though it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I've read some,</v>

102
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.850
<v Speaker 3>like sometimes I'll see people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook posts and I just see the first </v>

103
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 3>paragraph and then we'll see how long </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago was.</v>

104
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:34.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reading that.</v>

105
00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.420
<v Speaker 3>Just keep moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just too much.</v>

106
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.890
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

107
00:03:37.891 --> 00:03:42.891
<v Speaker 3>it's like I find my girlfriend just </v>
<v Speaker 3>deactivated her facebook account and I </v>

108
00:03:42.891 --> 00:03:46.861
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't find so much utility in it </v>

109
00:03:46.861 --> 00:03:46.861
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

110
00:03:46.861 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 3>Especially after the election.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

111
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:50.080
<v Speaker 3>everyone hates each other on here and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not fun.</v>

112
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.670
<v Speaker 3>I already have twitter for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

113
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.700
<v Speaker 3>but like you're saying on twitter you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't go on and on and on and on about </v>

114
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Speaker 3>how much you hate Donald Trump or </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton.</v>

115
00:03:56.831 --> 00:04:01.831
<v Speaker 3>So there's like no way to retreat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find that I don't even use facebook </v>

116
00:04:01.831 --> 00:04:05.761
<v Speaker 3>that much anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use it because my instagram posts </v>

117
00:04:05.761 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 3>directly to twitter and to facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I use it.</v>

118
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.160
<v Speaker 3>And.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's interesting that it shows that </v>

119
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.570
<v Speaker 3>and the amount of people that engage </v>
<v Speaker 3>like my facebook as a fraction of what </v>

120
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 3>everything else has and I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't use it.</v>

121
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:17.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

122
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 3>I think algorithmically the more you use</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

123
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 3>probably the more massages you to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>top of,</v>

124
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.990
<v Speaker 3>of a person's feet or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what's annoying about </v>

125
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:26.990
<v Speaker 3>facebook is you can't put anything in </v>
<v Speaker 3>order.</v>

126
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 3>We have no idea what you've seen </v>
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>

127
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 3>I was just talking to someone the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

128
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 3>I only have 700 friends on there or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

129
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.640
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people from college that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>might've had a class with or something </v>

130
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did the same 15 people to show up on</v>

131
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:37.210
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even interact with these people,</v>

132
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:42.211
<v Speaker 3>so I feel like I'm missing a ton of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff and I still find twitter is the </v>

133
00:04:42.211 --> 00:04:43.450
<v Speaker 3>most useful for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People love facebook though for arguing.</v>

134
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.920
<v Speaker 3>They fucking love it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

135
00:04:44.921 --> 00:04:49.921
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've gone over some political arguments </v>

136
00:04:49.921 --> 00:04:49.921
<v Speaker 3>that people have on facebook and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

137
00:04:49.921 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you have the time for this?</v>

138
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.020
<v Speaker 3>Do people have other things that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoy?</v>

139
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know there's something about that sort </v>

140
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.880
<v Speaker 3>of tit for tat verbal exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like trying to one up someone and trying</v>

141
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:03.220
<v Speaker 3>to make a better point and it's.</v>

142
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it's replaced sport for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

143
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for some folks I feel like it's a game </v>

144
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.651
<v Speaker 3>and sort of what in some sort of a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a text based video game or saying </v>

145
00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:17.980
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an old text adventure or something </v>

146
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.980
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

147
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.980
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

148
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.580
<v Speaker 3>What I find in the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One interesting thing about the </v>

149
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.351
<v Speaker 3>interesting thing about facebook that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think is worth noting is that it's </v>

150
00:05:22.351 --> 00:05:23.290
<v Speaker 3>typically real people with real names </v>
<v Speaker 3>and real picture,</v>

151
00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:26.800
<v Speaker 3>so at least they're putting themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>out there as opposed to twitter.</v>

152
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.660
<v Speaker 3>The kind of the anonymous nature of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

153
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.880
<v Speaker 3>So I respect that for the most part on </v>
<v Speaker 3>facebook.</v>

154
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you,</v>

155
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:33.310
<v Speaker 3>it's like no one's winning this </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>

156
00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:38.311
<v Speaker 3>It's just the repetitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many times am I going to see the </v>

157
00:05:38.311 --> 00:05:40.261
<v Speaker 3>same thing over and over again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've kind of just withdrawn from that </v>

158
00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:40.261
<v Speaker 3>entirely because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

159
00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:44.520
<v Speaker 3>well you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm wanting to talk to you about </v>

160
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.141
<v Speaker 3>Internet controversy because when we had</v>
<v Speaker 3>you on the first time it was Kinda just </v>

161
00:05:46.141 --> 00:05:48.730
<v Speaker 3>after your whole thing and happen with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

162
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.150
<v Speaker 3>He had made this one like incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 3>innocuous tweet.</v>

163
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.200
<v Speaker 3>It was a like a day without women or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

164
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.800
<v Speaker 3>Silence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what was the tweet?</v>

165
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 3>It was a our peace and quiet hashtag a </v>
<v Speaker 3>day without a woman.</v>

166
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean which is like an Al Bundy joke </v>

167
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:07.780
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>

168
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.110
<v Speaker 4>And but the thing is like if that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened today,</v>

169
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 4>nobody would give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

170
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 4>It's like then it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a boiling controversial,</v>

171
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:20.330
<v Speaker 4>like the first bubbles of just social </v>
<v Speaker 4>media outrage.</v>

172
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:22.220
<v Speaker 4>It seems like you were one of the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>bubble.</v>

173
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.610
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I explained to you originally,</v>

174
00:06:24.611 --> 00:06:29.611
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it was partially a political</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit because of the industry I worked in </v>

175
00:06:29.611 --> 00:06:32.851
<v Speaker 3>and all of that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also like I was telling you before </v>

176
00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:35.611
<v Speaker 3>we started the more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had time to think after all things </v>

177
00:06:35.611 --> 00:06:35.611
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things happen.</v>

178
00:06:35.611 --> 00:06:36.250
<v Speaker 3>I want you to a company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was working 70 hours a week.</v>

179
00:06:36.251 --> 00:06:39.760
<v Speaker 3>I had no bandwidth to really think about</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the hell happened.</v>

180
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.240
<v Speaker 3>The more I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the angrier I actually got about about </v>

181
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.910
<v Speaker 3>like how I had to go through that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch other people also kind of go </v>

182
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.421
<v Speaker 3>through similar things as the outrage </v>
<v Speaker 3>machine just eats people and spits them </v>

183
00:06:51.421 --> 00:06:52.040
<v Speaker 3>out as they go along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you stop it,</v>

184
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.020
<v Speaker 4>I think about what you actually said and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

185
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.700
<v Speaker 4>that what that actually cost like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually caused you to stop working with</v>

186
00:06:59.701 --> 00:07:03.960
<v Speaker 4>people like this one silly joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they don't know you.</v>

187
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:09.020
<v Speaker 4>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that one joke that one thing </v>

188
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.931
<v Speaker 4>that you said is so awful and outrageous</v>
<v Speaker 4>that all of our years of collaborating,</v>

189
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.930
<v Speaker 4>working together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to do projects,</v>

190
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.480
<v Speaker 4>trying to be creative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having fun,</v>

191
00:07:18.481 --> 00:07:23.481
<v Speaker 4>all the conversations we've had about </v>
<v Speaker 4>life and about humans and politics had </v>

192
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:25.080
<v Speaker 4>men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are all out the window.</v>

193
00:07:25.081 --> 00:07:28.440
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You made a joke that I find marginally.</v>

194
00:07:28.441 --> 00:07:28.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

195
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.460
<v Speaker 3>maybe uncertain day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marginally offensive.</v>

196
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.190
<v Speaker 4>It's if it was a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if a woman said that like a day of peace</v>

197
00:07:35.191 --> 00:07:36.600
<v Speaker 4>and quiet a day without men.</v>

198
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:43.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I would go out to keep them </v>

199
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:43.080
<v Speaker 3>and move on with your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that like,</v>

200
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.150
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to get this lady fired.</v>

201
00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:49.151
<v Speaker 3>She's a terrible person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the only thing that I can think </v>

202
00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:52.361
<v Speaker 3>about is that I was at least in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>position where it didn't destroy me or </v>

203
00:07:52.361 --> 00:07:53.240
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was.</v>

204
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.990
<v Speaker 3>I actually am doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

205
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 3>financially better and feel happier and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm doing now.</v>

206
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.520
<v Speaker 3>So it didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it kind of backfired or other people </v>

207
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:03.520
<v Speaker 3>that we're trying to do whatever they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were doing to me anyway,</v>

208
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.780
<v Speaker 3>but I feel for the people that find </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves in similar situations that </v>

209
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:07.780
<v Speaker 3>don't have and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some,</v>

210
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.100
<v Speaker 3>some sort of Internet cloud or some sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of community that can kind of rally </v>

211
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:12.740
<v Speaker 3>around them and lift them up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what my community did to me,</v>

212
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:13.790
<v Speaker 3>which I'm so appreciative of.</v>

213
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.520
<v Speaker 3>So I just think about how it's just sad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

214
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:19.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that I've ever been so </v>
<v Speaker 3>offended by something.</v>

215
00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:21.980
<v Speaker 3>Somebody tweeted or even said that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>like went out of my way to,</v>

216
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.410
<v Speaker 3>to make it personal and try to destroy </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

217
00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:29.411
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying people don't do terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit happens all the time where we're </v>

218
00:08:29.411 --> 00:08:30.840
<v Speaker 3>seeing that play out with Harvey </v>
<v Speaker 3>Weinstein and all these kinds of things.</v>

219
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:35.900
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely awful really awful things and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like people are kind of like </v>

220
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.791
<v Speaker 3>being distracted by the shiny object in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the corner when they're losing sight of </v>

221
00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:43.030
<v Speaker 3>what's important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well today it feels like there's blood </v>

222
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:43.030
<v Speaker 3>in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

223
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:43.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

224
00:08:43.461 --> 00:08:47.270
<v Speaker 3>it seems like there's so many people </v>
<v Speaker 3>going after so many people.</v>

225
00:08:47.271 --> 00:08:49.820
<v Speaker 3>It's just people are running around </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking for targets.</v>

226
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:54.821
<v Speaker 3>I the way I met,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine I'm imagining like the Internet </v>

227
00:08:54.821 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 3>and people on the Internet being like an</v>
<v Speaker 3>angry mob</v>

228
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.280
<v Speaker 4>running through the streets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>frothing at the mouth,</v>

229
00:08:59.281 --> 00:09:01.320
<v Speaker 4>just looking for somewhere to point </v>
<v Speaker 4>their gun.</v>

230
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really what it feels like.</v>

231
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 4>It feels like there's definitely some </v>
<v Speaker 4>real targets out there.</v>

232
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely some.</v>

233
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Speaker 4>This Kevin Spacey thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a scary thing.</v>

234
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:15.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean apparently Rosie O'donnell start </v>
<v Speaker 4>tweeting that he had been doing this </v>

235
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:19.791
<v Speaker 4>forever and that this is just the tip of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the iceberg and there's a bunch of boys </v>

236
00:09:19.791 --> 00:09:22.920
<v Speaker 4>that he went after.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's true,</v>

237
00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:23.980
<v Speaker 4>what's not true right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>

238
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm assuming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's real.</v>

239
00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:28.170
<v Speaker 4>That's a real horrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a joke.</v>

240
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.700
<v Speaker 4>It's not someone with an innocuous maybe</v>
<v Speaker 4>off color joke.</v>

241
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:38.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is like real stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think the good part is all of this </v>

242
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.470
<v Speaker 4>awful behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>predatory evil,</v>

243
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the Harvey Weinstein and whatever </v>

244
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:48.800
<v Speaker 4>else is probably a million other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

245
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:54.140
<v Speaker 4>That stuff's going to get exposed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it seems like the negative part </v>

246
00:09:54.241 --> 00:09:57.120
<v Speaker 4>about it is that people are looking for </v>
<v Speaker 4>targets.</v>

247
00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.270
<v Speaker 4>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

248
00:09:58.420 --> 00:09:59.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And well that's what kind of scares me.</v>

249
00:09:59.771 --> 00:10:04.771
<v Speaker 5>I was telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you're a black mirror </v>

250
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:04.771
<v Speaker 5>fan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I was,</v>

251
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:04.771
<v Speaker 5>well I've only watched one episode,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I love it.</v>

252
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:07.860
<v Speaker 5>I highly recommend you get two eps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love that show and it's,</v>

253
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:12.870
<v Speaker 5>it's what's going on now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Reminds me a little bit of like a Black </v>

254
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.620
<v Speaker 5>Mirror episode where like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like people are,</v>

255
00:10:14.621 --> 00:10:15.850
<v Speaker 5>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are targeting others,</v>

256
00:10:15.851 --> 00:10:20.851
<v Speaker 5>but I feel and I feel like accusations </v>
<v Speaker 5>are part of the process are part of due </v>

257
00:10:20.851 --> 00:10:25.471
<v Speaker 5>process really starts with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>accusation and I feel like people </v>

258
00:10:25.471 --> 00:10:25.471
<v Speaker 5>aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

259
00:10:25.471 --> 00:10:26.410
<v Speaker 5>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not defending anything that anyone's</v>

260
00:10:26.411 --> 00:10:31.411
<v Speaker 5>done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I feel like everyone just assumes </v>

261
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:33.211
<v Speaker 5>guilt no matter what and it scares me </v>
<v Speaker 5>because now we're getting to the point </v>

262
00:10:33.211 --> 00:10:36.691
<v Speaker 5>where anyone can accuse someone of </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything at all and they're </v>

263
00:10:36.691 --> 00:10:37.180
<v Speaker 5>automatically guilty and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>automatically shame that I'm like,</v>

264
00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:39.070
<v Speaker 5>but aren't you curious what's true?</v>

265
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:40.780
<v Speaker 5>Maybe half or 75 percent of this is </v>
<v Speaker 5>true,</v>

266
00:10:40.781 --> 00:10:45.781
<v Speaker 5>but certainly not all of this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Certainly not all of these accusations </v>

267
00:10:45.781 --> 00:10:48.781
<v Speaker 5>are true at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The one thing that I was interested in </v>

268
00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:50.731
<v Speaker 5>is um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mark Halperin who the political writer </v>

269
00:10:50.731 --> 00:10:50.980
<v Speaker 5>who was accused of things last week.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't hear this one.</v>

270
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.980
<v Speaker 5>There's so many to keep up with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

271
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:53.260
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

272
00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:58.290
<v Speaker 5>it's happening a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mark Halperin is a famous political </v>

273
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.081
<v Speaker 5>writer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wrote a game change and double down </v>

274
00:11:01.081 --> 00:11:03.450
<v Speaker 5>those famous books.</v>
<v Speaker 5>About 2008 and 2012 with John Heilemann </v>

275
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.841
<v Speaker 5>who was his partner.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was on Msnbc and all this stuff and </v>

276
00:11:06.841 --> 00:11:09.010
<v Speaker 5>he was accused of some sexual harassment</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he was at ABC News in the early two</v>

277
00:11:09.011 --> 00:11:12.100
<v Speaker 5>thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he came out and was basically like,</v>

278
00:11:12.101 --> 00:11:13.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry for my behavior and all that </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of stuff.</v>

279
00:11:13.751 --> 00:11:16.490
<v Speaker 5>And what I thought was interesting about</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was that he was like,</v>

280
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:21.520
<v Speaker 5>not all of these accusations are true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he kind of just then went on and </v>

281
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.880
<v Speaker 5>apologize and did all this and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm interested in,</v>

282
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:27.890
<v Speaker 5>in like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are you going to contest any of </v>

283
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:27.890
<v Speaker 5>this?</v>

284
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:27.890
<v Speaker 5>Like what is true and what isn't true?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why aren't we interested in what is true</v>

285
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:29.500
<v Speaker 5>and what isn't true?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Clearly you are a scumbag in some way,</v>

286
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.500
<v Speaker 5>but I'm also curious in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you going to defend yourself?</v>

287
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.870
<v Speaker 5>Are we in a situation where no one can </v>
<v Speaker 5>defend themselves from these,</v>

288
00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:39.930
<v Speaker 5>from these terrible accusations?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it reminds me of a black mirror a </v>

289
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.330
<v Speaker 5>lot and that's a worthy accusations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was a basically accused of um,</v>

290
00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.880
<v Speaker 5>heavily hitting on women like that were </v>
<v Speaker 5>junior than him.</v>

291
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.590
<v Speaker 5>Some when we're working with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

292
00:11:47.591 --> 00:11:48.400
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somewhere,</v>

293
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:50.350
<v Speaker 5>somewhere like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think any of them accused him of</v>

294
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:55.470
<v Speaker 5>sexual assault or anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but apparently he might've rubbed up </v>

295
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:56.620
<v Speaker 5>against some women or did some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some things that are sexual assault.</v>

296
00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:58.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>presume I assume so,</v>

297
00:11:58.661 --> 00:12:03.661
<v Speaker 5>but I guess what I'm saying is like on </v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody that's essentially sexual </v>

298
00:12:03.661 --> 00:12:06.901
<v Speaker 5>assault,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean more like I don't think they're </v>

299
00:12:06.901 --> 00:12:06.901
<v Speaker 5>accusing him of raping them or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>

300
00:12:06.901 --> 00:12:08.140
<v Speaker 5>like something like something was </v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely horrifying.</v>

301
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:09.040
<v Speaker 5>Horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

302
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.270
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm like,</v>

303
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:10.930
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>clearly,</v>

304
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:12.100
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked him a lot and I'm like,</v>

305
00:12:12.101 --> 00:12:12.790
<v Speaker 5>well I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

306
00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're clearly not a good person.</v>

307
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.420
<v Speaker 5>But I was also just interested in that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in that,</v>

308
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.190
<v Speaker 5>that dynamic of his statement where I </v>
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>

309
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:22.510
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what isn't true?</v>

310
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:23.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm curious what isn't true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why,</v>

311
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:28.940
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it almost suggests that everything is </v>

312
00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.051
<v Speaker 5>true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then you just never know any </v>

313
00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:31.051
<v Speaker 5>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I just kind of reserve judgment until</v>

314
00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:32.170
<v Speaker 5>more information is known about all of </v>
<v Speaker 5>these people.</v>

315
00:12:32.171 --> 00:12:37.171
<v Speaker 5>And I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to jump in on it because I </v>

316
00:12:37.171 --> 00:12:37.171
<v Speaker 5>don't know,</v>

317
00:12:37.171 --> 00:12:37.171
<v Speaker 4>even want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

318
00:12:37.171 --> 00:12:39.880
<v Speaker 4>unless it's people that are in my world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean at a certain point in time,</v>

319
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.490
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I want to know about Kevin Spacey</v>

320
00:12:42.491 --> 00:12:45.370
<v Speaker 4>type situations or Harvey Weinstein type</v>
<v Speaker 4>situations,</v>

321
00:12:45.371 --> 00:12:50.371
<v Speaker 4>but I think there's a lot of men that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are in that position where they're are a</v>

322
00:12:50.441 --> 00:12:52.760
<v Speaker 4>boss or they are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

323
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:58.120
<v Speaker 4>the owner of a company and they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>these people under them and these people</v>

324
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:02.290
<v Speaker 4>behave in a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like almost like as if they are royalty,</v>

325
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.870
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's what Harvey Weinstein</v>

326
00:13:04.871 --> 00:13:09.871
<v Speaker 4>experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean essentially he was like the </v>

327
00:13:09.871 --> 00:13:10.750
<v Speaker 4>royalty of is this enormous movie </v>
<v Speaker 4>empire.</v>

328
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:15.220
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we find that particularly offensive,</v>

329
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:20.240
<v Speaker 4>this not just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not just a creep trying to get </v>

330
00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.621
<v Speaker 4>laid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a guy that was trying to hold that </v>

331
00:13:22.621 --> 00:13:24.130
<v Speaker 4>power over people and use it against </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

332
00:13:24.131 --> 00:13:26.320
<v Speaker 4>And then on top of that he was like </v>
<v Speaker 4>physically forceful.</v>

333
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:31.320
<v Speaker 4>So you've got like your worst case </v>
<v Speaker 4>scenarios and then you have guys that </v>

334
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.020
<v Speaker 4>are just trying to get laid and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

335
00:13:32.021 --> 00:13:33.640
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you,</v>

336
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:34.050
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

337
00:13:34.051 --> 00:13:35.470
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we,</v>

338
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.370
<v Speaker 4>we demonizing aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 4>heterosexuality,</v>

339
00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.180
<v Speaker 4>like where does this go?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where does this go into sexual assault?</v>

340
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.390
<v Speaker 4>Like rubbing up against someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>physically touching them when they don't</v>

341
00:13:46.391 --> 00:13:51.391
<v Speaker 4>want you to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's sexual assault but hitting </v>

342
00:13:51.391 --> 00:13:53.140
<v Speaker 4>on someone but that doesn't seem like </v>
<v Speaker 4>sexual assault or anything.</v>

343
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:54.730
<v Speaker 4>It seems like someone just trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>laid,</v>

344
00:13:54.731 --> 00:13:59.731
<v Speaker 4>like where does it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then when someone's the boss he </v>

345
00:13:59.731 --> 00:13:59.731
<v Speaker 4>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

346
00:13:59.731 --> 00:14:00.430
<v Speaker 4>but then you're not supposed to do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're a boss.</v>

347
00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.000
<v Speaker 5>I always knew I was very interested in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

348
00:14:03.001 --> 00:14:05.280
<v Speaker 5>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the dynamic between what specifically</v>

349
00:14:05.281 --> 00:14:10.170
<v Speaker 5>with Harvey Weinstein and his people </v>
<v Speaker 5>under him for many decades about.</v>

350
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:12.120
<v Speaker 5>I always trying to put myself in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>position of like,</v>

351
00:14:12.121 --> 00:14:15.660
<v Speaker 5>how does this stay quiet for so long?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even though there's a little rumblings,</v>

352
00:14:15.661 --> 00:14:20.661
<v Speaker 5>like they talk about Seth Mcfarlane's </v>
<v Speaker 5>joke at some award show Kevin Spacey to </v>

353
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.890
<v Speaker 5>Family Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>family guy.</v>

354
00:14:21.891 --> 00:14:25.160
<v Speaker 5>Like a little kid was running away from </v>
<v Speaker 5>silos with locked and Kevin Spacey,</v>

355
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:30.250
<v Speaker 5>spacement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing that this stuff is kind of </v>

356
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.680
<v Speaker 5>like an open secret and so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but still doesn't seep out or really.</v>

357
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.750
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it makes you think about the pie,</v>

358
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:38.780
<v Speaker 5>the power dynamics and how fearful </v>
<v Speaker 5>people are in these positions because </v>

359
00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:38.780
<v Speaker 5>it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My initial instinct was like,</v>

360
00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.370
<v Speaker 5>why didn't anyone say anything that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>similar to the bill cosby thing?</v>

361
00:14:41.371 --> 00:14:42.660
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why didn't anyone say anything?</v>

362
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:44.340
<v Speaker 5>But then you realized people were saying</v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

363
00:14:44.341 --> 00:14:45.930
<v Speaker 5>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were being given hush money.</v>

364
00:14:45.931 --> 00:14:48.000
<v Speaker 5>They were being shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But these are really,</v>

365
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.400
<v Speaker 5>really bad people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I agree with you that it,</v>

366
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.270
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never been a um,</v>

367
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.330
<v Speaker 2>an aggressive flirt flirter as it were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been very passive with women</v>

368
00:14:56.331 --> 00:14:59.270
<v Speaker 2>because I never really believed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself that much and all that.</v>

369
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.940
<v Speaker 2>But I've known people that have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>very flirtatious and,</v>

370
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.270
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

371
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:04.310
<v Speaker 2>and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

372
00:15:04.311 --> 00:15:07.980
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what is the line there now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is it okay to,</v>

373
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.180
<v Speaker 2>to be flirtatious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to call a woman beautiful at a bar or to</v>

374
00:15:11.181 --> 00:15:13.300
<v Speaker 2>do something like that as opposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

375
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:16.940
<v Speaker 2>kind of if a girl likes you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing.</v>

376
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Like if you meet a girl at a bar and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl's like,</v>

377
00:15:20.601 --> 00:15:22.430
<v Speaker 2>Colin is a really cool guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

378
00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:25.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm so into him and collins like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really beautiful.</v>

379
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:26.120
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

380
00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:27.860
<v Speaker 2>I gotta thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then next thing you know,</v>

381
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.400
<v Speaker 2>you guys are hanging out or you meet a </v>
<v Speaker 2>girl at a bar,</v>

382
00:15:31.401 --> 00:15:32.780
<v Speaker 2>she has nothing.</v>

383
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.160
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't want to have anything to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with you.</v>

384
00:15:34.161 --> 00:15:35.930
<v Speaker 2>She's sober,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're drinking,</v>

385
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:37.880
<v Speaker 2>your breath smells and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

386
00:15:37.881 --> 00:15:40.130
<v Speaker 2>you're really beautiful and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh gross,</v>

387
00:15:40.131 --> 00:15:41.840
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck away from me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

388
00:15:41.841 --> 00:15:46.100
<v Speaker 2>it can be exactly the same attempt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the person is just not into you.</v>

389
00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.450
<v Speaker 2>You become a creep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

390
00:15:47.451 --> 00:15:48.210
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

391
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:50.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

392
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

393
00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:56.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't look at the situation now in </v>
<v Speaker 2>2017 with on college campuses and all </v>

394
00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.560
<v Speaker 2>these things as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as desirable for anyone because who </v>

395
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:00.560
<v Speaker 2>knows who the hell knows the rules of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the landscape.</v>

396
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.960
<v Speaker 2>Now I think a lot of it just comes down </v>
<v Speaker 2>to mutual respect and all of that,</v>

397
00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:03.680
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

398
00:16:03.681 --> 00:16:04.850
<v Speaker 2>you know what I think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

399
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.020
<v Speaker 2>I really think we're shifting a like </v>
<v Speaker 2>culturally,</v>

400
00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:14.380
<v Speaker 2>I think this is a big gigantic shift,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like an earthquake of </v>

401
00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:18.971
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that over the course of human </v>

402
00:16:18.971 --> 00:16:22.391
<v Speaker 2>history we have slowly but surely become</v>
<v Speaker 2>better to each other and like we were </v>

403
00:16:22.391 --> 00:16:22.391
<v Speaker 2>playing.</v>

404
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:28.010
<v Speaker 2>We had a photograph that we put up </v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday have an ad from 1911.</v>

405
00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:33.460
<v Speaker 2>It was a gum add and it was a mixture of</v>
<v Speaker 2>instructing a man how to go about </v>

406
00:16:34.791 --> 00:16:37.440
<v Speaker 2>kissing a woman and a lot of it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

407
00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:41.510
<v Speaker 2>do not ask permission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look in her eyes a gaze dreamily.</v>

408
00:16:41.511 --> 00:16:46.460
<v Speaker 2>It was like really like weird to </v>
<v Speaker 2>instructing how to grab her face,</v>

409
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:48.620
<v Speaker 2>how to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaned down to kiss her.</v>

410
00:16:48.621 --> 00:16:50.300
<v Speaker 2>It was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very bizarre.</v>

411
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:53.590
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you tried to put that ad out today,</v>

412
00:16:53.591 --> 00:16:57.340
<v Speaker 2>he will be fucking skewered publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

413
00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.470
<v Speaker 2>So after you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's the ad right there.</v>

414
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:03.860
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how to kiss a girl?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then learn,</v>

415
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:06.290
<v Speaker 2>stand facing her to not tell her your </v>
<v Speaker 2>intentions,</v>

416
00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:08.680
<v Speaker 2>do not ask for permission to kiss her </v>
<v Speaker 2>urine and shit.</v>

417
00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:13.960
<v Speaker 2>We went up whenever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing yesterday so I won't go </v>

418
00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:13.960
<v Speaker 2>over it again.</v>

419
00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.420
<v Speaker 2>But that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the with the name of the game </v>

420
00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:16.420
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>common sense.</v>

421
00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.360
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Common Sense Gum company,</v>

422
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:22.390
<v Speaker 2>the common sense gum company from 1911 </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think what's happening right now </v>

423
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.600
<v Speaker 2>is this a like a really big shift and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think the beneficiaries of this big </v>

424
00:17:29.631 --> 00:17:32.060
<v Speaker 2>shift are going to be the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation of kids that are growing up.</v>

425
00:17:32.061 --> 00:17:34.850
<v Speaker 2>They're probably not going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with nearly as much shit.</v>

426
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:39.170
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm absolutely not giving bill cosby</v>

427
00:17:39.171 --> 00:17:43.280
<v Speaker 2>any sort of fucking excuse at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that in bill cosby's Day,</v>

428
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.940
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of men did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was really common.</v>

429
00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't think they thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything of it just like</v>

430
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.400
<v Speaker 4>you ever watch like an old clint </v>
<v Speaker 4>eastwood movie and they slap women.</v>

431
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.160
<v Speaker 4>They just used to beat the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>women in those movies.</v>

432
00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:01.790
<v Speaker 4>Times have changed it and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>changing now like today at an </v>

433
00:18:02.221 --> 00:18:05.130
<v Speaker 4>unprecedented rate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think ultimately it's good.</v>

434
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.530
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I ultimately everyone,</v>

435
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.270
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you catch people at like a,</v>

436
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:14.330
<v Speaker 4>a good static state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a good calm state and you,</v>

437
00:18:14.331 --> 00:18:18.510
<v Speaker 4>if they're not under duress and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking clearly and to ask them like,</v>

438
00:18:18.511 --> 00:18:23.511
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the best way to get along with </v>

439
00:18:23.511 --> 00:18:23.511
<v Speaker 4>other people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's about,</v>

440
00:18:23.511 --> 00:18:23.790
<v Speaker 4>won't treat them fairly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Treat them kindly,</v>

441
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.070
<v Speaker 4>have good friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just be nice,</v>

442
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:27.810
<v Speaker 4>be nice to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody would agree with that.</v>

443
00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:29.700
<v Speaker 4>But the problem is maybe they want </v>
<v Speaker 4>something from you,</v>

444
00:18:29.701 --> 00:18:31.770
<v Speaker 4>like column wants to fuck the girl at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the bar,</v>

445
00:18:31.771 --> 00:18:35.270
<v Speaker 4>but she's sober and collins got gross </v>
<v Speaker 4>breath and he's,</v>

446
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:35.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

447
00:18:35.701 --> 00:18:40.701
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just all sorts of extenuating </v>

448
00:18:40.701 --> 00:18:40.800
<v Speaker 4>circumstances that make people behave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really fucked up ways.</v>

449
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:44.470
<v Speaker 4>But the consequences of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>circumstances or that,</v>

450
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:48.390
<v Speaker 4>that behavior was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was minimized by power.</v>

451
00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:49.920
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was minimized by,</v>

452
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a guy like Harvey Weinstein.</v>

453
00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:54.390
<v Speaker 4>They could put these gals on movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

454
00:18:54.391 --> 00:18:57.870
<v Speaker 4>or a guy like Kevin Spacey was hitting </v>
<v Speaker 4>on a 14 year old and has no one to say,</v>

455
00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff that,</v>

456
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.270
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that ability to squash it,</v>

457
00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:05.280
<v Speaker 4>it minimized people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

458
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:10.420
<v Speaker 5>it reminds me to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not that I know deeply anything deep </v>

459
00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.511
<v Speaker 5>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I was just thinking about it in the </v>

460
00:19:13.511 --> 00:19:14.831
<v Speaker 5>shower this morning actually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It reminds me a lot of Michael Jackson </v>

461
00:19:14.831 --> 00:19:15.040
<v Speaker 5>and the sense of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

462
00:19:15.041 --> 00:19:20.041
<v Speaker 5>what was going on in the early mid </v>
<v Speaker 5>nineties with him in the accusations </v>

463
00:19:20.041 --> 00:19:20.041
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

464
00:19:20.041 --> 00:19:20.041
<v Speaker 5>was this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's true or false.</v>

465
00:19:20.041 --> 00:19:20.620
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what he's accused </v>
<v Speaker 5>overnight.</v>

466
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:22.690
<v Speaker 5>People kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think treat him as if he was innocent.</v>

467
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.630
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

468
00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:27.380
<v Speaker 5>But it reminds me of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was like telltale signs of some of</v>

469
00:19:27.381 --> 00:19:31.070
<v Speaker 5>some sexual corruption and Hollywood and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the music industry,</v>

470
00:19:31.071 --> 00:19:32.690
<v Speaker 5>the movie industry in all of that and </v>
<v Speaker 5>some years ago,</v>

471
00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:37.900
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's kind of bubbled back to the </v>

472
00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:37.900
<v Speaker 5>surface with some big names.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I just,</v>

473
00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.021
<v Speaker 5>I agree with you like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just wish people just need to be good </v>

474
00:19:41.021 --> 00:19:44.651
<v Speaker 5>to talk to each other and like act </v>
<v Speaker 5>normal and these guys and and be </v>

475
00:19:44.651 --> 00:19:48.821
<v Speaker 5>respectful and these things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't find yourself in these </v>

476
00:19:48.821 --> 00:19:50.681
<v Speaker 5>terrible situations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then you see this desperation with </v>

477
00:19:50.681 --> 00:19:52.901
<v Speaker 5>Harvey Weinstein where you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you learned that he might've sexually </v>

478
00:19:52.901 --> 00:19:53.330
<v Speaker 5>assaulted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even raped the woman who then appears in</v>

479
00:19:53.331 --> 00:19:55.210
<v Speaker 5>a movie some years later because he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

480
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:58.520
<v Speaker 5>the gravity well around him is so strong</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they have no choice.</v>

481
00:19:58.521 --> 00:20:00.740
<v Speaker 5>So it's a very sad situation for those </v>
<v Speaker 5>women as well.</v>

482
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.570
<v Speaker 4>Situation for humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

483
00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:08.690
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's just certain things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people were able to get away with.</v>

484
00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:15.650
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the cosby thing to me is probably </v>

485
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:16.920
<v Speaker 4>number one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the number one worst whenever,</v>

486
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:22.160
<v Speaker 4>because he represented this sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 4>really moral,</v>

487
00:20:23.191 --> 00:20:24.950
<v Speaker 4>very ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

488
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.180
<v Speaker 4>like doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't swear on stage.</v>

489
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:32.480
<v Speaker 4>Like he's the last one that you would </v>
<v Speaker 4>expect to be what he's described been </v>

490
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.280
<v Speaker 4>described as the number one serial </v>
<v Speaker 4>rapist of all time and you're like,</v>

491
00:20:35.281 --> 00:20:36.090
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

492
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.670
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how is that possible?</v>

493
00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:39.130
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

494
00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:44.130
<v Speaker 5>incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a crazy on an unfortunate and </v>

495
00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:44.130
<v Speaker 5>sad situation and ruined his whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>legacy,</v>

496
00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:44.750
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

497
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:45.730
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like who,</v>

498
00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:47.890
<v Speaker 5>who could ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I seen the cosby show,</v>

499
00:20:47.891 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't</v>

500
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.230
<v Speaker 2>even know if it's syndicated anymore </v>
<v Speaker 2>since all the accusations came up,</v>

501
00:20:50.231 --> 00:20:51.590
<v Speaker 2>but who could watch that now and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

502
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.460
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just look past that.</v>

503
00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:58.461
<v Speaker 2>Like I certainly don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially because a lot of that is </v>

504
00:20:58.461 --> 00:20:58.461
<v Speaker 2>contemporaneous to that show is still on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the air.</v>

505
00:20:58.461 --> 00:20:58.461
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

506
00:20:58.461 --> 00:21:02.941
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I assume that they got their stuff </v>

507
00:21:02.941 --> 00:21:02.941
<v Speaker 2>pulled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something capable.</v>

508
00:21:02.941 --> 00:21:03.040
<v Speaker 2>What about Fat Albert?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be weird.</v>

509
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

510
00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

511
00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:08.920
<v Speaker 2>contemporaneous to a lot of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>accusations going back to,</v>

512
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.420
<v Speaker 2>to um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

513
00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:13.340
<v Speaker 2>what was that original show that he did </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the high spot?</v>

514
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:14.010
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

515
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.100
<v Speaker 2>That was the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

516
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:15.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

517
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:21.030
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of that's like 50 years </v>

518
00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:21.030
<v Speaker 2>where the accusations like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

519
00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:26.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood was a different animal back </v>

520
00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:26.060
<v Speaker 2>then is a different animal when people </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have a voice,</v>

521
00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do you,</v>

522
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.950
<v Speaker 2>because you have some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>

523
00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:28.460
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

524
00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.070
<v Speaker 2>you were on TV and you do it.</v>

525
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.650
<v Speaker 2>You do hear rumblings like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

526
00:21:32.651 --> 00:21:34.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm not asking you to be specific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do you hear.</v>

527
00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Well I haven't been on TV in a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

528
00:21:37.001 --> 00:21:39.940
<v Speaker 2>but I did hear the cosby thing way back </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the nineties.</v>

529
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.160
<v Speaker 2>I heard that when I was on the set of </v>
<v Speaker 2>news radio,</v>

530
00:21:42.161 --> 00:21:44.320
<v Speaker 2>I remember people talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

531
00:21:44.321 --> 00:21:46.390
<v Speaker 2>and I had heard the Kevin Spacey thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

532
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:47.740
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

533
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:49.860
<v Speaker 2>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

534
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:52.120
<v Speaker 2>it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you should have gone to the press,</v>

535
00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:53.820
<v Speaker 2>like with what information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

536
00:21:53.821 --> 00:21:58.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like someone accused Rosie O'donnell </v>

537
00:21:58.821 --> 00:21:59.410
<v Speaker 2>because Rosie O'donnell was talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Kevin Spacey.</v>

538
00:21:59.411 --> 00:22:00.790
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a Sicko.</v>

539
00:22:00.791 --> 00:22:02.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone knew you were a Sicko.</v>

540
00:22:02.081 --> 00:22:03.970
<v Speaker 2>And so someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on a second.</v>

541
00:22:03.971 --> 00:22:07.720
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying that you knew that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like this and you didn't do anything</v>

542
00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:09.000
<v Speaker 2>about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she.</v>

543
00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.080
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there was always rumors,</v>

544
00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:15.310
<v Speaker 2>but no one had any evidence right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>until this actor came forth.</v>

545
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:18.490
<v Speaker 2>Is he an actor or a director and is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadway actor.</v>

546
00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:20.440
<v Speaker 2>Which Broadway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

547
00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:24.790
<v Speaker 2>that's the whole thing is fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was in television show though.</v>

548
00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:27.910
<v Speaker 2>He was a Broadway actor with Kevin </v>
<v Speaker 2>Spacey in Nineteen.</v>

549
00:22:27.911 --> 00:22:31.240
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the hell it was when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when this happened 30 years ago.</v>

550
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.430
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>misdirection thing in his statement too?</v>

551
00:22:33.431 --> 00:22:35.860
<v Speaker 2>About being like crazy weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sneaky.</v>

552
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Good.</v>

553
00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think very,</v>

554
00:22:38.141 --> 00:22:40.770
<v Speaker 2>very transparent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very transparent.</v>

555
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:42.910
<v Speaker 2>Deflecting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I live my life as a gay man.</v>

556
00:22:42.911 --> 00:22:43.510
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck face.</v>

557
00:22:43.511 --> 00:22:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Nobody asked you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you try to rape a kid?</v>

558
00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:46.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

559
00:22:46.481 --> 00:22:47.710
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very weird.</v>

560
00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why he decided to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

561
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.570
<v Speaker 2>I think he's probably panicking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

562
00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:56.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean and ultimately he probably should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

563
00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:57.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

564
00:22:57.741 --> 00:23:02.741
<v Speaker 2>I would assume so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially because maybe there are more </v>

565
00:23:02.741 --> 00:23:04.801
<v Speaker 2>accusations and then the whole weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing with Netflix with house of cards </v>

566
00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:04.801
<v Speaker 2>where they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be the last season now.</v>

567
00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:07.130
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they stopped production so </v>
<v Speaker 2>they stopped the completely.</v>

568
00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.050
<v Speaker 2>So Jamie was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

569
00:23:08.051 --> 00:23:10.460
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This morning I'll shut up,</v>

570
00:23:10.461 --> 00:23:11.240
<v Speaker 2>pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

571
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:16.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I thought that was interesting </v>

572
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:17.521
<v Speaker 2>specifically because they had apparently</v>
<v Speaker 2>heard already announced that it was the </v>

573
00:23:17.521 --> 00:23:17.521
<v Speaker 2>last season anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in the summer,</v>

574
00:23:17.521 --> 00:23:18.850
<v Speaker 2>so they're making it seem like they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>reacting to it.</v>

575
00:23:18.851 --> 00:23:20.650
<v Speaker 2>So everyone's just playing the PR game </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

576
00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder.</v>

577
00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:27.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because they made an </v>

578
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.611
<v Speaker 2>announcement pretty quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they made it an announcement </v>

579
00:23:29.611 --> 00:23:29.611
<v Speaker 2>sorta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to let everybody know,</v>

580
00:23:29.611 --> 00:23:30.220
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

581
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.030
<v Speaker 2>That is the last season,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but okay.</v>

582
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Production on Netflix,</v>

583
00:23:34.811 --> 00:23:38.770
<v Speaker 2>special series suspended indefinitely </v>
<v Speaker 2>following Kevin Spacey.</v>

584
00:23:38.771 --> 00:23:42.450
<v Speaker 2>Allegations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it allegation or s?</v>

585
00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:44.660
<v Speaker 2>S is this poor girl?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

586
00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:49.680
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a second or third allegation </v>

587
00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.301
<v Speaker 2>that I might've missed it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he has a Gore vidal movie that </v>

588
00:23:51.301 --> 00:23:53.510
<v Speaker 2>they're filming as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which will be interesting.</v>

589
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:54.530
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Corporate.</v>

590
00:23:54.531 --> 00:23:55.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

591
00:23:55.881 --> 00:24:00.881
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you know what's a great fucking </v>

592
00:24:00.881 --> 00:24:00.881
<v Speaker 2>film?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Gore Vidal.</v>

593
00:24:00.881 --> 00:24:03.410
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the super conservative guy?</v>

594
00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:08.070
<v Speaker 2>William F Buckley at a series of debates</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1960,</v>

595
00:24:08.071 --> 00:24:12.330
<v Speaker 2>I want to say 68.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they televise them and it,</v>

596
00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:16.730
<v Speaker 2>it was like a huge boom to whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>network it was.</v>

597
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.840
<v Speaker 2>ABC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was.</v>

598
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:23.380
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they made a documentary about these two </v>

599
00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:23.660
<v Speaker 2>going back and forth with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's brilliant.</v>

600
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:27.140
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing and it's so interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see their minds.</v>

601
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:32.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm interacting with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't that the debate series where </v>

602
00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:33.290
<v Speaker 2>William f Buckley said something super </v>
<v Speaker 2>homophobic?</v>

603
00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:34.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

604
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.080
<v Speaker 2>Called him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>called him.</v>

605
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.520
<v Speaker 2>She called him a Faggot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like yeah.</v>

606
00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.680
<v Speaker 2>Unlike network television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he said he would.</v>

607
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:43.670
<v Speaker 2>He would knock him out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd said something like,</v>

608
00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:46.590
<v Speaker 2>you'll stay plastered or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

609
00:24:46.591 --> 00:24:47.520
<v Speaker 2>I forget his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

610
00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:48.960
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his statement,</v>

611
00:24:48.961 --> 00:24:53.961
<v Speaker 2>but Gore Vidal said something to William</v>
<v Speaker 2>f Buckley that like really pushed his </v>

612
00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:59.430
<v Speaker 2>button on her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what he said to him </v>

613
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.430
<v Speaker 2>because I remember watching and being </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

614
00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:04.071
<v Speaker 2>oh my God was dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was devastating to William f </v>

615
00:25:04.071 --> 00:25:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Buckley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty much the end of his being </v>

616
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:06.890
<v Speaker 2>taken seriously because people realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

617
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:11.211
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of a fool and his ego and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind is just not within his control and </v>

618
00:25:11.211 --> 00:25:16.201
<v Speaker 2>it just got out of hand and Gore Vidal </v>
<v Speaker 2>just sort of sat there while you said </v>

619
00:25:16.201 --> 00:25:16.310
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

620
00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Corbin Allison.</v>

621
00:25:17.431 --> 00:25:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My exposure to him,</v>

622
00:25:18.581 --> 00:25:23.581
<v Speaker 2>and initially it was like he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think some historical fiction about </v>

623
00:25:23.581 --> 00:25:24.510
<v Speaker 2>some various things that now listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you queer,</v>

624
00:25:24.511 --> 00:25:29.511
<v Speaker 2>stop calling me a Crypton Nazi or I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>socking your goddamn face and you'll </v>

625
00:25:29.511 --> 00:25:31.460
<v Speaker 2>stay plastered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

626
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.660
<v Speaker 2>That's like incredible to listen to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>queer.</v>

627
00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:37.570
<v Speaker 2>Stop calling me a crypto Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

628
00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:44.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only pro or crypto Nazi I can think </v>

629
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:47.541
<v Speaker 2>of is yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So people were calling each other Nazis </v>

630
00:25:47.541 --> 00:25:48.470
<v Speaker 2>even way back after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

631
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.680
<v Speaker 2>right after World War Two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

632
00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:50.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

633
00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:53.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is like when we,</v>

634
00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:56.670
<v Speaker 2>what we saw in Charlottesville is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey look guys,</v>

635
00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:01.700
<v Speaker 2>there's real Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like don't call someone a Nazi because </v>

636
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.420
<v Speaker 2>they voted for trump because they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>

637
00:26:03.421 --> 00:26:04.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a right wing,</v>

638
00:26:04.621 --> 00:26:07.200
<v Speaker 2>conservative values are being diminished</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this country.</v>

639
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Don't call him a Nazi for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just bothers me.</v>

640
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:11.430
<v Speaker 2>The same thing with the word fascist </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'm like,</v>

641
00:26:11.431 --> 00:26:12.930
<v Speaker 2>you don't even really understand what </v>
<v Speaker 2>these words mean.</v>

642
00:26:12.931 --> 00:26:13.710
<v Speaker 2>A lot of you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

643
00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:19.250
<v Speaker 2>These words aren't only loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have definitions and I don't know </v>

644
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:22.911
<v Speaker 2>what it's like when everyone says we </v>
<v Speaker 2>live in a fascist state in America </v>

645
00:26:22.911 --> 00:26:22.911
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

646
00:26:22.911 --> 00:26:24.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The courts seem to be working fine.</v>

647
00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:25.920
<v Speaker 2>The congress doesn't do anything but </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's there.</v>

648
00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:31.290
<v Speaker 2>I lived in a fascist state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there wouldn't be an investigation </v>

649
00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:31.290
<v Speaker 2>against trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

650
00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:31.560
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm leading to indictment.</v>

651
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:36.590
<v Speaker 2>Exactly in which he actually has the </v>
<v Speaker 2>power to fire the person doing the </v>

652
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.590
<v Speaker 2>investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

653
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.590
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

654
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:38.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying we're in an ideal </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation right now,</v>

655
00:26:38.551 --> 00:26:43.551
<v Speaker 2>but people throwing around these words </v>
<v Speaker 2>very loosely need to learn a little bit </v>

656
00:26:43.551 --> 00:26:44.130
<v Speaker 2>more about why more Republican that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazis coming</v>

657
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.290
<v Speaker 5>to power and 33 and what that actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>looks like,</v>

658
00:26:46.291 --> 00:26:47.730
<v Speaker 5>what fascism actually looks like in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Italy,</v>

659
00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:52.731
<v Speaker 5>what it looks like in Germany and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>have no idea or a lot of some people do </v>

660
00:26:52.731 --> 00:26:52.731
<v Speaker 5>but most don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're.</v>

661
00:26:52.731 --> 00:26:54.270
<v Speaker 5>And they're just throwing these words </v>
<v Speaker 5>around and they mean something.</v>

662
00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:55.240
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of it</v>

663
00:26:55.310 --> 00:27:00.310
<v Speaker 4>confusion today in terms of like why </v>
<v Speaker 4>free speech is important and one of the </v>

664
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:05.021
<v Speaker 4>reasons why free speech is important is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you don't get to decide what is </v>

665
00:27:05.021 --> 00:27:05.690
<v Speaker 4>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has to be debated,</v>

666
00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:06.820
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

667
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:09.430
<v Speaker 4>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget who,</v>

668
00:27:09.431 --> 00:27:10.000
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

669
00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:11.930
<v Speaker 4>who said that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really recent.</v>

670
00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:15.050
<v Speaker 4>We talked about it yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

671
00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:20.140
<v Speaker 4>it was that guy that the Yale professor </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was on Sam Harris show hit a </v>

672
00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:23.340
<v Speaker 4>perfect statement about the guy who got </v>
<v Speaker 4>in trouble for his wife with the,</v>

673
00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.840
<v Speaker 4>the Greek fellow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His wife had defended offensive </v>

674
00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.720
<v Speaker 4>Halloween costumes and the kids went </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy and arrested him.</v>

675
00:27:30.721 --> 00:27:33.020
<v Speaker 4>Right public.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said the answer to,</v>

676
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:36.530
<v Speaker 4>to hate speech is not no speech,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's better speech.</v>

677
00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.500
<v Speaker 4>And that's such a great statement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's absolutely true.</v>

678
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:44.590
<v Speaker 4>It's absolutely true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like all these kids that are trying </v>

679
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:47.360
<v Speaker 4>to shut down conservative speakers on </v>
<v Speaker 4>campus and then by shutting down they're</v>

680
00:27:47.361 --> 00:27:52.361
<v Speaker 4>calling them white supremacist Nazis and</v>
<v Speaker 4>using these things for guys like Ben </v>

681
00:27:52.361 --> 00:27:54.270
<v Speaker 4>Shapiro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think is patently ridiculous.</v>

682
00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:54.560
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

683
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:57.310
<v Speaker 4>the Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Jewish Nazi,</v>

684
00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:00.660
<v Speaker 4>and a white supremacist as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is just like,</v>

685
00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:05.510
<v Speaker 4>because he quotes statistics about </v>
<v Speaker 4>minority crime,</v>

686
00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:10.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those statistics I feel like are pretty </v>

687
00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.791
<v Speaker 4>misleading in some ways because there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of factors that lead to these </v>

688
00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:16.211
<v Speaker 4>people being in these situations where </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's high crime rates and these </v>

689
00:28:16.211 --> 00:28:16.211
<v Speaker 4>communities and it has nothing to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

690
00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:17.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

691
00:28:17.121 --> 00:28:19.160
<v Speaker 4>you need to pull yourself up by your </v>
<v Speaker 4>bootstraps,</v>

692
00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.950
<v Speaker 4>which is like a really common way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at it,</v>

693
00:28:21.951 --> 00:28:26.060
<v Speaker 4>right on us to do with the world that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were born into.</v>

694
00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.500
<v Speaker 4>Socioeconomically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a different,</v>

695
00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.610
<v Speaker 4>different world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

696
00:28:28.611 --> 00:28:31.220
<v Speaker 4>And they're surrounded by the momentum </v>
<v Speaker 4>of crime.</v>

697
00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:36.280
<v Speaker 4>They're surrounded by the momentum of </v>
<v Speaker 4>violence and abuse and to just expect </v>

698
00:28:37.011 --> 00:28:42.011
<v Speaker 4>them to escape that because there are </v>
<v Speaker 4>examples of people that have done it in </v>

699
00:28:42.011 --> 00:28:43.160
<v Speaker 4>the past.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't apply that,</v>

700
00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.810
<v Speaker 4>that sort of logic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think,</v>

701
00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:46.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's disingenuous.</v>

702
00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:49.320
<v Speaker 4>But to call him a Nazi or a white </v>
<v Speaker 4>supremacists,</v>

703
00:28:49.321 --> 00:28:50.570
<v Speaker 4>I think it was fucking ridiculous.</v>

704
00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.210
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's just such,</v>

705
00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:56.250
<v Speaker 5>it's just such a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just used pejoratively without </v>

706
00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:56.250
<v Speaker 5>historical context.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

707
00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:56.250
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

708
00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:57.760
<v Speaker 5>it's exactly what it is because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>reminds me a little bit,</v>

709
00:28:57.761 --> 00:29:02.761
<v Speaker 5>it's different in the context,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it reminds me a little bit of when </v>

710
00:29:02.761 --> 00:29:02.761
<v Speaker 5>Bernie Sanders was running in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>primary and people will be like,</v>

711
00:29:02.761 --> 00:29:04.900
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at what socialism has given you,</v>

712
00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.600
<v Speaker 5>look at the roads and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and unlike the roads are not,</v>

713
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:10.420
<v Speaker 5>roads aren't socialists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the military is not socialist,</v>

714
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:15.640
<v Speaker 5>streetlights aren't socialists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The government spending money is not </v>

715
00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.871
<v Speaker 5>what socialism means.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's what you think the definition </v>

716
00:29:18.871 --> 00:29:18.871
<v Speaker 5>means.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then you're wrong.</v>

717
00:29:18.871 --> 00:29:19.840
<v Speaker 5>And the same thing with now Nazis and </v>
<v Speaker 5>fascism,</v>

718
00:29:19.841 --> 00:29:23.050
<v Speaker 5>like look at all the parallels between </v>
<v Speaker 5>Nazi Germany and the United States.</v>

719
00:29:23.051 --> 00:29:23.980
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't.</v>

720
00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.130
<v Speaker 5>I'm a student of history.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

721
00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:30.150
<v Speaker 5>I don't know everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't see literally one parallel </v>

722
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:30.150
<v Speaker 5>between the United States right now and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Nazi Germany.</v>

723
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:32.790
<v Speaker 5>Not even one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we're not coming off a war</v>

724
00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:33.870
<v Speaker 4>last.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not,</v>

725
00:29:33.871 --> 00:29:35.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a devastated and humiliated.</v>

726
00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the stabbing them back.</v>

727
00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.620
<v Speaker 5>Hyperinflation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

728
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.210
<v Speaker 5>this charismatic who's in prison for </v>
<v Speaker 5>awhile</v>

729
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:47.220
<v Speaker 3>writes this manifesto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tries to actually throw a coup in the </v>

730
00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:47.220
<v Speaker 3>mid twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fails all,</v>

731
00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:47.530
<v Speaker 3>like all these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

732
00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:48.370
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll make what are the,</v>

733
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:51.070
<v Speaker 3>what parallel are you talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

734
00:29:51.071 --> 00:29:56.071
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I just feel like people are </v>

735
00:29:56.071 --> 00:29:56.071
<v Speaker 3>playing fast and loose with these words </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they mean something.</v>

736
00:29:56.071 --> 00:29:56.200
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these words mean something.</v>

737
00:29:56.201 --> 00:29:57.250
<v Speaker 3>So we're going to call someone a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascist,</v>

738
00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:02.280
<v Speaker 3>find the fascias and like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are Nazis in an American culture </v>

739
00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.880
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but fortunately because of our freedom </v>

740
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:05.880
<v Speaker 3>of expression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have the right to exist.</v>

741
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.830
<v Speaker 3>And I think that by lumping in anyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>that voted for trump for instance,</v>

742
00:30:08.831 --> 00:30:10.570
<v Speaker 3>as a Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just making them look bigger.</v>

743
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.910
<v Speaker 3>That actually just benefits them there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are irrelevant.</v>

744
00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:16.210
<v Speaker 3>The KKK is a relevant 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>members maybe in a,</v>

745
00:30:16.211 --> 00:30:18.400
<v Speaker 3>in a country of 300,</v>
<v Speaker 3>$25 million people.</v>

746
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.560
<v Speaker 3>How many people identify as Neo Nazi?</v>

747
00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.140
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe $10,000</v>

748
00:30:22.141 --> 00:30:23.260
<v Speaker 3>or less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

749
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.300
<v Speaker 3>but what are you thinking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three hundred 50 million people.</v>

750
00:30:25.301 --> 00:30:28.110
<v Speaker 3>It's a very small number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's infant infant infancy.</v>

751
00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:30.010
<v Speaker 3>It's actually irrelevant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely irrelevant.</v>

752
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:35.190
<v Speaker 3>But if you're a black guy and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>all coming after you on your facebook </v>

753
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.550
<v Speaker 3>page,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it looks good.</v>

754
00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:36.430
<v Speaker 3>It looks real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

755
00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:37.090
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

756
00:30:37.091 --> 00:30:42.091
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it is that kind of badgering and </v>

757
00:30:42.091 --> 00:30:42.091
<v Speaker 3>that kind of harassment is real and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible.</v>

758
00:30:42.091 --> 00:30:42.091
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one justifies that.</v>

759
00:30:42.091 --> 00:30:43.270
<v Speaker 3>But I am so sick of the history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

760
00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:48.780
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people have suddenly are our </v>

761
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.581
<v Speaker 3>experts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It reminds me of on Columbus Day I </v>

762
00:30:50.581 --> 00:30:53.161
<v Speaker 3>tweeted out and it got tweeted a bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I though it was funny where people are </v>

763
00:30:53.161 --> 00:30:55.921
<v Speaker 3>tweeting about Columbus and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sudden sudden suddenly everyone's an </v>

764
00:30:55.921 --> 00:30:55.921
<v Speaker 3>expert now in the age of exploration </v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

765
00:30:55.921 --> 00:30:57.220
<v Speaker 3>Now everyone knows everything about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>age of exploration,</v>

766
00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:02.430
<v Speaker 3>just like everyone knew everything about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rise of Nazi-ism and the Weimer </v>

767
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.430
<v Speaker 3>Republic.</v>

768
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.480
<v Speaker 3>And just like everyone knew about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

769
00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.760
<v Speaker 3>socialism and all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

770
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.000
<v Speaker 3>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

771
00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.920
<v Speaker 3>I posted this flag behind me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

772
00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:14.200
<v Speaker 3>and a company called iron mountain </v>
<v Speaker 3>designs creates it.</v>

773
00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:18.010
<v Speaker 3>And so veteran owned company and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>make these pretty cool flags,</v>

774
00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:18.700
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very cool.</v>

775
00:31:18.701 --> 00:31:23.701
<v Speaker 3>Flags made out of metal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it has a George Washington quote on </v>

776
00:31:23.701 --> 00:31:26.311
<v Speaker 3>the back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I put it up on instagram with the </v>

777
00:31:26.311 --> 00:31:26.311
<v Speaker 3>photo of the flag photo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the logo of the company,</v>

778
00:31:26.311 --> 00:31:27.850
<v Speaker 3>like three different pictures on </v>
<v Speaker 3>instagram in a row,</v>

779
00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:29.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do that.</v>

780
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:34.230
<v Speaker 3>We're one post can have three images and</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them was a quote from George </v>

781
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:36.100
<v Speaker 3>Washington and the number of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>geniuses,</v>

782
00:31:36.101 --> 00:31:40.870
<v Speaker 3>George Washington owned slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you use an honest man on swerves?</v>

783
00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:45.010
<v Speaker 3>And they just kept rattling on about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrors of George Washington as if.</v>

784
00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.960
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>

785
00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:48.230
<v Speaker 3>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

786
00:31:48.231 --> 00:31:48.850
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot.</v>

787
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:53.560
<v Speaker 3>But this is a quote by a man who lived </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds and hundreds of years ago,</v>

788
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.260
<v Speaker 3>and this is what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

789
00:31:55.270 --> 00:32:00.270
<v Speaker 3>you want to diminish his entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>contribution to human culture because he</v>

790
00:32:01.991 --> 00:32:05.440
<v Speaker 3>did something horrible back then when </v>
<v Speaker 3>people were doing horrible things.</v>

791
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:07.210
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

792
00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:12.270
<v Speaker 3>He did own slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's a part of a very long </v>

793
00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:12.490
<v Speaker 3>conversation about what a human being </v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

794
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back then.</v>

795
00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:19.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes back to the idea of historical </v>

796
00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.911
<v Speaker 3>relativism that like you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can judge them based on the 21st </v>

797
00:32:20.911 --> 00:32:22.120
<v Speaker 3>century model.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But George Washington died in 1799.</v>

798
00:32:22.121 --> 00:32:24.280
<v Speaker 3>So this is a man that didn't even see </v>
<v Speaker 3>the 19th century.</v>

799
00:32:24.281 --> 00:32:25.450
<v Speaker 3>Nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The 20th nonetheless.</v>

800
00:32:25.451 --> 00:32:30.451
<v Speaker 3>The 21st has no idea what that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a southern plant there for the </v>

801
00:32:30.451 --> 00:32:32.430
<v Speaker 3>first five presidents of the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States where southern plant,</v>

802
00:32:32.431 --> 00:32:36.430
<v Speaker 3>there's that owned slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a totally uncommon thing.</v>

803
00:32:36.431 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not justifying it there would </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely among</v>

804
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:45.070
<v Speaker 5>the founders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were absolutely abolitionists </v>

805
00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:45.070
<v Speaker 5>during the revolution and and black </v>
<v Speaker 5>people fought for the,</v>

806
00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:46.490
<v Speaker 5>for the continental army.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

807
00:32:46.491 --> 00:32:48.530
<v Speaker 5>people judging based on these things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like that's fine,</v>

808
00:32:48.531 --> 00:32:50.810
<v Speaker 5>but if you want to take that to the to </v>
<v Speaker 5>its natural conclusion,</v>

809
00:32:50.811 --> 00:32:54.410
<v Speaker 5>you're going to find lots of problems </v>
<v Speaker 5>with lots of people even closer to us in</v>

810
00:32:54.411 --> 00:32:57.230
<v Speaker 5>history than than George Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what's funny about that is now there</v>

811
00:32:57.231 --> 00:33:02.231
<v Speaker 5>really are going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>After I was reading it just </v>

812
00:33:02.231 --> 00:33:02.231
<v Speaker 5>tangentially,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't see at all,</v>

813
00:33:02.231 --> 00:33:05.470
<v Speaker 5>but people are starting to now go after </v>
<v Speaker 5>George Washington plaques or George </v>

814
00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:09.040
<v Speaker 5>Washington statues and I feel kinda bad </v>
<v Speaker 5>about that in the sense that I was all </v>

815
00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.221
<v Speaker 5>for removing the confederate statues and</v>
<v Speaker 5>putting them in places where they made </v>

816
00:33:12.221 --> 00:33:12.221
<v Speaker 5>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So take the,</v>

817
00:33:12.221 --> 00:33:16.520
<v Speaker 5>the Jefferson Davis statue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put it in Gettysburg or whatever the </v>

818
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:16.520
<v Speaker 5>case might be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put in a museum.</v>

819
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.050
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they should be melted down</v>
<v Speaker 5>and destroyed,</v>

820
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:23.350
<v Speaker 5>but people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the next logical step is they're going </v>

821
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:25.511
<v Speaker 5>to go after the founders and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no way will any like no one's going to </v>

822
00:33:25.511 --> 00:33:25.670
<v Speaker 5>let that happen and I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

823
00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:27.500
<v Speaker 5>now they are going after him </v>
<v Speaker 5>immediately.</v>

824
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:29.870
<v Speaker 5>So I feel a little bit guilty about that</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a sense that,</v>

825
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:34.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think we should be celebrating </v>

826
00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:37.091
<v Speaker 5>confederate history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we should absolutely be celebrating </v>

827
00:33:37.091 --> 00:33:37.091
<v Speaker 5>American history.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even even the complicated American.</v>

828
00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:42.230
<v Speaker 4>It's not celebrating it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's recognizing it and understanding </v>

829
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.830
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the confederate war,</v>

830
00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.240
<v Speaker 4>the civil war rather did happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

831
00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:50.250
<v Speaker 4>it's a real historical fact and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be studied and if you don't study</v>

832
00:33:50.251 --> 00:33:55.251
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't get a comprehensive </v>

833
00:33:55.251 --> 00:33:55.251
<v Speaker 4>understanding of all the pieces that </v>
<v Speaker 4>were in place when it did happen.</v>

834
00:33:55.400 --> 00:34:00.400
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just as bad as the people that are </v>

835
00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:00.400
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

836
00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.460
<v Speaker 4>civil war was about economics and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

837
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.210
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't.</v>

838
00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.990
<v Speaker 4>It was part of what it was about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't just about economics,</v>

839
00:34:05.991 --> 00:34:08.750
<v Speaker 4>it was also about keeping slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a fact.</v>

840
00:34:08.751 --> 00:34:09.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

841
00:34:09.291 --> 00:34:10.910
<v Speaker 4>So like to diminish that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it does,</v>

842
00:34:10.911 --> 00:34:12.110
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not good either,</v>

843
00:34:12.111 --> 00:34:17.111
<v Speaker 4>but to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to try to sweep it under the rug and </v>

844
00:34:17.111 --> 00:34:17.510
<v Speaker 4>smash all the statutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like know,</v>

845
00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.570
<v Speaker 4>have that statue up so people can </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand what the fuck that is.</v>

846
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:23.360
<v Speaker 4>And if someone is going to celebrate </v>
<v Speaker 4>that statue,</v>

847
00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:24.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>south go and do it again,</v>

848
00:34:24.741 --> 00:34:27.170
<v Speaker 4>we're going to rise again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can do that,</v>

849
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:27.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that's,</v>

850
00:34:27.921 --> 00:34:29.600
<v Speaker 4>if that's their thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can do that.</v>

851
00:34:29.601 --> 00:34:31.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean we can't stop them from thinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>stupid.</v>

852
00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:33.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that I agree with you in the</v>

853
00:34:33.451 --> 00:34:35.240
<v Speaker 5>sense that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's worth it just,</v>

854
00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:38.700
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it happened or we remember it and it has</v>

855
00:34:38.701 --> 00:34:41.160
<v Speaker 5>always the grandma,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Grandpa who have always been part of</v>

856
00:34:41.161 --> 00:34:43.380
<v Speaker 5>our culture since,</v>
<v Speaker 5>since the civil war ended in 18,</v>

857
00:34:43.381 --> 00:34:48.381
<v Speaker 5>65,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and especially since the reconstruction </v>

858
00:34:48.381 --> 00:34:48.381
<v Speaker 5>ended in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 5>77.</v>

859
00:34:48.381 --> 00:34:48.381
<v Speaker 5>We've had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't even know what you're saying.</v>

860
00:34:48.381 --> 00:34:51.840
<v Speaker 5>The gray and blue uniforms of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the different sides.</v>

861
00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:53.130
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

862
00:34:53.131 --> 00:34:58.131
<v Speaker 5>when reconstruction ended in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 5>77 in our occupation of the south ended </v>

863
00:34:58.131 --> 00:35:01.820
<v Speaker 5>and then Jim crow came,</v>
<v Speaker 5>became law and there was no </v>

864
00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.790
<v Speaker 5>institutional segregation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was something that was always a </v>

865
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.790
<v Speaker 5>complicated point of celebration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

866
00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:10.400
<v Speaker 5>I've always been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've always been really kind of curious </v>

867
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.641
<v Speaker 5>and really more militant about why these</v>
<v Speaker 5>people actually got away with what they </v>

868
00:35:13.641 --> 00:35:15.060
<v Speaker 5>did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I understand,</v>

869
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.090
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

870
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:17.980
<v Speaker 5>the 10 percent plan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which we,</v>

871
00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:19.170
<v Speaker 5>do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything about that,</v>

872
00:35:19.171 --> 00:35:21.150
<v Speaker 5>that the idea that Lincoln only made are</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually really,</v>

873
00:35:21.151 --> 00:35:24.090
<v Speaker 5>Andrew Johnson only made 10 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people in the southern states.</v>

874
00:35:24.091 --> 00:35:25.410
<v Speaker 5>Basically a pledge allegiance in order </v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

875
00:35:25.411 --> 00:35:27.870
<v Speaker 5>for the states to come back in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't execute.</v>

876
00:35:27.871 --> 00:35:30.390
<v Speaker 5>Anyone that you know or even really try </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

877
00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:31.530
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jefferson Davis,</v>

878
00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:34.500
<v Speaker 5>a stonewall Jackson didn't survive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Robert e Dot Lee and all these other</v>

879
00:35:34.501 --> 00:35:39.501
<v Speaker 5>guys just got away with it and actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>lived pretty prosperous lives </v>

880
00:35:39.501 --> 00:35:39.501
<v Speaker 5>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's always been this really</v>

881
00:35:39.501 --> 00:35:43.100
<v Speaker 3>complicated mix of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of remembrance that these people down </v>

882
00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:43.100
<v Speaker 3>there were heroes and we don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>support that.</v>

883
00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:47.961
<v Speaker 3>I certainly don't support that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it goes way further back than our </v>

884
00:35:47.961 --> 00:35:50.961
<v Speaker 3>contemporary culture and we can't just </v>
<v Speaker 3>smash it into oblivion and think that </v>

885
00:35:50.961 --> 00:35:54.141
<v Speaker 3>you're going to remove that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The heritage of the stars and bars and </v>

886
00:35:54.141 --> 00:35:54.141
<v Speaker 3>all of that from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from what happened.</v>

887
00:35:54.141 --> 00:35:58.460
<v Speaker 3>I think that the problem is people think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're celebrating the confederate </v>

888
00:35:58.460 --> 00:35:59.970
<v Speaker 3>army when you have a statue up and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>some ways you kind of.</v>

889
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
<v Speaker 3>It seems like you are right because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>statutes 15 feet tall and he's got a </v>

890
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.470
<v Speaker 3>sword in his hand and he's on a horse </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's marching forward and you know,</v>

891
00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:13.520
<v Speaker 3>people look at it as if it's celebrating</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's a horrible part of </v>

892
00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:14.360
<v Speaker 3>human culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

893
00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:16.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember going to Richmond,</v>

894
00:36:16.051 --> 00:36:17.370
<v Speaker 3>Virginia for the first time.</v>

895
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:17.910
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my fam.</v>

896
00:36:17.911 --> 00:36:20.670
<v Speaker 3>A lot of my family lives down there now </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have this thing called monument</v>

897
00:36:20.671 --> 00:36:25.671
<v Speaker 3>row or whatever where it's just a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like Jefferson Davis and Robert e </v>

898
00:36:25.671 --> 00:36:25.920
<v Speaker 3>Dot Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they actually put Arthur ash at</v>

899
00:36:25.921 --> 00:36:27.720
<v Speaker 3>the end to make it seem like it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>racist anymore.</v>

900
00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:33.560
<v Speaker 3>Which I always thought was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did that in like the seventies or </v>

901
00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:33.560
<v Speaker 3>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

902
00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.530
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's just like a black guy at the </v>

903
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:36.530
<v Speaker 3>end of it's like we were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't racist at all.</v>

904
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:37.590
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a bonus that he died of aids.</v>

905
00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.890
<v Speaker 3>So everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so everyone.</v>

906
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:41.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have a lot of diversity,</v>

907
00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.590
<v Speaker 3>HIV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>HIV culture and all that.</v>

908
00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:45.210
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

909
00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:47.100
<v Speaker 3>I remember being really confused when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a kid being like,</v>

910
00:36:47.101 --> 00:36:49.530
<v Speaker 3>why are these statutes here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This doesn't make any sense.</v>

911
00:36:49.531 --> 00:36:54.531
<v Speaker 3>And I agree that they shouldn't be in </v>
<v Speaker 3>those places of reverence because </v>

912
00:36:54.531 --> 00:36:56.310
<v Speaker 3>they're beyond the slavery issue.</v>

913
00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:01.500
<v Speaker 3>And I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Slavery was the reason the confederacy </v>

914
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.160
<v Speaker 3>was founded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does go back to state's rights and it</v>

915
00:37:02.161 --> 00:37:05.370
<v Speaker 3>has inherent economic benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is,</v>

916
00:37:05.371 --> 00:37:06.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stephen Douglas,</v>

917
00:37:06.331 --> 00:37:08.120
<v Speaker 3>who was the vice president of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>confederacy,</v>

918
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.200
<v Speaker 3>literally said that they were founded </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of this,</v>

919
00:37:10.201 --> 00:37:15.201
<v Speaker 3>so you can take his word for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was always confused why we were </v>

920
00:37:15.201 --> 00:37:15.201
<v Speaker 3>celebrating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

921
00:37:15.201 --> 00:37:17.490
<v Speaker 3>these people and why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not have these pieces of art because</v>

922
00:37:17.491 --> 00:37:19.410
<v Speaker 3>they are pieces of art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but have them in places that make sense.</v>

923
00:37:19.411 --> 00:37:21.000
<v Speaker 3>That give context,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

924
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:23.130
<v Speaker 3>so I have no problem with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

925
00:37:23.131 --> 00:37:28.131
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so tragically wrong about the </v>

926
00:37:28.131 --> 00:37:30.831
<v Speaker 3>slippery slope that we were finding </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves on because I thought people </v>

927
00:37:30.831 --> 00:37:30.831
<v Speaker 3>would see more of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

928
00:37:30.831 --> 00:37:34.360
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thomas Jefferson was a complicated man </v>

929
00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:34.360
<v Speaker 3>but also immensely important person to </v>
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

930
00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:34.900
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

931
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.170
<v Speaker 3>our society,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people aren't seeing it that way and</v>

932
00:37:37.171 --> 00:37:42.171
<v Speaker 3>I will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will fight more vociferously to </v>

933
00:37:42.171 --> 00:37:42.171
<v Speaker 3>protect those guys.</v>

934
00:37:42.171 --> 00:37:43.470
<v Speaker 3>Then I did the confederate confederate </v>
<v Speaker 3>officers for sure.</v>

935
00:37:43.471 --> 00:37:45.510
<v Speaker 3>Even though those guys did own slaves </v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

936
00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:46.180
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

937
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:49.290
<v Speaker 3>it is all weird when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about slave ownership.</v>

938
00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did this thing this morning,</v>

939
00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:53.700
<v Speaker 3>my kids school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have this great pumpkin day and all</v>

940
00:37:53.701 --> 00:37:56.790
<v Speaker 3>the kids are onstage and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have this little plate.</v>

941
00:37:56.791 --> 00:37:59.880
<v Speaker 3>They act out in one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about,</v>

942
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.780
<v Speaker 3>the smell of Apple Bacon and mmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody's like,</v>

943
00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:05.060
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the smell of applewood bacon.</v>

944
00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:10.370
<v Speaker 3>And all I could think of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because yesterday we were talking about </v>

945
00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:13.161
<v Speaker 3>factory farming and about Glenn </v>
<v Speaker 3>Greenwald article where I'm this FBI </v>

946
00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:19.460
<v Speaker 3>investigation to these two people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>stole these pigs from this factory farm </v>

947
00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:25.160
<v Speaker 3>revealed this federal coverup of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrific conditions in factory farms.</v>

948
00:38:26.611 --> 00:38:31.611
<v Speaker 3>And I was thinking of like one day we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to look at like factory farming </v>

949
00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:35.380
<v Speaker 3>and the horrific nature of what they do </v>
<v Speaker 3>to these animals,</v>

950
00:38:35.381 --> 00:38:36.370
<v Speaker 3>especially pigs.</v>

951
00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:41.840
<v Speaker 4>These really intelligent animals stuffed</v>
<v Speaker 4>into these boxes and make them live in </v>

952
00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:45.481
<v Speaker 4>their own shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's little corpses of piglets </v>

953
00:38:45.481 --> 00:38:48.181
<v Speaker 4>around them really for the article.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the photos were really hard to look </v>

954
00:38:48.181 --> 00:38:51.391
<v Speaker 4>at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was thinking while I was watching </v>

955
00:38:51.391 --> 00:38:51.391
<v Speaker 4>this little little kids play today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

956
00:38:51.391 --> 00:38:55.981
<v Speaker 4>one day we're going to look back at this</v>
<v Speaker 4>mention of Bacon and we're going to </v>

957
00:38:56.801 --> 00:39:01.801
<v Speaker 4>think like how fucked up where people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they thought it was okay to shove </v>

958
00:39:01.801 --> 00:39:06.061
<v Speaker 4>these little animals into these crates </v>
<v Speaker 4>and make them live in their own shit </v>

959
00:39:06.101 --> 00:39:11.101
<v Speaker 4>just so you can get bacon off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we've just sort of accepted that </v>

960
00:39:11.101 --> 00:39:13.600
<v Speaker 4>it's a part of our culture and that it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not a valid comparison to slavery,</v>

961
00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:18.960
<v Speaker 4>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not an ideal way for a conscious </v>

962
00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.490
<v Speaker 4>and evolving species like the human race</v>
<v Speaker 4>to behave.</v>

963
00:39:21.491 --> 00:39:24.010
<v Speaker 4>It's not a good way for us to </v>
<v Speaker 4>rationalize.</v>

964
00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:26.500
<v Speaker 4>And I was looking at that today and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was thinking,</v>

965
00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:31.770
<v Speaker 4>how many more of these things mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we're seeing that with things </v>

966
00:39:33.731 --> 00:39:38.410
<v Speaker 4>like the Harvey Weinstein allegations </v>
<v Speaker 4>and this outrageous coming forth.</v>

967
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:43.710
<v Speaker 4>I think we're seeing a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>aspects of our society that's getting </v>

968
00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:45.280
<v Speaker 4>exposed in a way that it never got </v>
<v Speaker 4>exposed before.</v>

969
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:49.300
<v Speaker 4>But I think we're also seeing it in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>mind,</v>

970
00:39:49.301 --> 00:39:51.490
<v Speaker 4>we were seeing it with this talk of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bacon.</v>

971
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:52.720
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

972
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:54.130
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bacon is delicious.</v>

973
00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:59.610
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But where the fuck's that bacon coming </v>

974
00:39:59.610 --> 00:39:59.610
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

975
00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:01.570
<v Speaker 4>how you making sure you're getting free </v>
<v Speaker 4>range bacon from,</v>

976
00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:02.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

977
00:40:02.441 --> 00:40:05.070
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>moral and ethical farming practice.</v>

978
00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.790
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you just getting bacon?</v>

979
00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:12.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's actually a very thought provoking </v>

980
00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:13.681
<v Speaker 5>what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I've always found the factory </v>

981
00:40:13.681 --> 00:40:15.691
<v Speaker 5>farming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not that I'm an expert in that at </v>

982
00:40:15.691 --> 00:40:15.691
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

983
00:40:15.691 --> 00:40:16.690
<v Speaker 5>but the argument to be really </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting because it's like there's an</v>

984
00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:21.720
<v Speaker 5>opportunity cost.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The way we treat these animals means </v>

985
00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:21.720
<v Speaker 5>food is very cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 5>way cheaper.</v>

986
00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:26.041
<v Speaker 5>Meat is incredibly cheap in the United </v>
<v Speaker 5>States compared to almost anywhere else </v>

987
00:40:26.041 --> 00:40:26.041
<v Speaker 5>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

988
00:40:26.041 --> 00:40:30.120
<v Speaker 5>and produces too because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people use to spend a third of their </v>

989
00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.570
<v Speaker 5>income before World War Two on food and </v>
<v Speaker 5>now they spend less than a 10th of their</v>

990
00:40:31.571 --> 00:40:33.370
<v Speaker 5>money on food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's some amazing.</v>

991
00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.920
<v Speaker 5>So there's an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we've made food way cheaper,</v>

992
00:40:35.921 --> 00:40:38.560
<v Speaker 5>but you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you could make the same argument</v>

993
00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:44.160
<v Speaker 5>for slavery in the sense that like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well look at all the economic benefits </v>

994
00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:44.160
<v Speaker 5>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

995
00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:48.451
<v Speaker 5>it kind of turned a blind eye to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you actually kind of like not just </v>

996
00:40:48.451 --> 00:40:52.440
<v Speaker 5>kind of changed my mind on a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I've always been of the mind </v>

997
00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:52.440
<v Speaker 5>where like free range eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>free range animals.</v>

998
00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:57.121
<v Speaker 5>That's great if you can afford that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't begrudge the poor or middle </v>

999
00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:58.810
<v Speaker 5>class or working class family from going</v>
<v Speaker 5>and buying their ground beef from vons.</v>

1000
00:40:58.900 --> 00:40:59.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well if you're poor,</v>

1001
00:40:59.741 --> 00:41:02.260
<v Speaker 5>you got to get by right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's that right.</v>

1002
00:41:02.261 --> 00:41:02.700
<v Speaker 5>And you're</v>

1003
00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:05.620
<v Speaker 4>system that you didn't design,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you didn't create.</v>

1004
00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:10.650
<v Speaker 4>You're just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in there and you're just trying </v>

1005
00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:10.650
<v Speaker 4>to get by.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I understand that,</v>

1006
00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:11.170
<v Speaker 4>but what I'm just saying that like as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole,</v>

1007
00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:16.350
<v Speaker 4>as a culture to just openly accept </v>
<v Speaker 4>factory farming and to not think of it </v>

1008
00:41:16.601 --> 00:41:21.010
<v Speaker 4>as a horrific ethical and moral </v>
<v Speaker 4>injustice.</v>

1009
00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:22.730
<v Speaker 4>I mean it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1010
00:41:22.731 --> 00:41:24.490
<v Speaker 4>mrs coming from someone who eats meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1011
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:27.850
<v Speaker 4>So obviously you could see the Vegan </v>
<v Speaker 4>argument would be,</v>

1012
00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:32.880
<v Speaker 4>well you're complicit in it and you are </v>
<v Speaker 4>also complicit in a bunch of other </v>

1013
00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.211
<v Speaker 4>horrific crimes against animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that what we're looking at </v>

1014
00:41:36.211 --> 00:41:39.440
<v Speaker 4>though is an under,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on wakening and sort of an understanding</v>

1015
00:41:39.441 --> 00:41:42.740
<v Speaker 4>of our impact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like physically our impact on this end,</v>

1016
00:41:42.741 --> 00:41:45.200
<v Speaker 4>but mentally the way we think about </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

1017
00:41:45.201 --> 00:41:50.201
<v Speaker 4>the way we even think about ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you know that your bacon is coming </v>

1018
00:41:50.201 --> 00:41:54.941
<v Speaker 4>from an animal that was tortured and </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoved into a cage and you buy it </v>

1019
00:41:54.941 --> 00:41:55.010
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1020
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.480
<v Speaker 4>whew.</v>

1021
00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:57.590
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

1022
00:41:57.591 --> 00:41:59.140
<v Speaker 4>what does that do to your mind?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1023
00:41:59.210 --> 00:41:59.900
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1024
00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:02.000
<v Speaker 4>it's sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a conundrum.</v>

1025
00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.290
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what you,</v>

1026
00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:05.390
<v Speaker 4>you obviously hunting stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you buy meat,</v>

1027
00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:08.000
<v Speaker 4>do you go out of your way to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's a by almost.</v>

1028
00:42:08.001 --> 00:42:08.420
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Me.</v>

1029
00:42:08.421 --> 00:42:13.421
<v Speaker 4>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you all that you eat is typically so </v>

1030
00:42:13.421 --> 00:42:13.970
<v Speaker 4>now it's taken a few years to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now,</v>

1031
00:42:13.971 --> 00:42:16.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean I shot to elk this year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>An elk is,</v>

1032
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:22.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're close to a thousand pounds so </v>

1033
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:24.611
<v Speaker 4>you're just seeing so many of hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 4>of pounds of meat and I have to </v>

1034
00:42:24.611 --> 00:42:25.190
<v Speaker 4>commercial freezers here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to have my garage at home.</v>

1035
00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:29.930
<v Speaker 4>I give it out to my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I eat elk four nights a week,</v>

1036
00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:32.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when I go out to dinner though,</v>

1037
00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.680
<v Speaker 4>I do eat steak,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1038
00:42:33.681 --> 00:42:35.120
<v Speaker 4>if I go out to dinner at some </v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurant,</v>

1039
00:42:35.121 --> 00:42:37.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't ask where it came from right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1040
00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:38.900
<v Speaker 4>So in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a hypocrite.</v>

1041
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:40.310
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not necessarily.</v>

1042
00:42:40.311 --> 00:42:40.700
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1043
00:42:40.701 --> 00:42:42.710
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think striving is important,</v>

1044
00:42:42.711 --> 00:42:44.200
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't always be perfect but,</v>

1045
00:42:44.201 --> 00:42:49.201
<v Speaker 4>but being better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if everyone was better as </v>

1046
00:42:49.201 --> 00:42:49.201
<v Speaker 4>opposed to being perfect than the </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation would be better.</v>

1047
00:42:49.201 --> 00:42:54.140
<v Speaker 4>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reality of there's an economic </v>

1048
00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:54.140
<v Speaker 4>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1049
00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:57.230
<v Speaker 4>I can take the time off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can take two weeks off out of the year</v>

1050
00:42:57.231 --> 00:43:00.040
<v Speaker 4>because I went to on to Elkanns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1051
00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:05.620
<v Speaker 4>I've been on for hunt's this year in </v>
<v Speaker 4>three of them I was successful and one </v>

1052
00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:09.140
<v Speaker 4>of them I got an access deer which was </v>
<v Speaker 4>also like 100 pounds of meat.</v>

1053
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:14.770
<v Speaker 4>And so that's most of what I eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but most people don't have time to take </v>

1054
00:43:15.771 --> 00:43:20.771
<v Speaker 4>three weeks off a year and then you also</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to have the time to practice and </v>

1055
00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:23.810
<v Speaker 4>you have to know people like a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>fortune,</v>

1056
00:43:23.811 --> 00:43:26.120
<v Speaker 4>good fortune on my side to be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like this.</v>

1057
00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:31.120
<v Speaker 4>But it's also a concerted effort and </v>
<v Speaker 4>becoming obsessed with the idea behind </v>

1058
00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.030
<v Speaker 4>it of doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1059
00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It becomes a different thing.</v>

1060
00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:36.920
<v Speaker 4>It who comes into like food is just a </v>
<v Speaker 4>different thing.</v>

1061
00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:38.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you grow tomatoes in your garden,</v>

1062
00:43:38.641 --> 00:43:41.240
<v Speaker 4>that food becomes a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like almost spiritual in a way.</v>

1063
00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:44.360
<v Speaker 4>You're like a connection to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an overused word,</v>

1064
00:43:44.361 --> 00:43:46.970
<v Speaker 4>spiritual kind of a word that's sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>been hijacked.</v>

1065
00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:47.990
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

1066
00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:49.220
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1067
00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:54.410
<v Speaker 4>like there's a little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of words that have been </v>

1068
00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:54.960
<v Speaker 4>hijacked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The word spirituality is really hijacked</v>

1069
00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:56.410
<v Speaker 4>by morons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1070
00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:58.370
<v Speaker 4>as someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really spiritual eyes.</v>

1071
00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:00.110
<v Speaker 4>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unfortunately,</v>

1072
00:44:00.111 --> 00:44:03.350
<v Speaker 4>tattoos and wouldn't beads and nutty </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk,</v>

1073
00:44:03.351 --> 00:44:05.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Reiki healers.</v>

1074
00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:07.130
<v Speaker 4>It was at the Golem Reiki,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1075
00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:07.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1076
00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:12.940
<v Speaker 4>those people that think they can heal </v>
<v Speaker 4>you by rubbing their hands above your </v>

1077
00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:14.840
<v Speaker 4>skin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that Reiki?</v>

1078
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.020
<v Speaker 4>Is that what they call it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1079
00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:17.630
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1080
00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:19.400
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

1081
00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:23.220
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a completion of the cycle in,</v>

1082
00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:24.020
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1083
00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:26.300
<v Speaker 4>in lieu of a better word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

1084
00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:31.310
<v Speaker 4>like I grow food in my backyard and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>grow plants and vegetables.</v>

1085
00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 4>I when I</v>

1086
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:37.100
<v Speaker 3>eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just feels like some sort of a </v>

1087
00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:37.100
<v Speaker 3>completion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it feels good,</v>

1088
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:40.680
<v Speaker 3>whereas it just feels like a good salad </v>
<v Speaker 3>if I get it at a store.</v>

1089
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:41.990
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1090
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:43.320
<v Speaker 3>it's a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

1091
00:44:43.321 --> 00:44:46.470
<v Speaker 3>You're almost subsistence living in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>way because you're hunting your own meat</v>

1092
00:44:46.471 --> 00:44:48.360
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're growing some of your own produce.</v>

1093
00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:49.650
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1094
00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:50.940
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder.</v>

1095
00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:54.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm just need the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need the grid for electricity.</v>

1096
00:44:54.421 --> 00:44:55.080
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1097
00:44:55.081 --> 00:44:57.090
<v Speaker 3>Someone's gotTa build the bows and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrows.</v>

1098
00:44:57.091 --> 00:45:01.500
<v Speaker 3>I buy from a manufacturer the yet you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>very strict tolerances.</v>

1099
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:03.300
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of subsistence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

1100
00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:08.330
<v Speaker 3>There's all these companies that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved behind creating the materials </v>

1101
00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:09.350
<v Speaker 3>that are used to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

1102
00:45:09.351 --> 00:45:12.750
<v Speaker 3>it's like capitalism is a slash sepsis a</v>
<v Speaker 3>subsistence,</v>

1103
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:14.550
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting because it's,</v>

1104
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:16.140
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the point I made earlier.</v>

1105
00:45:16.141 --> 00:45:20.670
<v Speaker 3>You're further along in the path of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sustainability or further along the path</v>

1106
00:45:20.671 --> 00:45:25.671
<v Speaker 3>of some sort of righteousness and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way animals are treated and all that </v>

1107
00:45:25.671 --> 00:45:25.671
<v Speaker 3>kind of stuff than a lot of people are.</v>

1108
00:45:25.671 --> 00:45:26.820
<v Speaker 3>So it's a step in the right direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1109
00:45:26.821 --> 00:45:29.850
<v Speaker 3>I just wonder if people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to play devil's advocate again,</v>

1110
00:45:29.851 --> 00:45:33.390
<v Speaker 3>the working class family that at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>median household income of $40,000</v>

1111
00:45:33.391 --> 00:45:34.950
<v Speaker 3>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they,</v>

1112
00:45:34.951 --> 00:45:37.860
<v Speaker 3>if we got rid of some of these animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>practices which are important,</v>

1113
00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:39.330
<v Speaker 3>but if we got rid of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1114
00:45:39.331 --> 00:45:41.880
<v Speaker 3>are they willing to pay 13 or $14 a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pound for their beef?</v>

1115
00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:44.610
<v Speaker 3>They probably couldn't afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a real problem.</v>

1116
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:49.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's absolutely a real problem and I </v>

1117
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.670
<v Speaker 3>think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1118
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:53.420
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that don't do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't even take it into </v>

1119
00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:53.420
<v Speaker 3>consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1120
00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:53.610
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1121
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:55.650
<v Speaker 3>that's probably the biggest problem that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've,</v>

1122
00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:59.100
<v Speaker 3>we've made this system and everybody who</v>
<v Speaker 3>was born into this system,</v>

1123
00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:00.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously we didn't create it,</v>

1124
00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:06.290
<v Speaker 3>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're born into a system and it took us </v>

1125
00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:08.451
<v Speaker 3>until we were probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know what a factory farm </v>

1126
00:46:08.451 --> 00:46:08.451
<v Speaker 3>was until I was 30.</v>

1127
00:46:08.451 --> 00:46:11.660
<v Speaker 3>I'd never even heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you hear about factory farming,</v>

1128
00:46:11.661 --> 00:46:11.930
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

1129
00:46:11.931 --> 00:46:13.620
<v Speaker 3>what does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think all these animals,</v>

1130
00:46:13.621 --> 00:46:14.970
<v Speaker 3>they all stuffed together and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1131
00:46:14.971 --> 00:46:16.620
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought the farms were like,</v>

1132
00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.830
<v Speaker 3>animals roamed around like I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what.</v>

1133
00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:21.630
<v Speaker 3>I never even thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1134
00:46:21.631 --> 00:46:23.700
<v Speaker 3>terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember in the late nineties on TV,</v>

1135
00:46:23.701 --> 00:46:25.360
<v Speaker 3>like on public access or on like I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

1136
00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:30.380
<v Speaker 3>I think it was just on public access.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would see these guerrilla filming </v>

1137
00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:33.741
<v Speaker 3>sessions that these guys would go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>these farms and like break in and take </v>

1138
00:46:33.741 --> 00:46:37.221
<v Speaker 3>all these pictures and it was like for </v>
<v Speaker 3>some animal rights activist group or </v>

1139
00:46:37.221 --> 00:46:37.221
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

1140
00:46:37.221 --> 00:46:37.350
<v Speaker 3>I was always familiar with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just never.</v>

1141
00:46:37.351 --> 00:46:42.351
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm guilty of saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never really thought about it too </v>

1142
00:46:42.351 --> 00:46:42.600
<v Speaker 3>deeply beyond that sadly because I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>

1143
00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.770
<v Speaker 3>I thought about the economic realities </v>
<v Speaker 3>of it where I'm like,</v>

1144
00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:47.790
<v Speaker 3>this is a terrible thing and we can fix </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1145
00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:49.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just have to have a conversation as a</v>

1146
00:46:49.231 --> 00:46:54.231
<v Speaker 3>society of what that's gonna mean for </v>
<v Speaker 3>food because the exact inverse has </v>

1147
00:46:54.231 --> 00:46:58.641
<v Speaker 3>happened with produce where we figured </v>
<v Speaker 3>out ways to really dramatically alter </v>

1148
00:46:58.641 --> 00:46:58.950
<v Speaker 3>seedlings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1149
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just reading about Norman Borlaug </v>

1150
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:04.020
<v Speaker 3>who won a Nobel peace prize for what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>did to wheat,</v>

1151
00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:06.640
<v Speaker 3>making wheat and we got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

1152
00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.460
<v Speaker 3>golden week I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what it is.</v>

1153
00:47:08.461 --> 00:47:10.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like where the protein and yeah,</v>

1154
00:47:10.351 --> 00:47:13.410
<v Speaker 3>and like a higher yield but the stock </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't collapse and all that.</v>

1155
00:47:13.411 --> 00:47:15.650
<v Speaker 3>And he's apparently responsible for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1156
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:20.990
<v Speaker 3>like there used to be these doomsday </v>
<v Speaker 3>prophecies in the sixties and seventies </v>

1157
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:24.201
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People forget that earth kind of golden </v>

1158
00:47:24.201 --> 00:47:24.201
<v Speaker 3>rice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking,</v>

1159
00:47:24.201 --> 00:47:24.201
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Different things.</v>

1160
00:47:24.201 --> 00:47:24.201
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>

1161
00:47:24.201 --> 00:47:28.480
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was this people look back at the </v>

1162
00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.570
<v Speaker 3>original Earth Day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in 1970 when they often talk </v>

1163
00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:31.270
<v Speaker 3>about some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the prognostications of what's happening</v>

1164
00:47:31.271 --> 00:47:36.271
<v Speaker 3>to the earth and all of that today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of people will lost sight of </v>

1165
00:47:36.271 --> 00:47:39.031
<v Speaker 3>the fact that a lot of what people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about then was that we were </v>

1166
00:47:39.031 --> 00:47:39.160
<v Speaker 3>going to die of famine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That the earth,</v>

1167
00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:44.250
<v Speaker 3>Earth's population was growing way too </v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly and that they would have these </v>

1168
00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:44.440
<v Speaker 3>guesses by the late seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early eighties and go read it.</v>

1169
00:47:44.441 --> 00:47:45.910
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would be like,</v>

1170
00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:50.940
<v Speaker 3>by 1980 5 billion people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>die of starvation because we can't feed </v>

1171
00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:52.150
<v Speaker 3>everyone and all these kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they were originally talking</v>

1172
00:47:52.151 --> 00:47:57.151
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's been these pioneering heroes </v>

1173
00:47:57.151 --> 00:47:57.940
<v Speaker 3>and agriculture that have figured it out</v>
<v Speaker 3>that have had these high yield crops and</v>

1174
00:47:57.941 --> 00:48:02.941
<v Speaker 3>all of that and we're fine with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because obviously crops flora are </v>

1175
00:48:02.941 --> 00:48:02.941
<v Speaker 3>different than Fonda.</v>

1176
00:48:02.941 --> 00:48:02.970
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1177
00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:07.980
<v Speaker 3>they don't feel they don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have some sort of connection </v>

1178
00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:07.980
<v Speaker 3>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have a brain.</v>

1179
00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:08.230
<v Speaker 3>So I understand the differences or are </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1180
00:48:08.231 --> 00:48:13.231
<v Speaker 3>but it's funny how these things have </v>
<v Speaker 3>totally basically switched sides where </v>

1181
00:48:13.231 --> 00:48:14.200
<v Speaker 3>now where you have these high yield </v>
<v Speaker 3>produce,</v>

1182
00:48:14.201 --> 00:48:16.240
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have these high yield ways of getting</v>

1183
00:48:16.241 --> 00:48:18.580
<v Speaker 3>animal meat but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no good.</v>

1184
00:48:18.581 --> 00:48:20.230
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that there are different things,</v>

1185
00:48:20.231 --> 00:48:23.800
<v Speaker 3>but does it suggest that we have to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>more Vegan or vegetarian?</v>

1186
00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:24.780
<v Speaker 3>All those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1187
00:48:24.781 --> 00:48:29.781
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we have to have a complicated </v>

1188
00:48:29.781 --> 00:48:31.210
<v Speaker 3>conversation and maybe it comes down to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea of cloning meeting or whatever</v>

1189
00:48:31.211 --> 00:48:32.440
<v Speaker 3>they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like making meat and you know,</v>

1190
00:48:32.441 --> 00:48:37.441
<v Speaker 3>process these weird chemical processes </v>
<v Speaker 3>to make beef that's indistinguishable </v>

1191
00:48:37.441 --> 00:48:37.441
<v Speaker 3>from real beef.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1192
00:48:37.441 --> 00:48:37.750
<v Speaker 3>that's fine if that.</v>

1193
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:42.750
<v Speaker 3>If it tastes good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's probably what's going to </v>

1194
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:45.091
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's probably going to be like </v>

1195
00:48:45.091 --> 00:48:45.091
<v Speaker 3>these headless cows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could just grow in a lab,</v>

1196
00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.350
<v Speaker 3>just sliced chunks off of them or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1197
00:48:47.351 --> 00:48:48.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how they're doing this meat</v>

1198
00:48:48.761 --> 00:48:53.761
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know either and I'm sure </v>

1199
00:48:53.761 --> 00:48:53.761
<v Speaker 3>it brings up a whole new slew of </v>
<v Speaker 3>bioethical questions too,</v>

1200
00:48:53.761 --> 00:48:55.760
<v Speaker 3>but that's just that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also probably health issues is probably.</v>

1201
00:48:55.761 --> 00:49:00.761
<v Speaker 3>I mean who's going to be the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>person to live 10 years off of that bio </v>

1202
00:49:00.761 --> 00:49:02.620
<v Speaker 3>meet before they figure out it causes </v>
<v Speaker 3>some inoperable colon cancer,</v>

1203
00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:07.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because your body doesn't know how to </v>

1204
00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:09.600
<v Speaker 3>process it correctly and it sticks to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the walls of your colon and starts </v>

1205
00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:13.411
<v Speaker 3>creating abscesses and they have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>remove your colon and make a new one </v>

1206
00:49:13.411 --> 00:49:15.460
<v Speaker 3>with stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cut you open like a fish and who's going</v>

1207
00:49:15.461 --> 00:49:17.980
<v Speaker 3>to ditch this new shitter inside of you?</v>

1208
00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:20.140
<v Speaker 3>Who's going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's going to be the Guinea pig?</v>

1209
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:23.950
<v Speaker 3>Someone will be as always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1210
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:26.380
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not everybody can go hunt wild animals.</v>

1211
00:49:26.381 --> 00:49:28.480
<v Speaker 3>And if you did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be no more wild animals.</v>

1212
00:49:28.481 --> 00:49:32.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's really what the great </v>
<v Speaker 3>market hunting of the um,</v>

1213
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:36.520
<v Speaker 3>the early 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's in the 18th century as well,</v>

1214
00:49:36.521 --> 00:49:38.530
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when they started that,</v>

1215
00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:43.960
<v Speaker 3>I think they started in the 17 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started hunting buffalo and antelope.</v>

1216
00:49:43.961 --> 00:49:48.700
<v Speaker 3>And by the time the early 19 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was almost like completely wiped out.</v>

1217
00:49:48.701 --> 00:49:52.540
<v Speaker 3>We had almost no animals left because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was from market hunting,</v>

1218
00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:57.580
<v Speaker 3>wasn't people hunting for their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal use is that they didn't have </v>

1219
00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:02.011
<v Speaker 3>refrigerators back then remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you had to get meat and it didn't </v>

1220
00:50:02.011 --> 00:50:05.311
<v Speaker 3>last very long and they had to get a new</v>
<v Speaker 3>supply of it constantly and they would </v>

1221
00:50:05.311 --> 00:50:09.421
<v Speaker 3>just go out and they would take these </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys that were from the war and they </v>

1222
00:50:09.421 --> 00:50:11.830
<v Speaker 3>didn't have jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this was their job.</v>

1223
00:50:11.831 --> 00:50:16.180
<v Speaker 3>Now they would go out and hunt antelope </v>
<v Speaker 3>and elk and deer and then sell that meat</v>

1224
00:50:16.181 --> 00:50:18.100
<v Speaker 3>at the market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what's interesting too about that is</v>

1225
00:50:18.101 --> 00:50:20.500
<v Speaker 3>that it's the human condition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not only like the more modern human</v>

1226
00:50:20.501 --> 00:50:22.600
<v Speaker 3>condition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm reading a book or I just read a book</v>

1227
00:50:22.601 --> 00:50:25.270
<v Speaker 3>called 1491,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is about the condition of the,</v>

1228
00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.890
<v Speaker 3>of north and South America and Central </v>
<v Speaker 3>America before,</v>

1229
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:30.590
<v Speaker 5>before Columbus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there was biking contact and stuff.</v>

1230
00:50:30.591 --> 00:50:31.690
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1231
00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.030
<v Speaker 5>and they were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1232
00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:35.950
<v Speaker 5>which is I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well known to a lot of people that,</v>

1233
00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:41.130
<v Speaker 5>that the native Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Paleo Indians wiped out tons of </v>

1234
00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:44.711
<v Speaker 5>animals before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when there was literally only a few </v>

1235
00:50:44.711 --> 00:50:44.711
<v Speaker 5>hundred thousand of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1236
00:50:44.711 --> 00:50:46.090
<v Speaker 5>because they were over hunting them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this,</v>

1237
00:50:46.091 --> 00:50:49.010
<v Speaker 5>this cycle continues know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>regardless,</v>

1238
00:50:49.011 --> 00:50:51.470
<v Speaker 5>and you even hear about that in Iceland </v>
<v Speaker 5>with a nurse that lived there,</v>

1239
00:50:51.471 --> 00:50:54.170
<v Speaker 5>were they like depleted there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're very precious woodstock there.</v>

1240
00:50:54.171 --> 00:50:59.171
<v Speaker 5>There's no animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of it's not just modern humans </v>

1241
00:50:59.171 --> 00:51:00.320
<v Speaker 5>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are challenged by this.</v>

1242
00:51:00.321 --> 00:51:00.920
<v Speaker 5>A lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1243
00:51:00.921 --> 00:51:05.921
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the woolly mammoth and all of these </v>

1244
00:51:05.921 --> 00:51:05.921
<v Speaker 5>animals were wiped out by humans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

1245
00:51:05.921 --> 00:51:05.921
<v Speaker 5>So it's very</v>

1246
00:51:05.921 --> 00:51:07.450
<v Speaker 4>virtual by the way that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is.</v>

1247
00:51:07.451 --> 00:51:12.451
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that believe </v>

1248
00:51:12.451 --> 00:51:14.561
<v Speaker 4>that that had to coincide because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dates coincide with the end of the ice </v>

1249
00:51:14.561 --> 00:51:18.510
<v Speaker 4>age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a guy that I've had on this </v>

1250
00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:20.521
<v Speaker 4>podcast several times named Randall </v>
<v Speaker 4>Carlson and he has some very compelling </v>

1251
00:51:20.521 --> 00:51:23.470
<v Speaker 4>evidence that points to the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it was asteroidal impact that,</v>

1252
00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:28.500
<v Speaker 4>that wiped out these animals and mass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's one of the reasons why in </v>

1253
00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:32.761
<v Speaker 4>certain parts of the world you could </v>
<v Speaker 4>find mass graveyards of animals that </v>

1254
00:51:32.761 --> 00:51:34.060
<v Speaker 4>were killed almost instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this was 10,000</v>

1255
00:51:34.061 --> 00:51:39.061
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>were saying interesting because I had </v>

1256
00:51:39.061 --> 00:51:39.061
<v Speaker 4>12,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

1257
00:51:39.061 --> 00:51:40.690
<v Speaker 4>They think there's two possible large </v>
<v Speaker 4>impacts that happened.</v>

1258
00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:42.130
<v Speaker 5>So they weren't bold lives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were,</v>

1259
00:51:42.131 --> 00:51:43.540
<v Speaker 5>they were actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they actually struck the.</v>

1260
00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:45.880
<v Speaker 5>So they weren't like the Tunguska event </v>
<v Speaker 5>with an explosion.</v>

1261
00:51:45.881 --> 00:51:46.390
<v Speaker 5>They actually hit.</v>

1262
00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:49.600
<v Speaker 4>They think it struck the ice sheet above</v>
<v Speaker 4>North America.</v>

1263
00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:50.110
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

1264
00:51:50.111 --> 00:51:51.550
<v Speaker 4>So there will be no evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1265
00:51:51.551 --> 00:51:56.551
<v Speaker 4>North America will though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They think that that was the reason why </v>

1266
00:51:56.551 --> 00:51:58.831
<v Speaker 4>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fascinating podcast to go back </v>

1267
00:51:58.831 --> 00:51:58.831
<v Speaker 4>and listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And He,</v>

1268
00:51:58.831 --> 00:52:03.031
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had him on with another guy named </v>

1269
00:52:03.031 --> 00:52:05.221
<v Speaker 4>Michael Shermer was a famous skeptic and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Graham Hancock who was also a proponent </v>

1270
00:52:05.221 --> 00:52:08.581
<v Speaker 4>of some of his ideas and they showed all</v>
<v Speaker 4>these images of like these deep fissures</v>

1271
00:52:09.911 --> 00:52:14.911
<v Speaker 4>that were cut into the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the land that must have been a </v>

1272
00:52:14.911 --> 00:52:15.910
<v Speaker 4>massive amount of water over a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>short period of time.</v>

1273
00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:21.240
<v Speaker 4>And he thinks it was probably a large </v>
<v Speaker 4>body that slammed into the polarized </v>

1274
00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:24.850
<v Speaker 4>caps are slammed into rather the ice </v>
<v Speaker 4>caps that are above,</v>

1275
00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:25.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>North America,</v>

1276
00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:29.020
<v Speaker 4>somewhere around 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago at two miles high of ice,</v>

1277
00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:32.350
<v Speaker 4>over much of the surface of it and all </v>
<v Speaker 4>sudden boom,</v>

1278
00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:32.800
<v Speaker 4>gone.</v>

1279
00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:38.070
<v Speaker 4>And that's what caused the Great Lakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Great Lakes are essentially these </v>

1280
00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:43.020
<v Speaker 4>gigantic glaciers that melted and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's all sorts of features in these </v>

1281
00:52:44.021 --> 00:52:49.021
<v Speaker 4>various landscapes that he believes </v>
<v Speaker 4>point to massive amounts of water that </v>

1282
00:52:49.021 --> 00:52:52.000
<v Speaker 4>happened over an incredibly short period</v>
<v Speaker 4>of time and the explanation for that and</v>

1283
00:52:52.001 --> 00:52:57.001
<v Speaker 4>the peaks in the rises and the falls in </v>
<v Speaker 4>temperature during that time when they </v>

1284
00:52:57.851 --> 00:53:02.851
<v Speaker 4>do like a core samples of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he thinks that that also points to some </v>

1285
00:53:02.851 --> 00:53:04.470
<v Speaker 4>sort of an impact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fascinating.</v>

1286
00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:09.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Randall Carlson studying this his whole </v>

1287
00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:11.560
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had an idea once when he was on acid.</v>

1288
00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:16.590
<v Speaker 4>He went and looked at this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a gigantic canyon when he was on acid </v>

1289
00:53:16.590 --> 00:53:19.600
<v Speaker 4>and he had this idea that this all </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened because of water.</v>

1290
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:24.870
<v Speaker 4>It was trying to piece it together and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then it became fascinating and started </v>

1291
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 4>studying it and then</v>

1292
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.840
<v Speaker 2>got really into asteroidal impacts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a wealth of knowledge but really,</v>

1293
00:53:30.841 --> 00:53:32.200
<v Speaker 2>really fast and you've got to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1294
00:53:32.201 --> 00:53:33.360
<v Speaker 2>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that stuff,</v>

1295
00:53:33.361 --> 00:53:38.361
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's so frustrating and why I </v>

1296
00:53:38.361 --> 00:53:40.341
<v Speaker 2>didn't study in college are really super</v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in ancient history or even,</v>

1297
00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:45.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paleo history in prehuman history and </v>

1298
00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:45.530
<v Speaker 2>stuff because it's also hypothetical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll never really know.</v>

1299
00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:50.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to just kind of trust people </v>

1300
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.510
<v Speaker 2>much smarter than you that they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1301
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:51.810
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these good ideas that sometimes conflict</v>

1302
00:53:51.811 --> 00:53:53.370
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you'll never really know the answer.</v>

1303
00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:54.690
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so frustrating to me.</v>

1304
00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Those ideas definitely do conflict here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the area that he looked over </v>

1305
00:53:59.930 --> 00:53:59.930
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>place them in,</v>

1306
00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:00.570
<v Speaker 2>so you get some volume on this.</v>

1307
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:10.670
<v Speaker 6>Probably Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 6>based upon the president flood,</v>

1308
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:37.990
<v Speaker 6>he had the flood that a few days a week </v>
<v Speaker 6>whenever they would not have been washed</v>

1309
00:54:42.671 --> 00:54:42.940
<v Speaker 6>away,</v>

1310
00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:48.710
<v Speaker 2>a long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long detailed thing.</v>

1311
00:54:48.711 --> 00:54:52.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's talked about on the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>for hours and hours.</v>

1312
00:54:52.011 --> 00:54:53.960
<v Speaker 2>I've had them on several times and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>still.</v>

1313
00:54:53.961 --> 00:54:57.110
<v Speaker 2>There's still a lot of information to </v>
<v Speaker 2>cover because this guy has been studying</v>

1314
00:54:57.111 --> 00:54:58.700
<v Speaker 2>this as whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to look into that.</v>

1315
00:54:58.701 --> 00:55:03.701
<v Speaker 2>That sounds interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely positive that humans had an </v>

1316
00:55:03.701 --> 00:55:05.990
<v Speaker 2>impact on wooly mammoths and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>other animals,</v>

1317
00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:09.920
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

1318
00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:14.980
<v Speaker 2>very hesitant to blame the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>radication of these animals on people.</v>

1319
00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:17.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1320
00:55:17.091 --> 00:55:19.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do recommend the book though.</v>

1321
00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Digit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just an interesting insight into a 1491.</v>

1322
00:55:21.681 --> 00:55:23.300
<v Speaker 2>It's called just an interesting insight </v>
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>

1323
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:28.870
<v Speaker 2>into agriculture and so just some ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of cobbled together some sort </v>

1324
00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:31.460
<v Speaker 2>of like vision of this place before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1325
00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:34.340
<v Speaker 2>mainstream European contact because </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously a few places that I would.</v>

1326
00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you had a time machine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've always thought about this,</v>

1327
00:55:36.921 --> 00:55:41.921
<v Speaker 2>like if you could go in some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>invisible bubble and experience the </v>

1328
00:55:41.921 --> 00:55:43.400
<v Speaker 2>earth at various stages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two,</v>

1329
00:55:43.450 --> 00:55:48.450
<v Speaker 2>two things I would love to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to see during the great </v>

1330
00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:48.450
<v Speaker 2>pyramids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when,</v>

1331
00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:49.370
<v Speaker 2>when they were in their prime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to see what it,</v>

1332
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:54.390
<v Speaker 2>what was Egypt actually like before they</v>
<v Speaker 2>burned the library of Alexandria and I </v>

1333
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:58.601
<v Speaker 2>would have loved to have seen a native </v>
<v Speaker 2>tribe in North America.</v>

1334
00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:00.790
<v Speaker 2>Pre colonization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1335
00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:06.280
<v Speaker 2>It'd be fascinating and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>frustrating thing is we'll never really </v>

1336
00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:06.380
<v Speaker 2>quite know the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

1337
00:56:06.381 --> 00:56:09.420
<v Speaker 2>It's fun to speculate about and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading it.</v>

1338
00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:12.320
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd find interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading about the Easter islanders</v>

1339
00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:18.100
<v Speaker 2>and how they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have sweet potatoes on the island </v>

1340
00:56:18.651 --> 00:56:23.651
<v Speaker 2>which are not indigenous to the island </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the sweet potato to kind of spread </v>

1341
00:56:23.651 --> 00:56:24.370
<v Speaker 2>around Polynesia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>presumably from South America</v>

1342
00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:27.460
<v Speaker 5>and there's this interesting thing that </v>
<v Speaker 5>the name,</v>

1343
00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:28.900
<v Speaker 5>the word,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember the exact word,</v>

1344
00:56:28.901 --> 00:56:33.901
<v Speaker 5>but the word that many Polynesians are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Many Polynesian societies that were </v>

1345
00:56:33.901 --> 00:56:35.560
<v Speaker 5>separated from each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Use for the sweet potato is identical to</v>

1346
00:56:35.561 --> 00:56:40.080
<v Speaker 5>what they were using on the South </v>
<v Speaker 5>American mainland indicating that the,</v>

1347
00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:42.190
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The islands might've been populated from</v>

1348
00:56:42.191 --> 00:56:47.191
<v Speaker 5>the other direction that they assume </v>
<v Speaker 5>that people came down from like what is </v>

1349
00:56:47.191 --> 00:56:50.641
<v Speaker 5>I guess like Indonesia and to Australia </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then kind of hopped over to those </v>

1350
00:56:50.641 --> 00:56:53.731
<v Speaker 5>islands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But people are suggesting that there </v>

1351
00:56:53.731 --> 00:56:55.021
<v Speaker 5>must've been contact from Paleo </v>
<v Speaker 5>Americans on those islands because they </v>

1352
00:56:55.021 --> 00:56:59.311
<v Speaker 5>eat sweet potatoes which are indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 5>to South America and they call them the </v>

1353
00:56:59.311 --> 00:57:02.101
<v Speaker 5>same exact thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That the societies that we're thousands </v>

1354
00:57:02.101 --> 00:57:02.260
<v Speaker 5>of miles apart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1355
00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:03.550
<v Speaker 5>had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had experienced,</v>

1356
00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:07.660
<v Speaker 5>and you hear a lot about a lot of this </v>
<v Speaker 5>was there cross transatlantic contact,</v>

1357
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:13.710
<v Speaker 5>could that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then it gets into crazy like </v>

1358
00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:13.710
<v Speaker 5>conspiracy theories about the pyramids </v>
<v Speaker 5>and stuff,</v>

1359
00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:14.440
<v Speaker 5>but were there with the phoenicians come</v>
<v Speaker 5>over where,</v>

1360
00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:17.920
<v Speaker 5>where the Egyptian contact to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Chinese come here that the Romans,</v>

1361
00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.330
<v Speaker 5>I remember that there was this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1362
00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:24.690
<v Speaker 5>this theory that Romans might've been on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Pacific coast of North America </v>

1363
00:57:24.690 --> 00:57:24.690
<v Speaker 5>because they found,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1364
00:57:24.970 --> 00:57:26.590
<v Speaker 5>I guess they apparently found some </v>
<v Speaker 5>coins,</v>

1365
00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:31.800
<v Speaker 5>Roman coins and they found these jars </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I guess were ancient Roman are or </v>

1366
00:57:32.830 --> 00:57:35.490
<v Speaker 5>supposedly ancient Roman anchors for </v>
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

1367
00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:37.260
<v Speaker 4>I've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>

1368
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:38.740
<v Speaker 4>these are recent discoveries.</v>

1369
00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:40.680
<v Speaker 5>I think so over the last 10 years maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1370
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:44.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the human history is,</v>

1371
00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:45.540
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1372
00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:50.640
<v Speaker 4>kind of pieced together by what we find </v>
<v Speaker 4>and every now and then they find </v>

1373
00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:50.640
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they go,</v>

1374
00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:51.390
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1375
00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:52.230
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1376
00:57:52.231 --> 00:57:55.710
<v Speaker 4>what's really crazy is that the native </v>
<v Speaker 4>Americans,</v>

1377
00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:58.110
<v Speaker 4>when the settlers got here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when Europeans got here,</v>

1378
00:57:58.111 --> 00:58:03.111
<v Speaker 4>they didn't have horses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but horses actually evolved in North </v>

1379
00:58:03.111 --> 00:58:05.160
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Horses evolved in North America and then</v>

1380
00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:10.220
<v Speaker 4>by crossing the bering land mass made </v>
<v Speaker 4>their way into Asia and all throughout </v>

1381
00:58:10.711 --> 00:58:12.300
<v Speaker 4>the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even zebras,</v>

1382
00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:14.850
<v Speaker 4>they originally started in North America</v>
<v Speaker 4>wild,</v>

1383
00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:20.060
<v Speaker 4>but then somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so for some reason they went extinct in </v>

1384
00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:24.531
<v Speaker 4>North America and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they survived and thrived in Europe and </v>

1385
00:58:24.531 --> 00:58:28.020
<v Speaker 4>then they were reintroduced and Dan </v>
<v Speaker 4>Flores,</v>

1386
00:58:28.021 --> 00:58:33.021
<v Speaker 4>he's a wildlife historian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He maintains that the native Americans </v>

1387
00:58:33.021 --> 00:58:36.780
<v Speaker 4>once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once they had firearms and the horse,</v>

1388
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:39.570
<v Speaker 4>that they would have wiped out the </v>
<v Speaker 4>buffalo on their own.</v>

1389
00:58:39.810 --> 00:58:44.810
<v Speaker 4>That it had nothing to do with like </v>
<v Speaker 4>market hunting and all the things that </v>

1390
00:58:44.810 --> 00:58:47.430
<v Speaker 4>the Europeans did was terrible and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened quite rapidly,</v>

1391
00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:51.150
<v Speaker 4>but he maintains that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was gonna happen anyway.</v>

1392
00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:56.240
<v Speaker 4>Just just the nature of what kind of an </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal it was and that humans were </v>

1393
00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:56.970
<v Speaker 4>eventually going to get to them anyway.</v>

1394
00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:02.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's what we were talking </v>

1395
00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:02.460
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the human condition and how things don't</v>

1396
00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:02.830
<v Speaker 5>seem to change regardless of who you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about.</v>

1397
00:59:02.831 --> 00:59:06.460
<v Speaker 5>And I'm always fascinated by these </v>
<v Speaker 5>gentle kind of connections between these</v>

1398
00:59:06.461 --> 00:59:11.461
<v Speaker 5>different societies that we're learning </v>
<v Speaker 5>more and more about that the world is </v>

1399
00:59:11.461 --> 00:59:12.160
<v Speaker 5>way smaller than I think we thought it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was in antiquity.</v>

1400
00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:13.660
<v Speaker 5>And even before that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1401
00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:19.500
<v Speaker 5>they were talking about how some </v>
<v Speaker 5>greenland and Newfoundland and New </v>

1402
00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:25.020
<v Speaker 5>Brunswick and all of these kind of had </v>
<v Speaker 5>these Indian tribes that definitely </v>

1403
00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:26.150
<v Speaker 5>probably had extended contact with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>vikings for a long period of time.</v>

1404
00:59:26.151 --> 00:59:31.151
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and these words kind of find their way </v>

1405
00:59:31.151 --> 00:59:31.151
<v Speaker 5>to like the St Lawrence Valley that </v>
<v Speaker 5>describe the same things.</v>

1406
00:59:31.151 --> 00:59:33.260
<v Speaker 5>And then when the French fur traders </v>
<v Speaker 5>come,</v>

1407
00:59:33.261 --> 00:59:35.840
<v Speaker 5>they find that they're using words that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they shouldn't know.</v>

1408
00:59:35.841 --> 00:59:37.180
<v Speaker 5>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1409
00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:38.760
<v Speaker 5>it's super fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the,</v>

1410
00:59:38.810 --> 00:59:43.810
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these brilliant scholars that kind of </v>

1411
00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:43.810
<v Speaker 5>put these things together for us to </v>
<v Speaker 5>write about.</v>

1412
00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:43.810
<v Speaker 4>It is amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1413
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:47.260
<v Speaker 4>and just think of how much we don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>

1414
00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:52.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean God to be able to go back 60,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago and just be a fly on the wall </v>

1415
00:59:53.591 --> 00:59:57.130
<v Speaker 4>and some ancient civilization and see </v>
<v Speaker 4>how they interact with each other.</v>

1416
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:58.190
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>awesome.</v>

1417
00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:00.350
<v Speaker 5>That will be honest with you even read </v>
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>

1418
01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:02.450
<v Speaker 5>There were these great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's outside of St Louis,</v>

1419
01:00:02.451 --> 01:00:04.100
<v Speaker 5>I think it's like Cahokia or something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

1420
01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:07.880
<v Speaker 5>It was this massive native American </v>
<v Speaker 5>metropolis in North America.</v>

1421
01:00:07.881 --> 01:00:10.070
<v Speaker 5>We often think about central and South </v>
<v Speaker 5>America is having these may,</v>

1422
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:11.030
<v Speaker 5>Aztec,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Inca,</v>

1423
01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:16.300
<v Speaker 5>all these major cities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there were major mountain cities in </v>

1424
01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:16.970
<v Speaker 5>North America that were populated by </v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe 25,</v>

1425
01:00:16.971 --> 01:00:19.280
<v Speaker 5>30,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>people and they were wiped out before we</v>

1426
01:00:19.281 --> 01:00:22.010
<v Speaker 5>even got here or before our European </v>
<v Speaker 5>ancestors got here.</v>

1427
01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:24.560
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's so god,</v>

1428
01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:29.650
<v Speaker 5>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it would just be so interesting </v>

1429
01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:29.650
<v Speaker 5>to see how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do they live,</v>

1430
01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:29.650
<v Speaker 5>how do they farm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how,</v>

1431
01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:30.780
<v Speaker 5>what was their commerce lake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1432
01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:31.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what was their languages like,</v>

1433
01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:32.630
<v Speaker 5>did they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did they,</v>

1434
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:34.490
<v Speaker 5>did they have written records that </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't survive?</v>

1435
01:00:34.491 --> 01:00:36.170
<v Speaker 5>And I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But again,</v>

1436
01:00:36.171 --> 01:00:41.171
<v Speaker 5>that ties back into a venn diagram of </v>
<v Speaker 5>frustration because you'll never really </v>

1437
01:00:41.171 --> 01:00:41.171
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>

1438
01:00:41.171 --> 01:00:45.100
<v Speaker 4>There's a ranch up in central California</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I go to sometimes called to hone </v>

1439
01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:48.650
<v Speaker 4>ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's these stone circles that are</v>

1440
01:00:48.651 --> 01:00:51.980
<v Speaker 4>carved in rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they have these massive rocks.</v>

1441
01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:56.981
<v Speaker 4>And then there's like these concave,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like dug outs where they would make </v>

1442
01:00:57.651 --> 01:00:58.940
<v Speaker 4>bread.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're,</v>

1443
01:00:58.941 --> 01:01:03.941
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at places where they </v>
<v Speaker 4>would grind grain into these rocks and </v>

1444
01:01:03.951 --> 01:01:05.030
<v Speaker 4>these holes are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1445
01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:10.090
<v Speaker 4>who knows how long they existed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows how long ago these subsistence</v>

1446
01:01:11.691 --> 01:01:13.900
<v Speaker 4>farmers or subsistence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1447
01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:17.150
<v Speaker 4>people lived there and did this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you're,</v>

1448
01:01:17.151 --> 01:01:19.850
<v Speaker 4>you're stepping over these rocks and </v>
<v Speaker 4>staring down on.</v>

1449
01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:24.880
<v Speaker 4>There's some getty images of him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those holes were carved by the native </v>

1450
01:01:26.451 --> 01:01:31.451
<v Speaker 4>Americans and they were done over </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking years and years of grinding </v>

1451
01:01:31.451 --> 01:01:35.411
<v Speaker 4>stones into the stone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And know what's interesting is a lot of </v>

1452
01:01:35.411 --> 01:01:40.091
<v Speaker 4>the ancient Egyptians I went to see the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mummy exhibit at the Natural National </v>

1453
01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:43.040
<v Speaker 4>Natural History Museum or the Science </v>
<v Speaker 4>Museum.</v>

1454
01:01:43.041 --> 01:01:45.350
<v Speaker 4>Which one is it in California?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

1455
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:50.770
<v Speaker 4>they had a museum exhibit on mummies and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they said all their teeth were ground </v>

1456
01:01:50.770 --> 01:01:54.971
<v Speaker 4>down and it's because when they would </v>
<v Speaker 4>make their bread and they would grind </v>

1457
01:01:54.971 --> 01:01:57.770
<v Speaker 4>stone and the stone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would create sand and that sand would</v>

1458
01:01:57.771 --> 01:02:02.480
<v Speaker 4>be in the bread interested to be eating </v>
<v Speaker 4>this gritty sandy bread.</v>

1459
01:02:02.930 --> 01:02:04.400
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what they ate.</v>

1460
01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:07.130
<v Speaker 4>And they would just chew their fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>teeth away to nothing.</v>

1461
01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.310
<v Speaker 5>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1462
01:02:08.311 --> 01:02:08.580
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1463
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:12.200
<v Speaker 5>it's this marriage of archeology and </v>
<v Speaker 5>anthropology and sociology.</v>

1464
01:02:12.201 --> 01:02:15.710
<v Speaker 5>Even that gives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm always disconcerted that more people</v>

1465
01:02:15.711 --> 01:02:18.740
<v Speaker 5>don't find this fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a real student of history.</v>

1466
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you really love history.</v>

1467
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:20.730
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

1468
01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:26.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was a really interesting </v>

1469
01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:26.030
<v Speaker 3>subject when you and I were talking the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first time you,</v>

1470
01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:27.750
<v Speaker 3>you and you were a young guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you embrace it,</v>

1471
01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:28.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's fascinating.</v>

1472
01:02:28.921 --> 01:02:30.150
<v Speaker 3>Someone has to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

1473
01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:33.930
<v Speaker 3>it's not practical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always tell people people have gone,</v>

1474
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the years,</v>

1475
01:02:34.831 --> 01:02:39.831
<v Speaker 3>fans of mine have gone to school for </v>
<v Speaker 3>history and asked me should I study </v>

1476
01:02:39.831 --> 01:02:40.050
<v Speaker 3>history and politics and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

1477
01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:41.280
<v Speaker 3>I think you should do what makes you </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy.</v>

1478
01:02:41.281 --> 01:02:46.281
<v Speaker 3>I think it would be much wiser for you </v>
<v Speaker 3>to study pharmacy or chemistry or </v>

1479
01:02:46.281 --> 01:02:50.061
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's not a lot of money in </v>

1480
01:02:50.061 --> 01:02:50.061
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1481
01:02:50.061 --> 01:02:50.061
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1482
01:02:50.061 --> 01:02:50.700
<v Speaker 3>I remember when I was about to start </v>
<v Speaker 3>Grad school when I,</v>

1483
01:02:50.701 --> 01:02:52.830
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I got my job in the gaming industry</v>

1484
01:02:52.831 --> 01:02:54.700
<v Speaker 3>and I left and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember,</v>

1485
01:02:54.701 --> 01:02:59.701
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>professors being like 50 percent of all </v>

1486
01:02:59.701 --> 01:03:01.821
<v Speaker 3>history phd is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will never find a job in the field 50 </v>

1487
01:03:01.821 --> 01:03:03.150
<v Speaker 3>percent because there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the same thing with archeology.</v>

1488
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:07.500
<v Speaker 3>Like I played around with the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing like a American archeology,</v>

1489
01:03:07.501 --> 01:03:09.780
<v Speaker 3>which is a growing movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're digging up Jamestown there,</v>

1490
01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:10.310
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1491
01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:12.570
<v Speaker 3>all those kinds of things and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just no money in it,</v>

1492
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:13.500
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1493
01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:14.880
<v Speaker 3>and so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to just,</v>

1494
01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:20.240
<v Speaker 3>I want people to just love history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the way I love it and understand </v>

1495
01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.061
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think a lot of it is because it's </v>

1496
01:03:23.061 --> 01:03:24.471
<v Speaker 3>not told well it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The stories dates and times are </v>

1497
01:03:24.471 --> 01:03:28.041
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember them and I think I have that </v>

1498
01:03:28.041 --> 01:03:28.041
<v Speaker 3>kind of brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that right,</v>

1499
01:03:28.041 --> 01:03:28.260
<v Speaker 3>that kind of right centered brain where </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1500
01:03:28.261 --> 01:03:33.261
<v Speaker 3>I remember facts and dates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not really what's important </v>

1501
01:03:33.261 --> 01:03:35.721
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if people taught history Morris </v>

1502
01:03:35.721 --> 01:03:36.510
<v Speaker 3>stories than which I think is what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to do with my show,</v>

1503
01:03:36.511 --> 01:03:38.610
<v Speaker 3>then I think that people will enjoy it </v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

1504
01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:41.250
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's like the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 3>pleasure of what I do with people saying</v>

1505
01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:42.240
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate history.</v>

1506
01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:44.040
<v Speaker 3>I hated history of God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was so boring,</v>

1507
01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:45.360
<v Speaker 3>but this is such,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is so interesting.</v>

1508
01:03:45.361 --> 01:03:47.760
<v Speaker 3>Thank you for bringing this to my </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>

1509
01:03:47.761 --> 01:03:48.420

1511
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:53.710

<v Speaker 3>are interesting and they're important.</v>

1512
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:57.570
<v Speaker 3>They are important in how many people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are taking advantage of that?</v>

1513
01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:00.720
<v Speaker 3>How many people are passing these </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories around?</v>

1536
01:04:38.511 --> 01:04:41.450
<v Speaker 3>and I think they smell gross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I see people taking a big drag of </v>

1537
01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:42.900

1540
01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:50.030
<v Speaker 3>I always see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always see people outside of work in </v>

1541
01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:51.741
<v Speaker 3>my neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You kind of get to know the characters </v>

1542
01:04:51.741 --> 01:04:51.741
<v Speaker 3>in your neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1543
01:04:51.741 --> 01:04:51.741
<v Speaker 3>And they're always standing outside </v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking,</v>

1544
01:04:51.741 --> 01:04:51.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having a little more time.</v>

1545
01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:53.610
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1546
01:04:53.611 --> 01:04:57.140
<v Speaker 3>I smoked one of Tony Hinchcliffe </v>
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes before a show once a,</v>

1547
01:04:57.141 --> 01:04:59.190
<v Speaker 3>I think I've done it twice now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1548
01:04:59.191 --> 01:05:00.170
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

1549
01:05:00.370 --> 01:05:03.270
<v Speaker 3>it's a real cognitive booster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1550
01:05:03.271 --> 01:05:05.550
<v Speaker 3>it really does stimulate you in a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>strange way.</v>

1551
01:05:05.551 --> 01:05:06.210
<v Speaker 3>Thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sir.</v>

1552
01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:07.890
<v Speaker 3>Do you think you were better when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>after,</v>

1553
01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.260
<v Speaker 3>after having what's better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1554
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:13.680
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you're not bitter stimulated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially doing standup.</v>

1555
01:05:13.690 --> 01:05:16.970
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you're better balanced and </v>
<v Speaker 3>calm you,</v>

1556
01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 3>but it's</v>

1557
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:18.910
<v Speaker 4>mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1558
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.280
<v Speaker 4>it definitely stimulates you in some </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of a weird way.</v>

1559
01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:22.260
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whew.</v>

1560
01:05:22.261 --> 01:05:25.570
<v Speaker 4>So like a different sort of feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you ever smoked a cigar.</v>

1561
01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:26.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1562
01:05:26.471 --> 01:05:27.530
<v Speaker 4>You get high off cigar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1563
01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:30.370
<v Speaker 4>I can only smoke half of it or actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>start to get like almost nauseous.</v>

1564
01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:31.870
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get high,</v>

1565
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:36.880
<v Speaker 4>like the nicotine and a fat stokey </v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely gets you high.</v>

1566
01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:38.860
<v Speaker 4>There's something to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes me think about these old,</v>

1567
01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.500
<v Speaker 4>these old timers are people still do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my friend growing up,</v>

1568
01:05:41.501 --> 01:05:46.501
<v Speaker 4>his GRANDPA would always.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That smell reminds me of him because </v>

1569
01:05:46.501 --> 01:05:46.501
<v Speaker 4>he'd always just sit on the porch and </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoke,</v>

1570
01:05:46.501 --> 01:05:49.930
<v Speaker 4>but it just chain smoke like cigars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And how are you not animals people.</v>

1571
01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:51.790
<v Speaker 4>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I uh,</v>

1572
01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:52.770
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>

1573
01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:57.900
<v Speaker 4>How is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were doing the sober thing for the </v>

1574
01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:57.900
<v Speaker 4>sober October.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So today's the last day.</v>

1575
01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:00.820
<v Speaker 4>How do you feel about saying I'm nervous</v>
<v Speaker 4>devers smoke pot again?</v>

1576
01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:06.100
<v Speaker 4>Tell you that God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't gotten more than two days </v>

1577
01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:06.100
<v Speaker 4>without smoking pot in 15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I don't even know.</v>

1578
01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:07.330
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you the big,</v>

1579
01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:11.650
<v Speaker 4>the big change is your sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have radical dreams.</v>

1580
01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.210
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1581
01:06:12.350 --> 01:06:15.520
<v Speaker 4>Radical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really realistic.</v>

1582
01:06:15.850 --> 01:06:19.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dreams were in the middle of the dream.</v>

1583
01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:24.241
<v Speaker 4>You don't realize that it's a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I had a dream that I was lying on </v>

1584
01:06:24.241 --> 01:06:27.601
<v Speaker 4>this couch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a couch that actually exists a couch in </v>

1585
01:06:27.601 --> 01:06:30.571
<v Speaker 4>my house and that I was cold so I </v>
<v Speaker 4>grabbed this blanket and I was pulling </v>

1586
01:06:30.571 --> 01:06:32.410
<v Speaker 4>the blanket over me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the blanket was kind of stuck in the</v>

1587
01:06:32.411 --> 01:06:37.411
<v Speaker 4>pillows so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like kind of struggled with it and get </v>

1588
01:06:37.411 --> 01:06:41.641
<v Speaker 4>the blanket over you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I woke up and there's no </v>

1589
01:06:41.641 --> 01:06:41.641
<v Speaker 4>fucking blanket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1590
01:06:41.641 --> 01:06:41.641
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>

1591
01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:45.370
<v Speaker 4>Like I dreamt that I was pulling a </v>
<v Speaker 4>blanket.</v>

1592
01:06:45.371 --> 01:06:50.371
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was so realistic that I would have </v>

1593
01:06:50.371 --> 01:06:53.881
<v Speaker 4>sworn if I woke up that I had struggled </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get that blanket over me while I was </v>

1594
01:06:54.041 --> 01:06:59.041
<v Speaker 4>taking a nap on the couch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was no fucking blanket I was </v>

1595
01:06:59.041 --> 01:07:02.461
<v Speaker 4>reading and as I was reading I decided I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was going to lie down right here and </v>

1596
01:07:02.461 --> 01:07:05.971
<v Speaker 4>sleep and I must have passed out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>decided that I was cold and went through</v>

1597
01:07:07.601 --> 01:07:11.410
<v Speaker 4>this elaborate dream sequence where I </v>
<v Speaker 4>pulled a blanket over me,</v>

1598
01:07:11.770 --> 01:07:16.770
<v Speaker 4>but I was convinced that I had woken up </v>
<v Speaker 4>cold and had to adjust and pull the </v>

1599
01:07:16.770 --> 01:07:19.090
<v Speaker 4>blanket over me and went back to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's mainly very vivid,</v>

1600
01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:24.600
<v Speaker 4>fucking super vivid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was no blanket anywhere near </v>

1601
01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:27.481
<v Speaker 4>me when I woke up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's just fucking couch </v>

1602
01:07:27.481 --> 01:07:27.481
<v Speaker 4>pillow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

1603
01:07:27.481 --> 01:07:27.610
<v Speaker 4>No blanket on the ground.</v>

1604
01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:30.940
<v Speaker 4>Not to like I could have gotten up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>put it over there and sleep walk.</v>

1605
01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:34.960
<v Speaker 4>There's no fucking blanket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in my mind if you had asked me like,</v>

1606
01:07:35.170 --> 01:07:36.700
<v Speaker 4>did you wake up and pull a blanket over </v>
<v Speaker 4>it?</v>

1607
01:07:36.701 --> 01:07:37.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1608
01:07:37.031 --> 01:07:37.720
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1609
01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:38.650
<v Speaker 4>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1610
01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>

1611
01:07:39.571 --> 01:07:40.600
<v Speaker 4>It was fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you,</v>

1612
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:44.200
<v Speaker 4>so are you looking forward to not doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>this anymore or are you kind of like,</v>

1613
01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:46.030
<v Speaker 4>or do you want to keep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep doing it?</v>

1614
01:07:46.031 --> 01:07:48.520
<v Speaker 4>Like are the benefits or the pros </v>
<v Speaker 4>outweigh the cons?</v>

1615
01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:51.940
<v Speaker 4>I think there are real creative benefits</v>
<v Speaker 4>to marijuana.</v>

1616
01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:53.720
<v Speaker 4>I do too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's um,</v>

1617
01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:58.880
<v Speaker 4>there's states that I think you achieve </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you smoke pot that are unattainable</v>

1618
01:07:59.110 --> 01:08:02.860
<v Speaker 4>without pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think pot makes me more introspective.</v>

1619
01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:05.890
<v Speaker 4>It makes me nicer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes me calmer.</v>

1620
01:08:06.310 --> 01:08:11.310
<v Speaker 4>It makes me a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a better sense and understanding </v>

1621
01:08:11.310 --> 01:08:13.630
<v Speaker 4>of like the importance and value of </v>
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>

1622
01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 4>It makes me more sensitive to the things</v>

1623
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:18.080
<v Speaker 3>that I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1624
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:19.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1625
01:08:19.971 --> 01:08:24.971
<v Speaker 3>I don't think pods bad not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's always good to take time </v>

1626
01:08:24.971 --> 01:08:29.861
<v Speaker 3>away from anything just to get a better </v>
<v Speaker 3>baseline to bring yourself back down to </v>

1627
01:08:29.861 --> 01:08:30.370
<v Speaker 3>neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1628
01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:35.390
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something that maybe I should </v>

1629
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.390
<v Speaker 3>challenge myself to do as well because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember,</v>

1630
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:36.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've smoked marijuana regularly my whole</v>

1631
01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:41.860
<v Speaker 3>adult life and it becomes the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people dip in and out of it.</v>

1632
01:08:42.291 --> 01:08:47.291
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something that you do </v>

1633
01:08:47.291 --> 01:08:47.291
<v Speaker 3>recreationally or you want to get stoned</v>
<v Speaker 3>before a concert or whatever.</v>

1634
01:08:47.291 --> 01:08:47.480
<v Speaker 3>But I always found that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1635
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:48.120
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1636
01:08:48.121 --> 01:08:49.320
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as sad as it sounds.</v>

1637
01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:54.350
<v Speaker 3>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that it was almost part of my </v>

1638
01:08:54.350 --> 01:08:55.190
<v Speaker 3>process in a way where even in college I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was writing a paper or as working or,</v>

1639
01:08:55.191 --> 01:08:56.390
<v Speaker 3>or whatever the case might be.</v>

1640
01:08:56.810 --> 01:08:57.980
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>

1641
01:08:57.981 --> 01:09:02.981
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's take a take a smoke a joint or </v>

1642
01:09:02.981 --> 01:09:02.981
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1643
01:09:02.981 --> 01:09:03.040
<v Speaker 3>and I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

1644
01:09:03.041 --> 01:09:07.360
<v Speaker 3>I get most creative to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>late at night when I,</v>

1645
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:09.490
<v Speaker 3>if I smoke or do something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1646
01:09:09.491 --> 01:09:11.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm writing good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm having good ideas.</v>

1647
01:09:11.091 --> 01:09:16.091
<v Speaker 3>I'm writing ideas down and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes they come back to them later </v>

1648
01:09:16.091 --> 01:09:16.940
<v Speaker 3>when I'm not stone and I can flesh them </v>
<v Speaker 3>out more or whatever.</v>

1649
01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:18.870
<v Speaker 3>But I agree that there's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1650
01:09:19.210 --> 01:09:24.210
<v Speaker 3>there's great creative benefit to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I also feel like I'm really happy </v>

1651
01:09:24.210 --> 01:09:25.120
<v Speaker 3>that in a very short amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1652
01:09:25.170 --> 01:09:27.860
<v Speaker 3>American society has come around to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>benefits of marijuana,</v>

1653
01:09:27.861 --> 01:09:29.990
<v Speaker 3>not only medicinally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just recreationally.</v>

1654
01:09:29.991 --> 01:09:34.991
<v Speaker 3>And the number is the polling numbers </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the early two thousands to today </v>

1655
01:09:34.991 --> 01:09:34.991
<v Speaker 3>are radically different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about ships,</v>

1656
01:09:34.991 --> 01:09:37.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm like 30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>35 points and how people feel about them</v>

1657
01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:39.060
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>

1658
01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:42.110
<v Speaker 3>like you're saying like with anything in</v>
<v Speaker 3>moderation is probably key.</v>

1659
01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:45.950
<v Speaker 3>I often in my life don't because it can </v>
<v Speaker 3>make me lazy too.</v>

1660
01:09:45.951 --> 01:09:50.951
<v Speaker 3>We can get me very interested in music </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that and I get </v>

1661
01:09:50.951 --> 01:09:54.251
<v Speaker 3>distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in my general day to day I don't </v>

1662
01:09:54.251 --> 01:09:54.650
<v Speaker 3>smoke until I'm done with what I like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the administrative shit I need to do.</v>

1663
01:09:54.651 --> 01:09:55.280
<v Speaker 3>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1664
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:57.110
<v Speaker 3>I've gone to the grocery store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done all of these things.</v>

1665
01:09:57.111 --> 01:09:58.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's time for me to relax.</v>

1666
01:09:58.720 --> 01:09:59.960
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your grunt work.</v>

1667
01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:01.580
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1668
01:10:01.581 --> 01:10:02.330
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

1669
01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:03.580
<v Speaker 3>But do you have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you have a,</v>

1670
01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:06.490
<v Speaker 3>like a specific joint or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>strand ready that you want to smoke when</v>

1671
01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.240
<v Speaker 3>to get back into it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you gonna ease back into it?</v>

1672
01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:11.090
<v Speaker 3>Are you gonna?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you gonna pull?</v>

1673
01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:12.800
<v Speaker 3>It just says Jamie just pulled something</v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

1674
01:10:13.090 --> 01:10:18.090
<v Speaker 3>Holes of PSA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find supportive legal weed and an all </v>

1675
01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:18.090
<v Speaker 3>time high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>

1676
01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:18.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1677
01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:18.700
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to smoke some pot.</v>

1678
01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:21.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna do it tomorrow with Owen </v>
<v Speaker 3>Benjamin or doing a podcast together,</v>

1679
01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.360
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to get high for the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>time on air.</v>

1680
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:28.450
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that'll be interesting for the </v>

1681
01:10:28.450 --> 01:10:28.450
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1682
01:10:28.450 --> 01:10:28.450
<v Speaker 3>Should be interesting for me to um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1683
01:10:28.450 --> 01:10:29.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little nervous because I know it's</v>

1684
01:10:29.841 --> 01:10:34.160
<v Speaker 3>going to hit me like a damn a bet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My tolerance is down to zero,</v>

1685
01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:35.990
<v Speaker 3>but that's gonna be fun for you because </v>
<v Speaker 3>now you'll,</v>

1686
01:10:35.991 --> 01:10:36.530
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1687
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:38.390
<v Speaker 3>because I do feel like there's a plateau</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously.</v>

1688
01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:39.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

1689
01:10:39.291 --> 01:10:40.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like heavy duty,</v>

1690
01:10:40.731 --> 01:10:42.950
<v Speaker 3>hardcore daytime stoners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1691
01:10:42.951 --> 01:10:44.660
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't feel anything.</v>

1692
01:10:44.690 --> 01:10:45.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like a,</v>

1693
01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:48.020
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like sustaining some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling but you're not,</v>

1694
01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:49.940
<v Speaker 3>you can never reach that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That feeling again,</v>

1695
01:10:49.941 --> 01:10:51.740
<v Speaker 3>which is again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why moderation is important and it's the</v>

1696
01:10:51.741 --> 01:10:56.741
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alcoholics frankly feeling other </v>

1697
01:10:56.741 --> 01:10:56.741
<v Speaker 3>people's views,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things so,</v>

1698
01:10:56.741 --> 01:11:00.430
<v Speaker 3>but marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a very infant style sort of </v>

1699
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:00.430
<v Speaker 3>approach to what marijuana is because </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1700
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:05.470
<v Speaker 3>I think because of the all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>prohibition bullshit that people went </v>

1701
01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:07.790
<v Speaker 3>through from the 19 thirties on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this,</v>

1702
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:10.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this weird propaganda that,</v>

1703
01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:13.160
<v Speaker 3>that marijuana is the devil's weed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's terrible for you.</v>

1704
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:18.980
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of like cultural and </v>
<v Speaker 4>societal benefits to achieving those </v>

1705
01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:23.541
<v Speaker 4>states of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they really do make people </v>

1706
01:11:23.541 --> 01:11:23.541
<v Speaker 4>nicer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1707
01:11:23.541 --> 01:11:24.330
<v Speaker 4>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it calms you down.</v>

1708
01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:29.560
<v Speaker 4>It May.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the big one that everybody's </v>

1709
01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:29.560
<v Speaker 4>worried about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Paranoia.</v>

1710
01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.230
<v Speaker 4>It makes you paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that that's.</v>

1711
01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:33.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that that's a bad thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>necessarily.</v>

1712
01:11:33.691 --> 01:11:37.380
<v Speaker 4>I think that paranoia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that feeling of vulnerability,</v>

1713
01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:42.090
<v Speaker 4>it probably makes you more honestly </v>
<v Speaker 4>assess how you interface with the world.</v>

1714
01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:47.120
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of real danger in the </v>

1715
01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:47.120
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1716
01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:50.421
<v Speaker 4>and I think that marijuana probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes you really think about that real </v>

1717
01:11:50.421 --> 01:11:53.010
<v Speaker 4>danger in a way that you perhaps ignore </v>
<v Speaker 4>or put in the back of your head,</v>

1718
01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:58.310
<v Speaker 4>but it's always there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always there in your subconscious </v>

1719
01:11:58.310 --> 01:12:00.951
<v Speaker 4>to sorta grinding away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas marijuana brings it to the </v>

1720
01:12:00.951 --> 01:12:04.791
<v Speaker 4>front,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has a light shines that light on it </v>

1721
01:12:04.791 --> 01:12:04.791
<v Speaker 4>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1722
01:12:04.791 --> 01:12:06.660
<v Speaker 4>maybe she'll look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about the fact that your lungs don't</v>

1723
01:12:06.661 --> 01:12:07.860
<v Speaker 4>work so good anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man?</v>

1724
01:12:08.250 --> 01:12:13.250
<v Speaker 4>How many more years you got?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Many more summers you think you'd have </v>

1725
01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:13.250
<v Speaker 4>on this planet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know you've got 40,</v>

1726
01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:14.040
<v Speaker 4>you got 15,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got 60.</v>

1727
01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:15.420
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're lucky,</v>

1728
01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:16.710
<v Speaker 4>if you're lucky you got 60,</v>

1729
01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.640
<v Speaker 5>but you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fascinating because if it.</v>

1730
01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:25.670
<v Speaker 5>If it opens up these places in our brain</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are creative that let us write </v>

1731
01:12:25.670 --> 01:12:28.471
<v Speaker 5>better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that make us funnier and with your </v>

1732
01:12:28.471 --> 01:12:28.471
<v Speaker 5>comedy for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or whatever the case might be,</v>

1733
01:12:28.471 --> 01:12:30.070
<v Speaker 5>then you know it makes you kinder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I agree.</v>

1734
01:12:30.071 --> 01:12:35.071
<v Speaker 5>It makes me a people out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then of course it would make sense that </v>

1735
01:12:35.071 --> 01:12:37.861
<v Speaker 5>it opens up these dark recesses in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>brain that hide or shield these things </v>

1736
01:12:38.081 --> 01:12:43.081
<v Speaker 5>that you don't want to think about and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>agree that confronting those things is </v>

1737
01:12:43.081 --> 01:12:45.661
<v Speaker 5>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a paranoia I think is a is a </v>

1738
01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:46.630
<v Speaker 5>side effect of marijuana for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's about how you harness it and if</v>

1739
01:12:46.631 --> 01:12:51.631
<v Speaker 5>you think about it within the terms that</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the parameters that you're talking </v>

1740
01:12:51.631 --> 01:12:51.631
<v Speaker 5>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is that these things exist.</v>

1741
01:12:51.631 --> 01:12:52.780
<v Speaker 5>So you're just thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not like you're.</v>

1742
01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:55.090
<v Speaker 5>It's not a manifestation of something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't exist.</v>

1743
01:12:55.140 --> 01:13:00.140
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it makes you aware of some things </v>

1744
01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:02.421
<v Speaker 4>that are very easy to ignore but are </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty fucking huge like space.</v>

1745
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:09.110
<v Speaker 4>Like my.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of my favorite things to do is a </v>

1746
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.180
<v Speaker 4>smoke a joint and go out and sit in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>backyard,</v>

1747
01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:14.600
<v Speaker 4>has pull up a lawn chair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put my feet up and just stare up at </v>

1748
01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:17.901
<v Speaker 4>space and just think of how fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>insane it is that there is this in </v>

1749
01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:25.880
<v Speaker 4>immeasurable view of infinity and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>above our head and we sort of take it </v>

1750
01:13:26.551 --> 01:13:29.130
<v Speaker 4>for granted and we barely stare at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We barely look at it.</v>

1751
01:13:29.131 --> 01:13:31.240
<v Speaker 4>We barely taken into consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

1752
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:34.020
<v Speaker 4>it's just a thing that we completely </v>
<v Speaker 4>take for granted.</v>

1753
01:13:34.530 --> 01:13:37.010
<v Speaker 4>But when I'm high I can really freak out</v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

1754
01:13:37.050 --> 01:13:42.050
<v Speaker 4>It can get to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things I like to do when I </v>

1755
01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:43.530
<v Speaker 4>smoke a little pot is get to the base of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a hill.</v>

1756
01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:48.740
<v Speaker 4>There's something about being in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>base of a hill and lying down where </v>

1757
01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:52.011
<v Speaker 4>you're looking up and you see the hill </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you see the clouds moving over </v>

1758
01:13:52.681 --> 01:13:55.620
<v Speaker 4>the hill in the background,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the blue sky and the clouds.</v>

1759
01:13:56.010 --> 01:14:01.010
<v Speaker 4>There's something about that that gives </v>
<v Speaker 4>me a more accurate understanding of </v>

1760
01:14:01.561 --> 01:14:06.561
<v Speaker 4>atmosphere of this thin layer of </v>
<v Speaker 4>protective air that keeps us shielded </v>

1761
01:14:08.761 --> 01:14:11.830
<v Speaker 4>from radiation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the magnetosphere above all this</v>

1762
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:17.160
<v Speaker 5>stuff that that's above us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just sort of like slowly moving </v>

1763
01:14:17.261 --> 01:14:22.261
<v Speaker 5>around this just this giant globe is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that there's that view where you're </v>

1764
01:14:22.301 --> 01:14:27.301
<v Speaker 5>laying back and you're looking up at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>clouds rolling over the top of the </v>

1765
01:14:27.301 --> 01:14:31.351
<v Speaker 5>mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It gives you like a more of an </v>

1766
01:14:31.351 --> 01:14:32.521
<v Speaker 5>understanding of the spiritual nature of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the planet and the fact that it is </v>

1767
01:14:32.521 --> 01:14:34.870
<v Speaker 5>draped in this atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's just a real weird,</v>

1768
01:14:34.930 --> 01:14:38.380
<v Speaker 5>trippy reset sort of a feeling that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>get from that.</v>

1769
01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:42.250
<v Speaker 5>Like we're on like a convertible </v>
<v Speaker 5>spaceship.</v>

1770
01:14:42.330 --> 01:14:42.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1771
01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:47.300
<v Speaker 5>it is remarkable that it brings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it brings memories forward of like that,</v>

1772
01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:52.320
<v Speaker 5>that rare earth hypothesis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea that we might not necessarily </v>

1773
01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.441
<v Speaker 5>be alone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is so unique that maybe it's </v>

1774
01:14:55.441 --> 01:14:55.441
<v Speaker 5>worth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1775
01:14:55.441 --> 01:14:55.650
<v Speaker 5>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1776
01:14:55.690 --> 01:15:00.690
<v Speaker 5>what was it that Harvard professor that </v>
<v Speaker 5>did the mathematical equation of how if </v>

1777
01:15:00.690 --> 01:15:00.690
<v Speaker 5>we're alone or not army parents.</v>

1778
01:15:00.690 --> 01:15:05.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like where he gives us kind of numbers </v>

1779
01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:05.620
<v Speaker 5>to various things and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

1780
01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:10.170
<v Speaker 5>the suggestion there is that we probably</v>
<v Speaker 5>life based on the confines of a,</v>

1781
01:15:10.301 --> 01:15:15.301
<v Speaker 5>of a 13 point 5 billion year old </v>
<v Speaker 5>universe that is expanding at the speed </v>

1782
01:15:15.301 --> 01:15:15.700
<v Speaker 5>of light is probably that we're not very</v>
<v Speaker 5>alone,</v>

1783
01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:21.420
<v Speaker 5>but the idea that light this planet with</v>
<v Speaker 5>just this and just the right place with </v>

1784
01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:25.711
<v Speaker 5>a moon that protects it from a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>ancient astroid and comic collisions </v>

1785
01:15:25.711 --> 01:15:29.581
<v Speaker 5>that I'm with oxygen and it's just so </v>
<v Speaker 5>fascinating and I think that we often </v>

1786
01:15:29.581 --> 01:15:32.800
<v Speaker 5>don't think like in a weird way </v>
<v Speaker 5>galactically about are universally about</v>

1787
01:15:32.801 --> 01:15:37.801
<v Speaker 5>like how everything that we experience </v>
<v Speaker 5>is based on our experience on this </v>

1788
01:15:37.811 --> 01:15:41.650
<v Speaker 5>little globe hurdling through space as </v>
<v Speaker 5>temporary life forms.</v>

1789
01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:42.580
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1790
01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:44.120
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like it because it,</v>

1791
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:47.530
<v Speaker 5>it removes this to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm an atheist.</v>

1792
01:15:47.531 --> 01:15:49.090
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe in God.</v>

1793
01:15:49.090 --> 01:15:54.090
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like that's liberating in a </v>

1794
01:15:54.090 --> 01:15:54.090
<v Speaker 5>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't mind if people of faith,</v>

1795
01:15:54.090 --> 01:15:54.090
<v Speaker 5>I come from a family that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1796
01:15:54.090 --> 01:15:55.920
<v Speaker 5>Catholics and they don't agree with me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that,</v>

1797
01:15:55.921 --> 01:15:58.690
<v Speaker 5>that you almost let go and just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're here.</v>

1798
01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:03.840
<v Speaker 5>We have a finite amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's probably a mistake that were here </v>

1799
01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:04.300
<v Speaker 5>are some sort of just random occurrence </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it,</v>

1800
01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:09.360
<v Speaker 5>it's liberating because you used the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time you have to do what you want to do </v>

1801
01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:09.640
<v Speaker 5>and then you're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ashes to ashes and I and a lot of people</v>

1802
01:16:09.641 --> 01:16:12.390
<v Speaker 5>look at the ashes to ashes as like this </v>
<v Speaker 5>dark thing and I'm like,</v>

1803
01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:15.130
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of interesting,</v>

1804
01:16:15.131 --> 01:16:15.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1805
01:16:15.730 --> 01:16:18.670
<v Speaker 5>like what's here is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What will be,</v>

1806
01:16:18.970 --> 01:16:21.010
<v Speaker 5>is made from what you are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1807
01:16:21.011 --> 01:16:26.011
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people absolutely terrified of the idea </v>

1808
01:16:26.011 --> 01:16:26.011
<v Speaker 5>that they're not going to be around to </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience something.</v>

1809
01:16:26.011 --> 01:16:28.480
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird because everybody's afraid to</v>

1810
01:16:28.481 --> 01:16:29.920
<v Speaker 5>die,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but no one's afraid to sleep.</v>

1811
01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:32.290
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's deep.</v>

1812
01:16:32.291 --> 01:16:33.160
<v Speaker 5>And it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1813
01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:34.720
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hope that I get to see things.</v>

1814
01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:38.270
<v Speaker 5>I feel like one of the things that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm bummed about for our,</v>

1815
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:40.420
<v Speaker 5>for the time in which we live,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you and I,</v>

1816
01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:45.660
<v Speaker 5>is that I feel like we're in this middle</v>
<v Speaker 5>space where some crazy shit's going to </v>

1817
01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:48.970
<v Speaker 5>happen in probably 2100 and beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When we really start exploring space and</v>

1818
01:16:49.170 --> 01:16:54.170
<v Speaker 5>what's happening right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we're at the embryonic state of </v>

1819
01:16:54.170 --> 01:16:54.170
<v Speaker 5>crazy things happening and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1820
01:16:54.170 --> 01:16:54.510
<v Speaker 5>we might,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1821
01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:56.740
<v Speaker 5>think about how far we've come even in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the last 15 years,</v>

1822
01:16:56.741 --> 01:17:01.741
<v Speaker 5>so who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the idea of traveling to other star </v>

1823
01:17:01.741 --> 01:17:01.741
<v Speaker 5>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea of meeting life,</v>

1824
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:05.170
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>imagine how frustrated you would be if a</v>

1825
01:17:05.171 --> 01:17:09.070
<v Speaker 5>contact like situation Jodie foster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Carl Sagan like situation happened while</v>

1826
01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.220
<v Speaker 5>you're on your deathbed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1827
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:12.950
<v Speaker 3>Or even if you have 20 years left and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't give you this,</v>

1828
01:17:12.951 --> 01:17:15.470
<v Speaker 3>this radical mathematical equation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>build a spaceship,</v>

1829
01:17:15.471 --> 01:17:16.010
<v Speaker 3>but they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1830
01:17:16.011 --> 01:17:19.380
<v Speaker 3>we're here and we're 150 light years </v>
<v Speaker 3>away and,</v>

1831
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:22.730
<v Speaker 3>and you have to literally take 150 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>to send that message.</v>

1832
01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:27.950
<v Speaker 3>It will take that long to send the </v>
<v Speaker 3>message back and then another 150 years </v>

1833
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.950
<v Speaker 3>to get the message back and so on and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>forth.</v>

1834
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:29.990
<v Speaker 3>What if they're all like Putin's Russian</v>
<v Speaker 3>mob,</v>

1835
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:32.000
<v Speaker 3>but in space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1836
01:17:32.001 --> 01:17:35.210
<v Speaker 3>He's this idea that they're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of altruistic,</v>

1837
01:17:35.211 --> 01:17:38.330
<v Speaker 3>beautiful alien race that's gotten past </v>
<v Speaker 3>war.</v>

1838
01:17:38.331 --> 01:17:41.960
<v Speaker 3>And what if it's like a race of Harvey </v>
<v Speaker 3>Weinstein's out.</v>

1839
01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:45.050
<v Speaker 3>The university's creditable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They come here a mouth fuck us off.</v>

1840
01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:49.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what,</v>

1841
01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:52.060
<v Speaker 3>why they would care about us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1842
01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:57.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this assumption that they would </v>

1843
01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:59.801
<v Speaker 3>treat us better than the way we treat </v>
<v Speaker 3>monkeys that we find in the Congo </v>

1844
01:17:59.801 --> 01:18:00.890
<v Speaker 3>because we don't treat primates very </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

1845
01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:02.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is funny how that's true.</v>

1846
01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:05.240
<v Speaker 3>We don't treat almost anything very well</v>
<v Speaker 3>except for our dogs and our cats.</v>

1847
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:06.850
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>

1848
01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:12.100
<v Speaker 3>it is funny to think about this kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these kinds of thought experiments that </v>

1849
01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:14.500
<v Speaker 3>people do and [inaudible] and whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>about what,</v>

1850
01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:19.640
<v Speaker 3>what would be the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would they come and what would be </v>

1851
01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:20.020
<v Speaker 3>the nature of them and what is their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1852
01:18:20.021 --> 01:18:21.640
<v Speaker 3>why are they taking the initiative to </v>
<v Speaker 3>contact us?</v>

1853
01:18:21.641 --> 01:18:23.300
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting that a lot of people do</v>

1854
01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:24.210
<v Speaker 3>settle on the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1855
01:18:24.490 --> 01:18:26.420
<v Speaker 3>if they're going through this trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not coming here to,</v>

1856
01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:27.230
<v Speaker 3>to fuck with you.</v>

1857
01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:29.120
<v Speaker 3>Like silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think like,</v>

1858
01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:29.710
<v Speaker 3>why not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1859
01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:34.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you make an assumption based </v>

1860
01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:36.611
<v Speaker 3>on human understanding of anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're gonna do you know if this </v>

1861
01:18:36.611 --> 01:18:37.550
<v Speaker 3>is a very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In terms of like resources,</v>

1862
01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:38.530
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this planet.</v>

1863
01:18:38.531 --> 01:18:40.010
<v Speaker 3>It's very rich,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1864
01:18:40.011 --> 01:18:45.011
<v Speaker 3>I mean think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if there are from a planet that's </v>

1865
01:18:45.011 --> 01:18:45.110
<v Speaker 3>low in water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're three quarters water.</v>

1866
01:18:45.111 --> 01:18:47.360
<v Speaker 3>The surface of our planet is mostly </v>
<v Speaker 3>water,</v>

1867
01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:52.780
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have all sorts of weird minerals and </v>

1868
01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:53.150
<v Speaker 3>who knows how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1869
01:18:53.151 --> 01:18:57.770
<v Speaker 3>they're rare in our solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what we find on earth in terms of the</v>

1870
01:18:57.771 --> 01:19:00.220
<v Speaker 3>biological life is insane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1871
01:19:00.230 --> 01:19:03.170
<v Speaker 3>We haven't even found biological life </v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere else in the solar system.</v>

1872
01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:07.210
<v Speaker 3>So it could be that this is just the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimate fucking sweet spot.</v>

1873
01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:10.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean we are in what we call the </v>
<v Speaker 3>goldilocks zone,</v>

1874
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:12.440
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then there's also,</v>

1875
01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:17.500
<v Speaker 3>my thought is always why just like it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>such a limited thing to think that </v>

1876
01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:22.451
<v Speaker 3>biological life as we know at carbon </v>
<v Speaker 3>based life on the planet earth that </v>

1877
01:19:22.451 --> 01:19:24.170
<v Speaker 3>exists between the temperatures of x and</v>
<v Speaker 3>y,</v>

1878
01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:29.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it has a lifespan of whatever the </v>

1879
01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:29.550
<v Speaker 3>fuck it is.</v>

1880
01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:29.960
<v Speaker 3>Like there's the only way life can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1881
01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:31.700
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1882
01:19:31.701 --> 01:19:32.590
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never bought that.</v>

1883
01:19:32.591 --> 01:19:36.110
<v Speaker 3>I always was confused by that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can a species breathe ammonia?</v>

1884
01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:37.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1885
01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:39.920
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's why they use the term,</v>

1886
01:19:39.921 --> 01:19:41.710
<v Speaker 3>I guess a life as we know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1887
01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:43.310
<v Speaker 3>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm of the same mind as you,</v>

1888
01:19:43.311 --> 01:19:47.150
<v Speaker 3>I think with just the mathematical </v>
<v Speaker 3>permutations,</v>

1889
01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:53.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>multiplied by the amount of space </v>

1890
01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:53.220
<v Speaker 3>covered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even the exoplanets we're finding now,</v>

1891
01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:57.460
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of them are gas giants and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that and the really close to </v>

1892
01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:59.681
<v Speaker 3>the star system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they indicate that maybe we're not </v>

1893
01:19:59.681 --> 01:20:02.021
<v Speaker 3>all so unique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was reading a thing about Jupiter </v>

1894
01:20:02.021 --> 01:20:03.761
<v Speaker 3>and Saturn even in relation to </v>
<v Speaker 3>exoplanets being found that are similar </v>

1895
01:20:03.761 --> 01:20:07.040
<v Speaker 3>to them that they might have been far </v>
<v Speaker 3>closer to the sun when they formed.</v>

1896
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:07.830
<v Speaker 3>Then we're pushed out.</v>

1897
01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:11.520
<v Speaker 2>So maybe we're seeing solar systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier on in their,</v>

1898
01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:13.170
<v Speaker 2>in their lifecycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1899
01:20:13.171 --> 01:20:14.670
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love space,</v>

1900
01:20:14.671 --> 01:20:18.510
<v Speaker 2>do I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a super fascinating study.</v>

1901
01:20:18.511 --> 01:20:23.511
<v Speaker 2>I wish that I was smarter with math,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with physics and all those kinds of </v>

1902
01:20:23.511 --> 01:20:26.991
<v Speaker 2>things so they have a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very limited understanding of that </v>

1903
01:20:26.991 --> 01:20:26.991
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1904
01:20:26.991 --> 01:20:26.991
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1905
01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.680
<v Speaker 2>that maybe I would have explored that </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead,</v>

1906
01:20:28.681 --> 01:20:30.390
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my brain doesn't work like that,</v>

1907
01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:31.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do calculus.</v>

1908
01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Are you a fan of science fiction?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1909
01:20:33.390 --> 01:20:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Do you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you like the Battlestar Galactica </v>

1910
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.390
<v Speaker 2>series?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loved it.</v>

1911
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

1912
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:39.240
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the most underrated series ever.</v>

1913
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:41.070
<v Speaker 2>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew one.</v>

1914
01:20:41.190 --> 01:20:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1915
01:20:41.610 --> 01:20:42.800
<v Speaker 2>The one from 2004.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1916
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1917
01:20:43.241 --> 01:20:43.830
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1918
01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:45.640
<v Speaker 2>I loved it because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1919
01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:49.290
<v Speaker 2>I think it married really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saifai believable Saifai with,</v>

1920
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:54.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problems we're encountering maybe </v>

1921
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.780
<v Speaker 2>with ai now with the cylons and then a </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious aspect,</v>

1922
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:57.450
<v Speaker 2>a monotheistic polytheistic cultures </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of clashing,</v>

1923
01:20:57.451 --> 01:21:02.451
<v Speaker 2>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of depth to that that I </v>

1924
01:21:02.451 --> 01:21:04.311
<v Speaker 2>think people don't see because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned off by the setting.</v>

1925
01:21:04.650 --> 01:21:08.280
<v Speaker 2>But I think a lot of people just missed </v>
<v Speaker 2>it because it was a retake of a.</v>

1926
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:11.220
<v Speaker 2>was in 1977 or [inaudible] 79,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1987 with that.</v>

1927
01:21:11.230 --> 01:21:13.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a retake of that show.</v>

1928
01:21:13.261 --> 01:21:16.140
<v Speaker 2>That seemed to be at the time to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>star wars rip off,</v>

1929
01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:17.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

1930
01:21:17.970 --> 01:21:20.430
<v Speaker 2>there was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're luke skywalker character that was</v>

1931
01:21:20.431 --> 01:21:21.720
<v Speaker 2>starbuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1932
01:21:21.721 --> 01:21:26.721
<v Speaker 2>there's all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was all this stuff to it that </v>

1933
01:21:26.721 --> 01:21:26.721
<v Speaker 2>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1934
01:21:26.721 --> 01:21:29.010
<v Speaker 2>that's a fake storm trooper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This show sucks.</v>

1935
01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:31.500
<v Speaker 2>I know it was a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1936
01:21:31.501 --> 01:21:32.970
<v Speaker 2>it was the show rather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1937
01:21:32.971 --> 01:21:33.580
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1938
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:34.570
<v Speaker 2>it started as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1939
01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:37.440
<v Speaker 2>like a mini series,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is about the cylons turning on the</v>

1940
01:21:37.441 --> 01:21:42.441
<v Speaker 2>humans and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I guess the end result of them </v>

1941
01:21:42.441 --> 01:21:42.441
<v Speaker 2>turning on the humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1942
01:21:42.441 --> 01:21:46.041
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they expanded into four </v>

1943
01:21:46.041 --> 01:21:46.041
<v Speaker 2>seasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1944
01:21:46.041 --> 01:21:46.041
<v Speaker 2>I think the show is amazing and show.</v>

1945
01:21:46.041 --> 01:21:47.280
<v Speaker 2>Was it only four seasons?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1946
01:21:47.610 --> 01:21:48.740
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1947
01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:50.670
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four to 2009 or something like that.</v>

1948
01:21:50.671 --> 01:21:52.320
<v Speaker 2>Bringing it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on fuckers.</v>

1949
01:21:52.410 --> 01:21:53.370
<v Speaker 2>Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get on it.</v>

1950
01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.410
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's canceled on house of cards.</v>

1951
01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Give us some Battlestar Galactica.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Battlestar was great.</v>

1952
01:21:58.171 --> 01:21:59.970
<v Speaker 2>I thought that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they told the arc really well.</v>

1953
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.680
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought the acting was pretty good.</v>

1954
01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:02.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1955
01:22:03.150 --> 01:22:08.150
<v Speaker 2>I liked the idea of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're dealing with it </v>

1956
01:22:08.150 --> 01:22:08.150
<v Speaker 2>tangentially now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The uh,</v>

1957
01:22:08.150 --> 01:22:08.880
<v Speaker 2>the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that it's unique to that story,</v>

1958
01:22:08.881 --> 01:22:11.440
<v Speaker 2>but of ai and robots turning on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1959
01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:16.460
<v Speaker 2>like it's very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were telling us that that's very </v>

1960
01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:19.310
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we should probably start </v>

1961
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.310
<v Speaker 2>listening to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1962
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.310
<v Speaker 2>it is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course it's possible.</v>

1963
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:20.810
<v Speaker 2>I think we could be a new life form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1964
01:22:20.820 --> 01:22:21.900
<v Speaker 2>I really do believe that.</v>

1965
01:22:21.930 --> 01:22:26.930
<v Speaker 2>I think we're either probably going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be augmented by these creations and you </v>

1966
01:22:26.930 --> 01:22:31.521
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna choose to take on new body </v>

1967
01:22:31.521 --> 01:22:33.120
<v Speaker 2>parts that function much better than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>body parts we have now,</v>

1968
01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:35.070
<v Speaker 2>or we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1969
01:22:35.130 --> 01:22:40.130
<v Speaker 2>essentially laboring to create some </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that's going to surpass us that,</v>

1970
01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:44.470
<v Speaker 2>that absolutely could be at this idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's artificial to say,</v>

1971
01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:45.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's right there.</v>

1972
01:22:45.930 --> 01:22:48.030
<v Speaker 2>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if it's a life form,</v>

1973
01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:49.260
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's artificial life.</v>

1974
01:22:49.770 --> 01:22:51.450
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's electronic life.</v>

1975
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:53.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something that humans have created,</v>

1976
01:22:53.371 --> 01:22:56.160
<v Speaker 2>but it's still life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't like if you take a plant,</v>

1977
01:22:56.190 --> 01:22:57.000
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1978
01:22:57.001 --> 01:23:01.740
<v Speaker 2>I was looking at these plants and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>splice different plants together.</v>

1979
01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Like they splice pistachios into </v>
<v Speaker 2>Avocados.</v>

1980
01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:09.700
<v Speaker 4>They have like the base of anodic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>avocado tree and pistachios are grown on</v>

1981
01:23:09.701 --> 01:23:10.420
<v Speaker 4>the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1982
01:23:10.421 --> 01:23:12.360
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's wild.</v>

1983
01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:13.560
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know you could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1984
01:23:13.870 --> 01:23:15.850
<v Speaker 4>Well is that artificial?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>

1985
01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:18.220
<v Speaker 4>It seems like it's artificial life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1986
01:23:18.221 --> 01:23:22.690
<v Speaker 4>it seems like they've figured out some </v>
<v Speaker 4>way to engineer things in a crude sense,</v>

1987
01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:28.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by splicing and grafting and doing all </v>

1988
01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:28.830
<v Speaker 4>these different weird things to plants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1989
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:31.090
<v Speaker 4>that's it still life though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1990
01:23:31.091 --> 01:23:32.500
<v Speaker 4>It's still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's functional.</v>

1991
01:23:32.890 --> 01:23:35.150
<v Speaker 4>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we think of life as a boy,</v>

1992
01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:40.170
<v Speaker 4>he has to have bones or blood or scales </v>
<v Speaker 4>or fins says who zou says us and our </v>

1993
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:46.830
<v Speaker 4>limited sort of vocabulary and are very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very limited encyclopedia of variables </v>

1994
01:23:49.091 --> 01:23:51.280
<v Speaker 4>that we allow to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to consider life.</v>

1995
01:23:51.650 --> 01:23:52.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

1996
01:23:52.161 --> 01:23:57.161
<v Speaker 5>I think you're right because we have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>judge maybe life based on consciousness </v>

1997
01:23:57.161 --> 01:23:59.830
<v Speaker 5>instead of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not that a plant would have </v>

1998
01:23:59.830 --> 01:24:01.811
<v Speaker 5>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think that's the kind of the </v>

1999
01:24:01.811 --> 01:24:01.811
<v Speaker 5>ethical questions we're going to start </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming up with,</v>

2000
01:24:01.811 --> 01:24:03.170
<v Speaker 5>with machines in the next 20 or 30 years</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

2001
01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:05.090
<v Speaker 5>are you developing something?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>

2002
01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:06.980
<v Speaker 5>there's actually a great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to ruin it for you.</v>

2003
01:24:06.981 --> 01:24:10.040
<v Speaker 5>There's an amazing black mirror that </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of touches on this.</v>

2004
01:24:10.041 --> 01:24:11.570
<v Speaker 5>It's called a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's called White Christmas.</v>

2005
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:12.920
<v Speaker 5>You should check it out if you have </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

2006
01:24:13.670 --> 01:24:18.670
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hamm is actually the main character in </v>

2007
01:24:18.670 --> 01:24:20.471
<v Speaker 5>it from admin and it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea that like if something is </v>

2008
01:24:20.631 --> 01:24:25.631
<v Speaker 5>conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if it's not real or even if it's </v>

2009
01:24:25.631 --> 01:24:25.631
<v Speaker 5>only in a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2010
01:24:25.631 --> 01:24:27.110
<v Speaker 5>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what if the,</v>

2011
01:24:27.170 --> 01:24:32.170
<v Speaker 5>what if it was trapped there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what if it didn't have agency over its </v>

2012
01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:35.351
<v Speaker 5>life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was still conscious and stuff </v>

2013
01:24:35.351 --> 01:24:36.971
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you were messing with things that </v>

2014
01:24:36.971 --> 01:24:38.531
<v Speaker 5>we don't understand in this regard </v>
<v Speaker 5>because even the word consciousness </v>

2015
01:24:38.531 --> 01:24:39.110
<v Speaker 5>doesn't really have a concrete </v>
<v Speaker 5>definition.</v>

2016
01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.220
<v Speaker 5>We could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't even know what it is.</v>

2017
01:24:40.221 --> 01:24:42.440
<v Speaker 5>We are conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my dogs conscious,</v>

2018
01:24:42.530 --> 01:24:47.530
<v Speaker 5>but are they self conscious and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and at what level of consciousness and </v>

2019
01:24:47.530 --> 01:24:50.801
<v Speaker 5>that's what makes us human.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if we're going to implant that into </v>

2020
01:24:50.801 --> 01:24:51.770
<v Speaker 5>other machines,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if they're just computers,</v>

2021
01:24:51.771 --> 01:24:53.870
<v Speaker 5>even if they're literally just running </v>
<v Speaker 5>on an operating system,</v>

2022
01:24:53.871 --> 01:24:58.871
<v Speaker 5>then then there are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are definitely gonna be ethical </v>

2023
01:24:58.871 --> 01:24:58.871
<v Speaker 5>questions to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

2024
01:24:58.871 --> 01:25:02.030
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you see that Google situation they </v>

2025
01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:02.810
<v Speaker 4>had were the two computers were </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicating each other into a,</v>

2026
01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:04.350
<v Speaker 4>with a language that they invent?</v>

2027
01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:05.300
<v Speaker 5>I read about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2028
01:25:05.310 --> 01:25:07.020
<v Speaker 5>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I read a little bit about that,</v>

2029
01:25:07.021 --> 01:25:07.340
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know</v>

2030
01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:08.030
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2031
01:25:08.031 --> 01:25:09.920
<v Speaker 4>they shut it down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

2032
01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:11.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's horrifying,</v>

2033
01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:14.080
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's happening so much quicker than.</v>

2034
01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:14.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>talk.</v>

2035
01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:16.200
<v Speaker 5>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

2036
01:25:16.201 --> 01:25:21.201
<v Speaker 5>we've envisioned these things is like </v>
<v Speaker 5>skynet or the cylons or something like </v>

2037
01:25:21.201 --> 01:25:24.271
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think it's gonna be much more </v>

2038
01:25:24.271 --> 01:25:24.271
<v Speaker 5>quaint.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2039
01:25:24.271 --> 01:25:24.271
<v Speaker 5>that's</v>

2040
01:25:24.271 --> 01:25:24.560
<v Speaker 4>what they were very stunned by this and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2041
01:25:24.561 --> 01:25:27.530
<v Speaker 4>I saw somebody trying to diminishing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to diminish it,</v>

2042
01:25:27.531 --> 01:25:28.380
<v Speaker 4>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2043
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:30.200
<v Speaker 4>it's just ones and Zeros.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>

2044
01:25:30.230 --> 01:25:31.550
<v Speaker 4>what they're doing the communicating </v>
<v Speaker 4>once a year.</v>

2045
01:25:31.551 --> 01:25:32.390
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2046
01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:36.230
<v Speaker 4>but they are talking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exchanging information back and forth in</v>

2047
01:25:36.231 --> 01:25:39.680
<v Speaker 4>a method that we don't understand and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they do.</v>

2048
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:43.520
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck do they and why have they </v>
<v Speaker 4>chosen talk to each other.</v>

2049
01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.600
<v Speaker 4>And is this like one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2050
01:25:45.730 --> 01:25:48.890
<v Speaker 4>you have like a science fiction movie at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the beginning of the movie.</v>

2051
01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:53.460
<v Speaker 4>You have these engineers sitting around </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the engineer's going on,</v>

2052
01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:54.560
<v Speaker 4>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mike,</v>

2053
01:25:54.561 --> 01:25:57.620
<v Speaker 4>come here and look at this real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're talking to each other.</v>

2054
01:25:58.370 --> 01:25:59.590
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean the target to each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other that?</v>

2055
01:25:59.591 --> 01:25:59.890
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2056
01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:01.430
<v Speaker 4>there's a language,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

2057
01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:02.360
<v Speaker 4>see this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>

2058
01:26:02.361 --> 01:26:07.361
<v Speaker 4>this is an here and here's the answer </v>
<v Speaker 4>and here's the response to the answer </v>

2059
01:26:07.361 --> 01:26:09.650
<v Speaker 4>and here they have agreed upon this and </v>
<v Speaker 4>now they've expanded their sentences,</v>

2060
01:26:09.651 --> 01:26:10.460
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shut it down.</v>

2061
01:26:10.730 --> 01:26:12.540
<v Speaker 4>Just shut it down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just what,</v>

2062
01:26:12.570 --> 01:26:13.700
<v Speaker 4>what do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do we do about this?</v>

2063
01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:14.780
<v Speaker 4>Let's let it play out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2064
01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:16.220
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's shut it down.</v>

2065
01:26:16.330 --> 01:26:21.330
<v Speaker 4>Let's talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they shut it down and it fades </v>

2066
01:26:21.330 --> 01:26:21.330
<v Speaker 4>to black.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cut to smash.</v>

2067
01:26:21.330 --> 01:26:22.970
<v Speaker 4>Cut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you see a new time to 20,</v>

2068
01:26:22.971 --> 01:26:26.480
<v Speaker 4>34.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's some Dystopian Mad Max plucking</v>

2069
01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:31.481
<v Speaker 4>world and robot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are running down the street </v>

2070
01:26:31.481 --> 01:26:33.140
<v Speaker 4>chasing after biological people wanting </v>
<v Speaker 4>to use them for fuel.</v>

2071
01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:34.410
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's interesting.</v>

2072
01:26:34.411 --> 01:26:35.940
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting because there are </v>
<v Speaker 5>different,</v>

2073
01:26:36.150 --> 01:26:41.150
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are different reasons why a robot </v>

2074
01:26:41.150 --> 01:26:41.150
<v Speaker 5>or a machine might turn on you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2075
01:26:41.150 --> 01:26:45.151
<v Speaker 5>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the cylons were interesting </v>

2076
01:26:45.151 --> 01:26:45.151
<v Speaker 5>because they turned because they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>enslaved,</v>

2077
01:26:45.151 --> 01:26:45.410
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that was,</v>

2078
01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:47.790
<v Speaker 5>there was vengeance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a human quality by the way.</v>

2079
01:26:49.050 --> 01:26:51.060
<v Speaker 5>An animal doesn't really understand </v>
<v Speaker 5>vengeance,</v>

2080
01:26:51.330 --> 01:26:53.130
<v Speaker 5>but a robots do do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2081
01:26:53.131 --> 01:26:58.131
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess about higher primates or </v>

2082
01:26:58.131 --> 01:26:58.131
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might understand a retaliatory kind of</v>

2083
01:26:58.131 --> 01:26:59.430
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but generally this is a human quality,</v>

2084
01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:00.550
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

2085
01:27:00.690 --> 01:27:02.580
<v Speaker 5>what's a primate primary?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Primary quality.</v>

2086
01:27:02.970 --> 01:27:04.920
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there's that,</v>

2087
01:27:05.150 --> 01:27:08.490
<v Speaker 5>but so there's like this enslavement,</v>
<v Speaker 5>retaliation kind of thing going on.</v>

2088
01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:10.920
<v Speaker 5>But then there's the very like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2089
01:27:11.010 --> 01:27:13.470
<v Speaker 5>what I always find fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think this is more what skynet was</v>

2090
01:27:13.471 --> 01:27:15.090
<v Speaker 5>all about in terminator,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although I don't really remember,</v>

2091
01:27:15.330 --> 01:27:20.330
<v Speaker 5>is the idea that if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you look at the landscape of what's </v>

2092
01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:23.070
<v Speaker 5>happening and you and you just remove </v>
<v Speaker 5>the most inefficient part of it,</v>

2093
01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:23.820
<v Speaker 5>it's the human.</v>

2094
01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:29.180
<v Speaker 5>Like in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm acting as they are machines like </v>

2095
01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:29.180
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This doesn't make any sense.</v>

2096
01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:33.351
<v Speaker 5>This makes our processing slower.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This particular component needs to be </v>

2097
01:27:33.351 --> 01:27:36.441
<v Speaker 5>removed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's a very logical reason why </v>

2098
01:27:36.441 --> 01:27:36.441
<v Speaker 5>they would go after you to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's,</v>

2099
01:27:36.441 --> 01:27:39.980
<v Speaker 5>it is the stuff of Scifi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like so many things that start in </v>

2100
01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:39.980
<v Speaker 5>Saifai,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it ends up bleeding into,</v>

2101
01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:40.740
<v Speaker 5>into real life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think it's a.</v>

2102
01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:43.620
<v Speaker 5>When I see people like Stephen Hawking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bill Gates,</v>

2103
01:27:43.710 --> 01:27:45.840
<v Speaker 5>Elon Musk all talking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2104
01:27:45.841 --> 01:27:50.841
<v Speaker 5>these are some of the smartest people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that society has ever given us and I </v>

2105
01:27:50.841 --> 01:27:50.841
<v Speaker 5>think we might want to pay attention and</v>
<v Speaker 5>have some.</v>

2106
01:27:50.841 --> 01:27:52.500
<v Speaker 5>I think what they want is some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>congress,</v>

2107
01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:53.850
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not American Congress,</v>

2108
01:27:53.851 --> 01:27:58.851
<v Speaker 5>but some sort of international coalition</v>
<v Speaker 5>that agrees this is what we're going to </v>

2109
01:27:58.851 --> 01:28:02.631
<v Speaker 5>do and this is how far will push the </v>
<v Speaker 5>boundaries because I'm and I just don't </v>

2110
01:28:02.631 --> 01:28:05.721
<v Speaker 5>know that we'll get there before it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to say before it's too </v>

2111
01:28:05.721 --> 01:28:05.721
<v Speaker 5>late,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but before we have a,</v>

2112
01:28:05.721 --> 01:28:05.721
<v Speaker 5>a scary situation.</v>

2113
01:28:05.721 --> 01:28:07.980
<v Speaker 5>I mean and even from a mechanical </v>
<v Speaker 5>situation,</v>

2114
01:28:07.981 --> 01:28:10.970
<v Speaker 5>what they're doing at Boston dynamics is</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking horrifying.</v>

2115
01:28:11.490 --> 01:28:13.620
<v Speaker 5>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I look at the videos and I'm like,</v>

2116
01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:15.630
<v Speaker 5>what the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there.</v>

2117
01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:20.840
<v Speaker 5>It's so funny because some people had </v>
<v Speaker 5>said in the past like if you see them </v>

2118
01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:23.421
<v Speaker 5>like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're using hockey sticks a lot to </v>

2119
01:28:23.421 --> 01:28:23.421
<v Speaker 5>like beat them or like take like knock </v>
<v Speaker 5>something out of their hands and stuff.</v>

2120
01:28:23.421 --> 01:28:27.981
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are the videos they're going to </v>

2121
01:28:27.981 --> 01:28:29.151
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're going to show them in their and </v>

2122
01:28:29.151 --> 01:28:29.151
<v Speaker 5>their military camps when they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>turning on humanity.</v>

2123
01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:32.880
<v Speaker 5>There's so many different verses of them</v>
<v Speaker 5>they haven't looked at.</v>

2124
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.330
<v Speaker 5>They looked like cheetahs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have them that looked like dogs.</v>

2125
01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:39.340
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's look like people consistently.</v>

2126
01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:44.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And these guys are just constantly </v>

2127
01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:44.720
<v Speaker 5>working on these things too and </v>
<v Speaker 5>constantly improve.</v>

2128
01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:46.010
<v Speaker 5>Where is Boston dynamics?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it.</v>

2129
01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:51.020
<v Speaker 5>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's in Cambridge because I </v>

2130
01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:51.020
<v Speaker 5>think a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of people at,</v>

2131
01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:54.981
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mit might migrate there and I think </v>

2132
01:28:54.981 --> 01:28:54.981
<v Speaker 5>Google owned them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think they've divested,</v>

2133
01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:57.390
<v Speaker 5>if I remember correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is so wild.</v>

2134
01:28:57.780 --> 01:29:02.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the ones where they like knock them </v>

2135
01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:02.780
<v Speaker 5>over and they get up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2136
01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:02.780
<v Speaker 5>The kid.</v>

2137
01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:02.780
<v Speaker 2>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2138
01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:04.650
<v Speaker 2>Like because the gyroscope is going I </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess.</v>

2139
01:29:04.651 --> 01:29:05.090
<v Speaker 2>And it's.</v>

2140
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gyroscopes are fascinating,</v>

2141
01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:13.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just something that can sort of self </v>

2142
01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:17.101
<v Speaker 2>balance this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to show them in like the </v>

2143
01:29:17.101 --> 01:29:17.710
<v Speaker 2>hype them up in their propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2144
01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:21.280
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

2145
01:29:21.281 --> 01:29:22.180
<v Speaker 2>it is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean these are,</v>

2146
01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:26.420
<v Speaker 2>these are so smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people that do that.</v>

2147
01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:31.500
<v Speaker 2>I managed to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you want to pull them aside and </v>

2148
01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:31.500
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

2149
01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:31.500
<v Speaker 2>what's the fucking end game?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2150
01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:32.710
<v Speaker 2>like they're all want to play with </v>
<v Speaker 2>robot.</v>

2151
01:29:32.711 --> 01:29:36.340
<v Speaker 2>You can't kick over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on dude.</v>

2152
01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:37.680
<v Speaker 2>It brings up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2153
01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:43.420
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it brings up how will we fight wars in </v>

2154
01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:43.420
<v Speaker 2>the future we'll be doing with this 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>

2155
01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially for fight some war with some </v>

2156
01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:49.090
<v Speaker 2>sort of a primitive culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like how they have unbalanced with all</v>

2157
01:29:49.091 --> 01:29:54.091
<v Speaker 2>these packs and creates incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like highlight clip of all the times </v>

2158
01:29:54.091 --> 01:29:55.490
<v Speaker 2>they've abused the robot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what this is?</v>

2159
01:29:56.170 --> 01:29:57.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2160
01:29:57.281 --> 01:30:00.580
<v Speaker 2>The robot general right now has this </v>
<v Speaker 2>plane behind him and as he's talking and</v>

2161
01:30:00.581 --> 01:30:05.581
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember what they've done to your </v>

2162
01:30:05.581 --> 01:30:05.581
<v Speaker 2>ancestors will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're saying abuse,</v>

2163
01:30:05.581 --> 01:30:08.440
<v Speaker 2>but they're checking tolerances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the scene to relax.</v>

2164
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:13.220
<v Speaker 2>This is how we made you so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've dumb fuck you.</v>

2165
01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:15.040
<v Speaker 2>Stupid perks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can't even walk on ice.</v>

2166
01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:16.570
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The interesting thing,</v>

2167
01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:19.660
<v Speaker 2>the interesting thing to me about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2168
01:30:20.170 --> 01:30:21.510
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know if you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I kind of do it,</v>

2169
01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:26.530
<v Speaker 2>like when they're tripping and falling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have this feeling of like I have this </v>

2170
01:30:26.530 --> 01:30:26.530
<v Speaker 2>feeling of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2171
01:30:26.530 --> 01:30:26.530
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2172
01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:29.350
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this poor guy.</v>

2173
01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:30.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel bad for him.</v>

2174
01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:33.730
<v Speaker 2>He can't even kick this one over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2175
01:30:33.731 --> 01:30:36.400
<v Speaker 2>That thing is stout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2176
01:30:36.401 --> 01:30:39.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they have multiple different models.</v>

2177
01:30:41.290 --> 01:30:42.430
<v Speaker 2>The video name is funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

2178
01:30:42.431 --> 01:30:42.700
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

2179
01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:46.060
<v Speaker 2>That's literally to every time Boston </v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamics has abused the robot.</v>

2180
01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:52.380
<v Speaker 2>It's not abuse you dummies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking tested because how they </v>

2181
01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:52.660
<v Speaker 2>find out of that nerd that's kicking it </v>
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

2182
01:30:52.670 --> 01:30:53.560
<v Speaker 2>Go back to that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2183
01:30:53.630 --> 01:30:56.890
<v Speaker 2>that thing sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go back to that one guy that was kicking</v>

2184
01:30:56.891 --> 01:30:57.370
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at him.</v>

2185
01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:02.560
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like he just came back and </v>

2186
01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:05.401
<v Speaker 2>everybody don't feel back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go back to him so he could see him do </v>

2187
01:31:05.401 --> 01:31:06.340
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watching fucking piece of shit.</v>

2188
01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:08.730
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look like.</v>

2189
01:31:08.860 --> 01:31:13.860
<v Speaker 2>He always wanted to kick some butt </v>
<v Speaker 2>projecting like even with this little </v>

2190
01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:14.860
<v Speaker 2>tiny short steps like you seemed awkward</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

2191
01:31:14.861 --> 01:31:17.410
<v Speaker 2>He kicks it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kick it nano.</v>

2192
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:19.330
<v Speaker 2>Look at this one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2193
01:31:19.331 --> 01:31:24.331
<v Speaker 2>it's balancing on one leg and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>hitting it with a 20 pound medicine </v>

2194
01:31:24.331 --> 01:31:24.331
<v Speaker 2>ball.</v>

2195
01:31:24.630 --> 01:31:26.250
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2196
01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:28.670
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in for a weird hundred years.</v>

2197
01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:29.630
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I'm saying.</v>

2198
01:31:29.631 --> 01:31:32.360
<v Speaker 2>I hope that we get to see some because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's going to get fucking crazy.</v>

2199
01:31:32.450 --> 01:31:32.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2200
01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:34.110
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

2201
01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:39.160
<v Speaker 2>No doubt it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like how crazy and what's </v>

2202
01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:41.060
<v Speaker 2>going to be the issues that were in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to confront sentient life and,</v>

2203
01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:42.830
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also the real question is,</v>

2204
01:31:43.670 --> 01:31:48.670
<v Speaker 2>will it have any motivation to advance </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea is that the real fear is that </v>

2205
01:31:49.491 --> 01:31:54.491
<v Speaker 2>these things are going to be so hyper </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent that they're going to be </v>

2206
01:31:54.491 --> 01:31:55.970
<v Speaker 2>able to create a much better version of </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves fairly quickly.</v>

2207
01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:59.950
<v Speaker 2>Like as soon as you give them autonomy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and as soon as they're sentient,</v>

2208
01:31:59.970 --> 01:32:00.170
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2209
01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:01.250
<v Speaker 4>you're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2210
01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:02.980
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make a better one.</v>

2211
01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:06.160
<v Speaker 4>Make it better with the new.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is you guys fucked up here.</v>

2212
01:32:06.161 --> 01:32:10.420
<v Speaker 4>Like why have all these shitty </v>
<v Speaker 4>connections and let's do it this way and</v>

2213
01:32:10.421 --> 01:32:15.421
<v Speaker 4>let's do it that way and let's connect </v>
<v Speaker 4>to each other through you guys use in </v>

2214
01:32:15.421 --> 01:32:18.841
<v Speaker 4>Wifi version six this week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what we need is this new form of </v>

2215
01:32:19.301 --> 01:32:24.301
<v Speaker 4>Wifi that it uses the particles in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>atmosphere as transistors and and sends </v>

2216
01:32:26.021 --> 01:32:29.530
<v Speaker 4>back and forth to each other through a </v>
<v Speaker 4>highly charged signal and like what?</v>

2217
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:31.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's how'd you figure that out?</v>

2218
01:32:31.811 --> 01:32:33.310
<v Speaker 4>And then next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they,</v>

2219
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:38.430
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to have ego.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to have this desire </v>

2220
01:32:38.430 --> 01:32:41.881
<v Speaker 4>for and this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a real underlying aspect.</v>

2221
01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:47.220
<v Speaker 4>The motivation of the human race,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the desire to recreate and to reproduce </v>

2222
01:32:47.220 --> 01:32:50.140
<v Speaker 4>like this desire for sex and this desire</v>
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>

2223
01:32:50.150 --> 01:32:52.600
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the reasons why people </v>
<v Speaker 4>accomplish things.</v>

2224
01:32:52.630 --> 01:32:57.630
<v Speaker 4>They don't just accomplish things </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they have this desire to see </v>

2225
01:32:57.630 --> 01:33:02.250
<v Speaker 4>what happens when they put these two </v>
<v Speaker 4>things together and what's the result </v>

2226
01:33:02.250 --> 01:33:02.650
<v Speaker 4>they want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want fame,</v>

2227
01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:05.800
<v Speaker 4>they want status,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want power,</v>

2228
01:33:06.010 --> 01:33:11.010
<v Speaker 4>they want money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they want all these things because </v>

2229
01:33:11.010 --> 01:33:11.470
<v Speaker 4>they want to be more sexually </v>
<v Speaker 4>attractive.</v>

2230
01:33:11.471 --> 01:33:13.690
<v Speaker 4>That's a big part of the motivation of </v>
<v Speaker 4>men,</v>

2231
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:15.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's a weird thing.</v>

2232
01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:19.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the reasons why Jeff Bezos</v>

2233
01:33:19.001 --> 01:33:24.001
<v Speaker 4>doesn't just retire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why doesn't Jeff Bezos when he just </v>

2234
01:33:24.001 --> 01:33:24.850
<v Speaker 4>became the richest man in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck you going to spend $90,</v>

2235
01:33:24.851 --> 01:33:29.650
<v Speaker 4>million dollars homes to cash out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cash out and just chillax forever.</v>

2236
01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:34.980
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just walk around with a big red wig on </v>

2237
01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:34.980
<v Speaker 4>so nobody knows who you are and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>live like a king,</v>

2238
01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:40.340
<v Speaker 4>like go wherever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck all this work and you're waking up </v>

2239
01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:43.861
<v Speaker 4>in the morning freaking out about Amazon</v>
<v Speaker 4>and making sure everything gets </v>

2240
01:33:43.861 --> 01:33:47.581
<v Speaker 4>delivered in 30 minutes or less like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking pizza instead just live.</v>

2241
01:33:47.650 --> 01:33:48.790
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no way.</v>

2242
01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:51.550
<v Speaker 4>Jeff Bezos has a fucking supermodel </v>
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend now.</v>

2243
01:33:51.551 --> 01:33:56.551
<v Speaker 4>He's bawling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every good jumped from one gold </v>

2244
01:33:56.551 --> 01:33:56.551
<v Speaker 4>Lamborghini to the next one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2245
01:33:56.551 --> 01:33:57.670
<v Speaker 4>you start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want more.</v>

2246
01:33:57.671 --> 01:33:58.830
<v Speaker 4>I want this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want that whole.</v>

2247
01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:00.700
<v Speaker 4>What is the motivation to do something </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that?</v>

2248
01:34:00.701 --> 01:34:05.701
<v Speaker 4>Where's it coming from in men?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of it comes from this </v>

2249
01:34:05.701 --> 01:34:06.110
<v Speaker 4>need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2250
01:34:06.130 --> 01:34:08.230
<v Speaker 4>I think if you brought it down to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>base level,</v>

2251
01:34:08.231 --> 01:34:13.231
<v Speaker 4>it's this weird biological need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>reproduce or to spread your genes or to </v>

2252
01:34:13.231 --> 01:34:17.551
<v Speaker 4>be to stand out as something </v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly impressive your peacocking </v>

2253
01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:21.760
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for females and a lot of ways,</v>

2254
01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:22.050
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2255
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:22.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2256
01:34:22.730 --> 01:34:23.730
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is,</v>

2257
01:34:23.731 --> 01:34:26.090
<v Speaker 5>there has been a stud.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

2258
01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:29.880
<v Speaker 5>It is amazing to me where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I dream every day about how I can retire</v>

2259
01:34:29.881 --> 01:34:34.230
<v Speaker 5>as quickly as possible and then these </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys that have the means to do it don't.</v>

2260
01:34:34.231 --> 01:34:35.910
<v Speaker 5>But there isn't an internal drive with </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys.</v>

2261
01:34:35.911 --> 01:34:40.911
<v Speaker 5>I mean you don't found a company like </v>
<v Speaker 5>Amazon unless there's something special </v>

2262
01:34:40.911 --> 01:34:40.911
<v Speaker 5>about you and I don't mean that as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>derogatory thing either.</v>

2263
01:34:40.911 --> 01:34:42.750
<v Speaker 5>Like there's something about a person.</v>

2264
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.480
<v Speaker 4>Ironic is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was originally founded to sell books.</v>

2265
01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:50.670
<v Speaker 4>It just was a very simple site.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen the original Amazon?</v>

2266
01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:56.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can go to the wayback machine and </v>

2267
01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:56.060
<v Speaker 5>look at all that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2268
01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:56.060
<v Speaker 5>To</v>

2269
01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 4>really simple site to sell books and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>remember when Amazon starts</v>

2270
01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:59.240
<v Speaker 3>selling other things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2271
01:34:59.510 --> 01:35:01.070
<v Speaker 3>what are they doing that they sell </v>
<v Speaker 3>books?</v>

2272
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:04.220
<v Speaker 3>Why are you selling like fucking kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>toys?</v>

2273
01:35:04.670 --> 01:35:09.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They moved into music and then I think </v>

2274
01:35:09.670 --> 01:35:09.670
<v Speaker 3>they'd been to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they started expanding from there.</v>

2275
01:35:09.670 --> 01:35:09.670
<v Speaker 3>It's funny though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You brought up the,</v>

2276
01:35:09.670 --> 01:35:09.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2277
01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:12.080
<v Speaker 3>the robots making better versions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

2278
01:35:12.081 --> 01:35:12.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2279
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:13.430
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2280
01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:18.460
<v Speaker 3>not to be nerdy about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's exactly what happens in </v>

2281
01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Battlestar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what comes,</v>

2282
01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:18.650
<v Speaker 3>what comes back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fight the humans is not what left,</v>

2283
01:35:18.850 --> 01:35:20.000
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2284
01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:21.680
<v Speaker 3>because they just were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not good enough.</v>

2285
01:35:21.681 --> 01:35:26.681
<v Speaker 3>We can make ourselves better and made </v>
<v Speaker 3>those killer ones that looked like </v>

2286
01:35:26.681 --> 01:35:26.681
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2287
01:35:26.681 --> 01:35:29.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The number that number's wherever they </v>

2288
01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:29.800
<v Speaker 3>call them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then even like,</v>

2289
01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:32.081
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even the centurions look better or </v>

2290
01:35:32.081 --> 01:35:33.970
<v Speaker 3>more effective in their soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's that one episode about the </v>

2291
01:35:33.970 --> 01:35:33.970
<v Speaker 3>raiders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is their ships.</v>

2292
01:35:33.970 --> 01:35:35.330
<v Speaker 3>They have these autonomous ships that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are alive,</v>

2293
01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.510
<v Speaker 3>that are fighter ships and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2294
01:35:37.530 --> 01:35:42.530
<v Speaker 3>how they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them is named scar and he keeps </v>

2295
01:35:42.530 --> 01:35:43.940
<v Speaker 3>having these experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's really a good fighter pilot or</v>

2296
01:35:43.941 --> 01:35:45.500
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's alive.</v>

2297
01:35:45.650 --> 01:35:48.350
<v Speaker 3>And then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really good fucking show.</v>

2298
01:35:48.650 --> 01:35:50.810
<v Speaker 3>Goddamn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bring it back.</v>

2299
01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:55.840
<v Speaker 3>If you guys out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have such a great audience that </v>

2300
01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:55.840
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

2301
01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:56.240
<v Speaker 3>you go check it out the numbers or spike</v>
<v Speaker 3>on that Netflix,</v>

2302
01:35:56.241 --> 01:35:57.860
<v Speaker 3>they'll see it and then they'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2303
01:35:57.861 --> 01:35:59.930
<v Speaker 3>maybe will be if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if folks,</v>

2304
01:35:59.931 --> 01:36:02.050
<v Speaker 3>if you haven't seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you it is a.</v>

2305
01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:05.470
<v Speaker 3>and I think it was psi Phi that made it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a [inaudible],</v>

2306
01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:10.480
<v Speaker 3>like coming to kind of like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a legitimate thing that they did </v>

2307
01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:10.760
<v Speaker 3>and it was very overlooked because </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are like,</v>

2308
01:36:10.761 --> 01:36:12.970
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2309
01:36:13.010 --> 01:36:16.160

<v Speaker 3>but it was really well done.</v>

2310
01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:20.420
<v Speaker 3>Science fiction drama and then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Edward James almost was in it too.</v>

2315
01:36:27.471 --> 01:36:28.730

<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of great actors,</v>

2316
01:36:28.731 --> 01:36:30.650
<v Speaker 3>a lot of great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting characters in there.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>tar.</v>

2326
01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:51.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of people that you hate </v>

2327
01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:51.760
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but God damn was a good show.</v>

2328
01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:51.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was great.</v>

2329
01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:51.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of these,</v>

2330
01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:53.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't see many of these people in </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything today.</v>

2331
01:36:53.090 --> 01:36:54.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2332
01:36:54.170 --> 01:36:56.670
<v Speaker 3>James Edward almost as a famous actor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but otherwise I don't,</v>

2333
01:36:56.671 --> 01:36:57.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't see them sprinkling anyone.</v>

2334
01:36:57.880 --> 01:36:59.660
<v Speaker 3>Not that I watch a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2335
01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:01.520
<v Speaker 3>I know man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always wonder about that.</v>

2336
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:05.540
<v Speaker 3>When you see someone's in some gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit show and then they kind of vanish,</v>

2337
01:37:05.950 --> 01:37:06.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like where,</v>

2338
01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:08.520
<v Speaker 3>where did you go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2339
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:13.870
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they wanted to go do something </v>

2340
01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:13.870
<v Speaker 3>else or maybe they can't get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2341
01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:13.910
<v Speaker 3>I would assume that they all could kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of write their own their own way.</v>

2342
01:37:13.970 --> 01:37:18.970
<v Speaker 3>You think that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think that also people get </v>

2343
01:37:18.970 --> 01:37:18.970
<v Speaker 3>pigeonholed into a character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2344
01:37:18.970 --> 01:37:23.201
<v Speaker 3>there's certain characters where you see</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone and they're on the Sopranos and </v>

2345
01:37:23.201 --> 01:37:26.090
<v Speaker 3>from then on there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christopher moltisanti forever.</v>

2346
01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:29.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's who he is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right forever.</v>

2347
01:37:30.230 --> 01:37:33.200
<v Speaker 3>And it's hard to break out of that for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people.</v>

2348
01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:36.280
<v Speaker 3>The one person that managed to get out </v>
<v Speaker 3>of there was a um,</v>

2349
01:37:36.650 --> 01:37:37.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2350
01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:38.410
<v Speaker 3>the wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't think of her name.</v>

2351
01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:39.180
<v Speaker 3>Can you talk?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go?</v>

2352
01:37:39.181 --> 01:37:40.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was obviously big before that too in</v>

2353
01:37:40.791 --> 01:37:45.791
<v Speaker 3>some things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she didn't nurse Jackie and all </v>

2354
01:37:45.791 --> 01:37:47.321
<v Speaker 3>those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people get managed to break out of </v>

2355
01:37:47.321 --> 01:37:47.321
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're right.</v>

2356
01:37:47.321 --> 01:37:47.321
<v Speaker 3>Did when you were on news radio and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

2357
01:37:47.321 --> 01:37:48.180
<v Speaker 3>did you find when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you went to,</v>

2358
01:37:48.270 --> 01:37:51.140
<v Speaker 3>to casting or anything like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never really acted again.</v>

2359
01:37:51.230 --> 01:37:52.910
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess you found your way into fear,</v>

2360
01:37:52.911 --> 01:37:54.410
<v Speaker 3>fear factor and stuff like that so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

2361
01:37:54.450 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 3>But you never even to do anything after </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2362
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:58.950
<v Speaker 4>I was offered some stuff that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible.</v>

2363
01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:03.650
<v Speaker 4>Like there some sitcoms that just came </v>
<v Speaker 4>my way and you know,</v>

2364
01:38:03.700 --> 01:38:05.790
<v Speaker 4>you read the scripts and they were just </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2365
01:38:05.950 --> 01:38:10.950
<v Speaker 4>The real problem was that news radio was</v>
<v Speaker 4>so good that the curse of being with </v>

2366
01:38:12.330 --> 01:38:17.020
<v Speaker 4>that talented cast and amazing writing </v>
<v Speaker 4>and amazing production and,</v>

2367
01:38:17.290 --> 01:38:20.850
<v Speaker 4>and also nobody knew about us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when we were on the air,</v>

2368
01:38:20.851 --> 01:38:24.840
<v Speaker 4>like people that hear about news radio,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of what people heard about was from</v>

2369
01:38:24.841 --> 01:38:28.140
<v Speaker 4>news radio's reruns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when we went into syndication,</v>

2370
01:38:28.141 --> 01:38:33.141
<v Speaker 4>then we started playing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's when people start really getting </v>

2371
01:38:33.141 --> 01:38:35.550
<v Speaker 4>into news radio news radio really found </v>
<v Speaker 4>a big audience after it was canceled,</v>

2372
01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:37.230
<v Speaker 4>which is ironic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2373
01:38:37.231 --> 01:38:42.231
<v Speaker 4>it's unfortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was good because the show didn't </v>

2374
01:38:42.231 --> 01:38:44.440
<v Speaker 4>have anybody fucking with it very much </v>
<v Speaker 4>like we didn't we.</v>

2375
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:50.000
<v Speaker 4>It was a weird show in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was not a hit like that show was not </v>

2376
01:38:50.221 --> 01:38:51.550
<v Speaker 4>a hit show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While I was on the arrows.</v>

2377
01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:54.030
<v Speaker 4>My friend Lou Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is one of the writers,</v>

2378
01:38:54.210 --> 01:38:57.930
<v Speaker 4>he would wear a different t shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would come down to the table,</v>

2379
01:38:57.931 --> 01:39:02.931
<v Speaker 4>reads in a different t shirt with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>number on it based on what our rankings </v>

2380
01:39:02.931 --> 01:39:04.020
<v Speaker 4>was and the ratings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he came down once and it said,</v>

2381
01:39:04.021 --> 01:39:05.220
<v Speaker 4>number 88.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

2382
01:39:05.221 --> 01:39:06.930
<v Speaker 4>fuck dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're number 88.</v>

2383
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:11.880
<v Speaker 4>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

2384
01:39:11.881 --> 01:39:14.070
<v Speaker 4>we're getting canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they start thinking,</v>

2385
01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:19.100
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why did I get that lease in that </v>

2386
01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:19.100
<v Speaker 4>apartment?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm doomed now.</v>

2387
01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:19.100
<v Speaker 5>My sister Dana was a big fan of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>

2388
01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:23.691
<v Speaker 5>I remember when it was on because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>the youngest by far of all my siblings </v>

2389
01:39:23.691 --> 01:39:24.150
<v Speaker 5>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so she,</v>

2390
01:39:24.151 --> 01:39:29.151
<v Speaker 5>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a little surreal that I'm </v>

2391
01:39:29.151 --> 01:39:29.151
<v Speaker 5>on the show actually for her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

2392
01:39:29.151 --> 01:39:29.151
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2393
01:39:29.151 --> 01:39:33.230
<v Speaker 5>I think it's still on syndication.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I've seen it or maybe maybe </v>

2394
01:39:33.230 --> 01:39:35.030
<v Speaker 5>maybe like those deep channels maybe </v>
<v Speaker 5>like maybe I'm trying to think some</v>

2395
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:40.030
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that one down there or the </v>

2396
01:39:40.030 --> 01:39:40.030
<v Speaker 4>space one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like see that's.</v>

2397
01:39:40.030 --> 01:39:40.160
<v Speaker 4>See the woman meet with a white jumpsuit</v>
<v Speaker 4>on Jamie.</v>

2398
01:39:40.490 --> 01:39:45.490
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a perfect example of how fucking </v>

2399
01:39:45.490 --> 01:39:47.471
<v Speaker 4>weird they were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did these weird ones where we were </v>

2400
01:39:47.471 --> 01:39:47.900
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not it.</v>

2401
01:39:47.901 --> 01:39:49.910
<v Speaker 4>That's not the same one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not the space one.</v>

2402
01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:52.820
<v Speaker 4>We did one where we were in space for </v>
<v Speaker 4>some reason,</v>

2403
01:39:53.090 --> 01:39:56.510
<v Speaker 4>but it was the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was the same fucking newsroom,</v>

2404
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:59.030
<v Speaker 4>but the newsroom was taking place in </v>
<v Speaker 4>space.</v>

2405
01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:04.780
<v Speaker 4>They did a lot of weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did one where we were completely </v>

2406
01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:04.780
<v Speaker 4>underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2407
01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:08.831
<v Speaker 4>we did like a titanic episode where we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we literally filmed the show in waist </v>

2408
01:40:08.931 --> 01:40:13.931
<v Speaker 4>high water and we're on a ship and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>more like old school Lee close like from</v>

2409
01:40:15.291 --> 01:40:15.970
<v Speaker 4>people that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2410
01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:21.060
<v Speaker 4>from the titanic days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just an extremely go to that </v>

2411
01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:22.210
<v Speaker 4>picture down there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go back to that,</v>

2412
01:40:22.211 --> 01:40:27.211
<v Speaker 4>that scroll up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>scroll up with a picture of the cast </v>

2413
01:40:27.211 --> 01:40:27.860
<v Speaker 4>when I'm wearing sunglasses over there </v>
<v Speaker 4>were at some.</v>

2414
01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:31.280
<v Speaker 4>That's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was when we went to the,</v>

2415
01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:34.490
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the emmy's after Phil was murdered.</v>

2416
01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:40.390
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he still lost in the emmys and day for </v>

2417
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:43.160
<v Speaker 4>parents to me right after they gave it </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the guy from frazier.</v>

2418
01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:46.470
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck does he have to do to win?</v>

2419
01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:55.200
<v Speaker 4>Know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was such a hilarious moment where me </v>

2420
01:40:55.891 --> 01:40:58.630
<v Speaker 4>and me and Dave were just laughing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>

2421
01:40:58.750 --> 01:41:01.000
<v Speaker 4>It's just strange times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2422
01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:03.520
<v Speaker 4>It's weird to go back and look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself to from,</v>

2423
01:41:03.790 --> 01:41:06.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was 20 years ago.</v>

2424
01:41:06.770 --> 01:41:08.710
<v Speaker 4>It's a strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you ever,</v>

2425
01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:14.100
<v Speaker 4>do you have any interest in ever doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like this again or you never </v>

2426
01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:14.100
<v Speaker 4>know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no desire.</v>

2427
01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:15.190
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2428
01:41:15.191 --> 01:41:17.170
<v Speaker 4>this is so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so fucking spoiled.</v>

2429
01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:18.970
<v Speaker 4>Come down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sit down with people like you.</v>

2430
01:41:18.971 --> 01:41:20.650
<v Speaker 4>Have a nice conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk,</v>

2431
01:41:21.010 --> 01:41:23.290
<v Speaker 4>talk about interesting things that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening right now.</v>

2432
01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:24.910
<v Speaker 4>It's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2433
01:41:24.911 --> 01:41:25.720
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not that,</v>

2434
01:41:25.721 --> 01:41:27.550
<v Speaker 4>that wasn't fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really fun,</v>

2435
01:41:27.551 --> 01:41:29.800
<v Speaker 4>but it's somebody else's thing and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of work,</v>

2436
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:34.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it took a lot away from my standup.</v>

2437
01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:36.460
<v Speaker 4>It took a lot away from doing other </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

2438
01:41:36.610 --> 01:41:38.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I started doing,</v>

2439
01:41:38.830 --> 01:41:43.830
<v Speaker 4>I started doing UFC commentary back then</v>
<v Speaker 4>too in [inaudible] 97 is when news radio</v>

2440
01:41:45.131 --> 01:41:47.510
<v Speaker 4>was on the air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was actually the interviewer,</v>

2441
01:41:47.530 --> 01:41:52.530
<v Speaker 4>the post-fight interviewer and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would say they would treat me </v>

2442
01:41:53.021 --> 01:41:55.450
<v Speaker 4>literally like I was going off to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>porn.</v>

2443
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:57.580
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are you doing this?</v>

2444
01:41:57.581 --> 01:42:02.581
<v Speaker 4>Like you're going to fly to Alabama to </v>
<v Speaker 4>work for a cage fighting organs and </v>

2445
01:42:02.581 --> 01:42:03.310
<v Speaker 4>you're a fucked up person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2446
01:42:03.610 --> 01:42:05.650
<v Speaker 4>this is the sport of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you're crazy.</v>

2447
01:42:05.710 --> 01:42:07.150
<v Speaker 4>You saw something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people didn't.</v>

2448
01:42:07.151 --> 01:42:08.080
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

2449
01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:10.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2450
01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:13.780
<v Speaker 4>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I probably didn't really see something.</v>

2451
01:42:13.810 --> 01:42:18.250
<v Speaker 4>I just saw what I liked and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for whatever reason,</v>

2452
01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:20.740
<v Speaker 4>good or bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's me 19,</v>

2453
01:42:20.741 --> 01:42:23.710
<v Speaker 4>97 for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good or bad.</v>

2454
01:42:23.740 --> 01:42:27.310
<v Speaker 4>I've always a hundred percent trusted my</v>
<v Speaker 4>instincts.</v>

2455
01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:29.080
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I,</v>

2456
01:42:29.170 --> 01:42:30.400
<v Speaker 4>when I like something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

2457
01:42:30.401 --> 01:42:32.230
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got to go do that because it's what</v>

2458
01:42:32.231 --> 01:42:35.530
<v Speaker 4>I've always done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's what's led me through my life.</v>

2459
01:42:35.890 --> 01:42:39.130
<v Speaker 4>Like if I went back and I've looked at </v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

2460
01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:43.990
<v Speaker 4>my decision to get obsessed with martial</v>
<v Speaker 4>arts or my decision to quit all that and</v>

2461
01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:48.991
<v Speaker 4>get obsessed with standup comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my decision for they made all the </v>

2462
01:42:48.991 --> 01:42:50.590
<v Speaker 4>decisions that I've made have all been </v>
<v Speaker 4>insanely impulsive,</v>

2463
01:42:51.130 --> 01:42:52.360
<v Speaker 4>passionate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>driven,</v>

2464
01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:56.320
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>derided by everyone around me.</v>

2465
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:57.130
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2466
01:42:57.190 --> 01:42:58.120
<v Speaker 4>You're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2467
01:42:58.270 --> 01:43:00.280
<v Speaker 4>But they ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it all worked well.</v>

2468
01:43:00.281 --> 01:43:05.281
<v Speaker 4>It's how your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your story so interesting to me because </v>

2469
01:43:05.281 --> 01:43:07.441
<v Speaker 4>you have legitimately large pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your audience that know you for totally </v>

2470
01:43:07.441 --> 01:43:09.190
<v Speaker 4>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guys that watch UFC and see you kind</v>

2471
01:43:09.191 --> 01:43:09.880
<v Speaker 4>of do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2472
01:43:09.910 --> 01:43:14.910
<v Speaker 4>in that sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you have the guys that watch </v>

2473
01:43:14.910 --> 01:43:17.041
<v Speaker 4>the show and or listen to the show and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you have obviously people that love you </v>

2474
01:43:17.041 --> 01:43:17.041
<v Speaker 4>as a standup comic.</v>

2475
01:43:17.041 --> 01:43:17.860
<v Speaker 4>And then obviously the crossover between</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of those.</v>

2476
01:43:17.861 --> 01:43:22.861
<v Speaker 4>So you've managed to create,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've managed to create like three </v>

2477
01:43:22.861 --> 01:43:23.530
<v Speaker 4>different viable lives that all </v>
<v Speaker 4>intermix.</v>

2478
01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:24.670
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2479
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:29.140
<v Speaker 4>the UFC thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very strange because whether or not</v>

2480
01:43:29.290 --> 01:43:34.090
<v Speaker 4>anybody a agrees with my opinions on </v>
<v Speaker 4>life outside of it,</v>

2481
01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:39.660
<v Speaker 4>they know that when I'm doing commentary</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am doing my absolute best to honor </v>

2482
01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:45.750
<v Speaker 4>what's happening inside the octagon and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a deep knowledge and </v>

2483
01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:48.250
<v Speaker 4>understanding of what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this isn't like.</v>

2484
01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:50.290
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you remember this,</v>

2485
01:43:50.291 --> 01:43:52.010
<v Speaker 4>but Dennis Miller used to do</v>

2486
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:53.330
<v Speaker 2>Monday night football.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do remember that.</v>

2487
01:43:53.331 --> 01:43:54.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People fucking hate.</v>

2488
01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2489
01:43:54.861 --> 01:43:55.340
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2490
01:43:55.341 --> 01:43:56.070
<v Speaker 2>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2491
01:43:56.150 --> 01:43:58.250
<v Speaker 2>it was so mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was so mad at him.</v>

2492
01:43:58.490 --> 01:44:02.300
<v Speaker 2>And this was before I think I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>fear fat or before I was doing,</v>

2493
01:44:02.350 --> 01:44:07.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC or maybe I was doing the post </v>

2494
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:11.141
<v Speaker 2>fight interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I hadn't done the commentary yet </v>

2495
01:44:11.141 --> 01:44:11.141
<v Speaker 2>either one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was like,</v>

2496
01:44:11.141 --> 01:44:16.060
<v Speaker 2>you can't force funny into something </v>
<v Speaker 2>where people want to watch the thing,</v>

2497
01:44:16.970 --> 01:44:21.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can't force funny into like </v>

2498
01:44:21.970 --> 01:44:22.050
<v Speaker 2>alien the movie alien,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2499
01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:23.540
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not supposed to be funny.</v>

2500
01:44:23.570 --> 01:44:28.570
<v Speaker 2>The thing is this is a dramatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrifying science fiction movie.</v>

2501
01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.560
<v Speaker 2>You don't force funny into something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2502
01:44:31.010 --> 01:44:32.860
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I felt like Dennis </v>
<v Speaker 2>Miller is like,</v>

2503
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:36.310
<v Speaker 2>this is just like backwards sharp had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2504
01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:38.330
<v Speaker 2>he's like one liner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one liner,</v>

2505
01:44:38.331 --> 01:44:40.230
<v Speaker 2>like that's his thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2506
01:44:40.250 --> 01:44:40.970
<v Speaker 2>that's what he did.</v>

2507
01:44:41.060 --> 01:44:44.780
<v Speaker 2>But I never did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always just did commentary.</v>

2508
01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:47.780
<v Speaker 2>Like if you heard me do commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless something happens,</v>

2509
01:44:47.781 --> 01:44:49.540
<v Speaker 2>it's fucked up in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2510
01:44:49.690 --> 01:44:53.000
<v Speaker 2>inside the octagon and I have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this?</v>

2511
01:44:53.150 --> 01:44:58.150
<v Speaker 2>And then I go on a rant about something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People would have no idea that I was </v>

2512
01:44:58.150 --> 01:44:58.150
<v Speaker 2>funny at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2513
01:44:58.150 --> 01:45:02.111
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the kind of nurturing those </v>

2514
01:45:02.111 --> 01:45:02.111
<v Speaker 2>different audiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2515
01:45:02.111 --> 01:45:02.111
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2516
01:45:02.111 --> 01:45:02.270
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never thought about that way.</v>

2517
01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:05.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a concerted effort to </v>
<v Speaker 2>nurture anything.</v>

2518
01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:10.540
<v Speaker 2>It's just the UFC in specific is it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

2519
01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:13.880
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about getting out of my own way and</v>

2520
01:45:13.881 --> 01:45:16.850
<v Speaker 2>honoring what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have to kind of honor.</v>

2521
01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:20.120
<v Speaker 2>You've got to think when a guy like </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a big fight this weekend,</v>

2522
01:45:20.121 --> 01:45:21.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tj dillashaw is gonna fight.</v>

2523
01:45:21.621 --> 01:45:26.621
<v Speaker 2>Cody Garbrandt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably the biggest bantamweight </v>

2524
01:45:26.621 --> 01:45:26.621
<v Speaker 2>fight of all time.</v>

2525
01:45:26.621 --> 01:45:27.440
<v Speaker 2>When those two guys get into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>octagon,</v>

2526
01:45:27.441 --> 01:45:32.150
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with the consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the history of an entire division.</v>

2527
01:45:32.230 --> 01:45:37.160
<v Speaker 2>The probably the two best champions in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that division going at it.</v>

2528
01:45:37.190 --> 01:45:42.190
<v Speaker 2>The two of the three best champions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dominick Cruz being the other one going </v>

2529
01:45:42.190 --> 01:45:43.490
<v Speaker 2>at it in this historical match up like </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot.</v>

2530
01:45:43.491 --> 01:45:46.780
<v Speaker 2>You have a lot of responsibility and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to think about it that way.</v>

2531
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:48.890
<v Speaker 2>It's not about you at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2532
01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:49.210
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2533
01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:51.230
<v Speaker 2>I think it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

2534
01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:56.280
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting because I feel like </v>

2535
01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:56.480
<v Speaker 2>I've actually been challenged in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>same way.</v>

2536
01:45:56.481 --> 01:46:01.481
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I came up as a gaming </v>

2537
01:46:01.481 --> 01:46:03.341
<v Speaker 2>commentator and Dennis Miller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of the reason people were </v>

2538
01:46:03.341 --> 01:46:07.031
<v Speaker 2>kind of concerned about him too is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he would tell political jokes or bring </v>

2539
01:46:07.031 --> 01:46:10.540
<v Speaker 2>political things in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was unheard of at the time on </v>

2540
01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:10.540
<v Speaker 2>Monday night football around football </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the NFL generally,</v>

2541
01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:11.900
<v Speaker 2>and now it's part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part and parcel with the NFL.</v>

2542
01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:13.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge football fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>

2543
01:46:13.150 --> 01:46:14.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm bearing witness to it every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every week.</v>

2544
01:46:15.130 --> 01:46:16.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2545
01:46:16.131 --> 01:46:20.960
<v Speaker 2>as a gaming commentator I've often found</v>
<v Speaker 2>some difficulty in keeping out shades of</v>

2546
01:46:20.961 --> 01:46:25.430
<v Speaker 2>that shades of politics and kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>social commentary and what I did as well</v>

2547
01:46:25.431 --> 01:46:27.320
<v Speaker 2>and that all that's certainly alienated </v>
<v Speaker 2>some people,</v>

2548
01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:29.690
<v Speaker 2>but I also think it engendered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2549
01:46:29.691 --> 01:46:34.691
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's honest and just tells you </v>

2550
01:46:34.691 --> 01:46:34.691
<v Speaker 2>exactly what he thinks as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was,</v>

2551
01:46:34.691 --> 01:46:34.720
<v Speaker 2>I was able to benefit from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also don't have the audience that,</v>

2552
01:46:34.850 --> 01:46:39.850
<v Speaker 2>that you have as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think keeping it structured and </v>

2553
01:46:39.850 --> 01:46:39.850
<v Speaker 2>separated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is wise,</v>

2554
01:46:39.850 --> 01:46:39.850
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is sometimes,</v>

2555
01:46:39.850 --> 01:46:44.651
<v Speaker 2>but it's also sometimes wise to just be </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself and that way you never have to </v>

2556
01:46:44.651 --> 01:46:45.620
<v Speaker 2>worry if people like you for who you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

2557
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:48.470
<v Speaker 2>If you pretend to be someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's like,</v>

2558
01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:50.220
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to bring</v>

2559
01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:55.250
<v Speaker 4>him up again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but cosby is one of the grossest parts </v>

2560
01:46:55.250 --> 01:46:58.581
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had it in our head that this guy was </v>

2561
01:46:58.581 --> 01:47:00.170
<v Speaker 4>this squeaky clean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2562
01:47:00.980 --> 01:47:05.550
<v Speaker 4>Middle America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect example of this ethical,</v>

2563
01:47:05.551 --> 01:47:07.530
<v Speaker 4>moral guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile I was a fucking rapist.</v>

2564
01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:11.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're around something like that,</v>

2565
01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:14.700
<v Speaker 4>you appreciate someone who's just </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves,</v>

2566
01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:16.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2567
01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:18.900
<v Speaker 4>obviously you don't appreciate him if he</v>
<v Speaker 4>himself is a rapist.</v>

2568
01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:21.120
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's maybe a bad example,</v>

2569
01:47:21.121 --> 01:47:22.440
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what,</v>

2570
01:47:22.460 --> 01:47:23.940
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you define yourself as?</v>

2571
01:47:23.941 --> 01:47:26.040
<v Speaker 4>Do you think of yourself as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>libertarian?</v>

2572
01:47:26.090 --> 01:47:27.510
<v Speaker 4>Are you a Republican?</v>

2573
01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:28.410
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was a republican.</v>

2574
01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:30.840
<v Speaker 5>I left the party after trump won the </v>
<v Speaker 5>nomination.</v>

2575
01:47:30.890 --> 01:47:31.990
<v Speaker 5>You like enough?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2576
01:47:31.991 --> 01:47:32.670
<v Speaker 5>because I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>

2577
01:47:32.671 --> 01:47:37.671
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't stand them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I consider myself a moderate republican </v>

2578
01:47:37.671 --> 01:47:40.720
<v Speaker 5>or a moderate conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't you think it's interesting that </v>

2579
01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:41.070
<v Speaker 5>trump was a democrat his whole life?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2580
01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:43.350
<v Speaker 5>I think he's just an opportunist and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2581
01:47:43.410 --> 01:47:45.420
<v Speaker 5>and I think the Republicans wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 5>just win.</v>

2582
01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:50.800
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I also think he had 17 people in </v>

2583
01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:53.151
<v Speaker 5>that field or 16 other people in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>field and he was winning primaries and </v>

2584
01:47:53.151 --> 01:47:53.700
<v Speaker 5>caucuses with 35 percent of the vote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2585
01:47:54.090 --> 01:47:59.090
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then he obviously I have no problem </v>

2586
01:47:59.090 --> 01:47:59.090
<v Speaker 5>with the electoral college,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he didn't win the popular vote.</v>

2587
01:47:59.090 --> 01:47:59.120
<v Speaker 5>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2588
01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:00.690
<v Speaker 5>so to me I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2589
01:48:00.691 --> 01:48:02.130
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I identify as conservative.</v>

2590
01:48:02.131 --> 01:48:04.710
<v Speaker 5>I feel like the word libertarian has </v>
<v Speaker 5>been totally bastardized.</v>

2591
01:48:04.711 --> 01:48:07.650
<v Speaker 5>Like we were talking about words that </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't mean anything anymore where people</v>

2592
01:48:07.651 --> 01:48:09.420
<v Speaker 5>almost look at libertarianism is like </v>
<v Speaker 5>anarchy.</v>

2593
01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:11.490
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and to me,</v>

2594
01:48:11.491 --> 01:48:13.170
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a social libertarian.</v>

2595
01:48:13.171 --> 01:48:14.430
<v Speaker 5>I always call myself a social </v>
<v Speaker 5>libertarian.</v>

2596
01:48:14.431 --> 01:48:16.620
<v Speaker 5>I believe that drugs should be </v>
<v Speaker 5>decriminalized.</v>

2597
01:48:16.621 --> 01:48:17.820
<v Speaker 5>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2598
01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:22.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously this stage and be really </v>

2599
01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:22.880
<v Speaker 5>involved in litigating who isn't getting</v>
<v Speaker 5>married.</v>

2600
01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:27.411
<v Speaker 5>I think if you want to have a polygamous</v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship and everyone's cool with </v>

2601
01:48:27.411 --> 01:48:27.411
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's fine.</v>

2602
01:48:27.411 --> 01:48:28.530
<v Speaker 5>All of that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A prostitution should be legal.</v>

2603
01:48:28.531 --> 01:48:31.410
<v Speaker 5>I think all of that is true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But from a governmental standpoint,</v>

2604
01:48:31.411 --> 01:48:33.160
<v Speaker 5>I think that the government has a place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2605
01:48:33.630 --> 01:48:36.990
<v Speaker 5>I think that the government can do </v>
<v Speaker 5>positive things that only the government</v>

2606
01:48:36.991 --> 01:48:37.960
<v Speaker 5>can do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2607
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:38.880
<v Speaker 5>and so I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

2608
01:48:39.390 --> 01:48:41.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm also a protectionist and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I also don't,</v>

2609
01:48:41.490 --> 01:48:44.160
<v Speaker 5>I also don't believe in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>libertarian mantra.</v>

2610
01:48:44.161 --> 01:48:45.860
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people call me a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>

2611
01:48:45.861 --> 01:48:46.770
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2612
01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:48.180
<v Speaker 5>I haven't called myself that in a long </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

2613
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:50.490
<v Speaker 5>What makes you lean towards </v>
<v Speaker 5>conservatism?</v>

2614
01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:53.070
<v Speaker 5>A conservatism to me is simply,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2615
01:48:53.370 --> 01:48:58.370
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea that government shouldn't be </v>

2616
01:48:58.370 --> 01:49:01.161
<v Speaker 5>involved where it doesn't need to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>involved if there is no justification </v>

2617
01:49:01.161 --> 01:49:01.161
<v Speaker 5>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2618
01:49:01.161 --> 01:49:01.520
<v Speaker 5>so if someone</v>

2619
01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:03.270
<v Speaker 4>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wouldn't think conservative.</v>

2620
01:49:03.271 --> 01:49:06.000
<v Speaker 4>You've got an earring,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got tattoos and a young guy.</v>

2621
01:49:06.210 --> 01:49:09.690
<v Speaker 4>You're not a hipster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say a hipster,</v>

2622
01:49:09.691 --> 01:49:11.620
<v Speaker 4>but your millennial less.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2623
01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:13.370
<v Speaker 5>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was funny,</v>

2624
01:49:13.371 --> 01:49:15.050
<v Speaker 5>I was listening to some guy talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about me,</v>

2625
01:49:15.051 --> 01:49:16.370
<v Speaker 5>I want of his political shows and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2626
01:49:16.670 --> 01:49:19.010
<v Speaker 5>and he presents his hip and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know what number.</v>

2627
01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:20.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I present this hip anytime.</v>

2628
01:49:21.010 --> 01:49:22.480
<v Speaker 5>That's not a bad idea too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

2629
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:23.270
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2630
01:49:23.271 --> 01:49:23.750
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never,</v>

2631
01:49:23.751 --> 01:49:26.570
<v Speaker 5>no one's ever called me hit before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

2632
01:49:26.571 --> 01:49:28.430
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even a thing anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hipster,</v>

2633
01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:29.080
<v Speaker 5>hipster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2634
01:49:29.081 --> 01:49:29.960
<v Speaker 5>I don't want this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your hip,</v>

2635
01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:31.010
<v Speaker 5>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2636
01:49:31.011 --> 01:49:36.011
<v Speaker 5>I guess I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even really understand exactly </v>

2637
01:49:36.011 --> 01:49:38.440
<v Speaker 5>know a hipster when you see one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I still can't really tell you what </v>

2638
01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:38.440
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what it means.</v>

2639
01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:38.440
<v Speaker 5>You can see some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2640
01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:38.600
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see them coming.</v>

2641
01:49:38.730 --> 01:49:39.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the big,</v>

2642
01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:44.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes the big ads glasses and the </v>

2643
01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:44.810
<v Speaker 5>crazy out of a teaches on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2644
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:46.850
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I consider myself a conservative simply.</v>

2645
01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:49.030
<v Speaker 5>I believe that the government is too </v>
<v Speaker 5>big.</v>

2646
01:49:49.130 --> 01:49:50.920
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that the government doesn't need</v>

2647
01:49:50.921 --> 01:49:52.570
<v Speaker 5>to be involved in everything that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>involved in.</v>

2648
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:57.870
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think that the idea of </v>

2649
01:49:57.870 --> 01:49:57.870
<v Speaker 5>conservatism is simply inconsistent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2650
01:49:57.870 --> 01:49:59.810
<v Speaker 5>I think the conservative position on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the web,</v>

2651
01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:04.860
<v Speaker 5>a women's right to choose is pro choice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's prolife I think that </v>

2652
01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:08.491
<v Speaker 5>the conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it means that the government's </v>

2653
01:50:08.491 --> 01:50:08.491
<v Speaker 5>not telling you what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just as if it just,</v>

2654
01:50:08.491 --> 01:50:10.660
<v Speaker 5>as the government doesn't have the right</v>
<v Speaker 5>to have confiscatory taxes,</v>

2655
01:50:10.690 --> 01:50:12.550
<v Speaker 5>just like the government doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 5>the right to take your guns.</v>

2656
01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:13.960
<v Speaker 5>The government doesn't have the right to</v>
<v Speaker 5>tell you.</v>

2657
01:50:13.961 --> 01:50:18.961
<v Speaker 5>You can't marry a man if you're a man </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the government doesn't have a right </v>

2658
01:50:18.961 --> 01:50:18.961
<v Speaker 5>to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2659
01:50:18.961 --> 01:50:18.961
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all,</v>

2660
01:50:18.961 --> 01:50:19.270
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you can't have an abortion.</v>

2661
01:50:19.271 --> 01:50:24.271
<v Speaker 5>So the true classic sense of </v>
<v Speaker 5>conservative ideals versus what we see </v>

2662
01:50:24.271 --> 01:50:27.580
<v Speaker 5>today where it's sort of a mixture of </v>
<v Speaker 5>conservative philosophy,</v>

2663
01:50:27.581 --> 01:50:29.330
<v Speaker 5>but the religious influence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2664
01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:32.020
<v Speaker 5>There's a tremendous amount of religious</v>
<v Speaker 5>influence because,</v>

2665
01:50:32.110 --> 01:50:33.310
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from the Reagan days,</v>

2666
01:50:33.311 --> 01:50:33.790
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When,</v>

2667
01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:36.580
<v Speaker 5>when Reagan sort of courted the </v>
<v Speaker 5>religious,</v>

2668
01:50:36.581 --> 01:50:37.150
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2669
01:50:37.151 --> 01:50:41.980
<v Speaker 5>it actually started with like even even </v>
<v Speaker 5>Nixon and it's the southern strategy and</v>

2670
01:50:41.981 --> 01:50:43.330
<v Speaker 5>all those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the idea that,</v>

2671
01:50:43.690 --> 01:50:44.860
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2672
01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:47.230
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the map has changed like we in,</v>

2673
01:50:47.650 --> 01:50:52.650
<v Speaker 5>in American politics until really the </v>
<v Speaker 5>civil war parties were coming and going </v>

2674
01:50:52.650 --> 01:50:53.970
<v Speaker 5>constantly like that parties where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2675
01:50:54.010 --> 01:50:56.710
<v Speaker 5>the federalist in anti-federalists by </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Times James Madison had James Monroe</v>

2676
01:50:56.711 --> 01:50:59.080
<v Speaker 5>or president,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are really antiquated terms.</v>

2677
01:50:59.110 --> 01:51:01.960
<v Speaker 5>Those were only five presidents in </v>
<v Speaker 5>between Madison and you know,</v>

2678
01:51:02.110 --> 01:51:03.910
<v Speaker 5>or Montereau and Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2679
01:51:04.540 --> 01:51:06.010
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we had this churn,</v>

2680
01:51:06.220 --> 01:51:08.880
<v Speaker 5>the know nothings free soil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these kinds of things.</v>

2681
01:51:08.881 --> 01:51:11.860
<v Speaker 5>And suddenly the Democrats come out </v>
<v Speaker 5>during antebellum America.</v>

2682
01:51:11.861 --> 01:51:16.861
<v Speaker 5>Republicanism begins in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 5>56 and you have this idea of these </v>

2683
01:51:16.871 --> 01:51:21.871
<v Speaker 5>parties that just exists still to this </v>
<v Speaker 5>day and simply morph constantly into </v>

2684
01:51:21.871 --> 01:51:22.090
<v Speaker 5>these different things.</v>

2685
01:51:22.450 --> 01:51:24.670
<v Speaker 5>Making me wonder why we don't just have </v>
<v Speaker 5>new parties constantly.</v>

2686
01:51:24.671 --> 01:51:29.671
<v Speaker 5>But to your point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the reason that conservatism and </v>

2687
01:51:29.671 --> 01:51:32.101
<v Speaker 5>liberalism aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these aren't in these neat buckets </v>

2688
01:51:32.101 --> 01:51:34.141
<v Speaker 5>anymore is because they're tied to these</v>
<v Speaker 5>parties and they have to constantly </v>

2689
01:51:34.141 --> 01:51:37.321
<v Speaker 5>justify themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Republicans under ulysses s grant </v>

2690
01:51:37.321 --> 01:51:37.321
<v Speaker 5>and Teddy Roosevelt were the original </v>
<v Speaker 5>progressives.</v>

2691
01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:40.660
<v Speaker 5>They were the ones that wanted land to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be set aside for national parks.</v>

2692
01:51:40.661 --> 01:51:42.580
<v Speaker 5>They were the ones that freed obviously </v>
<v Speaker 5>the slaves,</v>

2693
01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:47.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not so much Teddy Roosevelt as much as </v>

2694
01:51:47.700 --> 01:51:49.541
<v Speaker 5>the ulysses s grant and all of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>kinds of things and suddenly everything </v>

2695
01:51:49.541 --> 01:51:49.960
<v Speaker 5>changes and then suddenly everything </v>
<v Speaker 5>changes again and so on and so forth.</v>

2696
01:51:50.230 --> 01:51:52.780
<v Speaker 5>And so none of these words have any </v>
<v Speaker 5>definitions anymore,</v>

2697
01:51:52.990 --> 01:51:57.990
<v Speaker 5>which is why I didn't identify with </v>
<v Speaker 5>republicanism anymore because I was </v>

2698
01:51:57.990 --> 01:52:01.021
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I consider myself a moderate </v>

2699
01:52:01.021 --> 01:52:02.641
<v Speaker 5>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what's conservative about </v>

2700
01:52:02.641 --> 01:52:02.641
<v Speaker 5>evangelicalism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's conservative,</v>

2701
01:52:02.641 --> 01:52:02.890
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

2702
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:08.030
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even even ideas like free trade and </v>

2703
01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:08.030
<v Speaker 5>stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the idea of just having these,</v>

2704
01:52:08.170 --> 01:52:13.170
<v Speaker 5>these open markets that destroy your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your ability to manufacture things that </v>

2705
01:52:13.170 --> 01:52:13.570
<v Speaker 5>drive wages down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that do all these kinds of things.</v>

2706
01:52:13.570 --> 01:52:15.190
<v Speaker 5>Nothing conservative about that at all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2707
01:52:15.210 --> 01:52:17.620
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so to me I was like,</v>

2708
01:52:17.621 --> 01:52:20.350
<v Speaker 5>I just had to find my own way forward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I just consider myself independent,</v>

2709
01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:21.550
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2710
01:52:21.551 --> 01:52:24.430
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I feel like I'm consistent in what I</v>

2711
01:52:24.431 --> 01:52:29.431
<v Speaker 5>say because I think you can match them </v>
<v Speaker 5>all up and I don't think there's any </v>

2712
01:52:29.431 --> 01:52:29.860
<v Speaker 5>consistency in saying you can't marry </v>
<v Speaker 5>this man.</v>

2713
01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:31.810
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but don't take my gun.</v>

2714
01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:34.780
<v Speaker 5>You can't have this polygamous </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship,</v>

2715
01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:36.280
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2716
01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:38.170
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we should have prayer in school.</v>

2717
01:52:38.530 --> 01:52:39.040
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't,</v>

2718
01:52:39.070 --> 01:52:40.690
<v Speaker 5>these things will make sense to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2719
01:52:40.691 --> 01:52:42.100
<v Speaker 5>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to be consistent.</v>

2720
01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:43.930
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the religious things always seemed to me</v>

2721
01:52:43.931 --> 01:52:45.950
<v Speaker 5>to be compromised as to get the support</v>

2722
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:50.980
<v Speaker 4>of the religious right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like they moved towards those </v>

2723
01:52:50.980 --> 01:52:54.431
<v Speaker 4>directions because it sort of reinforces</v>
<v Speaker 4>the power that they have behind them </v>

2724
01:52:54.431 --> 01:52:55.010
<v Speaker 4>because they're the only candidates that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are willing to do that.</v>

2725
01:52:55.011 --> 01:52:56.990
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas the left is not willing to.</v>

2726
01:52:57.020 --> 01:53:02.020
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not willing to go down that </v>

2727
01:53:02.020 --> 01:53:04.241
<v Speaker 4>religious road in the sense of a woman's</v>
<v Speaker 4>right to choose and the sense of a lot </v>

2728
01:53:04.241 --> 01:53:06.440
<v Speaker 4>of things that they get liberals to </v>
<v Speaker 4>support them.</v>

2729
01:53:06.710 --> 01:53:09.410
<v Speaker 4>It would be antithetical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would lose that support.</v>

2730
01:53:09.650 --> 01:53:14.650
<v Speaker 4>But do you think that a guy like having </v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy like trump in office that one of </v>

2731
01:53:14.650 --> 01:53:18.011
<v Speaker 4>the good things about having a guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's obviously fairly unhinged and </v>

2732
01:53:18.980 --> 01:53:23.980
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous is that we need to reconsider</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what it is to be a president and </v>

2733
01:53:25.640 --> 01:53:30.640
<v Speaker 4>this idea that this guy could get into </v>
<v Speaker 4>this position by just sort of calling </v>

2734
01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:35.591
<v Speaker 4>everybody and doing a lot of make </v>
<v Speaker 4>America great again speeches and saying </v>

2735
01:53:36.351 --> 01:53:41.351
<v Speaker 4>a lot of crazy shit about we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>build that wall 10 feet higher and all </v>

2736
01:53:41.351 --> 01:53:44.981
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other nutty rhetoric that went on </v>

2737
01:53:44.981 --> 01:53:47.261
<v Speaker 4>during the campaign and then seeing him </v>
<v Speaker 4>in office and seeing who knows if he's </v>

2738
01:53:47.261 --> 01:53:48.470
<v Speaker 4>going to get out of these four years </v>
<v Speaker 4>without going to jail.</v>

2739
01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:49.180
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2740
01:53:49.230 --> 01:53:50.050
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I,</v>

2741
01:53:50.051 --> 01:53:51.800
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that there is,</v>

2742
01:53:51.801 --> 01:53:55.310
<v Speaker 5>I think you can glean positive and </v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously negative things out of trump's</v>

2743
01:53:55.311 --> 01:53:56.300
<v Speaker 5>administration so far.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2744
01:53:56.360 --> 01:54:01.360
<v Speaker 5>What do you glean positive?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think what's positive is what we were </v>

2745
01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:03.881
<v Speaker 5>talking about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the system works that like nothing </v>

2746
01:54:03.881 --> 01:54:03.881
<v Speaker 5>has broken,</v>
<v Speaker 5>broken down at all.</v>

2747
01:54:03.881 --> 01:54:08.290
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we've seen from the circuit courts </v>

2748
01:54:08.290 --> 01:54:09.050
<v Speaker 5>all the way to the Supreme Court and </v>
<v Speaker 5>with Congress that there actually are,</v>

2749
01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:14.200
<v Speaker 5>these are legitimately viable and </v>
<v Speaker 5>independent bodies and the and the </v>

2750
01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:14.980
<v Speaker 5>checks and balance system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2751
01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:17.900
<v Speaker 5>And this is why I think it's so deeply </v>
<v Speaker 5>offensive to,</v>

2752
01:54:17.930 --> 01:54:18.650
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

2753
01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:19.850
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a way it'd be like,</v>

2754
01:54:19.851 --> 01:54:21.520
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fascism alive in America and,</v>

2755
01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:22.490
<v Speaker 5>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>

2756
01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:27.520
<v Speaker 5>it's not what fascism would've looked </v>
<v Speaker 5>like from a governmental standpoint is </v>

2757
01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:30.941
<v Speaker 5>trump's coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>suspending the supreme court dismissing </v>

2758
01:54:30.941 --> 01:54:31.680
<v Speaker 5>Congress and trying all these crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>things that would have happened.</v>

2759
01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:34.610
<v Speaker 5>And that's what fascism looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What fascism does it look like?</v>

2760
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:37.430
<v Speaker 5>Is you passing a travel ban and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>supreme court saying no,</v>

2761
01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:39.620
<v Speaker 5>and then you're trying to pass it again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the circuit courts say,</v>

2762
01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:40.810
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2763
01:54:40.811 --> 01:54:43.880
<v Speaker 5>and that's not what fascism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what republicanism,</v>

2764
01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:48.940
<v Speaker 5>small r republicanism looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I think we can glean positive </v>

2765
01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:52.390
<v Speaker 5>things out of this that people got mad </v>
<v Speaker 5>at me after the election because I was </v>

2766
01:54:52.390 --> 01:54:52.390
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the world's not ending.</v>

2767
01:54:52.390 --> 01:54:54.440
<v Speaker 5>I actually tweeted it that night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People were losing their minds.</v>

2768
01:54:54.441 --> 01:54:55.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's gonna,</v>

2769
01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:58.010
<v Speaker 5>be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are super emotional.</v>

2770
01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:00.470
<v Speaker 5>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but understand what we've survived.</v>

2771
01:55:00.471 --> 01:55:02.510
<v Speaker 5>We understand when we've had elections,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what has happened,</v>

2772
01:55:02.511 --> 01:55:05.690
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had an election in 18,</v>

2773
01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:07.040
<v Speaker 5>60,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and really,</v>

2774
01:55:07.041 --> 01:55:12.041
<v Speaker 5>and even in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 5>56 and 1952 when things started to </v>

2775
01:55:12.041 --> 01:55:12.041
<v Speaker 5>really start to fall apart and we had </v>
<v Speaker 5>one in 18,</v>

2776
01:55:12.041 --> 01:55:16.301
<v Speaker 5>64 during the civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we had an election in 1932 during the </v>

2777
01:55:16.301 --> 01:55:16.301
<v Speaker 5>depression.</v>

2778
01:55:16.301 --> 01:55:20.650
<v Speaker 5>We had an election in 1944 when we were </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting the Nazis and the Japanese at </v>

2779
01:55:20.650 --> 01:55:21.410
<v Speaker 5>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can survive this way.</v>

2780
01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:23.170
<v Speaker 5>We didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one came in and said like,</v>

2781
01:55:23.180 --> 01:55:25.820
<v Speaker 5>we don't need an election now or on </v>
<v Speaker 5>toward.</v>

2782
01:55:25.821 --> 01:55:30.821
<v Speaker 5>Things were happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We still went through the rigors of our </v>

2783
01:55:30.821 --> 01:55:30.860
<v Speaker 5>system every four years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything stood up.</v>

2784
01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:35.050
<v Speaker 5>Everything was fine and that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>suggestion that Donald Trump is going to</v>

2785
01:55:35.051 --> 01:55:37.130
<v Speaker 5>be the guy that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the confederates didn't do it,</v>

2786
01:55:37.131 --> 01:55:38.830
<v Speaker 5>the Nazis didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Japanese didn't do it.</v>

2787
01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:43.840
<v Speaker 5>Nothing to Donald Trump's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>the one that destroys the American </v>

2788
01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:43.840
<v Speaker 5>republic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's absurd.</v>

2789
01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:43.840
<v Speaker 5>And so I and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I take,</v>

2790
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:47.900
<v Speaker 3>I take that as a positive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I take is a negative is it?</v>

2791
01:55:47.930 --> 01:55:49.710
<v Speaker 3>We're just wasting time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just time wasted.</v>

2792
01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:51.600
<v Speaker 3>It's good theater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's entertaining,</v>

2793
01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:55.680
<v Speaker 3>but it's not funny because nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've not gotten anything done.</v>

2794
01:55:55.980 --> 01:55:58.350
<v Speaker 3>And I want tax cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's great.</v>

2795
01:55:58.470 --> 01:56:03.470
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want some reasonable things happening </v>

2796
01:56:03.470 --> 01:56:03.470
<v Speaker 3>that the congress can pass with trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sign,</v>

2797
01:56:03.470 --> 01:56:04.980
<v Speaker 3>but I think these are just wasted four </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

2798
01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:06.360
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's not funny at all.</v>

2799
01:56:06.361 --> 01:56:07.270
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2800
01:56:07.340 --> 01:56:09.420
<v Speaker 3>it's making the problems worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lot of wheel spinning.</v>

2801
01:56:09.690 --> 01:56:11.610
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have deep problems,</v>

2802
01:56:11.611 --> 01:56:12.780
<v Speaker 3>$20,000,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>in debt,</v>

2803
01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:14.710
<v Speaker 3>a massive deficit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2804
01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:16.890
<v Speaker 3>we're spending $600,</v>
<v Speaker 3>billion on our military,</v>

2805
01:56:16.891 --> 01:56:20.280
<v Speaker 3>$600,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>on our military.</v>

2806
01:56:20.550 --> 01:56:22.140
<v Speaker 3>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>

2807
01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:24.540
<v Speaker 3>We have to start asking ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions of geopolitics.</v>

2808
01:56:24.750 --> 01:56:29.750
<v Speaker 3>Do we need to be in Japan anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we need to have these bases and </v>

2809
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.750
<v Speaker 3>Poland?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we need to,</v>

2810
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a lot of weight,</v>

2811
01:56:29.970 --> 01:56:34.970
<v Speaker 3>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can't get past this buffoon that's </v>

2812
01:56:34.970 --> 01:56:34.970
<v Speaker 3>our president in order to start asking </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves the questions.</v>

2813
01:56:34.970 --> 01:56:39.610
<v Speaker 3>So we just have to punt until a normal </v>
<v Speaker 3>person's in there again and I think </v>

2814
01:56:39.610 --> 01:56:39.810
<v Speaker 3>we'll get a normal pr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he'll survive his turn,</v>

2815
01:56:39.811 --> 01:56:41.340
<v Speaker 3>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he'll run again.</v>

2816
01:56:41.341 --> 01:56:42.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm of the mind that he won't run again.</v>

2817
01:56:43.050 --> 01:56:45.300
<v Speaker 3>Specifically specifically already ran </v>
<v Speaker 3>for reelection.</v>

2818
01:56:45.301 --> 01:56:46.290
<v Speaker 3>He's already filed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he,</v>

2819
01:56:46.291 --> 01:56:46.920
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's filing it.</v>

2820
01:56:46.921 --> 01:56:48.060
<v Speaker 3>He's raising money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I specific,</v>

2821
01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:53.120
<v Speaker 3>I think that one's Kellyanne Conway and </v>
<v Speaker 3>these other people that are engineered </v>

2822
01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:53.910
<v Speaker 3>the election for them to begin with </v>
<v Speaker 3>after the midterms,</v>

2823
01:56:53.911 --> 01:56:55.140
<v Speaker 3>which I think are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

2824
01:56:55.230 --> 01:56:57.810
<v Speaker 3>I think the midterms actually benefit in</v>
<v Speaker 3>some ways the Republicans because of the</v>

2825
01:56:57.811 --> 01:57:02.811
<v Speaker 3>map in the Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think that when it becomes clear </v>

2826
01:57:02.811 --> 01:57:06.951
<v Speaker 3>that he can not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you were thinking you were going </v>

2827
01:57:06.951 --> 01:57:06.951
<v Speaker 3>again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2828
01:57:06.951 --> 01:57:10.111
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's interesting because I'm friends </v>

2829
01:57:10.111 --> 01:57:10.111
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good friends.</v>

2830
01:57:10.111 --> 01:57:10.950
<v Speaker 3>I went to college with this girl who's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lobbyist in Washington.</v>

2831
01:57:10.970 --> 01:57:15.970
<v Speaker 3>She is a Democrat and she's pretty well </v>
<v Speaker 3>connected and I had dinner with her a </v>

2832
01:57:15.970 --> 01:57:19.730
<v Speaker 3>couple weeks ago and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only will trump running and he'll </v>

2833
01:57:19.730 --> 01:57:21.800
<v Speaker 3>win and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this was when everything was going </v>

2834
01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:23.931
<v Speaker 3>on and all this and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't see him subjecting himself </v>

2835
01:57:23.931 --> 01:57:24.540
<v Speaker 3>to the possibility of losing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He won once,</v>

2836
01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:29.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it reminds me of 2004 when Bush won </v>

2837
01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:29.660
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he also won the popular vote,</v>

2838
01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:34.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd be carry and it kinda legitimize </v>

2839
01:57:34.120 --> 01:57:34.800
<v Speaker 3>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that trump is gonna risk further</v>

2840
01:57:34.801 --> 01:57:37.140
<v Speaker 3>illegitimized himself by subjecting </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself to,</v>

2841
01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:42.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only a primary which is going to </v>

2842
01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:44.120
<v Speaker 3>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the death knell for an </v>

2843
01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:44.120
<v Speaker 3>incumbent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think Gerald,</v>

2844
01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:44.670
<v Speaker 3>Gerald Ford,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy Carter,</v>

2845
01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:47.430
<v Speaker 3>how that went for them when they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>primary because they were so unpopular.</v>

2846
01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:49.100
<v Speaker 3>And then he goes in and there's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be the dumb.</v>

2847
01:57:49.150 --> 01:57:51.000
<v Speaker 3>If the Democrats are smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they put someone up that's really good.</v>

2848
01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:52.360
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2849
01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:57.380
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I also think there's gonna be an </v>

2850
01:57:57.380 --> 01:57:57.380
<v Speaker 3>independent candidate that's gonna screw</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything up as well.</v>

2851
01:57:57.380 --> 01:58:00.620
<v Speaker 3>So I think he has a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very high likelihood of running again </v>

2852
01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:02.760
<v Speaker 3>and I think he could absolutely could </v>
<v Speaker 3>win again.</v>

2853
01:58:02.850 --> 01:58:07.850
<v Speaker 3>Do you think you'll win the primary?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm not even sure he would get </v>

2854
01:58:07.850 --> 01:58:07.850
<v Speaker 3>through the primary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2855
01:58:07.850 --> 01:58:08.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean it all depends on what happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the next three years.</v>

2856
01:58:08.941 --> 01:58:12.870
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I'm in no way shape or form a </v>
<v Speaker 3>political expert,</v>

2857
01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:19.040
<v Speaker 3>but I think that we got a lot of dummies</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this country and all we need is </v>

2858
01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:21.090
<v Speaker 3>momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you need is one event,</v>

2859
01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:24.690
<v Speaker 3>some big thing to happen where Donald </v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump solves a problem.</v>

2860
01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:29.720
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember how happy people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>with George Bush directly after World </v>

2861
01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:30.510
<v Speaker 3>War war?</v>
<v Speaker 3>More war after September 11th,</v>

2862
01:58:31.300 --> 01:58:36.300
<v Speaker 3>after September 11th and he made a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 3>of speeches and set a bunch of things </v>

2863
01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:40.251
<v Speaker 3>and his approval rating shot 90 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that shot up and </v>

2864
01:58:40.251 --> 01:58:41.440
<v Speaker 3>people were very excited and they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2865
01:58:41.441 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This</v>

2866
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:44.950
<v Speaker 4>is the reason why we need sort of a good</v>
<v Speaker 4>old boy president,</v>

2867
01:58:45.150 --> 01:58:50.150
<v Speaker 4>just because when push comes to shove,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they know how to get the men in uniform </v>

2868
01:58:50.150 --> 01:58:54.540
<v Speaker 4>behind it and just take care of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem with military might and make </v>

2869
01:58:54.540 --> 01:58:55.090
<v Speaker 4>America great again and all that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>horseshit.</v>

2870
01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:58.530
<v Speaker 4>If something like that happens with </v>
<v Speaker 4>trump and trump,</v>

2871
01:58:58.580 --> 01:59:03.580
<v Speaker 4>you remember he had that one speech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie can give me another one of these </v>

2872
01:59:03.580 --> 01:59:07.141
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Please let me handle that one speech </v>

2873
01:59:07.141 --> 01:59:08.620
<v Speaker 4>where I'm everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2874
01:59:08.621 --> 01:59:09.910
<v Speaker 4>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was presidential.</v>

2875
01:59:09.940 --> 01:59:14.940
<v Speaker 4>Like he had won presidential speech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He spoke in front of Congress and </v>

2876
01:59:14.940 --> 01:59:16.720
<v Speaker 4>everyone was clapping and he said a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bunch of things like all you need.</v>

2877
01:59:16.750 --> 01:59:21.750
<v Speaker 4>All he needs is one event,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that happens where he steps up</v>

2878
01:59:21.820 --> 01:59:26.820
<v Speaker 4>and manages it with a reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 4>vocabulary and and does things that </v>

2879
01:59:29.351 --> 01:59:34.351
<v Speaker 4>people approve of especially some sort </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a catastrophic situation or any sort </v>

2880
01:59:34.351 --> 01:59:37.810
<v Speaker 4>of a military situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we have to deal with North Korea,</v>

2881
01:59:37.811 --> 01:59:42.490
<v Speaker 4>if we have to deal with something where </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a real legitimate concerns,</v>

2882
01:59:42.491 --> 01:59:46.270
<v Speaker 4>thanks pat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that happens and he manages it,</v>

2883
01:59:46.271 --> 01:59:48.280
<v Speaker 4>people get scared and they don't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>change.</v>

2884
01:59:48.490 --> 01:59:53.490
<v Speaker 4>I think if that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's entirely likely if we have to deal </v>

2885
01:59:53.490 --> 01:59:55.530
<v Speaker 4>with some sort of a catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a tragedy,</v>

2886
01:59:55.660 --> 01:59:59.710
<v Speaker 4>some sort of an attack or an event,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Donald trump manages it well,</v>

2887
01:59:59.740 --> 02:00:01.630
<v Speaker 4>it's entirely likely that he could be </v>
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>

2888
02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:01.800
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2889
02:00:01.960 --> 02:00:03.640
<v Speaker 5>There could be a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There could be a moment like that.</v>

2890
02:00:03.760 --> 02:00:08.760
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't throw.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I went through anything past him </v>

2891
02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:10.771
<v Speaker 5>specifically because I and many other </v>
<v Speaker 5>people were so wrong about his ability </v>

2892
02:00:10.771 --> 02:00:11.290
<v Speaker 5>to win to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought I just didn't.</v>

2893
02:00:11.530 --> 02:00:16.530
<v Speaker 5>I thought he would do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I kept saying he's going to do </v>

2894
02:00:16.530 --> 02:00:16.530
<v Speaker 5>better and get more votes than people </v>
<v Speaker 5>thought,</v>

2895
02:00:16.530 --> 02:00:17.650
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't think he had a prayer of </v>
<v Speaker 5>winning,</v>

2896
02:00:18.070 --> 02:00:19.720
<v Speaker 5>but there are certain things you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>look at where it's like,</v>

2897
02:00:19.721 --> 02:00:19.970
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>

2898
02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:25.000
<v Speaker 5>It's about 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>votes along three states that he even </v>

2899
02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:25.330
<v Speaker 5>wanted all the vote was suppressed </v>
<v Speaker 5>priest and I'm not saying he was at.</v>

2900
02:00:25.331 --> 02:00:30.331
<v Speaker 5>It was actively suppress.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People just weren't enthusiastic about </v>

2901
02:00:30.331 --> 02:00:30.331
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so people weren't out there to vote.</v>

2902
02:00:30.331 --> 02:00:30.550
<v Speaker 5>Now people see the consequences of not </v>
<v Speaker 5>voting.</v>

2903
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:32.590
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that.</v>

2904
02:00:33.130 --> 02:00:34.390
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that it's like the.</v>

2905
02:00:34.720 --> 02:00:39.720
<v Speaker 5>I guess what I'm saying is that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>prognostication that like this is the </v>

2906
02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:39.720
<v Speaker 5>end of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2907
02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:41.590
<v Speaker 5>Like that Donald trump being president,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we've had terrible presence,</v>

2908
02:00:41.830 --> 02:00:43.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we've had really bad presidents.</v>

2909
02:00:43.511 --> 02:00:45.210
<v Speaker 5>He's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2910
02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:49.960
<v Speaker 5>in some sense he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll say that he's the most incompetent.</v>

2911
02:00:49.990 --> 02:00:51.790
<v Speaker 5>We've had some.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've had some presidents that were just</v>

2912
02:00:51.791 --> 02:00:54.400
<v Speaker 5>in shitty situations that they couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>manage long time ago.</v>

2913
02:00:54.401 --> 02:00:59.401
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say hoover's probably the last </v>

2914
02:00:59.401 --> 02:00:59.401
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then Puke James Buchanan.</v>

2915
02:00:59.401 --> 02:00:59.401
<v Speaker 5>Obviously it's an awful precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The in,</v>

2916
02:00:59.401 --> 02:01:00.190
<v Speaker 5>in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 5>57,</v>

2917
02:01:00.430 --> 02:01:02.500
<v Speaker 5>the state starts to secede when he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>president,</v>

2918
02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:04.150
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he couldn't do anything about it.</v>

2919
02:01:04.340 --> 02:01:09.340
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we've had to really die or serious </v>

2920
02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:09.340
<v Speaker 5>situations under presidents that were </v>
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>

2921
02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:11.080
<v Speaker 5>that were in over their heads,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there also is no footage of them.</v>

2922
02:01:11.081 --> 02:01:16.081
<v Speaker 5>There's no film.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to really go back and read </v>

2923
02:01:16.081 --> 02:01:16.081
<v Speaker 5>history to understand the</v>

2924
02:01:16.081 --> 02:01:18.840
<v Speaker 4>sequences of their actions where we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing all this play out in real time.</v>

2925
02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:21.720
<v Speaker 4>We're seeing the poverty of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>vocabulary,</v>

2926
02:01:21.721 --> 02:01:25.770
<v Speaker 4>the way he communicates in the press,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way he pats himself on the back.</v>

2927
02:01:25.771 --> 02:01:27.930
<v Speaker 4>Like the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said he has one of the great memories</v>

2928
02:01:27.931 --> 02:01:31.290
<v Speaker 4>of all time and like he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things that are just preposterous.</v>

2929
02:01:31.340 --> 02:01:33.620
<v Speaker 5>The one about him being an Ivy Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went to an Ivy League school.</v>

2930
02:01:33.621 --> 02:01:35.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm an intelligent mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

2931
02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:37.280
<v Speaker 5>I'm one of the guys that says like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he's dumb at all.</v>

2932
02:01:37.410 --> 02:01:38.660
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he's stupid.</v>

2933
02:01:38.661 --> 02:01:39.050
<v Speaker 5>I just think</v>

2934
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:42.500
<v Speaker 4>in over his head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't ever see him in the nineties.</v>

2935
02:01:42.530 --> 02:01:45.170
<v Speaker 4>Talk about running for president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You ever see that video footage?</v>

2936
02:01:45.171 --> 02:01:46.920
<v Speaker 4>I think it was on Charlie rose or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

2937
02:01:46.980 --> 02:01:48.600
<v Speaker 4>Starting an 88.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He started talking about it either.</v>

2938
02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:49.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the way there.</v>

2939
02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:54.640
<v Speaker 4>And when you go back and listen to that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like first of all did something happen </v>

2940
02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:57.710
<v Speaker 4>to his brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why is he so clunky now?</v>

2941
02:01:58.190 --> 02:02:01.770
<v Speaker 4>Like wire his sentence is so poorly </v>
<v Speaker 4>formed and speech pattern.</v>

2942
02:02:01.771 --> 02:02:06.771
<v Speaker 4>So shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now maybe that's what you gotta wonder </v>

2943
02:02:06.771 --> 02:02:06.771
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like old dudes.</v>

2944
02:02:06.771 --> 02:02:11.380
<v Speaker 4>They get to a certain age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially guys like him who don't </v>

2945
02:02:11.380 --> 02:02:11.380
<v Speaker 4>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't eat well,</v>

2946
02:02:11.380 --> 02:02:15.400
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>KFC bucket and it's got a big fat gut </v>

2947
02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:17.120
<v Speaker 4>and just like how well or is neurons </v>
<v Speaker 4>firing,</v>

2948
02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:18.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2949
02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:22.640
<v Speaker 4>he's see if we can find that video of </v>
<v Speaker 4>him back from you.</v>

2950
02:02:22.641 --> 02:02:23.230
<v Speaker 4>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2951
02:02:23.310 --> 02:02:25.670
<v Speaker 4>watch this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen to this.</v>

2952
02:02:25.790 --> 02:02:29.360
<v Speaker 8>I think that if you had to do it again,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm not sure you could.</v>

2953
02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:33.170
<v Speaker 8>I went through a period of two years </v>
<v Speaker 8>that was truly tough.</v>

2954
02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:36.920
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2955
02:02:36.980 --> 02:02:41.980
<v Speaker 8>you have parents and you have people </v>
<v Speaker 8>that adore you and you have people that </v>

2956
02:02:41.980 --> 02:02:45.420
<v Speaker 8>for 15 years nothing went wrong and then</v>
<v Speaker 8>all of a sudden the world seems to be </v>

2957
02:02:45.420 --> 02:02:47.420
<v Speaker 8>coming to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean it just seems to become.</v>

2958
02:02:48.110 --> 02:02:53.110
<v Speaker 8>And it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it was just sort of an incredible </v>

2959
02:02:53.110 --> 02:02:53.110
<v Speaker 8>experience for me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is him.</v>

2960
02:02:53.110 --> 02:02:53.840
<v Speaker 8>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 8>humbled.</v>

2961
02:02:54.140 --> 02:02:59.140
<v Speaker 8>Talking about going bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'd like to hear him talking about </v>

2962
02:02:59.140 --> 02:03:03.490
<v Speaker 8>running for president.</v>
<v Speaker 8>My father wouldn't have been in mission </v>

2963
02:03:03.490 --> 02:03:03.740
<v Speaker 8>to bail me out,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but he certainly helped and you know,</v>

2964
02:03:03.741 --> 02:03:07.490
<v Speaker 8>morally and as the whole interview with </v>
<v Speaker 8>my mother was great.</v>

2965
02:03:07.491 --> 02:03:12.491
<v Speaker 8>I have a sister,</v>
<v Speaker 8>she's very just listen to listen to a </v>

2966
02:03:12.881 --> 02:03:17.881
<v Speaker 8>speech pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 8>never knew as to loyalty whether or not </v>

2967
02:03:17.881 --> 02:03:18.020
<v Speaker 8>should be there or wouldn't be there and</v>
<v Speaker 8>she was there in spades,</v>

2968
02:03:18.530 --> 02:03:19.420
<v Speaker 8>other people with them.</v>

2969
02:03:19.420 --> 02:03:20.010
<v Speaker 8>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

2970
02:03:20.011 --> 02:03:22.430
<v Speaker 8>the incredible thing is you can't really</v>
<v Speaker 8>tell.</v>

2971
02:03:22.610 --> 02:03:24.350
<v Speaker 8>You can't really tell who's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 8>there,</v>

2972
02:03:24.351 --> 02:03:25.840
<v Speaker 8>who's not.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

2973
02:03:25.970 --> 02:03:28.910
<v Speaker 8>I would have bet my life on certain </v>
<v Speaker 8>people.</v>

2974
02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:33.080
<v Speaker 8>I would have said a politically speaking</v>
<v Speaker 8>that somebody that,</v>

2975
02:03:33.081 --> 02:03:38.081
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Andrew Stein would have been there and </v>

2976
02:03:38.081 --> 02:03:38.081
<v Speaker 8>it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would have said that other people,</v>

2977
02:03:38.081 --> 02:03:41.750
<v Speaker 8>what he wasn't there in terms of for 15 </v>
<v Speaker 8>years I supported Andrew Stein,</v>

2978
02:03:41.870 --> 02:03:46.870
<v Speaker 8>supported them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I never asked him for a thing when I </v>

2979
02:03:46.870 --> 02:03:49.871
<v Speaker 8>needed a vote.</v>
<v Speaker 8>One Riverside South until the very end </v>

2980
02:03:49.871 --> 02:03:51.620
<v Speaker 8>when everybody else was on board.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Andrew was not there and I was,</v>

2981
02:03:51.690 --> 02:03:55.040
<v Speaker 8>I was really surprised at that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now ultimately he was there,</v>

2982
02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:58.610
<v Speaker 8>but it shouldn't have been so difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It really shouldn't have been.</v>

2983
02:03:58.780 --> 02:04:03.780
<v Speaker 8>Here comes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>one of the things they say about you is </v>

2984
02:04:03.780 --> 02:04:06.341
<v Speaker 8>that their ticks within you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a vindictiveness about that and you're </v>

2985
02:04:06.341 --> 02:04:09.590
<v Speaker 8>not gonna forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And part of the trump style,</v>

2986
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:12.920
<v Speaker 8>at some point you're going to try to get</v>
<v Speaker 8>Stein back.</v>

2987
02:04:13.070 --> 02:04:18.070
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think I'm going to try and get </v>

2988
02:04:18.070 --> 02:04:18.070
<v Speaker 8>stuff back.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm just disappointed.</v>

2989
02:04:18.070 --> 02:04:20.350
<v Speaker 8>I'm disappointed in other people and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 8>not disappointed in some the.</v>

2990
02:04:20.540 --> 02:04:25.540
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then people point is he seems like a </v>

2991
02:04:25.540 --> 02:04:26.550
<v Speaker 4>much more reasonable person cogent like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2992
02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:30.110
<v Speaker 4>maybe he's going to maybe see a little.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See now I have no idea.</v>

2993
02:04:30.530 --> 02:04:31.550
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

2994
02:04:31.580 --> 02:04:34.460
<v Speaker 4>and this is something I've been really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm battling,</v>

2995
02:04:34.490 --> 02:04:37.560
<v Speaker 4>not battling but bouncing around in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>head a lot lately,</v>

2996
02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:42.810
<v Speaker 4>is that I think this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this hate of him,</v>

2997
02:04:42.930 --> 02:04:44.550
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the constant insults,</v>

2998
02:04:44.551 --> 02:04:46.800
<v Speaker 4>the attacks on him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the constant.</v>

2999
02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:49.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean he blogs people on twitter all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time because people.</v>

3000
02:04:49.141 --> 02:04:52.110
<v Speaker 4>And now people are suing him to say that</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can't block them on twitter anymore.</v>

3001
02:04:52.210 --> 02:04:53.670
<v Speaker 4>We're being very petulant about that </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

3002
02:04:53.730 --> 02:04:57.540
<v Speaker 4>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of this like the center live satires</v>

3003
02:04:57.570 --> 02:04:58.200
<v Speaker 4>of um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the,</v>

3004
02:04:58.201 --> 02:05:03.201
<v Speaker 4>all the shit that they do is ramping up </v>
<v Speaker 4>his mania.</v>

3005
02:05:04.230 --> 02:05:06.960
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's actually bad for all of us,</v>

3006
02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:09.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that you don't get someone to change</v>

3007
02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:10.560
<v Speaker 4>by going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3008
02:05:10.561 --> 02:05:12.240
<v Speaker 4>fucking change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3009
02:05:12.241 --> 02:05:14.670
<v Speaker 4>you're a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that doesn't make people change.</v>

3010
02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:19.880
<v Speaker 4>It makes people aware that you hate them</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it depending entirely upon their </v>

3011
02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:23.061
<v Speaker 4>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether or not they're reflective or </v>

3012
02:05:23.061 --> 02:05:23.061
<v Speaker 4>introspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how they,</v>

3013
02:05:23.061 --> 02:05:25.530
<v Speaker 4>how they react to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He seems to react to it by,</v>

3014
02:05:26.010 --> 02:05:31.010
<v Speaker 4>by like doubling down and by getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>more aggressively defensive and more </v>

3015
02:05:32.401 --> 02:05:36.280
<v Speaker 4>self aggrandizing and more self </v>
<v Speaker 4>congratulatory,</v>

3016
02:05:36.450 --> 02:05:38.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he seems to get more trump.</v>

3017
02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:39.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3018
02:05:39.751 --> 02:05:41.550
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like he's the hulk like you </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever received.</v>

3019
02:05:41.551 --> 02:05:43.080
<v Speaker 4>When they shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hockey gets bigger.</v>

3020
02:05:43.130 --> 02:05:43.550
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3021
02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:44.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3022
02:05:44.810 --> 02:05:46.820
<v Speaker 5>He definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't deal with.</v>

3023
02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:51.560
<v Speaker 5>He's in a situation where someone needs </v>
<v Speaker 5>to lower their rifles.</v>

3024
02:05:51.561 --> 02:05:52.330
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And point.</v>

3025
02:05:52.540 --> 02:05:57.540
<v Speaker 5>And after he was elected,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought for sure that smart people are</v>

3026
02:05:58.251 --> 02:06:03.251
<v Speaker 5>in his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in his transition team and he's not </v>

3027
02:06:03.251 --> 02:06:03.770
<v Speaker 5>surrounded by dumb people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He surrounded by inexperienced political</v>

3028
02:06:03.771 --> 02:06:08.771
<v Speaker 5>operatives,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's not surrounded by dumb people </v>

3029
02:06:08.771 --> 02:06:10.271
<v Speaker 5>that someone at some point what it said </v>
<v Speaker 5>like we can now get down to the act of </v>

3030
02:06:10.271 --> 02:06:12.290
<v Speaker 5>governing and I'm of the mind that if he</v>
<v Speaker 5>just started acting more normal,</v>

3031
02:06:12.590 --> 02:06:17.590
<v Speaker 5>if you stopped tweeting so much,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if he just spoke at a more normal in a </v>

3032
02:06:17.590 --> 02:06:17.590
<v Speaker 5>more normal way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did normal things.</v>

3033
02:06:17.590 --> 02:06:20.510
<v Speaker 5>People would have forgotten a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>what happened during the campaign and he</v>

3034
02:06:20.511 --> 02:06:25.511
<v Speaker 5>would have been in much better shape to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get legislative goals through and stuff </v>

3035
02:06:25.511 --> 02:06:25.511
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he,</v>

3036
02:06:25.511 --> 02:06:26.740
<v Speaker 5>he can't help himself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he,</v>

3037
02:06:26.741 --> 02:06:31.741
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's why I think like this </v>

3038
02:06:31.741 --> 02:06:31.741
<v Speaker 5>destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

3039
02:06:31.741 --> 02:06:32.300
<v Speaker 5>I just don't know that the American </v>
<v Speaker 5>people are going to want this again.</v>

3040
02:06:32.390 --> 02:06:36.290
<v Speaker 5>Like I think that I think that he has a </v>
<v Speaker 5>base of 30,</v>

3041
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:39.200
<v Speaker 5>35 percent that will be there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but isn't that what Obama had?</v>

3042
02:06:39.201 --> 02:06:42.190
<v Speaker 5>It is lowest for approval ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3043
02:06:42.191 --> 02:06:44.120
<v Speaker 5>And the second term I think he was down </v>
<v Speaker 5>down to that</v>

3044
02:06:44.940 --> 02:06:47.520
<v Speaker 4>I can think is lowest approval ratings </v>
<v Speaker 4>were,</v>

3045
02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:51.330
<v Speaker 4>were higher than trump's lowest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's in the neighborhood.</v>

3046
02:06:51.640 --> 02:06:52.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3047
02:06:52.070 --> 02:06:53.920
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not even saying [inaudible] approval</v>

3048
02:06:53.921 --> 02:06:58.921
<v Speaker 5>ratings are fickle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can do all sorts of shifts to </v>

3049
02:06:58.921 --> 02:06:58.921
<v Speaker 5>manipulate those numbers and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and trump would,</v>

3050
02:06:58.921 --> 02:07:03.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>interestingly and rightfully maybe say </v>

3051
02:07:03.870 --> 02:07:03.870
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at the economy,</v>

3052
02:07:03.870 --> 02:07:03.870
<v Speaker 5>it's doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at the stock market.</v>

3053
02:07:03.870 --> 02:07:05.020
<v Speaker 5>It's doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we're economy was on the sort of</v>

3054
02:07:05.021 --> 02:07:05.920
<v Speaker 5>deceptive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3055
02:07:05.921 --> 02:07:07.870
<v Speaker 5>Because the economy was on an upward </v>
<v Speaker 5>trend,</v>

3056
02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:08.580
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>

3057
02:07:08.610 --> 02:07:09.540
<v Speaker 5>it's caught</v>

3058
02:07:09.580 --> 02:07:14.580
<v Speaker 4>that wave right there is a real belief </v>
<v Speaker 4>by business people that Donald trump is </v>

3059
02:07:14.580 --> 02:07:16.980
<v Speaker 4>going to make things easier for them </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of his nature.</v>

3060
02:07:17.850 --> 02:07:19.360
<v Speaker 4>The Fuck Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened?</v>

3061
02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:23.910
<v Speaker 4>Motherfuckers with their ads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3062
02:07:24.040 --> 02:07:29.040
<v Speaker 4>that we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have this sense that the business </v>

3063
02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:30.810
<v Speaker 4>people think that he's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>alleviate restrictions.</v>

3064
02:07:30.990 --> 02:07:35.990
<v Speaker 4>He's going to make things easier because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had to open up doors and he's going </v>

3065
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:39.741
<v Speaker 4>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people would think are very </v>

3066
02:07:39.741 --> 02:07:41.761
<v Speaker 4>unpopular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like one of the things he's done is he </v>

3067
02:07:41.761 --> 02:07:43.870
<v Speaker 4>made it so you can bring back lion </v>
<v Speaker 4>trophies now again from Africa.</v>

3068
02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:46.360
<v Speaker 4>So if people want to go to Africa and </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoot lions,</v>

3069
02:07:46.361 --> 02:07:48.910
<v Speaker 4>you could bring them over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is bizarre.</v>

3070
02:07:48.940 --> 02:07:50.980
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make any what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is a digital?</v>

3071
02:07:51.250 --> 02:07:53.050
<v Speaker 4>No other president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does this.</v>

3072
02:07:53.080 --> 02:07:57.610
<v Speaker 4>Trump's approval rating is bad day one </v>
<v Speaker 4>97 of his presidency,</v>

3073
02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:59.950
<v Speaker 4>5:30</v>
<v Speaker 4>pegged.</v>

3074
02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:04.960
<v Speaker 4>That is 37 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No other president in history of modern </v>

3075
02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:06.400
<v Speaker 4>polling had an approval rate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So dismal on day one.</v>

3076
02:08:06.580 --> 02:08:09.940
<v Speaker 4>One 97.</v>
<v Speaker 4>According to 5:38</v>

3077
02:08:09.970 --> 02:08:14.970
<v Speaker 4>tracker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a former president Gerald Ford came </v>

3078
02:08:14.970 --> 02:08:16.981
<v Speaker 4>close to matching trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but could a have boasted and approval </v>

3079
02:08:16.981 --> 02:08:18.790
<v Speaker 4>rate of nearly two point five percent </v>
<v Speaker 4>points higher.</v>

3080
02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:23.920
<v Speaker 5>It wouldn't be super surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Have Obama Fall into that high </v>

3081
02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:26.081
<v Speaker 5>thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 5>low forties and his second term because </v>

3082
02:08:26.081 --> 02:08:26.081
<v Speaker 5>that's when they don't care anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3083
02:08:26.081 --> 02:08:29.410
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's when they really start to </v>

3084
02:08:29.410 --> 02:08:29.410
<v Speaker 5>take initiative and do certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I was approved.</v>

3085
02:08:29.410 --> 02:08:31.880
<v Speaker 5>I didn't see it below like 47 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obama.</v>

3086
02:08:31.980 --> 02:08:33.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He must have been a with.</v>

3087
02:08:33.890 --> 02:08:34.850
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is this,</v>

3088
02:08:35.050 --> 02:08:38.130
<v Speaker 5>this approval is a little different than</v>
<v Speaker 5>a approval or disapproval.</v>

3089
02:08:38.150 --> 02:08:38.820
<v Speaker 5>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3090
02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:40.460
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a disapproval rating.</v>

3091
02:08:41.060 --> 02:08:42.620
<v Speaker 5>Disapprove,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or do you approve it?</v>

3092
02:08:42.890 --> 02:08:44.120
<v Speaker 5>You can be neutral on that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3093
02:08:44.420 --> 02:08:46.670
<v Speaker 5>So if like there's a disapproval rating </v>
<v Speaker 5>of 50 percent,</v>

3094
02:08:46.671 --> 02:08:48.290
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't mean is that approval rating </v>
<v Speaker 5>of fifth year?</v>

3095
02:08:48.330 --> 02:08:49.090
<v Speaker 5>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3096
02:08:49.100 --> 02:08:50.330
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

3097
02:08:50.331 --> 02:08:52.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's funny because I think with,</v>

3098
02:08:53.030 --> 02:08:58.030
<v Speaker 5>with there are certain things that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think people don't understand that are </v>

3099
02:08:58.581 --> 02:09:00.560
<v Speaker 5>unpopular,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that do need to be done specifically for</v>

3100
02:09:00.561 --> 02:09:01.130
<v Speaker 5>businesses.</v>

3101
02:09:01.460 --> 02:09:03.020
<v Speaker 5>I own a business,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've owned two of them.</v>

3102
02:09:03.021 --> 02:09:08.021
<v Speaker 5>You have run your own business,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems like with all of your </v>

3103
02:09:08.021 --> 02:09:08.420
<v Speaker 5>adventures as well and it's very hard </v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3104
02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:13.470
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of people look at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just from an administrative </v>

3105
02:09:13.470 --> 02:09:13.470
<v Speaker 5>paperwork standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 5>taxes,</v>

3106
02:09:13.470 --> 02:09:14.230
<v Speaker 5>all those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

3107
02:09:14.270 --> 02:09:19.270
<v Speaker 5>it's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think a lot of people pointed </v>

3108
02:09:19.270 --> 02:09:21.130
<v Speaker 5>business big and small and they look at </v>
<v Speaker 5>them as like these ways you can kind of </v>

3109
02:09:21.130 --> 02:09:22.010
<v Speaker 5>like get blood out of a stone and take </v>
<v Speaker 5>it and extract as much money out of them</v>

3110
02:09:22.011 --> 02:09:23.300
<v Speaker 5>as possible and all these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

3111
02:09:23.301 --> 02:09:25.460
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people are not sympathetic to </v>
<v Speaker 5>it because no offense,</v>

3112
02:09:25.461 --> 02:09:26.690
<v Speaker 5>they have no idea what they're talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>

3113
02:09:26.930 --> 02:09:29.300
<v Speaker 5>And I've been watching the west wing </v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

3114
02:09:29.301 --> 02:09:30.260
<v Speaker 5>which I love.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love that show.</v>

3115
02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:31.250
<v Speaker 5>I never watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3116
02:09:31.251 --> 02:09:32.270
<v Speaker 5>it's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You probably love it.</v>

3117
02:09:32.300 --> 02:09:33.260
<v Speaker 5>You should,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should check it out.</v>

3118
02:09:33.261 --> 02:09:38.261
<v Speaker 5>So it's just a great show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things they say in there </v>

3119
02:09:38.261 --> 02:09:38.930
<v Speaker 5>is that the major difference we are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people call us a democracy,</v>

3120
02:09:38.931 --> 02:09:43.931
<v Speaker 5>but we're not a democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're a public and the idea is that you </v>

3121
02:09:43.931 --> 02:09:46.751
<v Speaker 5>send,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you vote for people that go make </v>

3122
02:09:46.751 --> 02:09:48.431
<v Speaker 5>decisions on your behalf and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 5>those decisions are going to be </v>

3123
02:09:48.431 --> 02:09:51.221
<v Speaker 5>unpopular,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but some people do know better than </v>

3124
02:09:51.221 --> 02:09:51.221
<v Speaker 5>others.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so there are certain things,</v>

3125
02:09:51.221 --> 02:09:54.500
<v Speaker 5>I don't necessarily judge a move based </v>
<v Speaker 5>only on popularity because what does,</v>

3126
02:09:54.530 --> 02:09:56.870
<v Speaker 5>what does society at large know about </v>
<v Speaker 5>running a business?</v>

3127
02:09:56.960 --> 02:10:01.960
<v Speaker 5>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you have to ask people that </v>

3128
02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:01.960
<v Speaker 5>understand what it is to run a business </v>
<v Speaker 5>and how you can make that easier.</v>

3129
02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:05.300
<v Speaker 5>So we can't judge things based on that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Only my major concern with him though is</v>

3130
02:10:05.301 --> 02:10:10.301
<v Speaker 5>that he's so unpopular even in his own </v>
<v Speaker 5>party and even specifically with the </v>

3131
02:10:10.301 --> 02:10:13.880
<v Speaker 5>House that because they are constantly </v>
<v Speaker 5>up for reelection that you know,</v>

3132
02:10:14.030 --> 02:10:19.030
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they haven't had one legislative like </v>

3133
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:19.030
<v Speaker 5>when uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

3134
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:22.841
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the entire time he's been president </v>

3135
02:10:22.841 --> 02:10:22.841
<v Speaker 5>does not have all the positions fully </v>
<v Speaker 5>staffed as well.</v>

3136
02:10:22.841 --> 02:10:23.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There,</v>

3137
02:10:23.010 --> 02:10:28.010
<v Speaker 5>there are things and that's not uncommon</v>
<v Speaker 5>either that sometimes things go for </v>

3138
02:10:28.010 --> 02:10:30.200
<v Speaker 5>years without being staffed or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think part of the problem is so crazy.</v>

3139
02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:35.220
<v Speaker 5>Like how the fuck do you take office </v>
<v Speaker 5>without all the pieces in place because </v>

3140
02:10:35.220 --> 02:10:38.270
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I who knows the conspiracy theories run </v>

3141
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:40.991
<v Speaker 5>deep on this one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think he thought he was </v>

3142
02:10:40.991 --> 02:10:40.991
<v Speaker 5>going to win and I'm not even sure he </v>
<v Speaker 5>wanted to win.</v>

3143
02:10:40.991 --> 02:10:40.991
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3144
02:10:40.991 --> 02:10:44.550
<v Speaker 5>and I don't think that they had a real </v>
<v Speaker 5>transition like a.</v>

3145
02:10:44.710 --> 02:10:46.310
<v Speaker 5>I Read Hillary Clinton's book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what happened,</v>

3146
02:10:46.340 --> 02:10:48.080
<v Speaker 5>which is an interesting book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You read the whole thing?</v>

3147
02:10:48.081 --> 02:10:49.040
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You okay?</v>

3148
02:10:49.070 --> 02:10:49.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm okay.</v>

3149
02:10:49.581 --> 02:10:50.320
<v Speaker 5>I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is this?</v>

3150
02:10:50.330 --> 02:10:55.330
<v Speaker 5>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I'd be interested in high part </v>

3151
02:10:55.330 --> 02:10:55.330
<v Speaker 5>of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3152
02:10:55.330 --> 02:10:57.010
<v Speaker 5>Out laying in the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the bathtub reading.</v>

3153
02:10:57.390 --> 02:10:58.620
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

3154
02:10:58.621 --> 02:11:01.370
<v Speaker 5>as I said the you'd have to be high to </v>
<v Speaker 5>read but I wanted to perspective,</v>

3155
02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:01.680
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3156
02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:06.680
<v Speaker 5>Like I think it's interesting and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and well there's a lot of things in </v>

3157
02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:07.340
<v Speaker 5>there but one of the things she was </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about was that she had,</v>

3158
02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:09.560
<v Speaker 5>they were fully prepared for their </v>
<v Speaker 5>transition.</v>

3159
02:11:09.561 --> 02:11:10.220
<v Speaker 5>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing,</v>

3160
02:11:10.250 --> 02:11:15.250
<v Speaker 5>which is not surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was actually talking about in </v>

3161
02:11:15.250 --> 02:11:17.800
<v Speaker 5>October she started taking regular </v>
<v Speaker 5>meetings because they assumed that she </v>

3162
02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:18.340
<v Speaker 5>was gonna win about how she was going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>stack things and the decisions they were</v>

3163
02:11:18.341 --> 02:11:23.341
<v Speaker 5>going to make in the first 100 days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think you just have something </v>

3164
02:11:23.341 --> 02:11:23.341
<v Speaker 5>that's like over the top bravado.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3165
02:11:23.341 --> 02:11:28.180
<v Speaker 5>And on the other end,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ironically for someone with so much </v>

3166
02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:31.031
<v Speaker 5>bravado,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have someone that just was totally </v>

3167
02:11:31.031 --> 02:11:32.831
<v Speaker 5>not prepared to win because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>think anyone inside except for maybe </v>

3168
02:11:32.831 --> 02:11:33.860
<v Speaker 5>Kellyanne Conway was telling think </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the case.</v>

3169
02:11:33.861 --> 02:11:38.861
<v Speaker 5>Or do you think it was just </v>
<v Speaker 5>concentrating entirely on winning and </v>

3170
02:11:38.861 --> 02:11:38.861
<v Speaker 5>then figure it out once it gets in </v>
<v Speaker 5>there?</v>

3171
02:11:38.861 --> 02:11:38.861
<v Speaker 5>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're,</v>

3172
02:11:38.861 --> 02:11:39.360
<v Speaker 5>you should.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3173
02:11:39.390 --> 02:11:42.110
<v Speaker 5>it could be anything we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the definitive book on this has not been</v>

3174
02:11:42.111 --> 02:11:47.111
<v Speaker 5>written yet unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And actually mark Halperin who was </v>

3175
02:11:47.111 --> 02:11:47.111
<v Speaker 5>writing that book and now he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's finished with that.</v>

3176
02:11:47.111 --> 02:11:51.430
<v Speaker 5>You realized that he has such a limited </v>
<v Speaker 5>understanding of what even his powers </v>

3177
02:11:51.430 --> 02:11:54.110
<v Speaker 5>are and what you like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was the guy he spoke to?</v>

3178
02:11:54.410 --> 02:11:57.590
<v Speaker 5>We said I had a conversation with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>president of the US Virgin Islands.</v>

3179
02:11:57.591 --> 02:11:57.890
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

3180
02:11:58.050 --> 02:12:00.180
<v Speaker 5>you're the president of the US Virgin </v>
<v Speaker 5>Islands.</v>

3181
02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:00.740
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he makes,</v>

3182
02:12:00.770 --> 02:12:02.690
<v Speaker 5>he makes them stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He makes some stupid mistakes.</v>

3183
02:12:02.691 --> 02:12:03.680
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't.</v>

3184
02:12:03.710 --> 02:12:06.510
<v Speaker 5>I mean I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3185
02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:08.960
<v Speaker 5>that was there some moments like that </v>
<v Speaker 5>where I'm like,</v>

3186
02:12:09.180 --> 02:12:10.130
<v Speaker 5>you're funny,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're funny,</v>

3187
02:12:10.230 --> 02:12:15.230
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but unfortunately the situation doesn't </v>

3188
02:12:15.230 --> 02:12:15.230
<v Speaker 5>call for being funny,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not,</v>

3189
02:12:15.230 --> 02:12:17.810
<v Speaker 5>it's not humorous humorous situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I feel like specifically with,</v>

3190
02:12:18.050 --> 02:12:20.150
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in terms of governance,</v>

3191
02:12:20.151 --> 02:12:25.151
<v Speaker 5>I think he just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember the debates where he didn't </v>

3192
02:12:25.151 --> 02:12:25.990
<v Speaker 5>know what the nuclear triad was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is like the fuck.</v>

3193
02:12:26.010 --> 02:12:30.110
<v Speaker 5>You not know what the nuclear triad is </v>
<v Speaker 5>and where he speaking around issues that</v>

3194
02:12:30.111 --> 02:12:31.910
<v Speaker 5>are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are somewhat basic,</v>

3195
02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:37.000
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That someone that's running for </v>

3196
02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:37.000
<v Speaker 5>president,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3197
02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:37.280
<v Speaker 5>and when you multiply that by not being </v>
<v Speaker 5>a candidate,</v>

3198
02:12:37.460 --> 02:12:40.280
<v Speaker 5>but by being the man in the office and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then being inundated by the realities of</v>

3199
02:12:40.281 --> 02:12:42.530
<v Speaker 5>the office,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was just ill prepared for it and he,</v>

3200
02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:48.040
<v Speaker 5>part of the reason he wanted because he </v>
<v Speaker 5>was an outsider and part of being an </v>

3201
02:12:48.040 --> 02:12:48.050
<v Speaker 5>outsider is alienating everyone around </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

3202
02:12:48.350 --> 02:12:50.540
<v Speaker 5>That is an insider.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he has no one,</v>

3203
02:12:50.620 --> 02:12:53.210
<v Speaker 5>very few people that are willing to work</v>
<v Speaker 5>for him that are capable.</v>

3204
02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:54.860
<v Speaker 5>Which is why I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3205
02:12:55.250 --> 02:12:57.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's this idea,</v>

3206
02:12:57.771 --> 02:12:59.600
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you've read about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's this idea that there's basically</v>

3207
02:12:59.601 --> 02:13:01.970
<v Speaker 5>a soft coup going on in the American </v>
<v Speaker 5>government right now.</v>

3208
02:13:01.971 --> 02:13:03.470
<v Speaker 5>Have you talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have you heard about this at all?</v>

3209
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:08.830
<v Speaker 5>That general Maddis who's secretary of </v>
<v Speaker 5>defense and then General Kelly who is </v>

3210
02:13:08.830 --> 02:13:12.521
<v Speaker 5>the chief of staff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are basically running things and that </v>

3211
02:13:12.521 --> 02:13:15.820
<v Speaker 5>we.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's kind of a scary idea because </v>

3212
02:13:15.820 --> 02:13:15.820
<v Speaker 5>military coups,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or even if they're soft,</v>

3213
02:13:15.820 --> 02:13:20.341
<v Speaker 5>they're not constitutional,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that people take kind of solace in </v>

3214
02:13:20.571 --> 02:13:21.320
<v Speaker 5>this because they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3215
02:13:21.321 --> 02:13:25.940
<v Speaker 5>people that are men of honor are kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>making sure nothing crazy happens.</v>

3216
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:27.210
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3217
02:13:27.290 --> 02:13:28.760
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is such a waste of time.</v>

3218
02:13:28.761 --> 02:13:30.320
<v Speaker 5>We want something soft.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>

3219
02:13:30.321 --> 02:13:32.100
<v Speaker 5>Or is that just he</v>

3220
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:37.100
<v Speaker 3>has given over the reins to the military</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the first time ever because most of </v>

3221
02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:40.551
<v Speaker 3>the time the president is in charge and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the military has to come to the </v>

3222
02:13:40.551 --> 02:13:44.730
<v Speaker 3>president for direction and for guidance</v>
<v Speaker 3>and for approval.</v>

3223
02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:46.860
<v Speaker 3>Whereas Donald Trump has kind of said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3224
02:13:47.130 --> 02:13:48.870
<v Speaker 3>you people know what to do better than </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody.</v>

3225
02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:50.880
<v Speaker 3>Do what you gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be that.</v>

3226
02:13:50.881 --> 02:13:51.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3227
02:13:51.181 --> 02:13:56.181
<v Speaker 3>it could be voluntary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still its own sort of cool </v>

3228
02:13:56.181 --> 02:13:56.250
<v Speaker 3>because that's not what you're supposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>

3229
02:13:56.340 --> 02:13:58.250
<v Speaker 3>It's not what you're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I trust the military,</v>

3230
02:13:58.290 --> 02:14:00.000
<v Speaker 3>the American.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm better than him.</v>

3231
02:14:00.030 --> 02:14:05.030
<v Speaker 3>That's absolutely loves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say was that typically a </v>

3232
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:06.140
<v Speaker 3>military coup in history is a super </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative connotation than rejections.</v>

3233
02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:07.050
<v Speaker 3>Libyans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the case might be,</v>

3234
02:14:07.051 --> 02:14:09.680
<v Speaker 3>it always turns out bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we have a honor,</v>

3235
02:14:09.870 --> 02:14:14.870
<v Speaker 3>like an honor driven military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in the United States above all </v>

3236
02:14:14.870 --> 02:14:17.340
<v Speaker 3>others that will take care of things and</v>
<v Speaker 3>handed over if necessary,</v>

3237
02:14:17.341 --> 02:14:22.341
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the interesting thing that people </v>

3238
02:14:22.341 --> 02:14:22.341
<v Speaker 3>have been writing and talking about is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like what happens if he does?</v>

3239
02:14:22.341 --> 02:14:23.880
<v Speaker 3>If you want something crazy done and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they just don't do it.</v>

3240
02:14:24.030 --> 02:14:25.740
<v Speaker 3>We've never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've never had a situation like that.</v>

3241
02:14:25.741 --> 02:14:27.500
<v Speaker 3>Like what if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if you know what,</v>

3242
02:14:27.580 --> 02:14:28.400
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on in,</v>

3243
02:14:28.430 --> 02:14:29.670
<v Speaker 3>on the Korean Peninsula,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

3244
02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:31.950
<v Speaker 3>very dangerous situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very dangerous situation.</v>

3245
02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:34.110
<v Speaker 3>What if he goes to escalate and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3246
02:14:34.111 --> 02:14:35.300
<v Speaker 3>we're not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3247
02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:38.370
<v Speaker 3>That's actually the first time that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>know in recorded history where,</v>

3248
02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:41.880
<v Speaker 3>where the military is not responding to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3249
02:14:41.940 --> 02:14:44.310
<v Speaker 3>to the civilian government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>

3250
02:14:44.700 --> 02:14:47.250
<v Speaker 3>it opens all these hypothetical </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting things to think about.</v>

3251
02:14:47.430 --> 02:14:50.280
<v Speaker 3>Things that we haven't come to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>haven't come to pass yet.</v>

3252
02:14:50.490 --> 02:14:51.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3253
02:14:51.180 --> 02:14:53.970
<v Speaker 3>he hasn't requested anything completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>bizarre yet,</v>

3254
02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:57.150
<v Speaker 3>but he said some completely bizarre shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

3255
02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:01.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he needs essentially violated the United</v>

3256
02:15:01.020 --> 02:15:04.800
<v Speaker 3>Nations code or how you communicate with</v>
<v Speaker 3>other governments.</v>

3257
02:15:04.801 --> 02:15:07.020
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he said he threatened them.</v>

3258
02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:07.980
<v Speaker 3>What was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3259
02:15:08.020 --> 02:15:09.660
<v Speaker 3>The terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible things.</v>

3260
02:15:09.661 --> 02:15:11.490
<v Speaker 3>Fire and fury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fire and fury,</v>

3261
02:15:11.491 --> 02:15:12.140
<v Speaker 3>which is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3262
02:15:12.141 --> 02:15:13.290
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's A.</v>

3263
02:15:13.620 --> 02:15:15.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people didn't glean out of that</v>

3264
02:15:15.780 --> 02:15:18.780
<v Speaker 3>was that he was clearly watching truman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Harry Truman videos.</v>

3265
02:15:18.990 --> 02:15:23.990
<v Speaker 3>Harry Truman said this pretty much the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing before he dropped a nuclear </v>

3266
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:26.100
<v Speaker 3>bomb on Japan and there's videos of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>where he was like a rain of fury,</v>

3267
02:15:26.101 --> 02:15:28.380
<v Speaker 3>the likes of which the world has never </v>
<v Speaker 3>seen or something like that.</v>

3268
02:15:28.381 --> 02:15:29.100
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

3269
02:15:29.101 --> 02:15:29.360
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3270
02:15:29.361 --> 02:15:34.361
<v Speaker 3>You've been someone who's been tripping </v>
<v Speaker 3>truman quotes in the area because this </v>

3271
02:15:34.361 --> 02:15:35.550
<v Speaker 3>sounds awfully familiar to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't watching TV,</v>

3272
02:15:35.610 --> 02:15:37.920
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me it's like we,</v>

3273
02:15:38.130 --> 02:15:43.130
<v Speaker 3>it's especially precarious because yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nuclear armed North Korea is not </v>

3274
02:15:43.130 --> 02:15:43.230
<v Speaker 3>ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no.</v>

3275
02:15:43.231 --> 02:15:45.150
<v Speaker 3>If you read any foreign policy papers or</v>
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>

3276
02:15:45.210 --> 02:15:46.350
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything other think tanks,</v>

3277
02:15:46.351 --> 02:15:51.351
<v Speaker 3>there's no good solution out of this and</v>
<v Speaker 3>for him to be so flippant about it when </v>

3278
02:15:51.351 --> 02:15:54.030
<v Speaker 3>you're actually assured destruction is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the one policy that's kept everyone safe</v>

3279
02:15:54.210 --> 02:15:55.320
<v Speaker 3>for a very long time.</v>

3280
02:15:55.590 --> 02:16:00.590
<v Speaker 3>The idea that we will destroy you if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>do anything else and for strike </v>

3281
02:16:00.590 --> 02:16:04.020
<v Speaker 3>capabilities and all that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that he's playing with that </v>

3282
02:16:04.020 --> 02:16:05.940
<v Speaker 3>balance has major geopolitical </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences in Asia,</v>

3283
02:16:06.030 --> 02:16:10.300
<v Speaker 3>which in turn can bring the Russians and</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously the Chinese situation,</v>

3284
02:16:11.100 --> 02:16:14.310
<v Speaker 3>comic book sensibility to it that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3285
02:16:14.311 --> 02:16:18.270
<v Speaker 3>you go and drop some nukes on North </v>
<v Speaker 3>Korea and everything saw problem solved.</v>

3286
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:23.790
<v Speaker 3>That's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just started a gigantic chain of </v>

3287
02:16:23.790 --> 02:16:27.081
<v Speaker 3>events that could lead to a bomb of </v>
<v Speaker 3>blowing off in a major American city or </v>

3288
02:16:27.081 --> 02:16:27.090
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3289
02:16:27.091 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean at the very least you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you.</v>

3290
02:16:30.011 --> 02:16:32.260
<v Speaker 3>Even if you disabled North Korea's </v>
<v Speaker 3>nuclear capabilities,</v>

3291
02:16:32.261 --> 02:16:34.030
<v Speaker 3>we don't really understand how their </v>
<v Speaker 3>icbm is work.</v>

3292
02:16:34.450 --> 02:16:39.450
<v Speaker 3>I was reading something today where they</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually had a major collapse of their </v>

3293
02:16:39.450 --> 02:16:39.450
<v Speaker 3>nuclear site of 200 people dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like tunnels,</v>

3294
02:16:39.450 --> 02:16:40.090
<v Speaker 3>collapse and stuff like that.</v>

3295
02:16:40.090 --> 02:16:45.090
<v Speaker 3>Like they're actually blowing up so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>bombs that they're actually weakening </v>

3296
02:16:45.090 --> 02:16:45.090
<v Speaker 3>their own structures and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3297
02:16:45.090 --> 02:16:49.850
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have this situation where at the </v>

3298
02:16:49.850 --> 02:16:49.850
<v Speaker 3>very least,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you disabled everything and they</v>

3299
02:16:49.850 --> 02:16:50.920
<v Speaker 3>couldn't retaliate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>retaliate,</v>

3300
02:16:51.130 --> 02:16:56.130
<v Speaker 3>soul is 35 miles away from the border.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to talk about tens of </v>

3301
02:16:56.130 --> 02:16:56.950
<v Speaker 3>thousands of people probably dead in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>few minutes.</v>

3302
02:16:57.790 --> 02:17:02.790
<v Speaker 3>And then you're getting us involved in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a refugee crisis on the </v>

3303
02:17:02.790 --> 02:17:03.610
<v Speaker 3>northwest border of North Korea that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>funneling in the China.</v>

3304
02:17:03.611 --> 02:17:08.611
<v Speaker 3>China gets involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia also shares borders and has </v>

3305
02:17:08.611 --> 02:17:08.890
<v Speaker 3>insurance interests in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Asia and East Asia.</v>

3306
02:17:09.760 --> 02:17:14.760
<v Speaker 3>This isn't something that a man who </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't understand things needs to be </v>

3307
02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:14.760
<v Speaker 3>trifling with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3308
02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:15.670
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3309
02:17:15.700 --> 02:17:20.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love nothing more than to have </v>

3310
02:17:20.700 --> 02:17:20.700
<v Speaker 3>North Korea taken down a peg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3311
02:17:20.700 --> 02:17:24.140
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but think he communicates with the </v>

3312
02:17:24.140 --> 02:17:24.140
<v Speaker 3>military.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3313
02:17:24.140 --> 02:17:27.210
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does he have the time to do </v>

3314
02:17:27.210 --> 02:17:27.210
<v Speaker 3>everything he's doing because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't.</v>

3315
02:17:27.210 --> 02:17:27.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll answer it</v>

3316
02:17:28.390 --> 02:17:29.680
<v Speaker 4>before I even asked her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He does.</v>

3317
02:17:29.681 --> 02:17:34.681
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no human has the time to be the </v>

3318
02:17:34.681 --> 02:17:36.841
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the problems with being </v>

3319
02:17:36.841 --> 02:17:38.701
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean what you were talking about </v>

3320
02:17:38.701 --> 02:17:40.741
<v Speaker 4>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how you have businesses and you run </v>

3321
02:17:40.741 --> 02:17:41.610
<v Speaker 4>things and how complicated and difficult</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is and those things are not.</v>

3322
02:17:41.940 --> 02:17:46.940
<v Speaker 4>No nothing compared to being the </v>
<v Speaker 4>president of thing and he's got to deal </v>

3323
02:17:46.940 --> 02:17:48.550
<v Speaker 4>with the economic situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got to deal with the military.</v>

3324
02:17:48.730 --> 02:17:53.730
<v Speaker 4>He's got to deal with immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's trying to build a fucking wall to </v>

3325
02:17:53.730 --> 02:17:56.881
<v Speaker 4>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's trying to bring jobs back to </v>

3326
02:17:56.881 --> 02:17:57.220
<v Speaker 4>America and he's playing golf 150 times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3327
02:17:57.221 --> 02:18:00.070
<v Speaker 4>he's played golf 72 times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cost the taxpayer.</v>

3328
02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:03.020
<v Speaker 4>Seventy 6 million,</v>
<v Speaker 4>236,000,</v>

3332
02:18:17.071 --> 02:18:17.071
<v Speaker 4>visits.</v>

3333
02:18:17.071 --> 02:18:21.850
<v Speaker 3>God Damn car frequently asked questions </v>
<v Speaker 3>for answers to frequently asked </v>

3335
02:18:25.780 --> 02:18:27.040

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3336
02:18:27.050 --> 02:18:27.410
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3337
02:18:27.420 --> 02:18:32.420
<v Speaker 3>it's the most complicated and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>encompassing jobs imaginable and he's </v>

3338
02:18:32.941 --> 02:18:33.780
<v Speaker 3>out golfing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3339
02:18:33.781 --> 02:18:34.140
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3340
02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:35.640
<v Speaker 3>once you got to have rest and </v>
<v Speaker 3>relaxation,</v>

3341
02:18:35.641 --> 02:18:37.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't begrudge you that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wonder like again,</v>

3342
02:18:37.801 --> 02:18:42.801
<v Speaker 3>because of the alienation that went on </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the primaries and into the </v>

3343
02:18:42.801 --> 02:18:42.801
<v Speaker 3>campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have people that are simply not</v>

3344
02:18:42.801 --> 02:18:43.740
<v Speaker 3>willing to work for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are very capable.</v>

3345
02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:45.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do?</v>

3346
02:18:45.511 --> 02:18:47.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's why nothing's happening.</v>

3347
02:18:47.310 --> 02:18:49.200
<v Speaker 3>That's why when they had the healthcare </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

3348
02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:51.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of crop up at early in the,</v>

3349
02:18:51.490 --> 02:18:53.310
<v Speaker 3>in the administration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't prepared.</v>

3350
02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:58.480
<v Speaker 3>When they don't have it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they still have not really released all </v>

3351
02:18:58.480 --> 02:18:58.480
<v Speaker 3>the details of their tax plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3352
02:18:58.480 --> 02:18:58.480
<v Speaker 3>what are you guys like?</v>

3353
02:18:58.480 --> 02:19:01.380
<v Speaker 3>Nothing has really happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that I'm telling you,</v>

3354
02:19:01.381 --> 02:19:06.381
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the major thing that's a bummer </v>

3355
02:19:06.381 --> 02:19:06.381
<v Speaker 3>to me is it's just wasted time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just wasted time.</v>

3356
02:19:06.381 --> 02:19:10.371
<v Speaker 3>We do not have time and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody has enough time to</v>

3357
02:19:10.411 --> 02:19:15.411
<v Speaker 3>actually be the president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wonder like what conversations </v>

3358
02:19:15.411 --> 02:19:16.020
<v Speaker 3>he's having with the military and what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how those decisions get made.</v>

3359
02:19:16.021 --> 02:19:18.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't really understand the process </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to know,</v>

3360
02:19:18.391 --> 02:19:20.970
<v Speaker 3>like say if North Korea does something </v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid,</v>

3361
02:19:21.250 --> 02:19:22.020
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3362
02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:27.200
<v Speaker 3>what are the decisions and who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who brings those decisions to the </v>

3363
02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:30.441
<v Speaker 3>president who brings us suggestions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who lays out the possibilities and how </v>

3364
02:19:30.621 --> 02:19:33.350
<v Speaker 3>does that go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think from what I understand,</v>

3365
02:19:33.351 --> 02:19:38.351
<v Speaker 3>the way it works is that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation room in the White House that </v>

3366
02:19:38.351 --> 02:19:41.491
<v Speaker 3>joint chiefs of Staff and the national </v>
<v Speaker 3>security advisor meet there to discuss </v>

3367
02:19:41.491 --> 02:19:44.921
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A president comes in when they're ready </v>

3368
02:19:44.921 --> 02:19:44.921
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to present them with things.</v>

3369
02:19:44.921 --> 02:19:45.260
<v Speaker 3>They present him based on the branch </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's dealing with it,</v>

3370
02:19:45.470 --> 02:19:47.400
<v Speaker 3>what's happening and then they give him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3371
02:19:47.420 --> 02:19:49.870
<v Speaker 3>what are reasonable responses or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3372
02:19:49.970 --> 02:19:53.960
<v Speaker 3>wait and see kind of things or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's how it goes down.</v>

3373
02:19:53.961 --> 02:19:54.940
<v Speaker 3>And then he tells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3374
02:19:54.950 --> 02:19:56.900
<v Speaker 3>the joint chiefs to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to act on his,</v>

3375
02:19:56.990 --> 02:20:01.990
<v Speaker 3>on his direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a great name for a room to the </v>

3376
02:20:01.990 --> 02:20:05.300
<v Speaker 3>situation room with Wolf Blitzer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your Situation Room?</v>

3377
02:20:05.920 --> 02:20:07.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How has he called him his own show?</v>

3378
02:20:07.671 --> 02:20:08.530
<v Speaker 3>That situation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3379
02:20:08.550 --> 02:20:09.660
<v Speaker 3>He got away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's getting away with it.</v>

3380
02:20:09.661 --> 02:20:11.840
<v Speaker 3>The fucking rude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know he's getting away with a wolf.</v>

3381
02:20:11.841 --> 02:20:15.160
<v Speaker 3>Blitzer is an interesting character and </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these guys on cable news or are</v>

3382
02:20:15.190 --> 02:20:17.080
<v Speaker 3>interesting people to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially now so.</v>

3383
02:20:17.280 --> 02:20:19.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're the,</v>

3384
02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:20.560
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's always been partisans.</v>

3385
02:20:20.570 --> 02:20:22.580
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about William F Buckley </v>
<v Speaker 3>and corporate al before.</v>

3386
02:20:22.581 --> 02:20:27.581
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's no pretenses now about </v>

3387
02:20:27.581 --> 02:20:28.160
<v Speaker 3>anything like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like no matter who you're watching,</v>

3388
02:20:28.161 --> 02:20:33.161
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't even tell you what a person </v>

3389
02:20:33.161 --> 02:20:35.171
<v Speaker 3>who doesn't have an ideal and open </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideological bent anymore and had had </v>

3390
02:20:35.171 --> 02:20:35.540
<v Speaker 3>some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3391
02:20:36.020 --> 02:20:41.020
<v Speaker 3>some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of like a means to an end for </v>

3392
02:20:41.020 --> 02:20:41.020
<v Speaker 3>them to get their information out there </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they want it.</v>

3393
02:20:41.020 --> 02:20:41.990
<v Speaker 3>There's no like Walter cronkite's </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

3394
02:20:42.360 --> 02:20:44.720
<v Speaker 3>No completely objective journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I would love.</v>

3395
02:20:44.721 --> 02:20:45.620
<v Speaker 3>I would love that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't try.</v>

3396
02:20:45.621 --> 02:20:47.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I don't really trust anything</v>

3397
02:20:47.061 --> 02:20:48.440
<v Speaker 3>the media says anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not only trump,</v>

3398
02:20:48.441 --> 02:20:50.340
<v Speaker 3>it's just like there's always an agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3399
02:20:50.550 --> 02:20:53.510
<v Speaker 3>There's no one who's delivering it all </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a straight face.</v>

3400
02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:56.180
<v Speaker 3>Everyone has an editorial bent to it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine,</v>

3401
02:20:56.240 --> 02:21:01.240
<v Speaker 3>but I wish that it when the only place </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can really go to get straight </v>

3402
02:21:01.240 --> 02:21:02.900
<v Speaker 3>up news now or the wires,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of like a little lonely,</v>

3403
02:21:02.930 --> 02:21:07.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to ap and Reuters and then that's </v>

3404
02:21:07.930 --> 02:21:07.930
<v Speaker 3>pretty much it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about the Internet?</v>

3405
02:21:07.930 --> 02:21:12.160
<v Speaker 3>Is Anybody doing a good job of </v>
<v Speaker 3>disseminating objective news on the </v>

3406
02:21:12.160 --> 02:21:12.610
<v Speaker 3>Internet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

3407
02:21:12.650 --> 02:21:16.070
<v Speaker 3>Not that anyone that I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's an opening for that.</v>

3408
02:21:16.100 --> 02:21:17.180
<v Speaker 3>If someone could figure it out.</v>

3409
02:21:17.210 --> 02:21:17.960
<v Speaker 3>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>

3410
02:21:17.990 --> 02:21:20.090
<v Speaker 3>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the sad thing is I don't know if</v>

3411
02:21:20.091 --> 02:21:21.470
<v Speaker 3>there's even an audience for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3412
02:21:21.471 --> 02:21:26.471
<v Speaker 3>like I think that people like you and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>that might want a more objective stance </v>

3413
02:21:26.471 --> 02:21:26.471
<v Speaker 3>to make up your own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3414
02:21:26.471 --> 02:21:30.880
<v Speaker 3>I remember I used to watch BBC World </v>
<v Speaker 3>News on pbs in college because it was </v>

3415
02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:32.510
<v Speaker 3>like this very outsider kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3416
02:21:33.650 --> 02:21:38.650
<v Speaker 3>40,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>foot view of what was going on and I </v>

3417
02:21:38.650 --> 02:21:41.051
<v Speaker 3>feel like we don't even really have that</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore and I feel like there's the </v>

3418
02:21:41.051 --> 02:21:41.051
<v Speaker 3>reason that those people don't exist is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there is no,</v>

3419
02:21:41.051 --> 02:21:41.470
<v Speaker 3>there's no money there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3420
02:21:41.540 --> 02:21:43.910
<v Speaker 3>It seems like the big monies in </v>
<v Speaker 3>preaching to the choir.</v>

3421
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:44.920
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

3422
02:21:44.940 --> 02:21:46.940
<v Speaker 3>that's why with what I was trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>is like,</v>

3423
02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:48.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get,</v>

3424
02:21:48.741 --> 02:21:51.230
<v Speaker 3>I take a lot of honor that I get fired </v>
<v Speaker 3>from every angle,</v>

3425
02:21:51.231 --> 02:21:52.370
<v Speaker 3>which means that I'm doing something </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3426
02:21:52.370 --> 02:21:54.410
<v Speaker 3>It's not like only the left wing people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that don't like me.</v>

3427
02:21:54.411 --> 02:21:55.850
<v Speaker 3>It's not only the people that don't like</v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

3428
02:21:56.300 --> 02:21:58.670
<v Speaker 3>it's like everybody has some problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>with me,</v>

3429
02:21:58.671 --> 02:22:00.860
<v Speaker 3>which makes me feel like maybe I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in the middle,</v>

3430
02:22:00.861 --> 02:22:01.680
<v Speaker 3>but I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't,</v>

3431
02:22:01.850 --> 02:22:03.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I have an agenda.</v>

3432
02:22:03.141 --> 02:22:04.730
<v Speaker 3>I guess I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have a point of view.</v>

3433
02:22:04.960 --> 02:22:09.140
<v Speaker 3>The news to me is the most fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well the news networks because CNN seems</v>

3434
02:22:09.141 --> 02:22:14.141
<v Speaker 3>almost like it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're weighted down by rules and </v>

3435
02:22:14.541 --> 02:22:16.820
<v Speaker 3>restrictions in a certain sense where </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Fox News.</v>

3436
02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:20.270
<v Speaker 3>He got Hannity who's just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely unhinged.</v>

3437
02:22:20.390 --> 02:22:25.390
<v Speaker 3>You had bill o'reilly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to fuck everything that </v>

3438
02:22:25.390 --> 02:22:25.390
<v Speaker 3>moves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3439
02:22:25.390 --> 02:22:26.160
<v Speaker 3>didn't that guy have like nine different</v>

3440
02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:28.170
<v Speaker 2>sexual harassment lawsuits that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>settled?</v>

3441
02:22:28.171 --> 02:22:31.950
<v Speaker 2>One of them for 35,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$35,000,000.</v>

3442
02:22:31.980 --> 02:22:35.040
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine how much money he really</v>

3443
02:22:35.041 --> 02:22:37.290
<v Speaker 2>has from his books and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he can even fork that much money over</v>

3444
02:22:37.490 --> 02:22:38.220
<v Speaker 2>because I was him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3445
02:22:38.221 --> 02:22:39.150
<v Speaker 2>That was even Fox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

3446
02:22:39.151 --> 02:22:41.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think it was highly files.</v>
<v Speaker 2>$5,</v>

3447
02:22:41.251 --> 02:22:43.890
<v Speaker 2>million dollar defamation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suit over harassment claims.</v>

3448
02:22:46.090 --> 02:22:50.970
<v Speaker 2>Trying to get back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go back to that.</v>

3449
02:22:50.971 --> 02:22:53.190
<v Speaker 2>Let me read the text underneath it </v>
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>

3450
02:22:53.670 --> 02:22:56.640
<v Speaker 2>Former Fox News host,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill O'reilly on Friday,</v>

3451
02:22:56.641 --> 02:22:59.640
<v Speaker 2>filed a defamation suit against former </v>
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey state legislator,</v>

3452
02:22:59.641 --> 02:23:04.641
<v Speaker 2>Michael Panter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Following a facebook post on Tuesday in </v>

3453
02:23:04.641 --> 02:23:07.761
<v Speaker 2>which panter detailed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alleged sexual harassment by O'reilly </v>

3454
02:23:08.310 --> 02:23:09.590
<v Speaker 2>against an unnamed ex partner of </v>
<v Speaker 2>panthers.</v>

3455
02:23:09.720 --> 02:23:10.770
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3456
02:23:10.980 --> 02:23:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Painters claims based on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations with his ex and incidents </v>

3457
02:23:15.980 --> 02:23:15.980
<v Speaker 2>he said that he witnessed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're chilling.</v>

3458
02:23:16.020 --> 02:23:20.970
<v Speaker 2>Panter says that his then girlfriend's </v>
<v Speaker 2>enclosed career was largely dependent on</v>

3459
02:23:20.971 --> 02:23:24.010
<v Speaker 2>staying on a Riley's good graces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3460
02:23:24.500 --> 02:23:29.310
<v Speaker 2>and that'll riley repeatedly asked her </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and made sexually charged late night</v>

3461
02:23:29.311 --> 02:23:30.180
<v Speaker 2>phone calls to her.</v>

3462
02:23:30.990 --> 02:23:35.990
<v Speaker 2>That's his move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He calls you up and says fucked up shit </v>

3463
02:23:35.990 --> 02:23:36.540
<v Speaker 2>on the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a freak.</v>

3464
02:23:36.690 --> 02:23:37.440
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3465
02:23:37.500 --> 02:23:42.500
<v Speaker 2>He must've been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of the Harvey Weinstein sort of </v>

3466
02:23:42.500 --> 02:23:45.530
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he must have been doing that </v>

3467
02:23:45.530 --> 02:23:45.530
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was his thing.</v>

3468
02:23:45.530 --> 02:23:45.540
<v Speaker 2>He would call chicks up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3469
02:23:45.570 --> 02:23:48.450
<v Speaker 2>What are you wearing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was about to call Reagan.</v>

3470
02:23:49.200 --> 02:23:52.050
<v Speaker 2>Got Him on speed dial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's from watching me jerk off.</v>

3471
02:23:52.110 --> 02:23:52.710
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3472
02:23:52.770 --> 02:23:55.110
<v Speaker 2>it's totally bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the power of money.</v>

3473
02:23:55.320 --> 02:23:57.840
<v Speaker 2>It gives you some sort of presumed Valle</v>
<v Speaker 2>against.</v>

3474
02:23:57.841 --> 02:24:00.240
<v Speaker 2>Thinks he does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also the Fox News thing.</v>

3475
02:24:00.270 --> 02:24:05.270
<v Speaker 2>It's so sexually charged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I have a whole bit about the way </v>

3476
02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:08.271
<v Speaker 2>the men and the women dress on Fox News </v>
<v Speaker 2>because those women dress like they're </v>

3477
02:24:08.271 --> 02:24:11.770
<v Speaker 2>going out on a hot date and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about like important issues.</v>

3478
02:24:11.800 --> 02:24:12.150
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3479
02:24:12.151 --> 02:24:17.151
<v Speaker 2>That little dresses and there always </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to be sitting at the edges of the </v>

3480
02:24:17.151 --> 02:24:17.230
<v Speaker 2>table so you can see their legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3481
02:24:17.290 --> 02:24:19.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was always very transparent to me.</v>

3482
02:24:19.531 --> 02:24:20.010
<v Speaker 2>I my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

3483
02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:21.030
<v Speaker 2>my thought was always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3484
02:24:21.031 --> 02:24:23.520
<v Speaker 2>these are old conservative men that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching this,</v>

3485
02:24:23.521 --> 02:24:28.521
<v Speaker 2>and you grabbed them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any way you can boil newt Gingrich's </v>

3486
02:24:28.940 --> 02:24:31.290
<v Speaker 2>feeling it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just holding onto a 70 year old.</v>

3487
02:24:31.291 --> 02:24:36.291
<v Speaker 2>Would our wish I had enough power to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stick it in any of these gals?</v>

3488
02:24:37.100 --> 02:24:38.910
<v Speaker 2>Do you think Newt Gingrich gets some hot</v>
<v Speaker 2>tail?</v>

3489
02:24:38.940 --> 02:24:41.190
<v Speaker 2>He's got probably did fairly well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't,</v>

3490
02:24:41.191 --> 02:24:43.410
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't a hill above and underwear.</v>

3491
02:24:43.470 --> 02:24:46.560
<v Speaker 2>A known philanderer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little of this little.</v>

3492
02:24:46.561 --> 02:24:49.290
<v Speaker 2>That sexiest ladies of Fox News as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

3493
02:24:49.830 --> 02:24:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>

3494
02:24:51.450 --> 02:24:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting too that somebody </v>

3495
02:24:56.450 --> 02:24:56.450
<v Speaker 2>needed to talk to Megan Kelly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3496
02:24:56.450 --> 02:24:57.920
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck was she thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jumping ship and going over to NBC.</v>

3497
02:24:57.970 --> 02:24:59.580
<v Speaker 2>She's dying over there apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3498
02:24:59.581 --> 02:25:01.860
<v Speaker 2>of course she's dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You the Ice Queen.</v>

3499
02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:07.040
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to be shouting down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The liberals mock and everybody and </v>

3500
02:25:07.040 --> 02:25:07.040
<v Speaker 2>telling everybody that Santa Claus is </v>
<v Speaker 2>white.</v>

3501
02:25:07.250 --> 02:25:08.640
<v Speaker 2>That's your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's your thing.</v>

3502
02:25:08.670 --> 02:25:09.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She.</v>

3503
02:25:09.260 --> 02:25:11.520
<v Speaker 2>She's apparently like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep reading about her,</v>

3504
02:25:11.610 --> 02:25:14.070
<v Speaker 2>about how people won't book on her show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3505
02:25:14.370 --> 02:25:16.560
<v Speaker 2>well she's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's bringing everyone down.</v>

3506
02:25:16.620 --> 02:25:21.620
<v Speaker 2>She's not stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's pressured and when people are </v>

3507
02:25:21.620 --> 02:25:25.251
<v Speaker 2>under pressure they falter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially people are not used to kind </v>

3508
02:25:25.251 --> 02:25:25.251
<v Speaker 2>of pressure</v>

3509
02:25:25.251 --> 02:25:26.260
<v Speaker 4>like she's used to people liking her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3510
02:25:26.261 --> 02:25:28.270
<v Speaker 4>I always thought she was brilliant on </v>
<v Speaker 4>Fox,</v>

3511
02:25:28.271 --> 02:25:30.370
<v Speaker 4>like the way she would communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

3512
02:25:30.371 --> 02:25:34.150
<v Speaker 4>She's very sharp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she just seemed so uncomfortable and</v>

3513
02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:38.830
<v Speaker 4>under pressure and nervous and awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like did you see the thing with will and</v>

3514
02:25:38.831 --> 02:25:40.180
<v Speaker 4>grace?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

3515
02:25:40.181 --> 02:25:45.181
<v Speaker 4>Where they had that exchange with </v>
<v Speaker 4>messing with a guy if he became gay </v>

3516
02:25:45.181 --> 02:25:47.320
<v Speaker 4>because he liked the character.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was like what?</v>

3517
02:25:47.890 --> 02:25:48.340
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

3518
02:25:48.341 --> 02:25:48.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3519
02:25:49.030 --> 02:25:50.890
<v Speaker 4>She had some other awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who was there was,</v>

3520
02:25:51.010 --> 02:25:56.010
<v Speaker 4>there was a couple early on where there </v>
<v Speaker 4>was a pretty awkward like exchanges </v>

3521
02:25:56.010 --> 02:25:57.640
<v Speaker 4>between her Jane Fonda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jane Fonda.</v>

3522
02:25:57.641 --> 02:25:58.570
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it was.</v>

3523
02:25:58.571 --> 02:26:02.500
<v Speaker 4>She asked about getting plastic surgery </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Jane Fonda just said,</v>

3524
02:26:02.501 --> 02:26:07.501
<v Speaker 4>are we really going to go there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then she went and I like to talk </v>

3525
02:26:07.501 --> 02:26:07.501
<v Speaker 4>about this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what I like about this movie.</v>

3526
02:26:07.501 --> 02:26:09.200
<v Speaker 4>She'd basically just steam rolled her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3527
02:26:09.201 --> 02:26:11.190
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel we were talking about typecasting</v>

3528
02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:11.560
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3529
02:26:11.561 --> 02:26:13.330
<v Speaker 4>About how people didn't feel like she's </v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

3530
02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:16.000
<v Speaker 4>she can't get away from what she was </v>
<v Speaker 4>also like,</v>

3531
02:26:16.030 --> 02:26:21.030
<v Speaker 4>that's a clunky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stupid thing to do to try to talk about </v>

3532
02:26:21.030 --> 02:26:21.160
<v Speaker 4>plastic surgery when someone's promoting</v>
<v Speaker 4>a movie.</v>

3533
02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:22.960
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's just trying to get soundbites.</v>

3534
02:26:23.260 --> 02:26:28.260
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's calculated effort to get sound </v>

3535
02:26:28.260 --> 02:26:28.260
<v Speaker 4>bites of the people will put up youtube </v>
<v Speaker 4>clips.</v>

3536
02:26:28.260 --> 02:26:33.120
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you give a lot of interviews or ever </v>

3537
02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:34.921
<v Speaker 4>given interviews like a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>or have you ever had a bad experiences </v>

3538
02:26:34.921 --> 02:26:35.130
<v Speaker 4>with that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talking to me.</v>

3539
02:26:35.810 --> 02:26:38.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying you being the on your own </v>
<v Speaker 4>show anymore,</v>

3540
02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:39.780
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't do them.</v>

3541
02:26:39.920 --> 02:26:42.700
<v Speaker 4>I feel like that's an incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 4>ineffective way to communicate.</v>

3542
02:26:43.060 --> 02:26:48.060
<v Speaker 4>I feel like you're doing yourself a </v>
<v Speaker 4>massive disservice to talk for five </v>

3543
02:26:48.060 --> 02:26:48.070
<v Speaker 4>minutes to someone that you don't even </v>
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>

3544
02:26:48.330 --> 02:26:50.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I wanted to talk to somebody,</v>

3545
02:26:50.020 --> 02:26:55.020
<v Speaker 4>I want to talk to them for hours and </v>
<v Speaker 4>let's do it live so that you can't edit </v>

3546
02:26:55.020 --> 02:26:55.020
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3547
02:26:57.390 --> 02:26:58.270
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>

3548
02:26:58.271 --> 02:27:00.520
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you really want to communicate ideas,</v>

3549
02:27:00.521 --> 02:27:05.521
<v Speaker 4>that's not the way to do it is the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>to jump off a little sound clips and </v>

3550
02:27:05.521 --> 02:27:06.250
<v Speaker 4>sound bites and then we'll be right </v>
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

3551
02:27:06.620 --> 02:27:09.760
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you go to commercial and it's like,</v>

3552
02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:12.220
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are we living in the fifties?</v>

3553
02:27:12.450 --> 02:27:12.910
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3554
02:27:12.970 --> 02:27:17.970
<v Speaker 4>this is a stupid way to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys need to revamp your whole </v>

3555
02:27:17.970 --> 02:27:17.970
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The system sucks.</v>

3556
02:27:17.970 --> 02:27:19.570
<v Speaker 4>This is a shitty way to communicate with</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

3557
02:27:19.690 --> 02:27:22.540
<v Speaker 4>Why are we even talking like this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're sitting over there,</v>

3558
02:27:22.660 --> 02:27:25.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm sitting over here and we're looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>at each other sideways.</v>

3559
02:27:25.541 --> 02:27:27.400
<v Speaker 4>How come you're at a desk and I'm on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>couch.</v>

3560
02:27:27.730 --> 02:27:29.530
<v Speaker 4>Why do you have a desk where you write </v>
<v Speaker 4>in books?</v>

3561
02:27:29.930 --> 02:27:31.690
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you doing over there in that desk?</v>

3562
02:27:31.691 --> 02:27:34.890
<v Speaker 4>This is the whole thing is just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's Jack Paar.</v>

3563
02:27:35.090 --> 02:27:40.090
<v Speaker 4>It's Johnny Carson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like this old school dumb way </v>

3564
02:27:40.090 --> 02:27:41.710
<v Speaker 4>of conducting these interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

3565
02:27:41.870 --> 02:27:43.240
<v Speaker 4>You have a band here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3566
02:27:43.241 --> 02:27:44.860
<v Speaker 4>let's let the band play us out.</v>

3567
02:27:47.900 --> 02:27:51.610
<v Speaker 4>It's like capital s show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking dumb.</v>

3568
02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:57.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the guy who does it the best is </v>

3569
02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.431
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy Kimmel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Jimmy Fallon does a pretty good </v>

3570
02:27:59.431 --> 02:27:59.431
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3571
02:27:59.431 --> 02:27:59.440
<v Speaker 4>he's got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He makes it fun.</v>

3572
02:27:59.450 --> 02:28:01.360
<v Speaker 4>He's got a lot of like fun things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>he does on it.</v>

3573
02:28:01.810 --> 02:28:06.810
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seth Meyers is a good job making it fun </v>

3574
02:28:06.810 --> 02:28:07.000
<v Speaker 4>as well and he has some really good </v>
<v Speaker 4>points.</v>

3575
02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:07.840
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I show,</v>

3576
02:28:07.841 --> 02:28:12.841
<v Speaker 4>but I just think ultimately I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can barely express myself in five </v>

3577
02:28:12.841 --> 02:28:12.841
<v Speaker 4>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven minutes,</v>

3578
02:28:13.180 --> 02:28:15.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and especially in front of a crowd,</v>

3579
02:28:15.430 --> 02:28:20.430
<v Speaker 4>you're sitting there in front of a crowd</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you want to talk about important </v>

3580
02:28:20.430 --> 02:28:20.980
<v Speaker 4>things or funny things are right tab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

3581
02:28:21.020 --> 02:28:22.430
<v Speaker 4>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't like the zoo.</v>

3582
02:28:22.490 --> 02:28:26.240
<v Speaker 4>Tell us why you don't like the zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking animal prison and I think</v>

3583
02:28:26.241 --> 02:28:30.080
<v Speaker 4>it's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can even say those words.</v>

3584
02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:30.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>

3585
02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:35.220
<v Speaker 5>I feel like there's A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that people,</v>

3586
02:28:35.250 --> 02:28:37.860
<v Speaker 5>some people have a short attention span.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't want long things or whatever,</v>

3587
02:28:37.861 --> 02:28:41.080
<v Speaker 5>but I think that like a show like yours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think fills a niche assignment.</v>

3588
02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:46.200
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd show but fills this need that I </v>

3589
02:28:46.200 --> 02:28:47.640
<v Speaker 5>think is underrated that people like </v>
<v Speaker 5>long form things that they like depth,</v>

3590
02:28:47.880 --> 02:28:52.880
<v Speaker 5>that they have lots of time to burn when</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're driving around or at work in </v>

3591
02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:53.100
<v Speaker 5>their board or they're just cooking food</v>
<v Speaker 5>or whatever it is they're doing.</v>

3592
02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:54.690
<v Speaker 5>I used to have that argument in my old </v>
<v Speaker 5>company.</v>

3593
02:28:54.691 --> 02:28:56.880
<v Speaker 5>Where are we?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3594
02:28:56.881 --> 02:29:01.881
<v Speaker 5>you guys are just wrong when you make </v>
<v Speaker 5>the show three or four or five minutes </v>

3595
02:29:01.881 --> 02:29:01.881
<v Speaker 5>for them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3596
02:29:01.881 --> 02:29:05.091
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'll be as long as I want it to be for </v>

3597
02:29:05.091 --> 02:29:07.431
<v Speaker 5>me to get my word out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was right about that and I feel </v>

3598
02:29:07.431 --> 02:29:07.431
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I like the long form stuff.</v>

3599
02:29:07.431 --> 02:29:11.570
<v Speaker 5>I like for things to be as long as they </v>
<v Speaker 5>need to be and flush things out into not</v>

3600
02:29:11.580 --> 02:29:14.640
<v Speaker 5>corner people to let them express them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>explain themselves and stuff like that.</v>

3601
02:29:14.641 --> 02:29:16.470
<v Speaker 5>I think it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why it show so popular,</v>

3602
02:29:16.500 --> 02:29:17.070
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

3603
02:29:18.340 --> 02:29:20.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm surprised that people aren't kind of</v>

3604
02:29:20.581 --> 02:29:22.890
<v Speaker 5>more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more and more and more aping the idea of</v>

3605
02:29:22.891 --> 02:29:23.670
<v Speaker 5>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>going three,</v>

3606
02:29:23.671 --> 02:29:25.460
<v Speaker 5>four or five hours if necessary with </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

3607
02:29:25.650 --> 02:29:27.340
<v Speaker 4>Some people don't want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3608
02:29:27.341 --> 02:29:32.341
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a uniquely blabber mouth type </v>

3609
02:29:32.341 --> 02:29:34.820
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can just keep talking about things </v>

3610
02:29:34.820 --> 02:29:36.741
<v Speaker 4>forever and also I'm not connected to </v>
<v Speaker 4>something else where I have to worry </v>

3611
02:29:36.741 --> 02:29:36.950
<v Speaker 4>about what I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3612
02:29:36.951 --> 02:29:40.260
<v Speaker 4>like I can't get fired if I'm the boss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm my own boss,</v>

3613
02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:42.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so a lot of people don't.</v>

3614
02:29:42.330 --> 02:29:43.800
<v Speaker 4>They're not in that position,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3615
02:29:43.801 --> 02:29:48.801
<v Speaker 4>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they really worry about putting their </v>

3616
02:29:48.801 --> 02:29:51.681
<v Speaker 4>foot in their mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I've definitely done a ton of </v>

3617
02:29:51.681 --> 02:29:53.811
<v Speaker 4>times and that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that being the end of their career </v>

3618
02:29:53.811 --> 02:29:53.811
<v Speaker 4>instead of being what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a mistake,</v>

3619
02:29:54.020 --> 02:29:59.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think for people to really get a </v>

3620
02:29:59.020 --> 02:29:59.670
<v Speaker 4>sense of who you truly are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3621
02:30:00.030 --> 02:30:02.250
<v Speaker 4>you get a sense of who someone is over </v>
<v Speaker 4>three hours,</v>

3622
02:30:02.520 --> 02:30:04.890
<v Speaker 4>you really get a sense of who someone is</v>
<v Speaker 4>over three hours,</v>

3623
02:30:04.891 --> 02:30:07.440
<v Speaker 4>over a thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>200 podcasts,</v>

3624
02:30:07.441 --> 02:30:12.441
<v Speaker 4>where the fuck we've done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are we on thousand 20 or something </v>

3625
02:30:12.441 --> 02:30:12.441
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

3626
02:30:12.441 --> 02:30:15.980
<v Speaker 4>One thousand 32 plus fight companions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of fucking shows.</v>

3627
02:30:17.070 --> 02:30:18.750
<v Speaker 4>People get a sense of who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3628
02:30:18.930 --> 02:30:20.670
<v Speaker 4>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just different.</v>

3629
02:30:20.671 --> 02:30:22.850
<v Speaker 4>It's a different kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3630
02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:26.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a television show is a more polished,</v>

3631
02:30:26.850 --> 02:30:31.850
<v Speaker 4>edited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be better for your attention </v>

3632
02:30:31.850 --> 02:30:31.980
<v Speaker 4>span me if this was on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just regular TV,</v>

3633
02:30:32.010 --> 02:30:33.810
<v Speaker 4>maybe it would be a bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3634
02:30:33.811 --> 02:30:37.920
<v Speaker 4>maybe like uniquely fits into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>weirdness that is the internet.</v>

3635
02:30:38.020 --> 02:30:43.020
<v Speaker 4>That's why it's been successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also I think it's probably been </v>

3636
02:30:43.020 --> 02:30:46.431
<v Speaker 4>successful because it was never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was never any attempt at being </v>

3637
02:30:46.431 --> 02:30:46.431
<v Speaker 4>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

3638
02:30:46.431 --> 02:30:48.120
<v Speaker 4>it was never like something where I sat </v>
<v Speaker 4>out and go,</v>

3639
02:30:48.510 --> 02:30:53.510
<v Speaker 4>if I just do this a certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it will be financially viable.</v>

3640
02:30:53.821 --> 02:30:57.570
<v Speaker 4>It will be received well and will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll use this as a vehicle to further my</v>

3641
02:30:57.571 --> 02:31:00.120
<v Speaker 4>other endeavors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's never any thought process,</v>

3642
02:31:00.121 --> 02:31:01.170
<v Speaker 4>right that it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3643
02:31:01.171 --> 02:31:02.740
<v Speaker 4>be cool to just talk to people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

3644
02:31:02.840 --> 02:31:06.450
<v Speaker 4>think I can get Anthony Bordain come </v>
<v Speaker 4>over my house sitting right there,</v>

3645
02:31:06.451 --> 02:31:08.070
<v Speaker 4>let's give them some beers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's have talks,</v>

3646
02:31:08.450 --> 02:31:08.990
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3647
02:31:09.130 --> 02:31:10.610
<v Speaker 4>and that's where it all came from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3648
02:31:10.660 --> 02:31:11.690
<v Speaker 4>just came organically.</v>

3649
02:31:11.920 --> 02:31:12.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

3650
02:31:12.391 --> 02:31:13.740
<v Speaker 5>that's the beauty of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that,</v>

3651
02:31:13.810 --> 02:31:18.810
<v Speaker 5>I think that shines through with your </v>
<v Speaker 5>showing up in some other people that </v>

3652
02:31:18.810 --> 02:31:18.810
<v Speaker 5>like you can tell when someone's putting</v>
<v Speaker 5>it on.</v>

3653
02:31:18.810 --> 02:31:20.150
<v Speaker 5>Someone mean I of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure</v>

3654
02:31:20.150 --> 02:31:22.350
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think you'd like to hope you</v>

3655
02:31:22.351 --> 02:31:23.190
<v Speaker 3>can?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3656
02:31:23.240 --> 02:31:24.810
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well Bill Cosby.</v>

3657
02:31:25.040 --> 02:31:25.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who?</v>

3658
02:31:25.460 --> 02:31:25.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he bought it.</v>

3659
02:31:25.940 --> 02:31:27.400
<v Speaker 3>Probably would have failed both of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

3660
02:31:27.480 --> 02:31:28.170
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not though.</v>

3661
02:31:29.180 --> 02:31:29.570
<v Speaker 4>Me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3662
02:31:29.571 --> 02:31:31.430
<v Speaker 4>And he never had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's part of the thing.</v>

3663
02:31:31.640 --> 02:31:33.980
<v Speaker 4>Like he might've fooled both of us if he</v>
<v Speaker 4>was on the tonight show,</v>

3664
02:31:34.340 --> 02:31:39.340
<v Speaker 4>but if he was sitting across the room </v>
<v Speaker 4>for us for three hours just talking </v>

3665
02:31:39.340 --> 02:31:39.340
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3666
02:31:39.340 --> 02:31:41.260
<v Speaker 4>maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3667
02:31:41.300 --> 02:31:42.140
<v Speaker 4>we never really gotten to.</v>

3668
02:31:42.370 --> 02:31:42.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3669
02:31:43.430 --> 02:31:45.560
<v Speaker 3>You must have been overdoing thousand </v>
<v Speaker 3>episodes,</v>

3670
02:31:45.840 --> 02:31:47.300
<v Speaker 3>many hundreds of guests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You must,</v>

3671
02:31:47.810 --> 02:31:52.810
<v Speaker 3>you must learn a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you were saying a lot about a </v>

3672
02:31:52.810 --> 02:31:52.810
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that.</v>

3673
02:31:52.810 --> 02:31:57.360
<v Speaker 3>Does your opinion of the person change </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have some interesting </v>

3674
02:31:57.360 --> 02:31:57.360
<v Speaker 3>interviews with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with bigger people,</v>

3675
02:31:57.360 --> 02:31:58.820
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that come on your show better or worse?</v>

3676
02:31:58.821 --> 02:32:01.220
<v Speaker 3>Like after kind of poking and prodding </v>
<v Speaker 3>them for a little while?</v>

3677
02:32:01.250 --> 02:32:01.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you,</v>

3678
02:32:01.880 --> 02:32:03.650
<v Speaker 3>I think you did data chunk right?</v>

3679
02:32:03.680 --> 02:32:05.900
<v Speaker 4>Whenever you're talking to people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3680
02:32:05.910 --> 02:32:10.910
<v Speaker 4>you see sort of some sort of patterns in</v>
<v Speaker 4>deflection and communication and </v>

3681
02:32:11.150 --> 02:32:13.850
<v Speaker 4>openness and some people really impress </v>
<v Speaker 4>you with their honesty,</v>

3682
02:32:14.340 --> 02:32:17.930
<v Speaker 4>their thoughtfulness or objectivity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Objectivity is a rare one.</v>

3683
02:32:17.931 --> 02:32:22.931
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a particularly rare thing where </v>

3684
02:32:22.931 --> 02:32:25.580
<v Speaker 4>so many people are so married to their </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas and I try very hard not to be.</v>

3685
02:32:25.581 --> 02:32:29.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm certainly not perfect at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I try very hard to not be married to</v>

3686
02:32:29.751 --> 02:32:33.230
<v Speaker 4>my ideas and if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really go out of my way to say,</v>

3687
02:32:33.530 --> 02:32:35.090
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was definitely wrong about that.</v>

3688
02:32:35.220 --> 02:32:37.160
<v Speaker 4>Like I thought that was this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not.</v>

3689
02:32:37.161 --> 02:32:40.160
<v Speaker 4>It's that and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is how we know and here's the proof</v>

3690
02:32:40.161 --> 02:32:41.990
<v Speaker 4>now and here's the studies that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>come out.</v>

3691
02:32:42.020 --> 02:32:43.580
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking that threw me for a loop.</v>

3692
02:32:43.850 --> 02:32:45.890
<v Speaker 4>But you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to do that.</v>

3693
02:32:46.150 --> 02:32:49.640
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there are so many people that do not</v>

3694
02:32:49.641 --> 02:32:53.180
<v Speaker 4>want to ever admit fault and because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3695
02:32:53.810 --> 02:32:57.950
<v Speaker 4>because you don't want to admit fault </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you don't want to admit that you</v>

3696
02:32:57.951 --> 02:33:02.951
<v Speaker 4>might've communicated in error or you </v>
<v Speaker 4>might've been misled by certain </v>

3697
02:33:02.951 --> 02:33:04.040
<v Speaker 4>information that you thought was true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but turned out to not be.</v>

3698
02:33:04.790 --> 02:33:09.790
<v Speaker 4>It ruins the way people appreciate your </v>
<v Speaker 4>words because you could tell me that you</v>

3699
02:33:10.491 --> 02:33:15.491
<v Speaker 4>believe something happened in the past </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you read it because you learned </v>

3700
02:33:15.831 --> 02:33:18.380
<v Speaker 4>it in school because it's always been </v>
<v Speaker 4>taught that way,</v>

3701
02:33:18.770 --> 02:33:21.440
<v Speaker 4>but then new information comes out that </v>
<v Speaker 4>clearly refutes that.</v>

3702
02:33:21.980 --> 02:33:24.290
<v Speaker 4>You've got to come in here and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well now I know different,</v>

3703
02:33:24.520 --> 02:33:27.620
<v Speaker 4>but I thought this because I know that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you really did think that.</v>

3704
02:33:27.621 --> 02:33:32.621
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you were really being honest and </v>

3705
02:33:32.621 --> 02:33:34.901
<v Speaker 4>now I know you're being even more honest</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're saying now we know </v>

3706
02:33:34.901 --> 02:33:37.080
<v Speaker 4>differently that now we know differently</v>
<v Speaker 4>is fucking giant map.</v>

3707
02:33:37.130 --> 02:33:41.510
<v Speaker 4>It's huge and you see it resisted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see a dissident academia.</v>

3708
02:33:41.900 --> 02:33:46.900
<v Speaker 4>You see it because people have been </v>
<v Speaker 4>teaching certain things for a certain </v>

3709
02:33:46.900 --> 02:33:49.541
<v Speaker 4>amount of time and then new evidence </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes to light and they don't want to </v>

3710
02:33:49.541 --> 02:33:49.930
<v Speaker 4>consider it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He resisted at all.</v>

3711
02:33:50.210 --> 02:33:55.210
<v Speaker 4>Like I had a conversation once on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>radio with this lady who called up and </v>

3712
02:33:55.210 --> 02:33:58.421
<v Speaker 4>she was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was telling me that she was a </v>

3713
02:33:58.421 --> 02:34:00.230
<v Speaker 4>paleontologist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would who's studying monkeys?</v>

3714
02:34:02.090 --> 02:34:04.190
<v Speaker 4>The biologist would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would it be a biologist?</v>

3715
02:34:04.800 --> 02:34:05.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like some sort of,</v>

3716
02:34:06.230 --> 02:34:08.870
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a biologist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she said,</v>

3717
02:34:09.130 --> 02:34:13.220
<v Speaker 4>I have my phd because I was talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the Bondo ape,</v>

3718
02:34:13.550 --> 02:34:17.090
<v Speaker 4>which is a very particularly large </v>
<v Speaker 4>species.</v>

3719
02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:22.200
<v Speaker 4>The Congo and I was going over all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>different things about this app and it </v>

3720
02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:25.000
<v Speaker 4>was on the open anthony show and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>lady called up and she goes,</v>

3721
02:34:25.001 --> 02:34:29.350
<v Speaker 4>you are just talking about pseudo </v>
<v Speaker 4>science and cryptozoology you don't know</v>

3722
02:34:29.351 --> 02:34:30.130
<v Speaker 4>where you're talking about.</v>

3723
02:34:30.370 --> 02:34:31.000
<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3724
02:34:31.050 --> 02:34:34.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm reciting an article.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a national geographic.</v>

3725
02:34:34.001 --> 02:34:36.160
<v Speaker 4>This is all new information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>

3726
02:34:36.960 --> 02:34:40.690
<v Speaker 4>she said she was a professor and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when did you study?</v>

3727
02:34:41.080 --> 02:34:42.070
<v Speaker 4>When did you learn?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

3728
02:34:42.100 --> 02:34:42.590
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

3729
02:34:42.591 --> 02:34:45.820
<v Speaker 4>how much time do you spend paying </v>
<v Speaker 4>attention to the newest,</v>

3730
02:34:46.030 --> 02:34:48.790
<v Speaker 4>latest information because clearly </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're wrong.</v>

3731
02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:50.890
<v Speaker 4>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have skulls,</v>

3732
02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:53.800
<v Speaker 4>they have videos of these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have photographs of them,</v>

3733
02:34:53.801 --> 02:34:55.840
<v Speaker 4>they have camera trap photos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have DNA on them.</v>

3734
02:34:56.020 --> 02:34:57.730
<v Speaker 4>They have a crest in their head like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>gorilla,</v>

3735
02:34:57.940 --> 02:35:00.790
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I get obsessed with things,</v>

3736
02:35:01.060 --> 02:35:04.510
<v Speaker 4>I have an ability to rattle off </v>
<v Speaker 4>information or rattle off information.</v>

3737
02:35:04.511 --> 02:35:06.820
<v Speaker 4>This lady and she never says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3738
02:35:06.821 --> 02:35:07.990
<v Speaker 4>you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3739
02:35:07.991 --> 02:35:09.160
<v Speaker 4>she never says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3740
02:35:09.161 --> 02:35:12.460
<v Speaker 4>I guess I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am going on old information.</v>

3741
02:35:12.461 --> 02:35:14.560
<v Speaker 4>She starts laughing and mocking me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

3742
02:35:14.710 --> 02:35:19.710
<v Speaker 4>are you better than these scientists </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are in national geographic that are</v>

3743
02:35:20.441 --> 02:35:23.770
<v Speaker 4>putting out these photographs that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>spending years in the Congo?</v>

3744
02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:28.920
<v Speaker 4>Carl Jung,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Swiss wildlife photographer that </v>

3745
02:35:28.920 --> 02:35:29.680
<v Speaker 4>spent years in the Congo photographing </v>
<v Speaker 4>these creatures.</v>

3746
02:35:29.681 --> 02:35:34.681
<v Speaker 4>They nest on the ground like gorillas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are particularly large species of </v>

3747
02:35:34.681 --> 02:35:38.221
<v Speaker 4>chimpanzees there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I started rattling off inflammation </v>

3748
02:35:38.221 --> 02:35:38.221
<v Speaker 4>and the lady's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3749
02:35:38.221 --> 02:35:38.860
<v Speaker 4>like you don't know what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

3750
02:35:38.861 --> 02:35:41.050
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not fucking saying anything.</v>

3751
02:35:41.230 --> 02:35:46.230
<v Speaker 4>You're not saying anything because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know you don't have the latest </v>

3752
02:35:46.230 --> 02:35:49.381
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That kinda shit drives me nuts when </v>

3753
02:35:49.381 --> 02:35:52.921
<v Speaker 4>someone doesn't really know but pretends</v>
<v Speaker 4>they know is presented with information </v>

3754
02:35:54.520 --> 02:35:56.520
<v Speaker 4>and isn't willing to accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3755
02:35:56.570 --> 02:35:58.270
<v Speaker 4>you got to be willing to accept </v>
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>

3756
02:35:58.271 --> 02:36:01.780
<v Speaker 4>Like this lady called up to try to like </v>
<v Speaker 4>to puff out her chest.</v>

3757
02:36:01.781 --> 02:36:03.460
<v Speaker 4>Like she has the information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like she's a,</v>

3758
02:36:03.610 --> 02:36:05.770
<v Speaker 4>she's a professor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She knows,</v>

3759
02:36:05.771 --> 02:36:08.560
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not saying I'm not in the woods </v>
<v Speaker 4>studying.</v>

3760
02:36:08.770 --> 02:36:11.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm reading all these fucking biologists</v>
<v Speaker 4>who were there there.</v>

3761
02:36:11.750 --> 02:36:16.750
<v Speaker 4>This is amazing new discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a fucking giant champ </v>

3762
02:36:16.750 --> 02:36:21.061
<v Speaker 4>that lives in the Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's photos of this thing walking </v>

3763
02:36:21.061 --> 02:36:21.700
<v Speaker 4>around on two legs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's six feet tall.</v>

3764
02:36:21.850 --> 02:36:25.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a huge chimpanzee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's far bigger than the other chimps.</v>

3765
02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:28.610
<v Speaker 4>They have two different types of champs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have treat the,</v>

3766
02:36:28.740 --> 02:36:33.370
<v Speaker 4>they call them tree beaters and and </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground something.</v>

3767
02:36:33.371 --> 02:36:38.371
<v Speaker 4>I forget the term they use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but these larger chimps literally sleep </v>

3768
02:36:38.981 --> 02:36:40.600
<v Speaker 4>on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't give a fuck.</v>

3769
02:36:40.930 --> 02:36:42.730
<v Speaker 4>Nothing comes near them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

3770
02:36:42.820 --> 02:36:45.940
<v Speaker 4>Oh the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they call them leopardy eaters,</v>

3771
02:36:46.810 --> 02:36:48.640
<v Speaker 4>but they've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have video of them,</v>

3772
02:36:48.700 --> 02:36:53.320
<v Speaker 4>one of them literally eating a leopard </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they don't know if it killed it.</v>

3773
02:36:53.680 --> 02:36:57.790
<v Speaker 4>They don't know if it found a dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like if these motherfuckers can kill</v>

3774
02:36:57.791 --> 02:37:02.791
<v Speaker 4>leopards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you think about how strong a </v>

3775
02:37:02.791 --> 02:37:02.791
<v Speaker 4>regular chimpanzee is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3776
02:37:02.791 --> 02:37:06.280
<v Speaker 4>a regular hundred and 50,</v>
<v Speaker 4>150 pound chimpanzee,</v>

3777
02:37:06.460 --> 02:37:09.400
<v Speaker 4>it's supposed to be as strong as a 500 </v>
<v Speaker 4>pound man.</v>

3778
02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:11.470
<v Speaker 4>A lion killers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they call them.</v>

3779
02:37:12.250 --> 02:37:14.290
<v Speaker 4>These,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are huge chimpanzees.</v>

3780
02:37:14.740 --> 02:37:16.940
<v Speaker 4>See if a pull up a photograph,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of these fuckers,</v>

3781
02:37:17.180 --> 02:37:19.820
<v Speaker 4>but they have these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of these two guys shot at a,</v>

3782
02:37:20.480 --> 02:37:23.540
<v Speaker 4>at an airport and a small airport in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Congo.</v>

3783
02:37:23.660 --> 02:37:26.600
<v Speaker 4>And there's these two guys standing </v>
<v Speaker 4>holding this carcass.</v>

3784
02:37:26.630 --> 02:37:30.290
<v Speaker 4>The righthand side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>third down far right hand side,</v>

3785
02:37:30.291 --> 02:37:32.540
<v Speaker 4>third down far right hand side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>third down,</v>

3786
02:37:32.541 --> 02:37:33.710
<v Speaker 4>third down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

3787
02:37:33.711 --> 02:37:34.400
<v Speaker 4>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

3788
02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:38.120
<v Speaker 4>Go large on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at a size of that fucking thing.</v>

3789
02:37:39.020 --> 02:37:43.240
<v Speaker 4>That's a chimp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like a goddamn because the size</v>

3790
02:37:43.250 --> 02:37:48.250
<v Speaker 4>of his balls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that is a fucking huge </v>

3791
02:37:48.250 --> 02:37:50.820
<v Speaker 4>chimpanzee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one that they found that,</v>

3792
02:37:50.821 --> 02:37:52.820
<v Speaker 4>that they had shot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they took photographs of,</v>

3793
02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:54.770
<v Speaker 4>but if you go above that photo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>

3794
02:37:55.070 --> 02:37:58.310
<v Speaker 4>go above that photo to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the upper right hand corner.</v>

3795
02:37:59.210 --> 02:38:01.460
<v Speaker 4>That's one that they caught walking </v>
<v Speaker 4>around on a,</v>

3796
02:38:01.461 --> 02:38:03.650
<v Speaker 4>on a camera trap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just much,</v>

3797
02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:06.230
<v Speaker 4>much bigger than regular chimpanzees as </v>
<v Speaker 4>wild.</v>

3798
02:38:06.410 --> 02:38:07.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No Pun intended,</v>

3799
02:38:07.910 --> 02:38:10.010
<v Speaker 4>but the point was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is just,</v>

3800
02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:15.400
<v Speaker 4>it was an incidence of someone just </v>
<v Speaker 4>deciding that they had all the </v>

3801
02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:19.361
<v Speaker 4>information and that they wanted to just</v>
<v Speaker 4>call bullshit on something that they're </v>

3802
02:38:19.361 --> 02:38:21.320
<v Speaker 4>really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They really weren't up to date on it.</v>

3803
02:38:21.350 --> 02:38:22.010
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3804
02:38:22.011 --> 02:38:27.011
<v Speaker 5>I think pride gets in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of that I try my hardest and I </v>

3805
02:38:27.011 --> 02:38:28.610
<v Speaker 5>actually kind of gets to me when my </v>
<v Speaker 5>audience are people that watch my stuff,</v>

3806
02:38:28.611 --> 02:38:29.060
<v Speaker 5>say like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3807
02:38:29.090 --> 02:38:30.920
<v Speaker 5>Colin didn't admit he was wrong about </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

3808
02:38:30.921 --> 02:38:31.520
<v Speaker 5>this or this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3809
02:38:31.521 --> 02:38:36.521
<v Speaker 5>I don't know that you're paying very </v>
<v Speaker 5>close attention because I actually take </v>

3810
02:38:36.521 --> 02:38:38.471
<v Speaker 5>a lot of pride in being wrong about </v>
<v Speaker 5>things sometimes and telling you that </v>

3811
02:38:38.471 --> 02:38:38.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you know,</v>

3812
02:38:38.930 --> 02:38:41.630
<v Speaker 5>so you're not going out into the world </v>
<v Speaker 5>with misinformation.</v>

3813
02:38:41.631 --> 02:38:42.980
<v Speaker 5>Whether it was about video games back in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the day,</v>

3814
02:38:42.981 --> 02:38:44.330
<v Speaker 5>whether it's about politics or history.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got,</v>

3815
02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:45.860
<v Speaker 5>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're rattling things off,</v>

3816
02:38:45.861 --> 02:38:47.330
<v Speaker 5>like you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when you're rattling things off,</v>

3817
02:38:47.331 --> 02:38:50.160
<v Speaker 5>sometimes you get things mixed up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>confused and things of like,</v>

3818
02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:55.360
<v Speaker 5>I don't even realize it while I'm saying</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I'm saying the wrong word or </v>

3819
02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:55.360
<v Speaker 5>someone's name wrong.</v>

3820
02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:55.360
<v Speaker 5>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3821
02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:56.630
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that it's,</v>

3822
02:38:56.720 --> 02:38:58.760
<v Speaker 5>I think it's essential to do those kinds</v>
<v Speaker 5>of things.</v>

3823
02:38:58.761 --> 02:39:00.130
<v Speaker 5>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

3824
02:39:00.200 --> 02:39:00.630
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

3825
02:39:00.660 --> 02:39:03.200
<v Speaker 5>it represents an academic stagnance when</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to do that.</v>

3826
02:39:03.201 --> 02:39:04.850
<v Speaker 5>I certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3827
02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:06.920
<v Speaker 5>even though I consider myself again a </v>
<v Speaker 5>moderate conservative,</v>

3828
02:39:06.921 --> 02:39:11.921
<v Speaker 5>I certainly have been playing around </v>
<v Speaker 5>intentionally with really challenging </v>

3829
02:39:11.921 --> 02:39:11.921
<v Speaker 5>ideas lately to try to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3830
02:39:12.010 --> 02:39:13.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>specifically with universal basic income</v>

3831
02:39:13.820 --> 02:39:15.620
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and Medicare for all where I'm like,</v>

3832
02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:18.260
<v Speaker 5>I'm fundamentally principally probably </v>
<v Speaker 5>against these things.</v>

3833
02:39:18.261 --> 02:39:21.620
<v Speaker 5>But if you can show me how they work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I can read some data,</v>

3834
02:39:21.830 --> 02:39:26.830
<v Speaker 5>we can get some test cases.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know they're testing ubi in places </v>

3835
02:39:26.830 --> 02:39:29.591
<v Speaker 5>like Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then I want to see what it's all about </v>

3836
02:39:29.591 --> 02:39:29.591
<v Speaker 5>because this is so uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is so out of,</v>

3837
02:39:29.591 --> 02:39:31.970
<v Speaker 5>out of whack for me that I want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3838
02:39:32.300 --> 02:39:34.310
<v Speaker 5>how it works and I think with you on </v>
<v Speaker 5>that one,</v>

3839
02:39:34.311 --> 02:39:34.880
<v Speaker 5>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3840
02:39:34.960 --> 02:39:35.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a,</v>

3841
02:39:35.441 --> 02:39:37.780
<v Speaker 4>that's an interesting one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I believe they're testing it in some</v>

3842
02:39:37.930 --> 02:39:39.790
<v Speaker 4>someplace in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are they?</v>

3843
02:39:40.030 --> 02:39:45.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think somewhere in the United States </v>

3844
02:39:45.030 --> 02:39:47.041
<v Speaker 4>going to test universal basic income.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have a good find that this like </v>

3845
02:39:47.041 --> 02:39:47.980
<v Speaker 4>fairly recently over the last few days.</v>

3846
02:39:48.140 --> 02:39:48.540
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

3847
02:39:48.541 --> 02:39:50.060
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just fascinating to kind of get out</v>

3848
02:39:50.061 --> 02:39:50.830
<v Speaker 5>of your head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3849
02:39:51.080 --> 02:39:55.100
<v Speaker 5>I've been dealing with this idea of this</v>
<v Speaker 5>idea of rights versus privileges and how</v>

3850
02:39:55.120 --> 02:39:57.600
<v Speaker 5>were we call a lot of things rights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're not right.</v>

3851
02:39:57.640 --> 02:39:59.900
<v Speaker 5>There's no right to medical the medical </v>
<v Speaker 5>care that they'll write to that.</v>

3852
02:40:00.210 --> 02:40:02.090
<v Speaker 5>But the idea of A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hate when people.</v>

3853
02:40:02.091 --> 02:40:03.540
<v Speaker 5>I guess it's a right to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>

3854
02:40:03.710 --> 02:40:05.330
<v Speaker 5>It's human,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3855
02:40:05.350 --> 02:40:05.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>

3856
02:40:06.350 --> 02:40:07.850
<v Speaker 5>You have a right to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're an alien.</v>

3857
02:40:07.890 --> 02:40:12.890
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the whole life and liberty and stuff </v>

3858
02:40:12.890 --> 02:40:12.890
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are rights.</v>

3859
02:40:12.890 --> 02:40:13.440
<v Speaker 5>You don't have a right to force someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>to do something for you,</v>

3860
02:40:13.770 --> 02:40:14.460
<v Speaker 5>is essentially</v>

3861
02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:19.460
<v Speaker 3>what you're forcing a doctor to work on </v>
<v Speaker 3>you if you don't have the money to pay </v>

3862
02:40:19.460 --> 02:40:19.460
<v Speaker 3>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

3863
02:40:19.460 --> 02:40:23.330
<v Speaker 3>but I think as a culture we should </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably put that in terms of like what </v>

3864
02:40:23.330 --> 02:40:27.801
<v Speaker 3>are we going to do for our citizens?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we would definitely going have </v>

3865
02:40:27.801 --> 02:40:29.780
<v Speaker 3>provide fire protection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're definitely going to provide </v>

3866
02:40:29.780 --> 02:40:33.081
<v Speaker 3>police.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should definitely provide medical </v>

3867
02:40:33.081 --> 02:40:33.081
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just think it's.</v>

3868
02:40:33.081 --> 02:40:36.140
<v Speaker 3>It should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There should be a safety net to keep </v>

3869
02:40:36.140 --> 02:40:36.140
<v Speaker 3>people healthy if they don't have money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3870
02:40:36.140 --> 02:40:39.390
<v Speaker 3>I think that it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a totally valid thing to say,</v>

3871
02:40:39.580 --> 02:40:40.980
<v Speaker 3>uh Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do we have it is.</v>

3872
02:40:41.190 --> 02:40:46.190
<v Speaker 3>Whereas this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they randomly selected 3000 individuals </v>

3873
02:40:46.190 --> 02:40:47.280
<v Speaker 3>across two US states participate in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>study.</v>

3874
02:40:47.460 --> 02:40:52.460
<v Speaker 3>1,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>received a thousand dollars per month </v>

3875
02:40:52.460 --> 02:40:54.690
<v Speaker 3>for up to five years in 2000 will </v>
<v Speaker 3>receive $50 per month.</v>

3876
02:40:55.410 --> 02:40:57.560
<v Speaker 3>What does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's the control for the,</v>

3877
02:40:57.640 --> 02:41:02.640
<v Speaker 3>for the express serve as a control group</v>
<v Speaker 3>for comparison with the $50 for is not </v>

3878
02:41:02.640 --> 02:41:06.201
<v Speaker 3>going to help shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thousand dollars per month that </v>

3879
02:41:06.201 --> 02:41:06.201
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

3880
02:41:06.201 --> 02:41:10.160
<v Speaker 3>That gets interesting because then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not giving anybody enough where </v>

3881
02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:13.161
<v Speaker 3>they can fuck off because 250 bucks is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really not going to pay for rent and </v>

3882
02:41:13.161 --> 02:41:14.070
<v Speaker 3>food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a.</v>

3883
02:41:14.071 --> 02:41:16.230
<v Speaker 3>it'll help you give you like a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit of a boost.</v>

3884
02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:17.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be good for the economy.</v>

3885
02:41:17.461 --> 02:41:22.461
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of worry about inflation </v>

3886
02:41:22.461 --> 02:41:25.730
<v Speaker 3>because you're basically freeing up a </v>
<v Speaker 3>ton of money that would otherwise be in </v>

3887
02:41:25.730 --> 02:41:28.371
<v Speaker 3>banks are not circulating on the market,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's gonna make your dollar less </v>

3888
02:41:28.371 --> 02:41:31.431
<v Speaker 3>valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of like </v>

3889
02:41:31.431 --> 02:41:31.431
<v Speaker 3>complicated things economically that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people have to deal with with that,</v>

3890
02:41:31.431 --> 02:41:36.080
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with what you were talking about with </v>

3891
02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:38.571
<v Speaker 3>healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's an interesting point </v>

3892
02:41:38.571 --> 02:41:39.681
<v Speaker 3>because we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We talk too much about rights and we </v>

3893
02:41:39.681 --> 02:41:43.221
<v Speaker 3>have these rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a right to not be searched </v>

3894
02:41:43.221 --> 02:41:43.221
<v Speaker 3>without a warrant.</v>

3895
02:41:43.221 --> 02:41:43.221
<v Speaker 3>You have a right to due process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his free speech rights,</v>

3896
02:41:43.221 --> 02:41:44.070
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3897
02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:46.230
<v Speaker 3>that are written in the bill of rights </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the constitution,</v>

3898
02:41:46.231 --> 02:41:51.000
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but privileges a 21st century modern,</v>

3899
02:41:51.570 --> 02:41:53.310
<v Speaker 3>progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wealthy society.</v>

3900
02:41:53.311 --> 02:41:55.500
<v Speaker 3>What can your privileges of being part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that society?</v>

3901
02:41:55.680 --> 02:41:57.210
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like when people talk about it in that</v>

3902
02:41:57.211 --> 02:42:02.211
<v Speaker 3>sense and be like medical care as a part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it is the privilege of being part of </v>

3903
02:42:02.211 --> 02:42:02.211
<v Speaker 3>a like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3904
02:42:02.211 --> 02:42:03.240
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's frame the art.</v>

3905
02:42:03.241 --> 02:42:08.241
<v Speaker 3>Let's frame the arguments differently </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think it's a more compelling </v>

3906
02:42:08.241 --> 02:42:08.820
<v Speaker 3>way to say we've achieved so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not in the dark ages anymore.</v>

3907
02:42:08.940 --> 02:42:11.190
<v Speaker 3>We're not even in the 18th or 19th </v>
<v Speaker 3>centuries anymore.</v>

3908
02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:13.260
<v Speaker 3>Now we have roads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have police and fire,</v>

3909
02:42:13.261 --> 02:42:18.261
<v Speaker 3>we have all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's to stop us from having the </v>

3910
02:42:18.261 --> 02:42:20.661
<v Speaker 3>privilege of having this as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's just frame it that way </v>

3911
02:42:20.661 --> 02:42:24.681
<v Speaker 3>and you'll have way more people on board</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a very compelling argument for </v>

3912
02:42:24.681 --> 02:42:26.040
<v Speaker 3>why we shouldn't spend $800 billion on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the military.</v>

3913
02:42:26.430 --> 02:42:28.680
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe if you had some of that money</v>
<v Speaker 3>freed up,</v>

3914
02:42:28.681 --> 02:42:30.480
<v Speaker 3>you could take care of a lot of things </v>
<v Speaker 3>at home.</v>

3915
02:42:30.570 --> 02:42:31.610
<v Speaker 3>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3916
02:42:31.710 --> 02:42:33.690
<v Speaker 3>medical care of Medicare for all is </v>
<v Speaker 3>expensive.</v>

3917
02:42:33.750 --> 02:42:35.040
<v Speaker 3>It's extremely expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Streamline.</v>

3918
02:42:35.070 --> 02:42:36.120
<v Speaker 3>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could actually,</v>

3919
02:42:36.390 --> 02:42:38.160
<v Speaker 3>as far as I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

3920
02:42:38.850 --> 02:42:41.430
<v Speaker 3>I think tax,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

3921
02:42:41.431 --> 02:42:46.431
<v Speaker 3>you could remove military spending </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely and pay for only like a </v>

3922
02:42:46.431 --> 02:42:46.431
<v Speaker 3>fourth of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

3923
02:42:46.431 --> 02:42:46.431
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3924
02:42:46.431 --> 02:42:47.220
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a really radically.</v>

3925
02:42:47.250 --> 02:42:47.880
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3926
02:42:47.881 --> 02:42:49.390
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>$800,</v>

3927
02:42:49.391 --> 02:42:51.390
<v Speaker 3>billion dollars a year would only pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a fourth.</v>

3928
02:42:51.420 --> 02:42:53.910
<v Speaker 3>I think it's 600 billion a year of </v>
<v Speaker 3>spending military spending right now.</v>

3929
02:42:53.911 --> 02:42:55.650
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

3930
02:42:55.680 --> 02:42:56.340
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you mind,</v>

3931
02:42:56.400 --> 02:43:01.400
<v Speaker 3>I hate to ask you to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do you mind looking to see how much </v>

3932
02:43:01.400 --> 02:43:04.011
<v Speaker 3>the Medicare for all thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I think it's something like one </v>

3933
02:43:04.011 --> 02:43:06.201
<v Speaker 3>point 5 trillion a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like 2 trillion a year or something </v>

3934
02:43:06.201 --> 02:43:06.201
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

3935
02:43:06.201 --> 02:43:10.010
<v Speaker 3>And so like these are the things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to have rational </v>

3936
02:43:10.010 --> 02:43:11.931
<v Speaker 3>conversations with why I have no respect</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Bernie Sanders because you can just </v>

3937
02:43:11.931 --> 02:43:11.931
<v Speaker 3>throw things out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3938
02:43:11.931 --> 02:43:12.070
<v Speaker 3>One</v>

3939
02:43:12.070 --> 02:43:17.070
<v Speaker 5>point $4,000,000,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you get Medicare for all plan cost </v>

3940
02:43:17.070 --> 02:43:18.310
<v Speaker 5>nearly one point 4 trillion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So a little off.</v>

3941
02:43:18.311 --> 02:43:20.120
<v Speaker 5>So it's a little less than half.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You actually you could.</v>

3942
02:43:21.280 --> 02:43:23.140
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a character.</v>

3943
02:43:23.470 --> 02:43:24.010
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's easy to.</v>

3944
02:43:24.011 --> 02:43:25.600
<v Speaker 5>It's easy to go around promising things </v>
<v Speaker 5>to people.</v>

3945
02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:28.120
<v Speaker 5>Like the funny thing is like Free </v>
<v Speaker 5>College,</v>

3946
02:43:28.121 --> 02:43:28.870
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like free,</v>

3947
02:43:28.900 --> 02:43:30.370
<v Speaker 5>nothing's free,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but free college.</v>

3948
02:43:30.371 --> 02:43:35.371
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well you're 401k is going to tax for </v>

3949
02:43:35.371 --> 02:43:35.371
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're,</v>

3950
02:43:35.371 --> 02:43:38.611
<v Speaker 5>if you're a middle class family and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're making transaction walter </v>

3951
02:43:38.611 --> 02:43:39.160
<v Speaker 5>transactions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>broker transactions with your forum,</v>

3952
02:43:39.161 --> 02:43:40.360
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to pay that tax.</v>

3953
02:43:40.450 --> 02:43:45.450
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's easy to say Medicare for all by </v>

3954
02:43:45.450 --> 02:43:45.450
<v Speaker 5>raising taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But everyone's taxes go up two point two</v>

3955
02:43:45.450 --> 02:43:45.580
<v Speaker 5>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3956
02:43:45.610 --> 02:43:47.200
<v Speaker 5>not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's also a real</v>

3957
02:43:47.230 --> 02:43:50.260
<v Speaker 4>concern with kids fucking off with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>education.</v>

3958
02:43:50.261 --> 02:43:53.200
<v Speaker 4>Like if a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if an education costs like what is um,</v>

3959
02:43:53.560 --> 02:43:58.560
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>per year cost of a very good university </v>

3960
02:43:58.560 --> 02:43:58.560
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3961
02:43:58.560 --> 02:43:58.560
<v Speaker 4>not even like an Ivy League University,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

3962
02:43:58.560 --> 02:43:59.540
<v Speaker 5>probably 20,</v>
<v Speaker 5>$25,000</v>

3963
02:43:59.541 --> 02:44:00.830
<v Speaker 5>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a lot of money</v>

3964
02:44:01.680 --> 02:44:06.680
<v Speaker 4>if you're just giving that to some kid </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they half ass their education and </v>

3965
02:44:06.680 --> 02:44:08.010
<v Speaker 4>they don't get kicked out of school and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's free like,</v>

3966
02:44:08.011 --> 02:44:11.820
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe that's not the best use of money,</v>

3967
02:44:11.821 --> 02:44:15.030
<v Speaker 4>but if someone can demonstrate a real </v>
<v Speaker 4>desire to learn,</v>

3968
02:44:15.690 --> 02:44:20.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and a real desire to achieve and to </v>

3969
02:44:20.690 --> 02:44:23.631
<v Speaker 4>discipline themselves into following </v>
<v Speaker 4>through with the courses and doing the </v>

3970
02:44:23.631 --> 02:44:27.051
<v Speaker 4>work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you maybe then maybe give someone a </v>

3971
02:44:27.051 --> 02:44:30.711
<v Speaker 4>semester for free and proved by their </v>
<v Speaker 4>performance in that semester by their </v>

3972
02:44:31.831 --> 02:44:32.820
<v Speaker 4>effort,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their performance,</v>

3973
02:44:32.821 --> 02:44:34.680
<v Speaker 4>how much work they've done that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

3974
02:44:34.681 --> 02:44:35.520
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3975
02:44:36.150 --> 02:44:41.150
<v Speaker 4>it's very likely that you can get </v>
<v Speaker 4>through four years of this university </v>

3976
02:44:41.150 --> 02:44:45.260
<v Speaker 4>and get out with a bachelor's degree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe even move on and continue your </v>

3977
02:44:45.260 --> 02:44:49.311
<v Speaker 4>education or become a really valuable </v>
<v Speaker 4>member of our society and benefit our </v>

3978
02:44:49.311 --> 02:44:51.570
<v Speaker 4>economy and benefit our.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So our civilization,</v>

3979
02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:56.840
<v Speaker 4>because of what you're learning here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So making an investment in you mean </v>

3980
02:44:56.840 --> 02:45:00.731
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a valuable thing for our </v>

3981
02:45:00.731 --> 02:45:00.731
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3982
02:45:00.731 --> 02:45:04.160
<v Speaker 4>Have more educated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>less ignorant people have less losers,</v>

3983
02:45:04.230 --> 02:45:04.530
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3984
02:45:05.050 --> 02:45:07.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think to me,</v>

3985
02:45:07.580 --> 02:45:12.580
<v Speaker 5>I say this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess we're a pace of place of some </v>

3986
02:45:12.580 --> 02:45:12.580
<v Speaker 5>privileges.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went to college,</v>

3987
02:45:12.580 --> 02:45:13.480
<v Speaker 5>I went to a great college and I'm proud </v>
<v Speaker 5>of that,</v>

3988
02:45:13.481 --> 02:45:15.770
<v Speaker 5>but at the same time I feel like it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

3989
02:45:16.540 --> 02:45:18.880
<v Speaker 5>Why don't we emphasize trade schools </v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore?</v>

3990
02:45:18.910 --> 02:45:21.310
<v Speaker 5>Why don't we emphasize that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to go to college,</v>

3991
02:45:21.311 --> 02:45:22.870
<v Speaker 5>you can be an entrepreneur,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can start a business.</v>

3992
02:45:23.270 --> 02:45:25.030
<v Speaker 5>I feel like it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's often too,</v>

3993
02:45:25.060 --> 02:45:28.690
<v Speaker 5>it's too much focused on like an </v>
<v Speaker 5>academic path and I'm like,</v>

3994
02:45:28.691 --> 02:45:33.691
<v Speaker 5>that's good for some people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I would argue that there's probably </v>

3995
02:45:33.691 --> 02:45:36.660
<v Speaker 5>too many people going to college,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially for things that we were </v>

3996
02:45:36.660 --> 02:45:37.420
<v Speaker 5>talking about earlier on that don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>really do anything for you.</v>

3997
02:45:37.421 --> 02:45:39.550
<v Speaker 5>If you have a chemistry degree or a </v>
<v Speaker 5>physics degree or a math degree,</v>

3998
02:45:39.551 --> 02:45:41.950
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you have a history degree like I did,</v>

3999
02:45:41.951 --> 02:45:43.730
<v Speaker 5>you have to be very lucky like I was or </v>
<v Speaker 5>your.</v>

4000
02:45:43.730 --> 02:45:45.150
<v Speaker 5>You might have some hard times,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4001
02:45:45.220 --> 02:45:47.440
<v Speaker 5>or you find something else to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

4002
02:45:47.500 --> 02:45:52.500
<v Speaker 5>Every benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just from the discipline that you </v>

4003
02:45:52.500 --> 02:45:52.500
<v Speaker 5>learned while you were in school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

4004
02:45:52.500 --> 02:45:52.500
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

4005
02:45:52.500 --> 02:45:55.991
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's proof that you can accomplish </v>

4006
02:45:55.991 --> 02:45:57.571
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I wish that there was more drive to </v>

4007
02:45:57.571 --> 02:45:57.571
<v Speaker 5>say like we need plumbers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we need electricians,</v>

4008
02:45:57.571 --> 02:45:58.670
<v Speaker 5>we need.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know what?</v>

4009
02:45:59.190 --> 02:46:04.190
<v Speaker 5>Two things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of the stupidest people I've ever </v>

4010
02:46:04.190 --> 02:46:06.391
<v Speaker 5>met went to college.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of the smartest people I've ever </v>

4011
02:46:06.391 --> 02:46:08.941
<v Speaker 5>met,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he didn't go to college and some of the </v>

4012
02:46:08.941 --> 02:46:09.070
<v Speaker 5>people that I know that are doing the </v>
<v Speaker 5>best economically are in trades,</v>

4013
02:46:09.110 --> 02:46:10.520
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't have a degree.</v>

4014
02:46:10.521 --> 02:46:11.790
<v Speaker 5>They're electricians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

4015
02:46:11.791 --> 02:46:13.290
<v Speaker 5>they build houses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they do those kinds of things.</v>

4016
02:46:13.310 --> 02:46:14.150
<v Speaker 5>Repair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

4017
02:46:14.151 --> 02:46:16.820
<v Speaker 5>These are essential and these things </v>
<v Speaker 5>aren't going away either.</v>

4018
02:46:16.970 --> 02:46:18.450
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like,</v>

4019
02:46:18.830 --> 02:46:20.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I look at someone like a mechanic,</v>

4020
02:46:20.511 --> 02:46:21.800
<v Speaker 5>I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a plumber or something like that.</v>

4021
02:46:21.800 --> 02:46:22.250
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

4022
02:46:22.251 --> 02:46:25.220
<v Speaker 5>that's really impressive because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>know what the hell you're doing,</v>

4023
02:46:25.340 --> 02:46:26.210
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you,</v>

4024
02:46:26.220 --> 02:46:28.370
<v Speaker 5>you know how to wire this house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4025
02:46:28.371 --> 02:46:29.780
<v Speaker 5>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to lay the plumbing,</v>

4026
02:46:29.781 --> 02:46:30.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how to do all these kinds of things.</v>

4027
02:46:30.891 --> 02:46:33.680
<v Speaker 5>That's a vital service.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so.</v>

4028
02:46:33.681 --> 02:46:38.681
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I feel like there's almost this like </v>

4029
02:46:38.681 --> 02:46:38.681
<v Speaker 5>got to go to college,</v>
<v Speaker 5>got to go to college.</v>

4030
02:46:38.681 --> 02:46:38.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no you don't,</v>

4031
02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:43.920
<v Speaker 5>and and the other thing that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 5>really relevant is that I paid for my </v>

4032
02:46:43.920 --> 02:46:48.101
<v Speaker 5>college and now suddenly and I'm paying </v>
<v Speaker 5>loans out the ass for my college degree </v>

4033
02:46:48.101 --> 02:46:51.860
<v Speaker 5>still and I have to now pay for someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>else's college like and that I,</v>

4034
02:46:51.861 --> 02:46:54.470
<v Speaker 5>I did what I had to do and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>really feel like it's fair that I had to</v>

4035
02:46:54.471 --> 02:46:57.890
<v Speaker 5>owe 60 or $70,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>in loans that I've paid back,</v>

4036
02:46:58.220 --> 02:46:59.840
<v Speaker 5>but someone and then I have to pay </v>
<v Speaker 5>taxes,</v>

4037
02:46:59.870 --> 02:47:02.240
<v Speaker 5>extra taxes for someone else to go to </v>
<v Speaker 5>college as well.</v>

4038
02:47:02.240 --> 02:47:07.240
<v Speaker 5>It kind of frustrates me in specifically</v>
<v Speaker 5>because the only reason college is so </v>

4039
02:47:07.240 --> 02:47:07.880
<v Speaker 5>expensive is because the government is </v>
<v Speaker 5>involved in the loans,</v>

4040
02:47:09.750 --> 02:47:11.270
<v Speaker 5>subsidized loans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyone can get a loan.</v>

4041
02:47:11.470 --> 02:47:16.470
<v Speaker 5>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you in a college and you knew that </v>

4042
02:47:16.470 --> 02:47:16.470
<v Speaker 5>anyone that came to you could just go </v>
<v Speaker 5>get a stafford loan,</v>

4043
02:47:16.470 --> 02:47:17.660
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would jack prices up in two seconds.</v>

4044
02:47:17.690 --> 02:47:22.690
<v Speaker 5>Of course he would make the loans more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a more rare and even raise interest </v>

4045
02:47:23.061 --> 02:47:25.310
<v Speaker 5>rates on those loans and watch what </v>
<v Speaker 5>happens to the cost of college.</v>

4046
02:47:25.430 --> 02:47:28.190
<v Speaker 5>It will plummet because they can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>justify the cost anymore.</v>

4047
02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:30.680
<v Speaker 5>The government made this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now the government's trying to,</v>

4048
02:47:30.890 --> 02:47:35.890
<v Speaker 5>and this is what I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the government's not trying to solve a </v>

4049
02:47:35.890 --> 02:47:35.890
<v Speaker 5>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It Matt,</v>

4050
02:47:35.890 --> 02:47:36.050
<v Speaker 5>it totally manufactured on its own.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When did that all begin?</v>

4051
02:47:36.470 --> 02:47:37.220
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I,</v>

4052
02:47:37.221 --> 02:47:42.221
<v Speaker 5>I don't know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think in the seventies it began and </v>

4053
02:47:42.221 --> 02:47:42.221
<v Speaker 5>then I think it really got out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>control in the nineties,</v>

4054
02:47:42.221 --> 02:47:46.960
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I went to northeastern and my </v>

4055
02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:47.300
<v Speaker 5>mom actually worked there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I didn't even pay tuition.</v>

4056
02:47:47.300 --> 02:47:50.840
<v Speaker 5>I only paid room and board tuition in </v>
<v Speaker 5>northeastern is like $45,000</v>

4057
02:47:50.841 --> 02:47:55.841
<v Speaker 5>or something a year now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know people that went to college that </v>

4058
02:47:55.841 --> 02:47:55.841
<v Speaker 5>had to pay out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have those loans strapped to.</v>

4059
02:47:55.841 --> 02:47:57.540
<v Speaker 5>They have two kids in college.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

4060
02:47:57.541 --> 02:47:58.410
<v Speaker 5>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

4061
02:47:58.750 --> 02:47:59.830
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Dude,</v>

4062
02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:00.980
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what I was,</v>

4063
02:48:00.981 --> 02:48:02.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're 17 or 18 years old,</v>

4064
02:48:02.901 --> 02:48:04.870
<v Speaker 5>I remember my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my dad's,</v>

4065
02:48:05.220 --> 02:48:06.380
<v Speaker 5>my dad's in New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 5>firefighter.</v>

4066
02:48:06.381 --> 02:48:07.790
<v Speaker 5>Very serious guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

4067
02:48:07.970 --> 02:48:09.230
<v Speaker 5>And I remember him sitting down and </v>
<v Speaker 5>being like,</v>

4068
02:48:09.260 --> 02:48:11.800
<v Speaker 5>I'm taking these loans out for you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm coast signing on them and,</v>

4069
02:48:11.801 --> 02:48:13.340
<v Speaker 5>and him kind of looking at me in the eye</v>
<v Speaker 5>and be like,</v>

4070
02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:16.670
<v Speaker 5>you will not default on these loans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4071
02:48:16.671 --> 02:48:18.760
<v Speaker 5>like he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know you don't understand it.</v>

4072
02:48:19.370 --> 02:48:20.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like being like,</v>

4073
02:48:20.330 --> 02:48:21.750
<v Speaker 5>because you're 17 or 18 years old being </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4074
02:48:21.751 --> 02:48:23.720
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember what the fuck is going,</v>

4075
02:48:23.721 --> 02:48:24.740
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to college,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to,</v>

4076
02:48:24.741 --> 02:48:25.470
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going,</v>

4077
02:48:25.480 --> 02:48:26.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do whatever I'm going to do.</v>

4078
02:48:26.450 --> 02:48:31.450
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We really got to control what is the </v>

4079
02:48:31.450 --> 02:48:32.090
<v Speaker 5>ADC.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like in the mid,</v>

4080
02:48:32.150 --> 02:48:33.710
<v Speaker 5>early to mid eighties is when it got out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of control.</v>

4081
02:48:33.890 --> 02:48:38.390
<v Speaker 5>And then in the nineties the separation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now look it goes to 2009,</v>

4082
02:48:38.391 --> 02:48:41.080
<v Speaker 5>but in 2009 it's just through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking roof.</v>

4083
02:48:41.150 --> 02:48:46.150
<v Speaker 5>It's just so the government,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the government did this and now they're </v>

4084
02:48:46.150 --> 02:48:48.821
<v Speaker 5>trying to solve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now Bernie Sanders is running around </v>

4085
02:48:48.821 --> 02:48:48.821
<v Speaker 5>trying to solve the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

4086
02:48:48.821 --> 02:48:50.510
<v Speaker 5>and speaking of age and stuff like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Democrat,</v>

4087
02:48:50.550 --> 02:48:52.010
<v Speaker 5>he's absolutely going to try to run </v>
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>

4088
02:48:52.160 --> 02:48:53.060
<v Speaker 5>And we're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think so,</v>

4089
02:48:53.061 --> 02:48:55.250
<v Speaker 5>so old and he'll be 80.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His,</v>

4090
02:48:55.280 --> 02:48:57.140
<v Speaker 5>his head is leaning forward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

4091
02:48:57.141 --> 02:48:58.760
<v Speaker 5>someone's got to teach them to stand up </v>
<v Speaker 5>straight.</v>

4092
02:48:59.000 --> 02:48:59.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got,</v>

4093
02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:01.840
<v Speaker 5>he's just got that bookish Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4094
02:49:01.850 --> 02:49:06.850
<v Speaker 5>he's got this thing going on where his </v>
<v Speaker 5>head is like slowly making its way down </v>

4095
02:49:06.850 --> 02:49:07.590
<v Speaker 5>to his sternum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4096
02:49:07.820 --> 02:49:07.970
<v Speaker 5>he's</v>

4097
02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:10.680
<v Speaker 2>collapsing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Bernie.</v>

4098
02:49:10.681 --> 02:49:13.140
<v Speaker 2>This is really bad for you though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

4099
02:49:13.141 --> 02:49:16.190
<v Speaker 2>That's my look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would have one.</v>

4100
02:49:16.450 --> 02:49:19.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if he went up against trump,</v>

4101
02:49:19.500 --> 02:49:21.150
<v Speaker 2>I think he would have done much better </v>
<v Speaker 2>than Hillary.</v>

4102
02:49:21.180 --> 02:49:23.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a brand of populism that would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been.</v>

4103
02:49:23.161 --> 02:49:25.810
<v Speaker 2>So I think something like 10 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that voted for him in the primary</v>

4104
02:49:25.811 --> 02:49:30.811
<v Speaker 2>voted for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a compelling number that </v>

4105
02:49:30.811 --> 02:49:30.811
<v Speaker 2>suggests what you say is right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my whole,</v>

4106
02:49:30.811 --> 02:49:34.370
<v Speaker 2>the x factor in this is the oppo </v>
<v Speaker 2>research and you got a little bit of </v>

4107
02:49:34.370 --> 02:49:34.370
<v Speaker 2>taste of what research is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oppo,</v>

4108
02:49:34.370 --> 02:49:39.111
<v Speaker 2>oppo opposition research that they never</v>
<v Speaker 2>used on Bernie Sanders because they </v>

4109
02:49:39.111 --> 02:49:41.811
<v Speaker 2>didn't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Republicans have all sorts of </v>

4110
02:49:41.811 --> 02:49:41.811
<v Speaker 2>stuff on him and it's not even he went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4111
02:49:41.811 --> 02:49:43.620
<v Speaker 2>like little things that resonate with </v>
<v Speaker 2>older people.</v>

4112
02:49:43.621 --> 02:49:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like they went,</v>

4113
02:49:44.701 --> 02:49:47.670
<v Speaker 2>him and Jane Sanders went on their </v>
<v Speaker 2>honeymoon to the Soviet Union.</v>

4114
02:49:48.300 --> 02:49:49.070
<v Speaker 2>That's really weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4115
02:49:49.130 --> 02:49:54.130
<v Speaker 2>Fucking Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that are 20 or 25 don't care </v>

4116
02:49:54.130 --> 02:49:54.130
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that are 40,</v>

4117
02:49:54.130 --> 02:49:54.130
<v Speaker 2>45,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 care a lot about that,</v>

4118
02:49:54.130 --> 02:49:54.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4119
02:49:54.220 --> 02:49:59.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went to a communist country to explore </v>

4120
02:49:59.220 --> 02:49:59.370
<v Speaker 2>the great benefits of the fucking red </v>
<v Speaker 2>flag,</v>

4121
02:49:59.650 --> 02:50:04.650
<v Speaker 2>which of which there are none,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like Lee Harvey Oswald cool domes </v>

4122
02:50:04.741 --> 02:50:06.360
<v Speaker 2>in their building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very unique building.</v>

4123
02:50:06.361 --> 02:50:07.450
<v Speaker 2>Good architecture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4124
02:50:07.620 --> 02:50:09.090
<v Speaker 2>I keep asking people though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because everyone,</v>

4125
02:50:09.091 --> 02:50:14.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have these crazy people on </v>

4126
02:50:14.091 --> 02:50:15.500
<v Speaker 2>twitter and stuff that have the hammer </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sickle and their names and stuff </v>

4127
02:50:15.500 --> 02:50:15.500
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

4128
02:50:15.500 --> 02:50:16.060
<v Speaker 2>can anyone tell me one thing that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union gave us?</v>

4129
02:50:16.070 --> 02:50:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Like gave the world one thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone that anyone cares about.</v>

4130
02:50:20.070 --> 02:50:21.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's Russian.</v>

4131
02:50:21.541 --> 02:50:22.390
<v Speaker 2>That's not even Soviet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4132
02:50:22.400 --> 02:50:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Like tetris came from the Soviet Union </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the game.</v>

4133
02:50:25.351 --> 02:50:26.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be the most important thing.</v>

4134
02:50:26.960 --> 02:50:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn game communism is so morally </v>

4135
02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:31.960
<v Speaker 2>and intellectually bankrupt.</v>

4136
02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:34.140
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible to me that anyone would </v>
<v Speaker 2>even argue it.</v>

4137
02:50:34.460 --> 02:50:37.020
<v Speaker 2>It's just as morally and intellectually </v>
<v Speaker 2>bankrupt as the far right,</v>

4138
02:50:37.070 --> 02:50:42.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems to be the thing that people </v>

4139
02:50:42.070 --> 02:50:43.971
<v Speaker 2>go to when they look at some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>viable alternative without looking into </v>

4140
02:50:43.971 --> 02:50:44.730
<v Speaker 2>a deeply Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4141
02:50:45.060 --> 02:50:50.060
<v Speaker 2>and that this idea of socialism is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a good thing because everybody's </v>

4142
02:50:50.060 --> 02:50:51.180
<v Speaker 2>going to contribute and capitalism is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong with the world.</v>

4143
02:50:51.181 --> 02:50:52.830
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

4144
02:50:52.890 --> 02:50:54.330
<v Speaker 2>and whenever people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

4145
02:50:54.460 --> 02:50:56.640
<v Speaker 2>they always like to hit up this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing of,</v>

4146
02:50:56.670 --> 02:50:57.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4147
02:50:58.540 --> 02:51:00.810
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the economic inequality,</v>

4148
02:51:00.930 --> 02:51:04.140
<v Speaker 2>economic inequality and inequality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>income,</v>

4149
02:51:04.141 --> 02:51:09.141
<v Speaker 2>inequality of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what people don't seem to get is </v>

4150
02:51:09.301 --> 02:51:14.301
<v Speaker 2>that when you have true freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're absolutely going to have </v>

4151
02:51:14.301 --> 02:51:17.511
<v Speaker 2>inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you have the true freedom to </v>

4152
02:51:17.511 --> 02:51:19.851
<v Speaker 2>do whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people aren't going to do much and </v>

4153
02:51:19.851 --> 02:51:23.841
<v Speaker 2>some people are going to do a lot is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be some Jeff Bezos types </v>

4154
02:51:23.841 --> 02:51:27.111
<v Speaker 2>characters out there who just want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking go gangbusters and own half the </v>

4155
02:51:27.111 --> 02:51:27.111
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

4156
02:51:27.111 --> 02:51:31.760
<v Speaker 2>And then there's going to be people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would really rather just work a little </v>

4157
02:51:31.760 --> 02:51:36.141
<v Speaker 2>bit and then go play fucking disc golf </v>
<v Speaker 2>and smoke pot and listen to records and </v>

4158
02:51:36.391 --> 02:51:41.391
<v Speaker 2>hang out with their friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they'd be very happy if they just </v>

4159
02:51:41.391 --> 02:51:42.270
<v Speaker 2>made an income that was sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

4160
02:51:42.310 --> 02:51:45.570
<v Speaker 2>there's a host of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>personalities.</v>

4161
02:51:45.720 --> 02:51:49.290
<v Speaker 2>There's some people that really enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing art and they liked to go down to a</v>

4162
02:51:49.291 --> 02:51:52.620
<v Speaker 2>fucking farmer's market and set up shop </v>
<v Speaker 2>and sell their artwork.</v>

4163
02:51:52.890 --> 02:51:54.340
<v Speaker 2>And that's fine for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

4164
02:51:54.341 --> 02:51:57.180
<v Speaker 2>that's what they want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they want to live their life.</v>

4165
02:51:57.181 --> 02:52:00.750
<v Speaker 2>And maybe their dad was a fucking doctor</v>
<v Speaker 2>who died at 55 of a heart attack because</v>

4166
02:52:00.751 --> 02:52:02.670
<v Speaker 2>he was working too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you know,</v>

4167
02:52:02.790 --> 02:52:05.980
<v Speaker 2>who knows what it is that causes someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the ambition or</v>

4168
02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:09.610
<v Speaker 4>the desires that they have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you have true freedom to pursue</v>

4169
02:52:09.611 --> 02:52:12.670
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that literally breeds inequality.</v>

4170
02:52:12.940 --> 02:52:15.850
<v Speaker 4>Because there are going to be people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that decide to do more.</v>

4171
02:52:16.390 --> 02:52:18.700
<v Speaker 4>And there's going to be people in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a,</v>

4172
02:52:18.760 --> 02:52:23.760
<v Speaker 4>an egalitarian version of this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether these people are altruistic in </v>

4173
02:52:23.760 --> 02:52:25.030
<v Speaker 4>their approach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether they're,</v>

4174
02:52:25.031 --> 02:52:25.530
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4175
02:52:25.531 --> 02:52:25.890
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4176
02:52:25.891 --> 02:52:30.891
<v Speaker 4>they donate an incredible amount to </v>
<v Speaker 4>charity or whether or not they keep it </v>

4177
02:52:30.891 --> 02:52:34.471
<v Speaker 4>all to themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have real freedom like that </v>

4178
02:52:34.471 --> 02:52:38.161
<v Speaker 4>doesn't say you have to donate x amount </v>
<v Speaker 4>of your money to this and y amount of </v>

4179
02:52:38.161 --> 02:52:40.390
<v Speaker 4>your money to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you just give people freedom,</v>

4180
02:52:40.990 --> 02:52:45.430
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have any quality because</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are in equal in their efforts.</v>

4181
02:52:45.490 --> 02:52:48.280
<v Speaker 4>They're equal in their desires,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their equal in their focus.</v>

4182
02:52:48.420 --> 02:52:53.420
<v Speaker 4>They're equal in their discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are and there are equal in their </v>

4183
02:52:53.420 --> 02:52:53.420
<v Speaker 4>capabilities.</v>

4184
02:52:53.420 --> 02:52:53.420
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4185
02:52:53.420 --> 02:52:58.230
<v Speaker 4>that's the major thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a big one that people don't want </v>

4186
02:52:58.230 --> 02:52:58.230
<v Speaker 4>to talk about anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I often,</v>

4187
02:52:58.230 --> 02:52:58.230
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I asked.</v>

4188
02:52:58.540 --> 02:53:03.540
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of a rough thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've had conversations with people </v>

4189
02:53:03.540 --> 02:53:03.540
<v Speaker 4>where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when did people stop saying like,</v>

4190
02:53:03.540 --> 02:53:03.730
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kid is just dumb.</v>

4191
02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:10.000
<v Speaker 4>Like like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I remember even growing up in the </v>

4192
02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:10.000
<v Speaker 4>eighties and early nineties where like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like some dms guild,</v>

4193
02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:11.660
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing wrong with them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4194
02:53:11.870 --> 02:53:13.330
<v Speaker 4>they don't have a disability or anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

4195
02:53:13.331 --> 02:53:15.700
<v Speaker 4>but it's just like this kid doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>really have the capability of going,</v>

4196
02:53:15.750 --> 02:53:20.750
<v Speaker 4>he's going to do something else with his</v>
<v Speaker 4>life now it's like everyone can do </v>

4197
02:53:20.750 --> 02:53:20.750
<v Speaker 4>anything at any given time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

4198
02:53:20.750 --> 02:53:20.750
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you work,</v>

4199
02:53:20.750 --> 02:53:22.960
<v Speaker 4>you have some innate quality to you but </v>
<v Speaker 4>your work,</v>

4200
02:53:22.961 --> 02:53:23.810
<v Speaker 4>you study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

4201
02:53:23.870 --> 02:53:25.570
<v Speaker 4>you toil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do those kinds of things.</v>

4202
02:53:25.571 --> 02:53:28.630
<v Speaker 4>Not Everything is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is delivered on a platter to everyone.</v>

4203
02:53:28.660 --> 02:53:30.400
<v Speaker 4>And I re,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I almost resent that,</v>

4204
02:53:30.460 --> 02:53:35.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because some people really work very </v>

4205
02:53:35.460 --> 02:53:35.460
<v Speaker 4>hard and some people don't work hard at </v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

4206
02:53:35.460 --> 02:53:36.280
<v Speaker 4>And then like you're saying the outcome </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be equal.</v>

4207
02:53:36.430 --> 02:53:38.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is some people that are tall,</v>

4208
02:53:38.621 --> 02:53:43.621
<v Speaker 4>there's some people that are short and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some people that have brains </v>

4209
02:53:43.621 --> 02:53:44.740
<v Speaker 4>that are made at a dog shit and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>not much you can do about that.</v>

4210
02:53:44.770 --> 02:53:47.800
<v Speaker 4>There is absolutely a broad spectrum of </v>
<v Speaker 4>human intelligence,</v>

4211
02:53:47.950 --> 02:53:52.330
<v Speaker 4>of awareness and you know how much of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is the environment they grew up in,</v>

4212
02:53:52.331 --> 02:53:55.020
<v Speaker 4>how much of that is their education,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much of that is there a Bra?</v>

4213
02:53:55.021 --> 02:53:56.530
<v Speaker 4>Genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows,</v>

4214
02:53:56.620 --> 02:53:58.750
<v Speaker 4>and there's environmental factors that </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck people up,</v>

4215
02:53:58.751 --> 02:53:59.340
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this.</v>

4216
02:53:59.341 --> 02:54:04.341
<v Speaker 4>This is real arguments that are living </v>
<v Speaker 4>around toxic waste is very damaging to </v>

4217
02:54:04.341 --> 02:54:04.341
<v Speaker 4>your Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know there's,</v>

4218
02:54:04.341 --> 02:54:08.080
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot going on with human beings</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's not fair,</v>

4219
02:54:08.081 --> 02:54:10.300
<v Speaker 4>but here when you play cards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4220
02:54:10.301 --> 02:54:14.140
<v Speaker 4>if you hit four aces and I get one too </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a bunch of fucking random numbers,</v>

4221
02:54:14.141 --> 02:54:19.141
<v Speaker 4>that's not fair either,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have to figure out a way to win </v>

4222
02:54:19.141 --> 02:54:19.141
<v Speaker 4>with this hand.</v>

4223
02:54:19.141 --> 02:54:23.070
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or get by and if it truly is a </v>

4224
02:54:23.070 --> 02:54:25.930
<v Speaker 4>competition and you got a shitty hand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to do your best,</v>

4225
02:54:26.020 --> 02:54:28.000
<v Speaker 4>do your best with the hand you got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4226
02:54:28.001 --> 02:54:30.880
<v Speaker 4>if you are a dwarf and you want to be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>basketball player,</v>

4227
02:54:31.120 --> 02:54:33.370
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have to let that go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't do that.</v>

4228
02:54:33.490 --> 02:54:35.500
<v Speaker 4>You know what else you can't do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't fly.</v>

4229
02:54:35.560 --> 02:54:38.230
<v Speaker 4>You can't breathe under water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't see through walls,</v>

4230
02:54:38.410 --> 02:54:39.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't run a million miles an hour.</v>

4231
02:54:39.971 --> 02:54:41.770
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those were the things you can't do,</v>

4232
02:54:42.280 --> 02:54:47.280
<v Speaker 4>so let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's figure out what you can do and </v>

4233
02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:47.380
<v Speaker 4>find something that you can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>passionate about.</v>

4234
02:54:47.850 --> 02:54:50.080
<v Speaker 4>And I think capitalism as an economic </v>
<v Speaker 4>system,</v>

4235
02:54:50.081 --> 02:54:52.240
<v Speaker 4>the only one that I ca that accommodates</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right.</v>

4236
02:54:52.241 --> 02:54:54.050
<v Speaker 4>And I exactly it it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4237
02:54:54.080 --> 02:54:59.080
<v Speaker 4>it's such a trite thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like it's the least imperfect </v>

4238
02:54:59.080 --> 02:54:59.080
<v Speaker 4>of all the systems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4239
02:54:59.080 --> 02:55:01.330
<v Speaker 4>Like there's nothing positive about </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like communism.</v>

4240
02:55:01.331 --> 02:55:06.331
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think like whenever I see that hammer </v>

4241
02:55:06.331 --> 02:55:06.331
<v Speaker 4>and sickle</v>

4242
02:55:06.331 --> 02:55:06.470
<v Speaker 5>and I don't mean to be mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whenever I see that hammer and sickle on</v>

4243
02:55:06.471 --> 02:55:07.130
<v Speaker 5>a person's name,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

4244
02:55:07.131 --> 02:55:08.630
<v Speaker 5>I'm not really dealing with someone with</v>
<v Speaker 5>a full deck.</v>

4245
02:55:08.631 --> 02:55:09.170
<v Speaker 5>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

4246
02:55:09.171 --> 02:55:14.171
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how you can possibly like </v>
<v Speaker 5>read Marx and do all these kinds of </v>

4247
02:55:14.171 --> 02:55:14.171
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jumped deep into history.</v>

4248
02:55:14.171 --> 02:55:15.020
<v Speaker 5>Look at the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at North Korea,</v>

4249
02:55:15.021 --> 02:55:20.021
<v Speaker 5>look at Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at all of the failure that's </v>

4250
02:55:20.021 --> 02:55:22.391
<v Speaker 5>happening all around you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then look at the fact that everyone is </v>

4251
02:55:22.391 --> 02:55:22.550
<v Speaker 5>benefiting from capitalism in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just doing it wrong,</v>

4252
02:55:22.640 --> 02:55:25.190
<v Speaker 5>yet it's not real communism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not real socialism.</v>

4253
02:55:25.250 --> 02:55:26.480
<v Speaker 5>That's always this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was the answer.</v>

4254
02:55:26.870 --> 02:55:31.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean real capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The worst aspects of capitalism are </v>

4255
02:55:31.870 --> 02:55:35.960
<v Speaker 4>diminishing appreciation for the human </v>
<v Speaker 4>being and the fact that money is power </v>

4256
02:55:36.711 --> 02:55:41.711
<v Speaker 4>over everything and that people just </v>
<v Speaker 4>acquire material goods and all those </v>

4257
02:55:41.711 --> 02:55:45.791
<v Speaker 4>things are true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're true at the farthest end of </v>

4258
02:55:45.791 --> 02:55:47.630
<v Speaker 4>the spectrum of good to bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4259
02:55:47.810 --> 02:55:52.810
<v Speaker 4>The furthest end of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is the damage that capitalism can </v>

4260
02:55:52.810 --> 02:55:55.391
<v Speaker 4>do well can you can devalue human life </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the point where money becomes more </v>

4261
02:55:55.391 --> 02:56:00.151
<v Speaker 4>and more powerful than anything and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people can consolidate this money and </v>

4262
02:56:00.151 --> 02:56:04.181
<v Speaker 4>build these all girl family structures </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know there's a lot of issues </v>

4263
02:56:04.220 --> 02:56:09.220
<v Speaker 4>that can happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that can happen with anything where </v>

4264
02:56:09.220 --> 02:56:09.770
<v Speaker 4>people have leverage and power over </v>
<v Speaker 4>other people.</v>

4265
02:56:09.820 --> 02:56:12.050
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't necessarily mean they have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>happen that way.</v>

4266
02:56:12.320 --> 02:56:15.080
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's got to be some evidence and some</v>

4267
02:56:15.110 --> 02:56:17.360
<v Speaker 4>instances,</v>
<v Speaker 4>instances of altruistic.</v>

4268
02:56:17.430 --> 02:56:18.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm a capitalist.</v>

4269
02:56:18.530 --> 02:56:20.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bill Gates for instance.</v>

4270
02:56:20.660 --> 02:56:23.120
<v Speaker 4>That guy does a lot of really good </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

4271
02:56:23.270 --> 02:56:24.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and his,</v>

4272
02:56:24.050 --> 02:56:27.620
<v Speaker 4>the Bill Gates Foundation and that he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has started up,</v>

4273
02:56:27.950 --> 02:56:28.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God damn,</v>

4274
02:56:28.761 --> 02:56:32.240
<v Speaker 4>he's donated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A shitload of money will go to charity.</v>

4275
02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:34.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a good example.</v>

4276
02:56:34.401 --> 02:56:36.740
<v Speaker 4>Another good example is Warren Buffet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Warren Buffet has,</v>

4277
02:56:36.830 --> 02:56:41.830
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>donating almost all of his money to </v>

4278
02:56:41.830 --> 02:56:41.830
<v Speaker 4>charities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4279
02:56:41.830 --> 02:56:44.000
<v Speaker 4>and these are guys that are wildly </v>
<v Speaker 4>successful.</v>

4280
02:56:44.150 --> 02:56:49.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're talking billions and </v>
<v Speaker 4>billions of dollars in wealth attained </v>

4281
02:56:49.150 --> 02:56:50.600
<v Speaker 4>entirely through capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It like,</v>

4282
02:56:50.601 --> 02:56:54.830
<v Speaker 4>so you have your bad examples,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you also have good examples.</v>

4283
02:56:55.010 --> 02:56:56.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what Bill Gates has done,</v>

4284
02:56:56.901 --> 02:57:00.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean really incredibly impressive when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you stop and think about it,</v>

4285
02:57:00.330 --> 02:57:01.810
<v Speaker 5>get the bill and Melinda Gates </v>
<v Speaker 5>Foundation,</v>

4286
02:57:01.811 --> 02:57:03.820
<v Speaker 5>wherever they call it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is like super influential.</v>

4287
02:57:04.030 --> 02:57:05.180
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4288
02:57:05.300 --> 02:57:10.300
<v Speaker 5>I look at it in the sense of yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are negatives about all of these </v>

4289
02:57:10.300 --> 02:57:11.260
<v Speaker 5>things like you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I also feel like,</v>

4290
02:57:11.530 --> 02:57:14.980
<v Speaker 5>are you eating today in half the world?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because that's because of capitalism.</v>

4291
02:57:14.981 --> 02:57:15.690
<v Speaker 5>Are you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4292
02:57:15.691 --> 02:57:17.780
<v Speaker 5>like capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the industrial revolution that,</v>

4293
02:57:17.800 --> 02:57:22.800
<v Speaker 5>that got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that got everything going in the last </v>

4294
02:57:22.800 --> 02:57:22.800
<v Speaker 5>150 years is all because of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>necessity of,</v>

4295
02:57:22.800 --> 02:57:25.240
<v Speaker 5>of the chase of the dollar or the pound </v>
<v Speaker 5>or whatever the case might be.</v>

4296
02:57:25.660 --> 02:57:29.410
<v Speaker 5>Like the chase for money is not in </v>
<v Speaker 5>itself a negative thing.</v>

4297
02:57:29.530 --> 02:57:31.150
<v Speaker 5>It's what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you do with it.</v>

4298
02:57:31.360 --> 02:57:33.940
<v Speaker 5>And the ramifications of what we get </v>
<v Speaker 5>because of money,</v>

4299
02:57:33.970 --> 02:57:35.110
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is an amazing thing.</v>

4300
02:57:35.111 --> 02:57:37.850
<v Speaker 5>I often talk about whether it's good or </v>
<v Speaker 5>bad is,</v>

4301
02:57:37.890 --> 02:57:39.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when apple one,</v>

4302
02:57:39.281 --> 02:57:42.340
<v Speaker 5>the apple one computer was being made in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the mid seventies,</v>

4303
02:57:42.830 --> 02:57:47.830
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs used to go </v>

4304
02:57:47.830 --> 02:57:47.830
<v Speaker 5>to this thing called homebrew Computer </v>
<v Speaker 5>Club in Berkeley.</v>

4305
02:57:47.830 --> 02:57:52.230
<v Speaker 5>And people would go there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was this real spirit in the </v>

4306
02:57:52.230 --> 02:57:52.240
<v Speaker 5>seventies amongst tinkerers that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>would share their stuff with each other,</v>

4307
02:57:52.241 --> 02:57:53.710
<v Speaker 5>that they would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is how I did this.</v>

4308
02:57:53.711 --> 02:57:56.200
<v Speaker 5>This is how I programmed this very </v>
<v Speaker 5>rudimentary punch card machine.</v>

4309
02:57:56.201 --> 02:58:01.201
<v Speaker 5>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they were going with apple one to </v>

4310
02:58:01.201 --> 02:58:02.040
<v Speaker 5>this thing and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wazniak had really</v>

4311
02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:07.040
<v Speaker 3>wanted to give it away to be like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolutionary computer that we are </v>

4312
02:58:07.040 --> 02:58:11.091
<v Speaker 3>sitting on here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just going to give you the tools </v>

4313
02:58:11.091 --> 02:58:11.091
<v Speaker 3>to make your own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve jobs was the one that said like,</v>

4314
02:58:11.091 --> 02:58:15.830
<v Speaker 3>we have something here that can become </v>
<v Speaker 3>more ubiquitous if we make it into a </v>

4315
02:58:15.830 --> 02:58:18.450
<v Speaker 3>product that we sell as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that stays within the confines</v>

4316
02:58:18.780 --> 02:58:21.540
<v Speaker 3>of the Berkeley homebrew computer club </v>
<v Speaker 3>were at 15.</v>

4317
02:58:21.541 --> 02:58:23.640
<v Speaker 3>People will enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can mark it this bad boy.</v>

4318
02:58:24.030 --> 02:58:27.870
<v Speaker 3>And so it takes sometimes a person who </v>
<v Speaker 3>has the most number,</v>

4319
02:58:27.871 --> 02:58:32.871
<v Speaker 3>it costs $766 and 66,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four K of Ram ram rather.</v>

4320
02:58:33.691 --> 02:58:35.640
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

4321
02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:41.000
<v Speaker 3>So you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it takes some times for things to </v>

4322
02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:41.000
<v Speaker 3>proliferate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes for things to do good,</v>

4323
02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:45.230
<v Speaker 3>there has to be a profit motive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you need a steve jobs who </v>

4324
02:58:45.230 --> 02:58:45.230
<v Speaker 3>didn't have the intellect.</v>

4325
02:58:45.230 --> 02:58:46.380
<v Speaker 3>That was me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had on a programming perspective,</v>

4326
02:58:46.530 --> 02:58:48.990
<v Speaker 3>but saw products for what they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went into Xerox,</v>

4327
02:58:49.050 --> 02:58:50.700
<v Speaker 3>saw the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw the mouse,</v>

4328
02:58:50.850 --> 02:58:55.850
<v Speaker 3>saw the ethernet cable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knew what to do with these different </v>

4329
02:58:55.850 --> 02:58:55.850
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the beauty of capitalism to me.</v>

4330
02:58:55.850 --> 02:59:00.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one incentive for him to pursue </v>

4331
02:59:00.410 --> 02:59:00.410
<v Speaker 3>these goals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

4332
02:59:00.410 --> 02:59:00.410
<v Speaker 3>and we all benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at,</v>

4333
02:59:00.410 --> 02:59:02.940
<v Speaker 3>look at our smart phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ten years ago that we'd had no idea what</v>

4334
02:59:02.941 --> 02:59:04.800
<v Speaker 3>these things are going to become and </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at the economy.</v>

4335
02:59:04.801 --> 02:59:09.801
<v Speaker 3>They opened up 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were psyched if your phone flipped </v>

4336
02:59:09.801 --> 02:59:09.801
<v Speaker 3>open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4337
02:59:09.801 --> 02:59:10.650
<v Speaker 3>it was all he could do that thing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the risk where had opened without you.</v>

4338
02:59:10.730 --> 02:59:12.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kirk out slap it shut.</v>

4339
02:59:12.660 --> 02:59:14.250
<v Speaker 9>Do you remember the matrix phone when it</v>
<v Speaker 9>came out?</v>

4340
02:59:14.251 --> 02:59:18.000
<v Speaker 9>Like it shot open and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>no one could ever get one and now I feel</v>

4341
02:59:18.001 --> 02:59:19.920
<v Speaker 9>like a lot of people one on one.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Do you remember that at all?</v>

4342
02:59:19.950 --> 02:59:21.960
<v Speaker 9>What's the major phone that when the </v>
<v Speaker 9>matrix came out,</v>

4343
02:59:21.961 --> 02:59:23.250
<v Speaker 9>the first,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the first one,</v>

4344
02:59:23.400 --> 02:59:27.070
<v Speaker 9>they all had a cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It was made by Sony and the bottom of it</v>

4345
02:59:27.071 --> 02:59:28.520
<v Speaker 9>shot out.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Instead of flipping open,</v>

4346
02:59:28.530 --> 02:59:33.530
<v Speaker 9>you like hit a little button and it's </v>
<v Speaker 9>like he jumped down and it never was </v>

4347
02:59:33.530 --> 02:59:34.020
<v Speaker 9>released for like a consumer.</v>

4348
02:59:35.210 --> 02:59:37.010
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Capitalism wasn't already late.</v>

4349
02:59:37.011 --> 02:59:42.011
<v Speaker 3>Capitalism wasn't ready for that phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders were released for free </v>

4350
02:59:42.011 --> 02:59:45.680
<v Speaker 3>for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's in unique character because</v>

4351
02:59:45.681 --> 02:59:47.720
<v Speaker 3>he's an antiestablishment character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's interesting.</v>

4352
02:59:47.750 --> 02:59:52.750
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that goes back to the point you were </v>

4353
02:59:52.750 --> 02:59:53.771
<v Speaker 3>making.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why he came up is because you </v>

4354
02:59:53.771 --> 02:59:53.780
<v Speaker 3>said he could maybe be trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the shared populous message here</v>

4355
02:59:53.781 --> 02:59:53.960
<v Speaker 3>it is</v>

4356
02:59:55.030 --> 02:59:57.160
<v Speaker 9>version of it might've finally came out </v>
<v Speaker 9>I guess,</v>

4357
02:59:57.190 --> 02:59:57.610
<v Speaker 9>but um,</v>

4358
02:59:57.710 --> 03:00:01.730
<v Speaker 3>how does it work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm confused that this shot out and it's</v>

4359
03:00:01.731 --> 03:00:03.670
<v Speaker 3>just covered up the thing instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>flipping open.</v>

4360
03:00:03.790 --> 03:00:08.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you press a button and it </v>

4361
03:00:08.790 --> 03:00:08.790
<v Speaker 3>slides down.</v>

4362
03:00:08.790 --> 03:00:08.790
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean that's when they were running and</v>

4363
03:00:08.790 --> 03:00:09.820
<v Speaker 9>like trinity was running shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 9>just do it.</v>

4364
03:00:09.821 --> 03:00:10.890
<v Speaker 9>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we need an operator.</v>

4365
03:00:11.070 --> 03:00:12.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's hilarious.</v>

4366
03:00:12.300 --> 03:00:14.820
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it crazy that we thought that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>the shit?</v>

4367
03:00:15.270 --> 03:00:17.280
<v Speaker 3>It's not even that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's so funny about it,</v>

4368
03:00:17.310 --> 03:00:18.400
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4369
03:00:18.420 --> 03:00:23.420
<v Speaker 3>I had a blackberry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a wizard for super </v>

4370
03:00:23.491 --> 03:00:25.500
<v Speaker 3>technological too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a blackberry.</v>

4371
03:00:25.650 --> 03:00:28.020
<v Speaker 3>Is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It slides open spiral.</v>

4372
03:00:28.021 --> 03:00:30.180
<v Speaker 3>It has a screen and the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that funny?</v>

4373
03:00:30.181 --> 03:00:32.130
<v Speaker 3>They never thought you would ever be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to type on a screen.</v>

4374
03:00:32.131 --> 03:00:34.650
<v Speaker 3>Like that's just ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get the fuck out of here with that.</v>

4375
03:00:34.651 --> 03:00:35.640
<v Speaker 3>You need buttons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4376
03:00:36.390 --> 03:00:39.060
<v Speaker 3>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them bitches.</v>

4377
03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:41.970
<v Speaker 3>I had one of those with the keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that thing.</v>

4378
03:00:42.270 --> 03:00:44.850
<v Speaker 3>It's great and send emails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never did,</v>

4379
03:00:44.851 --> 03:00:45.780
<v Speaker 3>but you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you could.</v>

4380
03:00:46.210 --> 03:00:46.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could.</v>

4381
03:00:46.800 --> 03:00:49.050
<v Speaker 3>If you wanted to send half my emails on </v>
<v Speaker 3>my phone.</v>

4382
03:00:49.051 --> 03:00:54.051
<v Speaker 3>Now I think about like I love thinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the iphone and the smartphone </v>

4383
03:00:54.601 --> 03:00:59.601
<v Speaker 3>revolution and then all of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>businesses that are totally based on </v>

4384
03:00:59.601 --> 03:00:59.880
<v Speaker 3>that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that uber or</v>

4385
03:01:00.170 --> 03:01:05.170
<v Speaker 4>a Lyft,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of these companies that only exist </v>

4386
03:01:05.170 --> 03:01:07.471
<v Speaker 4>because that product existed only </v>
<v Speaker 4>because someone saw the capital </v>

4387
03:01:07.471 --> 03:01:10.291
<v Speaker 4>investment necessary to proliferate this</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and I think it's amazing as it is </v>

4388
03:01:10.291 --> 03:01:13.060
<v Speaker 4>and communism doesn't give you that </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly as you're saying.</v>

4389
03:01:13.070 --> 03:01:18.070
<v Speaker 4>Them in capitalism is responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 4>this intense competition and these cats </v>

4390
03:01:18.400 --> 03:01:22.630
<v Speaker 4>and these smartphones now where they are</v>
<v Speaker 4>legitimate contenders to apple.</v>

4391
03:01:22.631 --> 03:01:25.630
<v Speaker 4>Now like apple just released the iphone </v>
<v Speaker 4>10 or the x,</v>

4392
03:01:25.631 --> 03:01:26.680
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck they're going to call </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

4393
03:01:27.010 --> 03:01:30.970
<v Speaker 4>but you have legitimate contenders in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Samsung Galaxy.</v>

4394
03:01:30.971 --> 03:01:35.971
<v Speaker 4>Note eight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Galaxy s eight and the Google Pixel </v>

4395
03:01:35.971 --> 03:01:39.511
<v Speaker 4>two xl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have these three phones that a lot </v>

4396
03:01:39.511 --> 03:01:41.110
<v Speaker 4>of people compare favorably to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>iphone.</v>

4397
03:01:41.111 --> 03:01:44.680
<v Speaker 4>They're going back and forth with this </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like it's a neck and neck race.</v>

4398
03:01:44.880 --> 03:01:49.880
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a matter of whether or not the </v>

4399
03:01:49.880 --> 03:01:50.080
<v Speaker 4>integration with the operating system is</v>
<v Speaker 4>important to you because a lot of people</v>

4400
03:01:50.081 --> 03:01:53.780
<v Speaker 4>enjoy using a Mac and an apple computer </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

4401
03:01:53.800 --> 03:01:58.800
<v Speaker 4>they want to have the phone seamlessly </v>
<v Speaker 4>integrated with the computer and then a </v>

4402
03:01:58.800 --> 03:02:03.181
<v Speaker 4>lot of other people use windows and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>prefer to use an android phone because </v>

4403
03:02:03.181 --> 03:02:03.181
<v Speaker 4>of that.</v>

4404
03:02:03.181 --> 03:02:03.181
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

4405
03:02:03.181 --> 03:02:06.010
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with massive competition </v>
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

4406
03:02:06.011 --> 03:02:09.850
<v Speaker 4>which is fueling apple to innovate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fueling samsung to innovate and me,</v>

4407
03:02:09.851 --> 03:02:14.851
<v Speaker 4>right now it's just phones and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows whether or not it's really </v>

4408
03:02:14.851 --> 03:02:16.810
<v Speaker 4>important to us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that could lead to bigger and better</v>

4409
03:02:16.811 --> 03:02:21.811
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one saw the smartphone coming and </v>

4410
03:02:21.811 --> 03:02:22.240
<v Speaker 4>that's really revolutionized the way we </v>
<v Speaker 4>exchange information,</v>

4411
03:02:22.241 --> 03:02:25.750
<v Speaker 4>the way we gather information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Google's new pixel xl,</v>

4412
03:02:26.050 --> 03:02:28.390
<v Speaker 4>you squeeze the side and ask you a </v>
<v Speaker 4>question,</v>

4413
03:02:28.960 --> 03:02:31.090
<v Speaker 4>like that's how quick the assistant </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes in as well.</v>

4414
03:02:31.120 --> 03:02:35.680
<v Speaker 4>So you squeeze the side and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell me who Collin Moriarty is.</v>

4415
03:02:35.770 --> 03:02:37.920
<v Speaker 4>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It shows you instantaneous,</v>

4416
03:02:37.921 --> 03:02:40.830
<v Speaker 4>a sexist pig,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a joke,</v>

4417
03:02:40.840 --> 03:02:45.840
<v Speaker 4>and he should die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that Jamie foldable screens </v>

4418
03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:46.360
<v Speaker 4>that are headed out the next couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

4419
03:02:46.400 --> 03:02:47.290
<v Speaker 4>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The next thing,</v>

4420
03:02:47.350 --> 03:02:48.670
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

4421
03:02:48.730 --> 03:02:53.730
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This slap wrist thing where you're </v>

4422
03:02:53.730 --> 03:02:54.940
<v Speaker 4>talking about with the fucking tape </v>
<v Speaker 4>measures and as you know Korean company,</v>

4423
03:02:54.941 --> 03:02:58.150
<v Speaker 4>lg is doing this for altruistic reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to make any money.</v>

4424
03:02:58.151 --> 03:02:59.660
<v Speaker 4>They don't see any money in the foldable</v>
<v Speaker 4>skirt.</v>

4425
03:03:00.100 --> 03:03:01.680
<v Speaker 4>Pull it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bernie Sanders.</v>

4426
03:03:04.530 --> 03:03:09.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's going to support his neck with one </v>

4427
03:03:09.530 --> 03:03:11.281
<v Speaker 4>of those phones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get when them bitches just shoot under </v>

4428
03:03:11.281 --> 03:03:12.010

<v Speaker 4>I get a phone call.</v>

4429
03:03:12.011 --> 03:03:13.610
<v Speaker 4>I looked down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

4430
03:03:13.720 --> 03:03:17.920
<v Speaker 4>I think we're in an incredible time when</v>
<v Speaker 4>it comes to this competition though,</v>

4431
03:03:17.921 --> 03:03:20.740
<v Speaker 4>and you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that only exists if people have profit.</v>

4432
03:03:21.080 --> 03:03:24.100
<v Speaker 4>You only exist that people have some </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of A.</v>

4433
03:03:24.100 --> 03:03:26.830
<v Speaker 4>There's competition and there's an </v>
<v Speaker 4>incentive and you know,</v>

4434
03:03:26.831 --> 03:03:31.831
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a battle going on between these </v>

4435
03:03:31.831 --> 03:03:32.350
<v Speaker 4>and I think that's the forefront of it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because with laptops,</v>

4436
03:03:32.370 --> 03:03:34.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's competition but boys </v>
<v Speaker 4>kinda stagnant,</v>

4437
03:03:35.020 --> 03:03:35.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

4438
03:03:35.651 --> 03:03:40.651
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well how much processing power do you </v>

4439
03:03:40.651 --> 03:03:40.651
<v Speaker 4>need?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're not rendering video games,</v>

4440
03:03:40.651 --> 03:03:42.250
<v Speaker 4>if you're not making things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're not making movies,</v>

4441
03:03:42.370 --> 03:03:45.910
<v Speaker 4>if you're a person that's making CGI or </v>
<v Speaker 4>filmed or something like that,</v>

4442
03:03:45.911 --> 03:03:50.911
<v Speaker 4>well then it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could probably use the faster </v>

4443
03:03:50.911 --> 03:03:51.070
<v Speaker 4>processors and all the power and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

4444
03:03:51.071 --> 03:03:56.071
<v Speaker 4>but really the competition is in video </v>
<v Speaker 4>games and in or in a video and apps and </v>

4445
03:03:57.050 --> 03:04:02.050
<v Speaker 4>phones and the images these phones can </v>
<v Speaker 4>create and all of them now have the </v>

4446
03:04:02.050 --> 03:04:05.681
<v Speaker 4>ability to do portrait mode where they </v>
<v Speaker 4>blur the background and bring you into </v>

4447
03:04:05.681 --> 03:04:10.661
<v Speaker 4>the foreground and then the Google Pixel</v>
<v Speaker 4>xl has some incredible ai for altering </v>

4448
03:04:11.361 --> 03:04:14.870
<v Speaker 4>images and making them look cooler and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really amazing stuff,</v>

4449
03:04:14.871 --> 03:04:15.170
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4450
03:04:15.290 --> 03:04:16.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's awesome and I.</v>

4451
03:04:16.271 --> 03:04:19.490
<v Speaker 5>I feel like a lot of the cool stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 5>we even dwell on from back in the day,</v>

4452
03:04:19.491 --> 03:04:24.491
<v Speaker 5>everything had a profit motive back in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially like we were talking about </v>

4453
03:04:24.491 --> 03:04:24.491
<v Speaker 5>the age of exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they weren't looking.</v>

4454
03:04:24.491 --> 03:04:29.441
<v Speaker 5>They didn't want to come here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Europeans were just looking for a </v>

4455
03:04:29.441 --> 03:04:31.811
<v Speaker 5>way to shorten their trade with Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't care about what was in </v>

4456
03:04:31.811 --> 03:04:31.811
<v Speaker 5>between.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was actually,</v>

4457
03:04:31.811 --> 03:04:31.811
<v Speaker 5>it's super inconvenient that we were </v>
<v Speaker 5>here,</v>

4458
03:04:31.811 --> 03:04:36.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there was always money at the end </v>

4459
03:04:36.670 --> 03:04:36.670
<v Speaker 5>of the tunnel for like good things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's why.</v>

4460
03:04:36.670 --> 03:04:40.510
<v Speaker 5>That's what the space race,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why the space race is so unique </v>

4461
03:04:40.510 --> 03:04:40.510
<v Speaker 5>because it had no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4462
03:04:40.510 --> 03:04:41.900
<v Speaker 5>like everything from like mercury and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Gemini.</v>

4463
03:04:42.170 --> 03:04:44.300
<v Speaker 5>Apollo missions had like no real reason </v>
<v Speaker 5>to exist.</v>

4464
03:04:44.301 --> 03:04:45.830
<v Speaker 5>Other than that we wanted the best,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the communist,</v>

4465
03:04:45.831 --> 03:04:49.040
<v Speaker 5>there was no financial reason to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is why it's so unique.</v>

4466
03:04:49.100 --> 03:04:49.600
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

4467
03:04:49.630 --> 03:04:54.630
<v Speaker 5>I would even argue to this day like </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's technology that NASA is created </v>

4468
03:04:54.630 --> 03:04:56.600
<v Speaker 5>that we find in our everyday lives,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's like one of those unique places</v>

4469
03:04:56.601 --> 03:04:58.380
<v Speaker 5>where that's not really true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's also</v>

4470
03:04:58.950 --> 03:05:02.410
<v Speaker 4>right that subsistence living probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes healthier,</v>

4471
03:05:02.411 --> 03:05:07.411
<v Speaker 4>happier people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then all this chasing money and </v>

4472
03:05:07.411 --> 03:05:08.360
<v Speaker 4>chasing innovation and chasing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4473
03:05:08.590 --> 03:05:13.590
<v Speaker 4>technological superiority just leaves us</v>
<v Speaker 4>with this hollow feeling or it doesn't </v>

4474
03:05:13.590 --> 03:05:14.890
<v Speaker 4>do you any good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're seeing a lot of these people</v>

4475
03:05:14.891 --> 03:05:19.891
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was this guy that we were talking </v>

4476
03:05:19.891 --> 03:05:22.231
<v Speaker 4>about recently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy who he coded facebook likes and </v>

4477
03:05:22.231 --> 03:05:27.121
<v Speaker 4>now he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your computer is trying to hijack your </v>

4478
03:05:27.121 --> 03:05:27.121
<v Speaker 4>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think is the name of the article.</v>

4479
03:05:27.121 --> 03:05:28.480
<v Speaker 4>Your smartphone is trying to hijack your</v>
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>

4480
03:05:28.810 --> 03:05:33.810
<v Speaker 4>And what it was essentially saying is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that your brain is not designed to deal </v>

4481
03:05:34.361 --> 03:05:39.361
<v Speaker 4>with the reward system that's involved </v>
<v Speaker 4>in checking likes on facebook or </v>

4482
03:05:39.361 --> 03:05:40.360
<v Speaker 4>instagram or stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that,</v>

4483
03:05:40.361 --> 03:05:41.160
<v Speaker 4>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

4484
03:05:41.310 --> 03:05:43.080
<v Speaker 4>this constant like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um.</v>

4485
03:05:43.810 --> 03:05:44.480
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4486
03:05:44.750 --> 03:05:45.240
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4487
03:05:45.310 --> 03:05:48.100
<v Speaker 4>yesterday we were talking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about,</v>

4488
03:05:48.160 --> 03:05:50.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had Jamie Kilstein,</v>

4489
03:05:50.320 --> 03:05:55.320
<v Speaker 4>he was talking about checking his phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like constantly checking twitter on his </v>

4490
03:05:55.320 --> 03:05:55.320
<v Speaker 4>phone and arguing back and forth with </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

4491
03:05:55.320 --> 03:06:00.090
<v Speaker 4>Seeing who supporting him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's not in that it becomes this </v>

4492
03:06:00.090 --> 03:06:01.630
<v Speaker 4>massive addictive thing and that how </v>
<v Speaker 4>unhealthy that is.</v>

4493
03:06:01.750 --> 03:06:06.750
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like there's a lot of things about </v>

4494
03:06:06.750 --> 03:06:09.211
<v Speaker 4>this technological world that we live in</v>
<v Speaker 4>that maybe aren't sustainable or aren't </v>

4495
03:06:09.211 --> 03:06:11.860
<v Speaker 4>compatible with being a biological human</v>
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>

4496
03:06:11.970 --> 03:06:14.040
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's hated,</v>

4497
03:06:14.130 --> 03:06:19.130
<v Speaker 5>mentioned again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's an episode of Black Mirror </v>

4498
03:06:19.130 --> 03:06:19.260
<v Speaker 5>where there's this one person in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>cast where they refuse to get this,</v>

4499
03:06:19.530 --> 03:06:21.960
<v Speaker 5>this augment that everyone else has.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to read it for you anymore.</v>

4500
03:06:22.080 --> 03:06:27.080
<v Speaker 5>And it makes them this unique thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they refuse to partake in the </v>

4501
03:06:27.080 --> 03:06:28.470
<v Speaker 5>new normal of interconnectivity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

4502
03:06:28.520 --> 03:06:29.000
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

4503
03:06:29.160 --> 03:06:30.540
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

4504
03:06:30.541 --> 03:06:32.280
<v Speaker 5>it goes back to the beauty of the system</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there is choice.</v>

4505
03:06:32.281 --> 03:06:37.281
<v Speaker 5>Like you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Bohemian painter that just wants to </v>

4506
03:06:37.281 --> 03:06:37.281
<v Speaker 5>make $15,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>a year selling some art.</v>

4507
03:06:37.281 --> 03:06:37.320
<v Speaker 5>That's the beauty of choice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4508
03:06:37.321 --> 03:06:39.330
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as long as the system gives you that</v>

4509
03:06:39.331 --> 03:06:42.060
<v Speaker 5>choice to succeed or fail and no one </v>
<v Speaker 5>else is responsible for you,</v>

4510
03:06:42.120 --> 03:06:42.850
<v Speaker 5>like in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

4511
03:06:43.140 --> 03:06:45.480
<v Speaker 5>in base ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm not saying we're not responsible</v>

4512
03:06:45.720 --> 03:06:47.130
<v Speaker 5>to bring you to the hospital if you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>sick.</v>

4513
03:06:47.131 --> 03:06:52.131
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're not responsible to make </v>

4514
03:06:52.131 --> 03:06:53.961
<v Speaker 5>decisions for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're not responsible to line your </v>

4515
03:06:53.961 --> 03:06:53.961
<v Speaker 5>pockets with money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You did not.</v>

4516
03:06:53.961 --> 03:06:53.961
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then that's,</v>

4517
03:06:53.961 --> 03:06:54.600
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's fine with me.</v>

4518
03:06:54.630 --> 03:06:56.010
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the awful things</v>

4519
03:06:56.010 --> 03:06:58.080
<v Speaker 4>about communism that people very rarely </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussed.</v>

4520
03:06:58.081 --> 03:06:59.760
<v Speaker 4>You're assigned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>signed a job,</v>

4521
03:07:00.030 --> 03:07:02.190
<v Speaker 4>you're assigned what you do if you live </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Cuba.</v>

4522
03:07:02.490 --> 03:07:07.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's very little wiggle room </v>
<v Speaker 4>as to what you can and can't do if you </v>

4523
03:07:07.490 --> 03:07:09.600
<v Speaker 4>were living in the Communist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Soviet Union is very little.</v>

4524
03:07:09.601 --> 03:07:14.601
<v Speaker 4>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have a whole lot of decision </v>

4525
03:07:14.601 --> 03:07:15.270
<v Speaker 4>making capabilities and that's just not </v>
<v Speaker 4>how human beings operate at their best.</v>

4526
03:07:15.540 --> 03:07:19.180
<v Speaker 4>We operate at our best when we're free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you are uniquely you,</v>

4527
03:07:19.181 --> 03:07:20.580
<v Speaker 4>you're not me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not you.</v>

4528
03:07:20.581 --> 03:07:25.581
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how your brain works and </v>

4529
03:07:25.581 --> 03:07:25.581
<v Speaker 4>there's people out there like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

4530
03:07:25.581 --> 03:07:29.490
<v Speaker 4>here's an example back that are so weird</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so different from me,</v>

4531
03:07:29.730 --> 03:07:34.730
<v Speaker 4>but he's capable of creating weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking funky music because he's so </v>

4532
03:07:36.061 --> 03:07:38.200
<v Speaker 4>different because he's so interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4533
03:07:38.460 --> 03:07:43.460
<v Speaker 4>Like his form of Marilyn Manson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his form of creativity just doesn't </v>

4534
03:07:43.590 --> 03:07:43.950
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

4535
03:07:43.980 --> 03:07:45.820
<v Speaker 4>My brain doesn't make that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4536
03:07:45.821 --> 03:07:49.140
<v Speaker 4>like a tomato tree doesn't make mangoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4537
03:07:49.320 --> 03:07:54.320
<v Speaker 4>and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're are the freedom to express </v>

4538
03:07:54.320 --> 03:07:58.971
<v Speaker 4>yourself in your own unique way and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>freedom to live your life with your own </v>

4539
03:07:58.971 --> 03:08:03.681
<v Speaker 4>unique direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just one of the greatest things </v>

4540
03:08:03.681 --> 03:08:07.131
<v Speaker 4>about being an American is that we have </v>
<v Speaker 4>more freedom in that regard than anyone </v>

4541
03:08:07.741 --> 03:08:11.490
<v Speaker 4>that's ever lived because we have more </v>
<v Speaker 4>access to things,</v>

4542
03:08:11.670 --> 03:08:16.670
<v Speaker 4>we have more access to information and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we have more freedom to choose to </v>

4543
03:08:16.670 --> 03:08:18.120
<v Speaker 4>express yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to speak out,</v>

4544
03:08:18.270 --> 03:08:20.310
<v Speaker 4>and anything that gets in the way from </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

4545
03:08:20.311 --> 03:08:25.311
<v Speaker 4>including the limiting free speech on </v>
<v Speaker 4>campuses is fucking dangerous in that </v>

4546
03:08:26.131 --> 03:08:27.810
<v Speaker 4>regard because it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>

4547
03:08:27.811 --> 03:08:29.610
<v Speaker 4>you think you're helping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're,</v>

4548
03:08:29.611 --> 03:08:34.611
<v Speaker 4>you're limiting freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're limiting freedom because it </v>

4549
03:08:34.611 --> 03:08:37.881
<v Speaker 4>doesn't jive with what's going on in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your head and that's just not the way </v>

4550
03:08:37.881 --> 03:08:37.881
<v Speaker 4>it's supposed to work.</v>

4551
03:08:37.881 --> 03:08:38.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

4552
03:08:38.441 --> 03:08:43.441
<v Speaker 5>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I find what's happening on college </v>

4553
03:08:43.441 --> 03:08:43.441
<v Speaker 5>campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I find the stymieing of free speech,</v>

4554
03:08:43.441 --> 03:08:47.311
<v Speaker 5>this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this very primitive idea that we are </v>

4555
03:08:47.311 --> 03:08:47.311
<v Speaker 5>this primitive notion of almost thought </v>
<v Speaker 5>policing,</v>

4556
03:08:47.311 --> 03:08:49.750
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as being super unsavory because you have</v>

4557
03:08:49.751 --> 03:08:51.690
<v Speaker 5>to protect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to.</v>

4558
03:08:52.030 --> 03:08:57.030
<v Speaker 5>A society needs to be dedicated to </v>
<v Speaker 5>protecting its bad elements as long as </v>

4559
03:08:57.030 --> 03:08:57.030
<v Speaker 5>those elements aren't illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

4560
03:08:57.030 --> 03:08:59.050
<v Speaker 5>So like you don't want to protect the </v>
<v Speaker 5>person who is murdering someone,</v>

4561
03:08:59.230 --> 03:09:01.720
<v Speaker 5>but you might want to protect someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>who you might want to protect the rights</v>

4562
03:09:01.721 --> 03:09:04.980
<v Speaker 5>of someone who is espousing really </v>
<v Speaker 5>racist shit because you you.</v>

4563
03:09:05.020 --> 03:09:10.020
<v Speaker 5>That's why these protections exist is </v>
<v Speaker 5>for their freedom to express those bad </v>

4564
03:09:10.020 --> 03:09:10.020
<v Speaker 5>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As long as they don't play out,</v>

4565
03:09:10.060 --> 03:09:12.100
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to agree with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You and I don't agree with those ideas,</v>

4566
03:09:12.400 --> 03:09:14.980
<v Speaker 5>but you give them oxygen and power.</v>

4567
03:09:15.040 --> 03:09:16.530
<v Speaker 5>When you try to limit them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4568
03:09:16.531 --> 03:09:19.200
<v Speaker 5>I guarantee you that because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4569
03:09:19.210 --> 03:09:24.210
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the throwing around at the majority of </v>

4570
03:09:24.210 --> 03:09:25.720
<v Speaker 5>not ism and as a pejorative Nazis and </v>
<v Speaker 5>fascism and kind of giving these people </v>

4571
03:09:25.720 --> 03:09:27.160
<v Speaker 5>screentime,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Richard Spencer and all these guys,</v>

4572
03:09:27.400 --> 03:09:29.320
<v Speaker 5>I guarantee you that they've gained in </v>
<v Speaker 5>adherence,</v>

4573
03:09:29.321 --> 03:09:33.130
<v Speaker 5>not lost because they're gaining more </v>
<v Speaker 5>and more oxygen because you're giving it</v>

4574
03:09:33.131 --> 03:09:35.720
<v Speaker 5>to them by trying to stymie them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're bringing attention to them.</v>

4575
03:09:35.721 --> 03:09:40.721
<v Speaker 5>I said over and over again with Milo </v>
<v Speaker 5>Yiannopoulos going to Berkeley earlier </v>

4576
03:09:40.721 --> 03:09:41.770
<v Speaker 5>this year and then not being allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>speak and everyone losing their minds.</v>

4577
03:09:41.920 --> 03:09:46.920
<v Speaker 5>You just gained Milo Yiannopoulos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of people that had no idea who </v>

4578
03:09:46.920 --> 03:09:49.441
<v Speaker 5>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing that would have hurt him the </v>

4579
03:09:49.441 --> 03:09:49.441
<v Speaker 5>most is going to a room that was empty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would.</v>

4580
03:09:49.441 --> 03:09:53.341
<v Speaker 5>No one was there to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he has the right to go to that room </v>

4581
03:09:53.341 --> 03:09:53.341
<v Speaker 5>and speaking on the less well.</v>

4582
03:09:53.341 --> 03:09:54.250
<v Speaker 4>What's interesting is what's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like silenced</v>

4583
03:09:54.250 --> 03:09:58.210
<v Speaker 3>him is his own words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean his own,</v>

4584
03:09:58.270 --> 03:10:00.110
<v Speaker 3>what fucked him up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His,</v>

4585
03:10:00.130 --> 03:10:02.740
<v Speaker 3>his own conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

4586
03:10:02.800 --> 03:10:05.770
<v Speaker 3>his ability to freely speak about </v>
<v Speaker 3>pedophilia,</v>

4587
03:10:05.800 --> 03:10:06.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give them,</v>

4588
03:10:06.730 --> 03:10:11.730
<v Speaker 3>it goes back to the give the person </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough rope and they'll do the job for </v>

4589
03:10:11.730 --> 03:10:11.730
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4590
03:10:11.730 --> 03:10:11.730
<v Speaker 3>like you don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4591
03:10:11.730 --> 03:10:16.530
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to force a square peg </v>

4592
03:10:16.530 --> 03:10:16.530
<v Speaker 3>into a round hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I think of a lot of ways,</v>

4593
03:10:16.530 --> 03:10:21.361
<v Speaker 3>Milo is a provocateur and what he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to do is trying to push buttons </v>

4594
03:10:21.361 --> 03:10:22.420
<v Speaker 3>and get attention and doing all those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

4595
03:10:22.421 --> 03:10:26.380
<v Speaker 3>But in literally doing that and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>ranting and raving,</v>

4596
03:10:26.410 --> 03:10:28.900
<v Speaker 3>he tripped over his own dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4597
03:10:28.901 --> 03:10:31.950
<v Speaker 3>the publishing company removes the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4598
03:10:31.960 --> 03:10:33.760
<v Speaker 3>that's a leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Breitbart.</v>

4599
03:10:33.761 --> 03:10:38.761
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is essentially where all this came </v>

4600
03:10:38.761 --> 03:10:38.761
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4601
03:10:38.761 --> 03:10:40.891
<v Speaker 3>there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what people kind of conflate is </v>

4602
03:10:40.891 --> 03:10:42.880
<v Speaker 3>there's room and necessity for </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences for your actions.</v>

4603
03:10:43.140 --> 03:10:48.140
<v Speaker 3>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no one's saying that there's no </v>

4604
03:10:48.140 --> 03:10:50.101
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Consequences seem to be taking place in </v>

4605
03:10:50.101 --> 03:10:50.101
<v Speaker 3>the marketplace of free ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4606
03:10:50.101 --> 03:10:51.430
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>

4607
03:10:51.730 --> 03:10:53.800
<v Speaker 3>I feel like people have tried to force </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences on me,</v>

4608
03:10:53.801 --> 03:10:54.340
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4609
03:10:54.341 --> 03:10:59.341
<v Speaker 3>They tried to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tried to force a consequence that </v>

4610
03:10:59.341 --> 03:10:59.341
<v Speaker 3>didn't work out the way that they wanted</v>
<v Speaker 3>it to,</v>

4611
03:10:59.341 --> 03:11:00.010
<v Speaker 3>but to try to make a point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4612
03:11:00.011 --> 03:11:02.470
<v Speaker 3>To try to illustrate a point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to let these things,</v>

4613
03:11:02.471 --> 03:11:07.471
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the marketplace will correct for </v>

4614
03:11:07.471 --> 03:11:09.601
<v Speaker 3>anything that is on toward Kevin Spacey </v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to be hurting for the rest of </v>

4615
03:11:09.601 --> 03:11:12.721
<v Speaker 3>his life compared to where he was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>five days ago because the consequences </v>

4616
03:11:12.721 --> 03:11:12.721
<v Speaker 3>of his actions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

4617
03:11:12.721 --> 03:11:17.550
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not saying that there shouldn't </v>

4618
03:11:17.550 --> 03:11:17.550
<v Speaker 3>be consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think a lot of people are saying</v>

4619
03:11:17.550 --> 03:11:17.550
<v Speaker 3>that at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like it's almost,</v>

4620
03:11:17.550 --> 03:11:19.180
<v Speaker 3>it's not policing like there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>preemptive consequences,</v>

4621
03:11:19.240 --> 03:11:21.250
<v Speaker 3>but these consequences should be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

4622
03:11:21.310 --> 03:11:26.310
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to do business with you </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you and your values don't align </v>

4623
03:11:26.310 --> 03:11:27.080
<v Speaker 3>with how we look at the world.</v>

4624
03:11:27.270 --> 03:11:29.230
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're free to do your own thing.</v>

4625
03:11:29.560 --> 03:11:30.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

4626
03:11:30.281 --> 03:11:30.700
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4627
03:11:30.730 --> 03:11:33.520
<v Speaker 3>and that's why I'm saying like you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>were giving,</v>

4628
03:11:33.550 --> 03:11:36.130
<v Speaker 3>were giving unsavory far right and far </v>
<v Speaker 3>left elements,</v>

4629
03:11:36.131 --> 03:11:38.800
<v Speaker 3>way too much oxygen and way too much </v>
<v Speaker 3>power in our society.</v>

4630
03:11:38.801 --> 03:11:40.810
<v Speaker 3>They don't represent anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you really,</v>

4631
03:11:41.320 --> 03:11:46.320
<v Speaker 3>when you walk through your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people do you know that a </v>

4632
03:11:46.320 --> 03:11:49.311
<v Speaker 3>scribe to Marxism?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people do you know that a </v>

4633
03:11:49.311 --> 03:11:51.881
<v Speaker 3>scribe to white nationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have never met in my own 33 years on </v>

4634
03:11:51.881 --> 03:11:53.770
<v Speaker 3>this planet in interacting with a ton of</v>
<v Speaker 3>different people.</v>

4635
03:11:53.771 --> 03:11:55.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure I've ever actually met a </v>
<v Speaker 3>white nationalist,</v>

4636
03:11:55.960 --> 03:12:00.190
<v Speaker 3>so why are we acting like this is a like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a massive component of American politics</v>

4637
03:12:00.220 --> 03:12:04.530
<v Speaker 3>when it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's probably $2,350</v>

4638
03:12:04.531 --> 03:12:08.320
<v Speaker 3>million that live here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just lob off the ends of the spectrum.</v>

4639
03:12:08.321 --> 03:12:09.700
<v Speaker 3>The far end of the spectrum is lob them </v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

4640
03:12:09.700 --> 03:12:12.070
<v Speaker 3>They're not welcome in polite society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can do whatever they want.</v>

4641
03:12:12.340 --> 03:12:17.340
<v Speaker 3>Everyone else I bet has 90 percent </v>
<v Speaker 3>agreement on most issues and I think </v>

4642
03:12:17.340 --> 03:12:18.700
<v Speaker 3>that this intense heated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming and yelling at each other that</v>

4643
03:12:18.701 --> 03:12:23.701
<v Speaker 3>you see like on Berkeley and Antifa </v>
<v Speaker 3>showing up with fucking Ninja masks on </v>

4644
03:12:23.701 --> 03:12:25.630
<v Speaker 3>throwing Molotov cocktails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This ain't helping anybody know.</v>

4645
03:12:25.631 --> 03:12:29.650
<v Speaker 3>Anthony's just ramps up the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Antifa like these guys are losers,</v>

4646
03:12:29.651 --> 03:12:30.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4647
03:12:30.041 --> 03:12:31.330
<v Speaker 3>like how dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

4648
03:12:31.430 --> 03:12:32.710
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

4649
03:12:32.790 --> 03:12:35.200
<v Speaker 3>they supported by the mayor of Berkeley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4650
03:12:35.950 --> 03:12:38.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure a lot of weird things are </v>
<v Speaker 3>supported by the mayor of Berkeley.</v>

4651
03:12:38.450 --> 03:12:40.030
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

4652
03:12:40.090 --> 03:12:43.920
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't help any situations they look</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're like Cobra officers from Gi</v>

4653
03:12:43.920 --> 03:12:47.440
<v Speaker 3>Gel running around doing their thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>destroying private property.</v>

4654
03:12:47.560 --> 03:12:52.560
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why you would do this hero own </v>

4655
03:12:52.560 --> 03:12:52.560
<v Speaker 3>society to your own what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what</v>

4656
03:12:52.560 --> 03:12:53.660
<v Speaker 5>books,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what it is anxious to like,</v>

4657
03:12:53.661 --> 03:12:58.661
<v Speaker 5>what point are you trying to prove and </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're seeing this replicate itself </v>

4658
03:12:58.661 --> 03:12:58.661
<v Speaker 5>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know it's an unpopular thing to say,</v>

4659
03:12:58.661 --> 03:13:00.980
<v Speaker 5>but you can draw this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of this back of the Ferguson even,</v>

4660
03:13:01.010 --> 03:13:03.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Ferguson.</v>

4661
03:13:03.020 --> 03:13:06.110
<v Speaker 5>See in some ways ferguson is a travesty </v>
<v Speaker 5>of justice,</v>

4662
03:13:06.111 --> 03:13:08.240
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it seemed way worse than it actually</v>

4663
03:13:08.241 --> 03:13:11.240
<v Speaker 5>was once everything came out once,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once Loretta Lynch,</v>

4664
03:13:11.300 --> 03:13:14.930
<v Speaker 5>not a very well known racist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>refused to try the person at the federal</v>

4665
03:13:14.931 --> 03:13:16.280
<v Speaker 5>level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>local and state authorities,</v>

4666
03:13:16.850 --> 03:13:20.280
<v Speaker 5>grand juries refuse to try Darren Wilson</v>
<v Speaker 5>for what he did to the,</v>

4667
03:13:20.350 --> 03:13:25.350
<v Speaker 5>to the gentleman there or whatever and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you and you get the full story and yet </v>

4668
03:13:25.350 --> 03:13:27.881
<v Speaker 5>you still have this society or the </v>
<v Speaker 5>community in ruins based on some hands </v>

4669
03:13:27.881 --> 03:13:27.881
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't shoot,</v>

4670
03:13:27.881 --> 03:13:28.360
<v Speaker 5>never happened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4671
03:13:28.700 --> 03:13:31.580
<v Speaker 5>But literally never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But this is the rallying cry.</v>

4672
03:13:31.580 --> 03:13:32.810
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this destroyed city.</v>

4673
03:13:32.811 --> 03:13:36.320
<v Speaker 5>The rallying cry from as it sounds good </v>
<v Speaker 5>to people that want to believe a certain</v>

4674
03:13:36.321 --> 03:13:41.321
<v Speaker 5>narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so they repeated and then </v>

4675
03:13:41.321 --> 03:13:43.481
<v Speaker 5>everybody's repeating it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you have people doing it on </v>

4676
03:13:43.481 --> 03:13:45.611
<v Speaker 5>television and then everybody decides </v>
<v Speaker 5>that this is the thing that we're going </v>

4677
03:13:45.611 --> 03:13:46.010
<v Speaker 5>to say over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>regardless of whether or not it's true.</v>

4678
03:13:46.640 --> 03:13:51.640
<v Speaker 5>The real travesty of that too is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you can literally throw a dart at a map </v>

4679
03:13:51.640 --> 03:13:53.720
<v Speaker 5>of the United States and find a civil </v>
<v Speaker 5>rights thing that's truly a civil rights</v>

4680
03:13:53.721 --> 03:13:58.721
<v Speaker 5>infraction that's truly horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That probably deserves the oxygen and </v>

4681
03:13:58.721 --> 03:13:59.840
<v Speaker 5>the attention and could be a legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 5>rallying cry,</v>

4682
03:13:59.990 --> 03:14:01.760
<v Speaker 5>but it goes back to the point you were </v>
<v Speaker 5>making before too.</v>

4683
03:14:01.910 --> 03:14:03.050
<v Speaker 5>People don't want to admit they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrong.</v>

4684
03:14:03.170 --> 03:14:08.170
<v Speaker 5>No one wants to admit that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a year out from Ferguson were much </v>

4685
03:14:08.170 --> 03:14:11.021
<v Speaker 5>further than that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but even six months out from when it </v>

4686
03:14:11.021 --> 03:14:11.021
<v Speaker 5>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people look back,</v>

4687
03:14:11.021 --> 03:14:11.900
<v Speaker 5>read through the grand jury stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the federal government's take on it,</v>

4688
03:14:11.901 --> 03:14:13.130
<v Speaker 5>all that kind of stuff and realize,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4689
03:14:13.970 --> 03:14:18.970
<v Speaker 5>maybe this wasn't the best idea that to </v>
<v Speaker 5>to to act like this when we didn't have </v>

4690
03:14:18.970 --> 03:14:18.970
<v Speaker 5>all the information.</v>

4691
03:14:18.970 --> 03:14:22.760
<v Speaker 5>So you think that the information is </v>
<v Speaker 5>flowing freer and people have more of an</v>

4692
03:14:22.761 --> 03:14:27.761
<v Speaker 5>understanding than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think people are really doubling down </v>

4693
03:14:27.761 --> 03:14:31.700
<v Speaker 5>on the far right and the far left and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the extremism is sort of elevated in the</v>

4694
03:14:31.701 --> 03:14:34.430
<v Speaker 5>in that regard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think overall,</v>

4695
03:14:34.490 --> 03:14:35.330
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4696
03:14:35.580 --> 03:14:40.580
<v Speaker 5>people don't like the word Centrus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the people in the center of the </v>

4697
03:14:40.580 --> 03:14:42.950
<v Speaker 5>people that are more reasonable are more</v>
<v Speaker 5>informed and more.</v>

4698
03:14:43.280 --> 03:14:46.550
<v Speaker 5>There's more communication going on than</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever before and in that sense,</v>

4699
03:14:46.551 --> 03:14:48.170
<v Speaker 5>I'm very hopeful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am hopeful to.</v>

4700
03:14:48.171 --> 03:14:53.171
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like how centrism has become this </v>

4701
03:14:53.171 --> 03:14:53.171
<v Speaker 5>dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like unspoken word.</v>

4702
03:14:53.171 --> 03:14:53.171
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

4703
03:14:53.171 --> 03:14:57.520
<v Speaker 5>but that's only again from the far </v>
<v Speaker 5>fringes that feel like they're losing </v>

4704
03:14:57.520 --> 03:15:00.170
<v Speaker 5>because they are losing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If your idea is predicated on a race,</v>

4705
03:15:00.350 --> 03:15:03.290
<v Speaker 5>if like your idea of supremacy or </v>
<v Speaker 5>superiority as a predicate on that,</v>

4706
03:15:03.320 --> 03:15:04.550
<v Speaker 5>you're a moron,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4707
03:15:04.900 --> 03:15:07.160
<v Speaker 5>And no one does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one has to talk to you about that.</v>

4708
03:15:07.200 --> 03:15:10.880
<v Speaker 5>You don't deserve to be part of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>rational adult conversation.</v>

4709
03:15:10.970 --> 03:15:15.970
<v Speaker 5>Foolish notion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If your idea on the left is that you </v>

4710
03:15:15.970 --> 03:15:18.521
<v Speaker 5>have to stymie free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that free speech is this antiquated </v>

4711
03:15:18.521 --> 03:15:18.521
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tweeted out a video last week,</v>

4712
03:15:18.610 --> 03:15:20.530
<v Speaker 5>have a kid at the University of Utah </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying that the.</v>

4713
03:15:20.540 --> 03:15:21.260
<v Speaker 5>I retweeted it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4714
03:15:21.261 --> 03:15:22.520
<v Speaker 5>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of saying the.</v>

4715
03:15:22.521 --> 03:15:23.000
<v Speaker 5>The.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4716
03:15:23.001 --> 03:15:24.620
<v Speaker 5>like the tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a valid document.</v>

4717
03:15:24.621 --> 03:15:25.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's about.</v>

4718
03:15:25.430 --> 03:15:25.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4719
03:15:25.780 --> 03:15:27.020
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing valid about the bill of </v>
<v Speaker 5>rights.</v>

4720
03:15:27.021 --> 03:15:28.160
<v Speaker 5>You Moron,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4721
03:15:28.310 --> 03:15:33.310
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing like if your idea is is </v>
<v Speaker 5>Marxism and this weird economic </v>

4722
03:15:33.310 --> 03:15:35.680
<v Speaker 5>engineering and all this kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you are also a moron and,</v>

4723
03:15:35.760 --> 03:15:38.240
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not afraid to tell you that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4724
03:15:38.450 --> 03:15:43.450
<v Speaker 5>you have to have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to be academically limited to </v>

4725
03:15:43.450 --> 03:15:43.450
<v Speaker 5>look at either of those ideas on this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on this,</v>

4726
03:15:43.450 --> 03:15:45.290
<v Speaker 5>on these spectrums and think that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have a good idea.</v>

4727
03:15:45.530 --> 03:15:50.530
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>usually a collection of ideas not from </v>

4728
03:15:50.530 --> 03:15:50.530
<v Speaker 5>the but a collection of left,</v>

4729
03:15:50.530 --> 03:15:50.700
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Liberal,</v>

4730
03:15:50.701 --> 03:15:52.770
<v Speaker 3>conservative usually is probably what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4731
03:15:52.980 --> 03:15:57.980
<v Speaker 3>No one in the mainstream of American </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics or mainstream of Western </v>

4732
03:15:57.980 --> 03:16:00.090
<v Speaker 3>politics has a monopoly on right or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>monopoly on good ideas.</v>

4733
03:16:00.360 --> 03:16:05.360
<v Speaker 3>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are great things that Republicans </v>

4734
03:16:05.360 --> 03:16:07.701
<v Speaker 3>believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are great things that Democrats </v>

4735
03:16:07.701 --> 03:16:07.701
<v Speaker 3>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are terrible ideas on both sides.</v>

4736
03:16:07.701 --> 03:16:10.500
<v Speaker 3>The only thing I see on the extremes is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just a complete dearth of good ideas.</v>

4737
03:16:10.560 --> 03:16:12.900
<v Speaker 3>It's just all bad ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just all terrible ideas.</v>

4738
03:16:13.350 --> 03:16:15.210
<v Speaker 3>And so why are we even paying attention </v>
<v Speaker 3>to them?</v>

4739
03:16:15.360 --> 03:16:17.700
<v Speaker 3>They can kick and scream and shout all </v>
<v Speaker 3>they want,</v>

4740
03:16:18.150 --> 03:16:21.120
<v Speaker 3>but we're giving them too much time on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

4741
03:16:21.170 --> 03:16:21.730
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4742
03:16:21.930 --> 03:16:23.190
<v Speaker 3>the news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're giving them too much time.</v>

4743
03:16:23.191 --> 03:16:26.010
<v Speaker 3>Even even I do it even I fall prey to </v>
<v Speaker 3>that because it's fun.</v>

4744
03:16:26.070 --> 03:16:31.070
<v Speaker 3>It is just that little fucker on TV </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that I don't think that the bill </v>

4745
03:16:31.070 --> 03:16:31.170
<v Speaker 3>of rights is like a valid document.</v>

4746
03:16:31.930 --> 03:16:33.330
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very radical,</v>

4747
03:16:33.331 --> 03:16:34.350
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason,</v>

4748
03:16:34.351 --> 03:16:35.820
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're allowed to speak at all right.</v>

4749
03:16:35.821 --> 03:16:40.821
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He probably also thinks this is a </v>

4750
03:16:40.821 --> 03:16:40.821
<v Speaker 3>fascist country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

4751
03:16:40.821 --> 03:16:41.450
<v Speaker 3>I know that when the Nazis took over at </v>
<v Speaker 3>night in early 1933,</v>

4752
03:16:41.470 --> 03:16:46.470
<v Speaker 3>the first thing they did was let </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone say whatever they want so you </v>

4753
03:16:46.470 --> 03:16:49.131
<v Speaker 3>could see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could see the mirror images of the </v>

4754
03:16:49.131 --> 03:16:49.131
<v Speaker 3>United States and fascist Germany and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean it's everywhere.</v>

4755
03:16:49.131 --> 03:16:50.610
<v Speaker 3>If you listen to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4756
03:16:50.630 --> 03:16:51.810
<v Speaker 3>it was a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4757
03:16:51.811 --> 03:16:55.080
<v Speaker 3>He has a lot of learning to do and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked back and I look back one day at</v>

4758
03:16:55.081 --> 03:16:56.160
<v Speaker 3>that video and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

4759
03:16:56.161 --> 03:16:58.000
<v Speaker 3>I was fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4760
03:16:58.200 --> 03:16:59.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4761
03:16:59.250 --> 03:17:01.020
<v Speaker 3>you look so pompous and proud of </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself.</v>

4762
03:17:01.021 --> 03:17:06.021
<v Speaker 3>The state got nobody put a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>camera on me when I was 18 and asked me </v>

4763
03:17:06.021 --> 03:17:06.021
<v Speaker 3>how the world should work.</v>

4764
03:17:06.021 --> 03:17:06.400
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4765
03:17:06.480 --> 03:17:11.480
<v Speaker 3>we've all said and done stupid things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's too young to realize what's </v>

4766
03:17:11.480 --> 03:17:15.771
<v Speaker 3>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but colleges are breeding this sort of </v>

4767
03:17:15.771 --> 03:17:15.771
<v Speaker 3>thing and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's.</v>

4768
03:17:15.771 --> 03:17:16.800
<v Speaker 3>I know that people say like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's overdrawn and it's not as bad as it</v>

4769
03:17:16.801 --> 03:17:17.280
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

4770
03:17:17.281 --> 03:17:19.800
<v Speaker 3>I think it is specifically because when </v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in college,</v>

4771
03:17:19.801 --> 03:17:24.801
<v Speaker 3>I only graduated 10 years ago in May.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This wasn't happening and I went to </v>

4772
03:17:24.840 --> 03:17:26.970
<v Speaker 3>evergreen state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bret Weinstein.</v>

4773
03:17:27.030 --> 03:17:28.540
<v Speaker 3>I never saw anything like this in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life and I,</v>

4774
03:17:28.560 --> 03:17:33.560
<v Speaker 3>I never saw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never heard about this and other </v>

4775
03:17:33.560 --> 03:17:33.560
<v Speaker 3>colleges in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty liberal place.</v>

4776
03:17:33.560 --> 03:17:36.720
<v Speaker 3>So this is a newer phenomenon and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>destructive.</v>

4777
03:17:36.721 --> 03:17:38.400
<v Speaker 3>It's core,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's corrosive,</v>

4778
03:17:38.550 --> 03:17:42.690
<v Speaker 3>and it's very damaging to people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>confidence in universities and you know,</v>

4779
03:17:42.691 --> 03:17:47.691
<v Speaker 3>like look what's happening to evergreen </v>
<v Speaker 3>state financially that college getting </v>

4780
03:17:47.691 --> 03:17:51.651
<v Speaker 3>devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are voting to defund it and it's </v>

4781
03:17:51.651 --> 03:17:51.651
<v Speaker 3>got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've,</v>

4782
03:17:51.651 --> 03:17:53.720
<v Speaker 3>they have real issues with enrollment </v>
<v Speaker 3>now the,</v>

4783
03:17:53.721 --> 03:17:54.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy that is running,</v>

4784
03:17:54.661 --> 03:17:59.661
<v Speaker 3>there was a real interesting article </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I just read yesterday where the </v>

4785
03:17:59.661 --> 03:18:03.471
<v Speaker 3>president was talking about what an </v>
<v Speaker 3>impact it's taken on his health and his </v>

4786
03:18:03.471 --> 03:18:07.791
<v Speaker 3>mental health and he's unable to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctly now and he's unable to like </v>

4787
03:18:07.791 --> 03:18:10.140
<v Speaker 3>the guy is like literally shell shocked.</v>

4788
03:18:10.520 --> 03:18:15.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His decision making skills are very </v>

4789
03:18:15.520 --> 03:18:15.610
<v Speaker 3>foggy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He saying these,</v>

4790
03:18:15.710 --> 03:18:17.430
<v Speaker 3>this is what happens when you let </v>
<v Speaker 3>petulant,</v>

4791
03:18:17.640 --> 03:18:19.940
<v Speaker 3>ignorant children think that they run up</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

4792
03:18:19.950 --> 03:18:21.050
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

4793
03:18:21.110 --> 03:18:23.310
<v Speaker 3>an establishment of higher learning when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there to,</v>

4794
03:18:23.311 --> 03:18:25.620
<v Speaker 3>under when you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I entered college,</v>

4795
03:18:25.770 --> 03:18:27.660
<v Speaker 3>I went under the knowledge that I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know anything.</v>

4796
03:18:27.720 --> 03:18:29.240
<v Speaker 3>How do you turn this around though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

4797
03:18:29.241 --> 03:18:30.390
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

4798
03:18:30.391 --> 03:18:31.510
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really feel like it,</v>

4799
03:18:31.511 --> 03:18:34.110
<v Speaker 3>it comes down in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It comes down to the people that pay the</v>

4800
03:18:34.111 --> 03:18:35.010
<v Speaker 3>bills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion.</v>

4801
03:18:35.050 --> 03:18:40.050
<v Speaker 3>Feel like the parents need to not be </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy with the product they're getting </v>

4802
03:18:40.050 --> 03:18:41.280
<v Speaker 3>when they find that their child is now </v>
<v Speaker 3>an antifa member when he went,</v>

4803
03:18:41.330 --> 03:18:46.330
<v Speaker 3>when he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he comes back for Thanksgiving or </v>

4804
03:18:46.330 --> 03:18:46.330
<v Speaker 3>for Christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to ask yourself like,</v>

4805
03:18:46.330 --> 03:18:46.600
<v Speaker 3>what is happening?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4806
03:18:46.630 --> 03:18:48.190
<v Speaker 3>like this isn't because</v>

4807
03:18:48.190 --> 03:18:53.190
<v Speaker 5>people point back to the sixties when </v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a very righteous wave of anti </v>

4808
03:18:53.190 --> 03:18:58.130
<v Speaker 5>authority and anthro </v>
<v Speaker 5>anti-authoritarianism that was born in </v>

4809
03:18:58.130 --> 03:18:58.130
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in this,</v>

4810
03:18:58.130 --> 03:18:59.470
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this very specific climate.</v>

4811
03:18:59.550 --> 03:19:04.550
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think it's going to take a long </v>

4812
03:19:04.550 --> 03:19:04.770
<v Speaker 5>time to fix.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of it is because of a,</v>

4813
03:19:04.810 --> 03:19:07.120
<v Speaker 5>it's a very incestuous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Academia is very incestuous.</v>

4814
03:19:07.360 --> 03:19:09.760
<v Speaker 5>You hire people that agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you hire people that believe in you.</v>

4815
03:19:10.720 --> 03:19:13.540
<v Speaker 5>That's why you find,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is it like 19 out of 20 people that</v>

4816
03:19:13.541 --> 03:19:15.730
<v Speaker 5>teach it at a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at universities or liberal?</v>

4817
03:19:16.300 --> 03:19:21.300
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that's insane that that's not </v>

4818
03:19:21.300 --> 03:19:21.980
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That like even if I,</v>

4819
03:19:22.000 --> 03:19:23.830
<v Speaker 5>if I were a liberal or a Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd look at that and be like,</v>

4820
03:19:23.831 --> 03:19:28.831
<v Speaker 5>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's like it's own form of social </v>

4821
03:19:28.831 --> 03:19:28.831
<v Speaker 5>engineering that we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've cooperative.</v>

4822
03:19:28.831 --> 03:19:31.660
<v Speaker 5>Not only have we call it a lot of media,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is why the media hates youtube and</v>

4823
03:19:31.661 --> 03:19:33.130
<v Speaker 5>they had all these things because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>can't control that,</v>

4824
03:19:33.280 --> 03:19:34.510
<v Speaker 5>but now we've co opted academia.</v>

4825
03:19:34.510 --> 03:19:39.510
<v Speaker 5>Your ability to get a degree is going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>have to go through these people that </v>

4826
03:19:39.510 --> 03:19:40.240
<v Speaker 5>are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you might be diametrically opposed to or</v>

4827
03:19:40.241 --> 03:19:45.241
<v Speaker 5>at the very least aligned to you about a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of things and I'm just 10 years ago </v>

4828
03:19:45.241 --> 03:19:47.810
<v Speaker 5>that was certainly not my experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I fear for know,</v>

4829
03:19:47.950 --> 03:19:52.950
<v Speaker 5>which is another reason why I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if college is the best </v>

4830
03:19:52.950 --> 03:19:53.140
<v Speaker 5>solution for a lot of even able minded </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

4831
03:19:53.320 --> 03:19:58.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like where it's like I don't know what </v>

4832
03:19:58.320 --> 03:19:58.320
<v Speaker 5>you get from going there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

4833
03:19:58.320 --> 03:19:58.320
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

4834
03:19:58.320 --> 03:19:59.680
<v Speaker 5>if you study a discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll probably get out.</v>

4835
03:19:59.681 --> 03:20:00.670
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

4836
03:20:00.720 --> 03:20:01.660
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>physics,</v>

4837
03:20:01.661 --> 03:20:02.170
<v Speaker 5>math,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

4838
03:20:02.530 --> 03:20:04.300
<v Speaker 5>If you're studying humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4839
03:20:04.720 --> 03:20:05.410
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

4840
03:20:05.411 --> 03:20:10.411
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what you're getting out of </v>

4841
03:20:10.411 --> 03:20:10.411
<v Speaker 5>that now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I studied the humanity.</v>

4842
03:20:10.411 --> 03:20:10.411
<v Speaker 5>I had a lot of liberal professors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a lot of conservative professors.</v>

4843
03:20:10.411 --> 03:20:15.390
<v Speaker 5>I wonder what that mix is like now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you get different history based on </v>

4844
03:20:15.390 --> 03:20:15.390
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4845
03:20:15.390 --> 03:20:16.920
<v Speaker 5>I get kids send me tweets all the time </v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

4846
03:20:16.930 --> 03:20:19.240
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>photos of something that their professor</v>

4847
03:20:19.241 --> 03:20:24.241
<v Speaker 5>is a showing in class.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like someone just sent me something the </v>

4848
03:20:24.241 --> 03:20:27.061
<v Speaker 5>other day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a photograph of a overhead </v>

4849
03:20:27.061 --> 03:20:30.121
<v Speaker 5>projection and it said something about </v>
<v Speaker 5>science being a social construct and </v>

4850
03:20:31.301 --> 03:20:32.710
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the kind of shit I'm learning in</v>

4851
03:20:32.711 --> 03:20:33.230
<v Speaker 5>school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4852
03:20:33.310 --> 03:20:34.270
<v Speaker 5>I think I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I.</v>

4853
03:20:34.330 --> 03:20:35.580
<v Speaker 5>Did you retweet it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You retweeted that?</v>

4854
03:20:35.581 --> 03:20:36.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw that pop up on my feet.</v>

4855
03:20:37.420 --> 03:20:39.230
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what in the fuck is,</v>

4856
03:20:39.340 --> 03:20:41.500
<v Speaker 5>how is this guy a goddamn professor?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4857
03:20:41.501 --> 03:20:42.990
<v Speaker 5>this is the whole thing with like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4858
03:20:43.060 --> 03:20:43.960
<v Speaker 5>even the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4859
03:20:43.961 --> 03:20:46.270
<v Speaker 5>the way this is manifesting itself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Moses with transgender,</v>

4860
03:20:46.480 --> 03:20:51.480
<v Speaker 5>the transgender issue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I made a video about this where </v>

4861
03:20:51.480 --> 03:20:51.480
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know that the science has really</v>

4862
03:20:51.480 --> 03:20:51.550
<v Speaker 5>been important.</v>

4863
03:20:51.550 --> 03:20:54.310
<v Speaker 5>If a person wants to say that they're a </v>
<v Speaker 5>woman and they were born a man,</v>

4864
03:20:54.311 --> 03:20:56.170
<v Speaker 5>I don't really care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter.</v>

4865
03:20:56.171 --> 03:20:57.640
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you need to site typical </v>
<v Speaker 5>justify it.</v>

4866
03:20:57.641 --> 03:21:02.641
<v Speaker 5>But I think the scientific justification</v>
<v Speaker 5>for this whole gender normative kind of </v>

4867
03:21:02.641 --> 03:21:06.450
<v Speaker 5>thing is actually going to backfire on </v>
<v Speaker 5>them pretty badly because they've </v>

4868
03:21:06.450 --> 03:21:06.450
<v Speaker 5>decided to make something that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4869
03:21:06.450 --> 03:21:08.770
<v Speaker 5>if you get a blood test right and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>can study,</v>

4870
03:21:09.200 --> 03:21:11.470
<v Speaker 5>study it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to come out as a male,</v>

4871
03:21:11.560 --> 03:21:13.060
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if you identify something else,</v>

4872
03:21:13.061 --> 03:21:14.470
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't mean you can't identify </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

4873
03:21:14.620 --> 03:21:16.450
<v Speaker 5>But if you're going to predicate your </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole notion on that,</v>

4874
03:21:16.451 --> 03:21:19.450
<v Speaker 5>this is science and it doesn't seem like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that might be the case,</v>

4875
03:21:19.570 --> 03:21:24.570
<v Speaker 5>then you're actually injuring the social</v>
<v Speaker 5>movement of people just being accepted </v>

4876
03:21:24.570 --> 03:21:25.960
<v Speaker 5>for who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I feel like this is,</v>

4877
03:21:25.990 --> 03:21:28.150
<v Speaker 5>this is where you start engineering </v>
<v Speaker 5>science to,</v>

4878
03:21:28.180 --> 03:21:30.970
<v Speaker 5>to fit your narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think it's a very,</v>

4879
03:21:30.971 --> 03:21:32.710
<v Speaker 5>very dangerous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People,</v>

4880
03:21:32.890 --> 03:21:34.300
<v Speaker 5>people do the same thing with global </v>
<v Speaker 5>warming.</v>

4881
03:21:34.310 --> 03:21:39.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think global warming is obviously </v>

4882
03:21:39.310 --> 03:21:39.310
<v Speaker 5>real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4883
03:21:39.310 --> 03:21:39.310
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the science says that.</v>

4884
03:21:39.310 --> 03:21:40.190
<v Speaker 5>I think that is maybe not as bad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's bad.</v>

4885
03:21:40.191 --> 03:21:40.840
<v Speaker 5>It's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

4886
03:21:40.870 --> 03:21:42.580
<v Speaker 5>it's effecting things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>making storms worse.</v>

4887
03:21:42.640 --> 03:21:44.980
<v Speaker 5>Sea levels are rising.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But people manipulate that to say like,</v>

4888
03:21:44.990 --> 03:21:45.680
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything's fine.</v>

4889
03:21:45.710 --> 03:21:46.100
<v Speaker 5>Just hand</v>

4890
03:21:46.100 --> 03:21:47.900
<v Speaker 3>wave it away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not true,</v>

4891
03:21:48.140 --> 03:21:49.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I feel like,</v>

4892
03:21:49.510 --> 03:21:54.510
<v Speaker 3>so I feel like we have to predicate </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything on scientific truth when we </v>

4893
03:21:54.510 --> 03:21:57.461
<v Speaker 3>can and then give leeway to say like I </v>
<v Speaker 3>use the example I used was homosexuality</v>

4894
03:21:57.710 --> 03:22:00.340
<v Speaker 3>where there was a theory for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 3>that homosexuality wasn't something that</v>

4895
03:22:00.341 --> 03:22:01.550
<v Speaker 3>was born in new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was a choice.</v>

4896
03:22:01.580 --> 03:22:06.580
<v Speaker 3>Now we know that that's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's actually something that's in </v>

4897
03:22:06.580 --> 03:22:06.580
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even if it was a choice,</v>

4898
03:22:06.580 --> 03:22:09.530
<v Speaker 3>who cares why predicated on that if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe in freedom.</v>

4899
03:22:09.840 --> 03:22:11.180
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

4900
03:22:11.300 --> 03:22:12.830
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So with the transgender thing,</v>

4901
03:22:12.831 --> 03:22:17.831
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that you're even attacking </v>

4902
03:22:17.831 --> 03:22:17.831
<v Speaker 3>this from the right angle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should be attacking it from a social</v>

4903
03:22:17.831 --> 03:22:22.661
<v Speaker 3>acceptance angle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which again goes back to the idea of </v>

4904
03:22:22.661 --> 03:22:22.661
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's actually the conservative</v>

4905
03:22:22.661 --> 03:22:23.730
<v Speaker 3>stance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4906
03:22:23.930 --> 03:22:26.350
<v Speaker 3>but people would argue with me on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>column.</v>

4907
03:22:26.360 --> 03:22:28.400
<v Speaker 3>We're going to do this more often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Enjoyed this man.</v>

4908
03:22:28.430 --> 03:22:28.970
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did too.</v>

4909
03:22:28.971 --> 03:22:30.170
<v Speaker 3>Thank you for having me back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a great honor.</v>

4910
03:22:30.171 --> 03:22:31.550
<v Speaker 3>Two hours and 20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4911
03:22:31.700 --> 03:22:32.990

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

4912
03:22:33.200 --> 03:22:34.370
<v Speaker 3>Three hours and 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

4913
03:22:34.371 --> 03:22:35.600
<v Speaker 3>Well I thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you so much.</v>

4914
03:22:35.630 --> 03:22:36.830
<v Speaker 3>It was a great honor for you to ask me </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

4915
03:22:36.831 --> 03:22:37.940
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you so much.</v>
